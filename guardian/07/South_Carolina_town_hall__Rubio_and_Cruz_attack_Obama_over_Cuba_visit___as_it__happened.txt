First half of two-night Republican town hall event on CNN concludes

Scott Bixby

Some quick evaluations of the performances by Ben Carson, Marco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> and Ted Cruz:

 * Ben Carson had the benefit of being the first candidate on the state 
tonight, with a fresh audience in both the room and in TV Land. He was 
commended by moderator Anderson Cooper and by audience members for his 
even-keeled temperament and affect, but the candidate, already polling far 
below the top tier in South Carolina, may have been cursed by his own 
affability on a question about replacing the late Antonin Scalia on the supreme 
court.“I probably would take the opportunity to nominate someone,” Carson said. 
“It doesn’t necessarily mean that person is going to be acted on or confirmed. 
Why not do it?” Carson’s lamentation about the destructive nature of 
partisanship is noble, but will do little to endear him to conservative South 
Carolina primary voters who dread the prospect of Barack Obama replacing Scalia 
- a justice of whom Ted Cruz later said:“What Ronald Reagan was to the White 
House, Scalia was to the supreme court.”

 * Marco Rubio’s pushback against Barack Obama - who, it bears noting, is not 
a candidate for the Republican nomination - on the issue of immigration was a 
momentary lapse in focus in what was otherwise a good night for the Florida 
senator. The high point, at least in terms of combating the #MarcoBot 
stereotype Rubio has been fighting, may have been his comments on race and 
racism in America, mentioning his childhood in Las Vegas during the Mariel 
boatlift.“Whether you agree with them or not, if a significant percentage of 
the American family feels that they are being treated differently than anyone 
else, we have a problem then we have to address that as a society and as a 
country,” Rubio said about racism. “I do not believe we can fulfill our 
potential as a nation unless we address that. I’m not sure there is a political 
solution to that problem, but there are things we can do.”

 * Ted Cruz started out strong, deftly ignoring attempts by Cooper to goad him 
into attacking Donald Trump head-on and putting his Harvard law degree to good 
use in detailing why his Canadian birth doesn’t preclude him from the 
presidency. But amind-numbingly long answer on his history of antagonizing 
congressional colleagues in the US Senate - at least, I think that’s what the 
original question was about - shifted dangerously close to the samestump-speech 
autopilot that Rubio has faced such intense criticism for. Cruz later talked 
about the importance of “having fun” on the campaign trail - he might want to 
take his own advice next time. 
That’s it for tonight’s coverage of the first half of CNN’s Republican town 
hall. We’ll be back tomorrow for part two, as well as on Friday, Saturday, and 
every day until the sweet release of Election Day in November.

Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> said: “Barack Obama, 
in the first weeks of his administration, sent the bust of Winston Churchill 
back to the United Kingdom. If I’m elected president, Winston Churchill is 
coming back.”

WHAT DOES THIS EVEN MEAN? THIS IS LIKE LISTENING TO A RADIO SHOW YELL A BUMPER 
STICKER AT A PRINTOUT OF AN EMAIL FORWARD. COULD THIS BE ANY MORE TRIFLING AND 
STUPID?


[Ed note: The bust was loaned to then-President George W Bush by then-Prime 
Minister Tony Blair and returned as a matter of protocol 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/27/ted-cruzs-claim-that-one-of-obamas-very-first-acts-was-returning-a-bust-of-churchill/>
. A separate bust of Churchill, given to then-President Lyndon B Johnson, 
remains in the White House today.]

might.

Which cabinet position would Cruz fill first?

“It would be a three-way tie between secretary of state, secretary of defense 
and attorney general,” Cruz says. “When it comes to defense, we have to begin 
rebuilding our military immediately. When it comes to state... moving the 
embassy to Israel tells Israel, it tells our allies, it tells our enemies that 
America is back.”

“We need someone strong, someone who represents this country,” Cruz says of a 
potential secretary of state. “A secretary of state in a Cruz administration 
would be someone like John Bolton.” As for an attorney general, Cruz declares 
that “the lawlessness of the Obama administration has been one of the saddest 
legacies”.

“The only fidelity of the department of justice will be to the laws and 
constitution of the United States,” Cruz concludes.

Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>, who sits on the 
Senate judiciary committee, tells Anderson Cooper that he would not endorse a 
committee hearing on whomever Barack Obama nominates to fill the supreme court 
seat formerly occupied by the late Antonin Scalia.

“They should not” get a hearing, Cruz says. “For 80 years, it has been the 
practice that the senate has not confirmed any nomination that has occurred 
during an election year ... I don’t think it would be fair to the nominee.”

Earlier Cruz was asked about Obama’s planned visit to Cuba. Is that something 
he would do?

It is not as long as Castro is in power. And I will say I was saddened to hear 
that [but] I wasn’t surprised. This was foreshadowed for a long time.

Ted Cruz is asked to defend his status as a natural-born citizen of the United 
States

“The law under the constitution and federal law has been clear from the very 
first days of the republic,” Cruz says. “The child of a US citizen is a US 
citizen by virtue of birth.”


“I was a citizen by birth by virtue of my mother’s citizenship... it was the 
act of being born that made me a US citizen,” Cruz says. Of the possibility of 
Donald Trump suing him on the matter - “you can never write off the possibility 
ofDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> suing you,” 
Cruz says - “if he wants to file a lawsuit, he can file it and lose.”

Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> thinks that the 
fluctuations in the oil market are created by fiat currency and thinks that a 
dollar tied to a fixed amount of gold is a stable dollar that would level out 
fluctuations in the oil market.

That is a really interesting economic idea with nothing that could contradict 
it apart from, say, the history of America in the 19th century.

“Our relationship with Saudi Arabia is, as you know, fraught with 
complications,”Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> says. 
“When it comes to Saudi Arabia, we need ot have real scrutiny and real 
pressure.”

“They are not seeking our interests - they are seeking their monetary 
interests,” Cruz elaborates. To combat the “stranglehold” foreign nations have 
on American energy, Cruz says, we need to develop American-sourced energy 
sources. “This country is blessed with abundant natural resources... but you 
shouldn’t have government picking winners and losers. There shouldn’t be any 
subsidies.”

Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> said tonight – 
incorrectly – that Trump had said George W Bush should be impeached during the 
last debate. He said: “To see, on a Republican presidential stage a candidate 
suggesting that we should have impeached George W Bush, that really draws into 
question the judgement of that candidate to be commander in chief.

But, though Trump attacked W Bush’s record at the last debate (and said in 
2008 that he would’ve been happy to see Pelosi impeach Bush 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/16/our-principles-pac/anti-trump-ad-says-he-backed-impeaching-bush/>
), he actually deliberately avoided suggesting he ought to have been impeached.

Perhaps Cruz was banking on most South Carolinians having skipped it? 


(And, yes, it seems like one could spend all night fact checking Ted Cruz.)

A pastor asks Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> about 
the “growing threat” against religious values in the United States, an area of 
particular focus for the Cruz campaign.

“We are seeing an assault on Judeo-Christian values, we are seeing an assault 
on religious liberty, and we need a president who will stand up and protect 
those values,” Cruz says, declaring that candidates should be held to a higher 
standard than just parroting pro-life, anti-gay marriage statements.

“You shall know them by their fruits,” Cruz quotes the Bible, referencing his 
history of fighting Planned Parenthood in court and protecting a statue of the 
ten commandments in front of the Texas capitol. “In June of last year we saw a 
decision from the supreme court that was nothing short of tragic... I think 
there’s something really wrong when Republican candidates are echoing the 
talking points of Barack Obama.”

“When it comes to religious liberty, if I’m elected president I intend on the 
first day I enter office to instruct... every government agency that the 
persecution of religious liberty ends today.”

“We will not be drafting our daughters into the front lines ... I’m the father 
of two daughters. Women can do anything, but the idea that the federal 
government could forcibly conscript women into service doesn’t make any sense.”

It’s like Cruz is saying Women can do anything, except this one thing, for no 
reason I can come up with, because I said so, and they’re women. Unless he’s 
just objecting to people being drafted into combat, in which case, please 
condemn that happening to men, too. Because I am a lazy man, and there is no 
United States Army Nap Battalion.

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> questions Trump’s judgment.

“I thought it was ridiculous,” Cruz says. “Listen - I like Donald. I am not

Why does Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> think that 
saying “radical Islamic terrorism” does anything to stop terrorism? It’s so 
exhausting hearing the Beetlejuice theory of military policy.

How many times do you have to say it for it to work? Do you have to say it 
really loud? Do you have to say it in a mirror, with the lights off, holding a 
candle? Who then defeats the terrorists? Is it Bloody Mary or The Candyman?

Also, it’s just such a funny argument to make from someone who has to 
constantly distort the record to advance his points. If naming something what 
it actuallyis magically solves problems, it’s puzzling that Cruz is so averse 
to telling the whole truth and nothing but in many other circumstances.

Some quick evaluations of the performances by Ben Carson, Marco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> and Ted Cruz:

 * Ben Carson had the benefit of being the first candidate on the state 
tonight, with a fresh audience in both the room and in TV Land. He was 
commended by moderator Anderson Cooper and by audience members for his 
even-keeled temperament and affect, but the candidate, already polling far 
below the top tier in South Carolina, may have been cursed by his own 
affability on a question about replacing the late Antonin Scalia on the supreme 
court.“I probably would take the opportunity to nominate someone,” Carson said. 
“It doesn’t necessarily mean that person is going to be acted on or confirmed. 
Why not do it?” Carson’s lamentation about the destructive nature of 
partisanship is noble, but will do little to endear him to conservative South 
Carolina primary voters who dread the prospect of Barack Obama replacing Scalia 
- a justice of whom Ted Cruz later said:“What Ronald Reagan was to the White 
House, Scalia was to the supreme court.”

 * Marco Rubio’s pushback against Barack Obama - who, it bears noting, is not 
a candidate for the Republican nomination - on the issue of immigration was a 
momentary lapse in focus in what was otherwise a good night for the Florida 
senator. The high point, at least in terms of combating the #MarcoBot 
stereotype Rubio has been fighting, may have been his comments on race and 
racism in America, mentioning his childhood in Las Vegas during the Mariel 
boatlift.“Whether you agree with them or not, if a significant percentage of 
the American family feels that they are being treated differently than anyone 
else, we have a problem then we have to address that as a society and as a 
country,” Rubio said about racism. “I do not believe we can fulfill our 
potential as a nation unless we address that. I’m not sure there is a political 
solution to that problem, but there are things we can do.”

 * Ted Cruz started out strong, deftly ignoring attempts by Cooper to goad him 
into attacking Donald Trump head-on and putting his Harvard law degree to good 
use in detailing why his Canadian birth doesn’t preclude him from the 
presidency. But amind-numbingly long answer on his history of antagonizing 
congressional colleagues in the US Senate - at least, I think that’s what the 
original question was about - shifted dangerously close to the samestump-speech 
autopilot that Rubio has faced such intense criticism for. Cruz later talked 
about the importance of “having fun” on the campaign trail - he might want to 
take his own advice next time. 
That’s it for tonight’s coverage of the first half of CNN’s Republican town 
hall. We’ll be back tomorrow for part two, as well as on Friday, Saturday, and 
every day until the sweet release of Election Day in November.
 
Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> said: “Barack Obama, 
in the first weeks of his administration, sent the bust of Winston Churchill 
back to the United Kingdom. If I’m elected president, Winston Churchill is 
coming back.”

WHAT DOES THIS EVEN MEAN? THIS IS LIKE LISTENING TO A RADIO SHOW YELL A BUMPER 
STICKER AT A PRINTOUT OF AN EMAIL FORWARD. COULD THIS BE ANY MORE TRIFLING AND 
STUPID?


[Ed note: The bust was loaned to then-President George W Bush by then-Prime 
Minister Tony Blair and returned as a matter of protocol 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/27/ted-cruzs-claim-that-one-of-obamas-very-first-acts-was-returning-a-bust-of-churchill/>
. A separate bust of Churchill, given to then-President Lyndon B Johnson, 
remains in the White House today.]
 
Would it kill Republicans to crack a joke? Actually, some of them, I think it 
might.

– Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>, on the need to “let 
loose” on the campaign trail.

 
Which cabinet position would Cruz fill first?

“It would be a three-way tie between secretary of state, secretary of defense 
and attorney general,” Cruz says. “When it comes to defense, we have to begin 
rebuilding our military immediately. When it comes to state... moving the 
embassy to Israel tells Israel, it tells our allies, it tells our enemies that 
America is back.”

“We need someone strong, someone who represents this country,” Cruz says of a 
potential secretary of state. “A secretary of state in a Cruz administration 
would be someone like John Bolton.” As for an attorney general, Cruz declares 
that “the lawlessness of the Obama administration has been one of the saddest 
legacies”.

“The only fidelity of the department of justice will be to the laws and 
constitution of the United States,” Cruz concludes.
 
This is a strange election season in many ways.

– Ted Cruz, on being called a liar by Marco Rubio and Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>
 
Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>, who sits on the 
Senate judiciary committee, tells Anderson Cooper that he would not endorse a 
committee hearing on whomever Barack Obama nominates to fill the supreme court 
seat formerly occupied by the late Antonin Scalia.

“They should not” get a hearing, Cruz says. “For 80 years, it has been the 
practice that the senate has not confirmed any nomination that has occurred 
during an election year ... I don’t think it would be fair to the nominee.”
 
Earlier Cruz was asked about Obama’s planned visit to Cuba. Is that something 
he would do?

It is not as long as Castro is in power. And I will say I was saddened to hear 
that [but] I wasn’t surprised. This was foreshadowed for a long time.
 
“The law under the constitution and federal law has been clear from the very 
first days of the republic,” Cruz says. “The child of a US citizen is a US 
citizen by virtue of birth.”


“I was a citizen by birth by virtue of my mother’s citizenship... it was the 
act of being born that made me a US citizen,” Cruz says. Of the possibility of 
Donald Trump suing him on the matter - “you can never write off the possibility 
ofDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> suing you,” 
Cruz says - “if he wants to file a lawsuit, he can file it and lose.”
 
Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> thinks that the 
fluctuations in the oil market are created by fiat currency and thinks that a 
dollar tied to a fixed amount of gold is a stable dollar that would level out 
fluctuations in the oil market.

That is a really interesting economic idea with nothing that could contradict 
it apart from, say, the history of America in the 19th century.
 
“Our relationship with Saudi Arabia is, as you know, fraught with 
complications,”Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> says. 
“When it comes to Saudi Arabia, we need ot have real scrutiny and real 
pressure.”

“They are not seeking our interests - they are seeking their monetary 
interests,” Cruz elaborates. To combat the “stranglehold” foreign nations have 
on American energy, Cruz says, we need to develop American-sourced energy 
sources. “This country is blessed with abundant natural resources... but you 
shouldn’t have government picking winners and losers. There shouldn’t be any 
subsidies.”
 
Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> said tonight – 
incorrectly – that Trump had said George W Bush should be impeached during the 
last debate. He said: “To see, on a Republican presidential stage a candidate 
suggesting that we should have impeached George W Bush, that really draws into 
question the judgement of that candidate to be commander in chief.

But, though Trump attacked W Bush’s record at the last debate (and said in 
2008 that he would’ve been happy to see Pelosi impeach Bush 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/16/our-principles-pac/anti-trump-ad-says-he-backed-impeaching-bush/>
), he actually deliberately avoided suggesting he ought to have been impeached.

Perhaps Cruz was banking on most South Carolinians having skipped it? 


(And, yes, it seems like one could spend all night fact checking Ted Cruz.)
 
A pastor asks Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> about 
the “growing threat” against religious values in the United States, an area of 
particular focus for the Cruz campaign.

“We are seeing an assault on Judeo-Christian values, we are seeing an assault 
on religious liberty, and we need a president who will stand up and protect 
those values,” Cruz says, declaring that candidates should be held to a higher 
standard than just parroting pro-life, anti-gay marriage statements.

“You shall know them by their fruits,” Cruz quotes the Bible, referencing his 
history of fighting Planned Parenthood in court and protecting a statue of the 
ten commandments in front of the Texas capitol. “In June of last year we saw a 
decision from the supreme court that was nothing short of tragic... I think 
there’s something really wrong when Republican candidates are echoing the 
talking points of Barack Obama.”

“When it comes to religious liberty, if I’m elected president I intend on the 
first day I enter office to instruct... every government agency that the 
persecution of religious liberty ends today.”
 
“We will not be drafting our daughters into the front lines ... I’m the father 
of two daughters. Women can do anything, but the idea that the federal 
government could forcibly conscript women into service doesn’t make any sense.”

It’s like Cruz is saying Women can do anything, except this one thing, for no 
reason I can come up with, because I said so, and they’re women. Unless he’s 
just objecting to people being drafted into combat, in which case, please 
condemn that happening to men, too. Because I am a lazy man, and there is no 
United States Army Nap Battalion.
 
When asked about Donald Trump’s assertion at the last Republican presidential 
debate that George W Bush didn’t keep the United States safe because the 9/11 
terror attacks happened under his watch,Ted Cruz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> questions Trump’s judgment.

“I thought it was ridiculous,” Cruz says. “Listen - I like Donald. I am not 
gonna engage in personal attacks - but his policies don’t make sense.”
 
Why does Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> think that 
saying “radical Islamic terrorism” does anything to stop terrorism? It’s so 
exhausting hearing the Beetlejuice theory of military policy.

How many times do you have to say it for it to work? Do you have to say it 
really loud? Do you have to say it in a mirror, with the lights off, holding a 
candle? Who then defeats the terrorists? Is it Bloody Mary or The Candyman?

Also, it’s just such a funny argument to make from someone who has to 
constantly distort the record to advance his points. If naming something what 
it actuallyis magically solves problems, it’s puzzling that Cruz is so averse 
to telling the whole truth and nothing but in many other circumstances.
