2 A Brazilian Christmas

Jeffrey Skidmore’s Ex Cathedra choir make another foray into the largely 
unexplored treasury of South American music composed between the 17th and 19th 
centuries. Their latest programme is built around a work by Brazilian composer 
João de Deus de Castro Lobo.

4 Schnee

The London Sinfonietta prefaces Hans Abrahamsen’s exhaustive exploration of 
canons with two new works: Simon Holt’s piccolo concerto Fool Is Hurt is 
inspired by Fellini’s film La Strada, while Morgan Hayes’s Overture: The Kiss 
continues Abrahamsen’s canonic obsession.

5 Christmas Oratorio

Bach’s collection of six cantatas, spreading the nativity story over the major 
feast days of the church’s Christmas season, is regular fare at this time of 
year. But the Orchestra Of The Age Of Enlightenment’s performance – split 
across two evenings – promises to be a special one, for it’s conducted by one 
of the leading Bach specialists of our time, Masaaki Suzuki.
Cadogan Hall, SW1, Fri & 10 Dec
