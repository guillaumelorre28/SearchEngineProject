Charlie Hebdo plans to publish a “journal des survivants” 
<http://www.charliehebdo.fr/index.html> next week, as pledges of money and 
other forms of support continue to pour in from media organisations in France 
and elsewhere.

On Friday morning about 20 surviving Charlie Hebdo staff gathered at the 
offices of French newspaper Libération 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/09/charlie-hebdo-fist-editorial-meeting-liberation>
, for their first editorial meeting since Wednesday’s terrorist attack on its 
Paris headquartersin which 12 people, including eight of the title’s 
journalists and two policemen, were killed

.

Those at the table included the cartoonist Luz, who escaped the carnage 
because he was late on Wednesday, reporter Laurent Léger, columnist Patrick 
Pelloux and the paper’s lawyer, Richard Malka.

Asked about the mood as he slipped outside the room, Malka simply said: “We’re 
organising our work.”

The journalists asked for their privacy to be respected while they work on 
next Wednesday’s “special survival” edition, which will be limited to eight 
pages instead of the usual 16. A million copies are to be printed, a huge 
increase on its usual 60,000 print run.

The Libération building, located close to the Charlie Hebdo premises, is now 
under armed police guard. Visitors are only allowed in with a specific 
invitation from a staff member and have to leave via the adjacent car park.

Among the visitors on Friday was the prime minister, Manuel Valls, accompanied 
by the culture minister, Fleur Pellerin, who has promised €1m (£780,000) to the 
paper to guarantee its survival.

Guardian Media Group has pledged £100,000 
<https://twitter.com/arusbridger/status/553298181568884737>, while more funding 
has come from the TV station Canal+ and Le Monde which has supplied the 
computers. Although “structural” state subventions are provided to French 
media, satirical publications have been excluded until now.

Asked about the irony of the state propping up the deliberately provocative 
Charlie Hebdo, one Libération staff member said: “It’s normal. This is a 
democracy.”

A defiant message <http://www.charliehebdo.fr/index.html> was published on the 
Charlie Hebdo website on Thursday,after it emerged that the title 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/08/charlie-hebdo-staff-publish-next-week-1m-print-run>
 had been pledged €250,000 (£195,000) from the Google-backed Digital Press Fund.


Under what has become the rallying cry for supporters of freedom of speech 
following the shocking violence of Wednesday’s attack, “Je suis Charlie”, the 
message stated: “Parce que le crayon sera toujours au dessus de lar barbarie 
... parce que la liberté est un droit universal ... parce que vous nous 
soutenez ...


“Charlie Hebdo - Le journal des survivants - mercredi 14/1 ... Nous, Charlie - 
sortirons votre journal mercredi prochain!”

des survivants’ on Wednesday Photograph: Charlie Hebdo 
The French media industry has rallied round the satirical weekly, with a 
public declaration of support 
<http://www.france24.com/en/20150108-france-media-statement-solidarity-charlie-hebdo-press-freedom/>
 signed by print titles including Le Monde, Le Figaro, Les Echos, L’Express, 
Paris Match and the news agency AFP.

Broadcasters including France 24, RTL, Arte, Nova, Radio France, Canal +, TF1 
and France Télévisions have also signed up to the statement, which declared: 
“We, the French media, stand ready to offer the human and material resources 
necessary to keep Charlie Hebdo alive. We must rally to defend the freedom of 
the press. And we will continue to defend it in the names of the fallen.”

French media and telecoms company Vivendi – which owns pay-TV business Canal + 
and Universal Music – is also drawing up plans to offer assistance to Charlie 
Hebdo.

Publicis Groupe, the French company that is the world’s third largest 
advertising and marketing services company, has pledged to offer financial 
support.


A spokeswoman for the company, which owns agencies including Saatchi & 
Saatchi, said that funds, which have not yet been set, will come from Publicis 
and also on a “personal level” from chief executive Maurice Levy.
