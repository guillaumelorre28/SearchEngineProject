The fast food chain McDonald’s has said it is disappointed Labour’s ruling 
national executive committee decided to bar it from running a stand at the 
party’s annual conference in Liverpool.

A Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> critic of Jeremy Corbyn 
accused the NEC of adopting a “snobby attitude” after it vetoed the McDonald’s 
stand, losing the party £30,000.

Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, told the Sun on Sunday: “I’m 
exasperated that we should throw away £30,000 worth of sponsorship like this. 
It smacks of a snobby attitude towards fast-food restaurants and people who 
work or eat at them.

“McDonald’s may not be the trendy falafel bar that some people in politics 
like to hang out at but it’s enjoyed by families across the country.”

Ian Austin, the former minister, tweeted: “Why has UKLabour turned down 30k 
from McDonald’s? My first job was in their branch of Dudley High Street.”

The Sun on Sunday reported that McDonald’s wanted to set up an “interactive 
experience” display to support British farm produce at the Labour conference. 
The Tories and SNP have allowed McDonald’s to set up similar stands at their 
conferences.

A McDonald’s spokesman said: “We are disappointed with the decision that has 
been taken.”

A Labour spokesperson said: “We do not comment on commercial decisions.”
