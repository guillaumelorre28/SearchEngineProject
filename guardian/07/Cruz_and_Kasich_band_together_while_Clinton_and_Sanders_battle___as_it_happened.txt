Today in Campaign 2016

It was a slow day before the five-state marathon of the so-called “Acela 
primaries” in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland and Delaware 
tomorrow, where the respective Democratic and Republican frontrunners are 
expected to win the lion’s share of the delegates apportioned tomorrow - if not 
sweep all five states.

Ahead of tomorrow, here’s a rundown of the biggest stories from the campaign 
trail today:

 * The Koch brothers and their powerful Freedom Partners network, an 
organization that has given millions to Republican candidates, won’t be 
attending this year’s Republican National Convention. “Why go?” askedCharles 
Koch, in an interview with ABC News 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/charles-koch-skipping-convention-paul-ryan-gops-white/story?id=38633798>
. Koch noted his frustration at the remaining candidates and the vicious 
attacking nature of this election. “So we’ve tried to change that for the 
better, but we haven’t been successful,” the billionaire businessman told ABC 
News. Koch even said it was “possible” they would supportHillary Clinton, with 
Clinton quick to reject any theoretical endorsement from the powerful 
climate-change denying billionaires. 
 * Donald Trump released a statement decrying the new John Kasich/Ted Cruz 
alliance, and his argument of collusion is an interesting one: “Collusion is 
often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders 
have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive. They are mathematically 
dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how 
truly weak they and their campaigns are.” 
 * The digs by Trump against Kasich got particularly personal today, with a 
jab at how the Ohio governor eats: Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone)

disgusting fashion"pic.twitter.com/AA6PDq9Mn5 <https://t.co/AA6PDq9Mn5>

<https://twitter.com/JoePerticone/status/724655508972539905> 
 * A spokesperson for former Hewlett-Packard CEO and presidential candidate 
Carly Fiorina, the onetime presidential candidate, confirmed that she is being 
vetted by Cruz’s campaign as a potential running mate. “Normal stuff,” Sarah 
Isgur Flores said, which apparently include financial disclosures and meetings 
with campaign staffers. 
 * Megyn Kelly, the Fox News anchor and the only person to come out of this 
campaign with better approval ratings than before, has officially landed an 
interview with Donald Trump. “Mr Trump and I sat down together for a meeting 
earlier this month at my request,” Kelly said in a release sent out by the 
cable network. “He was gracious with his time and I asked him to consider an 
interview. I am happy to announce he has agreed, and I look forward to a 
fascinating exchange - our first sit-down interview together in nearly a year.” 
That’s it for political news tonight - tune in tomorrow for up-to-the-second 
updates on the primary campaign in the Northeast!

A man who was himself incarcerated in the 1990s asks about criminal justice 
reform: “If you’re elected president of the United States, are you willing to 
make billion-dollar investments in the lives and communities in the people 
whose lives were impacted by the 1994 crime bill?”

“The answer is yes,” Clinton said, saying that a billion-dollar investment in 
front-end solutions to keep young people - particularly racial minorities - 
outside of prison in the first place is needed. “We need to have a lot more 
done to try to release nonviolent offenders, low-level offenders, we need to 
get them out of our prisons and jails,” she said. “I want us to have the best 
programs funded from the federal level, that will enable young people to finish 
their education and get back into society.”

Hillary Clinton, on having a Trudeau-esque cabinet:

Well, I am going to have a cabinet that looks like America, and half of our 
country is women.

Next question from an undecided voter who just changed her voter to Clinton: 
“What does it mean to you to be a feminist?”

“Women deserve the same rights as men in every aspect of our economy and our 
society, here at home and around the world,” Clinton said, to applause. “We 
have to do everything we can - though laws, regulation, culture - to change the 
still-existing stereotypes that hold women back.”

“We have made progress, but we are still a long way from where we need to be. 
If you look at pay, for example - equal pay is still a problem,” Clinton 
continued. “This has pervasive effects on women’s lives, and their well-being, 
so I think we have to keep hammering the points.”

“We have to start early - because a lot of little girls as they become 
teenagers, they begin to suffer all of these pressures,” Clinton said. “Stop 
it! We need to build the confidence - both of girls and boys.”

Rachel Maddow asks Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> about “the greatest 
frustration of [Obama’s] administration” - gun violence.

“If we take back the Senate - which I believe we can, and you in Pennsylvania 
have a really good chance to help us do that - the Democrats have decided that 
they will be led by Chuck Schumer,” who Clinton says has proven himself an 
effective opponent of gun lobbyists.

“I am determined - we are going to save lives, and we are going to do it by 
taking on the gun lobby and implementing common-sense gun safety reform,” 
Clinton said, saying that part of the battle is fighting against gun culture, 
“and that’s going to take all of us. We’ve got to break the grip of gun culture 
in our young people.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, 
addressing a question about how her policy priorities would differ from those 
of Barack Obama, her former boss, pointed out issues relating to equal pay and 
early childhood education as examples.

“I agree with a lot of what President Obama has done, and I don’t think he 
gets the credit he deserves in the work he has done as president,” Clinton 
said. “I want to really make a big, big push on equal pay for women.

“I believe that if we start early and we are determined there, we can make a 
difference there. I want to make a push on early childhood education,” she 
continued. “I would make a big push for affordable college, debt-free tuition.”

Another question from the audience, from a Harlem native whose parents 
struggled with drug addiction. “What as president you would do to address the 
systemic racism that still exists and creates a glass ceiling?”

“We have to talk about it more - and as a white person, I have to talk about 
it more. And say that we are not a ‘post-racial’ society, and that we still 
struggle with racism,” Clinton said.

“It is not only wrong - it is holding us back,” Clinton continued. “We want as 
productive a society as possible, so we have to enforce the civil rights laws, 
we have to use the bully pulpit.”

First question from a volunteer councilman: “Will you say what role you would 
trust Senator Sanders in in a Clinton administration?”

After demuring that she can’t begin to speak to administration positions 
before she’s even won the nomination, Clinton affirmed that she supports 
down-balloy Democrats.

“I’m already raising money for Democrats up and down the ballot - I’m 
dedicated to that,” Clinton said. “You can count on me doing that because I 
feel very strongly that we need to have a vital, dynamic Democratic party.”

“I wanna be a very strong ally of elected Democrats against the county,” she 
concluded.

Rachel Maddow asks about Charles Koch’s flirtation with endorsing Clinton: “If 
Mr. Trump or Senator Cruz is nominated, I think a lot of Republicans will find 
them to be unacceptable as Republican nominees.”

Will you lobby for Republican votes?

“I really am not looking for endorsements from people who deny climate change 
and have the views that the Koch brothers have had, so I’m going to stay 
focused on what I’m doing right now,” Clinton said.

Lambasting what she characterized as Bernie Sanders’ “Trump-like demagoguery,” 
Clinton criticized his plans on college debt for “the numbers not adding up.”

“It demonstrated that there weren’t a lot of answers to a lot of the hard 
questions that were asked on both foreign and domestic issues,” Clinton said, 
reminding voters of Sanders’ performance in an interview with the New York 
Daily News in which Sanders could not describe how he would break up large 
banks.

Rachel Maddow asks the former secretary of state whether there are 
“significant enough differences between you” andBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> that she would not be able 
to echo his positions and rhetoric on Wall Street during a general election.

“I have a bigger lead in pledged delegates than Senator Obama, when I ran 
against him in 2008, ever had over me,” Clinton said. “I am winning, and I am 
winning because of what I stand for and what I have done and what my ideas 
are,” Clinton continued. “My Wall Street plan is much more specific than his - 
we saw that when he couldn’t even answer that inthe Daily News interview. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/09/hillary-clinton-winning-bernie-sanders-supporters-campaign-jill-abramson>
”

“There are so many more areas where I am more specific,” Clinton concluded, 
“and I think that’s why I have more than 2.7 million votes more than he has.”

Hillary Clinton makes appearance on MSNBC town hall

After an introduction that called her “the GOP’s number-one target,” former 
secretary of stateHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> walked onstage at the 
National Constitution Center in Philadelphia to join Rachel Maddow for her half 
of the Democratic presidential town hall.

First question: How has Sanders influenced the Democratic party?

“I think that what weve had is a very spirited contest, certainly we share a 
lot of the same goals,” Clinton said. “But as I have said repeatedly, it’s not 
enough to diagnose the problem - you have to have solutions.”

“I think it’s because people want, not just to understand better what we think 
the problem is, but what are we gonna do about it?”

It was a slow day before the five-state marathon of the so-called “Acela 
primaries” in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland and Delaware 
tomorrow, where the respective Democratic and Republican frontrunners are 
expected to win the lion’s share of the delegates apportioned tomorrow - if not 
sweep all five states.

Ahead of tomorrow, here’s a rundown of the biggest stories from the campaign 
trail today:

 * The Koch brothers and their powerful Freedom Partners network, an 
organization that has given millions to Republican candidates, won’t be 
attending this year’s Republican National Convention. “Why go?” askedCharles 
Koch, in an interview with ABC News 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/charles-koch-skipping-convention-paul-ryan-gops-white/story?id=38633798>
. Koch noted his frustration at the remaining candidates and the vicious 
attacking nature of this election. “So we’ve tried to change that for the 
better, but we haven’t been successful,” the billionaire businessman told ABC 
News. Koch even said it was “possible” they would supportHillary Clinton, with 
Clinton quick to reject any theoretical endorsement from the powerful 
climate-change denying billionaires. 
 * Donald Trump released a statement decrying the new John Kasich/Ted Cruz 
alliance, and his argument of collusion is an interesting one: “Collusion is 
often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders 
have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive. They are mathematically 
dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how 
truly weak they and their campaigns are.” 
 * The digs by Trump against Kasich got particularly personal today, with a 
jab at how the Ohio governor eats: Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) 
Trump on John Kasich: "I have never seen a human being eat in such a 
disgusting fashion"pic.twitter.com/AA6PDq9Mn5 <https://t.co/AA6PDq9Mn5>

<https://twitter.com/JoePerticone/status/724655508972539905> 
 * A spokesperson for former Hewlett-Packard CEO and presidential candidate 
Carly Fiorina, the onetime presidential candidate, confirmed that she is being 
vetted by Cruz’s campaign as a potential running mate. “Normal stuff,” Sarah 
Isgur Flores said, which apparently include financial disclosures and meetings 
with campaign staffers. 
 * Megyn Kelly, the Fox News anchor and the only person to come out of this 
campaign with better approval ratings than before, has officially landed an 
interview with Donald Trump. “Mr Trump and I sat down together for a meeting 
earlier this month at my request,” Kelly said in a release sent out by the 
cable network. “He was gracious with his time and I asked him to consider an 
interview. I am happy to announce he has agreed, and I look forward to a 
fascinating exchange - our first sit-down interview together in nearly a year.” 
That’s it for political news tonight - tune in tomorrow for up-to-the-second 
updates on the primary campaign in the Northeast!
 
A man who was himself incarcerated in the 1990s asks about criminal justice 
reform: “If you’re elected president of the United States, are you willing to 
make billion-dollar investments in the lives and communities in the people 
whose lives were impacted by the 1994 crime bill?”

“The answer is yes,” Clinton said, saying that a billion-dollar investment in 
front-end solutions to keep young people - particularly racial minorities - 
outside of prison in the first place is needed. “We need to have a lot more 
done to try to release nonviolent offenders, low-level offenders, we need to 
get them out of our prisons and jails,” she said. “I want us to have the best 
programs funded from the federal level, that will enable young people to finish 
their education and get back into society.”
 
Hillary Clinton, on having a Trudeau-esque cabinet: 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/canada-cabinet-gender-diversity-justin-trudeau>

Well, I am going to have a cabinet that looks like America, and half of our 
country is women.
 
Next question from an undecided voter who just changed her voter to Clinton: 
“What does it mean to you to be a feminist?”

“Women deserve the same rights as men in every aspect of our economy and our 
society, here at home and around the world,” Clinton said, to applause. “We 
have to do everything we can - though laws, regulation, culture - to change the 
still-existing stereotypes that hold women back.”

“We have made progress, but we are still a long way from where we need to be. 
If you look at pay, for example - equal pay is still a problem,” Clinton 
continued. “This has pervasive effects on women’s lives, and their well-being, 
so I think we have to keep hammering the points.”

“We have to start early - because a lot of little girls as they become 
teenagers, they begin to suffer all of these pressures,” Clinton said. “Stop 
it! We need to build the confidence - both of girls and boys.”
 
Rachel Maddow asks Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> about “the greatest 
frustration of [Obama’s] administration” - gun violence.

“If we take back the Senate - which I believe we can, and you in Pennsylvania 
have a really good chance to help us do that - the Democrats have decided that 
they will be led by Chuck Schumer,” who Clinton says has proven himself an 
effective opponent of gun lobbyists.

“I am determined - we are going to save lives, and we are going to do it by 
taking on the gun lobby and implementing common-sense gun safety reform,” 
Clinton said, saying that part of the battle is fighting against gun culture, 
“and that’s going to take all of us. We’ve got to break the grip of gun culture 
in our young people.
 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, 
addressing a question about how her policy priorities would differ from those 
of Barack Obama, her former boss, pointed out issues relating to equal pay and 
early childhood education as examples.

“I agree with a lot of what President Obama has done, and I don’t think he 
gets the credit he deserves in the work he has done as president,” Clinton 
said. “I want to really make a big, big push on equal pay for women.

“I believe that if we start early and we are determined there, we can make a 
difference there. I want to make a push on early childhood education,” she 
continued. “I would make a big push for affordable college, debt-free tuition.”

Hall in Philadelphia. Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP 
Another question from the audience, from a Harlem native whose parents 
struggled with drug addiction. “What as president you would do to address the 
systemic racism that still exists and creates a glass ceiling?”

“We have to talk about it more - and as a white person, I have to talk about 
it more. And say that we are not a ‘post-racial’ society, and that we still 
struggle with racism,” Clinton said.

“It is not only wrong - it is holding us back,” Clinton continued. “We want as 
productive a society as possible, so we have to enforce the civil rights laws, 
we have to use the bully pulpit.”
 
First question from a volunteer councilman: “Will you say what role you would 
trust Senator Sanders in in a Clinton administration?”

After demuring that she can’t begin to speak to administration positions 
before she’s even won the nomination, Clinton affirmed that she supports 
down-balloy Democrats.

“I’m already raising money for Democrats up and down the ballot - I’m 
dedicated to that,” Clinton said. “You can count on me doing that because I 
feel very strongly that we need to have a vital, dynamic Democratic party.”

“I wanna be a very strong ally of elected Democrats against the county,” she 
concluded.
 
Rachel Maddow asks about Charles Koch’s flirtation with endorsing Clinton: “If 
Mr. Trump or Senator Cruz is nominated, I think a lot of Republicans will find 
them to be unacceptable as Republican nominees.”

Will you lobby for Republican votes?

“I really am not looking for endorsements from people who deny climate change 
and have the views that the Koch brothers have had, so I’m going to stay 
focused on what I’m doing right now,” Clinton said.

Lambasting what she characterized as Bernie Sanders’ “Trump-like demagoguery,” 
Clinton criticized his plans on college debt for “the numbers not adding up.”

“It demonstrated that there weren’t a lot of answers to a lot of the hard 
questions that were asked on both foreign and domestic issues,” Clinton said, 
reminding voters of Sanders’ performance in an interview with the New York 
Daily News in which Sanders could not describe how he would break up large 
banks.
 
Rachel Maddow asks the former secretary of state whether there are 
“significant enough differences between you” andBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> that she would not be able 
to echo his positions and rhetoric on Wall Street during a general election.

“I have a bigger lead in pledged delegates than Senator Obama, when I ran 
against him in 2008, ever had over me,” Clinton said. “I am winning, and I am 
winning because of what I stand for and what I have done and what my ideas 
are,” Clinton continued. “My Wall Street plan is much more specific than his - 
we saw that when he couldn’t even answer that inthe Daily News interview. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/09/hillary-clinton-winning-bernie-sanders-supporters-campaign-jill-abramson>
”

“There are so many more areas where I am more specific,” Clinton concluded, 
“and I think that’s why I have more than 2.7 million votes more than he has.”
 
After an introduction that called her “the GOP’s number-one target,” former 
secretary of stateHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> walked onstage at the 
National Constitution Center in Philadelphia to join Rachel Maddow for her half 
of the Democratic presidential town hall.

First question: How has Sanders influenced the Democratic party?

“I think that what weve had is a very spirited contest, certainly we share a 
lot of the same goals,” Clinton said. “But as I have said repeatedly, it’s not 
enough to diagnose the problem - you have to have solutions.”

“I think it’s because people want, not just to understand better what we think 
the problem is, but what are we gonna do about it?”
 
That’s it for Bernie Sanders’ segment on the MSNBC Democratic town hall - stay 
tuned for Hillary Clinton’s appearance on the special, which we’ll be 
liveblogging up to the minute!
