Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, is under growing pressure to refer 
Rupert Murdoch’s£11.2bn proposed bid for full control of television broadcaster 
Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/murdoch-sky-bid-schedule-of-agreement-shareholders>
 to the media watchdog, as MPs from all parties expressed concern about the 
deal in the House of Commons.


Labour, Conservative, SNP and Liberal Democrat MPs raised worries that the 
proposed takeover by Murdoch’s21st Century Fox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/21st-century-fox> could concentrate too much 
power in the hands of the media mogul, who already controls the Times and Sun 
newspapers via News Corp, as well as 39% of Sky.

Kevin Brennan, the shadow culture minister who secured an urgent question 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/12/murdoch-sky-bid-culture-secretary-to-answer-urgent-question>
, highlighted parliament’s opposition to a previous bid byMurdoch’s News Corp 
for BSkyB in 2011 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/13/rupert-murdoch-gives-up-bskyb-bid>
. He said little had changed since MPs passed a motion against the deal over 
“serious wrongdoing that was being uncovered in the phone-hacking scandal and 
the concentration of media power into fewer and fewer hands”.

He said MPs had not forgotten previous reservations about the deal and called 
on the government to confirm immediately that it would be referred to Ofcom.

Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, said the bid should be rejected 
outright. “Compared to five years ago when the House passed a unanimous motion 
saying the bid should not go ahead, we still have issues of phone hacking 
unresolved in the past and we still have a system of self-regulation that has 
not satisfied the victims of phone hacking,” he said.

“What has really changed since the House passed the motion five years ago? In 
my view, very little and that is why I believe this bid should be rejected.”

Few Conservative MPs attended the debate, but Peter Bone, a Tory backbencher, 
said there was “concern across the House about this issue” and urged ministers 
to keep parliament informed about their thinking.

John Whittingdale, the Conservative former culture secretary, sounded 
supportive of the deal, saying it was merely an investment decision for 
Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. But he argued that there was a strong case for 
Ofcom to examine the matter because of its importance.

He told the Guardian he would be astonished if Bradley did not refer the bid 
to Ofcom and the competition authorities.

“That’s what you have a regulator for. But my own view is that it’s unlikely 
to raise major concerns,” he said. “This is an investment rather than an 
acquisition. It will need to get looked at by Ofcom but the competition in that 
sector has increased since the last time it was looked at. I can’t see really 
where the objection lies.

“Given that a solution was found last time, I would be very surprised if there 
was any difficulty this time round. It is still a major issue in media policy, 
but I don’t think it will be as great a political issue as it was last time. 
But all the Murdoch haters will get worked up about it. Everyone thinks Murdoch 
runs Sky anyway.”

Ministers are declining to comment on the deal, but Bradley will have to take 
a quasi-judicial decision on whether to ask Ofcom for an adjudication within 10 
days of being formally notified of the proposal.

Matthew Hancock, Bradley’s deputy minister at the Department for Culture, 
Media and Sport, said he could only reassure MPs that the culture secretary was 
a fit and proper person to take her decision. He said officials would make sure 
that there were no conflicts of interest and that the decision was taken 
appropriately.

Downing Street declined to comment and is refusing to reveal whether Theresa 
May discussed the bid when she met Murdoch in New York in September.

Pressed twice about whether May discussed the takeover or any political 
support offered to her by Murdoch’s newspapers at the meeting, Hancock refused 
to answer.

When Vince Cable, the former business secretary, announced the public interest 
test for the 2011 bid, the Murdochs had agreed to spin off Sky News into a 
company with an independent editorial board.

But after it emerged that News of the World journalists had hacked into the 
phone of murdered teenager Milly Dowler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/04/milly-dowler-voicemail-hacked-news-of-world>
, Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem politicians agreed that a takeover could not 
proceed and the Murdochs withdrew their bid.

Years later, the failed deal returned to haunt David Cameron’s government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/31/jeremy-hunt-leveson-inquiry>, 
when questions arose during the Leveson inquiry about the extent to which 
ministers, including former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt, were lobbied by News 
Corp to let it go ahead.
