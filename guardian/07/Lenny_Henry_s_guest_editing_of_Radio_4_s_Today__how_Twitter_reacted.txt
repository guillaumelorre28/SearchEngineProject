The show was warmly received on Twitter by a number of media industry figures:

.@LennyHenry <https://twitter.com/LennyHenry> speaks of need to help working 
class diaspora: "We're not asking for a handout; we're asking for a leg up". 
True for women too

However, not everyone was so impressed:
Bonnie Greer (@Bonn1eGreer)

sure it was v. good. But the noblesse oblige of#r4today

While elsewhere on Twitter, the show prompted an entirely different response: 

Sathnam Sanghera (@Sathnam) 
People who say racism doesn't exist should search Lenny's name on Twitter RT 
@Holbornlolz <https://twitter.com/Holbornlolz> the sooner Lenny Henry gets 
Ebola, the better

Last word goes to the Daily Telegraph’s Luke McGee:
Luke McGee (@lukemcgee) 
Didn't hear Lenny Henry <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lenny-henry>. 
Fortunately I have a system for this: 1) Twitter search 2) are morons 
criticising it? I can see it was a triumph
