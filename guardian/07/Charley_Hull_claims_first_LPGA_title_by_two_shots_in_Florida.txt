Britain’s Charley Hull claimed her first LGPA Tour win with a two-shot victory 
at the CME Group Tour Championship in Florida.

The 20-year-old from Kettering started the final round with a one-shot lead 
over the American Brittany Lincicome and South Korea’s Ryu So-yeon and produced 
a brilliant, bogey-free 66 to finish on 19 under par at TiburonGolf

Hull had six birdies on the outward nine and three on the back nine en route 
to a new tournament scoring record, previously set last year by Cristie Kerr at 
17 under.

Hull and Ryu were locked together on 18 under with two holes to play, but a 
two-shot swing at the par-five 17th, where Hull rolled her approach up for 
birdie and Ryu found a greenside bunker and managed only a bogey, turned 
proceedings decisively in the Briton’s favour.

“Yeah, it’s a pretty cool feeling,” Hull said. “It hasn’t quite sunk in yet.”
