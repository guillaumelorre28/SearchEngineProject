It’s a terrible prospect, imagining a musical world without Pierre Boulez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/pierre-boulez>. And yet, thanks to his 
influence as composer, conductor and cultural leader; as polemicist, teacher 
and fiery spirit of avant-garde adventure; and later as a charming, but 
demanding, eminence grise of contemporary musical life, we don’t have to 
imagine it.

Boulez’s achievements in changing every part of the fabric of classical 
musical culture all over the world are indelible. In Bayreuth, where he 
transformed the performance practice of Wagner’s works. In London and New York, 
where in the 1970s he embarked on a mission to transform orchestral programmes 
and establish a performance practice for contemporary music. Or at the Lucerne 
festival, where he established the Lucerne Festival Academy to cement the 
repertoires of new music in the minds and hearts of some of the world’s most 
talented young musicians and coached the next generation of composers. Or in 
Paris, where so much of the city’s musical life is formed in the image of his 
sonic dreams: IRCAM, that place of electronic and acoustic musical 
experimentation whose underground bunkers you’ll have walked over if you’ve 
ever been to the Pompidou Museum – it’s right under theStravinsky Fountain 
<https://zurich1200fountains.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/stravinsky-fountain-ok.jpg>
; or the Ensemble Intercontemporain, his new-music ensemble that bears living, 
breathing testament to the power of his music in performance, and even the new
Philharmonie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2015/jan/15/la-philharmonie-de-paris-new-musical-social-future-paris>
, the latest result of Boulez’s cultural vision and powers of political 
persuasion.

But above all, there’s his music and his music-making, which will remain in 
the permanently inspirational present tense for all of us as listeners, 
performers and composers. Here’s my introduction to his musical world via 10 
key works.

1. Piano Sonata No 2 (1948)

Written in Boulez’s early 20s, in 1948, his second Piano Sonata simultaneously 
blows apart classical convention – sonata form, fugue – but creates its own 
monumental structure of irresistible intensity.

2. Le marteau san maître (1955)

The 1955 work that set the seal on Boulez’s reputation as the “lion flayed 
alive” – his teacher Olivier Messiaen’s description of him as a student – of 
the avant-garde. Yet this is music, we can now hear, that is as beguilingly, 
exotically beautiful as it full of explosive imagination.


3. Pli selon pli (1957-1962)

The ultimate version of Boulez’s Mallarmé cycle: music that’s by turns 
ravishing and revolutionary. At over an hour, it’s also his longest work.

4. Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna (1974-75)

Written in memory of his friend and collaborator, the great Italian composer 
and conductor.

Boulez’s most ambitious masterpiece of electronic and acoustic fusion, music 
that creates a new kind of cosmic resonance from its ensemble and their 
ethereally, electronically transformed sounds.

6. Notations (orchestrations) (1978/1984/1997)

These five orchestral expansions of Boulez’s early aphoristic piano pieces are 
among the most scintillating, gorgeous, and thrillingly dramatic pieces in his 
entire catalogue.

7. Dérive 2 (1988/2002/2006)

Recorded in 2012, Boulez’s performance with the Ensemble Intercontemporain 
creates a golden thread of connection through the gilded sonic labyrinth of 
Dérive 2.

8. Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen

Landmark in every sense, here is Boulez’s performance of Patrice Chéreau’s 
centenary production of the Ring Cycle that shocked and then seduced audiences 
at Bayreuth. Filmed in 1980, it’s still among the most searingly insightful 
readings of the cycle, musically and dramatically, ever performed.


9. Debussy: Pelléas et Mélisande

Another of the highlights of Boulez’s operatic career, this 1992 performance 
of Debussy’s Pelléas in Peter Stein’s production at Welsh NationalOpera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/opera> reveals the expressivity, focus, and 
clarity that Boulez brought to everything he conducted.

10. Debussy: Jeux

A brilliantly bizarre demonstration of Boulez’s virtuosity as a conductor: 
recorded in an earlier epoch, here he is conducting Debussy’s most enigmatic 
orchestral score from memory – and wearing shades … The work’s riddles are 
solved in this performance in a way you only rarely experience.
