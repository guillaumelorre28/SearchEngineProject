Closing summary

 * Nine severe flood warnings, 5o flood warnings and 65 flood alerts are still 
in place across England and Wales, days after Boxing Day downpours began 
swallowing towns across the north.

 * More stormy weather is forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday. National severe 
weather warnings <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/warnings> have 
already been issued for gales on Tuesday and heavy rain on Wednesday. 
 * David Cameron was forced to defend the government’s record on flood 
defences during a visit to York, where he was heckled by passers-by. The prime 
minister said: “We have to look at what’s happened in terms of the flooding, 
what flood defences have worked and the places where they haven’t worked well 
enough, and see if there’s more that we can do.” 
 * Northern newspapers and politicians accused the government of not doing 
enough to defend their communities, citing a “north-south divide” in investment 
in flood defences. Judith Blake, the council leader in Leeds, said: “I think 
there’s a real anger growing across the north about the fact that the cuts have 
been made to the flood defences.” 
 * Firefighters are pumping out water in Croston amid fears that a fresh river 
breach could lead to new floods.A statement published earlier on the service’s 
website says: “We have two fire engines, one command unit at the scene and at 
13:00 we sent our High Volume Pump from Burnley to the scene and asked the 
National Coordination Centre for another four high volume pumps from across the 
country.” 
 * David Rooke, the deputy chief executive of the Environment Agency, says 
there is a need for a complete rethink on flood defence, with more emphasis on 
resilience. He said properties will need solid floors, waterproof plaster and 
electrics up the wall, so people can get back into their homes and their 
businesses very quickly. Facebook

Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, has laid into 
the government’s treatment of fire and rescue services, whose members have paid 
a key role in the response to the flooding over the past few days.

In comments carried by PA, Wrack complained that the PM seemed “almost unable 
to mention the term ‘firefighters’ in his response to this,” despite their 
significant role.


The closure of fire stations was having a “big impact” on the safety of 
residents in emergency situations such as major floods, he said.

The FBU is calling for fire and rescue services to be centrally coordinated 
and for better investment in flood response resources, which have been 
stretched to the limit by the inundations across the north of England and Wales 
since Boxing Day. In a statement, Wrack said:

Firefighters and other public servants have been performing magnificently 
against these horrendous floods. A key part of this has been rescue and 
evacuation work and other assistance to communities directly hit.

Rescue from floods requires specialist training, resources and coordination. 
This is what has been provided from across the country of the past few days. 
The firefighters involved deserve the thanks of all our communities.

Wrack called for debate about future coordination for flood response, adding: 

Firefighters have been raising concerns about major flooding for almost a 
decade. The fire and rescue service is generally a local authority service and 
the government endlessly tells us that any decisions need to be taken locally. 
But floods on this scale are clearly not a local matter.

It’s all very well David Cameron calling Cobra meetings, but all too often 
these matters seem to be forgotten as soon as the flood waters subside. That’s 
simply not good enough, either for the communities affected or for those who 
are asked to deal with the fall-out.

The Environment Agency is warning that the village of Croston could face 
further flooding after a river south of the village “overwhelmed” defences, 
causing a “gap”,the BBC reports 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-35188995?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_lancashire&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=english_regions>

Flood risk manager Andy Brown told the Broadcaster they would be “coming up 
rapidly with an emergency plan” to carry out repairs.

The latest from the Environment Agency’s live flood warnings service 
<https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings> has nine severe 
flood warnings in place, 52 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, and 
69 flood alerts.

Separately, the agency’s flood warnings summary page 
<http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood/31618.aspx> has an interactive map 
showing that there is not one region in the whole of England and Wales that is 
not affected by at least a flood warning - although the Aglian and South East 
regions have just one apiece.

The good news is that 123 flood warnings are no longer in force, although with 
more wet weather expected on Tuesday and Wednesday 
<http://gu.com/p/4fcn6/stw#block-5681236fe4b02af5e6342dd5>, these could be 
transient reversals.

Lancashire fire and rescue are sending fire engines and pumps to deal with new 
river breaches in Croston.
BBC Lancashire (@BBCLancashire) 
As three severe flood warnings remain for Croston, @LancashireFRS 
<https://twitter.com/LancashireFRS> say they're sending fire engines and pumps 
to deal with new river breaches
 <https://twitter.com/BBCLancashire/status/681473296760737793> December 28, 
2015 <https://twitter.com/BBCLancashire/status/681473296760737793> 
A statement published earlier on the service’s website says: 

There have been two breaches in Croston; one on the River Douglas and one on 
Eller Brook. With the high tides and more significant rainfall expected over 
the next few days, we are working with the EA to pump water away from the 
Croston Moss, the flood plain.

We have two fire engines, one command unit at the scene and at 13:00 we sent 
our High Volume Pump from Burnley to the scene and asked the National 
Coordination Centre for another four high volume pumps from across the country.

Nigel Bunyan has sent this story about the “forgotten” village of Billington, 
which was overwhelmed by the Boxing Day floods. It is still a scene of 
devastation, he writes.

A giant skip has been placed strategically in the middle of Longworth Road so 
that villagers could dump their waterlogged, ruined possessions. There were 
lounge suites, sideboards, washing machines, driers, fridges and fridge 
freezers, as well as carpets, once-cherished pictures and somewhere at the 
bottom of the heap was the chair that had once belonged to Barbara Templeman’s 
father, Kenneth.

For 16 years Templeman, 63, had given it pride of place in the lounge of the 
two-bedroom terrace she shares with her husband, David, 69. But on Boxing Day, 
as the River Calder burst its banks and diverted through the street that has 
been her home since childhood, she had neither the strength nor the time to 
move it. By the time she returned the next morning it was ruined beyond repair.

“I wouldn’t let them take it away at first,” she said tearfully. “I just 
thought that somehow it might have been possible to restore it. But really, it 
was too badly damaged. Once this is over I’ll try to buy a new chair in dad’s 
memory. Until then I’ll try to shut it out of my mind.”

Like her neighbours, she has enough to think about. Around 70 of them, all 
from the same street beneath the Whalley Arches, near Clitheroe, Lancs, are 
without gas and proper sanitation. Insurance assessors have promised to make 
appearances on Tuesday, but until then many have no idea what to expect. Some 
have realised too late that they are uninsured for flood damage.

Further down the street from the Templemans, Mark Taylor, 33, an engineer, and 
his partner, Lisa Holdsworth, 28, a nursery nurse, thought they had sold their 
own £105,000 home. The contracts were signed a fortnight ago, and they and 
their daughters, Ellie-Mae, 10, and Caitlin, nine, were looking forward to 
moving to a new home in Clitheroe early in the New Year.

“We’ll never sell it now,” said Lisa, wiping tears from her eyes. “The kids 
had been so excited, we all had. We’ve lost everything we’ve been working for 
and towards for all these years.”

The Archbishop of York <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/york> has praised the 
“tremendous spirit” of everyone who has responded to the floods across northern 
England as the undercroft in his own palace was being pumped out. From PA.

In a statement, he said: “As expected, the undercroft in my home here at 
Bishopthorpe Palace is flooded again. We are fortunate however that back in the 
13th century they built with flooding in mind, such that when the water 
subsides it soon washes through the original flood drains made for the purpose. 
I am thankful for the foresight that went into planning all those years ago.

Besides the shock and danger of the floods themselves, for those flooded out, 
the drying time and clean-up period will be long, tedious, costly, and sheer 
hard work. It is no surprise, however, to see the people of York responding 
with tremendous spirit, resolve, and generosity, to the plight of their flooded 
neighbours at this time.

I know that a lot of work has gone into making more robust the flood defences 
in the City of York over recent years. It will be all the more disappointing to 
those who have laboured to achieve this that we have not been able to prevent 
another serious flood in our beloved city.”

Caroline Davies has more on Storm Frank, which is expected batter the north 
and west on Wednesday with heavy rain and gale-force winds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/28/storm-frank-heavy-rain-met-office-uk>
, including parts of northern England already hit by theBoxing Day floods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2015/dec/26/severe-flood-warnings-in-the-north-prompt-boxing-day-evacuation-fears>
.

The storm is the sixth to be named since the system of labelling storms 
expected to have significant impact was introduced in September.

Up to 80mm of rain is predicted to fall on high ground, and potentially in 
excess of 120mm in exposed areas, with large swaths of the UK seeing up to 40mm.

The Met Office issued yellow warnings for rain on Wednesday for north-west 
England, north-east England, Yorkshire and Humber, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
Amber warnings are in place for parts of central and southern Scotland. Another 
amber rain warning has been issued for parts of Cumbria, which experienced
severe flooding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/05/storm-desmond-severe-weather-scotland-northern-england>
 in early December.

risk of localised flooding in all parts of County Clare as a result of a 
combination of strong gale to storm force southerly winds, heavy rainfall, high 
tides and already saturated ground.

Mary Dejevsky

The Guardian’s Mary Dejevsky rejects the argument that the foreign aid budget 
should be raided for flood defences at home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/28/repair-flood-damage-raid-military-spending-foreign-aid-victims>
. The proportion of GDP the UK has earmarked for foreign aid spending may be 
higher than that allocated by many other countries, she notes, but it is still 
tiny in real terms. Much better to take money from the defence budget, she 
argues.

The army’s contribution this Christmas also raises another question: might the 
UK today benefit from a highly trained civilian Home Guard, part-professional, 
part-volunteer? Defence chiefs will no doubt say that the military is 
overstretched as it is. But the answer here should be obvious: less Syria; more

Sophie Heawood

Sophie Heawood ventured into York <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/york> to buy 
a laptop charger, but had trouble getting home.

Our house was still fine, being a good five roads beyond any burst riverbank 
(andYork <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/york> is built at the confluence of 
two rivers, so there is a lot of riverbank to go round), but I couldn’t get to 
it. The army had been evacuating families from the streets in between. People 
were starting to use words like levees, that I only knew from New Orleans. 
Then, like magic, a taxi appeared. The driver disregarded the police advice and 
took me a complicated different route in the opposite direction.

People were still queuing up to buy navy polo necks in the sales, as we made 
our getaway. Driving across a roundabout that was half flooded, with a TV crew 
set up filming. You could still drive over the other side of it – just. We 
drove past lakes that used to be playing fields, with people standing all 
around them, in the dark, back to a house where my mother had been baking 
loaves of bread for the first time in years, in case the food shops all closed. 
It felt like the quiet, unexpected beginnings of an apocalypse.

The Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, has laid into the prime minister for 
a “wholly inadequate response”.

David Cameron has today said on flood defences ‘Let’s have a look and see 
whether more needs to be done’. That is a wholly inadequate response to the 
massive disruption to communities, lives and economies, and a demonstration of 
the way this government has failed to respond to the reality and threats of a 
world now already living with one degree of warming above pre-industrial levels.

It has been clear since its election that this government hasn’t grasped the 
reality of the climate change we’re already experiencing – which the experts 
tell us will result in more extreme weather, and extremes happening more often.

We urgently need to not just consider flood defences, but land use across 
catchments, plus the protection of urban areas through sustainable drainage and 
similar management schemes, while ending the construction of new housing 
estates in vulnerable areas.

And we urgently need the government to adopt the policies that will ensure we 
play our part in restricting climate change to a total of 1.5 degrees warming.

Many of the areas affected by these floods are also facing the threat of 
fracking – as the government ploughs ahead with its hugely unpopular plans for 
allowing companies to seek more fossil fuels underneath our feet, while we know 
that we have to leave at least two thirds of our known fossil fuel reserves in 
the ground to avoid catastrophic climate change.

Damian Carrington

My colleague has been looking at the government’s record on flood defence 
spending.He finds it wanting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/28/flood-defences-row-uk-paying-price-david-cameron-tories-broken-promises?CMP=share_btn_tw>
, despite David Cameron’s protestations today.

Cameron cannot say he was not warned: he has ignored red flag after red flag, 
right from the start of his premiership. In the first year of the coalition, he 
cut capital spending on flood defencesby 27% year-on-year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/24/flood-defence-cuts-facts-spin>
. That was despite the2008 Pitt Review 
<https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwixvNy5oP7JAhUBbhoKHX2mAJoQFgggMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwebarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk%2F20100807034701%2Fhttp%3A%2Farchive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk%2Fpittreview%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fassets%2Fwww.cabinetoffice.gov.uk%2Fflooding_review%2Fpitt_review_full%2520pdf.pdf&usg=AFQjCNEkJJN2WvrLccFjzCfa_xUxGcd1Jw&sig2=nFaApyGcCWdheD4p-KJu9g>
 – a systematic analysis of major floods in 2007 – concluding that much more 
funding was needed. Funding had risen quickly under the Labour government, only 
to be slashed by Cameron.

The prime minister himself had expressed the risks. “Most people accept that, 
with climate change, [floods] are likely to be more frequent 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080507/halltext/80507h0009.htm>
,” he told parliament in May 2008, following flooding in his Oxfordshire 
constituency.

Flood defence spending never recovered to the level inherited from Labour 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/480527/Funding_for_Flood_and_Coastal_Erosion_in_England_Dec_2015.pdf>
 during the whole coalition parliament, if you exclude – as the National Audit 
Office deems appropriate – the emergency funding delivered after flooding 
2013-14.

The Yorkshire Evening Post fulminates against the government, arguing that it 
would never have allowed London or the south-east to be devastated by floods. 
It said in an editorial:

It remains the case that such events, like those witnessed in this city, are 
unthinkable in London and much of the South East, where state-of-the-art flood 
defences have long been in place.

The Yorkshire Post 
<http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/opinion/yp-comment-flooding-and-time-to-turn-political-tide-1-7644534>
 also brought up the north-south divide theme, when it accused the government 
of mouthing platitudes.

The prime minister repeatedly used the word ‘unprecedented’ to describe this 
winter’s storms. Yet every fortnight brings ‘unprecedented’ levels of new 
flooding and the same pious platitudes from politicians, like environment 
secretary Liz Truss, whose rhetoric is increasingly economical with the truth.

The north-south divide was also picked up by Judith Blake, the council leader 
inLeeds <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/leeds>, who said:


I think we’re beginning to feel that very strongly. At that time there were 
other flooding events in the north that didn’t get anywhere near the support 
that we saw going into Somerset.

David Cameron sought to deflect such criticisms when he visited York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/york>. The prime minister insisted that £100m 
had been spent in Yorkshire on flood defences since 2010 with plans to invest 
another £280m. He rejected allegations of a north-south divide in funding for 
flood defences.

That’s not the case. We spend more per head on flood defences in the north of 
England than we do in the south of England, and here in Yorkshire we are almost 
trebling the amount we will be spending in the current parliament. What matters 
is that we spend the right amount in the right places, and that’s what our 
review will make sure is happening.”

close  
 * Nine severe flood warnings, 5o flood warnings and 65 flood alerts are still 
in place across England and Wales, days after Boxing Day downpours began 
swallowing towns across the north.

 * More stormy weather is forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday. National severe 
weather warnings <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/warnings> have 
already been issued for gales on Tuesday and heavy rain on Wednesday. 
 * David Cameron was forced to defend the government’s record on flood 
defences during a visit to York, where he was heckled by passers-by. The prime 
minister said: “We have to look at what’s happened in terms of the flooding, 
what flood defences have worked and the places where they haven’t worked well 
enough, and see if there’s more that we can do.” 
 * Northern newspapers and politicians accused the government of not doing 
enough to defend their communities, citing a “north-south divide” in investment 
in flood defences. Judith Blake, the council leader in Leeds, said: “I think 
there’s a real anger growing across the north about the fact that the cuts have 
been made to the flood defences.” 
 * Firefighters are pumping out water in Croston amid fears that a fresh river 
breach could lead to new floods.A statement published earlier on the service’s 
website says: “We have two fire engines, one command unit at the scene and at 
13:00 we sent our High Volume Pump from Burnley to the scene and asked the 
National Coordination Centre for another four high volume pumps from across the 
country.” 
 * David Rooke, the deputy chief executive of the Environment Agency, says 
there is a need for a complete rethink on flood defence, with more emphasis on 
resilience. He said properties will need solid floors, waterproof plaster and 
electrics up the wall, so people can get back into their homes and their 
businesses very quickly.  
Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, has laid into 
the government’s treatment of fire and rescue services, whose members have paid 
a key role in the response to the flooding over the past few days.

In comments carried by PA, Wrack complained that the PM seemed “almost unable 
to mention the term ‘firefighters’ in his response to this,” despite their 
significant role.


The closure of fire stations was having a “big impact” on the safety of 
residents in emergency situations such as major floods, he said.

The FBU is calling for fire and rescue services to be centrally coordinated 
and for better investment in flood response resources, which have been 
stretched to the limit by the inundations across the north of England and Wales 
since Boxing Day. In a statement, Wrack said:

Firefighters and other public servants have been performing magnificently 
against these horrendous floods. A key part of this has been rescue and 
evacuation work and other assistance to communities directly hit.

Rescue from floods requires specialist training, resources and coordination. 
This is what has been provided from across the country of the past few days. 
The firefighters involved deserve the thanks of all our communities.

Wrack called for debate about future coordination for flood response, adding: 

Firefighters have been raising concerns about major flooding for almost a 
decade. The fire and rescue service is generally a local authority service and 
the government endlessly tells us that any decisions need to be taken locally. 
But floods on this scale are clearly not a local matter.

It’s all very well David Cameron calling Cobra meetings, but all too often 
these matters seem to be forgotten as soon as the flood waters subside. That’s 
simply not good enough, either for the communities affected or for those who 
are asked to deal with the fall-out.
 
The Environment Agency is warning that the village of Croston could face 
further flooding after a river south of the village “overwhelmed” defences, 
causing a “gap”,the BBC reports 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-35188995?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_lancashire&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=english_regions>
.

Flood risk manager Andy Brown told the Broadcaster they would be “coming up 
rapidly with an emergency plan” to carry out repairs.
 
The latest from the Environment Agency’s live flood warnings service 
<https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings> has nine severe 
flood warnings in place, 52 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, and 
69 flood alerts.

Separately, the agency’s flood warnings summary page 
<http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood/31618.aspx> has an interactive map 
showing that there is not one region in the whole of England and Wales that is 
not affected by at least a flood warning - although the Aglian and South East 
regions have just one apiece.

The good news is that 123 flood warnings are no longer in force, although with 
more wet weather expected on Tuesday and Wednesday 
<http://gu.com/p/4fcn6/stw#block-5681236fe4b02af5e6342dd5>, these could be 
transient reversals.

A statement published earlier on the service’s website says: 

There have been two breaches in Croston; one on the River Douglas and one on 
Eller Brook. With the high tides and more significant rainfall expected over 
the next few days, we are working with the EA to pump water away from the 
Croston Moss, the flood plain.

We have two fire engines, one command unit at the scene and at 13:00 we sent 
our High Volume Pump from Burnley to the scene and asked the National 
Coordination Centre for another four high volume pumps from across the country.
 
Nigel Bunyan has sent this story about the “forgotten” village of Billington, 
which was overwhelmed by the Boxing Day floods. It is still a scene of 
devastation, he writes.

A giant skip has been placed strategically in the middle of Longworth Road so 
that villagers could dump their waterlogged, ruined possessions. There were 
lounge suites, sideboards, washing machines, driers, fridges and fridge 
freezers, as well as carpets, once-cherished pictures and somewhere at the 
bottom of the heap was the chair that had once belonged to Barbara Templeman’s 
father, Kenneth.

For 16 years Templeman, 63, had given it pride of place in the lounge of the 
two-bedroom terrace she shares with her husband, David, 69. But on Boxing Day, 
as the River Calder burst its banks and diverted through the street that has 
been her home since childhood, she had neither the strength nor the time to 
move it. By the time she returned the next morning it was ruined beyond repair.

“I wouldn’t let them take it away at first,” she said tearfully. “I just 
thought that somehow it might have been possible to restore it. But really, it 
was too badly damaged. Once this is over I’ll try to buy a new chair in dad’s 
memory. Until then I’ll try to shut it out of my mind.”

Like her neighbours, she has enough to think about. Around 70 of them, all 
from the same street beneath the Whalley Arches, near Clitheroe, Lancs, are 
without gas and proper sanitation. Insurance assessors have promised to make 
appearances on Tuesday, but until then many have no idea what to expect. Some 
have realised too late that they are uninsured for flood damage.

Further down the street from the Templemans, Mark Taylor, 33, an engineer, and 
his partner, Lisa Holdsworth, 28, a nursery nurse, thought they had sold their 
own £105,000 home. The contracts were signed a fortnight ago, and they and 
their daughters, Ellie-Mae, 10, and Caitlin, nine, were looking forward to 
moving to a new home in Clitheroe early in the New Year.

“We’ll never sell it now,” said Lisa, wiping tears from her eyes. “The kids 
had been so excited, we all had. We’ve lost everything we’ve been working for 
and towards for all these years.”
 
The Archbishop of York <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/york> has praised the 
“tremendous spirit” of everyone who has responded to the floods across northern 
England as the undercroft in his own palace was being pumped out. From PA.

In a statement, he said: “As expected, the undercroft in my home here at 
Bishopthorpe Palace is flooded again. We are fortunate however that back in the 
13th century they built with flooding in mind, such that when the water 
subsides it soon washes through the original flood drains made for the purpose. 
I am thankful for the foresight that went into planning all those years ago.

Besides the shock and danger of the floods themselves, for those flooded out, 
the drying time and clean-up period will be long, tedious, costly, and sheer 
hard work. It is no surprise, however, to see the people of York responding 
with tremendous spirit, resolve, and generosity, to the plight of their flooded 
neighbours at this time.

I know that a lot of work has gone into making more robust the flood defences 
in the City of York over recent years. It will be all the more disappointing to 
those who have laboured to achieve this that we have not been able to prevent 
another serious flood in our beloved city.”

Caroline Davies has more on Storm Frank, which is expected batter the north 
and west on Wednesday with heavy rain and gale-force winds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/28/storm-frank-heavy-rain-met-office-uk>
, including parts of northern England already hit by theBoxing Day floods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2015/dec/26/severe-flood-warnings-in-the-north-prompt-boxing-day-evacuation-fears>
.

The storm is the sixth to be named since the system of labelling storms 
expected to have significant impact was introduced in September.

Up to 80mm of rain is predicted to fall on high ground, and potentially in 
excess of 120mm in exposed areas, with large swaths of the UK seeing up to 40mm.

The Met Office issued yellow warnings for rain on Wednesday for north-west 
England, north-east England, Yorkshire and Humber, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
Amber warnings are in place for parts of central and southern Scotland. Another 
amber rain warning has been issued for parts of Cumbria, which experienced
severe flooding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/05/storm-desmond-severe-weather-scotland-northern-england>
 in early December.
 
In Ireland, ahead of Storm Frank, residents are being warned of a significant 
risk of localised flooding in all parts of County Clare as a result of a 
combination of strong gale to storm force southerly winds, heavy rainfall, high 
tides and already saturated ground.

The Guardian’s Mary Dejevsky rejects the argument that the foreign aid budget 
should be raided for flood defences at home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/28/repair-flood-damage-raid-military-spending-foreign-aid-victims>
. The proportion of GDP the UK has earmarked for foreign aid spending may be 
higher than that allocated by many other countries, she notes, but it is still 
tiny in real terms. Much better to take money from the defence budget, she 
argues.

The army’s contribution this Christmas also raises another question: might the 
UK today benefit from a highly trained civilian Home Guard, part-professional, 
part-volunteer? Defence chiefs will no doubt say that the military is 
overstretched as it is. But the answer here should be obvious: less Syria; more 
Kendal and Hebden Bridge.

Sophie Heawood ventured into York <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/york> to buy 
a laptop charger, but had trouble getting home.

Our house was still fine, being a good five roads beyond any burst riverbank 
(andYork <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/york> is built at the confluence of 
two rivers, so there is a lot of riverbank to go round), but I couldn’t get to 
it. The army had been evacuating families from the streets in between. People 
were starting to use words like levees, that I only knew from New Orleans. 
Then, like magic, a taxi appeared. The driver disregarded the police advice and 
took me a complicated different route in the opposite direction.

People were still queuing up to buy navy polo necks in the sales, as we made 
our getaway. Driving across a roundabout that was half flooded, with a TV crew 
set up filming. You could still drive over the other side of it – just. We 
drove past lakes that used to be playing fields, with people standing all 
around them, in the dark, back to a house where my mother had been baking 
loaves of bread for the first time in years, in case the food shops all closed. 
It felt like the quiet, unexpected beginnings of an apocalypse.

 
The Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, has laid into the prime minister for 
a “wholly inadequate response”.

David Cameron has today said on flood defences ‘Let’s have a look and see 
whether more needs to be done’. That is a wholly inadequate response to the 
massive disruption to communities, lives and economies, and a demonstration of 
the way this government has failed to respond to the reality and threats of a 
world now already living with one degree of warming above pre-industrial levels.

It has been clear since its election that this government hasn’t grasped the 
reality of the climate change we’re already experiencing – which the experts 
tell us will result in more extreme weather, and extremes happening more often.

We urgently need to not just consider flood defences, but land use across 
catchments, plus the protection of urban areas through sustainable drainage and 
similar management schemes, while ending the construction of new housing 
estates in vulnerable areas.

And we urgently need the government to adopt the policies that will ensure we 
play our part in restricting climate change to a total of 1.5 degrees warming.

Many of the areas affected by these floods are also facing the threat of 
fracking – as the government ploughs ahead with its hugely unpopular plans for 
allowing companies to seek more fossil fuels underneath our feet, while we know 
that we have to leave at least two thirds of our known fossil fuel reserves in 
the ground to avoid catastrophic climate change.
 
My colleague has been looking at the government’s record on flood defence 
spending.He finds it wanting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/28/flood-defences-row-uk-paying-price-david-cameron-tories-broken-promises?CMP=share_btn_tw>
, despite David Cameron’s protestations today.

Cameron cannot say he was not warned: he has ignored red flag after red flag, 
right from the start of his premiership. In the first year of the coalition, he 
cut capital spending on flood defencesby 27% year-on-year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/24/flood-defence-cuts-facts-spin>
. That was despite the2008 Pitt Review 
<https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwixvNy5oP7JAhUBbhoKHX2mAJoQFgggMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwebarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk%2F20100807034701%2Fhttp%3A%2Farchive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk%2Fpittreview%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fassets%2Fwww.cabinetoffice.gov.uk%2Fflooding_review%2Fpitt_review_full%2520pdf.pdf&usg=AFQjCNEkJJN2WvrLccFjzCfa_xUxGcd1Jw&sig2=nFaApyGcCWdheD4p-KJu9g>
 – a systematic analysis of major floods in 2007 – concluding that much more 
funding was needed. Funding had risen quickly under the Labour government, only 
to be slashed by Cameron.

The prime minister himself had expressed the risks. “Most people accept that, 
with climate change, [floods] are likely to be more frequent 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080507/halltext/80507h0009.htm>
,” he told parliament in May 2008, following flooding in his Oxfordshire 
constituency.

Flood defence spending never recovered to the level inherited from Labour 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/480527/Funding_for_Flood_and_Coastal_Erosion_in_England_Dec_2015.pdf>
 during the whole coalition parliament, if you exclude – as the National Audit 
Office deems appropriate – the emergency funding delivered after flooding 
2013-14.
 
The Yorkshire Evening Post fulminates against the government, arguing that it 
would never have allowed London or the south-east to be devastated by floods. 
It said in an editorial:

It remains the case that such events, like those witnessed in this city, are 
unthinkable in London and much of the South East, where state-of-the-art flood 
defences have long been in place.

The Yorkshire Post 
<http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/opinion/yp-comment-flooding-and-time-to-turn-political-tide-1-7644534>
 also brought up the north-south divide theme, when it accused the government 
of mouthing platitudes.

The prime minister repeatedly used the word ‘unprecedented’ to describe this 
winter’s storms. Yet every fortnight brings ‘unprecedented’ levels of new 
flooding and the same pious platitudes from politicians, like environment 
secretary Liz Truss, whose rhetoric is increasingly economical with the truth.

The north-south divide was also picked up by Judith Blake, the council leader 
inLeeds <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/leeds>, who said:


I think we’re beginning to feel that very strongly. At that time there were 
other flooding events in the north that didn’t get anywhere near the support 
that we saw going into Somerset.

David Cameron sought to deflect such criticisms when he visited York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/york>. The prime minister insisted that £100m 
had been spent in Yorkshire on flood defences since 2010 with plans to invest 
another £280m. He rejected allegations of a north-south divide in funding for 
flood defences.

That’s not the case. We spend more per head on flood defences in the north of 
England than we do in the south of England, and here in Yorkshire we are almost 
trebling the amount we will be spending in the current parliament. What matters 
is that we spend the right amount in the right places, and that’s what our 
review will make sure is happening.”
