Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/daniel-ortega> has been re-elected by a 
landslide in an election described by the opposition as the most rigged contest 
in the four decades since the Sandinista leader first came to power.

His victory – alongside his wife, Rosario Murillo, who was standing as 
vice-president for the first time

 – extends the influence of the first couple, whose children and in-laws also 
control many key posts in government and business.

Ortega won a third consecutive term (and fourth in total) with 72.1% of the 
vote, after 66.3% of polling stations were counted, the electoral board said.

Ortega’s main opponent, the center-right Liberal Constitutionalist party (PLC) 
candidate Maximino Rodríguez, was a distant second with 14.2% of the vote, the 
board said.

In protest against what they said was the absence of a fair contest, many 
among the Independent Liberal party and its allies called for voters to boycott 
the poll.

Roberto Rivas, the chief of the Supreme Electoral Council, said about 66% of 
Nicaragua’s 3.8 million registered voters had participated. But the main 
opposition movement, the Broad Front for Democracy, estimated more than 70% of 
voters had abstained.

“I don’t think it’s worth voting and wasting time, because it’s already 
fixed,” Glenda Bendana, an appliance sales executive in a Managua shopping 
mall, told the Associated Press. “Here they have taken away not our right to 
vote, but to choose. Ortega wants to die in power and leave his wife to take 
his place.”


The Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) candidate benefitted from 
strong economic growth in recent years, largely without the high levels of 
crime suffered by its Central American neighbours.


Government social programmes have helped reduce poverty by almost 13 
percentage points – and cemented popular support among poorer Nicaraguans.

“I’m euphoric, thanking God for this opportunity, this triumph, so the people 
continue to reap benefits,” said Ana Luisa Báez, 55, told Reuters.

But opposition leaders said the election was flawed because Ortega used his 
power over the courts to bypass constitutional term limits and prevent his most 
popular rivals from standing. Several candidates resigned in protest at the 
skewed number of polling station monitors.

In July, Nicaragua’s Supreme Electoral Council in effect decimated the 
opposition by ousting Eduardo Montealegre as leader of the main opposition 
party, the Independent Liberation party (PLI) – and then suspending almost all 
its members for refusing to recognize a new party leader named as head of the 
opposition by the supreme court.

Other parties in the coalition had already been stripped of their legal status 
by judges and electoral officials allegedly controlled by Ortega’s government.

“Ortega gets his way and he doesn’t care if he violates the rights of others,” 
Rodríguez told Reuters.

“Supposedly he fought against the Somoza dictatorship, and the Sandinistas 
themselves regard Ortega as worse than Somoza.”

A team of independent observers from the Organisation of American States is 
due to make a report on the election in six months’ time – too late to affect 
the outcome.

The US government said it was “deeply concerned” by the electoral process, and 
accused the FSLN government of sidelining opposition candidates and limiting 
poll monitors.

“The United States is deeply concerned by the flawed presidential and 
legislative electoral process inNicaragua 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicaragua>, which precluded the possibility 
of a free and fair election,” spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement.

The result allows the first couple to push ahead with policies that mix the 
traditional leftwing values of the FSLN – such as free healthcare and education 
– with an increasingly pro-business and pro-church stance.

In recent years this has been effective for the economy, which has been 
growing at an annual rate of nearly 5%, although Nicaragua remains one of the 
poorest countries in Latin America.

Key questions facing the first couple in the coming term will be whether to 
push ahead with plans for a Chinese-built and -funded interoceanic canal, how 
to offset declining financial support from crisis-hit Venezuela, and whether a 
new US president will support congressional moves to punish Nicaragua for its 
allegedly undemocratic elections and increasing ties with Russia.


 “The lack of Venezuelan support, the international price of oil, the price of 
our exports and the possibility that (US legislation passes) makes it a more 
complicated outlook for the Ortega in the next term,” said Oscar Rene Vargas, a 
sociologist and economist at Central American University.
