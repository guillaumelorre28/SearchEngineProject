See you next week!

Matthew Holmes

Thanks for all your contributions today: we’re just searching for your secrets 
to happiness in the comments (some genuinely good advice in there) as many 
colleagues appear to scramble around for the last things they need to do in the 
office before seeking the same at the pub. Not sure how successful that ever 
is, but there you go. We also enjoyed working with some of the suggestions 
you’ve been sending, so feel free to keep on doing so at 
matthew.holmes@theguardian.com or sarah.marsh@theguardian.com


We’ll leave you with this rallying call, which I’m 100% sure is absolutely 
truthful and accurate.

I spend most of my Friday afternoons reading the comments on this. So much so, 
I sometimes have to work Saturday morning to finish the work I am meant to do 
today.

This means I can't have a proper Friday night session, which I guess is better 
for my health.

Join the debate! Become fitter, happier?, wealthier.

Have a great weekend.

A dog's life in the comments? No way

Guardian readers

Each week we ask our team of moderators to flag up some of the comment threads 
they’ve really enjoyed reading, and this week the first of their highlights is 
an Opinion piece about dogs who can understand their owners.


Science confirms: dogs understand us. But do we get them too? | Anna

"It’s great to know that dogs are able to understand us, but we need to learn 
to understand them better. One of the deepest joys of dog ownership has been 
learning about my dog, getting to know her personality quirks and funny little 
ticks."
Brilliant. As an animal lover I couldn't agree with you more. 
Understanding (even among humans) is a tricky concept. The philosopher 
Wittgenstein once said that if a lion could talk we wouldn't understand him. 
Rarely wrong, he was quite wrong about that one. Animals do talk and we can and 
do understand them, though they do not of course express themselves in human 
language.  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15353561> greg2644

I'm diagnosed with major depression, and when I'm going through a major 
depressive episode, my boxer Gracie will never leave my side without me asking 
her to be near me in any way. Then when I bounce back from it after several 
weeks, she lays off and knows that I'm okay. I've had her for 8 years, so we 
know each other very very well. These animals are truly remarkable friends.

I think you learn a bit more about them with every successive dog. Having made 
the mistake of not teaching previous dogs some of the basics (socialisation, 
recall, lead-walking, etc., I'm in my sixties now and I'm proud of our two 
current dogs. I'll have it mastered just before I pop my clogs!

Readers on their best friends

Matthew Holmes

On the subject of happiness and how you can make yourself happy the topic of 
friendship just came up:
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12628138> WhistlingNeil

Three things for a happy life: 

Good friends, stoicism and chocolate. 

Mainly chocolate.

One of my favourite stories to work on this week was a piece on that very 
subject (not chocolate, alas ... ).

We asked you to share stories of the relationships that you’ve kept throughout 
life’s ups and downs aftera magazine feature on the same topic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/20/friendships-that-last-forever>
, resulting in readers sharing some really moving stories.

Have a read at the link above. You also shared more tales in the comments, 
which were a joy to read, despite what one reader’s reaction on Twitter might 
tell you ...

Here are a few of those additional stories: 


‘Twenty seven years later they are still my closest friends’

I have two best friends, and I met them within the same week twenty seven 
years ago when I was twenty years old. I had dropped out of first year 
university a year earlier, due to family issues resulting in acute depression 
and anxiety. When I returned I felt odd being 'a year behind' and wondered if I 
was going to feel even lonelier than I had before I dropped out. Instead I met 
one friend in a radio class, and the other when my boyfriend came home and told 
me 'I just met someone at uni today who I think you might really like.' Within 
minutes of meeting each of them I felt as though I had met my soul mate. Twenty 
seven years later they are still my closest friends, their children are my 
godchildren and my son is their godchild. I can't imagine how my life would 
have been without them.

‘We’d been everything to each other since high school’

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82163011> 
I lost my best friend this year. We'd been everything to each other since high 
school. No matter where I was in the world, I could count on Joe to come 
running if I needed him. He was there for me through drug rehab, I was there 
for him through his HIV diagnosis, and all the other horrible curves life tends 
to throw. The realization that he's not here anymore hits me every so often. 
It's not enough to "remember the good times", as people love to tell me. 
Because we're too young to have the good times stop and exist only in memory.

I suppose it's strange that I'm writing this on a news site to a bunch of 
faceless internet folk. So I'll tip out a bit of my coffee in memory of Joe. 
Even though he hated coffee. And news sites.

‘We had no common ground. Now I can’t imagine my life without her’
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14564634> Alys Courtney  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14564634> 29 August 2016 12:17am 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82074441> 
I didn't meet my soul mate and best friend until I was 27, ten years ago. We 
had no common ground. Now I can't imagine my life without her. The first thing 
we do every morning is text to see how we've slept and wish each other a good 
day. We're there for each other rain or shine, loving and laughing through the 
good times and crying together when things are tough. I am so lucky, every day 
I'm grateful that we found one another. My life would be much much poorer 
without her.

Anyway – I’d urge you to go and have a look! Do share your stories, too.

How do you lead a happy life?

Mark Rice-Oxley

How do you lead a happy life? Yep, it’s a heavy question for a Friday 
afternoon, so Guardian Live shrewdly scheduledtheir event on this elusive 
subject on Thursday evening 
<https://membership.theguardian.com/event/utopia-2016-how-to-live-a-happy-life-26076096306>
 at Somerset House.

Now then, there are a lot of answers to that question that might seem 
appropriate this week, such as “don’tcommute on Southern Trains 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/sep/02/morning-commute-on-southern-rail-live>
” or “try not to end up as thepresident of Uzbekistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/uzbekistan-uncertainty-death-dictator-islam-karimov>
.”

But as I met my fellow panellists Vanessa King, Ruth Whippman and Dawn Foster, 
it did occur to me that one way to lead a happy life might be to avoid being 
stuck in a stuffy basement room on a glorious evening in early autumn listening 
to writers talk about how to lead a happy life.

Still, members, readers and general interlopers seemed, well, happy to be 
there. Whippman is amusing when describing the brutally earnest quest for 
happiness in America which paradoxically seems to be making everyone more 
miserable. King is good at the importance of emotional intelligence and 
self-knowledge. Foster chaired deftly with her customary deadpan delivery.


Once Guardian members and readers got stuck in during the Q and A however, it 
quickly became apparent that happiness is like beauty – in the eye of the 
beholder. Different strokes etc. It’s down to your parents, your freedom from 
psychological oppression, your upbringing, your emotional security, your 
self-esteem, your life choices, your talent fulfilment, the recognition of your 
intrinsic worth. Poverty can make you miserable, but money won’t necessarily 
make you happy.

So come on readers, get stuck in: what three qualities make for a happy life. 
Other than the Guardian’s website?

Astronaut coffee and DIY heart surgery – Designs of the Year

The Design Museum’s Designs of the Year shortlist was announced this week  
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/31/beazley-designs-of-the-year-design-museum-london>
, featuring everything from acoffee cup for astronauts 
<https://www.wired.com/2015/01/coffee-cup-designed-let-astronauts-sip-espresso-space/>
 to aflat-pack refugee shelter made by Ikea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jul/02/ikea-flatpack-refugee-shelter>
. Once again, there was a big emphasis on the much-heralded “maker movement”, 
with many projects trumpeting their open source credentials and claiming to 
“disrupt” the usual supply chain of designer-manufactuer-consumer. But does 
this vision of mass armies of garden shed hobbyists, with access to laser 
cutters and 3D-printers, and the DIY know-how to assemble things, actually ring 
true? Are you an aspiring maker? Do you actually want to customise your own 
clothes on demand? Or is this vision of a culture of democratic, localised and 
bespoke making all just hype?

Guardian readers

Stephen Merchant wouldn’t be the choice of many of you for host of the new 
Crystal Maze.

I'm disappointed that Stephen Merchant is the Mazemaster for the new Crystal 
Maze - not only because there have been some very talented young actors and 
comedians playing the part on the Crystal Maze live shows for whom it could 
have been a big break, but also because he just doesn't fit the bill for me, 
and that worries me as regards the direction of the show overall.

Stephen Merchant's strengths are in being an everyman. An awkward, nerdy 
everyman, but an everyman - he's a relateable character. The Mazemaster should 
be an eccentric, mischievous and somewhat otherworldly. He shouldn't feel like 
someone you might bump into in the staff canteen.

How about Rentaghost :-)

It used to make me cringe in embarrassment at being human.

On a more serious note how about Arabian Knights... "size of a mouse". 
Actually why not bring back the whole of Banana Splits? Tra la la...

The Crystal Maze is set to make a come-back. What else should return?

Knightmare.

No modernisation, no reboot - same format, same characters, same graphics, 
same helmet, same everything.

And, going full circle:

Parenting moral dilemma of the week

Martin Belam

I had the afternoon off yesterday, and asked my three-year-old boy James what 
he wanted to do together. “Play Pokémon” was his request. So that’s what we 
did. It’s left me wondering whether I did the right thing though.

We played Pokémon Go for a good couple of hours. We spent about an hour of 
that walking through a forest and by a lake, and we spotted ladybirds and holly 
bushes, and got some fresh air and exercise, and it was an outdoor activity. 
But we still spent a lot of of that time with our eyes glued to a screen.

He’s suddenly become absolutely obsessed with it. He knows all the names, he’s 
constantly asking his mum to message me when I’m at work to ask a question 
about a particular Pokémon type, or to see if I’ve caught any new ones. It’s 
amazing the facts and figures their little minds can hoover up and memorise if 
they are really interested in something.

But are games like that something a three-year-old should be playing? Should I 
have done something more traditional with him instead? If we’d done the walk in 
the woods as an activity in its own right, I’m not sure his attention on it 
would have lasted that long.

His older sister, Emma, is six. She’s already fantastically adept at using 
computers and typing, I think in part that is through having played games on 
smartphones and the iPad when she was younger. Those seem to me to be useful 
life skills to learn. But what do you think?

The Crystal Maze is set to make a come-back. What else should return?

Sarah Marsh

It was announced this week that The Crystal Maze set to return to TV after 21 
years – what other shows would you like to bring back? My list would be:

 * Charlie’s Angels 
 * Sunset Beach 
 * Sister Sister  Stephen Merchant – pictured here in 2006 at a grey-looking 
office building in Farringdon, London – will present the new Crystal Maze.

As well as this, we heard of the must-see autumn TV

Here’s one especially for one reader both on the subject of Instagram and 
their interest in “ISS and Hubble telescope stuff”.

I left Facebook for several reasons and one of the annoyances was people 
tagging themselves throughout the day and then posting their dinner at some 
point. Tagging used to be a punishment for criminals!

Anyway, found I still had an Instagram account which is a much friendlier 
platform. So far so good, no food shots unless I go looking for them. I do have 
a minute following so far though and enjoy the Nat Geo, ISS and Hubble 
telescope stuff.

I am guilty of sending WhatsApp pictures of pints to mates when they're at 
work and I'm in pub.

So it’s not all what we had for lunch ... you can follow the Guardian on 
Instagram <https://www.instagram.com/guardian/?hl=en> for more like this.

Yes, Instagram really does get you talking. Here are some more of your 
comments:

The point of Instagram, or anything like it, is that it's user-submitted, it 
is what you make of it. When I first signed up, I joked that I'd just use it to 
take "arty" photos of mundane food; microwave pasta, or some toast, or a Pot 
Noodle or whatever, as I never really got the fuss over "Instagramming" your 
meal unless, say, you run a business selling food and it might make you a few 
quid to show it off.

But what I realised when I started using Instagram is that, unless you want to 
tag every post with a million hashtags to chase likes/followers, it's best use 
is just posting stuff to amuse your mates, or to amuse yourself. And if photos 
of food are part of that, more power to you.

I like instagram, from a sport or hobby point of view it is really great at 
connecting you with people who may have similar, but niche interests.

For food though it seems bizarre, the focus tends to be on decadence or size 
rather than taste. ie, am I ordering a 'freakshake' because it tastes amazing 
or just because it will look good on social?

When your enjoyment is defined by social envy then it has gone too far

Question of the week: what should Brexit look like?

Sarah Marsh

British prime minister Theresa May has said that “Brexit means Brexit”, and 
that the government must push ahead with plans for Britain to leave the 
European Union (EU). But, in an ideal world, what would our new relationship 
withEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> look like?

We discussed this question on Thursday – catch up on our discussion here and 
share more comments below the line

'Posting pictures of your food on Instagram is really annoying'

Guardian readers

You shared your views on Instagram below the line, and whether it’s changing 
our relationship with food. Some people were less than impressed by those who 
document meals in picture form:

Is Instagram changing our relationship with food?

No.

Instagram is changing peoples relationship with the rest of the world by 
turning them into narcissistic self absorbed tw*ts who can only communicate 
through a pictorial reference to some trivial facet of their unimportant lives.

The definition of a pointless 1st world life is surely trying to validate your 
existence through a picture of a dessert.

Pretty much everyone I know thinks posting pictures of your food on Instagram 
is really annoying and a pointless waste of time - unless it's something truly 
stupendous like a homemade multi-tier wedding cake.

I guess part of it is that posting photos of the amazing food you're about to 
eat is really quite narcissistic - if somebody posted photos of all the 
expensive pairs of shoes they bought on their Instagram we'd think they fell 
somewhere between being an attention seekers and a show off, wouldn't we? Well 
done - you can afford nice things.

I mean, people aren't posting photos of their beans on toast, are they?

Your question to Frances Ryan: why do we treat disabled people so poorly?

We got an interesting question this week from a reader, directed at Frances 
Ryan, who had most recently written abouta potential Paralympic star forced to 
pull out due to cuts in disability support 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/31/paralympic-star-disability-support-cuts>
.

They asked: what can be done to challenge and change the current culture of 
treating disabled people so poorly? Here is Ryan’s response:


I think there’s two threads here. Firstly, challenging the government who are 
creating policy and in turn, exacerbating the culture. Secondly, challenging 
the culture itself. That first one probably feels a particularly insurmountable 
challenge right now but focusing on tangible hope is key. We can oppose the 
policy by writing to targeted MPs and Lords when this stuff comes up (look at 
Personal Independence Payments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/stephen-crabb-government-u-turns-disability-cuts-leaves-budget-disarray>
. It can work.) And crucially we can give practical help to people going 
through the assessments by organizing (see groupslike Fight Back 
<http://www.fightback4justice.co.u/> and Disabled People Against Cuts) 
<http://dpac.uk.net/>; whether that’s sharing tips for assessments or advocacy 
to help win on appeal.

Equally, changing the demonizing culture is a huge task but there are small 
things we can do: from challenging anti-disability and/or anti-benefit rhetoric 
when we hear it in the office or the pub,to telling our own disability stories 
through grassroots art 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/03/disabled-artists-use-skills-to-highlight-shoddy-treatment-over-benefits>
. The campaignStop Funding Hate 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/37035283/stop-funding-hate-campaign-urges-companies-to-drop-newspaper-adverts>
 offers a way to directly jolt right wing papers and their hateful rhetoric by 
lobbying their advertisers.

Freakshakes: the rise of a monstrous mashup of drink and dessert

Hilary Osborne
 Maxwell’s Bar & Grill Freakshakes Photograph: PR Company Handout 
When I first saw a picture of a freakshake I was simultaneously amazed and 
appalled. My mum loved knickerbocker glories, and when I was little they were 
sometimes a last-day-of-holiday treat, so I think they appealed to the child 
within me.But they are just so over the top, I really can’t imagine consuming a 
whole one 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/31/freakshakes-monstrous-mashup-drink-dessert-taking-over-britain>
. (And certainly wouldn’t encourage even attempting too more than once a year.)

Social media seems to be a factor in the extravagance. And I was interested to 
talk to people about its role in modern food trends. Not only do ideas spread 
more quickly than ever before, but people are actually thinking about 
Instagrammers when they are looking for new additions to their menus.

What do you think about this?

Thanks for all your contributions today: we’re just searching for your secrets 
to happiness in the comments (some genuinely good advice in there) as many 
colleagues appear to scramble around for the last things they need to do in the 
office before seeking the same at the pub. Not sure how successful that ever 
is, but there you go. We also enjoyed working with some of the suggestions 
you’ve been sending, so feel free to keep on doing so at 
matthew.holmes@theguardian.com or sarah.marsh@theguardian.com


We’ll leave you with this rallying call, which I’m 100% sure is absolutely 
truthful and accurate.

I spend most of my Friday afternoons reading the comments on this. So much so, 
I sometimes have to work Saturday morning to finish the work I am meant to do 
today.

This means I can't have a proper Friday night session, which I guess is better 
for my health.

Join the debate! Become fitter, happier?, wealthier.

Have a great weekend.

 
Each week we ask our team of moderators to flag up some of the comment threads 
they’ve really enjoyed reading, and this week the first of their highlights is 
an Opinion piece about dogs who can understand their owners.

"It’s great to know that dogs are able to understand us, but we need to learn 
to understand them better. One of the deepest joys of dog ownership has been 
learning about my dog, getting to know her personality quirks and funny little 
ticks."
Brilliant. As an animal lover I couldn't agree with you more. 
Understanding (even among humans) is a tricky concept. The philosopher 
Wittgenstein once said that if a lion could talk we wouldn't understand him. 
Rarely wrong, he was quite wrong about that one. Animals do talk and we can and 
do understand them, though they do not of course express themselves in human 
language.  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15353561> greg2644

I'm diagnosed with major depression, and when I'm going through a major 
depressive episode, my boxer Gracie will never leave my side without me asking 
her to be near me in any way. Then when I bounce back from it after several 
weeks, she lays off and knows that I'm okay. I've had her for 8 years, so we 
know each other very very well. These animals are truly remarkable friends.

I think you learn a bit more about them with every successive dog. Having made 
the mistake of not teaching previous dogs some of the basics (socialisation, 
recall, lead-walking, etc., I'm in my sixties now and I'm proud of our two 
current dogs. I'll have it mastered just before I pop my clogs!

Three things for a happy life: 

Good friends, stoicism and chocolate. 

Mainly chocolate.

One of my favourite stories to work on this week was a piece on that very 
subject (not chocolate, alas ... ).

‘Twenty seven years later they are still my closest friends’

I have two best friends, and I met them within the same week twenty seven 
years ago when I was twenty years old. I had dropped out of first year 
university a year earlier, due to family issues resulting in acute depression 
and anxiety. When I returned I felt odd being 'a year behind' and wondered if I 
was going to feel even lonelier than I had before I dropped out. Instead I met 
one friend in a radio class, and the other when my boyfriend came home and told 
me 'I just met someone at uni today who I think you might really like.' Within 
minutes of meeting each of them I felt as though I had met my soul mate. Twenty 
seven years later they are still my closest friends, their children are my 
godchildren and my son is their godchild. I can't imagine how my life would 
have been without them.

‘We’d been everything to each other since high school’

I lost my best friend this year. We'd been everything to each other since high 
school. No matter where I was in the world, I could count on Joe to come 
running if I needed him. He was there for me through drug rehab, I was there 
for him through his HIV diagnosis, and all the other horrible curves life tends 
to throw. The realization that he's not here anymore hits me every so often. 
It's not enough to "remember the good times", as people love to tell me. 
Because we're too young to have the good times stop and exist only in memory.

I suppose it's strange that I'm writing this on a news site to a bunch of 
faceless internet folk. So I'll tip out a bit of my coffee in memory of Joe. 
Even though he hated coffee. And news sites.

‘We had no common ground. Now I can’t imagine my life without her’

I didn't meet my soul mate and best friend until I was 27, ten years ago. We 
had no common ground. Now I can't imagine my life without her. The first thing 
we do every morning is text to see how we've slept and wish each other a good 
day. We're there for each other rain or shine, loving and laughing through the 
good times and crying together when things are tough. I am so lucky, every day 
I'm grateful that we found one another. My life would be much much poorer 
without her.

Anyway – I’d urge you to go and have a look! Do share your stories, too.

 
How do you lead a happy life? Yep, it’s a heavy question for a Friday 
afternoon, so Guardian Live shrewdly scheduledtheir event on this elusive 
subject on Thursday evening 
<https://membership.theguardian.com/event/utopia-2016-how-to-live-a-happy-life-26076096306>
 at Somerset House.

Now then, there are a lot of answers to that question that might seem 
appropriate this week, such as “don’tcommute on Southern Trains 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/sep/02/morning-commute-on-southern-rail-live>
” or “try not to end up as thepresident of Uzbekistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/uzbekistan-uncertainty-death-dictator-islam-karimov>
.”

But as I met my fellow panellists Vanessa King, Ruth Whippman and Dawn Foster, 
it did occur to me that one way to lead a happy life might be to avoid being 
stuck in a stuffy basement room on a glorious evening in early autumn listening 
to writers talk about how to lead a happy life.

Still, members, readers and general interlopers seemed, well, happy to be 
there. Whippman is amusing when describing the brutally earnest quest for 
happiness in America which paradoxically seems to be making everyone more 
miserable. King is good at the importance of emotional intelligence and 
self-knowledge. Foster chaired deftly with her customary deadpan delivery.


Once Guardian members and readers got stuck in during the Q and A however, it 
quickly became apparent that happiness is like beauty – in the eye of the 
beholder. Different strokes etc. It’s down to your parents, your freedom from 
psychological oppression, your upbringing, your emotional security, your 
self-esteem, your life choices, your talent fulfilment, the recognition of your 
intrinsic worth. Poverty can make you miserable, but money won’t necessarily 
make you happy.

So come on readers, get stuck in: what three qualities make for a happy life.

The Design Museum’s Designs of the Year shortlist was announced this week

<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jul/02/ikea-flatpack-refugee-shelter>
. Once again, there was a big emphasis on the much-heralded “maker movement”, 
with many projects trumpeting their open source credentials and claiming to 
“disrupt” the usual supply chain of designer-manufactuer-consumer. But does 
this vision of mass armies of garden shed hobbyists, with access to laser 
cutters and 3D-printers, and the DIY know-how to assemble things, actually ring 
true? Are you an aspiring maker? Do you actually want to customise your own 
clothes on demand? Or is this vision of a culture of democratic, localised and 
bespoke making all just hype?

Stephen Merchant wouldn’t be the choice of many of you for host of the new 
Crystal Maze.

I'm disappointed that Stephen Merchant is the Mazemaster for the new Crystal 
Maze - not only because there have been some very talented young actors and 
comedians playing the part on the Crystal Maze live shows for whom it could 
have been a big break, but also because he just doesn't fit the bill for me, 
and that worries me as regards the direction of the show overall.

Stephen Merchant's strengths are in being an everyman. An awkward, nerdy 
everyman, but an everyman - he's a relateable character. The Mazemaster should 
be an eccentric, mischievous and somewhat otherworldly. He shouldn't feel like 
someone you might bump into in the staff canteen.

I had the afternoon off yesterday, and asked my three-year-old boy James what 
he wanted to do together. “Play Pokémon” was his request. So that’s what we 
did. It’s left me wondering whether I did the right thing though.

We played Pokémon Go for a good couple of hours. We spent about an hour of 
that walking through a forest and by a lake, and we spotted ladybirds and holly 
bushes, and got some fresh air and exercise, and it was an outdoor activity. 
But we still spent a lot of of that time with our eyes glued to a screen.

He’s suddenly become absolutely obsessed with it. He knows all the names, he’s 
constantly asking his mum to message me when I’m at work to ask a question 
about a particular Pokémon type, or to see if I’ve caught any new ones. It’s 
amazing the facts and figures their little minds can hoover up and memorise if 
they are really interested in something.

But are games like that something a three-year-old should be playing? Should I 
have done something more traditional with him instead? If we’d done the walk in 
the woods as an activity in its own right, I’m not sure his attention on it 
would have lasted that long.

His older sister, Emma, is six. She’s already fantastically adept at using 
computers and typing, I think in part that is through having played games on 
smartphones and the iPad when she was younger. Those seem to me to be useful 
life skills to learn. But what do you think?

Here’s one especially for one reader both on the subject of Instagram and 
their interest in “ISS and Hubble telescope stuff”.

I left Facebook for several reasons and one of the annoyances was people 
tagging themselves throughout the day and then posting their dinner at some 
point. Tagging used to be a punishment for criminals!

Anyway, found I still had an Instagram account which is a much friendlier 
platform. So far so good, no food shots unless I go looking for them. I do have 
a minute following so far though and enjoy the Nat Geo, ISS and Hubble 
telescope stuff.

I am guilty of sending WhatsApp pictures of pints to mates when they're at 
work and I'm in pub.

So it’s not all what we had for lunch ... you can follow the Guardian on 
Instagram <https://www.instagram.com/guardian/?hl=en> for more like this.

 
Yes, Instagram really does get you talking. Here are some more of your 
comments:

The point of Instagram, or anything like it, is that it's user-submitted, it 
is what you make of it. When I first signed up, I joked that I'd just use it to 
take "arty" photos of mundane food; microwave pasta, or some toast, or a Pot 
Noodle or whatever, as I never really got the fuss over "Instagramming" your 
meal unless, say, you run a business selling food and it might make you a few 
quid to show it off.

But what I realised when I started using Instagram is that, unless you want to 
tag every post with a million hashtags to chase likes/followers, it's best use 
is just posting stuff to amuse your mates, or to amuse yourself. And if photos 
of food are part of that, more power to you.

I like instagram, from a sport or hobby point of view it is really great at 
connecting you with people who may have similar, but niche interests.

For food though it seems bizarre, the focus tends to be on decadence or size 
rather than taste. ie, am I ordering a 'freakshake' because it tastes amazing 
or just because it will look good on social?

When your enjoyment is defined by social envy then it has gone too far
 
British prime minister Theresa May has said that “Brexit means Brexit”, and 
that the government must push ahead with plans for Britain to leave the 
European Union (EU). But, in an ideal world, what would our new relationship 
withEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> look like?

Is Instagram changing our relationship with food?

No.

Instagram is changing peoples relationship with the rest of the world by 
turning them into narcissistic self absorbed tw*ts who can only communicate 
through a pictorial reference to some trivial facet of their unimportant lives.

The definition of a pointless 1st world life is surely trying to validate your 
existence through a picture of a dessert.

Pretty much everyone I know thinks posting pictures of your food on Instagram 
is really annoying and a pointless waste of time - unless it's something truly 
stupendous like a homemade multi-tier wedding cake.

I guess part of it is that posting photos of the amazing food you're about to 
eat is really quite narcissistic - if somebody posted photos of all the 
expensive pairs of shoes they bought on their Instagram we'd think they fell 
somewhere between being an attention seekers and a show off, wouldn't we? Well 
done - you can afford nice things.

I mean, people aren't posting photos of their beans on toast, are they?
 
We got an interesting question this week from a reader, directed at Frances 
Ryan, who had most recently written abouta potential Paralympic star forced to 
pull out due to cuts in disability support 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/31/paralympic-star-disability-support-cuts>
.

They asked: what can be done to challenge and change the current culture of 
treating disabled people so poorly? Here is Ryan’s response:


I think there’s two threads here. Firstly, challenging the government who are 
creating policy and in turn, exacerbating the culture. Secondly, challenging 
the culture itself. That first one probably feels a particularly insurmountable 
challenge right now but focusing on tangible hope is key. We can oppose the 
policy by writing to targeted MPs and Lords when this stuff comes up (look at 
Personal Independence Payments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/stephen-crabb-government-u-turns-disability-cuts-leaves-budget-disarray>
. It can work.) And crucially we can give practical help to people going 
through the assessments by organizing (see groupslike Fight Back 
<http://www.fightback4justice.co.u/> and Disabled People Against Cuts) 
<http://dpac.uk.net/>; whether that’s sharing tips for assessments or advocacy 
to help win on appeal.

Equally, changing the demonizing culture is a huge task but there are small 
things we can do: from challenging anti-disability and/or anti-benefit rhetoric 
when we hear it in the office or the pub,to telling our own disability stories 
through grassroots art 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/03/disabled-artists-use-skills-to-highlight-shoddy-treatment-over-benefits>
. The campaignStop Funding Hate 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/37035283/stop-funding-hate-campaign-urges-companies-to-drop-newspaper-adverts>
 offers a way to directly jolt right wing papers and their hateful rhetoric by 
lobbying their advertisers.

When I first saw a picture of a freakshake I was simultaneously amazed and 
appalled. My mum loved knickerbocker glories, and when I was little they were 
sometimes a last-day-of-holiday treat, so I think they appealed to the child 
within me.But they are just so over the top, I really can’t imagine consuming a 
whole one 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/31/freakshakes-monstrous-mashup-drink-dessert-taking-over-britain>
. (And certainly wouldn’t encourage even attempting too more than once a year.)

Social media seems to be a factor in the extravagance. And I was interested to 
talk to people about its role in modern food trends. Not only do ideas spread 
more quickly than ever before, but people are actually thinking about 
Instagrammers when they are looking for new additions to their menus.
