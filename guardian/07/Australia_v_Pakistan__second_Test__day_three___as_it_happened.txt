Stumps - Australia 278-2 (Khawaja 95, Smith 10)

Adam Collins

Australia were in complete control during that final session, plundering 147 
runs, losing only the one wicket in the process. It could have been a lot 
different had Wahab kept his foot behind the line in the opening quarter hour 
though, clean bowling Warner with one of the better inswingers you will see at 
150 clicks.

All told, Wahab has sent down ten no-balls; the worst nightmare for a fast 
bowler. It took the sting completely out of the Pakistan attack, who struggled 
to hold back Warner and Khawaja as they rattled off a stand of 198 across just 
36 overs together at the crease.

Along the way, Warner registered his 17th Test ton. It was only the second 
time he reached three figures in the Australian creams in 2016, so he won’t 
mind much that it wasn’t the most convincing hand. But it did include some 
dominant strokeplay. Job done.

As for Khawaja, he’s been dreamy for an unbeaten 95 overnight. Encouragingly, 
with the Indian tour around the corner, his best shots have been against the 
spin of Yasir. He’ll be after his sixth Test ton when play resumes at 10am 
tomorrow.

When it does, Australia will be 165 behind after Pakistan declared at 443-9 
earlier today, Azhar Ali finishing with a superb, chanceless 206. Due to the 
threat of rain again tomorrow - storms even - a result in this Test looks 
unlikely. But with over 400 runs struck on day three here at the MCG, the 
25,000 in attendance certainly got what they paid for.

I might leave it there. It’ll be Russell Jackson back with you tomorrow 
morning for Guardian Australia’s live, over-by-over coverage. Have a lovely 
evening.

58th over: Australia 278-2 (Khawaja 95, Smith 10). Khawaja too cool and calm 
to worry about the ton overnight. Defending and leaving, even after a man drops 
out for the last ball. He gets one, so he’ll have the strike. Nicely done. I’ll 
wrap up the day in a tic as the players leave the ground at stumps.

57th over: Australia 277-2 (Khawaja 94, Smith 10). A maiden from Sohail to 
Smith, so Khawaja has to wait. But another way of looking at it is that it 
meant the over only took three minutes - mercifully quick for Sohail - securing 
a final over. It’ll be Amir rather than Yasir for it. Khawaja six to get. 
Australia 166 behind.

56th over: Australia 277-2 (Khawaja 94, Smith 10). Another Yasir over, another 
couple of boundaries. They’ve feasted on him in this final session. Khawaja is 
bold enough to still sweep this late in the day, rewarded with four runs. Then 
he drives him joyously through cover to end the over. He’s 94 with five minutes 
left. Maybe two overs. Carn, Usman. Do it.

55th over: Australia 269-2 (Khawaja 86, Smith 10). Sohail back into the attack 
from the Southern End and squares up Smith with movement that hasn’t been there 
at all today. Nice areas, big boy. Nice areas. It is wide of second slip, which 
is unfortunate for the visitors who could really do with not worrying about 
Sniffer Smith in the AM. Anyway, not to be. Two overs to go, I reckon.

54th over: Australia 264-2 (Khawaja 85, Smith 6). Yasir was the highest ranked 
bowler in the world according to the ICC about six months ago. He’s looked 
anything but today, the Australians doing as they please when he’s been on. 
Saying that, they’re measured at this late stage of the day, Smith pushing him 
to mid-on to begin the over then Khawaja taking him out to midwicket later on. 
The captain very happy to defend the rest of the set.

Seeing 400+ runs today has reinforced my belief that day 3 is the best day to 
go to a test match

53rd over: Australia 262-2 (Khawaja 84, Smith 5). Wahab vs Khawaja. Couple two 
fine leg off the hip. Easy. Couple more singles to either batsman. Not much to 
speak of here at this stage of the game other than the fact that Pakistan want 
out of here, and soon.

52nd over: Australia 258-2 (Khawaja 81, Smith 4). Three taken from Yasir, 
Khawaja driving through the off-side for a couple then grabbing one to fine leg 
later in the over, so he’ll keep the strike. 22 minutes until stumps. Probably 
not enough time for Khawaja to reach 100, but I hope he tries.

51st over: Australia 255-2 (Khawaja 78, Smith 4). Wahab gets another glove 
down the legside, to Khawaja this time. But he’s fortunate and it doesn’t go to 
glove. It’s the first of two boundaries in the over, Smith deep in the crease 
expecting a short ball, says Simon Katich, edging it beyond slip. Not 
convincing. Wouldn’t have mattered even had it crashed onto his stumps though, 
as it is a no-ball. Urgh. His final delivery is way down the legside, and Smith 
wants none of it.

50th over: Australia 245-2 (Khawaja 73, Smith 0). Yasir gets half an over at 
Khawaja, who takes a single to long-on. Then half an over to the new man Smith, 
who gets his eye in with with three defensive strokes. Solid.

49th over: Australia 244-2 (Khawaja 72, Smith 0). Warner’s demise came after 
smashing Wahab earlier in the over to the square leg boundary. The deficit came 
below 200 as well with a drive out to point. Anyway, let’s be glad that it 
happened rather than annoyed that it is over. Smith is the new man, seeing off 
the only Wahab delivery he needed to negotiate before the end of the over.

WICKET! Warner c Sarfraz b Wahab 144. (Australia 244-2)

Well, that’s a shame. Down leg, Warner tries to paddle Wahab around for yet 
more runs. But it’s the smallest tickle on the glove shown by DRS after 
Pakistan sent it upstairs after an initial not out verdict. Warner’s 143 ball 
stand comes to an end. His second ton of the year and 17th in all. It was a 
hand of highs and low, the glorious and the unconvincing. But he walks off with 
a Test ton to his name, an entertaining one at that, so we’re all grateful. As 
is Misbah for seeing the back of him, no doubt.

48th over: Australia 238-1 (Warner 138, Khawaja 72). Yasir continues, so 
Warner keeps with the themeand pops his first ball back over the bowlers’ head 
into the Members.His runs have caught up with his balls faced now. Someone want 
to pull up the quickest Test double tons? You know what, I will. I have time 
and I am your conduit after all. Top five: 1st = 153 balls, 2nd 163, 3rd 168, 
4th 182, 5th 186.

47th over: Australia 231-1 (Warner 131, Khawaja 72). Wahab bowls a no-ball and 
everyone has a good laugh. Well, not me. I did something like this once and I 
still think about it about once a fortnight. Earlier in the over the was right 
on the mark with a bouncer to Warner and somehow didn’t go to hand after the 
batsman fended away. To end the set another short ball comes Khawaja’s way and 
he helps it down to long-leg for a single. He’s looking properly grouse on 
there. Australia have made 73 runs in the last ten overs.

46th over: Australia 227-1 (Warner 130, Khawaja 70). Yasir manages to string a 
handful of dot balls together, but then overpitches to Khawaja who dishes out 
another beautiful cover drive. More through point actually. Either way, it sure 
is pretty.

45th over: Australia 222-1 (Warner 129, Khawaja 66). David Warner in ODI mode 
now too. How good must that feel, well beyond 100 and braining them during the 
best conditions of the Test, the opposition already ropey? He could do some 
record book damage here. Of course, that’ll mozz him. But it is a risk I’m 
willing to take. And as I type it: ping! That’s a glorious cover drive to the 
boundary. Singles to four of the other deliveries of the over, Khawaja hooking 
the final of those.

Neglected to mention in my previous post that the Sixers win was set up by 
half centuries via Alyssa Healy and Ashleigh Gardiner and a 40 odd for Elysse 
Perry. Marizanne Kapp took a couple with the ball.

44th over: Australia 213-1 (Warner 123, Khawaja 63). First ball after liquid 
and Warner is reverse sweeping to the rope. Four men out now with Yasir 
operating, three on the legside. He picks out the long-off though to turn the 
strike over. All a bit easy. Some nice areas from the leggie to Khawaja though, 
beating him with a googly, then ripping past his pads, glancing to leg-slip. 
The pressure wasn’t destined to last though, Khawaja advancing with a 
purposeful stride to clobber the final ball through the covers with those 
languid limbs that got us so excited about this time last year. One-fa-71 for 
Yasir from 10 overs. One-fa-smashed.

Will do a bit of WBBL round up over the next couple of overs. First, in the 
Sydney Smash it is the Sixers knocking off the the Thunder in last year’s Grand 
Final rematch.
Sydney Sixers WBBL (@SixersWBBL) 
We have recorded a 33 run win over the Thunder in today's WBBL clash! Great 
team effort by the team and bragging rights in the#sydneysmash

43rd over: Australia 204-1 (Warner 118, Khawaja 59). Last over before a little 
drinky poo, and it’s Wahab back into the attack. Good on Misbah for throwing 
him straight back into it. It looked like having the desired effect too in 
slowing things down, until he slid down the legside and flicked Khawaja’s pads, 
four leg-byes the result. Kiss cam is coming up on the TV during the drinks 
break. I bloody wish kiss cam would come up on me one day. I’d absolutely snog 
whoever I was next to. Speaking of... a song?
 This should be the kiss cam song. Facebook

42nd over: Australia 200-1 (Warner 118, Khawaja 59). Warner has firmly put the 
foot down since reaching three figures, lashing Yasir through cover with the 
sort of drive you would see on a cricket card, his back knee on the ground at 
the point of contact. And with that comes theAustralian 200. You wouldn’t say 
that Pakistan are in any real trouble, but their chances of winning the Test 
rely on changing the tempo of this innings pretty quickly. Meanwhile, I just 
overheard Bill Lawry on the TV commentary saying “clean as a whistle” and I 
feel a lot better about life.

41st over: Australia 194-1 (Warner 113, Khawaja 58) Opening up a fair bit now. 
Amir doesn’t do much wrong but Khawaja takes three behind square from his 
stumps, then Warner steers two behind point. Warner into white-ball mode in 
running him down to third man later in the over. Would have been four if not 
for how passionate Yasir is in the chase; he’s an outstanding fielder. Eight 
off it.

Lovely man Gary Naylor writes in. “The Amir stat,” that you can see below. 
“Have they tried tucking up Warner by going short, at his armpit with two men 
out? Obvious line for me.” They have not. Remember when that ball on the hip 
kept winning his wicket in England last year? Either way, going to have to mix 
it up to him now. Or it could get ugly.

My constitutional duty to include this reply to my earlier Watto bit from the 
scoreboard. Miss you, Big Rig.

40th over: Australia 186-1 (Warner 108, Khawaja 55). Spin on from the Member’s 
End via Yasir. And to his first delivery Khawajaclips to midwicket for his own 
half-century. Nice going, after spending more than half an hour on 49. 88 balls 
and a couple of hours at the crease. He’s done it easy, the Australian no. 3. 
Saying that, hegives a half-chance later in the over. Deep in the crease and 
cutting against the spin, an outside edge is won but flies beyond the ‘keeper 
Sarfraz and slipper Younis. Four for his trouble. Between times Warner took a 
couple to cover and a single to mid-off. Australia trail by 258.

39th over: Australia 177-1 (Warner 105, Khawaja 49). Yep, as predicted, Warner 
onto the front foot and driving with beautiful timing down to the long-on rope. 
Just about the best shot of his stay. A couple more through the cordon - albeit 
on the carpet - gets him a couple more. That’s 99. What will Amir do here? 
Misbah has moved into a catching point, butit’s down to fine leg for four and a 
century!Only 113 balls to get there. Warner’s 17th Test ton, and first at the 
MCG. He’ll bookmark this calendar year with two hundreds, at Sydney in his 
first knock and now at Melbourne at what may very well be his last if weather 
continues to intervene. 180 minutes, 13 fours the other numbers that matter. 
Running off the outside edge, there’s another two and it’s a very big over 
already with a ball to come and 12 netted. To be fair, wasn’t an innings 
without luck, including the shot to bring it up, a big inside edge. But he 
won’t mind.

38th over: Australia 165-1 (Warner 93, Khawaja 49). Davey is getting busy now. 
Enough of this respectful, watchful nonsense. His first scoring shot isn’t 
overly convincing, mind, pushing through gully (or thereabouts) at a very 
catchable enough height I fancy, had someone been right on the spot there. 
Still, it gets him four and into the 90s. He’s better off the back foot, 
forward of point for two more. A single ends the much more eventful over, into 
the covers. He keeps the strike and is within seven of a ton now. Won’t take 
long, he rarely does once getting this close.

37th over: Australia 158-1 (Warner 86, Khawaja 49). Chris Rogers being 
interesting on the radio, as he almost always us. Explaining that he prepared 
for batting by not drinking coffee before going out there in order to control 
his heart rate. He explains that Marcus Trescothick - his Somerset teammate 
from 2016 - does the opposite, by dunking a lot of Red Bull. Ball in hand, Amir 
is good enough to win Khawaja’s edge in another maiden. It fell short of the

36th over: Australia 158-1 (Warner 86, Khawaja 49). Another maiden from 
Sohail, his second on the spin. No real sting out there at the moment following 
the Wahab Debacle. On this occasion it is Warner watching in defence 
throughout, before getting underneath a bouncer. I wish there was more to say 
about it. I really do.

35th over: Australia 158-1 (Warner 86, Khawaja 49). Unsurprisingly, Amir is 
back into the attack, replacing Wahab from the Great Southern Stand end. It’s a 
good return, forcing Warner to play without, beating him with one that darted 
away off the seam. A single behind point ensures that he retains the strike, 14 
from 100.

34th over: Australia 157-1 (Warner 85, Khawaja 49). A maiden from Sohail, but 
it’s easy peasy for Khawaja leaving and defending in rotation. Possible heavy 
thunderstorms tomorrow being reported by the ABC on their call. Hope not, or 
this could turn into a pretty dreary last couple of days. All the more reason 
for Warner to get a bit selfish here. With just the one Test ton in 2016 - 
coming with his first hit back in January - he has a chance to convert his 
earlier luck into a very big hand.

More on Mark Nicholas. He was treated by the Australian team doctor after the 
episode. He was on air as recently as the tea break, according to Andrew Wu on
twitter <https://twitter.com/wutube/status/813980959116644353>. Will keep you 
posted as we receive official updates.

33rd over: Australia 157-1 (Warner 85, Khawaja 49). Oh no. Wahab is really 
losing it here. Two more no-balls in the space of three attempts to begin his 
set. The first is another jaffa to Khawaja, colliding with his pad. There’s no 
appeal as the call comes early. It probably wasn’t out, but the very thought of 
it after knocking over Warner with one the previous over. He’s over by amile 
the second time. Ugly. This is an awful feeling for a bowler. Couple leg byes 
and a couple to Warner through cover.

Some other news from the press box. CA have advised that Mark Nicholas has 
been transported to hospital for the second time in the match, experiencing 
more abdominal pains.

32nd over: Australia 151-1 (Warner 83, Khawaja 48). “This is gentle bowling, 
isn’t it. Dying down the wicketkeeper, it doesn’t look like anything that’ll 
extract an error from the batsman.” That’s Dirk Nannes, who doesn’t think much 
of Sohail, running away from us at the Members’ End. He’s not wrong. Khawaja is 
very happy defending and leaving. A three to end the over down to third man - 
albeit relatively in control - moves the Australians beyond 150.

How’s this popping up on the scoreboard? Be still my beating heart.

31st over: Australia 147-1 (Warner 83, Khawaja 45). Oh no Wahab has bowled 
Warner with a no-ball. It is a complete debacle, the middle of three no-balls 
on the trot. He’s distraught. It was such a pearler of a delivery as well, an 
indipping yorker that you dream of as a quick. 150 clicks. He won’t bowl many 
better balls in his career. What can you say? The 100 run syand comes up 
Khawaja takes a single later in the over. After each legal delivery to finish 
the over - the trio of no-balls occurring on his second attempt at a legal 
delivery - his shoulders slump at the injustice of it all. Well, maybe not 
injustice. But it’s an awful game, sometimes (most of the time).

30th over: Australia 138-1 (Warner 80, Khawaja 42). Warne and Slater are 
pretty happy that Sohail is into the XI. Balance, and all that. On that note, 
I’m shifting over to the radio commentary. Where Dirk Nannes is in the middle 
of of a comprehensive unpacking of Sohail’s action. That’s better. The over 
itself? He won Warner’s inside edge to begin, the vice-captain then taking a 
couple through the cover. Takes a while to build up to top speed, big Sohail. 
But not known for his second (third, fourth) spells. I’m very fond of him.

29th over: Australia 135-1 (Warner 77, Khawaja 42). “It would be a miracle for 
Australia to win this game,” says Shane Warne on the telly. Not sure I’d go 
that far, but a long way to go that much is true. Huge Wahab shout for leg 
before but it is angling a long way down Warner’s legside. 148kph - serious 
heat. They aren’t going upstairs, so at least they’ve improved on the earlier 
review. Surely that’s the worst in the history of the DRS? I’m sure Russell 
dealt with this. Inside edge from Khawaja when he’s up the business end. That’s 
fast as well. Much better from the Pakistani quick.

Adam Collins

Hello, sportsfans. 

Yes, it’s true we are probably draw bound. But David Warner’s having a party, 
so for that reason alone you can’t be better placed than the OBO for the 
protracted final session of this final day at theCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Ground. Especially now the sun is 
out.

Russ has put in a mighty stint at the northern end of the press box, and I’m 
happy to relieve him at the southern. I think he’s writing something about Big 
Josh Hazlewood, so keep an eye out for that later, his 100th Test wicket in the 
bag as well in that middle session.

Righto, we’re about five minutes away so let’s get to it. 
Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com 
<mailto:Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com> for your classiest nonsense. 
@collinsadam <http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam> for your low rent stuff. You 
know I trade in both. For now, have some culture so you can tell your mates you 
know at least one song from 2016 when Australia Day rolls around.

Tea on day three - Australia are recovering well

28th over: Australia 131-1 (Warner 77, Khawaja 39)

And that is that for the second session on day three. Azhar had another go 
with his leggies and there are a few single before Warner ends the session with 
a blazing cut through point, finishing as he played throughout his innings so 
far by picking up a boundary. Aside from the loss of Matt Renshaw, Australia 
have owned this session. I think we’re headed for a draw at the MCG, but make 
Adam Collins welcome when he arrives shortly.

27th over: Australia 125-1 (Warner 72, Khawaja 38)

We’ll have another over after all, with Amir getting through this one before 
the clock ticks over to 3:40pm local time. Adam Collins will be appearing from 
the bull pen after that and take you through to stumps. This time around it’s 
the tourists who wish the session would end. The Australians lost Matt Renshaw 
early but have consolidated brilliantly with this unbroken 79-run stand.

26th over: Australia 120-1 (Warner 68, Khawaja 37)

In what might be the second last over before tea, batting hero Azhar appears 
to replace Yasir with his own brand of leggies, but the result is not initially 
much different. Warner pulls two into the deep and there are plenty of singles 
on offer too. Amir will probably finish us off.

25th over: Australia 115-1 (Warner 64, Khawaja 36)

Amir has worked his way up to 141kmph now but he’s not extracting a worrying 
amount of bite or bounce from this pitch, so without tempting fate, I’m really 
starting to lose that gut feel about Australia crumpling into a heap and losing 
by an innings. It was probably a little pessimistic to start with. Amir strays 
outside off with a half-tracker and Khawaja caresses it wide of gully for four 
more.

24th over: Australia 111-1 (Warner 64, Khawaja 32)

As I feast on party pies, Warner and Khawaja tuck into Yasir. Warner hammers 
another full toss through cover and works a single, then Khawaja unfurls two 
cover drives of subtly differing class – one conventional, one square – to pick 
up two consecutive fours of his own. Australia thus pass 100 and this 
partnership moves from strength to strength.

23rd over: Australia 97-1 (Warner 59, Khawaja 23)

Mohammad Amir is back into the attack now and will probably get three over in 
before the break, though I must admit I’ve just missed most of his first over 
making a dash for the party pies and mini sausage rolls that just appeared. 
This is fearless work, of course, but a man can build up a certain level of 
hunger in the process.

Australia were in complete control during that final session, plundering 147 
runs, losing only the one wicket in the process. It could have been a lot 
different had Wahab kept his foot behind the line in the opening quarter hour 
though, clean bowling Warner with one of the better inswingers you will see at 
150 clicks.

All told, Wahab has sent down ten no-balls; the worst nightmare for a fast 
bowler. It took the sting completely out of the Pakistan attack, who struggled 
to hold back Warner and Khawaja as they rattled off a stand of 198 across just 
36 overs together at the crease.

Along the way, Warner registered his 17th Test ton. It was only the second 
time he reached three figures in the Australian creams in 2016, so he won’t 
mind much that it wasn’t the most convincing hand. But it did include some 
dominant strokeplay. Job done.

As for Khawaja, he’s been dreamy for an unbeaten 95 overnight. Encouragingly, 
with the Indian tour around the corner, his best shots have been against the 
spin of Yasir. He’ll be after his sixth Test ton when play resumes at 10am 
tomorrow.

When it does, Australia will be 165 behind after Pakistan declared at 443-9 
earlier today, Azhar Ali finishing with a superb, chanceless 206. Due to the 
threat of rain again tomorrow - storms even - a result in this Test looks 
unlikely. But with over 400 runs struck on day three here at the MCG, the 
25,000 in attendance certainly got what they paid for.

I might leave it there. It’ll be Russell Jackson back with you tomorrow 
morning for Guardian Australia’s live, over-by-over coverage. Have a lovely 
evening.
 
58th over: Australia 278-2 (Khawaja 95, Smith 10). Khawaja too cool and calm 
to worry about the ton overnight. Defending and leaving, even after a man drops 
out for the last ball. He gets one, so he’ll have the strike. Nicely done. I’ll 
wrap up the day in a tic as the players leave the ground at stumps.
 
57th over: Australia 277-2 (Khawaja 94, Smith 10). A maiden from Sohail to 
Smith, so Khawaja has to wait. But another way of looking at it is that it 
meant the over only took three minutes - mercifully quick for Sohail - securing 
a final over. It’ll be Amir rather than Yasir for it. Khawaja six to get. 
Australia 166 behind.
 
56th over: Australia 277-2 (Khawaja 94, Smith 10). Another Yasir over, another 
couple of boundaries. They’ve feasted on him in this final session. Khawaja is 
bold enough to still sweep this late in the day, rewarded with four runs. Then 
he drives him joyously through cover to end the over. He’s 94 with five minutes 
left. Maybe two overs. Carn, Usman. Do it.
 
55th over: Australia 269-2 (Khawaja 86, Smith 10). Sohail back into the attack 
from the Southern End and squares up Smith with movement that hasn’t been there 
at all today. Nice areas, big boy. Nice areas. It is wide of second slip, which 
is unfortunate for the visitors who could really do with not worrying about 
Sniffer Smith in the AM. Anyway, not to be. Two overs to go, I reckon.

54th over: Australia 264-2 (Khawaja 85, Smith 6). Yasir was the highest ranked 
bowler in the world according to the ICC about six months ago. He’s looked 
anything but today, the Australians doing as they please when he’s been on. 
Saying that, they’re measured at this late stage of the day, Smith pushing him 
to mid-on to begin the over then Khawaja taking him out to midwicket later on. 
The captain very happy to defend the rest of the set.

53rd over: Australia 262-2 (Khawaja 84, Smith 5). Wahab vs Khawaja. Couple two 
fine leg off the hip. Easy. Couple more singles to either batsman. Not much to 
speak of here at this stage of the game other than the fact that Pakistan want 
out of here, and soon.
 
52nd over: Australia 258-2 (Khawaja 81, Smith 4). Three taken from Yasir, 
Khawaja driving through the off-side for a couple then grabbing one to fine leg 
later in the over, so he’ll keep the strike. 22 minutes until stumps. Probably 
not enough time for Khawaja to reach 100, but I hope he tries.
 
51st over: Australia 255-2 (Khawaja 78, Smith 4). Wahab gets another glove 
down the legside, to Khawaja this time. But he’s fortunate and it doesn’t go to 
glove. It’s the first of two boundaries in the over, Smith deep in the crease 
expecting a short ball, says Simon Katich, edging it beyond slip. Not 
convincing. Wouldn’t have mattered even had it crashed onto his stumps though, 
as it is a no-ball. Urgh. His final delivery is way down the legside, and Smith 
wants none of it.

49th over: Australia 244-2 (Khawaja 72, Smith 0). Warner’s demise came after 
smashing Wahab earlier in the over to the square leg boundary. The deficit came 
below 200 as well with a drive out to point. Anyway, let’s be glad that it 
happened rather than annoyed that it is over. Smith is the new man, seeing off 
the only Wahab delivery he needed to negotiate before the end of the over.

Well, that’s a shame. Down leg, Warner tries to paddle Wahab around for yet 
more runs. But it’s the smallest tickle on the glove shown by DRS after 
Pakistan sent it upstairs after an initial not out verdict. Warner’s 143 ball 
stand comes to an end. His second ton of the year and 17th in all. It was a 
hand of highs and low, the glorious and the unconvincing. But he walks off with 
a Test ton to his name, an entertaining one at that, so we’re all grateful. As 
is Misbah for seeing the back of him, no doubt.
 
48th over: Australia 238-1 (Warner 138, Khawaja 72). Yasir continues, so 
Warner keeps with the themeand pops his first ball back over the bowlers’ head 
into the Members.His runs have caught up with his balls faced now. Someone want

everyone has a good laugh. Well, not me. I did something like this once and I 
still think about it about once a fortnight. Earlier in the over the was right 
on the mark with a bouncer to Warner and somehow didn’t go to hand after the 
batsman fended away. To end the set another short ball comes Khawaja’s way and 
he helps it down to long-leg for a single. He’s looking properly grouse on 
there. Australia have made 73 runs in the last ten overs.
 
46th over: Australia 227-1 (Warner 130, Khawaja 70). Yasir manages to string a 
handful of dot balls together, but then overpitches to Khawaja who dishes out 
another beautiful cover drive. More through point actually. Either way, it sure 
is pretty.

now too. How good must that feel, well beyond 100 and braining them during the 
best conditions of the Test, the opposition already ropey? He could do some 
record book damage here. Of course, that’ll mozz him. But it is a risk I’m 
willing to take. And as I type it: ping! That’s a glorious cover drive to the 
boundary. Singles to four of the other deliveries of the over, Khawaja hooking 
the final of those.

Neglected to mention in my previous post that the Sixers win was set up by 
half centuries via Alyssa Healy and Ashleigh Gardiner and a 40 odd for Elysse 
Perry. Marizanne Kapp took a couple with the ball.
 
44th over: Australia 213-1 (Warner 123, Khawaja 63). First ball after liquid 
and Warner is reverse sweeping to the rope. Four men out now with Yasir 
operating, three on the legside. He picks out the long-off though to turn the 
strike over. All a bit easy. Some nice areas from the leggie to Khawaja though, 
beating him with a googly, then ripping past his pads, glancing to leg-slip. 
The pressure wasn’t destined to last though, Khawaja advancing with a 
purposeful stride to clobber the final ball through the covers with those 
languid limbs that got us so excited about this time last year. One-fa-71 for 
Yasir from 10 overs. One-fa-smashed.

Will do a bit of WBBL round up over the next couple of overs. First, in the 
Sydney Smash it is the Sixers knocking off the the Thunder in last year’s Grand 
Final rematch.

43rd over: Australia 204-1 (Warner 118, Khawaja 59). Last over before a little 
drinky poo, and it’s Wahab back into the attack. Good on Misbah for throwing 
him straight back into it. It looked like having the desired effect too in 
slowing things down, until he slid down the legside and flicked Khawaja’s pads, 
four leg-byes the result. Kiss cam is coming up on the TV during the drinks 
break. I bloody wish kiss cam would come up on me one day. I’d absolutely snog 
whoever I was next to. Speaking of... a song?
 This should be the kiss cam song.  
42nd over: Australia 200-1 (Warner 118, Khawaja 59). Warner has firmly put the 
foot down since reaching three figures, lashing Yasir through cover with the 
sort of drive you would see on a cricket card, his back knee on the ground at 
the point of contact. And with that comes theAustralian 200. You wouldn’t say 
that Pakistan are in any real trouble, but their chances of winning the Test 
rely on changing the tempo of this innings pretty quickly. Meanwhile, I just 
overheard Bill Lawry on the TV commentary saying “clean as a whistle” and I 
feel a lot better about life.
 
41st over: Australia 194-1 (Warner 113, Khawaja 58) Opening up a fair bit now. 
Amir doesn’t do much wrong but Khawaja takes three behind square from his 
stumps, then Warner steers two behind point. Warner into white-ball mode in 
running him down to third man later in the over. Would have been four if not 
for how passionate Yasir is in the chase; he’s an outstanding fielder. Eight 
off it.

Lovely man Gary Naylor writes in. “The Amir stat,” that you can see below. 
“Have they tried tucking up Warner by going short, at his armpit with two men 
out? Obvious line for me.” They have not. Remember when that ball on the hip 
kept winning his wicket in England last year? Either way, going to have to mix 
it up to him now. Or it could get ugly.

My constitutional duty to include this reply to my earlier Watto bit from the 
scoreboard. Miss you, Big Rig.

40th over: Australia 186-1 (Warner 108, Khawaja 55). Spin on from the Member’s 
End via Yasir. And to his first delivery Khawajaclips to midwicket for his own 
half-century. Nice going, after spending more than half an hour on 49. 88 balls 
and a couple of hours at the crease. He’s done it easy, the Australian no. 3. 
Saying that, hegives a half-chance later in the over. Deep in the crease and 
cutting against the spin, an outside edge is won but flies beyond the ‘keeper 
Sarfraz and slipper Younis. Four for his trouble. Between times Warner took a 
couple to cover and a single to mid-off. Australia trail by 258.

39th over: Australia 177-1 (Warner 105, Khawaja 49). Yep, as predicted, Warner 
onto the front foot and driving with beautiful timing down to the long-on rope. 
Just about the best shot of his stay. A couple more through the cordon - albeit 
on the carpet - gets him a couple more. That’s 99. What will Amir do here? 
Misbah has moved into a catching point, butit’s down to fine leg for four and a 
century!Only 113 balls to get there. Warner’s 17th Test ton, and first at the 
MCG. He’ll bookmark this calendar year with two hundreds, at Sydney in his 
first knock and now at Melbourne at what may very well be his last if weather 
continues to intervene. 180 minutes, 13 fours the other numbers that matter. 
Running off the outside edge, there’s another two and it’s a very big over 
already with a ball to come and 12 netted. To be fair, wasn’t an innings 
without luck, including the shot to bring it up, a big inside edge. But he 
won’t mind.
 
38th over: Australia 165-1 (Warner 93, Khawaja 49). Davey is getting busy now. 
Enough of this respectful, watchful nonsense. His first scoring shot isn’t 
overly convincing, mind, pushing through gully (or thereabouts) at a very 
catchable enough height I fancy, had someone been right on the spot there. 
Still, it gets him four and into the 90s. He’s better off the back foot, 
forward of point for two more. A single ends the much more eventful over, into 
the covers. He keeps the strike and is within seven of a ton now. Won’t take 
long, he rarely does once getting this close.
 
37th over: Australia 158-1 (Warner 86, Khawaja 49). Chris Rogers being 
interesting on the radio, as he almost always us. Explaining that he prepared 
for batting by not drinking coffee before going out there in order to control 
his heart rate. He explains that Marcus Trescothick - his Somerset teammate 
from 2016 - does the opposite, by dunking a lot of Red Bull. Ball in hand, Amir 
is good enough to win Khawaja’s edge in another maiden. It fell short of the 
cordon. He looks the man most likely at the moment.

36th over: Australia 158-1 (Warner 86, Khawaja 49). Another maiden from 
Sohail, his second on the spin. No real sting out there at the moment following 
the Wahab Debacle. On this occasion it is Warner watching in defence 
throughout, before getting underneath a bouncer. I wish there was more to say 
about it. I really do.
 
35th over: Australia 158-1 (Warner 86, Khawaja 49). Unsurprisingly, Amir is 
back into the attack, replacing Wahab from the Great Southern Stand end. It’s a 
good return, forcing Warner to play without, beating him with one that darted 
away off the seam. A single behind point ensures that he retains the strike, 14 
from 100.
 
34th over: Australia 157-1 (Warner 85, Khawaja 49). A maiden from Sohail, but 
it’s easy peasy for Khawaja leaving and defending in rotation. Possible heavy 
thunderstorms tomorrow being reported by the ABC on their call. Hope not, or 
this could turn into a pretty dreary last couple of days. All the more reason 
for Warner to get a bit selfish here. With just the one Test ton in 2016 - 
coming with his first hit back in January - he has a chance to convert his 
earlier luck into a very big hand.

More on Mark Nicholas. He was treated by the Australian team doctor after the 
episode. He was on air as recently as the tea break, according to Andrew Wu on
twitter <https://twitter.com/wutube/status/813980959116644353>. Will keep you 
posted as we receive official updates.
 
33rd over: Australia 157-1 (Warner 85, Khawaja 49). Oh no. Wahab is really 
losing it here. Two more no-balls in the space of three attempts to begin his 
set. The first is another jaffa to Khawaja, colliding with his pad. There’s no 
appeal as the call comes early. It probably wasn’t out, but the very thought of 
it after knocking over Warner with one the previous over. He’s over by amile 
the second time. Ugly. This is an awful feeling for a bowler. Couple leg byes 
and a couple to Warner through cover.

Some other news from the press box. CA have advised that Mark Nicholas has 
been transported to hospital for the second time in the match, experiencing 
more abdominal pains.
 
32nd over: Australia 151-1 (Warner 83, Khawaja 48). “This is gentle bowling, 
isn’t it. Dying down the wicketkeeper, it doesn’t look like anything that’ll 
extract an error from the batsman.” That’s Dirk Nannes, who doesn’t think much 
of Sohail, running away from us at the Members’ End. He’s not wrong. Khawaja is 
very happy defending and leaving. A three to end the over down to third man - 
albeit relatively in control - moves the Australians beyond 150.

How’s this popping up on the scoreboard? Be still my beating heart.

<https://twitter.com/collinsadam/status/813979527718154240>  
31st over: Australia 147-1 (Warner 83, Khawaja 45). Oh no Wahab has bowled 
Warner with a no-ball. It is a complete debacle, the middle of three no-balls 
on the trot. He’s distraught. It was such a pearler of a delivery as well, an 
indipping yorker that you dream of as a quick. 150 clicks. He won’t bowl many 
better balls in his career. What can you say? The 100 run syand comes up 
Khawaja takes a single later in the over. After each legal delivery to finish 
the over - the trio of no-balls occurring on his second attempt at a legal 
delivery - his shoulders slump at the injustice of it all. Well, maybe not 
injustice. But it’s an awful game, sometimes (most of the time).
 
30th over: Australia 138-1 (Warner 80, Khawaja 42). Warne and Slater are 
pretty happy that Sohail is into the XI. Balance, and all that. On that note, 
I’m shifting over to the radio commentary. Where Dirk Nannes is in the middle 
of of a comprehensive unpacking of Sohail’s action. That’s better. The over 
itself? He won Warner’s inside edge to begin, the vice-captain then taking a 
couple through the cover. Takes a while to build up to top speed, big Sohail. 
But not known for his second (third, fourth) spells. I’m very fond of him.
 
29th over: Australia 135-1 (Warner 77, Khawaja 42). “It would be a miracle for 
Australia to win this game,” says Shane Warne on the telly. Not sure I’d go 
that far, but a long way to go that much is true. Huge Wahab shout for leg 
before but it is angling a long way down Warner’s legside. 148kph - serious 
heat. They aren’t going upstairs, so at least they’ve improved on the earlier 
review. Surely that’s the worst in the history of the DRS? I’m sure Russell 
dealt with this. Inside edge from Khawaja when he’s up the business end. That’s 
fast as well. Much better from the Pakistani quick.
 
Hello, sportsfans. 

Yes, it’s true we are probably draw bound. But David Warner’s having a party, 
so for that reason alone you can’t be better placed than the OBO for the 
protracted final session of this final day at theCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Ground. Especially now the sun is 
out.

Russ has put in a mighty stint at the northern end of the press box, and I’m 
happy to relieve him at the southern. I think he’s writing something about Big 
Josh Hazlewood, so keep an eye out for that later, his 100th Test wicket in the 
bag as well in that middle session.

Righto, we’re about five minutes away so let’s get to it. 
Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com 
<mailto:Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com> for your classiest nonsense. 
@collinsadam <http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam> for your low rent stuff. You 
know I trade in both. For now, have some culture so you can tell your mates you 
know at least one song from 2016 when Australia Day rolls around.
 Kylie & Jase forever.  
28th over: Australia 131-1 (Warner 77, Khawaja 39)

And that is that for the second session on day three. Azhar had another go 
with his leggies and there are a few single before Warner ends the session with 
a blazing cut through point, finishing as he played throughout his innings so 
far by picking up a boundary. Aside from the loss of Matt Renshaw, Australia 
have owned this session. I think we’re headed for a draw at the MCG, but make 
Adam Collins welcome when he arrives shortly.
 
27th over: Australia 125-1 (Warner 72, Khawaja 38)

We’ll have another over after all, with Amir getting through this one before 
the clock ticks over to 3:40pm local time. Adam Collins will be appearing from 
the bull pen after that and take you through to stumps. This time around it’s 
the tourists who wish the session would end. The Australians lost Matt Renshaw 
early but have consolidated brilliantly with this unbroken 79-run stand.
 
26th over: Australia 120-1 (Warner 68, Khawaja 37)

In what might be the second last over before tea, batting hero Azhar appears 
to replace Yasir with his own brand of leggies, but the result is not initially 
much different. Warner pulls two into the deep and there are plenty of singles 
on offer too. Amir will probably finish us off.

25th over: Australia 115-1 (Warner 64, Khawaja 36)

Amir has worked his way up to 141kmph now but he’s not extracting a worrying 
amount of bite or bounce from this pitch, so without tempting fate, I’m really 
starting to lose that gut feel about Australia crumpling into a heap and losing 
by an innings. It was probably a little pessimistic to start with. Amir strays 
outside off with a half-tracker and Khawaja caresses it wide of gully for four 
more.
 
24th over: Australia 111-1 (Warner 64, Khawaja 32)

As I feast on party pies, Warner and Khawaja tuck into Yasir. Warner hammers 
another full toss through cover and works a single, then Khawaja unfurls two 
cover drives of subtly differing class – one conventional, one square – to pick 
up two consecutive fours of his own. Australia thus pass 100 and this 
partnership moves from strength to strength.
 
23rd over: Australia 97-1 (Warner 59, Khawaja 23)

Mohammad Amir is back into the attack now and will probably get three over in 
before the break, though I must admit I’ve just missed most of his first over 
making a dash for the party pies and mini sausage rolls that just appeared. 
This is fearless work, of course, but a man can build up a certain level of 
hunger in the process.
