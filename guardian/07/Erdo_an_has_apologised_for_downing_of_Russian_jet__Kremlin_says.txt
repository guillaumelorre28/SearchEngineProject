The Kremlin has said that the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan>, has apologised over 
thedowning of a Russian jet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/nato-and-un-seek-calm-over-turkish-downing-of-russian-jet>
 last year that ruined the countries’ relations and highlighted the grave 
dangers of rising regional tensions over the war in Syria.

Erdoğan expressed regret to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin>, over the incident, 
insisting that Turkey “never had the desire or deliberate intention of shooting 
down the Russian federation’s plane” and was ready to do everything possible to 
restore friendly ties, according to a Kremlin statement on Monday.


“I once again express my sympathy and profound condolences to the family of 
the Russian pilot who was killed and I apologise to them,” Erdoğan reportedly 
wrote to Putin.

Last November, Turkish jets shot down a Russian bomber that Ankara said had 
crossed over from Syria, althoughRussia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> denied its plane had entered Turkish 
airspace. One of the two-man crew was killed by ground fire after parachuting 
out, and a Russian marine was killed in the ensuing rescue mission.

Ankara had argued that the Russian plane strayed into its airspace and ignored 
repeated warnings, but Russia insisted it did not cross the border and accused
Turkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> of a “planned provocation”.

The countries are on opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, with Ankara 
backing rebels fighting to toppleBashar al-Assad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad>, while Moscow is one of his 
last remaining allies.

Turkey’s Anadolu state news agency reported that presidential spokesman 
Ibrahim Kalin said Erdoğan had written to Putin to “express his regrets” about 
the downing of the warplane, but he did not explicitly confirm Erdoğan had 
apologised over the incident. “We are pleased to announce that Turkey and 
Russia have agreed to take necessary steps without delay to improve bilateral 
relations,” Kalin said.

According to the Kremlin, Erdoğan also said in his message that the 
authorities were probing a Turkish national allegedly responsible for the 
downing of the jet.

Turkey’s Hürriyet newspaper reported that on Monday a court released Alparslan 
Çelik, a Turk fighting in Syria who Russia suspects of killing the pilot as he 
parachuted to the ground, but said weapons charges against him had not been 
dropped.

The incident sparked animosity with Turkey. Russian state television ran 
negative reports about ancient invasions by Turkic peoples, while protesters 
attacked the Turkish embassy in Moscow. Russia also suspended flights to 
Turkey, a popular destination for Russian tourists, and even banned Turkish 
food imports.

Konstantin Kosachyov, who heads the foreign affairs committee in the upper 
house of the Russian parliament, said Russia would also expect a change in 
Turkish policy in Syria and Iraq. Moscow has accused Ankara of supporting
Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> and in December even 
claimed Erdoğan was personally involved in reselling Isis oil.

Turkey has called for the overthrow of Assad since the uprising began in 2011. 
Along with Saudi Arabia and Qatar it backs Islamist rebel groups fighting him 
but it denies links with Isis. Still, Russian and Iranian support has bolstered 
the Syrian leader, while Kurdish militia fighters have benefited from US 
backing as they fight Isis, bolstering their position adjacent to the Turkish 
border.

Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy chairman of the economic policy committee in the 
Russian lower house of parliament, said flights to Turkey could be quickly 
restored “if the Turks really did reconsider their position, apologised and are 
prepared for compensation”.

Alexander Shokin, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, said: “A beautiful life won’t start immediately, but step by 
step, as understanding is achieved over different questions, I think relations 
will be restored over the course of a few years.”


Moscow and Ankara remain fiercely at odds over the makeup of the Syrian 
opposition delegation to the stalled Geneva peace talks, as Russia presses hard 
for Syrian Kurdish participation, which is anathema to the Turks.


The move came as Turkey also announced the restoration of its diplomatic 
relations with Israel, which were downgraded amid a furious standoff in 2010 
when Israeli soldiers killed 10 Turkish activists aboard theMavi Marmara 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/israeli-attacks-gaza-flotilla-activists>
, part of a “freedom flotilla” sailing to Gaza.

Turkey originally demanded an apology and compensation and later added an end 
to Israel’s blockade of the border strip, which is ruled by the Islamist 
movement Hamas. It secured the first two and agreement by Israel to allow aid 
into Gaza, but delivered via the Israeli port of Ashdod.

Erdoğan: Turkish ties with Russia to normalise ‘rapidly’ – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jun/27/erdogan-turkish-ties-with-russia-to-normalise-rapidly-video>
Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yıldırım, said the blockade has been “largely 
lifted”. But Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, insisted that the 
“defensive maritime blockade,” intended to stop arms smuggling, remains in 
place.

This deal is a face-saver for both sides: economic advantages for Israel in 
the form of future gas exports via Turkey, the lessening of isolation for 
Turkey as well as an easing of the harsh humanitarian conditions for 1.8 
million Palestinians in Gaza.


Shortly after taking office last month Yıldırım said Turkey needed to 
“increase its friends and decrease its enemies”, in what appeared to be an 
admission that his predecessor’s policies had left the Nato member sidelined.

The agreement with Israel is likely to trigger the delivery of missile defence 
systems and armed drones that Turkey has been seeking for some time. In 1949, 
Turkey became the first Muslim country to recognise Israel.
