In fashion, there’s no party like a Stella McCartney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/stella-mccartney> party – and that was the 
case on Thursday night. For the launch of her first menswear collection, shown 
at London’s Abbey Road studios, made so famous by her father, the likes ofKate 
Moss <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss>, MIA, Orlando Bloom and 
Professor Green turned up, whileBeth Ditto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/nov/07/beth-ditto-fat-kate-moss-thrift-stores>
 and Darryl McDaniels, the “DMC” in Run DMC, performed.

Really – for once – celebrity attendees and performances weren’t the main 
event at this event. Instead it was the clothes: a long-awaited move into 
menswear. McCartney’s easy, wearable and fun aesthetic translates well here, as 
seen on models wearing long slouchy cardigans, souvenir jackets, mod-ish 
tailoring and her take on the football scarf. Here, she talks to us about 
menswear, her dad’s shirts and not taking fashion too seriously.

What were you thinking about when designing this collection?

My tailoring training at Savile Row is definitely evident, but it also has an 
element that is rooted in what my father wore. I’m not afraid to bring in 
colours and textures, and I’ve brought in a fit that is definitely inspired by 
the late 1960s; not too tight, not too baggy, just something that’s perfect on 
the body. We also referenced so many different aspects of London subculture, 
like the art, architecture, music. It’s a bit like a history of the British 
music scene, from the Beatles to 80s punk rock. I also have to look at my 
husband and great men of the world who have inspired me, both historically and 
today to tomorrow.

Did you enjoy the different challenges of designing for men?

When I’m designing for women I know exactly what I’m doing, I don’t even think 
about it, it’s so natural. So this is much more challenging for me mentally, 
and I like the challenge of the unknown. As a house, we don’t take fashion too 
seriously, so I wanted to be able to combine the classically masculine tailored 
pieces with the eclectic pieces that are inspired by a completely different 
history.

 The dad shirt, by Stella McCartney. 
What piece sums up Stella menswear?

It’s really hard to pinpoint one item. The shirt is inspired by a shirt my dad 
used to own that was very similar to it, so it has such a strong nostalgic 
feeling for me. It has the wonderful ability to have historical references but 
also freedom, and it has some kind of androgynous element that I think is a big 
influence from my personal background and the clothes my father wore. The 
non-leather sneakers are also a very significant part of the collection because 
of what sustainability and my ethics about using only vegan products means to 
me. This was something I really wanted to incorporate in the menswear, because 
I don’t find that an emphasis on sustainability is evident inmen’s fashion

 A Stella McCartney suit. 
Were there any muses you had in mind when designing the collection? Was your 
husband an influence?

I’m not a big muse-type, I’ve never been good at muses. I have a lot of 
friends that are actors or musicians, and it wasn’t like they directly came 
into the process of design, more just when we were working on it I could see 
them in it. But, yes, naturally when designing I thought of the men in my life.
