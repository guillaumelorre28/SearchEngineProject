For many parents – in certain areas of London, at least – the schoolgate 
politics of children’s birthday parties, presents and gift bags is already 
fraught.

Here’s another example to file under #middleclassproblems. Musician and 
presenter Myleene Klass (not short of a bob or two herself, most likely 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/18/myleene-klass-ed-miliband-mansion-tax>
) tweeted her dismay at being asked to contribute towards a Kindle and desk as 
“class birthday” gifts for two girls at her daughter’s school.

Klass posted the group email in which the request was made on Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/KlassMyleene/status/563050370927431680> (after changing 
the names) - along with #inbox #bonkers #schoolgates.

The email stated that two mothers “would prefer a class birthday gift for 
their daughters this year”. It goes on to say that one child wanted a Kindle, 
the other a desk.

Klass and other parents were invited to contribute a “suggested” £10, “via an 
envelope in your daughters school bag” if they preferred.

A second email stated: “From memory, about £10 seems to be a popular amount, 
but feel free to give what you like or indeed, to give your own gift.”

Klass made her feelings even more abundantly clear in a 2nd tweet

Glamour editor Jo Elvin probably summed up common reaction in this response.

@KlassMyleene <https://twitter.com/KlassMyleene> well this is a game changer. 
My daughter wants a trip to the maldives, preparing the class email now.

Last month the parents of a five-year-old made headlines after they were 
invoiced £15.95 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/19/five-year-old-misses-friends-birthday-party-and-has-to-pay-1595>
 for his failure to attend a birthday party in Plymouth.

In a recent Guardian Money piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/jan/17/four-year-old-birthday-parties-buy-presents>
, a parent asked: “My daughter has just turned four, and I’m now taking her to 
endless other four-year-olds’ parties – and have to buy gifts every time. It’s 
really starting to add up. What’s the ‘right’ amount to spend, what’s a good 
thing to buy, and would it be noticed if I didn’t buy anything? There’s never a 
thank you.”

The consensus appeared to be £5-£10, or less. Also, be creative – look for 
bargains, buy in bulk, recycle unwanted gifts, make your own.
