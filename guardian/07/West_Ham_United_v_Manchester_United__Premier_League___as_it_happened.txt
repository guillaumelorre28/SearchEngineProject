Full-time: West Ham United 0-2 Manchester United

Well, what an odd game. Mike Dean’s harsh sending off of Feghouli in the first 
half should have given Manchester United the impetus to race away with the 
game. But that didn’t happen. It took the introduction of Rashford and Mata to 
swing the game their way in the second half. West Ham can feel hard done by but 
it may be that Manchester United would have impressed 11 on 11 in the second 
half with Rashford up against Nordtveit. He absolutely took him to the 
cleaners. Oh, and one last thing having looked at the tackle from Feghouli on 
Jones again, you could argue both players could have been sent off. You could 
say it was a late tackle v excessive force. But anyway,Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have the Champions 
League places in sight … and momentum. Look out!

90+2 min: Man Utd will go within a point of fourth place in a minute. Six 
league wins on the bounce eh? That is momentum, all right.

90 min: Nordtveit, who has barely got close to Rashford this second half, 
dangles a leg out at the Man Utd winger and catches his heel. It’s a sore one 
and for that Nordtveit is given a deserved yellow card.

88 min: Lanzini is off and Ayew is on for West Ham. Lanzini was bright in 
spells. His shot in the first half was very close to giving his side a 1-0 lead.

87 min: “Is Antonio Valencia the longest serving stopgap in Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> history?” asks Matthew 
Pearson. “It’s a pretty prominent position, the right back for Man Utd, and 
he’s been there for ages. Moses and Milner have been pretty glorious examples 
of players moving further back and still influencing business at both ends. 
Valencia could light up a right wing elsewhere in the league.” It’s an 
interesting one. I can’t think of anyone else that has been shifted out of 
position and lasted so long. But isn’t he now just being considered a 
right-back? And are you only ever a stopgap when you shift backwards rather 
than forwards ala Paul Warhurst back in the day for Sheffield Wednesday?

83 min: Rashford, again, shows great composure after a burst down the left to 
hook the ball to the far post where Herrera volleys straight at Randolph, who 
deflects the ball out for a corner. The corner comes to nothing. I know he only 
came on in the second half but I’d give Rashford the man of the match award.

81 min: Nicholas offers some Mike Dean balance. “I might be a rare specie but 
I think Dean can justify that red card. Reckless tackle, feet off the ground, 
made contact and all for what might have been a goal kick to Utd.” Meanwhile, 
Fernandes is on for West Ham. Kouyate is off.

Goal! West Ham 0-2 Man Utd (Ibrahimovic 78)

That’s game over but Ibrahimovic is offside. The ball lands at the Swede’s 
feet after Herrera nicked the ball through to him with a bit of high-pressing. 
Zlatan is standing almost a foot off but with his back to goal he turns and 
slams home from 12 yards and immediately looks sheepishly over at the linesman. 
Ah well. Some go for you some go against you. He won’t care. Eat your own 
balls. That’s 18 for the season.

74 min: Rashford pulls the ball back to Pogba on the left. Pogba shapes to 
roll it into the corner. It looks to be heading there but somehow deviates from

72 min: Cresswell goes scuttling down the inside-left channel after a 
promising West Ham attack but, at the vital moment, he loses his footing in the 
area and the ball goes rolling away for a goal-kick. It’s the return of the 
London Stadium curse.

70 min: “Mike Dean is out of control and incompetent,” writes JR in Illinois. 
“That is a very bad combination, as the United States is about to discover. I 
wish somebody could do something about it but it doesn’t look like happening.” 
He’s not incompetent (Dean that is). But he does like the sound of his own 
whistle and the glare of the spotlight a little more than a referee should. As 
for Trump, I’m not going there.

68 min: Carroll gallops on, all beard and hair, having replaced Payet, who 
must be goosed given that he is perhaps the best-placed West Ham player to find 
Carroll’s head with a set-piece delivery.

67 min: Herrera finds Pogba after cutting in from the right. Pogba strides 
away from his marker and tries to pass the ball into the bottom-left corner but 
his attempt misses by a couple of inches. He had Randolph worried there. He was 
at full stretch.

64 min: It was a goal made by Mourinho really. Carrick, having been shifted to 
centre back, found one substitute, who found another. Do you remember when

Goal! West Ham 0-1 Man Utd (Mata 62)

And West Ham pay the price. Carrick curls a ball out to Rashford on the left 
wing. The youngster speeds away to the touchline and shows great composure to 
cut inside instead of crossing (sitting two West Ham players down) before 
pulling the ball back to Mata, just outside the six-yard box, who sweeps home 
with his left foot.

59 min: Mkhitaryan and Mata try and fail to combine in midfield and then Rojo 
plays an awful pass across the backline that allows West Ham to pick off 
possession. Payet slides in Antonio behind Carrick and Jones, who play a 
dreadful offside trap. Antonio is one on one with De Gea. He shapes to curl 
around the Spaniard but he’s too square and sidefoots his shot from 16 yards 
into the goalkeeper’s midriff. What a chance! Bilic leaps up in despair on the 
sidelines.

55 min: Well, Mourinho hasn’t got the response he wanted at all. If anything 
West Ham are pressing higher up the field at the moment. A tactic that will be 
their undoing if they don’t rein it in.

52 min: Antonio heads wide after a West Ham free-kick on the right that is 
curled, deliciously, into the back post by Payet. It’s the kind of chance he 
usually gobbles up. The look of disbelief on his face as he walks away tells 
you how disappointed he is that he didn’t connect with it properly.

49 min: Kouyate fells Mkhitaryan with a dire challenge. It was a clumsy tackle 
from the side in which his right leg went over the ball and brought the Man Utd 
player down. Mkhitaryan is lucky that the tackle is in front of him and the 
full force doesn’t impact on the side of his leg. It’s a clear yellow card, 
maybe even a red. Does Mike Dean book him? Of course he doesn’t.

47 min: Nordveit plays a short back pass that Ibrahimovic may have got to 
about 10 years ago. But, at 35 years of age and despite his healthy lifestyle 
and boundless self-belief, his legs don’t move quite the way they used to and 
Randolph shows great alertness to slide in to clear the danger.

46 min: Lingard fouls Cresswell after an opening minute of the second half in 
which it is clear that Mourinho has given his Man Utd players a verbal rocket. 
They’re scuttling around with much more urgency.

Peep!

45 min: It’s the second half! Darmian has been replaced by Mata. Carrick goes 
to centre back and Rojo goes to left back for Man Utd. Will Mata find a hole in 
the West Ham defensive ranks?

So, surely Martial will emerge for Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> at some stage in the 
second half.They need an injection of pace and Mourinho made a point of getting 
his subs warmed up before the first half had finished.

As for West Ham, Obiang has marshalled the backline quite superbly. It would 
be some feat if they can hold out for almost 80 minutes with 10 men.

And, I have MBMed almost 145 minutes of football today without seeing a single 
goal. I haven’t got much in the way of nice things to say about 2017 so far.

I would whole-heartedly lend my backing to this:
Bold Steve (@ParlourGamesN5) 
@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> We need some sort of 
campaign to allow Mike Dean to ref Boca Juniors vs. River Plate. So much 
potential there.

Half-time: West Ham United 0-0 Manchester United

A half in which Mike Dean is the chief protagonist is never a good thing. 
Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have 
done nothing with their man advantage while West Ham have probably created more 
half-chances. That said, Man Utd should be 1-0 up. How Valencia and Lingard 
both failed to score from about three yards out will remain a mystery for years 
to come.

45+2 min: The ball is curled in with pace and West ham players call for a 
handball as the ball squirts out of a group of players. Mike Dean blows his 
whistle but it’s for half-time.

45 min: Mourinho has buggered off down the tunnel two minutes early. Maybe 
he’s hoping to locate Fergie’s hairdryer in the kit back and see if it still 
works. Jones has just shoved Antonio on the touchline and given Payet a great 
angle to whip a ball in.

44 min: Lanzini picks the ball up on the edge of the area. He throws his 
shoulder and cuts back on to his right foot and curls a wicked shot towards the 
top-right corner that De Gea does ever so well to claw away for a corner. The 
crowd roar and Bilic asks for more noise. Meanwhile, Mourinho has sent all his 
subs out to warm up. He’s not happy with this from Man Utd. They’ve looked half 
asleep.

35 min: Wow! Just wow! What a save! What a miss! After United switch the play 
left and right Mkhitaryan drills a ball across goal that Valencia somehow hits 
straight at Randolph when the goal was gaping. The ball spills out to Lingard, 
who only has to tap home, but instead he somehow finds the left-hand post 
before the ball rolls back to Randolph. Fantastic save from Randolph, mind, but 
bloody hell.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic on target as Manchester United beat West Ham

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/west-ham-united-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report> 
Well, what an odd game. Mike Dean’s harsh sending off of Feghouli in the first 
half should have given Manchester United the impetus to race away with the 
game. But that didn’t happen. It took the introduction of Rashford and Mata to 
swing the game their way in the second half. West Ham can feel hard done by but 
it may be that Manchester United would have impressed 11 on 11 in the second 
half with Rashford up against Nordtveit. He absolutely took him to the 
cleaners. Oh, and one last thing having looked at the tackle from Feghouli on 
Jones again, you could argue both players could have been sent off. You could 
say it was a late tackle v excessive force. But anyway,Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have the Champions 
League places in sight … and momentum. Look out!
 
90+2 min: Man Utd will go within a point of fourth place in a minute. Six 
league wins on the bounce eh? That is momentum, all right.
 
90 min: Nordtveit, who has barely got close to Rashford this second half, 
dangles a leg out at the Man Utd winger and catches his heel. It’s a sore one 
and for that Nordtveit is given a deserved yellow card.
 
88 min: Lanzini is off and Ayew is on for West Ham. Lanzini was bright in 
spells. His shot in the first half was very close to giving his side a 1-0 lead.
 
87 min: “Is Antonio Valencia the longest serving stopgap in Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> history?” asks Matthew 
Pearson. “It’s a pretty prominent position, the right back for Man Utd, and 
he’s been there for ages. Moses and Milner have been pretty glorious examples 
of players moving further back and still influencing business at both ends. 
Valencia could light up a right wing elsewhere in the league.” It’s an 
interesting one. I can’t think of anyone else that has been shifted out of 
position and lasted so long. But isn’t he now just being considered a 
right-back? And are you only ever a stopgap when you shift backwards rather 
than forwards ala Paul Warhurst back in the day for Sheffield Wednesday?
 
86 min: Cresswell is crowded out on the left wing. Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> regain possession and 
Carrick orchestrates another spell of lengthy possession that will help see the 
game out.
 
83 min: Rashford, again, shows great composure after a burst down the left to 
hook the ball to the far post where Herrera volleys straight at Randolph, who 
deflects the ball out for a corner. The corner comes to nothing. I know he only 
came on in the second half but I’d give Rashford the man of the match award.
 
81 min: Nicholas offers some Mike Dean balance. “I might be a rare specie but 
I think Dean can justify that red card. Reckless tackle, feet off the ground, 
made contact and all for what might have been a goal kick to Utd.” Meanwhile, 
Fernandes is on for West Ham. Kouyate is off.
 
79 min: That Zlatan goal was reminiscent of a killer forehand after a ball is 
called out in tennis. The kind that is hit with the wild abandon that comes 
with knowing what you are about to do won’t count. Only that one did.
 
That’s game over but Ibrahimovic is offside. The ball lands at the Swede’s 
feet after Herrera nicked the ball through to him with a bit of high-pressing. 
Zlatan is standing almost a foot off but with his back to goal he turns and 
slams home from 12 yards and immediately looks sheepishly over at the linesman. 
Ah well. Some go for you some go against you. He won’t care. Eat your own 
balls. That’s 18 for the season.

74 min: Rashford pulls the ball back to Pogba on the left. Pogba shapes to 
roll it into the corner. It looks to be heading there but somehow deviates from 
its line a few yards from goal and slides the wrong side of the far post.
 
72 min: Cresswell goes scuttling down the inside-left channel after a 
promising West Ham attack but, at the vital moment, he loses his footing in the 
area and the ball goes rolling away for a goal-kick. It’s the return of the 
London Stadium curse.
 
70 min: “Mike Dean is out of control and incompetent,” writes JR in Illinois. 
“That is a very bad combination, as the United States is about to discover. I 
wish somebody could do something about it but it doesn’t look like happening.” 
He’s not incompetent (Dean that is). But he does like the sound of his own 
whistle and the glare of the spotlight a little more than a referee should. As 
for Trump, I’m not going there.
 
68 min: Carroll gallops on, all beard and hair, having replaced Payet, who 
must be goosed given that he is perhaps the best-placed West Ham player to find 
Carroll’s head with a set-piece delivery.
 
67 min: Herrera finds Pogba after cutting in from the right. Pogba strides 
away from his marker and tries to pass the ball into the bottom-left corner but 
his attempt misses by a couple of inches. He had Randolph worried there. He was 
at full stretch.
 
65 min: Mourinho makes an immediate change. Carrick moves back into midfield 
as Mkhitaryan is replaced by Smalling, who goes to centre-back.
 
64 min: It was a goal made by Mourinho really. Carrick, having been shifted to 
centre back, found one substitute, who found another. Do you remember when 
people were saying Mourinho had forgotten how to manage?
 
And West Ham pay the price. Carrick curls a ball out to Rashford on the left 
wing. The youngster speeds away to the touchline and shows great composure to 
cut inside instead of crossing (sitting two West Ham players down) before 
pulling the ball back to Mata, just outside the six-yard box, who sweeps home 
with his left foot.

59 min: Mkhitaryan and Mata try and fail to combine in midfield and then Rojo 
plays an awful pass across the backline that allows West Ham to pick off 
possession. Payet slides in Antonio behind Carrick and Jones, who play a 
dreadful offside trap. Antonio is one on one with De Gea. He shapes to curl 
around the Spaniard but he’s too square and sidefoots his shot from 16 yards 
into the goalkeeper’s midriff. What a chance! Bilic leaps up in despair on the 
sidelines.
 
57 min: Rashford is on and Lingard is off. Will the precocity of youth give 
this game the jolt it needs?
 
55 min: Well, Mourinho hasn’t got the response he wanted at all. If anything 
West Ham are pressing higher up the field at the moment. A tactic that will be 
their undoing if they don’t rein it in.
 
54 min: “I’d like to see Mike Dean referee a battle between all the different 
houses in Game of Thrones,” writes Chris Gardiner. “Early red for Jamie 
Lassiter and John Snow. Show them who’s the real hero.” Readers? I’ve never 
really got into it. Westworld’s my box-set companion at the moment.
 
52 min: Antonio heads wide after a West Ham free-kick on the right that is 
curled, deliciously, into the back post by Payet. It’s the kind of chance he 
usually gobbles up. The look of disbelief on his face as he walks away tells 
you how disappointed he is that he didn’t connect with it properly.
 
49 min: Kouyate fells Mkhitaryan with a dire challenge. It was a clumsy tackle 
from the side in which his right leg went over the ball and brought the Man Utd 
player down. Mkhitaryan is lucky that the tackle is in front of him and the 
full force doesn’t impact on the side of his leg. It’s a clear yellow card, 
maybe even a red. Does Mike Dean book him? Of course he doesn’t.
 
47 min: Nordveit plays a short back pass that Ibrahimovic may have got to 
about 10 years ago. But, at 35 years of age and despite his healthy lifestyle 
and boundless self-belief, his legs don’t move quite the way they used to and 
Randolph shows great alertness to slide in to clear the danger.
 
46 min: Lingard fouls Cresswell after an opening minute of the second half in 
which it is clear that Mourinho has given his Man Utd players a verbal rocket. 
They’re scuttling around with much more urgency.
 
45 min: It’s the second half! Darmian has been replaced by Mata. Carrick goes 
to centre back and Rojo goes to left back for Man Utd. Will Mata find a hole in 
the West Ham defensive ranks?
 
So, surely Martial will emerge for Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> at some stage in the 
second half.They need an injection of pace and Mourinho made a point of getting 
his subs warmed up before the first half had finished.

As for West Ham, Obiang has marshalled the backline quite superbly. It would 
be some feat if they can hold out for almost 80 minutes with 10 men.

And, I have MBMed almost 145 minutes of football today without seeing a single 
goal. I haven’t got much in the way of nice things to say about 2017 so far. 
 
I would whole-heartedly lend my backing to this:
Bold Steve (@ParlourGamesN5) 
@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> We need some sort of 
campaign to allow Mike Dean to ref Boca Juniors vs. River Plate. So much 
potential there.

 <https://twitter.com/ParlourGamesN5/status/815980976409079808> 
I would quite like to see Dean sniff the cordite in the air and give this 
atmosphere <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JT4EvEdY2w> a dismissive look.
 
A half in which Mike Dean is the chief protagonist is never a good thing. 
Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have 
done nothing with their man advantage while West Ham have probably created more 
half-chances. That said, Man Utd should be 1-0 up. How Valencia and Lingard 
both failed to score from about three yards out will remain a mystery for years 
to come.
 
45+2 min: The ball is curled in with pace and West ham players call for a 
handball as the ball squirts out of a group of players. Mike Dean blows his 
whistle but it’s for half-time.
 
45 min: Mourinho has buggered off down the tunnel two minutes early. Maybe 
he’s hoping to locate Fergie’s hairdryer in the kit back and see if it still 
works. Jones has just shoved Antonio on the touchline and given Payet a great 
angle to whip a ball in.
 
44 min: Lanzini picks the ball up on the edge of the area. He throws his 
shoulder and cuts back on to his right foot and curls a wicked shot towards the 
top-right corner that De Gea does ever so well to claw away for a corner. The 
crowd roar and Bilic asks for more noise. Meanwhile, Mourinho has sent all his 
subs out to warm up. He’s not happy with this from Man Utd. They’ve looked half 
asleep.
 
42 min: Darmian’s hip sends Antonio flying into the air. Darmian is booked. It 
probably didn’t warrant a booking but … Mike Dean.
 
40 min: Nordveit has caught Mkhitaryan with a late tackle over by the 
touchline. Dean should book Nordveit but he doesn’t. Funny that.

<https://twitter.com/jiffington/status/815978317614641152>  
39 min: Ibrahimovic slams a shot way over the bar after beating West Ham’s 
offside trap.
 
35 min: Wow! Just wow! What a save! What a miss! After United switch the play 
left and right Mkhitaryan drills a ball across goal that Valencia somehow hits 
straight at Randolph when the goal was gaping. The ball spills out to Lingard, 
who only has to tap home, but instead he somehow finds the left-hand post 
before the ball rolls back to Randolph. Fantastic save from Randolph, mind, but 
bloody hell.
