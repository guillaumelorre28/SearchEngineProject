The recipe

Soak 125g of moong dal – skinned and split mung beans – for 30 minutes in warm 
water.

Peel and roughly chop 1 medium onion, then cook it in 30g of melted butter 
over a moderate heat until translucent. Add 1 tbsp of mustard seeds and cook 
until they start to pop, then stir in 1 crushed clove of garlic. Peel and grate 
a 50g lump of ginger, stir into the onions then add a finely chopped red 
chilli. Continue cooking for 5 minutes, stirring regularly.

Stir in the contents of a 400g can of chopped tomatoes and a can of water and 
bring to the boil. Season with salt and black pepper then stir in the soaked 
and drained mung beans and leave to cook at a calm simmer for 30 minutes. Check 
the liquid level regularly. Lastly, stir in 1 tbsp of garam masala.

Place 2 large, flat mushrooms in a foil-lined oven dish. Baste them all over 
with 50g of melted butter, the juice of 1 lemon and 5 tbsp of water. Season, 
then scrunch the edges of the foil together to loosely seal. Bake in a 
preheated oven at 200C/gas mark 6 for about 20-25 minutes, basting as necessary.

Check the dal for seasoning, then divide between 2 large bowls, place a baked 
mushroom on top and spoon over any baking juices. Enough for 2.

The trick

Soaking the moong dal reduces the cooking time considerably, but it is not 
entirely necessary. It is worth keeping an eye on the liquid levels while they 
are cooking should you choose not to pre-soak the beans, topping up with a 
little vegetable stock or water as necessary.

The twist

Use small brown lentils instead of mung beans. Instead of serving with baked 
mushrooms use the dal as a stuffing for baked aubergines, stirring the 
aubergine flesh into the dal as it cooks.
