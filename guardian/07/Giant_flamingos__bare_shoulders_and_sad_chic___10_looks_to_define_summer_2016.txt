If you show one thing, show your shoulders

Man Repeller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/01/man-repeller-look-milan-fashion-week>
 has known this for about three summers and the Topshop faithful knew it last 
July, but in 2016 the style floodgates are wide open on the off-the-shoulder 
top. The evidence is all over the high street (even an unloved mannequin in the 
side window of John Lewis is showing off her plastic deltoids). It’s a look 
that has found its way into the theatre-land too – check outLily James as 
Juliet at the Garrick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/26/romeo-and-juliet-review-branagh-lily-james-richard-madden-garrick-theatre>
. In a few days I’ll bet that the Worthy Farm crowd will find shoulder dancing 
even more uncomfortable than usual. When a look starts to pervade the high 
street, and high and low culture, it becomes an unstoppable force. Which is no 
bad thing in the case of the off-the-shoulder top. Get the right bra and 
welcome one into your wardrobe because – hand on heart – it really does suit 
grown-ups who can afford a white wine from lower down the menu just as much as 
it suits festival-going Hadid wannabees.

 Hot item ... the Sunnylife inflatable flamingo pool toy 
Adopt a giant flamingo

To have any shot at winning summer 2016, the first thing you need to get your 
head round is this: it’s not about your outfit any more, it’s about your visual 
brand. Your clothes are only part of the picture. Literally. Your handbag and 
your shoes still matter, but the most important accessories are the props you 
use to raise your image-making game. AtSelfridges’ new Body Studio 
<http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/article/body-studio>, the hottest 
sell-out item isn’t a cut-out one piece athleisure-themed 
professional-butterfly-stroke standard swimsuit or a pair of limited-edition 
acupressure-enabled intelligent yoga shoes, but a Sunnylife inflatable flamingo 
(£55). A cartoon-sized, Instagram-friendly pool toy is an essential for this 
summer’s photo album. The reference to Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris’s first 
loved-up social media appearance – the modern equivalent of the 
engagement-announcement column – adds layers of social-media in-joking on which 
you can riff via hashtags. You will need to move quickly to secure the last 
remaining stock of black and gold swans. And no, the lilo from the beach shop 
that also sells Magnums and Piz Buin will not cut it.

Dress like a cloud

For men, summer ’16 has never been easier to knock out of the park. 
Essentially, if you want some style inspiration, just look up. With a colour 
scheme of blues and whites, tonal intermingling and changeable patterns, 
dressing like the sky on a sunny day should be your go-to look. TryFear of God’s
 <https://fearofgod.com/collections/denim> Selvedge indigo blue jeans with 
their stonewashed tone and judicious rips that make the wearer look like they 
have been involved in a barrel fight in a western. Paired with a white T-shirt 
(this season, fashion is loving pockets – seeLevi’s 1950s Sportwear one 
<http://www.levi.com/GB/en_GB/mens-clothing-t-shirts-polos/p/408500074>) and 
some Adidas trainers, and you’ve got the look thatKanye West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest> and both Justins (Timberlake and 
Bieber) have given their seal of approval to.

 So organised, so confident ... Chloë Sevigny and bag at Cannes. Photograph:

Carry a pointless handbag

Rather than the status stiletto, the real mark of a woman in control is the 
silly little bag. I long to be one of them – to walk through life likeChloë 
Sevigny did on the red carpet at Cannes 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2016/05/cannes-red-carpet-best-dressed-2016#44>
, like you don’t need keys, panic tights, a bronzer compact and very big phone. 
To be so organised, so confident, so relaxed that either you have no need for 
top-up makeup and a disparate wodge of Leon receipts, or that you had enough 
time before this fabulous summer party to go home first, where you took a 
leisurely shower and dropped off your day tote before making your way into town 
with nothing but a bag the size of a kitten to weigh you down. Imagine. Imagine 
feeling that free.

 Effortless cool ... the Aladdin slipper 
Get a pair of Aladdin slippers

I’m running (well, shuffling) with the flat mules trend for summer. You know, 
the kind that are one part Aladdin, one partHugh Hefner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/hugh-hefner>. In fact I am wearing some 
right now – black satin and leather from Topshop. What’s more, these have 
already sold out – proof, if proof were needed, that this trend has legs 
(feet). I can’t pretend to be an early adopter – obviously that was Alexa back 
in the first round of the Gucci backless loafer last year – but the drip drip 
fashion effect is slow and it’s clear we needed time to compute how a (let’s 
face it) ugly shoe is this season’s must-have .

Why should you buy a pair? For starters, they look good with frayed jeans, or 
silky pyjama style-trousers (which figures, given they’re sort of bedroom 
shoes). Plus doing away with heels at posh events is a major liberating bonus: 
it makes you feel allSofia Coppola 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/sofia-coppola>, ie: ridiculously cool. Asos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/asos> and All Saints have excellent 
styles in black, white and chambray. Topshop have their own take on the Gucci 
loafer and Zara have a hybrid slipper/mule version to be worn with the back 
trodden down. The only drawback is that you can’t run for a bus in them ... 
which, I guess is why Aladdin had the carpet.

 Dress like a clown ... Alexa Chung. Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/Rex/

Embrace sad chic

The key to nailing this look is to focus less on “circus clown” and more on 
Pierrot <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierrot> – because who says sad can’t be 
chic? Swap last season’s polo necks for high neck ruffles (plenty of those over 
atArchive by Alexa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/13/the-alexa-effect-behind-the-scenes-at-the-launch-of-archivebyalexa>
), with hems hung loose over wide-leg, cropped summer trousers. Additional 
frills should be big and unapologetic – thinkJane Fonda at this year’s Golden 
Globes <http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/01/jane-fonda-golden-globes-dress>
, orMadonna at her Tears of a Clown concert 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35783922>, minus the rag doll 
stripes – and never mistaken for peplum (still awful). That pom-pom from last 
year’s beanie hat? Now it’s on your bag – seeBella Hadid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/bella-hadid>. Last summer’s dungarees are 
also making a return 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/26/minions-alexa-chung-dungarees-70s-prints-catwalk-off-duty>
, but slouchier, more relaxed – perfect for clowning around. Needless to say, 
everything’s monochrome, apart from your makeup, and even that’s not far off. 
Accessorise with the moon.

 Mass appeal ... the Gigi and Bella Hadid look. Photograph: Taylor

Pretend you’re a Kardashian

We haven’t had a super-stylist since Rachel Zoe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/04/usa.fashionandstyle>, she of the 
problematic mid-00s Skinny Chic, which was partHalston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandhealth/gallery/2008/feb/05/fashion>, part 
boho, all waif. This summer’s style svengali is arguablyMonica Rose 
<http://www.monicarose.com/>, an LA-based stylist you probably haven’t heard 
of, but who is responsible for that Kardashian/Hadid sisters look – tight 
dresses, criss-cross tie tops and tenty-jackets paired with over-the-knee 
boots, all in muted tones – which has gone palpably mass. It sounds cheap, 
young and dated, but in fact strikes a delicate balance betweenbodycon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/08/fashion.hadleyfreeman> 
and fetishwear, all with a knowing nod to the 1990s. It’s sexy but PG, and 
celebrates the “female form” in a way Zoe didn’t (some shape is required to 
pull off this look). What’s more, such is the power of Rose that, despite 
resistance, that look has shifted fromBalmain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/20/kardashian-couture-balmain-buzz-olivier-rousteing-fashion-social-media-star>
 to current season Topshop, H&M and Zara. Did you think about buying a choker 
yet? Well then, there you go.

 The year of the Gazelle? Photograph: Alamy 
Men, women, wear Gazelles

If the summer of 2014 was peak Stan Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/22/2015-stan-smith-went-mass-adidas-sneakers-trainer>
, and the summer of 2015 was post-peak Stan Smith (Adidas tried to make 
Superstars a thing again last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/06/are-adidas-superstars-set-to-be-the-new-stan-smiths>
 but failed because no one has pulled off plastic-toecaps sinceKareem-Abdul 
Jabbar 
<https://newrepublic.com/article/116549/basketball-history-through-its-sneakers-curated-slam-magazine>
 andReverend Run <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/18/popandrock>), 
then this year, the German sportswear giant hopes will be the year of the 
Gazelle. Adidas are re-releasing the 90s version of their half-century-old 
classic – just in time for the perfect trainers’n’haircuts storm of English, 
Welsh and Irish football fans decamping en-masse to France for this summer’s 
Eurosand the Stone Roses returning with a run of stadium shows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/02/stone-roses-announce-three-uk-headline-shows-manchester-t-in-the-park>
 and – probably –their third coming on record 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/14/stone-roses-preparing-release-third-album>
. The joy of the Gazelle – like the Stan Smith – is that they are the perfect 
slimline shape, go with absolutely anything, and yet have been on the periphery 
long enough for them to look fresh. I’ll be wearing them with slim-fit jeans 
with roll-ups, or, if it’s sunny, a pair of tailored shorts. For women, embrace 
your inner The Girlie Show and wear them withthis season’s 1990s slip dress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/07/the-big-reveal-deconstructing-the-slip-dress>

 Hot pink lips ... Photograph: George Caswell/Getty Images 
Go back to the fuchsia

This isn’t a look for wallflowers, but then summer isn’t the season to be 
wilting in a corner hoping to go unnoticed. And so, to hotpink lips 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/29/the-best-pink-lipstick>. 
The easiest way to embrace the sun without the horror of actually taking your 
tights off? Accept that fuchsia is the future. Broadcast it, quite literally, 
on your mouth. It’s a statement that isn’t just for the evening or to be made 
in a mimsy coral – you want a bright, lurid, slash of daytime candypop. Think
RuPaul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/03/rupaul-drag-is-dangerous-we-are-making-fun-of-everything>
, a deep matte disco, rather than anything frosted, sheer or super glossy. You 
want high colour pigment and low maintenance, in which case Mac’s popstar 
colour palette seems an easy choice. This is a look better done in luxe, as 
shown on theTopshop Unique <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/topshop> 
catwalk. ThinkCharlotte Tilbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/27/charlotte-tilbury-fashion-celebrity-oscar-red-carpet>
 (Lost Cherry) andTom Ford <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tom-ford>

Get a charming bucket hat

Since its revival a few years back (thanks to the likes of Rihanna and Earl 
Sweatshirt),the bucket hat <http:// 
http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jul/15/rihanna-bucket-hat-fashion-trend-2014-world-cup>
 has proved that it’s not just a whimsical throwback but a wardrobe staple that 
has the ability to be reinvented for all weather conditions. At the menswear 
shows, Tourne de Transmission paired it with an oversize sweater and minimal 
Converse while Nasir Mazhar featured a bright blue bucket hat at his show, worn 
with matching shorts (and no top). The bucket still does what it’s always done: 
Reni-like carefree charm, but its practical ability to be worn as both an 
accessory and a signature means it’s slightly edging the dad-cap out of the 
summer hat supremacy.
