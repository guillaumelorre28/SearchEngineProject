A new campaign that aims to counter images of an “all white” Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> is to be launched on 
Thursday to increase the number of black and ethnic minority families portrayed 
enjoying the festive period.

A series of images of black and ethnic minority families doing things such as 
wrapping Christmas presents or decorating a tree will be made available on 
social media platforms under the hashtag #ChristmasSoWhite in a bid to increase 
the diversity of holiday images.

Nadya Powell, an advertising consultant, was inspired to start the project 
when looking for images for a school website project on favourite things at 
Christmas. She was searching for snowball fights to reflect the choice of her 
six-year-old daughter’s friend, Sara. “I looked at white family upon white 
family and then looked at Sara, who is black,” said Powell. “I asked her to 
choose a picture, and she chose the backs of the family’s heads.

“She was not seeing anything that looked like her and I realised she never 
did. This beautiful little girl is growing up in a world where on a daily basis 
she doesn’t see people like her in any media, where a perfect Christmas is a 
white Christmas.”

Powell believes that Christmas has somehow become linked with the idea of 
white people and snow. Online searches for families wrapping presents or 
throwing snowballs produce results that are almost entirely white models.

Powell teamed up with Looks Like Me <http://lookslikeme.co.uk/>, a modelling 
agency that was started because the founder’s daughter wanted to be white “like 
all the girls in the magazines”, to add balance to the overwhelmingly whiteness 
of most Christmas images.

The group is also talking to photography distribution platforms about access 
to the images. Shot by the photographer Helen Marsden, the images of families 
will also be available on the websitewww.christmassowhite.com 
<https://www.christmassowhite.com/> from Thursday. 

The campaign has been financed so far by eight large media and marketing 
groups including Google, MediaCom, Saatchi & Saatchi and Edelman. In an email 
Karen Blackett, chairwoman of MediaCom, said: “This campaign is long overdue 
and is so needed.”
