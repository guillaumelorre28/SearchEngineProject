The beauty of this soup is all in the finishing. First, enrichening the soup 
with egg yolk instead of cream brings a silkiness that rounds the dish off 
perfectly. Second, the mint brings a fresh lightness to the soup that balances 
the filling rice.

Serves 6

½ tbsp cumin seeds
750g carrots, chopped
30g butter
80g rice
250ml milk
1.2 litres light chicken or veg stock
2 egg yolks
Small handful of mint, chopped 
Sprinkling of paprika

1 Toast the cumin seeds in a dry pan until you can smell their flavour, then 
crush with the side of a knife.2 Wash and roughly chop the carrots into 3cm 
chunks, then sweat them on a medium heat in the butter for 10-15 minutes.3 Cook 
the rice in boiling salted water for 12 minutes or until ready, then drain.4 
Once the carrots are beginning to go golden, cover with the milk and stock, 
bring to the boil and simmer until tender. This will take about 10 minutes.5 
Blend the soup to a rough consistency, then tip back into the pan and add the 
rice and cumin. Simmer for a few more minutes.6 Pull off the heat, whisk in the 
yolks one by one, stir in the chopped mint, season well and serve immediately 
with a sprinkle of paprika.
