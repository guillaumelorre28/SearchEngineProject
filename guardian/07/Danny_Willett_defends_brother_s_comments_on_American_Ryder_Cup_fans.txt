Danny Willett <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/danny-willett> has said his 
brother Peter’s pre-Ryder Cup criticism of American supporters was backed up by 
the behaviour of some supporters at Hazeltine.

The Masters champion endured a difficult weekend as Europe crashed to a 17-11 
defeat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/02/usa-win-ryder-cup-rory-mcilroy-europe>
, losing his singles match 5&4 against Brooks Koepka on Sunday. That came after 
his brother had provoked a strong reaction from the home team when hewrote an 
article 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/29/danny-willett-ryder-cup-harder-brother-foolish-words>
 for a US golf magazine which referred to American fans as “cretins” and “fat, 
stupid, greedy, classless, bastards”.

“Tried my best but played poorly,” he wrote on Twitter. “Unfortunately some 
American fans showed that @P_J_Willett was in fact correct. Nothing to blame my 
bad play on.. But still shows that sometimes fans don’t know when to call it a 
day.. Shame really!!”

The 29-year-old from Sheffield had apologised for his brother’s comments 
earlier in the week, sayingthat he was “disappointed”

 Peter had written the article.

Willett, who was making his Ryder Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rydercup> debut after winning at Augusta in 
April, came away without a single point from his three matches as Europe were 
beaten for the first time since 2008. Afterwards, he was asked to assess his 
performance and gave an honest summation.
