The recipe

Place 4 tbsp of cornflour on a plate. Beat two eggs in shallow dish and tip 
100g of crisp coarse breadcrumbs on to a plate.

Drain 400g of chickpeas and tip them into the bowl of a food processor. Add a 
peeled clove of garlic then process to a smooth, soft paste with 6 tbsp of 
olive oil. Stir in the juice of a small lemon, 1 tbsp of tahini and a handful 
of dill.

Wipe 250g of courgettes, slice them in half then into short lengths and then 
into finger-sized batons. Warm enough groundnut or vegetable oil to deep fry 
the courgettes then roll them first in the cornflour, then the beaten egg and 
lastly the crisp breadcrumbs. As the oil becomes hot enough, lower the 
courgettes, a few a time, into the oil and let them fry for 3 or 4 minutes 
until crisp outside and soft within. Drain on kitchen paper and serve with the 
dill hummus. Enough for 2.

The trick

If your oil is too hot, the crumbs will cook before the courgette inside is 
tender. Test the heat of the oil by using a small cube of bread. If it turns 
golden within 30 seconds the oil is too hot. Your courgettes need a good 3 or 4 
minutes to cook.

The twist

Use a tempura batter instead of breadcrumbs (80g flour and 20g cornflour to 
175ml ice-cold water). Serve the hot fritters with a garlic mayonnaise or 
cucumber tzatziki. Make a beetroot hummus instead, using baked and peeled 
beetroots in place of half of the chickpeas.
