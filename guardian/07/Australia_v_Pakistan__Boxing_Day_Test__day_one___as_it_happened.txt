I think that’s about enough from me for today. This blog will be up and 
running from 9.30am tomorrow, hopefully we’ll catch you then.

What a peculiar day. It hardly feels as though the match has advanced at all, 
thanks to the rain, Pakistan’s discipline during the opening session, and 
Jackson Bird’s line and length in the afternoon. In amongst that we’ve had the 
news of Mark Nicholas’ illness, of which there have been no further updates 
since 16.00 below.

Still, Australia will return tomorrow the happier of the two sides, especially 
after losing the toss.

Andy Roberts in FNQ has pointed out a flaw in my composite Ashes XI (see 
16.08) - I’m sure there are plenty, if more of you want to join in.

“How could you have Cook in a composite 11? Perhaps the only opener ever who 
can’t play a genuine pace delivery. He should think himself fortunate to make a 
composite 22.”

Which begs the obvious question - who should be in the side in his place? 
Renshaw? Hameed? Jennings? Khawaja?

Cook, by the way, averages 49.53 in Australia, with four tons.

C9’s intel on the rain is enough for them to cut to a half-hour news 
broadcast. That will take us through to 5pm and 30-minutes from the close of 
play. It now seems increasingly unlikely there will be any further action.

keep bums on sofas during the rain delay.

Inclement weather continues to interfere with play, now 30 minutes after the 
evening session was supposed to begin. The bulk of the band of rain has passed 
over the MCG but there’s still plenty on the radar heading its way so a 
resumption is unlikely any time soon.

England / Australia XI

Some shameless rain delay filler to help pass the time, prompted by Andrew 
Benton’s tweet below (15.33).

We’re moving into Ashes territory again and it seems set to be another close 
one with both Australia and England in transition a year out from England’s 
tour down under. Home advantage will doubtless give Australia the edge with the 
bookies but what would a composite XI look like?

Here’s mine:

 * Cook

 * Warner 
 * Smith (c) 
 * Root 
 * Khawaja 
 * Bairstow (wk) 
 * Stokes 
 * Starc 
 * Broad 
 * Lyon 
 * Hazlewood 
Feel free to tell me what selections I’ve horribly messed up.

In case you missed it earlier, Channel Nine anchor Mark Nicholas has been 
taken to hospital with abdominal pain.

During the tea interval Michael Slater commented: 

“Normally Mark Nicholas would be sitting here at this time of the day. Just to 
let you know, he’s fallen ill with abdominal pains and he’s been taken to 
hospital for testing. I’m aware it is out there online. So we will keep you 
up-to-date with the latest news when we receive it. So we wish him well.”

Weather update:

Michael Clarke has spoken to the MCG groundsman and he expects the delay to 
last around another30-60 minutes. It’s gone from drizzle to rain in Jolimont 
but there’s a decent breeze pushing this band of rain across Melbourne.

The extended tea break gives me plenty of time for my customary whinge. Even 
allowing for the five or so minutes lost to rain only 50.5 overs were bowled in 
the two sessions, almost ten overs short of what should be expected - and 
that’s with Nathan Lyon sending down 11 overs of spin.
 Despite Nathan Lyon bowling 11 overs Australia were miles behind the over

Jonathan Howcroft

Thanks Russell, and with the timing of a Chris Martin cover drive I have 
arrived as a band of rain sweeps across Melbourne. There was only light drizzle 
at the MCG in the run to tea but the weather radar is indicating there’s plenty 
more where that came from, so the interval is likely to last longer than 
scheduled.

I’ll keep you posted, but don’t gulp down your cuppa unnecessarily.

Tea - on day one - Pakistan 142-4

That appears to be tea on day one at the MCG

And the Pakistan pair were understandably eager to get off the ground. They’re 
142-4 at this point after the loss of Sami Aslam (9), Babar Azam (23), Younus 
Khan (21) and Misbah-ul-Haq (11), though opener Azhar Ali remains on a 
determined 66. Australia didn’t always bowl brilliantly but at least one bowler 
was firing at any one time, and all of Jackson Bird, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan 
Lyon has had their moments.

That’s it for me but please stay around as JP Howcroft takes you through the 
final session of today’s play. Adios!
 Jackson Bird finished the second session with wind in his sails. Photograph:

51st over: Pakistan 142-4 (Azhar 66, Shafiq 4)

He didn’t have much of an idea where it was going, but Azhar sends another 
edge through the vacant third slip region off Bird to pick up four, but well 
and truly has the upper hand a ball later when he smartly clips a straight one 
through mid-wicket for the same result as the mizzle still falls across the 
MCG. With that the umpires call a halt to play, 11 minutes before the scheduled 
tea break, so that ground staff can lay out the covers. Hopefully it passes.

50th over: Pakistan 134-4 (Azhar 58, Shafiq 4)

The crowd favourite is dispatched with now and we’ll have one more spell from 
Mitchell Starc, who almost claims an edge when Shafiq dangles his bat outside 
off for no good reason. Just an update re the Mark Nicholas situation, here is 
an update from his employer, Channel Nine: “During a break today, Mark Nicholas 
had some abdominal pains. He has gone to hospital for appropriate checks.” 
We’ll have more information on that when it’s available.

49th over: Pakistan 130-4 (Azhar 58, Shafiq 0)

Jackson Bird continues with penetration and draws a false stroke from Azhar 
this time when the Pakistani opener is squared up, sending an edge past second 
slip and out to the rope at third man. “Due to wet weather, watch your step to 
stay safe,” the scoreboard says. It might be a message for Azhar.

48th over: Pakistan 126-4 (Azhar 54, Shafiq 0)

The other thing you should know is that light rain is falling at the MCG, 
though not enough to send the players off at this point. A single to Azhar is 
the only damage in this Nathan Lyon over.

47th over: Pakistan 125-4 (Azhar 53, Shafiq 0)

Brisbane hero Asad Shafiq saunters to the crease now and he’s got a decent 
amount of work in front of him as Bird continues Australia’s momentum. The new 
batsman leaves outside off stump to end the over, which was a good one for the 
home side. Bird has 2-41 from 14 overs after a middling start and his side is 
in the box seat on day one.

WICKET! Misbah c Maddinson b Bird 11 (Pakistan 125-4)

Bird strikes again! The umpires refer it to make sure, but Nic Maddinson has 
taken a gem at short leg, diving forward and just managing to get his fingers 
underneath the ball after Misbah sent an inside edge deflecting off his body 
towards the man in close. The Pakistan captain is gone!

46th over: Pakistan 121-3 (Azhar 53, Misbah 7)

We’re a little over half an hour from tea now and with that last wicket 
Australia has slowed things down, and Nathan Lyon musters a maiden here to 
maintain the pressure. In less pleasant news, Channel Nine commentator Mark 
Nicholas has been rushed to hospital. More information on that as it’s at hand.

45th over: Pakistan 121-3 (Azhar 53, Misbah 7)

All of a sudden J-Bird is decking them back in to Azhar and causing all sorts 
of trouble for the batsman. Azhar pinches a single from the final delivery but 
it’s a testing over from Bird, who is making the ball talk in his last few 
overs.

44th over: Pakistan 120-3 (Azhar 52, Misbah 7)

Well that’s one way to get off the mark. Misbah is squared up horribly by Lyon 
at the start of this over, which prompts the arrival of Nic Maddinson at silly 
point, but soon after the Pakistan skipper gets down the pitch and lofts the 
spinner over the rope at cow corner. Six! Further punishment awaits Australia 
when he sweeps the next one straight into the back of Peter Handscomb at short 
leg. Ouch.

I think that’s about enough from me for today. This blog will be up and 
running from 9.30am tomorrow, hopefully we’ll catch you then.

What a peculiar day. It hardly feels as though the match has advanced at all, 
thanks to the rain, Pakistan’s discipline during the opening session, and 
Jackson Bird’s line and length in the afternoon. In amongst that we’ve had the 
news of Mark Nicholas’ illness, of which there have been no further updates 
since 16.00 below.

Still, Australia will return tomorrow the happier of the two sides, especially 
after losing the toss.
 
Play will begin at 10am local time tomorrow in the first stage of a bid to 
make up 28 of the lost 39 overs.
 
The umpires have pulled up stumps on the first day of the Boxing Day Test. 
 
Andy Roberts in FNQ has pointed out a flaw in my composite Ashes XI (see 
16.08) - I’m sure there are plenty, if more of you want to join in.

“How could you have Cook in a composite 11? Perhaps the only opener ever who 
can’t play a genuine pace delivery. He should think himself fortunate to make a 
composite 22.”

Which begs the obvious question - who should be in the side in his place? 
Renshaw? Hameed? Jennings? Khawaja?

Cook, by the way, averages 49.53 in Australia, with four tons.

C9’s intel on the rain is enough for them to cut to a half-hour news 
broadcast. That will take us through to 5pm and 30-minutes from the close of 
play. It now seems increasingly unlikely there will be any further action.
 
In case you were wondering, Channel Nine are going with a crowd pleaser to 
keep bums on sofas during the rain delay.

Inclement weather continues to interfere with play, now 30 minutes after the 
evening session was supposed to begin. The bulk of the band of rain has passed 
over the MCG but there’s still plenty on the radar heading its way so a 
resumption is unlikely any time soon.

England / Australia XI

Some shameless rain delay filler to help pass the time, prompted by Andrew 
Benton’s tweet below (15.33).

We’re moving into Ashes territory again and it seems set to be another close 
one with both Australia and England in transition a year out from England’s 
tour down under. Home advantage will doubtless give Australia the edge with the 
bookies but what would a composite XI look like?

Here’s mine:

 * Cook

 * Warner 
 * Smith (c) 
 * Root 
 * Khawaja 
 * Bairstow (wk) 
 * Stokes 
 * Starc 
 * Broad 
 * Lyon 
 * Hazlewood 
Feel free to tell me what selections I’ve horribly messed up.

In case you missed it earlier, Channel Nine anchor Mark Nicholas has been 
taken to hospital with abdominal pain.

During the tea interval Michael Slater commented: 

“Normally Mark Nicholas would be sitting here at this time of the day. Just to 
let you know, he’s fallen ill with abdominal pains and he’s been taken to 
hospital for testing. I’m aware it is out there online. So we will keep you 
up-to-date with the latest news when we receive it. So we wish him well.”

Weather update:

Michael Clarke has spoken to the MCG groundsman and he expects the delay to 
last around another30-60 minutes. It’s gone from drizzle to rain in Jolimont 
but there’s a decent breeze pushing this band of rain across Melbourne.
 
The latest Mark Nicholas news:

The extended tea break gives me plenty of time for my customary whinge. Even 
allowing for the five or so minutes lost to rain only 50.5 overs were bowled in 
the two sessions, almost ten overs short of what should be expected - and 
that’s with Nathan Lyon sending down 11 overs of spin.

Thanks Russell, and with the timing of a Chris Martin cover drive I have 
arrived as a band of rain sweeps across Melbourne. There was only light drizzle 
at the MCG in the run to tea but the weather radar is indicating there’s plenty 
more where that came from, so the interval is likely to last longer than 
scheduled.

I’ll keep you posted, but don’t gulp down your cuppa unnecessarily. 
 
That appears to be tea on day one at the MCG

And the Pakistan pair were understandably eager to get off the ground. They’re 
142-4 at this point after the loss of Sami Aslam (9), Babar Azam (23), Younus 
Khan (21) and Misbah-ul-Haq (11), though opener Azhar Ali remains on a 
determined 66. Australia didn’t always bowl brilliantly but at least one bowler 
was firing at any one time, and all of Jackson Bird, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan 
Lyon has had their moments.

That’s it for me but please stay around as JP Howcroft takes you through the 
final session of today’s play. Adios!

51st over: Pakistan 142-4 (Azhar 66, Shafiq 4)

He didn’t have much of an idea where it was going, but Azhar sends another 
edge through the vacant third slip region off Bird to pick up four, but well 
and truly has the upper hand a ball later when he smartly clips a straight one 
through mid-wicket for the same result as the mizzle still falls across the 
MCG. With that the umpires call a halt to play, 11 minutes before the scheduled 
tea break, so that ground staff can lay out the covers. Hopefully it passes.
 
50th over: Pakistan 134-4 (Azhar 58, Shafiq 4)

The crowd favourite is dispatched with now and we’ll have one more spell from 
Mitchell Starc, who almost claims an edge when Shafiq dangles his bat outside 
off for no good reason. Just an update re the Mark Nicholas situation, here is 
an update from his employer, Channel Nine: “During a break today, Mark Nicholas 
had some abdominal pains. He has gone to hospital for appropriate checks.” 
We’ll have more information on that when it’s available.
 
49th over: Pakistan 130-4 (Azhar 58, Shafiq 0)

Jackson Bird continues with penetration and draws a false stroke from Azhar 
this time when the Pakistani opener is squared up, sending an edge past second 
slip and out to the rope at third man. “Due to wet weather, watch your step to 
stay safe,” the scoreboard says. It might be a message for Azhar.
 
48th over: Pakistan 126-4 (Azhar 54, Shafiq 0)

The other thing you should know is that light rain is falling at the MCG, 
though not enough to send the players off at this point. A single to Azhar is 
the only damage in this Nathan Lyon over.

47th over: Pakistan 125-4 (Azhar 53, Shafiq 0)

Brisbane hero Asad Shafiq saunters to the crease now and he’s got a decent 
amount of work in front of him as Bird continues Australia’s momentum. The new 
batsman leaves outside off stump to end the over, which was a good one for the 
home side. Bird has 2-41 from 14 overs after a middling start and his side is 
in the box seat on day one.
 
Bird strikes again! The umpires refer it to make sure, but Nic Maddinson has 
taken a gem at short leg, diving forward and just managing to get his fingers 
underneath the ball after Misbah sent an inside edge deflecting off his body 
towards the man in close. The Pakistan captain is gone!
 
46th over: Pakistan 121-3 (Azhar 53, Misbah 7)

We’re a little over half an hour from tea now and with that last wicket 
Australia has slowed things down, and Nathan Lyon musters a maiden here to 
maintain the pressure. In less pleasant news, Channel Nine commentator Mark 
Nicholas has been rushed to hospital. More information on that as it’s at hand.
 
45th over: Pakistan 121-3 (Azhar 53, Misbah 7)

All of a sudden J-Bird is decking them back in to Azhar and causing all sorts 
of trouble for the batsman. Azhar pinches a single from the final delivery but 
it’s a testing over from Bird, who is making the ball talk in his last few 
overs.
 
44th over: Pakistan 120-3 (Azhar 52, Misbah 7)

Well that’s one way to get off the mark. Misbah is squared up horribly by Lyon 
at the start of this over, which prompts the arrival of Nic Maddinson at silly 
point, but soon after the Pakistan skipper gets down the pitch and lofts the 
spinner over the rope at cow corner. Six! Further punishment awaits Australia 
when he sweeps the next one straight into the back of Peter Handscomb at short 
leg. Ouch.
