The 12th Republican debate is done. Here’s how it went down:

 * It was a civil affair. Ted Cruz bopped Donald Trump a bit for giving money 
to Hillary Clinton. But gone were the peppery attacks of debates past. 
 * The debate was policy-heavy. Think trade, H1-B visas, social security, 
Common Core, the Islamic state, Israel, Tiananmen Square, climate change, Cuba 
policy, Iran, veterans affairs...

 * Trump confirmed that former candidate Ben Carson would endorse him in the 
morning. 
 * Cruz and Marco Rubio distanced themselves from Trump on the question of 
assassinating the families of terrorism suspects, which Trump has proposed. The 
other two said they would not do that. 
 * “If we nominate Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, Hillary wins,” Cruz said. 
 * Trump suggested Republican rules for awarding the nomination based on a 
majority of delegates should be jettisoned. “I think that whoever gets the most 
delegates should win,” he said. 
 * Neither Rubio nor Ohio governor John Kasich would admit the extreme 
narrowness of his path to the nomination. “Math doesn’t tell the whole story in 
politics,” Kasich said. 
 * Rubio dismissed a human role in climate change: “Sure, the climate is 
changing... There was never a time when the climate was not changing.” 
 * Asked about violence at his rallies, Trump said he did not condone it, but 
his supporters “have anger that’s unbelievable. They love this country. They 
don’t like seeing bad trade deals.” Facebook

All Virgin Islands delegates to arrive at convention uncommitted

Ben Jacobs

All nine delegates from the U.S. Virgin Islands to the Republican National 
Convention in July will be uncommitted,writes Guardian politics reporter Ben 
Jacobs:

With final results from the U.S. territory’s Republican caucuses in, all six 
delegates up for election in the Virgin Islands will be uncommitted. Combined 
with the three delegates who owe their places at the convention to their rule 
in the territory’s Republican Party, the entire delegation will be up for grabs 
in July.

The delegates will be free to support any candidate they choose at the 
convention on the first ballot used to elect a nominee.

In a potential contested convention, the delegates would have disproportionate 
influence for being uncommitted. The delegation will include veteran Republican 
strategist John Yob, the author of the forthcoming bookConvention Chaos 
<http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Outsiders-Contested-Republican-Convention/dp/0692630163>
 about a potential contested convention.

The impact of these results goes beyond the fact that the six delegates up for 
election on Thursday will not be pledged to any candidate. Rule 40b of the 
Republican Party currently states that candidates need to win the support of a 
majority of the delegations in eight different states or territories to have 
their name placed into nomination at a convention.

Bay, St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Photograph: Paul J. Richards/EPA 
Party insiders have long assumed that the rule, implemented solely to block 
Ron Paul’s name from being placed into nomination in 2012, would be modified 
before the 2016 convention. However, if that doesn’t happen, unpledged 
delegates, combined with the territory’s three RNC members, would be able to 
form a majority of Virgin Islands’ delegation. This means they could 
potentially serve as one of the eight states needed for a candidate to have 
their name placed into nomination.

But, regardless of the rule’s applicability, in what looks like a vicious 
dogfight for the GOP nomination, there are now a few more delegates who owe 
nothing to any candidate on the ballot.

Dan Roberts

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> slipped into 
the spin room with a leonine prowl tonight, leading the candidates in to face a 
throng of cameras with few words but plenty of attitude,writes Guardian 
Washington bureau chiefDan Roberts:

Beneath a largely superfluous banner announcing his name, the increasingly 
confident Republican frontrunner took a few questions on recent violence at his 
rallies but did not pause long enough before each camera to add much of 
substance.

In contrast to the alleged assault of a reporter at his rally, this procession 
– which was followed byJohn Kasich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> and Ted Cruz some paces 
behind – saw most journalists kept away from the candidate by metal crush 
barriers and only television cameras allowed up close.

Spin rooms are often the place that advisers come to interpret and explain 
their candidates’ performance, but tonight’s appearance had more of the feel of 
a victory lap.

Trump: I think 'she made it up'

Here’s video of Trump saying a reporter allegedly assaulted by his campaign 
manager “made it up.” Below that is an audio recording of her before and after 
the incident, a photo of her injuries and the description of a Washington Post 
reporter who saw it.

As security parted the masses to give him passage out of the chandelier-lit 
ballroom, Michelle Fields, a young reporter for Trump-friendly Breitbart News, 
pressed forward to ask the Republican front-runner a question. I watched as a 
man with short-cropped hair and a suit grabbed her arm and yanked her out of 
the way. He was Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s 41-year-old campaign manager.

Fields stumbled. Finger-shaped bruises formed on her arm.

Trump himself reportedly denies the allegation that his campaign manager 
manhandled a reporter.

That would mean the reporter is lying, the Washington Post reporter who 
witnessed the incident is lying and the audio recording documenting it is 
fabricated.

From the comments / who won?

We asked, you answered. Well you didn’t all declare a winner – but here’s how 
some of you weighed in on what just happened:

Pretty boring debate!!! Trump win simply because the others need a knockout 
and really just not alot happened.

Guardian says Rubio won, various other pundits say the same or Cruz ergo Trump 
won and Kasich came second by default other two performed horribly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I don’t know that we have declared a Rubio victory... we did think he ran 
circles around Trump on Cuba:

Trump pretty much mailed this one in, sort of just riding with the waves. 
Kasich was also pretty weak, disappointing as he is a candidate I have 
supported.

Rubio easily won the debate, very eloquent. Where has he been all this time? 
Cruz also had a good debate, but not at the level of Rubio.

As others have said here, the other three candidates certainly should have 
gone after Donald on violence at these circus like Trump rallies.

Lucia Graves

Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> had an 
uncommonly strong debate night tonight – and he certainly needed it after poor 
performances in the last two and an embarrassing finish in Saturday’s 
primaries. His route to the nomination looks increasingly impossible, and 
perhaps that now-or-never realization was what unleashed his tongue.

When a moderator asked Rubio about opening up diplomatic relations with Cuba 
and, specifically, why he thinks the president andDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and the American people are 
all wrong about their willingness to do so, Rubio said he would love for the US 
to change its relationship with Cuba, but that that ‘would first require the 
Cuban government to change’.

Later, when Trump seemed to have no idea what to say about US policy with 
Cuba, Rubio seemed ready to explain it to him.

Earlier, when Trump accused him of being politically correct in his nuanced 
approach to relations with Muslims, Rubio had a clever retort: ‘I’m not 
interested in being politically correct – I’m interested in being correct.’ And 
on the question of climate change, he drew applause with more pithy bon mots. 
He said Miami was in trouble because it was built on a swamp and that ‘as far 
as a law we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there’s no such 
thing’.

Late in the debate Rubio acknowledged of his Not-So-Super Tuesday, ‘I didn’t 
do as well as I would have liked,’ but he added that a story his wife had told 
him about a supporter who believed in him through thick and thin had given him 
strength.

If losing is really what gives him strength, perhaps it’s too bad he didn’t do 
it earlier.

Closing statements

Kasich: I’ve tried to be positive. I wanted to raise the bar in presidential 
politics. [This sounds like a valedictory.] “I will continue to run a positive 
campaign. I can fix it, I’ve done it before.” Federal power to the states. 
[This is a long closing statement.] My beloved Buckeyes.

Rubio: Great to be home in Miami. My father was a bartender. I’m a 
presidential candidate. My parents wanted me to live their dream. That was 
possible because America is special. Now the moment has arrived for our 
generation to do our part. The single greatest nation ever.

Cruz: What an incredible nation we have. That the son of a bartender and the 
son of a mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman” 
could be running for president. Who will best represent our values, who will 
best defend your values and fight for you? I cannot wait to stand on this stage 
[against Hillary Clinton]. Cops firefighters soldiers.

Trump: New Republican voters – they’re coming by the millions. We should seize 
that opportunity. These are people that will win us the election. Fabulous 
supreme court justices. If we lose... it will take centuries to recover. Unify. 
Be smart and unify.
daveweigel (@daveweigel) 
Perfect close from Trump: Who you gonna believe, the pollsters or the arenas 
I'm filling with voters?

Lucia Graves

A classic bit of victim blaming: Trump, asked by a moderator about the 
repeated violence against protesters and members of the media at his rallies, 
did what you might expect – he vilified the protesters.

‘We have some protesters. They are bad dudes. They are swinging,’ Trump said. 

This came on the heels of a report 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inside-trumps-inner-circle-his-staffers-are-willing-to-fight-for-him-literally/2016/03/10/4b2b18e8-e660-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html>
 that his own campaign manager assaulted a member of the media at an event in 
Jupiter, Florida, this week, and multiple incidents – many videotaped – 
involving peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters.

‘They get in there and they’re hitting people,’ Trump alleged of the 
protesters, adding: ‘They’ve got to be taken out, we’ve got to run something … 
and it’s not me, it’s usually the police.’

Trump’s response is part of a larger culture of denying responsibility for the 
violence that takes place at his rallies. This week we saw just how far up into 
his campaign that culture extends.

Most troubling of all, perhaps, was that none of the other candidates seemed 
to want to condemn the violence at Trump events, either. Instead his chief 
rival,Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>, used the 
opportunity to align Trump with Obama: ‘We’ve seen for seven years someone who 
believes he’s above the law, who thinks he’s an emperor.’

What about whether anyone in his administration reportedly physically 
assaulted anyone? How about that?

The 12th Republican debate is done. Here’s how it went down:

 * It was a civil affair. Ted Cruz bopped Donald Trump a bit for giving money 
to Hillary Clinton. But gone were the peppery attacks of debates past. 
 * The debate was policy-heavy. Think trade, H1-B visas, social security, 
Common Core, the Islamic state, Israel, Tiananmen Square, climate change, Cuba 
policy, Iran, veterans affairs...

 * Trump confirmed that former candidate Ben Carson would endorse him in the 
morning. 
 * Cruz and Marco Rubio distanced themselves from Trump on the question of 
assassinating the families of terrorism suspects, which Trump has proposed. The 
other two said they would not do that. 
 * “If we nominate Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, Hillary wins,” Cruz said. 
 * Trump suggested Republican rules for awarding the nomination based on a 
majority of delegates should be jettisoned. “I think that whoever gets the most 
delegates should win,” he said. 
 * Neither Rubio nor Ohio governor John Kasich would admit the extreme 
narrowness of his path to the nomination. “Math doesn’t tell the whole story in 
politics,” Kasich said. 
 * Rubio dismissed a human role in climate change: “Sure, the climate is 
changing... There was never a time when the climate was not changing.” 
 * Asked about violence at his rallies, Trump said he did not condone it, but 
his supporters “have anger that’s unbelievable. They love this country. They 
don’t like seeing bad trade deals.”  
All nine delegates from the U.S. Virgin Islands to the Republican National 
Convention in July will be uncommitted,writes Guardian politics reporter Ben 
Jacobs:

With final results from the U.S. territory’s Republican caucuses in, all six 
delegates up for election in the Virgin Islands will be uncommitted. Combined 
with the three delegates who owe their places at the convention to their rule 
in the territory’s Republican Party, the entire delegation will be up for grabs 
in July.

The delegates will be free to support any candidate they choose at the 
convention on the first ballot used to elect a nominee.

In a potential contested convention, the delegates would have disproportionate 
influence for being uncommitted. The delegation will include veteran Republican 
strategist John Yob, the author of the forthcoming bookConvention Chaos 
<http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Outsiders-Contested-Republican-Convention/dp/0692630163>
 about a potential contested convention.

The impact of these results goes beyond the fact that the six delegates up for 
election on Thursday will not be pledged to any candidate. Rule 40b of the 
Republican Party currently states that candidates need to win the support of a 
majority of the delegations in eight different states or territories to have 
their name placed into nomination at a convention.

Bay, St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Photograph: Paul J. Richards/EPA 
Party insiders have long assumed that the rule, implemented solely to block 
Ron Paul’s name from being placed into nomination in 2012, would be modified 
before the 2016 convention. However, if that doesn’t happen, unpledged 
delegates, combined with the territory’s three RNC members, would be able to 
form a majority of Virgin Islands’ delegation. This means they could 
potentially serve as one of the eight states needed for a candidate to have 
their name placed into nomination.

But, regardless of the rule’s applicability, in what looks like a vicious 
dogfight for the GOP nomination, there are now a few more delegates who owe 
nothing to any candidate on the ballot.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> slipped into 
the spin room with a leonine prowl tonight, leading the candidates in to face a 
throng of cameras with few words but plenty of attitude,writes Guardian 
Washington bureau chiefDan Roberts:

Beneath a largely superfluous banner announcing his name, the increasingly 
confident Republican frontrunner took a few questions on recent violence at his 
rallies but did not pause long enough before each camera to add much of 
substance.

In contrast to the alleged assault of a reporter at his rally, this procession 
– which was followed byJohn Kasich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> and Ted Cruz some paces 
behind – saw most journalists kept away from the candidate by metal crush 
barriers and only television cameras allowed up close.

Spin rooms are often the place that advisers come to interpret and explain 
their candidates’ performance, but tonight’s appearance had more of the feel of 
a victory lap.
 
Here’s video of Trump saying a reporter allegedly assaulted by his campaign 
manager “made it up.” Below that is an audio recording of her before and after 
the incident, a photo of her injuries and the description of a Washington Post 
reporter who saw it.

As security parted the masses to give him passage out of the chandelier-lit 
ballroom, Michelle Fields, a young reporter for Trump-friendly Breitbart News, 
pressed forward to ask the Republican front-runner a question. I watched as a 
man with short-cropped hair and a suit grabbed her arm and yanked her out of 
the way. He was Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s 41-year-old campaign manager.

Fields stumbled. Finger-shaped bruises formed on her arm.
 
Trump himself reportedly denies the allegation that his campaign manager 
manhandled a reporter.

That would mean the reporter is lying, the Washington Post reporter who 
witnessed the incident is lying and the audio recording documenting it is 
fabricated.

Guardian says Rubio won, various other pundits say the same or Cruz ergo Trump 
won and Kasich came second by default other two performed horribly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I don’t know that we have declared a Rubio victory... we did think he ran 
circles around Trump on Cuba:

Trump pretty much mailed this one in, sort of just riding with the waves. 
Kasich was also pretty weak, disappointing as he is a candidate I have 
supported.

Rubio easily won the debate, very eloquent. Where has he been all this time? 
Cruz also had a good debate, but not at the level of Rubio.

As others have said here, the other three candidates certainly should have 
gone after Donald on violence at these circus like Trump rallies.
 
Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> had an 
uncommonly strong debate night tonight – and he certainly needed it after poor 
performances in the last two and an embarrassing finish in Saturday’s 
primaries. His route to the nomination looks increasingly impossible, and 
perhaps that now-or-never realization was what unleashed his tongue.

When a moderator asked Rubio about opening up diplomatic relations with Cuba 
and, specifically, why he thinks the president andDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and the American people are 
all wrong about their willingness to do so, Rubio said he would love for the US 
to change its relationship with Cuba, but that that ‘would first require the 
Cuban government to change’.

Later, when Trump seemed to have no idea what to say about US policy with 
Cuba, Rubio seemed ready to explain it to him.

Earlier, when Trump accused him of being politically correct in his nuanced 
approach to relations with Muslims, Rubio had a clever retort: ‘I’m not 
interested in being politically correct – I’m interested in being correct.’ And 
on the question of climate change, he drew applause with more pithy bon mots. 
He said Miami was in trouble because it was built on a swamp and that ‘as far 
as a law we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there’s no such 
thing’.

Late in the debate Rubio acknowledged of his Not-So-Super Tuesday, ‘I didn’t 
do as well as I would have liked,’ but he added that a story his wife had told 
him about a supporter who believed in him through thick and thin had given him 
strength.

If losing is really what gives him strength, perhaps it’s too bad he didn’t do 
it earlier.
 
Michelle Fields, the Breitbart reporter yanked around and bruised by Trump 
campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Tuesday,expresses disappointment that the 
debate moderators did not confront Trump about his campaign’s denial of the 
incident, despite an audio recording of it and witness account:

campaign. I can fix it, I’ve done it before.” Federal power to the states. 
[This is a long closing statement.] My beloved Buckeyes.

Rubio: Great to be home in Miami. My father was a bartender. I’m a 
presidential candidate. My parents wanted me to live their dream. That was 
possible because America is special. Now the moment has arrived for our 
generation to do our part. The single greatest nation ever.

Cruz: What an incredible nation we have. That the son of a bartender and the 
son of a mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman” 
could be running for president. Who will best represent our values, who will 
best defend your values and fight for you? I cannot wait to stand on this stage 
[against Hillary Clinton]. Cops firefighters soldiers.

Trump: New Republican voters – they’re coming by the millions. We should seize 
that opportunity. These are people that will win us the election. Fabulous 
supreme court justices. If we lose... it will take centuries to recover. Unify. 
Be smart and unify.
