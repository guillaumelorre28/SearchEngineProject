Rain intervenes again at 5:15pm

101.2 overs: Pakistan 310-6 (Azhar 139, Amir 28)


That will probably be it for the day, you would imagine, since play can’t go 
much past 6:30 and given how long it takes to get the covers up once they’re 
down. Frustrating for everyone, but mostly for Pakistan, who were getting a 
real run on in the last half hour after battling through a difficult period 
against the new ball that cost a couple of wickets. But their 300 is up, a lot 
of time has been lost from the game, and if the visitors can come back tomorrow 
and push that up past 350 or beyond. There are also some showers forecast 
tomorrow, which may cost us yet more time. So the chances of a result grow 
slimmer, Pakistan should be a decent shout to draw this Test, and maybe their 
best scenario is to exhaust Australia’s bowler and then go on to win in Sydney.


Even a draw won’t be a bad result for Pakistan, given they’ve lost their last 
10 Tests in Australia. But this rain isn’t a lucky break for them: they’ve 
played very well in the face of some excellent fast bowling. Just a shame we’re 
not getting to see more of it!

I’ll check back in with you if there’s any news, and if not then Adam Collins 
will kick things off half an hour early tomorrow, 10am local time. You can fill 
in some of the meantime byreading his article on the aforementioned wunderkind 
Will Pucovski here 
<http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/1073960.html>. A freakish 
career so far. Pucovksi has been ok too.

101st over: Pakistan 306-6 (Azhar 135, Amir 28)

Another milestone, the team 300 is up as Amir slashes Bird through the covers 
for four. Then he uppercuts another! Over slip again. Productive area for Amir 
today.

100th over: Pakistan 298-6 (Azhar 135, Amir 20)

Shawwwwt. First ball of Starc’s over, and Pakistan’s century-maker plants it 
back down the ground for four. He’s straight-driven exquisitely and played 
almost no other strokes today. Trades singles with Amir, then drives another 
two runs through cover. He’s starting to move along too, Azhar.


Our OBO colleague Adam Collins loves him some ephemera. “In the Ponting XII v 
Gilchrist XII at the SCG right now Will Pucovski just made 87* in 59 balls. And 
now Austin Waugh is batting in reply (son of Steve).”

Actually Austin Waugh just got out, but Will Sutherland (some of the CA boss 
James) smacked two fours from the last two balls to get a win at the last gasp.

99th over: Pakistan 290-6 (Azhar 128, Amir 19)

I reckon Azhar’s approach is that time is as important as runs here. The more 
you make Australia bowl,the more chance you break their bowlers for the second 
innings and for Sydney. The workload from Brisbane needs to be compounded, the 
exhaustion increased, the injury risk inflated. So he’s still playing 
conservatively against Hazlewood, ducking the bouncer, tapping a single. Amir 
does the best possible thing, getting a run immediately and getting back off 
strike, which Azhar farms from the last ball.

98th over: Pakistan 287-6 (Azhar 126, Amir 18)

Amir has come to play! First ball faced from Starc, and he smashes it straight 
back past the bowler for four. He misses out down the leg-side next ball, Wade 
appealing for a non-existent catch. Then there’s width, and Amir cuts of the 
top edge, through the slips again. they’ve put a third man in for him, but this 
ball’s so well struck that it beats him on the fine side of the field as well, 
Handscomb diving but just palming into the rope. Starc fumes, sends down 
another leg-side pie, and Amir isn’t going to miss out twice. Glanced for four! 
A dozen from the over, and he’s loving it so much that he tries to farm the 
strike, but Azhar isn’t sprinting a last single.

Impressive numbers considering the frustrations with the rain. We’ve just gone 
past one-day’s worth of overs, and that’s in the third session of the second.

97th over: Pakistan 275-6 (Azhar 126, Amir 6)

Hazlewood gets the chance of a full over at Amir. Bat raised in his stance, 
waiting, twitching. Right-armer angling across a left-hander. Amir uses that 
angle and cuts nicely but gully saves it. Then Amir lashes out and edgesover 
Khawaja at third slip! That’s easily catchable, it goes just over the 
fieldsman’s cap, but he loses sight of the ball in the gloom. In the end 
Khawaja is almost putting his hands up to shield his face more than going for 
the ball. It clears him and goes for four. Amir plays smart the next ball and 
taps a single into the covers. Well, maybe not that smart because he’ll have to 
face Mitchell Starc after Azhar defends the last ball.

96th over: Pakistan 270-6 (Azhar 126, Amir 1)

Bird continues this impressive spell, keeping Azhar watchful until the batsman 
escapes strike witha leg bye. Amir gets off the mark with a single to fine leg.


Sydney Thunder have capped off an easy win in the WBBL. The Renegades have 
been poor with the bat this year, and again today, held to 93-6 in their 
innings. Syney chased that down in 12 overs, West Indies skip Stafanie Taylor 
with 48 off 37.

95th over: Pakistan 268-6 (Azhar 126, Amir 0)

Mohammed Amir to the crease. He made his best Test score in Brisbane with 48. 
This will be a challenge. It’s quite hot and sticky outside but there’s thick 
cloud and the visibility is dull. Wicket-maiden for Hazlewood.

WICKET! Sarfraz c Renshaw b Hazlewood 10

Well, he worked Sarfraz over there. Nagging away on off stump, a sense of 
threat with every ball. Sarfraz pushes to the field, he leaves, he slashes. 
Then eventually he gets one angling in at his off stump, it moves away a touch, 
and the defensive push lands with first slip.

94th over: Pakistan 268-5 (Azhar 126, Sarfraz 10)

Oh, pretty. The on-drive has moved men to tears and women to immaculate 
conception. Azhar Ali ensures some awkward medical appointents with this 
rendition of the shot, from Bird’s fuller ball not far past the non-striker’s 
stumps. It purred for four. The leading edge fora single to cover wasn’t quite 
so good. Sarfraz ticks a couple of singles in the over as well, and has 
unobtrusively gone to double figures. It speaks well of his approach that he 
leaves a rank wide ball from Bird that he could have tried to carve, but may 
just as well have edged to slip. If Sarfraz is willing to stay the course, 
Pakistan can still build a strong total.

93rd over: Pakistan 261-5 (Azhar 121, Sarfraz 8)

Hazlewood’s back. Azhar pushes him into the covers, through Lyon. Warner 
chases back. He thinks that Lyon is backing him up for the double-team 
fielding, so slides in and flicks the ball back up. But Lyon has turned around 
to watch the pitch and doesn’t even see it. Then flinches at the shot and runs 
around looking for it. Solid stuff. Two runs for the price of none. But that’s 
all Hazlewood concedes. His accuracy is right on, even after 23 overs in the 
match.

92nd over: Pakistan 259-5 (Azhar 119, Sarfraz 8)


Bird trying to tempt Sarfraz into an indiscretion outside off, but the ‘keeper 
won’t be drawn. Then Bird bounces a good one at his head and Sarfraz evades. 
The bowler could have had a fourth as he reverts to the off stump line, but 
Sarfraz’s edge this time goes wide of slip for four.

91st over: Pakistan 255-5 (Azhar 119, Sarfraz 4)


Starc reeeeeeeally wants an lbw with a yorker. He pounds in three different 
attempts in that over, but Christmas has passed and his wish is not granted. 
The inswinging yorker is his best weapon, but it becomes less powerful when 
overused. Like, does anybody remember the BFG radiation cannon from Quake? And 
how amazing it was? Except when you used a cheat code for unlimited ammo and 
then just kept sending massive green plasma balls hurtling into crowded battle 
chambers, and it very quickly became unsatisfying and a giant void gnawed 
within you because where in this life could you find meaning if joy could so 
suddenly evaporate to nothing? Yeah, it’s like that.

90th over: Pakistan 254-5 (Azhar 119, Sarfraz 3)

I like Sarfraz Ahmed. Positive, busy player. There’s a leg bye, then a single, 
then Sarfraz gets up n his toes and punches Bird away for a couple of runs, 
then another single through square.

89th over: Pakistan 249-5 (Azhar 118, Sarfraz 0)

Starc continuing with the theory that if you don’t know what you’re bowling, 
neither will they. His first ball goes wild over the wicketkeeper for five 
wides. Byes? Wides. Nowhere near anything. Then he goes too full, and Azhar 
produces a beautiful straight drive down the ground for four. That’s the shot 
of a man who’s been batting all day. Then the bowler hits a nice, testing line 
outside off stump for four dots.

WICKET! Shafiq c Smith b Bird 50

88th over: Pakistan 240-5 (Azhar 114)


The stand breaks! And from a strange call, in that after a couple of stellar 
overs from Hazlewood, he was off. Jackson Bird came on. He was attacking the 
body of the batsmen with his line, and they each took a single tucked around 
the corner. Shafiq’s brought up his half century. but that’s as far as he got, 
as Bird resumed his usual line outside off stump, and landed the last ball of 
the over back of a length, got it to kick away, and Shafiq’s defensive stroke 
only guided the ball to slip.

All you can say at time like this is... Shaaaaaaaafiq’s out! Doo do doo doo 
doo.

87th over: Pakistan 238-4 (Azhar 113, Shafiq 49)


Don’t you love Ian Gould? What a sense of theatre. he’s the one man standing 
against this raging Australian army. Well, I guess the Pakistan batsman are 
doing their bit as well.

Hello! Geoff Lemon indeed here with you, and thanks to Russell for his 
sterling meteorological work during the day so far. I am typing to you with 
somewhat hampered speed due to a broken wrist, so I’m relying more than ever on 
readers to send me interesting things. Ctrl+C Ctrl+V is less skeletally taxing 
than hammering out my own epic paragraphs. But I will do what I need to do for 
the love of cricket and the OBO.

Starc rather wastes the new ball, banging it wide of Azhar’s off stump except 
for a last-ditch yorker that is blocked out. It’s a maiden, but Azhar doesn’t 
care.

86th over: Pakistan 238-4 (Azhar 113, Shafiq 49)

Hazlewood, it might not surprise you to know, is deadly accurate in this over. 
It presents a genuine challenge for the tiring live-blogger; how do you 
describe the same non-event in different ways over and over again? Miserly, 
parsimonious, stingy – there’s only so many adjectives to go around when it’s 
dot ball after dot ball. This time he saves me with a spirited lbw appeal 
against Shafiq, who is one away from his half-century, but Ian Gould waves both 
it and another one off after the Australians have conferenced forever. 
Hazlewood is not a happy camper. He really liked the second one.

Anyway, Geoff Lemon will be joining you now. Make him feel welcome!

85th over: Pakistan 238-4 (Azhar 113, Shafiq 49)

Starc can’t be faulted for his start this time, and it’s only a kamikaze 
single that brings Azhar his first run of the session. He knocked it to the off 
side, takes off for a run that isn’t there and gets lucky when Nathan Lyon’s 
throw at the stumps misses. The diving centurion was a good metre short of his 
ground and very fortunate, though he does crock himself slightly in the dive. 
The next ball deflects off Shafiq’s pad for four leg byes and there’s a single 
in that region too.

There’s some late drama in the over with a big appeal for caught behind, but 
Azhar survives when the third umpire rules that the ball hadn’t carried all the 
way into Matthew Wade’s gloves. In other news, the bars must be packed because 
we’re now up to an aggregate of 99,000 spectators for the game. Remarkably for 
a day with so little play, nobody has been kicked out.

84th over: Pakistan 232-4 (Azhar 112, Shafiq 48)

The powers that be are hoping for 38 more overs today, which might be slightly 
ambitious, but they’ve earmarked a further 30 minutes of play to achieve it, so 
we’ll be going through until 6:30pm local time. I reckon there are probably 
5,000 people still scattered around the ground, maybe a few more. The third 
ball of this Hazlewood over is an absolute peach, decking away from Shafiq as 
he thrusts the blade at it. Too good for an edge, that one. Another maiden for 
Hazlewood, who has 1-23 from 22 overs.

83rd over: Pakistan 232-4 (Azhar 112, Shafiq 48)

Mitchell Starc is next up and his first ball is right on the money – angled 
into Azhar from over the wicket and drawing an uppish prod to the vacant short 
mid-wicket region. The next rears up to throat height on an of stump line. It’s 
a testing over from Starc, who has started far better than he did in the 
morning. An under edge from Azhar forces Matthew Wade into an athletic and 
successful dive, one that cuts off certain runs.

New ball taken – and we're back!

82nd over: Pakistan 232-4 (Azhar 112, Shafiq 48)

We’re back in action with Josh Hazlewood steaming in from the southern stand 
end of the ground, and he’s doing so with a brand spanking new Kookaburra 
four-piece. His first three to Shafiq are left outside off stump and there’s 
plenty of bounce and carry through to Matthew Wade. It’s a tidy maiden he might 
have made the batsman play a little more often.

Action stations! We’ll have some play soon!

Within 10 minutes by the looks of things. Umpires Ravi and Gould are out in 
the middle now and players are hovering by the boundary, raring to go.

Which is in 15 minutes. The weather outlook remains grim, so perhaps don’t get

Things aren’t looking any better at the MCG

...though Geoff Lemon will be dropping by soon to take you through more of 
this rain. There’s some cheer for you. The only other thing I can report is 
that former A*MAZING host James Sherry is moving his way around the crowd 
interviewing frustrated punters. Maybe he should revive some of his old work.

I think you know what is coming 

...or do you? Yes, it’s still raining and the covers are stretched out across 
the entire square, but also, thrillingly, word has just reached us that Andre 
Russell’s black bat is back in action. The West Indian has placed a clear film 
over the top and he’ll now be allowed to use it in Big Bash games. In the 
context of the last hour I’m afraid to say that this counts as excitement.
 Groundsmen have been the busiest participants on the MCG this afternoon.

Still no play at the MCG

Though the covers are back off again, after being back on again, after being 
back off again, and so on and so on. Official word is there will be play in ten 
minutes but rain is no falling, so I doubt it.

An update from the MCG

The covers are now coming off, thankfully, though by the look of the sky it 
might not be a permanent measure. If you’re getting bored, give this one a spin:

Bad news, gang

The full covers are now being pulled across the entire square by ground staff, 
which indicates that we’ll be lucky to get play in the next half hour. Dark 
clouds and light rain linger.

On lunch being taken 10 minutes early

...it was a strange one. Steve Smith was reluctant to take the new ball and 
almost seemed to be working in consultation with the umpires to get off a 
little earlier. Either way it was at least the right call with regards to 
protecting the pitch, because steady rain is still falling.

The pre-emptive interval is common at Brisbane. Indeed, happened last week. 
But can't remember ever seeing it at Melbourne. Odd.#AUSvPAK

Rain stopped play – and that will be lunch on day two

The rain is only light at the moment but umpires Ravi and Gould call the 
session to a close and the covers come on. Maybe that storm is imminent. So at 
lunch Pakistan are 232-4 having put on 90 runs this morning, in which time 
Azhar Ali has moved to a commanding 112 and Asad Shafiq has reached 48. 
Advantage Pakistan.

81st over: Pakistan 232-4 (Azhar 112, Shafiq 48)

Hmm, no new ball after all, though Jackson Bird returns with some pace from 
the Member’s End. Maybe they’re letting him warm up. The final delivery is 
overpitched by the Tasmanian and Shafiq was waiting for it, calmly depositing 
his drive wide of mid-on to pick up three.

I have no idea how the MCC calculates these penalties, but if you run on thr 
ground today you’ll be fined $9,327.60.

80th over: Pakistan 228-4 (Azhar 111, Shafiq 45)

Nathan Lyon is given one final over with the old ball, and it has to be said 
that his joyous momentum of yesterday has come to a shuddering halt before 
lunch today. Shafiq plays a gorgeous sweep from well outside off stump first up 
to pick up a boundary and cuts the over’s second delivery savagely to get four 
more, bringing up the 100-run partnership from 195 balls. Maybe they should 
have kept the part-timers on. Defensively, Lyon comes around the wicket for the 
rest of the over and at least brings his short leg into play, but the over 
fizzles out. New ball time.

79th over: Pakistan 220-4 (Azhar 111, Shafiq 37)

Now Shafiq cashes in on a few flat long-hops from Maddinson, cracking one 
through mid-wicket for a boundary and cutting another through point to pick up 
three. The batsmen are just loving this. The new ball can’t come quick enough.

78th over: Pakistan 213-4 (Azhar 111, Shafiq 30)

Three more singles from Smith, who honestly should have been belted for at 
least 25 runs off these last few overs but will have semi-respectable figures 
next to his name in a few overs, when the new ball is taken.
Jarrod Kimber (@ajarrodkimber) 
2nd new ball rush is on, and Nathan Lyon gets neither end. Everyone gets sick 
of memes.

77th over: Pakistan 210-4 (Azhar 110, Shafiq 28)

Like Smith, Maddinson’s fortune is that the Pakistani batsmen are hammering 
his worst balls straight in the direction of fieldsman, at least until his 
final delivery of this over, which Azhar Ali cracks over mid-wicket for an 
emphatic boundary. The rain has now eased to mild spitting. What’s the bet the 
sun beats down for the entire lunch break and rain comes after?
 Azhar Ali has batted beautifully to reach a hundred at the MCG. Photograph:

76th over: Pakistan 202-4 (Azhar 104, Shafiq 26)

Oof, Shafiq almost falls for the oldest trick in the book here when he rocks 
back to another Smith long hop and biffs it out towards the man posted 
three-quarters of the way to the boundary at cow. There’s a nice flipper from 
Smith in this over but again he’s lucky to escape it without significant damage 
to the scoreboard. We’re basically just counting down the overs until the new 
ball now.

A hundred to Azhar Ali!

75th over: Pakistan 199-4 (Azhar 102, Shafiq 25)

What a knock by Azhar Ali, who turns two runs to fine leg and brings up his 
ton from 218 balls. It’s an innings that has taken place across 338 minutes of 
determined, nuanced batting, and done a power of good for his side. The 
milestone runs come off Nic Maddinson, who is forming a part-time bowling combo 
with his captain.

74th over: Pakistan 196-4 (Azhar 99, Shafiq 25)

I’m not exactly sure why, but Steve Smith brings himself on now for a bit of 
leg-spin, and it’s his typical mixed bag of full tosses and long hops. Somehow 
three singles are the only cost but Azhar is now one away from his ton as light 
rain continues to fall.

73rd over: Pakistan 193-4 (Azhar 97, Shafiq 24)

Aaand we’re back in action. Clouds still hang darkly over the MCG but the rain 
has stopped and Jackson Bird is charging in again. Azhar works a single to move 
within three of his milestone. Word is that lunch will still be taken at the 
regulation local time of 12:30pm, so we’ll have just on 40 minutes of play. 
What was I saying about that rain? It’s now falling again and the umpires are 
taking a good look.

Rain stopped play

73rd over: Pakistan 192-4 (Azhar 96, Shafiq 24)

More bad news for locals: reasonably heavy rain is now falling and after a 
brief conference one delivery into this Jackson Bird over, umpires Gould and 
Ravi decide to call the players off. Let’s hope it’s not a lengthy delay.

101.2 overs: Pakistan 310-6 (Azhar 139, Amir 28)


That will probably be it for the day, you would imagine, since play can’t go 
much past 6:30 and given how long it takes to get the covers up once they’re 
down. Frustrating for everyone, but mostly for Pakistan, who were getting a 
real run on in the last half hour after battling through a difficult period 
against the new ball that cost a couple of wickets. But their 300 is up, a lot 
of time has been lost from the game, and if the visitors can come back tomorrow 
and push that up past 350 or beyond. There are also some showers forecast 
tomorrow, which may cost us yet more time. So the chances of a result grow 
slimmer, Pakistan should be a decent shout to draw this Test, and maybe their 
best scenario is to exhaust Australia’s bowler and then go on to win in Sydney.


Even a draw won’t be a bad result for Pakistan, given they’ve lost their last 
10 Tests in Australia. But this rain isn’t a lucky break for them: they’ve 
played very well in the face of some excellent fast bowling. Just a shame we’re 
not getting to see more of it!

I’ll check back in with you if there’s any news, and if not then Adam Collins 
will kick things off half an hour early tomorrow, 10am local time. You can fill 
in some of the meantime byreading his article on the aforementioned wunderkind 
Will Pucovski here 
<http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/1073960.html>. A freakish 
career so far. Pucovksi has been ok too.


 
101st over: Pakistan 306-6 (Azhar 135, Amir 28)

Another milestone, the team 300 is up as Amir slashes Bird through the covers 
for four. Then he uppercuts another! Over slip again. Productive area for Amir 
today.

 
100th over: Pakistan 298-6 (Azhar 135, Amir 20)

Shawwwwt. First ball of Starc’s over, and Pakistan’s century-maker plants it 
back down the ground for four. He’s straight-driven exquisitely and played 
almost no other strokes today. Trades singles with Amir, then drives another 
two runs through cover. He’s starting to move along too, Azhar.


Our OBO colleague Adam Collins loves him some ephemera. “In the Ponting XII v 
Gilchrist XII at the SCG right now Will Pucovski just made 87* in 59 balls. And 
now Austin Waugh is batting in reply (son of Steve).”

Actually Austin Waugh just got out, but Will Sutherland (some of the CA boss 
James) smacked two fours from the last two balls to get a win at the last gasp.

 
99th over: Pakistan 290-6 (Azhar 128, Amir 19)

I reckon Azhar’s approach is that time is as important as runs here. The more 
you make Australia bowl,the more chance you break their bowlers for the second 
innings and for Sydney. The workload from Brisbane needs to be compounded, the 
exhaustion increased, the injury risk inflated. So he’s still playing 
conservatively against Hazlewood, ducking the bouncer, tapping a single. Amir 
does the best possible thing, getting a run immediately and getting back off 
strike, which Azhar farms from the last ball.

 
98th over: Pakistan 287-6 (Azhar 126, Amir 18)

Amir has come to play! First ball faced from Starc, and he smashes it straight 
back past the bowler for four. He misses out down the leg-side next ball, Wade 
appealing for a non-existent catch. Then there’s width, and Amir cuts of the 
top edge, through the slips again. they’ve put a third man in for him, but this 
ball’s so well struck that it beats him on the fine side of the field as well, 
Handscomb diving but just palming into the rope. Starc fumes, sends down 
another leg-side pie, and Amir isn’t going to miss out twice. Glanced for four! 
A dozen from the over, and he’s loving it so much that he tries to farm the 
strike, but Azhar isn’t sprinting a last single.

<https://twitter.com/timmyw85/status/813619307548536832> 
Impressive numbers considering the frustrations with the rain. We’ve just gone 
past one-day’s worth of overs, and that’s in the third session of the second.

 
97th over: Pakistan 275-6 (Azhar 126, Amir 6)

Hazlewood gets the chance of a full over at Amir. Bat raised in his stance, 
waiting, twitching. Right-armer angling across a left-hander. Amir uses that 
angle and cuts nicely but gully saves it. Then Amir lashes out and edgesover 
Khawaja at third slip! That’s easily catchable, it goes just over the 
fieldsman’s cap, but he loses sight of the ball in the gloom. In the end 
Khawaja is almost putting his hands up to shield his face more than going for 
the ball. It clears him and goes for four. Amir plays smart the next ball and 
taps a single into the covers. Well, maybe not that smart because he’ll have to 
face Mitchell Starc after Azhar defends the last ball.

 
96th over: Pakistan 270-6 (Azhar 126, Amir 1)

Bird continues this impressive spell, keeping Azhar watchful until the batsman 
escapes strike witha leg bye. Amir gets off the mark with a single to fine leg.


Sydney Thunder have capped off an easy win in the WBBL. The Renegades have 
been poor with the bat this year, and again today, held to 93-6 in their 
innings. Syney chased that down in 12 overs, West Indies skip Stafanie Taylor 
with 48 off 37.

 
95th over: Pakistan 268-6 (Azhar 126, Amir 0)

Mohammed Amir to the crease. He made his best Test score in Brisbane with 48. 
This will be a challenge. It’s quite hot and sticky outside but there’s thick 
cloud and the visibility is dull. Wicket-maiden for Hazlewood.

 
Well, he worked Sarfraz over there. Nagging away on off stump, a sense of 
threat with every ball. Sarfraz pushes to the field, he leaves, he slashes. 
Then eventually he gets one angling in at his off stump, it moves away a touch, 
and the defensive push lands with first slip.

 
94th over: Pakistan 268-5 (Azhar 126, Sarfraz 10)

Oh, pretty. The on-drive has moved men to tears and women to immaculate 
conception. Azhar Ali ensures some awkward medical appointents with this 
rendition of the shot, from Bird’s fuller ball not far past the non-striker’s 
stumps. It purred for four. The leading edge fora single to cover wasn’t quite 
so good. Sarfraz ticks a couple of singles in the over as well, and has 
unobtrusively gone to double figures. It speaks well of his approach that he 
leaves a rank wide ball from Bird that he could have tried to carve, but may 
just as well have edged to slip. If Sarfraz is willing to stay the course, 
Pakistan can still build a strong total.

 
93rd over: Pakistan 261-5 (Azhar 121, Sarfraz 8)

Hazlewood’s back. Azhar pushes him into the covers, through Lyon. Warner 
chases back. He thinks that Lyon is backing him up for the double-team 
fielding, so slides in and flicks the ball back up. But Lyon has turned around 
to watch the pitch and doesn’t even see it. Then flinches at the shot and runs 
around looking for it. Solid stuff. Two runs for the price of none. But that’s 
all Hazlewood concedes. His accuracy is right on, even after 23 overs in the 
match.

 
92nd over: Pakistan 259-5 (Azhar 119, Sarfraz 8)


Bird trying to tempt Sarfraz into an indiscretion outside off, but the ‘keeper 
won’t be drawn. Then Bird bounces a good one at his head and Sarfraz evades. 
The bowler could have had a fourth as he reverts to the off stump line, but 
Sarfraz’s edge this time goes wide of slip for four.


 
91st over: Pakistan 255-5 (Azhar 119, Sarfraz 4)


Starc reeeeeeeally wants an lbw with a yorker. He pounds in three different 
attempts in that over, but Christmas has passed and his wish is not granted. 
The inswinging yorker is his best weapon, but it becomes less powerful when 
overused. Like, does anybody remember the BFG radiation cannon from Quake? And 
how amazing it was? Except when you used a cheat code for unlimited ammo and 
then just kept sending massive green plasma balls hurtling into crowded battle 
chambers, and it very quickly became unsatisfying and a giant void gnawed 
within you because where in this life could you find meaning if joy could so 
suddenly evaporate to nothing? Yeah, it’s like that.


 
90th over: Pakistan 254-5 (Azhar 119, Sarfraz 3)

I like Sarfraz Ahmed. Positive, busy player. There’s a leg bye, then a single, 
then Sarfraz gets up n his toes and punches Bird away for a couple of runs, 
then another single through square.

That may be so, but April is the cruellest.

 
89th over: Pakistan 249-5 (Azhar 118, Sarfraz 0)

Starc continuing with the theory that if you don’t know what you’re bowling, 
neither will they. His first ball goes wild over the wicketkeeper for five 
wides. Byes? Wides. Nowhere near anything. Then he goes too full, and Azhar 
produces a beautiful straight drive down the ground for four. That’s the shot 
of a man who’s been batting all day. Then the bowler hits a nice, testing line 
outside off stump for four dots.

 
88th over: Pakistan 240-5 (Azhar 114)


The stand breaks! And from a strange call, in that after a couple of stellar 
overs from Hazlewood, he was off. Jackson Bird came on. He was attacking the 
body of the batsmen with his line, and they each took a single tucked around 
the corner. Shafiq’s brought up his half century. but that’s as far as he got, 
as Bird resumed his usual line outside off stump, and landed the last ball of 
the over back of a length, got it to kick away, and Shafiq’s defensive stroke 
only guided the ball to slip.

All you can say at time like this is... Shaaaaaaaafiq’s out! Doo do doo doo 
doo.




 
87th over: Pakistan 238-4 (Azhar 113, Shafiq 49)


Don’t you love Ian Gould? What a sense of theatre. he’s the one man standing 
against this raging Australian army. Well, I guess the Pakistan batsman are 
doing their bit as well.

Hello! Geoff Lemon indeed here with you, and thanks to Russell for his 
sterling meteorological work during the day so far. I am typing to you with 
somewhat hampered speed due to a broken wrist, so I’m relying more than ever on 
readers to send me interesting things. Ctrl+C Ctrl+V is less skeletally taxing 
than hammering out my own epic paragraphs. But I will do what I need to do for 
the love of cricket and the OBO.

Starc rather wastes the new ball, banging it wide of Azhar’s off stump except 
for a last-ditch yorker that is blocked out. It’s a maiden, but Azhar doesn’t 
care.

 
86th over: Pakistan 238-4 (Azhar 113, Shafiq 49)

Hazlewood, it might not surprise you to know, is deadly accurate in this over. 
It presents a genuine challenge for the tiring live-blogger; how do you 
describe the same non-event in different ways over and over again? Miserly, 
parsimonious, stingy – there’s only so many adjectives to go around when it’s 
dot ball after dot ball. This time he saves me with a spirited lbw appeal 
against Shafiq, who is one away from his half-century, but Ian Gould waves both 
it and another one off after the Australians have conferenced forever. 
Hazlewood is not a happy camper. He really liked the second one.

Anyway, Geoff Lemon will be joining you now. Make him feel welcome!
 
85th over: Pakistan 238-4 (Azhar 113, Shafiq 49)

Starc can’t be faulted for his start this time, and it’s only a kamikaze 
single that brings Azhar his first run of the session. He knocked it to the off 
side, takes off for a run that isn’t there and gets lucky when Nathan Lyon’s 
throw at the stumps misses. The diving centurion was a good metre short of his 
ground and very fortunate, though he does crock himself slightly in the dive. 
The next ball deflects off Shafiq’s pad for four leg byes and there’s a single 
in that region too.

There’s some late drama in the over with a big appeal for caught behind, but 
Azhar survives when the third umpire rules that the ball hadn’t carried all the 
way into Matthew Wade’s gloves. In other news, the bars must be packed because 
we’re now up to an aggregate of 99,000 spectators for the game. Remarkably for 
a day with so little play, nobody has been kicked out.
 
84th over: Pakistan 232-4 (Azhar 112, Shafiq 48)

The powers that be are hoping for 38 more overs today, which might be slightly 
ambitious, but they’ve earmarked a further 30 minutes of play to achieve it, so 
we’ll be going through until 6:30pm local time. I reckon there are probably 
5,000 people still scattered around the ground, maybe a few more. The third 
ball of this Hazlewood over is an absolute peach, decking away from Shafiq as 
he thrusts the blade at it. Too good for an edge, that one. Another maiden for 
Hazlewood, who has 1-23 from 22 overs.
 
83rd over: Pakistan 232-4 (Azhar 112, Shafiq 48)

Mitchell Starc is next up and his first ball is right on the money – angled 
into Azhar from over the wicket and drawing an uppish prod to the vacant short 
mid-wicket region. The next rears up to throat height on an of stump line. It’s 
a testing over from Starc, who has started far better than he did in the 
morning. An under edge from Azhar forces Matthew Wade into an athletic and 
successful dive, one that cuts off certain runs.

82nd over: Pakistan 232-4 (Azhar 112, Shafiq 48)

We’re back in action with Josh Hazlewood steaming in from the southern stand 
end of the ground, and he’s doing so with a brand spanking new Kookaburra 
four-piece. His first three to Shafiq are left outside off stump and there’s 
plenty of bounce and carry through to Matthew Wade. It’s a tidy maiden he might 
have made the batsman play a little more often.
 
Play will resume at 3:30pm local time

Which is 13 minutes away. Pakistan will be resuming at 232-4 and the faithful 
who’ve remained through the downpour will finally be rewarded.
 
Action stations! We’ll have some play soon!

Within 10 minutes by the looks of things. Umpires Ravi and Gould are out in 
the middle now and players are hovering by the boundary, raring to go.

Things aren’t looking any better at the MCG

...though Geoff Lemon will be dropping by soon to take you through more of 
this rain. There’s some cheer for you. The only other thing I can report is 
that former A*MAZING host James Sherry is moving his way around the crowd 
interviewing frustrated punters. Maybe he should revive some of his old work.
 A*Mazing  
I think you know what is coming 

...or do you? Yes, it’s still raining and the covers are stretched out across 
the entire square, but also, thrillingly, word has just reached us that Andre 
Russell’s black bat is back in action. The West Indian has placed a clear film 
over the top and he’ll now be allowed to use it in Big Bash games. In the 
context of the last hour I’m afraid to say that this counts as excitement.

Still no play at the MCG

Though the covers are back off again, after being back on again, after being 
back off again, and so on and so on. Official word is there will be play in ten 
minutes but rain is no falling, so I doubt it.
 
An update from the MCG

The covers are now coming off, thankfully, though by the look of the sky it 
might not be a permanent measure. If you’re getting bored, give this one a spin:

Bad news, gang

The full covers are now being pulled across the entire square by ground staff, 
which indicates that we’ll be lucky to get play in the next half hour. Dark 
clouds and light rain linger.

An update on the rain

...it’s stopped. Well, mostly. We should be under way on time I think, though 
the covers are still on. Headband weather?

On lunch being taken 10 minutes early

...it was a strange one. Steve Smith was reluctant to take the new ball and 
almost seemed to be working in consultation with the umpires to get off a 
little earlier. Either way it was at least the right call with regards to 
protecting the pitch, because steady rain is still falling.

The pre-emptive interval is common at Brisbane. Indeed, happened last week. 
But can't remember ever seeing it at Melbourne. Odd.#AUSvPAK

The rain is only light at the moment but umpires Ravi and Gould call the 
session to a close and the covers come on. Maybe that storm is imminent. So at 
lunch Pakistan are 232-4 having put on 90 runs this morning, in which time 
Azhar Ali has moved to a commanding 112 and Asad Shafiq has reached 48. 
Advantage Pakistan.

81st over: Pakistan 232-4 (Azhar 112, Shafiq 48)

Hmm, no new ball after all, though Jackson Bird returns with some pace from 
the Member’s End. Maybe they’re letting him warm up. The final delivery is 
overpitched by the Tasmanian and Shafiq was waiting for it, calmly depositing 
his drive wide of mid-on to pick up three.

I have no idea how the MCC calculates these penalties, but if you run on thr 
ground today you’ll be fined $9,327.60.
 
80th over: Pakistan 228-4 (Azhar 111, Shafiq 45)

Nathan Lyon is given one final over with the old ball, and it has to be said 
that his joyous momentum of yesterday has come to a shuddering halt before 
lunch today. Shafiq plays a gorgeous sweep from well outside off stump first up 
to pick up a boundary and cuts the over’s second delivery savagely to get four 
more, bringing up the 100-run partnership from 195 balls. Maybe they should 
have kept the part-timers on. Defensively, Lyon comes around the wicket for the 
rest of the over and at least brings his short leg into play, but the over 
fizzles out. New ball time.

79th over: Pakistan 220-4 (Azhar 111, Shafiq 37)

Now Shafiq cashes in on a few flat long-hops from Maddinson, cracking one 
through mid-wicket for a boundary and cutting another through point to pick up 
three. The batsmen are just loving this. The new ball can’t come quick enough.

78th over: Pakistan 213-4 (Azhar 111, Shafiq 30)

Three more singles from Smith, who honestly should have been belted for at 
least 25 runs off these last few overs but will have semi-respectable figures 
next to his name in a few overs, when the new ball is taken.

2nd new ball rush is on, and Nathan Lyon gets neither end. Everyone gets sick 
of memes.

77th over: Pakistan 210-4 (Azhar 110, Shafiq 28)

Like Smith, Maddinson’s fortune is that the Pakistani batsmen are hammering 
his worst balls straight in the direction of fieldsman, at least until his 
final delivery of this over, which Azhar Ali cracks over mid-wicket for an 
emphatic boundary. The rain has now eased to mild spitting. What’s the bet the 
sun beats down for the entire lunch break and rain comes after?

76th over: Pakistan 202-4 (Azhar 104, Shafiq 26)

Oof, Shafiq almost falls for the oldest trick in the book here when he rocks 
back to another Smith long hop and biffs it out towards the man posted 
three-quarters of the way to the boundary at cow. There’s a nice flipper from 
Smith in this over but again he’s lucky to escape it without significant damage 
to the scoreboard. We’re basically just counting down the overs until the new 
ball now.
 
75th over: Pakistan 199-4 (Azhar 102, Shafiq 25)

What a knock by Azhar Ali, who turns two runs to fine leg and brings up his 
ton from 218 balls. It’s an innings that has taken place across 338 minutes of 
determined, nuanced batting, and done a power of good for his side. The 
milestone runs come off Nic Maddinson, who is forming a part-time bowling combo 
with his captain.
 
74th over: Pakistan 196-4 (Azhar 99, Shafiq 25)

I’m not exactly sure why, but Steve Smith brings himself on now for a bit of 
leg-spin, and it’s his typical mixed bag of full tosses and long hops. Somehow 
three singles are the only cost but Azhar is now one away from his ton as light 
rain continues to fall.
 
73rd over: Pakistan 193-4 (Azhar 97, Shafiq 24)

Aaand we’re back in action. Clouds still hang darkly over the MCG but the rain 
has stopped and Jackson Bird is charging in again. Azhar works a single to move 
within three of his milestone. Word is that lunch will still be taken at the 
regulation local time of 12:30pm, so we’ll have just on 40 minutes of play. 
What was I saying about that rain? It’s now falling again and the umpires are 
taking a good look.
 
73rd over: Pakistan 192-4 (Azhar 96, Shafiq 24)

More bad news for locals: reasonably heavy rain is now falling and after a 
brief conference one delivery into this Jackson Bird over, umpires Gould and 
Ravi decide to call the players off. Let’s hope it’s not a lengthy delay.
