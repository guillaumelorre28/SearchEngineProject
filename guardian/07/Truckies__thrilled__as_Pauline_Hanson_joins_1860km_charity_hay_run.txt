More than 120 trucks carrying 4,500 bales of hay are completing a 1,860km 
journey from NSW to Queensland to bring respite – and some homespun political 
advice fromPauline Hanson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/pauline-hanson> – to 
drought-stricken farmers.

The Burrumbuttock Hay Runners 
<https://www.facebook.com/Burrumbuttock-Hay-Runners-1397618033820716/>, a 
charity convoy led by organiser Brendan “Bumper” Farrell and accompanied by 
Hanson, was due to arrive on Friday evening in Ilfracombe, central Queensland, 
after a two-day journey from Darlington Point in regional NSW.


The hay run, the biggest since Farrell made the first with a single truckload 
in 2014, is the culmination of five months of logistical work.

It will deliver fodder and other supplies to some of Queensland’s 
drought-affected cattle stations, some of which missed out onthis week’s 
drenching rains

.

Contacted by Guardian Australia, Farrell said he was running “about three 
hours behind” and was unable to comment.

But in remarks made to local Queensland media 
<http://charterstowersplusmore.com.au/aussie-hero-delivers-hay-run-of-hope/> in 
the lead-up to the run, Farrell said it was about keeping people on the land 
despite the chronic lack of rain in much of central Queensland.

“If we don’t give them hay and let the third and fourth generation farmers 
know there’s people who care, they’re going to be walking off the farms left, 
right and centre,” he said.

Farrell said the run was “keeping the dream alive”. 

Hanson, who is seeking to re-enter parliament 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/why-does-pauline-hanson-wind-up-progressives-like-no-other-right-wing-figure>
, has travelled with the truckers the length of their run from NSW to 
Queensland.

“This is all political,” she told Guardian Australia during a refuelling stop.

“The farming sector feels like they’re totally forgotten by politicians. 
Overregulation, control of the water and the sell-off of the land, importing of 
goods and products – this is destroying the farming sector in Australia.”

She said she had “promoted it, done some fundraising for it, and all the 
truckies are so thrilled to have me on board”.

But they were “furious” with agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/barnaby-joyce>, she said, 
predicting that if he came it was likely to be for publicity alone.

She “definitely” wanted to represent rural Australia, she said, and pointed to 
suicide and water rights as important issues for farmers.

“This is another reason why when I was an MP I was on the road,” she said. “I 
can relate to people in the bush. This has been going on since I was last in 
parliament – this issue has not gone away, if anything it’s gotten worse.”

Hanson would pay farmers to dig more dams and said charging for water use was 
unconstitutional.

“Everyone knows there’s something drastically wrong in this country,” she 
said. “Unless you’re involved in politics and understand the legislation you 
just wouldn’t know why.”


A spokesman for agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce, who is on leave, said in a 
statement: “TheQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> government is providing 
freight subsidies for fodder and water for stock, as well as for stock moving 
to and from agistment.

“Since coming to government we have invested more than $669m in assistance and 
support for Australian farmers and rural communities experiencing drought and 
other hardship.”

The state and federal governments also provided concessional drought loans to 
farmers, he said.

The hay run has garnered support from locals along the route, who have donated 
food, fuel and other supplies to Farrell and his team.

Caltex Australia donated $10,000 in fuel towards the $250,000 needed to get 
the trucks to Queensland.

And commenters on the runners’ Facebook page cheered the convoy on as “Aussie 
legends” while getting stuck into the “shiny bums” in Canberra, including the 
prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull.
