The golfer Jim Furyk shot the lowest ever PGA Tour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/01/us-pga-weather-rio-olympics-jason-day-jimmy-walker>
 round on Sunday, returning a 58 in the final round of theTravelers Championship
 <http://travelerschampionship.com/> at the TPC River Highlands course in 
Cromwell, Connecticut.

The 12-under-par round took Furyk to 11-under for the tournament and fifth 
place in the clubhouse <http://www.pgatour.com/leaderboard.html>. His first 
three rounds were a three-over 73, a four-under 66 and a two-over 72.

“There’s a lot of rounds by a lot of great players ahead of me that have never 
reached 58, so to hold that record alone right now, on thePGA Tour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/pga-tour> at least ... is phenomenal,” Furyk 
said. “To have a little, small place in history is something you dream of.”

America’s Daniel Berger led after the third round at 15-under-par, and had not 
teed off when Furyk two-putted the 18th for his record. Russell Knox of 
Scotland, Tyrone Van Aswegen of South Africa and another American, Russell 
Henley, were tied for second at 12-under.

Furyk set a course record on the opening nine holes, reaching the turn in 27 
shots. That score tied the 46-year-old American for the second-best nine holes 
in PGA Tour history: Corey Pavin shot 26 on the front nine at US Bank 
Championship in Milwaukee in 2006.

The previous nine-hole record at the TPC River Highlands course was a 28, 
shared by three golfers who did it on the course’s back nine. The previous best 
front-nine score was a 29, a feat accomplished by six golfers since the course 
in Cromwell began hosting the Connecticut PGA Tour stop in 1984.

Furyk, who was said by former pro and commentator David Feherty to have a 
swing “like an octopus falling out of a tree 
<http://www.scotsman.com/sport/golf/patience-is-pivotal-for-inconsistent-furyk-1-909517>
”, has 17 PGA Tour victories, and is one ofsix golfers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/14/jim-furyk-pga-tour-59-round> to 
have shot a 59. He did that during the second round of the BMW Championship in 
2013.

There was sense of “here we go again” on Sunday, he said, because he also shot 
eight-under par on the front nine then.

“I’m hitting it well,” he said, “I’m putting it well, it’s trying to find a 
way to stay out of your own way really. And don’t let any thoughts leak in.”

The other golfers to have shot a 59 are Al Geiberger at the 1977 Memphis 
Classic; Chip Beck at the 1991 Las Vegas Invitational; David Duval at the 1999 
Bob Hope Chrysler Classic; Paul Goydos at the 2010 John Deere Classic and 
Stuart Appleby at the 2010 Greenbrier Classic.
