The Premier League has promised to throw its support behind Stonewall’s 
rainbow laces initiative as part of a wider push to encourage diversity within 
its stadiums. Executive chairmanRichard Scudamore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/richard-scudamore> has written to 
club-affiliated LGBT supporter groups including Gay Gooner, Rainbow Toffees, 
Proud Lilywhite and Pride of Irons to thank them for their contributions before 
this weekend’s campaign.

“We know there is more that we can do to use the spirit and energy of the 
football on the pitch as a force for good off it, and that is why thePremier 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> has decided to 
support Stonewall’s Rainbow Laces campaign,” he wrote.

“This coming weekend will include a host of Rainbow Laces activities across 
all matches in our competition, and on our digital and social media channels. 
Individuals clubs will take that further with their own activity during 
matches.”

The Premier League is keen to ensure clubs promote the use of Kick It Out’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/kick-it-out> app and other reporting 
tools to report homophobic abuse, making it clear that it should be treated 
with the same seriousness as racist chanting or abuse.

As part of this weekend’s rainbow laces activity, the Premier League branding 
will feature a rainbow motif and be used across perimeter hoardings and on 
social media.

Last month, the Football Association <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa> 
chairman, Greg Clarke, saidhe was “personally ashamed” that no professional 
footballers had felt able to come out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/26/majority-fans-gay-players-no-problem>
 in the English game and that he believed they would suffer “significant abuse” 
if they did so.

But others believed his comments were overly negative. Keegan Hirst, England’s 
first openly gay rugby league player 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/18/the-courageous-journey-of-ian-roberts-rugby-leagues-first-openly-gay-player>
, said his views were “pretty negative and a bit old fashioned”.

Scudamore, who also wrote to the Gay Football Supporters Network, said the 
Premier League would also join Stonewall’s Team Pride initiative, for 
businesses that pledge to show support for LGBT people. Other members of the 
coalition includeManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> and Sky.

“Our support for the campaign, and the decision to become members of 
TeamPride, is further recognition that the LGBT community is a vital and 
integral part of our community,” said Scudamore.
