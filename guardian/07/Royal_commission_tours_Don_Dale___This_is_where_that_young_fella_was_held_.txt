Members of the royal commission into the protection and detention of children 
in theNorthern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory> have toured the 
current and former Don Dale detention centres, visiting the scenes of infamous 
riots and alleged abuses.

The commissioners, Mick Gooda and Margaret White, also heard from youth 
justice officers. They told them morale was low among staff who felt they had 
been tarred with the same brush after national outrage followed the broadcast 
of footage that showed guards mistreating and teargassing detainees.

Gooda, White and a number of departmental and commission staff toured both the 
current Don Dale juvenile detention centre – in what used to be a former adult 
prison – and the former facility just a few hundred metres away on Wednesday, 
in an effort tounderstand what went wrong

 and what may be working in NT youth corrections.

Both facilities have been the site of disturbances and escapes. There are now 
20 detainees, including one girl – whose detention requires two staff members. 
Overnight she is not guaranteed to have a female staff member on duty. There is 
little privacy, with a flimsy curtain over the otherwise open shower cubicles.

The commissioners toured the visitor’s area and the medical centre before 
going to the school and the secure accommodation units, briefly meeting 
detainees. Separate security wings have their own classrooms; detainees take 
their lesson plans with them to maintain some continuity if they move between 
them.

The high-security unit has been reinforced after detainees trashed it and 
escaped last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/22/young-indigenous-imprisonment-in-nt-you-wouldnt-believe-it-in-a-modern-day-society>
. The cells are small concrete boxes along a concrete courtyard. A staff member 
corrected White when she asked how long detainees spent locked in their cells. 
“It’s a bedroom,” he said.

She was told a maximum of three weeks, depending on the stage of a detainee’s 
behavioural management plans. They are locked in the rooms between 6.30pm and 
7.15am.

A cell used for at-risk juveniles was damaged last week, with the metal mesh 
screen wrenched from the window frame. Delegates were incredulous as they 
exited.

“They actually use this?” 

“You’d think there was a better way of doing this.”

Much of the evidence the royal commission has heard in this public hearing and 
the previousone has centred on the need forprogram-based rehabilitative 
environments for young people to end the cycle of incarceration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/06/royal-commission-told-new-detention-centres-no-solution-to-incarceration-crisis>
.


In June Don Dale’s new recreation area opened. A cool, large room with 
muralled walls and games tables, the area also includes a covered basketball 
court, a projector screen and a music room. A youth justice officer, Leon, told 
Guardian Australia he had noticed an improvement in behaviour since it opened.

Delegates appeared pleased with the area – it ticked the boxes for a 
therapeutic system they had long been told was needed but which they had never 
managed to establish.

The NT government has earmarked about $22m for new or improved facilities: 
$15m is allocated for Don Dale and $7m for a new youth justice precinct in 
Alice Springs. The head of Territory Families, Ken Davies, stressed that there 
would be wide consultations and that interim repairs would not be in lieu of a 
replacement facility.

He told Guardian Australia there was more exploration to be done but a more 
modern and therapeutic facility was on the cards. It would be far removed from 
the current Don Dale environment, except perhaps the recreation centre.

The old Don Dale, while dilapidated beyond use and too small, was at least 
designed for youth and the site could be repurposed, he noted.

Standing in an administration room of the empty former centre, two youth 
justice officers said morale was low among the staff since Four Corners aired 
its episode on guards teargassing, stripping and restraining detainees.

“A lot of the staff members involved in those incidents no longer work with 
us,” said Luke. “We’re what’s left over so we have to wear and cop it. I guess 
it’s the price we pay for where we work, but I personally enjoy the work.”

Both men are Indigenous and have worked in youth justice for a number of 
years. They said they had good engagement with the detainees. “There are two 
sides to the story, and eventually we’ll be able to tell ours.”

Much of that story centred on the escape of a teenage detainee from his 
isolation cell in the behavioural management unit, sparking a disturbance that 
guards responded to with teargas.

Gooda and Whilte – both visibly affected – inspected the cells where boys were 
teargassed, noting where one escaped by breaking through a hatch to reach a 
door handle that had accidentally been left unlocked.

A second cell bore the marks of further disturbance – a wide hole torn through 
the tough wire mesh, and a large circle of broken plaster surrounding the 
intercom.

“This is where that young fella was held 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/26/abu-ghraib-images-children-detention-australia-public-inquiry>
,” said Gooda, sitting in one of the cells. “Still is somewhere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/07/dylan-voller-fears-reprisals-if-he-gives-royal-commission-evidence-from-prison-mother>
, in a place like this.”

The commission will resume the public hearing on Thursday.
