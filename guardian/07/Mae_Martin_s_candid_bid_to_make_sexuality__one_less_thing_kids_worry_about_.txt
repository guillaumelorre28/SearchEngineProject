Woman’s Hour host Jenni Murray raised hackles the other week when she suggested
children should study pornography in the classroom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/educate-teenagers-porn-attitudes-sex-parents-schools>
. The idea made some squirm – but only because there’s no consensus on where we 
should get our sex education, and how. Few, I suspect, would propose comedy as 
the choice pedagogic tool – but after listening toMae Martin’s Guide to 
21st-Century Sexuality <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0802xhk> on Radio 4, I 
think they might be missing a trick. Adapted fromMartin’s recent stage show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/23/mae-martin-review-invisible-dot> 
addressing her own, hard-to-pin-down sexuality, it’s a smart series – as well 
judged an example as you’ll find of comedy splitting the difference between 
opinion, enlightenment and entertainment.

The series comprises four short episodes; if you pounce, you can still hear 
them all on iPlayer. They’re basically four connected 15-minute standup sets, 
bookended by Martin putting the comedy into context. “Forty per cent of young 
people no longer identify as gay or straight,” she’ll tell us, by way of an 
introduction to an episode about the thorniness of labels. It’s a subject the 
Canadian seems well qualified to discuss, given that – notwithstanding that 
nowadays her real first name, she jokes, is “lesbian comedian” – her 
hyper-liberal parents didn’t label Mae in any way.

That’s part of what makes the show effective. It never sounds like Martin’s on 
her soapbox, rather that she’s genuinely bamboozled that anyone wastes energy – 
fury, even – fretting about who wants to sleep with whom. She never had to come 
out to her parents, she says, because they never made the common assumption 
that their kids would be straight in the first place. In the event, Martin 
rejects the label “gay”, much to her friends’ dismay (“You lied with your 
hair!”), and indeed the very idea that we might be defined (“I’d like you to 
meet my lesbian friends”) by who we most recently slept with.

It’s her best work so far, I think. The neurotic self-deprecation that 
sometimes undermines her standup has ended up on the cutting room floor here. 
But the honesty and lack of cynicism remain, as indeed do the goofy linguistic 
quirks (“offish definish” for “official definition”) that amusingly telegraph 
her misfiring bid to be cool.

It’s an unassuming show, with no loftier ambition than to “make sexuality one 
less thing our kids have to worry about, [so we can] free up all this 
brain-space for them”. And yet, it’s a quietly radical one, signposting the way 
to a post-identity politics era in which “lesbian comedy” and “gay comedian” 
(designations that were themselves at the vanguard of change until recently) 
might start to sound frightfully declasse. And all this at a time when gender 
(as distinct from sexuality) isitself undergoing a conceptual revolution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/29/harry-hill-pregnant-man-ban-ofcom-trans-people-comedy>
, as confidence ebbs from those trusty categories “male” and “female” and the 
spectrum replaces the binary as the model to which we all default.

It’s a fine example of how comedy can ease us into a contentious subject, as 
we submit to Martin’s humour, ingenuousness and obvious good faith. “It would 
be interesting if we could experiment with eliminating the terms,” she muses, 
and the possibility opens up of a world where no one’s sexuality is 
straitjacketed by categories, where people might love who they please and never 
be considered anything other than simply human.
