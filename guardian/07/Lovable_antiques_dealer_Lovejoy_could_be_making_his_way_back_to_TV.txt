Lovejoy, the lovable rogue antiques dealer whose tales became a staple of 
Sunday night TV in the late 80s and early 90s, could return to the small screen 
.

Tony Jordan, writer of popular dramas including Hustle and Life on Mars, has 
returned to the original source material of Jonathan Gash’s Lovejoy novels – 
there are 24 – to develop a new script, according toRadioTimes.com 
<http://www.radiotimes.com>. The project is in its “very early days”, according 
to Jordan’s production company Red Planet Pictures, and so far has no 
broadcaster attached.

Lovejoy, set in East Anglia, ran on BBC1 for six series between 1986 and 1994, 
givingIan McShane <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ian-mcshane> his most 
high profile UK TV role, after an acting career that had already spanned more 
than 20 years.

He went on to star in HBO’s gritty western Deadwood and enjoyed a late career 
renaissance in films including Sexy Beast, Pirates of the Caribbean: On 
Stranger Tides and Snow White and the Huntsman. He has previously said he is 
unlikely to return as the mullet-haired hero of the Lovejoy stories.

However, Phyllis Logan, who played Lady Jane Felsham and is now housekeeper 
Mrs Hughes in Downton Abbey, told RadioTimes.com she would return to the show 
“in a heartbeat”.
