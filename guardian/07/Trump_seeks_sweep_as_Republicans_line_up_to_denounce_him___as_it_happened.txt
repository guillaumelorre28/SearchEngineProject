“Oh, it’s gonna be big,” Peter Goldberg, 67, chairman of the Alaska Republican 
party,told Julia O’Malley in Anchorage. 

“By big I mean I think last time we did this four years ago, there a little 
more than 15,000 [votes counted] - I’m expecting 20,000. But at the rate that 
phone out there is ringing, it may exceed that … I think the primary factor is 
the incredible dissatisfaction with what Barack Obama has done to the country 
in the last seven years … Because I’m chair of the party, my position (on which 
candidate to support) is neutral. Not even my wife knows.”

There are two ways that states holding primaries can be game-changers today - 
either they have a lot of delegates up for grabs or else they’re a battleground 
state where polling suggests that we’ll see a closely fought race.

The Texas Republican primary will be both. With 155 Republican delegates up 
for grabs, the state simply has a larger say in the presidential nomination 
process than others (the Dallas area alone has more Republican delegates than 
all of New Hampshire). But it’s also one of just three states today whereDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> doesn’t have a clear 
polling lead among Republicans.

 Texas has the most delegates up for grabs of any state today by far 
Photograph: The Guardian 
Twelve separate polls of Republican voters were conducted in Texas in February 
(other states voting today don’t have as much data available - partly because 
they’re less politically influential so pollsters are less interested in 
conducting expensive surveys there). Ted Cruz has been the Republican 
frontrunner in all but one of those but the size of his lead has varied 
considerably from poll to poll.Real Clear Politics 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/tx/texas_republican_presidential_primary-3622.html>
 uses the average across all of them and their latest numbers suggest that Cruz 
is 9 percentage points ahead of Trump.


The exact number of percentage points matters here. Unlike the Democratic 
process (where delegates are generally assigned to vote for presidential 
candidates in proportion to votes) the way that Republicans translate votes 
into delegatesvaries 
<http://frontloading.blogspot.com/p/2016-republican-delegate-allocation-by.html>
 from state to state. In Texas, the formula is pretty complex butthis explainer 
<http://interactives.dallasnews.com/2016/texas-delegates/> from the Dallas 
Morning News does a good job of clearing things up:


Republican candidates can collect delegates in two ways. If they do well in a 
congressional district, they stand to gain up to three delegates per district. 
Statewide vote totals determine which candidate or candidates get an additional 
47 delegates. If a GOP candidate wins more than half of the votes in Texas, he 
will get all 47 of those delegates. Anything less and the candidates have to 
share.

Other states to keep an eye on tonight are Massachusetts (where Hillary 
Clinton’s lead is just 6.7 percentage points - ifBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> doesn’t do well here, his 
electability could be seriously damaged going forward) and Virginia (where 
there are 49 Republican delegates up for grabs which will be split in 
proportion to the votes cast today).

If you were in Little Rock, you woke up to something like this today, the 
neighborhood notwithstanding. Under normal circumstances, this sort of weather 
is not a problem; you live in the south, so it happens pretty much from summer 
into fall with great regularity. What it might’ve done, however, is stifle your 
urge for manning the polls or standing on street corners waving signs.

Not that it likely mattered. Early voting begin two weeks ago, and Arkansas 
has experienced near record levels of early voters 
<http://m.swtimes.com/news/politics/early-voting-arkansas-record-levels-ahead-tuesday-s-primary>
.

Campaign workers I spoke to said that chances for converting voters had in 
many cases been thwarted by early voting. Everyone from friends to former 
Governor Jim Guy Tucker reported seeing full precincts on opening day, with 
steady flows of voters, a tableau that has been repeated at lunch hour for 
every day since.

Basically, between early voting, the lack of competitive Democratic state-wide 
races and a 25 point lead forHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> here, this was probably 
over before the rain started.

If one group is liable to be harmed by inclement weather, it’s likely to be 
late-breaking voters and converts forDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, the sort of people who might 
not have been active enough to get out and cast a ballot early.

While Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> holds a slight 
lead over Trump and Rubio, either of the latter two candidates can erase that 
if their voters are motivated. Rubio recently received an endorsement from 
Republican governor Asa Hutchinson, and Trump recently hired Mike Huckabee’s 
daughter to run his outreach here in the state.

Also, the sun just came out. Time to find out whose ass it’s going to shine on.

Sam Levin

Lauren Vidak is a big Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> supporter – but she won’t 
be caucusing for the Vermont senator Tuesday night. Like many voters, the 
25-year-old Denver resident has to work at 7pm– the only time that Coloradans 
can participate in the Super Tuesday elections.

“I’m frustrated that I’m unable to vote and this is the only opportunity I 
have,” said Vidak, who works as a nanny and is unable to take off for the 
caucus, which can last for an hour or more. “It does discourage turnout. With 
the caucus system, I’m missing my only chance to do it ... I’m concerned other 
voters won’t be able to get out and vote.”

Compared to a traditional primary election, where voters can cast their ballot 
any time during the day, the unique time commitment of a caucus can deter many 
voters, especially working class residents who have family and job obligations 
they can’t neglect. In Colorado, voters have also grown accustomed to the 
luxury ofmail-in ballots 
<http://www.denverpost.com/editorials/ci_26909639/vote-confidence-mail-elections-colorado>
, which for many is a very convenient way to participate in elections and can 
encourage higher turnout, Vidak noted.

Vidak said she is encouraging her friends who are available to vote to show up 
on Tuesday night for Sanders. “He’s someone I can trust. If he’s said it, he’s 
done it. He’s a candidate who says what he believes and that matches how he’s 
voted in the past,” she said. “He’s really working to even the playing field 
... and there’s something nice about a politician who hasn’t been entrenched in 
politics.”

Unlike some Sanders supporters, Vidak, however, said she is not a Hillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> hater and will 
support the former secretary of state if she wins the nomination. “I will vote 
Democrat no matter what.”

Colin, 25, works at an upscale coffee house just north of downtown 
Minneapolis, at the base of a new construction apartment building with rentals 
he can’t afford. But as well as spending his days as a full-time barista, 
serving $5 pour-overs to well-off Minnesotans who drink them in front of their 
laptops, he also serves upscale grilled cheese sandwiches out of a food truck 
and hosts a bar trivia night to make ends meet.

“I know I’m a walking stereotype” he said. “Of course I support who I support” 
- which isBernie Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>.

Colin, who is looking for a full-time job in a non-profit serving college-age 
young people, says that he supports Sanders “on principles” like health care, 
job security assistance and Sanders’ college tuition plans (“I’m out of school, 
but I work three non-college-mandatory jobs.”)

He caucused for Barack Obama in 2008, when he was 18, but he’s not optimistic 
about tonight’s caucus results. “I’ve got this vibe right now where I don’t 
think he’s going to win the nomination, whichsucks,” he said. “But I still want 
my voice to be heard.”

And when it comes to the general, he isn’t going to stay home even if Sanders 
isn’t on the ballot. “I’m still going to vote Democratic,” he vowed.

Lucia Graves

The struggle for the anti-establishment vote in Virginia is very much a mirror 
image of what’s happening at the national level asDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Ted Cruz vie for 
Republican voters ahead of Tuesday’s primary,writes the Guardian’s Lucia Graves 
from Lynchburg, Virginia.

Cruz has invested significant energy in the state, launching his bid for the 
presidency at the evangelical stronghold Liberty University back in March of 
2015. But almost exactly a year after he first came to town, it is Trump who’s 
been making inroads in the state, attracting a wide array of unlikely voting 
groups such as evangelical voters and military veterans.

Military veteran Jon Whitman, 38, is an outspoken Trump supporter and at a 
rally on the campus of Radford University Monday, he praised the mogul as 
really “smart” and a better candidate than the media gives him credit for. 
Trump’s record on the military was criticized after he made derogatory comments 
about John McCain’s torture despite never having served in the military 
himself. But such things don’t bother Whitman. “I honestly there’s a lot of 
media hype about Trump and basically I don’t go off of a lot of media hype,” he 
said. “That’s why I’m here today.”

Similarly, the Guardian’s conversations with Republican voters in Southeastern 
Virginia have found supporters are indifferent to many of Trump’s other 
stumbles, such as his hesitancy to denounce his support from white supremacist 
David Duke, something Virginia resident Josh Neuse, 31, denounced as an 
“irrelevant issue.”

The candidate’s promise to “Make America Great Again” is a concept that plays 
well in poor rural parts of Virginia, where for many years, coal was king. 
“We’re going to bring the coal energy back 100%,” Trump said in his speech 
yesterday. “It’s devastated for no reason whatsoever so we’re going to bring 
coal back.”

Trump’s wider magnetism was evident at the wild rally at Radford, where 
hundreds were turned away at the doors after the event reached capacity, and 
even in places that should be strongholds for the devout Cruz – like Liberty 
University – Trump is making gains. Just before Iowa cauuses Liberty University 
leader Jerry Falwell endorsed Trump, and though Trump didn’t win the 
evangelical vote in Iowa, he did manage to best Cruz in the religious state of 
South Carolina. The Guardian is on campus at Liberty and will be filing 
dispatches from the schools on-campus student voting location Tuesday afternoon.

Matthew Teague

In rural Mount Vernon, Alabama, people drove from miles around to the Mount 
Vernon civic center, a tiny white building with a sign saying “VOTE HERE” on 
the front door.

The electorate in Mt. Vernon, at least by midday, seemed uniformly 
gray-haired. Outside, 84-year-old Earl Middleton climbed the steps to vote. 
“There’s only one man to vote for,” he said. “I served my country, and I’m 
voting for the one man who will keep our military strong.”

Who is that? “Donald Trump!” he said. 

Further south, on Mobile Bay, in the relatively affluent town of Fairhope, a 
woman in her 20s named Megrez Mosher voted. She felt stunned by the demographic 
- gray-haired, like rural Mt. Vernon, and said she was “all about shaming 
people into doing their civic duty”.

So she went home and posted on Facebook: “I just voted. I was the only person 
my age in the civic center. Millennials and Gen Xers get out and vote!! I don’t 
really care who you vote for, but don’t keep posting memes and sharing articles 
on Facebook if you do not fulfill your civic duty.”

Concerned with a “lack of civility” in the current discourse among the five 
remaining members of the Republican presidential field, retired neurosurgeonBen 
Carson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> has personally called 
upon the candidates to join in a private meeting in Detroit, Michigan before 
the next Republican presidential debate this Thursday.

“The American people deserve so much more from the candidates who are seeking 
the most powerful position in the free world, and I share their concern that 
this race has taken a turn for the worse, to the point of embarrassment on the 
world stage,” Carson said in a statement.

“A house divided cannot stand, and it is imperative the Republican Party 
exhibit unity by the candidates coming together with a pledge to talk about the 
many serious problems facing our country, instead of personally attacking each 
other.”

With Tennessee being among the Super Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday> states voting today, the 
Guardian’s Adam Gabbatt headed to Nashville to find out how catchy some of this 
year’s most famous campaign lines would sound if they made it into a song.

He met up with local bands Sweet Cheeks 
<https://sweetcheeks.bandcamp.com/releases> and the Strumms 
<https://www.facebook.com/thestrumms/> and challenged them to a freestyle music 
contest. It went... well, you can see for yourself.

And on Super Tuesday, the spell was broken 
<https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/704728387282010112>. 

For 88 days, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> avoided questions from 
her traveling press corps, who had resorted to shouting inquiries at her while 
she glad-handed and posed for selfies with supporters after events.

After meeting with voters at a coffee shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Clinton 
turned to the traveling press and let them fire away. Here are some highlights, 
thanks to the strong social media game of the embeds who follow her.

On Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> failing to 
disavow David Duke: ”I was very disappointed that he did not disavow what 
appears to be support from David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan that is exactly kind 
of the statement hat should be repudiated upon hearing it.”

Clinton on whether Sanders has a path forward after SuperTuesday: “We just 
want to do as well as we can... Let’s see what voters decide in all these 
states that are lined up today and then we’ll take stock after it’s over.”

On Trump becoming the nominee: “Obviously he’s done very well. He could be on 
the path.”

At the end of the coffee shop visit, Clinton was confronted by a 
Somali-American resident who asked the candidate about her “super predator” 
comments. According to reporters who were there, the conversation ended with 
Clinton suggesting:“Why don’t you run for something?”

In January, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley took aim at Republican 
frontrunnerDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in 
her state of the union rebuttal, warning that aggressively anti-immigrant 
rhetoric threatens “the dream that is America” in a speech that was widely seen 
as a critique of Trump’s candidacy.

“During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the 
angriest voices,” Haley said at the time. “We must resist that temptation. No 
one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions 
should ever feel unwelcome in this country.”

Haley’s latest critique is slightly less veiled:
Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) 
@realDonaldTrump <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump>, Bless your heart.
 <https://twitter.com/nikkihaley/status/704756959019474948> March 1, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/nikkihaley/status/704756959019474948> 
As anyone who grew up in the American South or enjoys Steel Magnolias - or 
both, we ain’t judging - knows, “bless your heart” is a fantastically flexible 
phrase that can range from expressing Christian pity to being the verbal 
equivalent of a middle finger with a French manicure.

Trump, who grew up in the New York borough of Queens and may not be familiar 
with the phrase’s nuances, has not yet responded to Haley’s tweet.

Denver resident Maile Rains wants to know which presidential candidate can 
beat Donald Trump in the general election. That’s a key factor for the 
36-year-old registered Democrat, who said she has not yet decided who she will 
support at the Colorado caucus on Tuesday – noting thatHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> seems too untrustworthy 
and Bernie Sanders’ socialism seems too radical.

“My feeling is anybody is better than Trump,” said Rains, a stay-at-home mom. 
“Trump is out there like this cartoon character, and no other candidates’ 
voices are being heard.”

During the final 48 hours before the high-stakes caucus, Sanders volunteers 
canvassing in the Mile High City attempted to sway Rains and many other 
on-the-fence Democratic voters that the Vermont senator is the candidate with 
progressive values who could energize liberals and ultimately beat theGOP 
frontrunner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/23/donald-trump-wins-nevada-caucuses-results>
 in November.

With its large population of independent voters 
<https://www.cpr.org/news/story/young-independent-voters-flex-political-muscle-colorado>
, Colorado is a critical battleground for Sanders – previously a longtime 
independent – as he fights to score strategic victories inSuper Tuesdayraces 
across the country 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/super-tuesday-presidential-candidates-cheat-sheet-need-know>
.

After Clinton’s decisive win in South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/27/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-south-carolina-primary>
 illustrated her opponent’s struggle to gain traction in the south, Colorado 
has become particularly crucial for Sanders, with pundits saying a loss would 
be a devastating blow to his campaign – potentially insurmountable depending on 
how successful Clinton is in other parts of the south on Tuesday.

In between answering phones and organizing canvassers inside a bustling 
campaign office Monday afternoon, Dulce Saenz, Sanders’ Colorado director, 
explained how volunteers last year pushed independent voters to register as
Democrats <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> so they could 
participate in the caucus – and support Sanders.

“Colorado is particularly interesting, because when we came on as a campaign, 
there was already a huge volunteer infrastructure,” she said.

Unaffiliated voters in Colorado continue to be the state’s largest voting bloc 
<http://www.coloradoindependent.com/157996/who-really-wants-a-caucus-in-colorado-why-not-have-a-primary>
, forming a constituency of roughly 1m people who can’t participate in the 
caucuses. But Saenz pointed out that more than30,000 people 
<http://www.npr.org/2016/02/28/467961962/sick-of-political-parties-unaffiliated-voters-are-changing-politics>
 have registered with the Colorado Democratic party in recent months – a shift 
that she hopes will translate to a win for Sanders.

Many voters – herself included – switched from independent to Democrat last 
year so they could caucus for Sanders, she said.

Kim Austin, a 45-year-old Denver voter, said she has always been registered as 
an independent, but was persuaded to join the Democratic party after hearing 
Sanders’ position on universal health care. “Clinton’s a liar, she’s corrupt 
and she’s bought,” she added.

Experts say that the format of a caucus – in which voters select delegates 
<http://www.coloradodems.org/action/caucus-2016> in a town hall-style meeting – 
could also work in Sanders’ favor in Colorado. That’s because the caucus is a 
time commitment that requires all participants to show up at 7pm, often 
resulting in low turnout.

Democrats who do end up caucusing tend to be the most invested in the race and 
often have more progressive views, said Peter Hanson, assistant professor of 
political science at the University of Denver. “If Sanders supporters are as 
enthusiastic as many believe them to be, it’s entirely possible they’ll show up 
more than Clinton supporters.”

The caucus model was a key reason Clinton lost by a wide margin against Barack 
Obama in the2008 Colorado race 
<http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/states/CO.html>, said 
Robert Loevy, professor emeritus of political science at Colorado College. He 
expects a similar struggle for Clinton on Tuesday: “Colorado could be a bright 
spot for Bernie Sanders on what might otherwise be a grim day for him.”

Sanders has also spent more on Colorado television ads 
<https://www.cpr.org/news/story/clinton-and-sanders-flood-colorado-ads-heres-what-costs>
 than his opponent.

Clinton’s Colorado supporters argued that she’s the only candidate who can 
take on Trump – and said they were hopeful Latino voters would help her beat 
Sanders at the caucus.

“It’s going to be close, but I think that we have a really good shot,” said 
Ken Salazar, former US secretary of the interior, after rallying Clinton 
supporters inside a crowded campaign office in Aurora Monday evening. “She is 
head and shoulders above everybody, includingBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>, in how she has stood up 
for the Latino community.”

Lynetta Miller, a 64-year-old Clinton volunteer and Aurora resident, said it 
seemed clear Colorado voters who support Obama are eager to back the former 
secretary of state. “She’s been fighting for us for so long … it’s time we 
support her,” she said, adding that Clinton supporters were working to mobilize 
a large turnout. “They’re taking their neighbors to the caucus. They’re taking 
their friends to the caucus. And that’s important.”

Approached by a Sanders’ volunteer at his house, Tom Chatfield, a 65-year-old 
registered Denver Democrat, said he felt Clinton was the much safer choice. 
“Hillary’s more practical, even if she is part of the establishment,” he said. 
“Bernie’s got his head in the clouds … Let’s support Hillary now before we get 
one of the crazies in there.”

Chatfield, however, said he wasn’t sure if he was going to have time to attend 
the caucus.

Speaking outside his polling place in Houston on Tuesday, Ted Cruz suggested 
thatMarco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> should 
consider dropping out after Tuesday.

The Texas senator told reporters “I believe we are going to do very, very well 
here in Texas. It’s gonna be up to Texans to make their decision. But there is 
no doubt that any candidate who cannot win his home state has real problems.”

He added that “any candidate that wakes up tomorrow morning that has not won 
any states, for any candidate that wakes up tomorrow morning and has won a 
negligible number of delegates, it’s time to start thinking about coming 
together and unifying and a clear choice.”

The statements represented a clear shot at Rubio, who has yet to win a state 
and is lagging in polls in his home state of Florida. However, despite this, 
Rubio has become an establishment favorite and party elected officials are 
coalescing around his candidacy, much to the irritation of the Cruz campaign.

While Cruz is favored in his home state of Texas and has the potential to win 
other states onSuper Tuesday <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday>
, Rubio’s campaign has already conceded that the Florida senator will be shut 
out yet again in Tuesday’s contests.

Spokespeople for Rubio’s campaign did not immediately return a request for 
comment. After engaging for months in a bitter battle with Cruz, the Florida 
senator has recently shifted his focus to attackingDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as part of a last-ditch 
effort to blunt the frontrunner’s momentum.

There are two kinds of people in Burlington, Vermont: those who believe there 
are no Hillary supporters here, and those who believe there must be, somewhere, 
but that they’re all in hiding.

Inside Dobra Tea Parlor yesterday, incense was burning at the foot of a bronze 
bodhisattva. Two customers were drinking tea and writing somberly in their 
journals. In a corner, a pair of young women discussed alternative high 
schools. I leaned across the counter and asked, softly, where I might be able 
to find someone who was voting for Clinton.

The tea barista, Sam Hughes, looked shocked. “I don’t know anyone who would 
admit to being a Hillary supporter,” the 25-year-old told me, as I paid for a 
gluten-free tea cake.
 “He’s started a revolution for sure,” said Burlington resident Molly Rhoads, 
24, who recently got a free Bernie tattoo from a local tattoo parlor.

Burlington is where Bernie started his political career, as a socialist mayor 
who wrotestrongly worded dispatches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate>
 to world leaders about the importance of military disarmament, and it’s still 
his home base. In the downtown shopping district, where insistent classical 
music is piped out over the street, passers-by laughed or stared when I asked 
about Hillary Clinton. Where could I find a Hillary supporter? “Try Georgia,” 
said a white-bearded man in a fleece vest.

In The Bern Gallery, a smoke shop that had not been named in honor of the 
Vermont senator, 24-year-old Molly Rhoads shook her head. She pulled up her 
sleeve to bare her elbow, which sported a Bernie tattoo. She had gotten it at a 
local parlor that has been giving away free tattoos in support of the 
candidate. “He has started a revolution for sure,” she said.

Several Burlingtonians told me they believed local Hillary supporters existed. 
They just didn’t know where to find them.

Outside of city hall, I thought I had finally struck gold. 
Seventy-six-year-old Sunny Long told me she was a Hillary supporter. “We all 
love Bernie, but we think Clinton has the global experience that’s lacking in 
Bernie,” she said.

I asked her how long she had lived in Burlington. “Ten days,” she said. She 
had just moved here from Florida.

Feeling discouraged, I headed to the town’s independent bookstore, the 
Phoenix. Maybe the booksellers would have a deeper network of sources. At 
first, Phil Clingenpeel was stumped. By a Hillary supporter, he asked, did I 
mean someone who liked Hillary, or someone who supports hermore than Bernie?

The latter, I told him.

He thought for a while. He did know someone who knew someone who supported 
Hillary, but he wasn’t sure if that person actually lived in Burlington. His 
coworker had a better idea: she had a friend who had actually hosted a Hillary 
event at his house last week.

“I’ve sort of come out of the closet, as it were, within the past month,” Nate 
Orshan told me, when I drove out to the renovated woolen mill where he works to 
interview him.

Orshan, 48, is a web analyst who has lived in Burlington most of his life. “I 
think I’ve voted for [Bernie] every singe election I could up until now,” he 
said.

Being a Hillary supporter here is “tough,” he told me. “Sometimes I feel like 
that boy in the story, ‘The Emperor Has No Clothes.’” There’s a lot of love for 
Bernie, and and I understand it, and I feel it, too…I just feel that he doesn’t 
have the support nationally that he’s going to need.”

Many Bernie supporters, he said, “fail to see that a lot of the country is 
indeed very conservative, and, in fact, very religious. It’s not a question of 
his Judaism, it’s a question of his secularism, that I think is going to be 
such a nonstarter for so many voters across the country.”

Orshan promised to put me in touch with his small network of local Hillary 
fans.

Burlington is “a lonely place” for them right now, his friend Mattison told 
me, when I met her later that afternoon at a local brewery.

“It’s interesting, being out, having friends who aren’t, who are closeted 
Hillary supporters, who will message me on Facebook, or text me or email me, to 
say, ‘Thank you.’ Well, yeah, we have to speak up.”

The 50-year-old believes Hillary is the politician who will actually be able 
to move a progressive agenda forward.
 “Change in this country is not revolution, it’s evolution,” said Mattison, a 
long-time Burlington resident and Hillary Clinton supporter. Photograph: Lois 
Beckett/THE GUARDIAN 
Bernie “definitely speaks to the truth that the system is rigged, but I also 
think the truth of the matter is, Vermont is a very special place, and Bernie 
has never had to work through complicated changes in a complicated political 
sphere,” she said.

“When you see the people who are coming to [Trump’s] rallies, and the things 
that they’re saying—that’s the real America.”

While she loves living here, she said, “I know it’s not real.”

Speaker Paul Ryan: Nominee 'must reject any group or cause that is built on 
bigotry'

Paul Ryan, Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, spoke out on 
the presidential race 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-vote-election-2016-live-updates-campaign-trail-trump-clinton-sanders-cruz-rubio>

people’s prejudices” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-crisis-republican-party-trump-heads-for-victory>
.

Ryan’s comments come in response to the controversy surrounding frontrunner 
Donald Trump’s hesitance to condemn white supremacist David Duke,who has backed 
his campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/donald-trump-former-kkk-leader-david-duke>
. According to Ryan: “If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican 
party … they must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry.”

“Oh, it’s gonna be big,” Peter Goldberg, 67, chairman of the Alaska Republican 
party,told Julia O’Malley in Anchorage. 

“By big I mean I think last time we did this four years ago, there a little 
more than 15,000 [votes counted] - I’m expecting 20,000. But at the rate that 
phone out there is ringing, it may exceed that … I think the primary factor is 
the incredible dissatisfaction with what Barack Obama has done to the country 
in the last seven years … Because I’m chair of the party, my position (on which 
candidate to support) is neutral. Not even my wife knows.”

O'Malley for the Guardian  
There are two ways that states holding primaries can be game-changers today - 
either they have a lot of delegates up for grabs or else they’re a battleground 
state where polling suggests that we’ll see a closely fought race.

The Texas Republican primary will be both. With 155 Republican delegates up 
for grabs, the state simply has a larger say in the presidential nomination 
process than others (the Dallas area alone has more Republican delegates than 
all of New Hampshire). But it’s also one of just three states today whereDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> doesn’t have a clear 
polling lead among Republicans.

 Texas has the most delegates up for grabs of any state today by far 
Photograph: The Guardian 
Twelve separate polls of Republican voters were conducted in Texas in February 
(other states voting today don’t have as much data available - partly because 
they’re less politically influential so pollsters are less interested in 
conducting expensive surveys there). Ted Cruz has been the Republican 
frontrunner in all but one of those but the size of his lead has varied 
considerably from poll to poll.Real Clear Politics 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/tx/texas_republican_presidential_primary-3622.html>
 uses the average across all of them and their latest numbers suggest that Cruz 
is 9 percentage points ahead of Trump.


The exact number of percentage points matters here. Unlike the Democratic 
process (where delegates are generally assigned to vote for presidential 
candidates in proportion to votes) the way that Republicans translate votes 
into delegatesvaries 
<http://frontloading.blogspot.com/p/2016-republican-delegate-allocation-by.html>
 from state to state. In Texas, the formula is pretty complex butthis explainer 
<http://interactives.dallasnews.com/2016/texas-delegates/> from the Dallas 
Morning News does a good job of clearing things up:


Republican candidates can collect delegates in two ways. If they do well in a 
congressional district, they stand to gain up to three delegates per district. 
Statewide vote totals determine which candidate or candidates get an additional 
47 delegates. If a GOP candidate wins more than half of the votes in Texas, he 
will get all 47 of those delegates. Anything less and the candidates have to 
share.

Other states to keep an eye on tonight are Massachusetts (where Hillary 
Clinton’s lead is just 6.7 percentage points - ifBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> doesn’t do well here, his 
electability could be seriously damaged going forward) and Virginia (where 
there are 49 Republican delegates up for grabs which will be split in 
proportion to the votes cast today).

If you were in Little Rock, you woke up to something like this today, the 
neighborhood notwithstanding. Under normal circumstances, this sort of weather 
is not a problem; you live in the south, so it happens pretty much from summer 
into fall with great regularity. What it might’ve done, however, is stifle your 
urge for manning the polls or standing on street corners waving signs.

Not that it likely mattered. Early voting begin two weeks ago, and Arkansas 
has experienced near record levels of early voters 
<http://m.swtimes.com/news/politics/early-voting-arkansas-record-levels-ahead-tuesday-s-primary>
.

Campaign workers I spoke to said that chances for converting voters had in 
many cases been thwarted by early voting. Everyone from friends to former 
Governor Jim Guy Tucker reported seeing full precincts on opening day, with 
steady flows of voters, a tableau that has been repeated at lunch hour for 
every day since.

Basically, between early voting, the lack of competitive Democratic state-wide 
races and a 25 point lead forHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> here, this was probably 
over before the rain started.

If one group is liable to be harmed by inclement weather, it’s likely to be 
late-breaking voters and converts forDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, the sort of people who might 
not have been active enough to get out and cast a ballot early.

While Ted Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> holds a slight 
lead over Trump and Rubio, either of the latter two candidates can erase that 
if their voters are motivated. Rubio recently received an endorsement from 
Republican governor Asa Hutchinson, and Trump recently hired Mike Huckabee’s 
daughter to run his outreach here in the state.

Also, the sun just came out. Time to find out whose ass it’s going to shine on.

Lauren Vidak is a big Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> supporter – but she won’t 
be caucusing for the Vermont senator Tuesday night. Like many voters, the 
25-year-old Denver resident has to work at 7pm– the only time that Coloradans 
can participate in the Super Tuesday elections.

“I’m frustrated that I’m unable to vote and this is the only opportunity I 
have,” said Vidak, who works as a nanny and is unable to take off for the 
caucus, which can last for an hour or more. “It does discourage turnout. With 
the caucus system, I’m missing my only chance to do it ... I’m concerned other 
voters won’t be able to get out and vote.”

Compared to a traditional primary election, where voters can cast their ballot 
any time during the day, the unique time commitment of a caucus can deter many 
voters, especially working class residents who have family and job obligations 
they can’t neglect. In Colorado, voters have also grown accustomed to the 
luxury ofmail-in ballots 
<http://www.denverpost.com/editorials/ci_26909639/vote-confidence-mail-elections-colorado>
, which for many is a very convenient way to participate in elections and can 
encourage higher turnout, Vidak noted.

Vidak said she is encouraging her friends who are available to vote to show up 
on Tuesday night for Sanders. “He’s someone I can trust. If he’s said it, he’s 
done it. He’s a candidate who says what he believes and that matches how he’s 
voted in the past,” she said. “He’s really working to even the playing field 
... and there’s something nice about a politician who hasn’t been entrenched in 
politics.”

Unlike some Sanders supporters, Vidak, however, said she is not a Hillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> hater and will 
support the former secretary of state if she wins the nomination. “I will vote 
Democrat no matter what.”

 
Colin, 25, works at an upscale coffee house just north of downtown 
Minneapolis, at the base of a new construction apartment building with rentals 
he can’t afford. But as well as spending his days as a full-time barista, 
serving $5 pour-overs to well-off Minnesotans who drink them in front of their 
laptops, he also serves upscale grilled cheese sandwiches out of a food truck 
and hosts a bar trivia night to make ends meet.

“I know I’m a walking stereotype” he said. “Of course I support who I support” 
- which isBernie Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>.

Colin, who is looking for a full-time job in a non-profit serving college-age 
young people, says that he supports Sanders “on principles” like health care, 
job security assistance and Sanders’ college tuition plans (“I’m out of school, 
but I work three non-college-mandatory jobs.”)

He caucused for Barack Obama in 2008, when he was 18, but he’s not optimistic 
about tonight’s caucus results. “I’ve got this vibe right now where I don’t 
think he’s going to win the nomination, whichsucks,” he said. “But I still want 
my voice to be heard.”

And when it comes to the general, he isn’t going to stay home even if Sanders 
isn’t on the ballot. “I’m still going to vote Democratic,” he vowed.
 
The struggle for the anti-establishment vote in Virginia is very much a mirror 
image of what’s happening at the national level asDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Ted Cruz vie for 
Republican voters ahead of Tuesday’s primary,writes the Guardian’s Lucia Graves 
from Lynchburg, Virginia.

Cruz has invested significant energy in the state, launching his bid for the 
presidency at the evangelical stronghold Liberty University back in March of 
2015. But almost exactly a year after he first came to town, it is Trump who’s 
been making inroads in the state, attracting a wide array of unlikely voting 
groups such as evangelical voters and military veterans.

Military veteran Jon Whitman, 38, is an outspoken Trump supporter and at a 
rally on the campus of Radford University Monday, he praised the mogul as 
really “smart” and a better candidate than the media gives him credit for. 
Trump’s record on the military was criticized after he made derogatory comments 
about John McCain’s torture despite never having served in the military 
himself. But such things don’t bother Whitman. “I honestly there’s a lot of 
media hype about Trump and basically I don’t go off of a lot of media hype,” he 
said. “That’s why I’m here today.”

Similarly, the Guardian’s conversations with Republican voters in Southeastern 
Virginia have found supporters are indifferent to many of Trump’s other 
stumbles, such as his hesitancy to denounce his support from white supremacist 
David Duke, something Virginia resident Josh Neuse, 31, denounced as an 
“irrelevant issue.”

The candidate’s promise to “Make America Great Again” is a concept that plays 
well in poor rural parts of Virginia, where for many years, coal was king. 
“We’re going to bring the coal energy back 100%,” Trump said in his speech 
yesterday. “It’s devastated for no reason whatsoever so we’re going to bring 
coal back.”

Trump’s wider magnetism was evident at the wild rally at Radford, where 
hundreds were turned away at the doors after the event reached capacity, and 
even in places that should be strongholds for the devout Cruz – like Liberty 
University – Trump is making gains. Just before Iowa cauuses Liberty University 
leader Jerry Falwell endorsed Trump, and though Trump didn’t win the 
evangelical vote in Iowa, he did manage to best Cruz in the religious state of 
South Carolina. The Guardian is on campus at Liberty and will be filing 
dispatches from the schools on-campus student voting location Tuesday afternoon.
 
In rural Mount Vernon, Alabama, people drove from miles around to the Mount 
Vernon civic center, a tiny white building with a sign saying “VOTE HERE” on 
the front door.

The electorate in Mt. Vernon, at least by midday, seemed uniformly 
gray-haired. Outside, 84-year-old Earl Middleton climbed the steps to vote. 
“There’s only one man to vote for,” he said. “I served my country, and I’m 
voting for the one man who will keep our military strong.”

Who is that? “Donald Trump!” he said. 

Further south, on Mobile Bay, in the relatively affluent town of Fairhope, a 
woman in her 20s named Megrez Mosher voted. She felt stunned by the demographic 
- gray-haired, like rural Mt. Vernon, and said she was “all about shaming 
people into doing their civic duty”.

So she went home and posted on Facebook: “I just voted. I was the only person 
my age in the civic center. Millennials and Gen Xers get out and vote!! I don’t 
really care who you vote for, but don’t keep posting memes and sharing articles 
on Facebook if you do not fulfill your civic duty.”
 
Concerned with a “lack of civility” in the current discourse among the five 
remaining members of the Republican presidential field, retired neurosurgeonBen 
Carson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> has personally called 
upon the candidates to join in a private meeting in Detroit, Michigan before 
the next Republican presidential debate this Thursday.

“The American people deserve so much more from the candidates who are seeking 
the most powerful position in the free world, and I share their concern that 
this race has taken a turn for the worse, to the point of embarrassment on the 
world stage,” Carson said in a statement.

“A house divided cannot stand, and it is imperative the Republican Party 
exhibit unity by the candidates coming together with a pledge to talk about the 
many serious problems facing our country, instead of personally attacking each 
other.”

With Tennessee being among the Super Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday> states voting today, the 
Guardian’s Adam Gabbatt headed to Nashville to find out how catchy some of this 
year’s most famous campaign lines would sound if they made it into a song.

He met up with local bands Sweet Cheeks 
<https://sweetcheeks.bandcamp.com/releases> and the Strumms 
<https://www.facebook.com/thestrumms/> and challenged them to a freestyle music 
contest. It went... well, you can see for yourself.
 
And on Super Tuesday, the spell was broken 
<https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/704728387282010112>. 

For 88 days, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> avoided questions from 
her traveling press corps, who had resorted to shouting inquiries at her while 
she glad-handed and posed for selfies with supporters after events.

After meeting with voters at a coffee shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Clinton 
turned to the traveling press and let them fire away. Here are some highlights, 
thanks to the strong social media game of the embeds who follow her.

On Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> failing to 
disavow David Duke: ”I was very disappointed that he did not disavow what 
appears to be support from David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan that is exactly kind 
of the statement hat should be repudiated upon hearing it.”

Clinton on whether Sanders has a path forward after SuperTuesday: “We just 
want to do as well as we can... Let’s see what voters decide in all these 
states that are lined up today and then we’ll take stock after it’s over.”

On Trump becoming the nominee: “Obviously he’s done very well. He could be on 
the path.”

At the end of the coffee shop visit, Clinton was confronted by a 
Somali-American resident who asked the candidate about her “super predator” 
comments. According to reporters who were there, the conversation ended with 
Clinton suggesting:“Why don’t you run for something?”

 
In January, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley took aim at Republican 
frontrunnerDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in 
her state of the union rebuttal, warning that aggressively anti-immigrant 
rhetoric threatens “the dream that is America” in a speech that was widely seen 
as a critique of Trump’s candidacy.

“During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the 
angriest voices,” Haley said at the time. “We must resist that temptation. No 
one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions 
should ever feel unwelcome in this country.”

Haley’s latest critique is slightly less veiled:
Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) 
@realDonaldTrump <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump>, Bless your heart.
 <https://twitter.com/nikkihaley/status/704756959019474948> March 1, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/nikkihaley/status/704756959019474948> 
As anyone who grew up in the American South or enjoys Steel Magnolias - or 
both, we ain’t judging - knows, “bless your heart” is a fantastically flexible 
phrase that can range from expressing Christian pity to being the verbal 
equivalent of a middle finger with a French manicure.

Trump, who grew up in the New York borough of Queens and may not be familiar 
with the phrase’s nuances, has not yet responded to Haley’s tweet.
 
Denver resident Maile Rains wants to know which presidential candidate can 
beat Donald Trump in the general election. That’s a key factor for the 
36-year-old registered Democrat, who said she has not yet decided who she will 
support at the Colorado caucus on Tuesday – noting thatHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> seems too untrustworthy 
and Bernie Sanders’ socialism seems too radical.

“My feeling is anybody is better than Trump,” said Rains, a stay-at-home mom. 
“Trump is out there like this cartoon character, and no other candidates’ 
voices are being heard.”

During the final 48 hours before the high-stakes caucus, Sanders volunteers 
canvassing in the Mile High City attempted to sway Rains and many other 
on-the-fence Democratic voters that the Vermont senator is the candidate with 
progressive values who could energize liberals and ultimately beat theGOP 
frontrunner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/23/donald-trump-wins-nevada-caucuses-results>
 in November.

With its large population of independent voters 
<https://www.cpr.org/news/story/young-independent-voters-flex-political-muscle-colorado>
, Colorado is a critical battleground for Sanders – previously a longtime 
independent – as he fights to score strategic victories inSuper Tuesdayraces 
across the country 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/super-tuesday-presidential-candidates-cheat-sheet-need-know>
.

After Clinton’s decisive win in South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/27/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-south-carolina-primary>
 illustrated her opponent’s struggle to gain traction in the south, Colorado 
has become particularly crucial for Sanders, with pundits saying a loss would 
be a devastating blow to his campaign – potentially insurmountable depending on 
how successful Clinton is in other parts of the south on Tuesday.

In between answering phones and organizing canvassers inside a bustling 
campaign office Monday afternoon, Dulce Saenz, Sanders’ Colorado director, 
explained how volunteers last year pushed independent voters to register as
Democrats <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> so they could 
participate in the caucus – and support Sanders.

“Colorado is particularly interesting, because when we came on as a campaign, 
there was already a huge volunteer infrastructure,” she said.

Unaffiliated voters in Colorado continue to be the state’s largest voting bloc 
<http://www.coloradoindependent.com/157996/who-really-wants-a-caucus-in-colorado-why-not-have-a-primary>
, forming a constituency of roughly 1m people who can’t participate in the 
caucuses. But Saenz pointed out that more than30,000 people 
<http://www.npr.org/2016/02/28/467961962/sick-of-political-parties-unaffiliated-voters-are-changing-politics>
 have registered with the Colorado Democratic party in recent months – a shift 
that she hopes will translate to a win for Sanders.

Many voters – herself included – switched from independent to Democrat last 
year so they could caucus for Sanders, she said.

Kim Austin, a 45-year-old Denver voter, said she has always been registered as 
an independent, but was persuaded to join the Democratic party after hearing 
Sanders’ position on universal health care. “Clinton’s a liar, she’s corrupt 
and she’s bought,” she added.

Experts say that the format of a caucus – in which voters select delegates 
<http://www.coloradodems.org/action/caucus-2016> in a town hall-style meeting – 
could also work in Sanders’ favor in Colorado. That’s because the caucus is a 
time commitment that requires all participants to show up at 7pm, often 
resulting in low turnout.

Democrats who do end up caucusing tend to be the most invested in the race and 
often have more progressive views, said Peter Hanson, assistant professor of 
political science at the University of Denver. “If Sanders supporters are as 
enthusiastic as many believe them to be, it’s entirely possible they’ll show up 
more than Clinton supporters.”

The caucus model was a key reason Clinton lost by a wide margin against Barack 
Obama in the2008 Colorado race 
<http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/states/CO.html>, said 
Robert Loevy, professor emeritus of political science at Colorado College. He 
expects a similar struggle for Clinton on Tuesday: “Colorado could be a bright 
spot for Bernie Sanders on what might otherwise be a grim day for him.”

Sanders has also spent more on Colorado television ads 
<https://www.cpr.org/news/story/clinton-and-sanders-flood-colorado-ads-heres-what-costs>
 than his opponent.

Clinton’s Colorado supporters argued that she’s the only candidate who can 
take on Trump – and said they were hopeful Latino voters would help her beat 
Sanders at the caucus.

“It’s going to be close, but I think that we have a really good shot,” said 
Ken Salazar, former US secretary of the interior, after rallying Clinton 
supporters inside a crowded campaign office in Aurora Monday evening. “She is 
head and shoulders above everybody, includingBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders>, in how she has stood up 
for the Latino community.”

Lynetta Miller, a 64-year-old Clinton volunteer and Aurora resident, said it 
seemed clear Colorado voters who support Obama are eager to back the former 
secretary of state. “She’s been fighting for us for so long … it’s time we 
support her,” she said, adding that Clinton supporters were working to mobilize 
a large turnout. “They’re taking their neighbors to the caucus. They’re taking 
their friends to the caucus. And that’s important.”

Approached by a Sanders’ volunteer at his house, Tom Chatfield, a 65-year-old 
registered Denver Democrat, said he felt Clinton was the much safer choice. 
“Hillary’s more practical, even if she is part of the establishment,” he said. 
“Bernie’s got his head in the clouds … Let’s support Hillary now before we get 
one of the crazies in there.”

Chatfield, however, said he wasn’t sure if he was going to have time to attend 
the caucus.
 
Speaking outside his polling place in Houston on Tuesday, Ted Cruz suggested 
thatMarco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> should 
consider dropping out after Tuesday.

The Texas senator told reporters “I believe we are going to do very, very well 
here in Texas. It’s gonna be up to Texans to make their decision. But there is 
no doubt that any candidate who cannot win his home state has real problems.”

He added that “any candidate that wakes up tomorrow morning that has not won 
any states, for any candidate that wakes up tomorrow morning and has won a 
negligible number of delegates, it’s time to start thinking about coming 
together and unifying and a clear choice.”

The statements represented a clear shot at Rubio, who has yet to win a state 
and is lagging in polls in his home state of Florida. However, despite this, 
Rubio has become an establishment favorite and party elected officials are 
coalescing around his candidacy, much to the irritation of the Cruz campaign.

While Cruz is favored in his home state of Texas and has the potential to win 
other states onSuper Tuesday <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday>
, Rubio’s campaign has already conceded that the Florida senator will be shut 
out yet again in Tuesday’s contests.

Spokespeople for Rubio’s campaign did not immediately return a request for 
comment. After engaging for months in a bitter battle with Cruz, the Florida 
senator has recently shifted his focus to attackingDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as part of a last-ditch 
effort to blunt the frontrunner’s momentum.
 
There are two kinds of people in Burlington, Vermont: those who believe there 
are no Hillary supporters here, and those who believe there must be, somewhere, 
but that they’re all in hiding.

Inside Dobra Tea Parlor yesterday, incense was burning at the foot of a bronze 
bodhisattva. Two customers were drinking tea and writing somberly in their 
journals. In a corner, a pair of young women discussed alternative high 
schools. I leaned across the counter and asked, softly, where I might be able 
to find someone who was voting for Clinton.

The tea barista, Sam Hughes, looked shocked. “I don’t know anyone who would 
admit to being a Hillary supporter,” the 25-year-old told me, as I paid for a 
gluten-free tea cake.
 “He’s started a revolution for sure,” said Burlington resident Molly Rhoads, 
24, who recently got a free Bernie tattoo from a local tattoo parlor.

Burlington is where Bernie started his political career, as a socialist mayor 
who wrotestrongly worded dispatches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate>
 to world leaders about the importance of military disarmament, and it’s still 
his home base. In the downtown shopping district, where insistent classical 
music is piped out over the street, passers-by laughed or stared when I asked 
about Hillary Clinton. Where could I find a Hillary supporter? “Try Georgia,” 
said a white-bearded man in a fleece vest.

In The Bern Gallery, a smoke shop that had not been named in honor of the 
Vermont senator, 24-year-old Molly Rhoads shook her head. She pulled up her 
sleeve to bare her elbow, which sported a Bernie tattoo. She had gotten it at a 
local parlor that has been giving away free tattoos in support of the 
candidate. “He has started a revolution for sure,” she said.

Several Burlingtonians told me they believed local Hillary supporters existed. 
They just didn’t know where to find them.

Outside of city hall, I thought I had finally struck gold. 
Seventy-six-year-old Sunny Long told me she was a Hillary supporter. “We all 
love Bernie, but we think Clinton has the global experience that’s lacking in 
Bernie,” she said.

I asked her how long she had lived in Burlington. “Ten days,” she said. She 
had just moved here from Florida.

Feeling discouraged, I headed to the town’s independent bookstore, the 
Phoenix. Maybe the booksellers would have a deeper network of sources. At 
first, Phil Clingenpeel was stumped. By a Hillary supporter, he asked, did I 
mean someone who liked Hillary, or someone who supports hermore than Bernie?

The latter, I told him.

He thought for a while. He did know someone who knew someone who supported 
Hillary, but he wasn’t sure if that person actually lived in Burlington. His 
coworker had a better idea: she had a friend who had actually hosted a Hillary 
event at his house last week.

“I’ve sort of come out of the closet, as it were, within the past month,” Nate 
Orshan told me, when I drove out to the renovated woolen mill where he works to 
interview him.

Orshan, 48, is a web analyst who has lived in Burlington most of his life. “I 
think I’ve voted for [Bernie] every singe election I could up until now,” he 
said.

Being a Hillary supporter here is “tough,” he told me. “Sometimes I feel like 
that boy in the story, ‘The Emperor Has No Clothes.’” There’s a lot of love for 
Bernie, and and I understand it, and I feel it, too…I just feel that he doesn’t 
have the support nationally that he’s going to need.”

Many Bernie supporters, he said, “fail to see that a lot of the country is 
indeed very conservative, and, in fact, very religious. It’s not a question of 
his Judaism, it’s a question of his secularism, that I think is going to be 
such a nonstarter for so many voters across the country.”

Orshan promised to put me in touch with his small network of local Hillary 
fans.

Burlington is “a lonely place” for them right now, his friend Mattison told 
me, when I met her later that afternoon at a local brewery.

“It’s interesting, being out, having friends who aren’t, who are closeted 
Hillary supporters, who will message me on Facebook, or text me or email me, to 
say, ‘Thank you.’ Well, yeah, we have to speak up.”

The 50-year-old believes Hillary is the politician who will actually be able 
to move a progressive agenda forward.
 “Change in this country is not revolution, it’s evolution,” said Mattison, a 
long-time Burlington resident and Hillary Clinton supporter. Photograph: Lois 
Beckett/THE GUARDIAN 
Bernie “definitely speaks to the truth that the system is rigged, but I also 
think the truth of the matter is, Vermont is a very special place, and Bernie 
has never had to work through complicated changes in a complicated political 
sphere,” she said.

“When you see the people who are coming to [Trump’s] rallies, and the things 
that they’re saying—that’s the real America.”

While she loves living here, she said, “I know it’s not real.”
 
Paul Ryan, Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, spoke out on 
the presidential race 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-vote-election-2016-live-updates-campaign-trail-trump-clinton-sanders-cruz-rubio>
 in a press conference this morning, saying“this party does not prey on 
people’s prejudices” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-crisis-republican-party-trump-heads-for-victory>
.

Ryan’s comments come in response to the controversy surrounding frontrunner 
Donald Trump’s hesitance to condemn white supremacist David Duke,who has backed 
his campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/donald-trump-former-kkk-leader-david-duke>
. According to Ryan: “If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican 
party … they must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry.”
