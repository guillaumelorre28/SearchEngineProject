So, that's it until the South Carolina primaries

In what was the most aggressive, most cutthroat debate yet, all five 
candidates - excepting the somnolentBen Carson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> - upped the anger ante in the 
presidential race. Here’s what we learned:

 * Trump has clearly been advised that bullying Jeb Bush is a vote-winner; he 
spent a large amount of his overwhelming speaking time slamming the former 
Florida governor with the political equivalent of pushing his face in a 
toilet-bowl of his own campaign finance history and shouting “you gonna cry? 
you gonna cry?” 
 * Ben Carson used a quote from Stalin - about it being a “healthy body” that 
in order to destroy “you have to undermine three principles: their spiritual 
life, their patriotism, and their morality” -that appears to be utterly and 
entirely fabricated.

 * If Marco Rubio could speak to any historical president, it would be - 
surprise, surprise -Ronald Reagan. 
 * Donald Trump supports Planned Parenthood - at least in part - and is 
willing to say so in a televised Republican debate, which is pretty much 
unprecedented. 
 * Jeb Bush said he’d moon someone, but it is relatively unclear whom, and 
whether he ever went through with it. 
 * Ben Carson wants you to go to his website. He said this at least five times.
 * “Jeez, oh man,” as spoken by John Kasich, is about as accurate a summary of 
the current Republican primary as we’re likely to hear, and is likely to become 
a catchphrase. 
 * Ted Cruz doesn’t speak Spanish. At least, according to a comeback smackdown 
by Marco Rubio, which the Texas senator didn’t deny. 
 * 9/11 is still just as strong an issue in this campaign as it ever was; 
mainly because of Bush’s line that his brother “kept us safe,”and Trump’s 
rebuttal - repeated several times, that “the World Trade Center came down on 
[George W’s] watch.” 
The South Carolina <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> 
primary is Sunday, February 20 - we’ll see you there.

The big question is whether any of that 30%-plus of Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> who are considered Trump 
voters have tired of his act. My guess is they have not, and view his continued 
bellicosity – on display again tonight – as strength.

This was another strong debate from Bush, but it might be too little too late. 
Cruz started strong with his Scalia question, but seemed to fade.

And, one big question heading into this debate is whether Rubio would find his 
bearings and shake off the #RubioBot tag. And, it was the old Rubio: he offered 
smart, concise answers that seemed maybe a bit too smooth but not canned. He 
was more energetic young McKinsey consultant than Lt Commander Data and, for 
the most part, he escaped the unpleasant on-stage bickering and stayed out of 
Trump’s sites.

My grades: Rubio A-; Bush B+; Trump B; Kasich B; Cruz B-; Carson C+. Trump is 
still the favorite to winSouth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> a week from now, but maybe 
Rubio and Bush will get a bit of a lift from this debate.

Trump.

“Politicians are all talk, no action. You’ve seen where they’ve taken you to.” 
Then moves into his stump “we don’t win” spiel.

“We are not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and 
lobbyists.”

Carson next. “This is the first generation expected not to do better than 
their parents. People say this is the new normal, but there’s nothing normal 
about it.”

Quotes Josef Stalin, which is probably a first, then says “we, the people, can 
stop that decline.”

Says, in answer to people who says he can’t win: “not only can we win, but we 
can turn this thing around.”

In what was the most aggressive, most cutthroat debate yet, all five 
candidates - excepting the somnolentBen Carson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> - upped the anger ante in the 
presidential race. Here’s what we learned:

 * Trump has clearly been advised that bullying Jeb Bush is a vote-winner; he 
spent a large amount of his overwhelming speaking time slamming the former 
Florida governor with the political equivalent of pushing his face in a 
toilet-bowl of his own campaign finance history and shouting “you gonna cry? 
you gonna cry?” 
 * Ben Carson used a quote from Stalin - about it being a “healthy body” that 
in order to destroy “you have to undermine three principles: their spiritual 
life, their patriotism, and their morality” -that appears to be utterly and 
entirely fabricated.

 * If Marco Rubio could speak to any historical president, it would be - 
surprise, surprise -Ronald Reagan. 
 * Donald Trump supports Planned Parenthood - at least in part - and is 
willing to say so in a televised Republican debate, which is pretty much 
unprecedented. 
 * Jeb Bush said he’d moon someone, but it is relatively unclear whom, and 
whether he ever went through with it. 
 * Ben Carson wants you to go to his website. He said this at least five times.
 * “Jeez, oh man,” as spoken by John Kasich, is about as accurate a summary of 
the current Republican primary as we’re likely to hear, and is likely to become 
a catchphrase. 
 * Ted Cruz doesn’t speak Spanish. At least, according to a comeback smackdown 
by Marco Rubio, which the Texas senator didn’t deny. 
 * 9/11 is still just as strong an issue in this campaign as it ever was; 
mainly because of Bush’s line that his brother “kept us safe,”and Trump’s 
rebuttal - repeated several times, that “the World Trade Center came down on 
[George W’s] watch.” 
The South Carolina <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> 
primary is Sunday, February 20 - we’ll see you there.
 
The big question is whether any of that 30%-plus of Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> who are considered Trump 
voters have tired of his act. My guess is they have not, and view his continued 
bellicosity – on display again tonight – as strength.

This was another strong debate from Bush, but it might be too little too late. 
Cruz started strong with his Scalia question, but seemed to fade.

And, one big question heading into this debate is whether Rubio would find his 
bearings and shake off the #RubioBot tag. And, it was the old Rubio: he offered 
smart, concise answers that seemed maybe a bit too smooth but not canned. He 
was more energetic young McKinsey consultant than Lt Commander Data and, for 
the most part, he escaped the unpleasant on-stage bickering and stayed out of 
Trump’s sites.

My grades: Rubio A-; Bush B+; Trump B; Kasich B; Cruz B-; Carson C+. Trump is 
still the favorite to winSouth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> a week from now, but maybe 
Rubio and Bush will get a bit of a lift from this debate.
 
Trump.

“Politicians are all talk, no action. You’ve seen where they’ve taken you to.” 
Then moves into his stump “we don’t win” spiel.

“We are not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and 
lobbyists.”
 
Ted Cruz.

“Two branches of government hang in the balance. Not just the presidency, but 
the Supreme Court.”
 
Now Rubio.

“This is a difficult time for our country. Wrong is now considered right, and 
right is now considered wrong.”

But 2016 can be a turning-point. That’s why I’m running for president.
 
Now Bush.

“The next president is going to be confronted with an unforseen challenge ... 
the question for South Carolinians is: who do you want sitting behind the desk 
in the Oval Office.”
 
Carson next. “This is the first generation expected not to do better than 
their parents. People say this is the new normal, but there’s nothing normal 
about it.”

Quotes Josef Stalin, which is probably a first, then says “we, the people, can 
stop that decline.”

Says, in answer to people who says he can’t win: “not only can we win, but we 
can turn this thing around.”
 
Kasich first, with a strong, positive message. “Whoever gets elected here, 
hopefully we’ll solve the issue of wages ... but the spirit of America doesn’t 
come from the top down, the spirit of America rests in us.”
