Ten of the best theatre shows this week

1 Strictly Ballroom
Expect the dancefloor to sizzle with the UK premiere of this musical version 
of Baz Luhrmann’s hit film. The story of success against adversity set in the 
highly competitive world of ballroom dancing will spring few surprises. No 
matter, because with the brilliant Olivier award-winning Drew McOnie both 
directing and choreographing this is likely to set sparks flying.LG
West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, to 21 Jan

2 Bollywood Jack
Tara Arts marks its first Christmas in its new permanent home in Earlsfield 
with an Asian take on a familiar tale. The company already has panto previous 
with versions of Dick Whittington and Cinderella, and now offers a version of 
Jack And The Beanstalk, written by Farrukh Dhondy and directed by artistic 
director Jatinder Verma, making his debut at the venue.MC
Tara Arts, SW18, Wed to 7 Jan

3 Sweet Charity
Sweet Charity is one of the most iconic musical films of the 60s, starring 
Shirley MacLaine and featuring the stunning choreography of Bob Fosse. Derek 
Bond (who returns to Manchester after a praised Little Shop Of Horrors), 
directs the struggles of dancehall hostess Charity Hope Valentine to find love 
in New York, while Aletta Collins choreographs such showstoppers as Big Spender 
and The Rhythm Of Life.MC
Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, Sat to 28 Jan

4 Peter Pan
You are never too old to fly to Neverland, and JM Barrie’s masterpiece 
continues to both delight and horrify in equal measure. Sally Cookson’s 
free-flying, brilliantly playful version was first seen at Bristol Old Vic in 
2012, and unlike its eponymous antihero it should have matured very nicely in 
this revised version. Cookson gives Wendy a more central place in the story and 
there’s plenty of cross-dressing, including Anna Francolini’s Captain Hook.LG
Olivier, SE1, to 4 Feb <https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/peter-pan>

5 Cinderella
Besides its live Sunday-night TV variety show of the 50s and 60s, the London 
Palladium was also known from 1948 to 1987 for its pantomimes. Now, nearly 30 
years on, panto returns to the iconic venue with a star-stuffed Cinderella. 
Natasha J Barnes – Sheridan Smith’s acclaimed understudy in Funny Girl – plays 
the title role, joining Paul O’Grady, Julian Clary, Amanda Holden, Nigel Havers 
and Count Arthur Strong.MC
London Palladium, W1, 10 Dec to 15 Jan <http://www.cinderellapalladium.com/>

6 Annie Get Your Gun
Things go both wild and west in Sheffield, where the brilliant Anna-Jane Casey 
stars as sharpshooting Annie Oakley. It’s an unashamedly old-fashioned show but 
it should be whip-crackingly good fun with songs including There’s No Business 
Like Show Business and Anything You Can Do. Following the departure to 
Chichester Festival Theatre of Daniel Evans, who always delivered a bullseye of 
a festive show, the Crucible will be aiming straight for the heart with this 
one.LG
Crucible, Sheffield, Fri to 21 Jan

7 Saint Joan
Until recently, Gemma Arterton (pictured, right) was best known for her film 
career, but her latter forays on to the stage have seen her theatrical star 
rise in productions including Made In Dagenham, which earned her an Evening 
Standard best newcomer award. Now she tackles a more meaty role – last played 
by Anne-Marie Duff at the National, so no pressure – as Joan of Arc in George 
Bernard Shaw’s powerful state v church drama.MC
Donmar Warehouse, WC2, Fri to 18 Feb

8 Simon Callow
With those fruity tones – like a Christmas pudding – Simon Callow (pictured, 
below) is the go-to actor for all things seasonal, and he’s more than familiar 
with Dickens, too, having written two well-received books about the author. 
With his one-man version of A Christmas Carol, all our Christmases have come at 
once.MC
Arts Theatre, WC2, Thu to 7 Jan

9 The Siege Of Christmas
Contact Young Company comes together with Slung Low’s Alan Lane to make a 
Christmas show with a difference. Taking children and adults on a journey 
around the theatre, this is an interactive adventure in which everyone must 
work together. Lane had terrific fun with 59 Minutes To Save Christmas at the 
Barbican a few years back, so this should be one of the most original Christmas 
shows around.LG
Contact, Manchester, 15 to 22 Dec

10 Black Beauty
Make sure hankies are at the ready when you saddle up for this new version of 
Anna Sewell’s classic story. Three of Scotland’s finest theatre-makers for 
young audiences – Shona Reppe, Andy Manley and Andy Cannon – reimagine the 
story from the point of Black Beauty himself, using storytelling, puppetry and 
music.LG
Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, to 24 Dec
