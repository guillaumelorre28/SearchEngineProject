If peak collaboration were to happen, this is surely the moment. No complaints 
from us, though – this Supreme x Aquascutum collection is one of the nicest of 
the season – and we didn’t see it coming. It works because Aquascutum’s Club 
Check is one of fashion’s most low-key, most flattering and most elevated, 
bridging the line between heritage and modern. The Supreme writing on the back, 
slightly raised and barely discernible, is the classy cherry on the cake – and 
this club jacket might just be the glaze on the cherry on the cake. It’s also 
made from gabardine so it’s showerproof. Showerproof! There’s literally nothing 
wrong with it, except the price. Well, you can’t have everything.
