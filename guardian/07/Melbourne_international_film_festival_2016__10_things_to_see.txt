Longtime devotees of the Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> international film 
festival feel a mixture of nostalgia and horror when recalling the now-closed 
Greater Union complex on Russell Street, where before 2014 they congregated 
every year to sit on back-breaking seats with stains the world’s most advanced 
cleaning technologies couldn’t hope to remove.

The festival has survived just fine in this post-Greater Union era, annually 
offering an eclectic lineup of content from all corners of the globe, with 
screenings at multiple Melbourne venues. Here are 10 things to see and do at 
this year’s Melbourne international film festival.

1. The Handmaiden <http://miff.com.au/program/film/the-handmaiden>

Film reviewers are, of course, a bunch of parasitic know-alls who’d rather 
criticise other people’s art than risk making their own. Every once in a while, 
however, a cranky critic caterpillar emerges as a film-making butterfly.

South Korea has a doozie with Park Chan-wook. The former 
reviewer-cum-out-there auteur’s work (which includes 2005’s sensational Oldboy, 
like Shakespeare through the prism of a hard-boiled B movie) are always weird 
event films. On the menu this year is a racy lesbian romance about a con artist 
who falls for the woman she is planning to steal from.

2. The Neon Demon <http://miff.com.au/program/film/the-neon-demon>

Nicolas Winding Refn is another film-maker whose name is catnip on the 
festival circuit. His last film was the notoriously controversial albeit 
sumptuously shot Bangkok-set Ryan Gosling bloodbath, Only God Forgives. On the 
PR circuit for it, the rabble-rousing Danish writer/directordescribed himself 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/13/nicolas-winding-refn-god-forgives>
 as “a pornographer” with all the kiddish pride of a child wearing a shiny new 
fake sheriff’s badge. Refn’s latest poke in the eye of decency is a 
slow-burning horror movie about a model (Elle Fanning) who encounters a rather 
… unpleasant time when she moves to Los Angeles.

3. Emo the Musical <http://miff.com.au/program/film/emo-the-musical>

In 2013 the writer/director Neil Triffett and the producer Lee Matthews 
cobbled together $10,000 to makea short high school-set musical film 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twnAfEse0II> about bible bashers picked on by 
prank-pulling emos. Triffett memorably took the mickey out of two groups of 
people while making a serious point about bullying and tolerance. His reward 
was funding for a feature film expansion, with a budget pegged at $1.5m.

4. Notes on Blindness <http://miff.com.au/program/film/notes-on-blindness>

When the theologian John Hull started losing his eyesight in the early 1980s, 
he began recording a series of deeply personal cassette tapes that form the 
foundation of a remarkable documentary from co-directors James Spinney and 
Peter Middleton. The film-makers recruited actors to provide the voices of Hull 
and his wife. This technique creates an oddly compelling blend – it’s not quite 
re-enactment, given the presence of straight-from-the-horse’s-mouth audio, and 
not quite documentary, given the presence of actors. A highly original and 
utterly sublime work, Notes on Blindness is a soul-stirring portrait of a man 
who viewed disability as an opportunity to become a better and more complete 
person.

5. Paris 05:59 <http://miff.com.au/program/film/paris-0559>

The French directors Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau helm a touching 
Paris-set romantic drama about love at first sight. But before you say “sounds 
like a Hallmark greeting card”, bear this rather racy caveat in mind: 05:59 
begins with an explicit 18-minute gay orgy sequence. Thus it is assured instant 
water-cooler classic status.

6. Innocence <http://miff.com.au/program/film/innocence>

The prolific Australian auteur Paul Cox passed away last month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/filmblog/2016/jun/20/every-australian-film-maker-owes-something-to-director-paul-cox>
. In his honour, the Melbourne international film festival is screening Cox’s 
2000 drama Innocence, with a panel discussion afterwards featuring two of its 
stars: national treasures Julia Blake and Terry Norris, who play a married 
couple in the film and are married in real life. Innocence begins with a Before 
Sunset-esque premise – two lovers meet up years down the track – and morphs 
into a story of late-age infidelity.

7. A New Leaf <http://miff.com.au/program/film/a-new-leaf>

The ultra deadpan screwball genius of the writer/director Elaine May’s 1971 
debut, starring herself and Walter Matthau, has been criminally overlooked over 
the years. Matthau plays a broke middle-aged playboy with a plan to marry and 
murder a wealthy heiress in a deliciously dark and dry but, sadly, 
studio-tampered with classic (the original version was rumoured to be three 
hours long). The film is playing in the Gaining Ground program of the Melbourne 
international film festival, which spotlights the art of female directors 
working in New York in the 70s and 80s.

8. The Family <http://miff.com.au/program/film/the-family>, and Joe Cinque’s 
Consolation <http://miff.com.au/program/film/joe-cinques-consolation>

I’m grouping these two titles together given they share an unusual 
commonality: both are Australian crime films exploring subjects injected with 
drugs and the people who wielded the needles. In 1997 a law student, Anu Singh, 
killed her boyfriend, Joe Cinque, by spiking his coffee with Rohypnol then 
injecting him with a massive dose of heroin; the author Helen Garner 
immortalised the story in her true-crime book Joe Cinque’s Consolation. Singh
has already spoken out against 
<http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/anu-singh-breaks-silence-ahead-of-release-of-film-joe-cinques-consolation-20160125-gmdk9e.html>
 first-time feature film-maker Sotiris Dounoukos’s incoming adaptation. The 
Family, directed by Rosie Jones, documents Australia’s most notorious cult. It 
was created by the yoga teacher Anne Hamilton-Byrne, regarded by her followers 
as a reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Hamilton-Byrne’s sect was raided in 1987 
after a Victorian detective discovered 13-year-olds were being injected with 
LSD.

9. Weiner <http://miff.com.au/program/film/weiner>

Is there a better political campaign movie  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/04/weiner-the-political-doc-whose-subject-really-is-a-plonker>
than Weiner? Is anything else even on the podium? Co-directors Josh Kriegman 
and Elyse Steinberg came on board to document the 2013 mayoral race of 
disgraced New York congressmanAnthony Weiner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/anthony-weiner>, determined to recover his 
career after a sexting scandal. What they got was a slow-moving train crash; 
what they made is a jaw-dropping stranger-than-fiction yarn with access so 
extensive you’ll wonder how they were allowed to keep filming.

10. Personal Shopper <http://miff.com.au/program/film/personal-shopper>

The stars of Twilight seem to advocate the theory that actors ought to sell 
out early rather than later, then bask in the glow of a career renaissance 
(otherwise known as “the Matthew McConaughey”).Kristen Stewart continues to 
turn heads in Personal Shopper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/personal-shopper-review-kristen-stewarts-psychic-spooker-is-a-must-have>
, a ghost movie from the French director Olivier Assayas. Meanwhile, Robert 
Pattinson stands his ground in the highbrow – and at times infuriatingly 
pretentious – drama The Childhood of a Leader.
