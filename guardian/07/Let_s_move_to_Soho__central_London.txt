What’s going for it? If you know it only for its history of bohemian boozing 
and strip clubs, or its present of luxury investment flats andCrossrail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/crossrail> building sites, you won’t know that 
Soho can be a rather nice place to live. Especially for the elderly and 
children: old people can have a great time hanging out, and everyone looks out 
for local kids. Someone who recently moved to a shoebox Soho flat from a family 
house in Shepherd’s Bush says she and her daughter have found far more sense of 
community than they did in the ’burbs. If you rent (and how could you ever 
afford to buy?), the prices can be relatively affordable. OK, we saidrelatively
. Please don’t shout.

The case against Drunks urinating on your doorstep at night. Rampant 
gentrification means your favourite greasy spoon won’t be there in the morning. 
If you have a family, your child will never learn to climb a tree.

Well connected? It is the connection. Soho is the very centre of London, with 
Charing Cross, Euston and King’s Cross stations all within walking distance. A
£1bn redevelopment of Tottenham Court Road tube station 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/23/crossrail-london-east-west-tunnel-railway>
 means Crossrail will get to Heathrow in 28 minutes from 2019. Good luck 
parking a car in Soho, though.

Westminster,Grey Coat Hospital <http://www.gch.org.uk/> for girls is 
“outstanding”;Westminster City School <http://www.wcsch.com/> for boys is
