In Malawi, Juliana Lunguzi, an opposition MP for Dedza East, a district next 
to Lilongwe, and chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on health, shares 
her thoughts onfamily planning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive>
 and education in a time of drought with Global development editor Lucy Lamble:

Without education, that’s it for you. You are just recycling poverty at 
household level, as simple as that. We are recycling our poverty because if 
someone drops out of school, what do you do with a 10-year-old at home? 
Eventually they will get married so these are the early marriages that we don’t 
want, and you are looking at all the maternal complications that we don’t want 
– fistula or even obstructed labour to these girls. And these have long-term 
psychological effects.

Clár Ní Chonghaile

Britain’s development secretary <https://www.facebook.com/ukdfid/>, Justine 
Greening, is expected to tell today’s #genderday event at the ODI that 
inequality between men and women is “the great unmet human challenge” this 
century.

In the closing remarks, she is expected to say that addressing this inequality 
requires the same kind of “global revolution and commitment” as seen around 
climate change.

Greening will say there have been big victories, but the pace of change has 
not been good enough.

”Internationally we need the next UN secretary general to really pick up the 
baton on gender equality – perhaps for the next UN secretary general to be a 
woman for the first time.” (Ban Ki-moon is stepping down this year, and 
Greening is not alone in suggesting it might be time for the global body to 
pick a woman to lead it.Even Ban himself seems to agree  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/ban-ki-moon-woman-un-secretary-general>
– and he should know 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/ban-ki-moon-woman-un-secretary-general>
).

“We need women to be equally represented in parliaments around the world,” 
Greening is expected to say. “In Somalia, where only 14% of MPs are women, in 
Sierra Leone where just over 12% are women, but also Japan where only 9% are 
women, and Britain where it’s still only 30% despite all the progress we’ve 
made. We still need around 130 more women MPs here to be equal. Let’s find the 
130 more. My message to women in Britain is: if you’re a great, capable woman 
then run, run for parliament or for local government, or to be a police 
commissioner, and if you know a great, capable woman – then ask her to run.”

And, like most of the speakers today at the ODI, Greening will hint at her 
personal frustration.

“We can’t afford to leave half our population behind here in Britain. We can’t 
afford to leave any country’s population behind. This has been going on for too 
long – I don’t accept it.”

A poll commissioned by the Center for Health and Gender Equity 
<http://www.genderhealth.org/> (Change), has found that seven out of 10 US 
voters support access to abortion for women who survive rape. Released to mark 
IWD, the poll also showed that the majority of voters support the use of US aid 
to provide comprehensive post-rape care – including safe abortions – for women 
and girls raped in conflict.

Change has been lobbying hard to get President Obama to clarify and repeal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/15/barack-obama-us-abortion-aid-helms-amendment>
 the Helms amendment. Helms is a provision from the 1970s that prohibits US 
overseas aid from paying for abortions as a “method of family planning” but 
does not prevent aid supporting access to abortion in the cases of rape, incest 
or life endangerment.

“This poll makes it clear that President Obama has the support of the American 
people in standing with women raped in conflict and breaking barriers to 
abortion access in post-rape care,” said Change president Serra Sippel. 
“Moreover, this poll shows support not in just one corner of the nation, but in 
every region.”

What does equality mean to you? Robina Biteyi, of White Ribbon Alliance 
Uganda, says:

On International Women’s Day, equality means we are all as valuable as each 
other. In the words of Keishamaza Rukikaire-Kagwa ‘equality means no glass 
ceiling, and we’re all standing on an even floor’.

What does equality mean to you? Katja Iversen, CEO of Women Deliver 
<http://www.womendeliver.org/about/>, which will be bringing together 100s of 
campaigners, advocates, politicians and celebrities for a conference in 
Copenhagen in May, says:

Gender <https://www.theguardian.com/world/gender> equality means that 
everybody wins. It means investing in the health, rights and wellbeing of girls 
and women, so they can live their full potential. It means leveling the playing 
field so we together can build a better world.

Clár Ní Chonghaile

At the ODI’s #genderday event, discussions have turned to the imperfect and 
yet potentially important replacements for the millennium development goals – 
those trip-off-the-tongue sustainable development goals – and how they can help 
push the equality agenda.

Jessica Woodroffe, director of the Gender and Development Network 
<http://gadnetwork.org/>, says the SDGs fell short of the ideal, but that was 
no surprise given the tortuous negotiations that preceded their ratification. 
Here’s our women’s rights editor Liz Ford on justhow tricky those talks were 
ahead of the UN summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/04/first-draft-sustainable-development-goals-exposes-gaps-warn-ngos>
 last September, just in case you’ve forgotten. And for a visual reminder of 
all the goals, here’s ourinteractive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive>
.

Woodroffe took a glass half-full approach: “The SDGs need to be a tool, not a 
boundary but they are better than we feared.Gender 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gender> equality is a goal in its own right 
… the principal of keeping a standalone goal was really important.”

In a way, the ball is now back in the activists’ court, or as Woodroffe put 
it: “Will we let [the SDGs] define our work or will we define their 
implementation?”

Key areas for action, she said, included redefining basic social norms that 
see men as primarily breadwinners and women as primarily carers, and addressing
unpaid care work 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/14/un-human-development-index-report-2015-employment-selim-jahan>
 to make sure girls and women are not being deprived of other opportunities. 
She also said women’s economic empowerment was not tackled in a cohesive manner 
in the SDGs.

Nearly six months on from the razzmatazz of the launch in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/25/global-goals-summit-2015-new-york-un-pope-shakira-malala-yousafzai>
, the message is clear: the SDGs do not mark an end but a beginning: time now 
for the hard work needed to flesh out this limited global framework for 
development.

What does equality mean to you? Holly Bourne 
<http://hollybourneauthor.tumblr.com/>, bestselling young adults author, whose 
latest novel is How Hard Can Love Be?, says:

Equality means that you have an equal shot at living a healthy and happy life 
– no matter what body you were born into. Every human on this planet deserves 
to live without fear, without oppression, without feeling silenced and 
invisible. This basic human right is something we need to fight for every 
single day, and keep fighting for, until true equality is achieved for everyone.

Melbourne walks the walk on equality

It’s not just Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/live/2016/mar/08/international-womens-day-2016-iwd-live?page=with:block-56de90dee4b098a94cd4e2c5#block-56de90dee4b098a94cd4e2c5>
 that’s being less than pedestrian on gender equality. They’re changing the 
crossing in Melbourne, too. The AAP reports:


The little green and red men will be replaced by a woman from the 1920s at a 
new pedestrian crossing in Melbourne.

The silhouettes that indicate when it’s safe to cross Bridge Road in Richmond 
will be a likeness of Mary Rogers, the first woman elected to a council in 
Victoria in the 1920s.

The City of Yarra and VicRoads announced the novel signals - which some have 
suggested look like Mary Poppins – ahead of IWD.

Rogers, elected to the City of Richmond council in 1920, was the second female 
councillor in Australia before becoming a justice of the peace and special 
magistrate at the Children’s Court.

Once installed in May, the unique signals will be in place for at least 12 
months, with the City of Yarra “hoping they’ll become permanent”, according to 
a spokeswoman.

What does equality mean to you? Yasmeen Hassan, global executive director of 
Equality Now <http://www.equalitynow.org/>, says:

For me, equality means living in a just world, a prosperous world and a 
peaceful world. Countless commitments have been made by governments to end 
violence and discrimination against women, but they do not always translate to 
action.

This International Women’s Day is yet another great opportunity for all 
governments to take a concrete step in this direction by reviewing their 
legislation and removing all laws that help perpetuate violence - or which 
discriminate - against girls and women.

Commenting on IWD, Neven Mimica, European commissioner for international 
cooperation and development, said:

One thing that stands out for me, most recently during my visits to several 
African countries, is how crucial the role of girls and women is to a country’s 
social and economic development. However, too often I also see how 
disadvantaged they are – and how huge the unused potential of their full 
involvement still is. That’s why gender equality and women’s empowerment are 
placed at the heart of the EU’s international cooperation and development, and 
are my personal priority.

Saudi author and photographer Mona Al-Munajjed wants to counter stereotypes 
about her country with a coffee table book profiling successful women, reports 
AP.


Misperceptions about the kingdom’s women have distorted their image in western 
countries, Munajjed said on the eve of IWD.

“We are facing challenges but we are succeeding,” she said at a book signing.

The book, Saudi Women: A Celebration of Success, features her interviews with 
40 Saudi women from a variety of fields, alongside their photographs.

AlMunajjed said she chose her subjects, in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam, because 
they are “pioneering women”.

Women <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> in Saudi must get 
permission from male family members to travel, work or marry, and are not 
allowed to drive.

New figures show a record number of women now use contraception 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive>
, but globally there are still 225 million women who don’t have access to the 
contraceptives they want. We’d like to know what kind of barriers to family 
planning services exist where you live.Fill out the form and help inform our

In Malawi, Juliana Lunguzi, an opposition MP for Dedza East, a district next 
to Lilongwe, and chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on health, shares 
her thoughts onfamily planning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive>
 and education in a time of drought with Global development editor Lucy Lamble:

Without education, that’s it for you. You are just recycling poverty at 
household level, as simple as that. We are recycling our poverty because if 
someone drops out of school, what do you do with a 10-year-old at home? 
Eventually they will get married so these are the early marriages that we don’t 
want, and you are looking at all the maternal complications that we don’t want 
– fistula or even obstructed labour to these girls. And these have long-term 
psychological effects.

 
Britain’s development secretary <https://www.facebook.com/ukdfid/>, Justine 
Greening, is expected to tell today’s #genderday event at the ODI that 
inequality between men and women is “the great unmet human challenge” this 
century.

In the closing remarks, she is expected to say that addressing this inequality 
requires the same kind of “global revolution and commitment” as seen around 
climate change.

Greening will say there have been big victories, but the pace of change has 
not been good enough.

”Internationally we need the next UN secretary general to really pick up the 
baton on gender equality – perhaps for the next UN secretary general to be a 
woman for the first time.” (Ban Ki-moon is stepping down this year, and 
Greening is not alone in suggesting it might be time for the global body to 
pick a woman to lead it.Even Ban himself seems to agree  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/ban-ki-moon-woman-un-secretary-general>
– and he should know 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/ban-ki-moon-woman-un-secretary-general>
).

“We need women to be equally represented in parliaments around the world,” 
Greening is expected to say. “In Somalia, where only 14% of MPs are women, in 
Sierra Leone where just over 12% are women, but also Japan where only 9% are 
women, and Britain where it’s still only 30% despite all the progress we’ve 
made. We still need around 130 more women MPs here to be equal. Let’s find the 
130 more. My message to women in Britain is: if you’re a great, capable woman 
then run, run for parliament or for local government, or to be a police 
commissioner, and if you know a great, capable woman – then ask her to run.”

And, like most of the speakers today at the ODI, Greening will hint at her 
personal frustration.

“We can’t afford to leave half our population behind here in Britain. We can’t 
afford to leave any country’s population behind. This has been going on for too 
long – I don’t accept it.”
 
A poll commissioned by the Center for Health and Gender Equity 
<http://www.genderhealth.org/> (Change), has found that seven out of 10 US 
voters support access to abortion for women who survive rape. Released to mark 
IWD, the poll also showed that the majority of voters support the use of US aid 
to provide comprehensive post-rape care – including safe abortions – for women 
and girls raped in conflict.

Change has been lobbying hard to get President Obama to clarify and repeal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/15/barack-obama-us-abortion-aid-helms-amendment>
 the Helms amendment. Helms is a provision from the 1970s that prohibits US 
overseas aid from paying for abortions as a “method of family planning” but 
does not prevent aid supporting access to abortion in the cases of rape, incest 
or life endangerment.

“This poll makes it clear that President Obama has the support of the American 
people in standing with women raped in conflict and breaking barriers to 
abortion access in post-rape care,” said Change president Serra Sippel. 
“Moreover, this poll shows support not in just one corner of the nation, but in 
every region.”
 
What does equality mean to you? Robina Biteyi, of White Ribbon Alliance 
Uganda, says:

On International Women’s Day, equality means we are all as valuable as each 
other. In the words of Keishamaza Rukikaire-Kagwa ‘equality means no glass 
ceiling, and we’re all standing on an even floor’.

What does equality mean to you? Katja Iversen, CEO of Women Deliver 
<http://www.womendeliver.org/about/>, which will be bringing together 100s of 
campaigners, advocates, politicians and celebrities for a conference in 
Copenhagen in May, says:

Gender <https://www.theguardian.com/world/gender> equality means that 
everybody wins. It means investing in the health, rights and wellbeing of girls 
and women, so they can live their full potential. It means leveling the playing 
field so we together can build a better world.
 
What does equality mean to you? Professor Laurie Maguire, one of the world’s 
leading Shakespeare academics and author of Where There’s A Will There’s A Way, 
a Shakespearean self-help book, says:

Equality is: when there is no further need for positive discrimination
 
At the ODI’s #genderday event, discussions have turned to the imperfect and 
yet potentially important replacements for the millennium development goals – 
those trip-off-the-tongue sustainable development goals – and how they can help 
push the equality agenda.

Jessica Woodroffe, director of the Gender and Development Network 
<http://gadnetwork.org/>, says the SDGs fell short of the ideal, but that was 
no surprise given the tortuous negotiations that preceded their ratification. 
Here’s our women’s rights editor Liz Ford on justhow tricky those talks were 
ahead of the UN summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/04/first-draft-sustainable-development-goals-exposes-gaps-warn-ngos>
 last September, just in case you’ve forgotten. And for a visual reminder of 
all the goals, here’s ourinteractive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive>
.

Woodroffe took a glass half-full approach: “The SDGs need to be a tool, not a 
boundary but they are better than we feared.Gender 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gender> equality is a goal in its own right 
… the principal of keeping a standalone goal was really important.”

In a way, the ball is now back in the activists’ court, or as Woodroffe put 
it: “Will we let [the SDGs] define our work or will we define their 
implementation?”

Key areas for action, she said, included redefining basic social norms that 
see men as primarily breadwinners and women as primarily carers, and addressing
unpaid care work 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/14/un-human-development-index-report-2015-employment-selim-jahan>
 to make sure girls and women are not being deprived of other opportunities. 
She also said women’s economic empowerment was not tackled in a cohesive manner 
in the SDGs.

Nearly six months on from the razzmatazz of the launch in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/25/global-goals-summit-2015-new-york-un-pope-shakira-malala-yousafzai>
, the message is clear: the SDGs do not mark an end but a beginning: time now 
for the hard work needed to flesh out this limited global framework for 
development.
 
From the environment to genetics and from politics to humanitarian law, here 
are a few of the women who have been involved in vital work to make the world a 
better place.
Women you should know about on International Women’s Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/08/women-you-should-know-about-on-international-womens-day-video>  Holly Bourne 
What does equality mean to you? Holly Bourne 
<http://hollybourneauthor.tumblr.com/>, bestselling young adults author, whose 
latest novel is How Hard Can Love Be?, says:

Equality means that you have an equal shot at living a healthy and happy life 
– no matter what body you were born into. Every human on this planet deserves 
to live without fear, without oppression, without feeling silenced and 
invisible. This basic human right is something we need to fight for every 
single day, and keep fighting for, until true equality is achieved for everyone.
 
It’s not just Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/live/2016/mar/08/international-womens-day-2016-iwd-live?page=with:block-56de90dee4b098a94cd4e2c5#block-56de90dee4b098a94cd4e2c5>
 that’s being less than pedestrian on gender equality. They’re changing the 
crossing in Melbourne, too. The AAP reports:


The little green and red men will be replaced by a woman from the 1920s at a 
new pedestrian crossing in Melbourne.

The silhouettes that indicate when it’s safe to cross Bridge Road in Richmond 
will be a likeness of Mary Rogers, the first woman elected to a council in 
Victoria in the 1920s.

The City of Yarra and VicRoads announced the novel signals - which some have 
suggested look like Mary Poppins – ahead of IWD.

Rogers, elected to the City of Richmond council in 1920, was the second female 
councillor in Australia before becoming a justice of the peace and special 
magistrate at the Children’s Court.

Once installed in May, the unique signals will be in place for at least 12 
months, with the City of Yarra “hoping they’ll become permanent”, according to 
a spokeswoman.
 
On IWD it’s worth reminding ourselves of the women’s rights activists who have 
been killed recently in the course of their work. Honduran campaignerBerta 
Cáceres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/03/honduras-berta-caceres-murder-enivronment-activist-human-rights>
, winner of the Goldman Environmental Prize for her opposition to one of 
Central America’s biggest hydropower projects, was murdered last week. To mark 
International Day of Women Human Rights Defenders in November, weremembered 
some of women who have been killed over the past year

What does equality mean to you? Yasmeen Hassan, global executive director of 
Equality Now <http://www.equalitynow.org/>, says:

For me, equality means living in a just world, a prosperous world and a 
peaceful world. Countless commitments have been made by governments to end 
violence and discrimination against women, but they do not always translate to 
action.

This International Women’s Day is yet another great opportunity for all 
governments to take a concrete step in this direction by reviewing their 
legislation and removing all laws that help perpetuate violence - or which 
discriminate - against girls and women.




 
Commenting on IWD, Neven Mimica, European commissioner for international 
cooperation and development, said:

One thing that stands out for me, most recently during my visits to several 
African countries, is how crucial the role of girls and women is to a country’s 
social and economic development. However, too often I also see how 
disadvantaged they are – and how huge the unused potential of their full 
involvement still is. That’s why gender equality and women’s empowerment are 
placed at the heart of the EU’s international cooperation and development, and 
are my personal priority.
 
Saudi author and photographer Mona Al-Munajjed wants to counter stereotypes 
about her country with a coffee table book profiling successful women, reports 
AP.


Misperceptions about the kingdom’s women have distorted their image in western 
countries, Munajjed said on the eve of IWD.

“We are facing challenges but we are succeeding,” she said at a book signing.

The book, Saudi Women: A Celebration of Success, features her interviews with 
40 Saudi women from a variety of fields, alongside their photographs.

AlMunajjed said she chose her subjects, in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam, because 
they are “pioneering women”.

Women <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> in Saudi must get 
permission from male family members to travel, work or marry, and are not 
allowed to drive.
