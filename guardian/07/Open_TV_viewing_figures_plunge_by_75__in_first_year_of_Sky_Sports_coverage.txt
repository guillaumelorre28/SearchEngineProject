The peak television audience for the final round of the Open Championship 
suffered a drop of around 75% on last year in the first broadcasting by Sky 
Sports of the oldest major.

The top viewing figure for the epic Royal Troon shootout between Henrik 
Stenson and Phil Mickelson

Last year, when the Open concluded on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/20/zach-johnson-wins-open-in-playoff-with-louis-oosthuizen-and-marc-leishman>
 because of severe weather disruption, that peak figure on the BBC reached 4.7m.
In 2014, as Rory McIlroy won the Open at Royal Liverpool

, the BBC’s peak Sunday figure was even higher at 5.5m.

Notably BBC’s two-hour highlights show on Sunday evening reached a higher peak 
– 1.5m – than Sky’s live coverage. Such statistics will cast inevitable doubt 
on golf’s ability to grow using a non-terrestrial platform.

Sky decided not to offer comment on Sunday’s viewing figures. The satellite 
broadcaster is believed to be citing a reach of 8m over four days of the Open.

The R&A has consistently defended its shift of the Open from terrestrial 
television, linked to what it claims will bring a younger audience towards 
golf. The Sky deal for the Open was originally due to begin in 2017 butthe BBC 
chose to surrender their live coverage one year early

. Golf’s governing body did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment 
on Monday.
