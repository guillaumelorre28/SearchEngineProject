A proposed small hydropower project in west London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> has received a further setback, as 
court judges allowed an appeal by a club owned by Shell against the granting of 
planning permission to the site.

The project <http://www.hamhydro.org/>, at Teddington lock and weirs, would 
deliver enough electricity to power about 600 homes. It is proposed by a local 
cooperative group, run by volunteers, who have raised a potential £700,000 to 
build the plant, which the proponents say would not have any damaging effect on 
fish in the Thames or other local wildlife.

However, a local leisure club owned by oil and gas giant Shell objected to the 
project. The Lensbury club was formerly a staff club for Shell employees, and 
is now run by the company as a leisure facility.

The club appealed against the granting of planning permission in May

 after its proposed judicial review of the project wasrejected by the high court

.

Judges ruled on Wednesday that the club’s appeal can be allowed, despite the 
council having previously granted permission for the plant to go ahead, because 
of flaws in the reasoning behind the planning green light.

The dispute raises questions over the future of small cooperative renewable 
energy projects in the UK,which have already suffered from changes to rules in 
taxation and planning permission

.

The Thames has long been a focus for renewable energy proponents, who argue 
thatsmall hydroelectricity projects along the river 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/25/hydropower-turbine-river-thames>
 could present a valuable form of renewable electricity, without harm to river 
ecosystems.

Shell said that a scheme harnessing hydropower in the local area could still 
go ahead, and the company and club would support such efforts, but it would 
require modification from the original proposal.

A Shell spokesman said: “Both Lensbury and Shell strongly support the 
principle of a hydroelectric power scheme at Teddington Weir, providing any 
such scheme properly addresses environmental and noise issues, flood risk 
during construction and impact on conservation areas.”

The company argued that the proposed scheme did not meet the required 
standards for planning applications of this type. The appeal court judges 
agreed.

“We fully support Lensbury’s desire to work with relevant bodies to agree a 
mutually acceptable way forward for the hydro development,” the Shell spokesman 
said.

It is still possible for the cooperative and Richmond council to take the case 
to the supreme court, but that would involve significant costs. Another 
possible way forward would be to modify the scheme in ways that would satisfy 
the objections raised in the appeal.

Lensbury Ltd, which operates the club, is a subsidiary of Shell Petroleum 
Company Ltd, and its directors are Shell employees, but carry out their duties 
independently from the parent company.
