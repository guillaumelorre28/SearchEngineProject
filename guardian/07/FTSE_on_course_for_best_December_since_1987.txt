An heroic effort in the final few minutes of trading saw the FTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 index bounce back through the 
6000 level today, ending 12.85 points higher at 6008.92.

Barring any upsets in the final few days next week, the FTSE is on course for 
its best December since 1987, when it rose 8.5%.

Not everyone is convinced the gains are built on firm foundations, however. 
"It's one of the thinnest volume rallies, and there's a feeling it's built on 
hot air," Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index, told Reuters.

Reports of the traditional last-minute rush to the shops

 – and hopes for a bumper sale season – brought some welcome cheer to the 
retailers. In the FTSE 100 Next added 2% to £20.47 and Kingfisher was 1.25% 
higher at 266.92p.

Elsewhere in the sector Dixons Retail gained almost 2%, at 23.11p, and Ocado 
rose 1% to 171p.

Supergroup – dubbed "Superdroop" by some following its recent fall from grace 
– clawed back 20p of its recent losses at one stage but drooped again towards 
the close, ending 3p down at 1233p.
