They went to Kigali to eliminate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and take 0.5C out 
of future global warming, and the 170 countries thatsuccessfully negotiated an 
amendment to the Montreal protocol treaty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons>
 agreed to get rid of 90% of them. Not bad for four days and three long nights 
of hard work.

The Kigali deal on HFCs is in fact fiendishly complicated and has taken years 
to negotiate in various technical and political forums. The final agreement, 
announced on Saturday morning caps and reduces the use of HFCs in a gradual 
process beginning in 2019.

More than 100 developing countries will start taking action from 2024, a date 
that has sparked concern from some groups that the changes will be implemented 
too slowly. A small group of countries, including India, Pakistan and some Gulf 
states, pushed for and secured a later start – 2028 – on the grounds that their 
economies need time to grow. But that is three years earlier than India, the 
world’s third-worst polluter, had first proposed.

The result was achieved thanks to several factors: an ambitious scheme to give 
countries different time scales in which to phase out HFCs; major chemical and 
food companies accepting change; the determination of US secretary of stateJohn 
Kerry <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kerry> to agree a plan before 
the presidential election; and developing countries agreeing to invest heavily 
in new technologies.

Rich countries, including the US, Japan and Europe, will start phasing out 
synthetic HFCs in 2019, China in 2024, and India and less ambitious countries 
in 2028. The deal reflects countries’ differing levels of development. Because 
nearly all HFCs are made by a handful of giant western chemical companies and 
are used in air-conditioning units and cooling systems made and sold in rich 
countries, it was relatively easy for their governments to put pressure on a 
single global industry. Alternatives such as hydrocarbons, ammonia and CO2 are 
widely available, safe, approved and on the market.

Worldwide use of HFCs has soared in the past decade as rapidly growing 
countries such as China and India adopted air-conditioning in homes, offices 
and cars. But HFC gases are thousands of times more destructive to the climate 
than carbon dioxide, and scientists say their growing use threatens to 
undermine the Paris accord, agreed last year by 195 countries.

The deal will make little difference to rich countries. The EU had already 
started to phase out HFCs and since 2011 had banned their use in cars. Many 
global food and drink companies – Coca Cola, Pepsico and Unilever among them – 
have already started to replace fluorinated gases with climate-friendly and 
natural refrigerants, which are more energy-efficient and can save money.

The new agreement is welcomed by many chemical and manufacturing companies 
because it gives them green kudos and market advantage over inferior products 
made in poor countries.

But it was much harder for India, China and other developing countries to 
strike a deal. Their companies have relied on old refrigeration and coolant 
technologies, and will now have to invest in R&D and upgrade or replace 
factories and equipment.

Just as in wider climate talks, they accepted that they are part of the 
problem and may be on track to become the main HFC users, but insisted that, 
like climate change itself, this is primarily a western problem foisted on them.

The deal keeps the Paris agreement on track and is a vital step towards 
reducing global emissions. Coming on the heels ofa new deal to cap aviation 
emissions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/aviation-emissions-agreement-united-nations>
, and just weeks before the shipping industry sets about cleaning up its act 
and UN climate talks resume, it is overwhelmingly positive.

But the Kigali meeting need never have happened. HFCs were widely recognised 
as powerful greenhouse gases many years ago, and though governments 
deliberately missed the chance to eliminate them in 1987, they agreed in the 
Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and protect the ozone layer.

The ozone hole is slowly recovering, and HFCs are now seen as just a small 
part of the climate change problem. If only it took just a few nights of 
negotiations to eliminate fossil fuels, too.
