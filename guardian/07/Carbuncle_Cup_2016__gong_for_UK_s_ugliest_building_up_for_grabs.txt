It’s the one award no architect wants to win, the trophy that won’t be taking 
pride of place on the mantelpiece. While buildings are daily showered with 
prizes for the best use of bricks and wood, for finely poured concrete and the 
most elegant windows, the accolade that haunts them all is rearing its ugly 
head once again.

Holding up a dark mirror to the Stirling prize

, theCarbuncle Cup 
<http://www.bdonline.co.uk/-carbuncle-cup-2016-shortlist-unveiled/5083418.article>
 singles out the worst offenders of the year, the abominations that blight our 
skylines and bully our streets, the mean-minded developer tat that clutters 
cities up and down the country. From botched renovations to bloated towers, it 
awards the most heinous “crimes against architecture” – or crimes against the 
public.

Buildings are one of the few things you can’t escape. You don’t have to watch 
a bad play. You’re not forced to go and look at an ugly painting, or sit 
through a terrible piece of music. But architecture is here, there and 
everywhere, from the dingy station entrance you were made to shuffle through 
this morning to the low-ceilinged, deep-plan office you might be sitting in 
while you’re reading this.

In 2015, the hated gong was bestowed on one of the most visible eyesores 
around, a building that stands as both a diagram of greed and the whims of the 
City of London’s planning system. Swelling as it rises, London’sWalkie Talkie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/sep/02/walkie-talkie-london-wins-carbuncle-cup-worst-building-of-year>
 is the ultimate symbol of a city where developers call the shots.

But it’s everyday bodging that can be more damaging, from the prefab 
schools-disguised-as-sheds to the badly planned apartment blocks shooting up on 
urban peripheries and stacked hutches of fast-buck student flats. These 
buildings don’t grab the headlines, but they make all our lives immeasurably 
worse.

Once again, this year’s shortlist is a wretched crop. From psychedelic 
chequerboards to sci-fi hulks, feast your eyes on these magnificent 
monstrosities.

Marketed as “a dominant focal point for the new Croydon skyline”, this 
Berkeley Homes development is certainly hard to miss, standing as one of the 
first of new-look Croydon’s novelty lineup, only to be trumped by the 
forthcomingOdalisk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/29/top-10-worst-london-skyscrapers-quill-odalisk-walkie-talkie>
. Clad with a pixelated bruise of bright purples and reds, it looks as if it 
has already suffered a vicious beating at the hands of disgruntled residents.

Promised a “dynamic new city centre business and leisure destination designed 
for people and the modern occupier”, poor old Stoke ended up with a miserable 
box dressed in a cheap harlequin costume, a 
so-bad-it-might-almost-be-fashionable fusion of 80s classics Blockbusters and 
Connect 4. Or was it inspired by the pattern on thearchitect’s homepage

The diamond-cladding craze continues with this £81m undergraduate engineering 
facility for the University of Sheffield, built to house 20,000 sq m of 
laboratories, lecture theatres and workshops inside its garish latticework 
garb. In one of the most tenuous justifications in the history of planning 
applications, the designers claim the pattern “references the stone tracery of 
an adjacent church”.

Another building allegedly inspired by its ecclesiastical neighbour, the 
extension to Poole’s Methodist church sadly looks more like a pile of site 
Portakabins they forgot to remove. Its designers, the optimistically-named 
IntelligentDesign <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/design> Centre, 
might do well to think about a rebrand.

Rearing above the braying bankers’ den of Broadgate Circle like a silvery 
mothership from Tron, this gargantuan grey shed is the work of Ken “the Pen” 
Shuttleworth, designer of the Gherkin while at Foster’s, whose catalogue of 
carbuncles since leaving Norman’s side suggests the magic pen may well have 
belonged to someone else. A mute groundscraper slashed with gun-emplacement 
windows, you can’t help feeling 5 Broadgate is what the City deserves.

Perhaps the most representative building on the list of the kind of lumpen, 
crazy-paving-clad dross that accounts for much modern residential development, 
Lincoln Plaza is Galliard Homes’ latest gift to the Isle of Dogs, proving that 
it’s not just banks that know how to desecrate the skyline. With jutting 
cantilevers, random voids and a frenzy of bolt-on balconies, it is yet more 
proof that busy isn’t always best.
