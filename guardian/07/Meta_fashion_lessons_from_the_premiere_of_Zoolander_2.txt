The Zoolander 2 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/zoolander-2> premiere at the 
Empire Leicester Square was billed as a Fashionable Screening. Imagine the kind 
of pressure that puts those poor stars under. Looking extra fashionable to 
attend an event you are supposed to be fashionable at to promote a film that 
lampoons being fashionable. Man, the complexities. And the sheer meta-ness of 
the whole thing. So, how did the celebs respond under the staggering weight of 
sartorial expectation? And, crucially, what fashion question arose from the 
blue carpet?

Penelope Cruz was clearly feeling the pressure. That must be the explanation 
as to why one of the most beautiful women in the world – who could wear a 
Derelicte binbag to a premier – chose to go wardrobe route one. A silver glam 
Barbie pattern – albeit byVersace <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/versace> 
– with a side split and diametrically opposed hair parting is a bafflingly 
boring choice. Unless Cruz is making a comment on the unspoken sequinned 
conservatism and codes of the red carpet. Meta.

Who is being lampooned with the giant selfie here? The Oscars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/07/oscars-selfie-most-retweeted-ever>
, backstage models or just really, really good looking people? Plus, look at
Suzy Menkes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/sep/07/suzy-menkes-vogue-london-fashion-week-interview>
 (playing herself) mixing in with the cast. Where does the frow end and the 
fiction begin?

Clearly Kristen Wiig’s bow is a comment on how the fashion industry wraps up 
its dark side in pretty frippery. It seeks to distract and confuse us with its 
silky packaging. Fashion is an evil master.

Owen Wilson is being Owen Wilson <https://www.theguardian.com/film/owenwilson> 
here. He’s left Hansel on the screen. The sombre suit signifies which side of 
the fiction/reality fence he’s chosen for the premiere. The brown suede shoes 
with crepe sole and the monochrome suit is a clear anti-fashionable move. Arch.

What do the leather gloves mean, Will Ferrell? Is it a comment about remaining

can’t just have been cold, can he? Can he?

What is the significance of Lara Stone and Mario Testino’s frozen smiles? Are 
they subconsciously speaking the international airhead language of emoticon? 
Does gritted teeth emoji signify that no one in fashion really likes being in 
fashion? Or are they cold, too?

was performing as Valentino Garavani, the fashion designer. How else to explain 
his life, his designs, his tan, his coterie of pugs, his facial expressions? An 
ongoing performance art piece the likes of which Gilbert and George can only 
dream of.
