It was not reports from the war in Syria or the investigation into the downing 
of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 that outraged Russians at the weekend, but a 
new music video byRobbie Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/robbie-williams>.

Released to accompany the song Party Like a Russian 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdYGQ7B0Vew%20%E2%80%98>, from his new album, 
Heavy Entertainment Show, the video outraged viewers for its crude stereotyping 
of Russian culture, with some tabloids suggesting the singer would never be 
able to perform in Russia again.

In the video, Williams sings about a leader who “alleviates the cash from a 
whole entire nation, takes loose change and builds his own space station,” and 
adds: “Ain’t no refutin’ or disputin’ - I’m a modern Rasputin 
<http://genius.com/Robbie-williams-party-like-a-russian-lyrics#note-10532701>”, 
while women dressed as ballerinas dance around him.

Singing to the tune of Dance of the Knights from Sergey Prokofiev’s ballet 
Romeo and Juliet, some viewers suggested the level of stereotyping displayed in 
the video could be interpreted as borderline racist.

The Russian state TV channel Vesti aired a special segment 
<http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2805124> on the video, explaining that the 
Russian theme was all that could save a singer whose popularity “in recent 
years was becoming a memory rather than a reality”.

 Robbie Williams: Party Like a Russian 
The popular tabloid newspaper Life 
<https://life.ru/t/%D0%B7%D0%B2%D1%83%D0%BA/910689/orghanizatory_prazdnikov_piesnia_o_russkikh_oligharkhakh_ostavit_uiliamsa_biez_zakazov>
 published an “expert panel” claiming that Williams would never again be 
invited to perform in the country because, though abrasive humour and 
self-mockery is fine for Russians, foreigners can’t get away with it.

Roman Popkov, who works for exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, said he 
thought the video was “shit because it imparts the puny, vulgar Russian elite, 
which has nothing to do with aesthetics, beauty or romanticism”.

After speculation that the song was obliquely criticising the Russian 
president,Vladimir Putin <https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin>, 
Williams was quick to tell fans on Twitter the song “is definitely not about Mr 
Putin”, and told the Sun that it is merely underlining the fact that “Russians 
are ridiculously good partiers”.

I love you Dan but this song is definitely not about Mr Putin x

But not everyone has rejected Williams’s portrayal. One Russian pop star who 
gained fame in the 1980s, Yuri Loza,unexpectedly praised 
<http://www.kp.ru/daily/26589.7/3604396/> the song. “He did this with great 
sensitivity. This is an average party not for an oligarch but a mid-level 
official,” he said.


Politician Maria Baronova 
<https://www.facebook.com/maria.baronova/posts/1298755123470479> said the video 
successfully stereotypes a small section of Russian society. “Today’s elites 
are pleased with the depiction,” she said.

At the end of the 80s, Soviet TV producers often used Dance of the Knights to 
accompany political news stories, and many viewers associate the music with the 
dramatic end of the USSR in the lead-up to 1991. Its appearance in a kitsch pop 
video about Russian oligarchs seems to have been the final straw.
