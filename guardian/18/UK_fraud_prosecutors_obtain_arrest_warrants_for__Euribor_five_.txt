The Serious Fraud Office <https://www.theguardian.com/law/serious-fraud-office>
 (SFO) has obtained arrest warrants in its bid to bring four Germans and one 
Frenchman to Britain to face charges of conspiracy to rig Euribor benchmark 
interest rates.


James Waddington, a lawyer for the SFO, told Southwark crown court on Friday 
that the prosecutor had been granted European arrest warrants for former
Deutsche Bank <https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank> employees 
Kai-Uwe Kappauf, Joerg Vogt, Andreas Hauschild, Ardalan Gharagozlou and former 
Société Générale trader Stephane Esper.

The five men declined a requisition request to attend London’s Westminster 
magistrates court on 11 January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/11/euribor-lawyers-want-ex-deutsche-bank-trader-to-put-up-1m-pounds-bail>
, where they would have been charged with conspiracy to defraud, relating to 
alleged manipulation of Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate).

This threw an early obstacle in the way of SFO plans to charge 10 men and one 
woman with a plot to rig the Euribor which, likeLibor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/libor> (the London interbank offered 
rate), is a benchmark for rates on trillions of dollars of financial products 
and loans globally.

Singapore-based Christian Bittar, a former star Deutsche Bank trader, former 
Barclays traders Philippe Moryoussef, Colin Bermingham, Sisse Bohart, Carlo 
Palombo and Achim Kraemer, still employed by Deutsche, have already been 
charged in the world’s first Euribor prosecution.

Lawyers for Kraemer, Palombo and Bittar have previously said their clients 
denied the allegations, while others did not respond to requests for comment.
