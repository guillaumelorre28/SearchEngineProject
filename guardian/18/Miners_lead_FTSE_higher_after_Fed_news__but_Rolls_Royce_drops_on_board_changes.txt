Mining shares are leading the way, as markets celebrate the fact that the US 
Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold.

Despite the fact that the Fed’s comments hinted at a rate rise in December, 
the dollar weakened and made commodities cheaper for holders of other 
currencies.

So BHP Billiton is 40p better at £10.91, Randgold Resources 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/randgoldresources> has risen 290p to 
£79.70 andGlencore has gained 6.65p to 203.75p.

In fact eight of the top ten risers in the FTSE 100 are mining companies. 
Overall the leading index has added 37.10 points to 6871.87, and Connor 
Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

Despite there being enough to suggest a rate hike in November or, even more 
likely, December, the markets were buoyed by the simple fact that the Federal 
Reserve opted for inaction yesterday evening.

 That helped push the Dow Jones near 18300 for the first time in around 10 
days (and, incidentally, the first time this week the index has managed to hold 
onto its growth right until closing time). That good feeling has fed into the 
European open; the FTSE is once again lagging its peers, but has still managed 
a 20-25 point leap, while the Eurozone indices have climbed around 1% apiece.

 On a quiet day for ex-dividends, Old Mutual is the only leading company to be 
quoted without its shareholder payout. Even then its shares are up 1.2p at 199p 
as financial firms join in the Fed-inspired gains.

But banking shares have fallen back, on concerns that continuing low interest 
rates will pressure their balance sheets.HSBC is down 14.4p at 574.3p and 
Lloyds Banking Group is 0.79p lower at 56.31p.

Rolls-Royce has named Stephen Daintith from Daily Mail and General Trust as 
its new chief financial officer, as chief executive Warren East shakes up the 
board of the troubled aero engine maker. But its shares have dropped 8.5p to 
717.5p. Liberum said:

Stephen Daintith, currently CFO of Daily Mail & General Trust, will succeed 
David Smith in 2017. Smith is leaving to pursue other business interests and 
will remain in post into the New Year (the next update is expected in November).

Daintith is well regarded according to our Media team. He is taking on a big 
challenge. He will have to deal with IFRS15 (which is likely to materially 
impact earnings), extensive restructuring and weak near-term cashflow.
