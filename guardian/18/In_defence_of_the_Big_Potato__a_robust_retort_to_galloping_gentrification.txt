A few years ago, my dad caught a smalltown whisper: plans were afoot to pave 
paradise and put up a parking lot.


The “paradise” was the Big Potato, generally regarded as one of the least 
spectacular of Australia’s “Big Things” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/datablog/ng-interactive/2016/dec/23/australias-big-things-just-how-big-are-they>
. The parking lot was a parking lot – earmarked for a new supermarket to be 
built in Robertson, the town of 1,942 souls he had serviced in his Friendly 
Grocer right next door for the past 27 years.


At the age of 62, my dad took out a mortgage on half an acre of land, not only 
to save his business but to save a Robertson icon. And, as a result, if I play 
my cards right, I am the Big Potato heiress.

Australia's Big Things: just how big are they?

Robertson is a sleepy New South Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> town on the top of 
the escarpment that overlooks Wollongong. It is two hours’ drive from Sydney 
and half an hour from the closest big supermarket or high school, which is a 
polite way of saying it’s in the middle of nowhere.

Even in the middle of December, the town is thick with mist. It is greener 
than Ireland and, for many years, its rich red soil produced famous potatoes 
and cheese. The cheese factory has been split up into various shops and cafes, 
and the potato fields have been made into luscious weekenders for moguls to 
show off in the district’s glossy property and society mag, Highlife.

Yet towards the end of the main street, without much fanfare, stands a beacon 
of Robertson history and folklore that no gentrification can take away: the Big 
Potato. As big as the most luxurious road train, the cement tribute to the 
potato-growing history of the town sits proudly in a green park surrounded by 
trees and picnic benches.

 It’s fair to say its reputation is modest. The blogger Jacqui Kennedy told 
Guardian Australia for last week’sexploration of Big Things 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/datablog/ng-interactive/2016/dec/23/australias-big-things-just-how-big-are-they>
: “A lot of the Big Things – the Big Banana, the Big Pineapple, things like 
that – they’ve got souvenir shops and things around them. The big turd is just 
a big turd in the middle of a field. That’s it. There’s nothing to buy around 
it, nothing else to attract you to it.”

Raised from cement mixed with local soil in 1977, the Big Potato was the 
vision of a local farmer, businessman and councillor, Jim Mauger. Always 
looking for ways to get people to his beloved Robertson (he alsoconvinced 
Kennedy Miller to shoot Babe there 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/17/babe-rewatched-the-smash-hit-story-of-the-little-pig-that-could-20-years-on>
), Mauger says the idea did not require much original thought.

“It was when everything big was going on. The Big Banana, the Big Pineapple, 
the Big Prawn. It was a good idea at the time.”

Originally he planned for the potato to house a potato museum or a takeaway 
store but this never eventuated.

“The vandals drive you crazy. Originally, the doors weren’t locked so they’d 
get in there and write bloomin’ obscenities and go to the toilet in the place.”

Um, guilty. If you’re a person who grew up in Robertson, you will have either 
gone to the toilet once or twice inside it, or at the very least laughed until 
your stomach hurt as one of your friends did.

The potato sat alone in a bare field, a public toilet without plumbing and a 
national laughing stock until 2008, theInternational Year of the Potato 
<http://www.fao.org/potato-2008/en/>, when a community group led by Judy and 
Allan Hollis decided to spruce it up.

“I just got sick of the look of it,” Judy Hollis says from her home in nearby 
Wildes Meadow. “It was disgusting.”

Judy and Allan began by cleaning it back to its original soil brown 
<http://peonyden.blogspot.com.au/2008/06/big-potato-getting-make-over.html>. 
They went on to raise funds for picnic benches, while local nurseries donated 
trees and locals volunteered their labour. They even had a local celebrity or 
two drop in for planting.

Judy recalls: “Artist Ben Quilty came to the park one day and said, ‘What are 
you doing?’ ‘Planting daffodils,’ I told him. ‘What are you doing?’ He said he 
was meant to be painting but would rather be planting daffodils, so that’s what 
he did.”

The potato now sits proudly in the peaceful park created by Judy, Allan and 
their team – a park where a farmers’ market or a tai chi lesson would not seem 
out of place.

But many Robertson residents still have complex feelings about the potato.

Local Christopher Welsh is almost philosophical: “True, perhaps, that the Big 
Potato may not have the status of a prawn or a merino but neither does a potato 
have the same complexity and finesse of some other natural phenomena. But do 
not undersell the surrounding ambience. Sometimes one just has to linger and 
let the richness of the place overwhelm superficial judgments.”

Former Robertsonian Anthea Murray, who now lives in Hong Kong, says: “I do 
love it though, even though it’s like a giant turd by Hoddle Street. It’s ours 
and it’s fab.”

Nurse Jill Keft says the Big Potato is “quirky, individual, humorous, a nice 
public space now that it is landscaped”.

I tried to get my dad to comment for this article but he declined. Someone 
told him it’s now called “Tait’s Turd” in town and he’s feeling a little 
sensitive.
