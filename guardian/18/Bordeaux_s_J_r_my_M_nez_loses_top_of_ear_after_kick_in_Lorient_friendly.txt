The Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux> striker Jérémy 
Ménez has undergone surgery after losing part of the top of his right ear in 
his first match for the club.

The former France forward, who joined this summer from Milan, was helped off 
the pitch in the 77th minute of the pre-season friendly againstLorient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> on Wednesday.

After a clash in the air, the Lorient midfielder Didier Ndong’s left foot 
accidentally made contact with Ménez’s ear while he was on the ground.

Ndong apologised for the injury, saying it was “absolutely unintentional”. 
“I’m giving [Ménez] my full support over the next few days and hopefully I will 
see him back soon,” he said in a statement posted on Lorient’s website.

Bordeaux, who won 3-1, said no date had been set for the 29-year-old Ménéz’s 
return. The club’s first league game is on 13 August against St Étienne.

Ménéz last played for France in 2013 and has 24 caps. He signed a three-year 
deal with Bordeaux after two seasons in Serie A, having scored 18 goals in 43 
league matches for Milan.
