Japanese firms’ appetite for British takeovers looks set to continue into 
2017, as Sumitomo Rubber Industries agreed a £215m deal to buy Micheldever Tyre 
Services (MTS), the UK’s second largest car tyre distributor.

Micheldever, based in the picturesque Hampshire village of the same name, is 
owned by private equity group Graphite Capital, which has previously sold 
Maplin Electronics and Paperchase.

If Graphite’s latest sale goes through, it will mean the top two British tyre 
distributors are now in Japanese hands, afterKwik-Fit was sold to trading house 
Itochu

 for £637m in 2011. It will also provide further evidence of a growing appetite 
among Japanese investors for UK assets.

Japanese firms spent $32.9bn (£27.2bn)on 42 British firms last year, according 
to figures from financial markets analysis firm Dealogic. The lion’s share of 
last year’s spending was accounted for bySoftBank’s £24bn acquisition of 
smartphone chip maker ARM Holdings

, unveiled in July.

But Japanese firms struck a series of less high-profile deals during 2016, 
both before and after the slump in the value of sterling triggered by theUK’s 
vote to leave the European Union

Sumitomo appears twice in the top five, after agreeing to spend $138m to buy 
theDunlop sporting goods brand from Sports Direct

, although that deal has yet to complete.

Earlier in the year, Japanese instant noodle firm Nissin built a stake of more 
than 19% in Premier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling cakes and Oxo cubes.

A distribution deal between the two firms was among the factors that 
complicated a takeover bid for Premier Foods

 from US firm McCormick, the company behind Schwartz dried spices.

McCormick eventually walked away from the deal after Premier Foods held out 
for a higher offer.

Graphite Capital is understood to have been seeking a buyer for some time 
before Sumitomo expressed its interest.

The two sides have now struck a £215m deal, 3.7 times Graphite’s initial 
investment in 2006, with Sumitomo expected to continue the firm’s expansion, 
subject to the transaction winning regulatory approval from the European Union.

MTS has grown under Graphite’s ownership, increasing turnover from £150m to 
more than £320m and expanding its workforce from 600 people to 1,600.

MTS chief executive Duncan Wilkes said the deal would ensure the same 
management would continue to run the firm, which supplies about 6m tyres a year.

Takeda Pharmaceuticals had acquired Crescendo Biologics for $790m. In fact the 
two companies signed a collaboration and license agreement worth up to $790m to 
develop and commercialise Crescendo’s cancer technology.
