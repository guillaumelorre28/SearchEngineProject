 * The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, told the 11 justices sitting at the 
supreme court that the EU referendum had been conducted “with the universal 
expectation that the government would implement the result”,at the outset of 
the crucial constitutional case. 
 * Amid the febrile atmosphere surrounding the case, Wright also said it was 
“perfectly proper” for the claimants to have brought the case and that the 
supreme court should now take the decision. 
 * The government’s opening arguments centred on the use of the royal 
prerogative by the government, which Wright said was not an “ancient relic” but 
was essential to “maintain control”. He said that parliament is sovereign but 
it had chosen to limit the government’s prerogative powers “sparingly, 
conscious of the need for executive powers”. 
 * James Eadie QC, who developed the government’s arguments said that the 
power to make war and peace have long been part of the government’s executive 
powers. He added: “It’s no small thing to alter the constitutional balance by 
limiting long-standing powers.” 
 * In his opening remarks, the president of the supreme court said none of the 
parties involved in the case asked any of the 11 justices to stand down ahead 
of the hearing.Lord Neuberger’s comments follow critical coverage from 
pro-Brexit newspapers with respect to some of the justices. 
 * Neuberger also also reminded the media that the names of some of the former 
claimants and their families should not be identified because of “threats of 
serious violence and unpleasant abuse” made to them online and in emails. 
“Threatening and abusing people because they are exercising their fundamental 
right to go to court undermines the rule of law,” he said. 
 * Eadie argued the European Communities Act 1972 made no provision regarding 
any decision to subsequently withdraw from the European treaties.

 * Later, Eadie turned to the 2015 legislation that authorised the EU 
referendum, acknowledging it did not explicitly explain how the result should 
be put into effect.But, he said, that did not mean that the act was, as the 
high court ruled, “legally irrelevant”. It implied that the royal prerogative 
should be used to implement withdrawal. 
The court will resume again tomorrow morning. Thanks for reading.

The 2015 act was passed with Parliament acknowledging the political realities 
with the scale of the decision to stay or leave,. Eadie says. In doing so 
Parliament was acknowledging the vote should decide that question and all 
concerned, including parliament, would respect outcome, he argues.

In case anyone watching thinks court is being particularly hard on Eadie, a 
reminder:
Law and policy (@Law_and_policy) 
Remember: court is giving the government a hard time because it is first to 
speak. They will give Pannick and the others a hard time too.

Turning to the 2015 legislation that authorised the EU referendum, Eadie 
acknowledged it did not explicitly explain how the result should be put into 
effect.

But, he said, that did not mean that the act was, as the high court ruled, 
“legally irrelevant”. It implied that the royal prerogative should be used to 
implement withdrawal, Eadie said.

“Was parliament in 2015 really in setting up the referendum doing nothing more 
than simply reserving to itself the right to leave the EU?” he asked. “Not 
merely is it highly improbable, but that would run counter to the repeated 
statements of ministers and the government.”

Eadie is now turning to the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> Referendum 2015 act. It makes no 
reference to the legal consequences after the referendum. However, that absence 
does not mean that the 2015 act is legally irrelevant, he says.

Supreme Court puts it to Eadie that he accepts ECA has constitutional status 
but this does not undermine his argument - as they put it, “so what?”.
Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) 
SC: you accept Common law has a doctrine of constitutional status; you accept 
ECA has that status. But you say so what? Eadie: yes.

Hi, Jamie Grierson here, taking over from Haroon Siddique, who will no doubt 
dream tonight of the transposition of international legislation into domestic 
law.

The European Union (amendment) 2008 Act 
<http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/7/pdfs/ukpga_20080007_en.pdf>, which 
incorporated the Lisbon Treaty, had to consider article 50, says Eadie. It was 
one of the principal changes introduced by Lisbon, says Eadie.
Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) 
Eadie: this piece of legislation also had to consider Article 50. And he says 
we know Parliament did - and he refers to these extracts.

It could have restricted the exercise of prerogative powers by the government 
but did not, he argues. The article in question was explicitly mentioned, says 
the attorney general, but he suggests the intention was “to leave article 50 
well alone”.

Since you’re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the 
Guardian than ever – but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues 
are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The 
Guardian’s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But 
we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices 
matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future 
would be much more secure. Support us witha monthly payment

Joshua Rozenberg (@JoshuaRozenberg) 
Several of the justices are making the point that there’s a difference between 
amending the EU treaties and withdrawal. Eadie disagrees.
 <https://twitter.com/JoshuaRozenberg/status/805790996781010944> December 5, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/JoshuaRozenberg/status/805790996781010944> 
Eadie says it is a question of if there is a distinction between complete 
withdrawal of these rights and destroying some of these rights. He claims we 
know that the government can do the latter.


The words “time to time” in the ECA 1972 (see below), he contends, support the 
government’s argument by referring to the fact that the exercise of the 
government’s prerogative powers in Brussels may involve changing people’s 
rights.
Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) 
Eadie: We come to section 2 ECA which (1) creates the conduit.

 <https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/805787909001478144> 
The essence of the rights created by the ECA is they are dependent upon action 
occurring on the international plain so the withdrawal from the EU is not 
overriding or revoking rights in the ECA, says Eadie.

The attorney general says that as article 50 did not exist in 1972 there could 
not have been an intention to abrogate the power to trigger article 50.

The act imposes no restriction on action or treaty-making or anything else to 
do with treaties on the international plain on the government, continues Eadie.

We could until 1978 adopted new treaties without parliament, even if that 
might have had political ramifications, he says.
Joshua Rozenberg (@JoshuaRozenberg) 
Eadie is continuing to argue that section 2 of the European Communities Act 
1972 is merely a “conduit“ for treaty obligations.

Good question from Lord Wilson:

You’ve shown convincingly that our accession to the EEC (the forerunner to the 
EU) in 1972 was a joint effort by parliament and prerogative, can you show that 
pulling out will not require a similar joint effort?

Eadie unsurprisingly demurs. He says you need a joint effort to go in to 
transfer powers to the UK but not to get out. The justices do not seem 
convinced.

Eadie moves on to the European Communities Act 1972 which he said made no 
provision regarding any decision to subsequently withdraw from the European 
treaties.

The attorney general says there is nothing in the wording to support that it 
places a restriction on the government’s treaty prerogative.

Under the ECA Act 1972, parliament was merely facilitating membership should 
the government with its prerogative take the country into the EEC, argues the 
attorney general.

Eadie says that because the long title of the act does not say “for and in 
connection with”, unlike other acts, it does not limit executive powers, 
transferring them effectively to parliament.
Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) 
Eadie says that because other Acts "make provision *for and* in connection 
with" that makes a difference. SC seems underwhelmed.

Eadie is talking about the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Crag)
 <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/contents>, which relates to 
parliamentary control over treaties (and is apparently the only act which does 
so on a general level).

Eadie says that Crag is significant because parliament has decided what 
intervention in the prerogative sphere it wants to make with regard to treaties.

The intervention is “express and nuanced”, says Eadie. It applies to 
ratification of treaties, it leaves untouched making of treaties.

It requires no requirement by parliament in withdrawal or commencing the 
process of withdrawal, even though it might have impact on the domestic and 
international plains, says Eadie.

It therefore represents a “considered decision” to leave withdrawal to 
government, the attorney general says.

However, he is challenged by the justices for evidence that this was a 
“considered decision” to leave withdrawal to government. Was there a white 
paper, for example, he is asked?

Eadie said he will respond tomorrow to these queries.
Joshua Rozenberg (@JoshuaRozenberg) 
Lord Carnwath points out that CRAG doesn’t deal with the question of 
withdrawal from a treaty.

 * The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, told the 11 justices sitting at the 
supreme court that the EU referendum had been conducted “with the universal 
expectation that the government would implement the result”,at the outset of 
the crucial constitutional case. 
 * Amid the febrile atmosphere surrounding the case, Wright also said it was 
“perfectly proper” for the claimants to have brought the case and that the 
supreme court should now take the decision. 
 * The government’s opening arguments centred on the use of the royal 
prerogative by the government, which Wright said was not an “ancient relic” but 
was essential to “maintain control”. He said that parliament is sovereign but 
it had chosen to limit the government’s prerogative powers “sparingly, 
conscious of the need for executive powers”. 
 * James Eadie QC, who developed the government’s arguments said that the 
power to make war and peace have long been part of the government’s executive 
powers. He added: “It’s no small thing to alter the constitutional balance by 
limiting long-standing powers.” 
 * In his opening remarks, the president of the supreme court said none of the 
parties involved in the case asked any of the 11 justices to stand down ahead 
of the hearing.Lord Neuberger’s comments follow critical coverage from 
pro-Brexit newspapers with respect to some of the justices. 
 * Neuberger also also reminded the media that the names of some of the former 
claimants and their families should not be identified because of “threats of 
serious violence and unpleasant abuse” made to them online and in emails. 
“Threatening and abusing people because they are exercising their fundamental 
right to go to court undermines the rule of law,” he said. 
 * Eadie argued the European Communities Act 1972 made no provision regarding 
any decision to subsequently withdraw from the European treaties.

 * Later, Eadie turned to the 2015 legislation that authorised the EU 
referendum, acknowledging it did not explicitly explain how the result should 
be put into effect.But, he said, that did not mean that the act was, as the 
high court ruled, “legally irrelevant”. It implied that the royal prerogative 
should be used to implement withdrawal. 
The court will resume again tomorrow morning. Thanks for reading. 
 
That’s it for the day. I’ll post a summary shortly.
 
The 2015 act was passed with Parliament acknowledging the political realities 
with the scale of the decision to stay or leave,. Eadie says. In doing so 
Parliament was acknowledging the vote should decide that question and all 
concerned, including parliament, would respect outcome, he argues.
 
In case anyone watching thinks court is being particularly hard on Eadie, a 
reminder:
Law and policy (@Law_and_policy) 
Remember: court is giving the government a hard time because it is first to 
speak. They will give Pannick and the others a hard time too.

Turning to the 2015 legislation that authorised the EU referendum, Eadie 
acknowledged it did not explicitly explain how the result should be put into 
effect.

But, he said, that did not mean that the act was, as the high court ruled, 
“legally irrelevant”. It implied that the royal prerogative should be used to 
implement withdrawal, Eadie said.

“Was parliament in 2015 really in setting up the referendum doing nothing more 
than simply reserving to itself the right to leave the EU?” he asked. “Not 
merely is it highly improbable, but that would run counter to the repeated 
statements of ministers and the government.”
 
Eadie is now turning to the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> Referendum 2015 act. It makes no 
reference to the legal consequences after the referendum. However, that absence 
does not mean that the 2015 act is legally irrelevant, he says.
 
Supreme Court puts it to Eadie that he accepts ECA has constitutional status 
but this does not undermine his argument - as they put it, “so what?”.
Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) 
SC: you accept Common law has a doctrine of constitutional status; you accept 
ECA has that status. But you say so what? Eadie: yes.

Hi, Jamie Grierson here, taking over from Haroon Siddique, who will no doubt 
dream tonight of the transposition of international legislation into domestic 
law.
 
The European Union (amendment) 2008 Act 
<http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/7/pdfs/ukpga_20080007_en.pdf>, which 
incorporated the Lisbon Treaty, had to consider article 50, says Eadie. It was 
one of the principal changes introduced by Lisbon, says Eadie.
Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) 
Eadie: this piece of legislation also had to consider Article 50. And he says 
we know Parliament did - and he refers to these extracts.

It could have restricted the exercise of prerogative powers by the government 
but did not, he argues. The article in question was explicitly mentioned, says 
the attorney general, but he suggests the intention was “to leave article 50 
well alone”.

Several of the justices are making the point that there’s a difference between 
amending the EU treaties and withdrawal. Eadie disagrees.

Eadie says it is a question of if there is a distinction between complete 
withdrawal of these rights and destroying some of these rights. He claims we 
know that the government can do the latter.


The words “time to time” in the ECA 1972 (see below), he contends, support the 
government’s argument by referring to the fact that the exercise of the 
government’s prerogative powers in Brussels may involve changing people’s 
rights.

The essence of the rights created by the ECA is they are dependent upon action 
occurring on the international plain so the withdrawal from the EU is not 
overriding or revoking rights in the ECA, says Eadie.

Lord Mance says there's a "huge difference" between changes to the rules of 
the club and deciding not to be a member of the club.

The attorney general says that as article 50 did not exist in 1972 there could 
not have been an intention to abrogate the power to trigger article 50.

The act imposes no restriction on action or treaty-making or anything else to 
do with treaties on the international plain on the government, continues Eadie.

We could until 1978 adopted new treaties without parliament, even if that 
might have had political ramifications, he says.
Joshua Rozenberg (@JoshuaRozenberg) 
Eadie is continuing to argue that section 2 of the European Communities Act 
1972 is merely a “conduit“ for treaty obligations.

Good question from Lord Wilson:

You’ve shown convincingly that our accession to the EEC (the forerunner to the 
EU) in 1972 was a joint effort by parliament and prerogative, can you show that 
pulling out will not require a similar joint effort?

Eadie unsurprisingly demurs. He says you need a joint effort to go in to 
transfer powers to the UK but not to get out. The justices do not seem 
convinced.
 
Eadie moves on to the European Communities Act 1972 which he said made no 
provision regarding any decision to subsequently withdraw from the European 
treaties.

The attorney general says there is nothing in the wording to support that it 
places a restriction on the government’s treaty prerogative.

Under the ECA Act 1972, parliament was merely facilitating membership should 
the government with its prerogative take the country into the EEC, argues the 
attorney general.

Eadie: We say (of the long title) that there is nothing in it that supports 
the weight attached to it by the Divisional Court.pic.twitter.com/bn3cpcjqcb

Eadie says that because the long title of the act does not say “for and in 
connection with”, unlike other acts, it does not limit executive powers, 
transferring them effectively to parliament.
Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) 
Eadie says that because other Acts "make provision *for and* in connection 
with" that makes a difference. SC seems underwhelmed.

 <https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/805780717837893632>  
Eadie is talking about the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Crag)
 <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/contents>, which relates to 
parliamentary control over treaties (and is apparently the only act which does 
so on a general level).

Eadie says that Crag is significant because parliament has decided what 
intervention in the prerogative sphere it wants to make with regard to treaties.

The intervention is “express and nuanced”, says Eadie. It applies to 
ratification of treaties, it leaves untouched making of treaties.

It requires no requirement by parliament in withdrawal or commencing the 
process of withdrawal, even though it might have impact on the domestic and 
international plains, says Eadie.

It therefore represents a “considered decision” to leave withdrawal to 
government, the attorney general says.

However, he is challenged by the justices for evidence that this was a 
“considered decision” to leave withdrawal to government. Was there a white 
paper, for example, he is asked?

Eadie said he will respond tomorrow to these queries.
Joshua Rozenberg (@JoshuaRozenberg) 
Lord Carnwath points out that CRAG doesn’t deal with the question of 
withdrawal from a treaty.
