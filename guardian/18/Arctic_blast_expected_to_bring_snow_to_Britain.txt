Temperatures are expected to plummet to -10C (14F) in parts of Britain this 
week as an icy blast sweeps across the country, bringing snow showers, strong 
winds and frost.

An Arctic maritime air mass from northern Canada will produce a sustained 
period of freezing weather, starting with a cold northerly wind, which will hit 
parts of the UK on Wednesday evening, including northern Scotland and the North 
Sea coast, as well as Northern Ireland, parts of Wales, Devon and Cornwall.

As the cold air moves south over the relatively warm sea, it will result in 
showers across northern, western and eastern coasts. Many inland areas are 
expected to avoid most of the snow, but it will feel cold, with strong 
north-westerly winds.

Daytime temperatures are likely to be between 2C and -5C, but could dip lower 
where there is snow. A frost will develop overnight in many places, with severe 
frost likely in the north.

The air mass

 will spread southwards on Wednesday, with the heaviest and most frequent snow 
showers likely across northern and western Scotland, Northern Ireland and 
around Irish Sea coasts.

There will be coastal gales as well as a risk of hail and thunder in some 
locations.


The Met Office issued a “yellow” severe weather warning for snow and wind from 
Wednesday evening to noon on Thursday.

It said the cold air would bring snow showers and strong winds to areas 
including Blackburn with Darwen, Blackpool, Cheshire West and Chester, Cumbria, 
Greater Manchester, Halton, Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington.

Gusts of 55mph are expected in exposed coastal areas and on hills, as well as 
blizzards.


Areas subject to warnings could experience 2-5cm (0.8-2in) of snow, with 
10-20cm possible on higher ground. Lightning could accompany the heaviest 
showers, with potential disruption to power supplies as a consequence, the Met 
Office said.

Freezing temperatures across Europe in recent days have led to more than a 
dozen deaths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/09/several-die-poland-european-cold-weather-snow-continues>
 and major disruption to power, water supplies and transport networks. 
Temperatures as low as -30C caused ice to form on the Adriatic Sea, the Danube 
and many small rivers, lakes and ponds.

In Italy, eight deaths were blamed on the extreme cold, and there were two 
more weather-related deaths in Poland on Saturday. In Bulgaria, police said 
three people, including a man from Iraq and a Somali woman, had died from cold 
in mountains near Turkey as they travelled toEurope

Jenny Rourke, the deputy chief operational meteorologist at the Met Office, 
said: “A cold spell of weather will affect the UK from Wednesday. With strong 
north-westerly winds, all areas will feel the cold and there will be snow 
showers, especially in northern and western areas.

“With wintry weather anticipated later this week, we’ve issued weather warnings
 <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/warnings> for snow and wind, and 
we advise people to check the latest forecast and weather warnings before they 
travel.”

The Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: “We could see the coldest day of 
winter on Friday. A cold front moving in from the Atlantic will bring heavy 
frost and frequent snowstorms.

“It is likely that 5-10cm of snow will come in from the north and fall as far 
as the south of the country on Friday, and there could be even thicker snow in 
the hills.

“Daytime temperatures on Wednesday will be about 4-6C, but harsh winds will 
make it feel as if temperatures are well below freezing. Temperatures will 
become increasingly colder throughout the week and by Friday, it is likely that 
night-time temperatures will be as low as -2C.”
