Depends on the time, but this sounds great on on a system. I saw them once at 
Brixton Academy, amazing music.

The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor

It’s a swirling synth masterpiece by the Haitian duo. Not so well known but 
people seem to like dancing to it.

The track that currently gets the most rewinds

No idea how to do rewinds, but I have played this a few times across a set. I 
love the rumbling bass, the clave pattern and strange voices that dissolve in 
and out of the hiss. Spooky and very danceable.

The track I think has been unfairly slept on this year 
Untold: Doff

I don’t really think about music in that way, but this made a big impression 
on me last year. It’s brilliant, in its own galaxy, I imagine it’s how bits of 
[Talking Heads’] Remain In Light could have sounded 35 years on.

The track I wish i’d never played 
Cresa Watson: Dead

An amazing song, and people recognise the samples, but it’s just too maudlin.

The best track by my favourite new artist 
Tessela: Bottom Out

Tessela is a very established artist, but last year’s Bottom Out is very 
inventive. Stripped-down acid bassline with stark dub effects, I love this 
record.

I’ve never been to Ibiza but I’d like to see how this would sound there.

The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding 
Dinah Washington: I Could Write A Book

I’m a rubbish wedding DJ, but I think Dinah Washington’s version of this song 
is very romantic.

The track that should have been a crossover hit 
Gwen Guthrie: Padlock (Larry Levan Mix)

I guess Ain’t Nothin’ Goin’ On But The Rent was Gwen Guthrie’s true crossover 
hit but for me this is the one. I love every single moment of this record. The 
combination of talents that produced all that Compass Point stuff is incredible.

The track I’d play at my funeral 
Garnet Mimms: As Long As I Have You

Wouldn’t want anything downbeat, so it would have to be this; it’s soul at its 
most life-affirming.
