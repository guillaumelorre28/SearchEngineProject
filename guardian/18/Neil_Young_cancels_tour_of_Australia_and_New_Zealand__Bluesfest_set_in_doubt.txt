Neil Young <https://www.theguardian.com/music/neilyoung> has cancelled plans 
for a tour of Australia and New Zealand next year and Bluesfest is not 
confirming whether he will still be headlining the Byron Bay festival in April.

The musician is scheduled to play a three-hour set on the Friday night of the 
five-day festival with his latest backing group Promise of the Real.

In October Frontier Touring announced on Facebook 
<https://www.facebook.com/frontiertouring/posts/10153867412792409:0> that Young 
and his backing band would also perform shows in indoor arenas and special 
outdoor shows in Australia and New Zealand while he was here.

But the company announced on Tuesday that these shows would no longer be going 
ahead. It did not give a reason for the cancellation.

“Frontier Touring regret to advise that Neil Young will unfortunately no 
longer be undertaking a 2017 headline tour of Australia and New Zealand as 
previously ‘teased’ on our social media,” the company said in an emailed 
statement.


Bluesfest declined Guardian Australia’s request for comment about whether he 
would still be appearing.

On Monday Young – who performed in November at the Dakota Access pipeline 
protest site –published a long post to Facebook

 co-written with the actor Daryl Hannah, urging Barack Obama to intervene in 
the pipeline standoff, and criticising the “unnecessary and violent aggression” 
faced by protesters at Standing Rock.


“We are calling upon you, President Barack Obama, to step in and end the 
violence against the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock immediately,” 
he wrote.
