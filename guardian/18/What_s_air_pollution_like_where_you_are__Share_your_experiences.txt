developing world worst affected

, according to the WHO. We want to explore its impact on the daily lives of 
people around the world. If you live in a city that is affected by toxic air or 
you work in air quality control, we’d like to hear from you.

In December, China’s capital Beijing was effectively shut down

 due to air pollution, after it registered its first ever red alert for air 
quality. A similar situation occurred in Delhi in India, where thethreat to 
citizens from smog

 was judged so great that traffic was rationed, coal-fired power stations 
closed and diesel generators suspended.Schools were also closed in Iran’s 
capital, Tehran

 after a blanket of smog was blamed for a string of deaths. Air quality in 
London is among the worst in Europe, and is illegally in breach of EU limits.

From Beijing to Los Angeles, Marseille

 to Manila, the air in cities has deteriorated so much that it is often no 
longer safe to breathe. What’s air pollution like where you live and how has it 
impacted your daily life? What are you, your neighbourhood or your city 
government doing to improve air quality? If measures against pollution are 
being implemented in your city, what do you think about them? We also want to 
hear from those whose job it is to tackle air pollution.

Whichever city in the world you live in, please share your views, experiences 
and any photographs in the form below. If you’d like to send video, please 
email francesca.perry@theguardian.com. We’ll be using your responses in our 
reporting.
