appeal to have hisprison sentence for sodomy  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/anwar-ibrahim-guilty-in-sodomy-case>
overturned and will serve out the remaining 16 months of his sentence in jail.

Significantly the ruling means Anwar will not be allowed to contest the next 
election in 2018, which the opposition saw as their best chance to unseat prime 
ministerNajib Razak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/thousands-call-for-malaysian-prime-minister-najib-razak-to-quit>
 and end his ruling party’s six decades in power.

A five-member panel of judges ruled unanimously that there was no merit in 
Anwar’s application for a review of his 2014 conviction, his final legal option 
for an acquittal.

“We will not proceed to examine the applicant’s review application,” the court 
said.

Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered outside the Palace of Justice to show 
support for Anwar and police erected steel barricades around the court complex.

Anwar was led into the dock by more than a dozen prison guards. His wife, 
daughters and grandchildren were present. After the ruling he told reporters: 
“It is not the end of the road.”

Having led a coalition of opposition parties in 2013 to their largest ever 
electoral gains, Anwar, 69, isseen as the greatest threat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/20/anwar-ibrahim-malaysia-government-sodomy-charge>
 to the ruling United Malays National Organisation (Umno).

He served as deputy prime minister and finance minister in the 1990s for Umno 
under former leader Mahathir Mohamad but they fell out and he was removed from 
his post and jailed for several years amid outcry from human rights groups.

In 2013 he returned to politics to run a campaign against corruption and 
nepotism against Najib that won the popular vote but lost the election by 
number of legislators elected. Its was Umno’s worst ever election performance.

But Anwar returned to prison in 2015 after his longstanding conviction — for 
allegedly sodomising a former aide — was upheld. His supporters say the case is 
a politically motivated attempt to end his career.

This summer Anwar rejoined his old enemy Mahathir to try to unseat Najib, who 
in 2015 was thrown into a multi-billion dollar corruption scandal involving the 
debt-laden state fund 1MDB. Najib denies taking any money for personal gain.

The historic partnership between Anwar and Mahathir brought members of the 
opposition and Umno against Najib for the first time.

However under Malaysian law a person is banned from political activities for 
five years after the end of their sentence, closing the possibility of Anwar 
leading any campaign as he did in 2013.

The Free Anwar Now campaign released a statement ahead of the verdict saying 
the case had “been plagued with many anomalies and inconsistencies, 
questionable DNA evidence and tampering of critical evidence”.


“Anwar Ibrahim, who turns 70 next year, is surely not a hardened criminal that 
deserves the harshness of a prison sentence. He endures physical discomfort and 
mental anguish daily.”

Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, said 
the decision was a “real tragedy for justice” inMalaysia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia>.

“More than anything this outcome shows that the Malaysian courts were no match 
for prime minister Najib Razak’s political vendetta against Anwar,” he said.

“With this final decision running roughshod over Anwar’s rights and sending 
him back to prison, Najib and the ruling Umno party have just fired the 
starting gun on the expected 2018 election by permanently sidelining the 
political opposition’s most capable leader.”

Writing in the Guardian on Tuesday, Anwar said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/13/malaysia-needs-democracy-prison-muslim-majority-country?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard>
 his “political imprisonment” meant Malaysia needed “unyielding international 
encouragement and pressure”.

“The past 20 years … have seen our country go from bad to worse politically 
and economically, driven by compromised democratic institutions and years of 
systematic abuse by the ruling elite to maintain their grip on power.”
