The trade body representing newspapers has taken another step towards 
obtaining a judicial review of the Press Recognition Panel’s decision to 
recognise the regulator,Impress <https://www.theguardian.com/media/impress>.

The News Media Association (NMA) has issued documents at court and also served 
them 
<http://www.newsmediauk.org/Latest/nma-case-against-impress-decision-moves-to-next-stage>
 on the Press Recognition Panel (PRP) and Impress.

On the basis of legal advice, the NMA believes there were “serious and 
fundamental legal errors” in thePRP’s decision to grant Impress royal charter 
recognition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/25/impress-press-regulator-newspaper-publishers-max-moseley>
 in October last year.

That advice came from Lord Pannick QC and Iain Steele, which was detailed in a 
16-page letter to the PRP’s chairman, Dr David Wolfe QC 
<http://www.newsmediauk.org/write/MediaUploads/PDF%20Docs/Letter_to_PRP_Dated_5_December_2016.pdf>
, on 5 December.

In the letter, the NMA’s lawyers - RPC (Reynolds Porter Chamberlain) - accused 
the PRP of riding roughshod over the intentions of Lord Justice Leveson in his 
report.

RPC argued that Impress does not satisfy the requirements of an appropriate 
regulator as outlined by Leveson and as embodied in the charter.

RPC stated: “Leveson was clear that effectiveness meant that the majority of 
the press should be behind this body and specifically recommended: ‘a new 
system of regulation should not be considered sufficiently effective if it does 
not cover all significant news publishers.’”

It added: “There is no sense in which a body such as Impress has been formed 
‘by’ relevant publishers, nor even ‘on behalf of’ them.”

A spokeswoman for Impress said it would not be making a comment at this stage. 
UPDATED: David Wolfe said: “The PRP received a pre-action protocol letter from 
the NMA prior to Christmas and responded to that on 21 December 2016.

“In that letter we make clear that the PRP board is content with the robust 
decision it has made after allowing all parties three opportunities to provide 
the PRP with information they wanted us to consider.

“We have now received the NMA’s application for judicial review... We will be 
responding to the judicial review application in due course.”
