RB Leipzig <https://www.theguardian.com/football/red-bull-leipzig> extended 
their winning run to eight games in the league and restored their three-point 
lead over Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga.

Their bid to return to the top of the table got off to a heated start when 
Timo Werner fell in the Schalke penalty area only 19 seconds after kick-off. The
Schalke <https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke> goalkeeper Ralf Fährmann 
was booked and the referee Bastian Dankert awarded a penalty, though TV replays 
showed no contact was made.

“I’m sorry that it looks like a dive but that wasn’t my intention,” Werner 
said. “I told the referee that I wasn’t fouled by Fährmann but by Naldo,” he 
added, referring to a touch on his shoulder from Naldo.

Werner waited for Schalke’s protests to end before scoring from the spot.

Schalke’s sporting director, Christian Heidel, said: “He scores and goes 
celebrating to the corner. I don’t think he earned any sympathy there. But 
others would say he’s a professional. I’m of a different opinion. I wouldn’t be 
happy if one of ours did that.”

Schalke recovered and Sead Kolasinac equalised after half an hour, only to 
score an own goal seconds after the break when he attempted to clear Emil 
Forsberg’s free-kick.

Leipzig had more attempts in the second half and deservedly held on to restore 
their three-point lead over Bayern Munich. The promoted side, still unbeaten 
after 13 games, ended Schalke’s 12-game unbeaten run across all competitions.

“To be honest, it makes you sick,” said Fährmann, still incensed by the 
penalty decision after the game. “Werner told him [the referee] I didn’t foul 
him.”

Dankert acknowledged he made the wrong decision but denied hearing anything 
from Werner.
