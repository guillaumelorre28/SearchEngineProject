Hi Peaches! It’s been six years since you last released an album. What have 
you been up to?

So in 2010, I stopped touring I Feel Cream, then a theatre asked me to do a 
production, so I said I wanted to do Jesus Christ Superstar. Then they asked 
for a larger production, and Peaches Christ Superstar did a little tour in the 
States. Then we made a movie,Peaches <https://www.theguardian.com/music/peaches>
 Does Herself, then all of a sudden I was presenting it around the world at all 
these festivals. I was asked to play the lead in my first-ever opera, called 
Orfeo. The main role is a male character who represents music. I don’t know 
Italian or read music, so I had to take six months to learn it.

Now can you speak Italian?

No! But I had to learn how to sing these melodies. Then in 2014 it was like, 
let’s get down to it. I had bought a little house in Los Angeles and it had a 
garage, and I fixed it up. And finally called my friend Vice Cooler. We spent 
10 hours a day in my garage for a year making the album.

Do you split your time between LA and Berlin?

Yeah. There’s a lot going on in LA. There is a lot of rules, but when you come 
anywhere from Berlin you’re just like, are you kidding me? I can’t have this 
glass drink in my hand? I can’t stand over there after 1.45am cos there’s a 
school nearby? If I had it my way, I would hang out in LA in the day and in 
Berlin at night.

It’s quite a big commute.

I think if you did it going from Berlin you could do it. You know, back in 
time.

You’ve shot a video for every song on your new album, Rub.

Right now it’s such a good time, not only to make whatever you want, but you 
can show it wherever you want. So with these videos, there’s nothing that will 
hold me back from saying or doing what I want. For the song Rub, I wanted to do 
a video with all women, in every aspect, from the electrician to the makeup 
artist. I wanted to have itJodorowsky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alejandro-jodorowsky>[1] style, where 
nudity is not for a male gaze but just a freeing feeling. So my first image was 
like ... I want girls spraying or squirting off rocks.

 The video for Light in Places was shot using an all-female set and features a 
performer called Empress Stah who shoots lasers out of a buttplug. 
Right … 

Cos I have a friend in Paris who told me that she and her friends go on her 
roof and squirt off it. I was like, that’s amazing. So that was the impetus for 
doing it. For the video Rub, everybody is pretty well naked, and we also had a 
lot of not just queer porn performers but body-art people. We did it in the 
desert in Joshua Tree and we managed to have all women, and three women 
directors. It was a crazy bliss.

Did you notice a difference with it being an all-female set?

Yeah! I know it sounds silly but you have to confront whether something is a 
patriarchal thing, like is that a male patriarchal problem? But everybody was 
so blissed out, it was amazing. The video is very successful. There’s a lot of 
bush, a lot of things going on. But it’s not porn. It’s an incredible piece of 
work.

In the video for Light in Places, you have a performer called Empress Stah, 
who shoots lasers out of a buttplug 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHD2QqjcnR4>.

In that video we made an infinity box and you can only have two people in 
there, so I’d be in there with the DP[2], and this light swinging around in 
there. I love it. I’m really happy we shone a bit of a political light, like, 
see it another way.

What’s the political light?

My same political rant, that people should feel comfortable in their bodies.

So much has changed in terms of gender, women, feminism and how we talk about 
sex since your first album.The Teaches of Peaches came out in 2000. Gay 
marriage is legal in the US now.Exactly, yeah.

So if Rihanna is doing a mainstream pop song called S&M, for example, do you 
ever think, I did this first?[3]

Well, my goal was always to bring that to the mainstream, although people 
would look at me crazy, like how could that ever be mainstream? It blows my 
mind. I’m not like, damn, what am I going to do now? To me, it’s great. It’s 
mainstream and I can celebrate it.

Did you ever expect it to go mainstream?

No. I was just like, god, our struggle. But you also have to be careful, and 
I’ve said this a lot lately, but things are growing exponentially in every 
direction. It’s like a dot in the middle and everything goes out. There’s more 
feminist discourse and there’s more post-gender visible, you know … but there’s 
also more Mormons and more Republicans and more gay Republicans, which is 
always very strange. But there’s still things like, for instance, I have a song 
on the album called Dumb Fuck. England has a problem not just with “fuck” but 
with “dumb fuck”. They don’t want to use that.

Who has a problem with it?

Radio will not play this song. I don’t know if this is the same as in the 
States, but there’s a double standard with hip-hop. One of the biggest songs 
this year is “I ain’t fuckin with you, you dumbass bitch”[4] . I love that 
song, don’t get me wrong. But that gets to be on the radio and I say “Dumb 
Fuck” and I can’t get that on the radio.

Who is the dumb fuck?

It’s a bad relationship. It’s about that person being cowardly.

I’m paraphrasing, but John Waters, who you once toured with, has said it’s 
harder and harder to shock people, because something like Jackass is just 
accepted as normal entertainment. Do you feel that way if you see Miley Cyrus 
with tape over her breasts?

You know, whatever. Tape over your tits. Which was started by Wendy O 
Williams, who was amazing. It’s all because of what we’ve all done, right? The 
thing is, that shouldn’t stop us from enjoying and celebrating and questioning 
and finding the new way.

So is pushing boundaries in the mainstream to be celebrated?

Some people say they’re just using it as marketing, but they’re still out 
there.

Or people might say they’re bad role models.

Listen, kids find their role models. Kids come up to me and say, I found you 
when I was 12. Recently this boy told me he saw me opening up for Marilyn 
Manson ten years ago, but he was nine. His dad took him to Marilyn Manson, I 
opened up, and he said, no forget Marilyn Manson, it’s her! He’s in a band now. 
A great band. I don’t think we look for role models. I think they find us. You 
can’t tell a kid. It’s not going to stick if you say, you have to listen to 
Beethoven. Then it’s like, no, Rachmaninoff is my jam.

 I Feel Cream video. 
I first saw you live in around 2002, during the whole electroclash scene.

Actually, electroclash was before its time. It was so queer and so out there 
that people couldn’t handle it, you know what I mean? So it died and became nu 
rave, which was more focused on fashion and it was straight. And then it became 
huge. I realised, whoa, they took everything good about electroclash and made 
it straight.

It filtered down into pop eventually, too.

I would say like when Britney Spears started to get all sexed up, like, um, 
I’m Britney Bitch, or even that one from a few years ago, “You want a Maserati? 
You want a hot body?” <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt8VYOfr8To>[5] That’s 
an ultimate electroclash song. And definitely Gaga was hanging around that 
electroclash scene seeing people like me play. I just think it’s amazing cos 
people are down on electroclash but it really has suckers. It influenced a lot.

 Close Up is great. I love that you got Kim Gordon [6] on it.

She came in and did one take. I was a little nervous, I thought maybe it’s not 
her kind of music, but it was really a testament to her experience. There was 
no fear. I had even greater respect for her after that. Something exciting is 
going on outside … [Peaches is distracted.] Oh, they’re watching my video – the 
one with Margaret Cho[7]. I’m watching them blush now.

What happens in this one?

I think we might be fucking a watermelon right now. We have these knitted 
naked suits but they’re male. Hers is yellow cos she’s Margaret “Asian” Cho and 
mine’s pink cos I’m white. I found these outfits so in the video we put them on 
and do things like go jogging. And we do a bunch of stuff. It’s fun!
