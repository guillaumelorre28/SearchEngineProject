India’s environmental watchdog has fined a group led by a Hindu guru 50m 
rupees (£520,000) for constructing features that altered the topography and 
flow of aDelhi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/delhi> river before a 
cultural festival this weekend.

The National Green Tribunal ruled it would allow the Art of Living Foundation 
to hold the World Culture festival on payment of the fine, which the group’s 
leader refused.

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who founded the group in 1982, said he would challenge 
the order in an appeals court. “We have done nothing wrong. I will go to jail 
but not pay the fine,” he said, adding that the foundation would clean the 
riverbank after the festival.

The tribunal issued the verdict on Wednesday in response to petitions filed by 
environmentalists who say the roads, ramps and pontoon bridges could cause 
irreversible damage to the Yamuna floodplains.

The prime minister, Narendra Modi, is scheduled to inaugurate the festival on 
Friday, but the president’s office said Pranab Mukherjee would not attend the 
closing ceremony on Sunday. The festival is expected to be attended by millions 
and will showcase performances by thousands of musicians and dancers.

The river Yamuna is a tributary of the Ganges that swells during the monsoon. 
Hindus bathe in the river during religious festivals, but not many people swim 
there.

The Yamuna looks dark with a foul smell, and officials say it is tainted with 
sewage and industrial pollution. The water is chemically treated before being 
supplied to Delhi’s nearly 18 million residents as drinking water.

Art of Living organised a similar festival in Berlin in 2011.
