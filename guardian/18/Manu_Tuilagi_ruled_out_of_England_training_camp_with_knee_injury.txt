The centre, playing only his sixth game following a two-month lay-off because 
of a groin problem and with the England head coach Eddie Jones looking on, 
hobbled off after only eight minutes at Welford Road, having fallen awkwardly 
in a double tackle.

Leicester’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, said Tuilagi would be 
assessed on Monday after the problem area had settled down but England have 
opted to replace the 25-year-old with the Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni.

A short statement read: “Manu Tuilagi will not attend England’s training camp 
in Brighton because of an injury sustained duringLeicester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/leicestertigers> Tigers’ defeat to Saracens. 
Semesa Rokoduguni has been called in to join up with the 33-man squad.”

Tuilagi, who has been capped 26 times by England, has been beset by injuries 
for the last couple of years but was on Saturday called up to Jones’ 33-man 
squad for a two-day camp on the south coast.

While his knock will heighten fears of another lengthy period on the 
sidelines, Cockerill is remaining positive.

He said: “He got a bang on the outside of his right knee and we don’t know the 
extent of the injury yet. His groin is feeling great so that’s one good thing, 
there’s always a positive.

“It’s disappointing because he is important to us. Normally it’s 24 hours so 
we will see how it has settled down in the morning to see if there’s any 
swelling.

“It might just be a bang and a bit of swelling, it might be a couple of weeks. 
I’m just guessing.”
