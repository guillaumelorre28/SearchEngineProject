During the Chinatown riots of 1998 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia>, shopkeeper Tjie 
Thian Siak was lucky to escape harm. The mobs were more interested in looting 
electronics, raiding banks and burning tyres than they were in stealing house 
paint from his small store.

When the violence stopped, Siak, now 69, decided to stay in the neighbourhood. 
But he says many of the Chinese-Indonesian families who ran furniture stores 
here left and never came back.

“There’s not that many left, they are afraid,” says Siak. “They moved to 
residential areas: that’s why it’s quiet in the evening. Before the riots it 
was still busy until nine or 10pm. Now the shops close at five.”

Jakarta may be a city on the move – a metropolis of constant buzz, and what 
feels like perpetual construction – but one street in the Indonesian capital 
hasn’t changed much in almost 20 years.

Many of the storefronts of Pintu Besar Selatan, in the Glodok area of north 
Jakarta, are boarded up with bricks.

Vines and electrical wires mould into one. Peer into the empty windows and you 
can still see the charred ceilings, the steel beams curved into a parabola by 
the heat of the fires.

“The traces are still there,” says Abidin Kusno, director of the Centre for 
South-east Asia at the University of British Columbia. “No one seems to claim 
the buildings or repair them. It’s almost like a wounded landscape.”

The neighbourhood has long been associated with Jakarta’s Indonesian-Chinese 
community. In May 1998, when angry mobsvented their rage against the economic 
crisis <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-27991754> and three decades of 
authoritarian rule under former president Suharto, much of the violence was 
directed at the ethnic Chinese minority.

Many Chinese-Indonesians have lived in the country for generations, and faced 
deep discrimination and cultural suppression under theSuharto regime 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/27/obituaries.johngittings>. Today, 
they remain cautious: many shop owners here prefer not to discuss the past.

Some of the abandoned properties in the street are for sale, but the signs are 
looking a bit weathered now. One building affected by 1998 is impossible to 
access, even with the key: years ago, the local council mistakenly poured the 
concrete for the pavement too high, cementing in the door – and the stories 
behind it.

Many people who own these properties don’t seem to have any immediate plans on 
how to develop them – perhaps because it is easier to keep the spaces locked up 
and forgotten.

“People really do not want to bring it up again,” says Kusno of 1998. “At the 
same time, they don’t know what to do with [the empty buildings].”

Siak, for example, bought one of the abandoned buildings from a family who 
fled, but he hasn’t touched it for almost 20 years. Vines now drip down among 
the quiet bricks.

Not all of the vacant buildings here were destroyed in the riots – one is 
charred from a kitchen fire, while the greenery that carpets the now-defunct 
Metropole hotel speaks to a failed business venture.

Among the abandoned spaces, however, there are signs of creativity. Street 
artists now hawk portraits of princess Diana and Bono, using an abandoned 
building to store their supplies; some have settled here into makeshift shacks.
