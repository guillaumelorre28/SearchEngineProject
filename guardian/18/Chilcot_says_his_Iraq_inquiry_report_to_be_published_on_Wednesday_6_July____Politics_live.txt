Afternoon summary

 * Sir John Chilcot has announced that his long-awaited report into the Iraq 
war will be published on Wednesday 6 July. 
 * The EU referendum campaign has intensified with David Cameron and Boris 
Johnson, effectively the main figureheads for Remain and Leave respectively, 
both giving major speeches on the subject. They were both long and substantial 
speeches, but both men may overstated their case. Cameron was accused of 
scaremongering after he included a passage in his speech suggesting that 
leaving the EU could increase the chance of war in Europe. He said: 
Isolationism has never served this country well. Whenever we turn our back on 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, sooner or later we come 
to regret it ...

The serried rows of white headstones in lovingly-tended Commonwealth war 
cemeteries stand as silent testament to the price that this country has paid to 
help restore peace and order in Europe.

Can we be so sure that peace and stability on our continent are assured beyond 
any shadow of doubt? Is that a risk worth taking?

I would never be so rash as to make that assumption.

It’s barely been 20 years since war in the Balkans and genocide on our 
continent in Srebrenica. In the last few years, we have seen tanks rolling into 
Georgia and Ukraine. And of this I am completely sure.

The European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> has helped reconcile 
countries which were once at each others’ throats for decades. Britain has a 
fundamental national interest in maintaining common purpose in Europe to avoid 
future conflict between European countries.

And that requires British leadership, and for Britain to remain a member. The 
truth is this: what happens in our neighbourhood matters to Britain.

Cameron’s claim that the EU has helped maintain peace in the EU is relatively 
uncontentious, but his assertion that this requires continued British 
membership is more questionable. Johnson claimed that even Cameron himself did 
not believe what he was saying. But Johnson’s own speech was overshadowed by 
what he said in the Q&A afterwards, when he appeared to blame the EU for 
provoking Russia into invading Ukraine. (See1.44pm.)

This lead toJack Straw, the former Labour foreign secretary, and others calling 
him a Putin apololgist.

 * Jeremy Corbyn is saying that Labour MPs should stop criticising colleagues 
- including himself, he implies - on TV. He is going to deliver the message at 
tonight’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party, but his comments were 
released in advance. He says: 
We also need to reflect on the impact of what we do and say here on the public 
outside, across the country. I don’t expect, or even want, blind loyalty, but 
members and supporters expect us all to focus on taking on the Tories – and for 
our debates to be focused on policy, not personality.

Members also tell me that they don’t think Labour MPs should be parading on 
the media to give a running commentary on our party. If we are on the media we 
are there to give our verdict on this failed and divisive government, not on 
each other.

He is also going to tell the PLP the election results were “mixed” for Labour. 
He says:

Jon Trickett set us the target of closing the gap with the Tories at the 2015 
general election. Last year we were nearly seven points behind. The projection 
from Thursday’s results by the BBC and Professor John Curtice shows that 
nationally we are now a point ahead of the Tories in our national share of the 
vote.

Last week we won all four mayoral elections, including the two gains in London 
and Bristol, we made a net gain in the number of Labour councils across 
England, we held councils across the south, we scored the second best result in 
Wales since devolution, and we made a net gain of three police and crime 
commissioners.

But let’s be clear. The results were mixed. We are not yet doing enough to win 
in 2020. This is only the first stage in our task of building a winning 
electoral majority, attracting voters from all the other parties and mobilising 
those who have been turned off politics altogether – as we did last week in 
Bristol and London.

 * Andrew Travers, the chief executive of Barnet council has left his post 
after an election-day blunder resulted in many people in the north London 
borough being unable to vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/09/barnet-council-chief-andrew-travers-steps-down-election-blunder>
 * Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, has been giving a public 
dressing down after refusing to appear before MPs.As the Press Association 
reports, Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Commons Treasury committee, said Elliott 
had only agreed to give evidence to a hearing this afternoon after they had 
issued a parliamentary order summonsing him to appear. He told Elliott: 
This is the first time that certainly I’ve ever felt the need to issue such a 
thing [parliamentary order] in order to secure a witness. I think frankly the 
difficulty of getting you here is scarcely consistent with the application that 
you have put to be the lead campaigner for leaving the EU. Do you have any 
appreciation of what it looks like to a group of MPs that you are telling them 
you would rather go to Switzerland than turn up?

Elliott claimed it had always been his intention to give evidence to the 
committee - which is looking at the economic costs and benefits of EU 
membership - at “the earliest possible opportunity”.


 * Swing voters in the key parliamentary seat of Nuneaton told pollsters 
Jeremy Corbyn was “old-fashioned” and “scruffy” when they went to assess the 
party’s prospects of seizing it back in 2020. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/09/jeremy-corbyn-scruffy-old-fashioned-swing-voters>
That’s all from me.

Thanks for the comments.

Chilcot report into Iraq war to be published on Wednesday 6 July

The Iraq inquiry has announced that its report will be published on Wednesday 
6 July. Here is the press statement it has put out.

Sir John Chilcot and the prime minister have agreed that the Iraq inquiry’s 
report will be published on Wednesday 6 July 2016, it was announced today.

 The date was confirmed in correspondence 
<http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/news/2016-05-09_iraq_inquiry_report_to_be_published_on_6_july_2016.aspx>
 between Sir John and the prime minister and follows completion of both the 
report and the national security checking process. This checking process is a 
standard procedure for inquiries and ensures that government ministers meet 
their obligations to safeguard national security and under Article 2 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) when publishing the inquiry’s 
report. Now this checking process is complete, the Inquiry can prepare its 2.6m 
word report for publication.

The Iraq inquiry was set up in June 2009 by former prime minister Gordon Brown 
to consider the UK’s involvement in Iraq from the summer of 2001 to the end of 
July 2009. The scope of the report is unprecedented; covering decisions over a 
nine year period to establish what happened and to identify lessons that can be 
learned. To construct an accurate account of events and actions the inquiry 
received evidence from over 150 witnesses, held more than 130 sessions of oral 
evidence, and analysed more than 150,000 government documents as well as open 
source material. The report and supporting documents will be published on the 
inquiry’s website alongside a guide on how to read the report. Arrangements are 
being made so that families of those who died as a result of the conflict in 
Iraq can have early access to the report on the day of publication. Details 
will be available in due course.

 In his letter to the prime minister, Sir John Chilcot said:

 “... National security checking of the Inquiry’s report has now been 
completed, without the need for any redactions to appear in the text. I am 
grateful for the speed with which it was accomplished.”

 On selecting 6 July for publication, he went on to say:

 “This will allow suitable time for the inquiry to prepare the 2.6m word 
report for publication, including final proof reading, formatting, printing and 
the steps required for electronic publication.”

My colleague Ewen MacAskill has written an analysis of David Cameron’s speech, 
and his suggestion that leaving the EU would put peace at risk. Ewen is a bit 
sceptical. Here is an excerpt.

Decades of trade and political cooperation on the continent through the EU and 
its predecessors have undoubtedly helped to make war between the major European 
powers less likely – unthinkable, even. But the the key word is “helped”.

And here is the full article.

Is David Cameron right that leaving EU could increase the risk of war?

Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP and former shadow business secretary, is also 
having a go atBoris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> over 
his Russia/Ukraine comments. He said:

The EU referendum campaign has brought out the worst in the former mayor of 
London, Boris Johnson. First there was his nonsense about President Obama’s 
Kenyan ancestry. Now he’s become an apologist for President Putin. And this is 
the man who wants to become our next prime minister.

Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs 
committee, has announced today that he will be voting to leave the EU. He said:

It is in our interest for the EU to have a much stronger defence capability, 
the issue is whether it is in our interest to be part of it. If Britons felt 
sufficient commitment to the European ideal it would be right to join it and 
encourage it. But the difficult truth is our geography, history, culture and 
economic interest produce a much more qualified commitment to that ideal than 
that of our continental partners.

I want my country to have a positive role in the world, not a negative one. 
The only positive role on offer is a global internationalist one. Let’s take 
it, embrace our unique global advantages and assist our European neighbours 
with resolving the politics and democratic accountability of ever closer union, 
rather than obstructing them.

In his speech Boris Johnson suggested that the EU was partly responsible for 
the rise of the far-right inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. He said:

In Austria the far-right have just won an election for the first time since 
the 1930s. The French National Front are on the march in France, and Marine le 
Pen may do well in the Presidential elections. You could not say that EU 
integration is promoting either mutual understanding or moderation, and the 
economic consequence range from nugatory to disastrous.

In response, in a statement sent out by Britain Stronger in Europe, David 
Miliband, the former Labour foreign secretary, said this claim was bizarre. 

The claim by Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> today 
that the EU is fuelling the far right is especially bizarre since he has caved 
into the call of the far right to break up the EU. There is nothing hopeful 
about making common cause with Mrs Le Pen.

Jack Straw accuses Boris Johnson of being a 'Putin apologist'

In a press notice put out by Britain Stronger in Europe, Jack Straw, the 
Labour former home secretary and foreign secretary, has described Boris Johnson 
as a “Putin apologist” on the basis of what he said about Russia and Ukraine. 
(See1.44pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/09/eu-referendum-cameron-warns-that-leaving-eu-could-put-peace-at-risk-politics-live?page=with:block-573072f3e4b07f53f216af4b#block-573072f3e4b07f53f216af4b>
Straw said:

Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> has plumbed new 
depths today by joining the likes of Farage, Le Pen and Wilders in blaming the 
EU, rather than Vladimir Putin, for what has happened in Ukraine.

If further evidence were needed about the careless disregard for our security 
demonstrated by Leave campaigners, by being a Putin apologist, Johnson has 
provided it.

Being part of the world’s largest free trade market is a source of economic 
expansion and empowerment. Leaving would destroy the opportunities and life 
chances of people across our country for generations to come.

Flamboyant rhetoric is no substitute for a plan for our country. Today was 
further proof that leaving is a leap in to the dark that is too big a risk to 
take.

Britain Stronger in Europe, like Edward Lucas (see 2.33pm),  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/09/eu-referendum-cameron-warns-that-leaving-eu-could-put-peace-at-risk-politics-live?page=with:block-5730916ee4b0af04cb88974f#block-5730916ee4b0af04cb88974f>
also points out that Johnson used a Telegraph article in 2014 to firmly blame 
President Putin for the conflict in Ukraine. In that article Johnson also said 
it was time to make Europe’s common foreign security policy actually work.

 * Sir John Chilcot has announced that his long-awaited report into the Iraq 
war will be published on Wednesday 6 July. 
 * The EU referendum campaign has intensified with David Cameron and Boris 
Johnson, effectively the main figureheads for Remain and Leave respectively, 
both giving major speeches on the subject. They were both long and substantial 
speeches, but both men may overstated their case. Cameron was accused of 
scaremongering after he included a passage in his speech suggesting that 
leaving the EU could increase the chance of war in Europe. He said: 
Isolationism has never served this country well. Whenever we turn our back on 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, sooner or later we come 
to regret it ...

The serried rows of white headstones in lovingly-tended Commonwealth war 
cemeteries stand as silent testament to the price that this country has paid to 
help restore peace and order in Europe.

Can we be so sure that peace and stability on our continent are assured beyond 
any shadow of doubt? Is that a risk worth taking?

I would never be so rash as to make that assumption.

It’s barely been 20 years since war in the Balkans and genocide on our 
continent in Srebrenica. In the last few years, we have seen tanks rolling into 
Georgia and Ukraine. And of this I am completely sure.

The European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> has helped reconcile 
countries which were once at each others’ throats for decades. Britain has a 
fundamental national interest in maintaining common purpose in Europe to avoid 
future conflict between European countries.

And that requires British leadership, and for Britain to remain a member. The 
truth is this: what happens in our neighbourhood matters to Britain.

Cameron’s claim that the EU has helped maintain peace in the EU is relatively 
uncontentious, but his assertion that this requires continued British 
membership is more questionable. Johnson claimed that even Cameron himself did 
not believe what he was saying. But Johnson’s own speech was overshadowed by 
what he said in the Q&A afterwards, when he appeared to blame the EU for 
provoking Russia into invading Ukraine. (See1.44pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/09/eu-referendum-cameron-warns-that-leaving-eu-could-put-peace-at-risk-politics-live?page=with:block-573072f3e4b07f53f216af4b#block-573072f3e4b07f53f216af4b>
This lead toJack Straw, the former Labour foreign secretary, and others calling 
him a Putin apololgist.

 * Jeremy Corbyn is saying that Labour MPs should stop criticising colleagues 
- including himself, he implies - on TV. He is going to deliver the message at 
tonight’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party, but his comments were 
released in advance. He says: 
We also need to reflect on the impact of what we do and say here on the public 
outside, across the country. I don’t expect, or even want, blind loyalty, but 
members and supporters expect us all to focus on taking on the Tories – and for 
our debates to be focused on policy, not personality.

Members also tell me that they don’t think Labour MPs should be parading on 
the media to give a running commentary on our party. If we are on the media we 
are there to give our verdict on this failed and divisive government, not on 
each other.

He is also going to tell the PLP the election results were “mixed” for Labour. 
He says:

Jon Trickett set us the target of closing the gap with the Tories at the 2015 
general election. Last year we were nearly seven points behind. The projection 
from Thursday’s results by the BBC and Professor John Curtice shows that 
nationally we are now a point ahead of the Tories in our national share of the 
vote.

Last week we won all four mayoral elections, including the two gains in London 
and Bristol, we made a net gain in the number of Labour councils across 
England, we held councils across the south, we scored the second best result in 
Wales since devolution, and we made a net gain of three police and crime 
commissioners.

But let’s be clear. The results were mixed. We are not yet doing enough to win 
in 2020. This is only the first stage in our task of building a winning 
electoral majority, attracting voters from all the other parties and mobilising 
those who have been turned off politics altogether – as we did last week in 
Bristol and London.

 * Andrew Travers, the chief executive of Barnet council has left his post 
after an election-day blunder resulted in many people in the north London 
borough being unable to vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/09/barnet-council-chief-andrew-travers-steps-down-election-blunder>
 * Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, has been giving a public 
dressing down after refusing to appear before MPs.As the Press Association 
reports, Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Commons Treasury committee, said Elliott 
had only agreed to give evidence to a hearing this afternoon after they had 
issued a parliamentary order summonsing him to appear. He told Elliott: 
This is the first time that certainly I’ve ever felt the need to issue such a 
thing [parliamentary order] in order to secure a witness. I think frankly the 
difficulty of getting you here is scarcely consistent with the application that 
you have put to be the lead campaigner for leaving the EU. Do you have any 
appreciation of what it looks like to a group of MPs that you are telling them 
you would rather go to Switzerland than turn up?

Elliott claimed it had always been his intention to give evidence to the 
committee - which is looking at the economic costs and benefits of EU 
membership - at “the earliest possible opportunity”.


 * Swing voters in the key parliamentary seat of Nuneaton told pollsters 
Jeremy Corbyn was “old-fashioned” and “scruffy” when they went to assess the 
party’s prospects of seizing it back in 2020.

That’s all from me.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Here is Sir John Chilcot’s letter to David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> about setting the date for 
publication of his report.
 Chilcot’s letter to Cameron Photograph: Iraq inquiry 
And here is Cameron’s letter to Chilcot.
 Cameron’s reply to Chilcot Photograph: Iraq inquiry  
The Iraq inquiry has announced that its report will be published on Wednesday 
6 July. Here is the press statement it has put out.

Sir John Chilcot and the prime minister have agreed that the Iraq inquiry’s 
report will be published on Wednesday 6 July 2016, it was announced today.

 The date was confirmed in correspondence 
<http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/news/2016-05-09_iraq_inquiry_report_to_be_published_on_6_july_2016.aspx>
 between Sir John and the prime minister and follows completion of both the 
report and the national security checking process. This checking process is a 
standard procedure for inquiries and ensures that government ministers meet 
their obligations to safeguard national security and under Article 2 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) when publishing the inquiry’s 
report. Now this checking process is complete, the Inquiry can prepare its 2.6m 
word report for publication.

The Iraq inquiry was set up in June 2009 by former prime minister Gordon Brown 
to consider the UK’s involvement in Iraq from the summer of 2001 to the end of 
July 2009. The scope of the report is unprecedented; covering decisions over a 
nine year period to establish what happened and to identify lessons that can be 
learned. To construct an accurate account of events and actions the inquiry 
received evidence from over 150 witnesses, held more than 130 sessions of oral 
evidence, and analysed more than 150,000 government documents as well as open 
source material. The report and supporting documents will be published on the 
inquiry’s website alongside a guide on how to read the report. Arrangements are 
being made so that families of those who died as a result of the conflict in 
Iraq can have early access to the report on the day of publication. Details 
will be available in due course.

 In his letter to the prime minister, Sir John Chilcot said:

 “... National security checking of the Inquiry’s report has now been 
completed, without the need for any redactions to appear in the text. I am 
grateful for the speed with which it was accomplished.”

 On selecting 6 July for publication, he went on to say:

 “This will allow suitable time for the inquiry to prepare the 2.6m word 
report for publication, including final proof reading, formatting, printing and 
the steps required for electronic publication.”

My colleague Ewen MacAskill has written an analysis of David Cameron’s speech, 
and his suggestion that leaving the EU would put peace at risk. Ewen is a bit 
sceptical. Here is an excerpt.

Decades of trade and political cooperation on the continent through the EU and 
its predecessors have undoubtedly helped to make war between the major European 
powers less likely – unthinkable, even. But the the key word is “helped”.

And here is the full article.

Is David Cameron right that leaving EU could increase the risk of war?

Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP and former shadow business secretary, is also 
having a go atBoris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> over 
his Russia/Ukraine comments. He said:

The EU referendum campaign has brought out the worst in the former mayor of 
London, Boris Johnson. First there was his nonsense about President Obama’s 
Kenyan ancestry. Now he’s become an apologist for President Putin. And this is 
the man who wants to become our next prime minister.
 
Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs 
committee, has announced today that he will be voting to leave the EU. He said:

It is in our interest for the EU to have a much stronger defence capability, 
the issue is whether it is in our interest to be part of it. If Britons felt 
sufficient commitment to the European ideal it would be right to join it and 
encourage it. But the difficult truth is our geography, history, culture and 
economic interest produce a much more qualified commitment to that ideal than 
that of our continental partners.

I want my country to have a positive role in the world, not a negative one. 
The only positive role on offer is a global internationalist one. Let’s take 
it, embrace our unique global advantages and assist our European neighbours 
with resolving the politics and democratic accountability of ever closer union, 
rather than obstructing them.
 Crispin Blunt Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA  
In his speech Boris Johnson suggested that the EU was partly responsible for 
the rise of the far-right inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. He said:

In Austria the far-right have just won an election for the first time since 
the 1930s. The French National Front are on the march in France, and Marine le 
Pen may do well in the Presidential elections. You could not say that EU 
integration is promoting either mutual understanding or moderation, and the 
economic consequence range from nugatory to disastrous.

In response, in a statement sent out by Britain Stronger in Europe, David 
Miliband, the former Labour foreign secretary, said this claim was bizarre. 

The claim by Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> today 
that the EU is fuelling the far right is especially bizarre since he has caved 
into the call of the far right to break up the EU. There is nothing hopeful 
about making common cause with Mrs Le Pen.
 
Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister and a former EU and UN special 
envoy to the Balkans, has posted another tweet aboutBoris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris>. He is also accusing Johnson of 
being a Putin apologist.
Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) 
I'm sorry to say, but @BorisJohnson <https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson> is 
totally ignorant of the facts on Ukraine, EU and Russia. Apologist for Putin.

In a press notice put out by Britain Stronger in Europe, Jack Straw, the 
Labour former home secretary and foreign secretary, has described Boris Johnson 
as a “Putin apologist” on the basis of what he said about Russia and Ukraine. 
(See1.44pm.)

Straw said:

Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> has plumbed new 
depths today by joining the likes of Farage, Le Pen and Wilders in blaming the 
EU, rather than Vladimir Putin, for what has happened in Ukraine.

If further evidence were needed about the careless disregard for our security 
demonstrated by Leave campaigners, by being a Putin apologist, Johnson has 
provided it.

Being part of the world’s largest free trade market is a source of economic 
expansion and empowerment. Leaving would destroy the opportunities and life 
chances of people across our country for generations to come.

Flamboyant rhetoric is no substitute for a plan for our country. Today was 
further proof that leaving is a leap in to the dark that is too big a risk to 
take.

Britain Stronger in Europe, like Edward Lucas (see 2.33pm),  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/09/eu-referendum-cameron-warns-that-leaving-eu-could-put-peace-at-risk-politics-live?page=with:block-5730916ee4b0af04cb88974f#block-5730916ee4b0af04cb88974f>
also points out that Johnson used a Telegraph article in 2014 to firmly blame 
President Putin for the conflict in Ukraine. In that article Johnson also said 
it was time to make Europe’s common foreign security policy actually work.
