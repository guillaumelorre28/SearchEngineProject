Allow me to clarify Japan’s stance and its efforts on its recognition of 
history (Nanjing massacre, Editorial, 14 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-nanjing-massacre-remembering-war-crimes>
). In his statement on the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war, 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said: “We Japanese, across generations, must squarely 
face the history of the past. We have the responsibility to inherit the past, 
in all humbleness, and pass it on to the future.” He made clear that Japan had 
repeatedly expressed deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during 
the war, and that the position articulated by the previous cabinets would 
“remain unshakable into the future”. Since the end of the second world war, 
Japan has built a free and democratic country, valuing the rule of law, which 
has steadfastly walked the path of peace and contributed to the stability of 
the international community. Japan will continue on this path together with the 
United Kingdom and countries that share basic values such as freedom, 
democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
