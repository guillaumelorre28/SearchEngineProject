Cool, unruffled and polite, Sir Andrew Wood is every inch the Foreign Office 
mandarin, and not a diplomat ordinarily associated with the kind of cold 
war-style alleged sex scandal currently embroiling the president-elect,Donald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

Yet to his evident discomfort, Wood has found himself thrust front and centre 
of a story that has generated global interest and sent shudders around 
Washington and Whitehall on the eve of an inauguration that will be stained by 
the furore.

Wood, 77, knew and respected Christopher Steele, the ex-MI6 officer who wrote 
the 35-page dossier that contained lurid allegations about Trump. Wood also 
spoke to the Republican senator John McCain about the claims.

The two men had met at an “international security forum” in Canada last 
November – Wood addressed delegates about Ukraine, McCain about Syria. But it 
was their private discussion about Russia that set in trainthis week’s 
remarkable events 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/10/fbi-chief-given-dossier-by-john-mccain-alleging-secret-trump-russia-contacts>
.

Wood shared with the veteran senator what he knew about the dossier and warned 
that if any of its central claims were true, Trump could be blackmailed byRussia
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>. McCain was worried enough to seek 
out a copy of the documents for himself – which he then passed to the FBI.

Wood, the UK ambassador to Moscow between 1995 and 2000, explained the 
sequence of events in various media interviews on Friday – using the kind of 
moderated language that no doubt helped persuade McCain, and then the heads of 
the US intelligence agencies, that both President Obama and the brash 
incumbent, needed to know what was being circulated.

At a point when the British government was hoping the story would go away, 
Wood lobbed the ball back into the billionaire’s court.

He told the Guardian the report’s key allegation – that Trump and Russia’s 
leadership were communicating via secret back channels during the presidential 
campaign – was eminently plausible.

“I think it has to be disproved, rather than anything else,” he said.

Of Steele, who compiled the dossier last year at the behest of Trump’s 
political enemies, Woodtold BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday morning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/13/trump-dossier-uk-ambassador-moscow-john-mccain-andrew-wood>
 he knew him to be a “very competent professional operator … I do not think he 
would make things up. I don’t think he would necessarily always draw the 
correct judgment, but that’s not the same thing at all.”

Later, Wood was more generous in his assessment of Steele, telling the 
Guardian he “rated his judgment”.

“I take the report seriously. I don’t think it’s totally implausible. It’s 
conceivable he [Steele] has been duped or has exaggerated what his sources have 
been telling him. But I can’t really believe the dupe argument. Why would they 
[the Kremlin] bother?”

These are questions not currently being entertained by Trump – not if his 
latest tweets are anything to go by.

Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and 
Republicans - FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists. Probably...

All of which suggests the debate about the dossier and its unsubstantiated 
claims are likely to rumble on in the US and the UK – which is likely to 
frustrate Downing Street as it tries to build bridges with a new, unpredictable 
administration.

It was GCHQ that tipped off the US about Russia hacking the Democratic 
Convention, and it was anMI6 <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi6> officer whose 
work on Trump has caused the combustible businessman such embarrassment this 
week.

How the Trump dossier came to light: secret sources, a retired spy and John 
McCain

No wonder, then, that Downing Street has been so reluctant to engage on the 
subject this week, and MI6 has been in even less communicative than usual. For 
them, Wood’s intervention is no help at all. But they know him, and his 
credentials. Like it or not, Wood’s opinions carry weight. Why?

For five years he had one of the toughest jobs in Britain’s foreign service: 
our man in Moscow. His stint in the Russian capital coincided with political 
and economic crisis and the very public waning of Russia’s leader Boris Yeltsin.

Wood packed his bags and left Russia just as a new and different president 
took power. His name was Vladimir Putin and he was a former career spy.

Over the past 17 years Wood has been a cool-eyed observer of Russian affairs, 
as the country has gone from chaotic semi-democracy to a repressive state. The 
ambassador is not usually in the headlines. He’s more often seen at Chatham 
House, the scholarly London foreign affairs thinktank, where he is an associate 
fellow in the Russian and Eurasia programme.

From here, he has authored a succession of papers. They have charted the 
dismantling under Putin of civil society, as well as Russia’s external 
misadventures: its covert 2014 invasion of eastern Ukraine, and annexation of 
Crimea. He subtly rejects one of the Kremlin’s key foreign policy concepts: 
that it has the right to influence and bully former Soviet countries outside 
its borders.

In May 2016 Wood noted: “The Kremlin account of Russia’s national interests is 
poisoned by assumptions formed in a world which passed away with the end of the 
cold war and the collapse of the USSR.”

Present-day Russian policy makers were “apparently untroubled by a serious 
examination” of what was true, both now and in the past, he suggested.

On Ukraine, Wood was willing to explode the Kremlin lie that no Russian troops 
were in the country. In fact, dozens of Russian servicemen were killed in the 
conflict, with their bodies surreptitiously returned for secret burial.

“Whereas the west honours and remembers its dead and injured, the Kremlin 
refuses to recognise their existence. This reveals Russia’s moral bankruptcy,” 
Wood wrote in 2015.

Friends say that Wood has been alarmed at what has happened in Russia since 
his departure. Under Putin, formal political opposition has disappeared and 
television has become an instrument of state propaganda.

Meanwhile critics of Putin – ones living abroad like Alexander Litvinenko, or 
at home like Boris Nemtsov – have been killed in murky circumstances. A public 
inquiry last year concluded that assassins sent by the FSB security service 
murdered Litvinenko with a radioactive cup of tea in London, in an operation 
“probably approved” personally by Russia’s president.

One former colleague said of Wood: “He’s a very respected senior diplomat. He 
was five years in Moscow. That says a lot for his reputation and his 
professional standing. He’s an outstanding analyst of developments in 
contemporary Russia.”

The colleague added: “He’s isn’t sort of black and white as you would expect, 
but takes a nuanced view. For a long time he’s been quite pessimistic about 
Russia’s trajectory under Putin. Wood doesn’t go in for hyperbole. He’s always 
analytical rather than polemical.”

Wood didn’t overlap in Moscow with Steele, who left the embassy in 1992. (Wood 
– previously ambassador in pre-war Yugoslavia – arrived in Russia in 1995.) But 
they got to know each other later: the world of old Moscow hands and 
London-based Kremlinologists is relatively small. Steele left MI6 and set up 
Orbis, his private business intelligence consultancy, in 2009.

“I didn’t work with him [Steele] in a professional capacity,” Wood told the 
Guardian.

John McCain passes dossier alleging secret Trump-Russia contacts to FBI

Like other Putin watchers, Wood has tracked Russian attempts to influence 
western countries. This includes the recent spectacular hacking of Democratic 
National Committee emails, but also encompasses the Kremlin’s covert support 
for the far-right inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and 
the anti-establishment far left. He is acutely aware that there’s not much new 
here. The KGB carried out similar operations in Soviet times. They had a name: 
“active measures”.

Wood told the Guardian it was Trump’s own erratic behaviour on the campaign 
trail that had raised questions about his links with Russia. Trump originally 
denied that Putin had anything to do with hacking – only to say at his press 
conference earlier this weekhe thought Moscow was indeed guilty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/11/donald-trump-media-cnn-buzzfeed-intelligence-agencies>
.

Confronted with serious hacking allegations, a presidential candidate would 
more usually call for a full inquiry, Wood said. Trump didn’t. “It colours the 
perception. Trump has encouraged the idea that there were meetings [between 
Trump aides and the Russian leadership],” Wood said, adding: “On the other 
hand, Trump says the first thing that comes into his head.”

The next few weeks will determine whether fears over Trump and Russia have 
been overblown, or whether they do indeed pose a threat to UK-US relations. One 
early test will be over sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration 
in 2014. Will Trump bin them – as expected? Or wait?

Wood will be watching keenly. He thinks the new president has awkward 
questions to answer. He told the Guardian that if he could ask him just one, it 
would be this: “I would want to know what the US policy will be towards Russia, 
and on what basis?”
