Right, that’s all from me. It’s been a blast. The result, by the way, means the
Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> table remains 
unchanged – Villa needed to win by three goals to overtake Barnsley, and QPR 
had to lose by two to drop below Cardiff – so as you were. Bye!

The match-winner speaks! Using Rudy Gestede as a translator!

We had to bounce back after we lost the last game, so it’s a good win today 
and a good feeling. We’re not fr away from the play-offs so we have to keep 
going. The next few games will be very important, so we have to stay strong.

And Mile Jedinak also speaks, without translation:

We’re a team. He’s [Kodjia] been getting them recently. Great to respond from 
that penalty miss. When he gets chances he puts them away, so he deserves all 
he gets. I think we let ourselves down the other night, but what a response 
today. We knew we would be up against it but we showed our quality, especially 
in that second half.

90+5 mins: With QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> searching for 
the equaliser Gestede finds himself in plenty of space when the ball is played 
up to him, turns and gets into the penalty area. It’s an excellent chance, but 
Smithies comes out quickly and well to save.

90+1 mins: The ball is lifted forward by QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>, and Mackie and Bunn race to reach 
it first. The goalkeeper wins it, just, and then goes down, partly because 
Mackie’s arm struck him in the chest, and partly because his side’s winning and 
there’s only a couple of minutes to go.

90 mins: I’m looking forward to seeing the fourth official hold up his fingers 
to indicate how much stoppage time to expect.

89 mins: Villa are bringing Ashley Westwood on now. This takes a while, 
because the fourth official has worked out that his board is broken, and nobody 
knows that a substitution is about to happen, or who is going off, until people 
start shouting and gesticulating. Anyway, Gardner’s gone off.

84 mins: Aston Villa’s second substitution sees Gestede come on for Kodjia. 
The fourth official raises his board to notify the audience of the change, but 
it isn’t working and no numbers come up. He doesn’t know that, though, because 
it’s over his head, so he proudly turns to display it to everybody.

82 mins: After Mackie’s cross from the left is headed away from goal the ball 
lands perfectly for Perch, on the edge of the area, but his low shot trundles 
harmlessly wide.

GOAL! QPR 0-1 Aston Villa (Kodjia, 75 mins)

The breakthrough! Kodjia gets the ball on the right, spins past Lynch, races 
into the penalty area and blasts low towards goal from an acute angle, the shot 
flying off Smithies’ left ankle and in at the far post!

74 mins: Bakuna passes infield to Garner, who has all sorts of space on the 
edge of the D. Nobody all game has had this much space within shooting range of 
goal. Gardner eventually shoots wide. And also high.

67 mins: Kodjia runs into the QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> 
penalty from the right, only for a perfectly-timed and really very enjoyable 
Grant Hall sliding tackle to stop him. The corner that results ends, 
eventually, with Kodjia attempting to scissor-kick Amavi’s wayward drive into 
goal. Given the speed at which the ball flew at him he did extremely well to do 
anything with it at all, and had little chance of directing it on target, and 
would probably have been given offside if he had. Still, an eye-catching effort.

63 mins: And Shodipo nearly scores with his first touch! It’s a cross from the 
left and it lands on his foot, 14 yards from goal, totally unmarked! Well, I 
say he nearly scored. He had a very fine opportunity to score. His shot, 
though, hit Nathan Baker.

Half time: QPR 0-0 Aston Villa

45+2 mins: The interval is upon us. An entertaining game without great moments 
of attacking class. The early Wszolek nearly-chance was probably the finest 
moment. The penalty decision was very generous, and it’s probably for the best, 
both for the game and the world in general, that it was saved. Overall it’s 
been fun, but the best is surely to come.

close  
Right, that’s all from me. It’s been a blast. The result, by the way, means the
Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> table remains 
unchanged – Villa needed to win by three goals to overtake Barnsley, and QPR 
had to lose by two to drop below Cardiff – so as you were. Bye!

The match-winner speaks! Using Rudy Gestede as a translator!

We had to bounce back after we lost the last game, so it’s a good win today 
and a good feeling. We’re not fr away from the play-offs so we have to keep 
going. The next few games will be very important, so we have to stay strong.

And Mile Jedinak also speaks, without translation:

We’re a team. He’s [Kodjia] been getting them recently. Great to respond from 
that penalty miss. When he gets chances he puts them away, so he deserves all 
he gets. I think we let ourselves down the other night, but what a response 
today. We knew we would be up against it but we showed our quality, especially 
in that second half.
 
90+6 mins: It’s over! A game of much bluster and few chances ends with a Villa 
victory!
 
90+5 mins: With QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> searching for 
the equaliser Gestede finds himself in plenty of space when the ball is played 
up to him, turns and gets into the penalty area. It’s an excellent chance, but 
Smithies comes out quickly and well to save.
 
90+3 mins: Grant Hall shanks a volley hilariously wide, and Bunn’s booked for 
timewasting as he takes an absolute age over his kick.
 
90+1 mins: The ball is lifted forward by QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>, and Mackie and Bunn race to reach 
it first. The goalkeeper wins it, just, and then goes down, partly because 
Mackie’s arm struck him in the chest, and partly because his side’s winning and 
there’s only a couple of minutes to go.
 
90+1 mins: We’re into stoppage time, and there’ll be at least five minutes of 
it. Sky, the spoilsports, fail to show us how this information was communicated.
 
90 mins: I’m looking forward to seeing the fourth official hold up his fingers 
to indicate how much stoppage time to expect.
 
89 mins: Villa are bringing Ashley Westwood on now. This takes a while, 
because the fourth official has worked out that his board is broken, and nobody 
knows that a substitution is about to happen, or who is going off, until people 
start shouting and gesticulating. Anyway, Gardner’s gone off.
 
87 mins: A chance for QPR! Shodipo works space on the right and crosses low, 
and Mackie controls, spins and shoots wide of the near post.
 
84 mins: Aston Villa’s second substitution sees Gestede come on for Kodjia. 
The fourth official raises his board to notify the audience of the change, but 
it isn’t working and no numbers come up. He doesn’t know that, though, because 
it’s over his head, so he proudly turns to display it to everybody.
 
82 mins: After Mackie’s cross from the left is headed away from goal the ball 
lands perfectly for Perch, on the edge of the area, but his low shot trundles 
harmlessly wide.
 
81 mins: Luongo gets frustrated, and then booked, after losing the ball on the 
right wing and then kicking the nearest opponent.
 
78 mins: QPR’s final change sees Jamie Mackie make his comeback, in place of 
Chery.
 
The breakthrough! Kodjia gets the ball on the right, spins past Lynch, races 
into the penalty area and blasts low towards goal from an acute angle, the shot 
flying off Smithies’ left ankle and in at the far post!

74 mins: Bakuna passes infield to Garner, who has all sorts of space on the 
edge of the D. Nobody all game has had this much space within shooting range of 
goal. Gardner eventually shoots wide. And also high.
 
71 mins: Villa make their first change, bringing Agbonlahor on for the 
peripheral McCormack.
 
67 mins: Kodjia runs into the QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> 
penalty from the right, only for a perfectly-timed and really very enjoyable 
Grant Hall sliding tackle to stop him. The corner that results ends, 
eventually, with Kodjia attempting to scissor-kick Amavi’s wayward drive into 
goal. Given the speed at which the ball flew at him he did extremely well to do 
anything with it at all, and had little chance of directing it on target, and 
would probably have been given offside if he had. Still, an eye-catching effort.
 
65 mins: The game has exited decent-start, made its way through got-promise 
and edged into needs-a-goal.
 
63 mins: And Shodipo nearly scores with his first touch! It’s a cross from the 
left and it lands on his foot, 14 yards from goal, totally unmarked! Well, I 
say he nearly scored. He had a very fine opportunity to score. His shot, 
though, hit Nathan Baker.
 
62 mins: Wszolek is coming off.
 
61 mins: Olamide Shodipo is readying himself on the touchline, about to become 
QPR’s second substitution.
 
59 mins: From the corner Grant Hall, marking Jedinak, almost rips the shirt 
from his opponent’s back in a sustained and very obvious act of aggressive 
tugging. It was a clear penalty, but not given.
 
58 mins: Ooooh! Again! This time Bakuna cuts in from the right, cuts back onto 
his right foot and then shoots low and hard across goal from the edge of the 
area, and Smithies tips wide again!
 
57 mins: Oooh! Kodjia gets away on the right from a throw-in, cuts inside, 
shoots into a wall of four defenders, chases down the rebound, turns, shoots 
again, and this time Smithies tips round the post!
 
52 mins: A glossary of disappointing deliveries from QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>, as first Wszolek’s low cross is 
cleared, then Chery’s high cross is overhit.
 
51 mins: And Chery’s free kick is bashed over everyone and straight out of 
play.
 
50 mins: Ngbakoto sprints infield from the left, and just as he was about to 
run straight into a couple of defenders he gets shoved in the back andQPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> have a free kick, 40 yards out.
 
46 mins: QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> pump the ball forward 
and Sylla with his fresh legs nearly gets onto it. But doesn’t.
 
46 mins: Peeeeep! The second half starts with a Villa kick-off.
 
Idrissa Sylla is the man coming on, and Conor Washington has stayed in the 
dressing room.
 
Nope, there’s a QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> substitution 
oncoming.
 
The players are coming back out, and it looks like the same bunch that started 
the game.
 
45+2 mins: The interval is upon us. An entertaining game without great moments 
of attacking class. The early Wszolek nearly-chance was probably the finest 
moment. The penalty decision was very generous, and it’s probably for the best, 
both for the game and the world in general, that it was saved. Overall it’s 
been fun, but the best is surely to come.
 
45+1 mins: Into stoppage time we roll, and there’ll be about two minutes of it.
