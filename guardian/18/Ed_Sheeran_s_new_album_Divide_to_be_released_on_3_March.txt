“Hello 2017! I’ve been working hard on the new material and I hope you can be 
as excited about it as I am,” Sheeran said. “I really wanted to show two 
different sides to my music that I’m equally as passionate about and I just 
knew I wanted to roll with two songs at the same time. I’m absolutely buzzing 
to be back.”

The Suffolk singer’s return follows a year of social media silence. During his 
online absence, he co-wrote Cold Water, a track released by Major Lazer, and 
Justin Bieber’s Love Yourself, both of which reached No 1 in the UK.

His 2014 album X topped charts on both sides of the Atlantic, achieving 3.4bn 
streams. Plus (+) his 2011 debut won him his first Ivor Novello award for The A 
Team, which went on to become that year’s biggest-selling debut single.

Novellos.
