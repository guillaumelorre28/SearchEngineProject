The most popular David Bowie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> 
album since the singer’s death on 10 January 2016 is Blackstar, according to 
the latest figures from the Official Charts Company. The compilers of the UK 
charts have put together top 10s for both Bowie’s album sales and singles sales 
over the last year, with Heroes topping the singles sales list.

Since his death, Bowie’s albums have managed combined sales of around 1.62m – 
including physical sales, downloads and streaming equivalents – while his 
singles have managed 1.87m combined sales. Heroes alone has been streamed 8.83m 
times since his death, and downloaded 50,000 times. It achieved its highest

It’s not surprising Blackstar should be the most popular Bowie album of the 
last year. It was released, to glowing reviews, on 8 January, just two days 
before he died, leadingfans to treat it almost as a puzzle

 offering clues about his life and work. However, it’s perhaps more telling 
that the next three albums on the Official Charts Company’s list were all 
compilations – Best of Bowie, Nothing Has Changed: The Very Best Of and Legacy. 
Only after them do his other original albums feature, with the list dominated 
by his 70s classics.

Blackstar proved to be the best selling album on vinyl in the UK in 2016, with 
54,000 copies. It was the sixth best selling album across all formats.

The list of bestselling songs is comprehensively dominated by older material. 
Lazarus – which appears on Blackstar, and also gave its name to the Bowie 
musical that opened in New York in 2015 and in London last year – features at 
No 9, but the second newest song in the top 10 is 1983’s Let’s Dance.
