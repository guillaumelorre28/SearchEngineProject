Archaeology A-level, along with art history (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/16/a-level-art-history-should-never-have-been-given-the-brush-off>
, 17 October) and many other arts and humanities-based subjects, has been 
completely removed as an option by the exam board AQA. This is a great blow for 
our education, arts and heritage sectors, and will have an impact on both 
university numbers and candidature for jobs in heritage, an area worth millions 
to Britain and supporting 113,000 direct and 157,000 indirect jobs. AQA itself 
has said that the subject is “one of the most exciting it offers”, whereas many 
professional archaeological units and academic departments have expressed 
disdain at the decision, stating that more archaeologists will be required in 
the future, due to large projects such as HS2 and situations such as Brexit. 
This country prides itself on variety and diversity of education. The removal 
of this popular, important and worthwhile qualification, among many others, is 
worthy of attention alongside the also regrettable removal of art history 
A-level. A petition to reinstate archaeology A-level can be foundhere
