Aidyn Rakhimbayev, a Kazakh multimillionaire, was roaring through the grass 
between a hill and a birch forest in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia when his 
highlycustomised

 Mini Countryman suddenly swerved off to the side with a popped tyre, setting 
the grass underneath on fire. A minute later, Harry Hunt, a British driver, 
careened around the hill from the other side, scattering surprised picnickers 
and onlookers, before making it back on to the trail carved by other racers.

Longer than even the Dakar rally, just finishing the Silk Way rally from 
Moscow to Beijing is a feat. From 9 to 24 July, competitors are racing 6,695 
miles across the forests and grasslands of Russia, the dusty steppe ofKazakhstan
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/kazakhstan>, and what drivers call the 
“dunes of no return” in the deserts of northern China.

“They say the rally is won not by the one who goes fast but by the one who 
doesn’t break down,” said the Silk Way director, Vladimir Chagin, nicknamed the 
“Tsar of Dakar” for winning that rally’s truck category seven times. “It’s an 
extreme sport stretched out over time, over two weeks, not a jump or flight 
that lasts minutes or seconds.”

This year’s Silk Way rally is also a geopolitical achievement, strengthening 
Russia’spolitical and economic relations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/friends-forever-xi-talks-up-chinas-ties-with-russia-during-putin-trade-trip>
 with its eastern neighbour. Having previously held the event in Russia, 
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, Chagin said the idea to head east was “rooted in 
how the mutual relations of Russia and China are developing”. The rally is 
sponsored by the Russian state gas giant Gazprom and the Chinese state car 
manufacturer BAIC.

Modern rally racing of this kind began with the inaugural Paris-Dakar rally 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2015/jan/09/memory-lane-paris-dakar-rally-in-pictures>
 through the Sahara desert in 1979, an event that became legendary for its 
brutal terrain and infamous for dozens of fatalities and close calls, such as 
the six-day search for competitor Mark Thatcher, son of Margaret, in 1982. But 
the Dakar rally lost some of its lustre for drivers after a move to South 
America in 2009. This year’s Silk Way has managed to attract competitors from 
40 countries with its less-travelled terrain and an entry fee starting at €6000 
(£5000), less than half of Dakar’s.

“The stages so far haven’t been quite as tricky as Dakar but I think as we 
cross over intoChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> they’ll get more 
difficult,” said Hunt, 27, the son of a real estate magnate, who finished 10th 
at Dakar this year.

The rally tests physical stamina and logistics planning just as much as 
driving skill. John Purshouse, the owner of a car parts recycling business in 
Perth, Australia, who is paying his own way, nearly missed the race after the 
shipping container carrying his modified Ford Ranger T1 mistakenly arrived in 
Italy rather thanRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>. After 
receiving the truck in Moscow at 2.30am on the start day, he drove to Kazan and 
spent the next night replacing the fuel cell.

“You get in and you’re tired but you just have to push through,” said Adrian 
Di Lallo, another Australian driver. “A lot of us only get to do this a few 
times a year. It’s like a drug, except you can go to rehab for drugs.”

 crewed by two Chinese drivers and a Russian mechanic. The side of the truck is 
emblazoned with the two countries’ flags and the words “one belt, one road” – 
the name of the Chinese president Xi Jinping’s initiative to develop 
infrastructure, trade and political and humanitarian ties with Eurasian 
countries.

Russia’s pivot to Asia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/china-russia-superpower-axis>, 
which was announced by Vladimir Putin in 2012 and strengthened by a $400bn 
(£240bn)gas deal in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/21/russia-30-year-400bn-gas-deal-china>
, has not attracted as much Chinese investment to Russia as hoped. But the two 
countries have found common ground politically, most recently with their 
vehement opposition to aUS agreement with South Korea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/08/south-korea-and-us-agree-to-deploy-thaad-missile-defence-system>
 this month to install an advanced missile defence system there.

Yang Shuan, the deputy head of China’s general administration of sports, said 
the rally would “create a sustainable bridge of friendship between Russia and 
China”, and Russia’s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, promised it would 
strengthen humanitarian ties with its neighbour.

“Like China, Russia is a big country in the political and territorial sense,” 
said the Gazprom driver Hongning Hou. “China has friendly relations with Russia 
and we want to get closer.”
