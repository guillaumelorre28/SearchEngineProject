Human Rights Watch has condemned the Home Office for its “non-transparent and 
arbitrary” process for transferring unaccompanied child refugees to the UK.

In a scathing attack, the campaign group said the process was so 
ill-considered that the government had ended up separating siblings, in breach 
of theDubs amendment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp>
 to immigration laws, which pledged to give some unaccompanied children refuge 
in Britain.

In the case of two boys from Ethiopia, a 12-year-old was transferred to the UK 
while his 15-year-old brother was left behind.

In another case, Human Rights Watch said a boy and his half-sister were 
separated when the girl was reunited with an uncle, but the boy was not because 
he was not directly related to the adult.

The group based its criticism on interviews with 41 unaccompanied child 
refugees from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Syria and Afghanistan in reception 
centres in France.

The interviews took place between 5 and 16 December, the period directly 
before and afterthe Home Office announced on 9 December that it had stopped 
transfers from France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/09/home-office-transfers-of-calais-child-refugees-to-uk-cease>
.

Human Rights Watch said children were being left in the dark on the process, 
leading to psychological distress and, in two cases, suicidal thoughts.

It said: “Children said they did not have information about how and when they 
would learn the outcome in their cases, the selection criteria, what recourse, 
if any, they have if they are not accepted, and how they could follow up with 
the UK Home Office.

“Several said they were so upset that they could not sleep or eat, and two 
said they thought of taking their own lives. A 17-year-old boy who had been 
detained in his home country, Ethiopia, and inLibya 
<https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/libya> en route to France, said that 
he was desperate to join his aunt in the UK,” it said. The charity said the boy 
told them: “‘I am very lonely here … I am going to kill myself [if I cannot 
go].’”

The group concluded that the transfer process for children lacked transparency 
and was arbitrary, hurting children’s mental health.

The findings echo those of other charities, including Help Refugees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/09/help-refugees-we-will-never-abandon-them>
, Safe Passage and Social Workers without Borders, who have said both the 
French and British governments were breaching children’s rights by not having a 
care plan for each child, as they would for a homeless British or French child.

Minors being monitored by Social Workers without Borders in a reception centre 
in Taizé, near the Swiss border,have been refusing to eat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/calais-child-refugees-on-partial-hunger-strike-after-transfers-to-uk-stop>
 because of the lack of information from the Home Office.

Other volunteers working in Bruniquel, in the south of France, said two 
children who had refused to eat had been taken to hospital. They have since 
been returned to the reception centre.

in the south-western French town of Biscarrosse, a group of Sudanese children 
demonstrated 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/19/sudanese-children-stage-protest-in-france-as-uk-rejects-asylum-claims>
 this week to show their anger at having their applications rejected without 
explanation.

About 2,000 children were dispersed across France from the Calais 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais> camp at the end of October, all of 
whom expected that they would be eligible for transfer to the UK under the Dubs 
amendment or the Dublin regulation.

The Dublin law allows unaccompanied minors who have family in another EU 
country to have their asylum considered in that country.

The Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act allows the government to consider 
unaccompanied children who have no family for asylum in the UK.

Human Rights Watch said it had found minors who appeared to qualify under the 
regulation – including a 16-year-old boy who has an uncle, aunt, and 
grandparents in the UK – still in France.

It said the Home Office transfer criteria to implement the Dubs amendment were 
too strict and did not comply with its spirit.

Last month, the Home Office was criticised  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/16/home-office-block-on-afghan-and-eritrean-teen-refugees-a-disgrace>
 after it announced new Dubs criteria that would stop many Eritrean, Afghan and 
Yemeni teenagers aged 13 or 14 from getting sanctuary in the UK.

The new guidelines, issued to charities two weeks after the Calais camp was 
cleared 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/15/migrant-teenagers-without-family-in-uk-barred-except-syrians-and-sudanese>
, in effect barred those teenagers regardless of why they had left their home 
countries.

The guidance said it would take under-13s of all nationalities, those deemed 
at high risk of sexual exploitation, and those who “are aged 15 or under and 
are of Sudanese or Syrian nationality” because people from those countries are 
already granted asylum in the UK in 75% of cases.

Human Rights Watch said the Dubs criteria did not appear to have been 
correctly followed in all cases, including the separation of older siblings 
from younger ones who do qualify.

It called for the Home Office to broaden its selection criteria and reminded 
it that the Dubs amendment was “intended as a humanitarian measure”.

It also criticised the French government for abandoning normal safeguarding 
rules for children in the reception centres.

It said that the children were being looked after “outside the regular child 
protection service” and that the children in the reception centres “have not 
had access to asylum procedures or the regular child protection system in 
France”. The Home Office has been contacted for comment.
