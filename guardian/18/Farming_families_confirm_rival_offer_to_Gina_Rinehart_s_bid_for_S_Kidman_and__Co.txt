 and her Chinese partner Shanghai CRED.

Tom Brinkworth, Sterling Buntine, Malcolm Harris and Viv Oldfield have said 
under their offer, Kidman would stay wholly Australian owned, the sale would 
not require approval from the foreign investment review board, and they would 
triple the size of the cattle herd marketed under the Kidman name.

“The four families comprising the consortium are deeply committed to honouring 
and preserving the Kidman heritage and brand which will continue under the 
stewardship of highly regarded and successful Australian graziers,” Buntine 
said in a statement on Sunday.

The BBHO consortium is seeking acquire 100% of the S Kidman and Co shares.

Earlier this month Rinehart lodged a $365m Australian-majority bid for 67% S 
Kidman and Co, with Chinese-owned Shanghai CRED to hold the other third.

That bid still needs to go before the before the Foreign Investment Review 
Board, because there is a minority foreign investor.

S Kidman and Co, founded in 1899, is Australia’s largest private landholder 
with properties covering 101,000 square kilometres across three states and the 
Northern Territory.

Under the BBHO bid, an Adelaide office would be maintained and the Tungali 
feedlot would be retained.

Crossbench senator Nick Xenophon last week welcomed news of the bid and urged 
other politicians to get behind it.

“It’s important the prime minister makes it clear that the national interest 
would be served by having a 100% fair dinkum Australian bid for S Kidman & Co,” 
he said.
