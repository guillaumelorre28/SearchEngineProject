A full act of parliament – rather than merely a motion – would be required to 
give ministers authorisation to trigger Brexit, the supreme court has been told.

Concluding his arguments to the court, Lord Pannick QC, who represents the 
lead claimant, Gina Miller, said legislation by both houses of parliament would 
be needed before the government could formally give notification of the UK’s 
intention to leave theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

“Only an act of parliament can lawfully confer power on the [government] to 
give notification under article 50 [of the treaty on European Union],” Pannick 
said. “The law is not altered by a motion in parliament. A motion in parliament 
cannot effect the legal issue in this case.”

On Tuesday the government’s QC, James Eadie, had indicated that any bill put 
before parliament would only contain a “one-line” statement

Pannick ran into stronger judicial resistance on Wednesday

 when he began to assess the legal significance of the 2015 referendum 
legislation in terms of whether it gave the government new powers.
Article 50: what did the high court rule?

“It would be a bit surprising if the referendum act and the referendum had no 
effect in law,” Lord Neuberger, the president of the supreme court, suggested. 
The act may have been enough for the government to say it had ceded power to 
the people, he added.

But Pannick replied: “The 2015 act is entirely neutral on the issue before 
this court: whether or not a minister has the power to notify [Brussels that 
the UK intends to leave the EU].”

Dominic Chambers QC, who represents Deir Dos Santos, the second main claimant, 
told the court’s 11 justices that if Theresa May triggered Brexit without 
proper parliamentary approval she would be acting “unlawfully”.

“Parliament is supreme,” Chambers said. “No person or body can override or 
nullify legislation. These EU law rights [acquired through the 1972 European 
Communities Act] are enshrined in parliamentary legislation.

“By triggering article 50 these statutory rights will be nullified and 
overridden. The absence of parliamentary authorisation for the executive to 
override primary legislation ... will be contrary to the doctrine of 
parliamentary sovereignty and therefore it will be acting unlawfully.”

Chambers said that the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty was “forged on 
the battlefields of the 17th century in the [English civil war] between crown 
and parliament”.

Parliament’s victory and sovereignty was finally enacted in the bill of rights 
which, Chambers reminded the justices, declared that “suspension of 
[parliamentary] powers without authority is illegal”.

The hearing continues.
