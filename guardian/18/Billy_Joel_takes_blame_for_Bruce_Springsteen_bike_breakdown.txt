There could be no worse fate for a broken hero on a last-chance powerdrive 
than to break down at the side of the road. But that is exactly what happened to
Bruce Springsteen <https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen> recently. And 
now a fellow blue-collar rocker from the tri-state area has stepped forward to 
take the blame for Bruce Springsteen’s motorcycle mishap.

Earlier in November, Springsteen was stranded by the side of the road in New 
Jersey

 when he was rescued by a group of bikers from the Freehold American Legion who 
took him to a local bar until he could be picked up.

On Monday, Billy Joel <https://www.theguardian.com/music/billy-joel> told an 
audience in New York that he had built the bike Springsteen had been riding. 
Joel put the machine together at 20th Century Cycles, the “motorcycle gallery” 
he owns in Oyster Bay, Long Island. The gallery displays Joel’s collection of 
around 60 vintage bikes.

Joel played Born to Run during his show at Madison Square Garden in New York 
on Monday, then told the crowd he had called Springsteen to apologise for the 
motorcycle mishap. “No worries,” Springsteen replied.

Joel is currently in the midst of Madison Square Garden residency that has 
been running since January 2014 – he has sworn to play there every month until 
there is no longer demand. He recently announced his 38th show of the 
residency, taking place on 22 February 2017.
