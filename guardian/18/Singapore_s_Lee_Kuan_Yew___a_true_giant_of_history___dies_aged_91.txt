Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who led the city-state for more 
than three decades, has died aged 91.

Lee’s son and current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, announced the news in 
the early hours of Monday morning local time, prompting a flurry of tributes 
from world leaders.

The US president, Barack Obama, called Lee a “true giant of history” while the 
UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called him a “legendary figure in Asia” and 
China’s president, Xi Jinping, praised Lee as an “old friend of the Chinese 
people”.

Lee’s son struggled to hold back tears when he made a televised address to the 
country, saying Lee had built a nation and given Singaporeans a proud identity.


Speaking in Malay, Mandarin and English, the prime minister said: “We won’t 
see another man like him. To many Singaporeans, and indeed others too, Lee Kuan 
Yew wasSingapore <https://www.theguardian.com/world/singapore>,” he said.

Lee Hsien Loong said that his father would lie in state from 25-28 March at 
Parliament House so the public could pay their respects, with the funeral on 29 
March.


He has declared a period of national mourning from 23-29 March, with flags on 
government buildings at half mast until Sunday.

The People’s Action party (PAP) – the party Lee led to electoral victory in 
1959 and which has governed Singapore since – set up a tribute website

Hong Lim park, which includes speakers’ corner – the only place where 
Singaporeans are allowed to hold protests without a permit – has had its status 
as an “unrestricted area” revoked and been designated as a site to remember 
Lee. The national parks authoritysaid it would not be accepting any 
applications for permits to use the park 
<https://www.nparks.gov.sg/speakers-corner-registration-form> during the period.

Lee, a Cambridge-educated lawyer, is widely credited with building Singapore 
into one of the world’s wealthiest nations on a per capita basis with a strong, 
pervasive role for the state and little patience for dissent.


He co-founded the PAP and led the newly born country when it was separated 
from Malaysia in 1965.


He stepped down as prime minister in 1990, handing power to Goh Chok Tong, but 
remained influential as senior minister in Goh’s cabinet and subsequently as 
“minister mentor” when Lee Hsien Loong became prime minister in 2004.


The older Lee left the cabinet in 2011 and cut down his public appearances in 
recent months due to his age and declining health. Lee was admitted to 
Singapore general hospital on 5 February for severe pneumonia and was later put 
on life support.

Lee was feared for his authoritarian tactics but insisted that strict limits 
on speech and public protest were necessary to maintain stability in the 
multi-ethnic and multireligious country.

Maligah Thangavello, 55, and Dorai Josephine, 57, who are both healthcare 
assistants at Singapore general hospital, heard the news when they got on the 
bus on their way to work.


“We treat him like our father,” said Maligah in tears. “When I was 10, he came 
to my school and shook hands with all of us.”
“He is far away from us now,” said Dorai Josephine. “He was like a king, the 
king of Singapore. He did the best for Singapore.”

Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at New York-based Human Rights Watch, 
said Lee’s “tremendous” role in Singapore’s economic development was beyond 
doubt. “But it also came at a significant cost for human rights, and today’s 
restricted freedom of expression, self-censorship and stunted multiparty 
democracy,” he said.

Lee Kuan Yew is gone. Where does Singapore go now?

There were also dissenting voices in Singapore. “This man has put in certain 
structures which are certainly illiberal, anti-democratic, and his passing does 
not mean that they no longer survive,” said blogger Alex Au. “Effort is still 
needed to dismantle them.”

In a White House statement, Obama said that he appreciated Lee’s wisdom, 
including during discussions they held on his trip to Singapore in 2009 when he 
was formulating his Asia-Pacific policy.


“He was a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come 
as the father of modern Singapore and as one the great strategists of Asian 
affairs,” Obama said.


Xi said Lee, who was ethnically Chinese, was “widely respected by the 
international community as a strategist and a statesman” and expressed “sincere 
condolences” to his relatives.

Lee met China’s leaders multiple times and his model of political control 
allied to economic growth was seen as an example to China’s Communist party as 
it embarked on reforms.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, said: “Lady Thatcher once said that 
there was no prime minister she admired more than Mr Lee for ‘the strength of 
his convictions, the clarity of his views, the directness of his speech and his 
vision of the way ahead’. His place in history is assured, as a leader and as 
one of the modern world’s foremost statesmen.”

The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, also paid tribute to Lee. “The 
passing of a giant like Lee Kuan Yew is the end of an era,” Bishop told Sky 
News.

The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called Lee “a great Asian leader who 
laid the foundation for the prosperity of Singapore today”.

In a letter of condolence

 to Lee’s son, Singapore’s president, Tony Tan, said: “Mr Lee dedicated his 
entire life to Singapore from his first position as a legal advisor to the 
labour unions in the 1950s after his graduation from Cambridge University to 
his undisputed role as the architect of our modern Republic. Few have 
demonstrated such complete commitment to a cause greater than themselves.”
