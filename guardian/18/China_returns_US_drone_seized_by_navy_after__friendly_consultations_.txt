consultations.”

In a statement issued late on Monday, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said 
the Chinese navy vessel that had seized the drone returned it close to where it 
had been taken from. The incident occurred in theSouth China Sea

The USS Mustin received the vehicle for the US in international waters about 
50 miles northwest of Subic Bay, according to Cook.

Cook said the US would continue to investigate the incident. Earlier on Monday 
he had said US and Chinese officials, including military leaders, were working 
out logistical details for the return.


The US said the drone was being operated by civilian contractors collecting 
unclassified scientific data in international waters “in full compliance with 
international law”. Officials said a noncombat ship was recovering two drones 
when a Chinese ship approached, launched a small boat andpicked up one of them

.

“This incident was inconsistent with both international law and standards of 
professionalism for conduct between navies at sea,”the statement by Cook

 said.

The return of the drone came hours after US president-elect tweeted saying the 
Chinese should keep it.

Relations between China and the US are tense following Trump’s phone call with 
the president of Taiwan earlier this month, which sparked a diplomatic incident 
and broke with almost four decades of US foreign policy.

Trump then used a Fox News interview to question US “one China” policy on 
Taiwan

, a breakaway island state which is not recognised by Beijing.

His outbursts prompted Barack Obama to caution Trump against allowing 
relations with China to slip into “full conflict mode
