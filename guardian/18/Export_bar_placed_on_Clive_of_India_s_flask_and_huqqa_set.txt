A spectacular gem-encrusted jade and gold flask presented to Clive of India 
after his victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 has had a temporary export 
bar placed on it by the British government.

Experts advising ministers say there is no other object like it anywhere in 
the world, let alone in Britain.

Currently on loan to the V&A <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/v-and-a>
, the flask will go overseas unless a museum or individual can match the asking 
price of £6m. Also at risk of leaving the UK is Clive of India’s huqqa set, 
which has a bar placed on it with an asking price of £240,000.

The digital and culture minister, Matthew Hancock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matthew-hancock>, said: “These treasures 
are not only exquisite, they provide us with a glimpse into the fascinating 
lifestyle and traditions of the Mughal court and the British presence in India 
at the time. I hope that we are able to keep these unique artefacts in the 
country to learn more about this extraordinary history.”

It is believed that Robert Clive, the British governor, was presented with the 
flask after the victory over the Nawab of Bengal at Plassey. The emerald and 
ruby decorated flask, about 25cm high, had been looted from the Mughal emperor 
Muhammad Shah by the Persian monarch Nadir Shah in 1739.

Less is known about how Clive acquired the sapphire and ruby huqqa smoking 
set, although the likelihood is that he helped himself to it.

Smoking was widespread in India at the time and had become popular among the 
British living there, who often commissioned paintings of themselves reclining 
against brocade-covered bolsters on a terrace.

The decision to defer export licences was made on the recommendation of an 
expert committee, theReviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and 
Objects of Cultural Interest

The objects shine light on a historically important but loathed figure. The 
East India Company 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/04/east-india-company-original-corporate-raiders>
 was responsible for the subjugation and plunder of vast tracts of south Asia. 
It was led in India by Clive, a man described by the historianWilliam Dalrymple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamdalrymple> as “an unstable 
sociopath”.

When Clive returned to Britain he had amassed a personal fortune valued at 
£234,000, making him the richest self-made man in Europe. Not that it gave him 
unalloyed pleasure. He was addicted to opium, suffered bouts of depression and 
committed suicide aged 49.

The chairman of the RCEWA, Sir Hayden Phillips, said: “Apart from the 
intrinsic quality of these objects, and their outstanding importance for 
scholarship, the reviewing committee was unanimous in its recognition of their 
emblematic significance for our history and national life. Robert Clive was an 
outstanding and, indeed, controversial figure, but absolutely central to the 
creation of British rule in India.”

The flask had been on loan to the V&A for about 40 years when it and other 
Clive items were sold at auction by his descendants in 2004. The buyer was the 
Qatari Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed bin Ali al-Thani, a man considered one of the 
world’s biggest art buyers untilhis death in London in 2014 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30001716>.

A similar export bar was placed on the Clive items in 2004, which resulted in 
an application to take them overseas withdrawn. The current decision on the 
flask’s export licence has been deferred until May and that could be extended 
until November if a serious potential buyer were to come forward.
