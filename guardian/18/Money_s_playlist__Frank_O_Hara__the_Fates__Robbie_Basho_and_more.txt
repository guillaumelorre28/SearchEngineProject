Frank O’Hara – Having a Coke With You 

More and more people are becoming aware of this Frank O’Hara  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/09/selected-poems-frank-ohara-review>
classic. I hear people talking about him when the fearful topic of poetry 
arises. I have a great belief that poetry should not be talked about. It is 
something too sacred to be ruined by conversation. I think, like a god, it 
should be prayed over in private. The Americans had a very enviable ability 
during the last century to reinvent themselves and make great leaps of 
modernism in the arts. The reasons for this are probably pretty obvious. But 
this new conversational and direct style of writing did away with old-fashioned 
romantic language and high sentiment. Everyone was now a poet. It was the 
culmination of Whitman, Céline and Robert Lowell and would lead the way for
Bukowski 
<http://milan-poetry.blogspot.co.uk/2007/03/laughing-heart-charles-bukowski.html>
 to rear his dirty head. Writing like this was tantamount to a revolutionary 
act.Jack Kerouac <https://www.theguardian.com/books/jackkerouac> famously 
heckled O’Hara during one of his readings shouting: “You’re killing poetry, 
O’Hara.” To which Frank replied: “Well, that’s more than you’ve ever done.” 
Thank God he had the guts to slay the beast once and for all.

Dave Bixby – Drug Song 

I’ve spent my life searching for these strange marginal figures in art. In 
writing I foundBruno Schulz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/dec/03/brief-survey-short-story-bruno-schulz>
, Céline,Russell H Greenan 
<http://www.laweekly.com/arts/russell-greenans-genius-2136461> and Alasdair Gray
 <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alasdairgray>. And this song by Dave Bixby 
is another example of an artist writing completely on their own terms. That odd 
sound and simplicity and immediate individuality in a great song.

Robbie Basho – Orphan’s Lament 

After months of heavy drinking, I heard this at the flat of a friend late one 
night in Manchester. I lay there completely engrossed in the sound this man 
could make and it brought tears to my eyes. Utter beauty captured in a song. 
The recordVisions of the Country 
<http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18390-robbie-basho-visions-of-the-country/>
 is a masterpiece – a word I have never used until now. And though this track 
is its “pop song” – ha ha! – it doesn’t really epitomise a body of work that 
takes folk music to new heights. Basho attempts to mimic his love of the 
natural splendour of America by always moving – a constant stream of expression 
like watching someone perform a godly or mythic act – with a guitar! (Also 
listen toRocky Mountain Raga <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA2uHQ9XBI8>.)

Otis Spann – Aint Nobody’s Business

Probably the greatest vocal delivery I’ve ever heard. Music made with such 
effortlessness. Great lyrics too – “If I go crazy, buy a shotgun and kill my 
baby / it ain’t nobody’s business if I do.”
