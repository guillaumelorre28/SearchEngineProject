The tv tower in Prague 3 is not the most beautiful structure in the city, 
that's for sure. Locals called it the Prague penis at one time. Now, it's just 
part of the scenery.

To the left of the pub was a rather splendid church until Tesco knocked it 
down (of course they moved out to the edge of town in the 80s). The building on 
the right is now a charity shop.

Marischal Square 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/573da21be4b04a0378340f90/2038027>

Aberdeen residents rejoiced when the Brutalist abomination that was St 
Nicholas House was demolished. Any celebrations were short lived however as 
plans were soon revealed for a replacement development: Marischal Square. Once 
again tiny Provost Skene's House - a 4 star historic attraction dating from 
1545 - would be swallowed up by a concrete, steel and glass behemoth. As seen 
in the image construction is now well underway, and unobstructed views of the 
medieval building are once again a thing of the past.

What happens in New York when you sell your air rights. 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/573da21be4b04a0378340f90/2034641>

Landlords sell the air rights above their buildings and developers of 
adjoining plots usually use these rights to build higher. In this case the 
developer literally built above the older buildings. Taken 2014 by Barry Miles.
