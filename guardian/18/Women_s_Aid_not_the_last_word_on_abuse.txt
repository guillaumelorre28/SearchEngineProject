The hyperbole surrounding the issue of victims facing abusers in the family 
courts is a little unbalanced (Minister acts to halt abuse in family court 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/04/truss-orders-review-to-ban-abusers-tormenting-victims-in-family-courts>
, 5 December). Adopting the language of Women’s Aid, you refer to “abusers” and 
“victims” as though men had already been tried and convicted in court. False, 
or exaggerated, allegations of domestic violence are not unusual and, in my 
experience as a child contact centre volunteer, lead to fathers feeling 
powerless and alone in the criminal justice system.

I am aware of stories of men being arrested on a Friday on false charges made 
by their ex-partners, resulting in them spending the weekend in custody, only 
to be released when no evidence is forthcoming. This seems designed to disrupt 
the father’s time with his children at the weekend. I would recommend thePink 
Tape blog <http://www.pinktape.co.uk/> by Lucy Reed, who practises as a 
barrister in the family court and who questions how frequently the problem 
identified by Women’s Aid occurs.

Women’s Aid is a pressure group with careers to advance and mortgages to pay. 
It isn’t an agency of the state and theirs is not always the last word – or 
even the best word – on domestic violence. I echo Lucy Reed’s caution that “I 
am asking for us to move forward on the basis of proper, balanced evidence 
rather than on the basis of who shouts loudest”.
