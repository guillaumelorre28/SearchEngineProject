The last word goes to Mads Pihl, who is talking actual truth

“Now that everyone will be talking about Kane and All in the buildup to that 
fourth goal (and rightly so), I guess the presence of Eriksen is looking more 
and more like that of Iniesta’s at Barcelona in terms of importance for 
fluidity of play. They are probably two teams at different levels, and Eriksen 
is not at Iniesta’s level, but for every season that passes the Dane is 
exerting more of the same kind of consistent brilliance for his team as Iniesta 
started doing in his mid-early 20s. And yes, I am biased by my nationality. But 
still.”

Full time: Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 West Brom

Peep peep! Spurs go up to second in the table Harry Kane celebrated the birth 
of his first child with a hat-trick yet the abiding memory will be of an almost 
flawless team performance in which they constantly displayed technical 
excellence at breakneck speed. All right-thinking neutrals should want Spurs to 
win thePremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>, 
because they are just so impressive. Thanks for your company; bye.
 Harry Kane goes home with the match ball which will make a nice present for

90+1 min Son replaces Kane. On reflection, I’m not sure he did mishit that 
volley for the third goal - the replays suggest he deliberately guided it 
across Foster, which makes it an even better goal. Alli’s part, almost 
Bergkamp-like, was the best bit though.

90 min With the exception of a couple of touches from Yacob and McClean, Spurs 
have had the ball for almost five minutes, a nice bit of ole football to end a 
very happy day.

teams: they have scored four in three of their last four league games, and 24 
in their last eight.

84 min “Mine and your favourite disallowed goal is undoubtedly this one,” says 
Adam Hirst, “due to the import of it.”

That definitely wins best disallowed goal celebration, too. What a bloody 
perfect game of football that was. Wish somebody would write a book about that 
rivalry.

GOAL! Tottenham 4-0 West Brom (Kane 82)

Oh yes yes yes. Harry Kane completes his hat-trick with a goal of 
spine-tingling brilliance. Kane dummies to shoot 25 yards out and plays a short 
pass to Alli. He is surrounded by defenders on the edge of the box, so scoops 
the ball over all of them to allow to Kane to run on and bobble a volley across 
Foster and into the far corner. He probably mishit the finish but the 
combination, and especially Alli’s scoop, was magical.

GOAL! Tottenham 3-0 West Brom (Kane 77)

This is a quietly brilliant goal. McAuley dithers by the corner flag and is 
robbed by the utterly bloody relentless Walker. He looks up and hits a 
deliberately fierce pass back towards Kane, hit with enough pace to beat Yacob 
at the near post. It bounces up awkwardly for Kane, who contorts his body like 
a piece of Playdoh to hit an acrobatic shot into the net from 15 yards. As Alan 
Smith says on Sky, he made it look far easier than it was. It wasn’t in the 
same class, but the way he twisted his body was reminiscent of that great 
Dimitar Berbatov goal for Spurs at Middlesbrough. Walker’s pass was also 
terrific: not only did he only have Kane to aim for, but he had to really whack 
the ball to ensure it would not be intercepted by Yacob.

ball to score his second, and Spurs’ third. Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters

75 min West Brom get a set piece on the halfway line. It’s lumped forward and 
bounces up for Robson-Kanu, who mishits his shot from 17 yards. That, such as 
it was, was West Brom’s best chance of the match.

73 min West Brom had a bit of an optimistic spurt at the start of the second 
half, but aside from those 12 seconds  five minutes the win has looked safe for 
Spurs. Their only regrets will be the injury to Vertonghen, which looked 
serious, and that the scoreline does not better reflect a supreme display of 
teamwork.

72 min If the FA are in a bad mood on Monday, Walker might get a three-match 
ban for that kick at McAuley. There was nothing in it really, but technically 
speaking he kicked him off the ball, and the laws of the game don’t encourage 
that.

63 min This looks like a nasty injury to Vertonghen. He stretched to keep a 
ball in play and landed awkwardly on his ankle. That doesn’t look good. He has 
his fingers to his eyes, pressing them against the top of his nose, and looks 
in a lot of pain.

cosh for an entire game, go two goals down, but manage to scrape a draw with a 
late penalty and well worked set piece, it’s West Brom.”

58 min Foster makes his 471st save of the game, plunging to his left to push 
away Kane’s low curler. It was a relatively comfortable save for a keeper of 
his class, but still: Spurs are on it once more.

56 min Walker’s scissor kick is blocked by Olsson and goes behind for a corner 
on the right. Eriksen plays Anderton to Kane’s Sheringham with a near-post 
cut-back, but Kane mishits his first-time shot. It comes to Alderweireld, whose 
shot is well saved by Foster, and then to Alderweireld, whose long-range 
follow-up is equally well saved.

54 min Alli stretches to control Alderweireld’s long pass and is eased over in 
the area by Dawson. Spurs wanted a penalty; Anthony Taylor disagreed. I think 
he made the right decision, though you can see both sides.

51 min West Brom have been the better team in this half. They’ve switched to a

46 min Peep peep! Spurs begin the second half. If you are watching on

low shot through the legs of Alderweireld and just wide of the post.

Half-time chit-chat

“It’s men against boys,” says Alex Ritchie, “and the Spurs boys are stuffing 
them.”

“Hi Rob,” says Shaun Wilkinson. “Regarding your comment about West Brom having 
the best defence outside of the big six; surely they have a better defence than 
at least one of the big six, and possibly two? The naked stats might not say 
so, but when you think about how much of the ball bigger teams have compared to 
them...”
(Yes, fair point. I just lazily think in terms of BS and NBS when appraising 
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> teams 
mid-MBM.)

“Afternoon Rob,” says Steve Finkel. “Best offside goal has to go to this 
effort from Nani <https://youtu.be/VOdYpz3fQyQ>. Ronaldo’s reaction is 
priceless, entirely justified and probably sums up he feels about Nani.”


 “It seems that Spurs’ footballers are the lowest paid of the big six or the 
current top six. or six,” says Ian Copestake. “This is why you like Spurs so 
much. They are the underpaid women of football fighting for equal pay with 
their male equals. Burn your bra, brother Rob.”

lead. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.

Harry Kane hat-trick leads Tottenham’s brilliant thumping of West Brom
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/14/tottenham-hotspur-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report> 
The last word goes to Mads Pihl, who is talking actual truth

“Now that everyone will be talking about Kane and All in the buildup to that 
fourth goal (and rightly so), I guess the presence of Eriksen is looking more 
and more like that of Iniesta’s at Barcelona in terms of importance for 
fluidity of play. They are probably two teams at different levels, and Eriksen 
is not at Iniesta’s level, but for every season that passes the Dane is 
exerting more of the same kind of consistent brilliance for his team as Iniesta 
started doing in his mid-early 20s. And yes, I am biased by my nationality. But 
still.”

 
Peep peep! Spurs go up to second in the table Harry Kane celebrated the birth 
of his first child with a hat-trick yet the abiding memory will be of an almost 
flawless team performance in which they constantly displayed technical 
excellence at breakneck speed. All right-thinking neutrals should want Spurs to 
win thePremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>, 
because they are just so impressive. Thanks for your company; bye.
 Harry Kane goes home with the match ball which will make a nice present for 
his newborn daughter Ivy Jane Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP  
90+1 min Son replaces Kane. On reflection, I’m not sure he did mishit that 
volley for the third goal - the replays suggest he deliberately guided it 
across Foster, which makes it an even better goal. Alli’s part, almost 
Bergkamp-like, was the best bit though.
 
90 min With the exception of a couple of touches from Yacob and McClean, Spurs 
have had the ball for almost five minutes, a nice bit of ole football to end a 
very happy day.
 
85 min Ruthlessness has been an issue for Spurs but they are learning to stuff 
teams: they have scored four in three of their last four league games, and 24 
in their last eight.
 
84 min “Mine and your favourite disallowed goal is undoubtedly this one,” says 
Adam Hirst, “due to the import of it.”

That definitely wins best disallowed goal celebration, too. What a bloody 
perfect game of football that was. Wish somebody would write a book about that 
rivalry.
 
83 min Harry Winks replaces Mousa Dembele for Spurs.
 
Oh yes yes yes. Harry Kane completes his hat-trick with a goal of 
spine-tingling brilliance. Kane dummies to shoot 25 yards out and plays a short 
pass to Alli. He is surrounded by defenders on the edge of the box, so scoops 
the ball over all of them to allow to Kane to run on and bobble a volley across 
Foster and into the far corner. He probably mishit the finish but the 
combination, and especially Alli’s scoop, was magical.

fly past Ben Foster and into the net for his hat-trick. It’s 4-0 to the

This is a quietly brilliant goal. McAuley dithers by the corner flag and is 
robbed by the utterly bloody relentless Walker. He looks up and hits a 
deliberately fierce pass back towards Kane, hit with enough pace to beat Yacob 
at the near post. It bounces up awkwardly for Kane, who contorts his body like 
a piece of Playdoh to hit an acrobatic shot into the net from 15 yards. As Alan 
Smith says on Sky, he made it look far easier than it was. It wasn’t in the 
same class, but the way he twisted his body was reminiscent of that great 
Dimitar Berbatov goal for Spurs at Middlesbrough. Walker’s pass was also 
terrific: not only did he only have Kane to aim for, but he had to really whack 
the ball to ensure it would not be intercepted by Yacob.

ball to score his second, and Spurs’ third. Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters  
75 min West Brom get a set piece on the halfway line. It’s lumped forward and 
bounces up for Robson-Kanu, who mishits his shot from 17 yards. That, such as 
it was, was West Brom’s best chance of the match.
 
73 min West Brom had a bit of an optimistic spurt at the start of the second 
half, but aside from those 12 seconds  five minutes the win has looked safe for 
Spurs. Their only regrets will be the injury to Vertonghen, which looked 
serious, and that the scoreline does not better reflect a supreme display of 
teamwork.
 
72 min If the FA are in a bad mood on Monday, Walker might get a three-match 
ban for that kick at McAuley. There was nothing in it really, but technically 
speaking he kicked him off the ball, and the laws of the game don’t encourage 
that.
 
71 min What’s the record for saves made in a Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> game? Foster can’t be too 
far away from it. He has just made another and this was one of his better 
saves, a smart plunge to his right to push away Wanyama’s shot.
 
70 min Walker has a little kick at McAuley off the ball. McAuley complains and 
is booked.
 
69 min On the subject of disallowed goals, Mike Greville has suggested Alec 
Lindsay’s classic from the 1974 FA Cup final 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEJVHEPEVMs>.
 
68 min A vicious rising drive from Dembele, hit from 25 yards with his right 
foot, goes just over the bar. Foster had it covered and let it go.
 
66 min “I won’t be convinced by Spurs,” says Ian Copestake, “until they have 
been through a title run-in without hurdling an imaginary hurdle and ending up 
on their belly with their thoroughbred legs splayed fore and aft.”
 
65 min Ben Davies replaces Vertonghen, who is helped down the tunnel. That, 
sad to say, might even be the end of his season. It would be a serious blow to 
Tottenham’s title challenge if so.
 
64 min Olsson is booked for a sliding foul on Kane. He was the last man but in 
a wide position and hence it was not a clear goalscoring opportunity.
 
63 min This looks like a nasty injury to Vertonghen. He stretched to keep a 
ball in play and landed awkwardly on his ankle. That doesn’t look good. He has 
his fingers to his eyes, pressing them against the top of his nose, and looks 
in a lot of pain.

62 min Another West Brom change: Chadli off, Hal Robson-Ariehaanu on.
 
60 min Here’s Hugh Molloy. “If there’s one team that can be totally under the 
cosh for an entire game, go two goals down, but manage to scrape a draw with a 
late penalty and well worked set piece, it’s West Brom.”
 
58 min Foster makes his 471st save of the game, plunging to his left to push 
away Kane’s low curler. It was a relatively comfortable save for a keeper of 
his class, but still: Spurs are on it once more.
 
56 min Walker’s scissor kick is blocked by Olsson and goes behind for a corner 
on the right. Eriksen plays Anderton to Kane’s Sheringham with a near-post 
cut-back, but Kane mishits his first-time shot. It comes to Alderweireld, whose 
shot is well saved by Foster, and then to Alderweireld, whose long-range 
follow-up is equally well saved.

54 min Alli stretches to control Alderweireld’s long pass and is eased over in 
the area by Dawson. Spurs wanted a penalty; Anthony Taylor disagreed. I think 
he made the right decision, though you can see both sides.
 
54 min A West Brom substitution at left wing-back: Chris Brunt off, James 
McClean on.
 
53 min One thing this Spurs team are not is ruthless, and their sluggish start 
to the second half has been a reminder of that.
 
52 min “Only Kevin Keegan could have a goal this good disallowed 
<https://youtu.be/S9SXa55s2OM>,” says Phil Cowen. 
 
51 min West Brom have been the better team in this half. They’ve switched to a 
back three, though a half-time hairdryer is the principal reason for their 
improvement.
 
49 min Here, have another great disallowed goal.
 
48 min West Brom have started this half with much more intent, pressing Spurs 
high up the pitch and especially at goalkicks.
 
46 min Peep peep! Spurs begin the second half. If you are watching on 
television, you’ll need to be able to move your head to the right for the next 
45 minutes. Saying which, that’s a good effort from Matt Phillips, who drives a 
low shot through the legs of Alderweireld and just wide of the post.

Half-time chit-chat

“It’s men against boys,” says Alex Ritchie, “and the Spurs boys are stuffing 
them.”

“Hi Rob,” says Shaun Wilkinson. “Regarding your comment about West Brom having 
the best defence outside of the big six; surely they have a better defence than 
at least one of the big six, and possibly two? The naked stats might not say 
so, but when you think about how much of the ball bigger teams have compared to 
them...”
(Yes, fair point. I just lazily think in terms of BS and NBS when appraising 
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> teams 
mid-MBM.)

“Afternoon Rob,” says Steve Finkel. “Best offside goal has to go to this 
effort from Nani <https://youtu.be/VOdYpz3fQyQ>. Ronaldo’s reaction is 
priceless, entirely justified and probably sums up he feels about Nani.”


 “It seems that Spurs’ footballers are the lowest paid of the big six or the 
current top six. or six,” says Ian Copestake. “This is why you like Spurs so 
much. They are the underpaid women of football fighting for equal pay with 
their male equals. Burn your bra, brother Rob.”

That was a masterclass from Spurs, who should have at least doubled their 2-0 
lead. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.
