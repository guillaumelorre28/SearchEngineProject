Christian Eriksen’s first league goal of the season (from his 40th shot no 
less) ended Chelsea’s run of six matches without conceding, but it couldn’t 
halt their winning streak. Top of the league following seven consecutive 
victories,Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are 
unrecognisable from the team that played Tottenham 12 months ago.

Chelsea went to White Hart Lane a year ago today and their goalkeeper, Asmir 
Begovic, was the man of the match in a goalless draw that left them with 15 
points from 14 games. So far this season they have won 31 points from 13 
matches. The turnaround has been spectacular. Their goal difference was minus 
six a year ago; it is now plus 19. Chelsea were 16th when José Mourinho left 
the club in December, but, if they beat Manchester City at the Etihad on 
Saturday, they will move four points at the top of the table.

Is the Premier League less predictable than other leagues? Not exactly

There are a number of reasons for this drastic improvement – including changes 
of manager, formation and starting line-up – but among the most pertinent is 
their lack of European commitments. Eden Hazard admitted as much this weekend, 
saying: “Last year, we were just doing recovery so we weren’t always ready for 
the game, but that’s not the case now.”

Chelsea’s match against Tottenham last November was their 22nd of the 
campaign, while their meeting at Stamford Bridge on Saturday was their 16th. 
The fact that their closest challenger in the league, Liverpool, have also 
enjoyed more time to rest and train by not playing in Europe this season 
strengthens the claim that European football is proving increasingly difficult 
to juggle. The same argument holds for Liverpool’s title chase in 2013-14 and 
Leicester City’s remarkable success last season.

The same trend is being played out across Europe. In fact, Premier League 
clubs have not been as badly affected by playing in Europe as some of their 
counterparts on the continent. Half of the teams in the top six positions in 
the biggest leagues have not played in Europe this season: Chelsea and 
Liverpool in thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>, Real Sociedad in Spain, 
three sides from Ligue 1, four from Serie A and, remarkably, five of the top 
six in the Bundesliga.

While most fans would welcome the increased competitiveness in domestic 
leagues, this trend could have worrying consequences. The concern is that the 
extremely rich clubs will pump even more money into their squads to compete on 
both fronts. Another danger is that clubs will prefer to finish in seventh or 
eighth rather than in fifth or sixth. Effective rotation will surely become 
more important, with higher fees spent on squad players.

But money cannot buy time on the training ground, and that’s where Chelsea and 
Liverpool appear to be profiting most under their meticulous managers. “We do 
lots of tactical work and video work – it depends who we are playing. We do 
everything to be prepared,” said Hazard.

Conte’s preparation is clearly paying off and his players also seem fitter 
this season. They have scored 12 times from the 60th minute onwards this season 
compared to 19 over the whole of last season. Tellingly, the top scorers in the 
last half-hour of matches last season were Leicester City, Tottenham (who 
weren’t in Europe) and Southampton (whoseEuropa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> campaign was over by 
the end of August).

A trip to Manchester City is next for Chelsea, with both clubs out of the EFL 
Cup and therefore afforded a full week to gear up for the match on Saturday. A 
win would leave either team top of the league, but if Chelsea can stay in the 
mix until theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> knockout stages begin in 
February, their absence from European football could prove the decisive factor 
in the title race once more.
