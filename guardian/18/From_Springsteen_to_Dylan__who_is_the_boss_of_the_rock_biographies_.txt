The release of Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/born-to-run-memoir-bruce-springsteen-review>
 this week caused a predictable stir among fans, some of whoqueued for hours 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/27/bruce-springsteen-book-new-jersey-born-to-run>
 to meet the Boss as he began his book tour.


But the book, titled Born to Run, is far from the only work about the rock 
star. The British Library lists41 titles

 with Springsteen as their subject matter, from biographies and photographic 
collections toBruce Springsteen and Philosophy

.

But, while impressive, the number of books about Springsteen is small compared 
to some other solo artists who have been inducted intoRock and Roll Hall of Fame

.

We worked this out by counting every title that lists a given rock star as its 
subject. The undisputed victor, unsurprisingly, isBob Dylan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan>, with 138 – three times as many as 
Springsteen.

John Lennon comes next with 98 titles, Elvis Presley ranks third with 97, 
while Michael Jackson and Bob Marley round out the top five.

The Beatles <https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles> (as so often is the 
case) deserve special mention: the group was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 
1988, but all four individual members were later inducted individually.

The British Library has 54 books about Paul McCartney, George Harrison is the 
subject of 19, while Ringo Starr has five books listed against his name.

Madonna <https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna> is the only female artists 
that ranks in the top 10 with 53 titles about her – a dozen more than 
Springsteen.
