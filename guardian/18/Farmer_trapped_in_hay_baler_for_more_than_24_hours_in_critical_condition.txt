A Victorian farmer trapped in a hay baler for more than 24 hours is fighting 
for life in hospital.

The man, aged in his 60s, became trapped in the machinery at his Mount Duneed 
farm in Geelong sometime on Monday, AmbulanceVictoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> says.

It is understood he was found by neighbours on Tuesday evening with emergency 
services called at 6.45pm. It then took CFA and SES crews more than 2.5 hours 
to free the farmer.

“It obviously took some time because he was half in and half out of the hay 
baler,” a CFA spokeswoman said. “It was quite a delicate procedure to get him 
out.”

The injured farmer was initially taken to Geelong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/geelong> hospital before being flown by air 
ambulance to the Royal Melbourne hospital where he remains in a critical 
condition.

WorkSafe Victoria is now investigating.
