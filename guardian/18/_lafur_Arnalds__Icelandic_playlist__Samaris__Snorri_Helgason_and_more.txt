Samaris – Wanted 2 Say

Samaris feature on my Late Night Tales compilation with their song Góða Tungl 
but here is their latest single and a great video to go with it. Their sound 
has developed in the last year and this has a nice two-steppy feel to it. The 
video reminds me a bit ofLet the Right One In

Sóley – Never Cry Moon (Live)

A new track from my friend Sóley, who’s working on her new album. I really 
love the direction she’s taking with this and have fallen in love with the 
unison girl voice arrangements. I like the beauty in the simplicity of this. 
The red card thing was a political protest as this was recorded in the middle 
of thePanama Papers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers>
 scandal: they are giving our government the red card.

Snorri Helgason – Einsemd

The latest single from our folk music hero, with a wonderfully quirky video, 
too. Snorri is also the programmer of my favourite venue in Iceland,Húrra

Hjaltalín – Ethereal (Live)

This is a live version of a track that’s on my compilation. I have been 
following (and collaborating with)this band 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/08/northern-souls-the-anarcho-punks-who-made-iceland-a-pop-powerhouse>
 since their early days but this is my favourite song of theirs. Lead singer 
and songwriter Högni Egilsson (also goes under “HE”) really managed to capture 
something raw and unique.

Jóhann Jóhannsson – Through Falling Snow (Prisoners OST)

Jóhann <http://www.johannjohannsson.com/news/> has been steadily moving to the 
top of the film scoring world lately, with two Academy award nominations in the 
last two years. I think he makes the most interesting soundtracks in the 
mainstream film industry at the moment.
