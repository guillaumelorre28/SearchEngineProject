The Poland international Lewandowski has now scored twice in each of his past 
four visits to Mainz. Bayern, however, went behind after four minutes when the 
Colombian striker Jhon Córdoba charged past Javi Martínez and drilled an 
unstoppable low shot past Manuel Neuer.

Lewandowski equalised four minutes later, though, with a tidy finish from a 
fine through-ball by Robben. Thomas Müller, without a goal this season, could 
have put the visitors ahead but his point-blank effort was kicked away by the 
keeper Jonas Lössl.

Müller then turned provider and Robben beat Lössl with a well-timed header to 
put the champions ahead in the 21st minute. Lewandowski’s ninth league goal of 
the campaign followed in stoppage time.

Bayern have now chalked up two Bundesliga

suffering their first defeat of the season against Borussia Dortmund on 19 
November. Mainz remain in ninth place on 17 points.
