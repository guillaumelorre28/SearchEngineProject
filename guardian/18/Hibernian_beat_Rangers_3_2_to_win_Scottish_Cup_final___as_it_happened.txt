OK, going to have to leave you there

I need to scoot off and do some work on the English final now – and if it’s 
half as good as that game was, I’ll be in a quivering heap by 7.30pm. 
Congratulations to Hibs, who over the 90 minutes deserved it fully and won it 
in the most dramatic, devastating fashion. Well worth savouring, even if some 
parties would rather wring their hands and make the story a non-football one 
for no real reason. Hibs’ hoodoo is broken after 114 years;Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> can, at least, content 
themselves with next season’s top-flight place. Cheerio!

“This has completely spoilt the day”, says the Sky commentator. Laying it on 
thick there. It hasn’t, and it won’t, and it’s been sorted out well by the 
police. There were one or two idiots about but it’s been sorted out.

Any trouble that flared up briefly has calmed down. We’ve just been heavily 
moralised to by the commentary team for a good five minutes there though, and I 
for one consider myself a better citizen now.

The Hampden pitch is swarming with Hibs fans, some of whom are ... errrr ... 
giving it out toRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> players. 
But the majority seem to fancy a celebration, and my word their team has earned 
it.

Chaos! Bedlam! Amazement! Hibs win a corner after Stokes, again, comes in from 
the left and cracks a shot in that Foderingham has to turn behind. Another 
right-sided corner, another superb Stevenson delivery – and Gray gets up to 
head into the far corner and surely, surely end that 114-year cup hex! Amazing!

82 min: I’d like to think the update on 79 undid any harm inflicted on Hibs 
the minute before Halliday’s goal. What a stupendously good game this remains. 
And rarely seen a striker have a more eventful game than Stokes today, either.

Goal! Rangers 2-2 Hibs (Stokes 80)

My word! Fyvie wins a corner down the right, greeted by one heck of a roar by 
the Hibs fans behind the goal. Henderson outswings it, Stokes gets up at the 
near post ... and nods it into the corner! Stubbs missed it – he’d gone to the 
toilet!

77 min: Stokes should do better! A slick Hibs move finds him out on that 
left-sided perch again, and he cuts inside again, and does the hard work really 
before lashing a hurried shot over. How many cracks at goal has the guy had 
today?

73 min: Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> have that sense 
of control now, working the ball neatly and not really giving much else away at 
the other end. But we’ve seen how lively Hibs can be – don’t write them off 
yet...

68 min: Stokes takes on Tavernier and, with options in the box, shoots rashly

Goal! Rangers 2-1 Hibs (Halliday 64)

What did I just say? Halliday receives the ball 30 yards out, brings it 
forwards, and with defenders backing off he lashes in a *tremendously* sweet 
left-footer across the diving Logan. What a superb goal, and the game has 
turned on its head!

57 min: McKay, who we’re seeing much more of in this half, finds Miller on the 
left with an outside-of-the-boot pass and Miller’s cross for Waghorn perhaps 
catches the recipient, who heads over at the back post, by surprise a little 
bit.

56 min: Kiernan clears the ball straight to Stevenson, who gets to it slightly 
ahead of Tavernier and is upended in spectacular fashion. Tavernier didn’t mean 
anything malicious there, but is rightly booked. The free-kick, taken from out 
on the left, reaches Fontaine ... who flings himself at the ball and heads wide!

54 min: McGinn is a real driving force in that Hibs midfield, but just as he 
thinks he’s outfought Miller and 36-year-old battles back and wrestles the ball 
off him. What a tussle, and what energy from the veteran.

51 min: Slack play from Wilson at the back for Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> though, giving Hibs a throw in a 
good position. They spread the ball out to the left and Stokes, with his 
umpteenth shot, shoots speculatively from 25 yards – and Foderingham has to 
shovel it behind! Fontaine heads the corner over. Hibs really are a constant 
threat and Stokes could have scored about six.

I was starting to wonder where Simon McMahon was, and he’s composed himself to 
pen this:

“A cup final for the ages is on the cards here if the second half can keep up 
this pace and action. Story in the papers up here today about the 106 year old 
Hibs fan, who has lived through two world wars and was alive when the Titanic 
went down, looking to see his team win theScottish Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottishcup> for the first time. At 106!”

Half-time: Rangers 1-1 Hibs

Now that was an absolutely brilliant half of cup final football. Relentless, 
helter-skelter fun. Stokes scored early on and could/should have scored several 
more, also hitting the post. The latter event came after that man Kenny Miller 
equalised for aRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> side that 
had been very much second best until then. Miller later hit the woodwork too, 
and if the second half is anything like this then you really won’t want to move 
a muscle.

44 min: Zelalem is late on McGinn, who found that rather painful but will take 
the free-kick 40 yards out. He’ll cross it in. It’s cleared, after Gray wins 
the first header.

42 min: Close from Stokes again! And again! And for the third or fourth time 
he cuts in from the left far too easily, Tavernier getting nowhere near him and 
Foderingham getting down sharply to turn behind for a corner.Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> have to sort this out. After the 
flag kick is only half cleared, Foderingham is out sharply to block a Cummings 
effort, and then the ball is swung in again for Stokes, alone at the far post, 
to head over. Three fine chances for Hibs!

32 min: Waghorn wins a corner despite Zelalem slightly overcooking a slide 
rule pass down the right. McKay puts it in ... and now Miller hits the woodwork 
too! Another thumping, crashing header comes back off the bar. It should 
probably be 2-1. You just cannot take your eyes off this.

30 min: That salvo aside, how will the goal affect Hibs? They had been so, so 
good for 27 minutes and should probably have scored a second but really 
switched off there, both in allowing the cross and the header for a goal from 
nothing. It’s not the most mentally strong team on these big occasions...

And here’s Ewan Murray’s match report:

Hibernian and David Gray stun Rangers to make Scottish Cup history
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/rangers-hibernian-scottish-cup-final-match-report> 
I need to scoot off and do some work on the English final now – and if it’s 
half as good as that game was, I’ll be in a quivering heap by 7.30pm. 
Congratulations to Hibs, who over the 90 minutes deserved it fully and won it 
in the most dramatic, devastating fashion. Well worth savouring, even if some 
parties would rather wring their hands and make the story a non-football one 
for no real reason. Hibs’ hoodoo is broken after 114 years;Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> can, at least, content 
themselves with next season’s top-flight place. Cheerio!
 
“Does it take the gloss off your victory today?” Alan Stubbs is asked. Just 
stop it.
 
“This has completely spoilt the day”, says the Sky commentator. Laying it on 
thick there. It hasn’t, and it won’t, and it’s been sorted out well by the 
police. There were one or two idiots about but it’s been sorted out.

Any trouble that flared up briefly has calmed down. We’ve just been heavily 
moralised to by the commentary team for a good five minutes there though, and I 
for one consider myself a better citizen now.
 
Scottish fans on the goalposts? Seen that before. And a few scuffles too 
towards theRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> end. Not the 
best of endings.

But the majority seem to fancy a celebration, and my word their team has earned 
it.
 
What a game! What a fantastic final! And Hibs, in the most dramatic fashion, 
have won it!
 
90+5 min: The scenes of celebration there were proper, limbs everywhere, 
writhing, delirious stuff. They’re seconds away...
 
Chaos! Bedlam! Amazement! Hibs win a corner after Stokes, again, comes in from 
the left and cracks a shot in that Foderingham has to turn behind. Another 
right-sided corner, another superb Stevenson delivery – and Gray gets up to 
head into the far corner and surely, surely end that 114-year cup hex! Amazing!

Oh my....!
 
90 min: Stevenson seems OK, which is lucky as Hibs have made all three 
changes. Four minutes’ added time to come...
 
89 min: McGinn, influential this half, nearly threads Keatings in but it just 
reaches the alert Foderingham. At the other end, Gunnarsson judges his 
challenge perfectly to thwart Shiels. Corner toRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>, but it’s well cleared – and a 
couple of Hibs men collided, so play is stopped whole Stevenson is treated...
 
86 min: Holt gets away down the left and is onside – you wonder whether 
McGeouch is going to bundle him over inside the box but he stands up well and 
it runs out for a goal kick.
 
85 min: Any chance of a winner before we enjoy 30 minutes’ extra time? There’s 
an argument for not wanting this to end.
 
83 min: Hibs’ latest change is Hanlon off, Niklas Gunnarsson on.
 
82 min: I’d like to think the update on 79 undid any harm inflicted on Hibs 
the minute before Halliday’s goal. What a stupendously good game this remains. 
And rarely seen a striker have a more eventful game than Stokes today, either.
 
My word! Fyvie wins a corner down the right, greeted by one heck of a roar by 
the Hibs fans behind the goal. Henderson outswings it, Stokes gets up at the 
near post ... and nods it into the corner! Stubbs missed it – he’d gone to the 
toilet!

79 min: Hibs are just starting to get back into this after the shock of that 
second goal – ain’t over yet.
 
77 min: Stokes should do better! A slick Hibs move finds him out on that 
left-sided perch again, and he cuts inside again, and does the hard work really 
before lashing a hurried shot over. How many cracks at goal has the guy had 
today?
 
75 min: Stokes floats one in for Gray at the back stick, but Gray is a yard 
offside. And now another change: Waghorn off forRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>, and Nicky Clark on.
 
73 min: Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> have that sense 
of control now, working the ball neatly and not really giving much else away at 
the other end. But we’ve seen how lively Hibs can be – don’t write them off 
yet...
 
70 min: Henderson, another Celtic loanee, replaces Fontaine for Hibs and they 
change to a back four.
 
68 min: Stokes takes on Tavernier and, with options in the box, shoots rashly 
wide with his left foot. A waste.
 
68 min: Hibs will be wondering what exactly they need to do to win a cup final 
at this rate. It was right there for them, this one, and now it looks very far 
away...
 
66 min: Unbelievable. And sorry about that previous entry, Hibs fans. Hibs 
respond by bringing Keatings on for Cummings up front, and then Stokes chips 
wide from range.
 
What did I just say? Halliday receives the ball 30 yards out, brings it 
forwards, and with defenders backing off he lashes in a *tremendously* sweet 
left-footer across the diving Logan. What a superb goal, and the game has 
turned on its head!

64 min: It’s just a little bit snippy and bitty out there currently – compared 
to the chance-fest that was the first half, anyway.
 
63 min: First change for Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>
, and ex-Hibee Dean Shiels replaces Zelalem, who hasn’t really been incisive 
enough,
 
61 min: Now Cummings, in a decent area, fizzes a cross beyond everyone after 
more good work from McGinn. Should have done better.
 
59 min: Including that one from Fyvie on Zelalem, which is about five minutes 
late and is rewarded by the afternoon’s second yellow card. Zelalem walks 
gingerly away, but might be coming off soon anyway.
 
58 min: Stokes gets a warning after catching Halliday late. A few challenges 
coming in now.
 
57 min: McKay, who we’re seeing much more of in this half, finds Miller on the 
left with an outside-of-the-boot pass and Miller’s cross for Waghorn perhaps 
catches the recipient, who heads over at the back post, by surprise a little 
bit.
 
56 min: Kiernan clears the ball straight to Stevenson, who gets to it slightly 
ahead of Tavernier and is upended in spectacular fashion. Tavernier didn’t mean 
anything malicious there, but is rightly booked. The free-kick, taken from out 
on the left, reaches Fontaine ... who flings himself at the ball and heads wide!
 
54 min: McGinn is a real driving force in that Hibs midfield, but just as he 
thinks he’s outfought Miller and 36-year-old battles back and wrestles the ball 
off him. What a tussle, and what energy from the veteran.
 
52 min: McGinn sprays a fine ball out to Cummings, who tries to nutmeg Wilson 
and make for goal but comes out second best.
 
51 min: Slack play from Wilson at the back for Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> though, giving Hibs a throw in a 
good position. They spread the ball out to the left and Stokes, with his 
umpteenth shot, shoots speculatively from 25 yards – and Foderingham has to 
shovel it behind! Fontaine heads the corner over. Hibs really are a constant 
threat and Stokes could have scored about six.
 
49 min: Waghorn again involved, but Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> are forced back slightly. They 
are on the front foot in general though and Hibs haven’t really had a touch yet.
 
47 min: Faster start from Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers>, Waghorn going to the line and 
taking a tumble under Stevenson’s challenge ... but never a penalty.
 
Can they keep this up?
 
I was starting to wonder where Simon McMahon was, and he’s composed himself to 
pen this:

“A cup final for the ages is on the cards here if the second half can keep up 
this pace and action. Story in the papers up here today about the 106 year old 
Hibs fan, who has lived through two world wars and was alive when the Titanic 
went down, looking to see his team win theScottish Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottishcup> for the first time. At 106!”
 
Now that was an absolutely brilliant half of cup final football. Relentless, 
helter-skelter fun. Stokes scored early on and could/should have scored several 
more, also hitting the post. The latter event came after that man Kenny Miller 
equalised for aRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> side that 
had been very much second best until then. Miller later hit the woodwork too, 
and if the second half is anything like this then you really won’t want to move 
a muscle.
 
45 min: Cummings takes aim from 30 yards, shoots well over. Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> get the play going again 
straightaway. The pace of this!
 
44 min: Zelalem is late on McGinn, who found that rather painful but will take 
the free-kick 40 yards out. He’ll cross it in. It’s cleared, after Gray wins 
the first header.
 
42 min: Close from Stokes again! And again! And for the third or fourth time 
he cuts in from the left far too easily, Tavernier getting nowhere near him and 
Foderingham getting down sharply to turn behind for a corner.Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> have to sort this out. After the 
flag kick is only half cleared, Foderingham is out sharply to block a Cummings 
effort, and then the ball is swung in again for Stokes, alone at the far post, 
to head over. Three fine chances for Hibs!

40 min: McKay goes on his first real run of the match, outpacing Gray down the 
left, but the right-back does just enough to deter him and the cross is sliced 
behind the goal.
 
38 min: Waghorn tries to score from about 45 yards, and it’s nowhere near.
 
38 min: That said, we’re having the first real lull now. It’s probably as well 
for everyone to gather breath.
 
36 min: It really could be at least 2-2 here. It’s been a belting half. 
 
34 min: Stevenson denies Waghorn, increasingly prominent, as he looks to jink 
inside.Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> have definitely 
improved and this match is incredibly open.
 
32 min: Waghorn wins a corner despite Zelalem slightly overcooking a slide 
rule pass down the right. McKay puts it in ... and now Miller hits the woodwork 
too! Another thumping, crashing header comes back off the bar. It should 
probably be 2-1. You just cannot take your eyes off this.

31 min: Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> fans have set 
off a flare and the left goal is lightly covered by a red haze.
 
30 min: That salvo aside, how will the goal affect Hibs? They had been so, so 
good for 27 minutes and should probably have scored a second but really 
switched off there, both in allowing the cross and the header for a goal from 
nothing. It’s not the most mentally strong team on these big occasions...
