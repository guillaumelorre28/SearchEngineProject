The director of Britain’s Serious Fraud Office 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/serious-fraud-office> has secured a two-year 
extension of his contract to April 2018.

“I am happy to continue as director, and the SFO will continue to take on the 
sort of cases for which it was designed,” said David Green, who was appointed 
to the role in 2012 for a fixed term that was due to end in April this year.

The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, who granted the extension, said: “In his 
time as director of the SFO, David Green led a change in the organisation’s 
approach to prosecuting cases and delivered the first UK deferred prosecution 
agreement and the first convictions under the Bribery Act 2010.”

Last month, six defendants in an SFO case regarding alleged rigging of the 
Libor interest rate benchmarkwere cleared by a jury

, dealing a significant blow to the organisation.
