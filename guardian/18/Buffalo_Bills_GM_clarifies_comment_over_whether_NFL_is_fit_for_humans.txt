Buffalo Bills <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/buffalo-bills> general 
manager Doug Whaley acknowledges he used “a poor choice of words” when 
referring to football being a violent game that he personally didn’t think was 
intended to be played by humans.

Whaley’s clarification was issued in a statement the Bills posted on their 
public relations Twitter account Wednesday. A day earlier, in an interview with 
Buffalo’s WGR Radio, the GM wondered whether football was meant for “humans” 
when answering a question whether receiver Sammy Watkins was injury prone.

The former college safety now says the point he was attempting to make is that 
football is a physical game and that injuries are a part of it. CitingNFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> rule changes and other safety 
enhancements, Whaley says football is safer to play than ever before.
