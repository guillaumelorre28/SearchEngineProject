Spain’s idiosyncratic and gruelling working day, an 11-hour stretch punctuated 
by coffee breaks, yawns and long lunches, could be abandoned as the government 
seeks to bring the country into line with the rest ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.


On Monday, the employment minister, Fátima Báñez, announced a push to let 
Spaniards knock off at 6pm, rather than the current 8pm. The government has 
also said it is willing to consider, as part of a series of measures designed 
to improve work-life balance, reversing the Franco-era decision that putSpain

Happy hour: Balearics try to keep summer time as Spain turns back the clocks

“We want our workdays to finish at six o’clock and to achieve this we will 
work towards striking a deal with representatives from both companies and trade 
unions,” she told parliament.


“Someone’s got to take the first step and that’s why I’m asking for the 
support of the biggest companies and the trade unions.”


At the moment, Spanish workers start their day around 9am, break for coffee 
mid-morning and then work until 2pm. The lunch break lasts two or three hours, 
after which they return to work until about 8pm. Such a late finish means that 
dinner isn’t eaten before 9pm. After a couple of hours of TV, people tend to go 
to bed around midnight.


Proponents of change argue that a working day built more around agricultural 
labour than the office-based reality of most of 21st-century Spain has taken 
too large a toll on people and productivity for too long.

It is not the first time that calls have been made for a thorough overhaul of 
the working day. Three years ago, a parliamentary commissionrecommended the 
introduction of a more regular, 9-to-5 day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/spain-working-hours-ending-siesta>
.


The commission also suggested returning the country to its proper time zone. 
Although Spain used to be on the same time as the UK and Portugal, it has run 
an hour ahead since 1942, when General Francisco Franco shifted it forward in 
solidarity with Hitler’s Germany.

“We call it the religious working day: you start work when God wants and 
finish when he wants,” saidProfessor Nuria Chinchilla 
<http://www.iese.edu/en/faculty-research/professors/faculty-directory/nuria-chinchilla/>
, director of the International Centre for Work and Family at Spain’s IESE 
Business School.


Chinchilla said the negative consequences of a tired workforce extended far 
beyond the balance sheet.


“It’s awful and it affects people’s ability to look after their children and 
spend time with them after school; we’re also sleeping an hour less than we 
should be, so we’re less productive given the hours worked and there are more 
accidents. It’s really irrational and that’s why we’re campaigning for it to be 
fixed.”


She said turning back the clocks and introducing a 9-to-5 day would yield 
swift and obvious benefits: “If we turn the clocks back, it’ll get darker 
earlier and so people will want to go home earlier. It would also be good for 
the body and people would work better and more productively.”


Details of the government’s plan are unclear, but the People’s party, which 
was returned to office in October after 10 months of political paralysis, has 
already won the support of the opposition Socialist and the smaller Ciudadanos 
(Citizens) party.


The move comes a year after the Catalan government committed itself to 
becoming thefirst region in Spain to align its working hours with the rest of 
Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/catalonia-long-working-days-spain-europe>
.


Catalonia’s new working day, designed to improve work-life balance, is 
expected to begin in September 2018.


In October, campaigners in the Balearic islands urged Madrid to let them stay 
on summer time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/happy-hour-balearics-try-to-keep-summer-time-as-spain-turns-back-the-clocks>
 rather than putting the clocks back along with the rest of Spain. They pointed 
out that the Balearics see the sunset almost an hour earlier than western parts 
of the peninsula and that businesses and people suffer as a result.

The Més per Menorca coalition said that keeping the islands on the same time 
as mainland Spain was based on “obsolete industrial” concerns, adding: “Modern 
society needs the hours of daylight to adapt to its leisure time.”
