A retired lecturer who is terminally ill has launched a legal challenge for 
the right to die, claiming that the 1961 Suicide Act condemns him to an 
undignified and terrifying death.

Noel Conway, 67, from Shrewsbury, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease 
more than two years ago and fears being “entombed” in his own body as his 
ability to move declines. He is not expected to survive beyond the next 12 
months.

Supported by the organisation Dignity in Dying, Conway has instructed the law 
firm Irwin Mitchell to seek permission for a judicial review in the high court 
of the ban on assisted suicide which, he says, prevents him ending his own life 
without protracted pain.


Assisted suicide is prohibited by section 2(1) of the Suicide Act 1961 and 
voluntary euthanasia is considered murder under UK law. Conway’s challenge, if 
the court hears it, could establish strict criteria and safeguards for 
terminally ill adults to make their own decisions about ending their lives.

It is hoped the claim, formally against the Ministry of Justice, will be heard 
early this year. Before his illness, Conway, who taught social sciences and is 
married with children, enjoyed hiking, cycling and traveling. His deteriorating 
condition means, however, that his ability to move, dress, eat and deal with 
personal care independently has diminished. He is already dependent on a 
ventilator to breathe overnight.

“I have motor neurone disease. It is incurable and terminal. It is a 
muscle-wasting disease and I am now heading for its final stages when I face 
not being able to move at all. This prospect is terrifying and the amount of 
suffering unimaginable,” he said.

“Current law means that I will have no control of how my life ends and I will 
have to endure this nightmare for as long as it takes. As someone who has 
always been in control of his life and taken responsibility for himself, I find 
this quite unacceptable. I want to change the law to allow assisted dying so 
that I can be in control of my own death.

“If I let nature take its course, I could effectively become entombed in my 
own body as my ability to move and communicate continues to diminish, or I may 
die by suffocation or choking. I could bring about my death by refusing my 
ventilator, but then there is the unbearable uncertainty of not knowing how 
long it would take and no guarantee that my distress and pain could be 
adequately managed.”

Conway said he had considered traveling to a suicide clinic in Switzerland, 
but that it would be expensive and he did not wish to “die in a faceless 
clinic, away from my home and without my loved ones”.

Sarah Wootton, the chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said: “Noel’s 
experience sadly echoes that of hundreds of other terminally ill people in this 
country. Choice and control at the end of life are rights that everyone should 
be able to exercise and it is a tragic failure of our laws that Noel and others 
are being denied them.

 “Despite overwhelming public support for assisted dying, our government has 
failed to act and is ignoring the pleas of terminally ill people. Britain is 
being left behind as jurisdictions around the world implement compassionate 
laws allowing dying people the choice and control they deserve.”

 Yogi Amin, a partner and head of public law at Irwin Mitchell, said: “Noel is 
an extremely brave and proud man who is supported by his loving family. He 
would like the choice to be able to die with dignity. The world has changed 
phenomenally in the past few decades with many medical advances, but the law on 
assisted dying for those who are terminally ill hasn’t changed for more than 50 
years.”

The supreme court dismissed a case brought in 2012 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/16/locked-in-syndrome-right-die> 
by Tony Nicklinson, who suffered from paralysis after a stroke. The judges 
recommended that parliament should debate the issue before the courts made any 
decision to change the law.


Nicklinson died days after the verdict but his widow, Jane, went on to take 
the case to the European court of human rights where it wasagain defeated in 
2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/16/assisted-suicide-voluntary-euthanasia-european-court-human-rights>
on the grounds that it was for national parliaments to decide on such a 
sensitive issue.

The Inter-Faith Dignity in Dying (IFDiD) group involving Christian and Jewish 
clergy who support a change in the law supports Conway’s case. “We hold that 
being religious is not just about respecting life, but also about knowing when 
to let go,” said Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, IFDiD’s chair. “A religious 
perspective includes the right to die as well as possible, rather than be 
forced to endure unnecessary suffering.”
