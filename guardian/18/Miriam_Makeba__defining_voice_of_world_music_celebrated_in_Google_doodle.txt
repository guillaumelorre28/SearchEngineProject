The birthday of Miriam Makeba 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/11/miriam-makeba-obituary>, the late 
singer and civil rights campaigner, has been commemorated with a Google doodle.

Makeba was born in Johannesburg on 4 March, 1932. In 1960, the South African 
government cancelled her passport to prevent her returning to her home from her 
travels overseas. She returned after the release of Nelson Mandela in 1990.

She initially sang jazz but later became an exponent of what became known as 
"world music" 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/10/southafrica-worldmusic>. She 
performed with artists such as Harry Belafonte, Paul Simon and Hugh Masekela, 
her first husband. Other husbands included Stokely Carmichael, a leading member 
of the American Black Panther movement.

In 1962, she performed at President John F Kennedy's birthday party.

Makeba died in Italy in 2008

performance for Roberto Saviano, the author of Sodom and Gomorrah, who lives in 
hiding after writing about the activities of the Neapolitan mafia, the Camorra.
