 mission to play the first record in space has been accomplished.
On 30 July, A Glorious Dawn by composer John Boswell, mixed with audio of 
American scientist Carl Sagan describing the universe, was played 28,000 metres 
above Earth on a “space-proof” turntable engineered to operate in the 
conditions.

The record played for about 80 minutes until the high-altitude balloon which 
carried the contraption burst and propelled the turntable back towards Marsing, 
Idaho.

White, who founded Third Man Records which was behind the mission, said: “Our 
main goal from inception to completion of this project was to inject 
imagination and inspiration into the daily discourse of music and vinyl lovers.

“We hope that in meeting our goal we inspire others to dream big and start 
their own missions, whatever they may be.”

The record had to be plated in gold to ensure the grooves kept their shape. 
Taking three years to create, the Icarus Craft was designed and engineered by 
Kevin Carrico, whose father John worked on Nasa’s Mars-Viking missions.

With the contraption exposed to direct sunlight, shade and without air, the 
record would be in a state of constant expansion and contraction.

“As you rise higher and higher into the thinning atmosphere, temperature and 
increasing vacuum (lack of air) can cause issues,” Carrico explained.

“Vinyl has a rather low melting point (71C/160F) and without air to keep 
things cool, you could wind up with a lump of melted plastic on your hands if a 
record is exposed to the sun for too long.”

Third Man Records wrote in a statement: “We could not be happier to check this 
longtime goal off its bucket list.”
