Timbaland <https://www.theguardian.com/music/timbaland> has added his voice to 
the criticism of Lifetime’s biopic of R&B star Aaliyah, after the film caused 
uproar on social media, mostly because of its casting choices.


The producer, who worked closely with the singer before her death in 2001, 
described the production as “bullshit” before posting videos and photos 
criticising the biopic, which aired on Saturday.


Most of the criticism centred around the casting choices. Social media users 
pointed out that stars in the movie – such as Izaak Smith, who played 
Timbaland, and Chattrisse Dolabaille, who played Missy Elliott – barely 
resembled the musicians they were depicting.

Fans used hashtags such as #LifetimeBiopics and #LifetimeBeLike to mock the 
studio’s casting decisions by coming up with their own off-target casting 
choices.

Aaliyah: The Princess Of R&B was controversial even before it aired. Aaliyah’s 
family did not allow the studio to use her music, and Zendaya Coleman, who was 
originally picked to playAaliyah <https://www.theguardian.com/music/aaliyah>, 
backed out after describing the project as “rushed”.

Executive producer Debra Martin Chase told the Washington Post before the 
transmission on Saturday: “Biopics are hard. People have an opinion and social 
media allows them to voice that opinion. But at the end of the day, our goal 
was to make the best movie possible.”
