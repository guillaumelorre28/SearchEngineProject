Manchester United have had a soft spot for French supremacy since the days 
when Eric Cantona tried to literally kick xenophobia out of football and left 
the rest of the country foaming with impotent rage as he lifted a title every 
season. José Mourinho knows his history, it seems, as he is turning United into 
a mini-France faster than you can say “Brexit means Brexit”. He already has 
Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial, and now he is planning to buyAntoine Griezmann 
in the summer!
 See the full visual 
Griezmann has a buy-out clause of €100, which by June will be the equivalent 
of about GBP four billion, but that won’t deter Mourinho. The Independent says 
Griezmann has already verbally agreed his wages and squad number. Mourinho is 
also planning to sellLuke Shaw in the summer, possibly to Chelsea or Spurs, and 
will replace him with Monaco’s Bernard Mendy. He’s French, you know.

Memphis Depay won’t have to wait as long as Shaw for a P45 and a montage of 
his best bits at Old Trafford (provisional running time: four seconds): he is 
set to move to Lyon this month.

, Antonio Conte has started to consider replacements. Michy Batshuayi is an 
option, but then so is setting yourself on fire to keep warm in the winter. 
Conte prefers the idea of Real Madrid’s Álvaro Morata or Everton’s Romelu 
Lukaku.

Josep Guardiola has decided to disband the Manchester City Defensive Troupe. 
The two men top of the list for his non-singing, non-dancing, all-competent 
defensive unit are Southampton’sVirgil Van Dijk and Valencia left-back José Gayà
.

Leonardo Ulloa wants to leave Leicester. West Brom, Sunderland, Hull and 
Swansea have set up an RSS feed for him. West Ham have offered £15m for 
Brentford strikerScott Hogan; Marseille want to give Yohan Cabaye a loving 
home; and AC Milan want to address the disturbing consonant/vowel ratio in 
their squad by signingGerard Deulofeu from Everton.
