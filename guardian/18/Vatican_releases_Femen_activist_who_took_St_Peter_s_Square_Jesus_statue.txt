 and snatched the statue of the baby Jesus from the Vatican’s outdoor nativity 
scene.

Vatican spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi said the Vatican prosecutor met 
with Yana Zhdanova on Saturday and decided to order her freed. She was also 
ordered to never set foot again in Vatican City state, including St. Peter’s 
Basilica, or on otherVatican <https://www.theguardian.com/world/vatican> 
property outside the city state’s walls.

The Femen protester shouted “God is woman” when she uncovered her chest in the 
square on Thursday, about an hour afterPope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis> had greeted and blessed tens 
of thousands of faithful. A Vatican guard then covered her chest with his cloak 
and took her into Vatican custody.
