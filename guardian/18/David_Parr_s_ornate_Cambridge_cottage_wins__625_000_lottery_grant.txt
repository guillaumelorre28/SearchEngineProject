By day David Parr, a painter and decorator in Victorian Cambridge, worked on 
some of the town’s grandest interiors, including colleges, churches and private 
mansions.

Often working by candlelight, he covered the walls of his modest two-storey 
cottage with hand-painted versions of the splendour he was creating for the 
rich.

The house <http://davidparrhouse.org/> – a rare survival of an unaltered 
working-class home in the area – isnow owned by a trust 
<http://davidparrhouse.org/> and has been awarded a heritage lottery grant of 
£625,000 to restore it and open it to the public.

Parr worked for the renowned Cambridge firm FR Leach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/31/family-portrait-leach-cambridge-pub-art>
, whose clients included Jesus and Queen’s colleges. He bought the cottage in 
1887 and, over the next 40 years, adorned its walls with versions of the gothic 
revival and arts and crafts interiors he was working on by day, including his 
interpretation of William Morris designs.

Tamsin Wimhurst, chair of the trust, said: “The David Parr house is a unique 
showcase for the life and art of the ordinary working people who created this 
beautiful city.

“As William Morris so perfectly said: ‘The past is not dead, it is living in 
us, and will be alive in the future which we are now helping to make.’”

Parr’s interiors survived only because, on his death in 1927, his 12-year-old 
granddaughter Elsie Palmer moved in to help care for his widow.

She lived in the house for the next 85 years, marrying and raising a family 
there, but leaving it almost unaltered. Her coat still hangs in the hall and 
her wedding photograph is framed on the wall.

The trust bought the property in 2013 and is collaborating with Parr’s family 
on its restoration. Work is scheduled to start this spring and be completed 
within two years.
