Israel will reassess its ties with the UN following the adoption by the 
security council of a resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlement 
building, the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu>, has announced.

 The vote was able to pass the 15-member council  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/24/israel-rejects-shameful-un-resolution-amid-criticism-of-netanyahu>
on Friday after the US broke with a longstanding approach of diplomatically 
shielding Israel and did not wield its veto power as it had many times before – 
a decision that Netanyahu called “shameful”.

“I instructed the foreign ministry to complete within a month a re-evaluation 
of all our contacts with theUnited Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations>, including the Israeli 
funding of UN institutions and the presence of UN representatives in Israel,” 
Netanyahu said on Saturday.

“I have already instructed to stop about 30m shekels (£6.3m) in funding to 
five UN institutions, five bodies, that are especially hostile toIsrael 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> … and there is more to come,” he 
said.

 The Israeli leader did not name the institutions or offer any further details.

 Defying heavy pressure from longstanding ally Israel and the president-elect, 
Donald Trump, for Washington to use its veto, the US abstained in the security 
council decision, which passed with 14 votes in favour.

On Saturday Trump waded into the row, tweeting:

harder to negotiate peace.Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!

 Israel has for decades pursued a policy of constructing Jewish settlements on 
territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbours, including 
the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.

 Most countries view Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and East 
Jerusalem as illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel disagrees, citing a 
biblical connection to the land.
