Aaron Rodgers threw a 36-yard pass to a toe-dragging Jared Cook on the 
sideline, and Mason Crosby kicked a 51-yard field goal as time expired, sending 
the Packers to the NFC championship game with their eighth straight win while 
thwarting a huge Dallas rally in a 34-31 victory in the divisional round of the 
playoffs on Sunday.

The throw on the run from Rodgers to Cook — confirmed on review — wasn’t 
nearly as debatable as Dez Bryant’s famous catch that wasn’t in the Cowboys’ 
divisional round loss to Green Bay two years ago.Cook kept both feet inbounds

And it came after the Cowboys tied the game twice in the final five minutes 
behind rookies Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott in their playoff debut.

It was the third field goal of more than 50 yards in the final 1:38 — two from 
Crosby and one from Dallas’ Dan Bailey. And Crosby had to make the winner twice 
after Dallas coach Jason Garrett called timeout before the first attempt.

Rodgers, who sparked last week’s wildcard win over the New York Giants with 
another Hail Mary before half-time

, is headed to an MVP showdown with Atlanta’s Matt Ryan next Sunday. It will be 
his third NFC title game — all on the road.

Green Bay’s win was the first by a road team after 12 straight home victories 
in the playoffs dating to last season.

“Unbelievable effort. I mean, what a game, what a game,” said Rodgers, who 
threw for 356 yards with two touchdowns. “We’re going to celebrate this and 
move on to Atlanta. We’re just going to enjoy this right now.”

The Cowboys almost became the third team in the Super Bowl era to win in the 
playoffs after trailing by 15 points in the fourth quarter. The first was 
Dallas in 1972, when Captain Comeback, Roger Staubach, rallied the Cowboys for 
a 30-28 win over San Francisco. Instead, Dallas ended up with their fifth 
straight loss in the divisional round and a 21-year drought in trips to the NFC 
championship game.

Prescott got the Dallas rally going with a 40-yard touchdown toss in the first 
half to Bryant, the first playoff TD for the star receiver. Then he set the 
stage for the first tying score on a six-yarder to Jason Witten, also the first 
postseason touchdown for the 14th-year tight end.

Rodgers led the Packers to a go-ahead 56-yard field goal from Crosby with a 
big boost on a pass interference penalty against rookie Anthony Brown that 
wiped out an interception from Jeff Heath, whose pick earlier in the game 
helped Dallas rally.

The Cowboys answered with a 52-yarder from Bailey.
