“That is true,” he said. “They didn’t use it.” 

Springsteen said he wrote the song for his eldest son. “It was a big ballad 
that was very uncharacteristic of something I’d sing myself,” he added. “But it 
was something that I thought would have fit lovely.”

Springsteen said he he’s still hoping to have it included in a “children’s 
movie of some sort because it was a pretty lovely song”.

According to Springsteen fan forum BruceBase wiki 
<https://brucebase.wikispaces.com/The+Rising+-+Studio+Sessions>, the song 
possibly dates as far back as 1998, and was inspired by Springsteen’s 
experience reading the Harry Potter novels to his son. The site alleges that 
Springsteen offered the song to director Chris Columbus, who directed the first 
Harry Potter installment, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in 2001. Author 
JK Rowling is said to have had a contract stipulation that prevented the use of 
commercial songs in the Harry Potter films.

On Wednesday, members of Trainspotting’s crew claimed that Oasis turned down 
the chance to feature on the soundtrack for the classic because Noel Gallagher 
presumed the film was about actual trainspotters rather than an adaptation of 
Irvine Welsh’s black comedy about heroin addiction in Edinburgh.
