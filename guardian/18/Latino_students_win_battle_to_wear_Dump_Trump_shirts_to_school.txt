For months, 16-year-old Angelina Alvarez of Costa Mesa, California, has heard 
the message loud and clear from Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic>
:Mexicans are rapists and criminals; illegal immigrants should go home; 
infectious diseases are pouring across the border from Mexico.

It’s a message of xenophobia that has been drilled home not just from Trump’s 
pulpit on the campaign trail, but closer to home for Angelina at Newport Harbor 
high school.

Since last fall, Newport Harbor students who are Trump supporters have worn 
their politics on their T-shirts at school, which is 38% Latino and 52% white. 
But Angelina and her friends became particularly alarmed last week when 
anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, derogatory graffiti was chalked throughout the 
campus including the words “fuck illegal aliens”, “wetbacks” and a heart drawn 
alongside Trump’s name.

“With Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, 
[students] are more open about their hate and the things they say,” Angelina 
said.

After the anti-Trump protests last week, where one of Angelina’s 13-year-old 
friends was choked and punched, the Latino students had had enough – she and 
half a dozen of her friends wore Dump Trump T-shirts to school on Friday to 
make their feelings known.

But the school was not happy. 

At the end of her math class a security guard showed up. The principal, Sean 
Boulton, wanted to see Angelina in the main office – and he wanted her to 
change out of the Dump Trump shirt.

Boulton insisted that they remove the shirts for their own safety. But that 
argument didn’t make sense to the students, who felt they were being held to a 
double standard. After all, their Trump-supporting classmates had worn their 
pro-Trump shirts on campus since the start of the school year.

“They’ve worn the shirts all this time, and we wear a shirt for one period and 
we get called up right away,” Angelina said. “It’s not like we’re doing 
anything violent. We’re just standing up for ourselves.”

For Angelina and her classmates, the issue went beyond T-shirts. They told 
administrators that the derogatory graffiti, some of it still visible on 
Friday, and other incidents on campus, such as verbal harassment, had made them 
feel like they were under attack.

Boulton said the school had addressed the graffiti by removing it but was 
unaware that other students had targeted and harassed Angelina and her 
classmates with racial slurs.

“There’s certainly a lot of things that go on on campus that are inappropriate 
… and as information surfaces we don’t just ignore it. We react and we’re 
proactive in trying to resolve it,” Boulton said.

Newport Harbor high school is not alone in dealing with this heightened 
tension on campus. A national school survey conducted by the Southern Poverty 
Law Center and released last month found that teachers have encountered a spike 
in “the bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, 
religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates”.

As the Poynter Institute’s media and medical ethicists pointed out last year: 
“Such speech is a classic ploy to sow divisiveness and generate fear. That his 
message finds a home at all should be alarming. It’s one thing [to] argue about 
immigration policies. It’s a completely different thing to condemn an entire 
ethnic group.”

different thing to condemn an entire ethnic group

Brendan Hamme, a staff attorney with the ACLU of southern California 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california>, explained via email that 
students’ free speech protections are robust under California’s education code, 
even more so than the US constitution.

“Simply wearing T-shirts that say Dump Trump is quintessential protected 
political speech, and nothing about it incites others to break the rules or 
disrupt the campus,” wrote Hamme, who focuses his work on civil rights and 
civil liberties.

The students are now allowed to wear the T-shirts. But had they not taken a 
stance, the girls believe that those who felt threatened or harassed by Trump 
supporters would have remained silent.

“We opened up a lot of eyes and we showed people that they can have voices 
too.”
