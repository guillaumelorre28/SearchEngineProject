Transvolta – Disco Computer

This Belgian disco number is a fine example of the vocoder’s primary usage in 
the 1970s – particularly in disco. Nothing says unearthly, futuristic and robot 
like the fine-tuned waveforms of a vocoder. Should you like this track, be sure 
to check outDan Lacksman <http://danlacksman.be/>’s other, perhaps better-known 
project,Telex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telex_(band)>.

Laurie Anderson – O Superman

This track is all about the vocoder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/19/how-we-made-laurie-anderson-o-superman>
. Laurie’s own voice is blended with that of the vocoder – which plays both 
melody and chords. And it is this combination that makes for a haunting, almost 
eerie yet beautiful atmosphere. Trainspotters will no doubt notice that the 
vocoder in question (Roland VP 330) also supplies the string sounds for this 
amazing composition.

Röyksopp – Thank You

Yes, we deserve a spot on this list. The vocoders are an integral part of our 
sound and they have been there ever since we first started making electronic 
music all the way back in 1988. We’re particularly fond of this track due to 
the vocoder’s clear diction and warmth.

Mr Flagio – Take a Chance

Italodisco at its finest! Making a vocoder sound as sexy as this is quite 
hard. But Mr Flagio pushed the right buttons (ah!) and said the right words, 
making this both a vocoder and Italo classic.

Kraftwerk – The Robots

No surprise, really. The embodiment of the vocoder. The conceptual ideas of 
Kraftwerk help to underline the notion that this is a robot singing. This blew 
our minds as kids – and although it’s become ubiquitous over the years, it has 
earned its status. It still does the trick.
