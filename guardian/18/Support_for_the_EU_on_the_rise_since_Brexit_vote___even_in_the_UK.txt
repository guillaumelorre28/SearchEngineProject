Support for the EU has risen across Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, including in the UK, since the 
British people voted to leave.


Pro-EU sentiment has grown in five of the six largest member states, according 
to asurvey 
<https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/user_upload/EZ_flashlight_europe_02_2016_EN.pdf>
 by the Bertelsmann Foundation. These were the UK, France, Germany, Poland and 
Italy. The only large state to see a fall in support for the EU was Spain.


“The looming Brexit seems to have been the best advertisement for the EU,” 
said Aart De Geus, of the Bertelsmann Foundation, Germany’s largest NGO.

In the UK referendum

on 23 June, the country narrowly voted to leave the EU, with 52% voting leave 
while 48% supported remain.

But the Bertelsmann survey, completed in August against a backdrop of 
confusion about the British government’s Brexit strategy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/30/brexit-weekly-briefing-splits-over-timing-of-talks-and-single-market-membership>
, showed that 56% of British citizens wanted to stay in the EU, compared with 
49% when a similar survey was conducted in March.

According to the poll, enthusiasm for EU membership is slightly stronger in 
the UK thanFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> or Italy where 53% 
and 51% respectively voiced approval. These figures were a modest rise from 
earlier in the year.


Support is strongest in Poland, the biggest beneficiary of European funds: the 
EU had a 77% approval rating in the latest poll, compared with 68% in March.
Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> was in second place, with 
69% expressing approval for the European project, up from 61%.

Support did slip in Spain <https://www.theguardian.com/world/spain>, albeit 
from above-average levels: approval fell to 68% in August, down from 71%.


Across the EU as a whole, 62% want their state to remain a member, up from 57% 
in March. Researchers contacted more than 10,000 people in all EU countries.

The survey comes amid continuing uncertainty over Britain’s future status with 
the EU, with Theresa May’s governmentyet to express one view on whether the UK 
should remain in the single market or customs union

.


With negotiations unlikely to begin before April 2017, the EU27 – the other 27 
nations of the EU not including the UK – has been able to unite on the view 
that the UK cannot have access to the single market without accepting free 
movement of people.

Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German 
Bundestag,told the Observer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/19/europes-leaders-force-uk-hard-brexit-farage-le-pen>
 this weekend that he wanted to help the UK, but the British needed to be ready 
to compromise. He said: “I am really ready to come to a result but if [the 
British position is] no, no, no, then even I would have to say that there is no 
common ground.”
