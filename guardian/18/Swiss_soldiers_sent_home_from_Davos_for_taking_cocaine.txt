The twelve, among some 4,500 soldiers brought in to ensure security at the 
World Economic Forum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/19/davos-super-rich-wealth-inequality>
 this week, had been tested after others in their unit raised the alarm.

Using drug-sniffing dogs, military police had also discovered that one of the 
soldiers had more than three grammes of cocaine in his possession, according to 
the report.

That soldier was sent home and will face criminal charges, according to the 
army spokesman.

The other troops who tested positive for cocaine were also sent home and will 
face sanctions, while those who had only smoked cannabis were allowed to remain 
in Davos, but would face disciplinary measures on site, ATS reported.

The soldiers were all in the same unit, made up of troops essentially from the 
southern Swiss cantons of Ticino and Graubunden.
