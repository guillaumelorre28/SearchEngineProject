Last week, the government announced plans to introduce a series of measures to 
crack down on reckless drone usersfollowing a string of near-misses with 
aircraft

In November, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) launched a website to publish 
its revised code of conduct for drone users,labelled the dronecode

Former RAF and British Airways pilot Steve Landells, a flight safety 
specialist at the British Airline Pilots Association, said he expected to see 
an increase in drone use after Christmas and warned that “not everyone who is 
flying them either knows or cares about the rules”.

Landells, who has previously warned that a drone hitting an airliner could 
result in an uncontrollable engine failure or a smashed cockpit windscreen, 
added: “While we take no issue with people who fly their drones in a safe and 
sensible manner, some people who fly them near airports or densely populated 
areas are behaving dangerously.

“We’re urging anyone who receives a drone as a Christmas present to take a 
look at the CAA’s dronecode and be proactive in educating themselves before 
flying it.”

Under CAA rules, drones must not be flown above 400ft (122 metres) or within 
150ft (46 metres) of people or property.

They must also be kept at least 500ft (152 metres) away from crowds and 
built-up areas, and must not fly over such locations at any height.

ACC Steve Barry, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for drones, urged 
anyone receiving one as a Christmas present to visit the dronesafe.uk website 
before using it.

He said: “We are keen to ensure that people who operate drones are aware of 
the law and follow the appropriate user guidelines. Both the police and the CAA 
are working closely to keep drone use within the law and will robustly 
prosecute any users who fly them in a way that puts others at risk.”

Jonathan Nicholson, an assistant director at the CAA, said: “Drone users have 
to understand that when taking to the skies they are potentially flying close 
to one of the busiest areas of airspace in the world. It is a complex system 
that brings together all manner of aircraft including passenger aeroplanes, 
military jets, helicopters, gliders and light aircraft.

“We want people to enjoy their new drones but use their common sense and 
remember that anyone operating a drone must do so responsibly.”

Over the past year, 59 cases of near-misses involving drones and aircraft have 
featured in UK AirproxBoard (UKAB) reports.

In one serious incident, a drone the size of a football was flown around 20 
metres from an Airbus A320 passenger jet on 4 August. The first officer shouted 
“look!” as the device passed next to the right wing at about 11,000ft above 
south-east London, according to a UKAB report.

Among the proposals being consulted on are the introduction of a safety test 
and mandatory registration of drones. Ministers are also considering 
introducing tougher penalties for flying in restricted areas, such as near 
airports and prisons.
