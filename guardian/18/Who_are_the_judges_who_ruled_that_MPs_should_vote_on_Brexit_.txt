is a forthright defender of judicial independence and a supporter of 
modernisation in the courts where cases are still conducted from behind mounds 
of files and paperwork.

Born in Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> – he remains a supporter 
of courts outside London – Lord Thomas was educated at Rugby school and Trinity 
Hall,Cambridge, <https://www.theguardian.com/education/cambridgeuniversity> 
where he read law. He started off practising in commercial cases, became a QC 
and an assistant recorder (part-time judge) in 1984.

court fees driving away international legal business from London and preventing 
access to justice.
