While continuing in the subdued, synth-heavy vein of 2013’s The Terror, the 
15th album from Oklahoma psychedelicists theFlaming Lips 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-flaming-lips> is at least less lyrically 
bleak, its conceptual arc encompassing freely defecating green-eyed unicorns, 
sleep and futuristic drugs. Rich in interesting R&B-influenced textures, its 
songs too often fail to engage, particularly on a ponderous second half. And 
there’s still no solution to the recurring problem they’ve had since ditching 
the (often cloying) euphoria of theirlate 90s/early 00s commercial peak

: the vocal shortcomings of Wayne Coyne – a man with a voice only Ian Brown’s 
mother could love – seem so much more exposed. Indeed, it’s telling that the 
strongest song here is the closing We a Famly, on which he’s helped out by 
Miley Cyrus.
