Last week we brought you news of yet another instalment in the mighty Led 
Zeppelin reissue programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/19/led-zeppelin-complete-bbc-sessions-compilation>
: this time, the rock titans are putting out an expanded remastered edition of 
their BBC Sessions. Among the music are eight previously unreleased Zeppelin 
recordings, and we’ve got one of them here for you.

This version of Communication Breakdown was recorded on 1 April 1971 at the 
BBC’s Paris theatre in central London, and broadcast on the BBC’s In Concert 
programme on 4 April 1971 – since when it has never been officially available. 
This version stretches to nearly five minutes, the best part of two minutes 
longer than any of the versions that appeared on the original BBC Sessions 
album.

Have a listen, and let us know what you think.
