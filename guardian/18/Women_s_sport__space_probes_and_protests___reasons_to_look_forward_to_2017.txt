The year looks stellar for women’s big sporting events: 2017 sees the cricket 
and rugby world cups, and theUefa Women’s Euro football championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/08/uefa-womens-euro-2017-finals-draw-live>
. “Therugby world cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/05/england-womens-rugby-rfu-plan-world-cup>
 is particularly exciting for England fans because we’re the defending 
champions,” says Ruth Holdaway, chief executive ofWomen in Sport 
<https://www.womeninsport.org/>. “One of the reasons the cricket world cup is 
exciting isit’s being held in the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/08/lord-host-2017-icc-womens-world-cup-final>
 and people can go and watch the best female cricketers in the world. And 
again, England are a very good team and there is a real opportunity for them to 
do very well. In football, the Lionesses did so well at the [2015] world cup, 
bringing backthe bronze medal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/28/englands-victory-a-game-changer-for-womens-football>
 – doing better than any male team have done since 1966 – so again there is a 
massive opportunity for them at the Euros.”

 March on … anti-Trump protesters in Los Angeles, California in November. 
Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Images 
Donald Trump’s inauguration on 20 January will likely see the first major 
protests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/27/womens-march-on-washington-dc-guide>
 of a year in which the demo could go mainstream. It’s not just in the US – 
cities around the world will hold solidarity protests. Demonstrations will be 
held in the UK, including in London, Birmingham and Leeds. On 20 February, the
One Day Without Us <http://www.1daywithoutus.org/> boycott will see immigrants 
in the UK, including EU migrants, and their supporters taking the day off work 
(in lieu of formal strike action) to show how vital their labour is. Then, on 
18 March,Stand Up to Racism 
<http://www.standuptoracism.org.uk/national-demo-refugees-migrants-welcome-stand-racism-islamophobia-anti-semitism/>
 is staging a demonstration for the UN’s anti-racism day.

A note of caution, though: “I think the periods in which people have been 
willing to protest and engage tend to be periods in which there was an upward 
momentum, and a frustration of people being held back,” says Prof Christopher 
Rootes, director of the Centre for the Study of Social and Political Movements 
at the University of Kent. “There was an optimism about possibility, but I 
think [now] people are a bit more pessimistic.” What needs to be done in times 
like these? “I think the real problem is the rise ofpost-truth politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/16/not-post-truth-simpler-words-lies-aleppo-trump-mainstream>
 and people’s willingness to believe what they want to believe without 
considering whether there’s any substance to what they’re being told. The 
challenge is to be relentless in our insistence in calling out lies and 
misinformation. It’s not so much the fight against fascism as the fight against 
ignorance.”

It launched in 1997 and took seven years to get there, but 2017 marks the end 
of the Cassini spacecraft’smission to Saturn <https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/>. 
Last month, it began its exploration of Saturn’s outer rings. In April, it will 
swoop between the planet and its innermost ring in the part of the mission Nasa 
is calling “the grand finale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/29/cassini-spacecraft-to-begin-swansong-orbit-of-saturn>
”. There are other exciting space developments to come next year, including the 
possible launches of powerful telescopes, but there’s something tragic and 
tender about the demise of Cassini. In September, it will plunge towards Saturn 
and be vaporised. This is not a galactic commentary on our throwaway society, 
but a noble sacrifice – scientists don’t want to risk contaminating Saturn’s 
potentially life-hosting moons with any hardy microbes the craft could be 
harbouring. We’ve all but destroyed our world, let’s not start on others.

 No more surprises? … German chancellor Angela Merkel. Photograph: Tobias

Wishful thinking perhaps, but if Brexit didn’t teach our European friends that 
the only thing necessary for the triumph of rightwing demagogues is for good 
people to risk a protest vote, then maybe Trump’s victory will have. First up, 
the general election in the Netherlands, on 15 March – the far-rightGeert 
Wilders is leading the polls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/10/netherlands-geert-wilders-politics-far-right>
, but we shouldn’t panic yet because, firstly, nobody believes the polls any 
more, and secondly, he almost certainly won’t become prime minister because the 
Netherlands has coalition governments and other parties have ruled out working 
with him.

Likewise, France’s electoral system (in which the winner has to take more than 
50% of the popular vote) meansit is “extremely improbable” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/the-fear-of-marine-le-pen-will-the-next-political-earthquake-happen-in-france>
, say observers, that the Front National leader Marine Le Pen will become 
president in May. Following the Berlin terror attack, immigration looks set to 
become a main topic in the run-up toGermany’s election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/06/german-election-angela-merkel-to-rally-party-ahead-of-fight-with-far-right>
 later in the year, but despite the rise of a populist anti-immigrant party, 
Angela Merkel is still widely predicted to hold on to power. Shock victories 
are so 2016.
