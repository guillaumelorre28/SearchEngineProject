Sydney’s lockout laws, Australian marriage equality and a surprise appearance 
fromKylie Minogue <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue> were the big 
talking points at the 30th annual Aria awards, otherwise dominated by the 
electronic music wunderkind Flume.

The 25-year-old Sydney electronic producer whose real name is Harley Streten, 
picked up five of the pointy statues, winning best male artist, album of the 
year and best independent release for hissophomore album Skin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/29/flume-skin-review-raekwon-alunageorge-little-dragon-vince-staples-harley-edward-streten-never-be>
, as well as best dance release and best pop release forNever Be Like You 
<http://www.vevo.com/watch/flume/Never-Be-Like-You-feat-Kai-Official-Music-Video/AUFF81500784>
.

Flume had already won all three artisan categories – best producer, engineer 
and cover art of the year –when nominations were announced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/05/aria-awards-2016-flume-dominates-with-11-nominations>
 in early October, bringing his total Aria awards to eight.

happened

In his acceptance speech for best dance release, Flume rallied against 
Sydney’s controversial lockout laws, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/27/flume-releases-new-track-and-video-in-support-of-keep-sydney-open-campaign>
 which he said had curtailed opportunities for young musicians that he himself 
had benefitted from.

Wearing a pin in support of the Keep Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> Open campaign, he thanked 
the venues at which he’d performed, “especially the small ones ... because 
that’s where music evolves, that’s where all the exciting stuff happens, and 
that’s what’s getting shut down right now”.

“To our policy-makers and our politicians, please keep Sydney open so that the 
young artists, so that the next generations of musicians, can have the same 
opportunities that I had,” he told Guardian Australia on the red carpet.

Now in its 30th year, the Australian Recording Industry Association awards 
were held at Sydney’s Star event centre from Wednesday afternoon and later 
broadcast onChannel Ten <https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel-ten>.

Sarah Blasko, who won the best adult alternative album award for Eternal Return
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/06/sarah-blasko-eternal-return-review-swathed-in-melancholia-cast-in-desire>
, and Montaigne, named breakthrough artist, were also critical of the lockout 
laws.

“As a musician I’ve enjoyed many late nights of playing shows, and dancing 
like a moron at late hours,” Blasko told media backstage. “It’s been an 
important part of my development as a human being.

“Culturally it’s very important for people to be able to experience the city 
at all hours, and for people to be able to address the drinking problems as 
separate – not one and the same as a late night.”

The Perth YouTube star turned singer Troye Sivan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/troye-sivan>, 21, claimed his wins for his 
song Youth – which took out best video and song of the year – as victories for 
the LGBTQI community.

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2016/nov/23/aria-awards2016-in-pictures>
He later told media that the only obstruction to marriage equality in 
Australia seemed to be politicians, and that it was “only a matter of time” 
before the law was passed.

“Socially it feels like Australia is an amazing, progressive, open, inclusive 
country and I’m so proud to be from here – and it just kind of sucks that it 
doesn’t feel like that’s represented politically.

“What I can do is just keep pushing the envelope as far as the opinion of the 
public goes. And that’s what I’m going to try and keep doing.”

Sivan’s resolution was reinforced later when Sia’s award for best female 
artist was accepted on behalf of Angie Broome, a marriage equality campaigner, 
who said it was for “every single non-hetero and gender-diverse person who can 
currently not marry the person that they love in this country”.

Kylie Minogue and her British fiance, Joshua Sasse, who both made a surprise 
appearance to present an award, also rallied on behalf of Sasse’scampaign to 
Say “I Do” Down Under 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/03/margot-robbie-backs-australian-marriage-equality-on-saturday-night-live>
, with Sasse adding that 2017 could be the year Australia is “back on the right 
side of history”.

Marriage equality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/same-sex-marriage-australia> and Sydney’s 
lockout laws mobilised the crowd more than many of the performances did, with 
Crowded House raising one of the biggest responses of the night with their 
induction into the Aria Hall of Fame.

Flight of the Conchords, Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement, eventually 
presented the award after some territorial posturing over frontman Neil Finn’s 
hailing from New Zealand.

“We can’t let this happen. You have enough bands in Australia,” said Clement.

“We really need Crowded House, our musical Hall of Fame is more of a Doorway 
of Fame. So stop it Australia,” said McKenzie.

After an acceptance speech from Finn, in which he remembered Paul Hester, the 
band’s drummer who died in Melbourne in 2005, Missy Higgins and Bernard Fanning 
performed Crowded House classics Fall at Your Feet and Better Be Home Soon.

Crowded House – still in black tie, which, for Finn, constituted a very purple 
suit – then performed Distant Sun from the band’s 1993 album Together Alone.

On Thursday the band will begin a string of performances at the Sydney Opera 
House forecourt 20 years after their Farewell to the World concert that was 
attended for free by more than 100,000 fans. In contrast, the four ticketed 
concerts Crowded House will play from Thursday to Sunday will be capped at just 
6,000 punters a night, Finn said.

“[1996] was a time when there was a complete absence of health and safety,” 
Finn told media. “It’s a wonder that no one died. People look after each other 
in those situations – and it’s nice when a population can be trusted.”

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/nov/24/highlights-from-the-30th-aria-awards-video>
He said the band was “determined to make those shows sing and fly and be as 
good as – if not better than – what we were like 20 years ago”.

Finn had condemned Australia’s “detention and mistreatment of asylum seekers 
[as] completely unacceptable” before he performed with Paul Kelly at the Aria 
awards in 2014.

“It’s still the same,” he said on Wednesday. “It seems like a very strange 
place to be commenting on it but it’s a deeply concerning thing. It really is.”

John Butler and Ben Lee, who appeared on stage together to present the Aria 
for best male artist, acknowledged the traditional custodians of the land, with 
Lee adding: “We also want to use this opportunity to say we stand with Standing 
Rock.”

The only other act to win more than one Aria award on Wednesday was the 
Brisbane alternative rock band Violent Soho, who were named best group and best 
rock album for WACO.

John Farnham closed the event with his 30-year-old ballad, You’re The Voice – 
described as “Australia’s unofficial anthem” by hosts the Veronicas, who bowed 
down before the singer whose 1986 album Whispering Jack is still the 
biggest-selling Australian album of all time.
