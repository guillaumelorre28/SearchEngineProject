It is nicknamed the “Space Egg”: an ethereal oval-shaped structure in a box 
that glows in the dark. Officially it is the Europa building, the new 
headquarters for EU leaders, due to host its first ministerial meeting on 
Monday.

Costing about €321m (£283m), this ultramodern, eco-friendly building has 
inevitably become a symbol of theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> – for supporters and critics alike. And 
it is inside the glass egg – called a lantern by its designer – that Britain’s 
Brexit fate is likely to be sealed.

When Theresa May goes to Brussels in the hope of negotiating her red, white 
and blue Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/theresa-may-calls-for-red-white-and-blue-brexit>
, she will face 27 other leaders in a vividly technicoloured room. Carpets and 
ceilings look like a child’s kaleidoscope and are intended to symbolise the 
“united patchwork” of Europe.

The Europa building was conceived in happier times, when Brexit was an 
eccentric idea on the fringes of the Conservative party, the Greek economy was 
booming and labour market economists fretted about littlefree movement of people
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/freedom-of-movement-eu-uk-brexit-negotiations-theresa-may>
 across Europe’s internal borders.


The construction of the headquarters was approved in 2004, when the EU 
expanded from 15 to 25 countries, taking in much of central and easternEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> in one bound, then rising to 28 
countries by 2013. Multiple crises have made the demands for space more 
pressing: EU leaders held a record 15 summits in 2015, compared with the 
earlier average of four.

The building is not just for summits, but the daily meetings of the council of 
ministers, the EU’s most powerful and least-understood institution. Ministers, 
diplomats and a small army of interpreters are in near-permanent session, 
holding more than 6,000 meetings a year, fromhaggling over fish stocks

.


For Eurosceptics the building is, inevitably, a symbol of EU waste. When he 
was prime minister, David Cameronexpressed his “immense frustration” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/24/david-cameron-brochure-eu-bulding>
 about the cost but failed to put a stop to the project. For the EU’s builders, 
the headquarters was intended to be a symbol of everything good about Europe: 
eco-friendly, transparent, united in diversity.

Solar panels cover the roof, rainwater flushes the toilets, the windows are 
framed by a lattice of recycled wood sourced from every corner of the EU. 
Neither has the past been obliterated: Europa incorporates a much older 
building – the Résidence Palace, built as art deco luxury flats in the 1920s, 
later commandeered to be the Nazis’ headquarters in Belgium, before eventually 
becoming offices.

Glowing in the dark, glinting in the occasional Belgian sunshine, Europa is a 
more thoughtfully crafted building than its nondescript predecessor, which was 
built on a bulldozed corner of older Brussels. The Justus Lipsius building, 
which will remain in use, could be the headquarters of a publicity-shy bank. A 
squat pinkish building, the windows are small and impossible to see through.

In contrast, the new EU headquarters has 3,750 windows made from ultra-clear 
glass. But the symbolism is misleading. The cameras will remain mostly switched 
off and the public will not be any better informed about what is said in 
Europe’s most powerful decision-making chambers.


Its designer, Belgian architect Philippe Samyn, also points to the symbolism 
of the building’s location, next to a traffic-clogged main road, with metro and 
overground trains running underneath. Europa is part of a working city, he 
says, not set in splendid isolation like the Kremlin or the White House.

As for the colours: “I wanted to make a friendly building, a joyful building 
where [leaders] would feel at home,” he said, contrasting the round meeting 
rooms with “authoritarian” squares and rectangles.


It might not feel very friendly or joyful if you are the British prime 
minister arguing alone against 27 abouta €60bn Brexit bill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/eus-chief-divorce-negotiator-michel-barnier-to-make-first-brexit-statement>
 in the small hours of the morning. One day, the union flag will be dismantled 
and the United Kingdom placemark cleared away. But a little bit of Britain will 
stay in Brussels. British oak timbers in the main facade will frame Europe’s 
Space Egg for years to come.
