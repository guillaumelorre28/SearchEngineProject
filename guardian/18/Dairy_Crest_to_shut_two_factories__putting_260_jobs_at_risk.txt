Dairy Crest <https://www.theguardian.com/business/dairycrestgroup> is closing 
two factories in an attempt to cut costs, putting 260 jobs at risk.

The Surrey-based company will close a glass-bottling plant in Hanworth, west 
London and a cream potting facility in Chard, Somerset, as part of measures to 
save £20m a year.

The maker of Cathedral City cheese and Country Life butter also warned that 
its dairies business would post a loss in the six months to 30 September.

Dairy Crest said its Hanworth bottling plant, which employs around 200 people, 
would close in two years.

The firm said the site had suffered from consumer preference for buying milk 
in plastic containers rather than in glass bottles. It said that in 1975 around 
94% of milk came in glass bottles, but this had fallen to just 4% by 2012.

The company told its 1,400 milkmen and women that it was doing all it could to 
maintain its doorstep delivery business.

But it said the dairy markets had been extremely volatile, with cream prices 
down 40% from last autumn’s peak and both cream and skimmed milk powder prices 
falling 15% last month. Shares fell more than 3%.

Dairy Crest will shut its Chard facility, which employs around 60 people, in 
the second half of 2015 as the firm said it was not economically viable.

Chief executive Mark Allen said: “The decisions to consult on the closure of 
our Hanworth and Chard sites have not been taken lightly, but they are right 
for the long term future of the business as a whole. We will do all we can to 
help employees who may be affected by these proposals.”

But Dairy Crest added in a trading update that sales of its four key brands – 
Clover, Cathedral City, FRijj and Country Life – grew 4% in the first quarter 
to the end of March compared to a year ago, and expected a similar rate of 
growth in the first half.
