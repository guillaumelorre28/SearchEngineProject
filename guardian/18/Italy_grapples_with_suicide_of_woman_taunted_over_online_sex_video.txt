.


Tiziana Cantone, 31, was found dead at her aunt’s home in Mugnano, close to 
Naples in the country’s south, on Tuesday. Her funeral procession was televised 
as commentators grappled with the tragic outcome of her torment.

Cantone’s death came a year after she sent a sex video of herself to some 
friends including an ex-boyfriend .

The video was subsequently posted on the web and viewed almost a million 
times. The phrase “You’re filming? Bravo”, spoken to her lover in the video, 
became a derisive joke online and was printed on T-shirts, smartphone cases and 
other items.

In a bid to escape the humiliation Cantone quit her job, moved to Tuscany and 
tried to change her name .


After a long court battle she won a “right to be forgotten” ruling ordering 
the video to be removed from various sites and search engines including 
Facebook.


But she was also ordered to pay €20,000 in legal costs, in what several 
Italian media outlets dubbed a final insult .

“Why are these images still there? Why can people still mock and laugh at this 
young woman who ended her days because of this humiliation that she suffered?” 
wrote Naples daily Il Mattino .

Prosecutors in Naples have opened an investigation into “incitement to 
suicide”, while reports said four men were being investigated.
