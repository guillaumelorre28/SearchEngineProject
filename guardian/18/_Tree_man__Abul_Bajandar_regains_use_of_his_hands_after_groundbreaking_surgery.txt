A Bangladeshi father dubbed the “tree man” because of the bark-like warts that 
once covered his body will soon be able to leave hospital after groundbreaking 
treatment for one of the world’s rarest diseases.


Abul Bajandar has undergone at least 16 operations to remove 5kg (11 pounds) of
growths from his hands and feet

‘Tree man’ Abul Bajandar set for life-changing surgery in Bangladesh

The 27-year-old former rickshaw driver is one of only four people in the world 
to be diagnosed with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, an extremely rare genetic 
condition dubbed “tree-man disease” that left him unable to hold his 
three-year-old daughter.

“Bajandar’s cure was a remarkable milestone in the history of medical 
science,” said Samanta Lal Sen, plastic surgery coordinator at Dhaka Medical 
College hospital.

“We operated on him at least 16 times to remove the warts. The hands and feet 
are now almost fine. He will be discharged within the next 30 days after a 
couple of minor surgeries to perfect the shape of his hands,” Sen said.

Sen believes Bajandar could become the first person to be cured of the 
disease, provided the warts do not grow back.

Last year an Indonesian man died of the rare genetic condition. 

Speaking from his bed at the hospital, which has been treating him free of 
charge, Bajandar said the pain of his condition had been unbearable.

“I never thought I would ever be able to hold my kid with my hands,” he said, 
showing a bandaged hand. “Now I feel so much better. I can hold my daughter in 
my lap and play with her. I can’t wait to go back home.”

The plight of Bajandar, who comes from a village in the southern coastal 
district of Khulna, was brought to wider attention after his condition was 
widely covered in local and international media.

He met his wife, Halima Khatun, before he contracted the disease, but it had 
taken hold by the time they married – the union took place against her parents’ 
wishes.

All three have lived in the hospital since he was admitted for the first 
surgery nearly a year ago.

“He is probably the most loved and longest-staying patient in this hospital,” 
said duty doctor Nurun Nahar.

Bajandar initially thought the warts were harmless, but they eventually 
covered his hands and feet, forcing him to stop working.

Now he plans to set up a small business using donations received from 
well-wishers across the world.

“I was so worried about raising my daughter,” he said. “I hope the curse won’t 
return again.”
