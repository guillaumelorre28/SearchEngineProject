While there were some good things in technology released this year, there were 
also quite a few let downs. From detonating devices to damp squibs, these are 
the biggest let downs of 2016.

 Modular smartphones such as the LG G5 held so much promise and didn’t deliver. 
Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian 
The LG <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/lg> G5 promised so much, but 
delivered little. As a smartphone, it is a decent if not spectacular entry, 
with dual cameras on the back and solid specifications. But it was the slot in 
the bottom of the smartphone that got the hype cycle churning.

It was the first modular smartphone from a big-name brand. The G5’s chin and 
battery could be swapped for fresh cells, a set of speakers, a camera control 
and extended battery grip and a few other so-called Friends.

The trouble was the “friends” were few and far between and those that actually 
arrived weren’t that great. On paper it was great, in practice it didn’t work. 
But the G5 wasn’t the only modular smartphone to fail last year,Google also 
pulled the plug on its Project Ara

 modular phone while Lenovo’s Motorola released theMoto Z 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/10/lenovo-smartphone-terminator-vision-project-tango>
 with add-ons that slightly more elegantly magnetically attached to the back. 
Whether anyone bought the add-ons though remains to be seen.

After four years of waiting for anything more meaningful than a specification 
bump, the new2016 13in MacBook Pro arrived 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/apple-macbook-pro-review-the-best-computer-you-shouldnt-buy>
. It was thinner, lighter, had a better screen and was slightly more powerful 
than the last one released in 2015. It had a new-fangled “Touch Bar” instead of 
traditional F and control keys. It even had Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint 
scanner, a headphones port and a starting £1,749 price tag.

What it didn’t have were any data ports other than USB-C - no traditional USB, 
no ethernet, no Mini DisplayPort, no HDMI or even a MagSafe power connector. 
There were four USB-C ports ready to accept a plethora of dongles. Any of them 
could also be used for power, which is a good thing as the battery life was 
pretty poor.

It’s certainly beautiful, but after four years in the making, style without 
substance didn’t cut it for even some die-hardApple

 The Galaxy Note 7 started well but ended up a hot potato. Photograph: Samuel 
Gibbs for the Guardian 
Life for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 started so promisingly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/samsung-galaxy-note-7-review-the-king-of-the-phablets-returns>
. It was a cutting-edge device, worked brilliantly, garnered praise from all 
sides and even had an iris scanner - one of the first smartphones to do so. It 
was predicted to sell in the millions, to propel Samsung to even higher heights 
and cement the South Korean brand’s lead in big-screened smartphones.

That was until one exploded. Then another and another. A halt to sales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/02/samsung-recall-galaxy-note-7-reports-of-smartphones-catching-fire>
 was called for safety concerns around the battery. It was pulled from shelves 
and the UK launch was cancelled.

A fix was applied and the offending batteries taken out before being 
relaunched. The problem was that the replacement Note 7s started catching fire 
too. The numbers were small, but the risk was great. EventuallySamsung pulled 
the plug and terminated the Note 7 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/samsung-galaxy-note-7-exploding-battery-safety-concerns>
. Even still some users refused to give up the phone. Samsung was forced to 
hobble it before rendering it inoperative with a software update.

There the sad tale of the Note 7 ended. Pushing boundaries in design and 
technology can win you plaudits and sales, butSamsung 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/samsung> pushed too far this time.

It was heralded as the best VR for normal people. PlayStation VR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/06/playstation-vr-review-theres-magic-but-the-mainstream-is-a-way-off>
 promised to bring great virtual reality experiences only possible on a 
desktop-class system but without the need for a £1,000 PC to run it.

The trouble was that it lacked the best-in-class controllers that really made 
VR in 2016. It was cheap and provided a cheap experience. And a cheap VR 
experience just didn’t cut it. Whether that will be enough to see it go 
mainstream in 2017 remains to be seen, but it certainly wasn’t the rip-roaring 
success many hoped it would be.

The highly anticipated 2016 edition of Apple’s flagship smartphone, the iPhone 
7 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/iphone-7-review-poor-battery-life>
, was meant to set the world alight. It was waterproof, had a much better 
camera and its Plus editioneven had two cameras on the back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/03/iphone-7-plus-review-apple-newest-smartphone-phablet>
. The physical home button was gone, instead using force touch and so was the 
headphone socket. But what the iPhone 7 will be remembered for will be its 
terrible battery life. Less is certainly not more when it comes to how long it 
lasts in a day, and constantly having to hunt for a charger gets old really 
quickly. Especially when you can’t even listen to a wired set of headphones and 
charge it at the same time.

 This is what Facebook wants so badly. Photograph: Alex Hern for the Guardian 
Snapchat <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/snapchat>. It’s an app. You 
share pictures with it, draw stupid things and can even discover news on it. 
It’s biggest asset is a younger audience than most other services, the untapped 
market so many are after, including Facebook, which keeps trying to clone it 
after failing in its attempt to buy it.

Facebook has tried to clone Snapchat, copying features and launching apps not 
once, not twice, not even three times. 2016 saw Facebook try to clone Snapchat 
for the seventh,eighth, ninth, tenth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/facebook-tries-to-clone-snapchat>
, eleventh, twelfth,thirteenth

 andfifteenth time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/facebook-copies-snapchat-feature-for-15th-time>
.

It’s getting old. Maybe Facebook should direct some of that engineering talent 
to working on morepressing matters

The Dyson Supersonic took the humble hairdryer and infused it with the 
vacuum-firms technology. A high speed fan in the handle for weight 
distribution, it’s trademark air multiplier head to blast air in your face, 
magnetically attaching nozzles and a round of digital buttons for controlling 
temperature and air speed. It looked like the hairdryer finally dragged kicking 
and screaming into the gadget age.

Sadly in group tests up against hairdryers half the Supersonic’s price it was 
found to be a lot of hot air. Attach a nozzle and all that fancy airflowdropped 
to a level “akin to blowing through a drinking straw”
