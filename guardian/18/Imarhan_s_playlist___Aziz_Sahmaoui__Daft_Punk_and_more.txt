Alla 

A sublime Algerian lute player. His music is poetry, inspiring and breathing. 
It is the perfect sound to rest to, or de-stress – music that reminds us of our 
desert and the big landscapes. The rhythm is very particular, unexpected and 
takes you out of yourself.

Aziz Sahmaoui 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/06/aziz-sahmaoui-university-of-gnawa-review>
 – Alf Hilat

This Moroccan artist is a stunning musician. His lyrics aren’t that obvious, 
but you get to understand them with time. They are enigmatic and make you 
think, before you realise they are very powerful.

Matadjem Yinmixan

Tinariwen are our very first musical memories, and this is one of our 
favourite tunes, among many. This is also the song we played at the very 
beginnings ofImarhan

Michael Jackson – Beat It 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/06/popandrock1>

We’ve always listened to him, through the TV, on the radio. He was and is 
everywhere, part of everyone and today’s culture. This is a great rock song and 
a stimulating call to dance.

Daft Punk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/19/daft-punk-release-a-new-album> – 
Giorgio ByMoroder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/may/29/giorgio-moroder-disco-pioneer-rides-again>

We discovered them a short time ago, we like their fusion of styles and the 
captivating development of this track. You can feel the high level of the 
musicians; there’s an alchemy we like in their playing and the construction of 
the music.
