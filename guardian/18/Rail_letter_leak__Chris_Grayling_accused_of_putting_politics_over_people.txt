Chris Grayling <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/chrisgrayling>, the 
transport secretary, has been accused of putting party politics above the 
interests of London commuters, after a leaked letter showed he once opposed 
devolution of suburban rail routes in case it put them “in the clutches of a 
Labour mayor”.

The transport secretary this week blocked a request 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/06/transport-for-london-plans-ditched-chris-grayling-sadiq-khan>
 by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, to hand control of the Southeastern 
commuter route to City Hall and Transport for London (TfL), saying there was no 
need for a massive reorganisation.

However, a letter leaked to the Evening Standard shows Grayling wrote to former
London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> mayor Boris Johnson in 2013 
opposing the idea of devolution for fear that a future Labour mayor would gain 
control of the transport links.


Some London MPs were furious about the letter, with Bob Neill, a Conservative 
former minister, saying Grayling should step down for prioritising party 
politics over the interests of his Bromley constituents.

“It’s pretty clear he has a dogmatic opposition to rail devolution and that’s 
not a legitimate basis to take a decision,” Neill told the Standard.


Theresa May’s spokesman said he had no comment on Neill’s view but that the 
prime minister had “absolute faith in the secretary of state and the work he is 
doing”.

Khan also expressed frustration at the fact Grayling blocked his request, 
despite Patrick McLoughlin, the former transport secretary, and Johnson 
striking a deal before the election to allow devolution when franchises come up 
for renewal.


“If I’m honest, I simply do not understand why the government is now so 
vehemently opposed to improving suburban rail services in London,” Khan said. 
“I sincerely hope it is not because they are reluctant to give control of these 
lines to a Labour mayor – commuters’ lives are far, far more important than 
party politics.”

Andy Burnham, the Labour MP, tweeted:

And Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, said it was a “disgraceful 
revelation” given that Grayling’s decision will leave commuters worse off.

“Labour’s mayor of London put forward a plan which would see commuters enjoy a 
better service and frozen fares,” he said. “We now see the Tories have blocked 
this progress for their own narrow political interest. It’s shameful and 
demonstrates that for all their bluster about caring about working people they 
always put themselves first.

“It’s no wonder even Tory MPs are calling for Chris Grayling to resign: he’s 
in serious hot water.”

The Department for Transport <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> had no 
comment on the leaked letter, but it pointed to Grayling’s remarks in the 
Commons on Tuesday setting out his reasons for refusing Khan’s bid for TfL to 
take over.

Neill had said his constituents would regard Grayling’s “failure to remove the 
London metro services from the wholly discredited Southeastern franchise as a 
complete copout and failure, and as making no sense at all”.

The transport secretary replied: “We will have the opportunity, between 
London, my department and Kent to design an improved franchise for the future.

“What I had to decide was whether the benefits set out in the mayor’s business 
plan, which did not involve increases in capacity on my honourable friend’s 
local routes into London, and the incremental improvements thatTransport for 
London <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_for_London> claimed it might be 
able to deliver were really worth putting his railway line through the biggest 
restructuring since the 1920s.


“My judgment is that we can achieve the benefits that TfL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/tfl> is arguing for through partnership, rather 
than through massive reorganisation, and that is my aim.”

It is understood ministers were concerned about the mayor of London being 
given control over services partly for people who could not vote for him, as 
the rail links run outside of the capital.


As part of the decision, Grayling offered to let both TfL and Kent county 
council work on the design of the new franchise.

The decision is only about the south-east franchise run by Southeastern 
Trains, so there may be opportunities for Khan to bid again in relation to 
other parts of London.
