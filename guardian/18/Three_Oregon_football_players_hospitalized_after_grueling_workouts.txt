At least three University of Oregon football players were hospitalized after a 
series of grueling off-season workouts last week, the Oregonian reported.

Offensive linemen Doug Brenner and Sam Poutasi and tight end Cam McCormick are 
in fair condition and remained at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at 
Riverbend in Springfield on Monday, a hospital spokeswoman told the newspaper.

Poutasi’s mother told the Oregonian that her son had complained of sore arms 
and had been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis, a syndrome in which soft muscle 
tissue is broken down with “leakage into the blood stream of muscle contents”, 
according to the NCAA’s medical handbook.

“The safety and welfare of all of our student-athletes is paramount in all 
that we do,” Oregon said in a news release.

“While we cannot comment on the health of our individual students, we have 
implemented modifications as we transition back into full training to prevent 
further occurrences. We thank our medical staff and trainers for their 
continued monitoring of the students and we will continue to support our young 
men as they recover. “

Multiple sources described the workouts to the Oregonian as “akin to military 
basic training, with one said to include up to an hour of continuous push-ups 
and up-downs”.

The workout was not even what the media is portraying it to be 🙄

Several Oregon players, including junior cornerback Ugochukwu Amadi, took to 
social media on Monday to downplay the severity of the workouts.

The Ducks are coming off a 4-8 season that saw them fail to qualify for a bowl 
game for the first time in 12 years. They were left to exercise on their own 
during their holiday break.

Oregon head coach Willie Taggart hired Irele Oderinde to be the team’s new 
football strength and conditioning coach earlier this month.
