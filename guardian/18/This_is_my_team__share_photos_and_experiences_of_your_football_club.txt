This weekend sees the start of the Football League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league> season, which is an 
ideal chance for you to showcase your club. As leagues kick off across England, 
Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, we would love to see the lesser spotted 
side of the game.

Whether your club plays at an old ground steeped in history or has recently 
moved to a new unfamiliar home, you can share photos of your stadium and 
describe what you like best about your team’s surroundings. Do you have any 
pre-match or post-match rituals you would like to share with us? Maybe you will 
be donning an old lucky shirt for the first game of the new season, or perhaps 
you have treated yourself to a new kit hoping it might help change your club’s 
fortunes?


We’d like to hear from football fans across Britain about your club and what 
it means to you, so share your photos and experiences via GuardianWitness and 
we will publish a selection of these in a gallery.
