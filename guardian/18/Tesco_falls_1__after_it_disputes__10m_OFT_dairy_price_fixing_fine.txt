Tesco shares have fallen back after the supermarket threatened legal action 
over a price-fixing fine.

The fine of £10.m on Tesco <https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco> is 
part of a wider £50m penalty slapped on supermarkets and milk companies by the 
Office of Fair Trading after it ruled there had been collusion over the price 
of cheese and milk. The scam - dating back to 2002 and 2003 - was said to have 
cost consumers around £270m.

The OFT's original fine of £116m was scaled back after a long period of 
consultation. Tesco continues to deny it colluded with the other companies, and 
now says it will defend its position through the courts.

The row has left its share price 3.3p lower at 366.85p, even though the actual 
size of the fine is miniscule compared to the company's annual sales.

The other UK listed companies involved are J Sainsbury, up 6.6p at 296.4p 
after Barclays raised its rating to overweight,Robert Wiseman, 10.75p better at 
308.75p, andDairy Crest, up 1.4p at 340p. Asda, Safeway, Arla, McLelland and 
The Cheese Company were also fined, with all but Tesco receiving lenient fines 
after admitting liability. Analysts at Espirito Santo said:
 Whilst unhelpful, the respective fines for Sainsbury and Tesco are 
immaterial. Asda (£9.4m), Safeway (£5.7m) and Sainsbury (£11m) received 
discounted fines for assisting the enquiry whilst Tesco (£10.4m) received no 
'early resolution' or 'leniency' discounts. Putting these numbers which do 
represent real cash costs into context, Sainsbury is expected, on our numbers, 
to report £706m pretax profits in 2012 whilst Tesco is expected to report more 
than £4bn in 2012.
