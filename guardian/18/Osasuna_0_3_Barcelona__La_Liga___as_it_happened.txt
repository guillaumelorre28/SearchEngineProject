It was not the dodgy MSN acronym, but rather just M who lit up this affair. 
Messi had defenders on their backsides as he tucked home his second goal of the 
afternoon, after leaving them quaking for much of a comfortable 3-0 win for
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Luis Enrique’s side 
opened the scoring after Luis Suárez scored a tap-in, before Messi dragged the 
game by the scruff of the neck, and ultimately won the game for Barça. Thanks 
for your emails, tweets and company. Bye!

Full-time: Osasuna 0-3 Barcelona

Lionel Messi scored twice after Luis Suárez opened the scoring on the hour 
mark at El Sadar. A routine win in the end, after 59 minutes of frustration for 
Luis Enrique. But that goal sparkedBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> into life, with Messi at 
centre stage, and his second goal, and the visitors’ third, a joyful finish.

GOAL! Osasuna 0-3 Barcelona (Messi, 90+2)

It had been coming. Messi wriggles past two Osasuna defenders before jinking 
to his left and burying the ball into the top-right corner. That’s 17 goals in 
10 league games for Messi againstOsasuna

87 min: Sergi Roberto skilfully skips a couple of challenges in defence, 
before starting another attack. And it’s 75% possession – the lion’s share of 
the ball then – for the visitors.

85 min: To back that up, Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have made more than 700 passes 
and have enjoyed 74% possession. It’s worth remembering, though, Osasuna were 
very much in the game for the best part of an hour, until Luis Suárez’s opener.

83 min: Luis Suárez is released after a fine sweeping move by Barcelona but 
he’s caught narrowly offside by the linesman. Osasuna have very little grip on 
this match anymore, withBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> very much dictating the tempo.

81 min: Messi’s goal was his 21st of the season in all competitions. 
Meanwhile, Ter Stegen is forced into a save as Berengeur attempts a lob at 
goal. It’s a good save, but fairly routine in the end.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Gomes slumps into the away 
dugout, with the job all but done. Things almost got a little interesting, but 
De las Cuevas failed to pick out a team-mate from the right after cutting 
inside Jordi Alba.

72 min: Messi started the move before driving into the box after laying the 
ball off to Jordi Alba. It’s another simple finish, with Messi slotting home 
from close range. Credit must go to Alba, too, who slid the ball across for the
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> forward to sweep 
home. Alba has been involved in almost everything since that little, er, 
pep-talk from Enrique early on.

68 min: Once more, Osasuna’s goalkeeper Perez is left angered after Messi 
jinks inside Bonnin on the edge of the box, before getting a shot away at goal. 
Perez is forced into a smart save down to his left, although the resulting 
corner comes to nothing.

their penalty area. Again, the Argentina striker picks up the ball before Perez

out by the Osasuna defender Clerc, who does well to track back on the striker’s 
blindside. Meanwhile, it’s a first change of the afternoon forBarcelona

60 min: That’s a blow, mentally, for Osasuna, who had started the second half 
compactly, and hit the bar through Leon.Osasuna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna>, arguably were the better team 
with 14 minutes gone in this second half. But Messi was allowed to sniff out 
his team-mate, Jordi Alba, who played a simple sliderule pass into Suárez, 
leaving the striker with an open goal.

GOAL! Osasuna 0-1 Barcelona (Suárez, 59)

It’s a tap-in for the striker, after brilliant work from Messi, who hovered 
around theOsasuna <https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> box, in search 
of his team-mate. Suspicions of offside, but Suárez wheels away with his 13th 
goal of the season.

56 min: More patient possession from Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> but it’s Osasuna who have come 
closest to scoring this half, through León. Osasuna appear to be growing in 
confidence, too, but goodness me, they just cannot retain possession of the 
round, luminous yellow thing.

51 min: So we’ve had two shots against the woodwork, but no opening as of yet. 
MeanwhileBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> win a foul 
on the half-way line. They go again, but Osasuna, are yet to just roll over. In 
fact, León again proves a handful, getting the better of Umtiti before Pique is 
forced to clear.

49 min: Brilliant from Sergio León, the Osasuna forward! But it’s only the 
woodwork, sadly. He beats Umtiti before driving towards the right, where he 
takes a quick glance at goal before bending a delightful chip beyond Ter Stegen 
and onto the crossbar. A fine effort, and again León causes problems for the
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> backline.

48 min: Luis Enrique looks a little nervous on the touchline, arms folded. His 
team, meanwhile, build another attack with Iniesta and Busquets interchanging 
passes before Suárez gives the ball away.

ball back after Osasuna started the second-half, before Riera presses Messi and 
wins the ball back down the left flank. Clerc then attempts the long throw 
which bounces into the six-yard box before Umtiti clears.

The players are back out for the second half, with Osasuna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> about to resume things any 
second. One substitution, and a like-for-like change, as Osasuna’s Flano, who 
picked up a knock in the first half, has been replaced by David Garcia.

Barcelona have not won in La Liga since 6 November, at Sevilla. They’ve carved 
open Osasuna time and again in Pamplona, but only registered three shots on 
target during the opening 45 minutes. Luis Enrique’s side have drawn their last 
three matches in the league, remember. Osasuna, currently rock-bottom in La 
Liga, are the latest team to frustrate Barcelona. Reasons to be cheerful?

Half-time! Osasuna 0-0 Barcelona

Jordi Alba drives a shot harmlessly wide of goal, and that’s the last action 
of this first 45 minutes. Barcelona have enjoyed almost of the possession, 
spurning two or three opportunities in front of goal. Osasuna, while hardly 
impressive, have provided the visitors something to think about at times, too. 
In reality, though, one of Suárez or Messi ought to have givenBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> the lead here. It’s all to 
play for, with the second half coming up shortly!

Lionel Messi at the double as Barcelona cruise to win over Osasuna

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/10/osasuna-barcelona-lionel-messi-la-liga-match-report> 
It was not the dodgy MSN acronym, but rather just M who lit up this affair. 
Messi had defenders on their backsides as he tucked home his second goal of the 
afternoon, after leaving them quaking for much of a comfortable 3-0 win for
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Luis Enrique’s side 
opened the scoring after Luis Suárez scored a tap-in, before Messi dragged the 
game by the scruff of the neck, and ultimately won the game for Barça. Thanks 
for your emails, tweets and company. Bye!
 
Lionel Messi scored twice after Luis Suárez opened the scoring on the hour 
mark at El Sadar. A routine win in the end, after 59 minutes of frustration for 
Luis Enrique. But that goal sparkedBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> into life, with Messi at 
centre stage, and his second goal, and the visitors’ third, a joyful finish.

Barrientos/AP  
It had been coming. Messi wriggles past two Osasuna defenders before jinking 
to his left and burying the ball into the top-right corner. That’s 17 goals in 
10 league games for Messi againstOsasuna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna>.
 
90 min: It should be three-nil, but Messi’s shot is eventually blocked. Every 
time Messi gets the ball, he surges into the opposition box, frighteningOsasuna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> defenders as he goes.
 
89 min: One Osasuna fan continues to make a racket, but Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are well on the way to 
celebrating their first league win in four matches.
 
87 min: Sergi Roberto skilfully skips a couple of challenges in defence, 
before starting another attack. And it’s 75% possession – the lion’s share of 
the ball then – for the visitors.
 
85 min: To back that up, Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have made more than 700 passes 
and have enjoyed 74% possession. It’s worth remembering, though, Osasuna were 
very much in the game for the best part of an hour, until Luis Suárez’s opener.
 
83 min: Luis Suárez is released after a fine sweeping move by Barcelona but 
he’s caught narrowly offside by the linesman. Osasuna have very little grip on 
this match anymore, withBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> very much dictating the tempo.
 
81 min: Messi’s goal was his 21st of the season in all competitions. 
Meanwhile, Ter Stegen is forced into a save as Berengeur attempts a lob at 
goal. It’s a good save, but fairly routine in the end.
 
79 min: Rafinha replaces Andre Gomes for Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Gomes slumps into the away 
dugout, with the job all but done. Things almost got a little interesting, but 
De las Cuevas failed to pick out a team-mate from the right after cutting 
inside Jordi Alba.
 
77 min: Leon’s back up on his feet and drills a shot at goal. It’s pretty tame 
but it’s a shot on target, with Ter Stegen gathering comfortably.
 
75 min: Osasuna’s star man, Leon, is hurt after a fairly innocuous tackle with 
Sergi Roberto. Play is back underway soon after, and Barcelona back in 
possession. Normality is restored, withBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> essentially coasting to 
victory.
 
72 min: Messi started the move before driving into the box after laying the 
ball off to Jordi Alba. It’s another simple finish, with Messi slotting home 
from close range. Credit must go to Alba, too, who slid the ball across for the
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> forward to sweep 
home. Alba has been involved in almost everything since that little, er, 
pep-talk from Enrique early on.
 
Who else?

69 min: A change for the hosts, as Riera replaces Kenan, with Osasuna a little 
flat at present.Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are 
in complete control at El Sadar.
 
68 min: Once more, Osasuna’s goalkeeper Perez is left angered after Messi 
jinks inside Bonnin on the edge of the box, before getting a shot away at goal. 
Perez is forced into a smart save down to his left, although the resulting 
corner comes to nothing.
 
66 min: Osasuna are simply affording Messi too much time and space around 
their penalty area. Again, the Argentina striker picks up the ball before Perez 
collects.Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, and Luis 
Enrique, look less stressed now, with their first league win in four matches on 
the horizon.
 
64 min: Messi almost nudges the ball through to Luis Suárez, but he’s crowded 
out by the Osasuna defender Clerc, who does well to track back on the striker’s 
blindside. Meanwhile, it’s a first change of the afternoon forBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, with Turan replaced by Denis 
Suárez.
 
62 min: Barcelona have been perked by that goal, just when things seemed to be 
starting to get away from them.Osasuna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> make a change, with Oier 
replaced by Tano Bonnin.
 
60 min: That’s a blow, mentally, for Osasuna, who had started the second half 
compactly, and hit the bar through Leon.Osasuna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna>, arguably were the better team 
with 14 minutes gone in this second half. But Messi was allowed to sniff out 
his team-mate, Jordi Alba, who played a simple sliderule pass into Suárez, 
leaving the striker with an open goal.
 
It’s a tap-in for the striker, after brilliant work from Messi, who hovered 
around theOsasuna <https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> box, in search 
of his team-mate. Suspicions of offside, but Suárez wheels away with his 13th 
goal of the season.

56 min: More patient possession from Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> but it’s Osasuna who have come 
closest to scoring this half, through León. Osasuna appear to be growing in 
confidence, too, but goodness me, they just cannot retain possession of the 
round, luminous yellow thing.
 
54 min: Osasuna gift the ball back to Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, shortly after clearing the 
danger, with Messi driving towards goal. Rafinha’s warming-up for the visitors, 
with Enrique pondering over changes at El Sadar.
 
51 min: So we’ve had two shots against the woodwork, but no opening as of yet. 
MeanwhileBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> win a foul 
on the half-way line. They go again, but Osasuna, are yet to just roll over. In 
fact, León again proves a handful, getting the better of Umtiti before Pique is 
forced to clear.
 
49 min: Brilliant from Sergio León, the Osasuna forward! But it’s only the 
woodwork, sadly. He beats Umtiti before driving towards the right, where he 
takes a quick glance at goal before bending a delightful chip beyond Ter Stegen 
and onto the crossbar. A fine effort, and again León causes problems for the
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> backline.
 
48 min: Luis Enrique looks a little nervous on the touchline, arms folded. His 
team, meanwhile, build another attack with Iniesta and Busquets interchanging 
passes before Suárez gives the ball away.
 
46 min: Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> claim the 
ball back after Osasuna started the second-half, before Riera presses Messi and 
wins the ball back down the left flank. Clerc then attempts the long throw 
which bounces into the six-yard box before Umtiti clears.
 
The players are back out for the second half, with Osasuna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> about to resume things any 
second. One substitution, and a like-for-like change, as Osasuna’s Flano, who 
picked up a knock in the first half, has been replaced by David Garcia.
 
Barcelona have not won in La Liga since 6 November, at Sevilla. They’ve carved 
open Osasuna time and again in Pamplona, but only registered three shots on 
target during the opening 45 minutes. Luis Enrique’s side have drawn their last 
three matches in the league, remember. Osasuna, currently rock-bottom in La 
Liga, are the latest team to frustrate Barcelona. Reasons to be cheerful?
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have gone in 
goalless at the break in their last four domestic matches.

Jordi Alba drives a shot harmlessly wide of goal, and that’s the last action 
of this first 45 minutes. Barcelona have enjoyed almost of the possession, 
spurning two or three opportunities in front of goal. Osasuna, while hardly 
impressive, have provided the visitors something to think about at times, too. 
In reality, though, one of Suárez or Messi ought to have givenBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> the lead here. It’s all to 
play for, with the second half coming up shortly!
 
45 min: Berenguer is played through down the right with a high, looping ball 
but he’s eventually crowded out by threeBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> defenders. There will be a 
minute of added time.
