Playing during the holiday period will provide a different kind of festive 
fare for the Bristol full-back Jason Woodward, who joined the club last month 
from the Hurricanes in New Zealand. “Playing on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day 
is unusual for me,” the 26-year-old said. “It is a time of year when I am used 
to being in holiday mode and enjoying hot weather but part of the draw coming 
here was trying something different.

“There has been a big circus about the Worcester game given where we are in 
the table but the best thing for us is to focus on the game. Getting caught up 
in the hype takes away from what we are trying to achieve. We are building each 
week, and our attack and defence are slowly getting better. That is what we 
have to concentrate on and not worry about anything else.”

Worcester will have the New Zealand-born Ben Te’o in their midfield for the 
first time since the end of October. He was involved in England’s autumn 
internationals and missed the European Challenge Cup matches against Newport 
Gwent Dragons to visit his father, who had been taken ill.

“I expect Ben will be hungry to play,” Sam Vesty said. “It is a big game and 
the media has made a big thing of it. It is one to look forward to and what we 
need to achieve is consistency.”

The Worcester coach added: “At the moment we are playing well one week but not 
the next and you cannot afford to do that. It is a painful lesson we have to 
take into the new year.”
