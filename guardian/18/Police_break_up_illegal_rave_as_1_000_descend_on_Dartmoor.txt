Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> have broken up an illegal 
Boxing Day rave in Dartmoor national park.

About 1,000 revellers attended the event in the hamlet of Bellever, in Devon, 
on Monday night.

Devon and Cornwall police said on Tuesday that three sound rigs had been 
dismantled and the rave was over, although about 500 people remained at the 
scene.

The force said it was concerned for the welfare of those that attended, given 
the freezing temperatures on the night.

Ch Insp Richard Hooper-Bennett said: “Our concerns are both for the people in 
attendance, and the impact on the local community.

“It has been an exceptionally cold night and a few people could be worse for 
wear, so we will be making sure that this dispersal is done calmly and people 
only allowed to leave the area when they are fit to do so.

“Dispersal orders are now in place and all three sound rigs have been 
dismantled. We also have traffic police here who will be ensuring drivers are 
in a fit state and their cars are roadworthy before being allowed to leave the 
area.

“At this time we have had no arrests or any vehicles or sound equipment 
seized. There are still around 500 people here and we expect this to take a few 
more hours before all people have left.

“I would like to thank the local people of Postbridge for their patience.”
