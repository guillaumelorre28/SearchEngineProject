 ‘It’s unbelievably funny and goes places you wouldn’t imagine’: Julia Davis 
sitcom Camping. Photograph: Colin Hutton 
I’ve loved this recently. It’s Julia Davis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/julia-davis>’s latest sitcom and I’ve 
loved everything she’s done –Hunderby

andHuman Remains 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon>
. I like how her humour is so unhinged, deeply weird and very dark. So these 
three couples who have known each other for a while go on a camping trip to 
celebrate one of their birthdays, and it’s unbelievably funny and goes places 
you wouldn’t imagine. And I love Vicki Pepperdine in it, who’s this overbearing 
nightmare who won’t let her son eat a baguette at breakfast in case it 
encourages him to be gay. It’s brilliant.

 ‘They all started living together in this three-way relationship’: Ruban 
Nielson of Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Photograph: Mike Windle/Getty Images for 
Coachella 
I’ve been listening to this a lot. The lead singer, Ruban Nielson, who’s 
married, went on holiday and met this girl and fell in love with her, so he 
came back and told his wife all about her. She was then so intrigued by her she 
invited her round, and they all started living together in this three-way 
relationship. Then he wrote an album about it, and it’s a really enjoyable soul 
album that sounds a bit like Stevie Wonder. It has some juicy trumpets in it, 
and it’s quite psychedelic as well. He also did some interviews about the whole 
situation and they caused a bit of a stir, I think, with the people involved.

 ‘It’s this amazing riddle’: Tacita Dean, right, passes notes to Stephen 
Dillane in Event for a Stage. Photograph: photo@susannahwimberley.com/Frith 
Street Gallery 
I saw this film at Frith Street Gallery in London earlier this year. Over four 
performances the artist got the actor Stephen Dillane to perform this piece, 
but she was sitting at the side and would pass him things he had to read or do 
during the performance. It’s this amazing riddle, and you can’t get to the 
bottom of what’s true and what isn’t. He seems like he’s having a really 
terrible time, and you can’t work out whether he’s a puppet or a rebel, and 
what the tension between them is. It sends your head into a bit of a spin. At 
one point he said: “An actor is the lowest form of life; I have no will of my 
own.” But you couldn’t work out who was in charge.

 ‘We didn’t speak for the whole time we were eating, we just sat there

Evening Standard 
This is quite a small place near Finsbury Park. They just sell sandwiches, 
really, but it was honestly the best sandwich I’ve ever eaten in my life: beef 
and sauerkraut with crisps and garlic and mayonnaise. It was unbelievable. We 
didn’t speak for the whole time we were eating, we just sat there grunting. It 
was incredibly rich – I did manage to finish the sandwich, against my better 
judgment – and to be honest I’m quite glad I don’t live near there, because I’d 
probably be dead. And Max, of the title, is very present in the shop as well, 
with this potty-mouthed, gregarious charm.

Guardian 
I went to see this the other day: it’s Ivo van Hove’s follow-up to The Man Who 
Fell to Earth, set in a New York high rise. No one I’ve met has enjoyed this, 
but I think that might be the reason I liked it so much, because I went in 
prepared to be completely baffled. I just loved it. I thought the projections 
were amazing: something would happen on the screen and then it would seemingly 
become actual. It’s the best-looking and sounding show I think I’ve ever seen 
and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m not sure I really knew what it was 
about, but I love the song Moonage Daydream and I don’t know what that means 
either, but that doesn’t bother me.

 ‘When she was younger she wanted to be a classical pianist’: Nina Simone. 
Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns 
I obviously knew Nina Simone’s music, but I didn’t know anything about her, 
and how she was introduced to music. When she was younger she wanted to be a 
classical pianist but people had only heard her work in jazz clubs. At one 
point they look at My Baby Just Cares For Me – I’d heard the song lots, but 
there’s a bit in there where she’s singing it and improvises a fugue, from 
presumably playing lots of Bach or something. It was fascinating. And all the 
stories behind the songs as well, which I had no idea about. It’s incredibly 
sad, but inspirational too.

Les Chants de Maldoror (1868) by Comte de Lautréamont 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview25>

I’m reading this at the moment but I think it’ll sound so unbelievably 
pretentious I’ll come across as a bit of a wanker. It’s this book all the early 
surrealists were inspired by, and it’s about this godless lunatic called 
Maldoror. It’s very gothic, and it’s got this line in it they all loved: “as 
beautiful as the chance encounter between a sewing machine and an umbrella on 
an operating table”. It was written a while before surrealism kicked off, but 
when it did they all cited it as their big thing. It’s a novel in six cantos, 
or songs, but there isn’t really a plot: it’s a weird, freewheeling flight of 
fancy. I heard about it on Radio 4’sIn O ur Time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/mar/08/in-our-time-radio-4>
. It’s quite dense but I’m enjoying it.
