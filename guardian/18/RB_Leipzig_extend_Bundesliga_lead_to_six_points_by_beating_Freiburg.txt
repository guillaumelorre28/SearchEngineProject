Florian Niederlechner claimed the equaliser against the run of play with a 
header from Pascal Stenzel’s corner but Timo Werner restored Leipzig’s lead in 
the 21st minute and doubled it with his second a little over 10 minutes later. 
Marcel Sabitzer, who had already struck the post, made it 4-1 late on.

The result is all that matters for Leipzig, who extended their record unbeaten 
start for a new team in the Bundesliga to 12 games with their seventh straight 
victory.

Bayern Munich need to recover from their first defeat of the season, against 
Borussia Dortmund last weekend, with a win at home over Bayer Leverkusen on 
Saturday to claw the gap back to three points.

Dortmund are nine points behind Leipzig and face a tricky game at Eintracht 
Frankfurt on Saturday.
