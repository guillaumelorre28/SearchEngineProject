Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> chief executive Charles 
Green faces a Scottish Football Association charge over alleged racist 
comments, the SFA has confirmed.

Green is charged with breaking Disciplinary Rule 66 and Disciplinary Rule 71 
which guard against comments which bring the game into disrepute and those 
which are not in the "best interests" of the SFA.

Green was criticised by campaign group Show Racisim the Red Card 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/08/rangers-charles-green-criticised>
 this week after he was quoted in a newspaper report referring to former Ibrox 
director, Imran Ahmad, as his "little Paki friend".

In an article in the Scottish Sun 
<http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/leaguedivision3/4876693/The-players-dream-of-a-free-punch-at-me-but-I-was-right-this-is-the-worst-Gers-team-EVER.html>
, Green was reported as saying: "I was brought up in a mining community where 
whether someone was black, white, Catholic, Salvation Army, Protestant made no 
difference. When I played at Worksop Town, the other striker was 'Darkie' 
Johnson. Now if I say that today I could go to jail. You know, Imran will come 
into the office regularly and I'll say, 'How's my Paki friend?'"

Green responded: "It is unfortunate that Show Racism the Red Card has fallen 
into the trap of taking something out of context and giving a knee-jerk 
reaction. In the interview I referred to the fact we are now living in a 
politically correct world where words and phrases that were once used are no 
longer acceptable.

"My use of the word 'Paki' was when I was referring to how I sometimes warmly 
address my colleague and friend Imran Ahmad when we meet, something we both 
know is light-hearted. I deplore racism and sectarianism and this football club 
does a huge amount of work in this area to help eradicate these problems."
