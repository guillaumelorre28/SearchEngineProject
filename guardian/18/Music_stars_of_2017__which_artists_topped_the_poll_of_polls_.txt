The annual tip list onslaught is finally over. Everyone had a go at 
forecasting this year: traditional publications, tech companies, brands, your 
dad’s mate who once played golf with a man who worked for Island Records in the 
1980s. The general consensus is, quite rightly, that 2017 will continue to see 
grime and UK rap gaining massive global attention. Rag’n’Bone Man’s epic 
outpouring of blues and soul will undoubtedly soundtrack sports events and 
televised festival coverage, and it has just been announced thatRay BLK 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/122FSRNWPpZclwy6Xt1DySs/1st-ray-blk> 
was crowned winner of theBBC Music Sound of … 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/2xpPCC0j9nsX0yQHkQ0YlHX/the-longlist> 
poll. An outsider option, but one that very much affirms the ascent of British 
rap.

But who was the real winner? The scientific winner? Using the internet, a 
bunsen burner and a thermometer, I took a look at this year’s poll results and 
discovered which artists had received the majority of votes overall. Taking 
into account results from Vevo, i-D, Google Play, Spotify, MTV, BBC Music Sound 
of …, the Brits, the Independent, Red Bull, NME and Billboard, the artists 
below are the acts who were named most in short and longlists – revealing some 
joint winners, and the odd underdog in between.

Joint first

AJ Tracey
The west London MC is one of UK grime’s most anticipated new voices. Born in 
Brixton and brought up in Ladbroke Grove, his childhood was soundtracked by UK 
garage and dancehall (plus the musical taste of his Welsh mum – a DJ who loves 
NWA). Backed by hisMTP 
<http://www.grimeforum.com/showthread.php?147516-New-grime-crew-MTP-(AJ-Tracey-Big-Zuu-Jay-Amo-Ets-others)>
 crew of producers and MCs and collaborating with fellow Londoner Dave, aside 
from freestyles and live shows, Tracey has taken a slow dripfeed approach to 
releasing singles. His hopes are to extend and accelerate the legacy of grime 
for a new generation, rather than imitate what’s already happened. “I’m so 
bored of this nostalgia,” he toldDummy magazine 
<http://www.dummymag.com/features/aj-tracey-interview> last year. “The new 
grime kids feel like they have to reference Dizzee or D Double, or spit on an 
old beat to get people to listen to them, and it’s boring.”

Nadia Rose 
Cousin of Stormzy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/21/stormzy-grime-skepta-kanye-drake>
, possessor of wit, style and the level of mischief that the British music 
scene is pining for. Rose built a fanbase on social media with her bass-heavy, 
bashment-infused rap. Her trackSkwod 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns_0zp00UQk> was one of the biggest statements 
of 2016; a savage swipe at her enemies but mostly a celebration of her friends, 
her video featuring the rapper dancing down a street like the pied piper of UK 
rap. “I’m your worst nightmare stood over your bed,” is among one of many of 
her declarations, a warning – or maybe a challenge – to anyone else hoping to 
break big in 2017.

Raye
Raye is only 18 years old, but her CV reveals an artist already ingrained in 
the music industry. She did two years at the Brit School before ducking out (“I 
felt confined. I was ready to get out,” she told the BBC) and released her 
first EPWelcome to the Winter 
<https://soundcloud.com/arayeofcolours/sets/welcome-to-the-winter> in 2014. Her 
song Hotbox, about an “inherited high”, written aged 14 while sitting in a car 
full of people smoking weed, caught the attention of Olly Alexander ofYears & 
Years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/09/years-years-communion-review>, 
and led to her getting signed. She’s been part of writers’ rooms – including 
one for Rihanna – as well as supportingJess Glynne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/20/jess-glynne-i-cry-when-i-laugh-review>
 on tour. A close collaborator with pop hit-makerCharli XCX 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/charli-xcx>, her music’s got huge potential 
across the pond, repackaging the sparse, frosty production and laidback R&B 
vocal style found on Drake, Tinashe or Jhené Aiko.

Joint second

Rag’n’Bone Man
From Uckfield, East Sussex, he’s the Brits critics’ choice award-winner, whose 
cavernous voice rumbles over samples from old blues and soul records. It’s a 
sort of extension of the “real music” rootsy folk revival spearheaded by 
Mumford & Sons, only this incarnation is covered in tattoos rather than tweed. 
“Sometimes people think I’m scary because I’m a big dude and I’m covered in 
tattoos – I feel like strangers are wary of me,”he told the Guardian in 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/01/modern-masculinity-and-music-2016-the-year-of-the-ambiguous-male>
. “I get funny looks from old people. The thing is, that person that people see 
does not come across in my personality or music at all. I like trying to break 
those barriers of what is expected of a man.” Such is the grand earnestness of 
the production and its relatable, introspective lyrics on the singleHuman 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3wKzyIN1yk>, he has already been a massive 
success across Europe, and has topped the charts in Austria, Belgium, Germany, 
Hungary, Slovakia and Switzerland.

Stefflon Don
Stephanie Allen is a rapper whose candy coloured aesthetic and lyrical 
fearlessness has naturally gained comparisons to Lil’ Kim and Nicki Minaj. A 
former hairdresser, her upbringing was in Birmingham and Holland before moving 
to London at the age of 15. The formative part of her career started with 
channels SB:TV and Link Up TV, before she was picked up by Sony. If the past 
few years has seen UK grime influencing and terrifying major-league US stars, 
then global rap acts ought to take note of the tornado-force talent from 
Stefflon Don. “If your main focus is on being the best, you can break 
anywhere,” she told Factmagazine recently 
<http://www.factmag.com/2016/12/23/stefflon-don-fact-rated-interview/>. “That’s 
my focus. With my grind, I go in. I feel like I have potential to be the 
biggest artist.”

 Stefflon Don: Real Ting – official vieo 
Tom Grennan
Much of Grennan’s music belongs in the same bracket as Rag’n’Bone Man: a 
sensitive, soulful songwriter and, aesthetically, a bit of a lad. Whereas in 
previous years, solo troubadours, such as Sam Smith, James Bay and Tom Odell, 
have been clean-cut and on constant standby for a GQ shoot, now it appears an 
audience would rather have a singer more at home busking under a bridge in 
Camden. So far his career has been ordained by Chase and Status, who borrowed 
his intense, gravelly croon for their singleAll Goes Wrong 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDGGsuVKVo>, and, inexplicably, has been 
signed to Craig David’s Insanity label.

Third

Will Joseph Cook
Hailing from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, Cook, one of those YouTube acoustic 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8I1dCTA6rs> sort-of stars, has now evolved 
into a streaming success story with his original material. His peppy 
songwriting is often bolstered by colourful videos, in which he is frequently 
dressed as a woman and making thinly veiled comments about the futile nature of 
modern celebrity and romance. He was brought up listening to the quirkier side 
of guitar groups in the noughties – MGMT, Vampire Weekend, Everything 
Everything – and, as a result, his music is a very packageable, melodic type of 
wry pop.
