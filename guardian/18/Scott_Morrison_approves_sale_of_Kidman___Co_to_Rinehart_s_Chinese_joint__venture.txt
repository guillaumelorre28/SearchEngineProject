Mining magnate Gina Rinehart’s joint venture with a Chinese company will buy S 
Kidman & Co, Australia’s biggest agricultural property, after the treasurer 
approved the sale.

On Friday Scott Morrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison> announced he had 
approved the bid from Australian Outback Beef, which is 67% owned by Rinehart’s 
Hancock Beef and 33% owned by Shanghai CRED.

The largest station in the Kidman group, Anna Creek in South Australia, and 
its outstation The Peake, will be bought by the Williams family, a local 
farming family with adjoining properties. The rest will be sold to the joint 
venture.

Morrison said the deal increased Australian ownership in the properties 
currently part of the Kidman group from 66.1% to 74.7%.

Rinehart said the purchase would put her company in the top three beef 
producers in Australia, with a combined herd size growing to about 300,000 head.
The company planned to invest in technology and infrastructure with the 
potential to create 100 jobs in regional communities.

“The treasurer’s approach to the sale of Kidman enabled a local Australian 
company to pay a fair market price and retain Kidman in Australian control,” 
she said.

The Australian-owned Hancock will control the board and day-to-day operation 
of the business, which will remain incorporated and headquartered in South 
Australia. Existing environmental and other commitments will be honoured.

“Consistent with the recommendation from the foreign investment review board 
(Firb), I have decided that the acquisition of Kidman as proposed would not be 
contrary to the national interest and will be permitted to proceed as 
proposed,” Morrison said.

The treasurer said the sale process had been “extensive and heavily 
scrutinised”, referring to two decisions blocking the sale to foreign investors 
on national security grounds firstin November 2015

.

Security concerns that influenced the earlier rejections had been mitigated by 
excising Anna Creek, the largest single property holding in Australia, from the 
sale. Part of Anna Creek is in the Woomera protected area in South Australia.

In October the joint venture knocked out a syndicate of Australian graziers

 by increasing its bid to $386.5m.

Greg Campbell, Kidman’s managing director, said staff and management were 
excited about entering into a “new and transformational phase” of the business.

“I know I speak not only for myself but for many Kidman employees when I say 
we are pleased that Hancock, a highly respected Australian company, leads the 
joint venture that has received key approvals to acquire Kidman,” he said in a 
statement.

“Mrs Gina Rinehart <https://www.theguardian.com/business/gina-rinehart> is a 
prominent Australian and we appreciate her desires to further invest and grow 
the business.”

The company also welcomed the commitment to keep the Kidman head office in 
Adelaide.

Kidman is one of Australia’s largest beef producers, with pastoral leases 
covering 101,000 sq km across South Australia, Western Australia, Northern 
Territory and Queensland.

There are 19 individual properties operated as 12 enterprises – 10 cattle 
stations, a bull breeding stud farm and a feedlot.

The divestment of Anna Creek and The Peake stations will reduce the land area 
bought by Outback Beef to 77,700 sq km.

The approval of the sale is likely to win support from One Nation which had 
welcomed the Hancock-Shanghai joint venture.

The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, told the ABC in October 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-10/kidman-bid-welcomed-by-pauline-hanson-ag-industry/7918078>
: “I would rather Australia have two-thirds in Kidman station, rather than the 
total ownership and control by the Chinese or any other foreign investor.

“Congratulations to Gina Rinehart for actually taking up and buying Kidman.”

But independent lower house MP Bob Katter expressed outrage on Friday, 
accusing the treasurer of selling out the country by approving the deal.

“Does anyone seriously think that Shanghai CRED, with its parent company 
having put in a bid for the whole lot, [are] going to settle for a third?”

Morrison said any future changes in ownership, including any increase in 
interest by Shanghai CRED, will require subsequent Firb and treasurer approval.
