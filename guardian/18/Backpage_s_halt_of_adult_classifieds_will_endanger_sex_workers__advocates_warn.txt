The shutdown of the adult classifieds section on Backpage.com will endanger 
the lives of sex workers and make it harder for officials to investigate 
trafficking and support victims, civil rights advocates said.

Backpage, a popular Craigslist-style website where workers have long 
advertised a range of services, announced on Monday that “unconstitutional 
government censorship” has forced the company to remove its adult content. The 
closure comes after prosecutors across the US have aggressivelytargeted

 the site and itsexecutives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/backpage-ceo-arrested-sex-ads-forced-prostitution>
, claiming that Backpage facilitates and profits from pimping and human 
trafficking.

But sex workers have long argued that Backpage provides a safe public platform 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/backpage-ceo-arrest-free-speech-sex-workers-rights>
 to vet clients and report predators, and that without it, the industry will be 
pushed further underground. On Tuesday, activists said the termination had 
removed a source of income for many vulnerable people and would force some with 
no choice but to work on the streets where they are much more likely to face 
violence andpolice harassment

.

“A lot of lives are being destroyed,” said Kristen DiAngelo, executive 
director of the Sex Workers Outreach Project of Sacramento. “These are human 
and civil rights abuses. How many sex workers across the US now have no way to 
support themselves?”

Newly elected US senator Kamala Harris led the fight against Backpage as 
California’s attorney general, repeatedlyfiling charges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/23/backpage-new-pimping-charge-kamala-harris-california>
 against the site’s operators, claiming the platform was an “online brothel”. 
But judges across the country have continuallysided with the website 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/backpage-com-california-pimping-free-speech-kamala-harris>
 andfirst amendment advocates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/backpage-ceo-arrest-free-speech-sex-workers-rights>
, citing a law that isfoundational to free speech on the internet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/29/airbnb-lawsuit-san-francisco-regulation-internet-porn>
, which dictates that platforms are not liable for the postings of users.

Despite the legal victories, including the supreme court’s decision

 on Monday not to hear an appeal against Backpage, the US Senate has 
intensified scrutiny of the company with a report and hearing on Tuesday, 
leading the site to replace its adult section with a banner that reads“CENSORED”

Targeting Backpage, activists say, is part of a broader campaign by liberal 
and conservative lawmakers in America to further criminalize sex work, which
research

 has shown does little to protect victims of trafficking while making it harder

“It’s really a sad day,” said Lois Lee, founder and president of Children of 
the Night, a national hotline and shelter program for sex trafficking victims.

Lee’s organization had advertised its services on Backpage, and she said she 
helped build partnerships between the company and police so that law 
enforcement could use the platform to investigate trafficking.

“It was a useful tool,” she said. “That’s gone now.”

Shuttering Backpage does not stop pimping, but it does make it harder for 
authorities and for sex workers to detect that kind of dangerous activity, said 
Maxine Doogan, president of the Erotic Service Provider Legal, Educational and 
Research Project.

“There’s no research that says removing advertising sites reduces 
trafficking,” said Doogan, noting that women used the site to carefully screen 
clients, who could provide references to other Backpage workers. “Everybody is 
scrambling.”

People are panicked … They’re saying if they can’t make money on Backpage 
today they have to be on the streets tonight
Kimberlee Cline, sex worker who used Backpage 
“People are panicked. They’re thinking about paying bills and buying food,” 
said Kimberlee Cline, a Sacramento-based sex worker who used Backpage. “They’re 
saying if they can’t make money on Backpage today, they have to go and be on 
the streets tonight.

“On the streets,” she added, “there’s no screening at all. It’s just based on 
gut.”

The ongoing political campaign to force Backpage to close is another example 
of how US lawmakers ignore sex workers in policy debates on trafficking, said 
Ellyn Bell, a formernonprofit 
<https://www.facebook.com/The-SAGE-Project-Inc-274734426601/> director who has 
written aboutchild exploitation

.

“Sex workers’ voices need to be taken into consideration,” she said, adding, 
“It really comes down to decriminalization. There has to be a platform where 
people feel safe.”

In recent years, the shuttering 
<http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2010/09/pimp_mobile.html>
 of other adult servicessites <https://www.wired.com/2015/02/redbook/> has left 
workers with very few options. In some communities, a loss of online ad 
platforms has directly led toreports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/backpage-ceo-arrest-free-speech-sex-workers-rights>
 of increased arrests of sex workers and sexual assaults on the job.

Since the Backpage news this week, DiAngelo said sex workers are already 
getting threats from pimps who are telling women they will now need to rely on 
them to get work.

“We’re going to see so many more people trafficked and pimped. Violence is 
going to escalate,” she said, in tears. “The bottom line is we’re going to see 
bloodshed.”
