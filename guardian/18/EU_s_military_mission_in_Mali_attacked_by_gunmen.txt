Gunmen have attacked the European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> 
military training mission’s headquarters in the Malian capital, Bamako, in what 
appeared to be the latest in a string of attacks on Western interests in the 
region.

Armed forces killed at least one man. It was not immediately known how many 
people had launched the assault.

Sgt Baba Dembele from the anti-terrorism unit in Bamako said it was believed 
some attackers had entered the Hotel Nord-Sud, where the mission is 
headquartered.

The EU mission later said on Twitter that no personnel had been wounded and 
its forces were securing the area.

EU soldiers, the Malian army, national police and other security forces stood 
outside the hotel.

The assault comes about four months after jihadis attacked the Radisson Blu 
hotel in Mali’s capital

, killing 20 people. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and al-Mourabitoun claimed 
responsibility for the attack, saying it was their first joint attack since 
al-Mourabitoun joined al-Qaida’s north Africa branch in 2015.

In January, other extremists from the same militant groups attacked a cafe 
near a hotel popular with foreigners in Burkina Faso’s capital, killing at 
least 30 people. And last week al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb claimed 
responsibility for an assault on a beach in Ivory Coast that left at least 19 
dead, identifying the three attackers as members of al-Mourabitoun and Sahara 
units.

This week marks the fourth anniversary of the coup that unleashed widespread 
chaos in Mali. After the overthrow of the democratically elected president, 
extremists in the northern half ofMali <https://www.theguardian.com/world/mali> 
took over the major towns and began implementing their strict interpretation of 
Islamic law. The amputations and public whippings only ended when a French-led 
military mission forced them from power in 2013.

Over the past year, the jihadis have mounted a growing wave of violent attacks 
against UN peacekeepers who are trying to help stabilise the country.
