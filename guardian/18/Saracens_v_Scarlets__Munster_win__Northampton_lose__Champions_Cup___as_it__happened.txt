So to surmise, there’s been a quite remarkable bonus point victory for Munster 
in a fitting tribute to Anthony Foley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/22/munster-glasgow-european-champions-cup-match-report>
, a high-octane win for Clermont against Bordeaux, a thumping for Northampton 
at Castres and a case of job done for Saracens against the Scarlets.

As ever, many thanks for reading. Bye!

Saracens 44-26 Scarlets (full-time)

Saracens <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens> run out comfortable 
winners in the end, they were not at their best, nowhere near as good as last 
week, but with the kind of individual brilliance that they have they did not 
need to be.

Nick Tompkins was excellent as a late replacement for Brad Barritt, Owen 
Farrell continues to impress on his comeback from injury and Richard 
Wigglesworth was typically classy. The big concern will be Maro Itoje, who went 
off with a hand injury.

The Scarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> deserve credit for 
sticking to the task but they were eventually outgunned and now face a daunting 
double header against Toulon.

Saracens 44-26 Scarlets (76 mins)

That is typical of Saracens though. Less than a minute later Michael Rhodes 
cruises over after a delightful Farrell pass. TheScarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> really did make a mess of the 
restart.

Jonathan Davies has his try and, not for the first time, you have to credit 
the Scarlets’s spirit. Farrell converts so theScarlets

have a man in the bin. First things first, a losing bonus point …

Saracens 34-19 Scarlets (64 mins)

Alex Sanderson has been interviewed on Sky Sports and asked about Itoje’s 
injury – he says he’ll have to see someone to have it assessed in a pretty 
matter-of-fact manner but that, combined with Itoje’s body language suggests it 
may not be good news.

So if Itoje has an injury that means he can’t play against the Springboks, is 
that enough potential opensides out to constitute ‘exceptional circumstances?’ 
Does the new EPS agreement even contain the words ‘exceptional circumstances?

Meanwhile, the Scarlets have a try. Aaron Shingler finishes off as the 
visitors pull a fast one from a five-metre lineout. Patchell converts. All 
credit to theScarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets>.

Saracens 27-12 Scarlets (48 mins)

Oh dear, Maro Itoje has been forced off with what looks like a finger/hand 
injury. Eddie Jones will be worried about that. And after Alistair Hargreaves 
recent retirement, Kruis’ ankle surgery and a failure to agree a deal for Eben 
Etzebeth,Saracens <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens> are considerably 
short at lock if he’s out for any length of time. Jackson Wray replaces him.

In better news, Marcelo Bosch has their third try after a rampaging run from 
Mako Vunipola and a delightful cross-field kick from Farrell, who lands the 
conversion.

Saracens 20-12 Scarlets (44 mins)

The Scarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> are playing some 
good stuff at the start of the second half – after going through plenty of 
phases it’s Mako Vunipola, who else, that forces a timely turnover for Saracens.

Saracens 20-12 Scarlets (half-time)

Patchell and Farrell exchange penalties before the Scarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> fly-half adds another just before 
the break. Saracens are far from their best at the moment but some moments of 
individual brilliance from Mako Vunipola and Tompkins are enough for an 
eight-point lead.

Saracens 7-6 Scarlets (15 mins)

Bad news for the Scarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> and 
potentially Wales as Liam Williams, so impressive last weekend against Sale, 
hobbles off. In better news, Patchell converts his second penalty.

Saracens 7-3 Scarlets (12 mins)

Saracens have been probing so far – one early run from Schalk Brits was 
excellent and while Rhys Patchell had kickedScarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> into an early lead, Sarries 
breakthrough on 11 minutes.Mako Vunipola – is there a better loosehead in the 
world at the moment – is the man with it. Owen Farrell adds the extras.

There’s a late change for both teams at inside centre. Brad Barritt is ruled 
out with a neck injury so Nick Tompkins comes in and Owen Farrell is made 
captain. Fot theScarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets>, Scott 
Williams is a late withdrawal so Hadleigh Parkes comes in.

Clermont 49-33 Bordeaux-Begles (full time)

It’s finished with a flourish at Clermont – Sitaleki Timani scores Clermont’s 
sixth try, and in the last minuteGauthier Doubrere gets Bordeaux’s fifth. The 
long and short of it is another bonus point win for Clermont and what may prove 
an important losing bonus point for Bordeaux.

Try No5 for Clermont – a delightful finish for David Strettle with measured 
chip over the top. Bordeaux had registered their third with another forButtin 
so with eight minutes to go they have something to chase.

Castres 41-7 Northampton (full-time)

Emphatic. Castres were impressive, far better than their defeat to Leinster 
last weekend, butNorthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> were just awful. They’ve 
scored only 10 tries in the Premiership – the second least – and for a long 
time they looked like they may finish scoreless. They had chances in the first 
half but they look completely drained of confidence. Jim Mallinder has major 
issues to address.

Castres 41-7 Northampton (79 mins)

Try No5 … oh dear. The replacement scrum-half Antoine Dupont makes plonkers of 
theNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> defence, 
dances around them and splashes over in the corner. If Saracens’ was the best 
away performance from an English side in Europe then this can’t be far off the 
worst. Dumora converts again.

Castres 27-7 Northampton (74 mins)

Huzzah! Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> have 
some points! It’sWilson who goes over, finishing off an overlap on the right 
after more good work from Hutchinson. It looks so easy when it comes off … 
Stephen Myler converts.

Castres 27-0 Northampton (71 mins)

Castres are struggling to get the fourth try and it’s beginning to effect them 
– they’re giving penalties away with the try-line in sight. It’s a damning 
indictment ofNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> 
that their main goal now is to deny their opponents a bonus point but they 
deserve nothing for their own efforts.

As an aside, Courtney Lawes has been average today. Following George Kruis’s 
ankle surgery you’d prefer him in better form if you’re an England fan.

Castres 27-0 Northampton (68 mins)

Hmmm. As poor as Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> have been, things aren’t 
going their way. Lee Dickson tapped a penalty and Kockott tackled him far too 
early. Having already been shown a yellow card it really should have been a red 
… but the referee didn’t agree. The fact that Castres then hooked Kockott 
immediately suggests the coaches did.

Castres <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres>, to rub salt into the 
wounds, scythe through Northampton from their own line to the Saints 22. 
Northampton scramble though, so the put in to the scrum is theirs.

Clermont have turned the tide – Wesley Fofana is over for their third try of

Castres 27-0 Northampton (51 mins)

Better from Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints>, 
first Haywood, then Hutchinson go up the middle. Tom Wood has rolled up his 
sleeves and is getting stuck in as well. Castres scramble well though, even if 
there looked like a high tackle in there somewhere.

That’s the end of Dylan Hartley’s day, replaced by Mike Haywood on his first 
appearance for six weeks. If Eddie Jones was watching he’s probably turned off 
now.

Castres 27-0 Northampton (46 mins)

Try No3 for Castres <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> and that is 
game over. It came from a mistake from Michael Paterson and a clever dart from 
Kockott off the base of Castres’ dominant scrum and then the hosts just do the 
simple things right, work the ball wide toSmith on the left, who ghosts over 
for his second. Far, far too easy. Urdapilleta is on target with the conversion.

Northampton are on their way back out, no doubt with their ears still ringing. 
They really should be closer toCastres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> on the scoreboard but basic 
mistakes have cost them. A losing bonus point is the target now you feel.

Castres 20-0 Northampton (half-time)

That’s another try for Castres, and that’s excellent from Kockott. Spotting 
the Northampton right wing James Wilson out of position he kicks over the top, 
gets lucky with the bounce, and after a phase or two, the propAntoine Tichit 
powers over. Urdapilleta converts just before half-time.Northampton

Castres 13-0 Northampton (36 mins)

Teimana Harrison is playing, apparently. How his stock has fallen since the 
summer … Saints only have themselves to blame for this really, they’ve had 
their chances, went for the corner each time but haven’t been accurate enough.

time. Madigan converts again but Parra has since added a third penalty to keep 
the hosts in touching distance.

Castres 13-0 Northampton (31 mins)

But there’s the breakthrough. Tulou rampages through the middle again and this 
timeDavid Smith is on hand to take the offload and cruise under the posts. 
Castres are down to 14 don’t forget. A long way back forNorthampton

Castres 6-0 Northampton (30 mins)

Castres march Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints>
 back in the scrum again, and so Urdapilleta will have a ging from 50m. Castres 
came close to first try a few minutes ago, but Horacio Agulla was denied in the 
left corner after a fine break from Tulou up the middle.

Urdapilleta doesn’t have the distance so it’s as you were.

Castres 6-0 Northampton (25 mins)

The referee has had enough of Castres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> infringements – and after Kockott 
is caught blatantly off his feet he’ll spend 10 minutes in the sin-bin. Saints 
go for the corner again but Harry Mallinder’s grubber comes to nothing.

Castres 6-0 Northampton (20 mins)

Saints are coming back at Castres, whose No8 Alex Tulou is getting a ticking 
off from the referee Ian Davies.Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> opt for the corner rather 
than the posts, they’re almost over … so we’ll go to the TMO. “Try, yes or no?” 
is the question, but Picamoles is short so we’ll have a scrum.

It’s a huge scrum from Castres <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres>, 
who clear their lines through Rory Kockott.

Castres 6-0 Northampton (15 mins)

A last-ditch tackle from George North stops a Castres try after Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> are carved apart by a 
lovely out-the-back pass from Robert Ebersohn. Castres were playing advantage 
though, and Urdapilleta is on target again.

Just five minutes to go until kick-off in two more of the afternoon’s matches 
– Castres vNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> 
and Clermont v Bordeaux – but the celebrations and tributes will continue for a 
while yet at Thomond Park.

I’m getting ahead of myself here but if Munster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster> play like that for the rest of the 
competition, they may make it all the way to Murrayfield in May. And wouldn’t 
that be a fitting tribute to Foley.

Munster 38-17 Glasgow (full time)

Glasgow go through umpteen phases before spilling the ball and Keatley boots 
the ball off the pitch for full time and the end to a spectacular performance 
fromMunster <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster>. They were down to 14 
men for 61 minutes but they steamrollered Glasgow, who had no answer.

CJ Stander, Dave Kilcoyne, Tyler Bleyendaal, Peter O’Mahony … Munster’s heroes 
were all over the pitch. You had to feel for Keith Earls and although his tip 
tackle on Fraser Brown probably warranted a red card, it was Earls who made the 
initial break for Bleyendaal’s first try which sparked this performance.

The Fields of Athenry rings out again as there are more tears among the 
Munster players but this was an incredible performance of aggression, 
commitment and red fury and the emotion now is to be expected.

Munster 38-17 Glasgow (76 mins)

That’ll do it. Munster <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster>, rolling 
back the years, go through phase after phase. No unnecessary risks, just giving 
it to the forwards and making a few yards at a time, marshalled superbly by 
Murray. And after Stander makes yet more ground, Scannell is over in the 
corner. Ian Keatley, on for Bleyendaal, converts.

Munster 31-10 Glasgow (66 mins)

Glasgow came close to a try a few minutes ago – on one of the rare occasions 
they have put width on the ball, Rory Hughes had a dart down the left but the 
coveringMunster <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster> defence shoved him 
out of play.

But Glasgow have their score through Pat McArthur, the replacement hooker. A 
textbook driving maul. Surely there’s no way back but these may be valuable 
points nonetheless in what is shaping up to be a tight pool. Russell converts.

So to surmise, there’s been a quite remarkable bonus point victory for Munster 
in a fitting tribute to Anthony Foley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/22/munster-glasgow-european-champions-cup-match-report>
, a high-octane win for Clermont against Bordeaux, a thumping for Northampton 
at Castres and a case of job done for Saracens against the Scarlets.

As ever, many thanks for reading. Bye!
 
Saracens <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens> run out comfortable 
winners in the end, they were not at their best, nowhere near as good as last 
week, but with the kind of individual brilliance that they have they did not 
need to be.

Nick Tompkins was excellent as a late replacement for Brad Barritt, Owen 
Farrell continues to impress on his comeback from injury and Richard 
Wigglesworth was typically classy. The big concern will be Maro Itoje, who went 
off with a hand injury.

The Scarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> deserve credit for 
sticking to the task but they were eventually outgunned and now face a daunting 
double header against Toulon.
 
That is typical of Saracens though. Less than a minute later Michael Rhodes 
cruises over after a delightful Farrell pass. TheScarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> really did make a mess of the 
restart.
 Saracens’ Michael Rhodes scores their fifth try. Photograph: Paul Harding/PA  
Jonathan Davies has his try and, not for the first time, you have to credit 
the Scarlets’s spirit. Farrell converts so theScarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> trail by 11 points and Sarries 
have a man in the bin. First things first, a losing bonus point …
 
Ben Spencer goes to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on but the Scarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> wants a penalty try with Jonathan 
Davies denied receiving the ball with the try-line beckoning. It’s not awarded 
and Saracens win a penalty at the scrum.
 
There’s a lengthy stoppage while Jake Ball receives treatment. Farrell has 
added another penalty by the by.
 
Alex Sanderson has been interviewed on Sky Sports and asked about Itoje’s 
injury – he says he’ll have to see someone to have it assessed in a pretty 
matter-of-fact manner but that, combined with Itoje’s body language suggests it 
may not be good news.

So if Itoje has an injury that means he can’t play against the Springboks, is 
that enough potential opensides out to constitute ‘exceptional circumstances?’ 
Does the new EPS agreement even contain the words ‘exceptional circumstances?

Meanwhile, the Scarlets have a try. Aaron Shingler finishes off as the 
visitors pull a fast one from a five-metre lineout. Patchell converts. All 
credit to theScarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets>.
 
Chris Wyles finishes off a swift counterattack from Saracens to wrap up the 
bonus point and end any distant hopes of aScarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> comeback.
 
Oh dear, Maro Itoje has been forced off with what looks like a finger/hand 
injury. Eddie Jones will be worried about that. And after Alistair Hargreaves 
recent retirement, Kruis’ ankle surgery and a failure to agree a deal for Eben 
Etzebeth,Saracens <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens> are considerably 
short at lock if he’s out for any length of time. Jackson Wray replaces him.

In better news, Marcelo Bosch has their third try after a rampaging run from 
Mako Vunipola and a delightful cross-field kick from Farrell, who lands the 
conversion.
 
The Scarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> are playing some 
good stuff at the start of the second half – after going through plenty of 
phases it’s Mako Vunipola, who else, that forces a timely turnover for Saracens.
 
Patchell and Farrell exchange penalties before the Scarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> fly-half adds another just before 
the break. Saracens are far from their best at the moment but some moments of 
individual brilliance from Mako Vunipola and Tompkins are enough for an 
eight-point lead.
 
Tompkins, a late replacement for Barritt remember, is having a blinder and 
he’s scythed his way through theScarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> defence for Sarries’s second try. 
The hosts have indeed moved up a gear. Farrell converts from in front.

The Scarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> are certainly 
defending resolutely but Saracens are beginning to build some momentum, getting 
around the corner a couple of times. Farrell adds a penalty for a four-point 
lead.
 
Bad news for the Scarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> and 
potentially Wales as Liam Williams, so impressive last weekend against Sale, 
hobbles off. In better news, Patchell converts his second penalty.
 
Saracens have been probing so far – one early run from Schalk Brits was 
excellent and while Rhys Patchell had kickedScarlets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> into an early lead, Sarries 
breakthrough on 11 minutes.Mako Vunipola – is there a better loosehead in the 
world at the moment – is the man with it. Owen Farrell adds the extras.

Browne/Reuters  
There’s a late change for both teams at inside centre. Brad Barritt is ruled 
out with a neck injury so Nick Tompkins comes in and Owen Farrell is made 
captain. Fot theScarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets>, Scott 
Williams is a late withdrawal so Hadleigh Parkes comes in.
 
Ah – Sarries v Scarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> is a 
5.30pm BST kick-off, so we’ve time to catch our collective breath. Just over 10 
minutes to go now …
 
It’s finished with a flourish at Clermont – Sitaleki Timani scores Clermont’s 
sixth try, and in the last minuteGauthier Doubrere gets Bordeaux’s fifth. The 
long and short of it is another bonus point win for Clermont and what may prove 
an important losing bonus point for Bordeaux.
 
Meanwhile, Saracens <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens> v Scarlets is 
kicking off in a little under 10 minutes … so here are your teams.

Bordeaux have their bonus point try, scored by Metuisela Talebula. Lionel 
Beauxis converts.
 
Try No5 for Clermont – a delightful finish for David Strettle with measured 
chip over the top. Bordeaux had registered their third with another forButtin 
so with eight minutes to go they have something to chase.

Emphatic. Castres were impressive, far better than their defeat to Leinster 
last weekend, butNorthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> were just awful. They’ve 
scored only 10 tries in the Premiership – the second least – and for a long 
time they looked like they may finish scoreless. They had chances in the first 
half but they look completely drained of confidence. Jim Mallinder has major 
issues to address.
 
Clermont have their fourth try through Sebastien Vahaamahina and are heading 
for their second bonus point win of the competition. Indeed, they’re set to be 
the first team to make it two wins from two, but you’d fancySaracens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens> to join them a bit later.

Try No5 … oh dear. The replacement scrum-half Antoine Dupont makes plonkers of 
theNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> defence, 
dances around them and splashes over in the corner. If Saracens’ was the best 
away performance from an English side in Europe then this can’t be far off the 
worst. Dumora converts again.

Well that didn’t last long did it. Smith, who already has two tries, turns 
provider forAlexandre Bias who goes over down the left. Julien Dumora converts, 
but that’s the bonus pointCastres <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> 
wanted, and deserved really.

Huzzah! Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> have 
some points! It’sWilson who goes over, finishing off an overlap on the right 
after more good work from Hutchinson. It looks so easy when it comes off … 
Stephen Myler converts.
 
Castres are struggling to get the fourth try and it’s beginning to effect them 
– they’re giving penalties away with the try-line in sight. It’s a damning 
indictment ofNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> 
that their main goal now is to deny their opponents a bonus point but they 
deserve nothing for their own efforts.

As an aside, Courtney Lawes has been average today. Following George Kruis’s 
ankle surgery you’d prefer him in better form if you’re an England fan.
 
Here’s the match report from Munster’s remarkable bonus point win over Glasgow 
for you to digest …

Hmmm. As poor as Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> have been, things aren’t 
going their way. Lee Dickson tapped a penalty and Kockott tackled him far too 
early. Having already been shown a yellow card it really should have been a red 
… but the referee didn’t agree. The fact that Castres then hooked Kockott 
immediately suggests the coaches did.

Castres <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres>, to rub salt into the 
wounds, scythe through Northampton from their own line to the Saints 22. 
Northampton scramble though, so the put in to the scrum is theirs.
 
Clermont have turned the tide – Wesley Fofana is over for their third try of 
the afternoon. Parra converts this time. So who’s going to score the bonus 
point try first, Clermont orCastres <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres>
? My money’s on Clermont.
 
Clermont appear to have turned the tide against Bordeaux with their second try 
of the match, shortly after half-time. This time it’sAlexandre Lapandry with 
the score.
 
Better from Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints>, 
first Haywood, then Hutchinson go up the middle. Tom Wood has rolled up his 
sleeves and is getting stuck in as well. Castres scramble well though, even if 
there looked like a high tackle in there somewhere.
 
That’s the end of Dylan Hartley’s day, replaced by Mike Haywood on his first 
appearance for six weeks. If Eddie Jones was watching he’s probably turned off 
now.
 
Try No3 for Castres <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> and that is 
game over. It came from a mistake from Michael Paterson and a clever dart from 
Kockott off the base of Castres’ dominant scrum and then the hosts just do the 
simple things right, work the ball wide toSmith on the left, who ghosts over 
for his second. Far, far too easy. Urdapilleta is on target with the conversion.

Northampton are on their way back out, no doubt with their ears still ringing. 
They really should be closer toCastres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> on the scoreboard but basic 
mistakes have cost them. A losing bonus point is the target now you feel.
 
Clermont have nosed themselves ahead at the break – Noa Nakaitaci’s try on 33 
minutes converted by Parra but it’s a far closer contest there than atCastres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> …

That’s another try for Castres, and that’s excellent from Kockott. Spotting 
the Northampton right wing James Wilson out of position he kicks over the top, 
gets lucky with the bounce, and after a phase or two, the propAntoine Tichit 
powers over. Urdapilleta converts just before half-time.Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> are treading water. Game 
over?
 
Teimana Harrison is playing, apparently. How his stock has fallen since the 
summer … Saints only have themselves to blame for this really, they’ve had 
their chances, went for the corner each time but haven’t been accurate enough.
 
The visitors have a second try at Clermont – Jayden Spence going over this 
time. Madigan converts again but Parra has since added a third penalty to keep 
the hosts in touching distance.
 
But there’s the breakthrough. Tulou rampages through the middle again and this 
timeDavid Smith is on hand to take the offload and cruise under the posts. 
Castres are down to 14 don’t forget. A long way back forNorthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints>.
 
Castres march Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints>
 back in the scrum again, and so Urdapilleta will have a ging from 50m. Castres 
came close to first try a few minutes ago, but Horacio Agulla was denied in the 
left corner after a fine break from Tulou up the middle.

Urdapilleta doesn’t have the distance so it’s as you were.
 
Parra has another penalty for Clermont, who are back to within a point against 
Bordeaux.
 
The referee has had enough of Castres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> infringements – and after Kockott 
is caught blatantly off his feet he’ll spend 10 minutes in the sin-bin. Saints 
go for the corner again but Harry Mallinder’s grubber comes to nothing.
 
Saints are coming back at Castres, whose No8 Alex Tulou is getting a ticking 
off from the referee Ian Davies.Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> opt for the corner rather 
than the posts, they’re almost over … so we’ll go to the TMO. “Try, yes or no?” 
is the question, but Picamoles is short so we’ll have a scrum.

It’s a huge scrum from Castres <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres>, 
who clear their lines through Rory Kockott.
 
A try from Jean-Marcellin Buttin, converted by Ian Madigan, has Bordeaux in 
front at Clermont, who are on the board with a Morgan Parra penalty.
 
A last-ditch tackle from George North stops a Castres try after Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> are carved apart by a 
lovely out-the-back pass from Robert Ebersohn. Castres were playing advantage 
though, and Urdapilleta is on target again.
 
Benjamin Urdapilleta is on target with a penalty after good work from the 
Castres blindside Mathieu Babillot.Northampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> haven’t started yet.

Northampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> are under 
early pressure but are keeping Castres at bay for the moment. Rory Hutchinson 
clears their lines and earns the visitors a breather.
 
A minute’s silence is observed before kick-off in Castres, and a minute’s 
applause at Clermont v Bordeaux, where there is plenty of red in the crowd.

Here are your teams for Castres v Northampton. A reminder that Castres were 
thoroughly beaten by Leinster last weekend while the Saints squeezed past 
Montpellier. Dylan Hartley makes his first appearance forNorthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> since 11 September.

Just five minutes to go until kick-off in two more of the afternoon’s matches 
– Castres vNorthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints> 
and Clermont v Bordeaux – but the celebrations and tributes will continue for a 
while yet at Thomond Park.

I’m getting ahead of myself here but if Munster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster> play like that for the rest of the 
competition, they may make it all the way to Murrayfield in May. And wouldn’t 
that be a fitting tribute to Foley.
 
Peter O’Mahony is speaking now, “God, I hope we did him proud today.”
 
The whole of Munster’s staff – playing and coaching – as well as Anthony 
Foley’s boys and his wife, Olive, are in a huddle on the pitch, singing Stand 
Up And Fight.

Glasgow go through umpteen phases before spilling the ball and Keatley boots 
the ball off the pitch for full time and the end to a spectacular performance 
fromMunster <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster>. They were down to 14 
men for 61 minutes but they steamrollered Glasgow, who had no answer.

CJ Stander, Dave Kilcoyne, Tyler Bleyendaal, Peter O’Mahony … Munster’s heroes 
were all over the pitch. You had to feel for Keith Earls and although his tip 
tackle on Fraser Brown probably warranted a red card, it was Earls who made the 
initial break for Bleyendaal’s first try which sparked this performance.

The Fields of Athenry rings out again as there are more tears among the 
Munster players but this was an incredible performance of aggression, 
commitment and red fury and the emotion now is to be expected.
 
Munster have the game won now as The Fields of Athenry rings out around 
Thomond Park once again. This has been some tribute to Anthony Foley.
 
That’ll do it. Munster <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster>, rolling 
back the years, go through phase after phase. No unnecessary risks, just giving 
it to the forwards and making a few yards at a time, marshalled superbly by 
Murray. And after Stander makes yet more ground, Scannell is over in the 
corner. Ian Keatley, on for Bleyendaal, converts.
 
Here they come again, spreading the ball through the backs, but Sean Lamont 
knocks on – a bad mistake.Munster <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster> 
scrum in the Glasgow half, and they won’t be rushing it.
 
Surely another one Glasgow, who attack from deep through Mark Bennett with 
Munster <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster> down to 13 temporarily … 
but what a tackle from Sweetnam. He did fantastically to deny Ali Price but the 
Warriors keep it alive and Bennett goes over. Russell converts … Glasgow need 
two converted tries for a draw!
 
Glasgow came close to a try a few minutes ago – on one of the rare occasions 
they have put width on the ball, Rory Hughes had a dart down the left but the 
coveringMunster <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster> defence shoved him 
out of play.

But Glasgow have their score through Pat McArthur, the replacement hooker. A 
textbook driving maul. Surely there’s no way back but these may be valuable 
points nonetheless in what is shaping up to be a tight pool. Russell converts.
