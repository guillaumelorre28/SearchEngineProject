RB Leipzig, playing their first season in the top flight, went back to the top 
of the Bundesliga with a comfortable 2-0 home win overHertha Berlin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/herthaberlin> on Saturday.

Timo Werner and Willi Orban scored either side of half-time as Leipzig bounced 
back from last Saturday’sshock 1-0 defeat at lowly Ingolstadt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/10/bundesliga-roundup-bayern-munich-top-rb-leipzig-lose>
, their only loss of the season.

Werner broke the deadlock five minutes before the interval when he cleverly 
controlled Naby Keïta’s pass into the area before firing past Rune Jarstein 
from close range.

Fourth-placed Hertha barely offered a threat and the result was never in doubt 
after Orban headed in the second goal in the 62nd minute when he was given a 
free header at a corner.

Leipzig have 36 points from 15 games, three more than Bayern Munich who will 
reclaim the lead if they win at bottom-of-the-table Darmstadt on Sunday.
