You state that John Berger (Obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary>, 
4 January) was born in Stoke Newington in 1926 and that it was only in the army 
that he had his first real encounter with working-class people. My family 
settled in Stoke Newington in 1936 and I was brought up there. It was an 
upper-working-class district. If Berger encountered no working-class people he 
must never have ventured into the street, the swimming baths, to the park or 
around the shops and pubs. I knew of no private schools or expensive 
restaurants, but he could have popped into Lyons tea shop in the high street 
for a cuppa in company with actual working-class people.

• In recent days I have read three separate reports in your newspaper relating 
to Cornwall – outstanding service given by Tesco in Penzance (Consumer 
champions, 31 December), the welcome given to Syrian refugees in Bude (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/cornwall-refugee-group-raises-thousands-pounds-resettle-syrian-families>
, 2 January) and the hospitality given in Camborne to black GIs (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/04/wartime-britain-and-black-gis-united-through-music>
, 5 January). Coincidence? I think not.

• Adam Morgan (There is a price to pay for hate speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/04/simon-schuster-alt-right-hate-breitbart-milo-yiannopoulos>

tomorrow’s statesman.

• Keith Flett (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/03/why-bookies-workers-are-odds-on-to-lose-out>
, 4 January) suggests more space for debate. But like social media, the 
Guardian is an echo chamber. Perhaps you could challenge the Mail to a joint 
letters page once a week as therapy?

• As a toddler, “a weetabic” was our son’s daily breakfast request (Letters

, 30 December).
