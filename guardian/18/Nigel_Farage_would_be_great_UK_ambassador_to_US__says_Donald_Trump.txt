The US president-elect, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, has suggested that the Ukip 
leader, Nigel Farage, should be the UK’s ambassador to the US.

“Many people would like to see [@Nigel_Farage] represent Great Britain as 
their Ambassador to the United States,” Trumptweeted 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/800887087780294656> on Monday 
evening. “He would do a great job!”

In a brief call with BBC Breakfast, Farage said he had been awake since 2am UK 
time when the tweet was first posted.

The Ukip leader said he was flattered by the tweet, calling it “a bolt from 
the blue” and said he did not see himself as a typical diplomatic figure “but 
this is not the normal course of events”.


But a Downing Street spokesman said: “There is no vacancy. We already have an 
excellent ambassador to the US.”

Farage said he had not been expecting Trump’s tweet, but said it was a signal 
that Downing Street needed to change its thinking about him.

“I can still scarcely believe that he did that though speaking to a couple of 
his longtime friends perhaps I am a little less surprised,” he wrote in an 
piece on Tuesday morning for rightwing site Breitbart.

“They all say the same thing: that Trump is a very loyal man and supports 
those that stand by him.”

Farage said personal relationships were key to how the former business tycoon 
operated. “Sadly, the cesspit that is career politics understands nothing of 
this,” he said. “In their world the concept of trust is transitory.”

Farage said it was further evidence a shakeup was needed at the top of 
politics, with a barely veiled dig at the prime minister. “Those who supported 
remain now hold senior positions,” he said. “Worst still, those who were openly 
abusive about Trump now pretend to be his friend. It is career politics at its 
worst and it is now getting in the way of the national interest.”

Repeating his offer of help, which had been rejected by Downing Street on 
multiple occasions, Farage said: “The world has changed and it’s time that 
Downing Street did too.”

Farage, an MEP and on-again-off-again

leader of Ukip for a decade, recentlysuggested he could launch an eighth bid to 
become an MP

.Seven previous attempts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/ukip-frustrated-share-vote-fails-translate-seats>
 were unsuccessful.

It is unprecedented for an incoming US president to ask a world leader to 
appoint an opposing party leader as ambassador, and the statement puts May in a 
difficult position.

Johnson on Trump’s ambassador Farage tweet: ‘There is no vacancy’ – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/22/boris-johnson-donald-trump-nigel-farage-ambassador-video>
Speaking in the House of Commons, foreign secretary Boris Johnson said Darroch 
was a “a first rate ambassador in Washington doing a very good job with the 
current administration and the administration to be, and there is no vacancy.”

Johnson said it was important to be “as positive as we possibly can be about 
working with the incoming US administration, it is incredibly important to both 
our country and the world. Judge that new administration by their actions in 
office, which we hope to shape and to influence.”
Fellow Conservative MP Dan Poulter asked Johnson to stress that those with a 
character such as Farage’s would not make good ambassadors. “Diplomats require 
diplomacy,” he told the House. “There should be no place for anyone who 
expresses inflammatory and what sometimes can be considered to be borderline 
racist views in representing this country in discussions with the United 
States.”

Johnson said he thought Poulter “captures the mood of the House” on the issue. 
“We have already settled that question, there is no vacancy.”

The role of UK ambassador to the US is among the most prestigious in the 
diplomatic service. Sir Kim Darroch, formerly the UK’s national security 
adviser and permanent representative to the European Union, took over the role 
in January.

The Ukip leader has previously said it was “obvious” that Darroch should 
resign, calling him part of the “old regime”.

But he told Sky News at that time he did not see himself as Darroch’s 
replacement: “I don’t think I will be the ambassadorial type. Whatever talents 
or flaws I have got I don’t think diplomacy is at the top of my list of skills.”

Raheem Kassam, the editor-in-chief of Breitbart London and a former aide to 
Farage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/31/raheem-kassam-pulls-out-of-ukip-leadership-contest>
,tweeted <https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/800913444799184896> that he 
had woken the Ukip leader to tell him the news: “Safe to say he was enormously 
flattered.”

Sir Christopher Meyer, the former British ambassador to Washington, said he 
was baffled by the tweet. “UK ambassador in DC exists to defend UK interests in 
US, not US interests in UK,”he tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/SirSocks/status/800972860714008576?lang=en>. “Can’t have 
foreign presidents deciding who our [ambassador] should be.”

David Davis, the Brexit secretary, reiterated Downing Street’s line, telling 
the BBC: “People can say what they like but the simple truth is there’s no 
vacancy. The ambassador there is very, very good, as we’ve seen.”

Farage has no diplomatic experience but worked hard to align himself with 
Trump during the US election campaign.

However, one ally of Farage suggested May could solve a political problem for 
her party by appointing the Ukip leader, saying it would be an effective way of 
ending Ukip as a force in British politics.

Trump took to comparing his campaign to that behind the successful call for 
the UK to leave the EU, often mentioning Farage at his rallies and referring to 
himself as “Mr Brexit”.

The two met again recently at Trump Tower in New York, and Farage tweeted a 
picture of the two of them, adding: “It was a great honour to spend time with 
[Trump]. He was relaxed and full of good ideas. I’m confident he will be a good 
president.”

views fromhis Scottish golf courses

.

Andy Wigmore, a communications officer for one of the groups campaigning to 
leave the EU who was at the meeting alongside Farage, told theDaily Express 
<http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/734195/Donald-trump-Nigel-Farage-Scottish-wind-farms>
: “We covered a lot of ground during the hour-long meeting we had.

“But one thing Mr Trump kept returning to was the issue of wind farms. He is a 
complete Anglophile and also absolutely adores Scotland, which he thinks is one 
of the most beautiful places on Earth.

“But he is dismayed that his beloved Scotland has become over-run with ugly 
wind farms, which he believes are a blight on the stunning landscape.”

Farage is expecting an invitation to Trump’s inauguration in January, sources 
havetold the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/20/nigel-farage-invitation-donald-trump-inauguration>
, which increases pressure on May to give him a role in UK-US diplomatic 
relations.

The prime minister is already on the back foot after Farage claimed Trump’s 
team had raised concerns with him in their meeting about hostile comments made 
by Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and May’s joint chiefs of staff about 
his campaign.

Farage was the first foreign politician to meet Trump after his shock win and 
offered to act as a go-between for the British government and the US – a 
suggestion swiftly knocked back by Downing Street, whichinsisted there was no 
need for a “third party”
