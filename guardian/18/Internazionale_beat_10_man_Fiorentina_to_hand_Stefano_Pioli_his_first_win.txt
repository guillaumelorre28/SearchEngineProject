Grégoire Defrel’s stunning equaliser snapped Sassuolo’s losing streak and

beat Andrea Consigli and gave the hosts a deserved 42nd-minute lead.

Sassuolo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sassuolo> improved after the 
break and ended a run of four straight league defeats when Marcello Gazzola’s 
fine cross from the right was brilliantly dispatched on the volley by Defrel 
from near the penalty spot.

25 points from 14 games and are eight points behind Juventus, who lead the 
table by four points from Roma and Milan.
