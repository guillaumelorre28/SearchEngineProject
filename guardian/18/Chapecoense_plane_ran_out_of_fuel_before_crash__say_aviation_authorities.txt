A plane that crashed while carrying a Brazilian football team had run out of 
fuel before it could land, according to Colombian aviation authorities.

The Civil Aeronautics agency said the conclusion was based on the aircraft’s 
black boxes and other evidence. It said the evidence pointed to human error 
rather than technical problems or sabotage.

Experts had previously suggested fuel exhaustion led to the crash on 28 
November that killed all but a few members of the Chapecoense football team, as 
well as team officials and journalists accompanying them to a championship 
playoff match in Medellín,Colombia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia>
. Seventy-one people died in the incident.

The BAE 146 Avro RJ85 has a maximum range of 2,965 km (1,600 nautical miles), 
just under the distance between Medellín and Santa Cruz in Bolivia, where the 
plane had taken off at almost capacity.

The jet was airborne for about four hours and 20 minutes when air traffic 
controllers in Medellín instructed the pilot to fly in a holding pattern 
because another flight had reported a suspected fuel leak and was given 
priority.

In a recording of a radio message from the pilot of the LaMia flight, he can 
be heard repeatedly requesting permission to land due to a lack of fuel and a 
“total electric failure”.

A surviving flight attendant and a pilot flying nearby also overheard the 
frantic pleas from the doomed airliner. Officials also noted that there was no 
explosion upon impact, pointing to a scarcity of fuel.
