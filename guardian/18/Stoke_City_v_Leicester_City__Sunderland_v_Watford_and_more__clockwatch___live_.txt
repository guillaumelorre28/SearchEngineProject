On an afternoon when Chelsea stretched their Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> lead to nine points with 
their eleventh consecutive win and Leicester staged their own little 
pre-Chrismtas miracle by coming from a man and two goals down to mug Stoke City 
for a point, Sunderland were perhaps the biggest winners with a victory over 
Watford that moves them to two places up the table. There was misery for Hull 
City, who really didn’t deserve to lose against West Ham, while Swansea City

at Middlesbrough. Meanwhile at the Hawthorns, Manchester United have taken an

A Kirkcaldy wrap from Simon McMahon

Our Dundee United correspondent has had a frustrating afternoon: “Strange 
second half at Starks Park,” he writes after his team’s stalemate with Raith 
Rovers. “Finished 0-0 but United played most of it with 10 men, from which 
point they completely dominated and missed a penalty. Still, the point takes up 
top on our own, for a couple of hours at least.”

Late drama in the second tier

Championship: Cardiff City end their afternoon without a point despite their 
spirited comeback from 3-1 down against Barnsley to level the scores in the 
89th minute. Ryan Williams pooped their party with a winner deep in added time 
to give the visitors all three points. At Hillsborough, Sheffield Wednesday 
nicked all three points against Rotherham courtesy of a late Steven Fletcher 
penalty.

GOAL! Stoke City 2-1 Leicester

Premier League: They may be down to 10 men, but Leicester have pulled a goal 
back against Stoke City at the Britannia. Leonardo Ulloa keeps them in the game 
with a header that Ryan Shawcross couldn’t prevent from crossing the line. 
Referee Craig Pawson points to the device on his wrist to let everyone know 
technology has decreed that the goal should stand.

Another email from Simon McMahon

Scottish Championship: “Marvellous travelling support for [Dundee] United at 
Raith Rovers, must be around 3000,” writes our Tangerines correspondent. 
“They’ve not had too much to shout about in the first half though as it’s 
currently goalless.” And goalless it remains as the game goes into its final 20 
minutes.

It's all going pear-shaped for Leicester ...

Premier League: After seeing Jamie Vardy sent off just before the half-hour 
mark, six of his 10 remaining team-mates have been booked: Danny Simpson, Islam 
Slimani, Andy King, Christian Fuchs, Marc Albrighton and Robert Huth have all 
had their names taken, while Kasper Schmeichel had to restrain Claudio Ranieri 
as he attempted to confront the referee at half-time.

GOAL! Sunderland 1-0 Watford

Premier League: Patrick van Aanholt puts his miss before half-time behind him 
to give Sunderland the lead against Watford at the Stadium of Light. He needed 
two attempts: his first shot was blocked, but the ball broke kindly for him to 
ram it in off the post for his third goal of the season.

No goals at the Stadium of Light ...

Premier League: Watford had Sunderland under the cosh for almost the entire 
first half, but couldn’t find the back of the net despite several good chances. 
Patrick van Aanholt missed a great chance to give Sunderland a half-time lead 
they wouldn’t have deserved just before the break. The home side were booed off 
as they went in for their half-time brew and a rollocking from David Moyes. 
They’ll need to up their game if they’re to take anything from this match.

More bad news for Leicester

Premier League: Down to 10 men after Jamie Vardy’s dismissal, Leicester City 
are now behind at Stoke. Bojan scored from the spot after 39 minutes. Danny 
Simpson was the culprit, getting penalised and booked for a hand-ball in the 
penalty area.

On an afternoon when Chelsea stretched their Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> lead to nine points with 
their eleventh consecutive win and Leicester staged their own little 
pre-Chrismtas miracle by coming from a man and two goals down to mug Stoke City 
for a point, Sunderland were perhaps the biggest winners with a victory over 
Watford that moves them to two places up the table. There was misery for Hull 
City, who really didn’t deserve to lose against West Ham, while Swansea City 
found themselves on the wrong end of another hiding after shipping three goals 
at Middlesbrough. Meanwhile at the Hawthorns, Manchester United have taken an 
early lead against West Brom courtesy of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Lawrence Ostlere’s 
providing minute-by-minute updates on that one, so I’ll steer you his way ...

Our Dundee United correspondent has had a frustrating afternoon: “Strange 
second half at Starks Park,” he writes after his team’s stalemate with Raith 
Rovers. “Finished 0-0 but United played most of it with 10 men, from which 
point they completely dominated and missed a penalty. Still, the point takes up 
top on our own, for a couple of hours at least.”
 
La Liga: Atletico Madrid have beaten Las Palmas by a solitary goal to earn 
their first win in three Spanish league games. It leaves them in fifth place, 
one point behind Villarreal, who were victorious over Sporting Gijon earlier 
today.

Scottish Championship: “Marvellous travelling support for [Dundee] United at 
Raith Rovers, must be around 3000,” writes our Tangerines correspondent. 
“They’ve not had too much to shout about in the first half though as it’s 
currently goalless.” And goalless it remains as the game goes into its final 20 
minutes.

as he attempted to confront the referee at half-time.
 
Premier League: Patrick van Aanholt puts his miss before half-time behind him 
to give Sunderland the lead against Watford at the Stadium of Light. He needed 
two attempts: his first shot was blocked, but the ball broke kindly for him to

Scottish Premiership: Sean Welsh has equalised for Partick Thistle against 
Hearts. It’s 1-1 at Tynecastle.
 
Premier League: Watford had Sunderland under the cosh for almost the entire 
first half, but couldn’t find the back of the net despite several good chances. 
Patrick van Aanholt missed a great chance to give Sunderland a half-time lead 
they wouldn’t have deserved just before the break. The home side were booed off 
as they went in for their half-time brew and a rollocking from David Moyes. 
They’ll need to up their game if they’re to take anything from this match.
