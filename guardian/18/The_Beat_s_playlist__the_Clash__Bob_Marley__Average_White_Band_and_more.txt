(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais – the Clash

This was one of the first punk tunes that really caught me, it was the moment 
when the Clash grew up. It demonstrated group’s courage to delve into different 
styles of music and expresses that there is no difference in colour, that we 
were all in the same boat.

Pick Up the Pieces – Average White Band

This is the first single I ever bought. I was 13 at the time and used my paper 
round money to buy the single which cost 50p. Anytime this amazing tune came on 
at the school disco, everybody would get up and go to the dance floor.

Get Up, Stand Up – Bob Marley and the Wailers

This is obviously a freedom anthem which appeals to us all. He wasn’t wrong 
when he sang: “You can fool some people sometimes, but you can’t fool all the 
people all the time. So now we see the light, we gonna stand up for our rights!”
