The US president reassured Turnbull that the US-Australia alliance would 
remain strong and transcended “party politics”.

“I indicated to him my confidence the US-Australian alliance will remain as 
robust as ever,” he told reporters in Lima.

Turnbull had nominated trade and security as key points of discussion during 
the 50-minute meeting, which was the last bilateral meeting held with Obama at 
the summit.


Obama said he would do everything he could to ensure “a strong handoff” in the 
relationship with the Trump administration.

“It’s not often that I have a meeting and have got nothing to disagree with,” 
Obama said, adding there was a strong alignment in both countries’ interests.

Turnbull said that it was a “great moment but a sad moment” to be meeting with 
Obama for the last time.

“Thank you for the leadership you have shown in your country and the world 
over eight years,” he said.

The pair discussed the fight against Islamic State extremists in the Middle 
East.

“Australia has been our most stalwart ally when it comes to troop 
deployments,” Obama said.

Strategic issues such as the South China Sea maritime dispute were also 
discussed. The leaders both trumpeted the merits of free trade and thelikely 
doomed Trans-Pacific Partnership pact.

Turnbull also thanked Obama for his cooperation on resettling refugees in 
limbo on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. So far no numbers and 
timeframes have been set and it is not clear whether the Trump administration 
will support the deal.

Turnbull earlier met with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, where 
it’s understood migration was among the topics covered along with economic 
ties, security and defence cooperation, counter-terrorism and youth mobility.

The discussion comes as the federal government continues to search for third 
countries to send refugees on Nauru and Manus Island – and with the future of 
the US deal looking shaky. The exact nature of the migration discussion has not 
been made public.

The Australian government says it’s in negotiations with a range of countries 
to accept the refugees in limbo, but has not named specific nations.

Canada <https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada> has been globally lauded for 
its warm welcome of 34,696 Syrian refugees to its shores in the past 12 months.

Over the same time period Australia has resettled only half  
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/08/australia-criticised-over-hollow-promise-to-resettle-12000-syrian-and-iraqi-refugees>
of its special intake of 12,000 Syrians and Iraqis fleeing Isis.

Turnbull also had talks on Saturday with Malaysia’s prime minister, Najib Razak

, and it’s believed “irregular migration” was canvassed. The meeting came in 
the wake of speculation that Australia was close to a deal with Kuala Lumpur to 
resettle refugees.

Labor is unimpressed with the prospect of a deal in the wake of the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> blocking legislation for 
a Malaysia people swap deal in 2011.

Tony Abbott has since retrospectively expressed some regret that as opposition 
leader he hadn’t allowed the Gillard government to pursue its mandate.

Under the arrangement 800 refugees that had arrived in Australia by boat were 
to be exchanged with 4,000 verified refugees inMalaysia

Turnbull has played down claims of hypocrisy, saying the most important thing 
was to achieve “durable” resettlement options rather than make political points.
