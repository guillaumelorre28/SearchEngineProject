Gerrard said he would consider his options after it was announced on Tuesday 
that he would be leaving Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy.

It was reported by Sky Sports that Gerrard had been offered the MK Dons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> job and that he would confirm on 
Monday whether he will accept it.

Later on Saturday, ESPN FC said sources close to Gerrard have disclosed that 
the 36-year-old will turn down the chance to become the Dons’ new boss.

MK Dons drew 0-0 at Bristol Rovers on Saturday and the caretaker manager, 
Richie Barker, said afterwards that he was looking forward to Tuesday’s league 
visit of Chesterfield.

“At the moment I expect to be in charge for the next game. I haven’t been told 
any different,” he said.

“I’ll start preparing for Tuesday and, unless I get a phone call before then, 
we will start working on that game on Monday.

“The situation needs to be sorted out, but I have said from day one that it’s 
not about how much time it takes. Most people know we are getting close. The 
important thing is to get the right man, whoever that might be.

“In terms of what I have been asked to do, it’s just a case of continuing and 
I’m fine with that.”
