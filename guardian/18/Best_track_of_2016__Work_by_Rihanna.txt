There was a school of thought, loudly expressed at the time of the song’s 
release, that Work was not sufficiently commercial to be a Rihanna single. It 
certainly sounded pretty understated compared to its blockbusting predecessors: 
thePaul McCartney and Kanye West collaboration FourFiveSeconds 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt0g4dWxEBo>, the controversial and provocative
Bitch Better Have My Money <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3eAMGXFw1o>, the 
epic, dubstep-infused balladAmerican Oxygen 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao8cGLIMtvg>. R&B stars seldom have hits with 
skeletal dancefloor tracks sung in thick patois, even if they are decorated 
with a guest verse by Drake. The last time anything like that topped the US 
charts was a decade ago, when Sean Paul was at the height of his fame. At least 
one critic opined that Work sounded unfinished.

The critics had a point about how minimal it was – there’s almost nothing to 
Work beyond a beat, a bassline, a vocal and an extremely subtly deployed 
interpolation from Alexander O’Neil’s mid-80s Mellow Magic-friendly smoocherIf 
You Were Here Tonight <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6_YdLAu5Zc> – but 
otherwise they couldn’t have been more wrong. Work turned out to be 2016’s 
omnipresent hit: it topped the charts from Brazil to Belgium, its success 
paving the way for more dancehall-influenced pop hits, includingSia’s Cheap 
Thrills <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31crA53Dgu0>. It happened because 
everything about Work clicks: it is perfect pop songwriting that blithely 
ignores most current trends in pop. There’s no big chorus, but the hook burrows 
into your brain; the rhythm feels off-kilter but propels everything forward; 
Rihanna’s performance is coolly restrained but really appealing.

Meanwhile, the lyrics were snappy and smart – “You took my heart off my 
sleeve” – and there was something really appealing about the way Drake’s cameo 
appearance played against Rihanna’s vocal. He begs, he pleads, he turns on the 
charm (“If you had a twin I would still chose you”) and he does that 
passive-aggressive Drake thing of subtly implying he’s somehow morally superior 
to his amorata: “Who am I to hold your past against you?” She tells him to get 
stuffed: “Nuh time to have your lurking.” Given that she’s dealing withR&B’s 
king of injured feelings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/drake-views-review-hip-hop-king-tightens-grip>
, there’s something particularly piquant about the kiss-off: “Me nuh cyar if 
him hurting.”


Work works perfectly: proof that subtlety trumps glitz, that you don’t need 
spectacular fireworks if everything already sparks.
