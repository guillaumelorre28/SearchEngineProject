Job done for Spurs. Not an outstanding performance by any means, but it was 
better in the second half and the subs had a big impact. They’re through to the 
next round, and Villa slink home in despair. Or can concentrate on winning 
promotion. One of the two.

90 mins + 3: Should be three for Spurs, after Onomah does good work to play in 
Son, but he dithers a little too long and Johnstone rushes out to smother the 
effort.

90 mins: McCormack has a go at another free-kick, but he thunks this one 
straight into the wall. Not going brilliantly for him at the Villa.

89 mins: Villa looking for a consolation, as McCormack lines up a 
free-kick...but puts it over the bar. The trouble with their first-half 
bus-parking was that it’s quite difficult to change when required. And they 
haven’t done a good enough job of doing that.

87 mins: Alli tries a backheel, but that’s an Olé! too far. Spurs have looked 
a changed team since he came on, though.

the box, slides a cross into the area but it’s about half a yard ahead of

that was quite a low bar to hurdle.

80 mins: Nice goal, that. N’Koudou booms a big ball from left to right, 
Trippier plays it to Sissoko, who plays it back to Trippier, who plays it back 
to Sissoko, who runs into the area on the right, slips a nice square to Son who 
slots it home neatly. Nice goal, that.

79 mins: Sissoko is through, finding himself free on goal from the left side 
of the box, he opens his body and tries to guide it into the far corner, but 
Johnstone stops it with his knee.

74 mins: Dier then tries another shot from way out, which goes about 20 yards

73 mins: Dier gets a free-kick just outside the box to the right of centre,

71 mins: Instant impact from the sub N’Koudou, who exchanges passes with Alli 
then crosses for Davies, who for some reason finds himself eight yards out, and 
he directs a delightful header into the far corner. Lovely stuff.

67 mins: Spurs sweep diagonally across the pitch, and Davies gets the ball on 
the left of the area, but crosses without looking up - if he had, he might have 
seen that there was no forward in the box waiting for the ball.

65 mins: Close! Two quick chances for Villa, as a free-kick into the box falls 
for Baker, whose effort is brilliantly blocked by Carter-Vickers, then the ball 
squirts to Agbonlahor, who doesn’t quite get enough on the shot, which is 
saved. Could, perhaps should’ve been a goal.

62 mins: A rare Villa attack, as Adomah skips down the right, clips a cross 
into the middle towards Tshibola, but Carter-Vickers LLP heads away. Spurs then 
go up the other end and Son launches a ferocious shot towards goal, which 
Johnstone does well to tip over the bar.

61 mins: David Wall thinks we should go the other way on the replays debate: 
“Rather than abolishing replays I’d like to see the limit to one replay 
abolished so that there was the possibility of those marathon ties over 3 or 4 
games that were so distinctive of theFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> in past seasons. And, perversely, 
I think it might encourage teams to go for the win. It’s one thing to play 
cautiously and face just an extra game. It’s another altogether to risk having 
to play an extra two or three games that would probably have an 
Isner-Mahut-like effect of destroying the rest of your season through 
exhaustion and fixture pile-up.”

58 mins: Corner for Spurs on the right, which Trippier pings into the near 
post where Janssen gets a head to it, but it goes wide. There’s a hint of a 
deflection off Baker, but ref Dean - disappointingly low-key thus far - says no 
corner.

54 mins: Winks dispossesses Grealish about halfway inside his own half, then 
runs to the other end of the pitch and, after exchanging passes with Son, 
crosses towards Sissoko, but that ball is intercepted and cleared.

51 mins: Oh good lord. Trippier crosses from the right, brilliantly, and it 
reaches Son at the back stick, on the corner of the six-yard box. He has time 
to control it, compose himself, pick his spot...but scuffs it and the ball 
dribbles along the edge of the six yard box.

49 mins: Adomah skims a cross over from the right, finding Bacuna on the left. 
Nothing comes of it, but at least there’s some smidgen of attacking intent from

Some thoughts on the ‘abolishing replays’ debate:

Kelvin: “I doubt abolishing replays would help matters. I think lower league 
teams would be happier to defend and wait for penalties. They have a much 
higher chance of winning via penalties than ‘going all out for it.’”

Robert Coughlan: “You only have to consider today’s Liverpool-Plymouth. The 
latter had every incentive to hold out for bringing this crack EPL team down to 
their local stadium...”

Adrian Low: “Why don’t we do the more exciting penalty shoot out, and if there 
is a tie, we can do 90 minutes of football.”

Gamage. “I don’t think he fancied any more of that either. “See if you can do 
any better in 15 eh lads?”

Debate! Do we think this?
Pete Mumola (@nolecat34) 
@NickMiller79 <https://twitter.com/NickMiller79> re: lower league teams 
sitting deep. Do you think getting rid of replays might encourage teams to "go 
for it" more?

It does seem a little churlish to complain about a lower-league team sitting 
deep and defending a lot in anFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> game, and one doesn’t wish to 
labour the point...but man this is desperate.

45 mins: Carter-Vickers stabs out a bad touch by Agbonlahor, and the Villa man 
lets out a remarkably high-pitched squeal of frustration that a corner isn’t 
given.

43 mins: Almost a moment of high slapstick to liven things up. Son and Janssen 
play a one-two, the Korean winger is through in the box but slightly 
miscontrols, Amavi gets a foot to it and nearly puts it into the corner of his 
own net. It drifts just wide.

manage it but a combination of Davies and Janssen earns Spurs a corner. Can 
they do anything with it?

38 mins: In a game earlier this season Janssen was clocked as (I think) 
Tottenham’s second-quickest player, but helooks so, so slow most of the time, 
maybe in thought rather than legs.

And here is Sachin Nakrani’s match report from White Hart Lane:

Son Heung-min secures Tottenham’s FA Cup passage against Aston Villa

Job done for Spurs. Not an outstanding performance by any means, but it was 
better in the second half and the subs had a big impact. They’re through to the 
next round, and Villa slink home in despair. Or can concentrate on winning 
promotion. One of the two.

Peeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
90 mins + 3: Should be three for Spurs, after Onomah does good work to play in 
Son, but he dithers a little too long and Johnstone rushes out to smother the 
effort.
 
90 mins: McCormack has a go at another free-kick, but he thunks this one 
straight into the wall. Not going brilliantly for him at the Villa.
 
89 mins: Villa looking for a consolation, as McCormack lines up a 
free-kick...but puts it over the bar. The trouble with their first-half 
bus-parking was that it’s quite difficult to change when required. And they 
haven’t done a good enough job of doing that.
 
87 mins: Alli tries a backheel, but that’s an Olé! too far. Spurs have looked 
a changed team since he came on, though.
 
85 mins: Close for Spurs, as N’Koudou makes fine tracks down the left side of 
the box, slides a cross into the area but it’s about half a yard ahead of 
Onomah.

84 mins: Sub for Spurs, as Josh Onomah is on for Sissoko. 
 
82 mins: That’ll be that, presumably. This second half has been better, but 
that was quite a low bar to hurdle.
 
80 mins: Nice goal, that. N’Koudou booms a big ball from left to right, 
Trippier plays it to Sissoko, who plays it back to Trippier, who plays it back 
to Sissoko, who runs into the area on the right, slips a nice square to Son who 
slots it home neatly. Nice goal, that.
 
And that should be that.

79 mins: Sissoko is through, finding himself free on goal from the left side 
of the box, he opens his body and tries to guide it into the far corner, but 
Johnstone stops it with his knee.
 
78 mins: There’s something you don’t see every day - Vorm makes something of a 
mess of a clearance and drills it at about shin-height, but the ball makes it 
all the way to Son up front...and he’s flagged offside.
 
77 mins: TRIPLE SUBSTITUTION. Villa go big, as Adomah, Agbonlahor and Jedinak 
are withdrawn, and in their places come Ross McCormack, Keinan Davis and Andre 
Green.
 
74 mins: Dier then tries another shot from way out, which goes about 20 yards 
over the bar. Somewhere between the last two Eric, and you’ll be grand.
 
73 mins: Dier gets a free-kick just outside the box to the right of centre, 
which he shoots straight into the wall. It’s not Marseille anymore, Eric.
 
71 mins: Instant impact from the sub N’Koudou, who exchanges passes with Alli 
then crosses for Davies, who for some reason finds himself eight yards out, and 
he directs a delightful header into the far corner. Lovely stuff.
 
At last!

69 mins: Alli feeds Winks, who shoots but it’s deflected, and Johnstone saves. 
Another switch for Spurs - Georges-Kevin N’Koudou is on for Alderweireld.
 
67 mins: Spurs sweep diagonally across the pitch, and Davies gets the ball on 
the left of the area, but crosses without looking up - if he had, he might have 
seen that there was no forward in the box waiting for the ball.
 
65 mins: Close! Two quick chances for Villa, as a free-kick into the box falls 
for Baker, whose effort is brilliantly blocked by Carter-Vickers, then the ball 
squirts to Agbonlahor, who doesn’t quite get enough on the shot, which is 
saved. Could, perhaps should’ve been a goal.
 
62 mins: A rare Villa attack, as Adomah skips down the right, clips a cross 
into the middle towards Tshibola, but Carter-Vickers LLP heads away. Spurs then 
go up the other end and Son launches a ferocious shot towards goal, which 
Johnstone does well to tip over the bar.

61 mins: David Wall thinks we should go the other way on the replays debate: 
“Rather than abolishing replays I’d like to see the limit to one replay 
abolished so that there was the possibility of those marathon ties over 3 or 4 
games that were so distinctive of theFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> in past seasons. And, perversely, 
I think it might encourage teams to go for the win. It’s one thing to play 
cautiously and face just an extra game. It’s another altogether to risk having 
to play an extra two or three games that would probably have an 
Isner-Mahut-like effect of destroying the rest of your season through 
exhaustion and fixture pile-up.”
 
60 mins: Sub for Spurs, as Janssen trudges off, Alli replacing him. A change 
in system, perhaps?
 
58 mins: Corner for Spurs on the right, which Trippier pings into the near 
post where Janssen gets a head to it, but it goes wide. There’s a hint of a 
deflection off Baker, but ref Dean - disappointingly low-key thus far - says no 
corner.
 
56 mins: The Villa fans seem to be having quite a nice time. So that’s good. 
It’s nice to have a nice time.
 
55 mins: Looks like Dele Alli is about to come on, in order to give this game 
a kick in the pants.

54 mins: Winks dispossesses Grealish about halfway inside his own half, then 
runs to the other end of the pitch and, after exchanging passes with Son, 
crosses towards Sissoko, but that ball is intercepted and cleared.
 
53 mins: Adam Griffiths is back: “Sam Johnstone. Green shirt, black boots, 
haircut you can set your watch to. Proper goalie look. Easily man of the match 
on those grounds alone.”
 
51 mins: Oh good lord. Trippier crosses from the right, brilliantly, and it 
reaches Son at the back stick, on the corner of the six-yard box. He has time 
to control it, compose himself, pick his spot...but scuffs it and the ball 
dribbles along the edge of the six yard box.
 
49 mins: Adomah skims a cross over from the right, finding Bacuna on the left. 
Nothing comes of it, but at least there’s some smidgen of attacking intent from 
Villa.
 
46 mins: We’re back. Janssen has a shot in the first few seconds of the half. 
It’s straight at the keeper, but it’s a good start.

Some thoughts on the ‘abolishing replays’ debate:

Kelvin: “I doubt abolishing replays would help matters. I think lower league 
teams would be happier to defend and wait for penalties. They have a much 
higher chance of winning via penalties than ‘going all out for it.’”

Robert Coughlan: “You only have to consider today’s Liverpool-Plymouth. The 
latter had every incentive to hold out for bringing this crack EPL team down to 
their local stadium...”

Adrian Low: “Why don’t we do the more exciting penalty shoot out, and if there 
is a tie, we can do 90 minutes of football.”
 
“Mike Dean blew up exactly as the clock ticked over from 44:59,” writes Martin 
Gamage. “I don’t think he fancied any more of that either. “See if you can do 
any better in 15 eh lads?”

Not all heroes wear capes, Martin. 
 
Debate! Do we think this?
Pete Mumola (@nolecat34) 
@NickMiller79 <https://twitter.com/NickMiller79> re: lower league teams 
sitting deep. Do you think getting rid of replays might encourage teams to "go 
for it" more?
 <https://twitter.com/nolecat34/status/818137532080721920> January 8, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/nolecat34/status/818137532080721920>  
“I went to sort out the recycling for tomorrow pretty confident I wouldn’t 
miss much,” writes Adam Griffiths. “On the plus side, the second half must be 
better. Mustn’t it?”
 
It does seem a little churlish to complain about a lower-league team sitting 
deep and defending a lot in anFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> game, and one doesn’t wish to 
labour the point...but man this is desperate.
 
Ppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins: Carter-Vickers stabs out a bad touch by Agbonlahor, and the Villa man 
lets out a remarkably high-pitched squeal of frustration that a corner isn’t 
given.
 
43 mins: Almost a moment of high slapstick to liven things up. Son and Janssen 
play a one-two, the Korean winger is through in the box but slightly 
miscontrols, Amavi gets a foot to it and nearly puts it into the corner of his 
own net. It drifts just wide.
 
41 mins: No. 
 
40 mins: Winks tries to battle through about four Villa players, doesn’t 
manage it but a combination of Davies and Janssen earns Spurs a corner. Can 
they do anything with it?
 
38 mins: In a game earlier this season Janssen was clocked as (I think) 
Tottenham’s second-quickest player, but helooks so, so slow most of the time, 
maybe in thought rather than legs.
 
37 mins: A brief moment of football breaks out: Sissoko slips a nice ball to 
Davies down the left side of the box, but the low cross goes behind anyone who 
might have been able to do anything with it.
 
35 mins: Divij Jain suggests: “How about Arsenal’s duo of Jeff Reine-Adelaide 
and Ainsley Maitland-Niles?” I’m having the latter, but not the former. Is 
‘Jeff’ a surname?
 
34 mins: This is a bad game. A bad game of football. Help.
