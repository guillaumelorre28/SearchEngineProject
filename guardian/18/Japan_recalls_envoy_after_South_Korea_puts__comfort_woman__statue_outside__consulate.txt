Besides the recall of ambassador Yasumasa Nagamine, Suga also said Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> was ordering home its consul-general 
in Busan – the city featuring the offending statue – and suspending discussions 
on a Japan-South Korea currency swap.

“The Japanese government will continue to strongly urge the South Korean 
government as well as municipalities concerned to quickly remove the statue of 
the girl,” Suga said.

The statue was initially removed after being set up by South Korean activists 
in the southern port city.
