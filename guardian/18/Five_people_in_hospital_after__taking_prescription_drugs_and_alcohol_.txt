Five people have been taken to hospital after falling ill at a sheltered 
housing unit, having taken what police believe was a mix of prescription drugs 
and alcohol.

Three men aged 28, 31 and 36, and two women aged 33 and 40, are said to be in 
a stable condition following what was initially described as a disturbance in 
Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, at about 2.30pm on Saturday.

It is believed that all five had taken prescription medication along with 
alcohol and other drugs. Police Scotland are appealing for information about 
the illegal distribution of prescription medication in the area.

Two of those who fell ill were taken by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth 
University hospital in Glasgow, and the others are being treated at Royal 
Alexandra hospital in Paisley.

DI Andy Doherty said: “Inquiries are continuing to establish the full 
circumstances and how these people came to be unwell.

“I would like to reassure the local community that there was no violence 
involved in this incident. Anyone with information regarding the illegal 
distribution of prescribed medication in the West Dunbartonshire area is asked 
to contact Clydebank CID via 101.”
