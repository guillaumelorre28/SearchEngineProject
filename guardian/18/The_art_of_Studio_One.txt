With its roots in Clement "Sir Coxsone" Dodd's Downbeat soundsystem, Studio 
One was unrivalled in Jamaica as the engine room for the emergent sound of 
reggae. All accounts of its heyday in the early-60s give the impression of 
Dodd's Brentford Road base being a kind of West Indian Stella Street: Lee Perry 
recording Delroy Wilson, Peter Tosh introducing Leonard Dillon of the 
Ethiopians, and Horace Andy queuing for a Sunday morning audition, all while 
Dodd was helping to piece together the Skatalites.

As a new book devoted to the label's cover art illustrates, Studio One also 
branched out into gospel, calypso and mento recordings, and even sessions by 
Indian devotional musician Sri Chinmoy. This restless musicality is reflected 
in the design aesthetic of the studio. Early releases are roughly akin to 
billboard adverts with heavily descriptive copy hyping the music. Later sleeves 
range from impactful screenprinting and stripped-down monochrome to cartoonish 
illustrations and heavily treated photography. Fonts similarly range from slim, 
art deco sans serif to the kind of multicoloured, lunatic typefaces more 
commonly seen on the sides of fairground rides.

More than most labels, Studio One proves that the saddest aspect of the switch 
to digital formats is the loss of the 12-inch sleeve. In an era where we take 
"good" (ie tasteful, slightly boring) design as a basic norm, achievable by 
anybody with a computer, this book is a vital window into a period when design 
– like music itself – was a hands-on process.
