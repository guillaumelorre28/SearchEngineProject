We can't go out at the moment, obviously, what with this tantrum of a weather, 
so what we do is sit on the sofa under a blanket in our slipper socks and browse
Whereisitsunny.com <http://whereisitsunny.com/>. The website is on Twitter, 
too, updating us British masochists with news of Acharavi, Luxor, Delhi and 
Puerto Plata. Places where you can breakfast outside, where you have to shower 
twice a day because it's just too hot. Places where you hang your swimming 
costume on a tree and it dries in the time it takes for you to cut up a mango. 
I want to go to there.

This was the coldest March in 50 years. Do you remember sun? What it feels 
like to be warm? As I write, there is ice on the window ledge, and my colleague 
is wearing double fleece. Never have we been more in need of half an hour lying 
in dappled sunlight with a book and a drink.

So here. Here you go. Here is a list of the places where it is sunny, because 
they do exist. If you go, please send a postcard. For us to burn for heat.
