 soundtrack.

The tracklisting for the follow-up to Trainspotting is a combination of 
heritage artists and music from the original score: Lust for Life has been 
remixed by the Prodigy, and Slow Slippy, a reworked version of Underworld’s 
Born Slippy, closes the album.

As well as tracks by the Clash, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Blondie, Queen and 
Run DMC, there are three songs byEdinburgh’s Mercury prize-winning trio

 Young Fathers, and Dad’s Best Friend bythe Rubberbandits

Limerick.

Featuring some of the 90s’ most defining tracks, the original Trainspotting  
soundtrack was a huge success, and was released as two albums: the first came 
out in 1996, and a second, featuring songs from the film that didn’t make the 
first album, was released a year later due to popular demand. According to 
Official Charts Company data, the original soundtrack, which featured Primal 
Scream, Brian Eno, New Order and Pulp, has sold 981,815 copies to date.

The T2 soundtrack will be released on 27 January via Polydor.
