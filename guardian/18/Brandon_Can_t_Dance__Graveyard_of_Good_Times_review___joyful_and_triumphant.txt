Philadelphia native Brandon Ayres, AKA Brandon Can’t Dance 
<https://brandoncantdancenewbandcamp.bandcamp.com>, rattles through styles and 
influences so readily that on first listen this ramshackle, self-produced 
collection feels like an arch experiment in mimicry. So Deep, So Tortured, So 
Freak’s Marilyn Manson-isms are gloriously OTT, while A Greyhound Named Chelsea 
expertly apes Elliott Smith-esque singer-songwriter woes, rhyming the title 
with “chalice of ecstasy” in a tongue-in-cheek list of basic needs. Obligatory 
Star Surfing Song, meanwhile, is a Smashing Pumpkins song in all but name. 
Never overstaying its welcome despite its 16-track length, there are little 
pockets of unadulterated joy peppered throughout, specifically the buzz 
guitar-laced opener Headspace, and She Loves Anime’s electro-tinged tale of a 
boy who draws himself the perfect girlfriend.
