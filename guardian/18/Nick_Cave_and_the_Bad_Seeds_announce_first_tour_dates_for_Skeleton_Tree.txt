The album, which debuted at #1 on the Aria charts in Australia, was given a 
five-star review

 by the Guardian when it was released last month, and described as “a 
masterpiece of love and devastation”.

Skeleton Tree was released alongside a documentary by New Zealand-born 
director Andrew Dominik, One More Time With Feeling. The film covers the 
Australian musician’s trauma and grief after his 15-year-old son Arthur fell 
from a cliff in Brighton to his death, in July 2015, while Cave was recording 
the album, which is the band’s 16th.

“What happens when an event occurs that is so catastrophic you just change,” 
Cave said in the film. “You change from the known person, to an unknown person. 
So that when you look at yourself in the mirror, do you recognise the person 
that you were but the person inside the skin is a different person.”

At a Venice film festival screening, Dominik explained 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/nick-cave-documentary-one-more-time-with-feeling-andrew-dominik-venice-film-festival>
 that the documentary came about because Cave needed a way to promote the album 
which didn’t involve speaking to the press about his son.

“Arthur had died halfway through making [the album],” he said. “And the idea 
of [promoting] it made him feel sick, because he was going to have to discuss 
the context of the record with a whole bunch of journalists. That prospect was 
very alarming to him.

“His instinct in making the film was one of self-preservation: it was a way to 
talk about what happened, but there was a certain safety in doing it with 
someone he knew.”

The film also tracks the creative and personal relationship between Cave and 
his long-time songwriting partner, Warren Ellis, who will join the tour 
alongside Bad Seeds members Martyn Casey, Thomas Wydler, Jim Sclavunos, Conway 
Savage, George Vjestica and Larry Mullins.


Opening in Hobart, Tasmania, on 13 January, the tour’s first mainland 
Australia show will be outdoors at the North Gardens in Ballarat, Victoria, 
supported by the experimental trio the Necks. The Necks will also join the 
shows in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. Tour dates outside Australia have not 
yet been announced.
