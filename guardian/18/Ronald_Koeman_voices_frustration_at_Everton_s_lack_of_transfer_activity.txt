Ronald Koeman <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ronald-koeman> said 
Everton must use the remainder of the season to consolidate seventh place in 
the Premier League and implement the improvements needed to match the club’s 
stated ambitions.

Everton’s last chance of tangible success from Koeman’s first season in 
charge, and hopes of ending a 22-year wait for a trophy, ended on Saturday with
defeat at home to Leicester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/07/everton-leicester-city-fa-cup-match-report>
 in the third round of the FA Cup.

The Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> manager made no 
attempt afterwards to hide his frustration at what he perceives as a lack of 
transfer activity from the club’s hierarchy, insisting everyone needed to “open 
their eyes” to what is required.

His comments were the first sign of strain in his relationship with the 
Everton board and possibly the director of football, Steve Walsh, who so far 
this month hasbrought the 19-year-old Ademola Lookman

 to Goodison Park from Charlton Athletic in a deal which may rise to £11m. But, 
despite their prospects of landing a trophy ending and sitting seventh in the 
table, nine points behind Manchester United in sixth, the manager claimed 
Everton’s season is not over.

“For the rest of the season it’s easy,” he said. “We have to try to keep this 
position in the table because there is a big difference between the first six 
and the rest of the teams. That’s already difficult, we know, so for the rest 
of the season the aim is to improve and change the team. That’s not done by one 
week, one night, two months. We know it and need to accept it – and how 
difficult it is to accept.”

Koeman also claimed the paucity of Everton’s squad was exposed by Tom Davies’ 
impressive performance in central midfield, the homegrown 18-year-old talent 
one of the few players spared criticism for the defeat.

He added: “That was not my comment just because I am frustrated or 
disappointed by the result. Even if we had won 1-0 I would have had the same 
feeling. That’s no different because of the result. It’s why we need to change.”

Asked whether he expected deals for the United pair of Morgan Schneiderlin

 or Memphis Depay, the latter of whom could replace Yannick Bolasie, to be 
concluded before Manchester City visit Goodison in the Premier League next 
Sunday, Koeman replied: “Everyone inside here knows my opinion and they know 
the opinion of Steve Walsh, so we will see.”
