Coastal flood warnings and the precautionary evacuation of an Essex village 
indicate the weather will continue to cause havoc across Britain. If you’ve 
been affected we’d like to hear from you.


Though we’d like to hear from you, your safety and security is most important. 
When responding to this assignment, please make sure you put your safety and 
the safety of others first. Extreme weather events can be very unpredictable 
and carry very real risks.
