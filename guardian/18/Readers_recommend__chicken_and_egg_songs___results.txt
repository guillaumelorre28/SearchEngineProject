 Since last Thursday evening I’ve been pondering the dilemma set by Peter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/apr/02/readers-recommend-chicken-and-egg-songs>
 that has been puzzled over philosophers from Aristotle to Macrobius. It was 
aptly put to words and music byKoko Taylor: What Came First the Egg or the Hen?

That raises a similar question: which came first, the lyrics or the music? The 
answer to that can be found inBack at the Chicken Shack, a jazz tune from Jimmy 
Smith. No lyrics, but the awesome Hammond organ that Smith was famous for and 
some mighty fine sax to boot. Perhaps he can help us find an egg or two?

My Easter egg hunt took meto ancient Greece and I discovered that mythology 
had it wrong; it wasn’t a box that was used to lock up the world’s evils, but
Pandora’s Egg.

So if Greek mythology was wrong perhaps all those songs about Affect and Cause
[sic] were too, certainly theWhite Stripes’s Jack White thinks you can’t blame 
the effect and make it the cause.

There were so many good tunes nominated this week and some more powerfully 
articulated than others. Our resident Deadhead was particularly prolific and 
nominated a song that fittingly demonstrates the saying “the horns of the 
dilemma” in theVictim or the Crime.

There were many nominations this week that demonstrated paradox, with several 
references to Lewis Carroll’s Alice Through the Looking Glass:

Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you’d generally 
get to somewhere else – if you run very fast for a long time, as we’ve been 
doing.”

 “A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now, here, you see, it takes all 
the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere 
else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”

 I tried keeping up with the nominations but there were so many paradoxes: 
“You got to cry without weeping, talk without speaking, scream without raising 
your voice.” So at times it seemed that I was like the Red Queen,Running to 
Stand Still trying to listen to them all.

As depicted in Iron Maiden’s Educated Fool, I began not really knowing how 
this topic was supposed to pan out.

 Despite a well-written rubric and introduction from Peter, effectively I 
Started Out With Nothin’, and technically have most of it left, including many 
good memories and aSeasick Steve tune that was new to me. By now I felt I had 
something, and there was a new balance withBeck: Guess, I’m Doing Fine.

The Riddle Song was a revisited nomination, this time by Megson, instead of 
Joan Baez. It contains several paradoxes and the answer to this one: how can 
there be a chicken that has no bone? When it’s piping! So I found out that 
“piping” is when a young bird cracks the shell of the egg when hatching, when 
its bones have not fully formed.

 Catch-22 or exhibit E in Amanda Palmer’s The Bed Song? Over the years a 
couple have grown apart, saying: “All the money in the world won’t buy a bed so 
big and wide to guarantee that you won’t accidentally touch me in the night.” 
Only in death, when lying side by side in the graveyard does one of them reach 
out to the other and say: “I would have told you … If only you’d asked me.”

 The finality of death comes to us all, but the famous live on, according to A 
House’s Endless Art (“All dead, yet still alive”), and for some – in keeping 
with the significance of the weekend that inspired this playlist – the circle 
is complete with theResurrection (Shuffle).
