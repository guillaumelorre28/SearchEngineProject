Rolls-Royce <https://www.theguardian.com/business/rollsroycegroup> has 
unveiled its first driverless vehicle, a concept car that promises to help its 
owner announce their importance to the world.

The Vision Next 100 is an autonomous vehicle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/self-driving-cars> aimed at “the most 
discerning and powerful patrons in the world”. It has no steering wheel and a 
silk “throne” from which its occupants can watch the world go by.

Rolls-Royce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/11/rolls-royce-motor-cars-ends-five-years-growth-after-china-sales-slump>
 said the zero-emission model, codenamed 103EX, showed the company “rejects the 
notion of anonymous, utilitarian and bland future modes of mobility”.

In a statement that was short on technical specifications but packed with 
florid description, Rolls-Royce promised an interior made only of “the most 
precious and contemporary elegance”.

The owner will be “encircled by the most modern handcrafted fine-line Macassar 
wood panelling” as they gaze at a “generous” high-definition television screen.

Their comfort will be ensured not by an ordinary car seat, but by a 
“beautifully textured, ivory-coloured luxurious throne upon which our 
passengers are conveyed, and from which they command”.

Their feet will be cushioned by “the finest one-off deep-pile ivory wool 
carpet”, while anyone worried about leg room will be satisfied thanks to extra 
space afforded by “the removal of the chauffeur”.

Instead of a driver, passengers can give orders to a virtual assistant named 
Eleanor – after the actor Eleanor Thornton, who is rumoured to have inspired 
the car’s Spirit of Ecstasy bonnet ornament.

Eleanor will act as a concierge “imbued with her own artificial intelligence” 
and capable of reminding the owner not to miss meetings and even bringing the 
car around to the front of their house at the start of a journey.

Rolls-Royce, owned by BMW <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bmw>, said the 
car proved that “certain truths are constant over time”, such as the notion 
that “the powerful have always understood the symbols through which they 
express their standing”.

“The very size of the Rolls-Royce Vision Next 100 announces the importance of 
its precious cargo,” the carmaker explained, pointing to its vast dimensions – 
5.9 metres long and 1.6 metres high.

The glass roof is a “canopy over the occupants that provides privacy while 
allowing them to contemplate the majesty of the stars in the firmament above as 
they glide through the night”.

The space usually reserved for the Rolls’ 12-cylinder engine will give way to 
a luggage compartment that opens automatically on arrival to present two 
personalised Grand Tourer cases.

And if the grandeur of the journey inside a vehicle that gives “the impression 
of a futuristic catamaran” was not enough, the car has something special in 
store on arrival at the passengers’ destination.

“As the Rolls-Royce Vision Next 100 gracefully comes to a halt, something 
magnificent occurs,” the company said. The glass roof rises to allow the 
occupant to stand, while a step emerges from below the running board and a red 
light is projected, “carpet-like” to announce their arrival.

“Thus, as in Botticelli’s ‘Birth of Venus’, our guest is framed and ready to 
step gracefully into the limelight and greet their audience … This is 
automotive haute couture,” the company added.

Amid the fanfare accompanying its unveiling, Rolls-Royce did not say how the 
vehicle, due to hit the streets in the 2040s, would be powered or how it would 
cope with speed bumps.

And despite the grand language, the concept car met with a mixed response, 
with technology website Slash Gear describing the vehicle as “sublimely crazy”.

Other car fans were even less sympathetic.

A number of companies are working on driverless cars, including Google. Its 
two-seater looks like a cross between a Smart Car and a Nissan Micra, has no 
steering wheel, accelerator or brakes, and just two physical controls: “stop” 
and “go”.

Nissan, Toyota, Audi and the ride-hailing service Uber are among those also 
working on a self-driving technology. Volvo intends to test them on London 
roads next year.

The Vision Next 100 – the brainchild of Giles Taylor, Rolls-Royce’s director 
of design – was unveiled at the Roundhouse arts venue in north London on 
Thursday.

“It is an expression of our intrinsic understanding of the possibilities for a 
true luxury brand and the desires of its customers,” Taylor said.
