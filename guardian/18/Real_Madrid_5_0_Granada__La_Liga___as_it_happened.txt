Full time: Real Madrid 5-0 Granada

The referee calls a halt, and Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> move six points ahead of 
Barcelona, who face a tricky trip to Villarreal tomorrow. This wasn’t quite the 
humiliation it threatened to be when Real went four goals up after 31 minutes, 
but was still entirely straightforward.

Isco scored twice, while Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Casemiro added 
gloss to the final score. Their unbeaten run now extends to 39 games, and they 
will set a new Spanish record if they avoid defeat against Sevilla in their 
second-leg Cup tie next week. Sevilla will offer more of a test than they got 
today. Thanks for joining me.Adios.

49 mins: Isco has a chance at a hat-trick, rising to meet Carvajal’s cross but 
heading it a long way wide. He’s now going off, replaced by Marco Asensio.

48 mins: Another Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
change is coming up, with Isco still looking uncomfortable. Real have two trips 
to Jorge Sampaoli’s high-octane Sevilla coming up, so they’ll want him fit.

46 mins: Carvajal feeds Benzema, in space centrally, who fires an effort that 
Ochoa does well to turn away. A match-up of the 2014 World Cup’s two finest 
goalkeepers out here, with Ochoa certainly the busier of the two.

Peep!

James Rodríguez is on, in place of Toni Kroos rather than Isco, who had looked 
to be injured in the first half.

Half time: Real Madrid 4-0 Granada

One way traffic here, with Isco scoring twice and Karim Benzema and Cristiano 
Ronaldo also on the scoresheet. That unbeaten record will extend to 39 games; 
it’s very much a case of how many. Back in a bit.

45 mins: Isco, feeling the effects of that challenge, sets up Ronaldo, whose 
speculator from distance is skewed wide. And that’s half time.

The referee calls a halt, and Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> move six points ahead of 
Barcelona, who face a tricky trip to Villarreal tomorrow. This wasn’t quite the 
humiliation it threatened to be when Real went four goals up after 31 minutes, 
but was still entirely straightforward.

Isco scored twice, while Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Casemiro added 
gloss to the final score. Their unbeaten run now extends to 39 games, and they 
will set a new Spanish record if they avoid defeat against Sevilla in their 
second-leg Cup tie next week. Sevilla will offer more of a test than they got 
today. Thanks for joining me.Adios.

90 mins: A late chance for Granada, as Kravets spins and shoots in space 
inside the area – but Navas saves smartly to seal the clean sheet.
 
89 mins: Granada give the ball away in midfield and Ronaldo motors forward, 
before slipping the ball to Rodriguez. His cross towards Benzema is cut out, 
and the striker is offside.
 
87 mins: Modric wins the ball in his own area and gallops upfield, working the 
ball to Ronaldo who stings Ochoa’s palms with a piledriver from the right-hand 
side of the area.
 
85 mins: Benzema prods a weary pass to a Granada player, and the visitors 
break, with Navas racing 30 yards off his line to clear from Kravets. It’s been 
a second-gear second half fromReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>.
 
83 mins: Benzema shuttles out to the left, and plays a beautifully weighted 
pass to Ronaldo – but his cross, towards Asensio in the middle, is nodded away.
 
81 mins: First Ronaldo from the right, and then Rodriguez from the left, try 
to pick out Benzema with a lofted ball, but Granada battle to clear the ball 
away.
 
80 mins: Keylor Navas has to extend himself to punch clear Pereira’s testing 
cross. Bad news for theReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> kit man, who will now have to 
wash Navas’ shirt.
 
79 mins: Ronaldo, still admirably impatient despite the scoreline, takes a 
quick throw-in, then throws his head back as a return pass is cut out.
 
78 mins: Ezequiel Ponce is an excellent name.
 
77 mins: One more change for Granada, with Ezequiel Ponce replacing Franck 
Tabanou. No surprise that he’s another loanee – from Roma, this time.
 
76 mins: Asensio splits the defence with a through ball to Ronaldo, who is 
just offside. At the other end, Gabriel delivers an undercooked cross as 
Granada search for a consolation.
 
75 mins: Granada have a shot! Kravets was offside, and knew it, when he took 
it, but still.
 
74 mins: Ronaldo miscues a header from the free kick, as Real Madrid’s shot 
count rises to 21, to Granada’s zero.
 
72 mins: Casemiro needlessly upends Javi Marquez, earning a booking in the 
process. Moments later, Tabanou joins him in the book after a reckless lunge on 
Carvajal.
 
71 mins: Ronaldo lines the wall up and stands over the ball – but Rodriguez 
races in from the left and curls it just over the bar.
 
70 mins: Gabriel Silva is booked for handball, committed 25 yards out, just 
right of goal, i.e. prime Ronaldo territory.
 
68 mins: Fabio Coentrão is on, in place of the excellent Marcelo. The crowd 
are doing a chant to the tune of ‘Rivers of Babylon’. The Bernabéu vibe: 
relaxed.
 
67 mins: Granada win a free kick which skids across the penalty area and out 
to Ruben Vezo on the right, whose return ball sails over Navas’ crossbar. 
Alberto Bueno has come on for Granada, replacing Boga.
 
64 mins: Marcelo lines up a volley but thuds it into the ground towards 
Benzema, whose shot is well saved by Ochoa. The flag is up already. Granada’s 
goalie has been their best player, which brings this classic to mind:
 
63 mins: Ronaldo is forced wide by Ruben Vezo, and sends a shot clattering 
into the advertising boards, before tumbling over and appealing for a penalty. 
The referee isn’t interested.
 
61 mins: Javi Marquez, who has just come on for Agbo Uche, finds Tabanou with 
a raking diagonal pass. Tabanou gives Carvajal something to think about, 
jostling with the full back and forcing him to prod back to Navas.
 
Casemiro becomes Real Madrid’s 21st goalscorer of the season, arriving at the 
far post to turn in Rodriguez’s free kick from the right.
 Benzema and Ronaldo watch Casemiro score the fifth from close range.

56 mins: Agbo is booked for raising an arm to Casemiro’s face in a midfield 
challenge.
 
55 mins: Nacho gets forward again in the five-a-side style, and his one-two 
with Benzema is cut out by Gabriel Silva, one of few Granada players emerging 
from this with any credit.
 
54 mins: Ronaldo attempts to set Modric free with a toe-poked ball that’s 
badly overhit. Ronaldo then admonishes Modric for failing to run through two 
Granada players to retrieve it.
 
52 mins: Benzema can’t control the ball as it bobbles around in the box and 
Granada clear, butReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
are charging forward soon enough, Benzema getting another chance but slicing 
high and wide.
 
50 mins: Agbo Uche hauls Rodriguez down, but the referee plays advantage, and 
it’s worked to Carvajal on the right, whose cross is turned behind for a corner.
 
49 mins: Isco has a chance at a hat-trick, rising to meet Carvajal’s cross but 
heading it a long way wide. He’s now going off, replaced by Marco Asensio.
 
48 mins: Another Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
change is coming up, with Isco still looking uncomfortable. Real have two trips 
to Jorge Sampaoli’s high-octane Sevilla coming up, so they’ll want him fit.
 
46 mins: Carvajal feeds Benzema, in space centrally, who fires an effort that 
Ochoa does well to turn away. A match-up of the 2014 World Cup’s two finest 
goalkeepers out here, with Ochoa certainly the busier of the two.
 
James Rodríguez is on, in place of Toni Kroos rather than Isco, who had looked 
to be injured in the first half.
 
I’ve just been perusing the La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> table, and note that 
Valencia are 17th, three points above Granada. No disrespect and all, but what 
the hell are they playing at?

One way traffic here, with Isco scoring twice and Karim Benzema and Cristiano 
Ronaldo also on the scoresheet. That unbeaten record will extend to 39 games; 
it’s very much a case of how many. Back in a bit.
 
45 mins: Isco, feeling the effects of that challenge, sets up Ronaldo, whose 
speculator from distance is skewed wide. And that’s half time.
 
44 mins: Samper, on loan from Barcelona – there are nine loanees in this 
Granada team – gets a booking for a late clip on Isco.
 
42 mins: Modric and Benzema combine neatly on the edge of the area, before 
Modric’s prodded effort is saved by Ochoa, low to his right.
 
41 mins: Marcelo wins a corner that’s headed away by Ruben Vezo, and Granada 
work the ball upfield. A neat pass from Sergi Samper sets Gabriel clear on the 
left, but his cross is gathered by Navas.
 
39 mins: Benzema prods a diagonal pass towards Ronaldo, who is brought down in 
stages. Kroos lines up the free kick, way out wide on the left, but it’s nodded 
away from danger.
