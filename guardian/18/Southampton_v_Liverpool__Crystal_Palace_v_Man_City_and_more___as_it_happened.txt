GOAL! Sunderland 3-0 Hull City

Premier League: Jermain Defoe tees up Victor Anichebe to score his second of 
the game and give Sunderland a three-goal cushion at the Stadium of Light. 
There’s probably 10 minutes to play there after a floodlight failure early in 
the second half, but Sunderland look good for all three points.

against Palace again. Kevin De Bruyne sent in a corner, which the Ivorian fired 
home.

GOAL! Crystal Palace 1-1 Manchester City

Premier League: Crystal Palace striker Connor Wickham scores his second goal 
in as many games to level terms for the home side at Selhurst Park. City 
goalkeeper Claudio Bravo got a hand to his rasping left-footed drive but was 
unable to keep the ball out.

Roberto Firmino misses a sitter ...

Premier League: Liverpool have missed three great chances against Southampton 
in a match you’d have staked your house on producing goals today. Roberto 
Firmino is the latest player to stand with his head in his hands after poking 
wide when scoring looked easier.

The Stadium of Light goes dark

Premier League: In inappropriately named stadium news, there’s been a 
floodlight failure at the Stadium of Light, where Sunderland fans are 
attempting to illuminate the pitch with lights from their mobile phones. It’s 
not gone completely dark, but referee Lee Mason looks ready to take the players 
off the pitch. Play is expected to resume in 10 minutes or so, once somebody 
puts 50p in the meter. Sunderland lead Hull City 1-0.
