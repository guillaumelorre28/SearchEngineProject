We are delighted to see the that committee stage of the cultural property 
(armed conflict) bill takes place on 15 November in the House of Commons after 
its all-party-supported, steady progress through the House of Lords. This 
legislation will enable the UK to ratify the 1954 Hague convention on the 
protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict and its two 
protocols, making the UK the only member of the UN’s permanent five to have 
ratified all parts of the convention and one of the leading international 
players regarding the protection of cultural property during war.

However, we have the opportunity to become the leading international player. 
The UK government currently faces a similar opportunity to that confronted by 
the Swiss in the 1860s: to help an embryonic international organisation become 
established. The International Blue Shield, frequently referred to as the 
“cultural equivalent of the Red Cross”, was set up by the international 
community in 1996 – but without funding. Through the UK’s newly created 
cultural protection fund (CPF) we could, and must, support a small Blue Shield 
team in London to not only help its 25 existing voluntary national committees 
and the plethora of diverse activity currently taking place regarding the 
protection of the cultural heritage of the Middle East, but to act as a centre 
of excellence and support for those trying to protect heritage during conflict 
anywhere in the world.

The CPF provides the means by which we can grasp this opportunity; we urge the 
government to seize it.
