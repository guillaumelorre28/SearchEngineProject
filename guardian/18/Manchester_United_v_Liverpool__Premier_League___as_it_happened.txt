Both teams will probably feel disappointed after this match, Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> because an incoherent 
performance prevented them from underlining their recent improvement under Jose 
Mourinho with a win over one of their rivals, Liverpool because failing to hold 
on means they have lost further ground on Chelsea in the title race.James 
Milner’s early penalty was cancelled out by Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s late equaliser 
and neither side really did enough to win it. If the top four is the target, 
however, a draw arguably suits Liverpool more, even though they and Tottenham 
are seven points behind Chelsea. Without several key players, a point moves 
them three clear of Manchester City in fifth place and five clear of United in 
sixth. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.

90 min+2: Liverpool cleverly work the ball to Firmino on the edge of the area, 
Coutinho creating the opening, and the Brazilian shuffles it on to the left for 
the unmarked Wijnaldum. Is this to be the winner? No. He shoots tamely at De 
Gea.

90 min: Fooled by Firmino in the middle, Herrera Mourinhos the counterattack 
by tugging the Brazilian’s shirt. Firmino responds by foolishly pushing Herrera 
in the chest. The Spaniard holds his face. But of course. They’re both booked. 
There will be four minutes of added time. Either side could win this.

87 min: At least the cross that led to Fellaini’s header didn’t come from a 
player who could have been sent off, so we shouldn’t hear too much about the 
officials in the press conferences. Hooray!

vulnerable in the air. Mourinho will be delighted with how that substitution 
turned out and it’s more evidence of United’s growing never say die spirit.

GOAL! Manchester United 1-1 Liverpool (Ibrahimovic, 84 min)

Antonio Valencia, who might be a shade offside, lifts a cross into the 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> area from the right. 
It falls to Rooney on the left and this time he manages to squeeze a cross 
towards the near post, where Marouane Fellaini’s presence causes the havoc that 
Jose Mourinho was anticipating when he threw him on. Fellaini’s clever header, 
the ball brushing off his curly hair, drifts over the surprised Mignolet, but 
hits the bottom of the far post. No matter, though, because Valencia hoicks it 
back to Ibrahimovic, who brilliantly manages to steer his header over Mignolet, 
off the underside of the bar and over the line!

but the flag’s up for offside as soon as Ibrahimovic’s header reaches him. He 
was being played on by Alexander-Arnold.

73 min: Milner limped off for a while, but he seems to have recovered 
sufficiently to continue. That was such a poor challenge from Rooney, who could 
have broken Milner’s ankle by stamping down on it.

70 min: James Milner is down and in need of medical attention after Wayne 
Rooney went into a 50-50 challenge with boot high, stamping his studs into the
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> full-back’s shin. 
Rooney is extremely fortunate to escape without a card. Imagine if Mike Dean 
was reffing this game!

66 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are 
beginning to enjoy decent spells of possession in United’s half again, with 
Coutinho pulling a few strings and the tension rising amongst the home 
supporters. As United’s anxiety grows, a spot of pinball in their area leads to 
a half chance for Lallana, who spins and shoots too near De Gea, who saves down 
to his right.

65 min: Rooney receives the ball on the edge of the area, shifts it to work a 
shooting opportunity and dribbles one well wide of the right post. That’s the 
cue for Juan Mata to replace Anthony Martial.

63 min: The introduction of Coutinho has given Liverpool an almighty boost. 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> counter again and he 
pops up unmarked on the left once more. He looks to curl one into the top 
corner with his right foot, but his shot takes a deflection and De Gea prevents 
a corner.

61 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> bring on 
Philippe Coutinho for Divock Origi. The Brazilian makes an instant impact after 
finding space on the left, dribbling inside, teasing United, prising them open 
with a gloriously disguised reverse pass to Firmino, who opens up his body and 
aims for the far corner. De Gea pushes his shot away.

57 min: Rooney has injected some urgency into United’s attack since his 
introduction and now he barrels down the right, but his cross from the byline 
is straight at Mignolet.

55 min: United should be level. Alexander-Arnold plays himself into trouble, 
allowing Martial to rob him on the halfway line and start a United 
counterattack. Mkhitaryan’s in acres of space on the right and they find him. 
His touch is heavy, though, enabling Mignolet to close him down and although 
Mkhitaryan prods it round theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goalkeeper, the shot’s rushed, 
off target and struck too sharply for Martial or Rooney to tap into an empty 
net.

52 min: “Pogba’s hair reminds me of when I was 10 and decided to emulate 
Taribo West’s distinctive look by sticking pieces of green chewing gum 
throughout my hair,” says Conal Huetter. “I just hope Pogba’s mother is equally 
aghast as mine was.”

51 min: Rooney receives the ball with his back to goal on the left, before 
turning and driving a cross into the middle. It’s a good idea and a dangerous 
ball, but Milner boots it clear.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are under pressure, though, 
and Origi gives away a free-kick for pushing Valencia on the right. They 
survive, though.

48 min: Liverpool have been positive since the restart and they break 
menacingly here, Firmino finding Origi on the left. He cuts inside and lets rip 
with his right foot, only for a deflection off Jones to take his fierce drive a 
few yards wide.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have 
a corner. Will Pogba, who struggled so much in the first half, be marking 
Lovren?

46 min: Off we go again, Manchester United getting the second half underway. 
The next 45 minutes could define the rest of the season for both sides. 
Recognising that,Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have made a signifcant 
change. Wayne Rooney, one short of breaking Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring 
record, is on for Michael Carrick. I smell a narrative.

Half-time: Manchester United 0-1 Liverpool

A flawed but engrossing first half draws to a close and Liverpool lead thanks 
to James Milner’s penalty, awarded thanks to a monumentally stupid handball by 
Paul Pogba. This isn’t over, though.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have had chances and 
they may well take one if they continue to open Liverpool up.

45 min+1: Alexander-Arnold impetuously sells himself and needlessly goes to 
ground as he tries to intercept a pass, allowing Martial to skip past him, but 
Lovren spares his young defensive colleague by intercepting the United winger’s 
attempted through ball to Pogba.

43 min: A free-kick to Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> on the left. Milner lifts it 
high to the far post and again Lovren unsettles United, pulling away and 
cushioning a volley into the middle. United unconvincingly get it behind at the 
expense of a corner. Milner whips it in again but Michael Oliver awards a 
free-kick to United for pushing this time.

41 min: Klavan decides to step up as Mkhitaryan races clean through on goal, 
Liverpool’s offside trap malfunctioning badly, but the Armenian’s effort is too 
close to Mignolet, who makes a comfortable enough save. No United player is on 
hand to tap in the rebound and Klavan mops up.

39 min: Origi bustles past a nervy Rojo, who was the last man, and tries to 
run clear for a confrontation with De Gea. Rojo being Rojo, he looks extremely 
tempted to bring Origi down with a clumsy foul. As it turns out, though, he 
does enough to hold Origi up with by getting as close to him as possible 
without conceding a foul. Origi holds it up and waits for support, but Can and 
Lallana can’t get shots away and United survive.

37 min: Pogba is in the horrible position of trying too hard to rectify his 
mistake now. He’s overelaborating every time he gets the ball and keeps losing 
it.

36 min: Another corner, this time to United on the right. Mkhitaryan’s cross 
comes to nothing, though. “Not sure what Pogba was doing there,” says JR in 
Illinois. “Also not sure what he’s doing with his hairdo. Why a yellow stripe? 
Is he trying to colour-coordinate with Liverpool’s strip? Seems an odd choice.”

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. Pogba might be advised to 
stay well away from United’s area this time. He’s in the mix again, though. 
Luckily for United, Milner’s corner is too close to De Gea.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic strikes late for Manchester United in draw with Liverpool
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/15/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report> 
Both teams will probably feel disappointed after this match, Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> because an incoherent 
performance prevented them from underlining their recent improvement under Jose 
Mourinho with a win over one of their rivals, Liverpool because failing to hold 
on means they have lost further ground on Chelsea in the title race.James 
Milner’s early penalty was cancelled out by Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s late equaliser 
and neither side really did enough to win it. If the top four is the target, 
however, a draw arguably suits Liverpool more, even though they and Tottenham 
are seven points behind Chelsea. Without several key players, a point moves 
them three clear of Manchester City in fifth place and five clear of United in 
sixth. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.
 
That’s your lot!

Hewitt/Getty Images  
90 min+2: Liverpool cleverly work the ball to Firmino on the edge of the area, 
Coutinho creating the opening, and the Brazilian shuffles it on to the left for 
the unmarked Wijnaldum. Is this to be the winner? No. He shoots tamely at De 
Gea.
 
90 min: Fooled by Firmino in the middle, Herrera Mourinhos the counterattack 
by tugging the Brazilian’s shirt. Firmino responds by foolishly pushing Herrera 
in the chest. The Spaniard holds his face. But of course. They’re both booked. 
There will be four minutes of added time. Either side could win this.
 
89 min: The anticipated onslaught from Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> is yet to quite 
materialise. Liverpool have responded well to the equaliser.
 
87 min: At least the cross that led to Fellaini’s header didn’t come from a 
player who could have been sent off, so we shouldn’t hear too much about the 
officials in the press conferences. Hooray!
 
86 min: It hadn’t exactly been coming from Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>, but Liverpool haven’t 
quite been able to kill this game off and you always sensed they might be 
vulnerable in the air. Mourinho will be delighted with how that substitution 
turned out and it’s more evidence of United’s growing never say die spirit.
 
Antonio Valencia, who might be a shade offside, lifts a cross into the 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> area from the right. 
It falls to Rooney on the left and this time he manages to squeeze a cross 
towards the near post, where Marouane Fellaini’s presence causes the havoc that 
Jose Mourinho was anticipating when he threw him on. Fellaini’s clever header, 
the ball brushing off his curly hair, drifts over the surprised Mignolet, but 
hits the bottom of the far post. No matter, though, because Valencia hoicks it 
back to Ibrahimovic, who brilliantly manages to steer his header over Mignolet, 
off the underside of the bar and over the line!

83 min: Klavan pulls out of a challenge with Fellaini in the middle of 
United’s half, drawing a furious reaction from Klopp, but Rooney can’t force 
his way past Alexander-Arnold on the left.
 
82 min: Rooney forces Mignolet to make a stunning save with a fierce volley, 
but the flag’s up for offside as soon as Ibrahimovic’s header reaches him. He 
was being played on by Alexander-Arnold.
 
80 min: Samuele Allardici would approve of Jose Mourinho’s long-ball tactics 
here.
 
78 min: Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have started to toss 
high ball’s from deep positions into Liverpool’s area now.
 
76 min: Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> make their final 
change, Marouane Fellaini on for Matteo Darmian. Liverpool will be steeling 
themselves for an aerial bombardment, although it will probably please them 
that Marcus Rashford won’t be appearing today.
 
75 min: A lame attempt at a backheel from Pogba concedes possession on the 
left and prompts a rapidLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> break. Can whips a fine cross 
to the far post, the ball drifting over Jones, and Wijnaldum nuts a fine chance 
over the bar.
 
73 min: Milner limped off for a while, but he seems to have recovered 
sufficiently to continue. That was such a poor challenge from Rooney, who could 
have broken Milner’s ankle by stamping down on it.
 
70 min: James Milner is down and in need of medical attention after Wayne 
Rooney went into a 50-50 challenge with boot high, stamping his studs into the
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> full-back’s shin. 
Rooney is extremely fortunate to escape without a card. Imagine if Mike Dean 
was reffing this game!

66 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are 
beginning to enjoy decent spells of possession in United’s half again, with 
Coutinho pulling a few strings and the tension rising amongst the home 
supporters. As United’s anxiety grows, a spot of pinball in their area leads to 
a half chance for Lallana, who spins and shoots too near De Gea, who saves down 
to his right.
 
65 min: Rooney receives the ball on the edge of the area, shifts it to work a 
shooting opportunity and dribbles one well wide of the right post. That’s the 
cue for Juan Mata to replace Anthony Martial.
 
63 min: The introduction of Coutinho has given Liverpool an almighty boost. 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> counter again and he 
pops up unmarked on the left once more. He looks to curl one into the top 
corner with his right foot, but his shot takes a deflection and De Gea prevents 
a corner.
 
61 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> bring on 
Philippe Coutinho for Divock Origi. The Brazilian makes an instant impact after 
finding space on the left, dribbling inside, teasing United, prising them open 
with a gloriously disguised reverse pass to Firmino, who opens up his body and 
aims for the far corner. De Gea pushes his shot away.

60 min: Pogba’s effort from 25 yards flies miles wide. Juan Mata is getting 
ready to come on.
 
59 min: United have increased the intensity of their play and have pinned 
Liverpool back.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
haven’t been out of their half for a while.
 
57 min: Rooney has injected some urgency into United’s attack since his 
introduction and now he barrels down the right, but his cross from the byline 
is straight at Mignolet.
 
55 min: United should be level. Alexander-Arnold plays himself into trouble, 
allowing Martial to rob him on the halfway line and start a United 
counterattack. Mkhitaryan’s in acres of space on the right and they find him. 
His touch is heavy, though, enabling Mignolet to close him down and although 
Mkhitaryan prods it round theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goalkeeper, the shot’s rushed, 
off target and struck too sharply for Martial or Rooney to tap into an empty 
net.
 
52 min: “Pogba’s hair reminds me of when I was 10 and decided to emulate 
Taribo West’s distinctive look by sticking pieces of green chewing gum 
throughout my hair,” says Conal Huetter. “I just hope Pogba’s mother is equally 
aghast as mine was.”
 
51 min: Rooney receives the ball with his back to goal on the left, before 
turning and driving a cross into the middle. It’s a good idea and a dangerous 
ball, but Milner boots it clear.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are under pressure, though, 
and Origi gives away a free-kick for pushing Valencia on the right. They 
survive, though.
 
49 min: Lovren is still Pogba’s man, but the United midfielder wins this duel. 
He heads it away from danger and United end up with a free-kick after a foul by 
Can.
 
48 min: Liverpool have been positive since the restart and they break 
menacingly here, Firmino finding Origi on the left. He cuts inside and lets rip 
with his right foot, only for a deflection off Jones to take his fierce drive a 
few yards wide.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have 
a corner. Will Pogba, who struggled so much in the first half, be marking 
Lovren?

46 min: Off we go again, Manchester United getting the second half underway. 
The next 45 minutes could define the rest of the season for both sides. 
Recognising that,Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have made a signifcant 
change. Wayne Rooney, one short of breaking Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring 
record, is on for Michael Carrick. I smell a narrative.
 
A flawed but engrossing first half draws to a close and Liverpool lead thanks 
to James Milner’s penalty, awarded thanks to a monumentally stupid handball by 
Paul Pogba. This isn’t over, though.Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> have had chances and 
they may well take one if they continue to open Liverpool up.

45 min+1: Alexander-Arnold impetuously sells himself and needlessly goes to 
ground as he tries to intercept a pass, allowing Martial to skip past him, but 
Lovren spares his young defensive colleague by intercepting the United winger’s 
attempted through ball to Pogba.
 
45 min: There will be one minute of added time.
 
43 min: A free-kick to Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> on the left. Milner lifts it 
high to the far post and again Lovren unsettles United, pulling away and 
cushioning a volley into the middle. United unconvincingly get it behind at the 
expense of a corner. Milner whips it in again but Michael Oliver awards a 
free-kick to United for pushing this time.
 
41 min: Klavan decides to step up as Mkhitaryan races clean through on goal, 
Liverpool’s offside trap malfunctioning badly, but the Armenian’s effort is too 
close to Mignolet, who makes a comfortable enough save. No United player is on 
hand to tap in the rebound and Klavan mops up.
 
39 min: Origi bustles past a nervy Rojo, who was the last man, and tries to 
run clear for a confrontation with De Gea. Rojo being Rojo, he looks extremely 
tempted to bring Origi down with a clumsy foul. As it turns out, though, he 
does enough to hold Origi up with by getting as close to him as possible 
without conceding a foul. Origi holds it up and waits for support, but Can and 
Lallana can’t get shots away and United survive.
 
37 min: Pogba is in the horrible position of trying too hard to rectify his 
mistake now. He’s overelaborating every time he gets the ball and keeps losing 
it.
 
36 min: Another corner, this time to United on the right. Mkhitaryan’s cross 
comes to nothing, though. “Not sure what Pogba was doing there,” says JR in 
Illinois. “Also not sure what he’s doing with his hairdo. Why a yellow stripe? 
Is he trying to colour-coordinate with Liverpool’s strip? Seems an odd choice.”
 
35 min: Origi goes on a foray down the left and wins a corner for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. Pogba might be advised to 
stay well away from United’s area this time. He’s in the mix again, though. 
Luckily for United, Milner’s corner is too close to De Gea.
 
33 min: Ibrahimovic lines up the free-kick and manages to hammer it low and 
hard past the wall, as expected, but Mignolet responds superbly, diving to his 
right to push the ball away for a corner. That’s an excellent save.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> need to calm down. They do so 
by dealing with the corner.

32 min: Mkhitaryan’s corner from the right’s headed away at the near post by 
Klavan but Herrera seizes on the loose ball in front of the dozy Origi, who 
brings him down on the edge of the area! That was so close to being a penalty, 
but this is still a magnificent opportunity forManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> to equalise. Zlatan 
Ibrahimovic will fancy his chances. The free-kick is 18 yards from goal and in 
a central position.
