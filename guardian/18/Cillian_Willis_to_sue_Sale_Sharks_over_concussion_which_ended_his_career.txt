Cillian Willis, who is a cousin of the Ireland legend Brian O’Driscoll, has 
accused two doctors at Sale of wrongfully handling and incorrectly treating two 
head injuries he sustained during an LV Cup tie against Saracens on 10 March 
2013, according tothe Irish Times

.

The scrum-half, who had previously played for Leinster, Connacht and Ulster, 
claims to have been concussed by a high tackle in the first half of the cup 
tie, when the Sale medical staff deemed him fit to play on. Willis suffered a 
second blow early in the second half but again was allowed to continue before 
he was eventually replaced after 47 minutes. The former Ireland Under-21 
international never played again.

The case, most likely to be held in Manchester, is not expected to be heard 
for at least 18 months. Three separate solicitors – for Sale and the two 
doctors – will contest the case taken by McHale and Co solicitors on Willis’s 
behalf, according to the Irish Times.

Dave Swanton, head of media at Sale Sharks, told the Guardian that the club 
would not comment on an ongoing legal matter.
