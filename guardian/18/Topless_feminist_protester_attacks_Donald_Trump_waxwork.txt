A topless activist from the feminist group Femen attacked a lifesize statue of 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> during an 
unveiling ceremony at a waxwork museum in Madrid.

The woman reportedly pushed past security ropes and placed her hand on the 
statue’s crotch while screaming “grab patriarchy by the balls”.

Museum staff spent several minutes trying to restrain the woman before 
eventually bundling her out through a back door.

The activist group claimed responsibility for the protest on Twitter, saying: 
“Femen just grabbed Trump’s statue by the balls in Madrid.”

In a recording leaked in October, Trump spoke of grabbing women “by the pussy”

Gonzalo Presa, head of communications at the museum, called the protest 
“unpleasant” and said he had hoped to give Trump a “special welcome” from 
Madrid.

“If they want to do this they should do it directly to him. This is too easy,” 
he said.

Artists had spent more than three days creating the wax figure, paying close 
attention to the colour and style of its hair, Presa said.

Femen <https://www.theguardian.com/world/femen>, an international group that 
began in Ukraine, is known for using nudity in protests over women’s rights.
