, regional rivals divided over a host of issues.

Demonstrators waved signs after Friday prayers depicting the Saudi King Salman 
holding a bloody sword, his head wrapped in an American flag and his shirt 
bearing a blue Star of David similar to that on the Israeli flag.

“Death to Al Saud and the traitors,” protesters in Tehran shouted. State media 
reported similar protests across the country.

“We don’t have any problems with the people of Saudi Arabia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia>. They are Sunnis and are our 
brothers,” the protester Habibullah Abulfazli said. “But the Al Saud family are 
puppets of Britain and America. They are fighting proxy wars against Shias and 
against all Muslims.”

Tensions soared in January after the kingdom executed a prominent Saudi Shia 
cleric 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/02/saudi-execution-of-shia-cleric-sparks-outrage-in-middle-east>
. Angry demonstrators later attacked two Saudi diplomatic posts in Iran and 
Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with the country. The two countries also 
support opposing sides in the civil wars in Syria andYemen

.

In their recent criticisms, Iranian officials have focused on the stampede and 
crush of pilgrims on 24 September last year that killed at least 2,426 people, 
according to an Associated Press count. Tehran has said the disaster killed 464 
Iranians.

The official Saudi toll of 769 people killed and 934 injured has not changed 
since 26 September. The kingdom has never addressed the discrepancy, nor has it 
released any results of an investigation authorities promised to conduct into 
the disaster.

On Monday, the Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei raised the stakes in the 
dispute by saying Saudi officials had “murdered” hajj pilgrims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/iran-accuses-saudi-arabia-of-murdering-pilgrims-during-hajj-stampede>
 who were injured in the stampede. Saudi’s grand mufti countered by claiming 
that Iranians were “not Muslims”.

Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran>
 have periodically simmered and cooled since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution 
installed its Shia cleric-ruled democracy. The hajj, which begins on Saturday 
this year, has not been spared.

In 1987, Iranian pilgrims fought Saudi riot police in clashes that killed at 
least 402 people. Iran said 600 of its pilgrims had been killed and police had 
fired machine guns at the crowd. Iran did not send pilgrims to the hajj in 1988 
and 1989, while Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties over the violence and 
Iranian attacks on shipping in the Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war.

Iran has called for an independent body to take over administering the 
five-day hajj, something the Al Saud family has refused. Its overseeing of 
Islamic holy sites, along with its oil wealth, gives the kingdom major 
influence in the Muslim world.

During Friday’s protests, demonstrators also shouted slogans against the US 
and Britain, long targets of suspicion among Iranian hardliners. But protesters 
saved their harshest criticism for Saudi Arabia.

“They have stabbed Muslims in the heart,” the protester Zabihullah Pirhayati 
said.
