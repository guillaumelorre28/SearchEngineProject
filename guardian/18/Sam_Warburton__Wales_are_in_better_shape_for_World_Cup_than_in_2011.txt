 to Ireland in a warm-up match earlier in the month but Warburton believes the 
fitness levels of his squad are higher than they were prior to the 2011 World 
Cup.

The 26-year-old flanker said: “We are in a better place physically. We started 
off from a better place from day one. We probably got to the fitness levels 
that we were at in 2011 a couple of weeks ago.”

Wales, who lost to France in the semi-finals of the 2011 tournament 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/15/wales-france-rugby-world-cup>, 
play Ireland again in Dublin on 29 August before their coach Warren Gatland 
names his final 31-man squad.

Warburton added: “I thought we were playing some great stuff towards the end 
of the Six Nations. We felt very comfortable playing together so it’s about 
getting that cohesion back by the time the World Cup starts.”

Wales are in World Cup Pool A with the hosts England, Australia, Fiji and 
Uruguay. They begin their campaign against the South American side in Cardiff 
on 20 September.
