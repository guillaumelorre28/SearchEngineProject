New Rave has long been a punchline; an aesthetic insult in the pantheon of 
rock ’n’ roll. The take-home image of a bearded man in tight lime-neon leggings 
and untucked white T-shirt, clutching an empty glowstick, is one from the 
Facebook memory catalogue of doom. But, a decade after it emerged, it stands as 
a key moment that presaged the era of fashion and music collaboration.

In the wake of groups that followed the bed-head, skinny-jeans/leather-jacket 
template set bythe Strokes <https://www.theguardian.com/music/strokes>, there 
was a move by bands to go for something more luxe. “We wanted to be sleazy and 
chic,” says Tahita Bulmer, the former lead singer ofNew Young Pony Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/dec/08/popandrock5>. “We wanted to wear 
colours, look smart and be glamourous. Not look like we’d just crawled out of a 
heroin den.” New Young Pony Club’s main style inspiration wasHalston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandhealth/gallery/2008/feb/05/fashion>: drapey 
and sexy in rich and deep colours. But they felt like they were in the 
minority. “When we started, there was no fun in combing music and fashion. 
There was no Lady Gaga. We embraced fashion and the fashion world was happy 
that music had embraced fashion again.”

For other bands, such as the Klaxons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/klaxons>, their stylistic template drew from 
the second summer of love. That look of the 90s raver was a grab bag of styles 
(necromancer, native American, goth, Rastafarian), imagery (the aciiid smiley 
face) and shades of neon. It was reborn as New Rave with its tongue ever so 
slightly in its cheek. Stylist Johnny Blueeyes, who styled the band for their 
Glastonbury appearancein 2007 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzYmoqmFazo>, 
says: “They had a sense of uniqueness and futurism. This informed the silver 
pieces that were specially made for them for the Glastonbury performance.”

“Compared with the first wave of rave it was very tame,” says Gildas Loaëc 
co-founder of the record and fashion label Kitsuné Maison (the label that 
released songs by key New Rave bands likeKlaxons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/klaxons> and Boyz Noize). “There weren’t any 
white gloves or whistles. It was like a normcore rave scene.”

Still, New Rave club culture threw up some unique fashion moments. Clubber 
Nicolas Payne-Baader remembers the atmosphere at clubs like Trailer Trash and 
Boombox. “It was so full on; there was this French guy who would show up every 
Friday at Trailer Trash with Capri Sun packets turned into necklaces.”

Bulmer adds: “It was great time for men’s fashion. After years of wearing 
crap, a guy could turn up wearing 10 different types of prints and neon 
trainers. Stylistically everything felt possible.” Magazines includingSuper 
Super <http://supersupermagazine.tumblr.com/> and websites such as We Know What 
You Did Last Night <http://www.weknowwhatyoudidlastnight.com/> fuelled this 
aesthetic.

However, this marriage of hyper-alive fashion and indie rock was a difficult 
one. “The more bands that were associated with fashion, the more frivolous it 
was seen as by the music industry,” remembers Bulmer. For the second summer of 
love, the end was nigh.

The fashion legacy of the movement was clearly felt on the catwalk in the 
early shows of Henry Holland and later Jeremy Scott. On a deeper level, though, 
it helped make the links between fashion and music more fluid. Ushering in an 
age where we have Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 1 collection and no one thinks 
twice about Justin Bieber working withCalvin Klein
