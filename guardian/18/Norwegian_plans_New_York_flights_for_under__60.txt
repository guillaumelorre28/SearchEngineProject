Passengers will be able to fly directly to New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> for less than £60 from next 
summer as budget carrier Norwegian steps up competition for transatlantic 
passengers.

The low-cost airline <https://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry> 
plans to take on some of the major carriers includingBritish Airways 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways> by introducing fares from 
as little as £56 on new routes from Edinburgh, Scotland, and from Cork and 
Shannon in Ireland.

Norwegian said it could offer the cut-price fares by using more fuel-efficient 
aircraft, and by flying to New York’s secondary airports, where fees are lower.

A spokesman said: “We are working on plans for new transatlantic routes from 
Edinburgh and Ireland which we expect to launch in 2017, and a key part of our 
plans are to make sure they are truly affordable, allowing as many people as 
possible to fly.

“A number of airports are being looked at while we finalise our plans but 
smaller airports in the US present us with an opportunity to offer some 
ground-breaking fares to passengers in the UK, Ireland and the US.”

The airline flies daily from London Gatwick to New York’s John F Kennedy 
airport,with prices starting at £149 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jul/02/norwegian-bargain-flights-no-frills>
. From early 2017 it plans to double the number of flights on the route from 
once a day to twice a day.

It also flies from Gatwick to Boston, Los Angeles, San-Francisco-Oakland, Fort 
Lauderdale, Orlando, Las Vegas and Puerto Rico, with one-way fares from £135.

Norwegian plans to publish full details of its new routes and fares early in 
the new year.
