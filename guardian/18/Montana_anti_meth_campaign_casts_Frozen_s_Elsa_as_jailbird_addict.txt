A sequel to Frozen, Disney’s biggest ever hit, is scheduled for release in 
2019 – but a sneak, if unothordox, peek at what its characters have been up to 
in the interim has recently been released by theMontana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/montana> Meth Project.

The MMP <http://montanameth.org/>, which urges citizens in the US state to 
quit drugs, has channelled its citizens’love for the Disney movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/20/google-autocomplete-why-frozen-film-so-popular>
 in a new billboard campaign apparently starring Princess Elsa.

In the ads, a less-glamorous looking Elsa is seen sporting a drug-raddled 
complexion, uncertain expression and a pair of handcuffs as she stands in front 
of a police mugshot backdrop, just topping the six foot mark, beehive included.

“Meth, just let it go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/apr/10/frozen-let-it-go-disney-hit-adolescent-lgbt-anthem>
!” urges the slogan, co-opting the title of Frozen’s best-known tune, in which 
Elsa reconciles herself to her ice-queen powers.

The artwork is credited on the ads as “created by a Montana teen”; part of the 
demographic the project is targeting in its campaign.

Says the MMP’s website: “The goal of the Montana Meth Project is to arm teens 
and young adults across the state with the facts about methamphetamine so that 
they can make well-informed decisions when presented with the opportunity to 
try it.”

The ads were not conceived in tandem with Disney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/walt-disney-company>, and, despite not 
explicitly naming their inspiration, may be flirting with intellectual property 
laws. The Guardian has approached the studio for comment.
