First, a disclaimer. I was among friends on Saturday night, dancing and 
singing and celebrating the music of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. 
Nothing – not the sticky, oozing mud, not the draconian sound limits, not the
plug being pulled <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVkWkNgvvu0> – could stop me 
being again transfixed and transported by a Springsteen show. It was, once 
more, a startling and joyful three hours.

But – and you knew there was a but, didn't you? – how much better it might 
have been.

I don't really blame the residents of Mayfair for the problems with the show 
in Hyde Park in London – the volume and the plug. I'd be pretty fed up if there 
were three-day festivals near my house on consecutive weekends, with assorted 
Olympics concerts to come. I'd be lobbying my local council to get the sound 
reduced to the level of the speakers on a MacBook. Having hadMr Hudson and the 
Library

play outside my house, I am familiar with the misery caused by live music you 
really don't want to hear.

Likewise I don't blame Live Nation for cutting the sound on Springsteen and 
Paul McCartney's romp through Twist and Shout/La Bamba, rather than risk losing 
their licence to put on shows in Hyde Park. Much as I love the E Street Band, 
Steve van Zandt's tweets that "we break curfews in every country 
<https://twitter.com/StevieVanZandt/status/224327627295567872>" and describing 
the UK as "a police state 
<https://twitter.com/StevieVanZandt/status/224327592357003265>" were the 
reactions of someone playing in a band whose every whim is usually indulged.

In fact, it's the whim of the band that's the issue here. Simply, the problems 
of Saturday night could easily have been avoided – if Springsteen had just 
played somewhere else for his London show, rather than returning to Hard Rock 
Calling, which he had headlined triumphantly in 2009, also quietly – though not 
quite as quietly as this time.

What Saturday night's problems proved is that artists are rarely the best 
judge of a concert venue. What they hear onstage is completely different to 
what we hear in the crowd; likewise what they see. So, Springsteen was 
apparently so taken with Hyde Park in 2009 – the show was later released as a 
fantastic DVD set – that he wanted to return, and I can see why. That evening, 
he would have seen an ocean of fans, framed by the trees of the park, bathed in 
the setting sun. I bet that's a hundred times better than seeing your fans 
swathed in the shadows cast by a soulless concrete bowl.

But he's not the one contending with sound reduced to 73db 
<http://hiddenhearingireland.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/bruce-springsteen-wants-hyde-park-gigs-sound-levels-to-remain/>
 for this year's shows. He's not the one who – if less than average height – 
would see nothing but the back of the person in front, because of the complete 
flatness of the site, with the sound further muffled by the bodies around.

The same applies in other places: I've heard bands enthuse about Koko in north 
London, praising itswedding cake-tiered balconies

, the sense of history it exudes. And I've stood on its stage, gazing up and 
up, and understood why they love playing there. But I'm more commonly in the 
crowd, fighting to get a sightline, cursing those balconies, from which only 
the front row can see anything.

It takes a certain alchemy to make a gig special. And Springsteen's shows in 
Hyde Park have been special. Both times I've been moved to tears. I'm sure the 
surroundings inspired him to raise his game to something even seasoned 
Springsteen watchers have judged incredible. But, for the fan, it can be an 
effort to stay involved when you are able to whisper and be heard above the 
music. Springsteen knew what the sound limits were, he knew the site was flat, 
but he chose to accept Live Nation's offer to play Hard Rock Calling again. He 
has to accept at least some of the blame for Saturday's problems.

Next time, Bruce, why not just play Wembley? There are sightlines for those 
who wish to sit, a pitch for those who wish to stand, and the sound can be 
pretty much as loud as you (or we) want. It's not as nice for you as Hyde Park, 
but it might just make for a show that doesn't leave people complaining as much 
as celebrating.
