publishing and its record label affiliates Dew Process and Create Control.

Michael Rapino, the president and chief executive of Live Nation, said in a 
statement Falls festival and Splendour in the Grass “attract the biggest 
artists in the world but still feel uniquely Australian”.

“We look forward to partnering with them to find new ways to grow our live 
event footprint across Australia.”

that owned the Big Day Out, in 2014 but the festival folded shortly afterwards.

Splendour in the Grass is the largest contemporary music festival in 
Australia, and has been held annually since 2001, mostly in July in Byron Bay.


Falls Festival <https://www.fallsfestival.com/> is in its 24th year, with 
shows in Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and Western Australia over the new 
year period, headlined by Childish Gambino and London Grammar.

The events at Lorne, in Victoria, and Byron Bay, NSW, are already sold out.
