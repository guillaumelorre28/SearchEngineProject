Tom Baker, Field Day’s co-founder, said it was an “incredible honour” to have 
Aphex on their bill. He added: “It’s truly amazing to have Aphex Twin headline 
Field Day, I’ve been listening to him since I was 16, he played and curated 
some of the first everEat Your Own Ears 
<http://www.eatyourownears.com/?ate=ears> nights (the most memorable being a 
warehouse on Brick Lane that got closed down by the police!). It will be a 
phenomenal, mind-blowing, mesmerisingly fantastic two hours of absolute genius.”
