. When he regains full fitness, the 25-year-old is set to be reunited with his

“We are delighted Scott has committed his future to the Scarlets,” said the 
general manager Jon Daniels. “The interest shown by other clubs is testament to 
his standing within the European game at the moment. However, Scott has 
consistently stated the environment at Parc y Scarlets is where he wants to be 
to further his domestic, international and British and Irish Lions ambitions.

“During the negotiations, and the associated media interest, he has been a 
model of responsibility and humility, which is further testament to him.”

Williams added: “It is exciting to know that I will be able to continue my 
development at the Scarlets. There is a real sense that there are exciting 
times on the horizon, and I am looking forward to being a part of that on the 
field once I return from injury.

“Continuing with my rugby development in Wales was vitally important to me to 
continue with my international aspirations.”

Williams is the latest Scarlets player to agree fresh terms, following the 
captain Ken Owens, the Wales lock Jake Ball and the Scotland back-row forward 
John Barclay.
