Delhi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/delhi> has implemented a 
fortnight-long driving ban that will take more than a million private cars off 
the road in an experiment critics say falls far short of what is needed to 
lower the Indian capital’s lethal pollution levels.


The scheme, which kicked off on Friday and will run until January 15th, 
permits only alternate-day travel between 8am and 8pm for private cars with 
odd- and even-numbered licence plates, while thousands of trucks carrying 
commercial goods are discouraged from driving through the city.


Most cars appeared to be following the rules on the first day of 
implementation, with traffic a trickle compared to the usual rush-hour chaos.

But the local government’s first major effort to clear Delhi’s air – the most 
polluted in the world 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/india-admits-delhi-matches-beijing-air-polllution-world-health-organisation-cities>
, according to the WHO in 2014 – has been criticised by those who say sweeping 
exemptions render it inadequate.

The measure’s focus is on restricting passenger cars which, critics point out, 
account for only 10% of the air pollution. Moreover, 27 categories of motorists 
are exempt, including all female drivers, the prime minister,Narendra Modi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/narendra-modi>, and his ministers.

Goods vehicles, which contribute 30%, will also be regulated. But more than 5 
million motorcyclists have been spared, for fear their numbers would swamp the 
already over-burdened bus and metro system.

“This is just a beginning,” said Delhi’s state chief minister, Arvind 
Kejriwal. “We’ll have to undertake even sterner measures in the future to 
safeguard our health, and especially our children’s future. It has to become a 
movement.”

The most contested exemption is the one for female drivers, which officials 
say is to ensure women’s security. A court will now decide whether it is 
discriminatory to allow women to drive around Delhi while some of their male 
counterparts will be forced to leave their vehicles at home.

Though several factors have contributed to the dirtying of the city’s 
atmosphere, the authorities are focusing first on reducing car pollution, 
despite the fact that it has yieldedmixed results when tested in other cities 
around the world.

While the Indian capital’s public transport system remains inadequate despite 
a new metro, there has been a surge in the number of private vehicles in recent 
years.

Many of the new cars and sports utility vehicles run on diesel, which is more 
polluting than petrol. A court has now banned the sale of big diesel cars for 
three months. There has also been a huge increase in the number of people 
commuting on motorbikes, which are responsible for nearly a third of the 
pollution.

The warning signs have long been there. In 2010 a top cancer institute in India
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> warned in an authoritative report 
that nearly half of Delhi’s 4.4 million schoolchildren were growing up with 
irreversible lung damage. None of the recommendations by this 
government-commissioned study were implemented.

“If this goes on, we’ll have a stunted ... population,” said Sanjeev Bagai, a 
paediatric nephrologist. “Delhi kids have the lungs of chain-smokers.”

The air pollution is so pervasive that even the leafy, exclusive 
neighbourhoods inhabited by the ruling elite have been badly affected.

On a recent, smog-filled morning, a reporter, Anjana Om Kashyap, took a 
portable pollution-tracking machine to the prime minister’s official residence 
to measure the level of fine particulate matter, called PM2.5, suspended in the 
air. These particles cause the maximum lung damage. They are smaller than 2.5 
micrometers, or 100 times thinner than a human hair.

Kashyap said she found that the PM2.5 reading outside Modi’s house was 40 
times higher than the acceptable Indian standard of 60 – which is more than 
double the European standard.

“Narendra Modi needs to think twice before he steps out in the open every 
morning at his official residence with his yoga mat,”wrote Kashyap.

 “That’s because the biggest threat to Modi comes not from any madcap jihadi 
but from the noxious Delhi air.”
