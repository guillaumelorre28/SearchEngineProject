The original lineup of Glenn Danzig, Jerry Only and Doyle Wolfgang von 
Frankenstein will perform for first time since 1983 at this year’s Riot Fest in 
Denver and Chicago, with the world famous drummer joining them on stage.

“The Misfits created the horror punk attitude and had a massive influence on 
modern rock, punk and metal,” Lombardo toldRolling Stone

“It was an easy decision for me to join them for these monumental shows. I was 
honoured to be asked, and am very excited to be playing with the band.”


Lombardo first met Danzig in 1988, when Glenn’s band Danzig played four shows 
with Slayer in the US.

“Dave is one of the best drummers around, and I can’t wait for everyone to see 
him pounding Misfits songs live for these special shows,” Danzig said.

Billed as “The Original Misfits,” the first show is scheduled for 4 September 
at Denver’s Riot Fest and Rodeo.

The group first split up in 1983, with bassist Only reviving the name for his 
band in 1995.

Glenn has not ruled out more tour shows after the Riot Fest shows, explaining: 
“We’ll see how it goes. It may lead to some other work, but who knows how it’s 
going to turn out? I mean, I don’t think it’s going to be a disaster; I think 
it’s going to be incredible.”
