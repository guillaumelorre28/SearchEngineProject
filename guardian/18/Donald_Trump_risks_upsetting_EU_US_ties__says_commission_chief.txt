 “The election of Trump poses the risk of upsetting intercontinental relations 
in their foundation and in their structure,” said Juncker, who as head of the 
EU’s executive is one of Europe’s most powerful political figures.

 His remarks reflected widespread shock and concern among Europeans at the 
election of Trump, who among other statements has praised Russian President 
Vladimir Putin and questioned the principle of collective defence in Nato.

 His comments contrasted with the more diplomatic reactions of European 
leaders who have said they look forward to working with the next Republican 
president.

 Juncker warned against the “pernicious” consequences of Trump’s statements on 
security policy. He also recalled a Trump statement in which he seemed to think 
that Belgium, the country that hosts the headquarters of the EU and Nato, was a 
city.

“We will need to teach the president-elect what Europe is and how it works,” 
Juncker said, adding that Americans usually had no interest inEurope

 “I think we will waste two years before Mr Trump tours the world he does not 
know,” said Juncker, who on Thursday had raised doubts about Trump’s views on 
global trade, climate policy and western security.
