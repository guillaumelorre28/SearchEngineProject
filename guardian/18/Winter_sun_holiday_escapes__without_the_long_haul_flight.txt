Desert camp, Morocco


Desert camps tend to be either ultra-luxurious or very basic, with not many 
options in between. Now The Souce, a new eco-spa camp in the Sahara, is 
bridging the gap, offering "raw luxury" in the middle of the dunes. The tents 
are plush, with proper mattresses, handcrafted furniture and en suite 
bathrooms, but you'll need to cope with a "bucket wash", rather than a hot 
shower, to preserve water. Still, you won't feel like you're roughing it, as 
you enjoy massages and spa treatments, daily yoga and meditation, and healthy 
meals from the nutritionist/chef.
• From £1,250 for a week full-board, including three nights in a riad in 
Marrakech, one night at Ait Ben Haddou kasbah and three nights at the desert 
camp. Flights extra, departures 9 March and 14 November, +212 661 215062

Family holiday village, Fuerteventura


Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, isn't really known for characterful 
places to stay – but it is a great family destination, with sandy beaches, warm 
weather and lots of watersports. Now Pierre & Vacances, which owns Center 
Parcs, is opening a "holiday village" in the north of the island, aimed at 
families and groups. The huge Origo Mare resort has 11 swimming pools dotted 
around the site, plus a giant waterpark, six restaurants and more than 40 
sports and activities. Accommodation ranges from a two-person studio to a 
split-level house for seven people.
• From £630 for seven nights for four people, accommodation only, opens in 
spring, 0870 0267 145,pv-holidays.com

Luxury apartments, Tenerife

The upmarket resort of Costa Adeje, in the south of Tenerife, has a cool new 
place to stay: Baobab Suites, a luxury apartment complex. The sleek, all-white 
building is set back from the beach on top of a hill, with lots of natural 
light and great sea views. Each apartment has a private terrace or balcony, 
some have private pools and hot tubs, and all have high-spec kitchens. There is 
a funky poolside bar and a gorgeous underground gastro bar serving tapas and 
cocktails, with plenty more bars and restaurants a short walk away.

Beach hotel, The Gambia


The Gambia offers fantastic value for money, has average March temperatures of 
34C, is only a six-hour flight from the UK, and on the same time zone – making 
it perfect for some early spring sunshine. Leo's Beach Hotel in Brufut, near 
the resort town of Kololi, opened last year and brings a touch of Austrian 
minimalism to west Africa, courtesy of its husband-and-wife ex-pat owners. 
There are six simple suites, spacious grounds with a swimming pool, and wooden 
steps down to a deserted sandy beach. The restaurant, serving a short menu of 
Mediterranean dishes made with Gambian produce, is popular with locals as well 
as guests.
• From £899pp for seven nights' B&B, including flights from Gatwick to Banjul 
and transfers, departures on 7 and 28 March, 0845 330 2060,gambia.co.uk

Spa resort, Cyprus

 Zening Wellbeing Resort, Cyprus. 
The Zening Wellbeing Resort, on the north-west coast of Cyprus, offers lots of 
ways to make guests feel great: Ayurvedic massages, infra-red saunas, indoor 
and outdoor yoga and fitness classes. Food is suitably virtuous, too: largely 
vegetarian with some seafood, or you can choose to go the whole hog (as it 
were) by going vegan. The entire resort is a "quiet zone" with no children 
allowed, so peace is guaranteed. Take a short stroll to the beach, or go for a 
proper walk in the adjacent Akamas national park – perhaps to the fabled baths 
of Aphrodite.
• From £423pp for seven nights' B&B, including daily yoga and meditation, and 
transfers, but excluding flights; opens in April, 020-8968 0501,

Mountain views, Oman

 Alila Jabal Akhdar, Oman. 
A spectacular new hotel is about to open in the Al Hajar mountain range, 
northern Oman. Alila Jabal Akhdar is 2,000m above sea level, overlooking a 
dramatic gorge, where the temperature is pleasantly warm (down in the desert it 
becomes unbearably hot). Guests can learn about the history and culture of 
Oman, try local arts and crafts, and take cookery lessons. Spring is the 
perfect time to visit, as the country's famous roses will be in bloom across 
the mountains.

Express yourself on a writing holiday at a former monastery in Deia, an 
unspoiled town near Mallorca's north coast. The programme includes group 
writing workshops, guided walks down to the sea and up into the limestone 
mountains, and mindfulness meditation sessions. Two swimming pools and lots of 
terraces are dotted around the house's old walled garden, which is full of 
olive, orange and lemon trees. The house belongs to PR guru Lynne Franks, and 
your tutor is Elaine Kingett, an experienced journalist and writing teacher.
• From £870 for five nights full-board, including four group writing classes 
and a one-to-one clinic, but excluding flights, 27 April to 2 May, no phone,
