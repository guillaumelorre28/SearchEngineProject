And so we reach the last in our series of track premieres from the Led Zeppelin
 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ledzeppelin> reissue series. Last on the 
list is one of the extra tracks from the reissue of Coda, the posthumous 
odds-and-ends album the group issued in 1982, after John Bonham had died.

If It Keeps On Raining is a rough mix of When the Levee Breaks from Led 
Zeppelin IV, and presents the track in a markedly stripped down form: John Paul 
Jones’s bassline is right to the fore, while the army of guitars from the 
finished version is pared down to the basics. It doesn’t have the grandeur of 
the finished version, but you can’t help but suspect that scores of early 70s 
bands would have killed even to be able to manage this.

Have a listen (but not if you’re outside the UK, sadly) and let us know what 
you think.

Coda – along with Presence and In Through the Out Door – is released in 
remastered and expanded form on 31 July.
