Flume cleans up at Australian music's night of nights

Elle Hunt

He led the nominations and came out on top with awards, too – Flume won five 
Arias for his album Skin, including Album of the Year (“the one I really 
wanted”) and Best Male Artist.

He used one of his appearances at the podium to rally against Sydney’s lockout 
laws, which he says deny others the creative opportunities he’s benefited from. 
Other artists,Montaigne and Sarah Blasko, also expressed support for the 
campaign to KeepSydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> Open.


Troye Sivan won two Aria awards <https://www.theguardian.com/music/aria-awards>
 for Youth: Best Video and Apple Music Song of the Year, the latter presented 
to him by a cheerily disdainfulRobbie Williams. Sivan claimed his wins for all 
of Australia’s LGBTQI community, whileSia’s award for Best Female Artist was 
accepted on her behalf by a marriage equality campaigner.

Violent Soho won Best Rock Album and Best Group, while Montaigne was named 
Breakthrough Artist andHilltop Hoods, Best Live Act. 

Crowded House were inducted into the Aria Hall of Fame, in spite of some 
territorial posturing on behalf of New Zealand by theFlight of the Conchords. 
Their performance of Distant Sun raised one of the biggest responses from the 
crowd of the night, as well asJohn Farnham’s You’re the Voice, which closed the 
ceremony.

If you’ve not had your fill of the Arias, Channel Ten is broadcasting a 
retrospective of 30 years of the event – but on behalf of Guardian Australia, 
I’m tagging out for the night. Thanks for following along with our liveblog. I 
for one welcome our new overlord Flume.

Janine Israel

John Farnham’s on stage to perform “Australia’s unofficial anthem” – you know 
the one. Thirty years old this year, just like the Arias. (The Veronicas 
actually bowed down to Farnham as he took the stage.)

You’re the Voice, actually written by four British songwriters 
<http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/why-john-farnham-was-nearly-rockblocked-from-youre-the-voice/news-story/9e048f2d4550a8b4c1a28e2eba4909f6>
 –Chris Thompson, Andy Qunta, Keith Reid, Maggie Ryder – began its life on 25 
October 1985, the same day some 100,000 people took to the streets of London to 
march in support of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

Thompson, who was kicking himself for missing the march, watched it on TV 
instead. It was the protesters’ passion that inspired the song’s refrain and 
title.

The songwriters knew they’d penned something special, but Thompson was adamant 
an Australian “joke” like Farnsy, who was then best-known for Sadie the 
Cleaning Lady, would never get his mitts on the track.

But he did, adding it to his 12th studio album, 1986’s Whispering Jack – still 
the best-selling Australian album of all time, having racked up some 1,680,000 
sales.

John Farnham’s performance tonight is rousing, spine-tingling, but he has some 
mishaps with his mic stands, in his sheer excitement throwing it in the air and 
failing to catch it.

And what do you know – here are Kylie Minogue and Joshua Sasse now, on stage 
to introduceTroye Sivan, who’s performing his Song of the Year, Youth.

Minogue and Sasse encourage the audience to get behind the campaign to Say “I 
Do” Down Under, with Sasse adding that 2017 could be the year that Australia is 
“back on the right side of history”.

What with Flume, Sarah Blasko and Montaigne rallying against the lockout laws, 
andTroye Sivan and Sia claiming wins for the LGBTQI community, it’s been quite 
a socially progressive Arias, really.

Just as I typed that, John Butler and Ben Lee, on stage to present the artist 
for Best Male Artist, acknowledged the traditional custodians of the land for 
the first time (on the television broadcast, at least) tonight. Lee also adds: 
“We also want to use this opportunity to say we stand with Standing Rock.”

Best Female Artist: Sia – This is Acting

Sia, nominated for a handful of awards tonight, has won a big one: Best Female 
Artist for This Is Acting.

The notoriously private artist is not on hand to accept it herself, and 
there’s a moment of confusion when an unknown blonde woman takes her place at 
the podium. She introduces herself asAngie Greene, a campaigner for marriage 
equality in Australia – and receives one of the biggest responses of the night.

“I can just walk off now,” she jokes after the sustained applause.

Sia had asked her to accept the award, she said, on behalf of “every single 
non-hetero and gender-diverse person, who can currently not marry the person 
that they love in this country”.

She’s wearing the same shirt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/03/margot-robbie-backs-australian-marriage-equality-on-saturday-night-live>
 asMargot Robbie did on Saturday Night Live, a design by Kylie Minogue’s fiancé,
Joshua Sasse.

If you’re watching the Channel Ten broadcast, you just saw how the television 
event covers an awards ceremony that’s been going for more than four hours and 
is still underway – that is, at breakneck speed.

There was a little medley of smaller award presentations, in which One 
Direction – in the past, one of the Arias’ big tickets – followed Sara Storer.

After a lengthy acceptance speech from Neil Finn, as well as a few words from 
other members of Crowded House, their induction into the Hall of Fame has been 
marked by performances of Fall at Your Feet byMissy Higgins and Better Be Home 
Soon byBernard Fanning.

They’re both lovely covers that do justice to the place this band occupies in 
New Zealand’s (and, I suppose, Australia’s) history. Higgins is on her first 
orchestral tour of Australia at the moment and if this performance – on grand 
piano, backed by string quartet – is a fair representation, it would be worth 
heading along to.

I’m told there are journalists in the green room reaching for their tissues. 
Then again, itis the first dry Arias – as you can’t help but be reminded of 
whenever the camera shows the “moshpit”.

Crowded House are now performing Distant Sun from their 1993 album Together 
Alone, Neil Finn still in his very purple suit.

Steph Harmon

In mid-show break, we received reports that the vibe inside the event centre 
is “stilted” and “a bit bleak”, with quite a few leaving early to hit a nearby 
pub.

The Arias are a dry event this year, meaning there was no booze until 
half-time. If an hour and a half without a beer doesn’t sound like a downright 
tragedy to you, you are clearly not a member of the Australian music industry – 
as the break wrapped up and the second half began, there seemed to be a heap of 
empty seats.

If the broadcast runs late, and/or is packed with ad breaks – a bunch of label 
execs running to the bar for a final drink could be one of the reasons why...

Here’s a glimpse of the bar during the half-time break. Spot the stars, if you 
can...

Crowded House join the Arias Hall of Fame

The Flight of the Conchords are on stage to welcome Crowded House into the 
Arias Hall of Fame. The “partially Australian, partially New Zealand” band is 
claimed by both countries, though that is obviously a cop-out because everyone 
knows that Crowded House would have been nothing withoutNeil Finn and he’s a 
New Zealander, so. (As am I.)

Brett McKenzie and Jemaine Clement say they’ve been sent by the New Zealand 
government “to stop it from happening”, brandishing a letter to that effect 
from “John”. If you have any knowledge of the New Zealand government and its 
head, prime minister John Key, this is not unbelievable.

“We can’t let this happen. You have enough bands in Australia,” says Clement.

“We really need Crowded House, our musical Hall of Fame is more of a Doorway 
of Fame. So stop it Australia,” says McKenzie.

Taking the stage to accept the award, flanked by members of Crowded House, 
Neil Finn expresses surprise that the duo were let in by Australian 
immigration, given their “subversive message”.

He also makes a sly dig at Montaigne for reading her speech from her iPhone – 
he appears to have written his on the back of a run sheet.

But I am especially pleased that Finn gives a shout-out to his wife Sharon Finn
. She owns a shop in Auckland that sells chandeliers, called Sharondelier – a 
fact I find myself regaling people with surprisingly often.
 Crowded House accept the Aria hall of fame induction, with Neil Finn thanking 
their late drummer Paul Hester: ‘We wouldn’t have been anywhere near as 
engaging or amusing ... without Paul. I’m so happy his beautiful daughters, 
Sunday and Olive are with us tonight.’ Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images

On the television broadcast, Violent Soho have just been named Best Group. 
They were presented with the award by three members ofSheppard, who are still 
coasting on their hitGeronimo! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_EXAyGCkw>, 
now two and a half years old.

“We’re up to present the award for Best Group, which is probably Aria 
reminding us that we’re not up for any awards this evening,” saysGeorge Sheppard
, flanked by his two sisters, dressed as 2010Katy Perry, as they are every year.

No one really seems to laugh, and the awkward moment is extended as it becomes 
apparent thatViolent Soho are not in the venue – “perhaps celebrating their 
previous win”.

After an excruciatingly long pause, during which the Sheppard siblings stand 
on stage stony-faced, what seems to be a random assortment of women – but turns 
out to be their partners – accept the award on Violent Soho’s behalf. It is the 
best bit of the television broadcast so far.

In her acceptance speech for Breakthrough Artist, just aired on the television 
broadcast,Montaigne read quotes from her namesake 16th century philosopher off 
her phone and referenced her bowel movements – three times a week, apparently.

That, er – doesn’t seem like enough?

If you’ve been following Montaigne’s career, however, this won’t be news to 
you. In April last yearshe told Guardian Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2015/apr/25/montaigne-new-faces>
 that her favouriteMichel de Montaigne line is “Kings and philosophers shit, 
and so do ladies. Even on the highest throne in the world, we are seated still 
upon our arses”.

Try as I might, I can’t immediately verify that quote.

Robbie Williams wore this green, satin (... sateen?) jacket to present Troye 
Sivan with Song of the Year, and said no more than 100 words total before 
legging it off the stage. Maybe not even that.

I don’t know if he’s been paid to appear here, but if so, that’s a good 
dollar-per-word rate.

Best Group: Violent Soho – WACO

Steph Harmon

Another win for Violent Soho, and one they weren’t expecting. In fact they 
were drinking beers downstairs when the award was announced, and they had to 
weave their way back up to the main event while their partners took to the 
stage to accept on their behalf.

“How do you keep your hair looking so great?” is an excellent question posed 
in the green room.

“Grapeseed oil and coconut oil,” is the reply. It is unclear if it’s a joke.

He led the nominations and came out on top with awards, too – Flume won five 
Arias for his album Skin, including Album of the Year (“the one I really 
wanted”) and Best Male Artist.

He used one of his appearances at the podium to rally against Sydney’s lockout 
laws, which he says deny others the creative opportunities he’s benefited from. 
Other artists,Montaigne and Sarah Blasko, also expressed support for the 
campaign to KeepSydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> Open.


Troye Sivan won two Aria awards <https://www.theguardian.com/music/aria-awards>
 for Youth: Best Video and Apple Music Song of the Year, the latter presented 
to him by a cheerily disdainfulRobbie Williams. Sivan claimed his wins for all 
of Australia’s LGBTQI community, whileSia’s award for Best Female Artist was 
accepted on her behalf by a marriage equality campaigner.

Violent Soho won Best Rock Album and Best Group, while Montaigne was named 
Breakthrough Artist andHilltop Hoods, Best Live Act. 

Crowded House were inducted into the Aria Hall of Fame, in spite of some 
territorial posturing on behalf of New Zealand by theFlight of the Conchords. 
Their performance of Distant Sun raised one of the biggest responses from the 
crowd of the night, as well asJohn Farnham’s You’re the Voice, which closed the 
ceremony.

If you’ve not had your fill of the Arias, Channel Ten is broadcasting a 
retrospective of 30 years of the event – but on behalf of Guardian Australia, 
I’m tagging out for the night. Thanks for following along with our liveblog. I 
for one welcome our new overlord Flume.

John Farnham’s on stage to perform “Australia’s unofficial anthem” – you know 
the one. Thirty years old this year, just like the Arias. (The Veronicas 
actually bowed down to Farnham as he took the stage.)

You’re the Voice, actually written by four British songwriters 
<http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/why-john-farnham-was-nearly-rockblocked-from-youre-the-voice/news-story/9e048f2d4550a8b4c1a28e2eba4909f6>
 –Chris Thompson, Andy Qunta, Keith Reid, Maggie Ryder – began its life on 25 
October 1985, the same day some 100,000 people took to the streets of London to 
march in support of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

Thompson, who was kicking himself for missing the march, watched it on TV 
instead. It was the protesters’ passion that inspired the song’s refrain and 
title.

The songwriters knew they’d penned something special, but Thompson was adamant 
an Australian “joke” like Farnsy, who was then best-known for Sadie the 
Cleaning Lady, would never get his mitts on the track.

But he did, adding it to his 12th studio album, 1986’s Whispering Jack – still 
the best-selling Australian album of all time, having racked up some 1,680,000 
sales.

John Farnham’s performance tonight is rousing, spine-tingling, but he has some 
mishaps with his mic stands, in his sheer excitement throwing it in the air and 
failing to catch it.
 
Bernard Fanning and Missy Higgins – past recipients of Album of the Year – 
have presentedFlume with his fifth and final Aria award. Not a bad return from 
11 nominations.

Flume says in his acceptance speech: “In a time of singles and songs, albums 
still matter.”

And that’s that!
 
Flume – in case it’s his last award for the night – is thanking everyone with 
a peripheral connection to his career. There’s only album of the year to go, 
but he’s nominated for that, too.

John “The Voice” Farnham is closing the show with a performance of – I’m 
betting – You’re The Voice.
 
And what do you know – here are Kylie Minogue and Joshua Sasse now, on stage 
to introduceTroye Sivan, who’s performing his Song of the Year, Youth.

Minogue and Sasse encourage the audience to get behind the campaign to Say “I 
Do” Down Under, with Sasse adding that 2017 could be the year that Australia is 
“back on the right side of history”.

What with Flume, Sarah Blasko and Montaigne rallying against the lockout laws, 
andTroye Sivan and Sia claiming wins for the LGBTQI community, it’s been quite 
a socially progressive Arias, really.

Just as I typed that, John Butler and Ben Lee, on stage to present the artist 
for Best Male Artist, acknowledged the traditional custodians of the land for 
the first time (on the television broadcast, at least) tonight. Lee also adds: 
“We also want to use this opportunity to say we stand with Standing Rock.”

Sia, nominated for a handful of awards tonight, has won a big one: Best Female 
Artist for This Is Acting.

The notoriously private artist is not on hand to accept it herself, and 
there’s a moment of confusion when an unknown blonde woman takes her place at 
the podium. She introduces herself asAngie Greene, a campaigner for marriage 
equality in Australia – and receives one of the biggest responses of the night.

“I can just walk off now,” she jokes after the sustained applause.

Sia had asked her to accept the award, she said, on behalf of “every single 
non-hetero and gender-diverse person, who can currently not marry the person 
that they love in this country”.

She’s wearing the same shirt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/03/margot-robbie-backs-australian-marriage-equality-on-saturday-night-live>
 asMargot Robbie did on Saturday Night Live, a design by Kylie Minogue’s fiancé,
Joshua Sasse.
 
If you’re watching the Channel Ten broadcast, you just saw how the television 
event covers an awards ceremony that’s been going for more than four hours and 
is still underway – that is, at breakneck speed.

There was a little medley of smaller award presentations, in which One 
Direction – in the past, one of the Arias’ big tickets – followed Sara Storer.
 
After a lengthy acceptance speech from Neil Finn, as well as a few words from 
other members of Crowded House, their induction into the Hall of Fame has been 
marked by performances of Fall at Your Feet byMissy Higgins and Better Be Home 
Soon byBernard Fanning.

They’re both lovely covers that do justice to the place this band occupies in 
New Zealand’s (and, I suppose, Australia’s) history. Higgins is on her first 
orchestral tour of Australia at the moment and if this performance – on grand 
piano, backed by string quartet – is a fair representation, it would be worth 
heading along to.

I’m told there are journalists in the green room reaching for their tissues. 
Then again, itis the first dry Arias – as you can’t help but be reminded of 
whenever the camera shows the “moshpit”.

Crowded House are now performing Distant Sun from their 1993 album Together 
Alone, Neil Finn still in his very purple suit.
 
In mid-show break, we received reports that the vibe inside the event centre 
is “stilted” and “a bit bleak”, with quite a few leaving early to hit a nearby 
pub.

The Arias are a dry event this year, meaning there was no booze until 
half-time. If an hour and a half without a beer doesn’t sound like a downright 
tragedy to you, you are clearly not a member of the Australian music industry – 
as the break wrapped up and the second half began, there seemed to be a heap of 
empty seats.

If the broadcast runs late, and/or is packed with ad breaks – a bunch of label 
execs running to the bar for a final drink could be one of the reasons why...

Here’s a glimpse of the bar during the half-time break. Spot the stars, if you 
can...

The Flight of the Conchords are on stage to welcome Crowded House into the 
Arias Hall of Fame. The “partially Australian, partially New Zealand” band is 
claimed by both countries, though that is obviously a cop-out because everyone 
knows that Crowded House would have been nothing withoutNeil Finn and he’s a 
New Zealander, so. (As am I.)

Brett McKenzie and Jemaine Clement say they’ve been sent by the New Zealand 
government “to stop it from happening”, brandishing a letter to that effect 
from “John”. If you have any knowledge of the New Zealand government and its 
head, prime minister John Key, this is not unbelievable.

“We can’t let this happen. You have enough bands in Australia,” says Clement.

“We really need Crowded House, our musical Hall of Fame is more of a Doorway 
of Fame. So stop it Australia,” says McKenzie.

Taking the stage to accept the award, flanked by members of Crowded House, 
Neil Finn expresses surprise that the duo were let in by Australian 
immigration, given their “subversive message”.

He also makes a sly dig at Montaigne for reading her speech from her iPhone – 
he appears to have written his on the back of a run sheet.

But I am especially pleased that Finn gives a shout-out to his wife Sharon Finn
. She owns a shop in Auckland that sells chandeliers, called Sharondelier – a 
fact I find myself regaling people with surprisingly often.
 Crowded House accept the Aria hall of fame induction, with Neil Finn thanking 
their late drummer Paul Hester: ‘We wouldn’t have been anywhere near as 
engaging or amusing ... without Paul. I’m so happy his beautiful daughters, 
Sunday and Olive are with us tonight.’ Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images  
On the television broadcast, Violent Soho have just been named Best Group. 
They were presented with the award by three members ofSheppard, who are still 
coasting on their hitGeronimo! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_EXAyGCkw>, 
now two and a half years old.

“We’re up to present the award for Best Group, which is probably Aria 
reminding us that we’re not up for any awards this evening,” saysGeorge Sheppard
, flanked by his two sisters, dressed as 2010Katy Perry, as they are every year.

No one really seems to laugh, and the awkward moment is extended as it becomes 
apparent thatViolent Soho are not in the venue – “perhaps celebrating their 
previous win”.

After an excruciatingly long pause, during which the Sheppard siblings stand 
on stage stony-faced, what seems to be a random assortment of women – but turns 
out to be their partners – accept the award on Violent Soho’s behalf. It is the 
best bit of the television broadcast so far.
 
In her acceptance speech for Breakthrough Artist, just aired on the television 
broadcast,Montaigne read quotes from her namesake 16th century philosopher off 
her phone and referenced her bowel movements – three times a week, apparently.

That, er – doesn’t seem like enough?

If you’ve been following Montaigne’s career, however, this won’t be news to 
you. In April last yearshe told Guardian Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2015/apr/25/montaigne-new-faces>
 that her favouriteMichel de Montaigne line is “Kings and philosophers shit, 
and so do ladies. Even on the highest throne in the world, we are seated still 
upon our arses”.

Try as I might, I can’t immediately verify that quote.
 
Robbie Williams wore this green, satin (... sateen?) jacket to present Troye 
Sivan with Song of the Year, and said no more than 100 words total before 
legging it off the stage. Maybe not even that.

I don’t know if he’s been paid to appear here, but if so, that’s a good 
dollar-per-word rate.

Another win for Violent Soho, and one they weren’t expecting. In fact they 
were drinking beers downstairs when the award was announced, and they had to 
weave their way back up to the main event while their partners took to the 
stage to accept on their behalf.

“How do you keep your hair looking so great?” is an excellent question posed 
in the green room.

“Grapeseed oil and coconut oil,” is the reply. It is unclear if it’s a joke.
