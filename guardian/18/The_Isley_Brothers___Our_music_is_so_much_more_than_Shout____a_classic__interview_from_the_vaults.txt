A short hop across the George Washington Bridge, Teaneck, New Jersey is a 
crowded suburban community, dominated by upwardly mobile black families. In the 
past decade the black population of Teaneck has escalated as blacks, like their 
white predecessors, have sought to escape the urban sprawl and tensions of 
Queens and Manhattan. The city is also home to a number of black entertainers, 
but by far the most prominent citizens are the Isley Brothers, who honoured the 
town by using its name for their record company logo.


Ernie Isley lives with his mother in a sleepy ranch house, tucked off a 
winding Teaneck back road. The white clapboard structure is also home to 
brother-in-law Chris Jasper and the youngest Isley, Marvin. The three, none of 
whom is over 24, make up the younger half of the Isley group. The trio joined 
their celebrated older brothers, Ronald, Rudolph and Kelly in 1969 and it’s not 
a coincidence that the transfusion of fresh, young talent paralleled the 
emergence of the Isley Brothers as a vital force in black music.

 The Isley Brothers: Shout! audio 
In the back of their house, only a few feet away from their expansive swimming 
pool, Ernie, Chris and Marvin sit around a table, fiddling with some phones 
they’ve been hooking up on the patio. A question about Shout, the Isleys’ first 
hit in 1958 and a record that heralded the coming of harsh, gospel-inflected 
soul music, brings a smirk from Chris and smiles from Marvin and Ernie.

“Our music is about so much more now,” Ernie offers. “We’ve got a lot more to 
say musically and lyrically. I-IV-V chord changes and three guys jumping up and 
down, screaming and shouting ‘wooo’ just isn’t where we’re at.”

“That’s right,” Chris solemnly intones. “We want our music to expand people’s 
consciousness and take them onto a different musical plane.”

While songs like Live It Up and That Lady may not be the sober, 
consciousness-raising vehicles Chris Jasper asserts, clearly the Isley Brothers 
are saying something that hits home with their audience. With the sales of 
their last three albums totalling almost seven million, the lsley Brothers 
rival Earth, Wind and Fire as black music’s most commercially successful 
self-contained unit.

In contrast to the inability of rock’n’rollers to age gracefully, longevity 
has always been a characteristic of popular black music. A look at the soul 
charts at any given time indicates the continuing commercial health of Esther 
Phillips, Bobby Bland, the Dells, Four Tops and others who have been 
successfully recording for 15 years or more. Among these venerable artists are 
the Isley Brothers, who have been a unit for almost 20 years, since their first 
doo-wop recording in 1957. But while those who maintain a continuing audience 
usually do so without altering their approach, the Isley Brothers have been 
engaged in a process of continual evolution, involving themselves in most of 
the major stylistic changes in popular black music. In the 70s, they have been 
at its forefront.

Despite their doo-wop dabblings, the Isley Brothers came of age with the 
gospel frenzy of Shout and Twist and Shout. The Brothers established a 
reputation as one of the wildest stage acts on the soul circuit, climaxing 
frenetic shows by crawling on the floor, climbing on pianos, disrobing and 
doing anything else to which the spirit of Shout moved them. It was also during 
this period that the Isley Brothers picked up a young guitar player from 
Seattle named Jimi Hendrix, who only added to the group’s unrestrained live and 
studio presence. Hendrix left in 1965, and the lsleys, after a period of 
commercial slack, capped their excessive energy and signed with Berry Gordy’s 
Motown label.

Motown was at its assembly line peak when the trio joined, but despite the 
regimentation, their enthusiasm and unfettered vocals gave them a raunchy 
fervour that stood out from the rest of Gordy’s stable. Though the group 
experienced success with This Old Heart of Mine and I Guess I’ll Always Love 
You, the Brothers never really fitted into the scheme of things. Stifled by 
Detroit formula, the lsley Brothers left Motown in 1968.

 The Isley Brothers: That Lady audio 
Previously, the group had experimented unsuccessfully with their own label and 
attempts at self-production. When they left Motown, the Isleys reformed T-Neck 
Records and signed a distribution deal with Buddah; with their initial release, 
It’s Your Thing, the Isleys had their first gold record. Unfortunately the 
stabbing, late 60s funk bass line of that hit straitjacketed the group’s music 
for almost two years as they churned out endless sound-alikes, including I Know 
Who You’ve Been Socking It To and Black Berries.

The release of Givin’ It Back in 1971 was a radical departure from the funk of 
the previous years. As Marvin explains, ‘”Everyone was looking for something 
new and wondering where it was going to come from. But nobody ever thought the 
Isley Brothers would be the ones to pull it off.” The title referred to the 
contents; pop/rock covers (i.e. Ohio and Love The One You’re With). The group 
and their band, which now included Chris, Marvin and Ernie, were presented as a 
self-contained unit. Though the album wasn’t a total artistic success, it was 
an ambitious move and one that planted the seeds for the group’s current sound.

The follow-up, Brother, Brother, Brother (and subsequently, a widely ignored 
live album), put more emphasis on establishing an identifiable repertoire of 
mostly original material. A reworking of the jagged It’s Your Thing bass 
figure, the addition of conga percussion, Ernie’s 12-string acoustic and 
stronger harmonies, created an attractive and accessible sound highlighted by 
Work to Do and Pop That Thing. The live album, and a version of Machine 
Gun/Ohio, also showcased the Hendrix-influenced guitar of Ernie, who has become 
a prominent figure in the Isley Brothers’ sound of the 70s. The constant 
comparison to Hendrix amuses him. “Everybody always mentions how much I try to 
sound like Hendrix or how I was influenced by him. But really I picked up the 
guitar for one reason, to play José Feliciano’s Light My Fire. In fact for a 
long time, that’s all I could play.”

In 1973, the Isleys transferred T-Neck’s distribution rights to Columbia, 
which has led to a marked increase in their record sales as well as to a 
continuing refinement of the Work To Do style and several tentative moves into 
new musical arenas. The 45 release of That Lady in 73 proved to be the ultimate 
distillation of the Brother, Brother, Brother sound. Smartly up-tempo, with a 
bouncy bass line, Ernie’s sinewy guitar soloing and an irresistible melody, the 
song was an adaption of their own, early 60s, rhumba-flavoured original. On the 
3 + 3 album, the song is extended to six minutes, most of them a vehicle for 
Ernie’s guitar pyrotechnics, displayed over an attractive, chopping rhythm.

While the rest of 3 + 3 turned out to be a somewhat disappointing adjunct to 
the delicious That Lady, Live It Up was one of 1974’s most stimulating 
releases. An expanded lyric conception, wrapped in engaging melodies, set the 
disc off from its predecessors and the album remains a successful hybridisation 
of the group’s earlier styles and neo-Stevie Wonder black music.

Since Live It Up, the lsley Brothers have released two albums, last year’s The 
Heat Is On (their first Number One LP) and the current Harvest for the World. 
While neither has expanded on the promise of Live It Up, both albums are 
satisfying, if predictable, reworkings of their already well-defined sound. The 
question is where do they go from here.

Marvin, whose baby features and bulky frame most nearly resembles that of his 
older brother Kelly, attempts to answer. “A lot of artists are in the business 
to get out. But we’re about music, that’s what’s important to us. We’re 
building a studio near Westchester in New York and in two years or so we hope 
to begin working with other artists.” Ernie interjects: “Every album is 
different for us and we approach each without a thought to what we’ve done 
before. If, for example, we decided to use horns again, they wouldn’t be used 
in the way they were on, say, It’s Your Thing.”

He continues: “Just because we have a platinum album, that’s no reason to 
retire or become satisfied. Obviously money isn’t a motivating factor. We’re 
artists and we use music to express ourselves. With all of us putting in our 
two cents, whatever we do will be creative. The Isley Brothers will never stand 
still.”
