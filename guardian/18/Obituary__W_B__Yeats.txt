We much regret to announce the death of Mr. W. B. Yeats, the Irish poet, who 
died at Mentone, in the Riviera, on Saturday, age 73 years.

He will be buried at Roquebrune, near Mentone. Mr. Yeats, who had been staying 
at Roquebrune since the beginning of December, was in a delicate state of 
health owing to a heart ailment, and took to his bed on Thursday. Last year he 
made a long stay in a nursing home at Monte Carlo.

 With Lady Gregory he founded the Irish Players and the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, 
of which he remained a director throughout his life.

He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. Oxford University honoured 
him in 1931 by the award of the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature, and on 
the occasion of his seventieth birthday he was the guest of honour at a dinner 
organised by the P.E.N. Club.

 He married in 1917 Georgie, the daughter of the late W.G. Hyde Lees, of 
Pickhill Hall, Wrexham, and they had one son and one daughter.

 With the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1928 he became a senator, but 
at the end of his six years' term of office he turned his back on the 
excitement of political life. The bringing in by the Government of the 
Censorship of Publications Act had much to do with his decision. He bitterly 
opposed this law. When in 1932 he founded the Irish Academy of Letters there 
was further controversy because he included in the membership several of those 
whose publications were prohibited from circulation in Ireland.

 His latest works were "Full Moon in March" (1935), "Dramatis Personae" 
(1936), and later still his "Essays."
