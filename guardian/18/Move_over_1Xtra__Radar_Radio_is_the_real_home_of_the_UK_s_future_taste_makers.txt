From the outside, the brick walls of the Islington three-storey building are 
so nondescript they could be home to anything. A printing company, perhaps. Or 
a crowdfunded startup. But this residence’s trade isn’t in business cards or 
unnecessary mobile apps. Instead, inside, twentysomethings are skinning up atop 
the Macbook holding their latest mix and a constant stream of MCs are waiting 
for their moment on the mic. On one of the walls there’s a handwritten and 
defining motto: “Tune in or fuck off”.

This is Radar Radio <http://www.radarradio.com/>, the station streaming the 
sound and tastes of young London. Over 100 shows in total beam out a concoction 
of grime, Afrobeats, techno and UK rap for 12 hours, every day. Mercury 
award-winnerSkepta <https://www.theguardian.com/music/skepta> has performed 
here, andMIA <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mia> has been interviewed on 
air. Ultimately, though, its main focus is less on the big names and more on 
bigging up London’s next generation of broadcasting and music talent.

How London’s NTS is helping to redefine live radio

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/03/nts-london-radio-station> 
Its roster of writers, DJs and taste-makers provide a blueprint for the future 
sounds of the capital, whether the alternative soul of Ralph Hardy’s show NANG,
Cadenza, son of reggae broadcaster David Rodigan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/24/cadenzas-no-drama-the-best-of-this-weeks-new-music>
, or Gabriel Szatan, a regular host on dance music siteBoiler Room 
<https://boilerroom.tv/>, who plays anything from funk to ambient. Whoever is 
at the controls, one unique USP unites them: ifBBC 1Xtra 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra> claims to have uncovered a new London act, it’s 
likely they’ve been played on Radar months earlier.

“Our strapline before we started broadcasting was: ‘The next generation of 
radio,’” says founder Ollie Ashley, who conceived Radar from his experience 
working at London stationsNTS <http://www.nts.live/> and Rinse FM 
<https://rinse.fm/>. These outposts of cutting-edge music have been 
long-established, but Ashley felt it was difficult for younger talent to get 
placed in their schedules. Supported by volunteers, Radar started broadcasting 
two years ago. Since then it’s grown to encompass 17 full-time staff. Most are 
between the ages of 21 and 25, and all ignore the clean formality and 
rulebook-obeying that characterises most mainstream broadcasting.

Radar’s rise puts it at the centre of a DIY online radio revival kickstarted 
by NTS in 2011, that has been nothing short of remarkable. It now encompasses a 
range of micro-broadcasters, including Peckham’s station-in-a-shop-window 
Balamii and Brixton’s socially conscious (and equally youth focused)Reprezent FM
 <http://www.reprezent.org.uk/>. NTS itself has since expanded to Manchester 
and even boasts, as of last week, an LA outpost. If there is a mic, it seems 
there’s a never-ending stream of talented future Annie Macs to hop on it.

 On the radio... Cadenza, AKA Oliver Rodigan. 
But while others aim for global reach, Radar, like Reprezent, has an 
educational focus and open-door policy. The station offers free production, 
DJing and presenting workshops, pushing the skills of upcoming broadcasters. 
“Some of our biggest names didn’t know how to DJ when they first joined, and 
now they’re playing sets all over the world,” Ashley explains.

Established names are starting to take note, too. New Gen, one of the 
station’s most popular shows, is hosted by 21-year-old Caroline 
Simionescu-Marin, a recently appointed A&R at XL Recordings. As the name 
suggests, New Gen aims to nurture the next wave of internet-breaking acts. This 
week, XL releases a compilation by musicians who have appeared on the show, 
including one of most talked-about new names in R&B, Ray BLK, south London rap 
crew 67 and Tottenham rapper Avelino. The station also hosted a night at Tate 
Modern earlier this year, another concrete sign that its taste-making is being 
noted by the mainstream.

 Coming up... New Gen’s Caroline Simionescu-Marin. 
In some corners, there is an adage that young people are too delicate, too 
self-obsessed with Snapchatting belfies or too defeated by their future to do 
anything meaningful about it. But RadarRadio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio> is proof that, given an 
opportunity, they will grasp it. They will move into the country’s cultural 
institutions to push forward something that represents what being young, 
British and involved in music is all about.

In the coming months, newly built studios at Radar will give presenters a 
space to improve their on-air interview skills. One of them, Ashley tells me, 
is the next Charlie Sloth. Others could be future presenters on theZane 
Lowe-helmed Beats 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/24/zane-lowe-beats-1-apple-music>. 
In Radar, he’s created a stepping stone to these realities. “Plus,” he says, 
drawing back to the handwritten message on the station’s wall, “you can swear 
on our breakfast show, which is always a bonus!”
