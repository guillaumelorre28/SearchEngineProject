Full-time: Cleveland 91-126 Golden State

The Warriors never trailed, leading by as many as 39 points in a lopsided 
126-91 win. It’s Cleveland’s most lopsided defeat since a 117-78 loss to the 
Boston Celtics in April 2015. Top scorers for the Dubs were Curry (28 points), 
Thompson (26) and Durant (21), but surely the star of the game was Draymond 
Green, who finished with 11 points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists and a career-high 
five blocked shots for his 17th career triple-double. (Perhaps not 
coincidentally, the Warriors are 17-0 in those games.)

Cleveland 83-121 Golden State 3.33, 2nd quarter

This is ... something. The Warriors are minutes away from snapping their 
four-game losing skid against the Cavaliers, a streak that includes their 
come-from-ahead loss on Christmas and the fifth, sixth and seventh game of the
NBA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> finals.

Cleveland 77-111 Golden State 6.39, 4th quarter

Thompson drains another three, the Oracle Arena crowd is on their feet, 
Cleveland calls timeout and I do believe that’s curtains.

Cleveland 77-104 Golden State 9.40, 4th quarter

The Warriors missed 12 straight shots over more than eight minutes – allowing 
the Cavaliers to pull within 22 points – but Iguodala breaks the drought with a 
basket in the paint. Moments later Green grabs a rebound that seals his third 
triple-double of the season: 11 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists.

The Warriors have 31 assists, recording their league-best 28th 30-assist game 
this season (no team has more than eight such games).

Cleveland 58-89 Golden State 5.48, 3rd quarter

When it rains, it pours: Cleveland’s Kevin Love is struggling with lower back 
tightness and will not return.

Cleveland 49-84 Golden State 10.48, 3rd quarter

The second half begins and the Warriors pick up right where they left off in 
the first, rattling off six quick points on threes by Thompson and Curry. That 
stretches the lead to 35 points and prompts a quick timeout by Cleveland’s 
Tyronn Lue.

Here’s a look at the half-time stats. Durant is pacing all scorers with 19 
points, but it’s Curry who’s leading the charge with 14 points, 10 assists and 
zero turnovers. Golden State’s 78 points are the most allowed by the Cavaliers 
in a first half since January 2011.

Half-time: Cleveland 49-78 Golden State

The ball winds up in Curry’s hands after a broken play and, of course, he 
calmly drains a 27-footer at the buzzer to send Golden State into the locker 
room with a 29-point lead. It’s Cleveland’s largest half-time deficit of the 
season.

Cleveland 46-65 Golden State 3.10, 2nd quarter

A dunk by Durant and a three-pointer by Thompson get the crowd fired up. But 
then Curry looks to pull up for a three before finding a cutting Durant along 
the baseline, who stuffs it home, and the noise is deafening. Another timeout 
for Cleveland.

Cleveland 35-52 Golden State 6.55, 2nd quarter

LeBron is fouled hard by Green while running a fast break and there’s a bit of 
a dust-up near midcourt as Cleveland’s Richard Jefferson steps to Green. The 
officials will review it to detemine if Green will pick up an extra penalty, 
while Green insists it was a flop. It looks like the refs will call a flagrant 
one on Green and technicals on both Green and Jefferson. PerhapsGreen’s history 
with the Cavs

Cleveland 26-48 Golden State 9.22, 2nd quarter
An 11-4 run by the Warriors to open the quarter with contibutions from Green, 
Livingston and Iguodala has stretched the Golden State lead to 22. The Warriors 
have hit their last eight shots. The Cavs call another timeout and need to stop 
the bleeding somehow to keep this one from getting out of hand.

Cleveland 22-37 Golden State, end of 1st quarter

An Iguodala three-pointer off a Curry feed extends Golden State’s lead to 
33-20 and makes it 13 assists on 14 field goals for the Warriors. LeBron 
answers with a two, but then Curry bangs a 26-footer for the final basket of 
the quarter to send the crowd to their feet. A dream start for the Warriors.

Cleveland 14-24 Golden State 3.58, 1st quarter

The Cavaliers were fortunate to only be trailing 18-14 as the Warriors had 
missed seven of their first nine shots from beyond the arc, including a few 
wide-open looks. But they weren’t going to miss all night. Iguodala and Curry 
bang threes on back-to-back possessions and just like that, the Warriors have 
opened their first double-digit lead of the night.

Cleveland 4-9 Golden State 7.20, 1st quarter

Irving gets the Cavaliers on the board, but Draymond Green finishes a fast 
break started by Pachulia to answer. Shumpert closes it to 9-4, but then Irving 
picks up his second foul less than six minutes into regulation as we pause for 
a TV timeout.

Cleveland 0-7 Golden State 10.26, 1st quarter

And we’re off! And the Warriors waste no time, sprinting out of the gate with 
seven quick points from Curry (a two), Thompson (a three) and Durant (a two). 
Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue has seen enough and calls a timeout. A high-flying 
start for the hosts.

Arielle Retting

Tensions are already running high inside Oracle Arena. LeBron James and Kyrie 
Irving were met with boos and taunts when they stepped onto the court, though 
there are plenty of Cleveland fans in the stands trying to drown them out.

With Kevin Durant scoring off a steal and dunking all within the first two 
minutes, Roaracle is louder than ever. And it’s only getting started.

Hello and welcome to tonight’s game between the Cavaliers and Warriors. It’s 
the second of two regular-season meetings between the teams – Cleveland won 
109-108 in Cleveland on Christmas – and a rematch of the last twoNBA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> finals.

The Warriors (34-6) have the league’s best record and rank first in scoring 
(117.5 ppg), field-goal shooting (.499), assists (31.2), blocks (6.1) and 
steals (9.4).

But the Cavaliers (29-10) have the NBA’s best player in LeBron James, and the 
four-time Most Valuable Player has been at his scintillating best against the 
Warriors. Consider that in 17 games against Golden State since the start of the 
2014-15 season (including the postseason), James is averaging 31.6 points, 11.6 
rebounds, 7.7 assists, 1.9 steals and 1.4 blocks with 13 double-doubles and 
three triple-doubles.

Tip-off is just over 20 minutes away. Plenty more to come.

Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s David Gendelman on the 
evolution of the NBA’s big man:

Last week, late in the first quarter of an NBA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> game in Detroit, Michigan, Myles 
Turner, the Indiana Pacers’s 20-year-old 6ft 11in center, popped out to the top 
of the three-point line and hit a 25ft jump shot with an arc so high the 
cameraman had to raise the viewing angle to follow it. Less than a minute 
later, he hit another one from the same spot. Both shots were so smooth that 
neither of them even skimmed the rim. The field goals were no anomaly. Turner 
is shooting 41% from the three-point line, well above the league average of 35%.

More than a thousand miles west in Denver, Colorado, Nikola Jokic, the Denver 
Nuggets’ 21-year-old 6ft 10in center, stood with his back to the basket, 15ft 
away, and threwa no-look, over-the-shoulder pass 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASlYP5vO0Jg> to a cutting team-mate for a 
wide-open lay-up. The pass, more common in a Harlem Globetrotters game than an 
NBA one, was nothing new for Jokic.A three-minute YouTube compilation 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-3uL4KhOk4> posted to the site last month 
highlights dozens of them. “Jokic actually has some flair,” said former NBA 
coach George Karl,whose controversial memoir 
<http://www.sbnation.com/2016/12/22/14059470/george-karl-carmelo-anthony-relationship-book-nuggets-knicks>
 about his life in basketball,Furious George 
<https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062367792/furious-george>, was published 
this week. “He throws some balls that only guards think about throwing.”

See you in June: Warriors lay waste to Cavaliers in potential finals preview

The Warriors never trailed, leading by as many as 39 points in a lopsided 
126-91 win. It’s Cleveland’s most lopsided defeat since a 117-78 loss to the 
Boston Celtics in April 2015. Top scorers for the Dubs were Curry (28 points), 
Thompson (26) and Durant (21), but surely the star of the game was Draymond 
Green, who finished with 11 points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists and a career-high 
five blocked shots for his 17th career triple-double. (Perhaps not 
coincidentally, the Warriors are 17-0 in those games.)

 
Cleveland 83-121 Golden State 3.33, 2nd quarter

This is ... something. The Warriors are minutes away from snapping their 
four-game losing skid against the Cavaliers, a streak that includes their 
come-from-ahead loss on Christmas and the fifth, sixth and seventh game of the
NBA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> finals.

 
Cleveland 77-111 Golden State 6.39, 4th quarter

Thompson drains another three, the Oracle Arena crowd is on their feet, 
Cleveland calls timeout and I do believe that’s curtains.
 
Cleveland 77-104 Golden State 9.40, 4th quarter

The Warriors missed 12 straight shots over more than eight minutes – allowing 
the Cavaliers to pull within 22 points – but Iguodala breaks the drought with a 
basket in the paint. Moments later Green grabs a rebound that seals his third 
triple-double of the season: 11 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists.
 
Cleveland 71-95 Golden State, end of 3rd quarter

The Cavaliers used a 15-1 run to end the third quarter. But the Warriors, who 
have led by as many as 36 points, still lead big with 12 minutes left.

The Warriors have 31 assists, recording their league-best 28th 30-assist game 
this season (no team has more than eight such games).

Cleveland 58-94 Golden State 3.35, 3rd quarter

There still more than 15 minutes left in regulation, but Draymond Green (eight 
points, nine assists, five blocked shots) and Zaza Pachulia (four points, 13 
rebounds) both leave the game to standing ovations.
 
Cleveland 58-89 Golden State 5.48, 3rd quarter

When it rains, it pours: Cleveland’s Kevin Love is struggling with lower back 
tightness and will not return.
 
Cleveland 49-84 Golden State 10.48, 3rd quarter

The second half begins and the Warriors pick up right where they left off in 
the first, rattling off six quick points on threes by Thompson and Curry. That 
stretches the lead to 35 points and prompts a quick timeout by Cleveland’s 
Tyronn Lue.

 
Here’s a look at the half-time stats. Durant is pacing all scorers with 19 
points, but it’s Curry who’s leading the charge with 14 points, 10 assists and 
zero turnovers. Golden State’s 78 points are the most allowed by the Cavaliers 
in a first half since January 2011.

The ball winds up in Curry’s hands after a broken play and, of course, he 
calmly drains a 27-footer at the buzzer to send Golden State into the locker 
room with a 29-point lead. It’s Cleveland’s largest half-time deficit of the 
season.

Cleveland 46-65 Golden State 3.10, 2nd quarter

A dunk by Durant and a three-pointer by Thompson get the crowd fired up. But 
then Curry looks to pull up for a three before finding a cutting Durant along 
the baseline, who stuffs it home, and the noise is deafening. Another timeout 
for Cleveland.
 
Cleveland 41-56 Golden State 4.21, 2nd quarter

Lots of talk on social media off the double technical. Here’s the official 
ruling:

-yes that's smart. He's a superstar and draymond has a rep

Cleveland 35-52 Golden State 6.55, 2nd quarter

LeBron is fouled hard by Green while running a fast break and there’s a bit of 
a dust-up near midcourt as Cleveland’s Richard Jefferson steps to Green. The 
officials will review it to detemine if Green will pick up an extra penalty, 
while Green insists it was a flop. It looks like the refs will call a flagrant 
one on Green and technicals on both Green and Jefferson. PerhapsGreen’s history 
with the Cavs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/13/draymond-green-golden-state-warriors-game-5-nba-finals>
 was held against him?
 
Cleveland 26-48 Golden State 9.22, 2nd quarter
An 11-4 run by the Warriors to open the quarter with contibutions from Green, 
Livingston and Iguodala has stretched the Golden State lead to 22. The Warriors 
have hit their last eight shots. The Cavs call another timeout and need to stop 
the bleeding somehow to keep this one from getting out of hand.
 
Cleveland 22-37 Golden State, end of 1st quarter

An Iguodala three-pointer off a Curry feed extends Golden State’s lead to 
33-20 and makes it 13 assists on 14 field goals for the Warriors. LeBron 
answers with a two, but then Curry bangs a 26-footer for the final basket of 
the quarter to send the crowd to their feet. A dream start for the Warriors.

<https://twitter.com/WarriorsPR/status/821168039634694144>  
Cleveland 14-24 Golden State 3.58, 1st quarter

The Cavaliers were fortunate to only be trailing 18-14 as the Warriors had 
missed seven of their first nine shots from beyond the arc, including a few 
wide-open looks. But they weren’t going to miss all night. Iguodala and Curry 
bang threes on back-to-back possessions and just like that, the Warriors have 
opened their first double-digit lead of the night.
 
Cleveland 4-9 Golden State 7.20, 1st quarter

Irving gets the Cavaliers on the board, but Draymond Green finishes a fast 
break started by Pachulia to answer. Shumpert closes it to 9-4, but then Irving 
picks up his second foul less than six minutes into regulation as we pause for 
a TV timeout.
 
Cleveland 0-7 Golden State 10.26, 1st quarter

And we’re off! And the Warriors waste no time, sprinting out of the gate with 
seven quick points from Curry (a two), Thompson (a three) and Durant (a two). 
Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue has seen enough and calls a timeout. A high-flying 
start for the hosts.
 
Tensions are already running high inside Oracle Arena. LeBron James and Kyrie 
Irving were met with boos and taunts when they stepped onto the court, though 
there are plenty of Cleveland fans in the stands trying to drown them out.

With Kevin Durant scoring off a steal and dunking all within the first two 
minutes, Roaracle is louder than ever. And it’s only getting started.

Hello and welcome to tonight’s game between the Cavaliers and Warriors. It’s 
the second of two regular-season meetings between the teams – Cleveland won 
109-108 in Cleveland on Christmas – and a rematch of the last twoNBA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> finals.

The Warriors (34-6) have the league’s best record and rank first in scoring 
(117.5 ppg), field-goal shooting (.499), assists (31.2), blocks (6.1) and 
steals (9.4).

But the Cavaliers (29-10) have the NBA’s best player in LeBron James, and the 
four-time Most Valuable Player has been at his scintillating best against the 
Warriors. Consider that in 17 games against Golden State since the start of the 
2014-15 season (including the postseason), James is averaging 31.6 points, 11.6 
rebounds, 7.7 assists, 1.9 steals and 1.4 blocks with 13 double-doubles and 
three triple-doubles.

Tip-off is just over 20 minutes away. Plenty more to come.
 
Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s David Gendelman on the 
evolution of the NBA’s big man:

Last week, late in the first quarter of an NBA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba> game in Detroit, Michigan, Myles 
Turner, the Indiana Pacers’s 20-year-old 6ft 11in center, popped out to the top 
of the three-point line and hit a 25ft jump shot with an arc so high the 
cameraman had to raise the viewing angle to follow it. Less than a minute 
later, he hit another one from the same spot. Both shots were so smooth that 
neither of them even skimmed the rim. The field goals were no anomaly. Turner 
is shooting 41% from the three-point line, well above the league average of 35%.

More than a thousand miles west in Denver, Colorado, Nikola Jokic, the Denver 
Nuggets’ 21-year-old 6ft 10in center, stood with his back to the basket, 15ft 
away, and threwa no-look, over-the-shoulder pass 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASlYP5vO0Jg> to a cutting team-mate for a 
wide-open lay-up. The pass, more common in a Harlem Globetrotters game than an 
NBA one, was nothing new for Jokic.A three-minute YouTube compilation 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-3uL4KhOk4> posted to the site last month 
highlights dozens of them. “Jokic actually has some flair,” said former NBA 
coach George Karl,whose controversial memoir 
<http://www.sbnation.com/2016/12/22/14059470/george-karl-carmelo-anthony-relationship-book-nuggets-knicks>
 about his life in basketball,Furious George 
<https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062367792/furious-george>, was published 
this week. “He throws some balls that only guards think about throwing.”
