I’m in a band called worriedaboutsatan, and ended up working with Adam Curtis 
after I approached him about five years ago todo an interview 
<http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4144122-its-the-inner-dj-in-me---ghosting-season-meet-film-maker-adam-curtis>
, primarily about the use of music in his films. I’d been watching them for 
years, and was intrigued by how he’d use snippets of really amazing stuff –Nine 
Inch Nails 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/jul/08/nione-inch-nails-beginners-guide>
,Burial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/oct/19/burial-10-of-the-best>,
Brian Eno 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/26/brian-eno-i-dont-get-much-of-a-thrill-out-of-spending-money>
 andEnnio Morricone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/17/ennio-morricone-hateful-eight-oscar-nomination-interview-60-years-of-music>
, all jostling for room over harrowing images of war and degeneration.

I spoke to him on the phone and wrote up the piece. After that we just kind of 
kept in touch. He’s a really nice guy and very accommodating to a squealing 
fanboy like myself. He’s also very up on new music, and into a lot of obscure 
stuff. He listens to a lot of music, but I think he gets hungry for new sounds 
quite easily. My job as music supervisor was basically to send him playlists of 
stuff I thought would fit in his films. It took me a while to get the hang of 
it, and the early ones I sent him were full of music that, looking back, would 
not have worked in a million years. He later told me that the only people who 
ever sent him music were me and Martin Jenkins, AKA Pye Corner Audio, whose 
haunting synthscapes crop up quite often in Curtis’s films too.

Here are five tracks in HyperNormalisation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/15/hypernormalisation-adam-curtis-trump-putin-syria>
 that you may not otherwise have heard.

This is actually the first time this track has been premiered in full, outside 
of the bit that appears towards the end ofHypernormalisation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/09/adam-curtis-donald-trump-documentary-hypernormalisation>
. Curtis came to one of our gigs last year, and told me that he was loving 
music that was really noisy, but turned really melodic. I mentioned that we 
were working on something that fit that bill to a tee, and sent it to him the 
minute I got back from the show. It’s taken from our forthcoming third album of 
the same name.

Tom Ragsdale is the other half of worriedaboutsatan, and whenever I send stuff 
to Curtis, I make sure to include some of our solo endeavours – mainly because 
we each make the kinds of music that work well in his films, but also out of 
shameless self-promotion. I guess when you’re as DIY as we are, you need to 
create a bit of luck. Ragsdale made this piece for a film he soundtracked called
Bait 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/bait-review-smarter-than-usual-brit-squeaker>
, which was released last year and directed by Dominic Brunt, aka Paddy from
Emmerdale <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/emmerdale>. But the 
arpeggiated synths and brooding piano work really well in HyperNormalisation, 
and also feature quite a lot in the short film Curtismade for Vice 
<http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/adam-curtis-living-unreal-world-short-film> 
recently.

When I first started sending stuff to Curtis, I sent him loads of Pye Corner 
Audio, completely oblivious to the fact that Jenkins was also sending him his 
own stuff separately! Jenkins is just a genius, and all his stuff is incredible 
– it lilts and wanes with this really creepy atmosphere, like a soundtrack from 
an alternate 70s, all slowed down to a trudging funk. We’re playing together at 
a show in London in February too, and absolutely cannot wait. We might just 
concede defeat and let him play for three hours instead!

This is a little solo thing I did a few years ago that I never thought would 
do anything but sit on my laptop. I was amazed to hear it in 
HyperNormalisation, mainly because I’d forgotten all about it, and had to go 
sifting through my own BandCamp to try and place which track he’d used! It’s 
the backing music to a bit about Reagan and Gaddafi, and it fits quite nicely. 
Not that I had that in mind when I made it.

Ghosting Season was a more techno-focused project that me and Ragsdale were 
involved in for a few years, but recently put to bed. This is essentially the 
demo version of a track that pops up on our album. I think Curtis is a fan of 
this one, probably due to the volume of reverberated guitars that feature on 
it. It crops up in a few of his videos, most notably theCharlie Brooker  
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/19/charlie-brooker-someone-threatened-to-smuggle-a-rifle-through-customs-and-kill-me>
specials that he made, and rears its head in HyperNormalisation. It’s not on 
Spotify or Shazam or anything like that, so I thought I’d include it here, in 
case anyone is interested.
