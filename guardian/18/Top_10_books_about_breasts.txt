Breasts. Boobs. Tits. Jugs. Whatever lovely word you want to use to describe 
them, there is no denying that these soft, warm, sensitive and pretty ingenious 
areas on a woman’s body have been the focus of art, literature, poetry, 
photography, music since they all began.


From the one-breast-uncovered messages of Renaissance paintings to sculpted 
breastfeeding goddesses spilling milky waters into fountains across Italy to 
lad-mag titillations and the rising popularity of Instagram accounts such as
4thtribodies <https://www.instagram.com/4thtribodies/?hl=en> embracing the 
natural changes of women in motherhood, I feel safe in saying that we all like 
breasts.

From a personal perspective, the last three-and-a-half years have taken me 
from a AA to a C to a DD to a slightly altered A; through pregnancy, colostrum 
and breastfeeding. Of all my body parts that might chart this recent history – 
of life, sex, motherhood, relationships, worry, passion - it has got to be 
breasts: days when they felt so grabbed I longed to flee (or lock myself in a 
room and cry), days when I stared in disbelief at the food my body was somehow 
producing in sync with my baby’s tears and yells; days I felt so strange seeing 
a child sucking nipples that hitherto only grown men (or teenage boys) had ever 
wrapped their lips around.

So I have a newfound amazement at and increasing confusion about why these 
body parts are not celebrated more. For this reason, I have chosen to focus on 
breasts in books. As my own book is a mixture of poetry and prose, I thought 
I’d include both in this list. I could have cited many more, but I hope this 
gives an air of the variety of inspirations that breasts can provide.

1. Bare Reality by Laura Dodsworth 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/286678/> (photography 
and short stories)
Despite our admiration for them, very few of the images, sculptures, words and 
songs about breasts are actually written by those who have them. Very few. 
Fewer still by their owners (if that works as a phrase!) So I have to start 
here. A collection of 100 stories, told by 100 very different women: from the 
effect of Hitler’s invasion of Poland on one woman’s milk stream, to butterfly 
tattoos, Buddhist nuns, mastectomy and a teenager’s embarrassment at having 
naturist parents. Each story is combined with a photo that is equally 
intriguing and important. And all driven by the passion of one photographer, 
Laura Dodsworth.

2. The Color Purple by Alice Walker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/12/color-purple-story-thanks> 
(novel)
Last week, my daughter and I stared at the purple crocuses coming through the 
soil. I forced her to look closely and told her about the The Color Purple. 
Walker’s characterCelie <http://www.shmoop.com/color-purple/celie.html> has one 
of the saddest breast stories I know, but one which is still so common: 
alienation from her own breasts; abuse of her own flesh; a physical and mental 
lack of ownership over her own skin. It’s more moving than any other book I 
have read featuring this subject.

3. Buffalo Soldier by Tanya Landman 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/buffalo-soldier.html> (novel)
A recent winner of the Carnegie medal, this novel tells the story of a single 
fighter in the US. A female soldier – one of the many women in history who 
tightly bound their breasts in search of acceptance into men’s spaces. The 
story of Cookie is set against the lesser-known history of freed slaves joining 
the US army and its attacks on the native population.

4. Femen by Femen <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/femen.html> (non-fiction)
“Ukraine is not a brothel” was the first cry of Femen, a feminist protest 
group founded there. Among a range of aims, their manifesto declares that “our 
weapons are bare breasts”, and the group have used them pretty successfully to 
garner public attention. It’s a fascinating read.

5. The Politics of Breastfeeding: When Breasts Are Bad for Business by 
Gabrielle Palmer 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/politics-of-breastfeeding.html> (non-fiction)
I did an MSc in development with economics. This book was not on the syllabus. 
I think it should have been;. Perhaps because it is an issue related to mothers 
and small cute bundles of newborn skin, perhaps because the argument is often 
falsely whittled into a guilt-led blaming of those who do and those who don’t, 
we often forget the economics and political agendas pushing billions in profit 
from an industry reliant on making breastfeeding problematic or unwanted.

6. The Clean Collection by Sabrina Mahfouz 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/clean-collection-plays-and-poems.html> 
(theatre and poetry)
This book includes three plays: Dry Ice, One Hour Only and Clean. I first saw 
Dry Ice at the Bush Theatre, London, written and acted superbly by Mahfouz, a 
one-woman show weaving together an array of different characters. Relating the 
tale of stripper Nina, the play takes the audience into her personal and 
working life – with all its heartache, absurdity and humour. It is a very 
balanced and poetic insight into the world of stripping, surgery and teenage 
Page Three ambitions, from a very relatable character based on the author’s 
years spent talking with those working at London strip clubs.

7. Lady Chatterley’s Lover by DH Lawrence 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lady-chatterley-s-lover-10.html> (novel)
Yes, Connie is a pretty obvious character whose body is focused on way more 
than her mind. Yes, Mellors the gardener is an obvious choice with speeches 
that remind me of Dick Van Dyke’s chimney-sweep English. But Jesus, in this era 
of airbrushing, silent and statue-still photographed bodies, these breasts are 
in motion, having fun: purely postive attributes swinging”softly, like bells”, 
stroked under nighties, wrapped “in honeysuckle” and held up to that “heavy 
rain”.

8. The Outsider by Albert Camus 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/outsider-16.html> (novel)
A book beginning with a mother’s death and a son’s cinema trip spent mainly 
fixated on the breasts of his “love interest” Marie. I hated this book when I 
had to study it. Not sure why, possibly just because I had to study it. Since 
breastfeeding, seeing how our society (myself included) still manages to be so 
awkward about the ability to feed a suckling child and at times add a lot to a 
sex life, I have reread Camus. The replacement of Maman with Marie, the ongoing 
descriptions of Marie’s breasts and the oedipal worry that still plagues us 
today in our infantile fascination with breasts is, it seems, best tackled by 
French philosophers.

9. Breasts by Maxine Chernoff 
<http://www.lyrikline.org/en/poems/breasts-6414#.VuASSGThByo> (poem)
Suitably positioned after Camus, the poem opens with the words: “If I were 
French, I’d write about breasts, structuralist treatments of breasts, 
deconstructionist breasts …” Chernoff goes on to recount, in absurdly delicious 
lists, the breasts she has witnessed in the worlds of film, song, and theatre 
with the brilliant closing image of Humphrey Bogart staring at Lauren Bacall’s 
breasts “as if they might start speaking”.

10. Sex in History by Reay Tannahill 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/reay-tannahill-accidental-pioneer-of-food-history-and-bestselling-romantic-novelist-760621.html>
 (non-fiction)
This is a scholarly yet accessible study of sex: cave to current day. Its 
range is jaw-dropping, from androgyny to Taoist sex manuals, ancient Egyptian 
contraception (crocodile dung, apparently) to Turkish eunuchs and courtly love. 
Although it is not solely focused on breasts, it contains several fascinating 
insights into when and why, and how and where, these body parts have gained and 
lost popularity and preference.
