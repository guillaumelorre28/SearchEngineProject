A migrant ship carrying around 100 people capsized in the frigid waters off 
Libya on Saturday and only four survivors had been rescued after hours of 
searching, aid groups have said.

Eight bodies were recovered, but poor conditions hampered the search, which 
was conducted 30 miles (50km) off Libya’s coast, Italy’s ANSA news agency 
reported.

Flavio di Giacomo, Rome spokesman for the International Organisation of 
Migration <https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration>, said four of the 
estimated 110 people on board had been rescued. He said more details would 
become available after the four were brought to shore.

The majority of migrant ships set off from Libya’s lawless coasts where 
smugglers operate with impunity, charging desperate migrants hundreds of 
dollars apiece to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing.

Last year saw a record high number – 181,000 people – heading to Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> by sea, the EU rescue operation 
Frontex reported. West Africans, most of them hailing from Nigeria, accounted 
for most of the migrants in 2016, with a reported tenfold increase in their 
numbers since 2010.
