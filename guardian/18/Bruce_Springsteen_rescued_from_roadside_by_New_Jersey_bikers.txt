Coming across Bruce Springsteen <https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen>
 on a broken down motorcycle on the side of the road could probably be a lyric 
from one of his songs, but it really happened for a group of veterans from New 
Jersey.

Bikers from the Freehold American Legion were riding after a Veterans Day 
event on Friday when Dan Barkalow said he saw a stranded motorcyclist up ahead 
near Allaire state park in Wall Township.

“Bikers gotta stick together,” Barkalow said. “I stopped to see if he needed 
help, and it was Bruce.”

Barkalow says they tried to help get his bike running, but when they couldn’t, 
Springsteen – wearing a brown riding jacket and a red handkerchief – hopped on 
the back of Ryan Bailey’s bike and they headed to a local bar.

“We sat there and shot the breeze for a half hour, 45 minutes till his ride 
showed up,” Barkalow said. “Nice guy, real down to earth. Just talked about 
motorcycles and his old Freehold days.”

Springsteen was raised in Freehold and still lives in New Jersey. The American 
Legion post says Springsteen is eligible to join since his father was a veteran.

“It was nice to help out,” Bailey said. “One Freehold person helping out 
another.”
