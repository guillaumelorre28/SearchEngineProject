Your choice of verb (NHS crisis exiles children to Scotland for specialist care
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/11/nhs-england-anorexic-patients-scotland-mental-health>
, 12 December) must have made many Scottish readers sigh. “Exile” is an emotive 
way to describe a journey to the top third of our island. It shows an attitude 
all too commonly found in articles about anything from national house prices to 
public transport, where “the north” turns out to mean nothing further north 
than Newcastle, and where “national” maps are sometimes cut off at the Borders. 
Your headline could just as well have read “Scotland’s specialist care units 
welcome children denied beds in England”.

• Ho ho ho? No no no! Far from being “false news”, as Kevin Meethan asserts (
Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/11/father-christmas-in-fake-story-shock>
, 12 December), the existence of Father Christmas is a superb contemporary 
example of profound myth. The good news is, there is more than one kind of 
truth; the false news is that “existence” is limited to certain physical forms. 
Christians believe that Christ is, in some sense, the “logos” truth; this casts 
no doubt whatsoever on the fact that Father Christmas is the “mythos” truth in 
which so many “millions” of us are currently (merrily) “colluding”.

• At age five I was disappointed to discover that Santa didn’t really exist. 
This was nothing compared with the devastation I experienced two years later 
when I worked out that God didn’t exist either.

• Geneticists have shown that one in 10 people, throughout the world and since 
humanity began, was not sired by the person they believe to be their father. 
This renders everyone’s research into their forebears totally meaningless (
