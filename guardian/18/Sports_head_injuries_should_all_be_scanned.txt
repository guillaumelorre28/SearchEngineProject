All the huffing and puffing by the English Premiership about its protocols 
regarding the pitch-side assessment of a rugby player who might have been badly 
concussed (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/08/northampton-saints-george-north-concussion>
, 9 December) amount to a dereliction of duty. Protocols are frankly worthless 
unless there has been an established baseline recorded on each player in the 
off-season. Rugby players, footballers, boxers, jockeys, polo players, bikers 
et al need to have their brain scanned.

When a player comes off or falls off having had a bang on the head, he or she 
should stay off. He/she should have a second scan and these two records should 
then be compared. They should also be kept so the player has a continuous 
record of his/her brain in case in later life he or she develops dementia. 
It is important that all sporting bodies recognise their duty of care to their 
players and performers. This lasts even when they have retired.
