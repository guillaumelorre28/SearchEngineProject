Everton’s two teenage talents talk, starting with Tom Davies, who says Lukaku 
is also claiming the third goal.

No chance he’s getting that one off me. That’s definitely mine. It’s my dream. 
To actually go out there and do it, it’s unbelievable. It hasn’t quite sunk in 
yet. It’s surreal, being with the first team in general but today to beat City 
and do it comfortably, it’s a great day.

And Ademola Lookman on his cameo:

The gaffer just said, play behind Rom. I was lucky to anticipate the ball and 
just put it in the back of the net, yeah. I just thought, it’s my chance to 
score a firstPremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>
 goal. And I did.

What an entertaining match. Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> were fully committed and 
excellently motivated, and after initially struggling to cope with City’s – and 
De Bruyne’s, in particular – passing, blossomed once they got their noses in 
front. City’s reaction to adversity, meanwhile, was extremely concerning.

Final score: Everton 4-0 Manchester City

And that’s yer lot! Everton’s players go straight to Lookman, who delivered 
the most delicious cherry to top what was already an impressive cake. That’s 
Pep Guardiola’s worst ever league defeat in management.

GOAL! Everton 4-0 Man City (Lookman, 90+4 mins)

Lookman’s scored on his debut! And, more enjoyable still for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, it came from a Stones howler! 
Stones, out on the left, tried to clear the ball into touch but kicked it into 
Coleman’s hip instead, and it rebounded inside to Lookman, who took a touch and 
shot through Bravo’s legs!

90+2 mins: Lukaku goes down, with Otamendi behind him. The Belgian gets up and 
pushes Otamendi in the chest, and the City defender falls over holding his 
face, as if he’d been headbutted. Pure silliness. The referee books them both.

90 mins: Everton’s final change, and another debut: Barkley comes off, and

88 mins: Some prolonged Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> 
pressure comes to an end when Barkley passes straight to Aguero. And then it 
restarts when Aguero miscontrols it straight back to Barkley again.

84 mins: Davies is fouled by a frustrated Sterling, gets a bit angry, and lots 
of players sprint to the spot for some mildly aggressive posturing.

GOAL! Everton 3-0 Man City (Davies, 79 mins)

The game’s won now! And this is a splendid goal from Davies! He wins the ball, 
sprints down the right, cuts inside past Touré and Clichy, passes to his left, 
keeps running, gets it back and chips beautifully over Bravo and towards goal. 
Lukaku tries to touch it in, but just misses it – Davies’ goal!

75 mins: Silva is booked for fouling Davies, who took possession when the 
Spaniard stumbled. City have been ragged this half. They may yet rescue the 
match, but the last half-hour has been extremely unimpressive.

72 min: Aguero has a shot! The exclamation mark is there more because there 
haven’t been many today, rather than because it nearly went in. Robles dives to

60 mins: Everton’s fans are booing enthusiastically, feeling they aren’t being

54 mins: A few seconds later Barkley rests a hand on Zabaleta’s shoulder, the

51 mins: Sterling has the ball in the net, but De Bruyne’s pass to him had 
been slightly overhit, and went an inch or two out of play before Sterling 
rescued it.

49 mins: De Bruyne had sent a shot wide after 27 seconds of the half, hinting 
at a determination in City’s ranks to get back on level terms as quickly as 
possible. That plan didn’t exactly work out.

GOAL! Everton 2-0 Man City (Mirallas, 47 mins)

The lead is doubled! Lukaku tries to play Mirallas through, but Stones slides 
in to stop the pass. It rolls to Barkley, who does pick Mirallas out, and his 
low shot across goal from the edge of the area nestles inside the post!

46 mins: Lukaku keeps everyone waiting, before becoming the last player out of 
the tunnel, a good minute behind anyone else. Eventually he deigns to grace us 
with his presence, and off we go.

The players retake the field. A big 45 minutes lie ahead, of potentially 
massive importance in City’s season. They will get it under way.

Meanwhile in Holland, Patrick Kluivert’s son Justin has just made his debut 
for Ajax. Nothing to do with this game, but interesting for the old-timers.

Half time: Everton 1-0 Manchester City

45+3 mins: And that’s all, for now! Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> have been the more dangerous 
team since they scored, though hadn’t really threatened until they did. Which 
is kind of the wrong way round, really.

45+2 mins: One City full-back, Clichy, crosses deep from the left, and the

45+1 mins: Into stoppage time we roll, and there’ll be at least two minutes of 
it. Probably more, given it’s started with Roblem rolling about holding his 
head, after taking a glancing blow from Williams’ shoulder.

45 mins: Lukaku is found in space on the right, but rather than crossing to 
Mirallas or playing back to the advancing-in-space Barkley, he tries to take on 
Otamendi and fails.

40 mins: Barkley does very nicely in midfield, ghosting past a couple of

38 mins: Oooh! Aguero only just fails to get his studs on the end of another 
low cross from the left. Just as well, perhaps, as he’d clearly dragged down 
Funes Mori in the build-up, and the referee hadn’t spotted it.

Everton’s two teenage talents talk, starting with Tom Davies, who says Lukaku 
is also claiming the third goal.

No chance he’s getting that one off me. That’s definitely mine. It’s my dream. 
To actually go out there and do it, it’s unbelievable. It hasn’t quite sunk in 
yet. It’s surreal, being with the first team in general but today to beat City 
and do it comfortably, it’s a great day.

And Ademola Lookman on his cameo:

The gaffer just said, play behind Rom. I was lucky to anticipate the ball and 
just put it in the back of the net, yeah. I just thought, it’s my chance to 
score a firstPremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>
 goal. And I did.
 
What an entertaining match. Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> were fully committed and 
excellently motivated, and after initially struggling to cope with City’s – and 
De Bruyne’s, in particular – passing, blossomed once they got their noses in 
front. City’s reaction to adversity, meanwhile, was extremely concerning.
 
The City perspective on the match, in three letters.

<https://twitter.com/ManCity/status/820653301704364032>  
And that’s yer lot! Everton’s players go straight to Lookman, who delivered 
the most delicious cherry to top what was already an impressive cake. That’s 
Pep Guardiola’s worst ever league defeat in management.

Lookman’s scored on his debut! And, more enjoyable still for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>, it came from a Stones howler! 
Stones, out on the left, tried to clear the ball into touch but kicked it into 
Coleman’s hip instead, and it rebounded inside to Lookman, who took a touch and 
shot through Bravo’s legs!

90+2 mins: Lukaku goes down, with Otamendi behind him. The Belgian gets up and 
pushes Otamendi in the chest, and the City defender falls over holding his 
face, as if he’d been headbutted. Pure silliness. The referee books them both.
 
90+1 mins: There’ll be about four minutes of stoppage time.
 
90 mins: Everton’s final change, and another debut: Barkley comes off, and 
Lookman comes on. He looks extraordinarily youthful.
 
88 mins: Some prolonged Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> 
pressure comes to an end when Barkley passes straight to Aguero. And then it 
restarts when Aguero miscontrols it straight back to Barkley again.
 
85 mins: Chance for Lukaku, who’s fed by Barkley and chips over Bravo, but 
can’t get his shot on target.
 
84 mins: Davies is fouled by a frustrated Sterling, gets a bit angry, and lots 
of players sprint to the spot for some mildly aggressive posturing.
 
82 mins: That’s Davies’ first league goal for Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>. It really was excellent work 
from the lanky-haired midfield tyro.

The game’s won now! And this is a splendid goal from Davies! He wins the ball, 
sprints down the right, cuts inside past Touré and Clichy, passes to his left, 
keeps running, gets it back and chips beautifully over Bravo and towards goal. 
Lukaku tries to touch it in, but just misses it – Davies’ goal!

77 mins: City have another free kick, after Schneiderlin trips Sterling. 
Robles catches De Bruyne’s resulting shot.
 
75 mins: Silva is booked for fouling Davies, who took possession when the 
Spaniard stumbled. City have been ragged this half. They may yet rescue the 
match, but the last half-hour has been extremely unimpressive.
 
73 mins: Another Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> 
substitution, Gareth Barry going off after what must have been one of his best 
performances of the season, and James McCarthy coming on.
 
72 min: Aguero has a shot! The exclamation mark is there more because there 
haven’t been many today, rather than because it nearly went in. Robles dives to 
his right to push it wide.
 
69 mins: Everton’s midfield has been excellent today. Davies brings them much 
more energy than they’ve shown at times this season.
 
67 mins: Barkley wins a free-kick in the centre circle, after being fouled by 
Otamendi. The fans go wild.
 
65 mins: Schneiderlin is the Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> No2. So much for “if you know 
your history”.
 
64 mins: And a substitution, and a debut, for Everton: Mirallas is off, and 
Schneiderlin is on.

62 mins: A change for City, who take off Zabaleta and bring on Iheanacho.
 
60 mins: Everton’s fans are booing enthusiastically, feeling they aren’t being 
given any free-kicks and City are being rewarded every time they tumble. 
Lukaku’s is the latest fall to be ignored.
 
57 mins: Mirallas goes to ground, clutching his left calf, after Zabaleta 
clips him with his studs in what appeared a fairly innocent challenge.
 
56 mins: City win another free-kick, on the left wing this time, and Mason 
Holgate gets booked for conceding it. They cross it into the box, and it goes 
out again the other side.

54 mins: A few seconds later Barkley rests a hand on Zabaleta’s shoulder, the 
City player goes down and City get another free kick. Barkley rolls around on 
the floor as if physically injured by the referee’s decision-making.
 
53 mins: Otamendi tries to take on Barkley, decides he’s probably unlikely to 
succeed and falls over for no good reason. The linesman charitably waves a 
flag, and City get a free kick.
 
51 mins: Sterling has the ball in the net, but De Bruyne’s pass to him had 
been slightly overhit, and went an inch or two out of play before Sterling 
rescued it.
 
49 mins: De Bruyne had sent a shot wide after 27 seconds of the half, hinting 
at a determination in City’s ranks to get back on level terms as quickly as 
possible. That plan didn’t exactly work out.
 
The lead is doubled! Lukaku tries to play Mirallas through, but Stones slides 
in to stop the pass. It rolls to Barkley, who does pick Mirallas out, and his 
low shot across goal from the edge of the area nestles inside the post!

46 mins: Lukaku keeps everyone waiting, before becoming the last player out of 
the tunnel, a good minute behind anyone else. Eventually he deigns to grace us 
with his presence, and off we go.
 
The players retake the field. A big 45 minutes lie ahead, of potentially 
massive importance in City’s season. They will get it under way.
 
Meanwhile in Holland, Patrick Kluivert’s son Justin has just made his debut 
for Ajax. Nothing to do with this game, but interesting for the old-timers.
 
45+3 mins: And that’s all, for now! Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> have been the more dangerous 
team since they scored, though hadn’t really threatened until they did. Which 
is kind of the wrong way round, really.

45+2 mins: One City full-back, Clichy, crosses deep from the left, and the 
other, Sagna, sends a looping header towards the far post, where Davies heads 
off the line!
 
45+1 mins: Into stoppage time we roll, and there’ll be at least two minutes of 
it. Probably more, given it’s started with Roblem rolling about holding his 
head, after taking a glancing blow from Williams’ shoulder.
 
45 mins: Lukaku is found in space on the right, but rather than crossing to 
Mirallas or playing back to the advancing-in-space Barkley, he tries to take on 
Otamendi and fails.
 
44 mins: This is quite a stat.
OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) 
4 - In four of their last seven Premier League games, Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have conceded with the 
first shot they've faced. Stunned.

<https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/820635215555153920>  
42 mins: Since the goal City have been flustered and imprecise, and Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> have largely kept them well away 
from their penalty area.
 
40 mins: Barkley does very nicely in midfield, ghosting past a couple of 
challenges, before finding Coleman in loads of space on the right, but his 
cross is disappointing, and Bravo catches.
 
38 mins: Oooh! Aguero only just fails to get his studs on the end of another 
low cross from the left. Just as well, perhaps, as he’d clearly dragged down 
Funes Mori in the build-up, and the referee hadn’t spotted it.
 
37 mins: Mirallas spears in a looping, high cross from the byline, leading to 
an almighty scramble as Baines tries to prevent four defenders from clearing 
it. Which he does, for a while.
 
The home side take the lead! City give away the ball in a dangerous position 
again, Davies intercepts and plays in Mirallas, who rolls the ball across to 
Lukaku, who sidefoots in from 15 yards!
