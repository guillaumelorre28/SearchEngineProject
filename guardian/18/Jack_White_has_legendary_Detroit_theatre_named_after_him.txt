One of Detroit's most beloved music venues is to be renamed after Jack White. 
TheJack White <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jack-white> theatre is the new 
title for the concert hall located in the city's Masonic Temple, which White 
recently saved from foreclosure by paying its tax bill.

Yesterday, the president of the Detroit Masonic Temple Association revealed 
White was the anonymous donor who paid $142,000 towards the venue's outstanding 
tax bill. "Jack's donation could not have come at a better time and we are 
eternally grateful to him for it,"Roger Sobran told the Detroit Free Press 
<http://www.freep.com/article/20130604/BUSINESS06/306040092/Masonic-Temple-Jack-White-Detroit>
. "Jack's magnanimous generosity and unflinching loyalty to this historic 
building and his Detroit roots is appreciated beyond words."

White has performed nine times at the Masonic Temple, including two solo gigs 
last year. He also used to visit the venue when he was younger, when his mother 
worked as an usher at one of the Masonic Temple's theatres. The Temple's 
smaller space, the 1,586-seat Cathedral theatre, will now be rededicated with 
White's name.

Completed in 1926, the Detroit <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/detroit> 
Masonic Temple is the largest Masonic building in the world. Occupying an 
entire city block, the 14-storey structure incorporates three auditoriums, two 
ballrooms, seven lodge rooms, bowling lanes and a barber's shop. The Temple has 
hosted concerts by acts including the Who, Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones and 
Frank Zappa, and was added to the US National Register of Historic Places in 
1980.

Although raised in Detroit, White now lives in Nashville.
