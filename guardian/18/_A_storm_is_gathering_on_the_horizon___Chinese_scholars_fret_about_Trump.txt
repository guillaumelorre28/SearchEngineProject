In the days after Donald Trump’s sensational election victory Chinese foreign 
policy experts heralded the property tycoon’s triumph as a rare opportunity to 
recast the often rancorous relationship between Washington and Beijing.


“In everything he is better than Clinton,” commemorated Shen Dingli

, a professor of international relations from Shanghai’s Fudan University. “We 
must welcome him.”

On Monday, as news of Trump’s latest Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> attack on Beijing filtered 
through to China, where the social networking site is blocked by Communist 
party censors, that tune had changed.

“Ignorant. Distasteful,” snapped Shen when asked for his reaction to the 
president-elect’s 277-character outburst 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/04/trump-foreign-policy-faces-scrutiny-as-team-defends-taiwan-phone-call>
 and his incendiary decisionto engage with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/donald-trump-taiwan-call-exposes-inexperience-china-state-media-say>
 on the telephone last Friday.

Shen, the deputy head of Fudan University’s institute of international 
affairs, said he had been outraged by Trump’s 10-minute call with the leader of 
Taiwan, a self-ruled island whichChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china>
 considers a renegade province.

“If he continues to call Taiwan a country we [should] sever relations with 
him,” the academic fumed. “I don’t know what the government would do [but] I 
know what I would do: I will close our embassy.”

Shi Yinhong, a Renmin University foreign policy expert, agreed the chances of 
a bitter and messy rupture between the US and China had increased following 
Sunday night’s tweets in which Trump again lashed out at Beijing’s alleged 
currency manipulation and construction of “a massive military complex” in the
South China Sea <https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-china-sea>.

Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for 
our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into..

their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military 
complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!

“It is still too early to make any assured predictions but I think maybe I can 
see that a cloudy storm is gathering on the horizon,” Shi said. “This is not 
good, of course.”

Referring to the billionaire’s latest social media salvo against Beijing, Shi 
said: “These words should again remind the Chinese media and a large part of 
Chinese international scholars and even maybe many officials within the Chinese 
government that their previous estimates of Trump’s disposition and his China 
policy are too optimistic.”

“The Chinese government, just like most governments in the world, doesn’t know 
who this Trump is and what kind of policies he will make. But the last week’s 
events will surely increase the worries in their minds aboutDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.”

Many political observers initially dismissed Trump’s decision to hold a phone 
call with Tsai - the first such call between a US president or president elect 
and Taiwan’s leader since 1979 - as the latest example of what some see ashis 
rash and ill-informed ventures into the world of international diplomacy

.


But some voices are pushing back against that depiction, describing the 
conversation asa deliberate and calculated move 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trumps-call-with-taiwans-leader-looks-like-a-calculated-move-some-experts-say/2016/12/04/52ff3304-ba15-11e6-817f-e3b588251d1e_story.html?postshare=4141480866617863&tid=ss_tw>
 intended to signal that the incoming Republican president was not afraid to 
play hardball with his Communist party counterparts in Beijing.

“I am 100% certain that this wasn’t an impromptu decision,” one foreign policy 
specialist with direct knowledge of the call told the Guardian.

The specialist, who declined to be named, said the 10-minute call had been 
preceded by weeks of discussions by officials working for Trump and Tsai.


In an article for the Fox News website 
<http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/04/why-trump-was-right-to-talk-with-taiwans-president.html>
, Stephen Yates, a China expert who some believe helped set up Trump’s call 
with Tsai, also hinted that the phone call had been a calculated move.


Yates said the conversation was designed to show China - “whose deeply corrupt 
and authoritarian government is used to getting its way from the United States” 
- that it could no longer dictate to whom the US president would speak.


Shi, the Renmin University scholar, admitted he was caught in two minds as to 
the true meaning of Trump’s latest moves.

“On the one hand I don’t believe that he would dare to dramatically change US 
policy towards Taiwan, even if he wants to… But on the other hand I still think 
there is a possibility - I don’t know how big - of a hardening of American 
policy towards China over the Taiwan issue.”


Such a hardening risked making relations between the two countries “very 
tense”, he warned.


Editorial writers at the Global Times, a Beijing-controlled tabloid, seemed 
similarly conflicted on Monday morningin an article probing Trump’s 
“jaw-dropping” decision <http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1021908.shtml> to 
talk to Taiwan’s democratically-elected leader.

Already though one definite conclusion could be drawn, the newspaper argued. 
“China,” it said, “should understand Trump has two faces.”
