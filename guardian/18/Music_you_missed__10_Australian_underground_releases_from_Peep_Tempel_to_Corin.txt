These nine albums share something. A line from Anthrocene on Nick Cave’s 
record Skeleton Tree kept coming to me as I wrote this column: “Animals pull 
the night around their shoulders.”

These are albums you can pull around your shoulders. None have singles that 
tower above the rest but each has succeeded in making and maintaining a 
distinct universe; a space you can – or must – enter into and exist in for the 
duration of the album.

Angel Eyes – The Never Album
&lt;a href="http://angeleyes2.bandcamp.com/album/the-never-album"&gt;The Never 
Album by Angel Eyes&lt;/a&gt; 
Imagine a bunch of 80s synth ballads have splintered apart. The filler is 
shed, leaving just shards of pure glistening sentiment. That “bit” in the song 
that gets you every time. Imagine holding a kaleidoscope full of these 
fragments to the light as they settle into strange new shapes. The music of 
Angel Eyes (Andrew Cowie) has no hooks, choruses or earworms. The kaleidoscope 
revolves, revealing configurations that are beautiful but too fleeting to grasp.

Pastiche of the 80s is overplayed, as is music trading in nostalgia and 
homage. You must be very good to cut through, and Cowie is a master. He knows 
when to let a single sound or beat ride out alone and precisely when to seed in 
the next. Bent, stretched and warped sounds bleed into each other, as 
melancholic as William Baskinski’s decayed tape loops. I’m reminded of Bjork, 
too,saying that making Vespertine’s “microbeats … was like doing a huge 
embroidery piece”

. The Never Album has a similar intricacy but no hard edges. It’s possible the 
whole thing’s been dipped in afternoon sun.

The Nation Blue – Black

The Nation Blue play heavy rock with heavy themes. Live, they are tight and 
mean with the locked-in chemistry a trio can really own. Singer (OK, shouter) 
and guitarist Tom Lyngcoln’s head often bleeds, victim to his habit of bashing 
it with a mic in a way that appears grimly, personally punitive.

Despite these masculine tropes, it is masculinity The Nation Blue seem to 
abhor, buckling under the weight of the worst of their gender’s sins. “Packs in 
cars, packs in bars and staring in the street/AVOs, big black eyes from nice 
guys, nice guys, nice guys,” Lyngcoln sings on Erectile Dysfunction. On Beat 
That Man he nails the reality of domestic violence: “Behind closed doors lie 
third world wars.”

Black was released alongside a second album, Blue, after seven years waylaid 
by projects includingHarmony <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOcxhBwwigQ> and 
High Tension <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XWdh0JXtVE>. Perhaps the break 
allowed them to return purged of any misapprehensions as to what The Nation 
Blue does best: political punk rock intent on shoving us into the roiling guts 
of all we have to be angry about in Australia.

Carla dal Forno – You Know What It’s Like

When you listen to the other women Carla dal Forno’s voice is suggestive of – 
Laeticia Sadier (Stereolab), Zoë Randell (Luluc) or Victoria Legrand (Beach 
House) – you realise she makes these restrained singers approximate divas. Nico 
would be a fair call if dal Forno were stern but her voice is serene, 
inscrutable and more than a little feline. Or, as it was described by Emily 
Bick in The Wire, “the voice of the eternal observer”.

In an era over-heated by over-sharing and identity politics, dal Forno’s 
detachedness is an inhalation of cool, fresh air. Trained as a visual artist 
and living in Berlin, she shares Ela Stiles’ instinct for minimal beats with 
maximum mood and some of the best songs are instrumental, such as the hypnotic 
DB Rip, made mainly on a vintage synth.

The record’s best quality is a stillness at its core that can’t quite be 
fathomed, as if its songs are disturbances rippling silkily outwards while a 
lake’s centre regathers its calm.

The Peep Tempel - Joy

A flock of corellas squawks as a car revs to life; a Land Cruiser, probably. 
Singer and guitarist Blake Scott (originally from the country himself) gears 
down into a talk-sing, heavy on the ‘strine: “My wife’s father was the family 
patriarch, a detective Sergeant, that’s how I started”. The song,Constable 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzqW-zBYcA>, ends with the purr of an idling 
motor.

The Peep Tempel follow in the grog-rock tradition of The Cosmic Psychos 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q954LxEzyY8> without banking on our fondness 
for the boorishness. My soft spot for the Psychos is a legacy item – newcomers 
don’t get that latitude. Not that they need it. The Peep Tempel’s brilliance 
lies in inhabiting what they critique. They crawl inside the dusty, drunken 
skin of the constable and the repellent, cricket-loving miner on Kalgoorlie who 
slurs: “I’m salt of the earth, assaulting the earth”.

Scott’s voice swaggers from burly punk bully on Rayguns 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI3yDxiZGqM> to affected git on Totality 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlcyAftJSuA> and while the characters are 
bleak the songs boil over from verse to shout-a-long chorus in a way that’s 
pure pleasure.

Sweet Whirl – O.K. Permanent Wave
&lt;a 
href="http://nicemusiclabel.bandcamp.com/album/007-o-k-permanent-wave"&gt;007 
&amp;#39;O.K. Permanent Wave&amp;#39; by Sweet Whirl&lt;/a&gt; 
Sweet Whirl is the solo project of Esther Edquist (Superstar, Geoffrey 
O’Connor, Scott and Charlene’s Wedding). Recorded after-hours at Polyester 
Records, the album captures traffic, trams and people walking by on busy 
Brunswick Street. Aside from these ambient interlopers it is just Edquist and a 
languid bass guitar. The album is achingly simple, guided by a shared vision 
between her and Simon Karis (recorder and producer) that favours a smudged and 
spatial approach to sound inspired by musicians such as Grouper and Fennesz.

Edquist’s voice is beautiful but shy. Doused in reverb, it never meets your 
eye but is reminiscent of Margo Timmins of Cowboy Junkies all the same. The 
songs duck and weave too, bashful about their beauty, happy to be half-heard in 
the lo-fi murk. The record’s imperfections are its charms: a blown-out speaker 
buzzes on Girl, U and Half Moon ends too abruptly. Like Cat Power playing live, 
however, an abrupt end is choice that illustrates, and resists, how easily we 
are lulled by cliches like a fade-out. With music this soft on your skin, small 
acts of rebellion feel big.

Virtuality strikes you most when a track from it comes on in a shuffled 
playlist. Compared to anything, really, Corin Ileto’s songs gleam as sterile 
and silvery as a tool plucked from an autoclave. Play Vexations loud enough and 
it makes mincemeat of the air. It is electronic music that’s been atomised, 
analysed and recast harder, better and stronger. Stubbornly devoid of soul and 
utterly futuristic, it is reminiscent ofKode9’s 2015 record Nothing

 Corin Ileto makes ‘electronic music that’s been atomised, analysed and recast 
harder, better and stronger’. Photograph: Phebe Schmidt 
The deconstructed/reconstructed theme persists relentlessly across 
Virtuality’s seven songs. The chiming synth cascades on Hyperdrive could 
imposter onto a new age compilation, Point Zero could be the swipes and stabs 
of a lightsaber in a videogame, and Void is grime on botox with sharp, 
shellacked nails.

It is a record that poses a question: if this is music made by a human to 
mimic music made by a robot, would the reverse sound the same?

Oren Ambarchi – Hubris

About a decade ago a friend introduced me to the concept of a “tone poem” with 
a 10-minute piece called Corkscrew 
<https://orenambarchi.bandcamp.com/track/corkscrew> by experimental musician 
and guitarist Oren Ambarchi. I never verified if the label was correct but I 
loved the idea; it indicates that Ambarchi’s work is best appreciated via deep 
listening.

That changes with Hubris, which yields its gratifications far more generously 
and features a cast of collaborators including Jim O’Rourke, Crys Cole, Arto 
Lindsay, Keith Fullerton Whitman and Joe Talia.

While Hubris 3 will enthrall fans of heady skronking noise-jazz, the airier 
Hubris 1 appeals most to me, playfully revealed only in its last moments to be 
centered around a loop (presumably) of muted guitar plucking. Its mood is light 
yet hypnotic; it could soundtrack a film sequence in which a high stakes 
code-cracking marathon ensues. While it is similar in kosmiche flavour to the 
effervescent synth jams of Edition Mego labelmates Emeralds, it is truly 
satisfying to hear it build so seamlessly over 20 fast-passing minutes.

Thigh Master – Early Times
&lt;a href="http://thighmaster.bandcamp.com/album/early-times"&gt;Early Times 
by Thigh Master&lt;/a&gt; 
Some critics say a gig mustn’t inform your evaluation of a record, but they 
haven’t seen Thigh Master. When the Brisbane band played late and loose at the 
Union Hotel in Sydney the mood spilled right across the room, freeing everyone 
of their inhibitions. When I heard their debut record a few weeks later it 
summoned the same sense of short-lived liberation; a weirdly desperate 
conviction that you must take that free feel when you can and ride it for all 
it’s worth.

Mostly, it emanates from singer, guitarist and hot mess Matthew Ford who also 
runs goal-kicking Brisbane labelTenth Court <https://tenthcourt.bandcamp.com/>. 
The record was written in a Milton share house shadowed by the 4X brewery with 
“the stench of rotting hops in the air”.

There have been line-up changes since then, and these days the dense guitar 
tones come care of Innez Tulloch (no surprise given her previous band Roku 
Music made2014’s best shoegaze track 
<https://sonicmasalarecords.bandcamp.com/track/colliderhttps://sonicmasalarecords.bandcamp.com/track/colliderhttps://sonicmasalarecords.bandcamp.com/track/collider>
). Fans of Dinosaur Jnr’s melodic fuzz will delight, while fans of a good old 
laugh-sing routine will find no better example than Ford’s chorus on Flat City.

The inspirations of Brisbane surf garage rock band Some Jerks are worn as loud 
and proud as a hibiscus print button-up: Dick Dale and The Del-Tones, The 
B-52s, The Shangri Las and the 5.6.7.8’s.


On the trio’s second record – the first release on new Brisbane label Pig City 
Records <http://www.pigcityrecords.com/> – they kill the Slayer sacred cow by 
adding handclaps to a cover of Raining Blood and Stratocaster-ing it into a 
song to do the stomp to. The record’s surf guitar gallop ends just 25 minutes 
after it begins with a cover of Blondie song Dreaming that sounds a lot like 
the original but marginally, miraculously better, as Victoria Watson sings it 
like she’s been perfecting it privately all her life.
