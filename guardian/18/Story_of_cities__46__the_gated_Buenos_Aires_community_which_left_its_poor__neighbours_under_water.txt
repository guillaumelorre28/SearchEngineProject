On 2 April 2013, Matías Duarte awoke at three in the morning. For once it was 
not the noise of his alarm clock that stirred him, but the sound of pouring 
rain outside – and a room flooded to the level of his bed.


Duarte lived in Las Tunas, a working-class neighbourhood 35km north-west of 
Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires. Running through the centre of the 
neighbourhood is thearroyo Las Tunas, a small creek. Though the arroyo had 
flooded before, it hadnever been this severe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/apr/03/buenos-aires-flooding-video>
.


Panicked, Duarte waded out of his room. Outside, the rest of his family were 
desperately trying to salvage what few possessions they could before leaving 
the house. A neighbour banged on their front door: “We’ve got to get down to 
the wall,” he called out. “We’re tearing it down.”

The wall in question was a 10-ft tall concrete structure which separated 
working-class Las Tunas fromNordelta <http://www.nordelta.com/en/>, the richest 
and best-known gated community in Buenos Aires. Walls like this have become a 
fact of life for many in the city’s suburbs. Tearing it down was the only hope 
Las Tunas had for keeping the floodwaters from rising any further.

Concrete walls

Las Tunas was originally settled in the 1960s after new factories had sprung 
up in the area – encouraged by the numerous railroads connecting the area with 
the port of Buenos Aires, and the completion of the nearby Pan-American highway.

Las Tunas grew to house workers at these factories. By the 1990s, rising 
prices in central Buenos Aires would turn it into a “bedroom community” for 
blue-collar workers commuting to the centre of town as well. The population 
swelled, and Las Tunas is still one of the most densely populated 
neighbourhoods in the Buenos Aires suburb of Tigre.

Las Tunas also remains solidly working class. It’s not completely destitute: 
walk through the neighbourhood and you will encounter a handful of well-kept 
homes with new compact Fiats parked out front.

A new kind of neighbourhood appeared that would make these dreams come true: 
the gated community

But the sidewalks are often littered with piles of dirt and debris, and the 
flow of traffic on the streets is occasionally punctuated by the clip-clop of 
horse-drawn carts,driven by cartoneros 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/20/buenos-aires-litter-pickers-cartoneros-recycling-argentina-environment>
 seeking rubbish that they might be able to resell for a few pesos. The lack of 
running water and sewers means that every so often, people walking by catch a 
whiff of something unpleasant.

On the other side of the concrete wall that rises abruptly on the north-west 
side of Las Tunas, however,things could hardly look more different 
<http://www.argentinaindependent.com/socialissues/las-tunas-nordelta-two-neighbourhoods-one-reality/>
.


In the early 1900s, Argentina’s commodity boom made it famous as a destination 
for immigrants with big dreams. Decades of economic instability would delay 
those dreams, but they never died. And in the 1960s, a new kind of 
neighbourhood appeared on the outskirts of Buenos Aires that would finally make 
these dreams come true: the gated community.


The capital’s suburbs presented a challenge: electricity and running water 
services were scarce, access to the city centre was difficult, and law 
enforcement was lax. When the new freeways of the 1960s effectively solved the 
transportation issue, private developers stepped in with a recipe that would 
make the city’s suburban dreams possible: new neighbourhoods built from 
scratch, with privately run water and power grids, private security forces, and 
high perimeter walls. These new neighbourhoods were dubbed “country clubs” – 
later shortened simply to “countries”.

part-Dubai, part-Anytown US. Photograph: Enrique Marcarian/Reuters 
The number of “countries” expanded steadily through the 1970s and 80s, then 
exploded in the 1990s. This development set the stage for Nordelta, which would 
take the concept to a new level; instead of being “just” another gated 
community, this would be an entire city built within concrete walls.

Nordelta was the brainchild of Eduardo Costantini 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31602942>. The Argentine real estate 
developer keeps a low profile; when asked about Nordelta, he generally prefers 
to change the subject to his art museum, the Museum of Latin American Art, in 
Buenos Aires’s Palermo neighbourhood. Recently one of his other creations, a
circular bridge in Uruguay’s Punta del Este 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/20/punta-del-este-uruguay-elitest-gated-city-urban-future-st-tropez-south-america>
, garnered him international attention.

Costantini conceived of the idea of Nordelta in 1992: it was to be 
part-Venice, part-Dubai, part-Anytown US. Luxury townhouses would be built on 
top of artificial islands surrounded by carefully sculpted lagoons. Families 
would be able to take their children to private schools, private health 
facilities and private recreation centres, all without leaving the 
development’s gates. Though construction took longer than expected and Nordelta 
opened piecemeal, starting in the late 1990s, it soon became an overwhelming 
success.


Perhaps just as significant are the changes Nordelta and other such 
communities have brought outside their walls. The area has become a surreal 
landscape of railroads, factories, working-class areas such as Las Tunas, and 
every so often, an ornate and heavily guarded entrance to a country.

Tunas residents. Photograph: Drew Reed 
Inside Nordelta, however, none of this impact on the outside world seems to 
register. Families have all they need to live the lives dreamt by their 
immigrant forebears. Urbanism researcher Michael Janoschka, in astudy he 
conducted of Nordelta <http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-146(121).htm>, was taken 
aback by the homogeneity of the social structure there.

“When I do these studies, I keep requesting interviews until each subject 
gives me the same information as the next,” he says. “In Nordelta, it didn’t 
take long for me to reach that point.”

Breaking down the wall

When they heard what was happening at the perimeter wall, Matías Duarte and 
his family resolved to wade through the knee-deep floodwaters to join the crowd 
that had gathered. They didn’t get very far before they were stopped by the 
sound of gunfire.

We broke the wall open and five minutes later, the floodwater washed away
Las Tunas resident 
Private guards in La Comarca, another gated community that borders Nordelta, 
had been alerted of the Las Tunas residents trying to break down the wall, and 
were firing warning shots. Provincial police soon arrived on the scene, and the 
crowd dispersed. But their goal had already been accomplished: they had made a 
hole in the wall to release floodwaters.


According to accounts published in local media 
<http://www.actualidaddetigre.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6959:las-tunas-existe-lo-que-las-lluvias-han-dejado&catid=45:sociales&Itemid=64>
 shortly after the flooding occurred, the wall was broken at 3.30am on 2 April. 
Amid torrential rains that would causemajor flooding and nearly 100 deaths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/05/argentinian-rescuers-search-bodies-floods>
 in central Buenos Aires and La Plata: “We broke the wall open and five minutes 
later, the floodwater washed away,” one resident remarked.


Rescue efforts were patchy and disorderly, however. Duarte says he later found 
out that, while Las Tunas was still covered in floodwaters, authorities had 
access to 10 rescue boats that were never used. “They never told us why they 
didn’t use those boats,” he says.

Word soon spread that a protest had been called to disrupt the nearby freeway, 
in an attempt to obtain a more substantial response from the city’s 
authorities. When Duarte’s family got there, they found it wasn’t just people 
from Las Tunas who were protesting: “We had people from Rojas, Palomar, and 
Rincón de Milberg come to the protest,” he says. “Their houses had flooded just 
like ours had. Everyone needed help, fast. And they weren’t getting any at all.”

The same freak storm that generated so much devastation in Las Tunas was 
hardly felt in Nordelta. No protest was organised, because none was needed. 
Many residents didn’t even wake up.


Patricia Pintos, a geographer at the National University of La Plata, doesn’t 
think this happened by accident. “Nordelta required an immense amount of 
hydrological engineering,” she says, noting that the development’s construction 
of artificially raised land and manmade lakes helps it to remain dry during 
floods.

But the construction of Nordelta and other countries on top of wetlands came 
at a price for Las Tunas and other low-lying areas near creeks and rivers – not 
least because the loss of these wetlands removes the area’s natural capacity to 
absorb floodwater.


“We’re seeing increased flooding in many different areas, especially 
north-west of Buenos Aires,” Pintos says. “There are many reasons for this, but 
it’s impossible not to conclude that the countries aren’t playing a part.” For 
Las Tunas, this is especially pronounced since thearroyo Las Tunas flows 
directly from Las Tunas into Nordelta.


Now, the only way anyone from Las Tunas sees the inside of Nordelta is by 
getting a job as cleaning staff
Matías ​Duarte 
And flooding is just one of a number of problems created by these walled-off 
neighbourhoods for people “on the other side”. The patchwork landscape they 
create makes travelling via public transport more difficult, and costly private 
utility systems make building public utilities to non-gated areas less 
economically viable.


Conscious of the problems it has created for Las Tunas, in 2001 Nordelta 
created aneponymous foundation 
<http://www.fundacionnordelta.org/es/#.Vuq3-owrKCQ> to provide aid and 
assistance to local residents. It offers regular classes, healthcare and 
emergency relief in the case of floods.

“We’ve participated actively in flood relief campaigns, and have been working 
with the city to provide more adequate services to the area,” says Luciana 
Silvestri, a representative with the Nordelta Foundation, adding that much of 
their support comes directly from residents of Nordelta.

But to become a more viable neighbourhood, Las Tunas needs effective public 
utilities that can only provided by the city government. Providing these 
services has not been a high priority for Tigre, the town in which both Las 
Tunas and Nordelta are located.

Tigre’s public works department has produced some piecemeal reforms in Las 
Tunas, includingshallow drainage ditches 
<http://www.tigre.gov.ar/noticias/mas-obras-de-limpieza-benefician-los-vecinos-de-las-tunas/>
 in the most flood prone areas. But officials flatly deny that gated 
communities are contributing to the problem.

“When I started working here decades ago, floods were far worse than they are 
now,” says Alberto Lacioppa, director of the infrastructure and networks 
division of the public works department. “The gated communities haven’t changed 
the situation at all. They are irrelevant.”

After the floods

Three years on from the flood, Duarte no longer lives in Las Tunas. But he 
comes back regularly, to help teach children in the neighbourhood, and to lend 
a hand wherever residents need help.


He’s quick to point out that the 2013 flood wasn’t an isolated incident. 
Significant flooding also occurred there in November 2014 and August 2015. When 
I arrive at the makeshift school where he and other volunteers teach, he shows 
me the mark left by floodwater on the school’s walls, distorting a mural 
painted by students.


He insists, too, on showing me the wall that had been broken down back in 
2013. Duarte tells me that when he was little, this spot used to be an open 
field where neighbourhood families would have picnics on weekends.

“When we first learned they were going to build this new neighbourhood 
[Nordelta], many of us were excited. Think of all the opportunities it would 
provide,” he tells me. “Now, the only way anyone from Las Tunas sees the inside 
of Nordelta is by getting a job as cleaning staff.”

Chalk'

A block onwards, we arrive at the arroyo Las Tunas, and the spot where the 
wall was broken down. It’s hard to tell anything ever happened here – the only 
indication is a new set of electrified wires, rising ominously above the 
concrete wall.

There is some hope, however, that relief for the floods that plague Las Tunas 
may be on the way. Argentina’s new centre right presidentMauricio Macri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/10/mauricio-macri-argentina-president-cristina-fernandez>
 has indicated that flood prevention is a high priority for his government.

Lacioppa believes that new government leaders at the federal and provincial 
levels will help his department to implement new reforms, including pumps and 
the widening of a railroad bridge that routinely blocks the flow of water.

But Janoschka is less optimistic. He feels that Macri’s government will 
unleash a glut of foreign capital, further carving up the landscape with little 
regard for those on the wrong side of the wall.


“You know, I used to think the only problem with this wall was the floods it 
caused,” Duarte says as we walk back home. “But the more I thought about it, 
the more I started asking myself, ‘What purpose does this wall really serve? 
Wouldn’t we all be better off without it?’”
