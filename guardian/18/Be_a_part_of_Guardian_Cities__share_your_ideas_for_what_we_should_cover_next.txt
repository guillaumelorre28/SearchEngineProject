Two years ago, we launched the Guardian Cities website with a series of reports
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jan/27/disaster-cities-tragedy-strikes-homes-communities>
 from six cities that had all been hit hard by natural disaster. We wanted to 
understand how their residents had responded to the crisis, and how 
successfully, or not, the cities had recovered.

It was the start of a fascinating learning curve for everyone connected with 
this site. Since then, we’ve reported on countless projects in cities in every 
corner of the planet – from aninspirational hip-hop crew in Dharavi

 to atransformative community centre in one of Mexico City’s most violent 
suburbs

. Throughout, our aim has been to listen to the people who know best: those who 
live and work in each city we visit and report on.

And that, of course, also means listening carefully to our readers all over 
the world. Among much else, you have alreadyhelped us map the African city of 
Baraka in DRC

, andshared stories of London’s housing crisis

 that appeared on billboards across the city. Every day, you keep us better 
informed and entertained with your contributions about the cities you love – 
and loathe.

Now, as we enter our third year, we’d like you to have even more of an input 
into the stories we cover, and the people and projects we profile. Wherever you 
are in the world, please take a moment to share your thoughts, ideas and 
suggestions using the form below.

We will read all the responses, and act on as many of them as possible. You 
can, of course, keep abreast of all our stories, and tell us what you think of 
them, onTwitter 
<https://twitter.com/guardiancities?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor>
 andFacebook <https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities/> too.

Above all, we want Guardian Cities to be a place for people who care about the 
future of cities to share their stories. Thank you for being part of it.
