The WRU head of rugby performance, Geraint John, said: “Ben Ryan’s appointment 
is a real coup for Welsh rugby. He is a much sought-after high performance 
coach, who has been courted around the globe since his significant successes 
with the Fijian national sevens side.”

Peter Drewett is the WRU’s new performance coach manager. He will move from a 
similar position with the Hong Kong Rugby Union on 1 March.
