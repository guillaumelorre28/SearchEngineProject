Labour’s Louise Ellman says patients cannot be discharged because of cuts to 
social care. Why is the government blaming MPs?

May says there is pressure on social care. She quotes the extra money going to 
Liverpool, where Ellman is an MP.

Juncker opens press conference in Brussels

Mark Smith

Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has started his press 
conference in Brussels.
 Jean-Claude Juncker. 
He is joined by the new European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, and the 
Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, who said earlier that Brexit 
negotiations would be an “arduous task” and “not a happy event” for the former 
British colony.


It will be interesting to see whether Juncker will adopt a similarly regretful 
tone to Muscat, or seek to meet Theresa May’s tough rhetoric yesterday head-on. 
He’s already been speaking today of course, to the European parliament, where 
revealed he had told May last night that one speech “will not launch the 
negotiations”.

The Guardian’s Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin is following the press 
conference and will file snap reaction.

in a white paper so MPs can debate them.

May says she understands this point. It continues to be the government’s

Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP, asks if May will attend a meeting to oppose 
the closure of a Mitcham surgery. Or is she happy to oversee the collapse of 
the NHS on her watch.

May says she used to sit on Wimbledon council with McDonagh. There are 5,000 
more GPs coming into the NHs, she says. But she wants to ensure they provide 
services at the times when patients want to come.

The Labour MP Barry Sheerman says there are dark clouds looming, in terms of 
intolerance and racism acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. Are we fit for purpose on this 
issue?

May says she wants UN to be able to do the job it needs to do. And she says 
the government will continue to support Nato. The main thrust of her speech 
yesterday as about how the UK wants a strong partnership with the EU. Now is 
not a time to cooperate less; it’s a time to cooperate more.

Snap PMQs verdict

Snap PMQs verdict: Perhaps Corbyn should stick to the NHS. Of course, that 
wasn’t really an option today, in the light of the huge interest in May’s 
Brexit speech, but having done well on health and social care in recent PMQs he 
today came slightly unstuck when he tried to dismantle her speech with six 
questions all focused onEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. 
His point about May snubbing parliament was true, but a process point of little 
interest to people outside Westminster, and his “irony” lady line was 
groan-inducing (He should just have nicked the line that Labour MP Stephen 
Doughty used yesterday about May and how “the lady’s not for turning up”.) His 
point about corporation tax and May’s threat to turn the UK into a offshore tax 
haven was a good one, but then he got sidelined into slightly obtuse questions 
about payments to the EU, where May’s reply (there will be payments for single 
market access, even if she is not saying how much they will be) was unusually 
direct by PMQs standards. May seemed more confident than at previous PMQs, and 
her mockery of Corbyn’s response to her speech yesterday was effective. She 
will be satisfied that that she saw Corbyn off.

Corbyn says his question was about paying for access to the single market. May 
still has not answered. Does May agree with her minister who said employers 
could still have access to cheap foreign labour.

May says she is talking about payments to secure access to the single market.

Corbyn says he wanted to know how much we would pay. Still no answer, he says. 
He says there are 55,000 EU citizens working in the NHS. There are 80,000 care 
workers, and 5,000 teachers from the EU. The real pressure is coming from cuts. 
Instead of threatening to turn Britain into an off-shore tax haven, let’s fund 
public services properly.

May says there will still be people coming to the UK from the EU after Brexit. 
There is a difference between them, she says. When she looks at an issue like 
Brexit, she considers the issue, sets out a plan and sticks to it. It’s called 
leadership. He should try it.

Corbyn says reducing corporation tax would cost the country £120bn. How do you 
fund public services without that. May said in April that leaving the EU would 
create the risk of the UK not being able to get better trade deals. Does May 
now disagree with herself?

May says she also said that the sky would not fall in if we left. Corbyn wants 
no controls on immigration and to borrow an extra £500bn. That would lead to no 
jobs.

Corbyn says May talked about frictionless access to the single market. Has she 
ruled out any kind of access fee for the single market.

May says this is exactly what she was talking about in her speech. The point 
about frictionless access was about borders, she says.

Labour’s Louise Ellman says patients cannot be discharged because of cuts to 
social care. Why is the government blaming MPs?

May says there is pressure on social care. She quotes the extra money going to 
Liverpool, where Ellman is an MP.
 
Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has started his press 
conference in Brussels.
 Jean-Claude Juncker. 
He is joined by the new European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, and the 
Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, who said earlier that Brexit 
negotiations would be an “arduous task” and “not a happy event” for the former 
British colony.


It will be interesting to see whether Juncker will adopt a similarly regretful 
tone to Muscat, or seek to meet Theresa May’s tough rhetoric yesterday head-on. 
He’s already been speaking today of course, to the European parliament, where 
revealed he had told May last night that one speech “will not launch the 
negotiations”.

The Guardian’s Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin is following the press 
conference and will file snap reaction.
 
The Conservative MP Anna Soubry asks if May will publish her Brexit principles 
in a white paper so MPs can debate them.

May says she understands this point. It continues to be the government’s 
intention to provide clarity wherever it can.
 
Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP, asks if May will attend a meeting to oppose 
the closure of a Mitcham surgery. Or is she happy to oversee the collapse of 
the NHS on her watch.

May says she used to sit on Wimbledon council with McDonagh. There are 5,000 
more GPs coming into the NHs, she says. But she wants to ensure they provide 
services at the times when patients want to come.
 
Paul Scully, a Conservative, asks about the rail strike.

May says she hopes the talks will lead to the strikes being called off.
 
The Labour MP Barry Sheerman says there are dark clouds looming, in terms of 
intolerance and racism acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. Are we fit for purpose on this 
issue?

May says she wants UN to be able to do the job it needs to do. And she says 
the government will continue to support Nato. The main thrust of her speech 
yesterday as about how the UK wants a strong partnership with the EU. Now is 
not a time to cooperate less; it’s a time to cooperate more.
 
The Conservative MP Andrew Selous asks about air quality. Will May remove all 
diesel cars from the government car pool?

May says the government car service is working to remove diesel cars from its 
fleet.

questions all focused onEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. 
His point about May snubbing parliament was true, but a process point of little 
interest to people outside Westminster, and his “irony” lady line was 
groan-inducing (He should just have nicked the line that Labour MP Stephen 
Doughty used yesterday about May and how “the lady’s not for turning up”.) His 
point about corporation tax and May’s threat to turn the UK into a offshore tax 
haven was a good one, but then he got sidelined into slightly obtuse questions 
about payments to the EU, where May’s reply (there will be payments for single 
market access, even if she is not saying how much they will be) was unusually 
direct by PMQs standards. May seemed more confident than at previous PMQs, and 
her mockery of Corbyn’s response to her speech yesterday was effective. She 
will be satisfied that that she saw Corbyn off.
 
Corbyn says his question was about paying for access to the single market. May 
still has not answered. Does May agree with her minister who said employers 
could still have access to cheap foreign labour.

May says she is talking about payments to secure access to the single market.

Corbyn says he wanted to know how much we would pay. Still no answer, he says. 
He says there are 55,000 EU citizens working in the NHS. There are 80,000 care 
workers, and 5,000 teachers from the EU. The real pressure is coming from cuts. 
Instead of threatening to turn Britain into an off-shore tax haven, let’s fund 
public services properly.

May says there will still be people coming to the UK from the EU after Brexit. 
There is a difference between them, she says. When she looks at an issue like 
Brexit, she considers the issue, sets out a plan and sticks to it. It’s called 
leadership. He should try it.
 
Corbyn says reducing corporation tax would cost the country £120bn. How do you 
fund public services without that. May said in April that leaving the EU would 
create the risk of the UK not being able to get better trade deals. Does May 
now disagree with herself?

May says she also said that the sky would not fall in if we left. Corbyn wants 
no controls on immigration and to borrow an extra £500bn. That would lead to no 
jobs.

Corbyn says May talked about frictionless access to the single market. Has she 
ruled out any kind of access fee for the single market.

May says this is exactly what she was talking about in her speech. The point 
about frictionless access was about borders, she says.
