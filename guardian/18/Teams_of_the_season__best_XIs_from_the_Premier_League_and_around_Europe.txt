Heurelho Gomes: goalkeeper – 7.07

While Watford’s season may have ended in a disappointing fashion, they secured 
their goal of survival with months to spare. No player contributed in a more 
significant way throughout the campaign for Quique Sanchez Flores’ side than 
Heurelho Gomes, who produced more saves than any other goalkeeper in the league 
(120), boasting the fourth best save success rate of those to make at least 20 
appearances (71.6%).

Cédric Soares: right-back – 7.27

He may not have drawn too many plaudits but Cédric Soares enjoyed a fine debut 
season with Southampton to just pip Héctor Bellerín to a place in our team of 
the season. The Portugal international ranked among the league’s top 20 players 
in terms of tackles per game (three) and, of the full-backs to make at least 20 
appearances, he was fourth for chances created per game (1.1) and third for 
accurate crosses per game (1.3).

Virgil van Dijk: centre-back – 7.56

Another real hit on the south coast, Virgil van Dijk made the switch from 
north of the border with consummate ease and became a colossus for Southampton 
for much of the season. The Dutchman placed fourth in the entire league in 
terms of total clearances (260) and third for aerial duels won, with his tally 
of 163 making him the highest placed centre-back. He also scored three goals in 
a superb first season with Southampton.

Laurent Koscielny: centre-back DC - 7.48

Going one better than Van Dijk in terms of hitting the back of the net from 
defence, Koscielny scored four and was behind only Scott Dann in terms of 
goalscoring centre-backs. The Frenchman’s tally of 127 interceptions ranked 
third in the league and was much higher than any other player in his position. 
Arsenal struggled during his five-game absence, winning just two of those 
matches.

Christian Fuchs: left-back – 7.50

Another defender who proved to be an outstanding acquisition last summer, 
Christian Fuchs had to wait for his chance in the Leicester team but boy did he 
grab it with both hands. The Austrian created the third most chances of any 
defender in the league in their title winning campaign (45), registering four 
assists, as well as ranking among the top 10 players in the division for 
interceptions per game (1.3).

Riyad Mahrez: right midfield – 7.84

Securing the highest rating of any player, Riyad Mahrez was a worthy winner of 
thePFA Player of the Year award 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/25/riyad-mahrez-leicester-premier-league-pfa-player-of-the-year>
. The Algerian placed among the league’s top five players for both goals (17) 
and assists (11), ending the campaign as the only player to register double 
figures in both. With the 25-year old also topping the league in terms of 
successful dribbles (131), he may well be in high demand this summer.

Mousa Dembélé: central midfield – 7.69

Although his season ended in disgrace when he received a six-game ban for 
poking Diego Costa’s eye 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/tottenham-mousa-dembele-six-game-ban-diego-costa>
, Mousa Dembélé was at his very best in Spurs’ title bid. The Belgian ended the 
campaign on the losing side just once in his 29 appearances, with that defeat 
coming on the opening day of the season when fielded on the right against 
Manchester United. Of all players the players in the league who attempted at 
least 50 dribbles, Dembélé boasted the best success rate in any of Europe’s top 
five leagues (92.2%). He also excelled defensively, placing fourth in the 
Premier League for tackles per game (3.6).

Mesut Özil: central midfield – 7.66

His form tailed off in the second half of the season, but Özil was at his 
creative best to register 19 assists – the most of any player in Europe’s top 
five leagues. His tally of 146 chances created was 27 more than any other 
player in thePremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>
, while the 27-year-old delivered the second most accurate crosses (92), 
meaning he just edged out N’Golo Kanté (7.61 rating) in our best XI.

Dimitri Payet: left midfield – 7.74

Trading places with Ozil for key passes and crosses, Payet ranked first in the 
league for the latter (94) and was the German’s closest challenger in terms of 
the former, creating 119 chances. His ability to pick out a teammate saw the 
Frenchman finish the campaign with the joint-third most assists (12), with 9 
goals and 2.2 dribbles per game helping Payet become an instant icon for West 
Ham, undoubtedly in the running for signing of the season.

Harry Kane: forward - 7.53

Although the season ended in heartache for Spurs, Harry Kane will no doubt 
have been delighted to end the 2015-16 campaign as the Premier League’s top 
scorer with 25 goals. The England international tested the opposition keeper 
with at least 22 more shots than any other player in the top flight (75) and 
was one of only five outfield players to start every league game for his club.

Jamie Vardy: forward – 7.51

He may have finished second in the scoring charts – just one behind his 
England team-mate Harry Kane – but Jamie Vardy ends the campaign as the 
happiest striker in the land without question. The 29-year-old had a simply 
remarkable season, with six assists meaning he had a direct hand in more goals 
than any other player (30), with his rise through the leagues seemingly proving 
to be the stuff of whichHollywood films are made
