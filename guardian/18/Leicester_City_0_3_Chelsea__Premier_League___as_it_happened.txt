Full time: Leicester 0-3 Chelsea

That was just brilliant from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>. They ignored all the pressure 
that other people felt they were under and calmly took Leicester apart with 
some clinical attacking football. They have restored their seven-point lead and 
made their player of the season so far, Diego Costa, look dispensable. Thanks 
for your company; night.

80 min “It’s often asserted by pundits (though not evidenced, natch) that “You 
don’t become a bad player overnight”,” says Gary Naylor. “But some players do, 
don’t they? A bit of pace is lost, opponents work out how to neutralise them 
and the confidence inexorably drifts away. Is this what’s happened collectively 
at Leicester City - at least inPremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> matches?”

You could certainly make that case with Vardy – teams have played him much 
better – but generally I think it’s a psychological issue. They had nowhere to 
go after last season, and that has led to a small but significant drop in their 
motivation and level of performance. The fact they are doing so well in Europe 
supports this admittedly half-arsed hypothesis.

77 min Unless Liverpool win at Old Trafford tomorrow, Chelsea will be seven 
points clear with 17 games to go. In a league where the top six will all take 
points off each other, that’s a huge lead. Their next three games are Hull (H), 
Liverpool (A) and Arsenal (H). If they take seven points from those matches 
they will almost be champions because an Antonio Conte side is not going to 
drop many points against the smaller teams

GOAL! Leicester 0-3 Chelsea (Pedro 71)

It’s certainly over now. Pedro starts and finishes the move to put Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> 3-0 ahead. Kante played a short 
pass into Pedro on the edge of the box; he produced a spectacular no-look 
pirouette backheel to put Willian clear on the right of the box. Schmeichel 
came out, Willian dinked the ball over him, and Pedro headed the loose ball 
past Morgan on the line. I think Willian was fractionally offside but well, who 
cares.

Spurs this morning, but in the circumstances this has arguably been an even 
better performance. Their team spirit is a reality glimpsed on the cusp of 
their 14th victory in 15 league games. Imagine how good it must be to play for 
Antonio Conte. He could make Wayne Slob volunteer for a marathon.

64 min Oh my goodness! Alonso is this close to a hat-trick. Moses lifted a 
deep, swirling cross to the edge of the box, where his fellow wing-back Alonso 
watched the ball so carefully onto his left foot before swishing a brilliant 
volley that flew fractionally wide of the far post with Schmeichel beaten. That 
was beautiful technique.

62 min We are entering the age of the acrobatic volley. Andy Carroll scored 
one today, and now Gary Cahill tries his luck. After a corner was headed up in 
the air, Cahill produced an elegant overhead kick that hit Morgan and went 
behind for a corner. It did hit Morgan’s arm but it was in front of his chest 
so there was no real appeal for a penalty.

58 min A bit of action at both ends. Albrighton, anticipating a tackle from 
Alonso that never comes, falls over. No penalty. Then Hazard gets one v one in 
the box against Morgan, who does brilliantly to force him wide and ensure he 
can’t get a shot in.

53 min “How’s the alcohol-free year going?” asks Wilson Beuys. “I’ve had 
occasion myself to skip the good stuff, and I usually find after about two 
weeks the thought of drinking again seems strangely... almostdirty. As if it 
would sully my now-pure body. The longest I’ve ever managed was three months, 
and that was an illness + treatment = no alcohol thing, so speaking as someone 
who enjoys getting outside a tall glass of something with a bit of kick, I take 
my beret off to you.”

I wouldn’t take it off yet: it’s only been two weeks. That said, it’s amusing 
how quickly you can ascend the moral high ground. I went to the cinema on 
Tuesday and everyone was supping cocktails and red wine and generally enjoying 
life. I sneered as I savoured a room-temperature Strathmore. All those losers 
on the piss again.

Morgan and took a second deflection off the studs of Drinkwater, who knew 
nothing about it, before zipping past Schmeichel.

GOAL! Leicester 0-2 Chelsea (Alonso 51)

The free-kick for that Fuchs foul leads to a second goal for Marcos Alonso. It 
flashed across the box and was headed clear to Alonso in the D. He controlled 
it and drove a shot that took a double deflection off Morgan - it hit both 
pads, in cricket parlance - and wrongfooted Schmeichel.

48 min Chelsea have started the second half strongly, as they did the first. 
There was a lot of hot air from Leicester in the first half, plenty of it 
admirable, but ultimately Courtois didn’t have that much to do.

47 min “Hi Rob,” says James Calder. “What do you make of Ndidi so far? He’s 
hardly a Mahrez-style steal at 15m quid but he looks like a longer-legged 
version of Kante. He can obviously pick a pass too.”

It sounds stupid but when you do an MBM you don’t really get a sense of how 
good a player is – you’re so busy panicking and typing and looking at emails 
and panicking, so you only really pick up on the highlights. But I do remember 
one gorgeous crossfield pass, driven all along the floor to Drinkwater, and one 
really good tackle at a time when Leicester were bullyingChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> a bit. The co-commentator Owen 
Hargreaves had said plenty of nice things about him, and his judgement of a 
player is extremely good.

On reflection, I’m not sure Alonso was offside for the goal - it looked like a

“Hi Rob,” says Raymond Reardon. “It’s the Russians interfering with the 
Guardian’s live MBM blogs that has caused multiple entries on 
screens.....something about doubling up on electoral votes or something.”

The Russians? They’re not all bad.

Half-time chit-chat

“Only for the record: Marcos Alonso was offside when Hazard played him, by the 
same (very narrow) margin as Mata v. Hull earlier this week,” says Zoltan 
Toszegi. “(But I do agree with bias for the attacking team.)”

Oh crikey, I missed that. There have been a few such incidents lately, though 
overall you have to say assistant refereeing has improved ever so slightly.

Half time: Leicester 0-1 Chelsea

Peep peep! Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> just about 
deserve to lead in a good if relatively uneventful game. Marcos Alonso’s classy 
early goal is the difference at the moment. See you in 10 minutes for more fun 
and games.

43 min Pedro misses an excellent chance to make it 2-0. It came from a 
training-ground free-kick, with David Luiz dummying to shoot before fizzing the 
ball into Hazard in the D. He played it first time through to Pedro, who sliced 
a left-footed shot high and wide from 15 yards. It was slightly behind him but 
he will still feel he should have troubled the officialPremier League

42 min Courtois has dealt assertively with Fuchs’ long throws all night, and 
there’s another example. He is so impressive - and he’s still only 24, which is 
ridiculous given how good he is and what he has achieved. His quiet authority 
is a little reminiscent of Peter Shilton.

36 min Chelsea are such a hard team to get through in central positions, with 
essentially five central defensive players - two in midfield and three at the 
back. All the more reason to give the ball to Albrighton and put a few crosses 
in. Just as I’m typing this guff, Vardy spins Cahill on the right wing and puts 
in a really dangerous low cross with his left foot. David Luiz stretches at the 
near post but then pulls his foot away, fearing an own goal, and Courtois 
reacts superbly to palm it clear.

things down after that little Albrighton assault, and at the moment there is a 
sense of stalemate in the pattern of play, if not the actual score.

live blogging, if indeed an offer from China that was too good to resist came 
your way, you could go for a season and if it didn’t work out the Guardian 
would always take you back. ‘It was like live blogging in a foreign country’ 
etc etc.”

It was a shock to the system: I always thought football was a universal 
language, etc. Also, you’ve confused Ian Rush with Carl Leaburn.

22 min Another beautiful right-wing delivery from Albrighton is cushioned by 
Matic and headed behind by Cahill. Nothing comes from the corner. Leicester 
should give the ball to Albrighton at every opportunity because, as Owen 
Hargreaves says on BT, he is putting on a clinic in how to cross a ball.

21 min Leicester have started to come into this game. Drinkwater’s dangerous 
cross is volleyed off Moses by David Luiz, who was trying to put it behind for 
a corner I think. That could have gone anywhere but luckily forChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> it ricocheted to safety.

17 min This is better from Leicester. Drinkwater harasses Alonso and finds 
Albrighton, who lifts a fine cross towards the middle of the six-yard line. 
Chilwell leaps above Moses and flicks a header well wide of the far post. Moses 
did enough to make it difficult for Chilwell, who had to stretch to make 
contact and couldn’t get enough on the ball as a result.

Hello China, nice to hear from you. I suppose my view would be that, well, 
China are certainly looking to develop their football, looking at their 
signings and their recruitment. If an opportunity came along I am contracted to 
the Guardian but I have to look at my long-term strategy of my career. How long 
can I last as a liveblogger? I have been at the Guardian 13 years. It’s been a 
wonderful 13 years. There is no offer on the table but if they made an offer it 
would be under consideration. But at the moment I still enjoy working for the 
Guardian.

8 min That Musa shot aside, this has been an outstandingly authoritative start 
fromChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> - so much so that it 
can only be a matter of minutes before the words “Diego Who?” are uttered in 
the banter style.

The goal came from a right-wing cross by Azpilicueta, which bounced around the 
box before falling to Hazard eight yards from goal. He showed superb awareness 
to ignore the shot, which Morgan would have blocked, and tee up Alonso with a 
calm square pass. It invited - demanded - a first-time shot and Alonso wrapped 
his right foot around the ball to belt a curler past Schmeichel. That was an 
excellent finish and a superb assist from Hazard: 99.94 per cent of players 
would have had a shot in that situation.

their signings and their recruitment. If an opportunity came along I am 
contracted to the Guardian but I have to look at my long-term strategy of my 
career. How long can I last as a liveblogger? I have been at the Guardian 13 
years. It’s been a wonderful 13 years. There is no offer on the table but if 
they made an offer it would be under consideration. But at the moment I still 
enjoy working for the Guardian.

We’re having technical problems, and for once that’s not a euphemism. 
Apologies if you’ve had multiple posts inflicted on you. We’re working on it. I 
say ‘we’, I’m doing bugger all as I have no idea how to fix it. But somebody, 
somewhere is on the case.

Preamble

Hello. Chelsea are in crisis: they’ve lost their last one Premier League 
games, their most important player wants to go toChina and their lead at the 
top is down tofour points. We jest, of course, but you know how it is in modern 
football: thePremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>
 Crisis Baton has been transported to the King Power Stadium, ready to be 
handed over at the final whistle if necessary.

Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> will play 38 league 
games this season; this feels like one of the most significant. If they display 
their usual defiance and win, they go seven points clear and quieten the 
burgeoning hysteria. If they lose, the back pages will be theirs for the next 
few days, and their next few league fixtures - Hull, Liverpool, Arsenal - will 
look fraught with peril.

Kick off is at 5.30pm.

That was just brilliant from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>. They ignored all the pressure 
that other people felt they were under and calmly took Leicester apart with 
some clinical attacking football. They have restored their seven-point lead and 
made their player of the season so far, Diego Costa, look dispensable. Thanks 
for your company; night.

Chelsea bandwagon rolls on as Marcos Alonso double sees off Leicester

 Chelsea manager Antonio Conte celebrates after the final whistle. Photograph: 
Tom Jenkins for the Guardian  
90 min There will be a bit of added time, nobody really cares how much.
 
87 min Fuchs’ acrobatic hooked shot from the edge of the area is comfortably 
held by Courtois.
 
84 min A double Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> change: 
Loftus-Cheek and Batshuayi on for the excellent pair of Willian and Pedro.
 
83 min Moses fails to get a penalty with a dive in the box. But would he have 
done it if he wasn’t exposed to foreigners every day?
 
80 min “It’s often asserted by pundits (though not evidenced, natch) that “You 
don’t become a bad player overnight”,” says Gary Naylor. “But some players do, 
don’t they? A bit of pace is lost, opponents work out how to neutralise them 
and the confidence inexorably drifts away. Is this what’s happened collectively 
at Leicester City - at least inPremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> matches?”

You could certainly make that case with Vardy – teams have played him much 
better – but generally I think it’s a psychological issue. They had nowhere to 
go after last season, and that has led to a small but significant drop in their 
motivation and level of performance. The fact they are doing so well in Europe 
supports this admittedly half-arsed hypothesis.
 
79 min The game is starting to wind down. Eden Hazard, who gave a performance 
of routine genius, is replaced by Cesc Fabregas. His touch for the first goal 
was just brilliant.
 
77 min Unless Liverpool win at Old Trafford tomorrow, Chelsea will be seven 
points clear with 17 games to go. In a league where the top six will all take 
points off each other, that’s a huge lead. Their next three games are Hull (H), 
Liverpool (A) and Arsenal (H). If they take seven points from those matches 
they will almost be champions because an Antonio Conte side is not going to 
drop many points against the smaller teams 
<http://www.statto.com/football/teams/chelsea>.
 
76 min Albrighton is replaced by Danny Simpson for Leicester.
 
72 min Another Leicester substitution: Gray replaces the anonymous Musa.
 
It’s certainly over now. Pedro starts and finishes the move to put Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> 3-0 ahead. Kante played a short 
pass into Pedro on the edge of the box; he produced a spectacular no-look 
pirouette backheel to put Willian clear on the right of the box. Schmeichel 
came out, Willian dinked the ball over him, and Pedro headed the loose ball 
past Morgan on the line. I think Willian was fractionally offside but well, who 
cares.

 Then celebrates with Willian. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins for the 
Guardian  Before being mobbed by his Chelsea team-mates. Photograph: Tom 
Jenkins for the Guardian  
69 min This game is over. Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> have not been spectacular like 
Spurs this morning, but in the circumstances this has arguably been an even 
better performance. Their team spirit is a reality glimpsed on the cusp of 
their 14th victory in 15 league games. Imagine how good it must be to play for 
Antonio Conte. He could make Wayne Slob volunteer for a marathon.
 
66 min Who was the last full-back or wing-back to score a hat-trick in the 
English top flight? Steve Nicol at Newcastle on Sunday 20 September 1987?
 
64 min Oh my goodness! Alonso is this close to a hat-trick. Moses lifted a 
deep, swirling cross to the edge of the box, where his fellow wing-back Alonso 
watched the ball so carefully onto his left foot before swishing a brilliant 
volley that flew fractionally wide of the far post with Schmeichel beaten. That 
was beautiful technique.
 
62 min We are entering the age of the acrobatic volley. Andy Carroll scored 
one today, and now Gary Cahill tries his luck. After a corner was headed up in 
the air, Cahill produced an elegant overhead kick that hit Morgan and went 
behind for a corner. It did hit Morgan’s arm but it was in front of his chest 
so there was no real appeal for a penalty.

Guardian  
61 min This has been such an impressive performance from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>. They have so much mental 
strength, much of which comes from their magnificent manager.

 
60 min A Leicester substitution: Shinji Okazaki replaces Robert Huth.
 
58 min A bit of action at both ends. Albrighton, anticipating a tackle from 
Alonso that never comes, falls over. No penalty. Then Hazard gets one v one in 
the box against Morgan, who does brilliantly to force him wide and ensure he 
can’t get a shot in.
 Eden Hazard is thwarted by Wes Morgan. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the 
Guardian  
54 min Alonso has scored in the sixth minute of each half. Diego 
Who?!?!?!?!?!?!
 
53 min “How’s the alcohol-free year going?” asks Wilson Beuys. “I’ve had 
occasion myself to skip the good stuff, and I usually find after about two 
weeks the thought of drinking again seems strangely... almostdirty. As if it 
would sully my now-pure body. The longest I’ve ever managed was three months, 
and that was an illness + treatment = no alcohol thing, so speaking as someone 
who enjoys getting outside a tall glass of something with a bit of kick, I take 
my beret off to you.”

I wouldn’t take it off yet: it’s only been two weeks. That said, it’s amusing 
how quickly you can ascend the moral high ground. I went to the cinema on 
Tuesday and everyone was supping cocktails and red wine and generally enjoying 
life. I sneered as I savoured a room-temperature Strathmore. All those losers 
on the piss again.
 
52 min Replays show that it didn’t hit both Morgan’s legs - it deviated off 
Morgan and took a second deflection off the studs of Drinkwater, who knew 
nothing about it, before zipping past Schmeichel.
 
The free-kick for that Fuchs foul leads to a second goal for Marcos Alonso. It 
flashed across the box and was headed clear to Alonso in the D. He controlled 
it and drove a shot that took a double deflection off Morgan - it hit both 
pads, in cricket parlance - and wrongfooted Schmeichel.

50 min Fuchs is booked for pulling Willian back in plain sight.
 
48 min Chelsea have started the second half strongly, as they did the first. 
There was a lot of hot air from Leicester in the first half, plenty of it 
admirable, but ultimately Courtois didn’t have that much to do.
 
47 min PS: if you are feeling generou 
<https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/jimbob96>s. (And thanks ever so much to 
those who have donated already.)
 
47 min “Hi Rob,” says James Calder. “What do you make of Ndidi so far? He’s 
hardly a Mahrez-style steal at 15m quid but he looks like a longer-legged 
version of Kante. He can obviously pick a pass too.”

It sounds stupid but when you do an MBM you don’t really get a sense of how 
good a player is – you’re so busy panicking and typing and looking at emails 
and panicking, so you only really pick up on the highlights. But I do remember 
one gorgeous crossfield pass, driven all along the floor to Drinkwater, and one 
really good tackle at a time when Leicester were bullyingChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> a bit. The co-commentator Owen 
Hargreaves had said plenty of nice things about him, and his judgement of a 
player is extremely good.
 
46 min Peep peep! 
 
On reflection, I’m not sure Alonso was offside for the goal - it looked like a 
square pass from Hazard.
 
“Hi Rob,” says Raymond Reardon. “It’s the Russians interfering with the 
Guardian’s live MBM blogs that has caused multiple entries on 
screens.....something about doubling up on electoral votes or something.”

The Russians? They’re not all bad.
 
Half-time chit-chat

“Only for the record: Marcos Alonso was offside when Hazard played him, by the 
same (very narrow) margin as Mata v. Hull earlier this week,” says Zoltan 
Toszegi. “(But I do agree with bias for the attacking team.)”

Oh crikey, I missed that. There have been a few such incidents lately, though 
overall you have to say assistant refereeing has improved ever so slightly.
 
Half-time reading

In defence of the 48-team World Cup

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/99-94-cricket-blog/2017/jan/14/48-team-world-cup-defence-fifa> 
Peep peep! Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> just about 
deserve to lead in a good if relatively uneventful game. Marcos Alonso’s classy 
early goal is the difference at the moment. See you in 10 minutes for more fun 
and games.
 
43 min Pedro misses an excellent chance to make it 2-0. It came from a 
training-ground free-kick, with David Luiz dummying to shoot before fizzing the 
ball into Hazard in the D. He played it first time through to Pedro, who sliced 
a left-footed shot high and wide from 15 yards. It was slightly behind him but 
he will still feel he should have troubled the officialPremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> Shots on Target 
Statistician.
 
42 min Courtois has dealt assertively with Fuchs’ long throws all night, and 
there’s another example. He is so impressive - and he’s still only 24, which is 
ridiculous given how good he is and what he has achieved. His quiet authority 
is a little reminiscent of Peter Shilton.

high ball. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA  
39 min Just to reiterate: if it stays like this, crisis club Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> will be seven points clear and 
on a run of 14 wins in 15 league games.
 
36 min Chelsea are such a hard team to get through in central positions, with 
essentially five central defensive players - two in midfield and three at the 
back. All the more reason to give the ball to Albrighton and put a few crosses 
in. Just as I’m typing this guff, Vardy spins Cahill on the right wing and puts 
in a really dangerous low cross with his left foot. David Luiz stretches at the 
near post but then pulls his foot away, fearing an own goal, and Courtois 
reacts superbly to palm it clear.
 
33 min “Quite clear where Leicester have been going wrong this season,” says 
Adam Hirst. “They just don’t have the same quality pitch, like a poor photocopy 
of 2015-16 
<http://www.westminsterstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Westminster-Stone-LCFC-Pitch-Blog-06.jpg>
.
 
32 min Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> have calmed 
things down after that little Albrighton assault, and at the moment there is a 
sense of stalemate in the pattern of play, if not the actual score.
 
30 min Hazard plays a one-two with Kante and is clattered firmly but fairly by 
Huth in the box. He is such a threat as a No9, especially away from home.
 
26 min This is so much better from Leicester, who have started to bully Chelsea
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> a little bit, particularly in 
midfield.

24 min “Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Seeing as you’re the Ian Rush of 
live blogging, if indeed an offer from China that was too good to resist came 
your way, you could go for a season and if it didn’t work out the Guardian 
would always take you back. ‘It was like live blogging in a foreign country’ 
etc etc.”

It was a shock to the system: I always thought football was a universal 
language, etc. Also, you’ve confused Ian Rush with Carl Leaburn.
 
22 min Another beautiful right-wing delivery from Albrighton is cushioned by 
Matic and headed behind by Cahill. Nothing comes from the corner. Leicester 
should give the ball to Albrighton at every opportunity because, as Owen 
Hargreaves says on BT, he is putting on a clinic in how to cross a ball.
 
21 min Leicester have started to come into this game. Drinkwater’s dangerous 
cross is volleyed off Moses by David Luiz, who was trying to put it behind for 
a corner I think. That could have gone anywhere but luckily forChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> it ricocheted to safety.
 
18 min That first Albrighton pass was similar to this one from David Beckham, 
except from an even deeper position.
 
17 min This is better from Leicester. Drinkwater harasses Alonso and finds 
Albrighton, who lifts a fine cross towards the middle of the six-yard line. 
Chilwell leaps above Moses and flicks a header well wide of the far post. Moses 
did enough to make it difficult for Chilwell, who had to stretch to make 
contact and couldn’t get enough on the ball as a result.
 
16 min Albrighton, just inside his own half on the touchline, plays a 
magnificent curling pass around theChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> defence that just eludes Vardy 
in the box.
 
12 min Leicester are diligently defending their one-goal deficit, sitting deep 
and trying to play on the counter. A secondChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> goal looks far more likely at 
the moment.
 
10 min “China here,” says Ian Copestake. “How much would it take for you to 
not publish emails from your mate Copestake?”

Hello China, nice to hear from you. I suppose my view would be that, well, 
China are certainly looking to develop their football, looking at their 
signings and their recruitment. If an opportunity came along I am contracted to 
the Guardian but I have to look at my long-term strategy of my career. How long 
can I last as a liveblogger? I have been at the Guardian 13 years. It’s been a 
wonderful 13 years. There is no offer on the table but if they made an offer it 
would be under consideration. But at the moment I still enjoy working for the 
Guardian.

8 min That Musa shot aside, this has been an outstandingly authoritative start 
fromChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> - so much so that it 
can only be a matter of minutes before the words “Diego Who?” are uttered in 
the banter style.
 
The goal came from a right-wing cross by Azpilicueta, which bounced around the 
box before falling to Hazard eight yards from goal. He showed superb awareness 
to ignore the shot, which Morgan would have blocked, and tee up Alonso with a 
calm square pass. It invited - demanded - a first-time shot and Alonso wrapped 
his right foot around the ball to belt a curler past Schmeichel. That was an 
excellent finish and a superb assist from Hazard: 99.94 per cent of players 
would have had a shot in that situation.

What a start for Chelsea!
 
4 min “Costa is obviously good but he’s all wrong for the England game,” says 
Gavin Steele. “Hope he goes to China to be honest!”

Gavin may or may not be a Spurs/Arsenal/Liverpool/Manchester City/Manchester 
United fan.
 
2 min Leicester almost take the lead after 80 seconds! Musa stumbles through 
an unusually woolly challenge from Azpilicueta on the left of the box before 
hitting a shot from a tight angle that is beaten away by Courtois.
 
1 min Peep peep! Leicester kick off from left to right. They are in blue; 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are wearing their black 
and grey away strip.
 
What do you make of this Diego Costa business? I suppose my view would be 
that, well, China are certainly looking to develop their football, looking at 
their signings and their recruitment. If an opportunity came along I am 
contracted to the Guardian but I have to look at my long-term strategy of my 
career. How long can I last as a liveblogger? I have been at the Guardian 13 
years. It’s been a wonderful 13 years. There is no offer on the table but if 
they made an offer it would be under consideration. But at the moment I still 
enjoy working for the Guardian.

 
We’re having technical problems, and for once that’s not a euphemism. 
Apologies if you’ve had multiple posts inflicted on you. We’re working on it. I 
say ‘we’, I’m doing bugger all as I have no idea how to fix it. But somebody, 
somewhere is on the case.
 
Hello. Chelsea are in crisis: they’ve lost their last one Premier League 
games, their most important player wants to go toChina and their lead at the 
top is down tofour points. We jest, of course, but you know how it is in modern 
football: thePremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>
 Crisis Baton has been transported to the King Power Stadium, ready to be 
handed over at the final whistle if necessary.

Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> will play 38 league 
games this season; this feels like one of the most significant. If they display 
their usual defiance and win, they go seven points clear and quieten the 
burgeoning hysteria. If they lose, the back pages will be theirs for the next 
few days, and their next few league fixtures - Hull, Liverpool, Arsenal - will 
look fraught with peril.

Kick off is at 5.30pm.
