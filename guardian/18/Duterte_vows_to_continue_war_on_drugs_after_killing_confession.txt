The Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/rodrigo-duterte>, has repeated claims that 
he killed suspected criminals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-personally-killed-criminals>
 as he vowed no let-up in his war on drugs that has already claimed thousands 
of lives.

In an hour-long speech on Friday to Filipinos in Singapore, Duterte referred 
to international news coverage of his claims this week that in his previous 
role as mayor of a major southern city he killed suspects to set an example for 
police.

“To spare you embarrassment about the crawlers on television that have been 
running on CNN and even the BBC since yesterday that says Duterte admits 
killing or shooting the criminals: they were not mistaken,” he said.

People in the 6,500-strong crowd cheered as Duterte used his trademark strong 
language to promise his drug war would continue.

“Sons of whores I will really kill these idiots,” he said.

“My campaign on drugs will not end, until the end of my term six years from 
now when every drug pusher is [killed],” he said, making a throat-cutting 
gesture.

Rodrigo Duterte speaking on Wednesday: I used to personally kill criminals

Speaking to Filipino journalists travelling with him in Singapore, Duterte 
said the killings he claims to have committed were part of legitimate 
operations against drug pushers.


Duterte said he had killed three men during a hostage-taking incident in Davao 
City where he was mayor for more than 20 years.


“It was not because I was walking around that I killed,” he said. “It was 
actually an event that was covered by the TV … I said I killed about three of 
them. I didn’t really know how many bullets from my gun went through inside 
their bodies.”

Duterte easily won presidential elections in May largely on a promise to 
eradicate illegal drugs in Filipino society by killing tens of thousands of 
people.

More than 5,000 people have been killed since Duterte took office in late 
June, leading to fears of mass extrajudicial killings and a breakdown in the 
rule of law.

Duterte’s comments this week about personally killing people when he was mayor 
triggered fresh expressions of concern from rights groups and the US government.

The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters: “Those comments 
are deeply troubling, and they certainly are at odds with the Philippine 
government’s stated commitment to due process and rule of law.”

Long-running efforts by a United Nations rights rapporteur, Agnès Callamard, 
to investigate the drugs war hit another hurdle on Friday when she said she had 
rejected three conditions for her visit set by Duterte’s government.

Callamard said she had written to the government urging it to reconsider the 
conditions, which included a public debate with Duterte.

The Philippine foreign secretary, Perfecto Yasay, speaking to reporters in 
Singapore on Friday, said the government would not make any concessions.

“If she cannot comply with it [the Philippine conditions], then that’s the end 
of it,” Yasay said.

Duterte has repeatedly insisted neither he nor his security forces are 
breaking any laws in prosecuting the crime war. However, the president has
publicly encouraged 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-urges-people-to-kill-drug-addicts>
 civilians to kill drug addicts and said he would not prosecute police for 
extrajudicial killings.

A report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/philippines-secret-death-squads-police-officer-teams-behind-killings>
 by the Guardian in October cited a senior officer in the police force who 
claimed he led one of 10 special operations teams, each with 16 members, tasked 
with killing suspected drug users, dealers and criminals.

The officer claimed the hit squads were composed of active police officers and 
that the murders were conducted in such a way as to make them appear to be 
perpetrated by vigilantes to deliberately obscure police involvement and 
preclude investigation.

The report was later denied 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/why-would-we-need-a-hit-squad-philippines-police-chief-denies-state-killings>
 by the chief of police. Duterte has insisted police are killing only in 
self-defence while gangsters are murdering the other victims.

Duterte’s aides and political supporters this week shrugged off his statements 
about personally killing people.

The justice secretary, Vitaliano Aguirre, said Duterte did not violate any 
law, and either was making up the claims or had only killed people in 
self-defence.

“The president always uses hyperbole, is always exaggerated to put his message 
across,” Aguirre said on Wednesday. “If the suspect fought back, he must have 
been forced to kill him.”

Surveys show many Filipinos endorse Duterte’s campaign, and some of those who 
turned up to listen to him in Singapore on Friday expressed sentiments felt by 
compatriots back home.

“When the president promises that he will solve the drugs and crime problem, 
it’s very hopeful for us,” said Eloisa Lopez, 50, a domestic worker who had 
taken time off to volunteer at the event.
