Flights <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/flights> from three London 
airports have been hit by delays after fog shrouded the capital, Britain’s 
largest airline has said.

Festive travel plans faced being thrown into chaos on Thursday morning when 
Heathrow, Gatwick andLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> City 
airports all experienced hold-ups owing to the weather.

A spokesman for Heathrow said some early-morning flights had been been pushed 
back and knock-on delays could occur throughout the day. He added that there 
had been no cancellations so far.

British Airways said on Twitter

 that it was aware of fog affecting flights at the three airports and advised 
passengers to check their flight status online.

A spokeswoman for Gatwick said “about five or six” flights were diverted to 
other airports on Wednesday night due to fog and maintenance work on a runway.


She said normal service had resumed by Thursday morning, and they were taking 
flights diverted from London City.

The delays come as Britain awaits the arrival of Storm Barbara, which is set 
to batter the country with strong winds. Scotland is predicted to be the worst 
hit by the weather, with gusts of up to 90mph forecast in places.

Pockets of Northern Ireland, north Wales and the north of England are also due 
to feel the force of Barbara, which is expected to arrive in the UK by Friday.

The worst of any impact is predicted between Friday evening and Saturday 
morning (Christmas Eve), but the potential for structural damage and disruption 
to some transport services means the storm’s effects could be felt long after 
the winds have subsided.

Grahame Madge, spokesman for the Met Office, said: “We are expecting gusts of 
around 80mph widespread within the amber warning area, up to 90mph in places.

 coming, with plenty of time, hopefully, for people to change their plans if 
they need to.

“But the nature of the storm means it still has the potential to have an 
impact on power supplies, structures, and to disrupt bridge and ferry 
crossings.”

HM Coastguard issued its own safety warnings ahead of the weekend.

Ross Greenhill, coastal operations area commander, said: “We always advise 
people to check the weather and tidal conditions before they set out, so that 
they can either prepare accordingly or consider whether they should even be 
going out at all.

“At sea, changes in tidal streams can make conditions worse, particularly if 
the wind and tide are against each other and tidal heights may hide underwater 
hazards.”

Storm Barbara has been named in line with the Met Office’s alphabetical policy 
for the strongest weather systems and is only the second name designated this 
season, afterStorm Angus

 British Airways said in a statement on its website: “Fog across parts of 
southern England is affecting some flights to and from London’s airports today.

“For safety reasons, air traffic control has to allow greater space between 
landing aircraft in fog or during periods of low visibility, and this will mean 
a reduced number of aircraft being allowed to land each hour.


“We are sorry for the difficulties caused by the poor weather and will do all 
we can to minimise the effect it has on our operations.”
