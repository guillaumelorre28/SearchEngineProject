“Willpower”, “passion”, “aggressiveness”, “fight”. The message was a familiar 
one in Dortmund ahead of the match, but the messenger wasn’t. Thomas Tuchel, 
the 43-year-old head boy of the so-called “laptop coaches” in German, young, 
cerebral, strategy-obsessed managers who prefer a cold, hard look at the 
numbers to heated rhetoric, had ventured deep into Jürgen Klopp territory on 
Friday, proclaiming the need to harness the emotional power of the occasion and 
to add a crucial “third level” to go with tactics and technique.

“That will be the basis of beating Bayern,” Tuchel confidently predicted. And 
he was right. Borussia Dortmund, by their own admission, didn’t have their best 
gameagainst the German champions on Saturday night, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/19/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-bundesliga-match-report>
 but their remarkable ability “to hang in there and not give up” in the face of 
the visitors’ relentless if ultimately imprecise attacks got them over the line 
by the narrowest of margins. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 11th-minute winner, a 
goal scrambled in with a stretched out leg and celebrated with push-ups in 
honour of French rapper Gradur (whose “Sheguey 10 - Tractions” video exalts the 
joys of a rigorous workout) befitted the gritty nature of proceedings. “At the 
moment, we find it a bit hard to play with the ball, that’s why we had to 
battle,” André Schürrle said, “it was proper grown-up stuff today.”

Beating Bayern, “the ultimate statement,” as Tuchel called it, was one part 
coming-of-age story, one part adaption – the ability to persist by performing 
against type. The smooth but somewhat brittle veneer of the opening weeks of 
the season were replaced by unpolished blocks of concrete, to the delight of 
the crowd. “We played a little bit in the style of Atlético Madrid,” the 
sporting director Michael Zorc said, smiling after the final whistle in a 
deliriously happy Signal Iduna Park. “We only had a third of possession, our 
passing rate wasn’t very good but we defended brutally well.” Borussia’s first 
success at home over their southern rivals since 2012 was borne out of courage, 
too. Tuchel had surprised his counterpart Carlo Ancelotti by fielding two 
strikers, Aubameyang and Adrián Ramos, in a highly flexible system that shifted 
from 3-5-2 to 3-4-3 and 5-3-2 over the course of the 90 compelling minutes with 
little loss of traction.

“We knew that we would have to suffer in certain spells, it wasn’t possible to 
prevent that and therefore not a [realistic] ambition for us,” Tuchel 
explained. “That’s why it was important to keep up the intensity in the 
challenges.” As it happened, the player who personified Dortmund’s unexpected 
resilience best was Mario Götze. Inhis first game against his former employers, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/21/borussia-dortmund-sign-mario-gotze-bayern-munich>
 the 24-year-old returnee provided the assist for the goal, courtesy of an 
inch-perfect cross through the legs of ex-BVB captain Mats Hummels, then 
bravely helped to stem the red tide in a central, unglamorous role. “Mario came 
into this with little game time and not much confidence but he worked 
incredibly hard today and showed that he can do decisive stuf,” said Tuchel. 
“It was a great performance and high time for him to put some meat on the bone 
[by being involved in a goal]”. The tasty takeaway for the Westphalians 
consists of a halved, three-point gap behind Bayern (and six behind the cuddly, 
universally popularleague leaders RB Leipzig) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/18/bayer-leverkusen-red-bull-leipzig-bundesliga-match-report>
 as well as the realisation that their relatively young, not quite accomplished 
team will be title contenders after all this season. They are strong enough – 
or Bayern weak enough, if you will. “Their code has been cracked,” WAZ.de noted.

The captain Philipp Lahm was under no illusion that their first defeat of the 
campaign would provide both encouragement and joy for all non-Bavarians. “It’s 
wonderful for the league, exactly what everybody had wished for,” the 
right-back said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Lahm had a second, more 
personal reason to be put out, having been substituted by Ancelotti for Rafinha 
22 minutes before the end. “It doesn’t matter whether I was surprised or not,” 
the 33-year-old offered curtly, “the manager is responsible for changes.” Lahm 
didn’t have to say what everybody could see: Ancelotti’s intervention 
backfired, as Bayern’s early second-half momentum after the introduction of 
Douglas Costa vanished along with the skipper. Dortmund regained composure to 
eke out the win. ForSüddeutsche Zeitung, the visitors’ defeat was yet another 
example of the qualitative demise since the departure of Pep Guardiola. The 
Catalan’s possession football was “sharp as knife,” wrote the broadsheet, “but 
the blade has become blunt”. Movements in the final third were indeed lacking 
in edge and thrust once more in the Signal Iduna Park, (“we didn’t create 
enough chances,” Lahm said) but the story wasn’t quite as clear-cut as far as 
their overall game was concerned.

Bayern’s passing game and positional play, so sloppy in recent weeks, was in 
fact much improved on Saturday, their dominance of the ball more imperious than 
in any of the previous games under the Italian. This time around, his team were 
undermined by individual problems - the continued disorientation of Thomas 
Müller, Xabi Alonso’s rustiness, Franck Ribéry’s errant decision making – 
rather than any fundamental flaws in the (admittedly rather rigid and 
predictable ) 4-3-3 system. Whether the increasingly nervous board and one or 
two players who privately argue for more tactical direction from Ancelotti will 
be able able to look past the unsettling result is another matter, however. 
Some professional football analysts maintain that Bayern’s underlying numbers – 
creation of goal-scoring opportunities, prevention of opposition shots – have 
actually held up better under the new regime than appearances would suggest.

But public perception is just as important for a calm working environment at 
Säbener Strasse. The sense that Bayern have become vulnerable or at the very 
least a team more ordinary this season, is something the bosses find hard to 
live with; future opponents as well as contenders at the top of the table will 
be emboldened, conversely. On the plus side, Ancelotti will be forced to work a 
little harder in coming weeks. The manager would have realised by now that his 
men won’t win a fifth title “with their hands in their pockets,” as he had 
suggested before taking on the job last summer. Sympathy for the champions’ 
unexpected discomfort, as you might expect, is in short supply.

Talking points

Hot on the heels of the incredibly pertinent debate about the rights and 
wrongs of calling Dortmund v Bayern theclásico/Classico/Klassiker, another, no 
less important dilemma: is it acceptable to refer to RB Leipzig as a potential 
German Leicester City? Tuchel certainly thinks so. Following the promoted side’s
3-2 away win 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/18/bayer-leverkusen-red-bull-leipzig-bundesliga-match-report>
 at fellowGegenpressing aficionados Leverkusen, the Dortmund coach opined that 
Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side could “definitely do a Leicester”. Bayer coach Roger 
Schmidt concurred. “There’s absolutely no reason why they couldn’t keep going 
until the end,” he said. If “Leicester City” is merely shorthand for an 
unexpected title run, the situation is indeed comparable. But there are obvious 
differences, too.

Leipzig’s budget is that of a first division mid-table club, not that of a 
newly promoted team with no Bundesliga pedigree, for starters, so the miracle 
wouldn’t be all that miraculous, in purely financial terms. Yes, both the Foxes 
and Die Roten Bullen are owned by foreign billionaires, but while exotic sugar 
daddies are a dime a dozen in the Premier League, Dietmar Mateschitz’s Red Bull 
group – for whose Red Bulletin magazine yours truly contributes a weekly column 
– set up RBL specifically as a franchise in the fifth division in 2009, 
circumventingBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> regulations with a 
creative corporate structure. The club’s unashamed artificiality rides 
roughshod over German football’s (largely) organic ethos, which is why you 
won’t find many neutral cheerleaders for the new league leaders.

Köln’s (temporary?) return to the elite is less controversial but their latest 
win – “They areunkaputtbar!” cheered Express – came at the expense of 
neighbouring rivals Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Rhine Derby. Marcel Risse’s 
90th-minute winner instantly became the stuff of local lore: the midfielder 
struck a free-kick from 34 metres that changed direction a couple of times to 
beat Yann Sommer in goal. “It’s the most emotional goal I have ever scored,” 
said the 26-year-old, “(Anthony) Modeste told me to shoot, not cross.” A most 
unusual request from a centre-forward, especially one as hot as the French 
striker, who added a 12th goal to his tally. But Risse, the Rhine Ronaldo (he’s 
got “MR7” stitched into his boots) did as he was told, to score his second goal 
in such spectacular fashion this season. “These shots are like rabbits,” Köln 
keeper Thomas Kessler said enigmatically, “he’s been bothering me with them in 
training for four years now. I told him to aim a little lower.” Good advice all 
around.
