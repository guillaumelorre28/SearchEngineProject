An Islamic militant who helped destroy the fabled shrines of Timbuktu has been 
sentenced to nine years in prison in a groundbreaking case that prosecutors 
hope will deter other attacks on heritage sites around the world.

The trial was the first at the international criminal court 
<https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi> to focus solely on cultural destruction 
as a war crime. It was also the first prosecution of an Islamic militant by the 
institution, which is based in The Hague.

Wearing a grey suit and blue tie, Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi stood impassively in 
the dock as the presiding judge, Raul Cano Pangalangan read out the sentence.

The junior civil servant turned Islamic militant leader pleaded guilty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/islamic-extremist-pleads-guilty-at-icc-to-timbuktu-cultural-destruction>
 last month to the single charge of “intentionally directing” attacks on nine 
of Timbuktu’s mausoleums and the centuries-old door of its Sidi Yahia mosque in 
2012, when the Malian city was occupied by a coalition of militant groups.

The sentence was proportionate to the gravity of the offence, Pangalangan told 
Mahdi, and would have a “deterrent effect on others tempted to carry out 
similar acts inMali <https://www.theguardian.com/world/mali> or elsewhere”.

The shrines were “the heart of Mali’s cultural heritage [and] were of great 
importance to people of Timbuktu,” he said. “Their destruction does not just 
affect the direct victims of the crimes, but people throughout Mali and the 
international community.”

A slight, bespectacled man of about 40 with a mop of curly hair, Mahdi had 
asked for forgiveness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/islamic-extremist-pleads-guilty-at-icc-to-timbuktu-cultural-destruction>
 from his people during a previous hearing, after videos were shown of him and 
other Islamist extremists attacking shrines with pickaxes and bulldozers.


According to local legend, the main door of the Sidi Yahia mosque would stay 
shut until the Last Judgment.

The “genuine remorse” Mahdi had shown, his apparent empathy for the victims of 
his crime and his initial reluctance to fall in with the plan to destroy the 
shrines, earned him a shorter sentence, Pangalangan said.

A coalition of Tuareg rebels and Islamic militant factions including al-Qaida 
in the Islamic Maghreb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/mokhtar-belmokhtar-uncatchable-chief-africas-islamic-extremists>
 and a local group called Ansar Dine seized much of the northern part of Mali 
in mid-2012. They enforced a harsh version of sharia law in areas under their 
control, banning music, forcing women to wear the burqa and preventing girls 
from attending school, until a French-led military intervention repulsed them 
in January 2013.

Mahdi, from a village 62 miles (100km) outside Timbuktu, had been in 
neighbouring Algeria when the Islamic factions launched their offensive. He 
travelled to Timbuktu shortly after it fell to the extremists.

An acknowledged Islamic scholar, he had already been in contact with leaders 
of the Ansar Dine group and was appointed their religious adviser. He was also 
given command of the Hisba, a religious police charged with stamping out “evil 
practices” and encouraging “correct” behaviour.

The beliefs of the militants who took control in 2012 clashed with local 
custom.

Six centuries ago, Timbuktu was a place of great wealth and a renowned 
cultural centre. Its libraries held hundreds of thousands of precious medieval 
manuscripts and it was known as “the city of 333 saints”, after its many 
mausoleums of holy men.

These long-revered shrines were an immediate target for the hardliners, often 
from abroad, who followed an extreme variant of literalist doctrines practised 
in Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia.

Pangalangan said Mahdi had initially opposed militant leaders’ decision to 
destroy the shrines, saying they should spare them to avoid offending the local 
community. When his arguments were rejected, Mahdi gave orders to level them 
and oversaw the operation.

Apologising for his actions in earlier hearings, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/islamic-extremist-pleads-guilty-at-icc-to-timbuktu-cultural-destruction>
 Mahdi said he had been overtaken by “evil spirits”, urged Muslims not to 
follow his example and said he wanted to seek the pardon of all his countrymen.

He was arrested in Niger and transferred to The Hague in September last year.

One of the most important shrines damaged in Timbuktu was recently opened 
<http://africatimes.com/2016/09/20/mali-dedicates-restored-unesco-mosque-at-center-of-icc-case/>
 to the public and worshippers after restoration.

El-Boukhari Ben Essayouti, who oversaw the reconstruction with Unesco 
assistance, said Mahdi’s trial was an important lesson.

The trial “has to be useful for something, showing to everyone that in the 
same way that we cannot kill another person with impunity, we cannot just 
destroy a world heritage site with impunity either,” he said.

The impact of the decision, however, may be more limited than campaigners and 
experts hope.

During the trial, Fatou Bensouda, the ICC’s chief prosecutor, compared the 
attacks in Timbuktu to Islamic State’s recent destruction of monuments in the 
Syrian city of Palmyra and the Taliban’s wrecking of the Bamiyan Buddha statues 
in Afghanistan in 2001.

It is unlikely that anyone from Iraq and Syria, where archaeological sites 
have been systematically damaged and ransacked for artifacts over recent years, 
will find themselves in the dock in The Hague any time soon.

Neither country is a signatory to the ICC’s founding Rome statute, meaning 
that without a mandate from the UN security council an ICC investigation into 
such crimes is not yet possible.

The successful prosecution of Mahdi will, however, be a boost to the ICC, 
which has beenheavily criticised for its expense and patchy success in 
prosecution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/27/dominic-ongwen-war-crimes-trial-former-child-soldier-icc-uganda>
.

Since the ICC began operating in 2002, prosecutors have indicted 39 
individuals, including the Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony; the Sudanese 
president, Omar al-Bashir; the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta; the former 
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and the former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo.

The court, which has an annual budget of £130m, has handed down only three 
convictions.

Mahdi’s case will be less help in rebutting the frequent accusation of bias 
against African countries.

A peace agreement was signed in Mali last year, but fighting has continued, 
particularly in the lawless north, whereextremists including Ansar Dine 
<http://www.longwarjournal.org/tags/ansar-dine> and bandits thrive. 

Attacks are also becoming increasingly frequent in the central region of the 
country, close to its borders with Burkina Faso and Niger.

A soldier and a civilian were killed in Timbuktu 
<http://reliefweb.int/report/mali/soldier-civilian-killed-malis-timbuktu> in a 
suspected Islamic militant attack last weekend, and Ansar Dine was reported to 
have briefly held the town of Boni earlier this month.
