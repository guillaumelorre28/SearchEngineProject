Sports Direct’s controversial retail deal with Rangers – which has made the 
Old Firm club only about4p from every £1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/rangers-sports-direct-formal-notice-end-joint-venture-dave-king-letter>
 spent in its Ibrox store – was signed by club representatives with a “clear 
conflict of interest”, according to the chairman of the Scottish football team.

In a statement on the one-year anniversary of a boardroom coup that ousted 
directors connected to the Sports Direct founder andRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> shareholder, Mike Ashley, the 
chairman, Dave King, took aim at the club’s joint venture partners and former 
creditors who attempted to have him jailed before Christmas.

King said: “It is unfortunate that it required the repayment of the expensive 
so-called ‘interest-free’ loan [from Sports Direct] before we were able to give 
notice on the agreement with Sports Direct or to take legal action to protect 
the club’s interests and seek restitution.

“This bizarre state of affairs was caused by poorly negotiated agreements 
prior to regime change during which personal interest was put ahead of those of 
the club. Additionally, some of the individuals negotiating on behalf of 
Rangers had a clear conflict of interest.”

The comments mark the latest exchange between the two warring parties after 
Sports Direct backed down from its legal battle with the football club and 
abandoned legal efforts to prevent disclosure of the pair’s joint venture last 
month.

A high court judge, Mr Justice Peter Smith, called Sports Direct’s court case 
a “ridiculous piece of litigation” – a further blow to thethe sportswear 
retailer that had previously failed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/10/court-rejects-mike-ashley-rangers-chairman-dave-king>
 to have King found guilty of contempt of court and sent to prison following 
allegations he had violated a gagging order.

That interim order was imposed last summer, blocking Rangers from publicly 
revealing details of its agreement with the retailer, which contains swingeing 
clauses and was already subject to commercial confidentiality agreements.

A Guardian analysis of the Rangers accounts last month suggested that the 
joint venture with Sports Direct, Rangers Retail Ltd, had paid theScottish 
Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-championship> team 
dividends of about £559,000 since the deal came into effect about four years 
ago. During that time, the Rangers store had taken more than £13m through its 
tills from fans, while a previous retail deal with JJB Sports saw the club 
receive aninitial payment of £18m 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-17063863>, with a 
guaranteed minimum annual royalty of £3m.

 Over the same four-year period, the accounts also suggest that Sports Direct 
was paid three times Rangers’ dividends, totalling about £1.8m. On top of those 
payments, it has also earned hundreds of thousands of pounds from the joint 
venture for providing retailing services. Despite the difference in the amounts 
received by each party, Rangers owns 51% of Rangers Retail, while Sports Direct 
holds the remaining 49%.

 The agreements between the two also include:

 * A seven-year notice period to break the contract

 * A confidentiality agreement that binds Rangers but not Sports Direct 
 * Obligations for Rangers Retail to buy stock at a “higher cost than its 
retail value” 
 * A clause allowing Sports Direct to force Rangers out of its shareholding in 
Rangers Retail if the relationship between the club and the retailer is 
“deadlocked”

 * A further clause that forced the football club to pay Sports Direct 
£620,000 for closing down two former Rangers stores in Glasgow and Belfast 
 * Zero upfront payment to Rangers for awarding the retail deal to Sports 
Direct in 2012 
 * A controlling vote for Sports Direct on “financial matters” concerning 
Rangers Retail. 
Sports Direct could not be contacted to provide comment in time for
