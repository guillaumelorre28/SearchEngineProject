I like the idea of a grand spiritual opening. As every DJ says, I like to take 
the people on a journey. Sometimes I think of my journey as transcending any 
defined existence: a spiritual or intergalactic place.

The best track by my favourite new artist 
Yussef Kamaal: Lowrider

These guys have exploded these past 12 months. They’re a very modern jazz band 
that have emerged from hip-hop, grime, broken beat, house and dub.

The track that currently gets the most rewinds 
Sir Spyro: Topper Top

This is massive. It’s like the underground version of Skepta’s Shutdown. It 
strongly defines a scene that’s been building in and around the UK for some 
time.

The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding 
Burning Flames: Workey Workey

This will be heard at many an auntie’s wedding. I can’t recount the kind of 
moves and shapes I’ve seen. It’s not something a younger family member should 
have experienced.

The track I wish I’d never played 
Julio Bashmore: Au Seve

It sounds like I’m dissing this track but I’m not… I love it and think Julio 
is a great guy. But I played this at Fabric a few years ago, then when I was in 
the taxi home they played it on a really awful radio station. I felt so dirty.

The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes 
Kim Jung Mi: Now

I was out in Korea last year with Peanut Butter Wolf, Earl Sweatshirt, 
Knxwledge and the Egyptian Lover. We went record shopping and all bought a copy 
of this album as soon as the record store owner put it on. I then played it at 
Form festival in Arizona. The mood suited the desert as much as Seoul.

The track that should have been a crossover hit 
Ray BLK: 50/50

She’s so heavy. Yet another artist that represents the vibes and energy right 
now in the UK. A young woman with her own identity to be seen, heard and felt.
