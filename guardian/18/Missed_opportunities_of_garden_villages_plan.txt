Regarding the proposal to develop garden villages and garden towns to bring 
about 50,000 homes (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/02/fourteen-garden-villages-to-be-built-england-48000-homes-green-belt>
, 2 January): in my lifetime pleasant villages and small towns were scattered 
the length and breadth of Britain. Many of these agreeable places to live were 
destroyed by the dismemberment of our industrial sector, or submerged by 
building on every plot of land until they disappeared into an urban mass.

How many decayed or decaying homes remain in the abandoned towns of old 
industrial areas of Britain? The nation would be better served if our energies 
were devoted to recovering abandoned industrial sites, renovating repairable 
existing properties, or clearing away what is derelict and building on 
recovered land. The problem with the Tory plan is that it is the product of the 
old mining culture. Work out a seam and move on, leaving an industrial scar 
nobody wants. The Tories and the developers are not building a new Britain. 
They are mining what is left of Britain’s agricultural heritage.

• If they are to be more than commuter dormitories, the 14 new garden villages 
need to be designed to accommodate home-based work. There is currently a 
widespread blindness to this working practice and its social and spatial 
consequences. Layers of ideology and policy, compacted over a century, have 
pushed it into the shadows. Building to meet the needs of this rapidly growing 
population would increase neighbourhood connectivity and stimulate the local 
economy. It would also contribute to the environmental credentials of the new 
settlements by reducing commuting and intensifying the use of the overall 
building stock.

• I am delighted that one of the government’s garden villages, which is 
already under construction, is being built at Longcross, near Chertsey. No 
doubt prices will be similar to those at nearby Virginia Gate, where terraced 
houses are available from £899,995. This will make such a difference to people 
such as the nurses and care assistants at St Peter’s Hospital, also nearby, who 
struggle to find somewhere to live.

• It is right that Deenethorpe garden village in Northamptonshire will have a 
village green. Every garden village should have a village green, but it 
must not be merely in name. The green must be registered under theCommons Act 
2006 <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/26/pdfs/ukpga_20060026_en.pdf>. 
Then it is protected for ever and local people have rights of recreation there. 
A small recompense for local residents who must suffer new development.
