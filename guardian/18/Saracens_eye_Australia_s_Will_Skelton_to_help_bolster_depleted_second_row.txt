Saracens are considering signing the Australia second row Will Skelton as they 
look to boost their resources in a position where they had to use a flanker in 
theirPremiership victory against Leicester

 on Saturday.

Saracens <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens> had made contact with 
South Africa’s Eben Etzebeth, but he would have been available for only a few 
weeks after the Springboks’ tour of Europe. Skelton is in Australia’s squad for 
their five Tests in the home unions and France, and Sarries want cover to take 
in the Six Nations next year, as well as the coming weeks.

Jim Hamilton is their only fit senior second row, with George Kruis and Maro 
Itoje out until December. “Skelton is one of the players we are looking at,” 
the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said.

“He is in Australia’s touring party and what we want, given the young second 
rows we have coming through, is someone who will add value.

“We are not looking for someone who is ordinary. Michael Rhodes filled in for 
us against Leicester and did really well. He has only played in the second row 
occasionally, but was happy to fit in.”

McCall said his six players who leave for Portugal on Sunday for England’s 
warm-weather training camp are all fit. “More than that, they are all on the 
top of their game, and they leave here in really good form.”
