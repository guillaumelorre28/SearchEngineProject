Justin Browning, a Durham University student, had been part-way through his 
year abroad at Waseda University in Tokyo.

His body was discovered on the ground by a taxi driver, according to the 
Sunday Times. It is thought the history student had gone to the top of the 
building to watch the new year celebrations.

Anthony Bash, honorary professor at Durham University and senior tutor of 
Hatfield College, said: “Justin was an exemplary student in the third year of 
his history degree and he was a well-liked member of Hatfield College.”

He added: “Justin’s untimely death has shocked and saddened everyone connected 
with Hatfield and the wider university. He will be greatly missed. Our thoughts 
are with Justin’s family and friends at this time.

Prof Jo Fox, head of history, said: “Justin was one of our very best students 
and was clearly on course for a strong first-class degree. He demonstrated 
passion for history and in particular the history of Japan and China.

“We had recently heard that Justin’s second year extended project on Tibetan 
Buddhist folklore and ethnicity had just been accepted for publication in the 
Princeton Journal of East Asian Studies. We are incredibly proud of him.

“He was a model student – funny, committed, sharp, independent, and very well 
liked by all.”
