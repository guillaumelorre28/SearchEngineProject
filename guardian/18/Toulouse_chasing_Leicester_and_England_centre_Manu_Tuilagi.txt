Leicester’s Manu Tuilagi <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/manu-tuilagi> is a 
target for Toulouse, according to reports.

The centre will miss the World Cup for England after having been convicted on 
three charges of assault 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/15/manu-tuilagi-rugby-world-cup-assautling-police-officer-england>
, two of which are against female police officers. However, if he were to make 
the move to France he may have played his last game for England, as Stuart 
Lancaster has maintained the policy of not selecting those – such as Steffon 
Armitage (Toulon) and Nick Abendanon (Clermont) – who play outside of England.

Tuilagi is contracted to Leicester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/leicestertigers> until 2017, but the French 
broadcaster RMC has reported that “contact has been established between the 
English international and the chairman of the Stade Toulousain, Rene Bouscatel.”

Leicester will be dismayed by the news, having stood by Tuilagi during his 
latest controversy and in 2011 when he marked the end of the World Cup by
jumping from a ferry in Auckland Harbour
