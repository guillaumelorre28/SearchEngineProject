Thanks guys. That was one of the most halting interviews, but I hope you feel 
like I answered your questions. Thank you so much for listening to me and 
reading and being a part of this - as gushy as it sounds, I'm genuinely 
extremely grateful. Have a nice day!

Hi Kate, are you going to branch out even further, will we see you write for 
TV or film?
The London show was fantastic, thanks!

The thing is that I am following ideas. I'm not starting an idea with a form 
in mind. The idea occurs, and if I give it enough space, and I facilitate its 
passage from me to human hand, it will come out in the right way. If I think: 
It's got to be a film, no idea will come. It's worth saying that one of the 
most enjoyable things about writing is how visual language can me - for the 
audience the conjuring of visuals is one of the most effective parts of a story 
being told at my gigs. I think there's a great deal I would lose writing for a 
camera, than the human mind - but there's probably a great deal I would find 
too. So the answer is: I don't know.

Thanks for listening and sticking with me. I feel closest to the piece that 
I'm touring at the minute, it's in my body at the moment, it's part of me. 
Pride isn't quite the word when it comes to me and my finished pieces. I feel a 
deep connection to Brand New Ancients, and I feel like that was a landmark for 
me, in terms of getting to the end of such a big project: writing it, learning 
it, performing it, touring it. My hope is that I will be proudest of the next 
piece. This is the engine.

I don't know if I agree the more progress we make the more vicious the voices 
are. But I understand why it feels like that. I don't really give much 
attention to haters, trolls, or however you put that, because the thing is, if 
you decide to pay attention to either people who seem to love or hate you 
irrationally, you end up becoming so confused as to why you thought you wanted 
to do this in the first place. You just have to anchor yourself. It's been a 
long time coming this journey - it's not for affection that I"m doing this. In 
terms of when faced with aggression my personal belief is you have to love 
more, activate more love, search for more empathy. If you turn on aggression, 
you soothe no wounds. And that's a hard path - people think it's all been said 
before, peace love and unity - but it's a rougher and more disciplined set of 
principles, and ones you can apply to your everyday life.

Mysticism and me

Enjoyed your gig in Bristol. Listening to you I found myself thinking of 
William Blake and London mysticism and London radicalism. Does that chime with 
you?

Yes. William Blake is a huge part of my daily life. I find his work integral. 
And I go and visit his paintings in the room where they are exhibited in the 
Tate as often as I can. I read him all the time. There is something to be said 
for London mysticism, that definitely has its hands on me - I can feel it. It's 
definitely a mystical environment for me - there's a strong current coursing at 
all times.

Did the Powell and Pressburger film A Matter of Life and Death inspire the 
start of Picture a Vacuum?

I've not seen it, I'm sorry - but it's an age old techinique, to begin in 
space and zoom in to a city. I was inspired by the first lines of Christopher 
Logue's War Music, in which he writes: picture the east Aegean sea by night. I 
may have quoted that wrong! But I found that this command was so effective and 
rattling and immediate that I started to become aware of it in lots of other 
poems. I was talking to a journalist in Ireland, and he talked about Henry V - 
there's a similar panned out instructional monologue apparently in Henry V. 
Please excuse my ignorance, I don't know whose, but as a convention it crops up 
all over music and film.

For others who don’t know the classic film, read our recent article about A 
Matter of Life and Death 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/04/war-love-and-wierdness-a-matter-of-life-and-death-70-years-on>

And our review of Christopher Logue’s War Music

Are you a real person or rather a media construct created by an uber-thinktank

to shift sales units of music and poetry while also ticking boxes and the BBC’s

I'm a real person. But I think that it's worth replying to your question, 
because if this had been an idea dreamt up by some corporate creatives, it 
would be the worst idea they would have ever had. It makes no sense, it ticks 
no boxes, nobody can ever understand what or how or why I do what I do.

Do you have a different way of working now to the way you worked when you 
began making poetry? If so, what is different? Do you find that as your work 
becomes more well known this affects your style and your voice?

Yes. I hope so! I suppose that as you develop your voice and your style and 
your capabilities, you also develop the space in which an idea can present 
itself to you. I feel like the more I read, the more I write, the more I 
perform, the more pieces of work I finish, the closer I come to understanding 
how impossible the idea of improvement is, but how important it is to chase 
this notion of development and improvement. My process in my formative years 
was very musical, and I still feel now primarily a musician, but my instrument 
is words and language - even when I'm writing prose, it's musical, the way it 
occurs to me and the way I write as well, the sound of the writing. I feel like 
I've got my head around narrative a bit more than I did when I began.

I'm also interested in formal techniques when I begin to understand what their 
conventions are. For example, the form of the play, you know? Or the poem. The 
poetry collection, the novel, the long poem, the album, the song, and within 
that obviously the different forms of poems I've experimented with. Also I've 
been extremely lucky to have the attention of an editor like Don Paterson, who 
has taught me so much about reexamining motives behind words, not just: is that 
the right word, but, why do you want that to be the right word? And working on 
Chaos, this album, I could feel the direct impact of that relationship in the 
way I was writing the lyrics. After we got the first draft written, I took my 
lyric books, with all my handwritten scrawled ideas and unedited takes, and 
worked them into a manuscript, and applied the same principles I'd learn from 
Don to the album lyrics as an entire thing. Which was a hugely important moment 
for the development of the record.

TW2017 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17124929> asks:

1. What is one piece of advice you would tell your 14-year-old self? 
2. On a lighter note, what’s your favorite memory with your dog, Murphy?

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17131527> Guardian contributor 
KateTempest  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17131527> 14 December 
2016 1:44pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89453268> 
1. This is an interesting question. Because when I was 14 I felt like I was in 
this constant communication with my older self, and that I could hear Kate, the 
elder Kate, when I was at my most troubled. And actually that was the beginning 
of my writing - it was this relationship with this older voice that used to 
talk to me. When I discovered Jung, and he talked about the two personalities 
present in each mind, I really connected with what he was saying. He attributed 
the personality of the times and the personality of the depths - you have this 
one self who is the self you need to be in order to function, to have an 
occupation and a relationship, and there's this other personality that's 
connected to all of humanity, and eternity and the depths of the world, he 
calls it. The second personality is the one we learn to subdue and not listen 
to because it's terrifying, but in childhood this is the personality that gives 
us our dreams. It's worth saying that this is a very loose interpretation of 
Jung, and it's going through two people to get to where it is, and I'm not 
claiming any expertise on Jung. But it's interesting that we're in constant 
communication with our older and younger selves, so I'm constantly giving my 14 
year old self advice. And my 14 year old self is constantly receiving it. In 
one of earlier my raps, Thirteen Commandments was one of them, I understand now 
as being direct advice to lift me out of some troubles I was having at the 
time, trying to live a bit closer to how I knew I should be living.

But having said that, some advice I would give to somebody else who was 14, is 
keep going, be careful with yourself, and trust your instincts. And listen to 
your friends.

2. I've got many happy memories with my dog Murphy! He came with me on tour, I 
got him a passport and he came round Europe, and he had a bunk on the tourbus. 
He chilled everyone out. I'd go off on three hour walks with him - a nature 
reserve in Norwich, the secret towpaths of Manchester, this amazing river in 
Munich, he's been on the beach in Barcelona. It's beautiful! We went to the 
necropolis in Glasgow in the pissing rain. It meant that no matter lifted you 
feel after something massive and strange as these big performances, the next 
morning you do the most grounding thing you can do: walk the dog.

And chat to people - dog chat is one of the most universal things you can do. 
I've had dog chat in Swiss, in German, and I was too embarrassed to stop them 
and say I didn't understand, I just went along with the dog chat I know to be 
true: the smiles and the chats. I was in Dublin, and I was in Phoenix Park 
which is one of the biggest municipal parks in Europe, and I met this lovely 
old guy who told me that that morning, a friend of his, a young man's wife had 
died of cancer, she was only 28 with a young daughter of 3, and she was at home 
with this old fella. It just came out - we had this conversation about the 
fleetingness of life. It was a really moving exchange - he was a beautiful 
soul, who had some really interesting perspectives on what had happened to him 
that morning. I was saying this to one of my bandmates, and he said: imagine if 
all those people in Germany had been saying the same things? And you've just 
been smiling and nodding!

Poetry and young people

lotusblue <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4286518> asks:

Can poetry ever really be cool to young people? (You’re not allowed to mention 
rap lyrics!)

I don't think it ever tries to be. I think that if young people are connected 
to poetry it's in no lesser way to the way old people are. I think we seek 
expression and community and recognition of expression in times when we are 
most fragile or most elated, most ecstatic, attracted, destroyed. It's never 
been about an impulse to please and I don't think there's much place in poetry 
for coolness or posturing or anything like that - it gives the idea of holding 
something back when really you go to a poem when you need to give everything. 
And when you need to have everything given to you, and there's nothing cool 
about that. That's what makes it so great.

What do you think of the current contemporary poetry scene in this country? 
When you write, do you have a certain “genre” in mind – ie rap, poetry, prose? 
– or is it just all writing to you, and you decide what to do with it after 
you’ve written it?

I think it's in great shape. I think there's an abundance of new voices and 
young talent coming through. And putting on their own nights, and sharing their 
work. On the other side of that, in the more conventional poetry circuits, I 
think there's some really strong work being produced, so to give some names, 
spoken word wise: Zia Ahmed, Isaiah Hull, Diana Roger, Selina Godden (she is 
the general). In terms of more conventional poetry, as in published on the 
page: Robert McClane, Sam Riviera, Warsan Shire.

Here’s some Salena Godden:

The joy of performing live

Wifeofbath <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3577222> asks:

Thank you so much for the Bristol gig the other night, it blew me away. I 
don’t know if you noticed – lots of us in the audience were in tears after your 
encore, as a result of being moved by your own lovely, emotional response and 
by the words of the encore piece, which encapsulated how so many of us are 
feeling right now: horrified but daring to hope. Another thing that both struck 
and moved me was that the audience was such a wide, heartening cross-section of 
gender and age groups. Are you seeing the same mix in all your audiences on 
this tour?

There's something extremely heartening about seeing such varied audiences. We 
did a gig in Salt Lake City that was attended by I'm gonna say 21 people, in 
this very cool venue, and there were three generations of the same family, 
three women, and it was moving to talk to them and find what brought them out. 
I don't think I've experienced that before. On this tour there's been some 
really young girls, much younger than we've previously had, and at the same 
time, people who look like they could be those girls' grandparents. And there's 
a nice bunch of old punks that come through, that seem excited about what we're 
doing with the live show. I think it's beautiful. I struggled with it - I 
thought it's not cool if there's old ladies at my gigs - but I think it's 
beautiful now. I had a coachload of pensioners who had been discussing Brand 
New Ancients at their church reading group. They put chairs across the front 
row. It was hard to begin with - I wanted to play a hard electro rap set - but 
they bopped along. That's also what's interesting - because of the different 
worlds that I work across and all the different pieces I've made, you never 
know who has come for what, why they're there and what they expect. And you can 
tie yourself up in knots wondering what the audience want from you or why 
they're there.

But the best thing for the performance is to go to the place that you know to 
be where performance comes from, and not try and deliver what you think people 
have paid money to see, but go where you need to go to get to where you need to 
be. It can be terrifying to see old and young people, but it can also be 
exhilarating. Bristol was a specifically memorable gig for that, there were so 
many different types of people in the place. Bristol is somewhere I feel very 
close to - I love that city, I have family there and that was a beautiful gig. 
I actually burst into tears on stage - just the audience at the end, the huge 
applause, and also the culmination of all the energy that had been raised... 
the characters felt very real that night. I was a mess, crying; my drummer came 
out and gave me a big cuddle. He said: Marvin Gaye, for the children, you've 
already won. That sorted me out. It was beautiful!

The thing is that I am following ideas. I'm not starting an idea with a form 
in mind. The idea occurs, and if I give it enough space, and I facilitate its 
passage from me to human hand, it will come out in the right way. If I think: 
It's got to be a film, no idea will come. It's worth saying that one of the 
most enjoyable things about writing is how visual language can me - for the 
audience the conjuring of visuals is one of the most effective parts of a story 
being told at my gigs. I think there's a great deal I would lose writing for a 
camera, than the human mind - but there's probably a great deal I would find 
too. So the answer is: I don't know.

Thanks for listening and sticking with me. I feel closest to the piece that 
I'm touring at the minute, it's in my body at the moment, it's part of me. 
Pride isn't quite the word when it comes to me and my finished pieces. I feel a 
deep connection to Brand New Ancients, and I feel like that was a landmark for 
me, in terms of getting to the end of such a big project: writing it, learning 
it, performing it, touring it. My hope is that I will be proudest of the next 
piece. This is the engine.

I don't know if I agree the more progress we make the more vicious the voices 
are. But I understand why it feels like that. I don't really give much 
attention to haters, trolls, or however you put that, because the thing is, if 
you decide to pay attention to either people who seem to love or hate you 
irrationally, you end up becoming so confused as to why you thought you wanted 
to do this in the first place. You just have to anchor yourself. It's been a 
long time coming this journey - it's not for affection that I"m doing this. In 
terms of when faced with aggression my personal belief is you have to love 
more, activate more love, search for more empathy. If you turn on aggression, 
you soothe no wounds. And that's a hard path - people think it's all been said 
before, peace love and unity - but it's a rougher and more disciplined set of 
principles, and ones you can apply to your everyday life.

Yes. William Blake is a huge part of my daily life. I find his work integral. 
And I go and visit his paintings in the room where they are exhibited in the 
Tate as often as I can. I read him all the time. There is something to be said 
for London mysticism, that definitely has its hands on me - I can feel it. It's 
definitely a mystical environment for me - there's a strong current coursing at 
all times.

Did the Powell and Pressburger film A Matter of Life and Death inspire the

I've not seen it, I'm sorry - but it's an age old techinique, to begin in 
space and zoom in to a city. I was inspired by the first lines of Christopher 
Logue's War Music, in which he writes: picture the east Aegean sea by night. I 
may have quoted that wrong! But I found that this command was so effective and 
rattling and immediate that I started to become aware of it in lots of other 
poems. I was talking to a journalist in Ireland, and he talked about Henry V - 
there's a similar panned out instructional monologue apparently in Henry V. 
Please excuse my ignorance, I don't know whose, but as a convention it crops up 
all over music and film.

For others who don’t know the classic film, read our recent article about A 
Matter of Life and Death

I'm a real person. But I think that it's worth replying to your question,

Do you have a different way of working now to the way you worked when you 
began making poetry? If so, what is different? Do you find that as your work 
becomes more well known this affects your style and your voice?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17131527> Guardian contributor 
KateTempest  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17131527> 14 December 
2016 1:49pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89453635> 
Yes. I hope so! I suppose that as you develop your voice and your style and 
your capabilities, you also develop the space in which an idea can present 
itself to you. I feel like the more I read, the more I write, the more I 
perform, the more pieces of work I finish, the closer I come to understanding 
how impossible the idea of improvement is, but how important it is to chase 
this notion of development and improvement. My process in my formative years 
was very musical, and I still feel now primarily a musician, but my instrument 
is words and language - even when I'm writing prose, it's musical, the way it 
occurs to me and the way I write as well, the sound of the writing. I feel like 
I've got my head around narrative a bit more than I did when I began.

I'm also interested in formal techniques when I begin to understand what their 
conventions are. For example, the form of the play, you know? Or the poem. The 
poetry collection, the novel, the long poem, the album, the song, and within 
that obviously the different forms of poems I've experimented with. Also I've 
been extremely lucky to have the attention of an editor like Don Paterson, who 
has taught me so much about reexamining motives behind words, not just: is that 
the right word, but, why do you want that to be the right word? And working on 
Chaos, this album, I could feel the direct impact of that relationship in the 
way I was writing the lyrics. After we got the first draft written, I took my 
lyric books, with all my handwritten scrawled ideas and unedited takes, and 
worked them into a manuscript, and applied the same principles I'd learn from 
Don to the album lyrics as an entire thing. Which was a hugely important moment 
for the development of the record.
 
TW2017 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17124929> asks:

1. What is one piece of advice you would tell your 14-year-old self? 
2. On a lighter note, what’s your favorite memory with your dog, Murphy?

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17131527> Guardian contributor 
KateTempest  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17131527> 14 December 
2016 1:44pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89453268> 
1. This is an interesting question. Because when I was 14 I felt like I was in 
this constant communication with my older self, and that I could hear Kate, the 
elder Kate, when I was at my most troubled. And actually that was the beginning 
of my writing - it was this relationship with this older voice that used to 
talk to me. When I discovered Jung, and he talked about the two personalities 
present in each mind, I really connected with what he was saying. He attributed 
the personality of the times and the personality of the depths - you have this 
one self who is the self you need to be in order to function, to have an 
occupation and a relationship, and there's this other personality that's 
connected to all of humanity, and eternity and the depths of the world, he 
calls it. The second personality is the one we learn to subdue and not listen 
to because it's terrifying, but in childhood this is the personality that gives 
us our dreams. It's worth saying that this is a very loose interpretation of 
Jung, and it's going through two people to get to where it is, and I'm not 
claiming any expertise on Jung. But it's interesting that we're in constant 
communication with our older and younger selves, so I'm constantly giving my 14 
year old self advice. And my 14 year old self is constantly receiving it. In 
one of earlier my raps, Thirteen Commandments was one of them, I understand now 
as being direct advice to lift me out of some troubles I was having at the 
time, trying to live a bit closer to how I knew I should be living.

But having said that, some advice I would give to somebody else who was 14, is 
keep going, be careful with yourself, and trust your instincts. And listen to 
your friends.

2. I've got many happy memories with my dog Murphy! He came with me on tour, I 
got him a passport and he came round Europe, and he had a bunk on the tourbus. 
He chilled everyone out. I'd go off on three hour walks with him - a nature 
reserve in Norwich, the secret towpaths of Manchester, this amazing river in 
Munich, he's been on the beach in Barcelona. It's beautiful! We went to the 
necropolis in Glasgow in the pissing rain. It meant that no matter lifted you 
feel after something massive and strange as these big performances, the next 
morning you do the most grounding thing you can do: walk the dog.

And chat to people - dog chat is one of the most universal things you can do. 
I've had dog chat in Swiss, in German, and I was too embarrassed to stop them 
and say I didn't understand, I just went along with the dog chat I know to be 
true: the smiles and the chats. I was in Dublin, and I was in Phoenix Park 
which is one of the biggest municipal parks in Europe, and I met this lovely 
old guy who told me that that morning, a friend of his, a young man's wife had 
died of cancer, she was only 28 with a young daughter of 3, and she was at home 
with this old fella. It just came out - we had this conversation about the 
fleetingness of life. It was a really moving exchange - he was a beautiful 
soul, who had some really interesting perspectives on what had happened to him 
that morning. I was saying this to one of my bandmates, and he said: imagine if 
all those people in Germany had been saying the same things? And you've just 
been smiling and nodding!

I don't think it ever tries to be. I think that if young people are connected 
to poetry it's in no lesser way to the way old people are. I think we seek 
expression and community and recognition of expression in times when we are 
most fragile or most elated, most ecstatic, attracted, destroyed. It's never 
been about an impulse to please and I don't think there's much place in poetry 
for coolness or posturing or anything like that - it gives the idea of holding 
something back when really you go to a poem when you need to give everything. 
And when you need to have everything given to you, and there's nothing cool 
about that. That's what makes it so great.

What do you think of the current contemporary poetry scene in this country? 
When you write, do you have a certain “genre” in mind – ie rap, poetry, prose? 
– or is it just all writing to you, and you decide what to do with it after 
you’ve written it?

I think it's in great shape. I think there's an abundance of new voices and 
young talent coming through. And putting on their own nights, and sharing their 
work. On the other side of that, in the more conventional poetry circuits, I 
think there's some really strong work being produced, so to give some names, 
spoken word wise: Zia Ahmed, Isaiah Hull, Diana Roger, Selina Godden (she is 
the general). In terms of more conventional poetry, as in published on the 
page: Robert McClane, Sam Riviera, Warsan Shire.

Here’s some Salena Godden:

Thank you so much for the Bristol gig the other night, it blew me away. I 
don’t know if you noticed – lots of us in the audience were in tears after your 
encore, as a result of being moved by your own lovely, emotional response and 
by the words of the encore piece, which encapsulated how so many of us are 
feeling right now: horrified but daring to hope. Another thing that both struck 
and moved me was that the audience was such a wide, heartening cross-section of 
gender and age groups. Are you seeing the same mix in all your audiences on 
this tour?

There's something extremely heartening about seeing such varied audiences. We 
did a gig in Salt Lake City that was attended by I'm gonna say 21 people, in 
this very cool venue, and there were three generations of the same family, 
three women, and it was moving to talk to them and find what brought them out. 
I don't think I've experienced that before. On this tour there's been some 
really young girls, much younger than we've previously had, and at the same 
time, people who look like they could be those girls' grandparents. And there's 
a nice bunch of old punks that come through, that seem excited about what we're 
doing with the live show. I think it's beautiful. I struggled with it - I 
thought it's not cool if there's old ladies at my gigs - but I think it's 
beautiful now. I had a coachload of pensioners who had been discussing Brand 
New Ancients at their church reading group. They put chairs across the front 
row. It was hard to begin with - I wanted to play a hard electro rap set - but 
they bopped along. That's also what's interesting - because of the different 
worlds that I work across and all the different pieces I've made, you never 
know who has come for what, why they're there and what they expect. And you can 
tie yourself up in knots wondering what the audience want from you or why 
they're there.

But the best thing for the performance is to go to the place that you know to 
be where performance comes from, and not try and deliver what you think people 
have paid money to see, but go where you need to go to get to where you need to 
be. It can be terrifying to see old and young people, but it can also be 
exhilarating. Bristol was a specifically memorable gig for that, there were so 
many different types of people in the place. Bristol is somewhere I feel very 
close to - I love that city, I have family there and that was a beautiful gig. 
I actually burst into tears on stage - just the audience at the end, the huge 
applause, and also the culmination of all the energy that had been raised... 
the characters felt very real that night. I was a mess, crying; my drummer came 
out and gave me a big cuddle. He said: Marvin Gaye, for the children, you've 
already won. That sorted me out. It was beautiful!
