What do you want to achieve in life?
I am not really interested in money. I feel like I could be as rich as I want 
to be, but the problem is people understanding what it’s like to be rich 
inside. I’d like to get that message across to people.

What is the worst thing anyone’s said to you?
I was at a party and I had on fresh Air Force 1s 
<http://store.nike.com/gb/en_gb/pw/nikeid-air-force-1/1k9Z816>, and some dude 
just started dissing my trainers. I was so confused.

What is top of your bucket list?
To buy my mum a house.

What is your guiltiest pleasure? 
I tend not to do things that I feel I shouldn’t be doing.

What do you admire most about your parents? And what do you find most annoying?
I grew up with my mum, but I am in contact with my dad. What I admire about 
them is that they both have an understanding of peace. Some people come from 
families where parents are together, but there’s no peace. The most annoying 
thing about my mum is that I might have to explain something 10 times to her. 
My dad lives in Ghana. Other than that, it’s all good.

Which living person do you most admire, and why?
My little brother, Dante. He is 14 – he doesn’t have a point to prove.

What is the best thing about being a teen? And the worst?
The best thing is being able to add teen next to a number, 19. The worst is 
not being perceived how you actually are, based on your age.

When I am praying and meditating on good things.

What makes you unhappy? 
When I am not prepared for the weather.

What do you like most about your appearance? And dislike?
I like that I don’t look like anyone. I don’t have any dislikes. You’ve got to 
love yourself to the maximum.

What is your most unappealing habit?
When people talk to me and I am silent because I am thinking.

What is your favourite food?
Nachos with cheese.
