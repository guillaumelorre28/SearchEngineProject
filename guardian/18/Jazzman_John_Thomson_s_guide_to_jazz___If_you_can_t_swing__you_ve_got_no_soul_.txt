Jazz. The very word strikes terror in many hearts. For others, the word is 
always followed by “Niiiice” and a smirk. That’s my fault. ForThe Fast Show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-fast-show>, I created Louis 
Balfour, or The Jazzman as he’s affectionately known, whose catchphrase that 
was. Louis is still my most recognised Fast Show character: through him, we 
gently lampooned the genre for the full six-year run of the show in the 90s.

Not that we ever had any trouble getting musicians to appear. In my 
experience, musicians have a much better sense of humour than many comedians. 
We’d use session musicians who were all incredibly good – they had to be, 
because some of the musicPhil Pope <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Pope> 
wrote for the sketches was really tough.

With Louis, I went for a cross between Roger Moore and whispering Bob Harris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/31/bob-harris-interview-old-grey-whistle-test-bbc>
, while my costume was a tribute toBuddy Rich <http://buddyrich.com/>, the 
legendary jazz drummer who rocked the polo-neck look. It’s a good jazz look.
Charlie Higson <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlie-higson> would 
script the scenes and we’d film a whole series’ worth in a single day. You can 
tell what point we were at by the wig. It was too small and would creep further 
round the back of my head, so that by the end of the day I looked like Henry V.

Strangers still approach me today and throw a quick “Niiiice” my way, for 
which the only response has to be “Great!” They walk away beaming, and I’m 
content that I’ve made their day with one word. Would these people be shocked 
to hear that I love jazz, that I have done all my life? If you can’t swing, 
you’ve got no soul. I’d even go so far as to say that a musician who doesn’t 
like jazz can’t call himself a real musician. It’s where the best players are. 
If you don’t embrace jazz, its lineage, its history, you’re not a real player.

There’s a lot of ignorance surrounding jazz. I like to compare it to the great 
British staple,curry <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/curry>. Ask some 
people if they like it and they’ll tell you: “No. I don’t eat spicy food.” And 
thus, in the same vein: “Do you like jazz?” “No! It’s weird.”

Curry, of course, is not just one thing. There are myriad different kinds, 
something for everyone from vegans to carnivores, from the hottest of vindaloos 
to the mildest of kormas. And so too jazz.

But I do have a little sympathy for the uninitiated. When people say “weird”, 
I get the impression they’ve encounteredfree jazz 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_jazz>, the musical equivalent of Tracey 
Emin’s bed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/30/tracey-emins-messy-bed-displayed-tate-britain-first-time-in-15-years>
. The lateTony Wilson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/10/tony-wilson-tribute-st-anthony-happy-mondays-rowetta-idah-new-order-bernard-sumner-manchester>
, my friend and the boss of Factory Records, said he would never go and see 
jazz because he couldn’t tolerate the idea of the musicians having a better 
time than the audience. I laughed at that, but there’s an element of truth to 
it. This avant garde form of free jazz, with no melodic structure, is what we 
were parodying in The Fast Show. But there’s much more to jazz than that.

I’ve been playing the drums since I was 11. All drummers have to listen to and 
study other drummers – and I quickly discovered that all the best drummers were 
jazz musicians. It wasn’t long before I came across the incredible powerhouse 
that was Buddy Rich, the world’s greatest drummer. He only had to hear a track 
once and he would be able to phrase it perfectly. He didn’t read music and 
didn’t practise. He didn’t need to do either. No one could play like he could. 
His big band were a huge inspiration to me.

 Livening up Lyon … Billy Cobham. Photograph: Andrew Putler/Redferns 
At school, we did an exchange trip to Lyon, then a gloomy industrial town 
where the weather was “mauvais, tous les jours”. I stayed with an extended 
French family in their small apartment and wasn’t fluent enough to hold down a 
decent conversation with my hosts, so was often very bored. My saving grace was 
their vinyl collection. One album stood out:Stanley Clarke 
<http://stanleyclarke.com/>’s School Days, from 1976. It’s a masterful album, 
ending on the incredible Life Is Just a Game – withBilly Cobham 
<http://billycobham.com/>, another jazz great, on drums. I listened to it so 
much that the family presented me with their copy as a leaving gift.

Clarke opened my ears. I’ve still got that album. It made me a huge fan of 
jazz-funk and fusion. I would buy albums and, if a vocal track came on, I’d be 
disappointed. I still love this music, which sometimes gets referred to asCeefax
 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/18/twitter-ceefax-demise> jazz or 
elevator music. I find it very calming, though sometimes I crave a bit more 
hellfire.

Soon I was on Jonathan Ross, playing drum solos for Phil Collins to identify

In the final ever episode of The Fast Show, I actually managed to play drums 
very briefly – before getting shot by the Boxwell Heath Archery Club. Things 
ended better in the recent series ofCold Feet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/24/cold-feet-finale-review-i-dreaded-this-reunion-but-it-was-good-to-catch-up-with-old-friends>
, as my character Pete joined his son’s band on stage to play Teenage Kicks. It 
was a pivotal scene and afterwards there were all these people on social media 
asking if that was really me playing. My secret was out. Soon, I was on The 
Jonathan Ross Show – playing drum solos for Phil Collins to identify.

The drumming might not be your thing, but there’s so much more to jazz than 
goatee beards and berets. Frank Sinatra? Michael Bublé? George Benson? All 
great jazz singers. Give it a go. Then go for a curry and order something 
different – something, dare I say, spicy?

• The London jazz festival <http://efglondonjazzfestival.org.uk/> runs until 
20 November.

The sound of cool: John Thomson’s 10 favourite jazz tracks

Smells Like Teen Spirit – Paul Anka 
The Canadian singer’s 2005 album Rock Swings featured big-band versions of 
some hilariously unlikely pop songs, from Pet Shop Boys to the Cure to the 
Human League. For this Nirvana makeover, arranger John Clayton borrows heavily 
from Nelson Riddle’s arrangements for Sinatra to magnificent effect. “That’s 
the first time I’ve ever heard the fucking words!” said a delighted Dave Grohl 
to Paul Anka.

Body and Soul – Tony Bennett/Amy Winehouse
It’s grimly fitting that Winehouse, who started her singing career fronting 
the National YouthJazz <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> Orchestra, made 
her final recorded appearance on Bennett’s 2011 album Duets II, singing a 
classic jazz standard. This Grammy-winning track sees Argentine arranger Jorge 
Calandrelli providing a suitably lush orchestral backing as Bennett and 
Winehouse trade highly improvisatory four-bar phrases on Johnny Green’s 1930 
song.

Can’t Buy Me Love – Michael Bublé
This Beatles song has been a jazz standard ever since Ella Fitzgerald covered 
it a couple of months after its release in 1964. This version from Bublé’s 2005 
album It’s Time is arranged by Jochem Van Der Saag and features a tremendous 
walking bass line from Robert Hurst.

Give Me the Night – George Benson 
A major jazz guitarist in the 60s (he plays on Miles Davis’s 1968 LP Miles in 
the Sky), Benson reinvented himself as a singer in the late 70s. This 1980 
single was written by Cleethorpes’ late, great Rod Temperton, produced by 
Quincy Jones and features assorted jazz heavyweights, including Herbie Hancock 
and Lee Ritenour.

Matinee Idol – YellowJackets
The Yellowjackets are a long-running jazz-fusion outfit from LA. This track 
from their 1981 debut album was written by keyboard player Russell Ferrante.

Westchester Lady – Bob James
Keyboard player Bob James found his career rebooted in the early 90s as one of 
the most sampled musicians in hip-hop history. This 1976 instrumental has been 
sampled by dozens of acts, including Massive Attack, Dilated Peoples, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff and the Fresh Prince and United Future Organization.

Theme from Bullitt – Lalo Schifrin
Argentine composer and pianist Lalo Schifrin recorded dozens of soundtracks to 
films and TV shows – Mission Impossible, Cool Hand Luke, Jaws, The Man from 
UNCLE, The Exorcist, all the Dirty Harry movies – but none as iconic as this 
funky big-band theme to the 1968 Steve McQueen vehicle. The solo acoustic 
guitar version on the soundtrack is also a killer.

Double Steal – Fuse One
Fuse One were a jazz-funk supergroup featuring assorted heavyweight musicians 
who recorded for the CTI label. This track from their 1980 debut is written by 
Spyro Gyra keyboard player Jeremy Wall and features a stellar cast, including 
bassist Stanley Clarke, guitarist John McLaughlin and saxophonist Joe Farrell.

Beat 70 – Pat Metheny Group 
Taken from the 1989 album Letter from Home, this Brazilian-themed samba is 
based on the interplay between Pat Metheny’s FX-laden guitar improvisations and 
the harmonica-style melody of his keyboard player Lyle Mays.

Garden Party – Mezzoforte
Until Björk and the Sugarcubes came along, this jazz collective were Iceland’s 
most famous musical export. Garden Party, from their breakthrough 1982 album, 
is a jazz-funk fave written by their keyboard player Eythor Gunnarsson.
