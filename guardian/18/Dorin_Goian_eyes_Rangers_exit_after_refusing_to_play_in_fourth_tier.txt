The Romanian defender, who joined Rangers from Palermo last summer, had vowed 
to stay if the club were allowed into the First Division. But he quickly 
announced his intention to quit after 25 Scottish Football League clubs voted 
to admit Charles Green'sRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
in the bottom tier.

Goian told Romanian media: "I am not playing at the fourth level – there's no 
question of that. I am on my way back and I will meet the president of the club 
and I will learn more.

"My agent has already spoken with other teams but nothing has been agreed yet. 
I would have stayed if it was the First Division – but not this."
