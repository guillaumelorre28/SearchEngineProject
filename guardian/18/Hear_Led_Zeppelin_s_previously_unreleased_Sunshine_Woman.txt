“There’s no point pretending it wasn’t recorded off the radio,” Jimmy Page old 
Mojo of Sunshine Woman, the previously unreleasedLed Zeppelin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ledzeppelin> track we’re premiering today. 
And indeed there isn’t. This is very much the sound familiar to those who spent 
their evenings poised over the pause button, searching for a stable signal. 
It’s muddy, imprecise and a far cry from the sonic clarity one associates with 
Zeppelin. But, still, it’s an unreleased song, from a lost BBC session, 
previously available only on bootlegs.

This recording is one of the new tracks added to the remastered reissue of the 
band’s album of BBC session recordings, released on 16 September asThe Complete 
BBC Sessions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/19/led-zeppelin-complete-bbc-sessions-compilation>
, in the usual array of formats (CD, vinyl, knobs-and-whistles-laden box). And 
it comes from a session recorded for Alexis Korner’s World Service show in 
March 1969. Sunshine Woman, Page told Mojo, “was basically made up on the spot. 
It was pretty brave, bearing in mind the circumstances. We played it as if we 
were in rehearsals, starting it around the riff and then working it out. It 
shows that we were evolving pretty quickly.”

The tape of that session disappeared, and so it has only existed as a 
poor-quality bootleg. This version, Page insists, is the best recording you 
will ever find of what might be the last previously unheard complete Zeppelin 
song to get an official release. Have a listen, and tell us what you think.
