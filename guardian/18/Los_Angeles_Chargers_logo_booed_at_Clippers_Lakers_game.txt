coast.

Los Angeles <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles> fans at a 
Clippers-Lakers game Saturday booed the Chargers’ new logo when it was shown on 
the video board, then jeered tight end Jeff Cumberland when he was put on the 
big screen.

Cumberland signed with the Chargers as a free agent before the 2016-17 season, 
but tore his left achilles tendon in a preseason contest and never played a

The Clippers beat the Lakers 113-97 on the night. The Clippers coach, Doc 
Rivers, said he thought LA absorb twoNFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl>
 teams in the Rams and Chargers. 

“You never want anybody to leave a city, but this is a big city, and I think 
we can handle it,” he said on Saturday.

“There’s enough room for two basketball teams,” Rivers said. “We have a lot of 
Clippers fans, and there’s a lot of Lakers fans. There are two soccer teams 
[Los Angeles FC will start playing in 2018]. There are two football teams. I 
guess there are two baseball teams, even though they’re not both in LA. There’s 
enough room. So it’ll be great. We have something to do on all weekends. That’s 
nice.”

The Chargers’ new logo has been widely ridiculed since its unveiling last 
week, and the team’s owners have said they will not use it on a permanent 
basis. “The logo that was revealed on Thursday was meant to help launch our 
brand into the market and supplement — not replace — our official team marks,” 
the Chargers president of business operations, AG Spanos,told Pro Football Talk
