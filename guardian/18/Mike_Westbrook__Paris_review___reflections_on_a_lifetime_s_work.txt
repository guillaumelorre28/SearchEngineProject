Recorded live in Paris last year after his 80th birthday, this solo piano set 
findsMike Westbrook <http://www.westbrookjazz.co.uk/> reflecting on a 
lifetime’s work as a composer. As well as instrumental jazz, this has included 
everything from music-theatre to brass bands, mostly written in collaboration 
with his wife,Kate <http://www.westbrookjazz.co.uk/katewestbrook/index.shtml>. 
Themes from some of these, such as Citadel/Room 315, The Ass and Paintbox Jane, 
appear among 20 short pieces, along with favourites by Duke Ellington, Bessie 
Smith and others. Westbrook’s style is an engaging mixture of warmth and 
dissonance, spiced by a touch of honky-tonk. With its constantly changing moods 
and familiar melodies cunningly revealed, an hour’s music seems to pass in half 
the time.
