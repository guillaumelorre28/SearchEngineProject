Dairy Crest, the business behind Cathedral City, is on the rise after an 
upbeat brokers note.

The company has gone through a structural change by selling its milk business 
and it reported a 5.8% fall in full year revenues last month. But it said 
profit margins remained strong at its remaining businesses, despite the 
competitive pressures from its supermarket customers. Analysts at Investec have 
just issued a buy note, albeit with a reduced target price, which has helped 
lift its shares 1.6% to 553p and make it one of the biggest risers in the FTSE 
250. Investec said:

A year of transition, 2016 saw Dairy Crest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/dairycrestgroup> shed its liquid milk 
operations and add higher value ingredients to the business mix. There was 
little overall profit progress, although we expect better profit growth this 
year as ingredients make a first contribution. The stock has already re-rated 
to reflect the upgrade in the quality of profits, ex-dairy, so there is less 
obvious re-rating upside from here. Our target price suggests 9% upside, but 
with a 4% yield, this keeps the stock in buy recommendation territory for now.

Our new forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are around 4% lower than before, largely 
reflecting a higher interest cost assumption, with some modest trim to EBIT. 
This in turn feeds through to a reduced target price of 600p (from 625p).
