Aaron Rodgers is on a run like almost none he has had in his career and 
suddenly it feels like he might be taking Green Bay to the Super Bowl.

All year people have talked about the decline of the NFL, suggesting the 
league isn’t the same because the quarterbacks are worse than in recent 
seasons. But 2016 ended with Tom Brady setting anNFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> record with 28 touchdowns and only two 
interceptions, Drew Brees threw for 5,000 yards once more, Matt Ryan had an MVP 
year and, in his last seven games, Rodgers has put up numbers that many 
quarterbacks would consider to be promising seasons by themselves.

In that time he’s thrown for 2,029 yards, 19 touchdowns and zero 
interceptions. Only once in that stretch has he finished a game with a 
quarterback rating below 116.7. Most important, the Packers have won all seven 
of those games, having scrambled from a 4-6 record in late November to becoming 
a team theDallas Cowboys <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dallas-cowboys> 
will not want to face next weekend.

Watching him rip apart the aggressive, dominating New York Giants defense as 
he didin Sunday’s 38-13 wildcard round victory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/08/nfl-playoffs-green-bay-packers-new-york-giants-game-report>
, it should be obvious that one of the NFL’s great quarterbacks is still great.

Yup. @AaronRodgers12 <https://twitter.com/AaronRodgers12> just threw ANOTHER 
Hail Mary.

UNBELIEVABLE. #GoPackGo <https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoPackGo?src=hash>

Despite a dismal start to Sunday’s game, he led the Packers to a touchdown 
late in the first-half by scrambling around as only he can, ducking pass 
rushers and spinning out of tackles before firing a pass into the end zone for 
a score. Then just before half-time he lobbed a long, Hail Mary pass from the 
50 that flew over the Giants defenders in the end zone and into the hands of 
Randall Cobb for a touchdown that stood out not only for the drama of the 
moment – which broke the Giants - but the way Rodgers made it look easy.

“An excellent, instinctive play,” Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said after the 
game.


Perhaps what struck home even more than the pass was the nonchalance with 
which Rodgers later described it – as if heaving the ball half the length of 
the field and having it evade a forest of defensive players is something he 
does daily.

“That’s three [completed Hail Marys] in the last calendar year or so,” he said 
with almost a shrug, referencing the game-tying throw in the playoffs against 
Arizona last January and the game-winner in Detroit in December of 2015.

Green Bay actually practices the play during their final walkthroughs the day 
before games. And while most quarterbacks seem to make their Hail Marys look 
like frantic heaves with little idea of where the ball will go, Rodgers 
actually appears to have a science for such a pass.

Is that possible?

Apparently so. Watch one of the hundreds of replays of his half-time pass to 
Cobb that will run in the coming days and see how the ball seemed to land 
exactly where Cobb was standing, just inside the end line. Observe, too, the 
way Cobb caught the pass as if he was the only player in the end zone, not one 
of 11 Packers and Giants who wound up in that tiny plot of grass to the side of 
the goalpost. This was a precision pass not some wild throw.

After the game, someone asked Rodgers if he had indeed calculated the exact 
way he was going to throw a pass most quarterbacks make by leaning back and 
throwing as hard as they can. For a moment he looked as if he was going to 
dismiss the idea by saying it was simply good fortune. But then he stopped, 
gazed in the distance for a second and appeared to realized that he couldn’t 
fool anyone by saying this pass was luck. It was anything but.

 “I was thinking pre-snap how I was going to throw the football,” he finally 
said. “I was trying to judge how far I was going to drop back but I threw it 
from the 50 and in this type of weather with that kind of height on the ball 
it’s difficult to throw it out of the end zone.”

A little later he added: “I think we are starting to believe that anytime the 
ball goes up there you got a chance.”

When you throw Hail Marys that you suspect you will complete then you are 
playing very, very well. On Sunday, Rodgers lost one of his favorite receivers, 
Jordy Nelson, after Nelson took a hit in the side and still he wound up 
completing passes to six other players and finished with 362 yards passing and 
four touchdowns. Nothing seems to bother him now. He is in a place few 
quarterbacks reach, no matter how great they are.

Yes, the Cowboys who await next Sunday, have had an amazing season and seem as 
balanced as any Dallas team in the last two decades, but do the Cowboys – with 
their rookie quarterback – feel comfortable knowing that the best of Aaron 
Rodgers is coming to town? He has brought the Packers to a place no one 
believed to be possible just seven weeks ago.

What’s to keep him from taking Green Bay all the way to the Super Bowl?

Fantasy player of the week

The Pittsburgh Steelers played their first playoff game with all of their four 
key offensive stars – quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, running back Le’Veon 
Bell, receiver Antonio Brown and center Maurkice Pouncey – healthy. It turns 
out the Steelers are very good if you put all four of them on the field at the 
same time. Evidence of this is the 367 yards they put up in Sunday’s 30-12 
trampling of Miami.

Steelers crush Dolphins in NFL wildcard playoff thanks to Bell and Brown

Who was the best on Sunday? That would be Bell who rumbled through the Dolphins
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/08/pittsburgh-steelers-miami-dolphins-nfl-playoffs-game-report>
 for a Pittsburgh postseason record 167 yards on 29 carries. On a frigid 
afternoon, Bell churned around Dolphins tacklers who came to look cold, weary 
and tired of trying to tackle him. In addition to breaking a Franco Harris 
record that had lasted for 38 years, Bell scored two touchdowns. Given he had 
just seven rushing scores this season, it was a very good day for him.

But was it Bell who did in the Dolphins first or receiver Antonio Brown? After 
all, Brown took two first-quarter passes from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger 
and turned them into long touchdown runs that seemed to break Miami barely 
eight minutes into the game. His first score went 50 yards, his second 62. He 
finished the day with five catches for 124 yards and the two touchdowns. Not a 
bad day either.

So it doesn’t matter if you played Bell or Brown on your playoff fantasy team 
you did well either way.

Videos of the week

If I never watch another minute of the NFL playoffs I will be thrilled to 
leave these two catches as my final memory of the 2017 postseason. The fact 
they are made by Seahawks receiver Paul Richardson, whose three-year 
professional career has been marred by a torn ACL, makes them all the more 
satisfying.

Richardson probably wouldn’t have been playing Saturday night against Detroit 
had the team’s No3 receiver, Tyler Lockett, not broken his leg in Week 16. And 
yet where would Seattle have been without him on Saturday? With 7:14 left in 
the first half of a scoreless game, a fourth and goal play broke apart and 
quarterback Russell Wilson desperately heaved a pass toward the end zone where 
Richardson someone managed to catch the ball one-handed with Detroit’s Tavon 
Wilson attached to his chest.

That he caught the ball with his left hand while hooking Wilson’s facemask 
with his right makes the catch even more spectacular…and illegal.

Then in the fourth quarter he did this:

The best part of all: Richardson told USA Today 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/seahawks/2017/01/07/seattle-seahawks-paul-richardson-touchdown-catch/96304828/>
 that he doesn’t even work on one-handed catches in practice. Saturday’s grabs 
were simply by instinct.

Stat of the week

50. The number of years the Detroit Lions have gone since winning a road 
playoff game. It’s a remarkable number. But perhaps not too surprising given 
that the Lions have only played 11 postseason games since 1957. Defensively 
they played well against Seattle on Saturday and might have had a better chance 
of winning had they been able to generate much of an offense. The 231 yards 
they put up did not allow them to get close.

Another statistic that worked against the Lions … Seattle have now won 10 
straight home playoff games.

 The Texans will continue to be led by Bill O’Brien ... for now. Photograph:

“I don’t know where they get that. There’s nothing to it. I got a chuckle out 
of that. I’m not going to fire him. We’re already talking about next year. If I 
were you, I wouldn’t repeat it because it’s false.” 

Given a normal time, in a year without his team’s quarterback instability, it 
would be odd for Houston owner Bob McNairtell the Houston Chronicle 
<http://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Texans-owner-Bob-McNair-denies-reports-that-coach-10842642.php>
 immediately after a playoff victory that he is keeping coach Bill O’Brien. But 
these don’t seem to be normal times in football. If Jim Caldwell’s job could be 
in jeopardy after putting up the best three-year run as Lions coach in decades, 
then O’Brien’s could as well in a division-winning season.

Rumors grew last week that O’Brien might be fired even if the Texans beat the 
Raiders on Sunday. There was evenan NFL.com report 
<http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000770753/article/coachneedy-teams-are-waiting-to-learn-status-of-bill-obrien?campaign=Twitter_atn>
 that said teams with coaching vacancies suspected that O’Brien could soon be 
leaving the Texans. Houston has finished 9-7 in each of his three seasons with 
the team, which isn’t terrible considering the problems the team has had 
finding a franchise quarterback and this year’s season-ending injury to 
defensive star JJ Watt. Firing O’Brien would hardly fix whatever perceived 
problems Houston has.

The Texans dominance of the Raiders, albeit against third-string quarterback 
Connor Cook, would appear to be enough to allow O’Brien to stay no matter what 
happens next Saturday night at New England.
