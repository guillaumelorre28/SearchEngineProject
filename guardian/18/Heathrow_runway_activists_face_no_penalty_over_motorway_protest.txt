Twelve campaigners will face no penalty after staging a protest near Heathrow 
against airport expansion.

A small group of people ran on to the M4 and A4 roads and lay down in front of 
oncoming traffic

, causing a temporary disruption on 19 November. Fifteen of them, aged between 
21 and 67, were charged with wilful obstruction of the highway.

At a hearing at Ealing magistrates court on Thursday, 12 of them pleaded 
guilty and were given a conditional discharge. They were told they would each 
have to pay a victim surcharge and prosecution costs of £105.

The court heard their motivations were fears about air pollution potentially 
caused by a third runway at Heathrow, the urgency of climate change and social 
inequality.

The district judge Stephen Day pointed out they were all of good character and 
had no previous convictions.


The prosecutor, Richard Doolan, said the protesters were joined together by 
plastic tubing and some of the defendants had to be cut free. They were removed 
from the road in less than half an hour, he said.

The court heard that police knew a protest had been organised. 


Those sentenced after pleading guilty were Madeleine Ellis-Petersen, 24, of 
Ealing; Joanne Louise Bodimeade, 28, of Lambeth; Alexis Delage, 25, of 
Lewisham; Tom Venner-Woodcock, 29, of Southwark; and Tess Lotter, 30, of 
Camden, all inLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>. Also sentenced 
were Antoine Thalmann, 25, and Henry Owen, 23, both of Oxford; Simon Bramwell, 
44, of Stroud, Gloucestershire; Ian Bray, 49, of Kirklees, West Yorkshire; 
Graham Lewis, 53, of Wells, Somerset; Thomas Harford, 26, of Bristol; and Sibi 
Moore, 21, of Sidmouth, Devon.


Lewis wore a white shirt in court which said: “Plane crazy runway hell.” He 
also intervened at one point in proceedings to say he was a “trainee Buddha”.

Speaking after the sentencing, Ellis-Petersen said: “It’s a great result 
within the realms of what we were expecting.”


She added: “This is not the end. We will continue to fight until the 
government takes meaningful action to tackle climate change, and that includes 
not building a third runway.”

Asked if she would stage a similar protest again, she said: “If that’s what it 
takes.”


The court heard the defendants were involved in voluntary work with charities 
and in the community.

Earlier, Isabelle Anderson, 30, of Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, and Sophia 
Lysaczanko, 28, of Haringey in London, pleaded not guilty to wilful 
obstruction. They will both go on trial at Uxbridge magistrates court, Anderson 
on 6 February and Lysaczanko the following day.


Margaret Charnley, 67, of Bristol, was not at the hearing because she was 
excused from attending, but a lawyer indicated a plea of not guilty.
