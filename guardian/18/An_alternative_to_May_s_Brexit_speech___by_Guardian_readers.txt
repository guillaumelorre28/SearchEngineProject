Theresa May outlines her Brexit objectives in a speech at Lancaster House on 
Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/17/theresa-mays-brexit-speech-key-clues-to-look-out-for>
, in which she is expected to confirm that Britain will be leaving the EU’s 
single market.

Theresa May to confirm UK exit from EU single market

The previewed speech has been met with approval from pro-Brexit figures and 
newspapers, warnings from business leaders, and concern from leading Remain 
campaigners.

We asked our readers to deliver an alternative to May’s anticipated speech. We 
heard, largely, from Remain voters, who felt that the government’s likely 
adoption of a “hard Brexit” is a betrayal of the 48% who voted to stay in the 
EU - not to mention the Conservative party’s own manifesto, which called for 
Britain to remain in the single market.

Below, we outline eight increasingly unlikely alternative objectives, as 
suggested by our readers.


1) Keep Britain’s options open - and consult parliament

We will explore all options including continuing membership of EEA/EFTA to 
seek a balance between immigration control and access to single market. The 
referendum result did not give detailed policy direction and this needs to be 
the subject of detailed parliamentary scrutiny and debate.

2) Stay in the single market

In the referendum we did not vote to leave the single market, indeed Vote 
Leave promised we would not do so, as did the Tory manifesto in the 2015 
election. We did not vote to leave the customs union. We did not vote to trade 
under WTO rules, or for a decade of compromised trade. We did not vote to 
reduce the value of our currency, to lose sterling’s reserve status, to lose 
our Triple A rating. We did not vote to be poorer.

Britain’s first priority should be about how this decision affects the lives 
of Eu citizens. British and other EU state citizens are all EU citizens with 
equal rights today. People from all over have moved to live in another EU state 
to live, work, marry and live their lives with wider horizons. Britain chooses 
to leave and therefore should immediately guarantee the rights of those from 
the EU who contribute to the UK economy

We need another referendum once the terms of our Brexit are decided, before 
article 50 is activated. If Brexit is the right path then a second referendum 
can only reinforce our resolve. If it is a mistake, then we need the 
opportunity to turn back having evaluated the facts and exposed the lies.

5) Acknowledge migration’s importance to the UK

We now admit that we failed to address issues within our control - ensuring 
that all UK residents were accounted for, providing resources to address the 
needs of areas of high migration, and policing the minimum wage. But our 
analysis shows that nearly all migration is essential to the economy and also 
to ensuring adequate social care provision.

 Should May go into substantive detail about Britain’s negotiation intentions?

She should give precise details of all the major changes which will occur when 
we leave the EU, as she should have done within a month of her appointment last 
year. Her indecision and secrecy has already caused much needless uncertainty 
for the country, and worry for EU citizens who work here.

7) Delay the triggering of Article 50

Only a narrow margin voted to leave, we must proceed cautiously and take the 
time to research exactly what people thought they were voting for and how their 
wishes can best be delivered. We must also acknowledge the concerns of those 
who voted to remain as well as legal residents who were not entitled to a vote 
but who will be profoundly affected by the change.


The initial target date for invoking Article 50 does not, on further 
reflection, give us enough time to consider how we will restructure our economy 
and political system once we have left the EU.
