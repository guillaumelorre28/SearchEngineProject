In the history of rap beefs there is often one definitive track that ends the 
dispute because it is too crushing to come back from. A song such asFuck Wit’ 
Dre Day <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMjLs8nsukM>, which saw Dr Dre and 
Snoop Dogg take Easy-E to task; or Jay Z’s salty dissThe Takeover 
<https://vimeo.com/12125680>, which took Nas apart in 2001.

Now Drake <https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake> seems to have landed a 
killer blow in his feud with Meek Mill, the rapper who accused him of using a 
ghostwriter, sparking a war of words on Twitter, Instagram and, now, in the 
studio.

Drake responded to Meek Mill’s accusations with Charged Up 
<http://pitchfork.com/news/60520-drake-shares-meek-mill-response-charged-up-cha-cha-remix-on-beats-1-radio-show/>
, which he premiered on his October’s Very Own radio show on Beats 1. Meek Mill 
was due to retort with a track on Monday’s Funk Master Flex show, but it never 
materialised.

Early on Wednesday the Toronto rapper released another track, Back to Back 
Freestyle, in which he pointed out Meek Mill’s lack of response and mocked 
Mill’s relationship with the considerably more successfulNicki Minaj 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj>.

Choice lines include: 

You love her, then you gotta give the world to her/Is that a world tour or 
your girl’s tour?

A dig at Mill’s appearances on Nicki Minaj’s tour, where he is very much 
second banana to his girlfriend.

Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers/You gettin’ bodied by a singin’ 
nigga

Drake refers to his own perceived softness and uses it as a weapon: he’s still 
coming out on top in this dispute.

Make sure you hit him with the prenup/Then tell that man to ease up


Another reference to Meek Mill’s relationship with Minaj and the fact she’s 
worth considerably more money than him.

The ball is well and truly in Meek Mill’s court.
