FULL-TIME: USA 1-0 France

And that’s it. The US edge to victory and they now need a single point from 
their final game to progress. But they’re all but through anyhow. Not a vintage 
performance but it should be remembered that they beat the No3 team in the 
world tonight. The US were excellent just after half-time but they had Hope 
Solo to thank as sloppy defending nearly cost them the victory in the final 15 
minutes.

86 min: Heath has shown a particular fondness for stepovers today - maybe it’s 
something in the Brazilian air. She gets a few cheers from the home crowd for 
that anyway, and it also relives some pressure for the US as she wastes time in 
the France half. The US lurch towards victory.

81 min: Another chance for France. And that rhymes. Krieger is on fire! Only 
at the wrong end, nearly volleying a brilliant own goal home. An interesting 
Olympic debut.

79 min: Solo to the rescue, saving at her feet after a powerful header from 
the French. One of the most impressive things about her as a keeper is that she 
often has little to do for long stretches as her talented team-mates control 
games but keeps concentration when the danger does come.

76 min: A mini revival from the French as the game meanders to an end but the 
US are still in control. If France win it, it will be through a lapse in US 
concentration or a moment of French brilliance.

74 min: Heath was down injured but seems to OK to continue. Kriege has her 
first touch in Olympic football with a rush forward but France repel the 
threat. A scary moment for the US as Renard finds herself in acres of space but 
the Frenchwoman fails to connect with her header. Poor marking from Long.

66 min: A well-deserved goal for the US, who have been by far the better side 
in the second-half. Lloyd had been quiet so far this game but you can’t keep a 
good player down for long.

GOAL! USA 1-0 France (Lloyd 64)

The clock has stopped working so I am not guessing what time it is. Let’s say 
... the 12th minute? Anyway, the US have a free-kick to the left of goal - it 
takes a diving header from France to clear. It doesn’t go far though and after 
Heath hits the post the ball ricochets across the face of goal for Lloyd to 
stab home.

country ... the mythical place know as the US half. And they get there. But 
then the US turf them out. France really have faded as an attacking force in

52 min: Canada won the earlier game today, beating Zimbabwe 3-1. They could 
have lent us one of the goals for this match, it’s pretty dour stuff at the 
moment.

46 min: And we’re back. US will be hoping to improve on a fractured first 
half. They were nowhere near their best. They do start with a corner early 
though. Heath wafts it in the general direction of nowhere however.

Half-time: USA 0-0 France

So, the half comes to the end. There have been moments of excitement but 
mainly from the French. The US have done well on free-kicks but Hope Solo has 
kept them in it with a great save as the half wound down.

44 min: Crystal Dunn wins a throw in after some trickery down the right. Lloyd 
collects it inside the area but she was backing into her marker. Or the ref 
says she was. I didn’t see what was wrong there - the ref hasn’t been great so 
far.

Let them mock Solo, as long as they fear Solo.

38 min: Long puts in a heavy challenge in midfield, the kind of action you may 
see outside a particularly rough Belo Horizonte bar of a Friday night. France 
win the free-kick but it comes to nothing.

35 min: The US are owning the free-kick count at the moment. Heath has had 
around 576 in this half alone. This time it’s on the left of the area. It’s a 
nice ball that drifts across the face of goal but no US players choose to 
attack it and the French watch it drift to safety.

30 min: A chance for the US. They win a free-kick on the edge of the area. 
Heath will take ... it’s a good effort that the French keeper touches over the 
bar. The ref doesn’t give the corner though - the US are frustrated, Bouhaddi 
definitely got a touch.

The Americans have fallen for the same, rather obvious, trap in the space of a

butterflies are venomous, I’ve never eaten one. I know you can get venomous

17 min: Renard steals in like a fox to send a thumping header at the US goal. 
Solo tips the ball on to the bar and out for a corner. The keeper than flaps a 
bit on the resulting set-piece but US clear - it’s a messy start from the 
defending champions.

12 min: Some nice work from Diani at the corner flag and it takes some stout 
defending from Sauerbrunn to kill the danger. The Zika chants are getting 
louder for Solo. Surely this will become one of the sounds of the 2016 
Olympics, expect an autotune remix to be released in time for Christmas.

3 min: Hope Solo has her first goal-kick and, yep, she gets the “Zika!” chant. 
And she’s then booed the next time she gets the ball. This is tiresome or 
amusing depending on your point of view: but who said football fans were 
blessed with innovative comedic techniques? For her part, Solo has laughed off 
the chants - and they’re good natured enough. She’s been around enough that I 
doubt it will affect her.

The last time these teams met at the Olympics in 2012 it got a little spicy. 
France leapt out to a 2-0 lead before the US fought back for a 4-2 victory. 
Again, a warning that this is a tough fixture for the Americans

France will be no pushovers for the US. They are currently ranked No3 in the 
world, a position they’ve held since 2014. They finished fourth at the 2011 
World Cup and reached the quarter-finals in 2015, and only lost on penalties to 
the strong German team. They also finished fourth at the 2012 Olympics.

They’ve started this campaign pretty well too - they beat Colombia 4-0 in 
their opener. As for their record against the US, the teams played each other 
back in March, with the Americans winning 1-0 but it took a very late goal to 
secure the victory. In 2015 the teams met twice with the teams winning one each.

Our venue tonight is Belo Horizonte, which is 210 miles north of Rio so don’t 
expect any rowdy dressage fans to turn up and start heckling anyone. Pesky 
dressage fans! It’s also the venue of Brazil’s infamous defeat to Germany in 
the 2014 men’s World Cup semi-final, where the hosts were thrashed 7-1 by the 
eventual world champions.

There are two changes for the US, Whitney Engen is in for Julie Johnston, 
while Crystal Dunn comes in for Mallory Pugh. Both the players who have been 
replaced have minor injuries and are fit enough to take their places on the 
bench.

Tom will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how the US got on in their 
opening game:

Carli Lloyd began this Olympic tournament as she ended the last one: scoring 
in an American victory.

The match-winner in the final at Wembley four years ago needed only nine 
minutes to find the net as the US eased to victory over New Zealand in their 
opening group game. Always composed and in control, the performance was 
efficient rather than thrilling, as routine as could be for the favourites.

The modest crowd in Belo Horizonte seemed to find its greatest enjoyment in 
taunting Hope Solo, the US goalkeeper,with boos and apparent chants of “Zika!” 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3704740/If-village-forgets-pack-repellent-come-Hope-Solo-shows-Zika-proof-arsenal-s-packing-Rio-Olympics.html>
when she had the ball. That was a reference to Solo’s social media posts in the 
run-up to the Games in which she posed with various anti-mosquito products.

Solo seemed to take the chants with good humor. “It’s the Brazilians, they 
love soccer, they love football, it’s part of the culture so I expect it, but 
they’re having fun. I mean, at least it’s loud in the stadium – I’d rather have 
that than hear a needle drop,” she told NBC Sports after the game.

And that’s it. The US edge to victory and they now need a single point from 
their final game to progress. But they’re all but through anyhow. Not a vintage 
performance but it should be remembered that they beat the No3 team in the 
world tonight. The US were excellent just after half-time but they had Hope 
Solo to thank as sloppy defending nearly cost them the victory in the final 15 
minutes.
 A celebratory team huddle. Photograph: Eugenio Savio/AP  
90 min +2: Morgan wins another free-kick wasting more precious time, she is 
taking several for the team here.
 
90 min +1:  Three minutes of added time. France come forward but Alex Morgan 
draws the foul and wins a free-kick and runs down the clock.
 
90 min: ANOTHER corner for France. Solo is having to stay alive with very 
little aerial assistance from her defenders. Press comes on for Klingenberg.
 
88 min: The US are hacking their way to safety here with some clearances of an 
agricultural nature. “Tobin Heath: Always fond of stepovers,” says Beau Dure. 
“The most Brazilian US player ever.”
 
86 min: Heath has shown a particular fondness for stepovers today - maybe it’s 
something in the Brazilian air. She gets a few cheers from the home crowd for 
that anyway, and it also relives some pressure for the US as she wastes time in 
the France half. The US lurch towards victory.
 
83 min: Lloyd off and Horan on. And another corner for France and nearly a 
goal. Again. The US fail to mark their woman again and it’s another free header 
for France that Solo has to stoop to save.

81 min: Another chance for France. And that rhymes. Krieger is on fire! Only 
at the wrong end, nearly volleying a brilliant own goal home. An interesting 
Olympic debut.
 
79 min: Solo to the rescue, saving at her feet after a powerful header from 
the French. One of the most impressive things about her as a keeper is that she 
often has little to do for long stretches as her talented team-mates control 
games but keeps concentration when the danger does come.
 
76 min: A mini revival from the French as the game meanders to an end but the 
US are still in control. If France win it, it will be through a lapse in US 
concentration or a moment of French brilliance.
 
74 min: Heath was down injured but seems to OK to continue. Kriege has her 
first touch in Olympic football with a rush forward but France repel the 
threat. A scary moment for the US as Renard finds herself in acres of space but 
the Frenchwoman fails to connect with her header. Poor marking from Long.
 
71 min: Dunn is off and is replaced by the Olympic debutant Krieger. 
 
70 min: The atmosphere has lifted in the stadium after the goal. They’re not 
even Zika-ing Hope Solo anymore although that’s mainly because she hasn’t 
touched the ball in a while.
 
68 min: Crystal Dunn is booked - the only blemish on a good half for the US.
 
66 min: A well-deserved goal for the US, who have been by far the better side 
in the second-half. Lloyd had been quiet so far this game but you can’t keep a 
good player down for long.
 
The clock has stopped working so I am not guessing what time it is. Let’s say 
... the 12th minute? Anyway, the US have a free-kick to the left of goal - it 
takes a diving header from France to clear. It doesn’t go far though and after 
Heath hits the post the ball ricochets across the face of goal for Lloyd to 
stab home.
 Carli Lloyd doesn’t miss from those. Photograph: Mariana Bazo/Reuters  Lloyd 
is mobbed by her team-mates. Photograph: Eugenio Savio/AP  
62 min: Lovely ball from Crystal Dunn through to Morgan but she takes it too 
far round the keeper and shoots into the side netting.
 
60 min: The France mount an epic expedition to get to so-far undiscovered 
country ... the mythical place know as the US half. And they get there. But 
then the US turf them out. France really have faded as an attacking force in 
the second period.
 
57 min: The US are starting to exploit cracks in the France defense now. Heath 
nicks a ball through for Brian who is free and clear just outside the area but 
Bouhaddi rushes out to clear.
 
55 min: Carli Lloyd thinks she’s got a break but she’s offside. Heath has a 
wander around the midfield, complete with some stepovers for our entertainment.
 
52 min: Canada won the earlier game today, beating Zimbabwe 3-1. They could 
have lent us one of the goals for this match, it’s pretty dour stuff at the 
moment.
 
49 min: If this game was winningcornersbutnotdoingmuchelseball instead of 
football the US would be cruising this. As it happens they continue to plough 
on at 0-0 after another uninspiring corner.
 
46 min: And we’re back. US will be hoping to improve on a fractured first 
half. They were nowhere near their best. They do start with a corner early 
though. Heath wafts it in the general direction of nowhere however.
 
So, the half comes to the end. There have been moments of excitement but 
mainly from the French. The US have done well on free-kicks but Hope Solo has 
kept them in it with a great save as the half wound down.
 
44 min: Crystal Dunn wins a throw in after some trickery down the right. Lloyd 
collects it inside the area but she was backing into her marker. Or the ref 
says she was. I didn’t see what was wrong there - the ref hasn’t been great so 
far.
 
41 min: Hope Solo makes a great save. Henry - not that one - exploits another 
sloppy pass from the US and Solo has to be at her best to keep the ball out. 
Let them mock Solo, as long as they fear Solo.
 
38 min: Long puts in a heavy challenge in midfield, the kind of action you may 
see outside a particularly rough Belo Horizonte bar of a Friday night. France 
win the free-kick but it comes to nothing.
 
35 min: The US are owning the free-kick count at the moment. Heath has had 
around 576 in this half alone. This time it’s on the left of the area. It’s a 
nice ball that drifts across the face of goal but no US players choose to 
attack it and the French watch it drift to safety.
 
33 min: Cadamuro is taking plenty of long shots today, not of them 
threatening. The US are playing their way back into the game but it’s still 
been France’s match so far.
 
30 min: A chance for the US. They win a free-kick on the edge of the area. 
Heath will take ... it’s a good effort that the French keeper touches over the 
bar. The ref doesn’t give the corner though - the US are frustrated, Bouhaddi 
definitely got a touch.
 
27 min: Delie in space AGAIN. And it’s on the right of the US defense again. 
The Americans have fallen for the same, rather obvious, trap in the space of a 
few minutes. They’re lucky Delie’s shot is as venomous as a butterfly (unless 
butterflies are venomous, I’ve never eaten one. I know you can get venomous 
caterpillars so ...)
 
24 min: Délie finds herself with half of Brazil to run into - and Brazil is a 
pretty big place - but she pauses too long and the US get back to snuff out the 
danger. The US are looking as stretched as a bad facelift at the moment though.
 
22 min: Lloyd has been sloppy today. She gives the ball away in her own half 
and has to rely on her defense to help her out. A long-shot from Cadamuro flies 
wide.
 
20 min: Jill Ellis, who I always want to call Jill Scott for some reason, 
tries to gee her players up on the sideline.
 
17 min: Renard steals in like a fox to send a thumping header at the US goal. 
Solo tips the ball on to the bar and out for a corner. The keeper than flaps a 
bit on the resulting set-piece but US clear - it’s a messy start from the 
defending champions.
 
14 min: Carli Lloyd, the world player of the year, falls over as she floats to 
the edge of the area. Even the best of us have off days.
 
12 min: Some nice work from Diani at the corner flag and it takes some stout 
defending from Sauerbrunn to kill the danger. The Zika chants are getting 
louder for Solo. Surely this will become one of the sounds of the 2016 
Olympics, expect an autotune remix to be released in time for Christmas.
 
9 min: Free-kick to the US. Heath will take around 45 yards out. It zips past 
everyone and into the arms of Bouhaddi in the French goal.
 
6 min: France have had the early possession so far, the US are happy to sit 
back for now. They’re sometimes slow starters in tournaments anyway and it 
wasn’t until late in the 2015 World Cup that they blossomed.
 
3 min: Hope Solo has her first goal-kick and, yep, she gets the “Zika!” chant. 
And she’s then booed the next time she gets the ball. This is tiresome or 
amusing depending on your point of view: but who said football fans were 
blessed with innovative comedic techniques? For her part, Solo has laughed off 
the chants - and they’re good natured enough. She’s been around enough that I 
doubt it will affect her.
 
1 min: And we’re off. The US are in white, the French in blue. There’s a 
decent crowd in the stadium even if it’s far from a packed house.
 
The last time these teams met at the Olympics in 2012 it got a little spicy. 
France leapt out to a 2-0 lead before the US fought back for a 4-2 victory. 
Again, a warning that this is a tough fixture for the Americans
 
France will be no pushovers for the US. They are currently ranked No3 in the 
world, a position they’ve held since 2014. They finished fourth at the 2011 
World Cup and reached the quarter-finals in 2015, and only lost on penalties to 
the strong German team. They also finished fourth at the 2012 Olympics.

They’ve started this campaign pretty well too - they beat Colombia 4-0 in 
their opener. As for their record against the US, the teams played each other 
back in March, with the Americans winning 1-0 but it took a very late goal to 
secure the victory. In 2015 the teams met twice with the teams winning one each.
 
Our venue tonight is Belo Horizonte, which is 210 miles north of Rio so don’t 
expect any rowdy dressage fans to turn up and start heckling anyone. Pesky 
dressage fans! It’s also the venue of Brazil’s infamous defeat to Germany in 
the 2014 men’s World Cup semi-final, where the hosts were thrashed 7-1 by the 
eventual world champions.
 
And it’s a big day for Hope Solo as she looks forward to  being mocked by the 
crowdher 200th cap for the US team. She’s also the first women’s goalkeeper - 
make that ANY goalkeeper - to make 200 international appearances.
