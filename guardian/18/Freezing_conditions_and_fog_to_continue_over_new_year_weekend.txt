The thick fog that has caused travel chaos in southern England, with hundreds 
of flights cancelled and many more delayed, is expected to continue into 
Saturday, forecasters have warned.

The Met Office warned people to be aware of the risk posed by the freezing 
fog, with driving conditions likely to be difficult and more delays to air 
travel possible.

That came after the UK’s biggest airport, Heathrow, reportedly said 119 
flights had been cancelled, London City airport reported about 180 flight 
cancellations by Friday evening andStansted airport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/stansted-airport> said 33 flights had been 
grounded. There were also cancellations at Gatwick, Manchester and Luton 
airports.

Earlier on Friday, 17 people were injured when a coach veered off a motorway 
slip road in Oxfordshire and overturned

.

“Areas of fog have persisted in places through Friday and are expected to 
become more widespread and freezing in places again on Friday night and into 
Saturday morning,” the Met Office said.


The south-east of England was expected to be the worst hit but forecasters 
later said the south-west of England was also likely be affected.

“Fog and freezing fog patches with visibility less than 100 metres in places 
are expected to become more widespread again during Friday night. The fog 
patches are expected to slowly clear from the north and west of the area during 
the second half of the night, although some fog is likely to persist across 
parts of southern and south-eastern England into Saturday morning. The 
remaining fog should clear from all parts by late Saturday morning.”

London City airport said there had been “significant disruption to flights all 
day”. A spokeswoman said: “Disruption is expected to last all evening and 
passengers are advised to check their flight status with their airline before 
they travel.”

There were delays across all arrivals and departures at Luton on Friday 
evening, though the airport reported only two cancellations. “We advise anyone 
looking to travel tonight or tomorrow morning to check the status of their 
flight with their airline and to check in as normal unless the airline confirms 
the flight is cancelled.”

While Stansted had seen more cancellations, a spokesman said all flights were 
“scheduled to operate on Saturday”. A spokesman forHeathrow airport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/heathrow-airport> told the BBC that the 
119 cancellations may be followed by more.

Ferry services to the Isle of Wight were also cancelled, with lengthy delays 
on some of those running, thanks to foggy conditions in the Solent.

A spokesman for the operator Wightlink blamed fog and low tide for the 
suspension of the service between Lymington and Yarmouth.

He said passengers had boarded the ferry in Yarmouth before the captain made 
the decision that it was not safe to travel, so they disembarked. “We are just 
keeping an eye on the weather at the moment to see how soon we can actually 
start sailing again.”

Services between Portsmouth and Fishbourne had delays of up to two and a half 
hours because of the restricted visibility. Red Funnel services between 
Southampton and East Cowes were delayed by up to an hour.

Brighton and Hove Albion’s home match against Cardiff City was called off 
because of the poor visibility. The club tweeted: “Match postponed due to fog: 
The match as been called off after consultation between match officials and 
both clubs.”

A statement on the club’s website <http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/> added: 
“Further information, including details of the rearranged game, will be 
confirmed in due course.”

Fulham FC’s match against Reading was also abandoned because of the fog.

UPDATE: The decision to call the match off was apparently due to the fact that 
neither linesman was able to see the full width of the pitch.
