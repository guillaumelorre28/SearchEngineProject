Just months after its spectacular design 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/china-straddling-floating-bus-beat-traffic-jams>
 was unveiled, the Transit Explore Bus had its inaugural run this week on 300 
metres of specially constructed test track in Qinhuangdao, a city in the 
north-east Hebei province,the BBC reported

Bus that moves above traffic jams: model unveiled in China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/26/transit-explore-bus-above-road-traffic-china-video>
The vehicle, which goes up to 60km/h (37mph), runs on tracks with passenger 
spaces standing two metres above the road so that two lanes of cars can pass 
undisturbed underneath, helping to alleviate thenotorious traffic jams of 
China’s biggest cities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/aug/25/china-mega-jams-coal>.

“The biggest advantage is that the bus will save lots of road space,” Song 
Youzhou, the project’s chief engineer,told Xinhua 
<http://www.china.org.cn/china/2016-05/26/content_38538976.htm>, China’s 
official news agency. He said the vehicle cost about a fifth as much as 
underground transit systems and could be constructed more quickly.

Song said in May that the buses, which are 21 metres long and more than seven 
metres wide, could transport up to 1,400 passengers. Several units can be 
attached to one another. One TEB could replace 40 conventional buses, he said. 
It is not known how the system would coexist with lorries and taller vehicles.

The world learned of the road-straddling bus when a model was showcased at a 
technology expo in Beijing in May. It generated enormous excitement in a 
country where traffic jams have grown as the country overtook the US to become
the largest car market on earth

 in 2009.

It was noted that a similar design – also by Song – had previously cropped up 
at the event in 2010.
