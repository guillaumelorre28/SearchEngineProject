The former Philippine dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, has been given a hero’s 
burial with military honours, a deeply controversial move three decades after 
he was ousted in a “People Power” revolution.


The ceremony began with a 21-gun salute as soldiers in parade dress and 
ceremonial rifles stood to attention at the “Cemetery of Heroes” in Manila, 
after his body was secretly flown to the venue in an apparent effort to avoid 
protests.

The supreme court said last week

 that Marcos, who ruled the nation for two decades until millions of people 
took to the streets in the 1986 military-backed uprising, could be buried at 
the heroes’ cemetery.

The decision, endorsing a recommendation from controversial President Rodrigo 
Duterte <https://www.theguardian.com/world/rodrigo-duterte>, outraged many 
opponents of the Marcos regime who said it would whitewash the dictator’s many 
crimes.

The surprise move by the Marcos family and the government to bury him so 
quickly after the court verdict, with appeals still to be heard, caused further 
outrage.

Barry Gutierrez, counsel for the anti-Marcos court petitioners, said the 
burial was illegal because of the outstanding appeals.

“It’s not really surprising that this is happening. Marcos flouted the law 
when he was still alive, and even at his burial, he is still breaking the law,” 
Gutierrez told AFP.

Police only announced that Marcos’s body had been flown to the cemetery 
shortly before the ceremony began, leaving opponents who had been planning 
rallies flat-footed.

“We are shocked and angered,” Gutierrez said.

Thousands of riot police and soldiers guarded the perimeter of the cemetery, 
but there were no protesters.

Journalists who rushed to the cemetery were barred from entering. However 
reporters were able to view the ceremony with long camera lenses from outside.

Marcos ruled the Philippines <https://www.theguardian.com/world/philippines> 
for two decades until forced into US exile by the revolution, a largely 
peaceful event that inspired democracy movements throughout Asia and around the 
world.


Marcos, along with his infamously flamboyant wife Imelda and their cronies, 
plundered up to $10bn from state coffers during his rule, according to 
government investigators and historians.

The dictator also oversaw widespread human rights abuses to maintain his 
control of the country and enable his plundering, with thousands of people 
killed and tortured, previous Philippine governments said.

Anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International in 2004 named Marcos the 
second most corrupt leader of all time, behind Indonesian dictator Suharto.

The Philippines’ foreign debt went from $2.67bn in 1972, when Marcos declared 
martial law, to $28.2bn in 1986, according to the World Bank.

After Marcos died in Hawaii in 1989, his family began a successful political 
comeback and tried repeatedly to have him buried at the heroes’ cemetery, where 
other presidents and celebrated military figures are interred.

Imelda became a congresswoman and fended off all corruption charges against 
her.

Two of her children established themselves as influential politicians. 
Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jnr, was the more successful, becoming a senator 
before almost winning the vice presidency this year.

However previous presidents had refused to allow the burial in the heroes’ 
cemetery because of Marcos’s crimes, so the family kept the preserved body in a 
glass casket at his home in the northern province of Ilocos Norte.

The family’s fortunes changed with the election of Duterte, a longtime ally of 
the Marcos family, as president in May this year.

He said Marcos deserved to be buried at the heroes’ cemetery based on the fact 
he had been a president and a veteran of the second world war.

Duterte also said he owed loyalty to the family because his father served in 
the Marcos government and the family had helped fund his election campaign.
