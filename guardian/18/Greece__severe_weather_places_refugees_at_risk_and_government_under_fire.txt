Thousands of refugees are enduring freezing temperatures in flimsy tents 
across Greece as a result of thearctic blast that has swept across Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/09/several-die-poland-european-cold-weather-snow-continues>
, triggering criticism abroad and putting the government on the defensive.

In a robust exchange in parliament the migration policy minister, Yannis 
Mouzalas, conceded that people trapped in the country were living in appalling 
conditions exacerbated by severe cold weather and unprecedented snowfall 
nationwide.

“The situation in the hot spots is very bad,” he said. “Conditions on the 
islands are awful.”

The government has faced severe criticism over conditions in reception 
centres, which pose health and safety risks in the depths of winter.

Footage of tents weighed down by snow in the vastly overcrowded Moria camp in 
Lesbos has elicited particular consternation – and embarrassment for Mouzalas, 
who only days ago insisted that in light of government preparations there would 
be no refugees living in the cold. Reports of illness among elderly and infirm 
refugees have been rife, with agencies attributing outbreaks of pneumonia and 
flu to the lack of adequate shelter.

On Monday the images drew a sharp rebuke from the European commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission>. “The situation is 
untenable,” said a spokeswoman, Natasha Bertaud. “But we also have to be clear 
… that ensuring adequate reception conditions in Greece is a responsibility of 
Greek authorities.”

Temperatures have plunged to –5C on Lesbos, where authorities have struggled 
to cope with refugee numbers that surpassed capacity long ago. In other parts of
Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, including the southern 
island of Crete, the cold snap has seen temperatures drop to an unprecedented 
–14C. In the Attica region surrounding Athens – where efforts have been under 
way to place people in rented apartments – sub-zero temperatures were also 
recorded with snow blanketing ancient monuments.

The unusually cold readings are expected to continue through to Thursday.

On Tuesday, a flight carrying Mouzalas to Lesbos, where the United Nations 
refugee agency, the UNHCR, is leading efforts to move people into hotels, was 
turned back because of the bad weather.

“Efforts are under way to move people as quickly as possible into hotels,” the 
island’s mayor, Spyros Galinos, told the Guardian. “I’ve not seen so much snow, 
ever. Electricity supplies have been knocked out. There are villages that are 
isolated, without light or heating or running water. It’s difficult for 
everyone.”

An estimated 62,000 migrants and refugees have been stranded in Greece 
following the closure of borders by countries further north and Europe’s deal 
with Turkey to curb flows last March. About 10,000 of those are trapped on the 
Aegean islands, including Lesbos.

Although the number of arrivals has dropped dramatically since sea patrols 
were stepped up, more than 180,000 people have managed to reach Greece since 
March. Official figures released on Tuesday showed 5,491 refugees on Lesbos 
alone. Moria, the island’s main facility, was built to house less than half 
that number. The government’s migration spokesman, Giorgos Kyritsis, said fewer 
than 1,000 refugees were still living in tents on the islands.

“The burden has to be reduced,” said Galinos. “Refugees have to be moved 
inland to other centres on the mainland.”

In northern Greece, where the deep freeze worsened at the weekend, the plight 
of refugees living in tents in abandoned industrial warehouses was further 
complicated by water and electricity cuts.

NGOs attributed the chaos to the absence of a national response plan, saying 
despite warnings of bitterly cold weather the state had been woefully 
ill-prepared.

But international organisations also said the shocking images highlighted 
Europe’s inhumane policies towards refugees and migrants.

“What we are seeing on the islands is the manifestation of the way Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is failing to provide dignity 
for some of the world’s most vulnerable,” said Panos Navrozidis, country 
director of the International Rescue Committee in Greece. “It is imperative 
that people are moved off the Greek islands. The IRC warned of these 
life-threatening conditions months ago yet still now with this weather we face 
a life-or-death situation.”

With resources stretched to breaking point in a nation itself dealing with 
economic and social crisis, the beleaguered government has appealed to other EU 
member states to expedite the process of taking in asylum seekers. Under an 
emergency relocation plan, agreed as part of the EU-Turkey deal, the 28-member 
bloc vowed to accept 63,302 refugees from Greece. To date only 7,280 have been 
relocated from the country, according to European commission data released this 
week.

Brawls between rival ethnic groups, attacks by far-right xenophobes, and 
frustration and uncertainty over what lies ahead have exacerbated tensions in 
camps.

In September, thousands were forced to flee Moria after members of Greece’s 
neo-fascist Golden Dawn partyset fire to the facility 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/thousand-flee-as-blaze-sweeps-through-moria-refugee-camp-in-greece>
.

In what it described as “an extremely urgent appeal”, the anti-racist group 
Keerfa said government-run installations in Athens, including a former military 
barracks at Malakasa, had to be closed immediately because hundreds of 
detainees, among them children, toddlers and disabled people were “literally 
freezing”.
