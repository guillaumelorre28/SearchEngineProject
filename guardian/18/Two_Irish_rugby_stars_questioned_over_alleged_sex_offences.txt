about the same incident. A third man was also arrested.

on BBC Northern Ireland. In a statement, the PSNI said: “Police arrested two 
men aged 24 and one man aged 23 on Thursday 30 June in relation to a number of 
sexual offences reported to have taken place at a property in south Belfast, on 
28 June.

“The men have been interviewed and released from custody. A file will be 
prepared for submission to the Public Prosecution Service. A fourth man, aged 
24, will be reported to the PPS in relation to this incident for perverting the 
course of justice.”

Jackson’s legal firm, KRW Law, said he “rejects completely any allegations 
made against him”.

Its statement said: “Patrick has cooperated fully with police in their 
inquiries and we have been liaising with police on his behalf. We are 
disappointed and concerned that this information has been leaked to the press 
before the investigation has concluded and well in advance of any final 
decision. This has the potential to be prejudicial to our client’s interests.

“We will not hesitate to take all necessary steps to protect his legal 
position as he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. We urge the media 
to restrain from any damaging speculation.”

Jackson had been due to fly to Chicago on Monday with the Ireland squad, who 
face New Zealand there on Saturday. However a press release from the Irish 
Rugby Football Union said he was not included for “personal reasons”.

The week before the alleged offences in June, Jackson had returned from the 
Test tour in South Africa.

Jackson, 24, has been capped 16 times while Olding, 23, has played four times 
for his country. The two men, both from Belfast, are established players for 
Ulster and have featured regularly for the team for most of this season.

In a statement, the club said: “Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have been 
assisting the PSNI with inquiries.

“The players deny any wrongdoing and have not been charged with any offence. 
As no charges have been brought forward, it would be inappropriate to comment 
further.”
