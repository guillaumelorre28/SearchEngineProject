complaint against a senator who has been an outspoken critic of a surge of 
extrajudicial killings unleashed by the president’s campaign against drugs.

 She has denounced the government attacks on her as “madness” and “harassment” 
and she has appealed to Duterte to stop the string of bizarre accusations and 
insults.

 Senators loyal to Duterte ousted her from the leadership of the investigation 
in September.

 Congressmen then accused her of disrespect in connection with criticism she 
made of her treatment and the fate of the inquiry. That led to a criminal 
complaint.

 “Senator de Lima has shown disrespect to the House of Representatives,” said 
congressman Reynaldo Umali, head of the lower house’s justice panel.

 “We cannot allow this incident to pass, how can we earn the respect of the 
people when a senator insults us by calling the inquiry a sham and a kangaroo 
court.“

 De Lima is on an official trip to the United States and Europe and was not 
available for comment.

 Duterte’s war on drugs, the key plank of his campaign for a May election, has 
claimed about 5,000 lives since 1 July.

 The high toll and mysterious circumstances of some of the killings have 
alarmed rights groups, the United States and United Nations, whose concerns 
have drawn angry rebukes from Duterte.

 Umali said de Lima faced imprisonment of up six months if found guilty.

 A small group of opposition politicians in congress said the case against de 
Lima would have a chilling effect on critics of Duterte’s war on drugs.
