A typhoon has lashed the northern Philippines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/weather/philippines>, killing at least six people 
and forcing more than 380,000 in several provinces to abandon Christmas 
celebrations at home and move to safer ground.

Typhoon Nock-ten cut power to five provinces due to toppled electric posts and 
trees, dimming the festivities in Asiaâ€™s largest Catholic country. More than 
300 flights were delayed or rescheduled and ferries were barred from sailing, 
stranding more than 12,000 holidaymakers.

Six people died from drowning or by being pinned by fallen trees, poles and a 
collapsed concrete wall in the provinces of Quezon and Albay, south-east of 
Manila, after the typhoon made landfall in Catanduanes province on Sunday 
night, officials said.

Many military camps and outposts in Catanduanes and outlying provinces were 
damaged and some troops were injured, the military said.

Nock-ten, locally known as Nina, then blew westward across mountainous and 
island provinces, damaging homes, uprooting trees and knocking down 
communications.

After weakening on landfall, the typhoon had sustained winds of up to 74mph 
and gusts of 111mph when it blew into the South China Sea after battering the 
congested provinces of Batangas and Cavite, south of Manila, government 
forecasters said.

A cargo ship with about two dozen crew radioed for help as their vessel 
started to list off Batangas. It later ran aground and turned on its sided in 
Mabini town, the coastguard said.
