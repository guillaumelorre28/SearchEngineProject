You should have seen him, writes Charles Dickens, of his eponymous hero The 
Haunted Man (1848), the fifth of his Christmas books.

“You should have seen him in his dwelling, about twilight, in the dead winter 
time. When the wind was blowing shrill and shrewd, with the going down of the 
blurred sun. When it was just so dark, as that the form of things were 
indistinct and big – but not wholly lost. When sitters by the fire began to see 
the wild faces and figures, mountains and abysses, ambuscades and armies, in 
the coals. When people in the streets bent down their heads and ran before the 
weather.”

 with a hymn to the frost, and The Chimes with an incantation to the winter 
rain. By the time he started his last Yuletide novella, he had gone into 
narrative autopilot and at least two dozen consecutive descriptive sentences 
begin with the same word. “When those who were obliged to meet it were stopped 
at angry corners, stung by wandering snowflakes alighting on the lashes of 
their eyes – which fell too sparingly and were blown away too quickly, to leave 
a trace upon the frozen ground.”

On and on he goes, evoking travellers by land, and the moment “when mariners 
at sea, outlying on icy yards were tossed and swung above the howling ocean 
dreadfully.” He turns hostile climate into literary atmosphere and makes heavy 
weather of it, for more than two pages of the Chapman & Hall Fireside Edition, 
to open a story that shamefully many of us have never finished.
