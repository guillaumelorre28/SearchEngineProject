On Friday a spokeswoman for the AFP said: “Australian agencies are aware of 
allegations of the involvement of a number of Australian companies in foreign 
bribery matters. As the AFP is conducting ongoing investigations into a number 
of these allegations, it would not be appropriate to provide any further 
comment in this regard.”

“These searches and interviews were carried out in the presence of British 
officials as part of a vast, international corruption scandal implicating 
numerous foreign oil industry firms. The information collected is going to be 
examined by the British authorities as part of their investigation,” it said.
