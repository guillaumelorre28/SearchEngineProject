At least 65,000 Rohingya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/04/is-rohingya-persecution-caused-by-business-interests-rather-than-religion>
 have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar – a third of them over the past week – 
since the army launched a crackdown in the north of Rakhine state.


The figure, released by the UN, marks a sharp escalation in the numbers 
fleeing a military campaign which rights groups say has been marred by abuses 
so severe they could amount to crimes against humanity.

They also come the same day the UN’s human rights envoy for Myanmar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar>, Yanghee Lee, began a 12-day visit 
to probe violence in the country’s borderlands that will take her to the 
army-controlled area.

“Over the past week, 22,000 new arrivals were reported to have crossed the 
border from Rakhine state,” the UN’s relief agency said in its weekly report.

“As of 5 January, an estimated 65,000 people are residing in registered camps, 
makeshift settlements and host communities in Cox’s Bazaar” in southern 
Bangladesh, said the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The exodus of Rohingya <https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya> from 
northern Rakhine began after Myanmar’s army launched clearance operations while 
searching for insurgents behind deadly raids on police border posts three 
months ago.

.

The stories have cast a pall over the young government of Aung San Suu Kyi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/05/rohingya-plight-making-myanmar-a-target-for-isis-malaysia-warns>
, with mainly Muslim Malaysia being especially critical.

Myanmar’s government has said the claims of abuse are fabricated and launched 
a special commission to investigate the allegations.

Last week it presented its interim report denying accusations of “genocide and 
religious persecution” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/30/nobel-laureates-aung-san-suu-kyi-ethnic-cleansing-rohingya>
 and saying there was insufficient evidence that troops had been committing 
rape.

That judgement came days after a video emerged showing police beating Rohingya 
civilians, something the government said was an isolated incident after the 
officers were arrested.

Rohingya police beating footage: Myanmar government to investigate

On Monday the UN’s Lee began her own probe with a visit to Kachin state, where 
thousands have been displaced by fighting between ethnic rebels and the army.

Lee, who has faced threats and demonstrations on previous visits over her 
comments on Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya, is due to visit Rakhine before 
leaving on 20 January.

Hardline Buddhist monk Wirathu caused outrage when he called her a “whore in 
our country” for criticising controversial legislation considered 
discriminatory to women and minorities.
