transport minister has said.


The fate of the passenger jet, which is presumed to have crashed at sea after 
disappearing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew 
on board in March 2014, remains a mystery.

Five other fragments have previously been found and identified as definitely 
or probably from the Boeing 777

All of them were discovered thousands of kilometres from the current search 
zone far off Australia’s west coast.

The country’s transport minister, Darren Chester, said two of the new pieces 
were found in Mauritius, with the other inMozambique

connection to the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370”.

“The Malaysian government is yet to take custody of the items, however as with 
previous items, Malaysian officials are arranging collection and it is expected 
the items will be brought to Australia for examination,” Chester said in a 
statement.

“These items of debris are of interest and will be examined by experts.”

Australia is leading the hunt for MH370 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/03/mh370-australia-believes-searching-right-place>
 in the remote Indian Ocean, with more than 105,000sq km (40,500sq miles) of 
the designated 120,000 sq km search zone scoured without success.

If nothing turns up once the area is fully scoured, the search is likely to be 
abandoned, Australia, Malaysia and China have jointly said.

The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said last week that 
the hunt could wrap up in August.
