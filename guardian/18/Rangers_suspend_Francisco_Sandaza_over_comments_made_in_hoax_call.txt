Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> have suspended their 
striker Francisco Sandaza amid a club investigation into comments he allegedly 
made during a hoax telephone call.

Sandaza allegedly disclosed details of his salary and declared himself open to 
a move to a better league during a telephone conversation with a Celtic fan who 
was pretending to be an agent, which was broadcast online.

A club statement read: "Francisco Sandaza has been suspended by the club 
pending an investigation into comments made by the player in a recorded 
telephone conversation.

"The club, Francisco and his agent have had discussions and manager Ally 
McCoist also spoke with the player, who did not take part in today's training 
session. Francisco will not return to the club while the investigation is under 
way.

"Rangers regard this is an extremely serious issue but there will be no 
further comment until the inquiry, which could take a week, has been completed."

McCoist, speaking ahead of the Third Division clash against Stirling Albion at 
Ibrox on Saturday, where they will clinch the title with a victory if nearest 
challengers Queen's Park fail to win at Annan, said: "Fran has been suspended 
by the club on full wages pending an internal inquiry.

"We are very hopeful that the inquiry won't last any more than a week but he 
has been suspended and won't be coming to Ibrox or Murray Park pending the 
investigation. We will be issuing a statement after the investigation, we will 
have more to say then.

"I can't say anything that would be to the detriment of the investigation. It 
is the last thing we need at this moment in time, we have seven players out 
tomorrow."

Asked if Sandaza could be sacked, McCoist replied: "I have no idea. We will 
have to wait to see what the investigation unfolds."
