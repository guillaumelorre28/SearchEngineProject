Os Mutantes – A Minha Menina


In 2013, when I was staying in New York, I stopped at Videology Bar & Cinema 
in Williamsburg where they were screening a documentary about a Brazilian 
artistic movement known as Tropicália. That’s how I discovered Caetano Veloso 
and Gilberto Gil, but the band that caught my attention was Os Mutantes. This 
song is pure fun. Wild and psychedelic with a unique guitar sound. In the 60s 
they constructed their own guitar pedals that sounded insane. Even Kurt Cobain 
was anOs Mutantes

The Raincoats – No Side to Fall in


I found this track on the YouTube compilation of Ladies of Punk and Post Punk, 
and I absolutely fell in love with this track. It’s rough, melodic and 
brilliant.

Vincent Gallo – Yes, I’m Lonely


“I’m always sad when I’m lonely,” are the first words of the song, and how 
true they are! I love the whole album and I listen to it regularly. It’s a 
subtle and gorgeous collection of songs, and it has this great vintage sound. 
He may be a freak, but I really respect his work.Gallo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/30/features.magazine> is one of the 
few artists who works successfully in so many fields and that’s what attracts 
me. “It could be so nice ... ”

Krzysztof Komeda – Cul-de-Sac


Komeda was one of the most talented Polish composers. I adore his work. His 
compositions are an endless mine of amazing melodies that you probably know if 
you’re a fan of RomanPolanski’s <https://www.theguardian.com/film/romanpolanski>
 movies. Cul-de-Sac is one of his most original pieces. It was composed for the 
bizarre hostage melodrama of the same name by Polanski. Komeda used 
high-pitched woodwinds and brass that give a very unique effect.

Ketty Lester – Love Letters


A few years ago a friend made two mixtapes for me. One was named Misty and the 
other Ecstatic Joy. Love Letters comes from the first one. It’s one of the most 
romantic and beautiful songs about love. I still listen to both mixtapes often, 
so thank you my friend for sharing with me this misty piece of good music!
