Ok guys! So they're chucking me out of the Guardian office now. Actually it's 
the webchat that's expiring shortly... but it's been so great to chat with all 
of you. Thank you for stopping by. There are a couple of people 
(DouglasBateman, wryobserver, dhc1970) whose questions I wasn't able to answer 
directly for two reasons: 1) time constraints, and 2) I actually had already 
answered the same question in an earlier post. I hope you'll find the answers 
further down the chat, and... sorry!

Thank you so much for supporting classical music and classical artists through 
new digital forms, and please please please, if you love classical music and 
classical artists, tune in to BBC4 on December 18 to watch the premiere of my 
documentary Birth of an Opera: Danielle De Niese on The Barber of Seville.

It's so important that we show our commitment to classical music programming - 
ratings success will promote that. So please tell all your friends, spread the 
word, in any way you can - socials, email, word of mouth. Help these programmes 
become a success because that's a success for classical music - a success for 
everybody. Thank you all again for your support in every way - have a wonderful 
holiday season. Lots of love to you all, Danni xxxxxxx

Birth of an Opera: Danielle de Niese on The Barber of Seville is on BBC Four 
on Sunday 18 December at 7pm – the documentary follows her preparation for the 
role of Rosina.

Then watch the the opera in full: Il barbiere di Siviglia follows on BBC Four 
at 8pm

How did it feel taking The Barber of Seville to the Proms this year, and 
performing to a very different crowd to the Glyndebourne audience?

Royal Albert Hall is always a hugely special venue for me. I've been so lucky 
to have some major successes there, and I feel that even though the venue is so 
big, it's extremely intimate. It's a really hard thing to describe to people 
unless you've performed on stage there yourself, because as an audience member 
there - and I've been an audience member there - it seems sooooooo vast. As a 
performer, it is totally possible to capture the attention of 6000 people as if 
they were one person, and I don't know how that works in the Royal Albert Hall 
but it does. I've sung arias there where I've been able to hear a pin drop. And 
then I've also heard the audience roar in approval in a way that is 
overwhelmingly emotional, because of the sheer numbers. And then by contrast, 
you can hear ten people laugh really close to the stage and it feels like 
they're in your living room. The Glyndebourne prom is always so special because 
we get to bring so much of the set, costumes etc up to London in a semi-staged 
show setting. So it was just incredible to come back for the Barber at the 
Proms. The audience was hugely appreciative, and funnily enough I know the 
crowd is slightly different from the Glyndebourne audience, but it didn't feel 
that way - the love, and the appreciation, and the crowd response, and 
laughter, was equally hearty. I can't wait until I get to come to Royal Albert 
Hall again.

I first saw you as Cleopatra in 2005 and was completely swept away by you and 
the production at Glyndebourne. Do you have any plans to perform Cleopatra 
again? (I’ve seen other singers as Cleopatra and they are nowhere nearly as 
good as you. )Can I ask a supplementary? How important is ‘charisma’ for a 
singer? You certainly have it.

Hey Brian - nice to see you here. Thanks for coming to support me on my

Beverley Sills was my age now when she first debuted Cleopatra, which was a 
major career splash for her, so my Cleopatra days are far from over, and I'm 
just unbelievably lucky that I got to debut it at such a young age - 26. There 
is much more growing I can do into the role as I mature, and I look forward to 
having the opportunity to do that. I hope that the massive impact of the 
McVicar production won't cast a shadow over any future productions. It was such 
a huge show, so I wouldn't be surprised that I did - there's certainly a part 
of me that goes: could I ever do a better Cleopatra than that show? But that I 
don't think is grounds for not doing it again.

Charisma is hugely important to a singer, though a singer who has only 
charisma CANNOT survive in this business. Charisma is a great bonus. Charisma 
is so useful when you're a performer because our life's work is storytelling, 
and communicating, so charisma gives you a wonderful authentic channel through 
which you can transmit all of that. I think people give the word charisma a bum 
rap actually – they sometimes attribute it to a superficiality. They might say: 
that person only gets that across because they've got charisma. Rather than 
substance. So the word charisma can get wrapped up in the wrong context and 
come across as merely external. I'm glad you think I have charisma, and I often 
get asked about where I get my charisma - the Times asked me yesterday! The 
answer I gave is that you don't see your charisma - if you have true charisma, 
you can't possibly answer that question. You don't create it, or portray it, or 
use it - if you have true natural charisma, it just emanates from you, there's 
no prescription for it.

The diva question

Louise Mullineaux <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13107865> asks:

What do you make of the term “diva”? You seem really down to earth – but is 
that a help or a hindrance in the opera world?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17110436> Guardian contributor 
DanielleDeNiese  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17110436> 08 December 
2016 1:54pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89080584> 
Diva often has a negative connotation. I do understand the negative 
connotations but I don't subscribe to them - I even named my fourth album Diva. 
For me "diva" means somebody who has a great charisma, aura, majesty, presence, 
energy. The nicest thing that someone ever said about me regarding the word 
diva was that a dresser of mine in Amsterdam, at the NetherlandsOpera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/opera>, a lovely lady called Christine, told 
my mother that I was a diva on the stage but not off the stage. Honestly, 
that's the nicest thing somebody could have said - it made my mother very 
proud. So I kind of embrace the word for its positive connotations, but my 
reputation in the business indicates that I don't portray the negative 
connotations.

SA001 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4224170> asks:

As you will know, Glyndebourne started up not just because of the efforts of 
John Christie, but also because of the input of his wife Audrey Mildmay, 
starring soprano of the Carl Rosa opera company! How does it feel to be 
following in this tradition? Does it affect the way you and your husband see 
your joint work at Glyndebourne?

We never thought of the tradition during our courtship, but yes, now that 
we're married, it is certainly a wonderful coincidence of history repeating 
itself. It is a wonderful thing to have such a deep connection to Glyndebourne 
- I already had a deep relationship with Glyndebourne the company, so now to be 
connected with them as a family member means I understand in a much more 
personal way what a labour of love this has been for the Christie family since 
Glyndebourne's inception. So their labour of love has become my labour of love 
and I already provided that level of labour with my stage performances at 
Glyndebourne - it's wonderful now to be able to offer another level of support 
on the personal side. Gus and I take that very seriously, it's a very beautiful 
mantle to assume.

Thanks so much for this lovely comment! You're right, the opera industry can 
be tough at times, but love of opera and the ability to connect with audiences, 
and also to connect audiences to music through performance always overcomes any 
difficulties that any artform will inevitably present. Please let me know if 
you come to another performance of mine and I'll organise it for you to come 
backstage.

Ciao! As an Italian teaching Opera <https://www.theguardian.com/music/opera>

Sei sicuro che vuole dire italiani? perche immagino che gli italiani sono 
molto appassionati per l'opera, no? oppure, non e' la sua esperienza?

Flavione  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17111025>continues:

Yes, I meant Italians. In Japan so many youngsters are in love with canto and 
opera, which happens less and less in my country.

Hi Flavione. I'm very intrigued by your answer and looking at young Italians I 
wonder whether there could be a case for getting more opera singers out into 
the mainstream media, perhaps through some mainstream musical collaborations, 
to really put the operatic medium into a modern context. I would the 
opportunity to do that, especially speaking Italian - I would be able to speak 
on the subject in their native language. Actually, Mika the pop singer, is 
doing a show in Italy at the moment, and he asked me to come on an episode 
about opera - but I wasn't free sadly! I hope there'll be another opportunity. 
Much love to you and all the lovely Japanese opera lovers!

Definitely soul and Motown, in addition to classical. I love folk music, dance 
music, Brazilian music, movie soundtracks (I'm a major sucker for movie 
soundtracks)... We do a lot of Spotify now. Last night we were listening to 
Grace Jones, and a bunch of 70s dance music, and I started singing a 70s 
version of What I Did For Love, to my son, who was completely transfixed. He 
was just transfixed watching my face deliver this emotional text alongside this 
70s dance beat!

Is there any chance of you performing in Handel’s opera Alcina at Glyndebourne 
in the near future? To see this wonderful work with its memorable soprano roles 
in an imaginative production - perhaps from David McVicar or Nicholas Hytner - 
would be a joy.

Gosh! Alcina would be wonderful! I have no idea whether that will be a 
possibility at Glyndebourne, as I'm responsible for artistic planning, but you 
are right, in a dream world, an Alcina with Sir David or Sir Nicholas would be 
stunning. Feel free to send your request on to Glyndebourne! Try @glyndebourne

Ok guys! So they're chucking me out of the Guardian office now. Actually it's 
the webchat that's expiring shortly... but it's been so great to chat with all 
of you. Thank you for stopping by. There are a couple of people 
(DouglasBateman, wryobserver, dhc1970) whose questions I wasn't able to answer 
directly for two reasons: 1) time constraints, and 2) I actually had already 
answered the same question in an earlier post. I hope you'll find the answers 
further down the chat, and... sorry!

Thank you so much for supporting classical music and classical artists through 
new digital forms, and please please please, if you love classical music and 
classical artists, tune in to BBC4 on December 18 to watch the premiere of my 
documentary Birth of an Opera: Danielle De Niese on The Barber of Seville.

It's so important that we show our commitment to classical music programming - 
ratings success will promote that. So please tell all your friends, spread the 
word, in any way you can - socials, email, word of mouth. Help these programmes 
become a success because that's a success for classical music - a success for 
everybody. Thank you all again for your support in every way - have a wonderful 
holiday season. Lots of love to you all, Danni xxxxxxx

Birth of an Opera: Danielle de Niese on The Barber of Seville is on BBC Four 
on Sunday 18 December at 7pm – the documentary follows her preparation for the 
role of Rosina.

Then watch the the opera in full: Il barbiere di Siviglia follows on BBC Four

Royal Albert Hall is always a hugely special venue for me. I've been so lucky 
to have some major successes there, and I feel that even though the venue is so 
big, it's extremely intimate. It's a really hard thing to describe to people 
unless you've performed on stage there yourself, because as an audience member 
there - and I've been an audience member there - it seems sooooooo vast. As a 
performer, it is totally possible to capture the attention of 6000 people as if 
they were one person, and I don't know how that works in the Royal Albert Hall 
but it does. I've sung arias there where I've been able to hear a pin drop. And 
then I've also heard the audience roar in approval in a way that is 
overwhelmingly emotional, because of the sheer numbers. And then by contrast, 
you can hear ten people laugh really close to the stage and it feels like 
they're in your living room. The Glyndebourne prom is always so special because 
we get to bring so much of the set, costumes etc up to London in a semi-staged 
show setting. So it was just incredible to come back for the Barber at the 
Proms. The audience was hugely appreciative, and funnily enough I know the 
crowd is slightly different from the Glyndebourne audience, but it didn't feel 
that way - the love, and the appreciation, and the crowd response, and 
laughter, was equally hearty. I can't wait until I get to come to Royal Albert 
Hall again.

I first saw you as Cleopatra in 2005 and was completely swept away by you and 
the production at Glyndebourne. Do you have any plans to perform Cleopatra 
again? (I’ve seen other singers as Cleopatra and they are nowhere nearly as 
good as you. )Can I ask a supplementary? How important is ‘charisma’ for a 
singer? You certainly have it.

Hey Brian - nice to see you here. Thanks for coming to support me on my 
Guardian webchat. I will definitely sing Cleopatra many, many more times. 
Beverley Sills was my age now when she first debuted Cleopatra, which was a 
major career splash for her, so my Cleopatra days are far from over, and I'm 
just unbelievably lucky that I got to debut it at such a young age - 26. There 
is much more growing I can do into the role as I mature, and I look forward to 
having the opportunity to do that. I hope that the massive impact of the 
McVicar production won't cast a shadow over any future productions. It was such 
a huge show, so I wouldn't be surprised that I did - there's certainly a part 
of me that goes: could I ever do a better Cleopatra than that show? But that I 
don't think is grounds for not doing it again.

Charisma is hugely important to a singer, though a singer who has only 
charisma CANNOT survive in this business. Charisma is a great bonus. Charisma 
is so useful when you're a performer because our life's work is storytelling, 
and communicating, so charisma gives you a wonderful authentic channel through 
which you can transmit all of that. I think people give the word charisma a bum 
rap actually – they sometimes attribute it to a superficiality. They might say: 
that person only gets that across because they've got charisma. Rather than 
substance. So the word charisma can get wrapped up in the wrong context and 
come across as merely external. I'm glad you think I have charisma, and I often 
get asked about where I get my charisma - the Times asked me yesterday! The 
answer I gave is that you don't see your charisma - if you have true charisma, 
you can't possibly answer that question. You don't create it, or portray it, or 
use it - if you have true natural charisma, it just emanates from you, there's 
no prescription for it.

What do you make of the term “diva”? You seem really down to earth – but is 
that a help or a hindrance in the opera world?

Diva often has a negative connotation. I do understand the negative 
connotations but I don't subscribe to them - I even named my fourth album Diva. 
For me "diva" means somebody who has a great charisma, aura, majesty, presence, 
energy. The nicest thing that someone ever said about me regarding the word 
diva was that a dresser of mine in Amsterdam, at the NetherlandsOpera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/opera>, a lovely lady called Christine, told 
my mother that I was a diva on the stage but not off the stage. Honestly, 
that's the nicest thing somebody could have said - it made my mother very 
proud. So I kind of embrace the word for its positive connotations, but my 
reputation in the business indicates that I don't portray the negative 
connotations.

As you will know, Glyndebourne started up not just because of the efforts of 
John Christie, but also because of the input of his wife Audrey Mildmay, 
starring soprano of the Carl Rosa opera company! How does it feel to be 
following in this tradition? Does it affect the way you and your husband see 
your joint work at Glyndebourne?

We never thought of the tradition during our courtship, but yes, now that 
we're married, it is certainly a wonderful coincidence of history repeating 
itself. It is a wonderful thing to have such a deep connection to Glyndebourne 
- I already had a deep relationship with Glyndebourne the company, so now to be 
connected with them as a family member means I understand in a much more 
personal way what a labour of love this has been for the Christie family since 
Glyndebourne's inception. So their labour of love has become my labour of love 
and I already provided that level of labour with my stage performances at 
Glyndebourne - it's wonderful now to be able to offer another level of support 
on the personal side. Gus and I take that very seriously, it's a very beautiful 
mantle to assume.

Not a question, just wanted to say that I really enjoyed all your performances

Thanks so much for this lovely comment! You're right, the opera industry can 
be tough at times, but love of opera and the ability to connect with audiences, 
and also to connect audiences to music through performance always overcomes any 
difficulties that any artform will inevitably present. Please let me know if 
you come to another performance of mine and I'll organise it for you to come 
backstage.

Ciao! As an Italian teaching Opera <https://www.theguardian.com/music/opera> 
in Tokyo, I would like Italians to be more passionately in love with opera. How 
could that happen?

Sei sicuro che vuole dire italiani? perche immagino che gli italiani sono 
molto appassionati per l'opera, no? oppure, non e' la sua esperienza?

Flavione  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17111025>continues:

Yes, I meant Italians. In Japan so many youngsters are in love with canto and 
opera, which happens less and less in my country.

Hi Flavione. I'm very intrigued by your answer and looking at young Italians I 
wonder whether there could be a case for getting more opera singers out into 
the mainstream media, perhaps through some mainstream musical collaborations, 
to really put the operatic medium into a modern context. I would the 
opportunity to do that, especially speaking Italian - I would be able to speak 
on the subject in their native language. Actually, Mika the pop singer, is 
doing a show in Italy at the moment, and he asked me to come on an episode 
about opera - but I wasn't free sadly! I hope there'll be another opportunity. 
Much love to you and all the lovely Japanese opera lovers!

Is it all classical music in your house - do you ever let rip with some soul

Definitely soul and Motown, in addition to classical. I love folk music, dance 
music, Brazilian music, movie soundtracks (I'm a major sucker for movie 
soundtracks)... We do a lot of Spotify now. Last night we were listening to 
Grace Jones, and a bunch of 70s dance music, and I started singing a 70s 
version of What I Did For Love, to my son, who was completely transfixed. He 
was just transfixed watching my face deliver this emotional text alongside this 
70s dance beat!

Is there any chance of you performing in Handel’s opera Alcina at Glyndebourne 
in the near future? To see this wonderful work with its memorable soprano roles 
in an imaginative production - perhaps from David McVicar or Nicholas Hytner - 
would be a joy.

Gosh! Alcina would be wonderful! I have no idea whether that will be a 
possibility at Glyndebourne, as I'm responsible for artistic planning, but you 
are right, in a dream world, an Alcina with Sir David or Sir Nicholas would be 
stunning. Feel free to send your request on to Glyndebourne! Try @glyndebourne
