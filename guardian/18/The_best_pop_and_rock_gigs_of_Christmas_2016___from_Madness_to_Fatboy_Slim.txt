Fatboy Slim
The O2, London

Ageing ravers will be out in force as one of the biggest stars of the 90s 
returns to the stage for a pre-Christmas arena show, although Es are likely to 
be less prevalent than 20 years ago, given the need to be in a sensible state 
to return to the babysitter. Expect a spectacular that will make you want to 
dance your feet off so energetically that you will be doubly grateful to get a 
seat on public transport on the way home.

Madness
Bournemouth International Centre, then touring

Yes, they are promoting a new album, so there will be a chunk of that in the 
set, but for a Christmas party set to music there’s no surer bet than Madness. 
Their unimpeachable back catalogue means that, once the new songs are out of 
the way, you’ll get singalong after singalong in an atmosphere of pretty much 
unconstrained joy. There’s a reason Madness remain one of the most loved groups 
British pop has produced – it’s the timeless perfection of that run of 80s 
singles they see no shame in revisiting.

The Human League
Royal Festival Hall, London, then touring

Celebrate one of the greatest of all Christmas No 1s, Don’t You Want Me, when 
the League bring their synthesisers to town. These days, they’re definitely 
regarded as an important group – features in Mojo, career-spanning reissues – 
but you’re more likely to want to see them live because they have one of the 
great British pop songbooks. Chances are, scores of couples will turn to each 
other and sing along: “I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar, that much 
is true …”

Kurupt FM present Champagne Steam Rooms
Brixton Academy, London

The stars of BBC’s People Just Do Nothing – the comedy mockumentary about the 
hapless “stars” of a pirate radio station in the west London suburbs – also put 
on their own shows, playing grime and garage to the very people they 
affectionately send up. There will be an array of guest stars, among them many 
of the big names of UK underground dance music. Hopefully there will be the 
chance to hear MC Grindah intone: “Bang! Lyrical blow to the jaw”. And maybe, 
by now, the Kurupt crew will have written a second half to their signature tune.

Korn and Limp Bizkit
Manchester Arena, then touring

Nu metal may have been the most derided of musical forms, but it never lost 
its audience – hence the fact that this tour is playing to arenas rather than 
theatres. And now, perhaps, the critical pendulum is swinging slowly in its 
favour. Metal has never been afraid to party, and this tour by two of the 
titans of nu metal is likely to generate plenty of festive spirit, even if the 
songs are notably short on elves, reindeer, goodwill to all men or the wish for 
peace on earth.
