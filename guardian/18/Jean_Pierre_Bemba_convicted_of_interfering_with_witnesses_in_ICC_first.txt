The international criminal court has convicted a former vice-president of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo> and 
four members of his legal team of interfering with witnesses.

The verdicts against Jean-Pierre Bemba and his legal team marked the first 
time the court has found suspects guilty of attempting to pervert the course of 
justice.

The importance of the ruling was underscored by the presiding judge, Marc 
Perrin de Brichambaut. He said: “It has become apparent in the short time span 
of the court’s existence that preventing offences against the administration of 
justice is of the utmost importance.”

Bemba’s attempts to influence his trial ultimately failed. Earlier this year 
he was convicted

 for commanding a militia – the Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) – that 
committed mass rape, murder and pillage in neighbouring Central African 
Republic in 2002-2003.

That conviction was the ICC’s first verdict to recognise rape as a weapon of 
war and to employ the doctrine of command responsibility: that leaders are 
accountable for the crimes of their subordinates.


Three trial judges found Bemba responsible as military commander for the war 
crimes of the 1,500-strong MLC as it sought to overturn a coup against the then 
CAR president, Ange-Félix Patassé.

The judges said Bemba could at any point have ended the MLC’s five-month 
rampage but chose not to.
