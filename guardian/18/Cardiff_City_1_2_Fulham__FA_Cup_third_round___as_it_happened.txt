Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> look a decent bet for a 
Cup run, and perhaps a play-off place, on today’s evidence. Neil Warnock won’t 
be too bothered to be out of the competition; his job is to keep Cardiff up, 
with a huge game coming up next week against Bristol City. That’s all from me. 
Thanks for reading, enjoy your Sundays.

A quick word with Slavisa Jokanovic: “We played very well. We had control of 
the ball, we created many chances. Sessegnon and Fredericks played very well on 
either side. Cardiff are strong and solid, but we prepared for that.”

78 mins: Another nifty passing move from Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> ends with the ball at Piazon’s 
feet. He shoots from 12 yards out, fizzing the ball just over Murphy’s bar.

77 mins: Fulham are holding a high line and resisting the urge to drop deep,

76 mins: Kadeem Harris is stopped in his tracks by a brilliant tackle from 
McDonald, who is hurt in the process.Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> break forward again, but Bamba 
produces a similarly clinical challenge to stop Aluko advancing on goal.

70 mins: After that stoppage and double substitution, Cardiff have lost 10

touchline, Warnock pensively applies the Chap-Stick.

An email, from someone known only as ‘jbtcardfan’:

“Good morning from the colonies, Sir Niall! How do you fancy Fulham’s chances 
to compete for a play-off spot this season?”

They’re 10th, six points off the top six, with a game in hand – and in their 
next 10 games, they play just one team currently above them: Barnsley, at home.
I like their chances <https://youtu.be/FGaLbln9eOU>.

60 mins: Fulham have had a Barcelona-esque 76% of possession so far, but still 
only lead by one. Huws does get a shot in on goal, but his left-footed strike 
from distance is easy for Bettinelli.

57 mins: Cairney leaves a leg lingering after going past Morrison in the area, 
but the defender doesn’t bite. Cairney threads a pass to Piazon, who gets to 
the ball ahead of Murphy – but he can only prod it back across goal, and 
nobody’s there to turn it in!

55 mins: Cardiff need to offer more support to the isolated Lambert; perhaps 
we’ll see Kenneth Zohore coming off the bench soon. This is only going one way 
at the moment.

to shoot rather than cross, and Bennett gets the block in.

49 mins: Cardiff have 40 minutes or so to get themselves in the hat – they’re 
the only Welsh team left in the competition after Swansea went out yesterday.

ball around in midfield. Cairney spies midfield partner McDonald barrelling 
forward after Halford’s misplaced pass, but theFulham

Half time: Cardiff City 1-2 Fulham

Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> have been the better 
side, and rallied after Anthony Pilkington’s early deflected free kick, with 
Stefan Johansen and young Ryan Sessegnon putting the visitors in front. It’s 
been a good game, deserving a much bigger attendance than the handful who have 
turned up.

Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> look a decent bet for a 
Cup run, and perhaps a play-off place, on today’s evidence. Neil Warnock won’t 
be too bothered to be out of the competition; his job is to keep Cardiff up, 
with a huge game coming up next week against Bristol City. That’s all from me. 
Thanks for reading, enjoy your Sundays.

Ryan Sessegnon seals victory for dominant Fulham against Cardiff
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/08/cardiff-city-fulham-fa-cup-match-report> 
A quick word with Slavisa Jokanovic: “We played very well. We had control of 
the ball, we created many chances. Sessegnon and Fredericks played very well on 
either side. Cardiff are strong and solid, but we prepared for that.”
 
Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> were comfortably the 
better side, and earn a place in Monday’s fourth round draw with goals from 
Stefan Johansen and Ryan Sessegnon.
 
94 mins: Fulham keep the ball in the corner, and their place in the fourth 
round is seconds away.
 
93 mins: Bennett’s cross from the left is cleared. Time running out for 
Cardiff...
 
92 mins: Another free-kick is launched into the box, but Noone’s hooked effort 
sails into the goalkeeper’s arms. Final change for Fulham: Scott Malone is on 
for Ryan Sessegnon.
 
90 mins: Five added minutes. Today’s attendance, by the way, is 5,199.
 
89 mins: Humphrys bundles over Bamba in the Cardiff half, giving the hosts 
another chance to send a long ball into the area – but it bobbles through to 
Bettinelli.
 
87 mins: The free kick is prodded along the floor towards Noone at the near 
post, whose shot is blocked, and goes out for a throw-in. Morrison launches it 
and it falls to O’Keefe, who can’t get over an awkward volley.
 
86 mins: Cardiff suddenly realise they’re still only one goal down, and 
Pilkington wins a free kick in a central area, 30 yards out. There’s a murmur 
of excitement from the 4,000-odd home fans.
 
84 mins: Joe Bennett takes a tumble in the area under a Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> challenge, but the referee waves 
play on. The visitors hare up the other end, and Odoi’s shot is deflected 
behind. Aluko is going off, replaced by Stephen Humphrys.
 
83 mins: Noone skips into space, with Pilkington free in the middle – but 
Sigurdsson is on hand to make a vital interception!
 
82 mins: Aluko draws another fine save from Murphy with a snap-shot from just 
inside the area, asFulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> search 
for a third.
 
81 mins: Johansen, scorer of the first goal, is going off, still bearing scars 
from that clash with Pilkington. He’s replaced by Dennis Adeniran, making hisFA 
Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> debut.
 
79 mins: One more change for Cardiff, with Craig Noone replacing Kadeem Harris.
 
78 mins: Another nifty passing move from Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> ends with the ball at Piazon’s 
feet. He shoots from 12 yards out, fizzing the ball just over Murphy’s bar.
 
77 mins: Fulham are holding a high line and resisting the urge to drop deep, 
with Huws the latest Cardiff player caught a mile offside.
 
76 mins: Kadeem Harris is stopped in his tracks by a brilliant tackle from 
McDonald, who is hurt in the process.Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> break forward again, but Bamba 
produces a similarly clinical challenge to stop Aluko advancing on goal.
 
74 mins: From the corner, Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> 
play it short – a trick that’s still somehow fooling Cardiff – and Piazon fires 
wide from a promising position.
 
73 mins: ...but the goalkeeper almost hands Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> a third goal, losing the ball 
under pressure from Piazon, who hooks the ball back across goal. Morrison is on 
hand to clear, and spare the keeper further embarrassment.
 
72 mins: Lucas Piazon gets the better of Richards, and curls in a shot that 
Murphy tips away...
 
70 mins: After that stoppage and double substitution, Cardiff have lost 10 
minutes, and a promising free kick on the left comes to nothing. On the 
touchline, Warnock pensively applies the Chap-Stick.
 
68 mins: O’Keefe and Mark Harris are on, replacing Greg Halford and Rickie 
Lambert. Harris, who just turned 18, is making his debut, and looks set to 
support Pilkington up front.
 
66 mins: Fredericks is held up by Halford, and rolls the ball back to 
Johansen, who fires an angled shot high and wide.
 
An email, from someone known only as ‘jbtcardfan’:

“Good morning from the colonies, Sir Niall! How do you fancy Fulham’s chances 
to compete for a play-off spot this season?”

They’re 10th, six points off the top six, with a game in hand – and in their 
next 10 games, they play just one team currently above them: Barnsley, at home.
I like their chances <https://youtu.be/FGaLbln9eOU>.
 
64 mins: A couple of overdue changes coming for Cardiff – Mark Harris and 
Stuart O’Keefe are coming on.
 
62 mins: A break in play, as Johansen gets treatment for a facial injury, 
caused by Pilkington, who caught theFulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> midfielder with a stray arm – 
accidentally, according to the referee.
 
60 mins: Fulham have had a Barcelona-esque 76% of possession so far, but still 
only lead by one. Huws does get a shot in on goal, but his left-footed strike 
from distance is easy for Bettinelli.
 
57 mins: Cairney leaves a leg lingering after going past Morrison in the area, 
but the defender doesn’t bite. Cairney threads a pass to Piazon, who gets to 
the ball ahead of Murphy – but he can only prod it back across goal, and 
nobody’s there to turn it in!
 
55 mins: Cardiff need to offer more support to the isolated Lambert; perhaps 
we’ll see Kenneth Zohore coming off the bench soon. This is only going one way 
at the moment.
 
54 mins: Fredericks gets the better of Bennett down the right, but cuts inside 
to shoot rather than cross, and Bennett gets the block in.
 
52 mins: Tok, tok, tok – that’s the sound of Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> pinging the ball around 
precisely, with Cardiff pinned in their own half.
 
50 mins: Fulham win a corner, from which Johansen picks out Cairney, whose 
bobbling half-volley is easy enough for Murphy.
 
49 mins: Cardiff have 40 minutes or so to get themselves in the hat – they’re 
the only Welsh team left in the competition after Swansea went out yesterday.
 
47 mins: Fulham start the second half as they ended the first, stroking the 
ball around in midfield. Cairney spies midfield partner McDonald barrelling 
forward after Halford’s misplaced pass, but theFulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> man is crowded out.
 
Here we go again, with no changes for either side.
 
Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> have been the better 
side, and rallied after Anthony Pilkington’s early deflected free kick, with 
Stefan Johansen and young Ryan Sessegnon putting the visitors in front. It’s 
been a good game, deserving a much bigger attendance than the handful who have 
turned up.
 
45 mins: One minute of added time.
