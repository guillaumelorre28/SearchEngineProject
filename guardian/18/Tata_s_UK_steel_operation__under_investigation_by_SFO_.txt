The Serious Fraud Office <https://www.theguardian.com/law/serious-fraud-office>
 has reportedly begun a criminal inquiry into the UK operations of Tata Steel.

Police are looking into claims that certificates describing the composition of 
some products might have been falsified pre-sale by Tata staff in Britain,
according to the Daily Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/07/serious-fraud-office-launches-criminal-inquiry-into-tata-steel/>
, which cited unnamed “well-placed sources”.

The SFO said it was unable to comment. The Telegraph said the investigation 
was understood to centre around a site in Yorkshire, and that documents being 
examined affected around 500 customers, among them Rolls- Royce and BAE.

The company referred itself following an internal audit, the report said. 
There was also a trading standards investigation taking place, the Telegraph 
said, but it was not known if this was linked.

This development comes as the former chairman of the Tata 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/tata> group described its British steel 
operations as underinvested and overmanned.


In his first intervention since the Indian firm announced it was selling its 
loss-making UK business 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/tata-steels-british-plants-must-be-sold-within-weeks>
, Ratan Tata, who retired in 2012 after helping the company achieve vast 
growth, defended the move, the Financial Times reported.

He said cuts would be necessary to make the Port Talbot steelworks profitable. 

Negotiations over the sale of the plant in south Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>, which employs about 4,000 people, had 
been going on for several months before last week’s announcement.

Speaking at a US Export-Import Bank conference in Washington DC, Tata said the 
“bottom just opened up” at the UK steel operation after Chinese steel exports 
rose when domestic demand slowed down.

“Right now the problem is that the English facilities are underinvested [and] 
overmanned.” He said a potential buyer at Port Talbot would need to “cut back 
on the size and the scale of the operations and make them profitable”. This 
would be “extremely challenging” but not impossible.
