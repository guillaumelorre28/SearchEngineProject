The master of sampling, Norman Cook, manages to patch together all kinds of 
musical culture in a genius way. Super-funky, super-danceable high-energy music.

The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes

Love this song: it’s poppy and psychedelic with a very organic flow. I’ve 
listened to it a lot as I’ve been working on a remix of the track; the first 
time I’ve ever remixed anyone in fact.

The track that got me out of bed this morning

One of the most soulful voices in modern-day rock’n’roll, set perfectly inside 
a deep, deep electronic backing. Like a shot of musical caffeine.

The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza

I wonder whether such an English, pastoral-sounding record would work as the 
soundtrack to the waves lapping the shore on a Spanish island... I would love 
to find out.

The track that should have been a crossover hit

This track was a real key for me to start my own electronic career. You can 
listen to this song today and it is still utterly timeless.

The track I wish I’d signed to my label 
Funkadelic: Music For My Mother

Perfect music released in a time of musical innovation that almost seems 
forgotten now. Sometimes, I wish we were back in this era.

The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding

Admittedly, not my favourite Beatles track, but then I’m not playing for me. 
This record is pretty much guaranteed to get old ladies on the dancefloor.

The track I’d play at my funeral

This song has accompanied me through life for a very long time. Inner City 
Blues evokes an indescribable mood. What a send off.
