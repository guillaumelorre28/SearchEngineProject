Author and BBC radio 2 broadcaster Janey Lee Grace was a backing singer for 
Wham! on their historic 1995 tour of China, and remained friends withGeorge 
Michael <https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgemichael>. She told the 
Guardian:


“George was always a perfectionist. When we played China, we were the first 
western band to go there, which was a bizarre experience. They were making a 
feature film and we had a huge film crew. After the first few scenes were shot, 
George and Andy looked at the rushes of the film and George was seriously 
unhappy with his hair, so he flew out his sister Melanie, who was a 
hairdresser, to sort it.

“He knew exactly how he wanted to look and how he wanted his music to sound. 
Even though my colleagues and I were the backing singers on all the live gigs 
and the live videos, he rarely used session singers in the studio, because he 
was so brilliant he did all his own backing vocals – infuriating for us, but 
what a star!

“On the first tour, amongst the merchandise were dolls of George and Andy. The 
guys would have a little competition at each gig to see whose doll sold the 
most. George used to get quite miffed if Andrew Ridgeley’s sold more!

“Years later I was invited to his Cowboys and Angels birthday party. We had to 
go in fancy dress. I was eight and a half months pregnant so couldn’t really go 
as an angel, but managed a cowboy outfit. It was all just after the shenanigans 
had gone on with George being arrested in the public loos, and the invitations 
said: ‘Please note, there will be no public conveniences so please go before 
you come.’ He had a fabulous sense of humour, that’s why he was so beloved.

“I’m not sure he ever got over the death of his mother, Lesley. She was the 
most lovely woman, so proud of her son, and we had several long discussions 
about the horror of losing someone to cancer so young.”

No matter how diligently George Michael tried at times to sink his career, his 
career just wouldn’t go away. If anything – as he told Kirsty Young when he was 
aDesert Island Discs castaway in 2007 <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008006s>
 – it kept bobbing buoyantly, untarnished by scandal. With Michael, there was 
no such thing as “reputational damage”.

George Michael <https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgemichael> was no 
stranger to the headlines. His private life was often offered up for public 
consumption, but his philanthropy was not as widely reported. Since hisdeath 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/25/george-michael-pop-superstar-dies-at-53>
, stories have emerged that reveal his generous, often spontaneous, acts of 
kindness.

The star often kept aside tickets for NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> staff at his concerts, and once gave 
an entire special concert free of charge for nurses as a thank you for the care 
they had given his mother a decade earlier.

Readers are sharing their memories of meeting George – this one from 
kirstimckee 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5860850ae4b0d460757ec8f7/5018659> 
adds to the stories we’ve been hearing today about the artist’s generosity:

“When I was training as a doctor, on one of my first weekends on call in a 
North London hospital, a patient was transferred to our ward. It was a 
chauffeur who worked for lots of rock stars, who had been in a very serious 
accident. I was called up to talk to the family, who were Greek-Cypriot, and I 
realised while talking to them that one of the people in the room wasGeorge 
Michael <https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgemichael>. Half an hour later 
his personal doctor gave me a call and we were asked to transfer the patient to 
a private hospital. George arranged for everything and, I assume, paid for it 
all. I was a fan of his music but this revealed a side of him I had not seen 
before (and he rose even further in my estimation).”

hvadaltsaa: “I was a regular at Double Bass, the club night that Steve Strange 
used to run on a Tuesday. It was more of a question of who didn’t go there than 
who did. I met George Michael as we were dancing the night away. The next day, 
some tabloid or other had a shot of a woman whom they claimed was his partner. 
It was an education for me in how sometimes the media write the stories they 
want when they can’t get the stories that they would really like.”Read more 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5860850ae4b0d460757ec8f7/5018617> 
...

Mel Cameron: “My first concert was at the Birmingham NEC and in the days 
before mobile phones and cameras - the flash created on his Everything She 
Wants video was so cleverly created, by George shouting to the thousands of 
adorning fans “On the count of 123” and suddenly they all pressed their 
automatic camera flash and WHAM you had that amazing flash on the video.”Read

We are now closing this live blog for the day. Thank you for joining us.
 
Author and BBC radio 2 broadcaster Janey Lee Grace was a backing singer for 
Wham! on their historic 1995 tour of China, and remained friends withGeorge 
Michael <https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgemichael>. She told the 
Guardian:


“George was always a perfectionist. When we played China, we were the first 
western band to go there, which was a bizarre experience. They were making a 
feature film and we had a huge film crew. After the first few scenes were shot, 
George and Andy looked at the rushes of the film and George was seriously 
unhappy with his hair, so he flew out his sister Melanie, who was a 
hairdresser, to sort it.

“He knew exactly how he wanted to look and how he wanted his music to sound. 
Even though my colleagues and I were the backing singers on all the live gigs 
and the live videos, he rarely used session singers in the studio, because he 
was so brilliant he did all his own backing vocals – infuriating for us, but 
what a star!

“On the first tour, amongst the merchandise were dolls of George and Andy. The 
guys would have a little competition at each gig to see whose doll sold the 
most. George used to get quite miffed if Andrew Ridgeley’s sold more!

“Years later I was invited to his Cowboys and Angels birthday party. We had to 
go in fancy dress. I was eight and a half months pregnant so couldn’t really go 
as an angel, but managed a cowboy outfit. It was all just after the shenanigans 
had gone on with George being arrested in the public loos, and the invitations 
said: ‘Please note, there will be no public conveniences so please go before 
you come.’ He had a fabulous sense of humour, that’s why he was so beloved.

“I’m not sure he ever got over the death of his mother, Lesley. She was the 
most lovely woman, so proud of her son, and we had several long discussions 
about the horror of losing someone to cancer so young.”
 
Daily Mirror associate editor Kevin Maguire’s take on the story:
Kevin Maguire (@Kevin_Maguire) 
We should remember George Michael 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgemichael> was the son of a Greek 
Cypriot, his dad coming to Britain in 1950. Migration enriches our country

2016 <https://twitter.com/Kevin_Maguire/status/813420856391192576>  
No matter how diligently George Michael tried at times to sink his career, his 
career just wouldn’t go away. If anything – as he told Kirsty Young when he was 
aDesert Island Discs castaway in 2007 <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008006s>
 – it kept bobbing buoyantly, untarnished by scandal. With Michael, there was 
no such thing as “reputational damage”.

George Michael <https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgemichael> was no 
stranger to the headlines. His private life was often offered up for public 
consumption, but his philanthropy was not as widely reported. Since hisdeath 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/25/george-michael-pop-superstar-dies-at-53>
, stories have emerged that reveal his generous, often spontaneous, acts of 
kindness.

The star often kept aside tickets for NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> staff at his concerts, and once gave 
an entire special concert free of charge for nurses as a thank you for the care 
they had given his mother a decade earlier.

Readers are sharing their memories of meeting George – this one from 
kirstimckee 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5860850ae4b0d460757ec8f7/5018659> 
adds to the stories we’ve been hearing today about the artist’s generosity:

“When I was training as a doctor, on one of my first weekends on call in a 
North London hospital, a patient was transferred to our ward. It was a 
chauffeur who worked for lots of rock stars, who had been in a very serious 
accident. I was called up to talk to the family, who were Greek-Cypriot, and I 
realised while talking to them that one of the people in the room wasGeorge 
Michael <https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgemichael>. Half an hour later 
his personal doctor gave me a call and we were asked to transfer the patient to 
a private hospital. George arranged for everything and, I assume, paid for it 
all. I was a fan of his music but this revealed a side of him I had not seen 
before (and he rose even further in my estimation).”

hvadaltsaa: “I was a regular at Double Bass, the club night that Steve Strange 
used to run on a Tuesday. It was more of a question of who didn’t go there than 
who did. I met George Michael as we were dancing the night away. The next day, 
some tabloid or other had a shot of a woman whom they claimed was his partner. 
It was an education for me in how sometimes the media write the stories they 
want when they can’t get the stories that they would really like.”Read more

...

Mel Cameron: “My first concert was at the Birmingham NEC and in the days 
before mobile phones and cameras - the flash created on his Everything She 
Wants video was so cleverly created, by George shouting to the thousands of 
adorning fans “On the count of 123” and suddenly they all pressed their 
automatic camera flash and WHAM you had that amazing flash on the video.”Read
