One of the dairy firms targeted by farmers in blockades this summer has 
announced it is to increase the amount it pays for milk.

Dairy Crest <https://www.theguardian.com/business/dairycrestgroup>, which is 
supplied by about 1,000 dairy farmers, will pay 29p a litre on contracts for 
liquid milk and Davidstow cheese from 1 November.

The increase of around 3p a litre is on top of Dairy Crest's decision to 
reverse a planned price cut in August and means its prices are higher than they 
were before prices started to come down from May.

The company's plants in Derbyshire and Gloucestershire were the subject of 
blockades in July as farmers across the UK protested against being paid less 
for their milk.

Dairy Crest, which supplies about 15% of Britain's milk, said higher selling 
prices from its customers and expectations of improving returns from commodity 
markets had enabled it to raise supplier prices.

The maker of Cathedral City cheese and Country Life butter added: "They are 
much needed to reflect the higher on-farm costs that all dairy farmers are 
currently experiencing following the difficult weather conditions this summer."

On Friday, Britain's biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, said the 700 dairy 
farmers who supply the its own-label non-organic milk will be paid up to 31.58p 
a litre from 1 October â€“ a rise of just over 2p.

Dairy Crest said its own price was competitive as it did not expect its 
farmers to pay for investment in its dairies or face other charges.

The company's milk buying director, Mike Sheldon, said: "As the only major 
processor in British ownership, Dairy Crest's future is strongly linked to that 
of our farmers. We want and need our farmers to be successful."
