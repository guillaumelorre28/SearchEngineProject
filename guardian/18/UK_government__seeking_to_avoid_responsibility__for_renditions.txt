The government is indulging in an “extravagant extension” of the doctrine of 
foreign state immunity to avoid responsibility for rendition cases it 
coordinated, the supreme court has been told.

 Officials cannot lawfully “shut the doors of the court to victims of 
executive abuse simply by acting with other states,” the UK’s highest court 
heard.

The allegations were made on the opening day of a test case brought by a 
Libyan couple and a Pakistani man who claim they were illegally detained inLibya

One claim has been brought by Abdel Hakim Belhaj 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-hakim-belhaj>, 49, and his wife, 
Fatima Bouchar, opponents of the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.


They are suing the former foreign secretary Jack Straw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jackstraw>, Sir Mark Allen, a one-time 
MI6 counter-terrorism officer, and the intelligence services for damages over 
their rendition. The couple are seeking a nominal sum of £1 each and an apology 
from each party.

 The other case has been brought by Pakistani-born Yunus Rahmatullah, who was 
seized by British special forces in Iraq in 2004. He says he was tortured 
before being handed over to the US and rendered to Bagram prison in 
Afghanistan. He was finally released in June last year.

 The issue before the supreme court is whether their claims should be allowed 
to proceed or be struck out on the grounds of the so-called “foreign act of 
state doctrine”, which the government says grants immunity to foreign states in 
UK courts.


 Several other countries, including the US, were allegedly involved in the 
abduction of Belhaj and his wife. The court of appealsaid last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/abdel-hakim-belhaj-court-kidnap-mi6-cia-torture>
 that any foreign involvement should not prevent the case against UK officials 
going ahead.

 Bouchar, who was pregnant at the time, and her husband were taken off a 
flight in Thailand in early 2004. He was a leading member of the Libyan Islamic 
Fighting Group (LIFG), an organisation dedicated to Gaddafi’s removal.


 They were held in what was believed to be a CIA intelligence station near 
Bangkok airport. They were later flown to Gaddafi’s interrogation and torture 
cells in Tripoli. At the time the UK government and Gaddafi were in close 
diplomatic contact.

 In a joint submission to the courts, lawyers for Belhaj, Bouchar and 
Rahmatullah said: “In seeking to deny [them] access to court, the [government] 
contend that two rules preclude any consideration of the grave allegations made 
against the executive and former government officials.

 “These two rules are said to share a common principle: a court in the UK 
should not set itself above foreign states.” The way they are being exploited, 
however, is an “extravagant extension” of the doctrine of foreign state 
immunity, the submission said.

James Eadie QC, for the government, said it was not alleged that the UK had 
directly inflicted any mistreatment of the claimants. Rahmatullah, he pointed 
out, had been held by British forces in Iraq for less than a day before being 
handed over to the Americans.

 “In both of these cases, the English court is being asked to adjudicate on 
the lawful actions of a foreign state outside its jurisdiction,” he said.

 Straw, Allen and the intelligence agencies deny any wrongdoing. The case 
continues.
