Well, that’s 12 Olympic wins in a row for the US women’s team, and it was 
pretty straightforward. New Zealand fought hard, but the gulf in class was 
stark, and USA didn’t need to over-exert themselves. It wasn’t a classic, but 
there were two good goals to savor, the first from Carli Lloyd and the second 
from Alex Morgan, and USA get their campaign off to a solid start. Thanks for 
reading. Bye!

87 min: I should point out that Hope Solo has been receiving some boos from 
the sparse crowd. Here’s why:
Caitlin Murray (@caitlinmurr) 
Everyone seems to think this is the source of the boos: https://t.co/JFW6y0IuhE

85 min: Stott did well to win it in defence and bring it forward, but the pass 
was overhit. Looks like Hope Solo’s clean sheet is in the bag.

Christen Press, and Heath was free, but the angle was tough.

81 min: The corner’s cleared, and Stott tries one from distance. It’s wide, 
but this is New Zealand’s best spell of the match. Sub for USA: Christen Press 
on for Alex Morgan. And a couple of changes I neglected to mention earlier: 
Sarah Gregorius is on for Katie Bowen, and Lindsey Horan is on for Morgan Brian.

75 min: Heath’s ball in, and Nayler just about smuggles it clear! Great ball 
in, Lloyd attacked it, and the goalie spilled it, but did enough to push it 
clear at the second attempt.

74 min: Abby Erceg has played really well in defence for New Zealand, by the 
way. She’s a class act. Dunn wins a free kick on the right side, and Heath will 
whip it in again.

72 min: One aspect of today’s game worth pointing out is that New Zealand 
have, by and large, matched USA physically. It’s been their technique and 
passing that’s been lacking. Morgan is offside by a whisker.

64 min: Yellow card for Percival for a trip on Heath, and this is a great 
chance for a free shot, on the edge of the box. New Zealand’s third yellow card.

61 min: Johnston is down, but did she get away with a tug there? She was 
challenging Wilkinson for a long ball down the middle, and both players went 
down as Hope Solo came out … but no call from the ref! Wilkinson didn’t 
complain, actually – maybe it was just a tangle.

59 min: One slight area of imbalance in this USA team, in my humble opinion, 
is Klingenberg, a natural right-footer, at left-back. But it worked OK for 
Paolo Maldini, I guess. Heath shoots over the bar.

55 min: That’s the second time New Zealand have pinched the ball in midfield 
and looked to break, and the player with the ball, this time Bowen, I think it 
was, has had zero options. NZ surely have to commit players forward.

53 min: A collision in the centre of the park as Long and Duncan go in hard. 
But they’ll be OK: neither player was late.

Crystal Dunn. Is Pugh injured, or is it just tactical?

49 min: Oh, better from New Zealand! It was another ball knocked long, and 
Percival fired a lovely strike goalward that was blocked, and then Amber Hearn 
went close! I think Solo had it covered, and Hearn’s shot was off target, but 
that was much better from the Kiwis.

47 min: USA began on the front foot, pushed New Zealand back, and Morgan Brian 
slipped a lovely ball to her left for Alex Morgan, who thrashed a left-footed 
shot past Erin Nayler. But Nayler was beaten on her near side – should the 
goalkeeper have done better?

Well, it wasn’t always pretty, but that was an effective 45 minutes from the

physical, but haven’t really created anything. USA on top. See you shortly.

29 min: For a moment it looked as though New Zealand might be in, but Solo was 
quickly off her line to claim. We’re just in a slight lull.

Well, that’s 12 Olympic wins in a row for the US women’s team, and it was 
pretty straightforward. New Zealand fought hard, but the gulf in class was 
stark, and USA didn’t need to over-exert themselves. It wasn’t a classic, but 
there were two good goals to savor, the first from Carli Lloyd and the second 
from Alex Morgan, and USA get their campaign off to a solid start. Thanks for 
reading. Bye!
 
That’s it!
 
90 min+4: Yallop’s ball in is pretty hopeless, and USA clear with ease.
 
90 min +3: Lloyd fouls Percival, and maybe a final chance for a New Zealand 
goal.
 
90 min + 2: Solo does well to come out and prevent Pereira winning it in the 
air. As she volleys a kick down field, the crowd shouts “Zika!”
 
90 min: Four minutes of stoppage time, which seems excessive.
 
89 min: Great run from Crystal Dunn, and Nayler does really well to beat Lloyd 
to it! Brave goalkeeping to deny USA a third, but that was classic wing play 
from Dunn.
 
87 min: I should point out that Hope Solo has been receiving some boos from 
the sparse crowd. Here’s why:
Caitlin Murray (@caitlinmurr) 
Everyone seems to think this is the source of the boos: https://t.co/JFW6y0IuhE
 <https://t.co/JFW6y0IuhE> Apparently Brazilians didn't appreciate it?

85 min: Stott did well to win it in defence and bring it forward, but the pass 
was overhit. Looks like Hope Solo’s clean sheet is in the bag.
 
83 min: Chance for Heath at the back post, but it’s wide! Great cross from 
Christen Press, and Heath was free, but the angle was tough.
 
82 min: Jasmine Pereira is in for Hannah Wilkinson. Both teams now have used 
all three subs.
 
81 min: The corner’s cleared, and Stott tries one from distance. It’s wide, 
but this is New Zealand’s best spell of the match. Sub for USA: Christen Press 
on for Alex Morgan. And a couple of changes I neglected to mention earlier: 
Sarah Gregorius is on for Katie Bowen, and Lindsey Horan is on for Morgan Brian.
 
79 min: New Zealand’s best move of the game, and they win a corner. Solo 
punches clear, it’s played back in, and New Zealand win another corner! 
Pressure from the Football Ferns.
 
77 min: New Zealand look tired. It’s tough to see where one goal is going to 
come from, let alone two.
 
75 min: Heath’s ball in, and Nayler just about smuggles it clear! Great ball 
in, Lloyd attacked it, and the goalie spilled it, but did enough to push it 
clear at the second attempt.
 
74 min: Abby Erceg has played really well in defence for New Zealand, by the 
way. She’s a class act. Dunn wins a free kick on the right side, and Heath will 
whip it in again.
 
72 min: One aspect of today’s game worth pointing out is that New Zealand 
have, by and large, matched USA physically. It’s been their technique and 
passing that’s been lacking. Morgan is offside by a whisker.
 
71 min: USA still well on top here. The majority of the second half has been 
played in New Zealand territory.
 
70 min: Kirsty Yallop enters for New Zealand.
 
69 min: Duncan, who’s done some really hard work in midfield, is down, and it 
looks like a change is imminent.
 
66 min: At 2-0, there’s still a ray of hope for New Zealand, but it looks 
unlikely. They just haven’t been able to create anything up front. Hearn and 
Wilkinson have run hard, but they’ve been really isolated.
 
65 min: Lloyd with it, but it’s over the bar. Disappointing.
 
64 min: Yellow card for Percival for a trip on Heath, and this is a great 
chance for a free shot, on the edge of the box. New Zealand’s third yellow card.
 
61 min: Johnston is down, but did she get away with a tug there? She was 
challenging Wilkinson for a long ball down the middle, and both players went 
down as Hope Solo came out … but no call from the ref! Wilkinson didn’t 
complain, actually – maybe it was just a tangle.
 
59 min: One slight area of imbalance in this USA team, in my humble opinion, 
is Klingenberg, a natural right-footer, at left-back. But it worked OK for 
Paolo Maldini, I guess. Heath shoots over the bar.
 
58 min: A slight groan from USA, who had the ball on the counter-attack, but 
referee Kateryna Monzul brings it back for a free kick.
 
57 min: Good work from Longo, but then Percival misplaces a pass, and the 
momentum is lost.
 
55 min: That’s the second time New Zealand have pinched the ball in midfield 
and looked to break, and the player with the ball, this time Bowen, I think it 
was, has had zero options. NZ surely have to commit players forward.
 
53 min: A collision in the centre of the park as Long and Duncan go in hard. 
But they’ll be OK: neither player was late.
 
50 min: But here’s a sorry sight for USA fans: Mallory Pugh is replaced by 
Crystal Dunn. Is Pugh injured, or is it just tactical?
 
49 min: Oh, better from New Zealand! It was another ball knocked long, and 
Percival fired a lovely strike goalward that was blocked, and then Amber Hearn 
went close! I think Solo had it covered, and Hearn’s shot was off target, but 
that was much better from the Kiwis.
 
48 min: Well, this is a tough ask for New Zealand now. How on earth do they 
find two goals in 40 minutes? USA arin control of this one.
 
47 min: USA began on the front foot, pushed New Zealand back, and Morgan Brian 
slipped a lovely ball to her left for Alex Morgan, who thrashed a left-footed 
shot past Erin Nayler. But Nayler was beaten on her near side – should the 
goalkeeper have done better?
 
And within a minute, USA are two up!
 
46 min: USA, who are seeking a fourth consecutive gold in women’s soccer, get 
us under way again.
 
Score update: Germany have just beaten Zimbabwe 6-1.
 
Well, it wasn’t always pretty, but that was an effective 45 minutes from the 
holders. They started very well, scored a good goal within 10 minutes, and then 
kept New Zealand at arm’s length. The Football Ferns have been rugged and 
physical, but haven’t really created anything. USA on top. See you shortly.
 
That’s the half.
 
45 min +1: One minute added on.
 
45 min: Carli Lloyd is offside, for about the third time this half. I can’t 
imagine there’ll be too much stoppage time.
 
44 min: Klingenberg crosses from the left, and Morgan Brian heads over the bar 
under pressure from Stott.
 
42 min: Duncan’s ball in, but USA’s defending of set pieces has been 
excellent, and it’s headed clear again.
 
41 min: Good cross in from the right side, and O’Hara miscues her clearance. 
Corner New Zealand.
 
40 min: Meghan Klingenberg passes it straight out of play on the left side. 
It’s been that sort of game.
 
38 min: Tony Readings, New Zealand’s coach, looks somewhat pained.
 
36 min: USA haven’t really sparkled since the goal. They started in decisive 
fashion, and created two or three chances before Lloyd’s opener, but not much 
since. They’re comfortable, though.
 
35 min: Another long ball knocked in by New Zealand, but it’s to no one in 
particular, and USA clear with ease.
 
33 min: Not much happening, to be honest. USA seem happy to keep things 
ticking over, and, alas, New Zealand don’t quite have the creative quality. So 
if that cup of tea needs making, now might be a good time.
 
29 min: For a moment it looked as though New Zealand might be in, but Solo was 
quickly off her line to claim. We’re just in a slight lull.
