France Football announced on Monday 
<http://www.francefootball.fr/news/Gerard-lopez-et-marcelo-bielsa-a-l-olympique-de-marseille-c-est-fait/719953>
 that a takeover deal had already been formalised and that an official 
announcement would be made this weekend, paving the way for Bielsa to make his 
return to the Stade Vélodrome. Bielsa previously managed the Ligue 1 club 
between 2014 and 2015 but walked out at the beginning of last season after one 
match, citing conflict with the owner, Margarita Louis-Dreyfus.

Bielsa became manager of Lazio in July, but resigned after two days in the job 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/08/marcelo-bielsa-resigns-as-lazio-manager-after-just-two-days>
, leaving the Serie A club bemused. Lazio have since threatened legal action 
and appointed Simone Inzaghi in Bielsa’s place.

Marseille’s prospective owner Lopez, who is the current owner of the F1 team, 
Lotus, is a director of a first division club in his native Luxembourg, CS Fola 
Esch, where he played as a teenager. In the past he has also expresseda desire 
to buy the F1 team Renault

.

Bielsa would return to a much-changed squad: Michy Batshuayi left for Chelsea 
for £33m

 and Tottenham have agreed a deal to sign the talented wide player 
Georges-Kévin Nkoudoufor €11m (£9.53m)
