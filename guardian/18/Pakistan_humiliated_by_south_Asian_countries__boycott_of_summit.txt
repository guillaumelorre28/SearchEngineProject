Four south Asian countries are to boycott what was set to be a historic 
regional summit in Islamadad in November, dealing a humiliating blow toPakistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan> and isolating it diplomatically.

India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan> 
and Bhutan all said they would pull out of the South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) meeting following a collapse in relations between 
Pakistan and India, the subcontinent’s nuclear-armed rivals.

Statements by the region’s foreign ministries echoed India’s criticism on 
Tuesday night, which blamed “increasing cross-border terrorist attacks and 
growing interference of the internal affairs of member states” for Delhi’s 
decision to boycott the conference.

Retaliation or restraint? India has limited options over Kashmir attack

Until recently, the prospect of the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s 
visit to Islamabad had been seen as a potentially highly symbolic step towards 
reconciliation between Pakistan andIndia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/india>.

The two countries, however, have been engaged interse exchanges following an 
attack on an Indian army base on 18 September that killed 19 soldiers,which 
Delhi has blamed on jihadis based in Pakistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/india-accuses-pakistan-of-being-terrorist-state-17-die-kashmir>
. The raid took place in town of Uri near the line of control that divides the 
contested Himalayan territory of Kashmir.

Four days later, India denounced Pakistan at the UN as the host of the “Ivy 
League of terrorism”.

Islamabad says India has provided no evidence linking the attack either to 
militants based in Pakistan or to the country’s intelligence agencies, which 
have long been accused of complicity with anti-India jihadi groups.

Pakistan’s defence minister has even suggested that India itself carried out 
the attack to deflect attention from its ongoing struggle to quell popular 
disturbances in the Indian part ofKashmir

Tensions have been fuelled by television networks and social media on both 
sides of the border, with some pundits appearing to relish the prospect of 
all-out nuclear war.

Some Indian hawks have demanded retaliatory attacks against suspected militant 
camps in Pakistan, but Modi has sought to punish Islamabad with steps that fall 
short of military means.

His strategy is, however, far tougher than the relative restraint shown by 
previous Indian governments during earlier crises, such as that prompted bythe 
four-day assault on Mumbai 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/30/mumbai-terrorism-attacks>by 
Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba in 2008.

In recent weeks, Modi has publicly backed separatist rebels in the restive 
Pakistani province of Balochistan, a move that has infuriated Islamabad. He has 
also questioned a key cross-border river treaty and vowed to orchestrate 
Pakistan’s diplomatic isolation.

That promise became reality on Wednesday when it became clear four out of 
SAARC’s eight members would not attend the summit, which it is Pakistan’s turn 
to host.

Afghanistan’s foreign ministry, which has long accused Pakistan of supporting 
the Taliban-led insurgency, was most stinging in its criticism, denouncing “the 
increased level of violence and fighting as a result of imposed terrorism on 
Afghanistan”.

Nine months ago, hopes were high for a rapprochement between India and 
Pakistan followingModi’s surprise visit to Lahore on Christmas day, the first 
time an Indian leader had set foot in Pakistan since 2004

, determined to end the decades’ long standoff and open up trade.

The two countries have fought three wars over Kashmir since independence and 
partition in 1947. Both sides occupy half of the Muslim-majority former 
princedom and claim it in its entirety for themselves.

Historic links across the former British colony have been largely severed. 
There are just three flights a week connecting Pakistani and Indian cities, and 
trade between two countries is worth only $3bn (£2.3bn), a negligible figure in 
relative terms, given their combined population of 1.5 billion.


Many analysts believe Modi’s December visit to Lahore angered Pakistan’s 
military establishment, which does not share Sharif’s enthusiasm for the rapid 
normalisation of relations with India.

Delhi initially showed restraint after militants attacked its Pathankot 
airbase near the border with Pakistan on 2 January. It blamed the 
Pakistan-based group Jaish-e-Mohammad, but allowed Pakistani officials to visit 
the airbase to help with the investigation.

Indian patience has since run out, however, not least because of Islamabad’s 
lack of action against either Jaish-e-Mohammad or Lashkar-e-Taiba.

Pakistan’s criticism of India for its security forces’ killing of Burhan Wani, 
a Kashmiri separatist commander whose death on 8 July hassparked months of 
civilian protests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/kashmir-death-toll-23-protests-shooting-burhan-wani-independence-violence>
, has further poisoned relations.

Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the US and critic of his 
country’s policies in the region, said it was not surprising that “India was 
looking to other forms of coercion because they feel frustrated by our 
behaviour”.

“But Pakistan has a tremendous capacity to withstand coercion and a mindset 
that wants eternal confrontation with India that is too deeply entrenched,” he 
said.

On Monday, Modi ordered water officials to step up efforts to divert a greater 
share of the three rivers the countries share under the Indus treaty, a 1960 
agreement that has survived their subsequent conflicts.

“Blood and water cannot flow together,” Modi said, a rare invocation of 
India’s power to meddle with the Indus river system, which flows downstream 
into Pakistan and provides water to 65% of the country’s landmass.

Himanshu Thakkar, the coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers 
and People, said it would take up to a decade to build dams capable of reducing 
the flow to Pakistan.

“But it sends a signal, and that signal will have an impact,” he said. “If 
India builds projects to store water from its entitlement, it will provide a 
means for India to control water flow to Pakistan, even temporarily.”

On Tuesday, Pakistan complained to the World Bank, which brokered the original 
treaty, urging it to prevent India from starting construction work on the 
Neelum and Chenab rivers.
