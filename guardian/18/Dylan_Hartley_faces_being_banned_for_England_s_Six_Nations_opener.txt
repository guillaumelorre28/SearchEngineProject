Dylan Hartley <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dylan-hartley> will learn on 
Wednesday if he will be available to lead England into the Six Nations 
Championship after being sent off for the third time in his career.

Hartley will appear before at an independent hearing to discover the length of 
his ban for thestiff-arm tackle on Sean O’Brien in Northampton’s Champions Cup 
defeat by Leinster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/09/northampton-leinster-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report>
 on Friday night.

O’Brien failed a head injury assessment after being struck from behind by the 
England’s captain, who had only been on the pitch for six minutes as a 
second-half replacement.

Details of the charge Hartley faces have yet to be issued – the offence may 
fall under striking or dangerous tackle – but given his poor disciplinary 
record, a substantial ban is certain. A suspension of eight weeks and above 
would rule him out of theSix Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sixnations> opener against France at 
Twickenham on 4 February, resulting in the likely promotion of Owen Farrell to 
the captaincy.

The tackle has been widely condemned and has left the England head coach, 
Eddie Jones <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/eddie-jones>, facing awkward 
questions having appointed Hartley as captain despite a rap sheet that includes 
biting, gouging, butting and swearing at a referee.

In his defence, Hartley has led the national team with distinction throughout 
Jones’s reign and completed a flawless first year comprising of 13 successive 
victories.
