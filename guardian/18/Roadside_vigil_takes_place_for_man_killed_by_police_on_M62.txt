The father of a man shot dead by police on the M62 motorway accused senior 
officers of failing to offer condolences to his family in person as dozens of 
mourners held a roadside vigil at the scene of the shooting.

Mohammed Yaqub, 59, said he had not been contacted by anyone from West 
Yorkshire police in the seven days since his son, Yassar Yaqub, was shot by an 
officer in Huddersfield.

A gun was later found in the passenger footwell of the white Audi that the 
28-year-old was travelling in whenarmed police fired three gunshots

 through his windscreen last Monday.

Speaking as about 60 friends and relatives gathered at the M62 slip road to 
mark a week since his son was shot, Yaqub said: “Not a single police officer 
has come to my house or rang me since that day.”

West Yorkshire police issued a statement from its chief constable, Dee 
Collins, on Friday evening extending “sincere sympathies” to Yaqub’s family for 
what it described as a “tragic incident”.

But Yaqub said he believed the statement was released in response to unrest 
over the shooting in communities across Bradford and Huddersfield. “They put 
out a statement but nothing personally to me,” he told the Guardian. “They just 
put that out to keep the public quiet. No person whatsoever has been to my 
house even to say this is what’s happened.

“Even in a third-world country you would expect some sympathy. They put that 
public statement out for their own benefit, not for my family, because they 
haven’t spoken to us about it.”

Yaqub said he had to wait five hours before police officially confirmed his 
son’s death despite him asking officers at the scene for information soon after 
the shooting.

To chants of “no justice, no humanity, no peace” and “no more killing,” 
friends and relatives of Yaqub – including his partner and their two children – 
held banners accusing the police of unlawful killing and placed flowers on the 
grass verge near where he was shot.

One banner said: “He was a civilian and deserved to be treated within the 
means of the law”. Another read: “Rest in peace daddy #justiceforyassar” and 
many wore clothes emblazoned with: “No chance to surrender. No warning shots. 
Unlawful killing #justiceforyassar.”

At the vigil, Yaqub’s brother-in-law, Isaa Akbar, described the 28-year-old as 
a “big hearted” person and not the local drugs kingpin as he had been portrayed.

He repeated the family’s demand for answers: “The whole shooting seems to have 
taken place in a matter of seconds. The [police] car stormed in front of them, 
let three shots off into the passenger side of the car – the police didn’t get 
out of the car. We just wanted answers for what happened on that day.”

Akbar, 26, added: “We all fear the police now. The people who are supposed to 
be protecting us.”

The Independent Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> Complaints 
Commission is investigating the death. A West Yorkshire police spokeswoman said 
the IPCC was handling the role of family liaison.

West Yorkshire police has said the “pre-planned” operation was launched 
following a tip-off about a suspected illegal firearm.

Moshin Amin, who was arrested during the operation, appeared in court on 
Friday charged with possessing a converted self-loading pistol, a silencer and 
11 rounds of ammunition without a firearms certificate.
