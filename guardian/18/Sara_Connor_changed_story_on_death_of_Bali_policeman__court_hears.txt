An Indonesian police officer has told the murder trial of Australian woman 
Sara Connor that she had at first claimed the death of a policeman was 
self-defence, only to change her story two days later.

Connor is standing trial with her British boyfriend, David Taylor, in a Bali 
court

Sulhadi, the chief of the Denpasar police crime with violence unit, 
interrogated Connor and Taylor after she was arrested.


He told the court on Thursday that on the first two days of interrogation 
Connor had claimed Sudarsa’s death was self-defence but on the third day, she 
finally told him what had happened.


“Sara told and showed [me] how David was struggling with the victim. Sara said 
she hit him once when she was bitten by the victim, but that was according to 
what David said,” Sulhadi said.

“She showed me her right arm and thigh, which was bitten. I recorded it. She 
showed it herself, with her translator who was acting as the victim.”
