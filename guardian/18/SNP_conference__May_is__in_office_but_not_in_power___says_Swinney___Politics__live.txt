Afternoon summary

 * Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has said that she wants to  
explore “creative” solutions that might allow Scotland to stay in the single 
market.In interviews at the SNP conference in Glasgow, she stressed that she 
was not “rushing” towards a second independence referendum. She said that she 
would be publishing plans that could enable Scotland to remain in the single 
market, even if the rest of the UK takes a different approach to Brexit. At one 
point she mentioned Iceland as a potential model. (See 9.18am.)

 At another she suggested a solution could involve the Scots keeping EU 
passports. (See3.19pm.)

 * Number 10 has suggested that Theresa May would oppose an attempt by the 
Scottish government to hold a second independence referendum.(See 1.06pm.)

 Earlier Sturgeon said it was “inconceivable” that London would try to block a 
second poll. 
 * The SNP conference has overwhelmingly backed a resolution saying that “if 
no viable solution to safeguard our membership as part of the UK exists, 
Scotland should prepare for a second independence referendum and seek to remain 
in Europe as an independent country”. Speaking in support of it, Mike Russell, 
the Scottish Brexit minister, said: 
We have to speak as a nation, we have to discuss as a nation, we have to act 
as a nation. And that is what we will do at every stage of the negotiations. We 
will not accept the arrogant assumption that we can sit in the corner while 
somebody else speaks on behalf of the vital interests ofScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>. That will never happen, never ever.

 * Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, has condemned Theresa 
May’s “depressing little England” while welcoming the Austraian Brain family, 
who successfully fought deportation, to the conference. Salmond criticised the 
way the Home Office treated the Brian and he contrasted Scotland’s approach to 
immigrants with the Conservative government’s. He said: 
They say that people who choose to live and work in our country are a problem 
and need to be kicked out, we say they are an asset and must stay with us.

They say that other Europeans among us are cards to be played or bargaining 
chips to be staked, we say they are our fellow citizens, the workers at our 
side, the nurses in our hospitals, people with rights which must be respected.

They want lists of foreign workers so they can name and shame companies who 
employ them, but let me tell you the shame is not with the companies - the 
shame is with a government who proposed this repellent notion. We want a 
country living and growing with no fear in celebrating our diversity.

We should be grateful to the Tory party. In their Birmingham conference they 
lifted the lid on the true intent and the emptiness of their programme.

If we stick to London rule then we know exactly what lies in store. Boiled 
down to its essence a closed, intolerant, backward-looking society. Theresa 
May’s little England - has there ever been a more miserable, depressing, 
backward-looking notion ever offered to the people of this nation?

Contrasting Scotland’s pro-immigration approach with the London government’s 
more negative approach to immigration has been one of the dominant themes of 
speeches and debates all afternoon.

 * John Swinney, the Scottish deputy first minster and education secretary, 
has said EU citizens who come to Scotland to study at university next year will 
not have to pay tuition fees despite the Brexit vote.He said EU students from 
outside the UK starting courses in 2017-18 will still receive a free university 
education. The UK government has announced EU citizens starting at English 
universities in 2017-18 will continue to be eligible for student loans and 
grants. 
 * Swinney has described May as “in office but not in power”, claiming her 
government’s priorities are being decided not by her but by rightwing, 
pro-leave Tories. In a separate speech Angus Robertson, the party’s leader at 
Westminster and its newly elected deputy leader, said May’s days were 
“numbered” if she ignored Scotland’s desire to stay in the EU. He said: 
Theresa May says that options for keeping Scotland in the EU are impractical, 
that we’ve had our referendum and that there will be a UK approach to Brexit.

She refuses to accept that for Scotland, for us, remain means remain. 

My message to the prime minister is this: if you continue to ignore the 
express will of the people of Scotland, if you refuse to even consider how we 
might protect Scotland’s place in the EU, then be in no doubt, your days as 
prime minister of a United Kingdom are numbered.

That’s all from me for today.

I will be blogging again from the conference tomorrow, when Sturgeon will 
deliver her keynote address.

I’m afraid an analysis of John Swinney’s local government reform plans will 
have to wait, but the Scottish commentatorLesley Riddoch has written a short 
blog about them. 
<http://www.lesleyriddoch.co.uk/2016/10/will-snp-deliver-real-local-democracy.html>
 Here’s an excerpt.

Creating a new tier of muscular town, island and village councils is radical. 
Creating more talking shops is not. We need real local councils not more 
centralisation or top-slicing existing council budgets to hand cash to 
un-elected head teachers. If SNP leadership doesnt realise it is seriously 
behind the curve on genuinely local democracy - and wastes the opportunity to 
do difficult structural reform at the start of a 5 year parliament - that 
failure will come back to bite the SNP just as “radical” land reform did last 
year.

the moment.

But don’t worry, I won’t be deterred. I’ll be doing my best to sent the blog 
shooting up the ‘most read chart’ with an analysis of John Swinney’s local 
government reform plans ...

The SNP is strongly pro-EU, but one speaker has just admitted to voting leave. 
He says that he is available for BuzzFeed’s Jamie Ross, who has been on the 
quest for a Nat outer.
Jamie Ross (@JamieRoss7) 
Holy shit. Someone on stage just said "Jamie Ross from BuzzFeed was looking 
for a Leave voter. Jamie, your search is over". Here we go!

A speaker is now complaining that the wording of the motion is too tame. The 
motion says takingScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> out of the 
EU against its will would be “unacceptable”. That is wrong, the speaker says; 
it would be “bloody outrageous”.

At another point the motion says conference expresses its “disappointment” 
about the Brexit vote. “God help us,” says the speaker.

He says the motion should be sent back for a re-write so some proper outrage 
gets included.

The debate is not being interrupted by points of order. Two people who say 
they oppose the motion have complained about not being called.

As my colleague Libby Brooks points out, members take the proceedings here 
seriously.

Debate on independence and Brexit

SNP members are now debating a lengthy motion on independence and Brexit. It 
says that it would be “democratically unacceptable if Scotland were to be 
dragged out of Europe against its will” and that although “every avenue” must 
be explored to keep Scotland in the EU, ‘if no viable solution to safeguard our 
membership as part of the UK exists,Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> should prepare for a second 
independence referendum and seek to remain in Europe as an independent country.”

The motion is being backed by SNP MPs and ministers in the Scottish 
parliament, but some speakers are opposing it on the grounds that it would 
remove the discretion Nicola Sturgeon has to pursue independence as she sees 
best. One member also pointed out that, although the motion talks about staying 
in the EU as a priority, Sturgeon redefined her goal yesterday,saying remaining 
in the single market is now the priority.

And he finished by saying he would give improving education his “relentless 
focus”.

I believe the single best route out of poverty is education.

I believe the single most powerful weapon we have to fight poverty is 
education.

We will bring the whole education system together behind our purpose. The 
expansion of childcare to 30 hours per week. The focus of school education 
unreservedly on learning and teaching. The widening of access to university. 
The strengthening of apprenticeships. The linking of college to the world of 
work. All comes together in the same National Mission. To free every single 
child from the burden of poverty.

I will give it my relentless focus. I will not rest until we have delivered 
the best possible future for every young person inScotland

Swinney turns to Labour.

When Amber Rudd announced her sinister list of foreign workers, 

Labour didn’t stand up in defiance. 

Instead their press office said the Tories had not gone far enough.

Shame. Shame. Shame on the pathetic Labour Party.

Now, there will be a few in Labour as horrified as we are at their collective 
moral failure.

Kezia Dugdale tweeted “not in my name”.

But let’s be clear. 

For as long as Kezia Dugdale insists on powers over immigration, Europe and 
all the rest remaining in London, Kezia shares the blame.

Swinney is referring to a press statement Labour put out criticising the fact 
that the government had not met the immigration targets it set itself.

Labour tweeted this.

Swinney announced a guarantee of student funding.

We have already confirmed tuition fee funding to support EU students studying 
here, or preparing to start this year.

Now, we will extend that guarantee to those starting next year in 2017/18.

And, unlike Labour and the Tories, that’s tuition-free education we are 
guaranteeing – not the massive fees they impose on students wherever they come 
from.

But let me go further. 

We will guarantee their funding. But what I demand is that the Tory-Brexit 
government guarantee their right to stay here during the studies and work here 
after their studies.

They are not “cards” to be played.

They are human beings. 

To use them as negotiating chips is obscene and we will have no part of it.

Swinney says May is 'in office but not in power'

Swinney says Theresa May is “in office but not in power”.

Theresa May is in office but it is already obvious that she is not in power. 

A Remain voter – apparently – she is being driven by the Tory hard-right to a 
hard-Brexit just as David Cameron was driven to a referendum by those self-same 
hard-right Brexiteers in the first place.

The consequences can barely be contemplated.

He is echoing the phrase Norman Lamont used when he delivered a withering 
attack on the then prime minister, John Major, following his resignation as 
chancellor in 1993.

And he praises Nicola Sturgeon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon> for her conduct on the 
morning after the EU referendum.

While Boris and Gove panicked, Cameron resigned and Corbyn went missing, it 
was Nicola Sturgeon who rejected the xenophobia of Farage, reassured our EU 
friends here inScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> and defended 
our relationship with Europe.

In that moment, there was a crisis of leadership in London. Here in Scotland, 
leadership had its finest hour.

 * Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has said that she wants to  
explore “creative” solutions that might allow Scotland to stay in the single 
market.In interviews at the SNP conference in Glasgow, she stressed that she 
was not “rushing” towards a second independence referendum. She said that she 
would be publishing plans that could enable Scotland to remain in the single 
market, even if the rest of the UK takes a different approach to Brexit. At one 
point she mentioned Iceland as a potential model. (See 9.18am.)

 At another she suggested a solution could involve the Scots keeping EU 
passports. (See3.19pm.)

 * Number 10 has suggested that Theresa May would oppose an attempt by the 
Scottish government to hold a second independence referendum.(See 1.06pm.)

 Earlier Sturgeon said it was “inconceivable” that London would try to block a 
second poll. 
 * The SNP conference has overwhelmingly backed a resolution saying that “if 
no viable solution to safeguard our membership as part of the UK exists, 
Scotland should prepare for a second independence referendum and seek to remain 
in Europe as an independent country”. Speaking in support of it, Mike Russell, 
the Scottish Brexit minister, said: 
We have to speak as a nation, we have to discuss as a nation, we have to act 
as a nation. And that is what we will do at every stage of the negotiations. We 
will not accept the arrogant assumption that we can sit in the corner while 
somebody else speaks on behalf of the vital interests ofScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>. That will never happen, never ever.

 * Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, has condemned Theresa 
May’s “depressing little England” while welcoming the Austraian Brain family, 
who successfully fought deportation, to the conference. Salmond criticised the 
way the Home Office treated the Brian and he contrasted Scotland’s approach to 
immigrants with the Conservative government’s. He said: 
They say that people who choose to live and work in our country are a problem 
and need to be kicked out, we say they are an asset and must stay with us.

They say that other Europeans among us are cards to be played or bargaining 
chips to be staked, we say they are our fellow citizens, the workers at our 
side, the nurses in our hospitals, people with rights which must be respected.

They want lists of foreign workers so they can name and shame companies who 
employ them, but let me tell you the shame is not with the companies - the 
shame is with a government who proposed this repellent notion. We want a 
country living and growing with no fear in celebrating our diversity.

We should be grateful to the Tory party. In their Birmingham conference they 
lifted the lid on the true intent and the emptiness of their programme.

If we stick to London rule then we know exactly what lies in store. Boiled 
down to its essence a closed, intolerant, backward-looking society. Theresa 
May’s little England - has there ever been a more miserable, depressing, 
backward-looking notion ever offered to the people of this nation?

Contrasting Scotland’s pro-immigration approach with the London government’s 
more negative approach to immigration has been one of the dominant themes of 
speeches and debates all afternoon.

 * John Swinney, the Scottish deputy first minster and education secretary, 
has said EU citizens who come to Scotland to study at university next year will 
not have to pay tuition fees despite the Brexit vote.He said EU students from 
outside the UK starting courses in 2017-18 will still receive a free university 
education. The UK government has announced EU citizens starting at English 
universities in 2017-18 will continue to be eligible for student loans and 
grants. 
 * Swinney has described May as “in office but not in power”, claiming her 
government’s priorities are being decided not by her but by rightwing, 
pro-leave Tories. In a separate speech Angus Robertson, the party’s leader at 
Westminster and its newly elected deputy leader, said May’s days were 
“numbered” if she ignored Scotland’s desire to stay in the EU. He said: 
Theresa May says that options for keeping Scotland in the EU are impractical, 
that we’ve had our referendum and that there will be a UK approach to Brexit.

She refuses to accept that for Scotland, for us, remain means remain. 

My message to the prime minister is this: if you continue to ignore the 
express will of the people of Scotland, if you refuse to even consider how we 
might protect Scotland’s place in the EU, then be in no doubt, your days as 
prime minister of a United Kingdom are numbered.

That’s all from me for today.

I will be blogging again from the conference tomorrow, when Sturgeon will 
deliver her keynote address.

I’m afraid an analysis of John Swinney’s local government reform plans will 
have to wait, but the Scottish commentatorLesley Riddoch has written a short 
blog about them. 
<http://www.lesleyriddoch.co.uk/2016/10/will-snp-deliver-real-local-democracy.html>
 Here’s an excerpt.

Creating a new tier of muscular town, island and village councils is radical. 
Creating more talking shops is not. We need real local councils not more 
centralisation or top-slicing existing council budgets to hand cash to 
un-elected head teachers. If SNP leadership doesnt realise it is seriously 
behind the curve on genuinely local democracy - and wastes the opportunity to 
do difficult structural reform at the start of a 5 year parliament - that 
failure will come back to bite the SNP just as “radical” land reform did last 
year.
 
The conference finished its proceedings for the day passing a resolution 
saying that current tax treaties with developing countries “operate to the 
severe disadvantage of many of the poorest countries in the world” and that 
they should be replaced with fair treaties.

shooting up the ‘most read chart’ with an analysis of John Swinney’s local

The SNP is strongly pro-EU, but one speaker has just admitted to voting leave. 
He says that he is available for BuzzFeed’s Jamie Ross, who has been on the 
quest for a Nat outer.

Holy shit. Someone on stage just said "Jamie Ross from BuzzFeed was looking

A speaker is now complaining that the wording of the motion is too tame. The 
motion says takingScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> out of the 
EU against its will would be “unacceptable”. That is wrong, the speaker says; 
it would be “bloody outrageous”.

At another point the motion says conference expresses its “disappointment” 
about the Brexit vote. “God help us,” says the speaker.

He says the motion should be sent back for a re-write so some proper outrage 
gets included.
 
Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, the SNP MP, is speaking now.

We don’t trust the Tory government to get the best deal [for Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> on Brexit.] They don’t even trust 
each other.
 
The debate is not being interrupted by points of order. Two people who say 
they oppose the motion have complained about not being called.

seriously.

<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> is a rational nation, and it will 
adopt a rational approach, he says.

He says Scotland will never accept the right of other people to speak on 
Scotland’s behalf.
 
SNP members are now debating a lengthy motion on independence and Brexit. It 
says that it would be “democratically unacceptable if Scotland were to be 
dragged out of Europe against its will” and that although “every avenue” must 
be explored to keep Scotland in the EU, ‘if no viable solution to safeguard our 
membership as part of the UK exists,Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> should prepare for a second 
independence referendum and seek to remain in Europe as an independent country.”

The motion is being backed by SNP MPs and ministers in the Scottish 
parliament, but some speakers are opposing it on the grounds that it would 
remove the discretion Nicola Sturgeon has to pursue independence as she sees 
best. One member also pointed out that, although the motion talks about staying 
in the EU as a priority, Sturgeon redefined her goal yesterday,saying remaining 
in the single market is now the priority.

Swinney then moved on to the passage about devolving power. (See 1.44pm.)

And he finished by saying he would give improving education his “relentless 
focus”.

I believe the single best route out of poverty is education.

I believe the single most powerful weapon we have to fight poverty is 
education.

We will bring the whole education system together behind our purpose. The 
expansion of childcare to 30 hours per week. The focus of school education 
unreservedly on learning and teaching. The widening of access to university. 
The strengthening of apprenticeships. The linking of college to the world of 
work. All comes together in the same National Mission. To free every single 
child from the burden of poverty.

I will give it my relentless focus. I will not rest until we have delivered 
the best possible future for every young person inScotland

Swinney turns to Labour.

When Amber Rudd announced her sinister list of foreign workers, 

Labour didn’t stand up in defiance. 

Instead their press office said the Tories had not gone far enough.

Shame. Shame. Shame on the pathetic Labour Party.

Now, there will be a few in Labour as horrified as we are at their collective 
moral failure.

Kezia Dugdale tweeted “not in my name”.

But let’s be clear. 

For as long as Kezia Dugdale insists on powers over immigration, Europe and 
all the rest remaining in London, Kezia shares the blame.

Swinney is referring to a press statement Labour put out criticising the fact 
that the government had not met the immigration targets it set itself.

Labour tweeted this.

Nicola Sturgeon tweeted this comment in response.

Is this really Labour's response to the Tories' increasingly intolerant 
language about 'foreigners'?https://t.co/iVws3Yuyim <https://t.co/iVws3Yuyim>

Swinney announced a guarantee of student funding.

We have already confirmed tuition fee funding to support EU students studying 
here, or preparing to start this year.

Now, we will extend that guarantee to those starting next year in 2017/18.

And, unlike Labour and the Tories, that’s tuition-free education we are 
guaranteeing – not the massive fees they impose on students wherever they come 
from.

But let me go further. 

We will guarantee their funding. But what I demand is that the Tory-Brexit 
government guarantee their right to stay here during the studies and work here 
after their studies.

They are not “cards” to be played.

They are human beings. 

To use them as negotiating chips is obscene and we will have no part of it.
 
Swinney says Theresa May is “in office but not in power”.

Theresa May is in office but it is already obvious that she is not in power. 

A Remain voter – apparently – she is being driven by the Tory hard-right to a 
hard-Brexit just as David Cameron was driven to a referendum by those self-same 
hard-right Brexiteers in the first place.

The consequences can barely be contemplated.

He is echoing the phrase Norman Lamont used when he delivered a withering 
attack on the then prime minister, John Major, following his resignation as 
chancellor in 1993.
 
And he praises Nicola Sturgeon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon> for her conduct on the 
morning after the EU referendum.

While Boris and Gove panicked, Cameron resigned and Corbyn went missing, it 
was Nicola Sturgeon who rejected the xenophobia of Farage, reassured our EU 
friends here inScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> and defended 
our relationship with Europe.

In that moment, there was a crisis of leadership in London. Here in Scotland, 
leadership had its finest hour.
