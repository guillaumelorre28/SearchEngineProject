The former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt has announced that he will 
run for the presidency of the European parliament in a race given added 
significance by the key role the 751-seat assembly could play in Britain’s 
departure from the EU.

“In these insecure, turbulent times, when Europe is threatened by nationalists 
and populists of all kinds, we need visionaries, bridge-builders and 
compromise-seekers alike,” Verhofstadt said in avideo on his Facebook page

Verhofstadt, the Belgian leader of the liberal ALDE group in the parliament, 
wasappointed its lead Brexit negotiator

 in September. He said he hoped to build “a broad coalition of all pro-European 
forces that will put the interests of European citizens first”.

MEPs will elect their president on 17 January after the departure of Martin 
Schulz, who said in November thathe was stepping down

 to return to German politics. The new president will serve until European 
elections in 2019.

The parliament will play a crucial role in Brexit since it must ratify any 
divorce agreement between the remaining 27 EU member states and the UK. Theresa 
May aims to start the two-year exit process by triggering article 50before the 
end of March

.

A veteran and outspoken European federalist, Verhofstadt warned last month 
that the parliament could disrupt Britain’s departure unless it was given more 
than a token role in negotiations. Schulz has also said Britain would do well 
to take MEPs’ views seriously in talks.

Verhofstadt, who is expected to abandon his role as Brexit negotiator if he is 
elected president, is up against the Italians Antonio Tajani of the European 
People’s party (EPP) and Gianni Pittella, from the Progressive Alliance of 
Socialist and Democrats (S&D).

Under a much-derided agreement by senior MEPs to share the presidency between 
the two largest parliamentary groups, the role should pass automatically to the 
EPP candidate after the departure of Schulz, a Social Democrat.

Verhofstadt hopes his candidacy will build a socialist-liberal coalition 
against the centre right and has positioned himself as the candidate best able 
to “bridge the gap between right and left … Somebody who can actually win”.

However, the left has rebuffed him, saying it would “exclude any possible 
under the table deal with the ALDE or any other group”. Pittella said the 
parliament needed “a real and truly competitive election … This is how 
democracy works.”

This position may give Tajani the top job. The centre-right candidate can 
count on the support of his group’s 217 MEPs and should win enough votes from 
smaller rightwing groups to claim victory.

Without a deal giving him the backing of Verhofstadt’s 68 liberal MEPs, the 
votes of Pittella’s 189 S&D MEPs are unlikely to be enough for him to be 
elected.
