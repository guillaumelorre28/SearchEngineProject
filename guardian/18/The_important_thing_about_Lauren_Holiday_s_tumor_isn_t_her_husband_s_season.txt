What’s the worst thing about discovering that one of the finest players of her 
generation has been diagnosed with a brain tumor while pregnant? Is it that 
someone beloved and admired by fans across the world has a potentially 
life-threatening condition? Or that a time that should be full of happiness and 
hope is instead filled with dread and anxiety? Or perhaps it’s the reminder 
that even the healthiest and strongest of us can be struck down by grave 
illness?

Maybe all of those thoughts flashed through your mind when you read the news 
that Lauren Holiday had been diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of just 
28, and just six weeks away from the birth of her child. But then again, if you 
read most of the stories on the subject, your main takeaway would probably have 
been that theNew Orleans Pelicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-orleans-hornets> will be without one of 
their guards for the start of the NBA season. Yes, this isn’t a human tragedy 
but the very real possibility that the Pelicans could end the season 13th in 
the Western Conference rather than 12th.

Holiday won two Olympic gold medals and the World Cup in 2015 but – as is all 
too common with female athletes – found herself being defined by the man she is 
married to, in this case the Pelicans guard, Jrue Holiday. Bleacher Report 
NBA’s headline didn’t even bother to mention Lauren Holiday by name, just 
referring to her as Jrue’s “pregnant wife”:

Even if you take away the fact that Lauren’s athletic accomplishments are 
greater than her husband’s – she scored in the 2015 World Cup final – you’d 
think they may want to mention the person with a brain tumor by their, you 
know, name. Bleacher Report wasn’t the only culprit. There was also ESPN: “Jrue 
Holiday to be out to support wife, ex-soccer star Lauren Holiday”, Sports 
Illustrated (who didn’t even mention Lauren Holiday by name): “Jrue Holiday to 
miss start of season as wife recovers from brain surgery” and the Associated 
Press: “Pelicans’ Holiday taking leave for wife’s brain surgery”. The AP story 
goes on to tell us important facts such as that “Jrue Holiday has been with New 
Orleans the past three seasons, but has spent most of that stint injured. He 
expects to return this season in full health and the Pelicans see him as a core 
player along with all-star forward Anthony Davis.” But nowhere does it mention 
that Lauren is expected to return to full health and that the baby’s 
development shouldn’t be affected.

The coverage was noted on Twitter:

But this is by no means the first time the media has defined a female athlete 
by her husband this summer. Last month, the Chicago Tribune reported Corey 
Cogdell-Unrein’s bronze medal at the Olympics with the following tweet:

The paper later acknowledged their mistake and admitted Cogdell-Unrein was 
“awesome on her own”.

There are, of course, more important things for the Holidays to worry about 
right now than how Lauren is described in the media. But acknowledging her 
struggle as her own rather than a subplot in the Pelicans’ new season would be 
basic decency. If they need any guidance on how to handle the story, maybe they 
can look to the words of Jrue: “My family comes before basketball,” hetold the 
New Orleans Times-Picayune 
<http://www.nola.com/pelicans/index.ssf/2016/09/jrue_holiday_asks_for_prayers.html>
. “I’m obviously blessed to play this game and be in the position I am in, but 
my wife is the most important thing in the world to me. She comes before 
anything else.”
