Order a cab in London, Mumbai, New York or Beijing, and chances are the driver 
will be a man. Female taxi drivers remain rare wherever you go, probably even 
more so in the cities where women and girls are most at risk ofsexual assault 
on public transport <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33979568>.

For one pioneering nonprofit organisation in India, which was last year ranked 
as the fourth most dangerous country in the world for awoman to take public 
transport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/delhi-gang-rape-india-women>, 
the answer is simple, practical and radical: put more women in the driver’s 
seat.

 After working for a year as a private chauffeur, Meenu will be able to apply 
for a commercial licence. 
Women on Wheels <http://www.planeterra.org/women-on-wheels-projects-90.php>, 
based in Delhi and now rolled out to Jaipur and Kolkata, has trained dozens of 
women to become taxi drivers. Over an eight-month course the students – 
invariably poor from surrounding slums - learn English, self defence, CPR, 
communication skills, and obtain their first driver’s licence. For many, their 
first ID card. After spending a year as a full-time chauffeur for a family they 
apply for a commercial licence and go on to work for a taxi firm that only 
employs women drivers.

 Pushpa changes a flat tyre as part of a driving workshop outside New Delhi. 
Claudio Montesano Casillas’s intimate and low-key photographs tell this story 
through the courage of individual women who have decided, often without telling 
anyone for fear of recrimination, to become taxi drivers. To enter what is 
traditionally seen - and not just inIndia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> - as an exclusively male occupation. 
The photos, seemingly natural and unposed, mark everyday moments on the road or 
in training.

 Hemlata changes a flat tire as part of a professional driving workshop. 
A close-up of the back of a woman’s head as she crouches down to change a 
tyre. The view out of a windscreen as a driver adjusts her rear view mirror and 
a man on the street watches her. A student frowning in concentration as she 
throws punches in a self-defence class.

 A Women on Wheels student participates in a self-defence course in Jaipur. 
The proud and determined expression of a qualified driver, one hand resting on 
the wheel of her car. There is perhaps no other city in the world that needs a 
project like Women on Wheels as much asDelhi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/delhi>, whereviolence against women has 
grown to endemic proportions.

 Fellow drivers at a traffic light ask 19-year-old Meenu why she’s driving. 
On average 4o crimes against women are registered daily by Delhi police 
<http://in.reuters.com/article/india-rape-anniversary-idINKBN0JU01U20141216>, 
including at least four cases of rape. Earlier this year anUber taxi driver was 
convicted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/20/uber-driver-convicted-of-raping-passenger-delhi-shiv-kumar-yadav>
 of raping a female passenger in the city. And it was in Delhi, in 2012, that a
23-year-old woman was fatally gang-raped by six men on a bus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/12/delhi-gang-rape-death-transformed-lives>
, sparking an international outcry and protests across India.

 Twenty-eight-year-old Pushpa tries to park the car within the red cones during 
a reverse parking exercise. 
Training women to become taxi drivers in a country where more than half of the 
5.5 million women who enter the workforce each year express serious concern for 
the safety of their commute doesn’t just benefit and empower the women who are 
driving. It makes the woman in the passenger seat safer, too.
