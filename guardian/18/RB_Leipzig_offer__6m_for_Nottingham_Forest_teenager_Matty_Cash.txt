Cash has made 12 appearances for Forest, who gave him his debut in August. His 
season was interrupted by an injury sustained in September which kept him out 
for two and a half months.

He joined Forest in 2014 from the FAB Academy, which gives a second chance to 
players released by professional clubs – in Cash’s case Wycombe Wanderers. Last 
season he spent time on loan at Dagenham & Redbridge in League Two, also 
playing 12 games.
