Cohen, who was born in Montreal, came to prominence in the 1960s as a poet, 
novelist and singer-songwriter. Originally focusing on literary pursuits, he 
shifted his attention to music in the late 60s when he moved to New York. His 
first album, Songs of Leonard Cohen, was released in 1967 and became a cult hit.

Cohen’s influence on the music industry has been likened to that of his 
contemporariesBob Dylan and Joni Mitchell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/05/bob-dylan-nobel-favourite-songwriter>
 and is perhaps best known for his song Hallelujah. Only a modest hit on its 
release in 1984, it found a much wider audience after it was covered by John 
Cale in 1991 and by Jeff Buckley in 1994.


After the song was taken to No 1 in the UK by X-Factor winner Alexandra Burke 
in 2008,Cohen said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2016/nov/11/leonard-cohen-death-tributes-singer-songwriter-live?page=with:block-5825396ae4b0364c919455f9#block-5825396ae4b0364c919455f9>
: “I think it’s a good song, but I think too many people sing it.”

'I bunked off school to go and see him': readers' tributes to Leonard Cohen

Despite his immense popularity, Cohen often appeared to be shy of the stage. 
Judy Collins, who had success with his song Suzanne, once described how she had 
to coax him back on stage after he left halfway through a performance.

He came out of retirement in his late 70s to embark what would end up being a 
five-year, worldwide tour, after his former manager, Kelley Lynch, was found 
guilty of stealing millions of dollars from him.

Cohen recently wrote a letter to his longtime muse, Marianne Ihlen, who was 
the subject of his songs So Long, Marianne, and Bird on a Wire, saying: “You 
know that I’ve always loved you for your beauty and your wisdom, but I don’t 
need to say anything more about that because you know all about that. But now, 
I just want to wish you a very good journey. Goodbye old friend. Endless love, 
see you down the road.”

For much of the 1960s, he lived with Ihlen on the Greek island of Hydra, 
during which time he wrote numerous books of poetry, including his experimental 
novel Beautiful Losers, and his first album.

In the 1970s, after his relationship with Ihlen dissolved, Cohen began a 
relationship with the artist Suzanne Elrod. The couple had two children, Adam 
and Lorca.


You Want It Darker was co-produced by Adam Cohen. Speaking recently with CBC 
Radio host Tom Power 
<http://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/schedule-for-monday-october-24-2016-1.3815495/joy-versus-pain-adam-cohen-on-working-with-father-leonard-1.3818479>
, he talked about working with his father on the album that many believed would 
be his last. “This old man, who was truly in pain and discomfort, would at some 
intervals get out of his medical chair and dance in front of his speakers,” he 
said. “And sometimes, we would put on a song and listen to it on repeat just 
like teenagers, with the help of medical marijuana.

“I think in states of pain and discomfort, what do you seek with more energy 
and more clarity than joy and jubilance?”

Adam described his father as “the last of his kind”.

“Unlike so many from that golden era, from which he comes, he’s not a 
nostalgia act,” he said. “This guy is speaking from his particular vantage 
point, he’s speaking about things that are meaningful to him at his particular 
rung in life – he will be leaving a giant void when he leaves us.”

You Want It Darker added to an impressive body of work. Cohen’s second album, 
1969’s Songs for a Room, featured what would become one of his most popular 
songs, Bird on the Wire. The song has been covered by artists including Johnny 
Cash, Joe Cocker, Willie Nelson, kd lang and Paul Kelly. Kris Kristofferson 
once said that he wanted the opening lyrics from Bird on the Wire engraved on 
his tombstone.

A year later, Cohen embarked upon an intense period of touring through Europe, 
Canada and the United States. He released his third album, Songs of Love and 
Hate, in 1971, which included the song Famous Blue Raincoat. The song, with its 
haunting depiction of the aftermath of a love triangle, was much-loved by fans, 
but Cohen reportedly told BBC in 1994 that he was never quite happy with the 
lyrics.

Cohen’s next two albums, New Skin for the Old Ceremony and Death of a Ladies’ 
Man, marked a shift to a new sound and a dip in his popularity. The latter was 
also an album fuelled by controversy; at one point during recording, producer 
Phil Spectorreportedly held a gun to Cohen’s head 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/19/leonard-cohen> in the studio.

In addition to giving his song Hallelujah a major boost, covers played a 
significant role and helped Cohen find a new audience in the late 80s, when the 
American artist Jennifer Warnes released a tribute album to him, effectively 
refashioning his image in the public eye.


Cohen was born into a Jewish family, but in the 1970s he began to devote 
significant attention to studying Buddhism. He met and became a disciple of 
Joshu Sasaki Roshi, a Zen Buddhist monk. Between 1994 and 1999, Cohen lived as 
the monk’s friend and student at the Mount Baldy Zen Center in Los Angeles.


Cohen continued to record and tour in the 1980s and early 90s. He released his 
album Ten New Songs in 2001, after emerging from the monastery, launching a new 
phase of his already decades-long career.

Cohen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.
