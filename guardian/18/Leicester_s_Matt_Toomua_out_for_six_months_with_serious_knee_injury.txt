The Tigers tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/LeicesterTigers/status/791239331163824129>: “Richard 
Cockerill confirms Matt Toomua having surgery on his knee and will be out for 
around six months. We wish him a speedy recovery.”

Toomua, who has 33 caps, including last year’s World Cup final against New 
Zealand, was injured during the first half of the European Champions Cuptie 
against Racing 92

 at Welford Road.

Toomua, who linked up with Leicester earlier this season following his move 
from ACT Brumbies, has made only two appearances.

The Racing game was his home debut and Leicester are unlikely to see him in 
action again until the closing weeks of the season.

Leicester are also without the England centre Manu Tuilagi

, who has not played since the season’s opening round of Premiership fixtures 
in early September.

The Tigers’ 27-17 victory over Racing put them back into Champions Cup 
contention followinga 42-13 defeat to Glasgow
