The Ryan Gosling-Emma Stone musical La La Land confirmed its frontrunner 
status for the best picture Oscar by taking the equivalent award here, and

NYFCC’s best actress gong – for two films, the Paul Verhoeven rape-revenge 
thriller Elle and Mia Hansen-Løve’s mid-life crisis drama Things to Come.
