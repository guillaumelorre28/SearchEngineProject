Tom Hayes, serving 11 years for rigging Libor rates, has hired a high-profile 
lawyer to take his appeal to theCriminal Cases Review Commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/criminal-cases-review-commission>, which 
investigates suspected miscarriages of justice.

The 36-year-old’s attempt to have his conviction overturned failed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/21/libor-trader-tom-hayes-loses-appeal-but-has-jail-sentence-cut-to-11-years>
 although three senior court of appeal judges reduced the sentence from 14 
years.

He has now hired Karen Todner – who led Gary McKinnon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/14/gary-mckinnon-no-uk-charges>’s 
case against extradiction to the US on charges of computer hacking – to present 
a case to the CCRC.

Todner, head of crime, regulatory and extradition at Kaim Todner, said: 
“Because Tom has already appealed his conviction and sentence, the Criminal 
Cases Review Commission is now Tom’s only hope of achieving justice.

“Tom’s family are now in possession of fresh evidence. We believe Tom has a 
strong case, which our submission to the CCRC will demonstrate,” said Todner.

In August, Hayes was found guilty of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/03/former-city-trader-tom-hayes-convicted-of-libor-rigging>
. He was diagnosed with mild Asperger’s syndrome shortly before his 10-week 
trial last May.

Hayes’s family said: “Karen has longstanding expertise in the areas where 
Tom’s case needs urgent review in order to right this wrong. Tom knew from the 
moment he met Karen that she understands him and the way he thinks, and that is 
the single most important thing to him.”

It was not immediately clear what fresh evidence had been found but Hayes and 
his supporters are seeking to raise up to £150,000 via crowdfunding. So far 
£2,135 has been raised on FundRazr.

Hayes, who is in Belmarsh prison,  has been ordered to pay £878,806 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/23/jailed-libor-trader-tom-hayes-must-pay-878000-pounds>
 after a ruling in the Old Bailey that the money was the proceeds of crime. The 
Serious Fraud Office was seeking up to £2.45m from Hayes.
