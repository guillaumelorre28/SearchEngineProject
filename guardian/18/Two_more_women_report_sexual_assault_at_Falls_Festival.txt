Five women have now reported sexual assaults, including an alleged rape, at 
the annual music festival.

Police earlier said two incidents occurred in the mosh pit area of the 
festival, being held at Marion Bay, about an hour’s drive from Hobart.

A young girl was assaulted on Thursday night during DJ Hot Dub Time Machine 
and another during hip-hop artist Illy’s performance. A third incident in the 
camping grounds on Thursday night was also reported.

The festival also suffered through a crowd crush this year, in the aftermath 
of which 19 people were treated in hospital, though none were seriously injured.
