Of the 90 pavilions built for Expo 67, Montreal’s 1967 “world’s fair” 
<https://www.pinterest.com/michelberg/expo-67/>, only two still stand 
more-or-less intact. One isBuckminster Fuller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jul/04/buckminster-fuller-architecture-design>
’s famed geodesic dome: though the acrylic cover burned off in a fire in 1976, 
the former United States pavilion is now theMontreal Biosphere 
<http://www.ec.gc.ca/biosphere/>, a museum devoted to the environment. The 
other pavilion to live on is Habitat 67 – the young Israeli-Canadian architect
Moshe Safdie <http://www.msafdie.com/>’s wildly ambitious, government-sponsored 
attempt at reimagining apartment living, and one of the most important 
buildings of the 1960s.


Part of Canada’s centenary celebrations, Expo 67 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEly-bm5eU0> was a point of pride for a city 
that was alive with newness – a new metro system, new downtown skyscrapers and 
a burgeoning Québécois nationalist movement (it was on a visit to Expo that 
Charles de Gaulle made his famous “Vive le Québec libre! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/aug/28/guardianobituaries.annemcilroy>” 
speech).

The event drew 50 million visitors (still an Expo world record) to what was 
then a country of 20 million and a city of under three million. And amid the 
various nations’ trumpeting and boasting, thesnaking monorail system 
<http://www.westland.net/expo67/map-docs/monorail.htm>, the snack bars and 
souvenir stands, stood a modular jumble of prefabricated concrete housing cubes 
which have since drawn comparisons to everything from Lego to a Cubist painting 
or the pueblos built by native tribes in the southwestern US.

Safdie returned home to Montreal with a mission: to 'reinvent the apartment 
building'

Habitat 67 echoes a little known post-war Japanese architectural movement 
called Metabolism, whose proponents believed buildings should be designed as 
living, organic, interconnected webs of prefabricated cells. Perhaps the most 
famous Metabolist incarnation is Tokyo’sNakagin Capsule Tower 
<http://www.failedarchitecture.com/nakagin-capsule-tower-shimbashi-tokyo/>, 
another pile of concrete cubes dotted with porthole-like windows, erected in 
1972. The influence of Le Corbusier, especially the French master’s love affair 
with concrete, on Habitat 67 is also clear. But Safdie set his own course, 
attempting to balance cold geometry against living, breathing nature.


It was while travelling across North America as a student that Safdie surveyed 
grim apartment high-rises and unsustainable suburban sprawl. He returned home 
to Montreal with a mission: to “reinvent the apartment building”. He longed to 
create, as he put it in a 2014 Ted Talk, “a building which gives the qualities 
of a house to each unit – Habitat would be all about gardens, contact with 
nature, streets instead of corridors” (each cube has access to a roof garden 
built atop an adjacent cube).

 Moshe Safdie’s 2014 Ted Talk 
Habitat 67 was a pilot project, intended as just the first application of a 
salve for urban ills that would spread across the world. Only it didn’t quite 
work out that way. The Walrus, Canada’s answer to the Atlantic magazine, called 
Habitat 67 a “failed dream <http://thewalrus.ca/for-everyone-a-garden/>”.

From the beginning, the finances were a mess. The budget – it was funded by 
the federal government’sCanada <https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada> 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation – spiralled out of control, despite the 
assembly line-style production, which was carried out at a specially built, 
on-site prefabrication plant. To recoup costs, the government set rents so high 
that no one could afford them. Then, as the 1960s began to fizzle out, modern 
utopian architecture did, too.

“By the early 70s you have a global economic downturn, the oil crisis, Nixon 
de-links the dollar from the gold standard, and the Vietnam war is raging ... 
the money for these types of projects simply dries up,” saysIndebir Singh Riar 
<http://carleton.ca/architecture/people/riar-inderbir/>, assistant professor of 
architecture at Carlton University in Ottawa.

 The concrete needed frequent repair. One former resident, who lived there 
more than a decade ago for three years (and stilll prefers to remain anonymous, 
lest he offend the building’s diehard cheerleaders), says he fled after 
developing asthma and finding his cat dead. “From an architectural point of 
view, it’s spectacular, but water got into that concrete, and mould seeped into 
the ventilation system. It blew the spores around.” By the mid-1980s, the 
building was in private hands.

Though there may be some truth in the pronouncement of Habitat 67’s failure, 
it doesn’t tell the whole story. Too much has been made of the socialist ideals 
the building supposedly embodied. Though Safdie has a history of kibbutz 
living, Habitat was never meant to be public housing; it was built for 
middle-class city-dwellers, the kind who flee to the green suburbs once they 
start a family.


Safdie himself still maintains a pied-à-terre in the 13-storey building, which 
stands on a narrow, man-made peninsula just south of the Old Port section of 
Montreal. Today Habitat apartments – many of them linking two or three cubes, 
luxuriously renovated and connected into sprawling residences with multiple 
terraces and views over the water – are often listed by Sotheby’s. Longtime 
resident Jeannie Saunders, whose home is a four-cube penthouse, says that 
Habitat will always be a “a community, where people have a feeling of 
friendship with neighbours, a special place to live”.

It may never have achieved affordability but the building, just two years shy 
of its 50th birthday, remains a potent symbol. In 2009, the Quebec government 
gave it heritage status, recognising that despite the controversies and 
maintenance issues, Habitat represents much more than a yuppified ghost of 
1960s idealism.

“Safdie’s expression ‘For everyone a garden’ is still an incredible idea,” 
says Riar. “At such a young age, he realised that suburbs are not necessarily 
bad, but city living is important. He asked: if people had more space and 
light, would they stay in the city? It’s a very noble idea.”
