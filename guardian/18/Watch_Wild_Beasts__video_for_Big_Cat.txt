Pop music is projecting a more political edge, after years of what some 
artists describe as apathy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/09/pop-political-british-musicians-paloma-faith>
. It’s almost as if, generationally speaking, the atomic impact of 
governmental, environmental and societal eruptions of recent years are finally 
being replicated in grim and angst-ridden prophecies – from the eerie post-war 
atmosphere of Jamie xx’s recent Romain Gavras-directed video forGosh

, to Radiohead’s sinisterBurn the Witch animation

. With the exception of Fergie’s wearily provocative video forMILF$ 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsUWK-fixiA>, the days of lazy, nude limbed 
titillation are temporarily fading.

The latest in line is Wild Beast’s Big Cat, a video set in a not-so-abstract 
dystopia, full of salacious sexuality, CCTV and the looming presence of a 
savage beast, which may or not be a metaphor for “The Man”. While the video is 
a combination of Karma Police and Paranoid Android, the song’s sound reflects 
the band’s more synthetic new direction: the Cumbrian group are far from the 
woodland splendours of former albums and now scuttling down alleys in the big, 
scary city. The urban foxes of the indie rock scene, perhaps.

“If Get My Bang was a song of the id then Big Cat is the ego,” says the band’s 
Hayden Thorpe. “It marked a breakthrough in the writing process for the album, 
defining the swagger and attitude that would come to shape [new album] Boy 
King. He is all powerful, but at what price?”
