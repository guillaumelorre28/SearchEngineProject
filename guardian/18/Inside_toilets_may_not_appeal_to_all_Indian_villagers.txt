As an anthropologist working on rural life in India, I find describing public 
defecation as “ingrained in India’s rural culture” an oversimplification of a 
complex problem of social life in country areas (Delhi council to shame people 
into using toilets

, 21 December).

It is true that cities such as Delhi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/delhi> 
have experienced an influx of migrants from the countryside, but one cannot 
dismiss rural habits quite so simply. My research has shown that rural folks 
have not taken up the government’s idea of building modern enclosed toilets in 
their villages because the old practice of open defecation was to avoid 
carrying back the smell inside their house, which modern enclosed toilets do 
not allow.

In villages, people choose to defecate outside to be close to nature and 
traditionally follow this practice with a shower. With severe water shortages 
in the countryside, hygiene practices have had to adjust to preserve water 
while also avoiding disease. The defecation area in the village is not random – 
it is a selected location and the act has to be followed by taking a shower.

The debate on open v enclosed defecating is a debate on how Indians define 
themselves with respect to traditional methods of remaining disease-free, water 
conservation, and notions of bodily purities and impurities. This debate cannot 
be resolved by Delhi bureaucrats, far removed from the natural, environmental, 
hygienic and social debate that is taking place in India’s villages.
