The Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> chairman, Malcolm 
Murray, has insisted that no final agreement has been reached over the club's 
transfer embargo despite the Scottish Football Association's earlier 
announcement that the newco club have accepted a 12-month ban.

Scottish football's governing body said Charles Green's newco – owned by Sevco 
Scotland Ltd – had agreed to a ban beginning on 1 September as a "primary 
condition" of gaining membership of the SFA, and therefore being granted 
permission to play in the Irn-Bru Third Division next season.

The agreement, which remains subject to final ratification, appeared to give 
the Rangers manager, Ally McCoist, the green light to add to his threadbare 
squad before the embargo comes into force.

But in a fresh twist to the Rangers saga, the club released a statement in 
which Murray claimed the SFA's announcement was "premature".

"Board members, the manager and senior executives from the club have been 
meeting with the SFA this week with the sole purpose of ensuring the long-term 
future of Rangers," Murray said in a statement on Friday night.

"For clarity, we have not signed any agreement yet and therefore believe the 
SFA's statement to be premature."

The embargo, plus a £160,000 fine, was handed down to Rangers by the SFA's 
independent appellate tribunal for a range of offences, chief among which was 
the club's failure to pay tax under the former owner Craig Whyte.

The Ibrox club successfully challenged the ban in the court of session, which 
ruled the sanction was not open to the SFA, which referred the matter back to 
the tribunal.

Punishments available to the tribunal included expulsion from the game and 
termination of membership of the SFA, and the SFA said such sanctions persuaded 
the newco to accept the embargo.
