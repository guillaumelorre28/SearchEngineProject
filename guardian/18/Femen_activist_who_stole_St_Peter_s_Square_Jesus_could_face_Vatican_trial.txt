An activist from the feminist group Femen who snatched the baby Jesus figurine 
from St Peter’s Square’s nativity scene on Christmas Day remains in custody in 
theVatican <https://www.theguardian.com/world/vatican>.

Iana Aleksandrovna Azhdanova, from Ukraine, was held in a Vatican cell on 
Friday, awaiting possible trial for “disturbing the peace, obscene acts in a 
public place, and theft”.

Azhdanova was naked from the waist up as she stormed the nativity scene and 
had the message “God Is Woman” daubed on her torso while thousands of pilgrims 
looked on.

Azhdanova was swiftly arrested by Vatican police after rushing into the square 
and plucking the baby Jesus from his place while shouting what were described 
as anti-religious slogans.

A papal spokesman, Federico Lombardi, said the Vatican was deciding whether to 
try Azhdanova, adding that the religiously hostile nature of her protest “must 
be regarded as extremely serious due to the setting and circumstances that 
intentionally offend the religious sentiments of a very large number of people”.

The Vatican – which can either try transgressors on its territory or expel 
them to Italian courts – is also holding Italian businessman Marcello di 
Finizio, who was arrested on Friday for scaling the facade of St Peter’s 
basilica to protest an EU directive.

Di Finizio says a measure forcing Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> to open up bidding for state 
concessions on operating beach-side businesses threatens the survival of the 
resort he runs in Trieste.
