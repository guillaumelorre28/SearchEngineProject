78 min It hasn’t really been a 4-0 game, but Swansea’s defence has really

72 min Routledge moves smoothly into the penalty area, but his cross is 
straight at Cech. The Liberty Stadium has gone very quiet.

68 min Iwobi, who’s moved to the left, took on the defender, fizzed it across 
the six-yard box, and Naughton, facing the wrong way, stabbed it past 
Fabianski. You have to feel for Swansea, but this game is over.

65 min Oh, and that was a chance for Fernandez! The ball was cleared, Kingsley 
slung it back it, and it fell kindly for Fernandez, who sidefooted it over the 
bar from 12 yards! A shame for Swansea that it didn’t fall to Sigurdsson.

61 min I think that second goal has now officially gone down as a Jack Cork 
own goal. But now Swansea must rouse themselves in the final 30 minutes. Do 
they have it in them?

57 min It was Jack Cork, actually, who got the telling deflection. Does that 
go down as an own goal? In the meantime, Leroy Fer is on for the ineffectual 
Nathan Dyer.

55 min Swansea just couldn’t clear it. The ball came back in, Iwobi found half 
a yard of space in the box, but his shot took a massive deflection off Mawson, 
was it, and it looped up and over Fabianski, who had no chance. A slice of ill 
fortune for Swansea, butArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
had applied so much pressure that the goal looked inevitable. It’s a long way 
back for Swansea now.

53 min Excellent save from Fabianksi to deny Ramsey. It was a super pass from 
Alexis, and Ramsey’s first touch was immaculate, but Fabianksi stayed big to 
block the shot with his legs. Swansea are under the cosh here.

48 min Oxlade-Chamberlain is still warming up. We’ll keep an eye on Giroud. 
Meanwhile, here’s Luke Forrester: “That challenge on Monreal was Naught On, 
there was simply no need Fer that. Simply a Dyer challenge. I bet poor old 
Nacho had Nordfeldt a tackle like that since his day in the under-21s. Still, 
Paul Clement probably appreciates a bit of bite from his squad – you could 
almost hear him under his breath: ‘Go on Mawson!’

“If Swansea want to win this then that grit in midfield will be Ki. Snatch a 
goal and last the 90 minutes? There’ll be champagne Corks popping later 
tonight!”

47 min Good defending from the excellent Mustafi, shepherding the ball out for 
a goal kick under pressure from Llorente. Why on earth did Everton let him go?

46 min Giroud is back on, through gritted teeth. He looked as though he was 
ready to come off at the end of that first half. We shall see how long he lasts.

Yep – he’s been disappointing.

Half-time: Swansea 0-1 Arsenal

Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> haven’t played well, 
but they lead: Giroud was the man of the moment, and swept home as Swansea 
stood and watched. Not a great game, but the visitors are now in control. See 
you shortly for the second half.

44 min Swansea have a man over, but Dyer chooses the wrong option, and shoots 
when he should have passed. It’s a mile over the bar. But Swansea have found a 
bit of zip since the goal.

43 min Swansea on the attack, and Ki goes down in the box. Is that a penalty? 
No, it’s a booking for Ki for diving! Koscielny stuck out a lazy leg, but Ki 
was definitely looking for it, and went down very easily. Koscielny didn’t get 
the ball, but it seemed as though Ki was on his way down before the contact 
came. Big call from Mike Jones, but I like it: I think it’s the right decision.

A great result for Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, 
even though they didn’t play that well. Swansea capitulated in the second half, 
and Paul Clement has serious work to do.

That’s the whistle.
 
90 min +2 More good play from McBurnie, but Borja heads his cross over the bar 
when he should have hit the target.
 
90 min Three pointless minutes of stoppage time.
 
89 min Routledge shot when he should have passed to Sigurdsson, and then 
McBurnie, who’s shown some good touches since coming on, heads over.
 
88 min We’re just playing time. This is Arsenal’s first ever Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> double over Swansea; they 
won 3-2 at the Emirates earlier in the season.
 
86 min Sigurdsson tests Cech, but he didn’t get any power.
 
85 min Alexis is in a huge sulk on the touchline, obviously upset at being 
taken off. Come on, man! Your team’s 4-0 up, and you’ve scored a goal. Turn 
that frown upside down!

83 min There’s something to be written on teams losing so comprehensively in 
the modern game. Why are there so many 0-3 and 0-4 scorelines this season? Are 
teams more brittle nowadays? Or is the deck stacked so heavily in favour of 
attacking players? Paging Jonathan Wilson.
 
81 min McBurnie does well to escape on the left side, but his cross is behind 
the trio of attacking players in support.
 
79 min Two final changes for Arsenal: Özil and Alexis are replaced by Welbeck 
and Perez.
 
78 min It hasn’t really been a 4-0 game, but Swansea’s defence has really 
struggled. And of course, two own goals don’t help. Leroy Fer is booked for a 
late tackle on Ramsey. That was naughty.
 
77 min Arsenal’s excellent goalscoring form in away matches continues.

74 min A slightly lucky ricochet off Routledge, and the ball found its way to 
Alexis, who reacted quickest and prodded home from six yards.

Alexis’s 14th goal of the season makes it 4-0. 
 
72 min Routledge moves smoothly into the penalty area, but his cross is 
straight at Cech. The Liberty Stadium has gone very quiet.
 
70 min Double change for Swansea: Borja and McBurnie on for Llorente and Cork.
 
68 min Iwobi, who’s moved to the left, took on the defender, fizzed it across 
the six-yard box, and Naughton, facing the wrong way, stabbed it past 
Fabianski. You have to feel for Swansea, but this game is over.

Oh dear. Another own goal, and it’s three-nil.
 
65 min Oh, and that was a chance for Fernandez! The ball was cleared, Kingsley 
slung it back it, and it fell kindly for Fernandez, who sidefooted it over the 
bar from 12 yards! A shame for Swansea that it didn’t fall to Sigurdsson.
 
64 min Sigurdsson finds Routledge, and his shot hits Koscielny and goes 
behind. Corner.
 
61 min I think that second goal has now officially gone down as a Jack Cork 
own goal. But now Swansea must rouse themselves in the final 30 minutes. Do 
they have it in them?
 
59 min Giroud departs, finally, and Oxlade-Chamberlain is on.
 
57 min It was Jack Cork, actually, who got the telling deflection. Does that 
go down as an own goal? In the meantime, Leroy Fer is on for the ineffectual 
Nathan Dyer.
 
55 min Swansea just couldn’t clear it. The ball came back in, Iwobi found half 
a yard of space in the box, but his shot took a massive deflection off Mawson, 
was it, and it looped up and over Fabianski, who had no chance. A slice of ill 
fortune for Swansea, butArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
had applied so much pressure that the goal looked inevitable. It’s a long way 
back for Swansea now.

A huge deflection on Iwobi’s shot, and Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> make it two!
 
53 min Excellent save from Fabianksi to deny Ramsey. It was a super pass from 
Alexis, and Ramsey’s first touch was immaculate, but Fabianksi stayed big to 
block the shot with his legs. Swansea are under the cosh here.
 
51 min Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have stepped it 
up since the break, and twice Alexis shoots when he should have passed. Both 
efforts were blocked, but that was greedy from the Chilean.
 
48 min Oxlade-Chamberlain is still warming up. We’ll keep an eye on Giroud. 
Meanwhile, here’s Luke Forrester: “That challenge on Monreal was Naught On, 
there was simply no need Fer that. Simply a Dyer challenge. I bet poor old 
Nacho had Nordfeldt a tackle like that since his day in the under-21s. Still, 
Paul Clement probably appreciates a bit of bite from his squad – you could 
almost hear him under his breath: ‘Go on Mawson!’

“If Swansea want to win this then that grit in midfield will be Ki. Snatch a 
goal and last the 90 minutes? There’ll be champagne Corks popping later 
tonight!”

Very good. Very good!
 
47 min Good defending from the excellent Mustafi, shepherding the ball out for 
a goal kick under pressure from Llorente. Why on earth did Everton let him go?
 
46 min Giroud is back on, through gritted teeth. He looked as though he was 
ready to come off at the end of that first half. We shall see how long he lasts.
 
Charles Antaki writes: “Llorente 0, Giroud 1. Actually, I’m not entirely sure 
Llorente is on the pitch – has the Swansea sea air got to him already and sent 
him back on his travels?”

Yep – he’s been disappointing.


By the way, you can keep in touch with more scores here:

Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> haven’t played well, 
but they lead: Giroud was the man of the moment, and swept home as Swansea 
stood and watched. Not a great game, but the visitors are now in control. See 
you shortly for the second half.
 
44 min Swansea have a man over, but Dyer chooses the wrong option, and shoots 
when he should have passed. It’s a mile over the bar. But Swansea have found a 
bit of zip since the goal.
 
43 min Swansea on the attack, and Ki goes down in the box. Is that a penalty? 
No, it’s a booking for Ki for diving! Koscielny stuck out a lazy leg, but Ki 
was definitely looking for it, and went down very easily. Koscielny didn’t get 
the ball, but it seemed as though Ki was on his way down before the contact 
came. Big call from Mike Jones, but I like it: I think it’s the right decision.
