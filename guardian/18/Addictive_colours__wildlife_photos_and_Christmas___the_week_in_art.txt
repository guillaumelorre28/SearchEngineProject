 The House of Cards by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin. Photograph: National 
Gallery 
A boy playing cards is observed with cool, subtly coloured precision. The 
painting’s fascination with the simple details of physical existence is typical 
of Chardin’s profound art of the material world.

 Leo Villareal’s design for Illuminated River. Photograph: Leo 
Villareal/Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands 
New York artist Leo Villareal has been announced as the winner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/07/new-york-artist-green-light-to-illuminate-london-bridges-leo-villareal>
 of a design competition for London’s £20m Illuminated River project, which 
will see the bridges of the Thames lit up at night. His design involves a 
“rhythm of light”, reacting to the movement of pedestrians and the tides, in a 
colour scheme of blues, purples, whites and golds. The final £10m now needs to 
be raised for the project.
