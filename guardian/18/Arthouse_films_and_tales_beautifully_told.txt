Catherine Shoard (Sex, suicide, torture: is arthouse really so sophisticated? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/04/sex-suicide-torture-arthouse-films-movies-fireworks>
, 5 January) takes a very select view of arthouse films amid her confusing 
lambasting of fireworks. Chichester Cinema at New Park has recently programmed
Embrace of the Serpent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/12/embrace-of-the-serpent-observer-review>
, a Mark Kermode 2016 favourite from Colombia,Paths of the Soul 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4957446/>, a Tibetan masterpiece and Bridge, an 
Indian film, a first for its child psychiatrist director, and another tale 
beautifully told. Sure, there is a would-be suicide in the latter but, in 
common with all good films that may contain the vexed subjects Catherine 
decides to take on, it’s how it’s done. And, no, fireworks are not boring as 
she states. Reach for your inner childlike wonderment, Catherine – and avoid 
combining two highly disparate subjects.
