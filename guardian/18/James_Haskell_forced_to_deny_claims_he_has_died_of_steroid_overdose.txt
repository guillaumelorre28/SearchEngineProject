Other claims to have emerged stated that Haskell had been selling drugs and 
had quit the sport, but the Wasps back row posted a video on YouTube in which 
he described the fake stories as “click-bait”.

“You may have seen there are quite a lot of fake news stories operating on 
Facebook, that I have died of a steroid overdose, which is not true, that I 
have died of a drug overdose, which is not true, and that my career is over 
because I have been trying to sell drugs,” he said.

“Another rumour is circulating that I had to quit rugby and left everyone in 
my family and moved away. Just to make it clear, this is absolute rubbish. It 
is all click-bait. Rest assured, I’m not dead and not disgraced and for those 
of you who are sceptical, we get drugs-tested all the time.

“I’m not dead and for those of you who wish I was dead, better luck next time.”

Haskell is currently recovering from a foot injury that required surgery after 
England’s triumphant tour of Australia in June, but is expected to return for 
Wasps this month.

The 31-year-old has seen his international career rejuvenated by the arrival 
of Eddie Jones, producing the best rugby of his 70 caps to establish himself as 
first-choice openside flanker.
