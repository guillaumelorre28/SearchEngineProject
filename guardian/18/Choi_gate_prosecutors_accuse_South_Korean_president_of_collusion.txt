“The president played a collusive role in a considerable portion of the 
criminal activities involving the [three] people,” said Lee Young-Ryeol, who is 
leading a probe into the scandal.


Park’s ally Choi Soon-sil and one of the president’s former aides were 
arrested earlier this month on charges of fraud, coercion and abuse of power. 
Another presidential aide was arrested for leaking confidential state documents.

Choi, 60, has been accused of using her personal ties with Park to meddle in 
state affairs and coerce local firms to “donate” tens of millions of dollars to 
non-profit foundations she then used for personal gain.

Park faces allegations that she helped Choi extract money from the firms and 
ordered her aides to leak state documents to Choi, who has no official title or 
security clearance.

Under South Korea’s constitution, the incumbent president cannot be charged 
with a criminal offence except insurrection or treason but she can still be 
probed by prosecutors and potentially charged after leaving office.

Lee acknowledged that prosecutors could not formally charge Park for now but 
vowed to continue to investigate her.

Park earlier promised to answer prosecutors’ questions – making her the first 
South Korean president to be quizzed by prosecutors while in office.


More than 50 local firms including Samsung and Hyundai were forced to donate a 
total of $65.5m to the two foundations controlled by Choi.

Many made the donations due to fear of political reprisals, such as harsh tax 
audits or difficulties getting regulatory approvals for their businesses, Lee 
said.

Choi also pressured major firms including the country’s largest carmaker 
Hyundai and the top steelmaker Posco to award lucrative contracts to firms 
linked to Choi, he added.

One of the aides leaked 180 confidential documents to Choi, which included 
papers on foreign policy and nominations of top officials and cabinet members, 
according to prosecutors.

Choi is known to have wielded huge influence on the country’s sports sector, 
including the nomination of officials and even preparations for the 2018 Winter 
Olympics.

Kim Chong, who served as vice sports minister for three years until last 
month, has also accused of helping Choi’s foundations win lucrative state 
contracts.

Prosecutors are investigating whether Kim played a role in a recent decision 
by his ministry to provide a cash subsidy to a winter sports foundation run by 
Choi’s niece, who is widely seen as her key aide.

The scandal has sent Park’s public approval rating plunging to five per cent – 
the lowest for any sitting South Korean president.

Choi is a daughter of a religious figure who was a longtime mentor to Park 
until his death in 1994. He is known to have befriended Park after the 
assassination of her first lady mother in 1974.
