Lionel Messi left the field in something close to disgust. Real didn’t really 
create much after going behind, but they’re a threat from set pieces, and they 
got it right when it mattered. Disappointment forBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, and Neymar should have 
wrapped it up with 20 minutes to go, but one good piece of news was Andres 
Iniesta’s return from injury: they looked a much better team when he came on in 
the second half.

Honours even at Camp Nou, and Real stay six points clear. Barcelona aren’t out 
of it, though. Thanks for reading. See you soon.

A breathless finish, and some late drama in a game that didn’t have much. 
Barcelona looked to have done enough after Luis Suarez gave them the lead early 
in the second half, but Real won a free kick in the 90th minute, Modric crossed 
accurately, and Sergio Ramos headed home unmarked. Real maintain their unbeaten 
start to the season, and they probably deserve a point, on balance, butBarcelona
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> will be kicking themselves: 
after taking the lead they should have wrapped the game up. Neymar’s miss 
turned out to be big.

sloppy on the goal: Ramos is such a danger, and the home team just let him go!

90 min What a finish to this match. Very similar to Barcelona’s goal: Modric 
crossed from the left, Barcelona’s marking was slack, and Ramos powered a 
header past Ter Stegen from seven yards! Camp Nou is stunned.

88 min Oh, Ronaldo! Marcelo did really well on the left, and Ronaldo couldn’t 
find the header from a narrow angle! He mistimed his jump. A let-off for Real. 
Mascherano is booked for his latest indiscretion.

87 min Better cross from Carvajal, and Ramos heads over! It was a difficult 
chance: no blame attached to the Spain star. Denis Suarez replaces Neymar in 
Barça’s final change.

Final sub for Real: Mariano on for Kovacic.

81 min Messi shoots wide! A beautiful pass from Iniesta to take two Real 
defenders out, but Messi gets his angles wrong! Not quite as good a chance as 
Neymar’s earlier, but he had a clear look at goal.

75 min Varane flicks on a Modric corner, but no other Real player can reach 
it. Interesting sub from Real: Benzema exits, and Marco Asensio comes on. And 
Andre Gomes is replaced by Arda Turan.

70 min Zidane looked anxious on the bench. Real have lost some of their rhythm 
since the ball, and Iniesta has been heavily involved since his introduction.

68 min Neymar! What a chance to make it two. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> counter-attacked, and Iniesta 
fed Neymar on the left side. The Brazilian danced around Carvajal, cut inside, 
and fired it over the bar from about 10 yards! That could have wrapped it up.

66 min Isco kicks the bench in frustration as he’s hauled off for Casemiro. 
Expect to see Modric and Kovacic further forward from now.

62 min Hm. Another replay of the goal suggests Suarez might just have been 
offside. It was very, very tight. Regardless: Real have work to do.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> could maybe do with a new

58 min Benzema is nearly in at the other end, but he can’t quite sort his feet 
out. This is more like it: much more space now for the attacking players to 
shine.

55 min There was a slight suspicion of offside against Suarez, but I think he 
was just level when Neymar delivered the ball. What a great cross, too: very 
difficult for Real to defend. Maybe Navas could have come for it, but who can 
say, really. Suarez has a knack from close range, doesn’t he?!

. Neymar whipped a fine cross into the box, Suarez got free, and pushed a 
header past Navas. It might have taken a deflection off Varane. What a poacher 
Suarez is. Real have been the better side, probably, but they find themselves 
behind.

50 min Real are happy to fall back into their defensive shape when Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have the ball. Pique and 
Mascherano have pushed up to the halfway line but Real look solid. Ronaldo gets 
free in the box but slams it over the bar from a tight angle.

47 min Vigorous start from Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, and Messi feeds Suarez in the 
box. Carvajal comes across, and concedes the corner, but Barça can’t make it 
count. Andres Iniesta is off the bench to warm up, and Camp Nou shows its 
appreciation.

completed 36 of 37 passes in the first half. He was excellent.

No stoppage time, and the first half draws to a close. It’s been reasonably 
entertaining, but it’s been short on attacking quality: there’s just been so 
little space for Messi, Ronaldo and co to work in. Javier Mascherano was 
fortunate not to concede a penalty on Lucas Vazquez, but other than that 
there’s little to report: Real are happy to cut off the space in midfield, and
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> haven’t really 
tested Keylor Navas. Defences on top – let’s hope it opens up in the second 
half.

44 min Ooh, Pique diverts it just past the post! Benzema drove into the box, 
fired it across, and Pique did just enough to cut out the danger. Almost an own 
goal, though. Then Varane heads straight at Ter Stegen!

pockets of play, but defences firmly on top at the moment.

40 min Appeals for a handball in the box on Dani Carvajal, and Camp Nou 
erupts, but again, Carlos Clos Gomez shakes his head. It did hit him on the 
arm, but it came at him from such a short distance.

38 min Real are getting closer. Lucas Vazquez does well again, and feeds 
Ronaldo, who skips into the area and pokes one at goal, but he can’t quite test 
Ter Stegen. The visitors are looking ever more accomplished, though.

34 min It’s not quite happening for Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. They’ve posed a sporadic 
threat, but Real have shut down their attacking options effectively.

Here’s Rhys Vaughan Williams: “As an avowed pedant, I have to point that 
although Seville and Granada are both Andalusian (14:51), they are around 150 
miles apart: in other words, ‘neighbours’ in the same way, say, London and 
Sheffield are.”

32 min Marcelo fires wide after a moment of panic in the Barça defence. 
Benzema and Ronaldo rather got in each other’s way. Just two shots on target in 
this opening half-hour, but 10 fouls.

the ex-Fluminense man fouls Sergi Roberto. It’s been that type of game.

 from the Camp Nou.

Real Madrid and Sergio Ramos steal point at the last from Barcelona
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/03/barcelona-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report> 
Lionel Messi left the field in something close to disgust. Real didn’t really 
create much after going behind, but they’re a threat from set pieces, and they 
got it right when it mattered. Disappointment forBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, and Neymar should have 
wrapped it up with 20 minutes to go, but one good piece of news was Andres 
Iniesta’s return from injury: they looked a much better team when he came on in 
the second half.

Honours even at Camp Nou, and Real stay six points clear. Barcelona aren’t out 
of it, though. Thanks for reading. See you soon.

A breathless finish, and some late drama in a game that didn’t have much. 
Barcelona looked to have done enough after Luis Suarez gave them the lead early 
in the second half, but Real won a free kick in the 90th minute, Modric crossed 
accurately, and Sergio Ramos headed home unmarked. Real maintain their unbeaten 
start to the season, and they probably deserve a point, on balance, butBarcelona
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> will be kicking themselves: 
after taking the lead they should have wrapped the game up. Neymar’s miss 
turned out to be big.
 
And that’s the whistle! Real snatch a point at the death!
 
90 min +2 Last effort from Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, and it’s headed off the line 
by Varane! Panic stations in the Real defence, but they do enough to hustle it 
clear.
 
90 min +1 Three minutes of stoppage time. Barcelona’s marking was really 
sloppy on the goal: Ramos is such a danger, and the home team just let him go!
 
90 min What a finish to this match. Very similar to Barcelona’s goal: Modric 
crossed from the left, Barcelona’s marking was slack, and Ramos powered a 
header past Ter Stegen from seven yards! Camp Nou is stunned.

the Real Madrid players celebrate Sergio Ramos’ equaliser. He’ll probably get 
in trouble for that. Photograph: Vladimir Rys Photography/Getty Images  
Ramos draws Real level at the death! Amazing!
 
88 min Oh, Ronaldo! Marcelo did really well on the left, and Ronaldo couldn’t 
find the header from a narrow angle! He mistimed his jump. A let-off for Real. 
Mascherano is booked for his latest indiscretion.
 
87 min Better cross from Carvajal, and Ramos heads over! It was a difficult 
chance: no blame attached to the Spain star. Denis Suarez replaces Neymar in 
Barça’s final change.
 
86 min Poor cross from Carvajal when well placed. It’s not happening for Real. 
Final sub for Real: Mariano on for Kovacic.
 
85 min Iniesta’s been seriously influential since coming on. He’s so calm in 
possession. What a player.
 
84 min Modric lifts it in, but Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> defend stoutly, and it’s out 
for a goal kick.
 
83 min Well played Marco Asensio, and he draws the foul from Busquets, who is 
booked. Chance here from the free kick.
 
81 min Messi shoots wide! A beautiful pass from Iniesta to take two Real 
defenders out, but Messi gets his angles wrong! Not quite as good a chance as 
Neymar’s earlier, but he had a clear look at goal.
 
80 min Defeat here would be Real’s first of the season. They’ve got 10 minutes 
to preserve their unbeaten record, butBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have had the better of it 
since the goal.
 
79 min Carvajal is yellow-carded for whacking Neymar. It was deserved.
 
77 min Time running out for Real. They haven’t really created a clear chance, 
despite plenty of good play.
 
75 min Varane flicks on a Modric corner, but no other Real player can reach 
it. Interesting sub from Real: Benzema exits, and Marco Asensio comes on. And 
Andre Gomes is replaced by Arda Turan.
 
74 min Headed clear by Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Real recycle it, but it’s 
hacked away, and Suarez fouls Varane as Barça look to break. Suarez is booked 
for his protest.
 
73 min Good counter-attack from Real, and they win a corner. Real have the 
height advantage with Sergio Ramos, Ronaldo and Varane.
 
71 min Neymar goes through the inside-right channel this time, but Varane is 
quickly across to cover the danger.
 
70 min Zidane looked anxious on the bench. Real have lost some of their rhythm 
since the ball, and Iniesta has been heavily involved since his introduction.
 
68 min Neymar! What a chance to make it two. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> counter-attacked, and Iniesta 
fed Neymar on the left side. The Brazilian danced around Carvajal, cut inside, 
and fired it over the bar from about 10 yards! That could have wrapped it up.
 
66 min Isco kicks the bench in frustration as he’s hauled off for Casemiro. 
Expect to see Modric and Kovacic further forward from now.
 
64 min The goal has changed the whole tenor of the match. Real were playing 
really well, and then, out of nowhere, really, they were behind.Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> starting to dominate.

Today’s attendance: 98,485. Remarkable.
 
62 min Hm. Another replay of the goal suggests Suarez might just have been 
offside. It was very, very tight. Regardless: Real have work to do.
 
61 min Barcelona have established a degree of control in midfield. Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> could maybe do with a new 
face. James for Isco, perhaps?
 
59 min Huge applause from the home fans as Andres Iniesta replaces Ivan 
Rakitic. The little genius is back!
 
58 min Benzema is nearly in at the other end, but he can’t quite sort his feet 
out. This is more like it: much more space now for the attacking players to 
shine.
 
55 min There was a slight suspicion of offside against Suarez, but I think he 
was just level when Neymar delivered the ball. What a great cross, too: very 
difficult for Real to defend. Maybe Navas could have come for it, but who can 
say, really. Suarez has a knack from close range, doesn’t he?!
 
54 min Clinical from Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>
. Neymar whipped a fine cross into the box, Suarez got free, and pushed a 
header past Navas. It might have taken a deflection off Varane. What a poacher 
Suarez is. Real have been the better side, probably, but they find themselves 
behind.
 
And Suarez heads home from six yards! Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> lead!

52 min Free kick for Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>
 in a good position on the left. Neymar and Messi stand over it.
 
50 min Real are happy to fall back into their defensive shape when Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have the ball. Pique and 
Mascherano have pushed up to the halfway line but Real look solid. Ronaldo gets 
free in the box but slams it over the bar from a tight angle.
 
47 min Vigorous start from Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, and Messi feeds Suarez in the 
box. Carvajal comes across, and concedes the corner, but Barça can’t make it 
count. Andres Iniesta is off the bench to warm up, and Camp Nou shows its 
appreciation.
 
46 min We’re back. No changes from either side. Luka Modric, incidentally, 
completed 36 of 37 passes in the first half. He was excellent.
 
No stoppage time, and the first half draws to a close. It’s been reasonably 
entertaining, but it’s been short on attacking quality: there’s just been so 
little space for Messi, Ronaldo and co to work in. Javier Mascherano was 
fortunate not to concede a penalty on Lucas Vazquez, but other than that 
there’s little to report: Real are happy to cut off the space in midfield, and
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> haven’t really 
tested Keylor Navas. Defences on top – let’s hope it opens up in the second 
half.
 
That’s the whistle.

44 min Ooh, Pique diverts it just past the post! Benzema drove into the box, 
fired it across, and Pique did just enough to cut out the danger. Almost an own 
goal, though. Then Varane heads straight at Ter Stegen!
 
43 min Suarez goes through the middle, but Sergio Ramos is across to cover.

Here’s Charles Antaki: “It’s stating the obvious but Andre Gomes is a very 
pale imitation of Andres Iniesta – in fact so pale as to be invisible.”
 
42 min There’s just been a shortage of space in this first half. Some nice 
pockets of play, but defences firmly on top at the moment.
 
40 min Appeals for a handball in the box on Dani Carvajal, and Camp Nou 
erupts, but again, Carlos Clos Gomez shakes his head. It did hit him on the 
arm, but it came at him from such a short distance.
 
38 min Real are getting closer. Lucas Vazquez does well again, and feeds 
Ronaldo, who skips into the area and pokes one at goal, but he can’t quite test 
Ter Stegen. The visitors are looking ever more accomplished, though.

36 min Ronaldo attacks Pique on the left side of the box, and the Real man 
smacks one at goal with his left foot. Ter Stegen deals with it, just about. 
Corner to Real, but it’s cleared.
 
34 min It’s not quite happening for Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. They’ve posed a sporadic 
threat, but Real have shut down their attacking options effectively.

Here’s Rhys Vaughan Williams: “As an avowed pedant, I have to point that 
although Seville and Granada are both Andalusian (14:51), they are around 150 
miles apart: in other words, ‘neighbours’ in the same way, say, London and 
Sheffield are.”
 
32 min Marcelo fires wide after a moment of panic in the Barça defence. 
Benzema and Ronaldo rather got in each other’s way. Just two shots on target in 
this opening half-hour, but 10 fouls.
 
30 min Marcelo finds space on the left side, but his cross is poor, and then 
the ex-Fluminense man fouls Sergi Roberto. It’s been that type of game.
 
28 min Well, it looks as though Carlos Clos Gomez has run out of patience, and 
Neymar is cautioned for a clip on Lucas Vazquez. He’ll miss Barcelona’s next 
game.
 
27 min Mascherano gives Ronaldo a hefty whack from behind. He’s penalised for 
the foul, but no booking. It’s spicy!
