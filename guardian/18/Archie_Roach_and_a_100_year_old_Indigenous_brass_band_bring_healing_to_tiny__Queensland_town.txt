Yarrabah, an Indigenous community about an hour’s drive south of Cairns 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/cairns>, is sometimes referred to 
as “paradise by the sea”. Although only just over 50km from far north 
Queensland’s tourist capital, it’s isolated, separated from the city by Trinity 
Inlet on one side and, on the other, by dense tropical rainforest that covers 
the rugged Murray Prior range. The town was not connected to electricity until 
the 1960s.

Before that, Yarrabah was an Anglican mission, established in 1893. Over the 
ensuing decades, Indigenous peoples from across far northQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> and South Sea Islanders 
were forcibly relocated here to live alongside the local Gunggandji people. 
Families were torn apart. The town’s mayor, Ross Andrews, estimates that about 
80% of the community is comprised of the stolen generations and their 
descendants.

It’s no surprise, then, that Yarrabah continues to struggle with the knock-on 
effects of profound intergenerational trauma. But in recent years there has 
been something of a sea change in the outlook here, brought about by a revival 
of a relic of the town’s colonial and missionary past – the Yarrabah Brass 
Band, which was originally established in 1901 to accompany church hymns.

After the mission’s closure at the turn of the 1960s – by which time Elvis, 
the Beatles and the Stones had gained as much of a foothold here as anywhere 
else in the world – the brass bands withered. In 2012 a local, Greg Fourmile, 
revived the concept with the support of the jazz musician James Morrison, then 
the artistic director of the Queensland music festival, who pioneered the 
Yarrabah band festival in 2013.

Fourmile says that even though the bands, along with Christianity, were 
imposed upon his people they became a source of pleasure and nostalgia: many 
townsfolk have fond memories of their uncles and grandfathers performing. The 
revival is a way of paying tribute: “A lot of the members had family in prior 
brass bands leading up to today, so for them it’s like carrying that torch.”

Now, though, the brass has been augmented by woodwind instruments, and even 
guitars and drums in a nod to the power of rock’n’roll. “It’s a stage band,” 
Fourmile says. “It’s come full circle now, so you’re chucking in your guitars 
and everything else, making it more inclusive.”

Yarrabah band festival was created and is run by Queensland music festival. 
This year, the singer Katie Noonan was appointed as the state festival’s 
artistic director, and the 2016 event was the biggest yet staged, headlined by 
Archie Roach and 21-year-old Jessica Cerro, better known as Montaigne. On 
Saturday there were close to 3,000 people here and, while the majority were 
locals, there were whitefellas, too; visitors from Cairns, Innisfail, the 
Atherton Tablelands and beyond.

It’s a reflection of the community’s desire to present a new, more open face 
to the world. In the 70s and 80s, a permit was required to visit here. Andrews 
says the festival brings energy to the community, and the music is a source of 
healing: “There’s been trauma here for many, many years, and the music and 
performing arts that the festival provides is a kind of a therapy.”

This is Roach’s story, too. Introducing Took the Children Away, he stops to 
address the crowd.

“People ask me if I get sick of singing this song,” he says. “And I say, no, 
because every time I sing this song, I let a little bit of that pain go. And 
one day all that pain will be gone, and I’ll be free.”

Roach’s voice has a guttural edge these days but he still reaches for 
spiritual highs; when he reaches the chorus of the song that made him famous, 
voices in the crowd shriek and cry out.

More upbeat are the Bay Boyz, a local R&B trio chosen by Noonan to support the 
headliners after a Battle of the Bands the night before. It featured 20 acts 
(“I’ve never seen a mic stand so low,” says Noonan, marvelling at the 
performance of a four-year-old girl). The Boyz are serious – they even have a 
manager, Zane, who pushes a card into my hand and speaks of bigger things.

They also have the pipes, the moves, and are beside themselves with excitement 
at this first career break: Michael “Mikey Boi” Yeatman says this is only their 
second performance. The Bay Boyz exemplify a town that is turning its gaze 
outwards – their music is inspired by all the big names of their chosen genre – 
but as brothers Benjamin (BJ) and Thaddeus (TJ) Johnson add, country music is 
what they grew up on.

Later a group of nervous schoolchildren, on stage for the first time, perform 
a song by the local rap artist Dizzy Doolan. The words are trenchant and speak 
of ongoing problems in the community. Doolan says the kids could have chosen 
any song but chose this one:

Stop the violence, make a change
Stop the violence, be on your game
Stop the fighting, stop the drugs
Put your hands up, show me some love

The song was workshopped by Doolan as part of the community’s 
artist-in-residence program, and led by traditional owner and songwriter 
Elverina Johnson (who is also the mother of BJ and TJ) alongside the Briscoe 
sisters, Deline and Merindi. The workshops, Johnson says, “aim to inspire the 
kids to tell their own story about where they come from and who they are”.

The results are giving Yarrabah a sense of pride. Earlier in the evening the 
night’s MC, David Hudson, opened proceedings with a cover of Paul Kelly’s 
Special Treatment. The song’s final verse sings of the far-reaching 
consequences of cultural dislocation and disempowerment:

I never spoke my mother’s tongue
I never knew my name
I never learnt the songs she sung
I was raised in shame

Deline Briscoe says that culture of shame is slowly being broken down. “Our 
parents were looked down upon and told to be ashamed of things, especially 
anything to do with culture, and then it just kept getting passed along,” she 
says. “So seeing these kids get up and dance and do songs in their language, 
and being proud of that, is really groundbreaking.


“You hear it less these days. When I was growing up, ‘shame’ became more like 
a swearword – we weren’t allowed to use that word in any context, even if we 
were joking. Now, everyone is just building each other up.”
