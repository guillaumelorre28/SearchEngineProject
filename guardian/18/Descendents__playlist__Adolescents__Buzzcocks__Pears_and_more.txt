Adolescents – Kids of the Black Hole 

My wife once told me that before she met me she had seen the Adolescents 
performing at this club. I knew they hadn’t played there, and it turns out she 
had seen the Descendents instead. I love these guys, even if my wife confuses 
them with my band.

Buzzcocks – Love You More

Wait … you mean punk bands can be romantic? The Buzzcocks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/05/buzzcocks-review-ritz-manchester>
 – progenitors of pop-punk, or maybe it’s more like second-generation powerpop. 
Whatever. Singles Going Steady was the soundtrack of my teen years, and 
definitely made it OK to write punk songs about girls.

999 – Homicide 

When this came out, it had just enough traditional rock feel to appeal to a 
“new waver” transitioning into punk rock (ie me). Great guitar fills, great 
production.

Pears – Victim to Be 

I can’t wait to see these guys! Quirky melodic hardcore from Louisiana, they 
remind me of My Name crossed with A Wilhelm Scream.

Black Flag – American Waste 

The whole Six Pack 7inch is genius, and why they didn’t also put Police Story 
on there is a mystery to me. But I’m choosing this one for the lyrics, which 
always blow me away, especially with Dez spitting them out. Dez is god.
