“I’ve inherited a talented squad and I’ll be doing everything I can to get the 
club back into the Championship as soon as possible.

firmly believe we can start moving up the table and enjoy a successful season.”

 after picking up just four wins from 15 matches this season. The 36-year-old, 
widely credited with nurturing Dele Alli and Brendan Galloway, was an 
“outstanding candidate” for the job, according to Charlton’s chief executive, 
Katrien Meire. Robinson will assume full control of the club from Monday.

“Following a thorough appointment process, Karl emerged as the outstanding 
candidate,” Meire said in a statement posted on the club’s website on Thursday. 
“He is a very talented, forward-thinking manager and I’m delighted we have been 
able to bring him to Charlton.

“Our main focus is bringing Championship football back to the Valley at the 
earliest opportunity. Karl has vast experience ofLeague One

promotion just two seasons ago, we believe he has the necessary credentials and 
is best equipped to lead the club forward.”
