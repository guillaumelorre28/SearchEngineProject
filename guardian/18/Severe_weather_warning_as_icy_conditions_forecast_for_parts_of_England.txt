The Met Office warning, in place until 10am on Thursday, highlights the 
dangers of untreated surfaces such as pavements, cycle paths and some minor 
roads.

It is in place for Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/yorkshire> 
and Humber, the east Midlands and the east of England.

Charles Powell from the Met Office said: “Temperatures will be getting lowish, 
with some dropping below freezing.

“The icy conditions are likely to be seen in the east where some showers are 
expected. But the cloud means temperatures will not be desperately low.”

He added that temperatures would be lower further inland, with parts of the 
Midlands looking at lows of minus 6C.
