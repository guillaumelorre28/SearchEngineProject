Five writs were lodged on March 4 in the West Australian supreme court – four 
days before the second anniversary of the plane’s mysterious disappearance and 
just before the statute of limitations was reached.

Weeks’s wife Danica, sister Sara, brother Peter and mother Prudence Tomblin 
are each claiming compensation for “personal injury, loss and damage” suffered 
as a result of “sudden shock” and “mental harm” after his death, the Sunday 
Times newspaper reports.

Danica also launched a separate legal bid on behalf of their two children – 
five-year-old Lincoln and two-year-old Jack – covering lost earnings, financial 
loss, funeral costs and damages for the loss of his luggage.

The family is also claiming for 6% interest on damages per year and 
reimbursement of their legal costs.

The Boeing 777 aircraft vanished shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur 
bound for Beijing on March 8, 2014 with 239 people onboard.
