 * Two justices suggested that tonight’s parliamentary motion, which asks MPs 
to “respect the wishes of the United Kingdom” may preclude the need for 
legislation.They hypothesised that it may seem strange to odd-lawyers if the 
will of parliament was expressed by a motion but legislation was still needed. 
 * Earlier, David Pannick QC said the motion was insufficient to give the 
government authority to trigger article 50t He said it could not alone give 
authority and could not override legislation. 
 * Withdrawing from the EU without the consent of the Northern Ireland people 
would be unconstitutional, the court heard. Ronan Lavery QC said there had been 
a transfer of sovereignty away from the UK parliament to the people of Northern 
Ireland under the devolution settlement. 
 * The Scottish government is not claiming a veto over the UK leaving the EU, 
the lord advocate for the Scottish government said. But James Wolfe QC insisted 
that its consent still matters because of the effects of withdrawal on its 
citizens. 
 * A man has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated malicious 
communications over threats made online to Gina Miller, who Pannick is 
representing.

 * The EU Referendum Act 2015 was of political, but not legal significance, 
the court heard. Pannick said it merely said there would be a referendum and 
made no comment on the division of power between parliament and the executive. 
 *  Pannick faced tough questioning on the legal effect of the 2015 act with 
the court’s president, Lord Neuberger, who suggested it may have been 
sufficient for the government to say it has ceded power to the people. “It 
would be a bit surprising if the referendum act and the referendum had no 
effect in law,” said Neuberger.

 * Sections of primary legislation would make no sense if the UK left the EU 
and so parliament could not have intended to allow a secretary of state power 
to withdraw from the union,Pannick said.Parliamentary authorisation is needed 
to render statutes invalid, he said. 
 * The government’s case is based on “a fundamental misunderstanding of the 
doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty”,Dominic Chambers QC, representing Deir 
Tozetti Dos Santos, claimed. He said the appellant seeks to say there is a 
prerogative and restrictions must be placed on it, whereas the correct approach 
is to acknowledge that it is for parliament to cede powers that the executive 
can use the prerogative to nullify rights in domestic law. Facebook

They have been discussing the the Sewel convention 
<http://www.gov.scot/About/Government/Sewel/KeyFacts>, a rule introduced at the 
time of Scottish and Welsh devolution in 1999, which says both devolved 
parliaments “normally” have to approve any act of Westminster that affects 
their powers.

James Wolffe QC struggled to pin down the precise meaning of the word 
“normally’ when pressed.

The presence of so many senior law officers from different parts of the UK 
show that there is little constitutional consensus on key elements if the 
relationships between London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.

Wolfe says there is plenty of evidence including statements by the UK 
government as to the importance of the Sewll convention.

Lord Mance says conventions are important but not legally binding. 

The UK government decided to enshrine it into law because of its importance, 
answers Wolfe.

The court adjourns until 10.15 tomorrow. I will post a summary shortly.

At a constitutional level leaving the EU would limit the competence of the 
Scottish parliament and the competence of the Scottish government, Wolfe argues.

Now it’s James Wolfe QC, the lord advocate for the Scottish government. 

He says when the UK was founded in 1707 it conferred the powers to change laws 
in Scotland to the crown rather than parliament.

English law like Scottish law precludes the government from changing the law 
of the land through use of the prerogative, says Wolfe.

He makes clear he is not asserting that the Scottish government has a veto on 
whether the UK leaves the EU but its consent for effects on its citizens must 
be sought and is of constitutional significance.

Lavery says:

To the extent that the UK no longer has a written constitution we say that the 
Good Friday agreement forms part of the Northern Ireland constitution...

It would be very disturbing for the people of Northern Ireland to find that 
the terms agreed in the Northern Ireland agreement were not binding, had no 
constitutional basis.

The triggering of article 50 would impede the principle of self-determination.

Lavery sits down.

Staying on Northern Ireland, it is the turn of Ronan Lavery QC. 

It would be unconstitutional to withdraw from the EU without the consent of 
the people of the Northern Ireland.

EU law is part of devolution settlement and there has been a transfer of 
sovereignty so that the people of Northern Ireland now have primacy, and not 
the UK parliament, over constitutional change, says Lavery.

Scoffield says even if breaking faith with some of the north-south agreements 
is a domestic matter, that is something that must be done by a legislative 
consent motion, not just an act of parliament.

If legislative consent is sought, it may be granted ..what we are asking the 
court to clarify is whether and how the convention is engaged.

With that, Scoffield sits down.

Harking back to the English civil war, David Scoffield QC suggests that the UK 
government’s “contention of its powers are, with respect, cavalier - perhaps in 
this respect with both a large ‘C’ and a small ‘c’.

Scoffield says the government seeks to use the dualist doctrine (whereby 
parliament and government are required to act to protect the government against 
parliament, whereas it exists to protect parliament and government.

Removal of EU law obligations materially alters a carefully-constructed 
devolution settlement

EU alters the devolution settlement in two ways, says Scoffield. The removal 
of EU law would allow the government to do things it has been precluded from 
doing by EU law.

The “hollowing out” of EU law would also remove some devolved powers and so 
could not be done by prerogative, Scoffield contends.

Scoffield accuses the government of being “cavalier” with its attempt to use 
the royal prerogative, given the effects he says it would have on the 
devolution settlement.

He refers to the Northern Ireland Act giving effect to the Belfast agreement, 
which involves co-operation with the Republic of Ireland.


Continued membership of the EU is an integral part of the act.

He says the government would be “driving a wedge” between Northern Ireland and 
the Republic of Ireland by triggering article 50.

They are discussing whether a resolution - or motion (like the one tonight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/may-says-she-will-reveal-brexit-plan-before-triggering-article-50>
) - would be sufficient to give the government the authority to trigger article 
50.

Chambers says it would not be but the justices appear unconvinced. 

Lord Carnwath suggests it would be strange if parliament expressed its will 
through a resolution but then there was still a need to go back to parliament 
for legislation to implement it.

Chambers suggests it might be “odd... to the man on the Clapham omnibus” but 
not to lawyers.
Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) 
Two Justices (devils advocate perhaps) just suggested people would see it as 
"odd" if motions welcoming A50 weren't taken into account

Chambers is referring to a House of Lords briefing paper, considered in the 
high court case, from 3 June 2015.

He quotes from a passage saying the referendum bill does not contain any 
requirement for the UK government to implement the result of the referendum.

By contrast the referendum on the AV voting system would have automatically 
implemented a vote in favour without further legislation, he says.

When the referendum is referred to as advisory, what that means is it is not 
legally binding, continues Chambers.

Dominic Chambers QC, representing Deir Tozetti Dos Santos, is back with the 
case against the government.

There is nothing in the 2015 [European Union Referendum] act which could 
provide parliamentary authorisation whether its viewed through the prism of the 
prerogative or parliamentary sovereignty.

 * Tonight’s parliamentary motion, which asks MPs to “respect the wishes of 
the United Kingdom” by agreeing to the government’s timetable for Brexit, is 
insufficient to give the government authority to trigger article 50, David 
Pannick QC told the court. He said a motion alone does not give authority and 
cannot override legislation. 
 * A man has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated malicious 
communications over threats made online to Gina Miller, who Pannick is 
representing. 
 * The EU Referendum Act 2015 was of political, but not legal significance, 
the court heard. Pannick said it merely said there would be a referendum and 
made no comment on the division of power between parliament and the executive. 
 *  Pannick tough questioning on the legal effect of the 2015 act with the 
court’s president, Lord Neuberger, who suggested it may have been sufficient 
for the government to say it has ceded power to the people. “It would be a bit 
surprising if the referendum act and the referendum had no effect in law,” said 
Neuberger.

 * Sections of primary legislation would make no sense if the UK left the EU 
and so parliament could not have intended to allow a secretary of state power 
to withdraw from the union,Pannick said. Parliamentary authorisation is needed 
to render statutes invalid, he said. 
 * The government’s case is based on “a fundamental misunderstanding of the 
doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty”,Dominic Chambers QC, representing Deir 
Tozetti Dos Santos, claimed. He said the appellant seeks to say there is a 
prerogative and restrictions must be placed on it, whereas the correct approach 
is to acknowledge that it is for parliament to cede powers that the executive 
can use the prerogative to nullify rights in domestic law.

Dominic Chambers QC says under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, 
parliamentary authorisation is needed for the executive to nullify domestic 
rights.

He says the appellant’s approach, that the government doesn’t need 
authorisation, is “a fundamental misunderstanding of the doctrine of 
parliamentary sovereignty”.

Chambers argues the appellant is looking at the matter “the wrong way round” 
or “from the wrong end of the telescope”. He says James Eadie’s looks to see if 
there is a prerogative first and then says restrictions must be placed on it.

Chambers says this is incorrect, it is for parliament to cede the powers to 
use the prerogative to nullify rights in domestic law.

They adjourn for lunch until 2pm.

Since you’re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the 
Guardian than ever – but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues 
are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The 
Guardian’s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But 
we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices 
matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future

Chambers says if the European treaties could not have had effect in domestic 
law without the European Communities Act it must follow that they could only be 
removed by parliament and not the executive.

It is for parliament to choose whether to repeal legislation enacting a treaty 
in domestic law.

The triggering of article 50 by the government alone will bypass parliament, 
says Chambers.

The rights are domestic law rights; that principle is fundamental to the EU, 
that the rights have to be brought into domestic law, he continues.

 * Two justices suggested that tonight’s parliamentary motion, which asks MPs 
to “respect the wishes of the United Kingdom” may preclude the need for 
legislation.They hypothesised that it may seem strange to odd-lawyers if the 
will of parliament was expressed by a motion but legislation was still needed. 
 * Earlier, David Pannick QC said the motion was insufficient to give the 
government authority to trigger article 50t He said it could not alone give 
authority and could not override legislation. 
 * Withdrawing from the EU without the consent of the Northern Ireland people 
would be unconstitutional, the court heard. Ronan Lavery QC said there had been 
a transfer of sovereignty away from the UK parliament to the people of Northern 
Ireland under the devolution settlement. 
 * The Scottish government is not claiming a veto over the UK leaving the EU, 
the lord advocate for the Scottish government said. But James Wolfe QC insisted 
that its consent still matters because of the effects of withdrawal on its 
citizens. 
 * A man has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated malicious 
communications over threats made online to Gina Miller, who Pannick is 
representing.

 * The EU Referendum Act 2015 was of political, but not legal significance,

Tozetti Dos Santos, claimed. He said the appellant seeks to say there is a 
prerogative and restrictions must be placed on it, whereas the correct approach 
is to acknowledge that it is for parliament to cede powers that the executive 
can use the prerogative to nullify rights in domestic law.  
They have been discussing the the Sewel convention 
<http://www.gov.scot/About/Government/Sewel/KeyFacts>, a rule introduced at the 
time of Scottish and Welsh devolution in 1999, which says both devolved 
parliaments “normally” have to approve any act of Westminster that affects 
their powers.

James Wolffe QC struggled to pin down the precise meaning of the word 
“normally’ when pressed.

The presence of so many senior law officers from different parts of the UK 
show that there is little constitutional consensus on key elements if the 
relationships between London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.

Wolfe says there is plenty of evidence including statements by the UK 
government as to the importance of the Sewll convention.

Lord Mance says conventions are important but not legally binding. 

The UK government decided to enshrine it into law because of its importance, 
answers Wolfe.

The court adjourns until 10.15 tomorrow. I will post a summary shortly.
 
At a constitutional level leaving the EU would limit the competence of the 
Scottish parliament and the competence of the Scottish government, Wolfe argues.
 
Now it’s James Wolfe QC, the lord advocate for the Scottish government. 

He says when the UK was founded in 1707 it conferred the powers to change laws 
in Scotland to the crown rather than parliament.

English law like Scottish law precludes the government from changing the law 
of the land through use of the prerogative, says Wolfe.

He makes clear he is not asserting that the Scottish government has a veto on 
whether the UK leaves the EU but its consent for effects on its citizens must 
be sought and is of constitutional significance.

Lavery says:

To the extent that the UK no longer has a written constitution we say that the 
Good Friday agreement forms part of the Northern Ireland constitution...

It would be very disturbing for the people of Northern Ireland to find that 
the terms agreed in the Northern Ireland agreement were not binding, had no 
constitutional basis.

The triggering of article 50 would impede the principle of self-determination.

Lavery sits down.
 
Staying on Northern Ireland, it is the turn of Ronan Lavery QC. 

It would be unconstitutional to withdraw from the EU without the consent of 
the people of the Northern Ireland.

EU law is part of devolution settlement and there has been a transfer of 
sovereignty so that the people of Northern Ireland now have primacy, and not 
the UK parliament, over constitutional change, says Lavery.
 
Scoffield says even if breaking faith with some of the north-south agreements 
is a domestic matter, that is something that must be done by a legislative 
consent motion, not just an act of parliament.

If legislative consent is sought, it may be granted ..what we are asking the 
court to clarify is whether and how the convention is engaged.

With that, Scoffield sits down.
 
Harking back to the English civil war, David Scoffield QC suggests that the UK 
government’s “contention of its powers are, with respect, cavalier - perhaps in 
this respect with both a large ‘C’ and a small ‘c’.
 
Scoffield says the government seeks to use the dualist doctrine (whereby 
parliament and government are required to act to protect the government against 
parliament, whereas it exists to protect parliament and government.

Removal of EU law obligations materially alters a carefully-constructed 
devolution settlement

EU alters the devolution settlement in two ways, says Scoffield. The removal 
of EU law would allow the government to do things it has been precluded from 
doing by EU law.

The “hollowing out” of EU law would also remove some devolved powers and so 
could not be done by prerogative, Scoffield contends.

Scoffield accuses the government of being “cavalier” with its attempt to use 
the royal prerogative, given the effects he says it would have on the 
devolution settlement.

He refers to the Northern Ireland Act giving effect to the Belfast agreement, 
which involves co-operation with the Republic of Ireland.


Continued membership of the EU is an integral part of the act.

He says the government would be “driving a wedge” between Northern Ireland and 
the Republic of Ireland by triggering article 50.
 
Chambers has concluded. Next are David Scoffield QC and Ronan Lavery QC. They 
are representing two Northern Ireland applicants, Agnew andMcCord.

They are discussing whether a resolution - or motion (like the one tonight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/may-says-she-will-reveal-brexit-plan-before-triggering-article-50>
) - would be sufficient to give the government the authority to trigger article 
50.

Chambers says it would not be but the justices appear unconvinced. 

Lord Carnwath suggests it would be strange if parliament expressed its will 
through a resolution but then there was still a need to go back to parliament 
for legislation to implement it.

Chambers suggests it might be “odd... to the man on the Clapham omnibus” but 
not to lawyers.

Chambers is referring to a House of Lords briefing paper, considered in the 
high court case, from 3 June 2015.

He quotes from a passage saying the referendum bill does not contain any 
requirement for the UK government to implement the result of the referendum.

By contrast the referendum on the AV voting system would have automatically 
implemented a vote in favour without further legislation, he says.

When the referendum is referred to as advisory, what that means is it is not 
legally binding, continues Chambers.
 
Dominic Chambers QC, representing Deir Tozetti Dos Santos, is back with the 
case against the government.

There is nothing in the 2015 [European Union Referendum] act which could 
provide parliamentary authorisation whether its viewed through the prism of the 
prerogative or parliamentary sovereignty.
 
 * Tonight’s parliamentary motion, which asks MPs to “respect the wishes of 
the United Kingdom” by agreeing to the government’s timetable for Brexit, is 
insufficient to give the government authority to trigger article 50, David 
Pannick QC told the court. He said a motion alone does not give authority and 
cannot override legislation. 
 * A man has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated malicious 
communications over threats made online to Gina Miller, who Pannick is 
representing. 
 * The EU Referendum Act 2015 was of political, but not legal significance, 
the court heard. Pannick said it merely said there would be a referendum and 
made no comment on the division of power between parliament and the executive. 
 *  Pannick tough questioning on the legal effect of the 2015 act with the 
court’s president, Lord Neuberger, who suggested it may have been sufficient 
for the government to say it has ceded power to the people. “It would be a bit 
surprising if the referendum act and the referendum had no effect in law,” said 
Neuberger.

 * Sections of primary legislation would make no sense if the UK left the EU 
and so parliament could not have intended to allow a secretary of state power 
to withdraw from the union,Pannick said. Parliamentary authorisation is needed 
to render statutes invalid, he said. 
 * The government’s case is based on “a fundamental misunderstanding of the 
doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty”,Dominic Chambers QC, representing Deir 
Tozetti Dos Santos, claimed. He said the appellant seeks to say there is a 
prerogative and restrictions must be placed on it, whereas the correct approach 
is to acknowledge that it is for parliament to cede powers that the executive 
can use the prerogative to nullify rights in domestic law.
 
Dominic Chambers QC says under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, 
parliamentary authorisation is needed for the executive to nullify domestic 
rights.

He says the appellant’s approach, that the government doesn’t need 
authorisation, is “a fundamental misunderstanding of the doctrine of 
parliamentary sovereignty”.

Chambers argues the appellant is looking at the matter “the wrong way round” 
or “from the wrong end of the telescope”. He says James Eadie’s looks to see if 
there is a prerogative first and then says restrictions must be placed on it.

Chambers says this is incorrect, it is for parliament to cede the powers to 
use the prerogative to nullify rights in domestic law.

They adjourn for lunch until 2pm.

Chambers says if the European treaties could not have had effect in domestic 
law without the European Communities Act it must follow that they could only be 
removed by parliament and not the executive.

It is for parliament to choose whether to repeal legislation enacting a treaty 
in domestic law.

The triggering of article 50 by the government alone will bypass parliament, 
says Chambers.

The rights are domestic law rights; that principle is fundamental to the EU, 
that the rights have to be brought into domestic law, he continues.
