Your leader (20 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/the-guardian-view-on-technologys-ethical-egotism-about-profits-not-people>
) is wrong to suggest that drivers who use the Uber app in London are not 
regulated. All UK drivers are licensed by the local authority and must have 
commercial insurance in place. In the capital, this process includes going 
through the same enhancedDisclosure and Barring Service check 
<https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/overview> as teachers and 
black cab drivers, a medical assessment and a map reading test.

What we object to is Transport <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> for 
London piling unnecessary extra costs on to private hire drivers that won’t 
apply to black cab drivers, such as written English exams costing £200. These 
new rules threaten the livelihoods of thousands of drivers.

As for surge pricing, fares automatically rise when demand is very high to 
encourage more drivers to go to busy areas so passengers can get a car. This is 
completely transparent in the app, all riders are treated the same and it has 
nothing to do with phone battery.

Tech companies continually innovate to improve our cities. For example, our 
new car-sharing option, UberPool, has saved more than 1.3m miles being driven 
and we recently launched fully electric cars too. Government should be 
supporting, not stifling, such progress.
