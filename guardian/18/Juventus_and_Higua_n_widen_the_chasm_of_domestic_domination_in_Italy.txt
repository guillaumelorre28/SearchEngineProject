The numbers alone tell a story. Following a 1-0 victory over Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/17/juventus-roma-serie-a-match-report>
, Juventus sit seven points clear at the top of Serie A. TheBianconeri have won 
25 consecutive home matches, equaling a club record, and collected 100 points 
in this calendar year. They have been crowned as Serie A’s ‘winter champions’ – 
the unofficial title given to the team that leads the table at the season’s 
midway stage – with two games to spare.

And yet, an even more vivid picture of their domestic domination had been 
painted on the pitch at J-Stadium.Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> arrived as Serie A’s second-placed 
team, and boasting the division’s most prolific attack. They had beaten 
would-be contenders Lazio and Milan in their previous two matches and been 
heralded in the Italian press as the true “anti-Juve”.

Such a notion was punctured within 14 minutes of kick-off. That was all the 
time it took for Gonzalo Higuaín to do his thing. Seizing on an awkward touch 
from Daniele De Rossi, the Argentinian bulldozed through, leaving his opponent 
on the ground before jagging past Kostas Manolas and drilling a left-footed 
finish into the bottom corner of the net.

It was a fine goal, showcasing the striker’s brawn but also his brain. “I knew 
Manolas tends to slide in these situations, and that’s what happened,” he 
explained afterwards. “So I moved to avoid him and at that point I knew I had 
little time. I was on my left foot and had to shoot immediately or my shot 
would have been blocked.”

Juventus’s decision to invest €90m in Higuaín this summer might never win 
unanimous approval 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/27/crazy-transfer-fee-gonzalo-higuain-theatre-absurd-football>
. It remains an extraordinary sum to spend on a player who turned 29 this 
month, but he could not have done very much more to justify it over these past 
four months. Before this weekend he had scored winning goals against Juve’s 
bitter rivals Fiorentina, their neighbours Torino and last season’s runners-up 
(not to mention his former employers) Napoli.

Were it not for the sharp reflexes of Wojciech Szczesny, he might have added 
more this weekend. The goalkeeper had already done well to paw away one 
close-range Higuaín effort in the 10th minute, and went on to make several more 
stops over the course of the game.

Few others in a Roma shirt emerged with so much credit. After falling behind, 
theGiallorossi never truly threatened to reply. Manolas had one close-range 
effort blocked from a corner, while Juve’s Daniele Rugani did superbly to poke 
the ball away from Federico Fazio when the latter attempted to turn and shoot 
on the edge of the six-yard box. But Gigi Buffon barely made a save worthy of 
the name.

Szczesny would lament Roma’s lack of a winning mentality, saying that he and 
his team-mates: “need to carry ourselves more like men and less like little 
kids”. Others pointed to mistakes of team selection, Luciano Spalletti’s 
decision to start Gerson on the right-wing backfiring as the 19-year-old – a 
player with less than 90 minutes’ experience inSerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> under his belt – 
struggled to make any impact on the game.

Spalletti has been accused before now of experiencing a mental block with 
these opponents. This was the 22nd time that he has facedJuventus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> in his career as a manager, and 
the 18th time he has lost. His one and only win against them came in a Coppa 
Italia fixture 10 years ago.

Equally, though, we must acknowledge that no other Roma manager has ever 
tasted success at J-Stadium. Since the ground opened in 2011, Juventus have 
hosted theGiallorossi seven times, and won on every occasion – with an 
aggregate of 19-3.

That the stadium itself has been fundamental to Juventus’s domination of 
Italian football over the past half-decade is clear. The atmosphere generated 
in a packed, modern ground is one part of that picture. The ability to maximise 
revenue over time, and facilitate the signing of players such as Higuaín is 
another. There are good reasons why Roma are working towards building a new 
home of their own.

Szczesny, though, might have been on to something when he chose to focus his 
frustrations elsewhere. Because while it was true that Higuaín opened the 
scoring on Saturday, it was not he who prevented Roma from offering a response.

The visitors were overwhelmed instead by the work-rate and intensity of less 
heralded players: Mario Mandzukic – who fully justified his inclusion in the 
starting XI at the expense of Paulo Dybala – and Stefano Sturaro. Where the 
former player seemed to be at the heart of every attacking manoeuvre, the 
latter won possession constantly in midfield and even found space to break 
forward and demand saves from Szczesny twice late on.

Massimiliano Allegri was determined to highlight these truths at full-time. 
Asked a direct question about Higuaín, the manager replied that he would 
instead: “Underline again the match played by Sturaro. This club has a DNA 
which gets inside you, it’s easy to adapt quickly and it’s important to 
transmit that to all your players: the willingness to sacrifice is never 
missing.”

It is a core ingredient, doubtless, for a team that has its sights set firmly 
on a record-breaking sixth straight Serie A title. There is still a lot of this 
season left to go, a truth Juventus understand better than anyone following 
their recovery from a disastrous start last time around. Allegri pointed out 
that his team will still need to visit Roma later this season. Napoli, last 
season’s winter champions, gave a reminder of their own potential in a 5-3 win 
over Torino on Sunday.

Right now, though, the gap between the champions and the chasing pack looks as 
wide as it has ever done. “The suspicion is that it’s already over,” ran one 
headline in La Repubblica on Monday morning. It is not just the cold numbers 
that would lead them to think so.

Talking points 

• Corriere dello Sport renamed him as “Diego Armando Mertens”. The editors at 
Gazzetta charted a similar path with “Maramertens”. Call him what you will, but 
just know that Dries Mertens is on fire right now. The Belgian scored three 
goals in nine minutes for Napoli at the weekend – becoming the first player in 
more than two decades to score hat-tricks in consecutive Serie A games – and 
then capped his performance witha delicious chip back across his own body 
<https://twitter.com/dries_mertens14/status/810608901032792064> to leave Joe 
Hart stranded.

Napoli’s anticipated January signing of Leonardo Pavoletti appears to be a 
done deal, but at this rate the Italian may have to bide his time before 
getting his chance to start for a team that cannot stop scoring despite its 
lack of a conventional centre-forward.


• Papu Gómez has worn a series of bold captain’s armbands this season – his 
back catalogue includesa Halloween special

might have had a hard time seeing it amid the fog as Atalanta drew 0-0 with 
Milan.


• Lazio have rebounded from their derby defeat to Roma in style, and followed 
up last week’s win away to Sampdoria with a confident 3-1 victory at home 
against Fiorentina. They are up to fourth in the table, and above all continue 
to impress with their consistency. They have lost to the biggest teams this 
season – all three of Juventus, Roma and Milan – but not to anybody else.


• As if Juventus haven’t been having a good enough time on the pitch, there 
was positive news off it as well on Monday, as Leonardo Bonucci put pen to 
paper on a contract that will tie him to the club until 2021. Both Daniele 
Rugani and Stefano Sturaro also signed new deals last week.


• For the first time all season, Inter have gone two games without conceding a 
goal. Signs of life under Stefano Pioli, or just the consequence of running 
into a struggling Sassuolo team this weekend? TheNerazzurri hardly put in a 
sparkling performance, but you have to start somewhere. If they were able to 
get a positive result against Lazio on Wednesday – and right now that feels 
like a big if – the mood would be considerably brighter heading into the winter 
break.

• It was madness at the Marassi, as Genoa blew a 3-1 second-half lead to lose 
4-3 against last-placed Palermo. They had still been in front as late as the 
88th minute.
