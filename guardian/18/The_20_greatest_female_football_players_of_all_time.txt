1) Marta (Forward, Brazil)

It should be no surprise that Brazil gave the world two of the greatest 
players, male and female. Pele established his legacy years ago. Marta Vieira 
da Silva is still in the process of forging hers as the planet’s most talented 
player. Marta, nicknamed “Pele in skirts” by the Brazilian master, can do it 
all. The world has lost track of how many times she has turned a defender 
around and left her in the dust. That includes dribbling confounding foes with 
her superb skill, creating goals thanks to her vision, and scoring them thanks 
to a tenacious desire to succeed.

 Her personal accolades are remarkable, earning the Fifa female world player 
of the year five consecutive times (2006 to 2010). Marta also won the Golden 
Ball and Golden Boot at the 2007 Women’s World Cup and is the competition’s 
all-time scoring leader with 15 goals. The only thing missing from her trophy 
cabinet is a major championship, although Brazil have come close several times. 
The Brazilians took second to Germany at the 2007 World Cup and mined silver 
medals at the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics, losing to the United States both 
times. Having turned 30 in February, Marta is expected to be at full throttle 
at the Rio Olympics.

final. Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters 
Hamm, who finished with a world-record 158 international goals when she 
retired in 2004, was a double threat. Pacey and skillful, she was nominally a 
forward but often played like a midfielder. If defenders allowed her to run 
inside, she would go to goal. If they managed to force her outside, she would 
deliver a lethal, spot-on cross to a teammate on the far side. It certainly 
didn’t hurt that Hamm was bolstered by a talented supporting cast, some of whom 
have made this top 20 list. Regardless, her skill, vision and innate scoring 
ability made her the most dangerous and the best-known women’s player of her 
generation. Hamm, who made her international debut at 15 in 1987, earned 275 
caps while starring for the USA.

She won the Fifa women’s world player of the year the first two years of the 
award in 2001 and 2002. A member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame, Hamm also 
played a vital role for two Women’s World Cup winning teams in 1991 and 1999, 
converting a penalty in a shootout in the latter final. She was also part of 
two Olympic gold-medal winning sides (1996, 2004) and earned a silver medal in 
2000. Hamm is part of the ownership group of the Los Angeles Football Club, 
which is scheduled to start playing in Major League Soccer in 2017.

Talk about leaving a huge legacy. Akers defined not one, but two, positions in 
women’s soccer. In her younger days, Akers was a lethal striker. At 5ft 10in, 
her speed was deceptive because she could outrun defenders with her long 
stride. She struck twice in the first Women’s World Cup final in 1991, 
including the game-winner in the final minutes of a 2-1 triumph over Norway. 
After she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome in 
1994, Akers began a second life as a defensive midfielder, preventing goal 
opportunities instead of finishing them.

She helped the red, white and blue to the 1996 Olympic gold medal and to the 
1999 World Cup crown as well. Little surprise that Akers was named Fifa’s 
female player of the 20th century along with China’s Sun Wen. In the USA’s 
second international match ever in 1987, Akers scored the team’s first goal and 
went on from there. She retired just before the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

We can only wonder what more magic Akers could have produced had she not been 
struck down by illness (until then she was scoring at almost a goal a game). A 
member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame, Akers retired at the age of 34, 
having scored 105 times in 153 international games.

As stoppage time was running down in Germany’s 2-1 win over Brazil in the 
group stage of the 2000 Sydney Games, Prinz almost became the first women to 
register an Olympic hat-trick. Maren Meinert and Prinz found themselves on a 
break towards the Brazilian goal. But instead of passing to her teammate, 
Meinert took the shot, and put it wide. Prinz gave her team-mate a look of 
disbelief. That was classic Prinz, who had a killer instinct. Every shot she 
took she expected to score, and heaven forbid if a team-mate failed to release 
the ball at the right time.

Prinz was a difficult player to mark because she knew when to shoot, and she 
combined a physical presence with impressive pace. She demonstrated that in her 
international debut at 16, striking the game-winner in the 89th minute, 17 
minutes after coming on as a substitute. It should come as no surprise that 
Germany won the 2003 and 2007 Women’s World Cup, with Prinz earning the Golden 
Ball in the former and the Silver Ball in the latter. In 214 international 
appearances, she found the net 128 times.

At club level, Prinz scored 282 goals in as many matches for FSV Frankfurt, 
FFC Frankfurt and the Carolina Courage. Her trophy case is ridiculously 
overloaded with three Fifa world player of the year honors (2002, 2003 and 
2004). She was also named German player of the year eight years running. Prinz 
retired in 2011 at the age of 34.

the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2003. Photograph: Robert Laberge/Getty Images 
During China’s golden age of soccer, Sun Wen became her team’s go-to player 
when they needed a goal. She certainly didn’t disappoint, connecting 106 times 
in 152 international matches. Sun, who had the ability to conjure up assists 
for her team-mates, was so good that she pulled off the rarest of doubles at a 
major tournament. At the 1999 Women’s World Cup, she earning the Golden Ball 
and Golden Boot (sharing the prize with Marta).

Sun’s goals were not only came in quantity, but quality too. After the striker 
scored a spectacular, 32-yard free kick in China’s 1-1 draw with the USA at the 
Sydney Olympics, April Heinrichs, then the American head coach, gave Sun high 
praise. “I’d pay for her to come to play in the United States in the WUSA 
[Women’s United Soccer Association],” she said. “She’s so well-rounded. She’s 
composed and a great leader who leads by example for 90 minutes.”

Sun’s mobility that game was hampered by a brace and bandage wrapped over her 
left knee. Yet, she found ways to make life difficult for the US. Sun never won 
a major tournament as China finished second to the USA in the 1996 Olympics and 
was runner-up to her rivals, losing in a shootout at the 1999 Women’s World Cup 
final.

Abby Wambach could be likened to a human battering ram, playing as though her 
body was invulnerable, although it wasn’t. Wambach never saw a heading 
opportunity she didn’t like, and she scored more than a third of her goals in 
the air en route a world-record 184 international strikes in 255 matches (and, 
by the way, she had 75 assists).

Perhaps her most dramatic header was that spectacular goal she scored in 
stoppage time after 120 minutes against Brazil in the 2011 World Cup 
quarter-finals. It leveled the game and forced a shootout, which the Americans 
won. Fifa later declared it the greatest Women’s World Cup goal.

At the 2004 Athens Olympics, Wambach made sure part of the Americans’ quest 
was about winning gold for their retiring players. She came through in dramatic 
fashion, striking for the game-winner in extra-time against Brazil in the final.

In her later years, Wambach became the spokesperson for the team, putting 
situations, controversies and challenges into proper context with her 
team-mates and the media. Her unofficial philosophy was that it wasn’t about 
her, even though it often was, especially in 2012 when she was voted Fifa world 
player of the year. After earning two Olympic gold medals, Wambach finally 
completed her elusive quest of winning the World Cup with the USA at the 2015 
competition in Canada before retiring late last year.

Overshadowed by flashier players, Sawa let her game do the talking. She was 
smooth as silk on the ball while starring for Japan during an illustrious 
23-year international career, from 1993 to 2015. Sawa gave notice to the rest 
of the world in her international debut against the Philippines, scoring four 
times in a win. She retired at the age of 37, collecting 83 goals in 204 
appearances, both Japanese records.

Sawa, who was equally effective creating or scoring goals due to her superior 
skills and vision, finally earned her just desserts as one of the world’s 
greats when Japan captured their first Women’s World Cup crown in 2011. She 
scored in the 117th minute of the final, before Japan beat the US on penalties. 
As for individual honors, Sawa took home the Golden Ball and Golden Boot. Not 
surprisingly, she was named 2011 Fifa world player of the year. Sawa also 
earned a silver medal at the 2012 London Olympics, losing out to the USA.

Little wonder that Kelly Smith was chosen as a Member of the Order of the 
British Empire in 2008. She was a special player, the first English female 
player to make an international impact in modern times. She was lethal with 
both feet, scoring 46 goals in 117 appearances over a remarkable two-decade 
international career (1995-2015).

 A striker who wasn’t afraid to set up her team-mates, Smith made headlines 
with Seton Hall University in New Jersey, which wasn’t known for its women’s 
soccer until the 1990s. Smith became the first athlete in any sport to be named 
Big East offensive player of the year and newcomer of the year in the same 
season. With her college team-mates providing limited attacking talent to 
complement her awesome ability, Smith still finished with a school-record 76 
goals in 51 matches.

in the United States before returning home for Arsenal Ladies (where she scored 
an astounding 73 goals in 66 games from 2005-2009). She helped England qualify 
for their first Women’s World Cup in 2007 and also played in the tournament in 
2011. She also was a member of a combined Great Britain side that reached the

several years ago: “I think she’s the best all-around player in the world … I 
think she is probably is the most underrated player in the whole world.” In 
fact, if there is one player who has a shot at Wambach’s international goal 
scoring record (184 goals), it’s the 33-year-old Sinclair, who enters the Rio 
Olympics with 162 goals in 230 matches.

When she is at the top of her game, Sinclair can be devastating, playing like 
a midfielder, bringing the ball forward towards the opposition goal. Like many 
of her contemporaries, Sinclair made her international debut as a teenager, as 
a 16-year-old at the Algarve Cup.

Her most memorable performance might have been her hat-trick in that 
unforgettable 4-3 semi-final loss to the USA at the 2012 Olympics, when Canada 
won the bronze medal. Sinclair endured a disappointing Women’s World Cup in her 
native country in 2015, scoring twice as Canada were eliminated in the 
quarter-finals. She and her team-mates certainly can make up for it with 
another medal in Rio.

When starting goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg suffered a knee injury that kept her 
out of the 2007 Women’s World Cup, Nadine Angerer took her place and Germany 
didn’t miss a beat. Moreover, Germany and Angerer didn’t concede in six games – 
a record – en route to the team’s second successive world title. Angerer also 
saved Marta’s penalty to preserve a clean sheet in a 2-0 triumph in the final.

As it turned out, stopping penalties became one of Angerer’s specialties. 
Named Germany captain after Prinz retired in 2011, Angerer made two vital 
peanlty saves against Sweden to help Germany to the 2013 European crown. 
“Nadine is such a leader on her team, a role model,” said former USA coach Tony 
DiCicco, who was a goalkeeper himself, adding that Angerer did not have “any 
glaring weaknesses”.

Lilly just went on running and running. She played in a world record 352 
internationals, a mark that may never be broken (scoring 130 goals as well). 
Lilly probably will be best remembered for her headed clearance off the line in 
extra time of the 1999 Women’s World Cup final. She played on two world 
champion sides (1991, 1999) and has two Olympic gold medals and a silver in her 
collection.

Norway’s best ever player, Riise was the centerpiece of the country’s wins at 
the 1995 Women’s World Cup and the 2000 Olympics. The attacking midfielder 
started playing soccer with boys’ teams at the age of six before joining a 
girls’ side at 14. When she retired from international soccer in 2004, Riise 
had scored 58 goals in a Norwegian-record 188 matches.

Few players were as deadly at set pieces as Sisleide Lima do Amor. Better 
known as Sissi, the Brazilian midfielder came to prominence as her national 
side was gaining recognition and beginning to turn heads around the world. 
Joining the Brazilian national team at 16, Sissi’s most memorable moments came 
at the 1999 Women’s World Cup when she shared the Golden Boot with China’s Sun 
Wen, while helping Brazil to a third-place finish. She also was a member of 
Brazil’s fourth-place side at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

One of only three goalkeepers who have won the Women’s World Cup (1999) and an 
Olympic gold medal (1996 and 2004) – the USA’s Hope Solo and Norway’s Bente 
Nordby are the others – Scurry proved to be a steadying presence while helping 
the Americans to victory after victory during a memorable 15-year career. 
Scurry finished with 173 caps, and secured 71 clean sheets.

Before there was a Fifa women’s world player of the year award, you could have 
made a great case for Carin Jennings-Gabarra as being the planet’s best player. 
She was outstanding in the very first Women’s World Cup in 1991, earning Golden 
Ball honors via a virtuoso performance in the midfield. She was a double 
threat, recording five goals and five assists. Jennings-Gabarra, who collected 
53 goals in 117 international appearances, was forced to retire due to injuries 
after the USA won the 1996 Olympic gold medal. She is currently the women’s 
soccer coach at the US Naval Academy.

Fawcett will be remembered as a fierce central defender. For many years, 
Fawcett partnered with Carla Overbeck to form one of the finest defensive 
tandems in women’s soccer. She did a lot of the little things that got lost in 
the limelight of her attack minded team-mates. The first US international to 
become a mother, Fawcett never lost a beat after she returned from giving 
birth. A member of two Women’s World Cup championship teams (1991 and 1999) and 
two Olympic gold medalists (1996 and 2004), Fawcett scored 27 times in 239 
international matches.

Before she directed the USA to the 2008 and 2012 Olympic gold medals and to a 
second-place finish at the 2011 Women’s World Cup, Sundhage was a world-class 
forward who also performed in midfield and even on defense. She scored 71 times 
in 146 international matches, helping the Swedes to a third-place finish at the 
1991 World Cup. Sundhage was so good that her image appeared on a Swedish stamp 
in 1988. A year later she put her stamp on an international friendly win over 
England, becoming the first woman to score in an international game at Wembley.

Before women’s international soccer took a foothold, Lily Parr was a true 
pioneer. She was a regular scorer for the Preston Ladies and Dick, Kerr’s 
Ladies in England. Women were banned from playing soccer on affiliated grounds 
in 1921, but that didn’t stop her teams from raising hundreds of thousands of 
pounds for charity. Despite being a chain smoker, Parr played at an extremely 
high level, helping her teams dominate games. A Preston newspaper reported that 
Parr had tallied 967 goals out of the team’s total of 3,022 goals, a 
devastating ratio.

While Birgit Prinz and Maren Meinert were giving opposing defenders and 
goalkeepers headaches during Germany’s 2003 Women’s World Cup championship run, 
Rottenberg was a stabilizing force at the back with her steady play. She 
conceded four goals in six matches while registering two shutouts as the 
Germans became the first side to win back-to-back titles. A knee injury kept 
Rottenberg out of the 2007 World Cup. She made 125 appearances for Germany 
before retiring in 2008.
