became Paris Saint-Germain’s top scorer in a single Ligue 1 season after 
marking his final appearance at the Parc des Princes with a double in the 
champions’ 4-0 victory over Nantes.

The Sweden international, who will leave PSG when his contract expires

in the summer, scored in the 17th and 89th minutes to surpass the 37-goal 
record set by Carlos Bianchi in 1977-78.

The first-half opener came just seven minutes after the home crowd paid 
tribute to Ibrahimovic, the PSG captain for the night, with a standing ovation.

Ibrahimovic was also involved in the buildup to PSG’s second goal two minutes 
before half-time from Lucas Moura and, after Marquinhos added a third seven 
minutes after the interval, the striker had the final say with his 
record-breaking effort at the end.
