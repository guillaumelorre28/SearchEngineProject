It seems fitting to end on the performance that stands out for so many people: 
when Bowie beamed himself into households up and down the UK and changed pop 
music forever. Thanks for all your comments.

The Fader <http://www.thefader.com/2016/01/11/david-bowie-talks-race> have 
written about all the times Bowie confronted race in America, and made special 
mention of his appearance on Arsenio Hall
 Bowie on Arsenio Hall 
“It’s a very strange situation for me because I think with both of us having 
so called celebrity status, as soon as we step outside of doors we’re known as 
David and Iman,” he said. “I don’t know what it’d be like for us—you don’t see 
that many mixed couples in America. In Europe there’s a lot of couples. Over 
here there still a rarity, it’s still this separatist type of thing over here. 
I don’t know what it’d be for like for us if we weren’t known in our own right. 
You get the odd snide remark but, nothing with any weight.”

A few more tributes from musicians now. Here’s a statement from Mark Guiliana, 
who played drums on Blackstar:

David, THANK YOU from the bottom of my humble heart for letting me into your 
life, and in doing so changing mine. It was an absolute honor to create with 
you. I am forever grateful. Love, Mark

There’s another from Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott who had a tribute act to the 
Ziggy-period of Bowie:

He’s been a massive part of my life since I first heard Starman in 1972. So 
many of us came in at that moment, myself, Bono, Boy George, Morrissey, Gary 
Kemp, Jim Kerr, Brett Anderson, Pete Murphy, Gary Numan, millions of fans, all 
very different from each other but all with one thing in common, the belief 
that a true rock & roll alien had landed on earth & he was ours. I own every 
record he ever made, he was plastered all over my bedroom wall as a kid, he was 
my very first bootleg, his CDs take up 2 whole shelves in my collection. I have 
personally recorded over 25 of his songs either on my own, with Leppard or with 
the Cybernauts. I met him two or three times and always found him charming and 
engaging. It is said, never meet your heroes, they will let you down. Bullshit. 
He was open, funny, a good listener and when myself and Phil joined David on 
stage with Queen, Mick Ronson and Ian Hunter at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Gig 
in 1992 it became one of the most memorable musical moments of my life. I can’t 
believe he’s gone. A huge hole has opened up in my heart and it feels like my 
youth has been further ripped away from me. At least I have a lifetime of his 
music to comfort me, as we all have, as he left behind one hell of a legacy. 
The Starman waiting in the sky waits no longer. Rest in PeaceDavid Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> and thank you for giving us 
believers something to believe in.”

Madonna: 'I’m devastated'

Madonna has shared some thoughts on Bowie on her Facebook page 
<https://www.facebook.com/madonna>.

I’m devastated.

David Bowie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> changed the course 
of my life forever. I never felt like I fit in growing up in Michigan. Like an 
oddball or a freak. I went to see him in concert at Cobo Arena in Detroit. It 
was the first concert I’d ever been too. I snuck out of the house with my 
girlfriend wearing a cape.

We got caught after and I was grounded for the summer. I didn’t care.

I already had many of his records and was so inspired by the way he played 
with gender confusion.

Was both masculine and feminine.

Funny and serious.

Clever and wise.

His lyrics were witty ironic and mysterious.

At the time he was the thin white Duke and he had mime artists on stage with 
him and very specific choreography

And I saw how he created a persona and used different art forms within the 
arena of rock and Roll to create entertainment.

I found him so inspiring and innovative.

Unique and provocative. A real genius.

His music was always inspiring but seeing him live set me off on a journey 
that for me I hope will never end.

His photographs are hanging all over my house today.

He was so chic and beautiful and elegant.

So ahead of his time.

Thank you David Bowie.

I owe you a lot.

The world will miss you.

Love

M

'Once in a while, the world lights on fire with the music'
 Lady Gaga with her Golden Globe Photograph: Splash News/Corbis 
While on the Hollywood Reporter podcast, Lady Gaga spoke about the influence 
of Bowie.Billboard reports 
<http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6836536/lady-gaga-describes-love-david-bowie?utm_source=twitter>
:

“When I fell in love with David Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie>, when I was living on the Lower 
East Side, I always felt that his glamor was something he was using to express 
a message to people that was very healing for their souls,” she recalled toTHR
’s Scott Feinberg. “He is a true, true artist and I don’t know if I ever went, 
‘Oh, I’m going to be that way like this,’ or if I arrived upon it slowly, 
realizing it was my calling and that’s what drew me to him …

“I just know that you can use the theater of your imagination to entertain 
people beyond their wildest dreams and then you can put something inside of 
that that changes the world, and that to me is when you make something truly 
great as an artist,” she continued as she connected the dots between Bowie’s 
career and her own.

“You don’t nail it every time. I definitely don’t, with all my songs, always 
hit that note. You try. And every once in a while, the world lights on fire 
with the music.”

 Faddy duddy: Martin Amis Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian 
The New Statesman has published Martin Amis’s gig review from 1973 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/cultural-capital/2015/04/archive-martin-amis-mild-fad-david-bowie>
 where he predicted Bowie would be a fad …

This incongruity may be responsible for Bowie’s appeal and for what (if 
anything) is sinister about it. Among certain more affluent hippies Bowie is 
apparently the symbol of a kind of thrilling extremism, a life-style (the word 
is for once permissible) characterised by sexual omnivorousness, lavish use of 
stimulants – particularly cocaine, very much an élitist drug, being both 
expensive and galvanising – self-parodied narcissism, and a glamorously early 
death. To dignify this unhappy outlook with such a term as “nihilist” would, of 
course, be absurd; but Bowie does appear to be a new focus for the vague, 
predatory, escapist reveries of the alienated young. Although Bowie himself is 
unlikely to last long as a cult, it is hard to believe that the feelings he has 
aroused or aggravated will vanish along with the fashion built round him.

The view from New York
 Tribute at David Bowie’s New York home Photograph: Scott Houston/Corbis 
My colleague Jessica Glenza is outside Bowie’s Soho residence where fans are 
gathering.

Long-time fans and newcomers to Bowie’s music gathered at his home on 
Lafayette Street in New York’s Soho neighborhood.

Greg Petan, a 52-year-old artist who lives in the Soho area, came to leave a 
copy of David Live, the 1974 record, among flowers and candles at the artist’s 
home.

“It’s in the title I guess,” about why he chose the record. “Greatfully, 
through the medium of recorded music people can live for ever.”

Petan said he’s been listening to Bowie’s music since he was eight years old. 
Others who came to pay tribute at the doorstep just discovered the artist.

“I’m fairly young but this past year I started getting into his music,” said 
Adrian Vallejo, a 21-year-old fan. “I just know his impact on everything, he’s 
not just some random person. He’s someone who is insanely important.”

Alexis Petridis on Bowie
 Tributes to David Bowie, Berlin, Germany Photograph: Action 
Press/REX/Shutterstock 
Alexis Petridis has written a long read on the enduring appeal and legacy of 
Bowie. It’s well worth finding the time for. Here’s a snippet:

Dozens of books have been written about him, some of them hugely illuminating, 
but something unknowable lurked at the centre. Almost from the start, Bowie’s 
career raised questions to which a definitive answer seemed elusive. If he was, 
as he loudly claimed in 1971, gay, then what was the deal with the very visible 
wife and the son he’d just written a touching little song about? If he was, as 
hedramatically announced from the stage of the Hammersmith Odeon in July 1973 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-G1Uy0OkCw>, retiring – either from music, or 
from live performance, or from the character of Ziggy Stardust – then what was 
he doing back onstage in London three months later, belting outThe Jean Genie 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEmGQYCuc6M> in full Ziggy drag? How does 
anyone in the state Bowie was, by all accounts, in by 1975 – ravaged by cocaine 
to the point where he seemed to have genuinely gone insane; paranoid and 
hallucinating – make an album like Station to Station: not a messily compelling 
document of a mind unravelling, like the solo albums of his great idolSyd 
Barrett <https://www.theguardian.com/music/sydbarrett>, but a work of precision 
and focus and exquisitely controlled power that’s arguably his best? In a world 
of cameraphones and social media, how could anyone as famous as Bowie disappear 
from public view as completely as he seemed to between 2008 and 2013: moreover, 
how could anyone as famous as Bowie record a comeback album in the middle of 
Manhattan without anyone noticing or leaking details to the media? How does 
anyone stage-manage their own death as dramatically as Bowie appears to have 
done: releasing their most acclaimed album in decades, filled with strange, 
enigmatic songs whose meaning suddenly pulls into focus when their author dies 
two days later?

More from Beckenham and Hannah Ellis Petersen, who reports on a shrine that’s 
been set up:

A small shrine has been set up in the bandstand in the Beckenham recreation 
park where Bowie staged his Arts Lab festival in August 1969, performing 
alongside Tony Visconti. The park is going to be kept open all night so fans 
can come pay their tributes.

Standing on the Beckenham park bandstand next to the Bowie shrine, local Nigel 
Goodge said: “I came here because it feels nice to stand on the spot where he 
played when he was just 22, way back in 1969. I was 14 when I saw him do 
Starman on Top of the Pops – my dad was horrified but it was hugely influential 
on me. He was this ordinary guy filled with an extraordinary creative spirit. 
I’ve been reeling since I heard the news this morning, I’m still in shock. But 
in Bowie style, he went out with a great performance. And we are so incredibly 
proud that Beckenham, us, has a place in the Bowie story. That such an 
influential giant of a man started out in this dull suburban town.”

The tributes are still coming but we’re going to round off the action here. 
His a summary of what’s happened in the 14 or so hours since news broke that
David Bowie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> had died.

 * The 69-year-old musician, singer and actor has died after from cancer, his 
official Facebook page has announced 
<https://www.facebook.com/davidbowie/posts/10153176666977665>. Bowie died on 
Sunday “surrounded by his family after a courageous 18 month battle with 
cancer”, it said.

 * Bowie died two days after the release of his final album, Blackstar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-of-cancer-aged-69-reports#block-5693ae36e4b0962b6cc0e539>
, which was issued on his 69th birthday, and looks set to top the UK charts. 
 * We’ve detailed the impact Bowie had on fashion, music and culture at large, 
with Alexis Petridis detailingwhy he’s one of Britain’s greatest pop acts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-man-who-thrilled-the-world-appreciation>
. 
 * Numerous tributes have been paid to Bowie’s astonishing catalogue of work 
and his many reinventions and incarnations. Those expressing sorrow have 
included collaborators like Iggy Pop; fellow pop stars including Madonna, the 
Rolling Stones and Kanye West; politicians including David Cameron and Tony 
Blair; and the astronaut Tim Peake.

It seems fitting to end on the performance that stands out for so many people: 
when Bowie beamed himself into households up and down the UK and changed pop 
music forever. Thanks for all your comments.
 David Bowie on Top of the Pops  
The Fader <http://www.thefader.com/2016/01/11/david-bowie-talks-race> have 
written about all the times Bowie confronted race in America, and made special 
mention of his appearance on Arsenio Hall
 Bowie on Arsenio Hall 
“It’s a very strange situation for me because I think with both of us having 
so called celebrity status, as soon as we step outside of doors we’re known as 
David and Iman,” he said. “I don’t know what it’d be like for us—you don’t see 
that many mixed couples in America. In Europe there’s a lot of couples. Over 
here there still a rarity, it’s still this separatist type of thing over here. 
I don’t know what it’d be for like for us if we weren’t known in our own right. 
You get the odd snide remark but, nothing with any weight.”

A few more tributes from musicians now. Here’s a statement from Mark Guiliana, 
who played drums on Blackstar:

David, THANK YOU from the bottom of my humble heart for letting me into your 
life, and in doing so changing mine. It was an absolute honor to create with 
you. I am forever grateful. Love, Mark

There’s another from Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott who had a tribute act to the 
Ziggy-period of Bowie:

He’s been a massive part of my life since I first heard Starman in 1972. So 
many of us came in at that moment, myself, Bono, Boy George, Morrissey, Gary 
Kemp, Jim Kerr, Brett Anderson, Pete Murphy, Gary Numan, millions of fans, all 
very different from each other but all with one thing in common, the belief 
that a true rock & roll alien had landed on earth & he was ours. I own every 
record he ever made, he was plastered all over my bedroom wall as a kid, he was 
my very first bootleg, his CDs take up 2 whole shelves in my collection. I have 
personally recorded over 25 of his songs either on my own, with Leppard or with 
the Cybernauts. I met him two or three times and always found him charming and 
engaging. It is said, never meet your heroes, they will let you down. Bullshit. 
He was open, funny, a good listener and when myself and Phil joined David on 
stage with Queen, Mick Ronson and Ian Hunter at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Gig 
in 1992 it became one of the most memorable musical moments of my life. I can’t 
believe he’s gone. A huge hole has opened up in my heart and it feels like my 
youth has been further ripped away from me. At least I have a lifetime of his 
music to comfort me, as we all have, as he left behind one hell of a legacy. 
The Starman waiting in the sky waits no longer. Rest in PeaceDavid Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> and thank you for giving us 
believers something to believe in.”

Unsurprisingly Spotify saw streams of Bowie songs spike by 2700% when news of 
his death broke. Here are the top five tracks:

1. Under Pressure

2. Space Oddity

3. Life On Mars?

4. Heroes

I’m devastated.

David Bowie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> changed the course 
of my life forever. I never felt like I fit in growing up in Michigan. Like an 
oddball or a freak. I went to see him in concert at Cobo Arena in Detroit. It 
was the first concert I’d ever been too. I snuck out of the house with my 
girlfriend wearing a cape.

We got caught after and I was grounded for the summer. I didn’t care.

I already had many of his records and was so inspired by the way he played 
with gender confusion.

Was both masculine and feminine.

Funny and serious.

Clever and wise.

His lyrics were witty ironic and mysterious.

At the time he was the thin white Duke and he had mime artists on stage with 
him and very specific choreography

And I saw how he created a persona and used different art forms within the 
arena of rock and Roll to create entertainment.

I found him so inspiring and innovative.

Unique and provocative. A real genius.

His music was always inspiring but seeing him live set me off on a journey 
that for me I hope will never end.

His photographs are hanging all over my house today.

He was so chic and beautiful and elegant.

So ahead of his time.

Thank you David Bowie.

I owe you a lot.

The world will miss you.

Love

:

“When I fell in love with David Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie>, when I was living on the Lower 
East Side, I always felt that his glamor was something he was using to express 
a message to people that was very healing for their souls,” she recalled toTHR
’s Scott Feinberg. “He is a true, true artist and I don’t know if I ever went, 
‘Oh, I’m going to be that way like this,’ or if I arrived upon it slowly, 
realizing it was my calling and that’s what drew me to him …

“I just know that you can use the theater of your imagination to entertain 
people beyond their wildest dreams and then you can put something inside of 
that that changes the world, and that to me is when you make something truly 
great as an artist,” she continued as she connected the dots between Bowie’s 
career and her own.

“You don’t nail it every time. I definitely don’t, with all my songs, always 
hit that note. You try. And every once in a while, the world lights on fire 
with the music.”

The New Statesman has published Martin Amis’s gig review from 1973 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/cultural-capital/2015/04/archive-martin-amis-mild-fad-david-bowie>
 where he predicted Bowie would be a fad …

This incongruity may be responsible for Bowie’s appeal and for what (if 
anything) is sinister about it. Among certain more affluent hippies Bowie is 
apparently the symbol of a kind of thrilling extremism, a life-style (the word 
is for once permissible) characterised by sexual omnivorousness, lavish use of 
stimulants – particularly cocaine, very much an élitist drug, being both 
expensive and galvanising – self-parodied narcissism, and a glamorously early 
death. To dignify this unhappy outlook with such a term as “nihilist” would, of 
course, be absurd; but Bowie does appear to be a new focus for the vague, 
predatory, escapist reveries of the alienated young. Although Bowie himself is 
unlikely to last long as a cult, it is hard to believe that the feelings he has 
aroused or aggravated will vanish along with the fashion built round him.
  Tribute at David Bowie’s New York home Photograph: Scott Houston/Corbis 
My colleague Jessica Glenza is outside Bowie’s Soho residence where fans are 
gathering.

Long-time fans and newcomers to Bowie’s music gathered at his home on 
Lafayette Street in New York’s Soho neighborhood.

Greg Petan, a 52-year-old artist who lives in the Soho area, came to leave a 
copy of David Live, the 1974 record, among flowers and candles at the artist’s 
home.

“It’s in the title I guess,” about why he chose the record. “Greatfully, 
through the medium of recorded music people can live for ever.”

Petan said he’s been listening to Bowie’s music since he was eight years old. 
Others who came to pay tribute at the doorstep just discovered the artist.

“I’m fairly young but this past year I started getting into his music,” said 
Adrian Vallejo, a 21-year-old fan. “I just know his impact on everything, he’s 
not just some random person. He’s someone who is insanely important.”

Alexis Petridis has written a long read on the enduring appeal and legacy of 
Bowie. It’s well worth finding the time for. Here’s a snippet:

Dozens of books have been written about him, some of them hugely illuminating, 
but something unknowable lurked at the centre. Almost from the start, Bowie’s 
career raised questions to which a definitive answer seemed elusive. If he was, 
as he loudly claimed in 1971, gay, then what was the deal with the very visible 
wife and the son he’d just written a touching little song about? If he was, as 
hedramatically announced from the stage of the Hammersmith Odeon in July 1973 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-G1Uy0OkCw>, retiring – either from music, or 
from live performance, or from the character of Ziggy Stardust – then what was 
he doing back onstage in London three months later, belting outThe Jean Genie 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEmGQYCuc6M> in full Ziggy drag? How does 
anyone in the state Bowie was, by all accounts, in by 1975 – ravaged by cocaine 
to the point where he seemed to have genuinely gone insane; paranoid and 
hallucinating – make an album like Station to Station: not a messily compelling 
document of a mind unravelling, like the solo albums of his great idolSyd 
Barrett <https://www.theguardian.com/music/sydbarrett>, but a work of precision 
and focus and exquisitely controlled power that’s arguably his best? In a world 
of cameraphones and social media, how could anyone as famous as Bowie disappear 
from public view as completely as he seemed to between 2008 and 2013: moreover, 
how could anyone as famous as Bowie record a comeback album in the middle of 
Manhattan without anyone noticing or leaking details to the media? How does 
anyone stage-manage their own death as dramatically as Bowie appears to have 
done: releasing their most acclaimed album in decades, filled with strange, 
enigmatic songs whose meaning suddenly pulls into focus when their author dies 
two days later?

More from Beckenham and Hannah Ellis Petersen, who reports on a shrine that’s 
been set up:

A small shrine has been set up in the bandstand in the Beckenham recreation 
park where Bowie staged his Arts Lab festival in August 1969, performing 
alongside Tony Visconti. The park is going to be kept open all night so fans 
can come pay their tributes.

Standing on the Beckenham park bandstand next to the Bowie shrine, local Nigel 
Goodge said: “I came here because it feels nice to stand on the spot where he 
played when he was just 22, way back in 1969. I was 14 when I saw him do 
Starman on Top of the Pops – my dad was horrified but it was hugely influential 
on me. He was this ordinary guy filled with an extraordinary creative spirit. 
I’ve been reeling since I heard the news this morning, I’m still in shock. But 
in Bowie style, he went out with a great performance. And we are so incredibly 
proud that Beckenham, us, has a place in the Bowie story. That such an 
influential giant of a man started out in this dull suburban town.”
