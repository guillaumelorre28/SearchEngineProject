John Constable, The Cornfield, 1826
This timeless pastoral scene transposes Arcadia to the English countryside as 
a shepherd boy drinks from a stream and his dog keeps an eye on the sheep. 
Clouds billow and darken in a superbly realistic threatening of rain. This 
great landscape manages to be both matter of fact and captivatingly mythic.
• National Gallery

 Hungarian refugees at the border of Austria and Hungary (1956). Photograph: 
Ata Kandó / Nederlands Fotomuse 
The 103-year-old photographer Ata Kando was interviewed this week for our My 
Best Shot feature 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jan/12/ata-kando-best-photograph-hungarian-refugees>
, about this image of Hungarian Gypsies in a refugee camp in 1956. “They fled 
Hungary and the Russian army because of the discrimination they suffered after 
the uprising failed. Gypsies have always been targeted in Hungary, and things 
were no different under Soviet rule. Had they not left they would have been 
executed,” she said.
