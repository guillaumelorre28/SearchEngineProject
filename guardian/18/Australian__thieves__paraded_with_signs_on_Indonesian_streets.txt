An Australian man and woman accused of stealing a bicycle have been paraded 
through the streets of an Indonesian island with signs around their necks 
warning others against theft.

The pair wore identical signs made of cardboard and string with the message: 
“I AM THIEVE. DON’T DO WHAT I DID...!!!” as they walked through the streets 
flanked by members of the local security force for Gili Trawangan island.

 quoted a member of the force as saying they were caught on CCTV stealing a 
bicycle at around 1pm on Saturday. They were paraded on Sunday and have since 
left the island.

Gili Trawangan, the largest of the three Gili Islands near Bali, has a 
permanent population of about 800 people and is less than 2 miles long.

A man who works at a dive shop told the Guardian the duo had booked a diving 
trip and were doing the “walk of shame”, a punishment used regularly by local 
law enforcement.

He said the island was so small that there was no police presence. Residents 
had formed a local security force that was governed by authorities on the 
mainland and enforced the shaming penalty to discourage stealing

“It’s not just a group of vigilantes,” said Mike, who asked to be referred to 
only by his first name. “I’ve been here a year and it’s happened between seven 
and nine times, to tourists but locals as well.”

black police-style clothing with truncheons.
