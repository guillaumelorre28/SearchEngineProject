After a week counting down, the winner of the BBC’s Sound of 2017 poll has 
been revealed: R&B singerRay BLK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/06/ray-blk-winner-bbc-music-sound-of-2017-rap-soul>
. The Brits, of course, have already spoken. Their Critics’ Choice award last 
month crowned Uckfield bluesmanRag’n’Bone Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/08/ragnbone-man-wins-2017-brits-critics-choice-award>
 the rootsy solo artist most likely to succeed; he is also the BBCSO17 
runner-up. Technically, Rag’n’Bone Man has been bubbling under for some time 
now and we could probably take this as a positive, as evidence of the music 
industry nurturing an artist. In choosing him, the Brits did not go for the 
most obvious pop choice in Dua Lipa.

Having put the already well-known US singer-rapper Anderson .Paak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/10/anderson-paak-interview-malibu-dr-dre>
 on the longlist, the BBC has not gone for the dead cert, either – a victory 
for imagination.

Ray BLK’s tunes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3iyojYJ38> are sometimes 
stark, but accessible, with distinctive British concerns. Aside from the high 
quality of her work, the fact that BLK (which stands for Building, Living, 
Knowing) is not signed to a major label is significant; she responded to her 
win by dropping a freestyle about not becoming industry cannon fodder. So it’s 
a victory not just for the Catford singer, but for independent up’n’comers, and 
for the influence of UK urban music; there are four young black women in the 
SO2017 top five. BLK is not strictly grime, but has collaborated with MCs such 
as Stormzy; a UK hip-hop flavour permeates her work.

Like the Mercury roll call, the BBC Sound Of longlist (of 15) provides a 
crucial jump-start to the non-winning contenders, and illustrates subtle 
tectonic shifts. The embarrassing whiteness of our music awards ceremonies – a 
situation not confined to#oscarssowhite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/25/oscarssowhite-right-and-wrong-academy-awards-audience>
 – has begun to be been addressed, with grime, a genuinely fresh, young British 
genre, finally taking considerable pride of place outside the Mobos. Last 
year’s Mercury win by veteran rapperSkepta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/10/skepta-konnichiwa-boy-better-know-mercurys>
 has been parlayed into a varied slew of new male and female MCs here.

 Stefflon Don. 
There is no shortage of commerce to Stefflon Don 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5NrB84dPnSZ5LdwGxYSM0Kk/stefflon-don>
, a kind of homegrown answer to Nicki Minaj, while the silver-tongued Mobo 
winnerNadia Rose <http://www.nadiarosemusic.com/> (fifth in BBCSO17 poll) keeps 
it way more Croydon. Even the smootherRaye <http://www.raye-music.com/> – the 
Charli XCX protege and third in SO2017 – has an edge, a distinctively London 
feel.

More generally, pop’s appetite for solo artists (cheap to run) seems 
undiminished, keeping boys in bands in the minority. With songs about wanking 
into quiche, Mossley’s Cabbage were never going to top lists, but scurvyish 
polemic is not entirely gone from new music. It was as heartening to see the 
five-piecereact so violently on Twitter to an endorsement by the Sun 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/38496358/cabbage-attack-the-sun-after-being-tipped-for-success>
 as it was to hear Declan McKenna taking Fifa to task on his 2015 breakthrough 
track,Brazil <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r0QFD1oPM>. Not everyone young, 
it seems, is writing commercial pop-soul about heartbreak. And even when they 
are – take the slow-burn R&B ofJorja Smith 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38459936> (fourth), for instance 
– it can go hand in hand with vérité tunes in which someone with a guilty 
conscience is spooked by flashing blue lights.

You can’t help but wish BLK and these other emerging artists well, as you 
might wish an acquaintance traversing the South Pole on a hoverboard good luck: 
they are going to need it. It’s getting infinitely harder to do an Adele, who 
won both tips in 2008, and actually sell actual records, or even a James Bay 
(2015 Brits critics’ choice).

Last week, the news emerged that the biggest-selling UK debut album of last 
year was not by Jack Garratt (2016’s BBC Sound Of and Brits critics’ choice). 
Nor was it by Zayn Malik or Blossoms, the token SO2016 guitar band who went to 
No 1 with their debut album. It was 56-year-old TV personalityBradley Walsh 
<http://www.bradleywalsh.co.uk/chasing-dreams/>, with some swing covers.

Yes, there are obvious demographics. Millennials buy fewer albums than 
over-50s ITV viewers. Swing albums themselves have a perverse appeal: just ask 
Robbie Williams. Obviously, there are new ways of measuring success now: 
tickets sold, streams, earnings from syncs, and Ray BLK’s people will be 
maximising revenue from all of them.

But you can’t help wanting to butt a bass bin in frustration that album sales 
are diving off an icy cliff. Perhaps to the tune of How Do You Keep the Music 
Playing? – as sung by Walsh.
