<https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2016/dec/12/the-daily-mails-pathetic-pants-shaming-stunt-on-sam-armytage-demeans-us-all>
 earlier this week.

The online article, published on Sunday, accompanied paparazzi photos of the 
Sunrise presenter out grocery shopping inSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> and made repeated 
references to her “giant granny panties”.

The article was amended on Tuesday to remove all references to Armytage’s 
underwear, and to include a statement apologising “for any distress caused”.

“An earlier version of this story contained critical statements regarding 
Samantha Armytage’s appearance. While the story has since been amended, we 
apologise for any distress caused to Ms Armytage or readers more generally.”

The original headline of the story: “Armytage dares to bare with giant granny 
panties showing a visible line”, had been changed to “Armytage goes solo as she 
heads out on a shopping trip”.


Speculation about the presenter’s love life, however, was consistent across 
both editions.

It is a rare show of contrition from the publication, which makes a habit of 
commenting, often cruelly, on women’s appearances. But it is possible its hand 
was forced, with Armytagedeclining to comment to BuzzFeed Australia 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/ginarushton/people-are-pissed-off-after-a-tv-host-was-shamed-for-wearing?utm_term=.tamoG9gZn#.jv1j6B2za>
 about the story on Monday because it was “with the lawyers”.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Seven’s legal team sent Daily Mail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailymail> editor Luke McIlveen and writer 
Max Margan a three-page letter stating the article was a “gross invasion of her 
privacy”, a view that would be shared by a court in ordering compensation be 
paid for “hurt, distress and humiliation”.

Guardian Australia understands the Daily Mail amended the article because it 
agreed it was inappropriate and the description of Armytage’s underwear should 
not have been published.

Armytage had not referred to the article, or its amendment, on her social 
media presences on Wednesday.

The story drew widespread criticism from social media users, other media and 
Armytage’s fellow television hosts. Lisa Wilkinson, who presents the rival 
breakfast show Today, said the report was “disgusting”.

Has "reporting" really stooped to this level? Disgusting. I feel for you

 the “creep shots” were “the Daily Mail’s latest despicable display of misogyny 
dressed up as celebrity news”, while Wendy Tuohy wrote in the Herald Sun 
<http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/wendy-tuohy/sam-armytage-story-proves-daily-mail-despises-women-writes-wendy-tuohy/news-story/04f5da33bb5b6a2a86c6b276962bc76e>
 the report was proof the publication “despises women”.

Sharing Tuohy’s column, television presenter Rebecca Judd also condemned the 
report <https://www.instagram.com/p/BN6gbGijkdx/>: “It’s a sad state of affairs 
when the Daily Mail ‘journalists’ have become the biggest trolls of all.”

In a show of support for Armytage, social media users tweeted about their own 
embrace of “granny panties”.
