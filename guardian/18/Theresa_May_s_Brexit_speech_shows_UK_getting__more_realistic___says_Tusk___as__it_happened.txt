Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has put out a statement this 
morning saying Theresa May’s speech may send shockwaves through workplaces 
around the country. He said:

The prime minister’s announcement today looks set to send shockwaves around 
factories and shop-floors across the country. Her determination to appease the 
hard right in her party and Ukip by talking tough on immigration is putting 
millions of jobs in jeopardy.

Mrs May must not put party before country today. Trade unions and others have 
clearly outlined how real concerns over the freedom of movement can be 
addressed by sensible labour market safeguards without abandoning the single 
market when we leave the EU.

Out of the single market, possibly out of the customs union, then investment 
in core sectors like car manufacturing, chemicals, aerospace, even food 
manufacturing, will be threatened as companies face hefty on-costs and serious 
disruption to their supply chains.

I urge Mrs May to listen to the anguish of working class communities, not to 
add to it. Trading with nations that will not uphold our labour standards is 
not an acceptable solution – that trade will come with a heavy price tag, 
certain to be paid in the jobs, rights and wages of working people.

The prime minister must pay less heed to the Brexit headbangers around the 
cabinet table and more to the anxiety felt by working people who believe their 
jobs are being held hostage by the extreme nationalist wing of her government.

Inflation up to 1.6%

Inflation has risen to 1.6%, its highest level for more than two years, the 
Press Association reports.

Inflation soared to its highest level in two and a half years last month, as 
air fares rose and the plunge in the pound started to affect food prices.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer price index (CPI) 
measure of inflation hit 1.6%, up from 1.2% in November.

Economists were expecting a rise of 1.4%. 

The move pushed CPI to its highest level since July 2014, when it also reached 
1.6%.

Separate figures for the producer price index (PPI) showed that factory gate 
prices rose 2.7% year-on-year in December, as manufacturers started to pass 
through higher input costs following the collapse of the pound.

ONS head of inflation Mike Prestwood said: “This is the highest CPI has been 
for over two years, though the annual rate remains below the Bank of England’s 
target and low by historical standards.

“Rising air fares and food prices, along with petrol prices falling less than 
last December, all helped to push up the rate of inflation.

“Rising raw material costs also continued to push up the prices of goods 
leaving factories.”

Here is the Office for National Statistics statistical bulletin.

Paul Nuttall, the new Ukip leader, was on the Today programme this morning. He 
refused to rule out standing as a candidate in the byelection in Stoke-on-Trent 
central caused by the resignation of Labour’s Tristram Hunt, saying that this 
was still be discussed in Ukip and that a decision would be taken by the 
weekend.

Nuttall also said he was “massively excited” about Donald Trump being US 
president, because of Trump’s support for a UK-US trade deal, but he mistakenly 
described Trump as a “Anglophobe” when he clearly meant to say “Anglophile”.

Mandelson accuses May of thinking that difficult choices don't exist

Lord Mandelson, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
former business secretary and former European commissioner, was on the Today 
programme this morning talking about Theresa May’s speech. He criticised her 
for refusing to accept that hard choices would have to be made.

This is a prime minister who says that she doesn’t accept that there is a 
difference between a hard and a soft Brexit. I think she is pretending that 
difficult choices that the government has to make simply don’t exist.

If she doesn’t know what a hard Brexit is, let me tell her what it is: it’s 
when UK goods suddenly face tariffs of as much 10% or more in our biggest 
export market.

Unlike the chancellor and many other members of the Cabinet, she wants to take 
Britain fully out of the single market and the customs union, and that is very 
significant.


There are no clicky finger solutions to these issues, but not even to 
acknowledge the difficult choices that have to be made, I think is very 
worrying indeed.

I don’t think she should reveal what her compromised bottom lines are, you 
don’t as a a negotiator do that, but nor do you start by slamming down your red 
lines on the table and say take it or leave it.

Mandelson told the programme that the UK should accept the free movement of EU 
citizens but that “how that principle operates in practice needs to be 
discussed”. Inan article in today’s Guardian  
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/16/theresa-may-brexit-free-movement>
Mandelson goes into this in more detail. He writes:

There are growing calls in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> for movement of labour to be 
reformed.

Already, labour market rules differ across the EU. Welfare entitlements vary. 
In many EU states, if you come you are expected to have a job. And the ability 
to work is not regarded as the same as the right to settle, with all the 
benefits and access to public services that come with it.

May should aim to negotiate arrangements with the EU, combined with changes in 
UK labour market legislation, which give us both continued free trade in Europe 
and greater control over labour mobility and employment rules.

Ironically, what Mandelson is saying about how the implementation of freedom 
of movement rules could be reformed is quite similar to the arguments being 
made in another Guardian column byPaul Mason, a figure who is about as far on 
Labour’s left as Mandelson is on its right. Mason’s column, which is well worth 
reading, is here.

Here is the Press Association story on what the pound has been doing this 
morning ahead of Theresa May’s speech.

The pound is in for a “wild ride” as Theresa May prepares to outline her plans 
for Britain’s divorce from theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

Sterling was trading up against the US dollar ahead of the speech at $1.21, 
but experts put that down to weakness in the US currency rather than underlying 
positive sentiment among traders.

The pound was down slightly against the euro at €1.13 in morning trading. 

Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: “We’re expecting a 
wild ride for the pound today. These gains are largely down to dollar weakness, 
however, as the greenback has suffered a bit of a sell-off overnight and gold 
has risen amid a bid for safer assets ahead of this speech and Donald Trump’s 
inauguration on Friday.”

He added that another reason the pound is not in negative territory is because 
details of Mrs May’s speech that have been made public, such as plans to leave 
the single market and customs union, represent nothing new.

“Traders are waiting for more detail from the PM before making big decisions,” 
Wilson said.

The prime minister is expected to say she does not want an outcome which 
leaves the UK “half-in, half-out” of the European Union.

We are inclined by nature to believe, when things happen, that they are 
inevitable, but they never are and when big political events happen it is 
always worth remembering the alternative histories which are not real but which 
are just as plausible. Today Theresa May will set out the government’s approach 
to Brexit. But if David Cameron had decided to stay on as prime minister after 
the referendum, and had seen off a leadership challenge, his Brexit speech 
today would have been very different. He told MPs after the vote that his 
successor should stick as close as possible to Europe and he would be offering 
“the full Norwegian”. And if Boris Johnson had become prime minister last 
summer he would have put Michael Gove in charge of the Brexit talks and we know 
what would be in his Brexit speech becausehe published it in the Times last 
week. 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/may-must-deliver-full-brexit-not-fake-brexit-hxwxgdm6f>
“When it comes to trade with Europe, a new deal could be simplicity itself,” 
Gove wrote, calling for “full Brexit, not fake Brexit”, and withdrawal from the 
single market and the customs union.

But we didn’t get Cameron or Johnson, we got May, her approach to Brexit is 
unique, and today she will make her fullest statement yet on what it is. It’s a 
speech that could determine British policy for decades.

There has already been quite a lot of briefing about the speech in advance and 
it is much more of a Johnson/Gove speech than a Cameron one. Alternatively, on 
the hard/soft axis (categories that May refuses to accept), it is far closer to 
“nails” than “a baby’s bottom”. Here is the Guardian’s overnight preview story 
fromAnusthka Asthana, the Guardian’s political editor.

The speech is at 11.45am and I will be focusing on it today to the exclusion 
of almost anything else. I will be covering the build-up, reporting the speech 
in detail as it happens, and then bringing you reaction, comment and analysis.

Yesterday the pound fell in advance of May’s speech. This morning it has risen 
slightly against the dollar, suggesting that any reaction to the speech may now 
be priced in.

Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has put out a statement this 
morning saying Theresa May’s speech may send shockwaves through workplaces 
around the country. He said:

The prime minister’s announcement today looks set to send shockwaves around 
factories and shop-floors across the country. Her determination to appease the 
hard right in her party and Ukip by talking tough on immigration is putting 
millions of jobs in jeopardy.

Mrs May must not put party before country today. Trade unions and others have 
clearly outlined how real concerns over the freedom of movement can be 
addressed by sensible labour market safeguards without abandoning the single 
market when we leave the EU.

Out of the single market, possibly out of the customs union, then investment 
in core sectors like car manufacturing, chemicals, aerospace, even food 
manufacturing, will be threatened as companies face hefty on-costs and serious 
disruption to their supply chains.

I urge Mrs May to listen to the anguish of working class communities, not to 
add to it. Trading with nations that will not uphold our labour standards is 
not an acceptable solution – that trade will come with a heavy price tag, 
certain to be paid in the jobs, rights and wages of working people.

The prime minister must pay less heed to the Brexit headbangers around the 
cabinet table and more to the anxiety felt by working people who believe their 
jobs are being held hostage by the extreme nationalist wing of her government.
 
Inflation has risen to 1.6%, its highest level for more than two years, the 
Press Association reports.

Inflation soared to its highest level in two and a half years last month, as 
air fares rose and the plunge in the pound started to affect food prices.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer price index (CPI) 
measure of inflation hit 1.6%, up from 1.2% in November.

Economists were expecting a rise of 1.4%. 

The move pushed CPI to its highest level since July 2014, when it also reached 
1.6%.

Separate figures for the producer price index (PPI) showed that factory gate 
prices rose 2.7% year-on-year in December, as manufacturers started to pass 
through higher input costs following the collapse of the pound.

ONS head of inflation Mike Prestwood said: “This is the highest CPI has been 
for over two years, though the annual rate remains below the Bank of England’s 
target and low by historical standards.

“Rising air fares and food prices, along with petrol prices falling less than 
last December, all helped to push up the rate of inflation.

“Rising raw material costs also continued to push up the prices of goods 
leaving factories.”

Here is the Office for National Statistics statistical bulletin.

Paul Nuttall, the new Ukip leader, was on the Today programme this morning. He 
refused to rule out standing as a candidate in the byelection in Stoke-on-Trent 
central caused by the resignation of Labour’s Tristram Hunt, saying that this 
was still be discussed in Ukip and that a decision would be taken by the 
weekend.

Nuttall also said he was “massively excited” about Donald Trump being US 
president, because of Trump’s support for a UK-US trade deal, but he mistakenly 
described Trump as a “Anglophobe” when he clearly meant to say “Anglophile”.

Lord Mandelson, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
former business secretary and former European commissioner, was on the Today 
programme this morning talking about Theresa May’s speech. He criticised her 
for refusing to accept that hard choices would have to be made.

This is a prime minister who says that she doesn’t accept that there is a 
difference between a hard and a soft Brexit. I think she is pretending that 
difficult choices that the government has to make simply don’t exist.

If she doesn’t know what a hard Brexit is, let me tell her what it is: it’s 
when UK goods suddenly face tariffs of as much 10% or more in our biggest 
export market.

Unlike the chancellor and many other members of the Cabinet, she wants to take 
Britain fully out of the single market and the customs union, and that is very 
significant.


There are no clicky finger solutions to these issues, but not even to 
acknowledge the difficult choices that have to be made, I think is very 
worrying indeed.

I don’t think she should reveal what her compromised bottom lines are, you 
don’t as a a negotiator do that, but nor do you start by slamming down your red 
lines on the table and say take it or leave it.

Mandelson told the programme that the UK should accept the free movement of EU 
citizens but that “how that principle operates in practice needs to be 
discussed”. Inan article in today’s Guardian  
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/16/theresa-may-brexit-free-movement>
Mandelson goes into this in more detail. He writes:

There are growing calls in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> for movement of labour to be 
reformed.

Already, labour market rules differ across the EU. Welfare entitlements vary. 
In many EU states, if you come you are expected to have a job. And the ability 
to work is not regarded as the same as the right to settle, with all the 
benefits and access to public services that come with it.

May should aim to negotiate arrangements with the EU, combined with changes in 
UK labour market legislation, which give us both continued free trade in Europe 
and greater control over labour mobility and employment rules.

Ironically, what Mandelson is saying about how the implementation of freedom 
of movement rules could be reformed is quite similar to the arguments being 
made in another Guardian column byPaul Mason, a figure who is about as far on 
Labour’s left as Mandelson is on its right. Mason’s column, which is well worth 
reading, is here.

Here is the Press Association story on what the pound has been doing this 
morning ahead of Theresa May’s speech.

The pound is in for a “wild ride” as Theresa May prepares to outline her plans 
for Britain’s divorce from theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

Sterling was trading up against the US dollar ahead of the speech at $1.21, 
but experts put that down to weakness in the US currency rather than underlying 
positive sentiment among traders.

The pound was down slightly against the euro at €1.13 in morning trading. 

Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: “We’re expecting a 
wild ride for the pound today. These gains are largely down to dollar weakness, 
however, as the greenback has suffered a bit of a sell-off overnight and gold 
has risen amid a bid for safer assets ahead of this speech and Donald Trump’s 
inauguration on Friday.”

He added that another reason the pound is not in negative territory is because 
details of Mrs May’s speech that have been made public, such as plans to leave 
the single market and customs union, represent nothing new.

“Traders are waiting for more detail from the PM before making big decisions,” 
Wilson said.

The prime minister is expected to say she does not want an outcome which 
leaves the UK “half-in, half-out” of the European Union.
 
We are inclined by nature to believe, when things happen, that they are 
inevitable, but they never are and when big political events happen it is 
always worth remembering the alternative histories which are not real but which 
are just as plausible. Today Theresa May will set out the government’s approach 
to Brexit. But if David Cameron had decided to stay on as prime minister after 
the referendum, and had seen off a leadership challenge, his Brexit speech 
today would have been very different. He told MPs after the vote that his 
successor should stick as close as possible to Europe and he would be offering 
“the full Norwegian”. And if Boris Johnson had become prime minister last 
summer he would have put Michael Gove in charge of the Brexit talks and we know 
what would be in his Brexit speech becausehe published it in the Times last 
week. 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/may-must-deliver-full-brexit-not-fake-brexit-hxwxgdm6f>
“When it comes to trade with Europe, a new deal could be simplicity itself,” 
Gove wrote, calling for “full Brexit, not fake Brexit”, and withdrawal from the 
single market and the customs union.

But we didn’t get Cameron or Johnson, we got May, her approach to Brexit is 
unique, and today she will make her fullest statement yet on what it is. It’s a 
speech that could determine British policy for decades.

There has already been quite a lot of briefing about the speech in advance and 
it is much more of a Johnson/Gove speech than a Cameron one. Alternatively, on 
the hard/soft axis (categories that May refuses to accept), it is far closer to 
“nails” than “a baby’s bottom”. Here is the Guardian’s overnight preview story 
fromAnusthka Asthana, the Guardian’s political editor.

The speech is at 11.45am and I will be focusing on it today to the exclusion 
of almost anything else. I will be covering the build-up, reporting the speech 
in detail as it happens, and then bringing you reaction, comment and analysis.

Yesterday the pound fell in advance of May’s speech. This morning it has risen 
slightly against the dollar, suggesting that any reaction to the speech may now 
be priced in.
