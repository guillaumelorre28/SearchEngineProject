Drexciya – Organic Hydropoly Spores 

Planting: This track alludes to the panspermia hypothesis, that life exists 
throughout the universe and that planets can be “seeded” by meteorites. Some 
believe this the most significant of all gardening events, something that led 
to the very beginning of life on Earth.

Jon Hassell and Brian Eno – Delta Rain Dream 

Irrigation: Water has an essential function in perpetuating plant (and all) 
life. Its availability can determine a successful harvest and good irrigation 
typically doubles yields, a fact not lost on Hassell and Eno here.

Jimmy Cliff – Hello Sunshine

Photosynthesis: Clearly a keen gardener, Cliff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/21/jimmy-cliff-review-joyful-jamboree>
 calls for sunshine in his classic song. Plants use sunlight to make food which 
they use to grow. This means more food for us.

Mileece – Formations 

Growth: The track was composed using generative musical algorithms allowing

would,” toquote <http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5cjw/> the sound artist and 
environmental designer.

The Isley Brothers – Harvest For the World

Cropping: Indicating the huge popularity of gardening, the brothers’ song 
(which hopes for a bumper crop at the end of the season) became a huge hit for
the group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jan/07/10-of-the-best-isley-brothers>
. It just goes to show that although many share their hopes, they’re just not 
prepared to do the necessary groundwork that would generate this kind of yield.
