The British government is facing a new legal challenge over whether it should 
seek to retain membership of the single market during the Brexit process.


Lawyers will argue that June’s referendum asked the public a single question 
over whether the UK should leave the EU, and did not delve into the more 
complex issue of economic access.

The group British Influence will use a judicial review to suggest the 
government could be acting unlawfully if it uses Brexit to also leave the wider 
European Economic Area – through which non-EU countries such as Norway are 
inside the single market.

It is the second legal challenge faced by ministers over the process of 
leaving the EU. The government’s appeal to the recent high court ruling that 
only parliament has the power to formally trigger Brexit

 will be heard next week.

Jonathan Lis, the deputy director of British Influence, said: “The single 
market wasn’t on the ballot paper. To leave it would be devastating for the 
economy, smash our free trading arrangement and put thousands of jobs at risk. 
Why should people not only throw the baby out with the bath water, but the bath 
out of the window?”

His group will claim that Croatia provides an example of a country joining the 
EU and EEA separately, so identifying them as discrete groupings, and will cite 
research by senior academics on the issue.

“This is not an anti-Brexit measure,” he added.

But the government made clear it did not believe any attempt at a legal 
challenge would be successful, with Theresa May’s official spokeswoman 
insisting that Brexit meant leaving both organisations.

“Our position is clear, which is that the UK is only party to the EEA 
agreement in its capacity as an EU member state and once we leave theEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> we will automatically cease to be 
a member of the EEA – that is the legal framework,” she said.

A leading authority on European law also poured cold water on the idea. 
Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council’s legal service, who 
served as official legal counsel on EU treaties, including Maastricht, Nice and 
Lisbon, said after Brexit the UK would not remain in the EEA.

“The UK’s withdrawal from EU will mean an automatic cessation of its 
membership of EEA as an EEA-EU member,” he said. “In order to become an EEA 
member you have either to be an EU member or an EFTA member.”

Non-EU countries have created the European Free Trade Association to promote 
economic ties. Current members are Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and 
Liechtenstein.

The UK was a founding member of EFTA, but left to join the European Community 
in 1973. Norway has warned itcould block any attempt by the UK to rejoin EFTA.

The legal skirmish underscores the mind-boggling complexity of Brexit that 
will dominate the government’s agenda for years to come.

British Influence, which has written to David Davis

suggests the government should not just be focusing on article 50 of the treaty 
on European Union, but on articles 127 and 128 of the EEA agreement.

It says there is no legal consensus that the UK is only “a contracting party 
to the EEA only as a member of the EU. There are numerous reasons why it may be 
a member in its own right: article 127 of the EEA agreement, for example, 
requires members to give 12 months’ notification to leave, without any 
reference to article 50; article 128 states that countries acceding to the EU 
‘may’ apply to join the EEA, but are not compelled to.”

However, the government and Piris both pointed to another article – 126.

May’s spokeswoman said it represented “the first paragraph on membership in 
the EEA agreement – that says that it applies to the territories to which the 
treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the 
conditions laid out under that treaty.

“Clearly, if you are leaving the European Union you are coming out of that so 
it does not apply.”

In theory, the dispute could be resolved by the European court of justice. 
Instead, she said May was focused on getting Britain the best deal and would do 
that.
