Shortly after the opening ceremony of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in 
Cameroon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/20/africa-women-cup-of-nations-cameroon-opening-ceremony-football>
, the hosts declared that when it came to football there was “no distinction” 
in the support given to men and women.

Despite this goal, female players report that as in many areas of life, there 
is still a stark divide in opportunities, and players at the tournament say the 
game is suffering from neglect. Africa’s best women’s team doesn’t have enough 
money for friendlies, and players describe having fought patriarchy at every 
level to get where they are today.


James Meller, from the Right to Dream football academy, based in Ghana, says 
that gender inequality remains magnified in football and that “women’s and 
girls’ football is underinvested in and undervalued at all levels”.

Nigeria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria>, the highest ranked team 
in Africa, “have won the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations nine times, [but] don’t 
even have enough money to play friendlies”, says sports journalist Jessica 
Chisaokwu.

She adds that the Super Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/21/asisat-oshoala-liverpool-ladies-nigeria-wsl-africa>
, as they are known, rely on social media support from their fans “who know 
that the girls don’t get the type of support they should”.

And while President Muhammadu Buhari was one of the fans who offered his 
support on Twitter, in the month leading up to the tournament it emerged that 
the teamcoach, Florence Omagbemi <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37824280>
, had been working without pay for the best part of a year.

More than half of the eight countries which competed in Cameroon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/cameroon> have professional female leagues 
at home, but few sponsorship opportunities mean that most players have to 
balance the game with other work commitments.

the only team in Kenya’s new league to offer limited financial support and 
travel costs.

Aluoch, 26, who had a baby as a teenager but took up the sport again in her 
20s, says that playing and having a family is difficult but, like any job, 
“it’s just a matter of how you juggle your time”.

Both players coach young players to stay financially solvent and have come to 
regard football as a calling.

Like the majority of her Malian team-mates, defender Aichata Dounbia is 
enrolled in the army, one of the only institutions in the country that is 
helping women’s football develop.


“There isn’t a sports structure in Mali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mali>,” adds her team-mate Aminata Doucouré, 
21, describing the regimented coaching, training and facilities she has become 
accustomed to while playing in France.

Others face stigma and misogynistic abuse for participating in the game. South 
African defender Nothando Vilakazi wastrolled by people speculating

 about her gender during this summer’s Rio Olympics after a picture of her 
covering her groin went viral. A few months earlier the Nigerian football 
federation blamed the team’s poor performance on “lesbian players 
<http://www.africanews.com/2016/06/14/lesbianism-blamed-for-poor-performance-of-nigeria-s-women-football-team/>
”.

The comments, strongly condemned by Fifa, were indicative of a “deeply 
homophobic” nation, says Nigerian commentator Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani, adding 
that it isn’t uncommon to see “silly stories about women getting cancer because 
of balls hitting their breasts”.

In countries such as Ghana, which fielded one of the best teams in the 
tournament, women still face discrimination in many aspects of society. “By the 
time a girl is 12, she is expected to concentrate on her role within the 
family, looking after siblings and contributing to the running of the 
household,” says Meller, whose academy helps develop the potential of talented 
west African children.

A number of players at the tournament described having to hide playing 
football from their families when they were younger. Dounbia, 31, used to play 
secretly with the boys after her uncle forbade her from joining in.

Kenyan captain Wendy Achieng, 23, was told that “football was a men’s game. 
They wanted me to stop and get a job, but then they realised I had the passion 
and accepted it,” she says.

Dounbia says things have changed dramatically in Mali since she was young. 
“Before a woman’s place was in the home … now people are more understanding 
that you can play football and have a family at the same time.”


“Culturally it’s not a problem to play football,” says Cameroon national 
player Ngo Mback Batoum. “My family and people in my region are very proud of 
me.”

The striker has also been promoting football as a way of preventing early 
marriage amongCameroonian schoolgirls

Vilakazi, the player trolled over her gender, agrees that her sport doesn’t 
get the recognition or support it deserves but says she has been encouraged by 
pockets of progress at home. These include an initiative by fellow South 
African player Amanda Dlamini,who relinquished the captaincy 
<http://www.southafrica.info/news/sport/football-dlamini-041013.htm#.WDxouDaLTAw>
 in 2013 to set up a football academy for young girls from rural areas.


In Cameroon, Batoum explains that the priority is still for girls to get a 
good education, but people also know that football has the capacity to “change 
a life”. Her government wants one of the legacies of the tournament to be a 
national women’s league to encourage more players to stay in the country.

For some players, such as Gaëlle Deborah Enganamouit, the star striker who is 
making waves in the Swedish league, the lure of playing football in Europe or 
the US will always loom.

Mali’s sports minister, Adoum Garoua, says it can be a challenge to work 
around the schedules of such players but that seeing players from humble 
beginnings make it abroad provides extra impetus for young girls to take up the 
sport. Both of the Malian players say those who “follow the dream” to play in 
Europe will only help insert professionalism into the national game.
