The Australian company said some items in its results had not been finalised, 
including testing and assessment of the goodwill values for impairment of its 
UK business, which it bought from Quindell last year. In Augustthe Serious 
Fraud Office announced it was investigating Quindell

 over its business and accounting practices.

Slater & Gordon also faces an inquiry by Australian regulators over its 
accounting practices.In November it lost half its stock market value

single session after news that the UK government planned to limit the number of 
personal injury claims. The proposals were announced unexpectedly by George 
Osborne, the chancellor, in last yearâ€™s autumn statement.

Shares in the group, which traded around AUS$8 a share a year ago on the 
Australian Securities Exchange, were suspended at AUS$0.83.

Slater & Gordon said it thought it was appropriate to enter into voluntary 
suspension so that it could better manage its disclosure obligations and to 
avoid trades in its shares happening on a basis that was not reasonably 
informed. It expects trading in its shares to recommence by Monday.
