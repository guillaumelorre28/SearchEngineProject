It is understood that Unilever has halted deliveries to Tesco after a dispute 
over price, and several famous brands arecurrently unavailable from the 
supermarket chain’s website

The food, toiletries and household goods supplier has been attempting to raise 
prices across a wide range of goods by about 10%, blaming the falling value of 
the pound against the euro and the dollar.

The row will be embarrassing for the supermarket’s chief executive, Dave 
Lewis, who previously held a senior role at Unilever. It also comes afterTesco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco> made sweeping changes to the way 
its buyers deal with suppliers after strong criticism from the industry 
watchdog, the Grocery Code Adjudicator.

A Tesco spokesperson said: “We are experiencing availability issues on a 
number of Unilever products. We always work to ensure customers get the best 
possible prices and we hope to have this issue resolved soon.”

Unilever is one of the UK’s biggest suppliers of branded foods and household 
goods and the dispute could have serious consequences for both sides.

In different areas of the country a number of Unilever brands have sold out. 
They include Persil, Surf, Dove, Comfort, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, Elmlea, 
Colman’s, Helmann’s, Marmite, Knorr, Bertolli, Flora, Comfort and Pot Noodle.

It is understood that Unilever has approached a number of the major retailers 
in an attempt to increase prices. One well-informed source said: “Unilever is 
using Brexit as an excuse to raise prices, even on products that are made in 
the UK.”

Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said Unilever’s attempt to 
increase prices was not surprising and reflected attempts by a large number of 
supermarket suppliers to offset cost increases. He suggested there were likely 
to be more disputes between retailers and suppliers.

“A lot of suppliers are seeking to pass on price increases to retailers but in 
the current environment retailers are increasingly reluctant to take it. They 
want to keep prices as low as they can to increase their affordability against 
the competition.”

increasingly fragile since the upheaval caused by the EU referendum result

Ged Futter, a retail consultant at IR Solutions, which advises suppliers on 
how to negotiate with retailers, said the fall in the value of the pound was 
having a huge impact on those importing goods. “A lot of suppliers have seen 
costs go up significantly because of currency. Some are covered until the end 
of the year but not beyond. Retailers are saying they can’t pass cost increases 
on to their shoppers but that has to happen, or they are not going to have any 
suppliers left,” he said.

Details of the standoff between Tesco and Unilever emerged just a few hours 
after Justin King, a former boss of Sainsbury’s, warned that supermarkets could 
not absorb cost increases caused by the falling pound and that price rises were 
inevitable.

Serious disputes over price are not that unusual in the grocery sector. 
Roberts said it was usually the retailer who ended up backing down because 
shoppers demanded certain brands.

In 2011, Tesco refused to stock a number of Premier Foods’ brands, including 
Oxo and Ambrosia, after the supplier tried to pass on a 14% increase in costs. 
The two fell out the previous year over Hovis when Premier, citing soaring 
wheat prices, tried to raise the price of its loaves.

Unilever declined to comment on the dispute with Tesco.
