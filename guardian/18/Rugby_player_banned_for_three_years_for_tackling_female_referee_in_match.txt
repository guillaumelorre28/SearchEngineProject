Bruno Andres Doglioli violently barged over Maria Beatrice Benvenuti from 
behind during a game between Vicenza and Valsugana. Benvenuti gave Doglioli a 
yellow card for the incident. The 23-year-old referee was able to finish the 
match but was later taken to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with 
whiplash.

The Italian Rugby Federation has given Doglioli a three-year ban, its heaviest 
punishment in the last 20 years. It is unlikely the 33-year-old will play again 
professionally. Vicenza had already suspended the player.

“It’s an incident for which there is no justification whatsoever,” the club 
said in a statement. “It was a momentary loss of control by the player who, in 
decades of playing, has always behaved professionally and correctly.

“Bruno Doglioli, aware of the severity of what happened, wants to first of all 
send to referee Maria Beatrice Benvenuti his most sincere regrets. At the same 
time he apologises to his team-mates, members of the club, sponsors and the 
fans for an incident that risks damaging the image of this marvellous sport.”

Benvenuti is a respected referee. She officiated in the women’s sevens 
tournament at the Olympic Games in Rio and also took part in the 2014 Women’s 
World Cup.
