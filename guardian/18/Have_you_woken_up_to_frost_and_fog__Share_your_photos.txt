After a mild Christmas Day, frost and fog have arrived across the UK, adding a 
certain festive touch to the final days of 2016.

 The Met Office said freezing fog had settled in patches of the country and 
poor visibility could persist into Friday afternoon.

If you’ve found yourself taking photos of the spooky fog, or have enjoyed a 
morning walking the dog and / or other animal across a frosty park or field, 
we’d love to see your photos.
