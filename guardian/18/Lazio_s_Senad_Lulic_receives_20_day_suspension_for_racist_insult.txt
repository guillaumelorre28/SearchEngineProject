After the game Lulic said Rüdiger was provoking Lazio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lazio> players and that “two years ago he 
was selling socks and belts in Stuttgart, now he acts like he’s a phenomenon”.

A day after the derby on 4 December, which Roma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roma> won 2-0, Lulic posted on Instagram 
that he responded to a provocation with “another provocation”.

Lulic, who is Bosnian, said: “I come from a country that knows about the 
tragedies caused by ethnic prejudices. That’s why I’m sorry that I got carried 
away by the post-derby tensions and to have expressed myself in an inopportune 
manner.”
