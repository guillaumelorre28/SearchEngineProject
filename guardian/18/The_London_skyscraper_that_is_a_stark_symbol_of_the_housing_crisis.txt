A Russian billionaire whose business partner is a close ally of Vladimir 
Putin, the former chairman of a defunct Nigerian bank and a Kyrgyz vodka tycoon 
appear to be among more than 130 foreign buyers in Britain’s tallest 
residential skyscraper.

Almost two-thirds of homes in the Tower, a 50-storey apartment complex in 
London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>, are in foreign ownership, with 
a quarter held through secretive offshore companies based in tax havens, a 
Guardian investigation has revealed.

The first residents of the landmark development arrived in October 2013, but 
many of the homes are barely occupied, with some residents saying they only use 
them for a fraction of the year.

The revelations about the Tower are likely to be seized on by campaigners and 
politicians as the starkest example yet of the housing crisis gripping the 
capital, in which too many new homes are sold abroad as investments and left 
largely empty while fewer and fewer young people can afford to buy or even rent 
in the city.

of Westminster is ultimately owned by the family of former Russian senator
Andrei Guriev

Palace.

At 23,000sq ft, the Tower penthouse is 24 times larger than the average new 
three-bedroom home in the UK. It was bought in May 2014 but has yet to be lived 
in. As part of a lengthy refurbishment, Guriev is understood to be installing a 
Russian Orthodox chapel that has had to be carried piece by piece up the 
elevators.

Lower down is a £2.7m flat owned by Ebitimi Banigo, a former Nigerian 
government minister. In 2012, Banigo was crowned king of Okpoama, in the 
oil-rich Niger delta, at a ceremony attended by the then president, Goodluck 
Jonathan. In 2005, he was investigated by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial 
Crimes Commission following the collapse of the All States Trust Bank he 
chaired. He was later named in the Nigerian senate for owing the bank 15bn 
naira (£50m). He was not charged with any offence.

Other owners named in Land Registry records include a Kurdish oil magnate, an 
Egyptian snack-food mogul, an Indonesian banker, a Uruguayan football manager 
and a former Formula 1 racing driver. About 131 of the 210 apartments for which 
title deeds were available are in foreign ownership, analysis suggests. Owners 
from Singapore told the Guardian they spend as little as two months a year in 
the flats, which are empty the rest of the time. Meanwhile, town hall records 
show that nobody is registered to vote at 184 of the homes.

The Tower does not have any affordable housing, which has been placed mainly 
at the rear of the larger St George Wharf housing development at Vauxhall 
facing a dual carriageway rather than the river.

The extent of the international selloff emerged after the London mayor, Sadiq 
Khan,pledged to crack down on foreign ownership of new homes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/sadiq-khan-developers-housing-plan-london-mayor-affordable>
, saying he would consider a rule that they must be sold to UK residents only 
for the first six months of marketing.

“There is no point in building homes if they are bought by investors in the 
Middle East and Asia,” he said earlier this month. “I don’t want homes being 
left empty.”

The prime minister, David Cameron, has also complained about the sale of 
high-value properties in London to people overseas through anonymous shell 
companies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/11/fight-against-corruption-begins-with-political-will>
 and announced that such companies will in future be obliged to declare their 
true beneficial owners.

At least 31 of the apartments have been sold to buyers in the far east markets 
of Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and China; 15 were sold to Saudi Arabia and 
the United Arab Emirates; and others were sold to buyers in Russia, India, 
Iraq, Qatar and Switzerland. About 15 more appear to have been sold to foreign 
buyers from China, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Nigeria.

A spokesman for the developer St George said: “Although some homes in the 
Tower have overseas owners, it is wrong to suggest that foreign owners dominate 
the London market. Savills estimated that in 2013-14, non-resident overseas 
investors accounted for just 7% of the London residential market.”

The developer said 30% of the overall St George Wharf development is 
affordable housing, with 389 units built in neighbouring blocks. He added: “The 
range of facilities in the Tower, from a concierge to a spa and gym, appeal to 
all buyers – UK as well as international.”

Forbes magazine estimates Guriev is worth more than $4bn (£2.7bn) and he 
shares ownership of PhosAgro, Europe’s largest producer of phosphate 
fertiliser, with Vladimir Litvinenko, a campaign manager for Russia’s 
president. Guriev appears to have bought the property through a British Virgin 
Islands company, Arabella Properties. His ownership of the penthouse has been 
kept such a closely guarded secret that even the building’s managers did not 
know who owned it. The BVI company that formally owns Guriev’s penthouse gives 
as its address the Jersey office of Opus Private, a firm of advisers promising 
a service that “exploits every legitimate opportunity to protect and preserve 
family wealth”.

The Guardian approached Guriev’s London lawyer, his family spokesman and his 
company spokesman, but all declined to comment or to confirm or deny the family 
ownership.

Guriev was last year revealed as the owner of Witanhurst in Highgate, where he 
has built a 40,000sq ft basement with swimming pool, cinema, gym, staff 
quarters and parking for 25 cars.

The profile of the Tower’s owners is set to raise questions over how far UK 
residents, facing a housing crisis, will benefit from the neighbouring Nine 
Elms development where 20,000 mostly luxury high-rise apartments are being 
built in what has been dubbed “Dubai-on-Thames”.

Title deeds for the Tower suggest that in 2014, Vitaly Orlov, a Russian 
fishing tycoon based in Hong Kong, bought the whole of the 39th floor for £13m. 
Orlov’s Ocean Trawlers company is the world’s largest supplier of cod and 
haddock but has this year been accused by Greenpeace of threatening pristine 
Arctic ecosystems by fishing further north in theBarents Sea as the ice 
retreats amid global warming 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/28/arctic-sea-ice-record-low-winter>
.

Orlov declined to comment, saying through a spokesman that he was “not 
interested in sharing his private sphere with the general public”. The Barents 
Sea fishery “has been independently certified to the MSC standard … a 
well-established approach based on the best available science,” the spokesman 
said.

Another named owner is Sharshenbek Abdykerimov, a former MP and powerful 
businessman in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan. Abdykerimov owns the 
bestselling Ayu vodka brand as well as a conglomerate of other businesses, and 
he was recently elected as chairman of the country’s national Olympic 
committee. In 2013, he co-founded the pro-government Kyrgyzstan party.
