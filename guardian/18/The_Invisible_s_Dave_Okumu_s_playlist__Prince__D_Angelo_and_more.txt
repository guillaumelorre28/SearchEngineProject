The Internet – Get Away

I love everything about this track – the harmonic progression, the vocal 
delivery, the tone, the sludge, swagger and rhythm. Hits me in all the right 
places. Rhythmically, the feel is reminiscent ofKendrick’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/23/kendrick-lamar-review-a-blistering-performance-charged-with-complex-narratives>
 Recipe. I’m obsessed with that beat and I can tell you it’s no mean feat 
capturing its essence. I would urge everyone to have a go. The right rhythms 
are so good for the soul.

D’Angelo – Charade

He’s channelling on this one, no doubt. D’Angelo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/22/dangelo-review-steamy-soul-showbiz-touches-sublime>
 has always been a profound inspiration for me. Encountering Voodoo was a 
completely formative experience. I love hearing music that is so steeped in its 
ancestry yet ultimately so liberated. That’s how I want to exist on this 
planet. I first heard this track live before the album was out and it felt 
magnificent to my ears and spirit. I love the fact that he changed the lyrics 
so that he could comment on current events in the US.

Prince – If I Was Your Girlfriend

I’m not sure I would be a musician were it not for Prince 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/prince-final-days-death-percocet>
. Sign o’ the Times was the first album I ever bought. That record transformed 
me and set me on a path that I have continued to follow to this day. Along with 
many others, I’ve felt overwhelmed in the wake of his death and have sought 
comfort in his music. This track has astonished me for so many years and it 
still hits me so hard. The production, the imagination, the lyrics, the craft, 
the performance, the depth – I defy anyone not to recognise its quality and 
value.

Irma Thomas – Ruler of My Heart

This must surely be one of the most romantic pieces of music ever created. 
“Ruler of my heart, lover of my soul, where can you be? I wait patiently.” Say 
no more.

Ruby Hughes and Joseph Middleton – Abendstern (Schubert) from Nocturnal 
Variations

Here’s one from the future Mrs O’s debut recording. This entire album is a 
thing of transcendent beauty and this piece one of many highlights. As the 
harmony seemingly vacillates between major and minor, you feel transported into 
the heart of the vulnerability of the human experience. It’s an evocation of 
loneliness, intimacy and longing handled so delicately and majestically by two 
of my favourite musicians.
