The xx <https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-xx> – I See You

Perhaps it’s their very lack of demonstrativeness that has made the xx so 
popular – they are a backdrop on to which listeners can project whatever they 
want. A gap of more than five years since their last record has done little to 
blunt their appeal, and their third album finds them foregrounding Jamie xx’s 
status as one of dance music’s more unusual sonic architects and backgrounding 
the spectral, downbeat elements of their first two.

Austra – Future Politics

Obviously, you wouldn’t expect anything described as a “recording project” 
rather than a “pop group” to release anything so mundane as a collection of 
songs. And so the third release fromKatie Stelmanis and co 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/17/austras-katie-stelmanis-on-those-difficult-high-cs>
 turns out to be “a commitment to replace the approaching dystopia … It’s about 
reaching beyond boundaries, in every single field.” Stelmanis might have 
intended to reconfigure political thought, but she managed to write some 
memorable and magical songs along the way.

Ty Segall <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ty-segall> - Ty Segall

Trying to make sense of the San Franscisco garage punk hero’s discography is 
like trying to count the spots on a cheetah. While it sprints. No matter how 
prolific he is – as well as his solo career, he’s made records with nine other 
outfits – he keeps the quality control high. His self-titled ninth album is as 
fuzzy, gnarly, ugly – and tuneful – as the rest of his catalogue. One to 
treasure.

When the Australian rapper released her first album in 2014, she seemed like 
another aspiring star whose moment had passed before it had arrived. How wrong 
that assessment was. The single Fancy gave her a worldwide smash, and she 
became the centre of arow over cultural appropriation

Wiley <https://www.theguardian.com/music/wiley> – Godfather

Skepta <https://www.theguardian.com/music/skepta>’s had the headlines for the 
last year or so, but Wiley is the MC the grime stars pay homage to. This album 
was meant to be released last October, and though it’s officially due this 
month, those of a betting nature might want to slip a fiver on it coming out 
later in the year. It would be a shame if they collected on their bets though, 
because Wiley deserves to be in a position to capitalise on grime’s resurgence.

Over 2,000 artists feature in 300 events, filling Glasgow with music and 
dancing in the dark days of late January and early February. A hugely varied 
programme features folk, world, roots, blues and all the stuff in between, with 
Americana strongly represented this year, including Mary Chapin Carpenter and 
JohnnySwim (Donna Summer’s daughter Amanda Sudano’s band). Laura Marling opens 
the festival with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra to perform new orchestral 
arrangements of her music. Other highlights include the 81-year-old folk legend 
Shirley Collins performing from Lodestar, her first album in 30 years, and 
Scotland’s ownEvelyn Glennie

emerge this new year comes from production mastermindDiplo

that will have those over 30 with their teeth on edge.

Sampha – Process

Sampha Sisay <http://sampha.com/> has been a familiar figure in R&B and 
hip-hop for several years, as one of those people whose names pop up with the 
word “featuring” before it (he’s worked with Kanye West, Drake, Solange, SBTRKT 
and Jessie Ware, among many others). His solo debut, in which the death of his 
mother is a recurrent theme, is a vulnerable record, not just emotionally but 
musically. Its sound is intimate, despite the power of his voice, which sits 
front and centre on what looks set to be one of the year’s most striking debuts.

The California pop punks will be sneered at by purists as long as there are

point, their live show – as much Crackerjack as the Clash – is twice as much 
fun as you’ll have watching the kind of bands who talk in interviews about not 
selling out.

50 Song Memoir

It’s 18 years since Stephin Merritt issued 69 Love Songs, one of pop’s most 
audacious conceptual conceits. To mark him turning 50, he has revisited the 
multi-album idea, with a five-disc set containing a song for each of the years 
of his life. Could How I Failed Ethics (for 1986) really be about a university 
exam? Never mind that: in the track for 1990, he may have created the most 
universal memory prompt for anyone in their early 20s at that time – Dreaming 
in Tetris.

Rag’n’Bone Man – Human

Rory Graham, AKA Rag’n’Bone Man, first gained a reputation singing the blues 
over hip-hop beats, and became a slow-burning overnight sensation last year, 
when his single Human became a massive hit across Europe, and then when he 
picked up the Brits critics’ choice award in December. Some of the rough edges 
appear to have been sanded off in the process – these days he’s writing with 
seasoned hitmakers, rather than revamping House of the Rising Sun – but his 
debut album, also called Human, should make it clear whether he’s going to be 
living with one foot in the door and the other in the gutter, or whether he’s 
heading full pelt for the mainstream.

No one has ever made unlimited sex, unlimited drugs and having your every whim

world’s biggest pop stars. (Perhaps there is a larger than suspected audience

C2C festival <http://www.c2c-countrytocountry.com/>

Each year the Country to Country festival seems to get a little bigger, and 
this year its three days see it operating in a Reading/Leeds festival fashion, 
with the acts spending the weekend shuttling between London, Glasgow and Dublin 
to appear across a long weekend in all three cities. This year’s headliners –
Brad Paisley <http://www.bradpaisley.com/>, Reba McEntire <http://reba.com/> 
and theZac Brown Band 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/29/zac-brown-band-prove-country-free-for-all>
 – are maybe not the very strongest, but it’s still the UK’s leading 
celebration of country.
• O2 Arena, London, Clyde Auditorium, Glasgow, and 3Arena, Dublin, 10-12 March.

Guitar legend John McLaughlin

’s powers seem undimmed in his 70s – the same raw blues sound, fuzz-toned 
avant-rock and violin-like lyrical playing still work their forceful magic. 
McLaughlin headlines a birthday celebration of British jazz mag Jazzwise on 13 
and 14 March. The jazz/rap saxistSoweto Kinch

Craig David <https://www.theguardian.com/music/craig-david>

The almost universal goodwill he seems to engender has seen Craig David’s 
comeback make him bigger than ever, with Mobo award wins followed by an arena 
tour that sees him booking two nights at the O2. That’s 40,000 tickets, and if 
you had told us two years ago he’d be playing to that many people we’d have 
laughed in your face. What goes around has come around for a man who simply 
seems uncomplicatedly nice.
• At Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff 
<http://www.livenation.co.uk/show/886102/craig-david/cardiff/2017-03-16/en>, 16 
March. Thentouring <http://www.craigdavid.com/followingmyintuition/> until 17 
April.

Take That

Now down to a threesome – the two who weren’t avoiding taxes are no longer 
with them – the That set aboutearning back the £20m they had to pay to HMRC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2016/jun/13/take-that-tax-avoidance-celebrities-reimburse-hmrc>
 last summer with a new album, Wonderland, followed by a sold-out early summer 
arena tour that’s going to have them rolling in banknotes in time for their 
holidays. Expect slick, sleek grown-up pop from album and tour alike.
• Wonderland is released on 17 March (Polydor). Tour begins 
<http://takethat.com/live/> at Birmingham Genting Arena on 5 May.

Ghost

How anyone could dislike a band whose members all claim to be called Nameless 
Ghoul is beyond us.These Swedes <http://ghost-official.com/> might sport corpse 
paint and celebrate the occult, but they are far from the Scandinavian black 
metal stereotype, coming closer to a kind of swirling, metallic psychedelia. 
Think of them as halfway between Goat and Darkthrone.
• UEA, Norwich <https://uealcr.ticketabc.com/events/ghost-3/>, 24 March. Then 
touring <http://ghost-official.com/stream/#tour> until 2 April.

The Jesus and Mary Chain  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jesus-and-mary-chain>

It’s almost two decades since the Jesus and Mary Chain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jesus-and-mary-chain> released an album, but 
don’t expect the Reid brothers to be out of practice. Since 2007 they’ve been 
playing blistering live shows, including recent outings in honour of their 
classic debut, Psychocandy. Hopefully, they’ll conjure that record’s scuzzy 
intensity, while producer Youth should bring a modern sheen to proceedings.
