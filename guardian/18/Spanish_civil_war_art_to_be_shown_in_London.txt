An exhibition coming to London in January will attempt to recreate the impact 
of the Spanish pavilion of 1937, a little gallery built as cheaply as possible 
at the Paris International Exposition by Spain’s republican government at the 
height of the civil war.

The fame of the pavilion, which showcased the country’s radical leftwing 
artists and the horrors that were happening to its people, was almost entirely 
retrospective. Few critics who visited the exhibition even mentioned it.

It opened late and stood literally in the shadow of two of the biggest 
pavilions at the fair: one built by Russia and, directly opposite, another 
built by Germany, each topped with a gigantic symbolic sculpture.

At the end of the fair, the organisers jointly awarded the prize for best 
pavilion to those two hulking monuments to totalitarian politics and art, while 
the young Spanish architects, Josep Lluís Sert and Luis Lacasa, fled into exile.

Spain’s pavilion presented Alexander Calder’s deadly sculpture Mercury 
Fountain, then displayed in the open air, but now encased in glass and 
maintained by specialist conservators wearing hazard suitsat the Fundació Joan 
Miró in Barcelona 
<http://www.fmirobcn.org/col-leccio/catalog-works/11303/mercury-fountain>. 

It also unveiled extraordinary works by two of the most famous artists of the 
day.

One was Pablo Picasso’s Guernica, a howl of rage at the virtual obliteration 
of a small Spanish town by German bombing. He made the painting in his studio, 
but finished it on site, where, in one version of a famous story, a workman 
from the German pavilion spotted him and asked if it was his work. “No, yours,” 
Picasso retorted. The painting went on to become one of the most famous works 
of art of the 20th century.

truth about war

The other was The Reaper 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/reaper-miros-civil-war-protest>, 
a towering mural painted directly on to the stairwell wall by Joan Miró, which 
has not been seen since the pavilion was demolished. Although it could have 
been cut free and salvaged by some canny dealer, it may have been broken up 
with the rubble from the pavilion.

Miró’s grandson, Joan Punyet Miró, still hopes his grandfather’s work may 
resurface one day. The painting, exhibited in a pavilion that also highlighted 
the folk art and customs of the people, was personal and political to Miró, he 
said. “El Segador [The Reaper] reflected the pain, suffering and revolutionary 
angst of the Catalan people, on seeing how their identity, their language and 
their culture risked being engulfed by a nationalist victory.”

Barcelona’s Mayoral gallery is bringing the exhibition about the pavilion to 
Duke Street <http://www.galeriamayoral.com/en/Contacte/> in London from 18 
January, and has attempted to recreate Miró’s lost painting – with one major 
problem.

While Guernica was painted in grey, white and black, The Reaper is assumed to 
have blazed with Miró’s trademark crimsons and yellows – but there is no colour 
photograph of the original. The work has therefore been recreated by scanning, 
enlarging and stitching together the best surviving images of it, in black and 
white. It is huge, but slightly under the original height of more than 5 metres 
because of space restrictions.

The exhibition will also show revolutionary posters and propaganda materials 
displayed in the 1937 pavilion, plus original posters and programmes for the 
fair, and drawings by many of the artists.

The pavilion itself was recreated in Barcelona after the event and is now a 
library of Spanish civil war material.

“For many of us people born in the 50s and 60s, the pavilion continues to have 
a very special meaning,” Punyet Miró said. “We lived during the latter years of 
the dictatorship, the transition period and the arrival of democracy.”

Despite Spanish and foreign scholars studying the pavilion in minute detail, 
he said, there was more to discover. “There are still mysteries to be 
uncovered, like where is Miró’s work, The Reaper, still missing today?”
