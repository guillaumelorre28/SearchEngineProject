The destruction in 1972 of Les Halles, the market described by Zola as “the 
belly of Paris”, was an act of sabotage against the city. It was “the most 
violent act ever committed against the heritage of Paris,” according to 
historian Donato Severo – strong wordsgiven what Haussmann did 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/31/story-cities-12-paris-baron-haussmann-france-urban-planner-napoleon>
 a century earlier. In its place was built a transport and shopping complex, 
nearly universally reviled for its mean spirit.

Now, at last, a new vast canopy is being installed over the site – a flowing 
glass roof that aims to wipe out the bad memory of the intervening 44 years. 
Mayor Anne Hidalgo says it will become once again “the beating heart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/paris-hopes-1bn-revamp-of-les-halles-can-become-citys-beating-heart>
” of Paris.

But many cities were not so lucky, and Les Halles not the only great urban 
structure lost to greed, tastes or bad planning. Nor, it seems, have we learned 
our lessons.

In the US, perhaps the closest parallel to Les Halles is Pennsylvania Station 
<http://www.treehugger.com/infrastructure/why-not-rebuild-new-yorks-pennsylvania-station-way-it-was.html>
, theMcKim, Mead and White <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKim,_Mead_%26_White>
 masterpiece that was demolished and replaced by the execrable Penn Station. A 
classic of Beaux-Arts design and one of the architectural jewels of the city, 
its amputation led to the start of the architectural preservation movement in 
America.

Of the two buildings, before and after, architecture critic Vince Scully 
noted: “One entered the city like a god; one scuttles in now like a rat.” 
Interestingly, one of the proposals for its replacement, from Richard Cameron 
and James Grimes of design firm Atelier & Co, proposes rebuilding it from the 
original plans, using 3D printing technology to reproduce all of the detailed 
design elements.

 Brighton’s neglected West Pier has fallen victim to numerous fires, and the 
salty sea below. Photograph: betty finney / Alamy/Alamy 
Built in the 1860s, this cast-iron pier was 340 metres of promenade and 
pavilion. Despite many attempts to save the Victorian marvel, the West Pier 
closed in 1975 and suffered a succession of calamities: part of it fell into 
the sea in 2002, and the rest caught fire a year later, leaving just the 
skeletal remains to further degrade with each passing storm.

Seaside piers may have originated in Britain, but the phenomenon spread around 
the world, from Atlantic City to Sydney, and Britain’s National Pier society 
calls them “a powerful reminder of the achievements of Victorian engineers and 
entrepreneurs”. But today, in its place, the West Pier Trust is building a 
vertical pier, a162m spike

 of a tower with a glass-enclosed sky bar – evidence that changing tastes are 
as much a factor in the loss of our heritage as greed or stupidity.

Due in part to its architectural intimacy and quirky field shape, Ebbets Field 
was heralded as “the greatest ballpark ever”. But Brooklyn’s favourite baseball 
stadium was smack in the middle of the borough; it was too small; and most 
importantly, in the dawn of the automobile era, it had no parking space.

Its owner, Walter O’Malley, got into a fight with infamous New York planner 
Robert Moses about where its replacement might be, after which O’Malley simply 
picked up his team – the Dodgers – and moved them to Los Angeles. Frank Sinatra 
sang about it: “Now the children try to find it / And they can’t believe their 
eyes / For the old team just isn’t playing / And the new team hardly tries.” 
Baseball great Duke Snider said: “When they tore down Ebbets Field, they tore 
down a little piece of me.”

Old Beijing was a patchwork of neighbourhoods made up of courtyard houses on 
narrow lanes known ashutongs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jul/01/beijing-motorbike-tour>. This 
pattern dated back to the 13th century, and by the late 20th century some 
hutongs hadn’t greatly progressed: many lacked toilets, central heating and 
were considered slums by a China newly in thrall to the modern world. As much 
as 90% of these efficient, dense, self-sufficient neighbourhoods have been 
demolished. Those that remain are tourist attractions.

 Like many brutalist structures, the administrative building was deemed an 
eyesore. Photograph: Mike Groll/AP 
Paul Rudolph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County_Government_Center>’s 
administrative building was called “rigorous and abstract” by some, and a 
“monstrosity” by others. The brutalist structure was hard to love, and even 
harder to maintain – with 87 roofs, most of which leaked – but it was 
considered an important example of midcentury modern architecture. The American 
architect’s houses were too small, his schools too open and naturally 
ventilated, and his bigger buildings were too expensive to maintain and heat. 
Brutalist building are under threat everywhere, and it’s not just a few that 
are being lost, but an entire legacy.

 Frank Lloyd Wright’s Larking Building. A parking lot now stands in its place. 
Photograph: Granger, NYC/Alamy Stock Photo 
Many great buildings have been lost for many different reasons, but few for no 
good reason at all. Frank Lloyd Wright’s Larkin building was one of those. The 
five-storey atrium building for a former soap company was the first 
air-conditioned office building in the world, and redesigned the way peopled 
worked – with four levels of employees looking down on the company’s executives 
in the atrium below.

As one architect noted while trying to save it: “The Larkin Building set a 
precedent for many an office building we admire today and should be regarded 
not as an outmoded utilitarian structure but as a monument, if not to Mr 
Wright’s creative imagination, to the inventiveness of American design.”

After the Larkin company closed, the new owner wanted to build a truck stop. 
The building was razed to the ground. But the truck stop was never built, and 
the site has been a parking lot ever since.

This oddball of a building was known to very few until the internet discovered 
it and people wondered: how could they take that down? In fact, libraries with 
high stacks and skylit roofs were standard in the 19th century; perhaps the 
best is Trinity College in Dublin. But Cincinnati’s versionsoared higher 
<http://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/15-gorgeous-photos-of-the-old-cincinnati-library#.mgyaZRQdDX>
, with five storeys of books piled on top of one another, surrounding a skylit 
atrium and reading room. All this was lost when low ceilings and electric 
lighting became the desired design for libraries.

Mitchell Park Domes, Milwaukee

Milwaukee County, Inc 
Everything is political in America, including heritage landscapes. The 
Mitchell Park Domes – three modernist concrete, steel and glass conservatories 
that once featured birds and thousands of plant species – are now under threat 
from politicians who object to spending money to fix and maintain them.

The domes have become a political football in the general election, with 
Republican county executive Chris Abele justifying their removal: “When the 
Domes replaced the Victorian conservatory that was there before, I’m sure there 
were plenty of people who bemoaned the loss of the Victorian conservatory and 
saw these new, modern McDonald’s-y domes as, oh, it was heresy”. As we tell our 
kids, two wrongs don’t make a right.

western and Japanese design, where Mad Men modernism met traditional craft and 
colour in a “perfect combination of wood, paper screens and pendant lights”. 
Built in advance of Tokyo’s 1964 Olympics, the Okura is now beingdemolished
