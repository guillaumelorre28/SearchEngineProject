Our Happiness is Guaranteed 

From Janet Weiss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/10/sleater-kinney-indie-trio-reunion-interview>
’s opening salvo to the first action-painting splatter of Sam Coomes’s keyboard 
on this track Our Happiness is Guaranteed, the album Featuring Birds is Quasi 
at their peak, melding jams-kicking rock’n’roll, punk action, and chord shifts 
that feel like the change of a season.

Birds

Indie rock had seen power duos before: Guv’ner, Royal Trux, Buckingham-Nicks, 
the Carpenters – but they’d never sounded like Quasi and the tracks in their 
Field Studies album positively glow.

It’s Hard to Turn Me On 

How can songs about anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure, feel so 
good? Mixing uppers and downers isn’t usually advised, but Weiss and Coomes use 
the device to make a musical space that feels unique to Quasi.

Smile 

Weiss and Coomes travel backwards through the backwoods of AM pop and Pebbles 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKVHK8oIuIY> psych to create a new form: 
bar-room baroque. Smile brings honey-golden multi-tracked vocals and some of 
the bleakest, black-eyed, black-hearted lyrics ever put to paper – all played 
with the kind of ramshackle ease that only comes from weeks of practice, months 
in the van, and serious chops.

The Iron Worm 

On drums and harmonies, Weiss is all low-key Bonham-ie, power with poise. On 
top Coomes’s Roxichord makes you wonder how the electronic harpsichord never 
took off, its low-end crunch with top notes sounding likeRay Manzarek
