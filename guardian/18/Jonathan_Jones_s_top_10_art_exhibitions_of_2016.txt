1.Picasso Sculptures

Museum of Modern Art, New York

This was the best exhibition of the 20th century’s greatest artist that I have 
ever seen. I am so glad to have caught the last few days of the French version 
of a show originally staged by New York’sMuseum of Modern Art 
<https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1505>, for it was a sensual thrill, 
an imaginative helter-skelter, an intellectual blast.

Picasso is the most serious and flippant of artists. You couldn’t escape the 
flippancy here. From carving primitive figures of his girlfriend out of sticks 
and bits of wood on their summer holiday in 1906, to making ababoon 
<http://www.pablopicasso.org/baboon-and-young.jsp> with a toy car for its head 
in 1951, he always seemed to treat sculpture as child’s play. That was probably 
because he thought of painting and drawing as his “true” arts, and 
three-dimensional stuff as a bit of light relief. The freedom this completely 
unpompous attitude unleashed is delirious. Picasso takes a glove, sticks it to 
a relief and covers it in sand. He makes aCubist absinthe glass 
<http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/view?oid=500450>, does a bit of welding, 
whips up a ceramic faun – whatever he feels like, really.

At no point in this exhibition does Picasso look like a professional sculptor. 
What he does look like is the greatest sculptor of the 20th century. His 
readymades are far more poetic than Marcel Duchamp’s, his abstractions more 
exciting than the much narrower art of Giacometti or Brancusi.

The boundless creativity of Picasso’s sculpture is staggering. One of the most 
dazzling rooms in this exhibition brought together gigantic busts of his lover
Marie-Thérèse Walter 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_of_a_Woman_(Marie-Thérèse)#/media/File%3ABust_of_a_Woman_(Marie-Thérèse).jpg>
 that he made at the start of the 1930s. Beginning with a fairly realistic 
portrait, the display revealed him increasing the size of her nose until it 
swallows up her face. Following this metamorphosis in sculpture after sculpture 
was like being inside Picasso’s explosive mind, sensing something of the 
magical way he experienced the world.

Picasso emerged here as the modern world’s true god of sculpture, an artist 
with no respect for what art 'should' be

Why was this my exhibition of the year? Because it did justice to Picasso’s 
genius. It was energetic and copious enough to keep up with him. The array of 
Marie-Thérèse Walter was just one of a series of coups de théâtre in which 
sheer generosity of loans and assiduousness of curating delivered visual 
treats. This exhibition did not settle for half measures. It had to have all 
the visceral, flayed heads ofFernande Olivier 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/picasso-head-of-a-woman-fernande-l01712> 
that he created in 1909, all theabsinthe glasses 
<https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81307> he made at the climax of his 
cubist period five years later, and the startling wood carvings he made when he 
was imagining Les Demoiselles d’Avignon in 1906. The constant revolutionary 
impulse of Picasso has, I suspect, never been more brilliantly revealed. That’s 
why he emerged so authoritatively here as the modern world’s true god of 
sculpture, and an artist for our time with no respect for what art “should” be.

After seeing this I couldn’t take the National Portrait Gallery’s exhibition 
Picasso Portraits 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/04/picasso-portraits-review-national-portrait-gallery-london-exhibition>
 seriously. It was parsimonious by comparison and just did not capture the 
energy that flowed so fast and strong at the Musée Picasso. Britain often 
accepts as “blockbusters” shows that are actually quite skimpy. Picasso 
Sculptures delivered.

Museo del Prado 
The most mind-boggling marvel in this unprecedented, probably unrepeatable 
retrospective of one of the most imaginative artists of all time, at the local 
museum in his home town, was not a psychedelic altarpiece but a display of 
drawings. I had never seen a drawing by this medieval genius before, but the 
research project that made this exhibition possible has identified a 
surprisingly large corpus of sensitive sketches by him. To look at Bosch’s 
drawings, his most intimate, personal works, was to see the world through his 
paranoid, unhappy eyes. The paintings in which he enlarges on his private 
fantasies of monstrosity and mayhem were lent by museums all over the world – a 
fantastic array in every sense. On the day I visited, it was carnival time. 
People were eating chips in the rain. In the art of Bosch the nightmare 
carnival never ends.Read a review

I have a confession. I would rather visit an old museum or stately home and 
explore its shadowy paintings than queue for most hot-ticket exhibitions. That 
is why I absolutely love this one, because it manages to recreate the fun of 
exploring old master collections for yourself, in an exhibition. The curators 
have uncovered a rich haul of half-forgotten works by Caravaggio’s imitators, 
from the bizarre to the brilliant, with Artemisia Gentileschi arguably the 
biggest find of all. Then there’s the man himself. There are only a few 
paintings by Caravaggio here, but they include his sublime visions of the 
Taking of Christ and St John, and cut into your brain with daggers of light and 
threats of shadow.Read a review

The power and the glory of America’s greatest painters fits well into the 
palatial spaces of Burlington House. This exhibition made use of every inch of 
those grand walls to offer an encyclopedic history of one of the most 
ambitious, courageous, liberating adventures in the story of modern art. It 
made me see these artists in a new way, and while the revolutionary art of 
Jackson Pollock is powerfully celebrated (seeing his first really great 
painting, Mural, opposite his last, Blue Poles, is quite a moment), it also 
reveals the true brilliance of artists like Franz Kline and Ad Reinhardt. Yet 
the most sublime artist here, from his troubled early self-portrait wearing 
blue glasses to his majestic poems of uneasy colour, is Mark Rothko.Read a

Royal Academy of Arts. Photograph: Photo (c) CSG CIC Glasgow Museum Collections 
This was a sensitive and subtle exhibition about a sensitive and subtle – and 
incredibly rare – artist. Giorgione was more famous than his friend Titian 
until, in modern times, a more scientific attitude to art history reduced his 
once abundant body of work to barely anything at all. Some of his undisputed 
masterpieces, including his brilliant, challenging painting The Old Woman, were 
shown here among works that may or may not be by him, and those of his 
contemporaries. The result was a truly beautiful evocation of the spirit of 
experiment that flourished in Venetian painting at the start of the 1500s. It 
may not be any easier to identify true paintings by Giorgione, but this 
important event put the “Giorgionesque” mood of delicate sensuality right back 
at the centre of western art, where it belongs.Read a review

Staggering stuff from the greatest living artist – I think he’s clinched that 
title now – with an exhibition of new work that somehow manages to be even more 
impressive than his retrospective at the Royal Academy in 2014. The theme is 
the death of the gods, and Kiefer makes of this Wagnerian stuff a mythology for 
our time – with eerie echoes of another time, 1945, the year of Hitler’s 
Götterdämmerung and the artist’s birth. Turning the gallery into a haunted 
bunker or U-boat, laden with the beds of dying heroes, Kiefer makes history new 
and horrible. Then you discover his stupendous paintings that defy the 
difference between two and three dimensions. This is 21st-century art at its 
most pungent, shocking and valuable.Read a review

History is a chaos of ever-changing images for Kentridge. Defining moments of 
the modern era haunt this compelling exhibition of film and video enflamed by 
his flickering sketches, and staged in playfully sculptural setups. Einstein’s 
theory of relativity, the Russian revolution, the birth of dada at the Cabaret 
Voltaire and Méliès’ early film masterpiece A Voyage to the Moon are among the 
ghosts of modern times that haunt this comic and serious art. Kentridge himself 
is history’s witness and helpless, hapless clown, appearing in these films as 
an ageing melancholic artist who could easily be the central character in a 
Paolo Sorrentino movie. His art is as suggestive and ambitious as an epic novel 
by a 21st-century Thomas Mann.Read a review

William Kentridge is one of the modern South Africans whose art is seen 
against a staggering historical and prehistorical epic landscape in this survey 
of three million years of art. Really. The oldest work here, a “found 
portrait”, was picked up by an early human ancestor that long ago. Actually, 
it’s a pebble shaped like a face. Call that art? Well, art here means not just 
creativity, but things that help people to live and struggle. Spears and 
anti-apartheid badges tell as much about the anguished history of South Africa 
as masks and paintings do. And yet, it includes aSan rock painting 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_rock_art> that is among the greatest 
artistic masterpieces you will ever see.Read a review

 The Eye of the Lord (1870), by Georgiana Houghton. Photograph: Victorian 
Spiritualists’ Union, Melbourne, Australia 
I’d never heard of this Victorian medium before the Courtauld Gallery put on a 
dazzling display of her paintings. Houghton believed the spirits of dead 
artists, including Titian, guided her hand to create her swirling spirit 
drawings. If so they must have seen into the future, for her mesmerising 
vortices of pure colour anticipate 20th-century abstract art. The definitive 
abstract artists Kandinsky and Mondrian would both see their art as spiritual. 
Houghton takes that idea even more literally than they did. These are ghost 
paintings, if you like – or in modern eyes, the brilliant works of a woman 
whose creativity was liberated by her identity as a medium. How many more 
Victorian women artists are waiting to be discovered in the archives of 
spiritualists and old botany journals?Read a review

 Douglas Gordon’s self-portrait as a Jekyll and Hyde character, Monster (1997). 
Photograph: Adagp, Paris 
I loved this gothic romp through modern Scottish art that managed to put 
today’s feted artists, including Douglas Gordon and Christine Borland, 
alongside sculpture and painting going right back to 1945, on the provocative 
basis that they all share a taste for the dark stuff. The city of Burke and 
Hare and Robert Louis Stevenson is full of evidence of Scotland’s cultural 
obsession with evil and madness. Here, close to the atmospheric depths of 
Edinburgh’s Old Town, Gordon turned himself into a monster with Sellotape, 
Borland spookily filmed a robot baby, and the late great Ian Hamilton Finley 
mused disconcertingly on the god Pan’s connection with Panzer tanks. 
Unreasonably good fun.Read a review
