Sadiq Khan <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan>, the mayor of 
London, stressed the importance of Labour being back in power 28 times in a 
speech to the party’s autumn conference, amid speculation about his future 
leadership ambitions.

Khan, who won a sweeping victory in the capital in May, said it was time “for 
us all to work together towards the greatest prize of getting Labour back into 
power”, afterJeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> 
won the leadership election with an increased mandate.

He congratulated Corbyn on his victory and made no explicit criticisms of the 
leader, but his speech fixated on the idea of showing through Labour mayors and 
local authorities thatLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
could be “trusted to govern again”.

 Since being elected, Khan has backed Owen Smith for the leadership and 
claimed that Corbyn was “extremely unlikely” to lead Labour back into No 10.

 In his speech to party conference, on what is being labelled “rebels’ day”, 
the mayor only mentioned Corbyn once but went on to talk about power 38 times, 
of which 28 were variations on the phrase “Labour back in power”.

He started the speech, saying: “Labour in power. Not just talking the talk, 
but walking the walk too. Never sacrificing or selling out on our ideals, but 
putting them in action every single day. Not a revolution overnight, but real 
and meaningful change that makes life easier for the people who need it most.”

 He was given a standing ovation when he arrived at the main hall in Liverpool 
and extended applause after finishing with the words: “Conference, it’s time to 
put Labour back in power. It’s time for a Labour government. A Labour prime 
minister in Downing Street. A Labour cabinet. Labour values put into action. 
Conference, it’s time we put Labour back in power.”

 He said a Labour government would mean more affordable commutes, less 
polluted air, an end to the housing crisis, better pay and conditions, better 
support for businesses and the creation of new jobs.

 Khan went on to suggest the route back to government was building bases of 
Labour power in local areas.

 “Because with Labour in power in cities and regions we can show that our 
party can be trusted to govern again,” he said.

 “With Labour in power we can demonstrate that we can make a real difference 
to people’s lives, and with Labour in power we can prove that we’re ready for 
government.”

Amid speculation that Khan’s ambitions reach higher than the London mayoralty, 
Ken Livingstone, the former London mayor and an ally of Corbyn, dismissed the 
idea of him taking over in future. “The track record of the former mayors of
London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> is they don’t become prime 
minister,” he told the Evening Standard.

 Labour is behind the Conservatives in the opinion polls by double digits, but 
Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have put the party on a war 
footing to get ready for the possibility of a general election as soon as next 
year.

 Corbyn stressed in his victory speech after winning 62% of the vote in the 
leadership election that he would do everything he could to “make it an engine 
of progress for our country and the people that depend on the Labour party to 
protect their interests and win power to deliver real change”.
