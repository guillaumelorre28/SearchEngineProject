Australia and the United States have agreed to share the cost of the US 
military’s presence in Australia’s tropical north, a critical part of President 
Barack Obama’s “pivot” towards Asia, Australia’s defence minister has said.

Marise Payne met the US defence secretary, Ash Carter, in Washington this week 
to discuss plans to double the number of US marines in the northern city of
Darwin <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/darwin> from the current 
1,250 by 2020, a goal that was delayed from 2017.

Australia and the US signed a “force posture agreement” in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/13/abbott-and-obama-agree-to-extend-australias-defence-cooperation-with-us>
 to provide for joint exercises and for US naval and air force deployments. 
Operational costs until now had been split on an ad hoc basis, with 
infrastructure spending withheld.

In March, they discussed basing US long-range B-1 bombers in Darwin,  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/us-defence-secretary-we-are-a-pacific-power-we-arent-going-anywhere>
bolstering US military presence close to the disputed South China Sea.

But in charting a course between its most important ally in the region – the 
US – and its biggest trading partner – China – Australia has drawn rebukes from 
both superpowers.China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> has criticised 
Australian freedom-of-navigation flights in the area and a senior US soldier 
has called on Australia to do more there.

Payne said in a statement on Thursday that supporting the marines in Darwin 
was “consistent with Australia’s longstanding strategic interests in supporting 
US engagement in our region in a manner that promotes regional security and 
stability”.

The two countries will share more than A$2 billion (US$1.52 billion) in 
infrastructure investment in northern Australia and other costs linked to the 
25-year deployment. There are plans for combined training and exercises, 
potentially including other partners in the Asia-Pacific region.

Payne’s office declined to provide a breakdown of the cost-sharing deal or 
give further detail on how and when the troop numbers would be increased.

A spokesman for the US defence department, Commander Gary Ross, said Australia 
and the US had concluded negotiations “in-principle” on cost sharing, while 
details of marine deployments after 2017 “remain subject to discussions”.

“The two sides will now finalize a cost-sharing implementing arrangement to 
capture the terms, pursuant to the force posture agreement,” he said.

Ross said they were working to ensure the cost-sharing was “well-considered, 
equitable and sustainable”.

He said infrastructure investments would include upgrades to airfields, 
aircraft parking areas, living and working accommodation, messes, gyms and 
training ranges. These investments will benefit Australian and US forces.
