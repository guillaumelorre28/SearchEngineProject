The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-claude-juncker>, has been forced to 
abandon an overhaul of flagship nature laws after an unprecedented campaign 
that mobilised over half a million people in protest.

 The popular birds and habitats directives protect almost a fifth 
<http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/index_en.htm> of Europe’s 
landmass, about 200 wetlands, meadows and marine habitats, andmore than a 
thousand animal and plant species 
<http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/index_en.htm>.

But shortly after taking office in 2014, Juncker began a review to overhaul 
the nature laws(pdf) 
<https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/cwt/files/vella_en.pdf> and make them 
more business-friendly, sparking an internal battle at the commission.

But on Wednesday the laws were declared “fit for purpose” without a vote and 
as campaigners celebrated, the environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella, hailed 
what he said was a win for nature inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

“We have listened to public opinion very carefully,” he told the Guardian. 
“The main message sent is that these two directives are a milestone when it 
comes to environmental habitats and species [protections]. We need better and 
smarter implementation but these problems can be solved with non-legislative 
action. The directives will not be reopened.”

A record 550,000 people took part in an online consultation (pdf) 
<http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/study_evaluation_to_support_fitness_check_of_nature_directives__final.pdf>
 about the future of the EU nature directives, with 520,000 respondents – 94% 
of the total – calling for the laws to be left alone. An EU consultants report

 last March concluded the two laws were efficient, coherent, relevant and fit 
for purpose, but the paper was never published.

David Cameron pledged to protect the directives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/rspb-wwf-urge-vote-remain-eu-referendum-protect-uk-wildlife>
 during the EU referendum campaign, as anger at any slashing of natural 
safeguards to appease farming and industrial lobbies grew across Europe.

“This is a huge win for wildlife,” said Alice Puritz, a lawyer for the NGO 
ClientEarth. “These laws work and should be celebrated. Now, we need to see 
strong implementation and enforcement, to make sure Europe’s nature gets the 
protection it needs to thrive.”

“Nature is a key value of our society and necessary for our survival,” said 
Ariel Brunner, the policy chief at BirdLife Europe. “This is also a victory for 
the idea of European cooperation as nature knows no boundaries.”

The Liberal Democrat MEP, Catherine Bearder, said: “I am absolutely thrilled 
by this news. The battle to protect UK nature has been won.”

WWF <https://www.wwf.org.uk/>’s advocacy director, Trevor Hutchings, said: “As 
we exit from the EU we must ensure these protections are enshrined in UK law 
and enhanced through the government’s welcome commitment to a 25-year 
environment plan.”


Amid uncertainty about the future of the directives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/brexit-spirit-crushing-green-directives-minister-george-eustice>
 in post-Brexit Britain, the UN environment programme’s director, Erik Solheim,
also called 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/06/un-calls-for-post-brexit-uk-to-link-with-eu-on-environment-policy>
 for the laws to be kept on the UK’s statute books.

Friends of the Earth <https://www.foe.co.uk/> said urgent moves were needed to 
improve enforcement of the nature laws in the UK – and to protect them after 
Brexit. “The need for enforcement is particularly keen in Northern Ireland 
where there has been systemic failure to protect sites covered by the 
directives,” said Sandra Bell, the green group’s nature campaigner.

 In the Lough Neagh and Lough Beg special protection area, the Northern Irish 
government has recently approved a highway to carry 22,000 vehicles a day 
through valuable winter feeding areas for migratory birds that should be 
protected, Bell said.

 “This decision must and will be challenged,” she said. “It shows why EU 
nature laws are so important, but also why the European commission needs to 
clamp down on the regular instances where these laws are being breached.”

The commission says that it will now draw up an action plan to scale up 
investment and good management practices in Natura 2000 sites – protected areas 
which were created by the two directives.
