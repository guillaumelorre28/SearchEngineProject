The Surrey rock crew <http://www.youmeatsix.co.uk/> have built a steady 
success since their 2008 debut, finally topping the UK album chart with their 
last effort,Cavalier Youth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/26/you-me-at-six-cavalier-youth-review>
, and this punchy, glossy fifth album is sure to cement their success among 
fans of Foo Fighters and Biffy Clyro. Unlike those bands, however, You Me at 
Six still seem to have little originality or depth to offer. The meaty, 
swaggeringtitle track <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uitU1ndO3s> and the 
racing Plus One are exhilarating, but moments of passing interest are few among 
the generic likes ofHeavy Soul <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnOWRS8-sDY>, 
with its identikit alt-rock, or the Royal Blood-ish thrasherSwear 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4izOTSiPPE> (“mine’s a Jameson”? Dear Lord). 
Things reach their nadir on the mawkish strum-and-bawl ballad Take on the 
World, melodrama barrelling headlong into meaninglessness.
