As players and medical staff rushed over to help another firecracker landed 
next to Lopes and exploded, catching the goalkeeper and a club doctor.

The referee, Lionel Jaffredo, subsequently took the players off the pitch, and 
the match was abandoned after a further 45-minute delay.Lyon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lyon> later tweeted to say Lopes was 
being assessed in hospital.

The Ligue de Football Professionnel, the governing body, confirmed it would be 
conducting an investigation, saying in a statement: “The LFP regrets this 
incident, and will be uncompromising in dealing with it.”

Speaking immediately after the game, Lyon’s president, Jean-Michel Aulas, 
said: “At best, he suffered very significant tinnitus. He has no balance and 
doesn’t really know where he is. At worst, his eardrum may be affected.

“This is so serious, so shameful. Security must be provided by the host club. 
We saw things that are unacceptable and unthinkable. I expect a strong reaction 
from the LFP and FFF [Fédération Française de Football].”
