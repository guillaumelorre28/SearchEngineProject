The Wales captain Sam Warburton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sam-warburton> will be out for up to six 
weeks after suffering an ankle injury, putting a question mark over his 
participation in the Six Nations Championship.

Wales start their campaign away to Ireland on 7 February, which may leave him 
only two weeks to regain full fitness for the match.

The Cardiff Blues flanker was hurt after he fell awkwardly at the side of a 
ruck with Ospreys’ Justin Tipuric, who ironically would be most likely to take 
his place in the international side.

Warburton carried on playing after having the injury strapped up but lasted 
just 10 minutes before limping from the field.

The Lions captain left the ground wearing a protective boot as a precaution 
and was ruled out of further action after a scan.

Meanwhile Mike Phillips, Wales’ most-capped scrum-half, has announced his 
retirement from international rugby.

Phillips, 33, who last played for Wales in a 35-21 defeat by Ireland in a 
World Cup warm-up match on 8 August, has appeared in 94 Tests for Wales and 
five for the Lions. “This is a chance for me to bring this chapter of my life 
to a close,” he said. “It was always a dream of mine to play for Wales, it 
meant everything to me and it’s an amazing feeling to represent your country. 
For me it was a privilege.”
