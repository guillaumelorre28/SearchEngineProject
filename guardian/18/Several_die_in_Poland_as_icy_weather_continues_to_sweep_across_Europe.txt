A cold snap gripping Europe has killed 10 more people in Poland, stranded 
thousands in snow-coveredTurkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> and 
left vulnerable people like refugees and the homeless in dire circumstances.

Double-digit sub-zero temperatures have claimed more than 30 lives over the 
past few days, many of them people found frozen to death.

Temperatures have plunged to below -20C (-4F) in some regions of Poland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland>, where the centre for national 
security said 65 people had died of hypothermia since 1 November.

Greece and Italy have also seen fierce cold weather over the past week, with 
several refugees and migrants dying of hypothermia in both countries. Greece 
has moved many of its 60,000 mainly Syrian refugees to prefabricated houses and 
heated tents.

On the island of Moria, there are “more than 2,500 people living in tents, 
without hot water or heating, including women, children and handicapped 
people”, said Apostolos Veizis from the charity Doctors Without Borders. He 
said there were more than 300 people in a similar situation on the island of 
Samos.

The European Commission said the conditions on the islands and in other camps 
where refugees are housed were “untenable” but ultimately the responsibility of 
the Greek authorities.

In Italy, the cold snap claimed two more lives: an 82-year-old man who died in 
a house without heating near the southern city of Brindisi and a 78-year-old 
man in a village in northern Sicily.

Traffic on the Danube and Sava rivers was halted in Serbia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/serbia>, where the temperature in the 
south-eastern town of Sjenica plunged to -33C. In the capital, Belgrade, scores 
of refugees and migrants took shelter in a warehouse near the capital’s railway 
station, spurning shelters provided by the government for fear they would be 
deported.

“It’s very difficult, especially at night,” said Niamat, a 13-year-old Afghan. 
The temperature overnight was -15C.

“I have been waiting here for three months and I do not know when I will be 
able to continue my journey,” said Niamat, who is travelling alone.

Ismail, 16, said: “Nobody is helping us, it’s very cold and I’m worried how we 
will endure this.”

Heavy snowfall in Turkey’s main city of Istanbul paralysed traffic for a third 
straight day, with the Bosphorus strait being closed to ships and hundreds of 
flights being cancelled.


Ferry services between the European and Asian sides of the city were stopped 
and schools across the city closed.
