In five words

Riverside tea and screeching seagulls

Sound of the city

Rattling: Nizhny Novgorod is filled with the rattling sound of passing trams. 
It’s the city where Russia’s first ever tram line was launched.

Smell of the city 

Nizhny smells of rivers. That might sound strange, but two big rivers – the 
Volga and the Oka – become one here. And if you stand at Strelka – the name of 
the point at which the rivers meet – you’ll get swept up in a humid wind. In 
spring this wind smells of lilacs, in summer it smells of linden breaking 
through the scent of smoke and industrial gas from the factories.

 No yoking, the Kremlin is the city’s best building. Photograph: Evgenij 
Bogushev 
The Kremlin complex has become the symbol of the city – it’s an example of 
Russian defensive architecture, built in the 16th century to protect residents, 
and thanks to it the city has been saved from numerous invasions. Now it is 
home to administrative buildings, a working temple and museums – it’s like a 
city within a city. Its ancient church is the highest point of Nizhny Novgorod.

The complex has 13 towers and each one has its own name, secret and legend. 
There are several stories about the Yoke Tower – they say that it was named 
after a girl with a yoke (a wooden pole to help carry two buckets over your 
shoulders), which she once used to fend off robbers who were besieging the city.

 And it’s also the worst … Photograph: Alyona Ageeva 
Ironically, the ugliest building is also in the Kremlin complex. The main 
administrative building is a hideous construction of glass and concrete – it’s 
like a thorn in the heart of the historical centre. Citizens named it the 
Babylon tower of Nizhny because of the extremely long time it took to 
construct. It took more than 10 years to build –ample time for it to cause 
controversy 
<http://pravdapfo.ru/articles/77843-shancev-stroit-dom-pravitelstva-i>. 

What does your city do better than anywhere else?

The commute: at least for some city residents, the journey to the office can 
be a case of jumping onto a cable car. A couple of years ago, Nizhny Novgorod 
got one going over the Volga river. An exotic form of transportation in Russian 
cities, it also solves a lot of problems with traffic jams – it has become as 
commonplace as buses for residents.

Best Instagram

This account is for people who love the unique architecture of the city, and 
the community posts their own photos of high-tech buildings alongside wooden 
art nouveau. It’s a view of the city from the inside.

Biggest controversy

One of the hottest subjects being discussed across Nizhny right now is the way 
in which the old city is vanishing. Nizhny was originally a merchants’ city, 
full of marvellous small wooden estates belonging to the wealthy 19th-century 
merchants. But wooden building are very difficult to maintain and so, instead 
of restoring them, the city authorities turn to demolition. Some people support 
the modernisation, but others feel we are losing the history of our city every 
day.

Street style in Nizhny is definitely not something to write home about. 
Although there are plenty of cool and interesting local brands all over Russia, 
there are hardly any shops where you can buy non-mass market clothes in this 
city. Local fashionistas hunt for stylish outfits in Moscow, St Petersburg and
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

Most people here try not to stand out from the crowd: as it’s cold most of the 
year, they just wear dark coats. There are a few city personalities who try to 
bring colour to all the gloom, though.Natalia Uryadnikova 
<https://www.instagram.com/nataly_kosmos/> is one of them – she posts stylish 
looks on a regular basis on her Instagram, as well as shots from backstage at 
fashion shows. She is the only fashion Instablogger in the city.

Moment in history

The all-Russia Exhibition, which was held in Nizhny in 1896, changed the face 
of the city. For Nizhny, it was akin to the firstWorld Fair in Paris 
<http://library.brown.edu/cds/paris/worldfairs.html>. It is thanks to this fair 
that many of the city’s most beautiful buildings and bridges were built. It 
also coincided with the opening of the first theatre and first tram.

Nizhny is home to a unique museum of wooden architecture 
<https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%85%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D1%8B_%D0%B8_%D0%B1%D1%8B%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B6%D1%8C%D1%8F>
 that very few people know about. It’s an open air museum and features numerous 
ancient wooden churches, houses and wells. You can enjoy the reconstructed 
interiors and imagine what it might have been like to live as Russian peasants 
back in the 18th and 19th centuries – you can use the spinning wheels, or get 
water with a bucket from a well. Another interesting part is the wooden church 
cupolas, built without a single nail.

The museum is located on the outskirts of the city and there is almost no 
advertising for it online. You can only get there with the help of locals, but 
once you get there you won’t regret it.

 1, 2, 3 … 1,071: the Chkalov stairs. Photograph: Evgenij Bogushev 
If you happen to be in Nizhny, you have to walk up the Chkalov stairs 
<http://www.nizhnynovgorod.com/tourism/sightseeing/city_sights/chkalov_staircase/>
, which run from the Minina Square to the lower Volga embankment. Built during 
the Soviet era they are the longest flight of stairs on the banks of the Volga.

And, while feasting your eyes on the river views, try and count how many steps 
there are – it’s something of a city joke to try and count all one-and-a-half 
odd thousand of them!

How green is your city?

Like in many Russian industrial cities, you rarely see separate waste 
collection or points of recycling. Any eco initiatives tend to be the work of 
small hipster groups, or even smaller groups of green activists.

Car use is also high – the city is divided by the river into two parts and as 
the bridges between the two are constantly being repaired, there are long 
traffic jams for people looking to get from one part of town to another.
