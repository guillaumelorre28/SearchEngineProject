“I was told by the chief of army staff that the camp fell at about 1.35pm on 
Friday and that the terrorists are on the run and no longer have a place to 
hide,” Muhammadu Buhari said in a statement.

He said the capture of the camp marked the “final crushing of Boko Haram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/boko-haram> terrorists in their last enclave 
in Sambisa forest”, which is in Borno state in north-east Nigeria.

It follows a large-scale offensive in the forest by the Nigerian military in 
the last few weeks. Reuters was unable to independently verify whether the camp 
had been captured.

The military had said in the last few days that Boko Haram fighters were 
fleeing into surrounding areas, and locals were told to be vigilant.

Boko Haram has killed 15,000 people and displaced more than 2 million during 
its seven-year insurgency to create an Islamic state governed by a strict 
interpretation of sharia law.

In early 2015 the group controlled an area around the size of Belgium, but it 
has since been pushed out of most of that territory by Nigeria’s army and 
troops from neighbouring countries.
