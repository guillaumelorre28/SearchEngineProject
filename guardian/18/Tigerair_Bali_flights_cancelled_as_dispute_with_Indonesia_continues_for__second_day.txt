All Tigerair flights in and out of Bali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/bali> on Thursday have been cancelled as the 
airline’s dispute with the Indonesian government drags into a second day.

However, Virgin plans to operate two flights from Bali on Thursday in order to 
bring as many affected customers back to Australia as possible.

Flights in the early hours of Friday have also been cancelled, leaving 
hundreds of passengers stranded. The remaining five flights to and from Bali on 
Friday are currently under review.

Customers currently in Australia who are affected by the cancellation of 
Thursday’s Tigerair services will be offered a full refund.

Passengers on services that will not be operated on Thursday and passengers 
that will be on board Virgin’s replacement flights on Friday will be contacted 
directly by Tigerair.

All other Tigerair flights remain unaffected.

The decision was made after the Indonesian government imposed new conditions 
on Tigerair over its access to Denpasar airport.

“Tigerair was and is in compliance with all original conditions imposed by the 
Indonesian government on the operation of its Bali services,” the airline said 
in a statement.

“Tigerair is working with the relevant Indonesian authorities to meet the new 
requirements as soon as possible.”
