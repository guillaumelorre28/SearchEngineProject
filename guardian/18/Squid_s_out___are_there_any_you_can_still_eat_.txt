<https://www.nigella.com/recipes/salt-and-pepper-squid>, and probably 
spiralised by the Hemsley sisters. There are 300 different types in the oceans, 
ranging fromthe colossal squid <http://ocean.si.edu/giant-squid>, who has the 
biggest eyes of any creature on the planet, to thevampire squid 
<http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/vampire-squid-hell>, whose eight arms flow 
like a black cape. Despite a growth in popularity, squid is classified as an 
unprotected species and is not currently subject to quota restrictions – but 
the methods used to catch it can have an impact on other species. New ratings 
produced by theMarine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide 
<http://www.goodfishguide.org/> suggest that some species should be eaten 
either rarely or not at all. So which squid is the most sustainable? Here is 
our guide to the calamari to consume ...

Atlantic or European squid
Loligo vulgaris, Loligo forbesi

The most common species eaten in the UK, landed mainly in Scotland and caught 
in the north-east Atlantic bydemersal otter trawl 
<http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/understanding-the-problem/fisheries-problems-today/demersal-otter-trawls/>
, a large cone-shaped net towed across the sea bed; or jig, a grappling hook on 
a line jerked in the water to snag the squid, usually at night. According to 
the Good Fish Guide, it’s “not a good choice of sustainable fish to eat and 
should be only eaten very occasionally”. If you do, “go for squid from 
smaller-scale fisheries taking Atlantic and European squid as bycatch, or 
targeted fisheries using low-impact jigging such as Sennen Cove in Cornwall,” 
says MCS Good Fish Guide manager Bernadette Clarke, who updated the latest 
ratings.

Japanese flying squid
Todarodes pacificus

The most sustainable squid of all, caught in the north-west Pacific and 
considered by theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/iucn-red-list> to be a species of 
least concern. “The jig fishing is low impact,” explains Clarke. “A stock 
assessment is carried out, and it is more regulated.” Go forth and eat Japanese 
flying squid!

Humboldt or jumbo squid
Dosidicus gigas

The most heavily fished squid species in the world, along with the Argentine 
short fin. Mainly caught in the east-central Pacific by large-scale industrial 
jigging using light lures that can be seen from space. “It should be eaten only 
very, very occasionally,” says Clarke.

Argentine short fin
Illex argentinus

“It’s caught by purse seine [big nets] or jig in the waters off Argentina and 
the Falklands,” says Clarke of the squid that is the target of one of the 
largest fisheries in the world. “Fishing occurs on the high seas where it’s 
more difficult to regulate huge fleets from Argentina, Taiwan, China, Republic 
of Korea and Spain.” In other words, avoid.

Indian squid
Loligo duvauceli

Distributed throughout the Red and Arabian Seas and constituting up to 90% of 
squid catches off Thailand, the Indian squid is still to be assessed by the 
Good Fish Guide with ratings expected at the start of 2017. “Indian squid 
caught in the western Indian Ocean by hook and line is slightly more 
sustainable than jig,” Clarke notes. “But there is no current stock assessment 
available.”
