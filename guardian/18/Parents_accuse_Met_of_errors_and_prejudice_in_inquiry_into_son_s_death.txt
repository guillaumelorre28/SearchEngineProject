The family of a teenager whose body was found in the Thames last year have 
claimed that a catalogue of errors led to their son’s death being wrongly 
determined to be a suicide and accusedMetropolitan police 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/metropolitan-police> service staff of racist 
behaviour.

Krishna Chummun, 19, was preparing to begin his second year of a business 
studies degree at BPP University inLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> when he went missing. Before his death 
he had told his mother he was “madly in love” with someone from another 
religion, a Sikh woman whom he hoped to marry despite disapproval from members 
of the local community. On 7 August 2015 he boarded a night bus home after 
playing football with friends in Enfield, but never arrived.


His body was recovered eight weeks later after being spotted by a passerby 
near the London Eye, but he was not identified until December. His cause of 
death was eventually described as “unascertained” in an open verdict by the 
coroner William Dolman, who said there were “too many gaps” in the case to 
establish the exact circumstances.

Pradeep Chummun, 52, and his wife, Medha, 47, say a series of police missteps 
could have undermined the investigation into their son’s disappearance. In a 
witness statement Pradeep Chummun says that Met staff were “insensitive, rude 
and at times unhelpful” because they were “prejudiced due to our ethnicity”. A 
Met spokesman said the matter had been referred to theIndependent Police 
Complaints Commission <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ipcc> (IPCC).

The family are calling for a murder case to be opened, and their complaints 
against the Met are the subject of an inquiry by the IPCC.

“Every day we are dying slowly,” Medha said. “I’m so stressed out. Nothing is 
happening. It has been nearly one and a half years since my son is gone and 
still we are left in the dark.

“We are just given excuses and left to our own pain every day. I can’t 
understand it in a country like this where justice is supposed to be. We keep 
asking the police questions but they are still sleeping on the case.”


Among their claims, the couple say police:

 * Failed to recover CCTV footage from cameras that could have recorded their 
son’s final moments. 
 * Said there was “no point” in carrying out a forensic autopsy, and suggested 
the parents pay for one themselves. 
 * May have failed to take a proper statement from a key witness who allegedly 
said she saw Chummun being beaten and kidnapped on the day he went missing. 
 * Issued a missing persons appeal for Krishna in November 2015, three months 
after he disappeared and after his as yet unidentified body had been moved to a 
morgue in south London. 
 * Joked in an interview with the parents while Chummun was missing that he 
was “not going to fit” in a suitcase seen in the family home. 
 * Treated them like second-class citizens because they are from an ethnic 
minority. 
Chummun’s body was recovered on 10 October, still wearing his black Nike 
AirMax trainers, a black T-shirt with the words “premier premium goods” and a 
distinctive Casio gold-plated watch that had been a gift from his uncle.


It was evident from the condition of the body that he had been in the river 
for some time, and police were apparently unable to identify him despite the 
distinguishable items worn. The Met has previously said he was wearing a 
different shoe size and clothes to those he had been described as wearing when 
reported missing. It was not until 21 December that he was identified, using 
three teeth extracted from his mouth that were matched during a speculative 
one-off search of the national database.

Five days later, on Boxing Day, five months after he went missing, the parents 
were told their son had been found.

On the same day five years earlier, Medha had suffered a stroke, which led to 
her undergoing five operations. “It’s an unlucky date for us in this family,” 
Pradeep said. “When Medha was ill, Krishna was always at her bedside and 
devoted much of his time to caring for her. He was a good son to her and she is 
heartbroken without him.”

A postmortem examination was unable to determine Chummun’s cause of death and 
toxicology tests found no trace of drugs in his liver. At an inquest on 7 
April, Dolman ruled there was not sufficient evidence to find that the teenager 
had intended to kill himself.

He said: “Applying the facts to the law, we don’t have any evidence of what 
act he undertook that might have led to his death. We don’t know if he fell, 
was thrown, slipped … we just don’t know.”

In the days after Chummun went missing, his parents launched a frantic effort 
to find him, texting and calling friends and relatives. They say his girlfriend 
visited and told them the couple had argued on the phone on the night of his 
disappearance, and he had sent her text messages claiming he was going to kill 
himself. At the inquest into his death she said that he had made similar 
comments “once or twice” before.

The couple said that when they contacted the police, officers tried to brush 
off their concerns that the disappearance was out of character.

“From day one we were treated like second-class citizens,” said Pradeep, who 
works as a psychiatric nurse. “They think because we are from an ethnic 
minority we are ignorant.

 “A woman from the missing persons unit saw a suitcase in our house. She shook 
it and said: ‘He’s not going to fit in there, is he?’ Our son is missing and 
she is making a sarcastic joke. It really upset us.”


A week after Chummun’s disappearance, the family say, a relative reported that 
their neighbour, an 82-year-old woman named Rita, claimed she had seen him 
being attacked and kidnapped on the night he went missing.

“Rita said that she saw from an upstairs window Krishna being attacked by 
three men,” Chummun’s father claimed. “She said one had a gun in his hand, one 
was arguing with Krishna and a third man attacked him with a baseball bat. Then 
she said they put him in a black Transit van and drove away.”

Babs Ryan, another neighbour, said that a few days after Chummun’s 
disappearance Rita had confided in her about what she had seen on the Friday 
night he went missing.

“She said that these men came up in a van and demanded that he go with them. 
She said they took his keys and that they were shouting at him. She said 
something about they had a gun in their hands and they banged him on the head 
and threw him in the van. It was near midnight.”

Ryan went on: “She took ill about the same time and died a few weeks later. 
She shut herself away and she pined. She was unwell anyway but worrying about 
him didn’t help.”

The family say they immediately related the allegations to police but were 
alarmed at the way they were handled. “They said they had looked into it but 
called back about half an hour later and said no such thing had happened … that 
it was all hearsay and rumours,” Pradeep said.

“At this point I was trying to calm Medha down because she was hysterical.”

Rita confirmed her account to Medha, the family say, but died in December and 
the couple fear police never took a proper statement from her. The Met and IPCC 
declined to comment on specifics of the case.

The couple also claim they urged police to check CCTV in the area, but were 
later told that CCTV footage was only kept for 30 days.Police 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> knew about the abduction allegation 
within 23 days of the disappearance. Pradeep said he was also told “there are 
thousands of cameras in London” and it was not possible to search them all.


He said he also asked if the river could be searched, but claims he was told: 
“No, the Thames current is so strong that it would break the body to pieces and 
drag it away.”

The family say they do not know whether records from Chummun’s Oyster card, 
bank card and mobile phone were checked.


 “I feel like in our dealings with the police we are the ones being treated 
like criminals,” Medha said. “It has taken its toll on my health and I have to 
take sleeping pills and antidepressants to get through the day.

“We have made a vow to find out what happened to our boy. I’m 100% sure my son 
was murdered and someone is just sitting there getting away with it.”


A spokesman for the Met police confirmed that their inquiries into the death 
had concluded, and added: “The IPCC is independently investigating issues 
raised by the family of Krishna Chummun in a complaint. This was voluntarily 
referred to them by the Met on 2 February.

“We await the IPCC’s report and it would be inappropriate to comment further 
at this stage. No officer is suspended or on restricted duties.”

The IPCC said its investigation was continuing and it would therefore not be 
appropriate to comment.
