Take me there: Bohuslän coast, Sweden

Why go? 
Fans of Nordic-noir thrillers could be forgiven for thinking the Scandinavians 
live in a land of half-light and endless rain. Visit the west coast of Sweden 
in summer and another picture reveals itself. Stretching north from Gothenburg 
to the Norwegian border, Bohuslän is where the Swedes go to eat their 
bodyweight in pickled herring and crayfish, bob about in boats and drink 
schnapps in pretty harbour-front bars.

What to do
Bohuslän's fishing villages are famed for their fresh seafood and distinctive 
red fishing huts. Popular spots are Lysekil, Smögen and Fjällbacka, where 
Ingrid Bergman spent her summers. Fjällbacka is also the home of crime writer
Camilla Läckberg – 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/11/camilla-lackberg-swedish-crime-best>
 fans can take a 45-minute"cosy crime walk" 
<http://kustguiden.eu/lackberg-murder-mystery-tour.html> around the village. 
Embark on a boat trip to one of the 10,000 islands which lie off the coast. 
Marstrand is where the Swedish royals holiday and has a big yachting scene, 
while the rugged Weather Islands and Koster Islands are perfect for walking, 
cycling and swimming off the rocks. Fish for mackerel and crayfish on a seafood 
safari from Grebbestad (evertssjobod.se <http://www.evertssjobod.se/>).

Where to eat
Every table has a sea view at Peterson's Krog (petersonskrog.se 
<http://www.petersonskrog.se/Petersons.html>), a lively restaurant serving fish 
dishes on Käringön (30 minutes by ferry or taxi boat from Hälleviksstrand). 
Also on the island is the Käringön Oyster Bar (karingo.com 
<http://www.karingo.com/>) where you can drink champagne and eat oysters grown 
on the family farm while sitting in a hot tub at the water's edge.

Where to stay
The charming Stora Hotellet Bryggan in Fjällbacka has a prime spot overlooking 
the marina and crisp, New England-style bedrooms (from £150,

Insider tip
"For the best smoked herring and crayfish go to Åstols Rökeri (astolsrokeri.se 
<http://www.astolsrokeri.se/>)," says Darren Hamlin of Simply Sweden (
simplysweden.co.uk <http://www.simplysweden.co.uk/>). "It's a restaurant with 
its own smokehouse and musicians come from all over to play here."
