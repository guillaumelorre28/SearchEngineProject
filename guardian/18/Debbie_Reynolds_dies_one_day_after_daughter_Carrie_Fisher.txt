“The last thing she said this morning was that she was very, very sad about 
losing Carrie and that she would like to be with her again,” Fisher said. 
“Fifteen minutes later she suffered a severe stroke.”

Reynolds died just hours after she was taken to Cedars Sinai medical center 
from her son’s house in Beverly Hills on Wednesday afternoon.

“The only thing we’re taking solace in is that what she wanted to do was take 
care of her daughter, which is what she did best,” he added.

On Friday, Carrie Fisher reportedly suffered a heart attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/25/carrie-fisher-heart-attack-stable-condition>

on Christmas Day that Fisher was in a stable condition.

Carrie Fisher <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/carrie-fisher> died two 
days later.

On Tuesday, Reynolds addressed Fisher’s death on Facebook, writing 
<https://www.facebook.com/thedebbiereynolds/posts/811585312313920>: “Thank you 
to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing 
daughter. I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her 
to her next stop. Love Carries Mother.”

“So heartsick. Debbie went to be with Carrie. It’s such a devastating 1, 2 
punch,”tweeted <https://twitter.com/DebraMessing/status/814289560469471232> 
Debra Messing. Reynolds played Messing’s mother on the sitcom Will & Grace. 
“She was my ‘mom’ for years & I loved her dearly. A legend.”

Messing’s co-star Eric McCormack, who played Will, tweeted a short time later 
<https://twitter.com/EricMcCormack/status/814304550345580548>: “The combination 
of the loss of Carrie Fisher & then her mom Debbie Reynolds is too much. I’m 
really at a loss here.”

Albert Brooks, who directed and co-starred with Reynolds in 1996’s Mother, was 
another of the star’s “children” who paid tribute on Wednesday.

Hollywood veteran Carl Reiner, who acted alongside Reynolds in the 1959 comedy 
The Gazebo, and later directed Carrie Fisher in the 1990 comedy Sibling Rivalry,
tweeted <https://twitter.com/carlreiner/status/814299450881417216>: “How 
shocked we were to learn that Debbie Reynolds passed away just a day after her 
daughter Carrie. I loved & worked [with] both of these icons.”

Carol Channing <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/carol-channing>, who 
performed with Reynolds on stage, told the Press Association: “She was 
beautiful and generous. It seems like only yesterday she was having lunch here 
at the house and we were discussing the possibility of working together in a 
new show.”

Actor Rip Taylor, who had also performed with Reynolds in Las Vegas, said: “I 
was blessed to work with this remarkable woman for 45, almost 50 years. That 
makes for a very rare bond and unique relationship. She was generous to a 
fault, never caring who got the laugh from the audience. I will always love 
her.”

In 2011, Reynolds and Fisher appeared together for an extensive interview on 
the Oprah Winfrey show. During the interview, mother and daughter spoke about 
their admiration for each other.

Fisher said: “I believe my mother knows now but if she doesn’t, it would be 
good if she did: that I take her advice, that I follow her example, that I 
respect who she is … and if I’m like her in any way then I’m happy that I am.”

Earlier on Wednesday, Winfrey tweeted a photo from the interview, saying: 
“Remembering the good times with Carrie and her mother.”
