Julie Byrne <https://juliembyrne.bandcamp.com/>’s 2014 debut had a tiny release
 
<http://orindal.limitedrun.com/products/520228-julie-byrne-rooms-with-walls-and-windows>
 but spread far afield through word-of-mouth: here, among a sea of folk sirens, 
was someone really worth tuning in to. A self-taught fingerpicker, this 
peripatetic American has a voice of rare elegance, pitched low and misty, and 
plenty of gentle significance to relay. On her second album, it glides across 
landscapes both external (Sea As It Glides) and internal (All the Land 
Glimmered), picking out detail others might not perceive. If anything, the lead 
trackNatural Blue <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQrrMaJyVbc> doesn’t sell 
her charms well enough. Abetted by some sparse orchestration, the beauty ofNot 
Even Happiness takes effect even if you can’t make out Byrne’s measured 
poeticism: the voice is a balm.
