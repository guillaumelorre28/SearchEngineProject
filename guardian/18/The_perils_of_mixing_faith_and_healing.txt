Chibundu Onuzo seems to think that it was appropriate for a nurse to ask 
patients, on their way to surgery, if she could pray with them (I’m invisible – 
I am a Christian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/12/nurse-prayers-sarah-kuteh-christian-faith-patients>
, 13 December). I put the question to my elderly friends. The majority said 
that it would terrify them at a particularly vulnerable time as they would 
assume that the nurse expected them to die. Some said they would be angry at 
such an inappropriate question in a hospital. One commented that he had 
previously been approached by a hospital chaplain and, far from being 
comforted, was shocked that the NHS was paying the chaplain’s wages when it had 
had cut nursing staff.

To inflict your own beliefs on someone who cannot get away from you and at 
such a tense time is unprofessional in the extreme. Everyone is entitled to 
practise their own belief in their private life, but forcing it on others in 
the work environment is simply wrong.

• The Darent Valley hospital board will waste a lot of NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> money on lawyers’ fees by sacking a 
good nurse, Sarah Kuteh, in a cruel manner. All she did was to ask patients if 
they would like prayer support. She was not thrusting her Christian views on 
them. Perhaps the hospital chaplain team could act as advocates between the 
board and Sarah before this escalates into an unnecessary expensive and 
wasteful court case. How about doing this before Christmas?

• It is sad that Sarah Kuteh lost her job after offering to pray with 
patients. Generally I feel that, as with politics, religion should be avoided 
in the workplace. Someone is going to be offended or feel excluded, so best 
not. If hospital admission forms still list religion, patients could then be 
informed what services are available, hospital chaplain etc.

Going into surgery affects people in different ways – pre-meds make me sleepy 
and I prefer to be left alone – but if someone needs prayer before then, best 
to discuss that at time of admission.

• Chibundu Onuzo complains of invisibility. How strange! For consider. There 
is a church in every village and district – often several. There are bishops in 
the House of Lords. There are church schools round every corner – with more to 
come. There are prayers in parliament and council meetings. There is the 
priority that schools give to religious perspectives on morals and belief; 
perspectives to which most of us are now indifferent or hostile. And then there 
isThought for the Day <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00szxv6> – still closed 
to non-religious voices.

It’s an odd kind of invisibility that is quite so visible. And an odd kind of 
believer who feels that it’s not enough.
