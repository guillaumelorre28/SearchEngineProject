A Beijing company has unveiled spectacularly futuristic designs for a 
pollution-busting, elevated bus capable of gliding over thenightmarish mega-jams

 for which urban China has become notorious.


Plans for the so-called Transit Explore Bus 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpiFJsWdCuY> or TEB were showcased earlier 
this month at atechnology expo <http://english.chitec.cn/> in the Chinese 
capital.

The “straddling bus”, which owes more to Blade Runner than China’s car-clogged 
highways, is supported by two legs that run along rails laid along the roadside.

Those legs allow the TEB’s giant frame to glide high above the gridlock at 
speeds of up to 60km per hour. Equally, vehicles that are less than two metres 
high will be able to drive freely underneath the bus, even when it is 
stationary.

“The biggest advantage is that the bus will save lots of road space,” Song 
Youzhou, the project’s chief engineer,told Xinhua 
<http://www.china.org.cn/china/2016-05/26/content_38538976.htm>, China’s 
official news agency.

Song claimed his buses, capable of transporting up to 1,400 commuters, could 
be produced for 20% of the price of an underground train and rolled out far 
more quickly since the supporting infrastructure was relatively simple.

One TEB could replace 40 conventional buses, he said. 

A prototype will reportedly be deployed on the streets of Qinhuangdao, a 
coastal city about 300km east of Beijing, this summer.

The project has been greeted with anticipation in China, where traffic jams 
have grown as the country overtook the United States to becomethe largest car 
market on earth

 in 2009.

Last year alone 21.1 million passenger cars were sold here. 

However, excitement over the innovation was tempered by the fact that a 
virtually identical contraption

 was unveiled at the same expo in 2010 without catching on.

Its designer? A Chinese engineer by the name of Song Youzhou.
