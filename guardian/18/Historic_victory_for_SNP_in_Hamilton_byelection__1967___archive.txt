The Scottish Nationalist Mrs Winifred Ewing 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_Ewing>, aged 38, the vivacious mother of 
three young children, beat Labour against all the odds in Hamilton – rock solid 
for socialism for 50 years.


“Hamilton has made history for Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> tonight,” said an elated Mrs Ewing, a 
Glasgow solicitor fighting her first campaign, while outside in the pitiless 
rain the vast Nationalist camp went crazy with delight at the breakthrough 
victory the movement has been seeking for years.

It was a catastrophe for Labour and for the Conservatives (who lost their 
deposit by 11 votes) in Scottish nationalism’s second parliamentary victory 
ever – Dr R. D. McIntyre, now party president, won the adjacent Motherwell seat 
at a wartime byelection in 1945 and held it for only three months

What cost Labour the election? Both the Labour and the Conservative candidates 
were adamant that Hamilton’s growing anti-Socialist protest vote had come from 
both sides of politics and backed the candidate that seemed most set to win.

This Nationalist coup – in a seat where they lost their deposit last time out 
in 1959 – follows Plaid Cymru’s Carmarthen success for Gwynfor Evans a year 
ago, and serves the London-based parties with a clear warning that Scotland and 
Wales are increasingly impatient about Westminster’s total failure to solve 
their special problems.
