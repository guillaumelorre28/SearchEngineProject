.

Titled The Numbers: Jonny, Thom and a CR78 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hgVihWjK2c>, which is a reference to a Roland 
drum machine, the video features guitarist Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke 
sitting on a bench while playing the song. Shot in Tarzana, California, it is 
the third video he has produced for the band’s current album.

The release follows Anderson’s video for Present Tense, which saw the same 
setup featuring Greenwood and Yorke, and Daydreaming, which followed a more 
conventional music video setup and saw Yorkewalking through various scenes

The director has links with the band due to his work with Jonny Greenwood

, who has composed Oscar-nominated music for Anderson’s films, includingThe 
Master

 and his atonal, unsettling score forThere Will Be Blood

Anderson also worked with Greenwood on the documentary Junun

, which followed the guitarist’s work with musicians in Rajasthan in north-west 
India. Greenwood has also collaborated with lauded Polish classical composer
Krzysztof Penderecki 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/23/poles-collide-jonny-greenwood-penderecki>
 when the pair worked together on the 2012 album, 48 Responses to Polymorphia.

The album’s first video, for the song Burn the Witch, was accused of breaching 
copyright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/16/radiohead-copyright-burn-the-witch-video-trumpton>
 over its similarity to the children’s TV show Trumpton.
