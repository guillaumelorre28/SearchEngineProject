Two Polish police officers have been sent to patrol the streets of Harlow in 
Essex following the killing of a Polish man in the town and a spike in hate 
crime directed at Poles in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union.

Harlow’s sizeable Polish community is said to be “scared and worried” after 
the killing last month of Arkadiusz Jóźwik, 40, by a gang of teenagers in what 
is being treated by Essex police as a possible hate crime.


Jóźwik and a second Polish man, who survived, were allegedly the victims of an 
unprovoked attack. Three other Poles have also been attacked in separate recent 
incidents in the town.

The deployment of the officers came as the president of the European 
commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, condemned attacks on Polish people in the UK.


“We Europeans can never accept Polish workers being beaten up, harassed or 
even murdered in the streets of Essex,” Juncker said in his annual state of the 
union address to MEPs in Strasbourg.

Essex police have taken up an offer by the Polish state police to deploy two 
officers in the town. The officers, second lieutenant Bartosz Czernicki and 
chief sergeant Dariusz Tybura, started work on Wednesday and will initially be 
on patrol for a week.

They will have no formal police powers, but the move is designed to ease 
community tensions and reassure Poles, according to a spokesman for the Polish 
embassy in London.

“They are there to assist with community relations for Essex. They will be 
helping to foster dialogue with the Poles and to help them feel more safe and 
secure in the area,” he said.

Two Polish officers are also currently on secondment to the Metropolitan 
police in London.

After a visit to Harlow last week at which the deployment of the officers was 
discussed, Col Rafał Batkowski, director of international cooperation with the 
Polish state police, said: “We wanted to get an assurance that appropriate 
measures are being taken to ensure that the Polish community in Essex feels 
safe and secure.”

Eric Hind, a Harlow-based Pole who organised a protest march in the town after 
Jóźwik’s killing, was sceptical about the move.

“I welcome everyone who wants to help with this complex problem, but I haven’t 
noticed the difference. I really hope I can see them back on the street at 11pm 
tonight actually doing something for the community, dealing with things and not 
just posing for selfies.” Hind pointed out that Poles were still being attacked 
in the UK.

“Many feel let down by the British government. We made the UK our home, but we 
don’t feel welcome here anymore. People are scared and worried.”

Four teenage boys have been arrested following an allegedly racist attack on a 
Polish man in Leeds. They will be questioned over an attack on a 28-year-old 
man who was kicked and punched by a gang in Armley on Friday night.


The Polish embassy said it was aware of more than 29 attacks on Poles in the 
UK since the referendum. They include an arson attack on the home of Polish 
family in Plymouth in July and the assaults of Polish men in Yeovil and St Ives.

The Polish embassy is encouraging Poles to report all suspected hate crimes to 
the police.

Poland’s ambassador the UK, Arkady Rzegocki, welcomed Juncker’s remarks. He 
said: “We appreciate that the European commission shares our concern for the 
safety of the Polish nationals in the United Kingdom. We hope that more could 
be done to inform and educate about the positive contribution of EU migrants to 
the British culture, society, and economy.”
