Women who have abortions should be punished if the practice were illegal, 
Republican presidential frontrunnerDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> said on Wednesday, before 
retracting his claim amid an outcry.


Trump, who has held opposing positions on the abortion in the past, said women 
should receive “some form of punishment” if it were banned in the US. He was 
unable to say whether he believed the punishment should be a small fine or a 
long prison sentence.

The remarks prompted an outcry from all quarters, and once again underscored 
his poor approval ratings among women. The Democratic frontrunner, Hillary 
Clinton, decribed the comments as “horrific and telling”. Anti-abortion 
campaigners, who focus their efforts on punishing those who carry out 
abortions, distanced themselves from the remarks.

Amid the storm, Trump issued a swift clarification of the comments. His 
position “had not changed”, he said, despite going on to fully recant the 
earlier statements he made to interviewer Chris Matthews on MSNBC.

The latest Trump conflagration began during the taping of a town hall event, 
when Matthews asked him to define his “pro-life” stance and assertions that 
abortion should be banned.

“Do you believe in punishment for abortion – yes or no – as a principle,” 
asked Matthews.

“The answer is there has to be some form of punishment,” said Trump.

“For the woman?” Matthews said.

“Yeah, there has to be some form,” Trump replied.

“Ten cents, 10 years, what,” Matthews asked again, pressing.

“That I don’t know,” said Trump.

 Trump’s hazy stance on abortion ‘punishment’ 
The 90-second exchange inflamed Democratic pro-choice advocates, Republicans 
who have criticized Trump for flip-flopping on the issue, and anti-abortion 
advocates.


In a 1999 interview, Trump described himself as “pro-choice in every respect 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsOlXidHXRE>”, and also said he would not “ban 
abortion” if he was ever elected president. But his position as a presidential 
candidate has changed starkly.


Trump later tried to clarify his position in a statement.

However, he seemed to acknowledge that the establishment of any anti-abortion 
law would fall to Congress or state legislatures.

“If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal 
courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion 
under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this 
illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The 
woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not 
changed – like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions,” the statement 
said.

it couldn’t get worse. Horrific and telling.”

Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the political arm of America’s best-known 
abortion provider, said the statements were tantamount to an incitement of 
violence.

The Susan B Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, attempted to clarify the 
position of the anti-abortion lobby, calling Trump a “convert” to the movement.

“[Let] us be clear: punishment is solely for the abortionist who profits off 
of the destruction of one life and the grave wounding of another,” said 
president Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement.

The exchange prompted immediate questions for other Republican candidates 
about how they would enforce an “abortion ban”.

Ohio governor and Republican nominee hopeful John Kasich told Chuck Todd the 
same afternoon that punishing women who have illegal abortions, in the 
hypothetical situation that there were a ban, was not “an appropriate response”.

“Absolutely not, and I mean I do have exceptions for rape, incest and the life 
of the mother,” Kasich said.

Todd asked how an “abortion ban” would be enforced. 

“Well, look,” said Kasich, “I think [the exceptions are] rape, incest, life of 
the mother, and perhaps you build some restrictions, but I think you have to be 
very careful in the way you do it.”

 Trump’s comments 
In a statement issued by his campaign, Ted Cruz dismissed Trump’s remarks as a 
cry for attention.

“Once again Donald Trump has demonstrated that he hasn’t seriously thought 
through the issues, and he’ll say anything just to get attention,” the 
Republican presidential candidate said. “On the important issue of the sanctity 
of life, what’s far too often neglected is that being pro-life is not simply 
about the unborn child; it’s also about the mother – and creating a culture 
that respects her and embraces life. Of course we shouldn’t be talking about 
punishing women; we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they 
have to bring life into the world.”
