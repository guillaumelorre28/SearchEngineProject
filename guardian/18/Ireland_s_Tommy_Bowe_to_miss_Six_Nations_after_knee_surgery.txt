Ulster confirmed Bowe will be sidelined for at least six months. “Tommy 
sustained posterior cruciate ligament and meniscal injuries to his right knee,” 
Ulster said. “He had successful surgery to repair the damage and he will be 
ruled out for at least six months.”

Ulster also provided updates on two more of their injured Ireland 
internationals – the lock Iain Henderson (hand) and the centre Jared Payne 
(foot).

“Iain will undergo surgery to stabilise a joint in his hand, which was also 
injured in the Argentina fixture. He will be of action for approximately six 
weeks,” Ulster said. “Jared’s fractured foot was stabilised through successful 
surgery. Ulster is awaiting his first post-operative review, after which a 
prognosis will be known.”
