La La Land
This year’s Oscars best picture frontrunner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/18/la-la-land-tipped-for-oscars-glory-after-win-at-toronto-film-festival>
, La La Land might – on the face of it – sound like a classic piece of 
awards-courting. It’s a love story between aspiring performers in LA, and a 
musical to boot. Yet, that isn’t to reckon withthe kinetic energy of Damien 
“Whiplash” Chazelle’s direction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/damien-chazelle-la-la-land-interview-toronto-film-festival-tiff-venice-telluride>
, as well as the almost preposterous chemistry between leads Ryan Gosling and 
Emma Stone.
On general release from Friday 13 Jan

TV

No Offence
Among a phalanx of po-faced police procedurals, Paul “Shameless” Abbott’s 
series stands apart. Here’s a rare cop drama that’s up for having a laugh, as 
best exemplified byJoanna Scanlon’s gloriously bawdy DI Deering 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/04/no-offence-joanna-scanlan-paul-abbott-female-police-sexual-being>
. She and the show are back for series two.
Continues Wednesday 11 Jan, 9pm, Channel 4

A welcome return for Michaela Coel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/01/michaela-cole-interview-bafta-tv-people-think-i-am-fearless>
’s smutty but sweet sitcom, which documents the sexual frustrations of a 
religious young woman in Tower Hamlets. Last time we saw Tracey she had just 
been chucked out of her mum’s house and had upended her sister’s wedding, so 
there’s tidying up to be done as this second series begins, though that’s 
unlikely to slow the show’s steady stream of gags.
Begins Thursday 12 Jan, 10pm, E4

Podcasts

Beautiful/Anonymous
Chris Gethard’s podcast mines reliably awkward terrain: calls from anonymous 
listeners. The catch? He can’t hang up no matter how strange it gets. A 
bonkers, brills listen.

 Listen to On Hold by the xx. 
After nearly four years of radio silence, the band who merged indie with 
minimal electronica to such stratospherically successful effect 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/09/the-xx-coexist-review> are 
releasing their third album, I See You. Teaser single On Hold sees the band 
combine their trademark slow and spacious sound with the rapturous sampling 
that will be familiar to fans of Jamie xx’s solo career. On Hold, maybe, but 
certainly not stuck in the mud.

Exhibitions

Beyond Boundaries
Situated amid a whopping 500 acres of rural hillside, Yorkshire Sculpture Park 
is home to more than 100 works of art. But head into its Bothy Gallery and 
you’ll find even more. Beyond Boundaries: Art By Email explores political 
situations outside the UK. Pieces have been emailed over by artists who can’t 
freely leave their countries. The hypnotising Deer On The Road by Kurdish 
photographer Sabr Dri features alongside various other images.
At Bothy Gallery, Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield, until Sunday 5 Mar 
<http://www.ysp.co.uk/exhibitions/beyond-boundaries-art-by-email>

Turner In January
When Henry Vaughan left his collection of Turner watercolours to the Scottish 
National Gallery, he did so on the condition they be exhibited for free every 
January. His wishes have been honoured ever since; witness this great Scottish 
tradition.
At Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, until Tuesday 31 Jan

Clubs

Fabric opening parties
The London club’s reopening comes with plenty of caveats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/21/fabric-nightclub-to-reopen-under-strict-new-licensing-conditions>
 (ID scanners at the door and more CCTV cameras), but after the efforts of the 
club and its dance music fans with their #SaveOurCulture campaign, there is 
plenty to be cheered about. Chiefly that nightlife is not dead.
At Fabric, EC1M, Friday 6 Jan to Sunday 8 Jan
