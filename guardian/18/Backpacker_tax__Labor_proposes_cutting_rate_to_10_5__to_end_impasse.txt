Labor has agreed to support the government’s backpacker tax legislation if the 
proposed rate is cut from 19% to 10.5%.

The opposition also wants to scrap the proposed $5 increase to the charge for 
all travellers leaving Australia.

Labor will move an amendment to the bills in the Senate and will support the 
rest of the package if those two changes are accepted.

The Labor leader, Bill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten>, said on Tuesday the 
tax impasse was a “complete mess of the government’s making” and it now had an 
opportunity to fix things.

But the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, has dismissed Labor’s proposal, 
saying it is designed to create chaos and dissent.


“They revel in the problems, they revel in the intrigue, they revel in 
creating chaos,” he said. “They know full well what their objective is.”

The Greens’ Treasury spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, said the Greens would 
propose its own amendment to the government’s bills before it considers Labor’s 
plan.

“We’d rather see no tax on backpackers, or [to see] them pay the same tax as 
Australians pay,” he said. “But if 10.5% is the best compromise we can get then 
that’s something we’ll consider.”

Chris Bowen, the shadow treasurer, said Labor’s proposed amendments would have 
to be passed by the House of Representatives, and that meant political pressure 
was now on the Nationals.

“National party MPs will have the choice,” he said. “Do they support 19%, or 
do they support 10.5%? And they need to explain to their electorates, if they 
vote for 19%, why they do.

“The pressure is on individual National party members of parliament and we’ll 
be pointing that out.”

Bowen said Labor’s proposal to cut the backpacker tax to 10.5% would cost the 
budget $205m over four years, and it would cost $260m over four years to scrap 
the $5 passenger movement charge. But that would be more than offset by the 
$1.4bn in savings from its superannuation announcement.

“We are net ahead in our announcements today. We are being extremely fiscally 
responsible in our approach to these matters,” he said.

Sarah McKinnon, from the National Farmers’ Federation, criticised the latest 
policy development: “We want it fixed this week. We want certainty in the 
parliament this week.

“We need all parties to come together, to claim that bipartisanship that they 
say so strongly they support, to support Australian farmers ... to deliver 
certainty.”

The fight over the backpacker tax has been going on for 18 months.

It started with the former Abbott government’s 2015 budget, which proposed 
raising the income tax onworking holidaymakers from 13% to 32.5% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/12/budget-savings-hit-surprising-targets-backpackers-and-fly-in-fly-out-workers>
.

The idea was dormant for over a year before Malcolm Turnbull announced a 
review of the tax in the leadup to this year’s election.

In September, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced a 19% tax rate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/27/backpacker-tax-scott-morrison-announces-cut-from-325-to-19>
, with a $5 increase in the passenger movement charge to $60. To balance the 
package, the government also proposed to reduce the visa application charge by 
$50, increase the working holiday visa age from 30 to 35, and increase the time 
backpackers could work for one employer from six to 12 months.

 Uncertainty over the tax rate for backpackers has angered the agricultural 
industry, with farmers saying it has made it much harder to attract workers.

Joyce said if Labor did not support the government’s proposal to cut the 
backpacker tax from 32.5% to 19%, the tax would remain at 32.5% from 1 January, 
2017.

But Whish-Wilson said there was no reason why that should be the case, 
according to advice from the parliamentary library and answers from Treasury 
and the tax office.

“Let me tell you, Barnaby standing up here and saying that the default is 
going to be 32.5% is absolutely bullshit, it’s not the case,” Whish-Wilson said.

“Some backpackers will be legally entitled to pay no tax for their first 
$18,200 [earned], depending on their residency.

“The only way this [current 32.5% tax] could become the default rate is if the 
AustralianTax <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tax-australia> Office 
decides to crack down on this issue of residency, do audits, and actually seek 
the revenue.”

The Labor Senator Chris Ketter, who was deputy chair of the Senate committee 
that investigated the backpacker tax 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/BackpackerTaxBill2016>
, said Labor’s proposal would be a win for farmers and tourism operators.


“I participated in a number of hearings on the backpacker tax and it was clear 
to me that the government had failed to properly consult with stakeholders,” he 
said. “They even failed to consult Treasury with regards to economic 
forecasting.

“The original rate of 32.5% was clearly too much and their alternative 
proposal of 19% was rushed,” he said.

The committee will deliver its report on the backpacker tax on Wednesday.

But Nationals MP Andrew Broad, a strong critic of the 32.5% tax rate, 
criticised Labor’s proposal to cut the rate to 10.5%, saying it would give 
foreign workers a better deal than Australian workers.

He said Joel Fitzgibbon, the Shadow Agriculture Minister, would not be taken 
seriously by the sector after Tuesday’s announcement because he was clearly 
playing politics with the issue.

Broad said no Nationals MP would vote for Labor’s amendments if they made it 
to the lower house.
