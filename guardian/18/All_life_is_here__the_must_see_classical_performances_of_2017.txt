Great Brits: BBC National Orchestra of Wales

BBCNOW <http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcnow> begins the year celebrating some of the 
UK’s most distinctive and boundary-pushing contemporary voices:Steve Martland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/08/steve-martland>, Gavin Bryars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/gavin-bryars>, Michael Nyman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/michael-nyman> and Howard Skempton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/18/howard-skempton-composer-james-weeks>
 among them. A great initiative to revisit some modern classics, let down only 
by an exclusively male lineup across two concerts.

Last Supper. 
Birtwistle’s The Last Supper

A rare opportunity to hear Birtwistle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/harrison-birtwistle>’s highly ritualistic 
opera, in the British composer’s 83rd year. A millennial commission premiered 
by conductor Daniel Barenboim in Berlin in 2000 and then seen at Glyndebourne’s 
summer festival, it has not been performed in the UK since. TheBBC Scottish 
Symphony Orchestra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/bbc-scottish-symphony-orchestra>’s concert 
will be semi-staging the work (libretto by the late Canadian poet Robin 
Blaser): Roderick Williams sings Christ, Jennifer Johnston the single female 
role – the Ghost.Martyn Brabbins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/21/english-national-opera-appoints-martyn-brabbins-music-director>

are free, and it’s being recorded for future broadcast.

Ryan Wigglesworth: The Winter’s Tale

With ENO needing to prove its singular value, and both its artistic director 
and head of music only months into their respective roles, all eyes will be on 
the Coliseum for this, the company’s only new commission of the season, and 
composer-in-residenceWigglesworth 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/da555bd2-4215-4b0b-9639-39c7097809a6>’s 
first full-scale opera. The composer will conduct andRory Kinnear 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rory-kinnear> – also making his operatic 
debut – directs Shakespeare’s late romance. A strong cast includesIain Paterson 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Paterson>, Sophie Bevan 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Bevan> and Susan Bickley

Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Royal Opera House, London

There’s been plenty of opportunity of late to hear Wagner’s grand comic opera, 
with productions in Wales, Glyndebourne and two in London. But the presence of
Bryn Terfel <https://www.theguardian.com/music/bryn-terfel> as cobbler Hans 
Sachs, world-weary but wise, andAntonio Pappano 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/antonio-pappano> in the pit, should ensure 
tickets disappear fast.Kasper Holten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/09/kasper-holten-to-quit-royal-opera-covent-garden>
 directs – his final production as Covent Garden’s director of opera. With 
Wagner’s drama of an artist battling a blinkered and tradition-loving 
establishment, will Holten be having the last laugh against his critics?
• Royal Opera House, London

, 11-31 March.
