Kanye West <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest> has explained his 
decision to disrupt Beck’s acceptance speech after the American indie singer 
took home the Grammy for Album of the Year.

“Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce>,” West said in an interview with E! 
after the ceremony. “At this point we tired of it because what happens is when 
you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in 
the face after they deliver monumental feats in music, you’re disrespectful to 
inspiration.

“We aren’t playing with them anymore. And by the way, I got my wife, my 
daughter, and I got my clothing line, so I’m not going to do nothing that would 
put my daughter at risk, but I am here to fight for creativity. That’s the 
reason why I didn’t say anything tonight, but you all knew what it meant when 
’Ye stepped on that stage.”

His brief stage invasion at Sunday night’s Grammy awards at first seemed like 
a nod to his famous interruption of Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the 
2009 MTV VMAs. However, it was one again a defence of Beyoncé.
