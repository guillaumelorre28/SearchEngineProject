Anyone who dares to cross Elvis Costello

 is in for big trouble. He always takes revenge.


The latest people to feel the wrath of this small man with glasses are the 
music-business moguls who overlooked him in the past.

“I bear a grudge, I’m vindictive,” he admits. “And I couldn’t care less 
whether this attitude is damaging to me or not because I’d like to take them 
all to bits and rain havoc on them. They deserve it. They deserve me. They 
deserve everything they get. I think the whole of the music business stinks.”

, in case you hadn’t heard, is this year’s brightest hope for pop stardom. With 
his first album, My Aim Is True, in the Top 20, a national tour with the slogan 
“Dumping music on the people” ready to begin on 3 October, and a spot on Top of 
the Pops, Elvis Costello is kicking the sand back in a lot of people’s faces.

“The story about me having a little black book with the names of people I 
dislike is not true,” he confesses. “But I do note in my head people who have 
crossed me and I have a tendency to pay them back if I can.

“Sometimes it’s physical. It’s not necessarily violent, but you can play all 
kinds of games on people. Then, again, sometimes it’s a mental game and that 
can be more damaging,” says the man who looks like a stand-in for Woody Allen.

“This vindictiveness is an element of my character. It’s not necessarily a 
good thing, I wouldn’t hold it up as a virtue and I find it quite hard to live 
with sometimes. But you can only be what you are. You can force other things 
but sooner or later your natural tendencies will surface.”

Yet Costello refuses to talk about his early years struggling to be heard and 
why he’s out for revenge on the people who passed him up.

“I don’t see any point in talking about what happened to me before I got 
involved with Stiff [his present record label], because it’s dead and gone now. 
Talking about it won’t bring it back, it won’t make it right, so it’s best not 
to mention it because I only sound bitter if I do.”

For the curious, I understand Mr D P Costello is a former computer operator 
from Whitton, near Twickenham, where he lives with his wife and one child.

He once worked as resident support act at the Marquee and also played 
acoustically in the Earl’s Court coffee bar the Troubadour.

Point is, Costello’s songs have not changed. His songs about “Natasha who 
looks like Elsie” (from I Don’t Want to Go to Chelsea) or the anti-fascist Less 
Than Zero have always been his stock-in-trade.

He says: “I’ve been in the music business for some time in the sense that I’ve 
been trying. I’ve been on the periphery of it without getting anyone to take me 
seriously.”

But now they are, Costello is going to make the most of things.

“Things are easy to take in the music business, you just grab ’em. It’s not 
hard at all. Of course, things have changed. I never used to fly down from 
Glasgow to London to do a TV show and then fly back to Edinburgh. But I am 
enjoying it.”

Is Elvis Costello <https://www.theguardian.com/music/elviscostello> the weedy 
man with glasses kicking back at everyone who snubbed him? Or is he a cold 
calculating pop star aware that 1977 needs an antihero?

He denies it with one short expletive.

Even so, he has to keep you guessing: “If someone gets the impression of me as 
the patron saint of losers, they’re going to get a big shock. I don’t intend to 
pander to any particular image.”

And it’s evident by the way he accepts his spot on Top of the Pops – the 
ultimate TV show of establishment pop.

“It doesn’t bother me because it’s straight to the throat. I’m the opposite of 
that hippie idea.

“People sit down moaning about how bad Top of the Pops is – and how the 
radio’s rubbish – while not doing anything to put it right.”

Elvis Costello aims to change things, and if someone gets kicked down while 
he’s doing it that’s the price they have to pay. But optimistic about his own 
future?

“I’ll tell you that when I get there,” he replies.
