A northern California <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california> man 
photographed snow from an avalanche bursting through his front door as the 
state continued to battle storms.


Steven Siig from Alpine Meadows, North Lake Tahoe, said he was hunkered down 
with his three children, wife and large German shepherd after a controlled 
avalanche set off by ski patrol encased his home in snow on Tuesday.


The independent cinematographer, producer and theatre owner said he had 
received plenty of offers to help and places to stay after posting photos of 
the avalanche aftermath on social media.

Siig said he had seen a few major avalanches while living in the house but 
this may have been the biggest. But he said he felt safe because he was warned 
it was coming.

The California highway patrol in nearby Truckee confirmed the Alpine Meadows 
ski patrol had been setting off controlled avalanches.

Forecasters predicted up to 7ft of snow around the resorts of Lake Tahoe as a 
heavy blizzrd passed through.

Many ski resorts shut down on Tuesday because of the storm and some remained 
closed on Wednesday.
