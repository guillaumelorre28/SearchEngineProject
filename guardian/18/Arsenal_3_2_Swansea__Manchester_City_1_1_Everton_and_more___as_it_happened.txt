Thoughts on a crazy match at the Etihad:

Jim Nolan emails: “I couldn’t believe it when I didn’t see Kelechi ‘Ice-Cool’ 
Iheanacho stepping up to take our penalty. Horses for courses, and all that!”

“Man City is playing 3 at the back for the first time under Pep Guardiola this 
season,” emails Ashwin. “Seems like Pep was expecting Koeman to press like 
Spurs did, and he decided to have that extra man at the back line to wriggle 
out of tough situations. But, it doesn’t seem to be producing the desired 
result at the other end of the field so far.”

Simon McMahon emails: “Dundee United currently leading 1-0 at St. Mirren 
thanks to Scott Fraser’s first half strike. Morton are 4-0 up at previously 
unbeaten Queen of the South and Falkirk lead Dunfermline 2-0. Celtic, Aberdeen 
and Partick Thistle all ahead at home. In the Angus derby Arbroath are 1-0 up

Red card! Arsenal 3-2 Swansea (Xhaka)

Granit Xhaka takes one for the team hoping to pick up a yellow as he cynically 
breaks up a quick Swansea break, but it’s deemed a straight red and he’s off! 
Can Swansea turn this game on its head?

Steve McClaren’s second coming at Derby begins with a win against Leeds, 
Preston scored late to salvage a 2-2 draw at Brighton, Fulham put four past 
Barnsley and Newcastle hit Brentford for three. Norwich jump to the top of the 
table after a 3-1 win against Rotherham, who remain bottom.

Another disappointing day for David Moyes whose side continue to search for 
their first league win of the season, but welcome relief for Stoke who get 
theirs.
 
Mike Phelan will be glad he got his signature on that contract before this 
debacle. A brilliant day for Bournemouth, mind, whose fine form continues.
 
Dele Alli’s late equaliser saves Spurs from defeat having dominated the game. 
 
A stunning performance by Maarten Stekelenburg, with two saved penalties, 
helps Ronald Koeman’s side to a point.
 
A fun start to life in the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> for Bob Bradley but 
unfortunately no points to take back to south Wales.
 
Championship

Simon Makienok has scored deep into injury time at the Amex to give Preston a 
handy point against Brighton.
 
Scotland

“As things stand,” emails Simon McMahon, “Dundee go bottom of the Premiership 
after a defeat at Hearts, and only 4 points separate the top five teams in the
Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> after leaders 
Queen of the South lost 5-0 at home to Morton, and Dundee United won 2-0 at St. 
Mirren.”
 
Five minutes of added time at The Hawthorns...
 
Championship

Norwich are heading to the top of the table, Steven Naismith putting the 
Canaries 3-1 up against struggling Rotherham with only a couple of minutes left 
on the clock.
 
Spurs do break through! It’s a deft Dele Alli finish. Is there time for a 
winner?

Where’s that terrific emoji of a monkey covering its eyes when you need it. 
 
Nacer Chadli is replaced at The Hawthorns and Craig Gardner comes on for West 
Brom. Tony Pulis is not going for the second goal, that’s for sure. It is 
looking a tough ask for Spurs to break through.
 
Moussa Dembele strikes from the penalty spot and Celtic are 2-0 up at home to 
Motherwell, and will stay four points clear at the top.

6 - Nacer Chadli has had a hand in six goals in his five PL games for West 
Brom (4 goals, 2 assists). Haunting.

Walcott goes close again but can’t find the finish and Swansea are still very 
much in this thriller at the Emirates. Up at the Etihad, Manchester City are 
trying desperately to break down Everton but Koeman’s boys aren’t budging.
 
Oh, Hull.

Spurs punished for not taking their chances at The Hawthorns, and looks who’s 
got it!

Victor Anichebe is on for Sunderland as they try to turn around their 2-0 
deficit at Stoke. Seems unlikely. Vigo Anichebe?
 
It’s full-time in the Bundesliga where Marco Fabian saved a point for 
Frankfurt against Bayern Munich:

Messi comes on. Messi Scores. Barcelona 4-0 Deportivo. 
 
Thoughts on a crazy match at the Etihad:

Jim Nolan emails: “I couldn’t believe it when I didn’t see Kelechi ‘Ice-Cool’ 
Iheanacho stepping up to take our penalty. Horses for courses, and all that!”

“Man City is playing 3 at the back for the first time under Pep Guardiola this 
season,” emails Ashwin. “Seems like Pep was expecting Koeman to press like 
Spurs did, and he decided to have that extra man at the back line to wriggle 
out of tough situations. But, it doesn’t seem to be producing the desired 
result at the other end of the field so far.”
 
Simon McMahon emails: “Dundee United currently leading 1-0 at St. Mirren 
thanks to Scott Fraser’s first half strike. Morton are 4-0 up at previously 
unbeaten Queen of the South and Falkirk lead Dunfermline 2-0. Celtic, Aberdeen 
and Partick Thistle all ahead at home. In the Angus derby Arbroath are 1-0 up 
against league leaders Forfar, who are down to 10 men. They’ll be dancing into 
the North Sea if it remains like that.”

 
Granit Xhaka takes one for the team hoping to pick up a yellow as he cynically 
breaks up a quick Swansea break, but it’s deemed a straight red and he’s off! 
Can Swansea turn this game on its head?
 
No matter, as moments later David Silva finds the substitute Nolito and City 
get the equaliser. What a finish in store.

Wow. Wow. Wow. Sergio Aguero misses his fourth penalty of the season, Maarten 
Stekelenburg makes his second penalty save of this game, and somehow Everton 
remain in front at the Etihad!
