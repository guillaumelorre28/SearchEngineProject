Lions 6-26 Seahawks, Final

Seattle move on, they will face Atlanta next week, and the winner of the 
Giants Packers game tomorrow will head to Dallas.

Game ball to Rawls who set a franchise record tonight with 161 rushing yards - 
who had that three hours ago?

That will do it for our coverage, we’ll be back tomorrow for more live NFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> Wild Card match-ups, but for now, from 
all of us here are Guardian sport, good morning, good afternoon and goodnight.

Lions 6-26 Seahawks, 1:18 4th quarter

Michael Bennett has a sack that he will provide a great quote about in about 
10 minutes.

Stafford is incomplete on 4th & 13 and that will do it for Detroit.

WARNING! Lions 6-26 Seahawks, 1:56 4th quarter

It’s gar-bage time in Seattle, Stafford is chucking it around, scrambling, 
being sacked and is at midfield.

You have to feel for the guy: he was having what some consider to be an MVP 
season before suffering an injury to his right middle finger. Now he’s heading 
home after a foul ending to the season.

TOUCHDOWN! Lions 6-26 Seahawks, 3:36 4th quarter

Here’s something I haven’t seen before. Kearse is about to make a TD catch and 
Baldwin, who is right there, reaches out and takes it instead!

So it looks like Seattle are going to cover that eight point spread, for those 
of you gambling at home.


Extra point is good.

Lions 6-19 Seahawks, 3:43 4th quarter

Wilson rolls out on 3rd & 9 and hits Baldwin who makes a spectacular catch, 
keeping the ball above the turf, somehow. Except the refs rule the play 
incomplete, sparking Seahawks coach Pete Carroll to challenge the play.


This should be overruled. And it is. First down at the 14 after a 10-yard gain.


Detroit get zero breaks.

Lions 6-19 Seahawks, 4:25 4th quarter


Another third down, Seattle need five. They get more after a terrific 
one-handed catch by Richardson on the far sideline! He’s having the best night 
of his season, drawing comparisons to Odell Beckham thanks to his uni-arm 
approach to catching. That’s a 27-yard gain to the Detroit 40.

Then Tavon Wilson gets done for roughing the passer, Russell Wilson. Seattle 
are at the Lions 25.


Seattle RB Collins is shaken up on a play, momentarily halting the inevitable. 


It’s 2nd & 7 at the 21 when we return.

Lions 6-19 Seahawks, 5:50 4th quarter


Seattle are into clock run down mode here. It’s 3rd & 3, Wilson goes to the 
air from the shotgun and quickly fires to Baldwin on the far sideline, that’s a 
first down which will suck more time off the clock. Seattle at their 28.

Lions 6-19 Seahawks, 7:51 4th quarter

NBC TV here in the US remind us of the eight comeback victories Detroit have 
enjoyed this season. All of those came before Stafford’s finger issues, of 
course.

Stafford hits Tate over the middle for 19, but then almost hits Shead, his 
opponent in what should have been a pick, surely.

Now he’s incomplete looking downfield for Ebron, and now it’s 3rd & 10. 

Stafford hit as he throws over the middle intended for Boldin, incomplete, 
fourth down.


They’re punting, Hester calls for a fair catch at the 16.

Dissatisfaction in Detroit:
Russell Brown (@Russell_Brown51) 
That's game. Thank you Boldin, Ngata, Ebron and Tate. Oh and referees, you 
know who you are. Thank you Stafford for a great year.

TOUCHDOWN! Lions 6-19 Seahawks, 8:49 4th quarter

Rawls enjoys great work from his center Ott and strolls into pay-dirt. 


And after an eight play, 82-yard drive in 4:03, this one is just about over, 
even if Hauschka misses the extra point.

Lions 6-13 Seahawks, 9:20 4th quarter


Wilson audibles into the shotgun and then hits Graham on a little slant to the 
TE Graham. Slick play call and now it’s on the four.

Lions 6-13 Seahawks, 10:16 4th quarter

Baldwin is by himself over the middle - yikes! First down, and that is an 
opportunity missed. Seattle up to the 35...or actually the Lions 23!

Baldwin again is away down the far sideline and makes a great grab for a gain 
of 42! That is a huge play in this game - Wilson has been much better this 
half, not that there was anywhere to go but up...

OK, I overreacted on Boldin. They should not cut him right now, but he should 
receive a stiff talking to after the game - he knows better!

Quickly, it’s 3rd & 5. Big play for Detroit coming up.

Lions 6-13 Seahawks, 12:57 4th quarter

Detroit start at their 16 after Roberts was manhandled by Johnson on the 
kickoff: thrown right on his back he was. Gulp.


First play from scrimmage - Boldin is hit with another personal foul. Are you 
kidding me? He should be cut, immediately.


That is bananas.


Stafford goes deep looking for Jones but it’s too deep and not catch-able, so 
no pass interference call after Jones was obstructed.

It’s 3rd & 17, and now Boldin makes a catch on the far sideline, short of the 
first down and Detroit has to punt. Boldin fails to shove anyone aft3er the 
play, somehow.


Punt: Seattle have it at their 18. Can Detroit’s D make a play or what?

FIELD GOAL! Lions 6-13 Seahawks, 14:12 4th quarter

It’s good. 


That would be a potential momentum point for Detroit if they could actually 
get to the endzone. Alas...they’ll need three kicks to win, and I’m not sure 
there’s enough time.

Lions 6-10 Seahawks, 14:30 4th quarter

Rawls slips - it’s 3rd down and goal, they need six to get six. 


Wilson throws over the middle - Quin breaks up the pass and Detroit survive a 
big moment here, holding Seattle.


It’s a 27-yard attempt for Hauschka.

Lions 6-10 Seahawks, end of 3rd quarter

Rawls is back now, and Wilson finds him in the middle immediately. It’s a 
short gain of about a yard and sets up a 4rd and 6, that is until Ngata throws 
a post-play shoulder at Ifedi - flag flies, Seahawks get 15 yards and that puts 
this ball to the Detroit nine.


Not smart. 


Baldwin, a little three-yard grab from Wilson on the far side moves the pill 
to the six, and that’s the end of the quarter.


second and goal to go for Seattle.

Lions 6-10 Seahawks, 2:41 3rd quarter

Baldwin, a nifty sideline catch for six, a little run by Rawls, and now it’s 
3rd & short. Can Detroit’s D make a stop?


Nope - Rawls is rambling all over the field - left, right, forwards, 
backwards, and when it’s all said and done, and Russell makes an illegal block 
(not called) it’s a 32 yard gain down to Detroit’s 34!


That incidentally, is the opposite of a big Detroit stop. 


It’s not all good news for Seattle - Rawls is shaken up on the play, one that 
puts him over 150 yards on the night.


It was a helmet to helmet hit, with Whitehead so we don’t know if he’ll make 
it back. It didn’t look great.

Since Detroit can’t manage more than three, they sure could use a 
game-changing play from the defense. Now seems like as good a time as any.

Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 4:06 3rd quarter


Stafford has time - looks for Tate, and the throw is high. Fourth down, here 
comes Prater.


Maybe they can win this thing with kicks after all?

Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 4:10 3rd quarter


More from Stafford, it’s Tate again, this time for 13 yards, and after a 
little run by Zenner, Detroit are at the Seahawks 41.


Lions offense hanging in there despite the usual mistakes on this drive - 
here’s another completion - it’s Zenner (he’s everywhere), setting up a 3rd & 2.

Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 6:04 3rd quarter

First down! The former Seahawks wideout, Golden Tate, makes the catch in the 
middle, sidesteps and is ahead for just enough!


Now Shead is penalized for illegal hands to the face, a lucky break after 
Jones drops yet another Stafford pass!

Zenner ahead for a yard. It’s 2nd & 9. 

Stafford, shotgun, he’s chased, throws to Zenner who barely realized the pass 
was coming - he makes a terrific catch considering! That’s a first down, up to 
their own 44-yard line!

Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 8:57 3rd quarter


Zenner rumbles up for four yards to provide Stafford some space from the goal 
line.


Then Stafford in the shotgun, two pump fakes, runs towards the near sideline 
and gets out of bounds at the 11. That makes it third and about four.

big 3rd & 11.

Wilson, back to pass, steps up in the dissolving pocket quickly and is TAKEN 
DOWN! That’s Ansah who got to Wilson for the sack and it pushes Seattle back 
out of field goal range!

That’s the good news for Detroit. The bad news is that Seattle just punted the 
ball inside the Lions five-yard line, where they’ll try to kick their offense 
into gear in their first possession of the second half.

Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 11:36 3rd quarter


Jimmy Graham, backing in over the middle, has the pill for a first down at the 
Lions 34! Detroit needed a big stop there, instead Seattle are creeping towards 
the red zone.

Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 12:09 3rd quarter

Wilson pickes up the pace with a pair of completions to start the half but 
it’s Rawls with a head of steam, right up the middle for another gain, this 
time it’s for nine! How about this guy!


Richardson drops a perfect pass from Wilson on the far sideline, then the 
Hawks QB throws it away under pressure setting up a big 3rd & 10...

Stats


Seattle have 119 total yards of offense, 30 of which came on one play late in 
the half. Stafford hasn’t been a total disaster - 9/17 for 97 yards, but did 
not turn the ball over. Zenner had 26 yards on seven carries, in stark contrast 
to Rawls who ran for 107 yards on 15 carries.

Wilson has thrown for just 45 yards, which is remarkable. If not for Rawls, 
and the blown offensive interference call, where would Seattle be? Perhaps down 
3-0.

But that’s not how it works, and an early half TD by Seattle would likely be 
too much for Detroit’s lowly offense to recover from.

Seahawks get the ball to start the second half.

Lions 3-10 Seahawks, end of 2nd quarter

So that will do it - good half defensively for both sides, offensively, 
Detroit stunk and Seattle had just enough thanks to Richardson’s somewhat 
tainted circus catch.

FIELD GOAL! Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 0:20 2nd quarter

It’s good. So Detroit get three, which wouldn’t be so bad if seven didn’t seem 
so tough. They aren’t gonna win this thing with kicks.

Lions 0-10 Seahawks, 0:24 2nd quarter

Stafford is sacked, then a screen to Zenner goes nowhere. 


3rd & 9 now, Stafford throws left and can’t find Jones this time around! Drive 
stalled!


Here comes the field goal unit - it’s 51 yards for Matt Prater’s big foot.

Seattle move on, they will face Atlanta next week, and the winner of the 
Giants Packers game tomorrow will head to Dallas.

Game ball to Rawls who set a franchise record tonight with 161 rushing yards - 
who had that three hours ago?

That will do it for our coverage, we’ll be back tomorrow for more live NFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> Wild Card match-ups, but for now, from 
all of us here are Guardian sport, good morning, good afternoon and goodnight.

 
Lions 6-26 Seahawks, 1:18 4th quarter

Michael Bennett has a sack that he will provide a great quote about in about 
10 minutes.

Stafford is incomplete on 4th & 13 and that will do it for Detroit. 

 
It’s gar-bage time in Seattle, Stafford is chucking it around, scrambling, 
being sacked and is at midfield.

You have to feel for the guy: he was having what some consider to be an MVP 
season before suffering an injury to his right middle finger. Now he’s heading 
home after a foul ending to the season.




 
Here’s something I haven’t seen before. Kearse is about to make a TD catch and 
Baldwin, who is right there, reaches out and takes it instead!

So it looks like Seattle are going to cover that eight point spread, for those 
of you gambling at home.


Extra point is good. 

 
Lions 6-19 Seahawks, 3:43 4th quarter

Wilson rolls out on 3rd & 9 and hits Baldwin who makes a spectacular catch, 
keeping the ball above the turf, somehow. Except the refs rule the play 
incomplete, sparking Seahawks coach Pete Carroll to challenge the play.


This should be overruled. And it is. First down at the 14 after a 10-yard gain.


Detroit get zero breaks. 

 
Lions 6-19 Seahawks, 4:25 4th quarter


Another third down, Seattle need five. They get more after a terrific 
one-handed catch by Richardson on the far sideline! He’s having the best night 
of his season, drawing comparisons to Odell Beckham thanks to his uni-arm 
approach to catching. That’s a 27-yard gain to the Detroit 40.

Then Tavon Wilson gets done for roughing the passer, Russell Wilson. Seattle 
are at the Lions 25.


Seattle RB Collins is shaken up on a play, momentarily halting the inevitable. 


It’s 2nd & 7 at the 21 when we return. 

 
Lions 6-19 Seahawks, 5:50 4th quarter


Seattle are into clock run down mode here. It’s 3rd & 3, Wilson goes to the 
air from the shotgun and quickly fires to Baldwin on the far sideline, that’s a 
first down which will suck more time off the clock. Seattle at their 28.


 
Lions 6-19 Seahawks, 7:51 4th quarter

NBC TV here in the US remind us of the eight comeback victories Detroit have 
enjoyed this season. All of those came before Stafford’s finger issues, of 
course.

Stafford hits Tate over the middle for 19, but then almost hits Shead, his 
opponent in what should have been a pick, surely.

Now he’s incomplete looking downfield for Ebron, and now it’s 3rd & 10. 

Stafford hit as he throws over the middle intended for Boldin, incomplete, 
fourth down.


They’re punting, Hester calls for a fair catch at the 16. 

 
Dissatisfaction in Detroit:
Russell Brown (@Russell_Brown51) 
That's game. Thank you Boldin, Ngata, Ebron and Tate. Oh and referees, you 
know who you are. Thank you Stafford for a great year.

2017 <https://twitter.com/Russell_Brown51/status/817937750481584131>  
Rawls enjoys great work from his center Ott and strolls into pay-dirt. 


And after an eight play, 82-yard drive in 4:03, this one is just about over, 
even if Hauschka misses the extra point.

 
Lions 6-13 Seahawks, 9:20 4th quarter


Wilson audibles into the shotgun and then hits Graham on a little slant to the 
TE Graham. Slick play call and now it’s on the four.


 
Lions 6-13 Seahawks, 9:33 4th quarter

Another key 3rd down, Seattle need a yard. Operating from the Lions 14, Wilson 
calls time out.

 
Lions 6-13 Seahawks, 10:16 4th quarter

Baldwin is by himself over the middle - yikes! First down, and that is an 
opportunity missed. Seattle up to the 35...or actually the Lions 23!

Baldwin again is away down the far sideline and makes a great grab for a gain 
of 42! That is a huge play in this game - Wilson has been much better this 
half, not that there was anywhere to go but up...

 
Lions 6-13 Seahawks, 11:30 4th quarter

OK, I overreacted on Boldin. They should not cut him right now, but he should 
receive a stiff talking to after the game - he knows better!

Quickly, it’s 3rd & 5. Big play for Detroit coming up. 

 
Lions 6-13 Seahawks, 12:57 4th quarter

Detroit start at their 16 after Roberts was manhandled by Johnson on the 
kickoff: thrown right on his back he was. Gulp.


First play from scrimmage - Boldin is hit with another personal foul. Are you 
kidding me? He should be cut, immediately.


That is bananas.


Stafford goes deep looking for Jones but it’s too deep and not catch-able, so 
no pass interference call after Jones was obstructed.

It’s 3rd & 17, and now Boldin makes a catch on the far sideline, short of the 
first down and Detroit has to punt. Boldin fails to shove anyone aft3er the 
play, somehow.


Punt: Seattle have it at their 18. Can Detroit’s D make a play or what?

 
It’s good. 


That would be a potential momentum point for Detroit if they could actually 
get to the endzone. Alas...they’ll need three kicks to win, and I’m not sure 
there’s enough time.

 
Lions 6-10 Seahawks, 14:30 4th quarter

Rawls slips - it’s 3rd down and goal, they need six to get six. 


Wilson throws over the middle - Quin breaks up the pass and Detroit survive a 
big moment here, holding Seattle.


It’s a 27-yard attempt for Hauschka.

 
Rawls is back now, and Wilson finds him in the middle immediately. It’s a 
short gain of about a yard and sets up a 4rd and 6, that is until Ngata throws 
a post-play shoulder at Ifedi - flag flies, Seahawks get 15 yards and that puts 
this ball to the Detroit nine.


Not smart. 


Baldwin, a little three-yard grab from Wilson on the far side moves the pill 
to the six, and that’s the end of the quarter.


second and goal to go for Seattle. 

 
Lions 6-10 Seahawks, 2:41 3rd quarter

Baldwin, a nifty sideline catch for six, a little run by Rawls, and now it’s 
3rd & short. Can Detroit’s D make a stop?


Nope - Rawls is rambling all over the field - left, right, forwards, 
backwards, and when it’s all said and done, and Russell makes an illegal block 
(not called) it’s a 32 yard gain down to Detroit’s 34!


That incidentally, is the opposite of a big Detroit stop. 


It’s not all good news for Seattle - Rawls is shaken up on the play, one that 
puts him over 150 yards on the night.


It was a helmet to helmet hit, with Whitehead so we don’t know if he’ll make 
it back. It didn’t look great.

 
Analysis:

Prater is good. #Lions <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lions?src=hash>

<https://twitter.com/ethanjofes/status/817930354027794432> 
Since Detroit can’t manage more than three, they sure could use a 
game-changing play from the defense. Now seems like as good a time as any.

 
Lions 6-10 Seahawks, 4:03 3rd quarter


The kick is out of the endzone - Seattle start at their 20. 

 
Prater is true from 53 - just two more field goals and Detroit are up. 

 
Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 4:06 3rd quarter


Stafford has time - looks for Tate, and the throw is high. Fourth down, here 
comes Prater.


Maybe they can win this thing with kicks after all?


 
Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 4:10 3rd quarter


More from Stafford, it’s Tate again, this time for 13 yards, and after a 
little run by Zenner, Detroit are at the Seahawks 41.


Lions offense hanging in there despite the usual mistakes on this drive - 
here’s another completion - it’s Zenner (he’s everywhere), setting up a 3rd & 2.

 
Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 6:04 3rd quarter

First down! The former Seahawks wideout, Golden Tate, makes the catch in the 
middle, sidesteps and is ahead for just enough!


Now Shead is penalized for illegal hands to the face, a lucky break after 
Jones drops yet another Stafford pass!

Zenner ahead for a yard. It’s 2nd & 9. 

Stafford, shotgun, he’s chased, throws to Zenner who barely realized the pass 
was coming - he makes a terrific catch considering! That’s a first down, up to 
their own 44-yard line!

 
Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 8:57 3rd quarter


Zenner rumbles up for four yards to provide Stafford some space from the goal 
line.


Then Stafford in the shotgun, two pump fakes, runs towards the near sideline 
and gets out of bounds at the 11. That makes it third and about four.

 
Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 9:36 3rd quarter


Detroit stack the defensive line to stop Rawls, finally - that stop sets up a 
big 3rd & 11.

Wilson, back to pass, steps up in the dissolving pocket quickly and is TAKEN 
DOWN! That’s Ansah who got to Wilson for the sack and it pushes Seattle back 
out of field goal range!

That’s the good news for Detroit. The bad news is that Seattle just punted the 
ball inside the Lions five-yard line, where they’ll try to kick their offense 
into gear in their first possession of the second half.


 
Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 11:36 3rd quarter


Jimmy Graham, backing in over the middle, has the pill for a first down at the 
Lions 34! Detroit needed a big stop there, instead Seattle are creeping towards 
the red zone.


 
Lions 3-10 Seahawks, 12:09 3rd quarter

Wilson pickes up the pace with a pair of completions to start the half but 
it’s Rawls with a head of steam, right up the middle for another gain, this 
time it’s for nine! How about this guy!


Richardson drops a perfect pass from Wilson on the far sideline, then the 
Hawks QB throws it away under pressure setting up a big 3rd & 10...

 
Seattle start at their 20 after a touchback...

 
Stats


Seattle have 119 total yards of offense, 30 of which came on one play late in 
the half. Stafford hasn’t been a total disaster - 9/17 for 97 yards, but did 
not turn the ball over. Zenner had 26 yards on seven carries, in stark contrast 
to Rawls who ran for 107 yards on 15 carries.

Wilson has thrown for just 45 yards, which is remarkable. If not for Rawls, 
and the blown offensive interference call, where would Seattle be? Perhaps down 
3-0.

But that’s not how it works, and an early half TD by Seattle would likely be 
too much for Detroit’s lowly offense to recover from.

Seahawks get the ball to start the second half.

<https://twitter.com/martybeneteau/status/817921908448624642> 
It doesn’t say it all, but it says a lot. 

 
So that will do it - good half defensively for both sides, offensively, 
Detroit stunk and Seattle had just enough thanks to Richardson’s somewhat 
tainted circus catch.

 
It’s good. So Detroit get three, which wouldn’t be so bad if seven didn’t seem 
so tough. They aren’t gonna win this thing with kicks.

 
Lions 0-10 Seahawks, 0:24 2nd quarter

Stafford is sacked, then a screen to Zenner goes nowhere. 


3rd & 9 now, Stafford throws left and can’t find Jones this time around! Drive
