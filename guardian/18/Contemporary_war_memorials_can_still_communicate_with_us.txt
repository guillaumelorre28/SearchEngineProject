hatred in Europe and asks whether it could be that the works themselves are too 
modern or abstract to communicate with the public.

At 14-18 NOW <https://www.1418now.org.uk/>, we create contemporary memorials 
to engage people with the centenary of the first world war. Jeremy Deller’s 
work We’re Here Because We’re Here was a completely new type of memorial that 
saw hundreds of volunteers dressed as soldiers appear silently across the UK to 
mark the centenary of the Somme. Deller took the memorial directly to the 
public, with the soldiers appearing in shopping centres, car parks and on 
public transport; he avoided sentimentality, and instead brought home the scale 
of loss 100 years ago.

In another example, Neil Bartlett and Kate Pullinger’s Letter to an Unknown 
Soldier created a literary memorial that thousands of people, including many 
schoolchildren, contributed to. The huge impact of these works shows that, 
while we can never capture the horror of war, there is a place in our society 
for art to help us remember and engage with the past.
