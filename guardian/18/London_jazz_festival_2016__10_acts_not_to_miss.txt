In 1987, the French composer Laurent Cugny persuaded legendary Birth of the 
Cool arranger and Miles Davis collaboratorGil Evans

to work with his band, which included UK saxist Andy Sheppard, then a rising

Norma Winstone’s 75th birthday celebration

Few jazz singers have ever been as comfortable with swing or stillness, with 
burnishing a good lyric or creating nuances in abstract sound, as the British 
singer Norma Winstone. This gig to celebrate her 75th birthday features her
chamber-musical European Trio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/16/norma-winstone-dance-without-answer-review>

Eve Risser’s White Desert Orchestra 

The imaginative pianist and composer Eve Risser, a new member of France’s 
adventurous Orchestre National de Jazz, brings together jazz, contemporary 
classical and alt-rock. She explores spacey prepared-piano effects as a solo 
artist and symphonic layerings of familiar and unfamiliar sonics in big groups. 
Risser’s White Desert Orchestra play themes inspired by her fascination with 
Arizona’s Grand Canyon.

Chris Cheek.
