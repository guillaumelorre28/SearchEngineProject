Classic rock, west coast hip-hop, prog, grunge, folk and symphonic Black 
Country pop are all represented among the 2017 inductees to the Rock and Roll 
Hall of Fame, who were announced on Tuesday.

Tupac Shakur, who was murdered in September 1996, represents hip-hop. He is 
joined by Electric Light Orchestra, Joan Baez, Journey, Pearl Jam and Yes.Nile 
Rodgers <https://www.theguardian.com/music/nile-rodgers> is to be given the 
award for musical excellence. Pearl Jam have been inducted in their first year 
of eligibility, while Shakur is only the sixth hip-hop artist to be honoured. 
Rodgers’ group, Chic, were spurned a record 11th time.

Journey – who have been resurgent in recent years thanks to the revival of 
affection for Don’t Stop Believin’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/16/dont-stop-believin-2010> – 
pronounced themselves “humbled to be included”, while Yes offered a fuller 
statement of their delight.

“What an honour this is for us and all involved with the history of this 
band,” said guitarist Steve Howe. “We thank all the Yes fans who have been so 
passionate over the decades, and helped us to keep the flag flying. It is the 
fans who have constantly demanded our inclusion. They have been heard.”

“We look forward to accepting this esteemed award next spring in honour of our 
fallen brother, Chris Squire, who would have been delighted to see his musical 
vision finally receive such recognition,” said drummer Alan White.


Given Yes’s complicated personnel history, precisely who should have been 
inducted might have been a point of discussion. The Hall of Fame has played it 
safe and inducted the lineup that made the album Union in 1991. Or, strictly, 
the two lineups, since Union was made by a combination of the Yes lineup at the 
time and the group of departed members Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, with the 
two not recording together. So the members to be inducted are: Howe, White, the 
late Chris Squire, Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, Tony Kaye, Rick Wakeman and 
Trevor Rabin.

The artists will be inducted at the 32nd annual ceremony, to be held at the 
Barclays Center in Brooklyn on 7 April.
