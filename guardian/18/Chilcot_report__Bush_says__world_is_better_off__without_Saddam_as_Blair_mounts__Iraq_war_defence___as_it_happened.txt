Summary

We’re going to close our rolling coverage of the Chilcot report with a summary 
of the day’s key developments and reaction.

 * Sir John Chilcot’s 6,000-page report on the Iraq war and occupation 
delivered a crushing verdict on Tony Blair’s decision to join the US invasion, 
finding a cascade of mistakes and bad strategy that led to years of devastating 
mismanagement and strife. 
 * Key findings include 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/iraq-inquiry-key-points-from-the-chilcot-report>
:Blair deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein; the UK 
chose invasion before it had exhausted peaceful options;British intelligence 
produced “flawed information” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/spy-agencies-flawed-information-saddam-wmds-iraq-chilcot>
; the US ignored UK advice on postwar planning; the British military waspoorly 
prepared for war 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/mod-left-uk-forces-in-iraq-ill-equipped-amid-lack-of-plan-chilcot-report-says>
, Blair ignored warnings,kept his cabinet in the dark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-exposes-how-blair-kept-ministers-and-generals-in-the-dark>
 and had no plans for occupation. 
 * The report revealed secret letters between Blair and George W Bush, 
including one in which the then prime minister pledged to the US president: “I 
will be with you, whatever 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/with-you-whatever-tony-blair-letters-george-w-bush-chilcot>
.” Six days after invasion, he added: “This is the moment when you can define 
international politics for the next generation: the true post-cold war world 
order.” 
 * Blair responded by saying: “I express more sorrow, regret and apology than 
you can ever know or believe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/tony-blair-deliberately-exaggerated-threat-from-iraq-chilcot-report-war-inquiry>
.”But the former prime minister insisted he made the right decision. “I believe 
it is better we took that decision. I acknowledge the mistakes and accept 
responsibility for them,” he said. “As this report makes clear, there were no 
lies, there was no deceit.” 
 * Bush defiantly insisted the decision to invade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-live-inquiry-war-iraq?page=with:block-577d35e0e4b07cec9883d202#block-577d35e0e4b07cec9883d202>
 was the correct one.“Despite the intelligence failures and other mistakes he 
has acknowledged previously,” a spokesperson said, “President Bush continues to 
believe the whole world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power.” 
 * Blair rejected at least nine findings of the report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-live-inquiry-war-iraq?page=with:block-577d3289e4b0d293fdad5b20#block-577d3289e4b0d293fdad5b20>
, including that war was “not a last resort”, that the UK and US undermined the 
UN, that an insurgency was predictable and that the military and intelligence 
services share some blame. 
 * Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn apologised on behalf of the party. He 
apologised to Iraqis, British soldiers and to “the millions of British citizens 
who feel our democracy was traduced and undermined 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-live-inquiry-war-iraq?page=with:block-577d35e0e4b07cec9883d202#block-577d35e0e4b07cec9883d202>
 by the way in which the decision to go to war was taken”. 
 * Reg Keys called Blair’s statement the “ramblings of a madman” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/06/chilcot-bereaved-families-iraq-tony-blair?CMP=share_btn_tw>
, saying the former prime minister misled parliament and that his son and other 
soldiers died in vain. 
 * Lord Butler and others made limited defenses of Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-live-inquiry-war-iraq?page=with:block-577d2d4fe4b04e08d34e2f0e#block-577d2d4fe4b04e08d34e2f0e>
, with many saying that he exagerrated the reliability of intelligence but 
acted in good faith and did not lie.The US diplomat in charge of the occupation 
in 2003agreed with several key findings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/paul-bremer-diplomat-iraq-occupation>
 but also argued that the decision to invade was justified. 
 * Many Iraqis met the report with the grim sense that it only articulated the 
obvious 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/they-should-have-known-better-chilcot-report-means-little-to-iraqis-mourning-baghdad-attack>
:that western hubris and incompetence had created the conditions for years more 
of strife, including Sunday’s bombing, which killed an estimated 250 people in 
one of the worst atrocities of postwar Iraq.

The Chilcot report is little more than a footnote to many Iraqis, who are 
still reeling from one of the worst atrocities of postwar Iraq: a bombing in 
central Baghdad that killed an estimated 250 people and outraged a country 
mostly inured by violence, my colleagueMartin Chulov reports.

For the mix of mourners staring into the middle distance, desperate relatives 
wailing for help, forensic officers crouched near puddles and others who stood 
bewildered by the scale of destruction, it would merely tell them what they 
already knew: that the war and its aftermath were both grave mistakes.


The few who had seen brief reports from London on Iraqi television shrugged 
and pointed at the damage when asked what they made of what was effectively 
Britain’s mea culpa. “This is the reason for all this chaos,” said Bassam Jaber 
Abayati, a Karrada local. “They should have known better. They should have done 
this [apologised] earlier. The west should be accountable for all this misery.”

A second local, Ahmed Ali said: “This is the result of the war. It’s all 
destroyed. What do you want me to say? If I had money I would not live inIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> another day. I would go anywhere that 
would take me.”

Throughout the eight-year occupation and chaotic years since 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/05/the-view-of-chilcot-from-iraq-only-those-with-the-wounds-feel-the-pain>
, sectarian war and widespread displacement of communities have ravaged the 
country. Terror attacks have barely relented, withstate-backed militias 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/29/iraq-isis-shia-militias-baquba-baghdad>
 running riot, and first al-Qaida in Iraq and then Islamic State unleashing 
murderous savagery.

Col Ahmed Hassan, a police officer attached to the interior ministry, said: 
“There is no excuse for [the decision to invade]. It was an extermination war. 
This is not the terrorists behind this. It is states against us. This is what 
all Iraqis feel. There was a high level of engineering behind this and that is 
the job of countries.”

Fadi Faris, 35, from Amara, an area occupied by the British army, said: “It 
was a mistake of excuses. They found the worst two reasons to invade, weapons 
of mass destruction and links to terrorism, and they stuck to them.

“We still live in the way of the dark ages, so we could never use the tools of 
democracy. It was like bringing a knife and giving it to a child. Under Saddam 
we had a government with a big problem. Now we don’t have a real government and 
we only have problems.

“The British, when they came to Iraq 100 years ago, established a good 
government.Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> was stable and it was 
going in a reasonable direction. They learned nothing [about the society] from 
that time. The US was the real decision-maker. Britain was just an ally. It was 
not a British plan at all.”

Russia has claimed it warned the UK of the “unjust and highly dangerous” Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> war, with its embassy in London 
seizing on the Chilcot report to boast about its warnings.

“No real WMD in Baghdad, unjust & highly dangerous war. The entire region on 
the receiving end,” embassy staff tweeted. Since Vladimir Putin assumed the 
presidency in 1999, the Kremlin has generally opposed western intervention 
abroad – even though in recent years Russia has grown more active in Georgia, 
Ukraine and Syria.

My colleague Ian Black reports on reaction around the world:

Franz Klintsevich, first deputy chairman of the defence and security committee 
in the upper house of Russia’s parliament, said the UK should apologise to the 
Iraqi people, pay compensation and prosecute the officials who decided on the 
invasion.

In Iran, widely seen as the greatest beneficiary of the US-led invasion, there 
was no official comment and the media paid scant attention to the report. The 
exception was Press TV, an English-language state broadcaster, which provided 
live coverage of Tony Blair’s press conference.

In Tehran, Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, pledged that his country would 
stand by the Iraqi government in a phone call to the prime minister, Haidar 
al-Abadi. He expressed his condolences for the recent terrorist attacks that 
have killed 250 people in Baghdad. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme 
leader, also failed to mention Chilcot.

Iraqi media was dominated by the mounting death toll in the Karrada bombings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/24/iraq-car-bomb-baghdad-sunni-shia>
. Another story was about Abadi accepting the resignation of his interior 
minister in the wake of the carnage.

“Iraq as a country has become a battlefield for regional and international 
powers, and this is one of the most critical consequences of the invasion,” 
Iraqi political analyst Hadi al-Isami told al-Jazeera, saying Chilcot would do 
nothing to assuage the country’s plight.

Paul Bremer, the US diplomat put in charge of governing Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> after the invasion and occupation, has 
backed several key findings of the Chilcot report.

Bremer agreed in a piece in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/06/iraq-war-aftermath-paul-bremer>
 that the US and UK made “inadequate” plans for the occupation of Iraq, and 
accused both George W Bush and Tony Blair of ignoring internal warnings.

“The commission noted that that ‘bad tidings’ tended not to be heard in 
London,” he said. “The same was true in Washington. Before the war, a few 
American military officers suggested the need for a substantial post-conflict 
military presence. They were not heard.”

Bremer also criticized the failure to prevent looting after the invasion and 
inconsistent military commitments.

“As David Richmond, one of the able British CPA colleagues, told the 
commission, the coalition ‘never got on top of security’,” he said. “So the 
coalition gave the impression to Iraqis that we were not serious in this most 
important goal of any government. No doubt this failure encouraged some members 
of what became the resistance.”

But the former diplomat agreed with Bush and Blair’s insistence that they made 
the right decision even if their methods were severely wanting.

“I believe history will agree that it was the correct, if difficult decision 
to remove Saddam,” he writes. “Had we not done so, today we would likely 
confront a nuclear armed Iraq facing off against a nuclear armed Iran. Bad as 
the unrest in the region is today, that would be worse.”

Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Bush said the former president 
acknowledges “intelligence failures and other mistakes”, but added “the whole 
world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power”.

Former defence secretary Geoff Hoon has also stoically defended his and Tony 
Blair’s conduct in an interview to Sky News. He says he has read only the 
executive summary of the Chilcot report.

“We do have to learn the lessons of process,” he says. There were ways we 
could and should have done better.” Hoon says that Blair “accepted those 
cirticisms, as do I.”

Like Blair, McFadden and Clwyd, he argues that everyone made decisions in good 
faith.

“We know now that there were not weapons of mass destruction,” Hoon says. 
“Knowing that now we would not have had the legal basis to have gone intoIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.”

He insists that he saw nothing to suggest that British intelligence had 
received flawed intelligence – such as a description of a chemical weapon that 
was suspiciously akin to a device in the movie The Rock. “Had I seen something 
that doubted it maybe things would’ve been different,” he says, when asked why 
he didn’t challenge intelligence or Blair.

“I did not detect anyone at that time who did not do anything otherwise than a 
serious job,” he says. “I believe they were hardworking, conscientious 
dedicated people.”

“With the benefit of hindsight you can look back on any group of people and 
say they could’ve done better.”

Q: But wasn’t it your responsibility?

Hoon: “They gave me their best military advice and I certainly challenged that 
advice from time to time.”


But more often than not, Hoon hints, he deferred to others. “These are peple 
who devoted their entire lives [to the military and intellgience]. It’s not for 
politicians to second guess their expert advice.”

Hoon also insists that information never received the ministry about the dire 
need for equipment to protect against IEDs and the guerrilla warfare that came 
with occupation and Iraq’s sectarian wars.

There was “no sense of anyone on the ground at the time saying this piece of 
equipment or that piece of equipment was required”, Hoon says.

“Very little of this information actually made it to the ministry of defense, 
nevermind to the ministers,” he concludes. “I recognise that overall I was 
responsible.”

The Labour MP Pat McFadden has given a partial defence of Tony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> and the decision to invade 
Iraq on BBC News, saying “these decisions were taken in good faith”.

“Intelligence was not falsified, parliament was not lied to, the cabinet was 
not lied to,” he says, meaning British intelligence agencies did not falsify 
material, although they accepted bogus information.

“This was not unconditional support,” he adds. “All the effort on the British 
end was to persuade the Americans to go down the UN route.”

McFadden was an adviser to Blair in Downing Street, and defends the former 
prime minister. “Advisers can advise,” he says, “but a prime minister more than 
anyone has to make that decision. He still believes it was the right decision, 
but of course it had many consequences and he’s had to live with them since.”

“He could’ve opted out of not taking part, I don’t think he could’ve stopped 
the Americans,” he adds. “It was at that time, to use a phrase from our age, a 
binary decision.”

Like Ann Clwyd he argues that sectarian violence was rampant in Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> before the invasion created a power 
vacuum out of which a Shia-Sunni civil war erupted. People act as though 
“history began in 2003”, McFadden says, and as though “now all the extremist 
violence stemmed from that”.

“But it’s important to stress that’s not the case. We had 9/11 two years 
before this, we had Bali, and we also had Saddam’s regime, which had engaged in 
its own horrific killing.”

“I don’t think it was a rush to war, and you know Mr Blair was asked about 
this today, about whether there could’ve been more time,” McFadden goes on. 
“The answer he gave was ‘I had to make a decision.’ That’s what a prime 
minister has to do.”

MI6 stood by bogus intelligence

Ewen MacAskill

British intelligence agencies accepted false information even after a source 
told them of a supposed chemical weapon that was remarkably similar to one from 
the 1996 movie The Rock, my colleagueEwen MacAskill has learned from the report.

The incident is just one of a series of blunders described by the Chilcot 
report committed by Britain’s overseas spy agency, the Secret Intelligence 
Service in the run-up to the 2003 invasion ofIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.

In the incident, the report describes a source providing details about 
spherical glass containers allegedly filled with chemical weapons at an 
establishment in Iraq.

MI6 at the time defended the authenticity of the source and the material, 
according to the Chilcot report. “However, it drew attention to the fact that 
the source’s description of the device and its spherical glass contents was 
remarkably similar to the fictional chemical weapon portrayed in the film The 
Rock,” the report says.

In the 1996 movie, Nicolas Cage, playing an FBI chemical warfare specialist, 
joins Sean Connery, playing a former British spy, to prevent chemical weapons 
being launched against San Francisco.

The similarity between the movie and the source’s alleged device had been 
noted when the MI6 report was first circulated on 11 and 23 September 2002, 
well before the Iraq invasion in March 2003.

But this and other bogus claims were not formally withdrawn by MI6 until 29 
July 2003, four months after the invasion, Chilcot reports.

In a devastating finding, Chilcot said: “SIS did not inform No 10 or others 
that the source who had provided the reporting issued on 11 and 23 September 
2002 about production of chemical and biological agent had been lying to SIS.”

MI6 stood by bogus intelligence until after Iraq invasion

False allegations that Saddam could attack UK targets within “45 minutes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/aug/16/davidkelly.iraq>” were not 
withdrawn until 28 September 2004. Bogus information by a source known as Curve 
Ball that also fed into the case for war was not withdrawn until the following 
day, 29 September 2004.

The faulty intelligence from MI6 was compounded by Tony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> who hardened up the 
information when he wrote the foreword to the so-called “dodgy dossier” in 
September 2002. Chilcot concluded that Blair presented the assessments of the 
spy agencies to parliament with a “certainty” not justified by available 
intelligence.

Chilcot blames the intelligence community not just for passing on bogus 
information in the first place but failing to correct the prime minister when 
he toughened up the so-called intelligence.

The intelligence agencies had a serious blind spot. “At no stage was the 
proposition that Iraq might no longer have chemical, biological or nuclear 
weapons or programmes identified and examined by either JIC (the Joint 
Intelligence Committee, the umbrella organisation representing all the 
intelligence agencies) or the policy community.”

In the foreword to the dossier presented to the public in September 2002 
preparing the case for war, Blair said he believed the intelligence had 
“established beyond doubt” that Saddam had continued to produce WMDs.


But the Chilcot report concludes: “The assessed intelligence had not 
established beyond doubt that Saddam Hussein had continued to produce chemical 
and biological weapons.”

The Labour MP Ann Clwyd, who was Tony Blair’s special envoy on human rights in 
Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> before the war, has defended the 
former prime minister in an interview on Sky TV.

“I think Tony Blair <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> did the 
right thing at the time on the evidence that he had,” she says.

When pressed to defend her support for the invasion, she cites what she saw in 
the 1990s and early 2000s in her argument that Saddam Hussein was going to 
inflict war crimes on minorities in Iraq.

“I’d just come back in February that year from Kurdistan where the Kurds are 
already fleeing out of the towns and the cities into the countryside, because 
they believed that Saddam Hussein was going to be using chemical weapons 
against them again.

“In all the years that I’ve known them they said there was no other way but 
war.”

The Sky host argues that the invasion and mistake-riddled occupation 
destabilised Iraq and created the circumstances ripe for civil war – the brutal 
Shia-Sunni wars that were not quelled until the so-called US “surge”. Al-Qaida 
did not have a strong presence in Iraq before the war, but Clwyd says: 
“Sectarian violence had been going a long time in Iraq, before 2003.”

“The elements of al-Qaida in the north of Iraq, they were closely associated 
subsequently with al-Qaida, those are also still in existence,” she says.

Q: So you don’t see the links between dismantling the security forces and the 
rise of al-Qaida in Iraq with the invasion?

Clwyd: “No, I think that’s much too simplistic.”

She again says that the atrocities perpetrated by Saddam justified the 
invasion. “If you’d stood by the mass graves,” she says, “near Babylon and 
you’d see bodies being excavated … they were Shia [and they] had tried an 
uprising against Saddam Hussein, and they’d been ruthlessly suppressed. The 
Kurds had tried to raise an uprising against Saddam Hussein and they were 
ruthlessly suppressed.”

She notes the UN resolutions being ignored by Saddam. “I think there is an 
argument for intervention,” she says.

Q: Was there no alternative to war?

“I didn’t want a war,” Clwyd says. “We gathered evidence of Iraqi war crimes, 
crimes against humanity, genocide.” She suggests that perhaps the international 
community could have obtained indictments against Saddam and members of his 
regime. “Also sanctions. Although there were sanctions against the regime, they 
did not work properly. Saddam Hussein really subverted the oil for food 
programme.”

9 Chilcot findings rejected by Tony Blair

Andrew Sparrow

Tony Blair’s lengthy speech about the Chilcot report, and his subsequent Q&A 
with journalists, was remarkable. Blair has expressed sorrow and regret about 
what happened before, but today, particularly in his opening remarks, he 
sounded more emotional and contrite than ever.

The intelligence statements made at the time of going to war turned out to be 
wrong.

The aftermath turned out more hostile, protracted and bloody than we ever 
imagined.

The coalition planned for one set of ground facts and encountered another.

A nation whose people we wanted to see free and secure from the evil of Saddam 
became instead victim of sectarian terrorism.

For all of this I express more sorrow, regret and apology and in greater 
measure than you can know or may believe.

But the raw emotion (genuine, I believe, although no doubt many will assume it 
wasn’t) could not conceal the fact that Blair’s performance was a statement of 
defiance.

Earlier this year Tony Blair said in an interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/11/eu-referendum-blair-says-remain-camp-should-show-more-passion-and-vigour-politics-live?page=with:block-56e28372e4b0dfdfc092593d#block-56e28372e4b0dfdfc092593d>
 that at some point “the political class as a whole has got to get up and stand 
up for itself”. That’s what he was doing this afternoon. His main complaint 
about Sir John Chilcot was that Chilcot did not recognise what it was like to 
have to take decisions. Blair repeatedly criticised Chilcot for refusing to 
consider what might have happened if Britain has chosen not to support the 
invasion of Iraq, suggesting that there was a thick streak of naivety or 
otherworldliness running through the report.

But Blair also rejected many of Chilcot’s specific conclusions. I’ve counted 
at least nine points where Blair said Chilcot was wrong. Here they are:

 * Blair said he did not accept Chilcot’s claim that the war was “not a last 
resort”. There was no rush to war, Blair said. 
The inquiry finds that as at 18 March war was not the ‘last resort’. But given 
the impasse at the UN and the insistence of the USA – for reasons I completely 
understood and with hundreds of thousands of troops in theatre which could not 
be kept in situ indefinitely – it was the last moment of decision for us, as 
the report accepts.

 * He rejected Chilcot’s claim that Britain and America undermined the 
authority of the UN by going to war without a second resolution. Blair said: 
The inquiry finds that going to war without a majority of the UNSC in 
agreement ‘undermined the authority of the UN.’

The reality is that we – Britain – had continually tried to act with the 
authority of the UN. I successfully convinced the Americans to go back to the 
UN in November 2002 to secure resolution 1441.

 * Blair said he did not accept Chilcot’s assessment that it would have been 
acceptable to refuse to support America. 
Whilst they accept that it was my prerogative as PM to decide to be with the 
USA in military action, the inquiry questions whether this was really necessary.

9/11 was an event like no other in US history. I considered it an attack on 
all the free world. I believed that Britain – as America’s strongest ally – 
should be with them in tackling this new and unprecedented security challenge. 
I believed it important that America was not alone but part of a wider 
coalition. In the end, a majority even of the European Union nations supported 
action inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.

 * Blair said he did not accept Chilcot’s claim that the risk of an insurgency 
should have been predicted. 
The inquiry finds that there were some warnings about sectarian fighting and 
bloodletting. I accept that but would point out that nowhere were these 
highlighted as the main risk and in any event what we faced was not the 
anticipated internal bloodletting but an all-out insurgency stimulated by 
external arms and money.

 * Blair said Chilcot was wrong to blame the armed forces, the intelligence 
services and civil servants, because they were following Blair’s instructions. 
I do not think it is fair or accurate to criticise the armed forces, 
intelligence services, or civil service. It was my decision they were acting 
upon. The armed forces in particular did an extraordinary job throughout our 
engagement in Iraq in the incredibly difficult mission we gave them.

Some of the Chilcot criticisms are of the armed forces are set out here. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/mod-left-uk-forces-in-iraq-ill-equipped-amid-lack-of-plan-chilcot-report-says>

 * Blair said he did not accept Chilcot’s claim that the war was a failure. 
(See 12.09pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-live-inquiry-war-iraq?page=with:block-577ce06ae4b0dc6aac1d856b#block-577ce06ae4b0dc6aac1d856b>
 Blair said the first part of the campaign was a “brilliant military success”. 
 * He said he did not accept Chilcot’s claim that it was “humiliating” for 
British soldiers to have to do a deal with a militia group in southern Iraq. 
 * Blair rejected Chilcot’s claim that it was a mistake to be conducting “two 
enduring campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan” at the same time. 
 * Blair accused Chilcot of underestimating the damage done to French and 
German relations with America by their stance on Iraq. 
That’s all from me and Peter for today.

We are handing over to Alan Yuhas.

George Bush says world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power

George W Bush, the former American president, has defended the decision to 
invadeIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> following the publication 
of today’s report. A spokesman for Bush said:

President Bush is hosting wounded warriors at his ranch today and has not had 
the chance to read the Chilcot report. Despite the intelligence failures and 
other mistakes he has acknowledged previously, President Bush continues to 
believe the whole world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. He is 
deeply grateful for the service and sacrifice of American and coalition forces 
in the war on terror. And there was no stronger ally than the United Kingdom 
under the leadership of Prime MinisterTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair>. President Bush believes we 
must now find the unity and resolve to stay on the offensive and defeat radical 
extremism wherever it exists.

Corbyn apologises for war on behalf of Labour to Iraqis, to soldiers' families 
and to Britons

Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is giving a speech in Westminster about the 
Chilcot report now. Much of the speech was the same as the one he gave in the 
House of Commons, but towards the end he has just included an apology on behalf 
of Labour for the decision to go to war.

So I now apologise sincerely on behalf of my party for the disastrous decision 
to go to war inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> in March 2003.

That apology is owed first of all to the people of Iraq. Hundreds of thousands 
of lives have been lost and the country is still living with the devastating 
consequences of the war and the forces it unleashed.

They have paid the greatest price for the most serious foreign policy calamity 
of the last 60 years.

The apology is also owed to the families of those soldiers who died in Iraq or 
who have returned home injured or incapacitated.

They did their duty but it was in a conflict they should never have been sent 
to.

Finally, it is an apology to the millions of British citizens who feel our 
democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to 
war was taken on the basic of secret ‘I will be with you, whatever’ 
understandings given to the US president that have now been publicly exposed.

Lord Butler says Blair exaggerated the reliability of the intelligence, but 
did not lie

In a debate in the House of Lords in 2007 Lord Butler, the former cabinet 
secretary who chaired a report into the use of intelligence in the run up to 
the Iraq war, said thatTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> was “disingenuous” about the 
WMD intelligence because it did not show conclusively that Saddam Hussein had 
WMD, as Blair suggested. Butler also told peers that when Blair said the WMD 
intelligence was “extensive, detailed and authoritative”, those words “could 
simply not have been justified”. Peter Oborne quotes Butler repeatedly in his 
book Not the Chilcot Report to help make his case that Blair can be accused of 
lying.

But Butler has been giving interviews to Sky and BBC News this afternoon and 
he did not go as far as he did in the Lords. He said that, although Blair was 
guilty of “exaggerating the reliability of the intelligence”, he would not 
accuse him of lying. He also said he did not think Blair should be taken to 
court. That would only be justified if Blair was criminally negligent, Butler 
said. But he said he did not believe Blair was criminally negligent.

Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time of the Iraq war, is being 
interview on Sky News. He saysTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> was “never gung-ho” about war.

Asked about the phrase “I will be with you, whatever” that Tony Blair included 
in his July 2002 memo to Bush, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/with-you-whatever-tony-blair-letters-george-w-bush-chilcot>

Goldsmith says Chilcot backs his finding that war was legal

Lord Goldsmith, attorney general at the time of the Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> war, has put out a statement about the 
Chilcot report.

He says he welcomes the fact that there is nothing in the report that 
challenges his conclusion that the war was legal, and nothing in the report 
which challenges the fact that this was his “honestly held view”.

Reg Keys says Blair's statement was 'ramblings of a madman'

Reg Keys, whose son Tom died in Iraq and who stood against Tony Blair in the 
2005 election, is responding toTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> now on BBC News.

He says Blair was rambling. Blair feels he has been exonerated by Chilcot, 
Keys says. But he says that is not what the report says.

He says Blair misled parliament. And he accuses Blair of refusing to meeting 
relatives of those killed inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.

Keys says his view is that his son and other soldiers did die in vain.

He says Blair is a “consummate actor”. He says Blair’s comments were just “the 
ramblings of a madman”.

He says Blair has been found guilty by Sir John Chilcot.

Relatives of servicemen killed are handing the findings to lawyers. They will 
take whatever action is appropriate.

He says Chilcot has done a “damn good job”. It is a very thorough report, he 
says.

We’re going to close our rolling coverage of the Chilcot report with a summary 
of the day’s key developments and reaction.

 * Sir John Chilcot’s 6,000-page report on the Iraq war and occupation 
delivered a crushing verdict on Tony Blair’s decision to join the US invasion, 
finding a cascade of mistakes and bad strategy that led to years of devastating

Chilcot report: key points from the Iraq inquiry

<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/iraq-inquiry-key-points-from-the-chilcot-report> 
The Chilcot report is little more than a footnote to many Iraqis, who are 
still reeling from one of the worst atrocities of postwar Iraq: a bombing in 
central Baghdad that killed an estimated 250 people and outraged a country 
mostly inured by violence, my colleagueMartin Chulov reports.

For the mix of mourners staring into the middle distance, desperate relatives 
wailing for help, forensic officers crouched near puddles and others who stood 
bewildered by the scale of destruction, it would merely tell them what they 
already knew: that the war and its aftermath were both grave mistakes.


The few who had seen brief reports from London on Iraqi television shrugged 
and pointed at the damage when asked what they made of what was effectively 
Britain’s mea culpa. “This is the reason for all this chaos,” said Bassam Jaber 
Abayati, a Karrada local. “They should have known better. They should have done 
this [apologised] earlier. The west should be accountable for all this misery.”

A second local, Ahmed Ali said: “This is the result of the war. It’s all 
destroyed. What do you want me to say? If I had money I would not live inIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> another day. I would go anywhere that 
would take me.”

Throughout the eight-year occupation and chaotic years since 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/05/the-view-of-chilcot-from-iraq-only-those-with-the-wounds-feel-the-pain>
, sectarian war and widespread displacement of communities have ravaged the 
country. Terror attacks have barely relented, withstate-backed militias 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/29/iraq-isis-shia-militias-baquba-baghdad>
 running riot, and first al-Qaida in Iraq and then Islamic State unleashing 
murderous savagery.

Col Ahmed Hassan, a police officer attached to the interior ministry, said: 
“There is no excuse for [the decision to invade]. It was an extermination war. 
This is not the terrorists behind this. It is states against us. This is what 
all Iraqis feel. There was a high level of engineering behind this and that is 
the job of countries.”

Fadi Faris, 35, from Amara, an area occupied by the British army, said: “It 
was a mistake of excuses. They found the worst two reasons to invade, weapons 
of mass destruction and links to terrorism, and they stuck to them.

“We still live in the way of the dark ages, so we could never use the tools of 
democracy. It was like bringing a knife and giving it to a child. Under Saddam 
we had a government with a big problem. Now we don’t have a real government and 
we only have problems.

“The British, when they came to Iraq 100 years ago, established a good 
government.Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> was stable and it was 
going in a reasonable direction. They learned nothing [about the society] from 
that time. The US was the real decision-maker. Britain was just an ally. It was 
not a British plan at all.”

Russia has claimed it warned the UK of the “unjust and highly dangerous” Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> war, with its embassy in London 
seizing on the Chilcot report to boast about its warnings.

“No real WMD in Baghdad, unjust & highly dangerous war. The entire region on 
the receiving end,” embassy staff tweeted. Since Vladimir Putin assumed the 
presidency in 1999, the Kremlin has generally opposed western intervention 
abroad – even though in recent years Russia has grown more active in Georgia, 
Ukraine and Syria.

My colleague Ian Black reports on reaction around the world:

Franz Klintsevich, first deputy chairman of the defence and security committee 
in the upper house of Russia’s parliament, said the UK should apologise to the 
Iraqi people, pay compensation and prosecute the officials who decided on the 
invasion.

In Iran, widely seen as the greatest beneficiary of the US-led invasion, there 
was no official comment and the media paid scant attention to the report. The 
exception was Press TV, an English-language state broadcaster, which provided 
live coverage of Tony Blair’s press conference.

In Tehran, Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, pledged that his country would 
stand by the Iraqi government in a phone call to the prime minister, Haidar 
al-Abadi. He expressed his condolences for the recent terrorist attacks that 
have killed 250 people in Baghdad. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme 
leader, also failed to mention Chilcot.

Iraqi media was dominated by the mounting death toll in the Karrada bombings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/24/iraq-car-bomb-baghdad-sunni-shia>
. Another story was about Abadi accepting the resignation of his interior 
minister in the wake of the carnage.

“Iraq as a country has become a battlefield for regional and international 
powers, and this is one of the most critical consequences of the invasion,” 
Iraqi political analyst Hadi al-Isami told al-Jazeera, saying Chilcot would do 
nothing to assuage the country’s plight.

Paul Bremer, the US diplomat put in charge of governing Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> after the invasion and occupation, has 
backed several key findings of the Chilcot report.

Bremer agreed in a piece in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/06/iraq-war-aftermath-paul-bremer>
 that the US and UK made “inadequate” plans for the occupation of Iraq, and 
accused both George W Bush and Tony Blair of ignoring internal warnings.

“The commission noted that that ‘bad tidings’ tended not to be heard in 
London,” he said. “The same was true in Washington. Before the war, a few 
American military officers suggested the need for a substantial post-conflict 
military presence. They were not heard.”

Bremer also criticized the failure to prevent looting after the invasion and 
inconsistent military commitments.

“As David Richmond, one of the able British CPA colleagues, told the 
commission, the coalition ‘never got on top of security’,” he said. “So the 
coalition gave the impression to Iraqis that we were not serious in this most 
important goal of any government. No doubt this failure encouraged some members 
of what became the resistance.”

But the former diplomat agreed with Bush and Blair’s insistence that they made 
the right decision even if their methods were severely wanting.

“I believe history will agree that it was the correct, if difficult decision 
to remove Saddam,” he writes. “Had we not done so, today we would likely 
confront a nuclear armed Iraq facing off against a nuclear armed Iran. Bad as 
the unrest in the region is today, that would be worse.”

Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Bush said the former president 
acknowledges “intelligence failures and other mistakes”, but added “the whole 
world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power”.

Former defence secretary Geoff Hoon has also stoically defended his and Tony 
Blair’s conduct in an interview to Sky News. He says he has read only the 
executive summary of the Chilcot report.

“We do have to learn the lessons of process,” he says. There were ways we 
could and should have done better.” Hoon says that Blair “accepted those 
cirticisms, as do I.”

Like Blair, McFadden and Clwyd, he argues that everyone made decisions in good 
faith.

“We know now that there were not weapons of mass destruction,” Hoon says. 
“Knowing that now we would not have had the legal basis to have gone intoIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.”

He insists that he saw nothing to suggest that British intelligence had 
received flawed intelligence – such as a description of a chemical weapon that 
was suspiciously akin to a device in the movie The Rock. “Had I seen something 
that doubted it maybe things would’ve been different,” he says, when asked why 
he didn’t challenge intelligence or Blair.

“I did not detect anyone at that time who did not do anything otherwise than a 
serious job,” he says. “I believe they were hardworking, conscientious 
dedicated people.”

“With the benefit of hindsight you can look back on any group of people and 
say they could’ve done better.”

Q: But wasn’t it your responsibility?

Hoon: “They gave me their best military advice and I certainly challenged that 
advice from time to time.”


But more often than not, Hoon hints, he deferred to others. “These are peple 
who devoted their entire lives [to the military and intellgience]. It’s not for 
politicians to second guess their expert advice.”

Hoon also insists that information never received the ministry about the dire 
need for equipment to protect against IEDs and the guerrilla warfare that came 
with occupation and Iraq’s sectarian wars.

There was “no sense of anyone on the ground at the time saying this piece of 
equipment or that piece of equipment was required”, Hoon says.

“Very little of this information actually made it to the ministry of defense, 
nevermind to the ministers,” he concludes. “I recognise that overall I was 
responsible.”

 
The Labour MP Pat McFadden has given a partial defence of Tony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> and the decision to invade 
Iraq on BBC News, saying “these decisions were taken in good faith”.

“Intelligence was not falsified, parliament was not lied to, the cabinet was 
not lied to,” he says, meaning British intelligence agencies did not falsify 
material, although they accepted bogus information.

“This was not unconditional support,” he adds. “All the effort on the British 
end was to persuade the Americans to go down the UN route.”

McFadden was an adviser to Blair in Downing Street, and defends the former 
prime minister. “Advisers can advise,” he says, “but a prime minister more than 
anyone has to make that decision. He still believes it was the right decision, 
but of course it had many consequences and he’s had to live with them since.”

“He could’ve opted out of not taking part, I don’t think he could’ve stopped 
the Americans,” he adds. “It was at that time, to use a phrase from our age, a 
binary decision.”

Like Ann Clwyd he argues that sectarian violence was rampant in Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> before the invasion created a power 
vacuum out of which a Shia-Sunni civil war erupted. People act as though 
“history began in 2003”, McFadden says, and as though “now all the extremist 
violence stemmed from that”.

“But it’s important to stress that’s not the case. We had 9/11 two years 
before this, we had Bali, and we also had Saddam’s regime, which had engaged in 
its own horrific killing.”

“I don’t think it was a rush to war, and you know Mr Blair was asked about 
this today, about whether there could’ve been more time,” McFadden goes on. 
“The answer he gave was ‘I had to make a decision.’ That’s what a prime 
minister has to do.”
 
The French ambassador to the US, Gérard Araud, has taken the Chilcot report as 
a vindication of his country’s refusal to join the invasion ofIraq

British intelligence agencies accepted false information even after a source 
told them of a supposed chemical weapon that was remarkably similar to one from 
the 1996 movie The Rock, my colleagueEwen MacAskill has learned from the report.

The incident is just one of a series of blunders described by the Chilcot 
report committed by Britain’s overseas spy agency, the Secret Intelligence 
Service in the run-up to the 2003 invasion ofIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.

In the incident, the report describes a source providing details about 
spherical glass containers allegedly filled with chemical weapons at an 
establishment in Iraq.

MI6 at the time defended the authenticity of the source and the material, 
according to the Chilcot report. “However, it drew attention to the fact that 
the source’s description of the device and its spherical glass contents was 
remarkably similar to the fictional chemical weapon portrayed in the film The 
Rock,” the report says.

In the 1996 movie, Nicolas Cage, playing an FBI chemical warfare specialist, 
joins Sean Connery, playing a former British spy, to prevent chemical weapons 
being launched against San Francisco.

The similarity between the movie and the source’s alleged device had been 
noted when the MI6 report was first circulated on 11 and 23 September 2002, 
well before the Iraq invasion in March 2003.

But this and other bogus claims were not formally withdrawn by MI6 until 29 
July 2003, four months after the invasion, Chilcot reports.

In a devastating finding, Chilcot said: “SIS did not inform No 10 or others 
that the source who had provided the reporting issued on 11 and 23 September 
2002 about production of chemical and biological agent had been lying to SIS.”

MI6 stood by bogus intelligence until after Iraq invasion

False allegations that Saddam could attack UK targets within “45 minutes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/aug/16/davidkelly.iraq>” were not 
withdrawn until 28 September 2004. Bogus information by a source known as Curve 
Ball that also fed into the case for war was not withdrawn until the following 
day, 29 September 2004.

The faulty intelligence from MI6 was compounded by Tony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> who hardened up the 
information when he wrote the foreword to the so-called “dodgy dossier” in 
September 2002. Chilcot concluded that Blair presented the assessments of the 
spy agencies to parliament with a “certainty” not justified by available 
intelligence.

Chilcot blames the intelligence community not just for passing on bogus 
information in the first place but failing to correct the prime minister when 
he toughened up the so-called intelligence.

The intelligence agencies had a serious blind spot. “At no stage was the 
proposition that Iraq might no longer have chemical, biological or nuclear 
weapons or programmes identified and examined by either JIC (the Joint 
Intelligence Committee, the umbrella organisation representing all the 
intelligence agencies) or the policy community.”

In the foreword to the dossier presented to the public in September 2002 
preparing the case for war, Blair said he believed the intelligence had 
“established beyond doubt” that Saddam had continued to produce WMDs.


But the Chilcot report concludes: “The assessed intelligence had not 
established beyond doubt that Saddam Hussein had continued to produce chemical 
and biological weapons.”
Chilcot report: ‘A devastating critique of Blair and the British government’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-a-devastating-critique-of-blair-and-the-british-government-video> 
The Labour MP Ann Clwyd, who was Tony Blair’s special envoy on human rights in 
Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> before the war, has defended the 
former prime minister in an interview on Sky TV.

“I think Tony Blair <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> did the 
right thing at the time on the evidence that he had,” she says.

When pressed to defend her support for the invasion, she cites what she saw in 
the 1990s and early 2000s in her argument that Saddam Hussein was going to 
inflict war crimes on minorities in Iraq.

“I’d just come back in February that year from Kurdistan where the Kurds are 
already fleeing out of the towns and the cities into the countryside, because 
they believed that Saddam Hussein was going to be using chemical weapons 
against them again.

“In all the years that I’ve known them they said there was no other way but 
war.”

The Sky host argues that the invasion and mistake-riddled occupation 
destabilised Iraq and created the circumstances ripe for civil war – the brutal 
Shia-Sunni wars that were not quelled until the so-called US “surge”. Al-Qaida 
did not have a strong presence in Iraq before the war, but Clwyd says: 
“Sectarian violence had been going a long time in Iraq, before 2003.”

“The elements of al-Qaida in the north of Iraq, they were closely associated 
subsequently with al-Qaida, those are also still in existence,” she says.

Q: So you don’t see the links between dismantling the security forces and the 
rise of al-Qaida in Iraq with the invasion?

Clwyd: “No, I think that’s much too simplistic.”

She again says that the atrocities perpetrated by Saddam justified the 
invasion. “If you’d stood by the mass graves,” she says, “near Babylon and 
you’d see bodies being excavated … they were Shia [and they] had tried an 
uprising against Saddam Hussein, and they’d been ruthlessly suppressed. The 
Kurds had tried to raise an uprising against Saddam Hussein and they were 
ruthlessly suppressed.”

She notes the UN resolutions being ignored by Saddam. “I think there is an 
argument for intervention,” she says.

Q: Was there no alternative to war?

“I didn’t want a war,” Clwyd says. “We gathered evidence of Iraqi war crimes, 
crimes against humanity, genocide.” She suggests that perhaps the international 
community could have obtained indictments against Saddam and members of his 
regime. “Also sanctions. Although there were sanctions against the regime, they 
did not work properly. Saddam Hussein really subverted the oil for food 
programme.”

Tony Blair’s lengthy speech about the Chilcot report, and his subsequent Q&A 
with journalists, was remarkable. Blair has expressed sorrow and regret about 
what happened before, but today, particularly in his opening remarks, he 
sounded more emotional and contrite than ever.

The intelligence statements made at the time of going to war turned out to be 
wrong.

The aftermath turned out more hostile, protracted and bloody than we ever 
imagined.

The coalition planned for one set of ground facts and encountered another.

A nation whose people we wanted to see free and secure from the evil of Saddam 
became instead victim of sectarian terrorism.

For all of this I express more sorrow, regret and apology and in greater 
measure than you can know or may believe.

But the raw emotion (genuine, I believe, although no doubt many will assume it 
wasn’t) could not conceal the fact that Blair’s performance was a statement of 
defiance.

Earlier this year Tony Blair said in an interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/11/eu-referendum-blair-says-remain-camp-should-show-more-passion-and-vigour-politics-live?page=with:block-56e28372e4b0dfdfc092593d#block-56e28372e4b0dfdfc092593d>
 that at some point “the political class as a whole has got to get up and stand 
up for itself”. That’s what he was doing this afternoon. His main complaint 
about Sir John Chilcot was that Chilcot did not recognise what it was like to 
have to take decisions. Blair repeatedly criticised Chilcot for refusing to 
consider what might have happened if Britain has chosen not to support the 
invasion of Iraq, suggesting that there was a thick streak of naivety or 
otherworldliness running through the report.

But Blair also rejected many of Chilcot’s specific conclusions. I’ve counted 
at least nine points where Blair said Chilcot was wrong. Here they are:

 * Blair said he did not accept Chilcot’s claim that the war was “not a last 
resort”. There was no rush to war, Blair said. 
The inquiry finds that as at 18 March war was not the ‘last resort’. But given 
the impasse at the UN and the insistence of the USA – for reasons I completely 
understood and with hundreds of thousands of troops in theatre which could not 
be kept in situ indefinitely – it was the last moment of decision for us, as 
the report accepts.

 * He rejected Chilcot’s claim that Britain and America undermined the 
authority of the UN by going to war without a second resolution. Blair said: 
The inquiry finds that going to war without a majority of the UNSC in 
agreement ‘undermined the authority of the UN.’

The reality is that we – Britain – had continually tried to act with the 
authority of the UN. I successfully convinced the Americans to go back to the 
UN in November 2002 to secure resolution 1441.

 * Blair said he did not accept Chilcot’s assessment that it would have been 
acceptable to refuse to support America. 
Whilst they accept that it was my prerogative as PM to decide to be with the 
USA in military action, the inquiry questions whether this was really necessary.

9/11 was an event like no other in US history. I considered it an attack on 
all the free world. I believed that Britain – as America’s strongest ally – 
should be with them in tackling this new and unprecedented security challenge. 
I believed it important that America was not alone but part of a wider 
coalition. In the end, a majority even of the European Union nations supported 
action inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.

 * Blair said he did not accept Chilcot’s claim that the risk of an insurgency 
should have been predicted. 
The inquiry finds that there were some warnings about sectarian fighting and 
bloodletting. I accept that but would point out that nowhere were these 
highlighted as the main risk and in any event what we faced was not the 
anticipated internal bloodletting but an all-out insurgency stimulated by 
external arms and money.

 * Blair said Chilcot was wrong to blame the armed forces, the intelligence 
services and civil servants, because they were following Blair’s instructions. 
I do not think it is fair or accurate to criticise the armed forces, 
intelligence services, or civil service. It was my decision they were acting 
upon. The armed forces in particular did an extraordinary job throughout our 
engagement in Iraq in the incredibly difficult mission we gave them.

Some of the Chilcot criticisms are of the armed forces are set out here.

 Blair said the first part of the campaign was a “brilliant military success”. 
 * He said he did not accept Chilcot’s claim that it was “humiliating” for 
British soldiers to have to do a deal with a militia group in southern Iraq. 
 * Blair rejected Chilcot’s claim that it was a mistake to be conducting “two 
enduring campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan” at the same time. 
 * Blair accused Chilcot of underestimating the damage done to French and 
German relations with America by their stance on Iraq. 
That’s all from me and Peter for today.

George W Bush, the former American president, has defended the decision to 
invadeIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> following the publication 
of today’s report. A spokesman for Bush said:

President Bush is hosting wounded warriors at his ranch today and has not had 
the chance to read the Chilcot report. Despite the intelligence failures and 
other mistakes he has acknowledged previously, President Bush continues to 
believe the whole world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. He is 
deeply grateful for the service and sacrifice of American and coalition forces 
in the war on terror. And there was no stronger ally than the United Kingdom 
under the leadership of Prime MinisterTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair>. President Bush believes we 
must now find the unity and resolve to stay on the offensive and defeat radical 
extremism wherever it exists.
 
Here are two diplomatic experts on Chilcot.

Apart the effective damning Blair judgement, Chilcot totally lacks historical 
sweep, context or analysis. Reads like Diary of a Mandarin.

Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is giving a speech in Westminster about the 
Chilcot report now. Much of the speech was the same as the one he gave in the 
House of Commons, but towards the end he has just included an apology on behalf 
of Labour for the decision to go to war.

So I now apologise sincerely on behalf of my party for the disastrous decision 
to go to war inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> in March 2003.

That apology is owed first of all to the people of Iraq. Hundreds of thousands 
of lives have been lost and the country is still living with the devastating 
consequences of the war and the forces it unleashed.

They have paid the greatest price for the most serious foreign policy calamity 
of the last 60 years.

The apology is also owed to the families of those soldiers who died in Iraq or 
who have returned home injured or incapacitated.

They did their duty but it was in a conflict they should never have been sent 
to.

Finally, it is an apology to the millions of British citizens who feel our 
democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to 
war was taken on the basic of secret ‘I will be with you, whatever’ 
understandings given to the US president that have now been publicly exposed.

In a debate in the House of Lords in 2007 Lord Butler, the former cabinet 
secretary who chaired a report into the use of intelligence in the run up to 
the Iraq war, said thatTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> was “disingenuous” about the 
WMD intelligence because it did not show conclusively that Saddam Hussein had 
WMD, as Blair suggested. Butler also told peers that when Blair said the WMD 
intelligence was “extensive, detailed and authoritative”, those words “could 
simply not have been justified”. Peter Oborne quotes Butler repeatedly in his 
book Not the Chilcot Report to help make his case that Blair can be accused of 
lying.

But Butler has been giving interviews to Sky and BBC News this afternoon and 
he did not go as far as he did in the Lords. He said that, although Blair was 
guilty of “exaggerating the reliability of the intelligence”, he would not 
accuse him of lying. He also said he did not think Blair should be taken to 
court. That would only be justified if Blair was criminally negligent, Butler 
said. But he said he did not believe Blair was criminally negligent.

Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time of the Iraq war, is being 
interview on Sky News. He saysTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> was “never gung-ho” about war.

Asked about the phrase “I will be with you, whatever” that Tony Blair included 
in his July 2002 memo to Bush, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/with-you-whatever-tony-blair-letters-george-w-bush-chilcot>
 Straw says he thought that was unwise because it would be misinterpreted.

Lord Goldsmith, attorney general at the time of the Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> war, has put out a statement about the 
Chilcot report.

He says he welcomes the fact that there is nothing in the report that 
challenges his conclusion that the war was legal, and nothing in the report 
which challenges the fact that this was his “honestly held view”.

Here is the full text of Tony Blair’s opening statement.

Reg Keys, whose son Tom died in Iraq and who stood against Tony Blair in the 
2005 election, is responding toTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> now on BBC News.

He says Blair was rambling. Blair feels he has been exonerated by Chilcot, 
Keys says. But he says that is not what the report says.

He says Blair misled parliament. And he accuses Blair of refusing to meeting 
relatives of those killed inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.

Keys says his view is that his son and other soldiers did die in vain.

He says Blair is a “consummate actor”. He says Blair’s comments were just “the 
ramblings of a madman”.

He says Blair has been found guilty by Sir John Chilcot.

Relatives of servicemen killed are handing the findings to lawyers. They will 
take whatever action is appropriate.

He says Chilcot has done a “damn good job”. It is a very thorough report, he 
says.
