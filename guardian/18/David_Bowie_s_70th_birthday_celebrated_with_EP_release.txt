.

Of the new material, Killing a Little Time crackles with abrasive heavy rock, 
while When I Met You is chugging guitar pop that opens with the line “You have 
just everything / But nothing at all / Now the moon is dark / Feels like pain 
again.” No Plan is melancholic and jazz-infused, and comes with a video 
directed by Tom Hingston that references Bowie’s first starring film role in 
The Man Who Fell to Earth.

Elsewhere, stars have paid tribute to the late musician, including legendary 
producerTony Visconti, who tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/Tonuspomus/status/817907260584316929>: “Happy Birthday 
dear old friend. Forever.” along with a rare photo of the iconic musician. A 
charity concert at Brixton Academy saw thousands of fans gather to watch 
musicians including Duran Duran’s Simon Le Bon, Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott and 
La Roux perform Bowie hits. The show was held on Sunday 8 January, which would 
have been Bowie’s 70th birthday.
