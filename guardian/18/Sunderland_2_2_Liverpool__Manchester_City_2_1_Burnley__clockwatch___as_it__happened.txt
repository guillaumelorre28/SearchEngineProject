Scenes at Ashton Gate and Ewood Park ...

Championship: It’s been a helter-skelter afternoon in the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship>, where Reading have come 
from 2-0 down against Bristol City to win 3-2 courtesy of two late goals from 
Yann Kermogant. At Ewood Park, Newcastle were shock losers against Blackburn, 
enabling Brighton - 2-1 come-from-behind winners at Fulham - to leapfrog them 
into first place in the table.

GOAL! Manchester City 2-1 Burnley

Premier League: After a poor attempt at a clearance by Claudio Bravo, there’s 
a goalmouth scramble at the Etihad and the ball is poked home by Ben Mee at the 
first attempt, or perhaps Andre Gray at the third. It’s 10-man City 2-1 Burnley.

Brentford miss a penalty

Championship: Brentford get a penalty for a Ryan SHotton foul that was clearly 
outside the penalty area. Scott Hogan does the decent thing and misses, 
bringing a fine save out of Tomasz Kuszczak. It remains 1-1 at St Andrew’s.

GOAL! West Brom 2-1 Hull City

Premier League: West Brom come from behind to go 2-1 up in a match that seems 
to have been turned on its head since half-time. Gareth McAuley puts the 
Baggies ahead with a header that takes a while to go in. It appears to have 
been blocked on the line, but the referee’s on-wrist magic witch portal 
declares that a goal has been scored.

Those second halves are kicking off ...

Liverpool have made a change: James Milner was given quite the run-around by 
Fabio Borini during the first half, picking up a yellow card in the process and 
has been replaced by Alberto Moreno. I don’t know if Milner is injured or Herr 
Klopp is just concerned he might get sent off. Meanwhile at the Eithad, Pep 
Guardiola has replaced Kelechi Iheanacho and Jesus Navas with Sergio Aguero and 
David Silva.

More goals in the third tier

League One: Josh Magennis has just headed Charlton level with Bristol Rovers 
from close range at the Valley, where it’s 1-1. At Sixfields, talk that 
Northampton have taken a 1-0 lead against Bradford City thanks to Alexander 
Revell might well be Cobblers.

Championship: It’s been a helter-skelter afternoon in the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship>, where Reading have come 
from 2-0 down against Bristol City to win 3-2 courtesy of two late goals from 
Yann Kermogant. At Ewood Park, Newcastle were shock losers against Blackburn, 
enabling Brighton - 2-1 come-from-behind winners at Fulham - to leapfrog them 
into first place in the table.
 
Premier League: Fernandinho’s dismissal didn’t prevent Manchester City taking 
the points courtesy of goals from Gael Clichy and Sergio Aguero, but they had 
to work hard for them.
 
Premier League: Three second-half goals in 16 minutes gave Everton all three 
points at Goodison Park and made it three consecutive defeats for Southampton.
 
Premier League: Liverpool escaped from the Stadium of Light with a point they 
scarcely deserved as imperious, injury-ravaged Sunderland scored twice from the 
spot courtesy of Jermain Defoe.
 
Premier League: Three second-half goals enabled West Brom to come from behind 
and beat Hull City at the Hawthorns.
 
Premier League: Sunderland’s Papy Djiloboji sustained a nasty knock on the 
head that needed lengthy treatment during added time, so they’re still playing 
at the Stadium of Light.
 
Championship: Birmingham fans were unimpressed with his appointment to begin 
with and he’s yet to record a win. His side trail Brentford 3-1 at home.
 
Championship: Reading have come from two goals down to make it 2-2 at Ashton 
Gate in their match against Bristol City.

to give Barnsley a one-goal lead at the City Ground.
 
Championship: Pawel Wszolek scores in the 83rd minute to put QPR back in the 
lead against Ipswich Town. It was a beautiful finish from Wszolek, who got in 
behind the defence to take down a long ball from the back with a beautiful 
touch, take it around the goalkeeper and slot home.
 
Premier League: Leighton Baines doesn’t miss too penalties either.

free-kick.
 
Championship: Nelson Butterfield has scored his second and third of the 
afternoon in rat-a-tat style to put Norwich City 2-0 up against Derby, who had 
Jacob Butterfield sent off after 66 minutes. At Elland Road, Leeds United are 
now 3-0 up against Rotherham and looking good for their ninth win in 12Premier 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> games. Chris Wood 
has bagged a brace in the 66th and 79th minutes. Huddersfield have just gone 
1-0 up at Wigan, but we’re off to the Stadium of Light ...

Valencia has given Everton the lead against Southampton, who are winless in 
three.

Championship: Brighton have scored two in two minutes to come from behind and 
lead Fulham at Craven Cottage. Tommer Hemed equalised from the spot, before 
Lewis Dunk put Brighton ahead. Their fans will be further delighted by news 
from Ewood Park, where title rivals Newcastle have just gone behind to 
Blackburn. Charlie Mulgrew has put the home side ahead with a free-kick into 
the corner from 22 yards.
 
Premier League: West Brom singer-songwriter James Morrison riffs on Hull 
City’s second half-time pain.

Premier League: Liverpool win a corner and Sadio Mane stabs home to put 
Liverpool 2-1 up. Sunderland’s players claim he was offside, but the ref points 
to the centre-circle.

Premier League: After a poor attempt at a clearance by Claudio Bravo, there’s 
a goalmouth scramble at the Etihad and the ball is poked home by Ben Mee at the 
first attempt, or perhaps Andre Gray at the third. It’s 10-man City 2-1 Burnley.

Championship: Brentford get a penalty for a Ryan SHotton foul that was clearly 
outside the penalty area. Scott Hogan does the decent thing and misses, 
bringing a fine save out of Tomasz Kuszczak. It remains 1-1 at St Andrew’s.
 
Premier League: West Brom come from behind to go 2-1 up in a match that seems 
to have been turned on its head since half-time. Gareth McAuley puts the 
Baggies ahead with a header that takes a while to go in. It appears to have 
been blocked on the line, but the referee’s on-wrist magic witch portal 
declares that a goal has been scored.

Premier League: Half-time substitute Sergio Aguero doubles 10-man City’s lead 
with a goal that may yet go down as a Matthew Lowton own-goal.

Championship: Brentford have equalised against Birmingham City courtesy of 
Scott Hogan, reducing Gianfranco Zola’s chances of registering his first

and the general consensus at the Stadium of Light - surprisingly enough - seems 
to be that Sunderland have been denied a clear penalty.
 
Premier League: Gael Clichy cuts inside, shifts the ball on to his right foot 
and fires past Tom Heaton to give 10-man Manchester City the lead against 
Burnley after 58 minutes.

it’s almost identical to his first. He pops up to head past Will Puddy from six 
or seven yards to make it Charlton 2-1 Bristol Rovers at the Valley.
 
Championship: The goals are flying in around the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship>, where Lucas Piazon has 
just curled a beauty into the bottom right-hand corner to give the home side 
the lead against high-flying Brighton.

season and restore parity at the Hawthorns.

Liverpool have made a change: James Milner was given quite the run-around by 
Fabio Borini during the first half, picking up a yellow card in the process and 
has been replaced by Alberto Moreno. I don’t know if Milner is injured or Herr 
Klopp is just concerned he might get sent off. Meanwhile at the Eithad, Pep 
Guardiola has replaced Kelechi Iheanacho and Jesus Navas with Sergio Aguero and 
David Silva.
