A report on obesity rates in Australia shows a widening gap between country 
and city.

An Australian Institute of Health 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health> and Welfare (AIHW) report 
has found adults living in regional Australia were significantly more likely to 
be overweight or obese.

The report was released on Thursday, weeks after data showed Australia’s 
wealthiest postcodes were the healthiest and has led to calls from the 
Australian Medical Association New South Wales for urgent action.

Based on data from Australia’s 31 Primary Health Networks (PHNs), the 
institute’s Healthy Communities report found those living in countrySouth 
Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> had the 
highest rate of obesity in the country.

But even in the area of Australia that fared best, northern Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>, 50% of the population were 
either overweight or obese.

In 2014-15, there was an estimated 11.2 million Australian adults who were 
overweight or obese – one of the biggest risk factors for disease.

More men than women were considered too heavy, with 70.8% of males overweight 
or obese compared with 56.3% of females.

The highest rate of overweight and obese adults was in country South Australia 
at 73% – that’s almost three in four people – while northern Sydney had the 
lowest rate, at 53%.

As for the metro areas, the Nepean Blue Mountains, which takes in the western 
Sydney region of Penrith, had the highest rate (66.9%) of overweight and obese 
adults.

When looking at only obesity – a body mass index (BMI) of 30 and above – a 
wider variation was seen in adults across PHN areas. “With obesity we see even 
wider variation with 16% of adults who were shown to be obese in central and 
eastern Sydney, compared with 38% in country South Australia.

“Again, the highest obesity rates were recorded in regional areas,” said AIHW 
spokesman Michael Frost.

Australia’s health tracker by area online tool 
<http://www.atlasesaustralia.com.au/ahpc/aust-health-tracker-area.html>, 
launched in November, showed Queensland topped the table for high rates of 
obesity.

The president of the AMA (NSW), Brad Frankum, said obesity was a national 
health crisis that could no longer be put in the “too-hard basket” by 
Australian governments. “The longer we go without action, the more difficult it 
will be to solve,” he added.

An additional report by the AIHW showed daily smoking rates also remained 
relatively high in regional areas compared with urban areas.
