Tom Varndell equalled Mark Cueto’s Premiership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/premiership> try-scoring record of 90 as 
Bristol superbly came from behind to defeat Sale 24-23 at the AJ Bell Stadium. 
Despite a slow start, Sale hit their straps to take a 15-0 lead through a 
penalty try and Denny Solomona’s touchdown, while James Mitchell added five 
points from the tee.

But the visitors managed to reduce the arrears by the interval via Jason 
Woodward’s three-pointer and Varndell’s converted score. Mitchell’s penalty and 
Johnny Leota’s converted score looked to have taken the Sharks clear but 
converted tries from Rhodri Williams and Max Crumpton gaveBristol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bristolrugby> the win.

Elsewhere, Harlequins’ dreadful away form continued as they crashed to a 24-17 
defeat at the hands of strugglingWorcester. It was Quins’ 12th defeat in their 
last 13 Premiership away games. They also lost four players through injury with 
Chris Robshaw, Jamie Roberts, Jack Clifford and George Merrick all failing to 
complete the game.

There was also a yellow card for Joe Marler as Quins’ eight-man England 
contingent were easily outshone by an outstanding performance from the home 
side. Te’o and Dean Hammond scored tries with Ryan Mills adding a conversion 
and four penalties. Charlie Matthews and Alofa Alofa scored tries for Quins 
with Tim Swiel converting both and adding a penalty.
