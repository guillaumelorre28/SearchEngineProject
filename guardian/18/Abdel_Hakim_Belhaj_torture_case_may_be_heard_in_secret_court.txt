One of the first cases to be heard by the government's new generation of 
secret courts may be a claim brought by a Libyan dissident who was kidnapped 
along with his pregnant wife and flown to one of Muammar Gaddafi's prisons.

Abdel Hakim Belhaj <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/abdel-hakim-belhaj> is 
suing the former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, former head 
of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the British government and its 
intelligence agencies, over the so-called extraordinary rendition operation 
from 2004.

The high court in London heard on Tuesday that ministers would probably move 
to have the case heard under the secrecy provisions of the controversialJustice 
and Security Act <http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/justice-and-security>, which 
comes into force in July.

"The new act will apply to these proceedings," Rory Phillips QC, representing 
the government, told the court at a preliminary hearing. "It is likely that 
such an application will be made."

The act has faced criticism from lawyers and human rights groups who argue 
that its primary intention is not to protect intelligence-sharing arrangements 
with foreign states – as ministers argued when it was passing through 
parliament – but to conceal evidence of government wrongdoing in cases such as 
that brought by Belhaj.

Straw, Allen and the government face claims for damages from Belhaj and his 
wife, Fatima Bouchar, who accuse them of false imprisonment, conspiracy to 
injure and trespass to person, misfeasance in public office and negligence.

Richard Hermer QC, for the couple, predicted that there was "likely to be a 
lively debate" between the two sides over the circumstances in which the 
secrecy provisions of the act could be relied upon by the government.

Phillips made clear, however, that the defendants were keen to reach a 
negotiated settlement with Belhaj.

"They would be pleased to enter into a settlement process to draw a line under 
this case," he said.

"The defendants would like to reiterate … their willingness to sit down with 
Mr Belhaj and his representatives, face to face, in order to see if we can 
reach a settlement."

Belhaj and Bouchar's lawyers believe the pair has a strong case, based in part 
on a secret intelligence file discovered by the New York-based NGOHuman Rights 
Watch 
<http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/09/08/usuk-documents-reveal-libya-rendition-details>
 during the revolution that toppled Gaddafi.

The file contained a number of letters from Allen to the dictator's 
intelligence chief,Moussa Koussa <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/moussa-koussa>
, including one in which the MI6 officer made clear that although he did not 
pay for what he described as "the air cargo", the intelligence that had led to 
the couple being detained and "rendered" had originated with his agency.

Other documents discovered at the time showed that MI6 was involved in a 
second operation in which another Libyan dissident,Sami al-Saadi 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/24/britain-family-gaddafi-legal>, was 
kidnapped and flown to Tripoli along with his wife and four children, the 
youngest a six-year-old girl.Al-Saadi settled his claim 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/dec/13/libyan-dissident-mi6-aided-rendition> 
against the British government with a payment of £2.2m.

Belhaj has offered to settle his claim with a payment of just £1 from each of 
the defendants, but insists thatthey must admit their guilt and apologise to him
 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/04/libyan-politician-uk-lawsuit-apology>
, and particularly to his wife.

Despite being visibly pregnant, Bouchar was allegedly chained to a wall when 
detained by the CIA in Bangkok <> before being taped head and foot to a 
stretcher for the 17-hour flight to Tripoli. She was then held for several 
months while her husband was being interrogated and allegedly tortured nearby.

Such an apology is unlikely to be forthcoming, however, as the two UK-Libyan 
rendition operations are the subject of aScotland Yard investigation 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/23/mi6-al-qaida-investigation> – one 
of four police investigations into the activities of British intelligence 
officers in the years after 9/11.

The high court case was adjourned until October, when the government will 
argue that the case cannot be tried in an English court, as the events took 
place outside the UK, and involved foreign intelligence officers.

Were this to be accepted by the courts, Hermer argued, "then whenever agents 
of the British state are involved in joint operations with agents of a foreign 
state, they enjoy complete immunity".

The kidnap, torture and arbitrary detention that the couple suffered were 
offences not only in English law, but "fundamental breaches of international 
law".

Straw and Allen are also arguing that they are unable to respond 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/02/abdel-hakim-belhaj-jack-straw> 
to the allegations because of the restraints of the Official Secrets Act.
