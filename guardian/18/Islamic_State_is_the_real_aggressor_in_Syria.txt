, 5 January) refers to Russian interference in Syria to support the 
dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad against his own people. In fact, Vladimir Putin 
is supporting Syria against the brutal invasion of Islamic State, which has 
been armed and financed, by proxy, through the US client states Saudi Arabia, 
Qatar and Turkey in order to destabilise Syria (as related by US journalist 
Seymour Hersh, among others). Islamists have been used repeatedly by western 
and regional powers in recent history against progressive Arab socialism 
and nationalism. Saudi Arabia’s former intelligence chief, Prince Bandar, 
advised using radical Islamists to destroy the Syrian regime at a high-profile 
meeting with the CIA.

This intervention is not designed to promote democracy or human rights (hence 
the pivotal alliance with the brutal Saudi regime), fitting into a catalogue of
US foreign policy <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-foreign-policy> 
interventions against “rogue” states deemed to be inimical to its interests, to 
guarantee geopolitical hegemony.
