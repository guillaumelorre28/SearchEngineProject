Cooperâ€™s opponent will be announced next week for the 3 February bout at 
Adelaide Oval.

Middleweight prospect Tim Tszyu will also be on the undercard, squaring off in 
his second professional fight, with local charge Mark Dalby.

Cooper, who is back in Australia with the Queensland Reds following a year 
with French Top 14 club Toulon and trying his luck with the Australian rugby 
sevens team, won his first two fights as a pro.

In 2013, he made his debut in the ring, knocking out Barry Dunnett in the 
first round of a cruiserweight contest.

And in 2014, he beat Warren Tresidder by technical knockout in the fourth 
round.
