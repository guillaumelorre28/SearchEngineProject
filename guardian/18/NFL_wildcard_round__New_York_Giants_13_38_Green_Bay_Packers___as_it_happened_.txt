Final thoughts

Michael P: 


Didn’t see this thrashing coming..Rodgers gets his second ring fer shure!

It was an impressive outing for the Green Bay quarterback, especially since he 
was playing without Jordy Nelson, maybe his favorite target, for much of the 
game. Before they think Super Bowl, they will have to face the Dallas Cowboys 
next Sunday. That should be a great game.

And that will do it from us here at the Guardian. Thanks for following along 
with all theNFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> action over this 
weekend, especially those who contributed. (Sorry I couldn’t include 
everybody’s commentary.) Ciao!

Giants 13-38 Packers, 1:00, 4th quarter

Manning’s 4th & 6 pass to King is complete, which means this game has to keep 
going. King picks up 18 yards to the Green Bay 37.

Jennings picks up a few yards, setting up a 2nd & 6 situation. Manning’s next 
pass is incomplete.

But he hits Shepard for a first down. The inevitable continues to be delayed.

Giants 13-38 Packers, 2:00, 4th quarter

And we’ve hit the part of the game where the Giants have to keep on playing 
even though a win is out of their reach. The two minute warning comes with the 
Giants at their own 45.

Touchdown (Packers)

Giants 13-38 Packers, 2:43, 4th quarter

Montgomery gets the ball to the Giants one yard line, causing the Giants to 
call a timeout mainly because they might as well at this point.

Out of the timeout, Ripkowski forces his way into the end zone for another 
Packers touchdown. Crosby’s extra point is good and this… this is over, 
basically.

Fumble (Giants)

Giants 13-31 Packers, 8:44, 4th quarter

Clay Matthews sacks Manning for a 7 yard loss and it’s ruled a fumble on the 
field, recovered by Matthews. There’s a delay as they review it.

Yep it’s Green Bay ball!

Touchdown (Packers)

Giants 13-31 Packers, 9:19, 4th quarter

Rodgers picks up a yard all by himself. Then on 2nd & 9, he finds Adams yet 
again. He picks up 6 yards, taking them to the Giants 16.

And the very next play, Rodgers throws to Cobb who makes a two-handed grab in 
the end zone for his third touchdown catch of the game!

Crosby’s extra point attempts good! And the Giants are officially in trouble.

Giants 13-24 Packers, 12:18, 4th quarter

Montgomery loses the ball after picking up a single yard, it looks like the 
Giants recover.. but the officials call the play dead. That’s the good news for 
Green Bay, the bad news is that Montgomery hurt himself on the play and is 
coming off the field.

Giants 13-24 Packers, 13:03, 4th quarter

The Packers start on their own 20, Rodgers finds Adams for a ten yard gain. 
After an incomplete pass and a stuffed Montgomery run, it looks like the Giants 
can get Green Bay off the field, but Rodgers connects with a running Montgomery 
who makes it to the Giants’ 36 yard line.

Giants 13-24 Packers, end of the 3rd quarter

is this the first touchback of the game? I believe so. The Giants start at 
their own 25, except they get a false start penalty. So make that their own 20. 
Rashad Jennings picks up four yards and that will be the end of the third 
quarter.
Anthony Washington (@freedom_coach) 
@HunterFelt <https://twitter.com/HunterFelt> the fourth quarter will be 
crucial. This will be one of the best quarters of football all season!

Field goal (Packers)

Giants 13-24 Packers, :25, 3rd quarter

Rodgers finds Adams deep…he gets the Packers to the 14 yard line but the 
Giants manage to make a defensive stand. Green Bay can’t get any closer and 
settle for a 32 yard field goal, which is good.

Giants 13-21 Packers, 2:10, 3rd quarter

Crosby’s kick pins the Giants back at their 3. On 1st & 10, Manning throws to 
Tye for a gain of 7 yards. Manning’s next throw, is incomplete. His next is…. 
nearly intercepted, but the ball is ruled as down by contact.

And the Giants have to punt.

I don’t think they can quite run the clock out yet, but they decided the first 
part of this suggestion made a lot of sense.

Touchdown (Packers)

Giants 13-21 Packers, 3:00, 3rd quarter

Unbelievable. Rodgers finds Cobb for a 30 yard touchdown, and just like that 
all of the Giants’ momentum dissipates. Crosby’s extra kick is good and the 
Packers extend their lead.

Wow.

Giants 13-14 Packers, 3:42, 3rd quarter

Michael gets stuffed for no gain on 1st & 10. Rodgers targets Cook on 2nd & 
10, and Cook goes off for a 13 yard gain. Packers are already at midfield.

Nope, now they’re at the Giants 30 after Rodgers connects with Adams for a 20 
yard gain!

Well that decision to go for it on 4th & 1 is going to haunt Green Bay if they 
lose today.

Michael is back on the field to receive the Giants kickoff, which he carries 
31 yards to the Green Bay 37.

Touchdown (Giants)!

Giants 13-14 Packers, 5:23, 3rd quarter

On 1st & 10, Perkins gets… nothing. No gain.

On 2nd & 10, Manning finds Tavarres King for a 41 yard touchdown! The extra 
point is good! This is a one point game!

Turnover on downs (Packers)

Giants 6-14 Packers, 6:08, 3rd quarter

It’s 4th and . The Packers go for it on their own 42 and…

it’s for a loss. The Giants push back Montgomery for a one yard loss and they 
take over on downs! Huge, huge opportunity for the Giants here.

Giants 6-14 Packers, 6:42, 3rd quarter

Nelson has been ruled out for the rest of the game. Bad, bad news for Green 
Bay as Rodgers loses his favorite target.

Ripkowski gets the ball again and it’s looking like they are just short.

And they keep feeding the ball to Michael. He picks up 9 for a first down, and 
then an additional 4.

It’s 2nd & 6 at Green Bay’s 37. Rodgers targets Aaron Ripkowski this time 
around. He picks up 5 yards.

It’s 3rd & 1, nd the Packers take a timeout.

Christine Michael makes his first appearance of he game, and immediately goes 
off for 10 yards.

That seemed to work well for the first time, so the Packers go with Michael 
again. It’s for four yards, this time.

The Packers start at their 10 after Hyde makes a fair catch. At this point, I 
recommend that they run out of time and throw a desperate heave into the end 
zone, since it seems like that works for them.

It looks like there’s a danger that the drive is going to stall here. Manning 
can’t find Perkins on first down. On second down, Perkins picks up only four 
yards and on 3rd & *, Peppers breaks up a pass to Beckham.

And the Giants have to punt as well.

Giants at their own 40. Manning and Beckham fail to connect once again. On 2nd 
and 10 they get on the same page on a catch-and-run. Beckham picks up 8 yards.

They decide to try that again on 3rd and 2, it’s a 7 yard gain. The Giants 
have a first down at the Green Bay 45.

Giants 6-14 Packers, 12:46, 3rd quarter

The Packers punt. The Giants start at their own 26 after nearly muffing a punt 
return. Perkins picks up 14 yards, immediately good for a first down.

Packers get the ball to start the second half but they can’t make anything out 
of it. They go 3 and out.

Michael P emailed this after the first Green Bay touchdown, but it’s probably 
even more relevant now:

Wow, that was unbelievable, no other QB could make that play!!! MVP, no 
question only Carr merits equivalent consideration, they both make their teams, 
are irreplaceable. Rodgers is simply the best ever.

Hail mary touchdown! (Packers)

Giants 6-14 Packers, end of the first half

On 2nd & 1, Rodgers’ s pass is incomplete. 3rd & 1, Montgomery goes off for 6 
yards. The Packers have the first down but they’re running out of time.

1st & 10 at their own 35, Rodgers finds Cobb, who gets Green Bay midfield.

Rodgers’s pass to Adams is incomplete. 2nd & 10, Montgomery gets 8 yards. 3rd 
& 2, Rodgers throws incomplete.

It’s 4th and 2, with time expiring, and Rodgers throws a 42 yard Hail Mary 
attempt: and it’s grabbed by Cobb for a TOUCHDOWN. ARE YOU KIDDING?

Mason Crosby’s extra point is good and, somehow, the Packers have increased 
their lead!

Touchdown (Packers)!

Giants 6-7 Packers, 2:32, 2nd quarter

On 1st goal, Montgomery picks up two yards. On 2nd & goal, Rodgers dances his 
way out of contact, it’s like he has all day out there, before he eventually 
sees Adams and throws a beauty of a pass for the first touchdown of the game.

And Mason Crosby’s extra point attempt is good. The Packers have the lead.

Giants 6-0 Packers, 3:45, 2nd quarter

Wing’s 37 yard punt puts the Packers at the Giants 38. There Rodgers makes a 
pas to Adams AND THERE IS THE GREEN BAY OFFENSE. Adams gets brought down at the 
Giants 7. Biggest play of the game so far.

Giants 6-0 Packers, 4:38, 2nd quarter

On 2nd & 6, Manning throws incomplete to King. On the next play, Julius 
Peppers makes his presence known by sacking Manning for a loss of four yards 
and that will bring on the Giants’ punting unit.

Giants 6-0 Packers, 5:14, 2nd quarter

And Rodgers throws the ball away. In fact, so clearly that he gets an 
intentional grounding penalty that will push them back 10 yards. The Packers 
are going to have to punt yet again.

Rodgers and Cook connect for 17 yards and just like that they’re at the Giants

On 1st and 10, Rodgers is sacked but without a loss. On 2nd & 10, Cook gets 6 
yards. Crucial conversion coming up.

Janis returns Gould’s kickoff to the Packers’ 44 yard line. Not a bad starting 
point.

Field goal! Giants!

Giants 6-0 Packers, 9:13, 2nd quarter

At Green Bay’s 28, Manning finds Cruz for a gain of 6 yards. Manning’s next 
two passes are incomplete, so the field goal unit comes in again. Robbie Gould 
makes the 40 harder to increase the New York lead.

Giants 3-0 Packers, 9:13, 2nd quarter

Manning targets Beckham, who holds on this time around. He gains around 2 
yards. In the next play, Jennings goes 11 yards for a first down.

And Manning throws deep to the tight end Tye, who breaks free for 51 yards 
before being taken down by Ha Ha Clinton-Dix. Huge gain!

Giants 3-0 Packers, 10:29, 2nd quarter

Schum with an excellent punt here. It goes 58 yards and Harris is able to 
return it just 3 yards. The Giants will be starting at their 8th.

Bad news for Green Bay, Jordy Nelson was injured after taking a big hit during 
the Packers’ last possession.

Michael P: 


Didn’t see this thrashing coming..Rodgers gets his second ring fer shure!

It was an impressive outing for the Green Bay quarterback, especially since he 
was playing without Jordy Nelson, maybe his favorite target, for much of the 
game. Before they think Super Bowl, they will have to face the Dallas Cowboys 
next Sunday. That should be a great game.

And that will do it from us here at the Guardian. Thanks for following along 
with all theNFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> action over this 
weekend, especially those who contributed. (Sorry I couldn’t include 
everybody’s commentary.) Ciao!
 
Giants 13-38 Packers, FINAL

And Randall intercepts Eli Manning, takes it to the Giants 30 and that will be 
that. The Packers have won!
 
Giants 13-38 Packers, 1:00, 4th quarter

Manning’s 4th & 6 pass to King is complete, which means this game has to keep 
going. King picks up 18 yards to the Green Bay 37.

Jennings picks up a few yards, setting up a 2nd & 6 situation. Manning’s next 
pass is incomplete.

But he hits Shepard for a first down. The inevitable continues to be delayed.
 
Giants 13-38 Packers, 2:00, 4th quarter

And we’ve hit the part of the game where the Giants have to keep on playing 
even though a win is out of their reach. The two minute warning comes with the 
Giants at their own 45.
 
Giants 13-38 Packers, 2:43, 4th quarter

Montgomery gets the ball to the Giants one yard line, causing the Giants to 
call a timeout mainly because they might as well at this point.

Out of the timeout, Ripkowski forces his way into the end zone for another 
Packers touchdown. Crosby’s extra point is good and this… this is over, 
basically.
 
Giants 13-31 Packers, 3:52, 4th quarter

Rodgers starts handing the ball to Michael, who gets them to the Giants 14 
yard line. Green Bay takes their final timeout.
 
Giants 13-31 Packers, 7:03, 4th quarter

Packers start at their own 46. Rodgers finds Geronimo Allison for a 8 yard 
gain. Next time around, Rodgers finds Adams once again and he gets it to the 
Giants 28 yard line.
 
Giants 13-31 Packers, 8:44, 4th quarter

Clay Matthews sacks Manning for a 7 yard loss and it’s ruled a fumble on the 
field, recovered by Matthews. There’s a delay as they review it.

Yep it’s Green Bay ball!

 
Giants 13-31 Packers, 9:12, 4th quarter

Beckham returns Crosby’s kickoff to the Giants 33 yard line, a 24 yard gain. 
Giants are in the shotgun formation, Manning throws to King for a 14 yard gain.
 
Giants 13-31 Packers, 9:19, 4th quarter

Rodgers picks up a yard all by himself. Then on 2nd & 9, he finds Adams yet 
again. He picks up 6 yards, taking them to the Giants 16.

And the very next play, Rodgers throws to Cobb who makes a two-handed grab in 
the end zone for his third touchdown catch of the game!

Crosby’s extra point attempts good! And the Giants are officially in trouble.
 
Giants 13-24 Packers, 11:31, 4th quarter

It’s 3rd and 9 for Green Bay. Rodgers finds Adams once again, this time for 12 
yards. The Packers pick up the first down at the Giants 23.
 
Giants 13-24 Packers, 11:31, 4th quarter

Rodgers’s throw is incomplete and the Packers take a timeout.

Michael P:

Still a whole quarter to play. Wouldn’t count the Giants out just yet
 
Giants 13-24 Packers, 12:18, 4th quarter

Montgomery loses the ball after picking up a single yard, it looks like the 
Giants recover.. but the officials call the play dead. That’s the good news for 
Green Bay, the bad news is that Montgomery hurt himself on the play and is 
coming off the field.
 
Giants 13-24 Packers, 13:03, 4th quarter

The Packers start on their own 20, Rodgers finds Adams for a ten yard gain. 
After an incomplete pass and a stuffed Montgomery run, it looks like the Giants 
can get Green Bay off the field, but Rodgers connects with a running Montgomery 
who makes it to the Giants’ 36 yard line.
 
Giants 13-24 Packers, 14:52, 4th quarter

Manning’s next two throws are to Beckham, who *almost* makes a great catch but 
doesn’t. The Giants have to punt,
 
Giants 13-24 Packers, end of the 3rd quarter

is this the first touchback of the game? I believe so. The Giants start at 
their own 25, except they get a false start penalty. So make that their own 20. 
Rashad Jennings picks up four yards and that will be the end of the third 
quarter.
Anthony Washington (@freedom_coach) 
@HunterFelt <https://twitter.com/HunterFelt> the fourth quarter will be 
crucial. This will be one of the best quarters of football all season!

<https://twitter.com/freedom_coach/status/818246465361281024>  
Giants 13-24 Packers, :25, 3rd quarter

Rodgers finds Adams deep…he gets the Packers to the 14 yard line but the 
Giants manage to make a defensive stand. Green Bay can’t get any closer and 
settle for a 32 yard field goal, which is good.
 
Giants 13-21 Packers, 1:50, 3rd quarter

And Micah Hyde returns Wing’s pun all the way to the Giants 37 yard line. Oh 
wow, things are not looking great for the Giants here, momentum-wise.
 
Giants 13-21 Packers, 2:10, 3rd quarter

Crosby’s kick pins the Giants back at their 3. On 1st & 10, Manning throws to 
Tye for a gain of 7 yards. Manning’s next throw, is incomplete. His next is…. 
nearly intercepted, but the ball is ruled as down by contact.

And the Giants have to punt.
 MsElectra__ (@MsElectra__) 
@HunterFelt <https://twitter.com/HunterFelt> the giants defense is good but i 
don't think it'll be good enough#Packers 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Packers?src=hash> need another TD then let the 
clock run

<https://twitter.com/MsElectra__/status/818243165316583425> 
I don’t think they can quite run the clock out yet, but they decided the first 
part of this suggestion made a lot of sense.
 
Giants 13-21 Packers, 3:00, 3rd quarter

Unbelievable. Rodgers finds Cobb for a 30 yard touchdown, and just like that 
all of the Giants’ momentum dissipates. Crosby’s extra kick is good and the 
Packers extend their lead.

Wow.
 
Giants 13-14 Packers, 3:42, 3rd quarter

Michael gets stuffed for no gain on 1st & 10. Rodgers targets Cook on 2nd & 
10, and Cook goes off for a 13 yard gain. Packers are already at midfield.

Nope, now they’re at the Giants 30 after Rodgers connects with Adams for a 20 
yard gain!
 
Giants 13-14 Packers, 5:09, 3rd quarter

Well that decision to go for it on 4th & 1 is going to haunt Green Bay if they 
lose today.

Michael is back on the field to receive the Giants kickoff, which he carries 
31 yards to the Green Bay 37.
 
Giants 13-14 Packers, 5:23, 3rd quarter

On 1st & 10, Perkins gets… nothing. No gain.

On 2nd & 10, Manning finds Tavarres King for a 41 yard touchdown! The extra 
point is good! This is a one point game!
 
Giants 6-14 Packers, 6:08, 3rd quarter

It’s 4th and . The Packers go for it on their own 42 and…

it’s for a loss. The Giants push back Montgomery for a one yard loss and they 
take over on downs! Huge, huge opportunity for the Giants here.
 
Giants 6-14 Packers, 6:42, 3rd quarter

Nelson has been ruled out for the rest of the game. Bad, bad news for Green 
Bay as Rodgers loses his favorite target.

Ripkowski gets the ball again and it’s looking like they are just short.
 
Giants 6-14 Packers, 6:42, 3rd quarter

And they keep feeding the ball to Michael. He picks up 9 for a first down, and 
then an additional 4.

It’s 2nd & 6 at Green Bay’s 37. Rodgers targets Aaron Ripkowski this time 
around. He picks up 5 yards.

It’s 3rd & 1, nd the Packers take a timeout.
 
Giants 6-14 Packers, 9:29, 3rd quarter

Christine Michael makes his first appearance of he game, and immediately goes 
off for 10 yards.

That seemed to work well for the first time, so the Packers go with Michael 
again. It’s for four yards, this time.
 
Giants 6-14 Packers, 10:17, 3rd quarter

The Packers start at their 10 after Hyde makes a fair catch. At this point, I 
recommend that they run out of time and throw a desperate heave into the end 
zone, since it seems like that works for them.
 
Giants 6-14 Packers, 10:21, 3rd quarter

It looks like there’s a danger that the drive is going to stall here. Manning 
can’t find Perkins on first down. On second down, Perkins picks up only four 
yards and on 3rd & *, Peppers breaks up a pass to Beckham.

And the Giants have to punt as well.
 
Giants 6-14 Packers, 11:27, 3rd quarter

Giants at their own 40. Manning and Beckham fail to connect once again. On 2nd 
and 10 they get on the same page on a catch-and-run. Beckham picks up 8 yards.

They decide to try that again on 3rd and 2, it’s a 7 yard gain. The Giants 
have a first down at the Green Bay 45.
 
Giants 6-14 Packers, 12:46, 3rd quarter

The Packers punt. The Giants start at their own 26 after nearly muffing a punt 
return. Perkins picks up 14 yards, immediately good for a first down.
 
Giants 6-14 Packers, 13:30, 3rd quarter

Packers get the ball to start the second half but they can’t make anything out 
of it. They go 3 and out.
 
This also feels more relevant now, unfortunately for Giants fans:

even more relevant now:

Wow, that was unbelievable, no other QB could make that play!!! MVP, no 
question only Carr merits equivalent consideration, they both make their teams, 
are irreplaceable. Rodgers is simply the best ever.
 
Just so you know I’m not making this up:

Giants 6-14 Packers, end of the first half

On 2nd & 1, Rodgers’ s pass is incomplete. 3rd & 1, Montgomery goes off for 6 
yards. The Packers have the first down but they’re running out of time.

1st & 10 at their own 35, Rodgers finds Cobb, who gets Green Bay midfield.

Rodgers’s pass to Adams is incomplete. 2nd & 10, Montgomery gets 8 yards. 3rd 
& 2, Rodgers throws incomplete.

It’s 4th and 2, with time expiring, and Rodgers throws a 42 yard Hail Mary 
attempt: and it’s grabbed by Cobb for a TOUCHDOWN. ARE YOU KIDDING?

Mason Crosby’s extra point is good and, somehow, the Packers have increased 
their lead!
 
Giants 6-7 Packers, 1:36, 2nd quarter

Hyde receives the Giants’ punt to the Packers 20. Packers are in shotgun. 
Montgomery goes off for nine yards.
 
Giants 6-7 Packers, 1:45, 2nd quarter

It’s a 3rd & 1 situation for the Giants. Manning hands off to Rainey, who gets 
stuffed by the Packers defense for no gain. Green Bay takes its final timeout.
 
Giants 6-7 Packers, 2:00, 2nd quarter

Perkins picks up a yard. Green Bay takes a timeout. 

On 2nd & 9, Manning hands the ball off to Bobby Rainey who gets to the Giants 
41 and takes us to the two minute warning.
 
Giants 6-7 Packers, 2:32, 2nd quarter

Harris receives the Packers’ kickoff to the Giants 32, a 31 yard gain. Green 
Bay CB Josh Hawkins is injured on the play.
 
Giants 6-7 Packers, 2:32, 2nd quarter

On 1st goal, Montgomery picks up two yards. On 2nd & goal, Rodgers dances his 
way out of contact, it’s like he has all day out there, before he eventually 
sees Adams and throws a beauty of a pass for the first touchdown of the game.

And Mason Crosby’s extra point attempt is good. The Packers have the lead.
 
Giants 6-0 Packers, 3:45, 2nd quarter

Wing’s 37 yard punt puts the Packers at the Giants 38. There Rodgers makes a 
pas to Adams AND THERE IS THE GREEN BAY OFFENSE. Adams gets brought down at the 
Giants 7. Biggest play of the game so far.
 
Giants 6-0 Packers, 4:38, 2nd quarter

On 2nd & 6, Manning throws incomplete to King. On the next play, Julius 
Peppers makes his presence known by sacking Manning for a loss of four yards 
and that will bring on the Giants’ punting unit.
 
Giants 6-0 Packers, 4:56, 2nd quarter

Perkins picks up four yards on 1st down and then play is stopped, because 
Packers linebacker Blake Martinez is injured on the play,
 
Giants 6-0 Packers, 5:06, 2nd quarter

Schum’s been the Packers MVP so far. His punt puts the Giants at their own 8 
yard line after a one yard return from Harris.
 
Giants 6-0 Packers, 5:14, 2nd quarter

And Rodgers throws the ball away. In fact, so clearly that he gets an 
intentional grounding penalty that will push them back 10 yards. The Packers 
are going to have to punt yet again.
 
Giants 6-0 Packers, 5:57, 2nd quarter

Rodgers and Cook connect for 17 yards and just like that they’re at the Giants 
40.

On 1st and 10, Rodgers is sacked but without a loss. On 2nd & 10, Cook gets 6 
yards. Crucial conversion coming up.
 
Giants 6-0 Packers, 7:29, 2nd quarter

Janis returns Gould’s kickoff to the Packers’ 44 yard line. Not a bad starting 
point.

Thanks, although the Packers aren’t currently in an ideal situation.
 
Giants 6-0 Packers, 9:13, 2nd quarter

At Green Bay’s 28, Manning finds Cruz for a gain of 6 yards. Manning’s next 
two passes are incomplete, so the field goal unit comes in again. Robbie Gould 
makes the 40 harder to increase the New York lead.

 
Giants 3-0 Packers, 9:13, 2nd quarter

Manning targets Beckham, who holds on this time around. He gains around 2 
yards. In the next play, Jennings goes 11 yards for a first down.

And Manning throws deep to the tight end Tye, who breaks free for 51 yards 
before being taken down by Ha Ha Clinton-Dix. Huge gain!
 
Giants 3-0 Packers, 10:29, 2nd quarter

Schum with an excellent punt here. It goes 58 yards and Harris is able to 
return it just 3 yards. The Giants will be starting at their 8th.

Bad news for Green Bay, Jordy Nelson was injured after taking a big hit during 
the Packers’ last possession.

 
Giants 3-0 Packers, 10:29, 2nd quarter

Rodgers makes a short pass to Randall Cobb, who gets the Packers 13 yards. 
It’s 1st & 10 at their own 35, Rodgers targets Nelson, but doesn’t connect. On 
2nd & 10, Montgomery picks up 2 yards. On 3rd & 8, Davante Adams can’t hold 
onto a Rodgers pass. The Packers will be punting once again.
 
Giants 3-0 Packers, 11:46, 2nd quarter

Manning attempts to find Shepard, but throws the ball out of bounds. The 
Giants punting unit makes a return appearance.

Micah Hyde returns Wing’s punt to the Packers 22 yard line, which is where 
they’ll start their next drive attempt.
 
Giants 3-0 Packers, 11:54, 2nd quarter

Manning finds Tye for a three yard gain. On 3rd & 6, the Giants take a timeout.
