The United States has said it was troubled by the arrest of a Malaysian 
activist and critic of prime minister Najib Razak.


 Maria Chin Abdullah, the chair of pro-democracy group Bersih, was detained on 
Friday under Malaysia’s Security Offences (Special Measures) Act, or Sosma, a 
law that was introduced in 2012 to fight security and extremist threats.

.

 “We are troubled by the ongoing detention and solitary confinement of Maria 
Chin Abdullah under national security laws,” Alicia Edwards, a spokeswoman for 
the US state department, told Reuters in an emailed statement.

 The US is also concerned about the Malaysian authorities’ arrest of a number 
of other organisers, activists and politicians ahead of and during the 
demonstration, she said.

 Nearly a dozen activists and opposition leaders were arrested a day before 
the rally but they have all been released except Chin Abdullah. Several were 
also detained on the day of the rally.

“The United States remains committed to the strong and growing partnership we 
have with Malaysia. In the spirit of that partnership, US officials routinely 
and strongly voice our concerns about the rule of law, human rights, and 
fundamental freedoms with the government ofMalaysia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia>, and we will continue to do so,” 
Edwards said.

 Maria, who is 60, is being held in solitary confinement in a cell 4.5m (15 
feet) by 2.4m (8 feet), where two light bulbs are turned on 24 hours a day, 
Bersih has said, adding that the cell does not have a window or a bed.

 Under Sosma, she can be detained for 28 days without trial.

 The Malaysian human rights commission on Wednesday said the arrest under 
Sosma was unjustified.

 Several other rights groups have said the use of Sosma for an organiser of a 
peaceful rally is abuse of power and that the Malaysian government is trying to 
suppress dissent by using draconian laws.

 Najib has faced criticism since the Wall Street Journal reported last year 
thataround US$700m from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/06/malaysian-task-force-investigates-allegations-700m-paid-to-pm-najib>
 (1MDB) was diverted into the personal bank account of the prime minister.

 Lawsuits filed by the US justice department in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/us-justice-department-1mdb-fund-seizure-fraud-investigation>
 said over $3.5bn was stolen from 1MDB, which was founded by Najib, and that 
some of those funds flowed into the accounts of “Malaysian Official 1”, whom US 
and Malaysian officials have identified as Najib.

 Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing and has consolidated power by 
sacking critics within his ruling party and cracking down on dissenting 
opposition party leaders, activists and lawyers.
