Famed for Vespas, Fiat 500s and a somewhat erratic driving style, Italy is not 
a land known for a thriving urban cycling culture. While the metropolises of 
northernEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> have invested in 
innovative solutions to get citizens on their bikes, in thebel paese the car 
remains king.


But now Italy’s economic powerhouse, Milan, is seeking to bring back the 
bicicletta by paying people to cycle to work. The move follows the announcement 
in December of a €35m (£27m) government fund for sustainable mobility 
solutions, after Milan and other parts of the country were hit by dangerous 
levels of pollution.

Within the next few weeks local authorities nationwide will begin competing 
for the state cash, with Milan’s councillor for mobility, Pierfrancesco Maran, 
hoping to be first in line. While there is already a movement in Milan to make 
the city cycle-friendly, such as a successful bike sharing scheme, he believes 
more could be done.

“Reimburse those who go to work by bike; a project similar to the one in 
France,” Maran said. Under theFrench system trialled in 2014

, employees were paid 25 cents per kilometre they pedalled to work. A pilot on 
the same principle is currently beingrolled out in Massarosa

, a small Tuscan town where 50 people are said to be taking part.

With the numbers in Milan likely to be considerably higher, Maran’s office has 
suggested using an app to keep track of people cycling to work: “The software 
exists; it’s not 100% flawless but no one’s thinking of giving large sums,” he 
said.

Maran has sought help from Milan’s Polytechnic University to work out the 
practicalities, with the institute’s mobility manager, Eleonora Perotto, 
advising on how to potentially set up the scheme.

In Milan, those who travel to work by bike are almost faster than cars

One idea includes a system to monitor a person’s travelling speed, to check 
whether they are really cycling to work – although Milan’s heavy traffic could 
make this challenging. “In the city, those who travel by bike are almost faster 
than cars,” Perotto said. She is supportive of the scheme as a way to promote 
cycling in Milan, but admits she doesn’t cycle to work herself because of the 
distance and difficulty of the route.

Her sentiment reflects a key flaw in the proposal to pay people to cycle to 
work: that money alone is not enough of an incentive.The French scheme had 
moderate results 
<http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/03/the-problem-with-paying-people-to-bike-to-work/388099/>
, with only a few hundred people reportedly signing on out of more than 8,000 
eligible, while later this year it will become clear how well Italians in 
Massarosa take to the idea.

Ralph Buehler, an associate professor in urban affairs and planning at 
Virginia Tech in the United States, believes a paying scheme has to be 
accompanied by other measures to make cycling a realistic option. He cited US 
research that foundabout 60% of the population are “interested but concerned”

 about cycling.

“If you don’t provide a safe cycling environment, you will only get a very 
small group of people,” Buehler said. “Just paying people alone will not have 
that much of an effect, because you don’t get to that part of the population 
which are ‘enthusiastic but concerned’.”

The availability of bike paths, secure parking and showers are all areas which 
could affect a person’s willingness to cycle to work. The relative ease of 
driving is also a factor, although Buehler warned it is difficult to enforce 
measures against cars before other options are in place.

“Experience shows that you can make it more difficult for people to drive, but 
it’s politically easier if you have other options: good incentives to cycle, 
good public transport, easy to walk.”

Pollution creates an undesirable environment in a city, which doesn’t 
encourage people to spend more time outdoors

Even with all of these options available, people are less likely to cycle to 
the office if they are also incentivised to drive. Holger Haubold, a fiscal and 
economic policy officer at the European Cyclists’ Federation, says a 
counter-productive scheme exists in Belgium whereby people are offered company 
cars alongside a cycle-to-work scheme.

Despite this, Haubold says Belgium’s programme to pay people to cycle to the 
office has been successful. “The fiscal incentive is the most efficient way to 
promote cycling to work. Companies that have this incentive in place have 
significantly more employees cycling to work than those that don’t.” But he 
echoed Buehler’s view that broader bike infrastructure is fundamental to the 
success of the scheme.

In Copenhagen, which already boasts some of the world’s best cycling 
infrastructure, few people cycle as a way to save money on fuel or public 
transport. According to figures from Copenhagenize Design Company, which 
advises governments and organisations on making cities cycle-friendly, only6% 
of people in Copenhagen cycle because it’s inexpensive 
<http://www.copenhagenize.com/2010/05/cycling-isnt-fun-its-transport.html>.

The main reason people pedal their way through the city is because it’s quick 
and easy, 56% of cyclists said, while 19% do so for the exercise. Just 1% of 
people are motivated by environmental concerns; noteworthy in Milan, where 
cycling is seen as a way to tackle the city’s pollution problem.

Mikael Colville-Andersen, Copenhagenize’s chief executive, points out that 
poor air quality puts people off cycling. “Pollution creates an undesirable 
environment in a city, which doesn’t exactly encourage people to spend more 
time outdoors,” he said. “Pay-to-bike schemes are a nice idea, but if the city 
is clogged with toxic emissions, telling people to get out and cycle in it is a 
bit ridiculous.”

Pollution instead serves as a motivational factor for politicians, such as in 
Milan where all traffic was banned for a period in December owing to poor air 
quality. City hall also introduced a reduced €1.50 day ticket for public 
transport.


Ultimately, Buehler says, potential cyclists are more likely to respond to 
individual benefits – such as a cash in their pockets: “Many people are 
idealist and think the environment should be safe, but for many adding this 
direct, selfish benefit is a good strategy.”
