A report published on Tuesday says New York City’s 311 call center has 
received at least 83 complaints about correction officers subjecting visitors 
to strip searches or cavity searches since 2010.

According to the report by WNYC radio. and the online publication the Intercept
 <http://www.wnyc.org/story/stripped-their-dignity/>, the women say correction 
officers at Rikers Island and other city jails have jammed fingers into their 
crotches, fondled their breasts and asked them to “prove” they were 
menstruating by removing their tampons.

The city department of correction denied that correction officers are 
routinely violating visitors’ rights.

Spokesman Peter Thorne said the department “has zero tolerance for the 
mistreatment of visitors”.
