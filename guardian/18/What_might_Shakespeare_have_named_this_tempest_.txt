Socialism is usually an insult in the US. A high-profile politician who 
voluntarily takes on the term deserves some respect. If faith in government to 
correct economic injustice is the key hallmark of socialism, and if Bernie 
Sanders campaigns for that, which he does, then he is entitled to call himself 
a socialist – and to be called one by the media without the derogatory prefix 
“self-declared” (Report

• The allegation of rape against Leon Brittan was abandoned, we are told, 
because it was more “likely to lead to acquittal than conviction” (Leon Brittan 
rape inquiry was justified, Met police review rules 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/07/lord-brittan-investigation-fully-justified-say-police>
, 8 February). The implication is that acquittals are a pointless waste of 
money rather than an act of justice. We are approaching a state of affairs in 
which all of us are presumed guilty until proved innocent.

• Caroline Johnson (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/04/the-loneliness-epidemic-among-britains-elderly>
, 5 February) praises Feock parish council’s initiative to provide transport 
for people on their own. She omits to mention the necessity for drivers to 
undergo Data Barring Service clearance in order to perform this service. I can 
take a friend to hospital without such clearance; if a body such as my church 
asks me to do it, I need clearance. This strand of bureaucracy deters many 
willing people from volunteering for such services.

• Can’t be the same Jack Straw who led a demonstration at Leeds University as 
a student claiming they kept secret files and demanding to see them, can it (
