It seems that everyone from Prince Charles

 toPaul Krugman 
<http://www.politicususa.com/2016/12/19/paul-krugman-warns-the-1930s-show-has-returned-with-trumps-security-force.html>
 toLord Ashdown <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbtdnvGprKc> is drawing 
parallels between today’s tumultuous political and social events and the 1930s 
– bookended, as they were, by the Great Depression and the second world war.

We’d like to know what Guardian readers recall of the 1930s – either directly 
or via stories that have been passed down from older family members. They could 
be tales of thehunger marches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/23/council-for-civil-liberties-letter-kidd>
 and protests such as Jarrow, as reportedhere by the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/century/1930-1939/Story/0,6051,127027,00.html> in 
1936, or stories about the impact of theGreat Depression 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/12/us-unemployment-lessons-from-great-depression>
 in the US and around the world.


We’d also be fascinated to hear your accounts of what life was like during the 
political turmoil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/1938/oct/01/secondworldwar.fromthearchive> 
that led to thestart of the second world war 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/1939/sep/04/germany.secondworldwar>. Perhaps 
you have had stories handed down about theSpanish civil war 
<https://www.theguardian.com/galleryguide/0,6191,395635,00.html>, or Britain’s 
abdication crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1936/dec/11/queenmother.monarchy>? We’d also 
like to hear accounts of everyday life, be they stories about work, home or 
recreation, and from anywhere in the world.

Please share your stories, memories and family photographs of the 1930s,
