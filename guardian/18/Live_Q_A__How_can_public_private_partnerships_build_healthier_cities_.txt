As our planet faces increasing urbanisation, public health experts are 
spearheading innovation for adjusting to this.


We know that cities can make us ill: according to figures from the 
International Diabetes Federation <http://www.idf.org/>, in 2014 there were 387 
million people globally suffering from diabetes andin 2015 there were 415 
million people living with the disease 
<http://www.diabetesatlas.org/across-the-globe.html>. Two-thirds of those 
people live in cities, experiencing poor diet and sedentary lifestyles.


And our mental health suffers in cities, too. Urban living has been found to 
raise the risk of anxiety and mood disorders by 21% and 39% respectively 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/feb/25/city-stress-mental-health-rural-kind>
.

While half the world population currently lives in a city, this is predicted 
to rise to two-thirds by 2050. As they grow, cities will play a crucial role in 
finding solutions to many of our greatest public health challenges, from 
obesity and diabetes to communicable diseases like tuberculosis.

With public health systems overstretched, and local governments pressed on all 
sides for resources and money, innovative solutions are needed. Public-private 
partnerships (PPPs) could be a source of new thinking, getting projects off the 
ground.

So how can cities best build on PPPs to create health systems and fresh 
thinking so that our urban world will be a healthy one? How can public health 
bodies capitalise on the skills of the private sector without losing control? 
How can cities ensure equal access to healthcare for all residents? And what 
role should city mayors and other local government figures play in establishing 
innovative partnerships for health?

Join an expert panel on Thursday 8 December, from 2pm to 3.30pm GMT, to 
discuss these questions and more.
