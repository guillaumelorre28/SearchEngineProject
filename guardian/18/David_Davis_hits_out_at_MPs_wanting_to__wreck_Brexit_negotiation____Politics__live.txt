Early evening summary

 * Greg Clarke, the business secretary, has told MPs that workers’ rights will 
be protected when the UK leaves the EU.Speaking tonight in the first of a 
series of general Brexit debates the government is holding, he said: 
No one listening to this debate should think that we have any intention of 
eroding the rights that we enjoy in this country through our process of leaving 
theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, because in fact the 
opposite is true. We will be using the legislation before this House to 
entrench all existing workers’ rights in British law, whatever the future 
relationship that the UK has with the EU.

He said that when the government passed its great repeal bill, incorporating 
EU laws into UK domestic legislation, all workers’ rights in EU law would be 
carried over. And he denied claims that the government might include a sunset 
clause, time-limiting these protections. “There is no intention to have a 
sunset clause,” he said.

 * David Davis has confirmed that the government may have to wait until 
January for a supreme court ruling on whether it can press ahead with the 
formal process of exiting the EU without a parliamentary vote.

 * Theresa May has come under pressure from business leaders to open Britain’s 
doors to more skilled Indian workers and students to boost the economy and help 
secure a post-Brexit trade deal. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/theresa-may-visa-offer-india-citizens-uk>
 * Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has urged the UK government to 
further slow the pace of deficit reduction in the forthcoming autumn statement.
In a lecture at Sheffield University she suggested austerity and lack of hope 
helped to explain why people voted for Brexit. She said: 
UK economic policy, arguably over several decades but particularly in recent 
years, has not given enough people enough grounds for hope. The current 
government has already abandoned the deficit reduction targets it was elected 
on in 2015 - just as the previous government abandoned, in 2012, the deficit 
reduction targets it set itself in 2010. There’s a good reason for that. The 
severity of government cuts has permanently reduced the productive capacity of 
the economy. As a result, cuts hindered, rather than helped, attempts to reduce 
government debt.

Austerity is a policy which has failed, categorically and comprehensively, on 
its own terms. It has also imposed needless hardship on individuals and 
families across the UK. Austerity hasn’t just harmed our economy; it has 
damaged our society.

 * Fewer than one in four eligible married couples have applied for an 
allowance that could reduce their tax bill by up to £220 a year, HMRC figures 
show. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/marriage-tax-break-taken-up-by-fewer-than-one-in-four-eligible-couples>
 * Austerity policies introduced into welfare and social care by the UK 
government amount to “systematic violations” of the rights of people with 
disabilities, a UN inquiry has concluded. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/uk-austerity-policies-amount-to-violations-of-disabled-peoples-rights>
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

MPs debate Brexit and workers' rights

MPs are now debating Brexit and workers’ rights. This is the first of several 
debates the government is holding on Brexit. But it is just a general debate, 
and there will not be a vote at the end, and so the debate itself will count 
for little.

Greg Clark, the business secretary, opened the debate. In his opening remarks 
he said the government would protect workers’ rights when it repatriated 
employment legislation to the UK.

David Davis's statement on article 50 court ruling - Summary

Here are the main points from David Davis’s statement on the article 50 court 
ruling.

 * Davis accused MPs demanding parliamentary control of the article 50 process 
of wanting to “wreck the [Brexit] negotiation”.(See 4.33pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/07/labour-wants-brexit-plan-but-will-not-block-artice-50-outright-starmer-says-politics-live?page=with:block-5820ac02e4b029b92ca46562#block-5820ac02e4b029b92ca46562>
 * He said the government might have to wait until January for the result of 
the supreme court appeal.When Labour’s Angela Smith said it might take this 
long, he replied: 
Yes, she is right in one respect, that it may come as late as early January. 
The expectation is that the case will be heard in the early part of December, 
and it will take two or three weeks I expect to get the judgment written up. 
But I think it is the proper role of government to wait and respect the 
judgment we get from the supreme court, full stop.

 * Davis rejected calls from several MPs for the government to hold a vote on 
triggering article 50 before the supreme court judgment. It was right to wait 
until the supreme court issued its decision, he said. But he told the 
ConservativeNicky Morgan that, although he could not agree to her proposal for 
an early vote on a one-line article 50 bill, he was “very tempted” by the idea. 
And whenPeter Bone, a Conservative, said the government should just hold a vote 
on a resolution backing triggering article 50, Davis said that the government 
was not proposing that, but that the Commons itself could decide to have a 
vote. He also suggested the government wanted to clarify the law on prerogative 
powers generally, not least because they cover decisions like going to war. 
 * He said that, although the high court ruling implied that the government 
had to pass primary legislation to be allowed to trigger article 50, the 
supreme court ruling could say something different. He was responding to 
questions about whether parliament would have to pass a bill to allow the 
government to trigger article 50, or whether just passing a resolution (a 
quicker, easier process) would be enough if the government loses its appeal to 
the supreme court. 
 * He defended the independence of the judiciary, although he refused to 
condemn those newspapers that attacked the high court judges for their article 
50 ruling.He said: 
There are a number of pillars of our democracy, one of them is the 
independence of the judiciary which we have maintained for centuries, and one 
of the others is the freedom of the press which we are still maintaining after 
centuries.

 * He said some of the online trolls who have attacked Gina Miller, the woman 
who brought the article 50 case, should be prosecuted. He said: 
Let me comment on the issue of Gina Miller. I’ve said with respect to that 
that I deplored - I can’t find words strong enough frankly to say how much I 
detest the attacks on her.

And frankly from what I’ve heard about them - I haven’t seen them myself 
directly but from what I’ve heard about them - they sound to me to be 
effectively criminal attacks, because incitement of violence, threats of 
violence, racial abuse, are all crimes.

 * He refused to endorse communities secretary Sajid Javid’s claim that the 
high court ruling was an “attempt to frustrate the will of the British people”. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37866411> 
 * He suggested that the proposed march on the supreme court, to be led by 
Nigel Farage, would be pointless. He said: 
The right to demonstrate is another of our freedoms but I’d say this - one of 
the great things about our supreme court, indeed all our courts, is it wouldn’t 
matter how many people march, it wouldn’t move their judgments by one comma.

And that’s what we should be proud of.

 * He said the government would announce in due course whether it intended to 
remain in the customs union. 
The issue of a customs union is a complex one, there are many different 
configurations - there is Turkey inside the customs union, but outside the 
single market, there is Norway inside the single market outside the customs 
union, and Switzerland outside the customs union and partially in the single 
market.

We have to make a judgment on what is best for Britain in total, both in terms 
of its access to the European market and to the rest of the world. And we will 
make that judgment in due course and we’ll make it public in due course.

May says she still expects to trigger article 50 before end of March

Speaking to the BBC in India, Theresa May has also said that she still expects 
to be able to trigger article 50 before the end of March. She said:

I’m clear that I expect to be able to trigger article 50 by the end of March 
next year. That’s what I’ve said consistently and I continue to work on that 
basis. We believe the government has got strong legal arguments. We’ll be 
putting those arguments to the supreme court and the supreme court will make 
its judgment.

Richard Tice, co-chair of the Leave Means Leave campaign (a successor to 
Leave.EU), has welcomed David Davis’s statement. He said:

We welcome the statement made by the Secretary of State reaffirming the 
government’s commitment to Brexit and their pledge to deliver on it.

Remain campaigners should make no mistake – the ruling by the high court will 
not sabotage Brexit. It is a game being played by pro-EU campaigners who are 
damaging national confidence and our national economic interest. They should 
stop playing games and get behind the opportunities Brexit offers.

As David Davis <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis> confirmed, 
the timetable is still on track.

Whether the supreme court overrules the high court judgment or it comes down 
to a parliamentary vote, it is crucial that article 50 is triggered as soon as 
possible to ensure that confidence in the UK economy is maintained.

Speaking in India, Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has reaffirmed her opposition 
to holding an early general election. But she would not rule one out, and she 
repeatedly said the general electionshould be in 2020, not that it would be 
then. Asked to rule out an election any time before 2020, she replied:

I’ve been clear on this right from before I became prime minister, that the 
next general election should be in 2020. We should get on with the job ... I 
think what most people want is for government to get on with the job and put in 
place what’s necessary. It’s going to take time. there will be negotiations, 
we’re getting on with it and we will be leaving the EU.


Later she added: “I don’t think I could have been clearer about an election in 
2020.”

The SNP’s Alan Brown asks Davis why he no longer supports the case he made as 
a backbencher when he proposed a bill calling for parliamentary control of the 
executive.

Several references to @DavidDavisMP <https://twitter.com/DavidDavisMP> 1999 
parliamentary control of the executive bill - here it ishttps://t.co/31ECQ16IYc

Other SNPs have raised this too.

John Bercow, the Speaker, says Davis does not have to reply because this does

Richard Drax, a Conservative, asks if the government is worried about the 
courts stopping ministers using prerogative powers to go to war.

Davis says that that is one of the reasons why the government is so keen to 
get a definitive ruling from the supreme court.

Labour’s Luciana Berger quotes from a constituent who said he voted to leave 
the EU, but did not vote to suspend the rule of law. So why won’t the 
government accept the high court judgment?

Davis says the government has a right to appeal against the court’s decision. 
He does not see how you can accuse the government of suspending the rule of law.

Davis says marching against the supreme court will not change its decision ‘by 
one comma’

Labour’s Owen Smith says Davis has seven times refused to condemn the comment 
from Sajid Javid last week attacking the high court. So will Davis condemn the 
plan to march against the supreme court.

Davis says the right to protest is an important one. But one of the good 
things about our judiciary is that, however many people march, it will not 
affect the supreme court’s ruling “by one comma”.

 * Davis says marching against the supreme court will not change its decision 
‘by one comma’.

 * Greg Clarke, the business secretary, has told MPs that workers’ rights will 
be protected when the UK leaves the EU.Speaking tonight in the first of a 
series of general Brexit debates the government is holding, he said: 
No one listening to this debate should think that we have any intention of 
eroding the rights that we enjoy in this country through our process of leaving 
theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, because in fact the 
opposite is true. We will be using the legislation before this House to 
entrench all existing workers’ rights in British law, whatever the future 
relationship that the UK has with the EU.

He said that when the government passed its great repeal bill, incorporating 
EU laws into UK domestic legislation, all workers’ rights in EU law would be 
carried over. And he denied claims that the government might include a sunset 
clause, time-limiting these protections. “There is no intention to have a 
sunset clause,” he said.

 * David Davis has confirmed that the government may have to wait until 
January for a supreme court ruling on whether it can press ahead with the 
formal process of exiting the EU without a parliamentary vote.

 * Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has urged the UK government to 
further slow the pace of deficit reduction in the forthcoming autumn statement.
In a lecture at Sheffield University she suggested austerity and lack of hope 
helped to explain why people voted for Brexit. She said: 
UK economic policy, arguably over several decades but particularly in recent 
years, has not given enough people enough grounds for hope. The current 
government has already abandoned the deficit reduction targets it was elected 
on in 2015 - just as the previous government abandoned, in 2012, the deficit 
reduction targets it set itself in 2010. There’s a good reason for that. The 
severity of government cuts has permanently reduced the productive capacity of 
the economy. As a result, cuts hindered, rather than helped, attempts to reduce 
government debt.

Austerity is a policy which has failed, categorically and comprehensively, on 
its own terms. It has also imposed needless hardship on individuals and 
families across the UK. Austerity hasn’t just harmed our economy; it has 
damaged our society.

That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Clark says the Conservative party is the true workers’ party, dedicated to 
protecting workers’ rights.
 
Clark says the government recognises it has more to do to tackle the gender 
pay gap.
 
Clark says the government will not water down the TUPE rules - Transfer of 
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, which ensure that workers 
do not lose rights if their jobs are privatised, or transferred to another 
employer.
 
MPs are now debating Brexit and workers’ rights. This is the first of several 
debates the government is holding on Brexit. But it is just a general debate, 
and there will not be a vote at the end, and so the debate itself will count 
for little.

Greg Clark, the business secretary, opened the debate. In his opening remarks 
he said the government would protect workers’ rights when it repatriated 
employment legislation to the UK.

Here are the main points from David Davis’s statement on the article 50 court 
ruling.

 * Davis accused MPs demanding parliamentary control of the article 50 process 
of wanting to “wreck the [Brexit] negotiation”.(See 4.33pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/07/labour-wants-brexit-plan-but-will-not-block-artice-50-outright-starmer-says-politics-live?page=with:block-5820ac02e4b029b92ca46562#block-5820ac02e4b029b92ca46562>
 * He said the government might have to wait until January for the result of 
the supreme court appeal.When Labour’s Angela Smith said it might take this 
long, he replied: 
Yes, she is right in one respect, that it may come as late as early January. 
The expectation is that the case will be heard in the early part of December, 
and it will take two or three weeks I expect to get the judgment written up. 
But I think it is the proper role of government to wait and respect the 
judgment we get from the supreme court, full stop.

 * Davis rejected calls from several MPs for the government to hold a vote on 
triggering article 50 before the supreme court judgment. It was right to wait 
until the supreme court issued its decision, he said. But he told the 
ConservativeNicky Morgan that, although he could not agree to her proposal for 
an early vote on a one-line article 50 bill, he was “very tempted” by the idea. 
And whenPeter Bone, a Conservative, said the government should just hold a vote 
on a resolution backing triggering article 50, Davis said that the government 
was not proposing that, but that the Commons itself could decide to have a 
vote. He also suggested the government wanted to clarify the law on prerogative 
powers generally, not least because they cover decisions like going to war. 
 * He said that, although the high court ruling implied that the government 
had to pass primary legislation to be allowed to trigger article 50, the 
supreme court ruling could say something different. He was responding to 
questions about whether parliament would have to pass a bill to allow the 
government to trigger article 50, or whether just passing a resolution (a 
quicker, easier process) would be enough if the government loses its appeal to 
the supreme court. 
 * He defended the independence of the judiciary, although he refused to 
condemn those newspapers that attacked the high court judges for their article 
50 ruling.He said: 
There are a number of pillars of our democracy, one of them is the 
independence of the judiciary which we have maintained for centuries, and one 
of the others is the freedom of the press which we are still maintaining after 
centuries.

 * He said some of the online trolls who have attacked Gina Miller, the woman 
who brought the article 50 case, should be prosecuted. He said: 
Let me comment on the issue of Gina Miller. I’ve said with respect to that 
that I deplored - I can’t find words strong enough frankly to say how much I 
detest the attacks on her.

And frankly from what I’ve heard about them - I haven’t seen them myself 
directly but from what I’ve heard about them - they sound to me to be 
effectively criminal attacks, because incitement of violence, threats of 
violence, racial abuse, are all crimes.

 * He refused to endorse communities secretary Sajid Javid’s claim that the 
high court ruling was an “attempt to frustrate the will of the British people”. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37866411> 
 * He suggested that the proposed march on the supreme court, to be led by 
Nigel Farage, would be pointless. He said: 
The right to demonstrate is another of our freedoms but I’d say this - one of 
the great things about our supreme court, indeed all our courts, is it wouldn’t 
matter how many people march, it wouldn’t move their judgments by one comma.

And that’s what we should be proud of.

 * He said the government would announce in due course whether it intended to 
remain in the customs union. 
The issue of a customs union is a complex one, there are many different 
configurations - there is Turkey inside the customs union, but outside the 
single market, there is Norway inside the single market outside the customs 
union, and Switzerland outside the customs union and partially in the single 
market.

We have to make a judgment on what is best for Britain in total, both in terms 
of its access to the European market and to the rest of the world. And we will 
make that judgment in due course and we’ll make it public in due course.
 
Speaking to the BBC in India, Theresa May has also said that she still expects 
to be able to trigger article 50 before the end of March. She said:

I’m clear that I expect to be able to trigger article 50 by the end of March 
next year. That’s what I’ve said consistently and I continue to work on that 
basis. We believe the government has got strong legal arguments. We’ll be 
putting those arguments to the supreme court and the supreme court will make 
its judgment.
 
Richard Tice, co-chair of the Leave Means Leave campaign (a successor to 
Leave.EU), has welcomed David Davis’s statement. He said:

We welcome the statement made by the Secretary of State reaffirming the 
government’s commitment to Brexit and their pledge to deliver on it.

Remain campaigners should make no mistake – the ruling by the high court will 
not sabotage Brexit. It is a game being played by pro-EU campaigners who are 
damaging national confidence and our national economic interest. They should 
stop playing games and get behind the opportunities Brexit offers.

As David Davis <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis> confirmed, 
the timetable is still on track.

Whether the supreme court overrules the high court judgment or it comes down 
to a parliamentary vote, it is crucial that article 50 is triggered as soon as 
possible to ensure that confidence in the UK economy is maintained.



 
Speaking in India, Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has reaffirmed her opposition 
to holding an early general election. But she would not rule one out, and she 
repeatedly said the general electionshould be in 2020, not that it would be 
then. Asked to rule out an election any time before 2020, she replied:

I’ve been clear on this right from before I became prime minister, that the 
next general election should be in 2020. We should get on with the job ... I 
think what most people want is for government to get on with the job and put in 
place what’s necessary. It’s going to take time. there will be negotiations, 
we’re getting on with it and we will be leaving the EU.


Later she added: “I don’t think I could have been clearer about an election in 
2020.”
 
The Davis statement is finally over. I will post a summary of the key points 
shortly.
 
The SNP’s Alan Brown asks Davis why he no longer supports the case he made as 
a backbencher when he proposed a bill calling for parliamentary control of the 
executive.
PARLY (@ParlyApp) 
Several references to @DavidDavisMP <https://twitter.com/DavidDavisMP> 1999 
parliamentary control of the executive bill - here it ishttps://t.co/31ECQ16IYc

<https://twitter.com/ParlyApp/status/795672110635094016> 
Other SNPs have raised this too.

John Bercow, the Speaker, says Davis does not have to reply because this does 
not relate to his ministerial responsibilities now.
 
Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative MP, says that although Labour MPs are now 
demanding a vote on triggering article 50,they voted against a 10-minute rule 
bill he proposed himself in September saying article 50 should be triggered. 
<http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/710648/MPs-vote-against-Brexit-Charlie-Elphicke-Labour-SNP-EU-referendum-House-of-Commons>
 
The SNP’s Martin Docherty-Hughes asks Davis for an assurance that there will 
be no change to the rights of Irish people in the UK from Brexit.

Davis says that he thinks their rights will not change at all, but he says he 
will right to Docherty-Hughes with a firm answer.
 
Richard Drax, a Conservative, asks if the government is worried about the 
courts stopping ministers using prerogative powers to go to war.

Davis says that that is one of the reasons why the government is so keen to 
get a definitive ruling from the supreme court.
 
In an earlier post I wrongly described Mike Gapes as a Conservative. I’m 
sorry; that was just an extended typo. He is, of course, aLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP.
 
Labour’s Luciana Berger quotes from a constituent who said he voted to leave 
the EU, but did not vote to suspend the rule of law. So why won’t the 
government accept the high court judgment?

Davis says the government has a right to appeal against the court’s decision. 
He does not see how you can accuse the government of suspending the rule of law.
 
Labour’s Owen Smith says Davis has seven times refused to condemn the comment 
from Sajid Javid last week attacking the high court. So will Davis condemn the 
plan to march against the supreme court.

Davis says the right to protest is an important one. But one of the good 
things about our judiciary is that, however many people march, it will not 
affect the supreme court’s ruling “by one comma”.

 * Davis says marching against the supreme court will not change its decision 
‘by one comma’.
