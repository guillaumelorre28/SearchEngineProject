Congratulations to my friend and colleague Giles Fraser for welcoming the man 
who broke into his church, lit all the candles and stayed to pray (Loose canon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2017/jan/05/a-man-recently-broke-into-my-church-good-on-him-i-say>
, 6 January). It might have been better still had the church never been locked. 
When I was vicar of a Wren period church on the Greenwich-Lewisham border, the 
church council decided never to lock the glass-plated door fronting on to the 
street. We believed that a church may be needed just as much by night as by 
day. It was on the path of a good many tramps crossing Blackheath on the way to 
London. The sanctuary was lit. It cost us only the electricity.

Some came just to sit. Some to pray. A few to sleep. They caused no trouble. 
Albert stayed, on and off, for years and was a self-appointed guardian. A cup 
of tea was on offer from the vicarage opposite.

Theft? Only once. A processional cross disappeared. The traders would not 
touch it. It was found at low tide in the Thames. The police brought it back. 
The culprit was awe-struck when he saw it back in its place. A miracle? Early 
on, the police had stopped by: “Vicar, you’ve forgotten to lock up.” They 
quickly learned. No surprise, it didn’t catch on. It was not a universal 
solution but it worked well through the 1970s. Dartmouth Row was not the 
Elephant & Castle. However, on many a morning we could say “Jesus slept here 
last night”.
