Storm Eva 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/25/christmas-day-flood-warnings-prompt-meeting-of-emergency-cobra-committee>
 in the north of England and in Scotland caused a raft of postponements.

The Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> fixture

Carlisle’s trip to Accrington on Boxing Day is also off, just days after the 
Accrington manager John Coleman criticised the Football League for allowing 
Carlisle to play three home games at other venues after their Brunton Park 
ground was flooded.

In League One <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball>, 
Blackpool v Oldham, Wigan v Sheffield United, Bradford v Burton, Rochdale v 
Crewe and Bury v Barnsley have all fallen victim to the weather, with 
inspections planned at a number of other grounds.

In League Two <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball>, the 
matches at Hartlepool, York and Morecambe are off in addition to the game at 
the Crown Ground, while National League games at Guiseley, Barrow and 
Altrincham are postponed, also due to waterlogged pitches.

In Scotland, the Premiership match between Dundee United and Motherwell at 
Tannadice is off, as well as Partick v St Johnstone and lower-league matches at 
Raith Rovers and Cowdenbeath.
