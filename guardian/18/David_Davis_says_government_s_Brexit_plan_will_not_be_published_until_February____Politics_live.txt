David Davis's evidence to the Brexit committee - Summary

Here are the key points from David Davis’s evidence to the Brexit committee.

 * Davis, the Brexit secretary, said the government would not publish the 
Brexit plan it promised last week until February at the earliest. Asked when it 
would come, he said: 
It won’t be next month. The policy work is still underway; there are quite a 
few decisions still to be made.

We’ve carried out or are in the midst of carrying out about 57, I think, 
sectoral analyses, each of which has implications for individual parts of 85% 
of the economy, and some of those are still to be concluded; we have work still 
to be done on justice and home affairs, so there is a fair number of things 
still to do. So it will be as soon as we’re ready.

 * He said that he would back a transitional deal, provided it was about 
“implementation”. Davis and others have said Brexit could involve two forms of 
transitional deal: an implementation deal, that would bridge the gap between 
the end of the two-year Brexit talks and the start of a final new trade 
arrangement; or a transition period to extend the exit talks following the 
failure to agree a final deal in two years. Davis said he could see the case 
for the first sort of deal. 
Whatever the transitional arrangement is, we need to know where we’re going 
before we decide on the transition. If you build a bridge, you need to have 
both sides established before you build the bridge. So we need to know where 
we’re going; it seems to me perfectly possible to know what the end game will 
be within two years.

When pressed on whether he would agree to a transitional deal, he said: “An 
implementation phase? If it is necessary and only if it is necessary.”

On Monday, in evidence to the Commons Treasury committee, Philip Hammond, the 
chancellor, said there should be a transitional deal. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ee2d6e4b025760cee4211#block-584ee2d6e4b025760cee4211>
 But, unlike Davis, Hammond hinted that he would favour a transitional deal 
even if it were only a ‘creating extra time’ one.

 * Davis raised the possibility of article 50 (the process that starts the 
two-year withdrawal process) being revoked.He stressed that he did not see this 
as at all likely, but he did not say it was impossible. He said: 
It is very, very difficult to see [article 50] being revoked. We don’t intend 
to revoke it, and it may not be revocable, I don’t know.

This is significant because until now the government has insisted that article 
50 cannot be revoked, even though many experts,including the person who drafted 
it <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37852628>, say it 
could be revoked if EU leaders decided that is what they wanted. The situation 
is ambiguous because article 50 was never expected to be used, and so it is 
silent on the subject of whether or not it can be reversed.

 * Davis said he thought it was possible to conclude the entire Brexit talks, 
covering withdrawal and a new trade relationship, within a year and a half. 
(Officially two years is available, but in practice the commission has said the 
talks will have to be concluded within 18 months, to allow time for 
ratification.) He said the public wanted this done quickly. 
The British people want this done with some degree of expedition, they want it 
done properly and soon and that is what we are trying to do.

Michel Barnier, the European commission’s Brexit negotiator, has said that he 
thinks the UK has to negotiate EU withdrawal before it negotiates its new trade 
arrangement with the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/06/uk-wants-as-much-flexibility-as-possible-in-brexit-negotiating-position-says-hammond-politics-live?page=with:block-5846a144e4b049350cc96739#block-5846a144e4b049350cc96739>
, not in parallel as Davis wants.

 * Davis suggested that details of Britain’s new immigration rules might not 
be decided until after Brexit.The talks would just focus on ensuring Britain 
gets control of immigration, he said. How immigration rules would then work 
would not be part of the negotiation, he suggested. 
 * He refused to say whether the government’s Brexit “plan”, when published, 
would take the form of a white paper. And he refused to say how long it would 
be, or whether it was more likely to cover just two pages, or run to about 40. 
He said he had to decide on the content first. He would only publish 
information that would not undermine the government’s negotiating position. 
 * He refused to commit the government to giving MPs a vote on the Brexit plan.
 * He said the government was determined to keep the border between Northern 
Ireland and Ireland open and that Norway/Sweden might provide a model for how 
this could be done. 
There is an example of how that might be done that the committee might look 
at, the Norway/Sweden border. They are both in the single market but they 
straddle the customs union. And it’s a very open border, with particular 
arrangements designed to make the border a free border.

Davis said he was optimistic that the EU would be helpful on this point. 
Barnier raised it with him when they met, he said. He also dismissed the idea 
that not having border controls at the Northern Ireland/Ireland border could 
allow people to evade UK border controls.

There are 50m people land at British airports every year. It is a very 
long-winded way to get into the UK to come via Dublin.

Instead, he hinted that a solution might involve the Irish beefing up their 
own security.

I also went to Dublin. They were equally keen to maintain this, and we may 
well have discussions with them at some point about their own incoming 
security, so that we’ve got some watchlist-type thing there. But that’s for 
them to decide, not me.

 * He said the government was looking at four possible options for the UK’s 
relationship with the customs union.They were: being fully in; fully out; a 
partially inside Turkish model of being inside the customs union but outside 
the single market; and a Swiss model of being outside the customs union but 
with customs arrangements. 
 * He confirmed that, if Britain had a trade deal with the EU, it would have 
to follow the decisions of an external arbitration body. Hilary Benn, the 
committee chairman, suggested this undermined leave claims that leaving was 
about taking back control. But Davis said a trade arbitration body would only 
cover trade, unlike the European court of justice. 
 * He said that in future he might brief the Brexit committee in private on 
the government’s plans. 
 * He said that he expected his department to be wound up within two and a 
half years. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Hilary Benn is wrapping up.

Q: Will the great repeal bill be published in draft?

Davis says he cannot give that assurance, but he will write to Benn about that.

Q: Can you commit to giving parliament a vote on the final Brexit deal?

Davis says the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act covers this, and that 
the government will obey the law to the letter.

And that’s it. The hearing is over.

I’ll post a summary soon.

Labour’s Seema Malhotra goes next.

Davis says ministers in his department have seen 130 companies to discuss 
Brexit since the summer. In other departments ministers have seen companies too.

He is trying to work out what the problems are in each area. He asks people to 
quantify the problems, and to propose solutions.

Q: Could the government cut corporation tax or regulations to make the UK a 
more attractive location, if the European commission tries to punish us?

Davis says Gove makes a good point, but that he is not a natural mercantilist.

Labour’s Pat McFadden goes next.

Q: Is the government still committed to getting net migration below 100,000?

Davis says the prime minister and the home secretary have said this is still 
the goal. But they have stressed this will take time.

Q: Is is reasonable for people to expect this target to be met?

Davis said it is reasonable to expect this to happen “but over time”.

Here is the start of the Press Association story about the hearing.

Brexit Secretary David Davis <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis> 
has said he is ready to accept a transitional arrangement to implement the 
terms of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU “if it’s necessary and only if it’s 
necessary”.

And he indicated that the government is working on four possible outcomes from 
the Brexit talks in relation to the European Customs Union.

These range from being fully or partially inside the Union to having a free 
trade agreement and customs arrangement with the remaining EU to being 
“completely outside”.

Chancellor Philip Hammond said earlier this week that businesses, regulators 
and “thoughtful” politicians on both sides of the Channel recognised that a 
transition deal would be “generally helpful” to avoid the shock of a sudden 
cliff-edge switch to new arrangements post-Brexit.

But Davis told MPs on the Commons Exiting the EU committee that voters wanted 
Brexit delivered “properly and soon”.

“A transitional arrangement means many things to different people,” said Davis.

“An implementation phase? If it is necessary and only if it is necessary. 

“But the British people want this done with some degree of expedition, they 
want it done properly and soon and that is what we are trying to do.”

Joking that “I hope you can classify me as a thoughtful politician”, the 
Brexit secretary said he believed Hammond’s comment related to politicians in 
other EU states.

On the spectrum of possible outcomes being considered by the government, he 
said: “The four I have in mind are inside the Customs Union; a ‘partially 
inside’ Turkish model; outside with a free trade agreement and a customs 
arrangement; and completely outside.”

Davis revealed that the Government’s plan for Brexit will not be published 
before February.

MPs voted last week for the plan to be made public before the triggering of 
two-year withdrawal talks under article 50 of the EU treaties, which prime 
ministerTheresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has said 
she will evoke by the end of March.

Asked when MPs and voters can expect to see the plan, Davis said: “As soon as 
we can, once all of the research and policy is completed.

“It won’t be next month. The policy work is still under way, there are quite a 
few decisions still to be made.”

And he made clear that - while he wanted to be “as open as we can” in 
revealing the government’s intentions - May will continue to hold some of the 
UK’s cards close to her chest.

“We have got to be careful about what we do publish,” said Davis. 

“I want to be as open as we can be, but we must be sure we are not undermining 
our own position.”

The Conservative Alistair Burt goes next.

Q: You talked about a closed session with the committee earlier. So will you 
come back to brief us in a closed session?

Possibly, says Davis.

He says sometimes in these negotiations information is sensitive, and needs to 
be kept private, for a few days.

Q: Is it helpful to you for MPs to tweak the tail of the EU by writing 
letters. (That is a reference tothis letter from Tory MPs.) 
<http://news.sky.com/story/britons-in-eu-must-have-rights-protected-mps-tell-donald-tusk-10675183>

Davis says he is far too much of a pro to answer a question like this.

(In other words, he won’t be drawn into slagging off his colleagues.)

Hilary Benn goes next.

Q: Would a trade deal involve the UK having to accept the verdict of an 
arbitration body?

Yes, says Davis.

Q: So what is the difference between being subject to that, and being subject 
to the European court of justice?

Davis says one just affects trade, while the ECJ has an impact on what happens 
in the UK.

 * Davis says after Brexit UK may still be bound by the decisions of an 
international arbitration body. Facebook

Here are the key points from David Davis’s evidence to the Brexit committee.

 * Davis, the Brexit secretary, said the government would not publish the 
Brexit plan it promised last week until February at the earliest. Asked when it 
would come, he said: 
It won’t be next month. The policy work is still underway; there are quite a 
few decisions still to be made.

We’ve carried out or are in the midst of carrying out about 57, I think, 
sectoral analyses, each of which has implications for individual parts of 85% 
of the economy, and some of those are still to be concluded; we have work still 
to be done on justice and home affairs, so there is a fair number of things 
still to do. So it will be as soon as we’re ready.

 * He said that he would back a transitional deal, provided it was about 
“implementation”. Davis and others have said Brexit could involve two forms of 
transitional deal: an implementation deal, that would bridge the gap between 
the end of the two-year Brexit talks and the start of a final new trade 
arrangement; or a transition period to extend the exit talks following the 
failure to agree a final deal in two years. Davis said he could see the case 
for the first sort of deal. 
Whatever the transitional arrangement is, we need to know where we’re going 
before we decide on the transition. If you build a bridge, you need to have 
both sides established before you build the bridge. So we need to know where 
we’re going; it seems to me perfectly possible to know what the end game will 
be within two years.

When pressed on whether he would agree to a transitional deal, he said: “An 
implementation phase? If it is necessary and only if it is necessary.”

On Monday, in evidence to the Commons Treasury committee, Philip Hammond, the 
chancellor, said there should be a transitional deal. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ee2d6e4b025760cee4211#block-584ee2d6e4b025760cee4211>
 But, unlike Davis, Hammond hinted that he would favour a transitional deal 
even if it were only a ‘creating extra time’ one.

 * Davis raised the possibility of article 50 (the process that starts the 
two-year withdrawal process) being revoked.He stressed that he did not see this 
as at all likely, but he did not say it was impossible. He said: 
It is very, very difficult to see [article 50] being revoked. We don’t intend 
to revoke it, and it may not be revocable, I don’t know.

This is significant because until now the government has insisted that article 
50 cannot be revoked, even though many experts,including the person who drafted 
it <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37852628>, say it 
could be revoked if EU leaders decided that is what they wanted. The situation 
is ambiguous because article 50 was never expected to be used, and so it is 
silent on the subject of whether or not it can be reversed.

 * Davis said he thought it was possible to conclude the entire Brexit talks, 
covering withdrawal and a new trade relationship, within a year and a half. 
(Officially two years is available, but in practice the commission has said the 
talks will have to be concluded within 18 months, to allow time for 
ratification.) He said the public wanted this done quickly. 
The British people want this done with some degree of expedition, they want it 
done properly and soon and that is what we are trying to do.

Michel Barnier, the European commission’s Brexit negotiator, has said that he 
thinks the UK has to negotiate EU withdrawal before it negotiates its new trade 
arrangement with the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/06/uk-wants-as-much-flexibility-as-possible-in-brexit-negotiating-position-says-hammond-politics-live?page=with:block-5846a144e4b049350cc96739#block-5846a144e4b049350cc96739>
, not in parallel as Davis wants.

 * Davis suggested that details of Britain’s new immigration rules might not 
be decided until after Brexit.The talks would just focus on ensuring Britain 
gets control of immigration, he said. How immigration rules would then work 
would not be part of the negotiation, he suggested. 
 * He refused to say whether the government’s Brexit “plan”, when published, 
would take the form of a white paper. And he refused to say how long it would 
be, or whether it was more likely to cover just two pages, or run to about 40. 
He said he had to decide on the content first. He would only publish 
information that would not undermine the government’s negotiating position. 
 * He refused to commit the government to giving MPs a vote on the Brexit plan.
 * He said the government was determined to keep the border between Northern 
Ireland and Ireland open and that Norway/Sweden might provide a model for how 
this could be done. 
There is an example of how that might be done that the committee might look 
at, the Norway/Sweden border. They are both in the single market but they 
straddle the customs union. And it’s a very open border, with particular 
arrangements designed to make the border a free border.

Davis said he was optimistic that the EU would be helpful on this point. 
Barnier raised it with him when they met, he said. He also dismissed the idea 
that not having border controls at the Northern Ireland/Ireland border could 
allow people to evade UK border controls.

There are 50m people land at British airports every year. It is a very 
long-winded way to get into the UK to come via Dublin.

Instead, he hinted that a solution might involve the Irish beefing up their 
own security.

I also went to Dublin. They were equally keen to maintain this, and we may 
well have discussions with them at some point about their own incoming 
security, so that we’ve got some watchlist-type thing there. But that’s for 
them to decide, not me.

 * He said the government was looking at four possible options for the UK’s 
relationship with the customs union.They were: being fully in; fully out; a 
partially inside Turkish model of being inside the customs union but outside 
the single market; and a Swiss model of being outside the customs union but 
with customs arrangements. 
 * He confirmed that, if Britain had a trade deal with the EU, it would have 
to follow the decisions of an external arbitration body. Hilary Benn, the 
committee chairman, suggested this undermined leave claims that leaving was 
about taking back control. But Davis said a trade arbitration body would only 
cover trade, unlike the European court of justice. 
 * He said that in future he might brief the Brexit committee in private on 
the government’s plans. 
 * He said that he expected his department to be wound up within two and a 
half years. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Here’s a line from the evidence I missed about 15 minutes ago.

David Davis <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis> tells MPs govt 
doesn't know if Article 50 process can be stopped once it starts - whether its 
'revocable'

<https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/809066295736094720> 
Summary coming soon ...
 
Hilary Benn is wrapping up.

Q: Will the great repeal bill be published in draft?

Davis says he cannot give that assurance, but he will write to Benn about that.

Q: Can you commit to giving parliament a vote on the final Brexit deal?

Davis says the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act covers this, and that 
the government will obey the law to the letter.

And that’s it. The hearing is over.

I’ll post a summary soon.
 
Labour’s Seema Malhotra goes next.

Davis says ministers in his department have seen 130 companies to discuss 
Brexit since the summer. In other departments ministers have seen companies too.

He is trying to work out what the problems are in each area. He asks people to 
quantify the problems, and to propose solutions.
 
Q: Could the government cut corporation tax or regulations to make the UK a 
more attractive location, if the European commission tries to punish us?

Davis says Gove makes a good point, but that he is not a natural mercantilist. 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism>
 
The Conservative Michael Gove goes next.

Q: It is sometime said that the European commission will want to punish the UK 
to stop other countries leaving. What is the worst that they could do?

Davis says he does not want to give them ideas.
 
Labour’s Pat McFadden goes next.

Q: Is the government still committed to getting net migration below 100,000?

Davis says the prime minister and the home secretary have said this is still 
the goal. But they have stressed this will take time.

Q: Is is reasonable for people to expect this target to be met?

Davis said it is reasonable to expect this to happen “but over time”.
 
Here is the start of the Press Association story about the hearing.

Brexit Secretary David Davis <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis> 
has said he is ready to accept a transitional arrangement to implement the 
terms of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU “if it’s necessary and only if it’s 
necessary”.

And he indicated that the government is working on four possible outcomes from 
the Brexit talks in relation to the European Customs Union.

These range from being fully or partially inside the Union to having a free 
trade agreement and customs arrangement with the remaining EU to being 
“completely outside”.

Chancellor Philip Hammond said earlier this week that businesses, regulators 
and “thoughtful” politicians on both sides of the Channel recognised that a 
transition deal would be “generally helpful” to avoid the shock of a sudden 
cliff-edge switch to new arrangements post-Brexit.

But Davis told MPs on the Commons Exiting the EU committee that voters wanted 
Brexit delivered “properly and soon”.

“A transitional arrangement means many things to different people,” said Davis.

“An implementation phase? If it is necessary and only if it is necessary. 

“But the British people want this done with some degree of expedition, they 
want it done properly and soon and that is what we are trying to do.”

Joking that “I hope you can classify me as a thoughtful politician”, the 
Brexit secretary said he believed Hammond’s comment related to politicians in 
other EU states.

On the spectrum of possible outcomes being considered by the government, he 
said: “The four I have in mind are inside the Customs Union; a ‘partially 
inside’ Turkish model; outside with a free trade agreement and a customs 
arrangement; and completely outside.”

Davis revealed that the Government’s plan for Brexit will not be published 
before February.

MPs voted last week for the plan to be made public before the triggering of 
two-year withdrawal talks under article 50 of the EU treaties, which prime 
ministerTheresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has said 
she will evoke by the end of March.

Asked when MPs and voters can expect to see the plan, Davis said: “As soon as 
we can, once all of the research and policy is completed.

“It won’t be next month. The policy work is still under way, there are quite a 
few decisions still to be made.”

And he made clear that - while he wanted to be “as open as we can” in 
revealing the government’s intentions - May will continue to hold some of the 
UK’s cards close to her chest.

“We have got to be careful about what we do publish,” said Davis. 

“I want to be as open as we can be, but we must be sure we are not undermining 
our own position.”
 
The Conservative Alistair Burt goes next.

Q: You talked about a closed session with the committee earlier. So will you 
come back to brief us in a closed session?

Possibly, says Davis.

He says sometimes in these negotiations information is sensitive, and needs to 
be kept private, for a few days.

Q: Is it helpful to you for MPs to tweak the tail of the EU by writing 
letters. (That is a reference tothis letter from Tory MPs.) 
<http://news.sky.com/story/britons-in-eu-must-have-rights-protected-mps-tell-donald-tusk-10675183>

Davis says he is far too much of a pro to answer a question like this.

(In other words, he won’t be drawn into slagging off his colleagues.)
 
Hilary Benn goes next.

Q: Would a trade deal involve the UK having to accept the verdict of an 
arbitration body?

Yes, says Davis.

Q: So what is the difference between being subject to that, and being subject 
to the European court of justice?

Davis says one just affects trade, while the ECJ has an impact on what happens 
in the UK.

 * Davis says after Brexit UK may still be bound by the decisions of an 
international arbitration body.
