You sigh and your shoulders droop. Never again. That never is declared once 
more behind a chalky cloud fired by your own breath against the bitter and 
black air. You repeatedly shake your head, as if being interrogated by some 
unseen ghoul. All that money spent. All the miles crossed by train, car or bus. 
All of those other things you could have been doing, and instead you were 
watching a capitulation in Greenock, a rout in Dundee, a hiding in Dingwall, a 
trouncing in Stranraer. Could even the worst cinema trip, 3D glasses, price and 
all, feel half as bad as conceding an injury-time winner?

Could even a doleful traipse around a retail park have foisted upon you quite 
the same gloom as a 3-0 defeat and one shot on goal? When you are there, an 
away defeat somehow feels thicker, more profound, more scarring, more 
alienating than its homemade equivalent. It jars. Losing at your place, there 
is comfort in numbers and routine, in dwelling and wallowing among people and 
bricks you know well.

 With plastic bags full of food for the bus, chef Matty McNeil wait in the 
morning chill. His homemade, still hot, pies are an instant hit. 
Something probably goes awry on the way home; flat tyre, cancelled train, shut 
pub. The away day festers on Monday and still rankles on Wednesday. Then, on 
Thursday a whisper niggles: perhaps Peterhead away next week will be a cracker, 
perhaps you’ll put things right at Queen of the South, perhaps you’ll get 
something at East End Park, you usually do, or so it feels in the blinkered 
logic of grief. Saturday morning bends your ear with talk of places on the 
coach and a ticket going spare; Saturday afternoon twists your arm with a home 
victory. You’re going. Away again, like nothing could possibly go wrong.

We have always gone away. If it wasn’t a steam train coach full of your 
brethren, it was the merry charabanc. The wild boys of the Brake Clubs even 
used horse-drawn wagonettes. Flat-capped cyclists travelled too, clunking past 
ragged-trousered walkers. Folk of the same town and the same team, banded 
together, representatives, diplomats in knitwear.

 Neil, showing off his cup final tattoo. 
From the Brake lads smashing up shops and stoning goalkeepers, to those in a 
casual state of mind, some have not always had a glorious record. Most have, 
though. Most of us know – and have always known – that an away day is to be 
treasured and not wrecked. The plans and the early start, the meeting up and 
the setting off, the travelling and the arriving. Modern life has all but 
robbed others of such big days out, such jollies with their rituals, endless 
refreshments, collections for the driver and 5p poker hands.

 A Hibs fan looks out from a gap in the old main stand. 
The day is peppered with moments and sightings that provoke fleeting 
solidarity: the scarf draped from the car window, the minibus carrying 15 of 
“yours”, the nods at motorway services, the snatched prediction chats beneath 
Departures boards at junction railway stations, singing songs of your club 
outside someone else’s. To enter the ground – and how you are envied if it is 
your first time here – hop those steps and see hundreds, thousands of your 
people transposed to another place hastens the pulse and stings the throat. 
Perhaps nothing will go wrong.

 The light slips away at Somerset Park. 
Today the Hibees go south-west, and to Ayr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ayr>, port-side to seaside. No Brake Club 
this: the pies are homemade, the chocolate truffles too. Truffles. Green and 
white seems to give a feeling of strength in unity, a shield. A bowling club 
welcomes the hoards, this jovial army. There is pleasure at thirsts met. On the 
bus, after all, Scotland’s finest allow not even moderation. At seductive 
Somerset Park they arrive among thousands of their singsong own. Everything 
goes right.
