Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, founding member of the legendary rap group, claims 
that the stores, which also included Walmart and Jet, did not have the right to 
sell products including T-shirts, wallets and hats bearing the Run-DMC logo. 
McDaniels, who owns a firm named Run-DMC Brand, said that these products 
violated federal trademark laws.

Keen to stress the value of the brand’s iconic logo, McDaniels pointed out 
that it had been licensed legitimately in the past to sportswear companies such 
as Adidas.

McDaniels founded Run DMC in 1981 along with fellow rapper Joseph “Run” 
Simmons and DJ Jam Master Jay, who was shot dead in 2002. Their hits include 
King of Rock, It’s Tricky and the pioneering Aerosmith coverWalk This Way
