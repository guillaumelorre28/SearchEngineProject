Theresa May’s speech on Brexit on Tuesday confirmed that Britain will be 
leaving the single market, interpreting UK control over EU migration as a key 
demand by those who voted to Leave in last year’s referendum.

May used a section of her speech to say she wants to guarantee the rights of 
EU nationals in Britain, and Britons living inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, as soon as possible.

But her speech did little to reassure Nicolas Hatton, the founder of group 
the3million <http://www.the3million.org.uk/>.

“EU citizens are living in limbo and Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has done very little to 
reassure them today,” he said.

We want to hear from EU citizens living in the UK as well as British citizens 
living acrossEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. What did 
you think of the speech? Do you feel reassured by it, or are you worried about 
its implications for your future?
