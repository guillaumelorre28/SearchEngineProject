A man has been arrested after armed police dealt with what was thought to have 
been a hostage situation at a bookmakers near Newcastle.

Three people managed to get out safely and officers freed a fourth before 
going in and arresting the man, who was armed with a gun. The incident took 
place inside the Coral branch in Jarrow, in Tyne and Wear on Sunday evening.

“A firearm has been seized by officers and the 39-year-old man will be taken 
into police custody,” Northumbria police said.

Witnesses reported hearing shots fired a few moments after the last hostage 
was freed, but officers said a “police-issue ‘less lethal weapon’ was 
discharged during the incident” and that no one had been injured.
