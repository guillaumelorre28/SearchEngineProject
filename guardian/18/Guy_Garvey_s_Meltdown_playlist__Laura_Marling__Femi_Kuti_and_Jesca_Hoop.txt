Femi Kuti – Truth Don’t Die

“I saw him play Glastonbury and it was literally the best gig I have ever 
seen; pure, unbridled energy. His wife, who is one of his dancers, is doing a 
dance workshop at Meltdown, and his son is in the brass section of his band as 
well. It’s a family affair.”

Lift to Experience – These Are the Days

“I never thought I would see the best rock three-piece I have ever seen play 
together again. To have them reform for my Meltdown after 20 years apart is a 
total honour.”

Laura Marling – Strange

“Laura is an old friend and one of our best songwriters. She supported Elbow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/elbow> in 2008 on the back of her first 
album and I said then she would be around for a long time. She was my first 
call.”
