A London square whose wealthy residents have included Margaret Thatcher and 
Sean Connery has been crowned the most expensive in England and Wales with an 
average house price of nearly £17m.


Eaton Square, in the upmarket Belgravia district 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/12/grosvenor-crescent-london-most-expensive-street-britain>
 of west London, topped a list dominated by addresses in the capital, according 
to an annual survey by Lloyds Bank.

But the lender’s research also found that every region in England and Wales 
now has at least one “million-pound street”.

Built by the Grosvenor family in the 19th century, Eaton Square features grand 
homes and apartments featuring Grade II-listed white stucco facades.


It has been home to at least three prime ministers and two James Bonds, with 
Connery and Roger Moore both lending it a touch of 007 glamour, contributing to 
an average house price of £16.9m.

The sum is more than double last year’s highest average price of £8m

The bank said this did not reflect a broader surge in house prices, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/uk-house-price-rise-halifax> 
but was more likely to do with the small number of transactions in any given 
period, which means that one astronomical sale can distort the average.

One home on Eaton Square sold for £25m

 earlier this year, dragging the street’s average up, despite an overall 
slowdown in multimillion-pound house purchases.

At nearly £17m, the average price on the street is more than three times 
higher than in the most costly areas outside London, Weybridge and Leatherhead.

But addresses in the capital dominate the list of the most expensive streets, 
with seven of the top 10 found in just two London boroughs, Westminster and 
Kensington.

While London dominates the list, the Lloyds research revealed that every 
region in England and Wales now has at least one street where the average house 
price is more than £1m.

Outside London and the south-east, the wealthiest addresses are those in, or 
close to themillionaires’ playground of Sandbanks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/feb/05/property.lifeandhealth> in Poole 
on the Dorset south coast.

Panorama Road is the most exclusive address on the highly sought-after 
peninsula, with houses priced at £4.6m on average.

Crick Road in Oxford also scrapes into the top 20 at slightly more than £4m.

Altrincham in Greater Manchester is home to northern England’s highest house 
prices, at an average of £2m, followed by Leycester Road in Knutsford, 
Cheshire, at £1.79m.

Most of the north-east’s highest entries are in or near Newcastle, led by 
Runnymede Road in Ponteland, Northumberland, at £1.1m, while East Anglia’s list 
is topped by Storey’s Way in Cambridge at £1.9m.

The West Midlands is represented by Farquhar Road in Edgbaston (£1.4m), with 
the east Midlands not far behind at £1.3m for a home on Warren Hill in Newton 
Linford, Leicester.

The seaside resort of Llandudno takes top spot in Wales, with the average home 
on Llys Helyg Drive just squeezing in above the £1m mark.

Yorkshire and the Humber are dominated by the “Golden Triangle” between 
Harrogate, Wetherby and north Leeds, with Ling Lane in Leeds the most expensive 
at £1.3m.

In Devon and Cornwall, the city of Truro comes first, with homes on 
Restronguet Point selling for £1.8m.

Andrew Mason, mortgage director at Lloyds Bank, said: “Eaton Square, and prime 
central [London] locations such as Westminster, and Kensington and Chelsea, 
have established reputations as exclusive addresses.

“Not only do these streets possess a rich historical legacy, but properties 
located there are some of the most prestigious in the world and are close to 
superb local amenities in Knightsbridge, Sloane Street and Chelsea, as well as 
the capital’s business and entertainment districts.”

“Away from London, our figures show that the most expensive streets tend to be 
tightly clustered within pockets in the same area.

For example, the Edgbaston district in Birmingham, the Wilmslow and Altrincham 
areas in Cheshire, the so-called ’Golden Triangle’ in Yorkshire and the Humber 
and Sandbanks in Dorset on the south coast.”

The data was compiled from more than 1.7m postcodes, using Land Registry data 
for transactions between January 2011 and October 2016.
