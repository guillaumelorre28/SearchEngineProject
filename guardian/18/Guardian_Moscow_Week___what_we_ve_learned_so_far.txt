Coming up in Guardian Moscow Week

Chris Michael

Thanks for being with us! The hashtag got hijacked, we sparked a controversy 
over whether Edward Snowden can be considered a Muscovite, heard from the 
city’s migrant workforce, met our Instagrammers for the week and had an 
emotional debate in the Moscow sunshine. And that was just day one.

Fishman and architect Yevgeny Asse at the Guardian Cities debate at Strelka on 
8 June 2015. Photograph: Masha Kortunova 
Tomorrow Shaun Walker goes inside TV Rain, Moscow’s only independent 
television channel.

After a year in which the channel was almost bullied out of existence, and 
spent a month broadcasting from a studio apartment, the mood [at the fifth 
birthday party] was one of relief and perseverance as much as celebration. It 
was also a moment of vindication, and a sign that the channel had real support 
among Muscovites. “Nobody needs counter-propaganda,” said Mikhail Zygar, the 
editor-in-chief of the channel, a few weeks later at the station’s new studios, 
inside a renovated perfume factory in northern Moscow. “Our goal is not to 
fight anything, our goal is just to give people who don’t have real information 
the thing they don’t have.”

On Wednesday, Oliver Wainwright streams live from the Garage art gallery, and 
we hold a live Q+A with Petr “I nailed my scrotum to Red Square” Pavlensky, 
who’s part of the gallery’s exhibition of protest art. Maryam Omidi also 
explores the mixed messages for women in Moscow:

From officials arguing that middle-aged men should be able to marry teenagers 
becausewomen are often “shrivelled” by the age of 27 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/15/russian-official-shrivelled-women-marriage>
, to the recent launch of Tittygram, aka “Uber for boobs” 
<http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-uber-for-boobs-start-up-tittygram-sees-business-boom/519398.html>
, it seems that not a day goes by without a story in the Moscow media about 
sexism. And yet women in the capital are far from second-class citizens.

On Thursday, our cycling expert Nick Mead tells the struggle of the world’s 
most cycle-unfriendly city to embrace the bike, while Agata Pyzik discusses the 
deeper meanings of Moscow’s food revolution, which we’ll be following all week 
via one of our Instagrammers as well. And we also spoke to restaurant critic 
Anna Maslovskaya, who has this fairly hilarious point to make:

Then on Friday we look at Skolkovo, Moscow’s attempt to build a silicon valley 
from scratch, and flip today’s quiz on its head by getting Muscovites to test 
western audiences on their city.

We’ll close the blog now, with some final thoughts from the people of Moscow. 
Thanks again, and stay with us as we go deeper into Russia’s capital starting 
tomorrow.

Of course central Moscow is only one half of the story - perhaps less. Most 
people (about 85%) live outside the garden ring, in the vast spray of suburbs 
that makes this the sixth-largest city in the world.

Coming up on Friday, Owen Hatherley will report on the architecture of the 
awe-inspiring Moscow suburbs, but in the meantime here’s Mark Rice-Oxley on the 
ground:

The first thing that strikes you about the suburbs is the SPACE. Because 
everyone lives up in the air, not cheek by jowl on the ground, there are huge 
open reaches that nobody seems to quite know what to do with. There are far 
fewer amenities like playgrounds, swimming pools, sports centres and even 
formal parks out here, which makes the suburbs seem a little unloved.

But there are two buts. The first is that the bulldozers and diggers are 
coming. In every suburb I went to in the past week, there were signs of huge 
construction activity. And secondly, I’d like to argue just for a minute that 
tower blocks aren’t all that bad. They may look ugly and tired in places, but 
they are energy efficient (important in a city which must keep 11 million 
people warm for six subzero months of the year); they encourage neighbourliness 
and a community spirit. They obviate loneliness. And they have these great 
rubbish chutes that you can use to dump your trash 22 stories down to the 
ground.

And Dolgoprudny resident Longponds says things are - finally - changing...
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13024777> Longponds  
<https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13024777> 08 June 2015 9:19am 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/53450811>  This comment 
has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate 
I live in the suburbs (Dolgoprudny) and have to say that in the last three 
years things have started to improve. Greener spaces, greater emphasis on 
people clearing up after themselves (one local park by the canal used to just 
resemble a rubbish tip, but now is a great place and hugely popular). Of course 
it's relative - the starting point was very low and there is still much that 
needs to be done. However, I have actually witnessed a change taking place.

Some of what you’ve been saying on Twitter and GuardianWitness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/15/moscow-changing-better-worse-regeneration>
 about what it means to be a Muscovite, and whether the city is changing for 
better or worse.

Another initiative of the new government team is a website and app called 
“Active citizen”, billed as letting user “directly influence government 
decisions”. It asks users to choose names for new parks or the colour of new 
stadium seats, ignoring such important problems as widening of toll parking 
zones, closure of hospitals, toll city entrance for private transport, and the 
need for special car lanes for state lawmakers. And this is what the “new” 
Moscow is about. Behind opulent vegetation, new pavement and colorful stadium 
seats, there are problems which are getting worse as time goes on.” -Olga 
Platunova, over email

Better on the Surface, Still Has Inclusion and Institutional Issues 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5554c4e6e4b0e7790b8375f2/1527963>

What do I mean?

I mean that no one really asked us, Moscow residents, about the changes being 
made in the city (although a really welcome a big part of them).

Starting from the very first days of his mayorship Mr. Sobyanin has been 
showing us that he is a true pillar of so-called "power vertical" and while 
acting as one is not going to provide for any citizens' inclusion in decision 
making process. And lack of inclusion and mutual trust between the residents is 
in the end the main problem of Moscow as a city and a community (in my opinion).

You can build as much fancy stuff as the money allows you to (and Moscow 
budget is comperable to some of the European countries') but if the moscovites 
do not trust each other and don't consider this city to truly belong to them, 
it will never become a real city and will continue to exist as "a big village" 
with fancy parks, craft beer and bycicle service.

I will be happy to elaborate on that and provide lots of examples if you 
contact me

Why are Moscow's migrants leaving?

Chris Michael

Alec Luhn has filed a special report on the people who power Moscow’s huge 
economy - not the oligarchs but the Tajiks, Uzbeks and other migrants who work 
at the construction sites, shovel snow and drive the hordes of “gypsy cabs” 
that take Muscovites home at night.

But the mood has changed, and migrants are leaving in droves, he reports.

The permit cost has worsened an already tough situation for migrant workers, 
who often face discrimination and persecution by crooked employers, officials 
and landlords. A quick search of rental announcements in Moscow will reveal 
that most listings are for Russian or “Slavic” people only.

Is the wonder that any migrants are staying in Moscow? Read it here

What does it mean to be a Muscovite? 

The inclusion of Edward Snowden in our young power list 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/08/30-under-30-moscows-young-power-list>
 has sparked a heated debate about what it means to be aMoskvich.

According to the dictionary, a “Muscovite is an inhabitant or native of a 
city”. So does someone who’s lived here for two years make the grade? Or is a 
long-term emotional investment in the city required? Are you only ever a true 
Muscovite if you were born here ... or can the title be earned?

Moscow Instagram takeovers

Francesca Perry

We’ve teamed up with some of Moscow’s best Instagrammers this week as well. 
First up, we have a takeover on@guardiancities 
<https://instagram.com/guardiancities/> from Evgeniya Muravyeva (@evmsk 
<https://instagram.com/evmsk/>): here’s her first picture of the week.

We’ve also got other great Instagrammers capturing different aspects of the 
city:

 * Katya Trofimova (@ohmymoscow <https://instagram.com/ohmymoscow/>) is 
sharing pictures of “unknown Moscow” - those parts of the city which might be 
overlooked but are great to discover

 * Alexey Balashov (@mikkymay <https://instagram.com/mikkymay/>) will be 
snapping the oases of calm in the city, Moscow’s quiet and peaceful spots in 
the heart of the metropolis 
 * Anya Latariya (@latarianna <https://instagram.com/latarianna/>) is going to 
show us the best of Russian cuisine in Moscow 
 * Chirag Nikam (@chiragushka <https://instagram.com/chiragushka/>) is 
focusing on the city’s architecture, seeking out the most unusual buildings 
Follow #GuardianMoscow on Instagram to see all the photos, and if you live in 
the city contribute your own pictures of how Moscow is changing. We’ll round up 
some of the images in a gallery on Friday.

Our very heated - and very hot - debate in the Moscow sunshine ended up 
lasting two hours, and featured some excellent instances of passion, 
finger-pointing and tears. Well, no tears. Is bottom-up organising horribly 
naive (or worse, a waste of time) when it’s only by gaining access to power 
that you can actually get stuff done? What’s the point of building a flower 
garden when the city council paves it over the next day? Should New Moscow - a 
cash cow for developers - just be scrapped? Where are Moscow’s neighbourhoods? 
And yes, Muscovites might be engaged like never before - but getting anyone to 
listen might be a whole other story.

It’s hoverboards and classical music at Gorky Park, what else? T-journal 
<https://tjournal.ru/p/park-gorkogo-denis-matsuev> report on a project 
attempting to turn the regenerated park into a “studio without borders”. Stage 
one: musician Denis Matsuev taking to his grand piano in the middle of the 
Golitsyn pond, as dancers on water-jet hoverboards swooshed around his head.

The performance was recorded for the TV series Park, which aired on Channel 
One over the weekend, and was captured by passerby on Instagram.

Quiz: How much do you know about Moscow?

Mark Rice-Oxley

Was the film Gorky Park set in Moscow? What’s a Moscow mule? And what statue 
of Vladimir is set to be erected overlooking the city? Test how much you really 
know about the Russian capital bytaking our quiz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/08/moscow-quiz-russia-test>. And 
let us know your scores using#guardianmoscow - disappointingly non-monetary 
acknowledgments to the best results.

Meanwhile, some quick news snippets from Moscow on a quiet, sky-blue June 
Monday morning:


 * Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has been on TV, inspecting stuff at a food 
security forum. Last week, we followed him inspecting stuff at a high-tech 
innovation hub. Seems he has found a role in the Putocracy at last.

 <https://twitter.com/markriceoxley69/status/606089205278756864> June 3, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/markriceoxley69/status/606089205278756864> 
 * A criminal case has been launched against the owners of Domodedovo airport 
for negligence in connection with a 2011 terrorist attack that killed 37. 
 * Some children were injured messing around with a gas canister on a camping 
expedition. 
 * In only slightly jollier news, there are 47 “beaches” in Moscow ... only 10 
of which have been cleared for swimming. The others have all kinds of health 
hazards at play, including an infestation of mosquito larvae.

As ever, though, you need to look a bit further afield in Russia for the 
daftest news story of the day. In Siberia, a drunk man destroyed a statue of 
Lenin while taking a selfie. There are, of course,pictures

Our social affairs reporter Amelia Gentleman (a one-time Moscow correspondent 
herself) asked four very different Muscovites - an ex-TV producer, a surgeon, a 
retired couple and a former MrsRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>
 - for their thoughts on Moscow life under sanctions.


She got, not surprisingly, four very different types of answers from across 
the political spectrum. But there’s one thing everyone in Moscow agrees on:


Absurd as it sounds, I miss the cheeses. In Soviet Russia there were no 
specialist cheeses, there was really just one type. It wasn’t even really 
cheese – something similar to cheese, but not quite cheese – so when you got 
these cheeses in the 1990s, when people tried them … cheese came to symbolise 
the range of things you could have in a post-Soviet state. Even poorer people 
could choose between five and 10 imported varieties and it was quite 
affordable,” Evgeny adds, laughing about the amount of attention cheese 
consumption has attracted since sanctions were introduced. “You can still find 
them in some shops, but the prices are exorbitant.”

That’s coming up tomorrow. In the meantime, we stopped to chat with Andrey and 
Svetlana, psychotherapists who have some incisive comments about bike lanes ... 
and booze.

Mark Rice-Oxley is a former Moscow correspondent who is back in the city after 
10 years - and shocked by the changes since he last lived here.

The short story is Moscow has changed beyond all recognition in the past 
generation. Twenty years ago there were few spaces in which to stroll 
agreeably. Now the entire historic centre is a pedestrianised wanderfest. 
Fountains, trees (does Moscow have more trees than any other big city?), cafes 
... the city appears to have moved psychologically at least 1,000km west, to be 
situated in centralEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
somewhere. In fact, perhaps it has changed more than any other major world 
metropolis. Dhaka, Shanghai and Dubai might have something to say about that. 
You might as well.”

Muscovite Kate Mikhaleynko does. She tells us via GuardianWitness:


I can definitely see improvement in the capital: public transport operates 
better, local government services are better organised, the streets are 
cleaner... in my old neighbourhood (a very working-class, high-immigrant 
community), there are more ‘high-street’ shops appearing, less potholes on the 
roads, new playgrounds, new trees being planted and even the occasional 
fountain being built. These things may seem little and shallow, but I can 
certainly see improvement in this sense, at least.”

One of the people responsible for some of these changes is Gorky Park director 
Olga Zakharova, who we caught up with earlier. She points out that giving 
people what they want is not rocket science:

Is Moscow changing for better or worse? That’s the question we’re asking today

The Insider’s Cultural Guide to Moscow

From space-travelling babushkas to grainy electronic music, the Russian 
capital has come a very long way since the legendary 1991 rock concert that 
drew an audience 16 times bigger than Glastonbury’s.


Igor Zinatulin brings us up to date with an insider’s guide to Moscow’s 
cultural scene 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/08/the-insiders-cultural-guide-to-moscow-concrete-coding-and-soviet-ghosts>
, featuring a bit of coding, a lot of concrete, and a new craze called Coub.

 Interstellar babushka 
There is a coub <http://coub.com/> for anything on the internet. Created by 
designer Igor Gladkoborov, Coub is an online service for editing and sharing 
looped videos. Since its launch, it has become a new web cult for its users in 
Russia, with thousands of witty snippets thrown on to social media every day – 
such as the one above, which sends an unsuspecting babushka on the Moscow metro 
into outer space. Coub is a testament to the success of Moscow’s remix culture, 
whereby new artworks are constantly being derived from old material (orrecent 
Game of Thrones episodes <http://coub.com/view/6efpn>)”

Is the 'Moscow Experiment' over?

Chris Michael

Russia’s capital has begun a “liveable city” transformation – 
pedestrianisation, new parks, cycle lanes. But as Shaun Walker writes, western 
sanctions and falling oil prices have changed the political climate in the 
country, and many are wondering if Moscow’s “experiment” is about to end.

Among the Muscovites Shaun spoke to was Alexei Navalny, the charismatic 
opposition leader who ran for mayor and who has his own strong ideas on the 
“Moscow Experiment”:


Of course you can’t deny the improvements, they are there. But basically, what 
has happened is there was a huge gap in quality of life between Moscow and most 
normal western cities, and we’ve closed that gap slightly. I don’t think 
there’s any correlation between bicycle lanes and political activity. If you 
think falsifying elections is bad, no amount of bicycles are going to help you.”
Alexei Navalny

Welcome to Guardian Moscow Week / Московская неделя Guardian!

Chris Michael

What’s that sound?


Yes, it’s the great roar of the Russian capital ... the 10-lane symphony that 
is Moscow traffic. And it’s a fitting backdrop to day one of our weeklong 
exploration of all things Muscovite.

With relations between Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> and 
the west growing tenser, we’re spending a week in the Russian capital, 
exploring the realities of life in this remarkable city. From cycling to 
sanctions, media to gentrification, the Cities desk and New East network have 
joined forces with the Guardian’s international newsdesk to look beyond the 
headlines (and the inevitable hipsters) and ask Muscovites what they really 
think.

We’ll be using video, live debates and social media – in both English and 
Russian – in an effort to seek a wider perspective and deeper understanding of 
modern life in Moscow. The key to this whole project will be hearing from you: 
you can tweet using the hashtag#guardianmoscow and of course leave comments 
under our articles. To comment in Russian, emailmoscow.week@theguardian.com 
<mailto:moscow.week@theguardian.com>.


We kick off with a special report. The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Shaun 
Walker, is asking whether the “Moscow Experiment” – the project to open up the 
waterfront, encourage cycling and green space, and generally liven up the city –
is about to come to a crashing halt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/08/is-the-moscow-experiment-over-gorky-park-sergei-kapkov-alexei-navalny>
.

Then at 12pm noon Moscow time (10am in the UK), Shaun will host a live debate 
at the Strelka Institute in the heart of Moscow - which is also doubling as 
Guardian Moscow HQ - asking the very same question: Is the Moscow Experiment 
over?

Also today: Alec Luhn’s exploration of why Moscow’s migrants are fleeing the 
capital, our insider’s cultural guide to Moscow, and the piece everyone in 
Moscow isalready talking about even though we haven’t launched it yet ... who 
made the cut of our 30 Under 30 list of Moscow’s young movers and shakers?


Our crack Guardian Moscow squad - Judith Soal, Maeve Shearlaw, Mark Rice-Oxley 
and myself - will be out taking the pulse of the capital. We’ve already 
doorstepped Roman Abramovich, so things are off to a promising beginning.

He wished us well before security intervened.

In the meantime, however, take a hard look at yourself and ask: how much do 
you REALLY know about the Russian capital?Take our quiz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/08/moscow-quiz-russia-test> and 
tell us how you did. Best result gets a non-monetary prize that is almost 
certain to be disappointing. What’s that hashtag again? That’s right it’s
#guardianmoscow


Thanks for joining us and stay tuned for lots more: we’re live from Moscow all 
day.

Thanks for being with us! The hashtag got hijacked, we sparked a controversy 
over whether Edward Snowden can be considered a Muscovite, heard from the 
city’s migrant workforce, met our Instagrammers for the week and had an 
emotional debate in the Moscow sunshine. And that was just day one.

Fishman and architect Yevgeny Asse at the Guardian Cities debate at Strelka on 
8 June 2015. Photograph: Masha Kortunova 
Tomorrow Shaun Walker goes inside TV Rain, Moscow’s only independent 
television channel.

After a year in which the channel was almost bullied out of existence, and 
spent a month broadcasting from a studio apartment, the mood [at the fifth 
birthday party] was one of relief and perseverance as much as celebration. It 
was also a moment of vindication, and a sign that the channel had real support 
among Muscovites. “Nobody needs counter-propaganda,” said Mikhail Zygar, the 
editor-in-chief of the channel, a few weeks later at the station’s new studios, 
inside a renovated perfume factory in northern Moscow. “Our goal is not to 
fight anything, our goal is just to give people who don’t have real information 
the thing they don’t have.”

On Wednesday, Oliver Wainwright streams live from the Garage art gallery, and 
we hold a live Q+A with Petr “I nailed my scrotum to Red Square” Pavlensky, 
who’s part of the gallery’s exhibition of protest art. Maryam Omidi also 
explores the mixed messages for women in Moscow:

From officials arguing that middle-aged men should be able to marry teenagers 
becausewomen are often “shrivelled” by the age of 27 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/15/russian-official-shrivelled-women-marriage>
, to the recent launch of Tittygram, aka “Uber for boobs” 
<http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-uber-for-boobs-start-up-tittygram-sees-business-boom/519398.html>
, it seems that not a day goes by without a story in the Moscow media about 
sexism. And yet women in the capital are far from second-class citizens.

On Thursday, our cycling expert Nick Mead tells the struggle of the world’s 
most cycle-unfriendly city to embrace the bike, while Agata Pyzik discusses the 
deeper meanings of Moscow’s food revolution, which we’ll be following all week 
via one of our Instagrammers as well. And we also spoke to restaurant critic 
Anna Maslovskaya, who has this fairly hilarious point to make:

Then on Friday we look at Skolkovo, Moscow’s attempt to build a silicon valley 
from scratch, and flip today’s quiz on its head by getting Muscovites to test 
western audiences on their city.

We’ll close the blog now, with some final thoughts from the people of Moscow. 
Thanks again, and stay with us as we go deeper into Russia’s capital starting 
tomorrow.
 
Of course central Moscow is only one half of the story - perhaps less. Most 
people (about 85%) live outside the garden ring, in the vast spray of suburbs 
that makes this the sixth-largest city in the world.

Coming up on Friday, Owen Hatherley will report on the architecture of the 
awe-inspiring Moscow suburbs, but in the meantime here’s Mark Rice-Oxley on the 
ground:

The first thing that strikes you about the suburbs is the SPACE. Because 
everyone lives up in the air, not cheek by jowl on the ground, there are huge 
open reaches that nobody seems to quite know what to do with. There are far 
fewer amenities like playgrounds, swimming pools, sports centres and even 
formal parks out here, which makes the suburbs seem a little unloved.

But there are two buts. The first is that the bulldozers and diggers are 
coming. In every suburb I went to in the past week, there were signs of huge 
construction activity. And secondly, I’d like to argue just for a minute that 
tower blocks aren’t all that bad. They may look ugly and tired in places, but 
they are energy efficient (important in a city which must keep 11 million 
people warm for six subzero months of the year); they encourage neighbourliness 
and a community spirit. They obviate loneliness. And they have these great 
rubbish chutes that you can use to dump your trash 22 stories down to the 
ground.

And Dolgoprudny resident Longponds says things are - finally - changing...
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13024777> Longponds  
<https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13024777> 08 June 2015 9:19am 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/53450811>  This comment 
has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate 
I live in the suburbs (Dolgoprudny) and have to say that in the last three 
years things have started to improve. Greener spaces, greater emphasis on 
people clearing up after themselves (one local park by the canal used to just 
resemble a rubbish tip, but now is a great place and hugely popular). Of course 
it's relative - the starting point was very low and there is still much that 
needs to be done. However, I have actually witnessed a change taking place.
 
Some of what you’ve been saying on Twitter and GuardianWitness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/15/moscow-changing-better-worse-regeneration>
 about what it means to be a Muscovite, and whether the city is changing for 
better or worse.

Another initiative of the new government team is a website and app called 
“Active citizen”, billed as letting user “directly influence government 
decisions”. It asks users to choose names for new parks or the colour of new 
stadium seats, ignoring such important problems as widening of toll parking 
zones, closure of hospitals, toll city entrance for private transport, and the 
need for special car lanes for state lawmakers. And this is what the “new” 
Moscow is about. Behind opulent vegetation, new pavement and colorful stadium 
seats, there are problems which are getting worse as time goes on.” -Olga 
Platunova, over email

Better on the Surface, Still Has Inclusion and Institutional Issues 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5554c4e6e4b0e7790b8375f2/1527963>

What do I mean?

I mean that no one really asked us, Moscow residents, about the changes being 
made in the city (although a really welcome a big part of them).

Starting from the very first days of his mayorship Mr. Sobyanin has been 
showing us that he is a true pillar of so-called "power vertical" and while 
acting as one is not going to provide for any citizens' inclusion in decision 
making process. And lack of inclusion and mutual trust between the residents is 
in the end the main problem of Moscow as a city and a community (in my opinion).

You can build as much fancy stuff as the money allows you to (and Moscow 
budget is comperable to some of the European countries') but if the moscovites 
do not trust each other and don't consider this city to truly belong to them, 
it will never become a real city and will continue to exist as "a big village" 
with fancy parks, craft beer and bycicle service.

I will be happy to elaborate on that and provide lots of examples if you 
contact me

Alec Luhn has filed a special report on the people who power Moscow’s huge 
economy - not the oligarchs but the Tajiks, Uzbeks and other migrants who work 
at the construction sites, shovel snow and drive the hordes of “gypsy cabs” 
that take Muscovites home at night.

But the mood has changed, and migrants are leaving in droves, he reports.

The permit cost has worsened an already tough situation for migrant workers, 
who often face discrimination and persecution by crooked employers, officials 
and landlords. A quick search of rental announcements in Moscow will reveal 
that most listings are for Russian or “Slavic” people only.

What does it mean to be a Muscovite? 

The inclusion of Edward Snowden in our young power list 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/08/30-under-30-moscows-young-power-list>
 has sparked a heated debate about what it means to be aMoskvich.

According to the dictionary, a “Muscovite is an inhabitant or native of a 
city”. So does someone who’s lived here for two years make the grade? Or is a 
long-term emotional investment in the city required? Are you only ever a true 
Muscovite if you were born here ... or can the title be earned?

We’ve teamed up with some of Moscow’s best Instagrammers this week as well. 
First up, we have a takeover on@guardiancities 
<https://instagram.com/guardiancities/> from Evgeniya Muravyeva (@evmsk 
<https://instagram.com/evmsk/>): here’s her first picture of the week.

We’ve also got other great Instagrammers capturing different aspects of the 
city:

 * Katya Trofimova (@ohmymoscow <https://instagram.com/ohmymoscow/>) is 
sharing pictures of “unknown Moscow” - those parts of the city which might be 
overlooked but are great to discover

 * Alexey Balashov (@mikkymay <https://instagram.com/mikkymay/>) will be 
snapping the oases of calm in the city, Moscow’s quiet and peaceful spots in 
the heart of the metropolis 
 * Anya Latariya (@latarianna <https://instagram.com/latarianna/>) is going to 
show us the best of Russian cuisine in Moscow 
 * Chirag Nikam (@chiragushka <https://instagram.com/chiragushka/>) is 
focusing on the city’s architecture, seeking out the most unusual buildings 
Follow #GuardianMoscow on Instagram to see all the photos, and if you live in 
the city contribute your own pictures of how Moscow is changing. We’ll round up 
some of the images in a gallery on Friday.

 
Our very heated - and very hot - debate in the Moscow sunshine ended up 
lasting two hours, and featured some excellent instances of passion, 
finger-pointing and tears. Well, no tears. Is bottom-up organising horribly 
naive (or worse, a waste of time) when it’s only by gaining access to power 
that you can actually get stuff done? What’s the point of building a flower 
garden when the city council paves it over the next day? Should New Moscow - a 
cash cow for developers - just be scrapped? Where are Moscow’s neighbourhoods? 
And yes, Muscovites might be engaged like never before - but getting anyone to 
listen might be a whole other story.

 * In only slightly jollier news, there are 47 “beaches” in Moscow ... only 10 
of which have been cleared for swimming. The others have all kinds of health 
hazards at play, including an infestation of mosquito larvae.

As ever, though, you need to look a bit further afield in Russia for the 
daftest news story of the day. In Siberia, a drunk man destroyed a statue of 
Lenin while taking a selfie. There are, of course,pictures

Our social affairs reporter Amelia Gentleman (a one-time Moscow correspondent 
herself) asked four very different Muscovites - an ex-TV producer, a surgeon, a 
retired couple and a former MrsRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>
 - for their thoughts on Moscow life under sanctions.


She got, not surprisingly, four very different types of answers from across 
the political spectrum. But there’s one thing everyone in Moscow agrees on:


Absurd as it sounds, I miss the cheeses. In Soviet Russia there were no 
specialist cheeses, there was really just one type. It wasn’t even really 
cheese – something similar to cheese, but not quite cheese – so when you got 
these cheeses in the 1990s, when people tried them … cheese came to symbolise 
the range of things you could have in a post-Soviet state. Even poorer people 
could choose between five and 10 imported varieties and it was quite 
affordable,” Evgeny adds, laughing about the amount of attention cheese 
consumption has attracted since sanctions were introduced. “You can still find 
them in some shops, but the prices are exorbitant.”

That’s coming up tomorrow. In the meantime, we stopped to chat with Andrey and 
Svetlana, psychotherapists who have some incisive comments about bike lanes ... 
and booze.
 
Mark Rice-Oxley is a former Moscow correspondent who is back in the city after 
10 years - and shocked by the changes since he last lived here.

The short story is Moscow has changed beyond all recognition in the past 
generation. Twenty years ago there were few spaces in which to stroll 
agreeably. Now the entire historic centre is a pedestrianised wanderfest. 
Fountains, trees (does Moscow have more trees than any other big city?), cafes 
... the city appears to have moved psychologically at least 1,000km west, to be 
situated in centralEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
somewhere. In fact, perhaps it has changed more than any other major world 
metropolis. Dhaka, Shanghai and Dubai might have something to say about that. 
You might as well.”

Muscovite Kate Mikhaleynko does. She tells us via GuardianWitness:


I can definitely see improvement in the capital: public transport operates 
better, local government services are better organised, the streets are 
cleaner... in my old neighbourhood (a very working-class, high-immigrant 
community), there are more ‘high-street’ shops appearing, less potholes on the 
roads, new playgrounds, new trees being planted and even the occasional 
fountain being built. These things may seem little and shallow, but I can 
certainly see improvement in this sense, at least.”

One of the people responsible for some of these changes is Gorky Park director 
Olga Zakharova, who we caught up with earlier. She points out that giving 
people what they want is not rocket science:

Is Moscow changing for better or worse? That’s the question we’re asking today

From space-travelling babushkas to grainy electronic music, the Russian 
capital has come a very long way since the legendary 1991 rock concert that 
drew an audience 16 times bigger than Glastonbury’s.


Igor Zinatulin brings us up to date with an insider’s guide to Moscow’s 
cultural scene 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/08/the-insiders-cultural-guide-to-moscow-concrete-coding-and-soviet-ghosts>
, featuring a bit of coding, a lot of concrete, and a new craze called Coub.

 Interstellar babushka 
There is a coub <http://coub.com/> for anything on the internet. Created by 
designer Igor Gladkoborov, Coub is an online service for editing and sharing 
looped videos. Since its launch, it has become a new web cult for its users in 
Russia, with thousands of witty snippets thrown on to social media every day – 
such as the one above, which sends an unsuspecting babushka on the Moscow metro 
into outer space. Coub is a testament to the success of Moscow’s remix culture, 
whereby new artworks are constantly being derived from old material (orrecent 
Game of Thrones episodes <http://coub.com/view/6efpn>)”

Russia’s capital has begun a “liveable city” transformation – 
pedestrianisation, new parks, cycle lanes. But as Shaun Walker writes, western 
sanctions and falling oil prices have changed the political climate in the 
country, and many are wondering if Moscow’s “experiment” is about to end.

Among the Muscovites Shaun spoke to was Alexei Navalny, the charismatic 
opposition leader who ran for mayor and who has his own strong ideas on the 
“Moscow Experiment”:


Of course you can’t deny the improvements, they are there. But basically, what 
has happened is there was a huge gap in quality of life between Moscow and most 
normal western cities, and we’ve closed that gap slightly. I don’t think 
there’s any correlation between bicycle lanes and political activity. If you 
think falsifying elections is bad, no amount of bicycles are going to help you.”
Alexei Navalny

We’ll also be out on the streets of Moscow today talking to people. Here is 
architect Vladimir Dudin, in the park with his daughter, who had this to say 
about what it’s like trying to raise a family in Moscow:

 
What’s that sound?


Yes, it’s the great roar of the Russian capital ... the 10-lane symphony that 
is Moscow traffic. And it’s a fitting backdrop to day one of our weeklong 
exploration of all things Muscovite.

With relations between Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> and 
the west growing tenser, we’re spending a week in the Russian capital, 
exploring the realities of life in this remarkable city. From cycling to 
sanctions, media to gentrification, the Cities desk and New East network have 
joined forces with the Guardian’s international newsdesk to look beyond the 
headlines (and the inevitable hipsters) and ask Muscovites what they really 
think.

We’ll be using video, live debates and social media – in both English and 
Russian – in an effort to seek a wider perspective and deeper understanding of 
modern life in Moscow. The key to this whole project will be hearing from you: 
you can tweet using the hashtag#guardianmoscow and of course leave comments 
under our articles. To comment in Russian, emailmoscow.week@theguardian.com 
<mailto:moscow.week@theguardian.com>.


We kick off with a special report. The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Shaun 
Walker, is asking whether the “Moscow Experiment” – the project to open up the 
waterfront, encourage cycling and green space, and generally liven up the city –
is about to come to a crashing halt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/08/is-the-moscow-experiment-over-gorky-park-sergei-kapkov-alexei-navalny>
.

Then at 12pm noon Moscow time (10am in the UK), Shaun will host a live debate 
at the Strelka Institute in the heart of Moscow - which is also doubling as 
Guardian Moscow HQ - asking the very same question: Is the Moscow Experiment 
over?

Also today: Alec Luhn’s exploration of why Moscow’s migrants are fleeing the 
capital, our insider’s cultural guide to Moscow, and the piece everyone in 
Moscow isalready talking about even though we haven’t launched it yet ... who 
made the cut of our 30 Under 30 list of Moscow’s young movers and shakers?


Our crack Guardian Moscow squad - Judith Soal, Maeve Shearlaw, Mark Rice-Oxley 
and myself - will be out taking the pulse of the capital. We’ve already 
doorstepped Roman Abramovich, so things are off to a promising beginning.

He wished us well before security intervened.

In the meantime, however, take a hard look at yourself and ask: how much do 
you REALLY know about the Russian capital?Take our quiz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/08/moscow-quiz-russia-test> and 
tell us how you did. Best result gets a non-monetary prize that is almost 
certain to be disappointing. What’s that hashtag again? That’s right it’s

Thanks for joining us and stay tuned for lots more: we’re live from Moscow all 
day.
