Who is William Onyeabor?
He’s a myth-wreathed Nigerian musician <http://www.williamonyeabor.com/> who 
released eight albums of visionary self-produced synth-funk on his own label 
between 1977 and 1985. Onyeabor gave up recording after becoming a born-again 
Christian, but his previously obscure music began to find a new audience in the 
early years of this century when his incendiary postcolonial anthemBetter 
Change Your Mind <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbV1auSJyq4> cropped up on 
two widely heard compilations. In 2013, after a long struggle to secure the 
artist’s consent, David Byrne’s Luaka Bop label released a best-of album,Who Is 
William Onyeabor? 
<http://luakabop.com/photobio/williamonyeabor/who-is-william-onyeabor.html>, to 
rapturous acclaim from celebrity fans includingCarl Craig 
<http://carlcraig.net/> and (inevitably) Damon Albarn 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlIQGgZLQE>.

How do you pronounce his surname?  US chat-show host Jimmy Fallon went with 
“Ownyabar”, but theNew York Times more plausibly suggests “On-YEA-a-bor”.


What does his music sound like?
Imagine a Nigerian Jonathan Richman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jan/22/10-of-the-best-jonathan-richman>
, only with the minimalist lyrics - “I’m gonna explode… like atomic bomb” - 
endlessly reiterated over an endearingly ramshackle, electro-tinged 
approximation of George McCrae’s disco classicRock Your Baby

 Damon Albarn in Fantastic Man, a film about William Onyeabor 
Why does everyone want to play it?
Well, maybe not everyone, but the all-star Onyeabor tribute band Atomic Bomb! 
<http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/atomic-bomb-92197>, performing at the 
Royal Festival Hall on Thursday as part ofDavid Byrne’s Meltdown 
<http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/festivals-series/david-byrnes-meltdown>
, will include Byrne himself, Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, African close-harmony 
veterans the Mahotella Queens, Beastie Boys affiliate Money Mark and Pat 
Mahoney of LCD Soundsystem.

How did this happen?
As with previous after-the-fact sensations Rodriguez 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyE9vFGKogs> and Lewis Baloue 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3JU8XyCoM>, Onyeabor’s colourful backstory 
(he once studied cinematography in the Soviet Union, and his business interests 
now include a semolina factory in his home town of Enugu) is allied to music 
that delivers a hefty and enduring kick of off-kilter resonance.

What to say if you bump into David Byrne:
“I mean, Onyeabor’s OK, but he’s no Francis Bebey 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bebey>.”

Atomic Bomb! The Music of William Onyeabor 
<http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/atomic-bomb-92197> is at the Royal 
Festival Hall, London SE1 on Thursday
