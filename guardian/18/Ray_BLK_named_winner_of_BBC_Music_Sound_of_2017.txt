<https://www.theguardian.com/music/sam-smith> to become the artist the music 
industry believes will be ordained for greatness this year. Ray said she was 
“honoured” to have topped the list at this stage of her career. “Winning the 
BBC sound of 2017 has to be the most surprising thing that’s happened to me 
thus far,” the musician said.

This year’s longlist primarily showed the burgeoning talent coming out of the 
UK’s rap, soul and grime scene. Ray, who has collaborated with grime starStormzy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy> on My Hood 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhQ_a-DHxk>, her tribute to Catford, south 
London, draws from the likes of Missy Elliott and Timbaland’s textured rap, 
along with R&B and pop.

“I’m particularly proud to be a part of this year’s list, as it’s full of so 
much talent, some of whom are independent artists like myself,” she added, 
“which I really hope inspires the next generation of artists.”

“It’s amazing and well deserved that Ray BLK has won this year’s BBC Music 
Sound of 2017,” said Jamal Edwards, founder ofSB.TV <http://sb.tv/> and an 
early supporter of Ray. “I was blown away when I first watched her perform last 
year. The reaction was brilliant, with everyone raving about her songs, style, 
voice and that she is the whole package. It is a strong start to the year for 
her … and I know she’s going to have an amazing year ahead. I can’t wait to see 
what’s next. She’s something special.”

The BBC Sound of poll started in 2003, with the electronic-fusion artist Jack 
Garrett winning 2016’s poll.
