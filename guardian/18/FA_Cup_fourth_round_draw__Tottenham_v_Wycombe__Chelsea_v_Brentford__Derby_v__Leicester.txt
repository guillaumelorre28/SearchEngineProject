Well that was a bore draw if ever I saw one. The tie of the round? You’re 
guess is as good as mine. Tottenham v Wycombe and Chelsea v Brentford would 
both have been more interesting if the Premier League sides had been drawn 
away, and there is a chance that Bolton could host Manchester City and Norwich 
may welcome Arsenal, but replays could scupper those clashes. I’ll leave you 
with this thought from David in Bristol:

“Could this be FINALLY the time the TV rights holders don’t show Manchester 
United live...? we live in hope”


Thanks for your time. I’m off to work

Here comes the draw. Owen and Keown are grinning in anticipation. Apparently 
little Micky has even brought his mum tonight for moral support. Surely not?

Plymouth’s chief executive is on the mic. He claims to have predicted a 0-0 
draw at Anfield and is confident of victory in the replay. He says Plymouth was 
very quiet this morning after the celebrations of last night.

The draw is being coming live from the home of Sutton United, with four of 
their players lined up in front of a load of rowdy fans to offer their views on 
tonight’s goings on. Andy Lock doesn’t seem impressed though, having emailed me 
with this opinion. Or is it just fact?

“The FA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> draw is a load of 
balls”

Martin Keown and Michael Owen will be pulling out the numbers. Both FA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> winners yes, but entertainers 
they certainly are not. Oh well, at least the draw is not on The One Show any 
more. That really was painful. Did anyone on the planet think that was a good

The lowest side left in this year’s competition are Sutton United, no 
strangers to FA Cup giantkilling of course. They held League One AFC Wimbledon 
to a draw at Gander Green Lane on Saturday. Sutton’s National league rivals 
Lincoln City are the only other non-league side in the draw. Top of English 
football’s fifth tier, the Imps are looking good for a return to the football 
league and will be licking their lips afteroutplaying Ipswich Town at Portman

Preamble

Hello and welcome. The FA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> 
itself may or may not be what it once was, depending on who you talk to, but we 
all still love the draw don’t we. Don’t we? This is where the real magic 
happens. The anticipation, the excitement, and the crushing disappointment when 
you are drawn away to a fellow League Two side four places above you in 14th. 
Romance was hard to come by in the third round this year, until the Pilgrims of 
Plymouth pitched up on the sacred Anfield turf and walked off with a replay. 
They’ll have to go some to beat Jürgen Klopp’s whippersnappers at Home Park, 
but that won’t stop their players doing a spontaneous pile on in the clubhouse 
bar if they draw Manchester United in round four tonight. The TV companies 
would be delighted too – and desperate for Argyle to lose the replay. Oh the 
magic.

The draw begins at: 7.10pm GMT.

Well that was a bore draw if ever I saw one. The tie of the round? You’re 
guess is as good as mine. Tottenham v Wycombe and Chelsea v Brentford would 
both have been more interesting if the Premier League sides had been drawn 
away, and there is a chance that Bolton could host Manchester City and Norwich 
may welcome Arsenal, but replays could scupper those clashes. I’ll leave you 
with this thought from David in Bristol:

“Could this be FINALLY the time the TV rights holders don’t show Manchester 
United live...? we live in hope”


Thanks for your time. I’m off to work

Here comes the draw. Owen and Keown are grinning in anticipation. Apparently 
little Micky has even brought his mum tonight for moral support. Surely not? 
Tough gig this one
 
Plymouth’s chief executive is on the mic. He claims to have predicted a 0-0 
draw at Anfield and is confident of victory in the replay. He says Plymouth was 
very quiet this morning after the celebrations of last night.
 
The draw is being coming live from the home of Sutton United, with four of 
their players lined up in front of a load of rowdy fans to offer their views on 
tonight’s goings on. Andy Lock doesn’t seem impressed though, having emailed me 
with this opinion. Or is it just fact?

“The FA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> draw is a load of 
balls”
 
Martin Keown and Michael Owen will be pulling out the numbers. Both FA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> winners yes, but entertainers 
they certainly are not. Oh well, at least the draw is not on The One Show any 
more. That really was painful. Did anyone on the planet think that was a good 
idea?
 
Managers are often accused of putting pressure on referees before big games, 
but Sutton’s Paul Doswell has taken things a step further, putting pressure on
