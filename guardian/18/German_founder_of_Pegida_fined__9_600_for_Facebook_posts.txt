The founder of the German anti-Islam protest movement Pegida has been hit with 
a €9,600 (£7,600) fine for aFacebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> post branding refugees 
“cattle”, “scum” and “trash”.

A Dresden court on Tuesday ruled that Lutz Bachmann’s posts counted as racial 
incitement since they had stoked hatred against refugees on a public forum.

The state prosecutor had called for a seven-month prison sentence, while 
defence lawyer Katja Reichelt had argued for an acquittal for the 43-year-old, 
claiming that there was no proof that the Facebook account had been public.

The defence team had also claimed there was no proof that the posts had not 
been written by an impersonator, although a video played in court appeared to 
show Bachmann owning up to the comments: “Some screenshots have emerged, which 
were partly altered and shortened, in which I used a few words that we’ve all 
used, I’m sure, in our local pub.”

Bachmann already has a criminal record for a series of offences including 
theft, dealing drugs and drunk-driving.

Pegida, which stands for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the 
West, have been organisingweekly protest marches

 against the German government’s refugee policy in Dresden and other cities 
since September 2014.

After drawing more than 10,000 protesters at one point last year, the number 
of attendees has dropped off more recently.

Bachmann, a trained chef, had resigned from the Pegida leadership in January 
2015 after the emergence of a series of photographs that appeared to show him 
impersonating Hitler, but had continued to speak at the group’s rallies and has 
since been reinstated as one of the organisation’s chairmen.
