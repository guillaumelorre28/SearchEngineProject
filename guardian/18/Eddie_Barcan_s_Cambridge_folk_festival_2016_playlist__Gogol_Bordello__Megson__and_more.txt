Gogol Bordello – Start Wearing Purple


Gogol Bordello shows are always thrilling, and Start Wearing Purple has been a 
favourite for over a decade. I’ve wanted them to play the festival for years; 
it’s going to be wild!

Charles Bradley and His Extraordinaires – Changes

Charles Bradley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/28/charles-bradley-victim-love-review>
 is one of the most charismatic soul singers performing today. He’s survived 
poverty and homelessness and oozes passion with every note, facial expression 
and stage move. His version of Changes brings out emotions you’d never expect 
from a Black Sabbath song.

Songs of Separation – Echo Mocks the Corncrake

Songs of Separation is a special performance by 10 leading female folk 
musicians from Scotland and England, reflecting on the issue of separation in 
its many forms, through traditional song. Celebrating the similarities and 
differences in our musical, linguistic and cultural heritage, and set in the 
context of the referendum and rising prejudice towards immigration, this 
performance is set to be a festival highlight. I’ve also programmed a 
discussion with members of the band, to examine their motivations and messages 
behind the music.

The Mike + Ruthie Band – What Are We Waiting for

Part of the pleasure of programming Cambridge is being able to introduce new 
artists, our audience’s willingness to embrace them, and seeing them go on to 
future success. Bright As You Can went on repeat as soon as I heard it and this 
will be The Mike + Ruthie Band’s first major English appearance.

Megson – Generation Rent

This award-winning Cambridge-based duo, famed for their show for children 
<http://www.megsonmusic.co.uk/contact/family-folk-show/>, took me by surprise 
with the power and political undercurrent on their new album, Good Times Will 
Come Again. As Stu Hanna fed me tracks throughout the recording process, I came 
to realise that it was likely to be their strongest yet and had to include them 
in the lineup.

 * The Cambridge folk festival 
<http://www.cambridgelivetrust.co.uk/folk-festival> runs from 28 – 31 July.
