GOAL! Manchester United 3-1 Sunderland (Borini, 90 mins)

That’s another beauty! A right-wing cross is headed out to Borini, 23 yards

GOAL! Leicester 0-2 Everton (Lukaku, 90+1 mins)

Everton are going to win this one! It’s a long ball out of defence – Barkley I 
think, booting the ball out of his own penalty area – and Lukaku runs round 
Morgan, shrugs off his challenge, cuts inside and sidefoots past Schmeichel.

GOAL! Swansea 1-4 West Ham (Carroll, 90 mins)

Llorente pulled a goal back a couple of minutes ago, but before I can tell you 
about that Carroll meets a looping cross from the right with a crashing 
left-foot volley, and West Ham restore their three-goal cushion.

GOAL! Manchester United 3-0 Sunderland (Mkhitaryan, 86 mins)

That’s a super finish! He was a yard offside, but we’ll overlook that. It’s a 
cross from the right wing, and Mkhitaryan sends a flying backheel volley into 
the far corner! Phwoar! That’s your excuse for watching Match of the Day right 
there! Lovely, lovely goal.
 Henrikh Mkhitaryan scorpion kicks Manchester United into a 3-0 lead.

GOAL! Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland (Ibrahimovic, 82 mins)

That’s nicely done. With the visitors overcommitted in attack Pogba carries 
the ball at an understaffed defence, plays in Ibrahimovic and he waits for the 
keeper to commit himself before curling just inside the far post.

GOAL! Burnley 1-0 Middlesbrough (Gray, 81 mins)

A Victor Valdes howler! Heaton hoists forward a free kick deep inside 
Burnley’s half, Vokes flicks on, and Gray sends in a low first-time shot from 
the edge of the area. It should have been saved, and it looked like it had been 
– only for Valdes to let the ball dribble out of his arms and just inside the 
post!

Cameo of the day: former Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford, who came on for 
Preston against Leeds in the 66th minute, and was sent off for kicking someone 
in the face a little under three minutes later. It was his first appearance 
since 3 December, when he was sent off against Preston.

“If you offered Pulis 38 nil-nils at the start of the season he’d take your 
hand off,” says Sean Doyle. He remains on course for one this afternoon, and – 
pertinently – the game is currently being delayed while an obviously 
not-seriously-hurt Baggie receives treatment.

Great chance for Bournemouth! Wilshere, who’s been superb, plays in Afobe, but 
instead of chipping the keeper, or shooting wide to his right, the shot is low 
and too close to Courtois, who saves.

“I’m not having this post-truth world we are entering and will fight for facts 
at every opportunity,” counters JR. “It is absolutely no herring of any colour 
to say that the Baggies under Pulis engage in an absurd amount of time wasting. 
It is a fact that anyone who watches them play knows, and I say this as a 
Baggies fan.” I believe JR: if there’s a way of defunnifying football, Pulis 
will probably encourage his teams to do it.

GOAL! Leicester 0-1 Everton (Mirallas, 51 mins)

Everton, who haven’t won away since September – and that was at Sunderland, 
who were basically a vending machine for points at the time, so doesn’t really 
count – are winning away!
 Everton’s Kevin Mirallas slots home to give the visitors the lead.

Meanwhile this, from Charles Antaki: “I’ve not seen the latest David 
Attenborough series, but if the producers were looking for 45 minutes of an 
octopus – not a very creative octopus – pummelling away at a jellyfish, they 
could use footage from the first half of Arsenal-WBA. Not great telly, but 
nature is after all sometimes dull.”

“To be fair to Arsenal fans: I live in N5, I’m not from London and I’m at the 
Emirates on the boss’s Club Level seats as I normally go to the Etihad,” writes 
Alex Sargent. “Point is, this isn’t a part of London that sees people coming 
back for Christmas, it’s one where people aren’t here. Most of my Arsenal 
ticket-holding friends are elsewhere visiting in-laws and can’t get here. So, 
in my view, it’s not as apathetic as the Mirror man thinks. Oh and WBA 
certainly here for nil each.”

This from the Mirror’s man at Arsenal suggests it’s a theme:
John Cross (@johncrossmirror) 
0-0 at half time at the Emirates. A lot of empty seats here. The modern fan's 
apathy. To be honest, they're not missing much. Awful.

“Time wasting by West Brom is a blue and white striped herring,” writes Roy 
Allen as the players at the Emirates go in for half-time with the score at 0-0. 
“We all know what Pulis is going to do: he’s going to play a narrow back four 
with wingbacks as fullbacks and three midfielders in front. A back nine. That’s 
what’s happening. Arsenal have to do more than faff around in front of them. 
They need to play at pace, play vertical passes, take risks, take people on. 
Endless square passes in front of Pulis’s masses ain’t going to cut it. It just 
makes bus-parking easy.”

GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Sunderland (Blind, 39 mins)

Just recovering from a minor technical issue, so I can’t tell you much about 
this goal other than that it happened a few minutes ago, and was apparently 
good.

“About 30 minutes in and West Brom are looking in imperious time wasting 
form,” writes JR, who is watching the action from Arsenal. “Dawson and Foster 
in particular are dominating possession averaging about 15 seconds at every 
dead ball. Yacob has chipped in by sitting down with a pretend injury. Neil 
Swarbrick doesn’t seem to care so the Baggies may have a chance at really 
shortening the game and escaping with a 0-0.”

Sock change! Islam Slimani calls on the physio, his problem eventually solved 
by him taking off his socks, revealing the fact that he was wearing more socks 
under his socks, and then donning a new pair of secondary socks over those 
socks.

Bournemouth are playing well at Stamford Bridge, though. Jack Wilshere just 
went close, and a penalty appeal, following Matic’s challenge on Smith, has 
been turned down.

Eden Hazard Rabona alert! The ball rolls to the Belgian 20 yards from goal and 
he sends a 20-yard rabona towards the top corner! It’s tipped round the post, 
and the whistle had already gone for a Bournemouth free-kick, but still.

GOAL! Manchester United 3-1 Sunderland (Borini, 90 mins)

That’s another beauty! A right-wing cross is headed out to Borini, 23 yards 
from goal, who chests down and volleys perfectly into the top corner! Lovely!
 
GOAL! Chelsea 3-0 Bournemouth (Pedro, 90 mins)

Pedro’s shot from the edge of the area is deflected, and dribbles past a 
wrong-footed goalkeeper.

Cook, right. Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters  
GOAL! Leicester 0-2 Everton (Lukaku, 90+1 mins)

Everton are going to win this one! It’s a long ball out of defence – Barkley I 
think, booting the ball out of his own penalty area – and Lukaku runs round 
Morgan, shrugs off his challenge, cuts inside and sidefoots past Schmeichel.

GOAL! Swansea 1-4 West Ham (Carroll, 90 mins)

Llorente pulled a goal back a couple of minutes ago, but before I can tell you 
about that Carroll meets a looping cross from the right with a crashing 
left-foot volley, and West Ham restore their three-goal cushion.

GOAL! Manchester United 3-0 Sunderland (Mkhitaryan, 86 mins)

That’s a super finish! He was a yard offside, but we’ll overlook that. It’s a 
cross from the right wing, and Mkhitaryan sends a flying backheel volley into 
the far corner! Phwoar! That’s your excuse for watching Match of the Day right 
there! Lovely, lovely goal.

GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 West Brom (Giroud, 86 mins)

West Brom hold out until five minutes from the final whistle, but that’s where 
their luck/organisation/time-wasting ends!

GOAL! Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland (Ibrahimovic, 82 mins)

That’s nicely done. With the visitors overcommitted in attack Pogba carries 
the ball at an understaffed defence, plays in Ibrahimovic and he waits for the 
keeper to commit himself before curling just inside the far post.

GOAL! Burnley 1-0 Middlesbrough (Gray, 81 mins)

A Victor Valdes howler! Heaton hoists forward a free kick deep inside 
Burnley’s half, Vokes flicks on, and Gray sends in a low first-time shot from 
the edge of the area. It should have been saved, and it looked like it had been 
– only for Valdes to let the ball dribble out of his arms and just inside the 
post!

Cameo of the day: former Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford, who came on for 
Preston against Leeds in the 66th minute, and was sent off for kicking someone 
in the face a little under three minutes later. It was his first appearance 
since 3 December, when he was sent off against Preston.
 
GOAL! Swansea 0-3 West Ham (Antonio, 78 mins)

A tap-in for Antonio, who is all alone in the penalty area when a wayward 
long-range shot flies to his feet, and he pokes it into the net.

“If you offered Pulis 38 nil-nils at the start of the season he’d take your 
hand off,” says Sean Doyle. He remains on course for one this afternoon, and – 
pertinently – the game is currently being delayed while an obviously 
not-seriously-hurt Baggie receives treatment.
 
Great chance for Bournemouth! Wilshere, who’s been superb, plays in Afobe, but 
instead of chipping the keeper, or shooting wide to his right, the shot is low 
and too close to Courtois, who saves.
 
Reading have taken a 2-1 lead against Norwich in the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship>. Norwich have also had 
Jonny Howson sent off, conceding a penalty which is Panenkaed into the 
crossbar, bounces down and is lashed in by Garath McCleary.
 
Twenty minutes to play, an for someone to give the world a genuinely 
compelling reason to spend their Boxing Day evening watching Match of the Day.
 
Leicester have also made use of their substitutes: Mahrez and Ulloa have just 
come on, and the latter had a half-decent chance to score with his first touch, 
but Robles catches his header.
 
Henrik Mkhitaryan is back: José Mourinho has just brought him on, to replace 
Jesse Lingard.
 
Oooh! Victor Moses has a shot from just outside the penalty area, but it 
fizzes just wide of the post.
 
“I’m not having this post-truth world we are entering and will fight for facts 
at every opportunity,” counters JR. “It is absolutely no herring of any colour 
to say that the Baggies under Pulis engage in an absurd amount of time wasting. 
It is a fact that anyone who watches them play knows, and I say this as a 
Baggies fan.” I believe JR: if there’s a way of defunnifying football, Pulis 
will probably encourage his teams to do it.
 
GOAL! Leicester 0-1 Everton (Mirallas, 51 mins)

Everton, who haven’t won away since September – and that was at Sunderland, 
who were basically a vending machine for points at the time, so doesn’t really 
count – are winning away!

Payet’s corner is headed in by Reid at the near post, and Swansea are two 
goals down.
 
GOAL! Chelsea 2-0 Bournemouth (Hazard, 49 mins)

Hazard, who is on his way to another man of the match award (Wilshere having 
been the key competition in the first half), rolls in the league leaders’ 
second goal.

Plymouth are now 2-1 up against Wycombe, where they’re only just in first-half 
stoppage time.
 
Meanwhile this, from Charles Antaki: “I’ve not seen the latest David 
Attenborough series, but if the producers were looking for 45 minutes of an 
octopus – not a very creative octopus – pummelling away at a jellyfish, they 
could use footage from the first half of Arsenal-WBA. Not great telly, but 
nature is after all sometimes dull.”

 
“To be fair to Arsenal fans: I live in N5, I’m not from London and I’m at the 
Emirates on the boss’s Club Level seats as I normally go to the Etihad,” writes 
Alex Sargent. “Point is, this isn’t a part of London that sees people coming 
back for Christmas, it’s one where people aren’t here. Most of my Arsenal 
ticket-holding friends are elsewhere visiting in-laws and can’t get here. So, 
in my view, it’s not as apathetic as the Mirror man thinks. Oh and WBA 
certainly here for nil each.”
 
“How do you know they’re secondary socks? Perhaps they’re tertiary, or even 
quaternary,” writes Stephen Colwill. This is true. Slimani could be wearing any 
number of socks.
 
The battle of the bottom two in the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> seems settled before the 
break: Rotherham have just gone 3-0 up against Wigan.
 
This from the Mirror’s man at Arsenal suggests it’s a theme:
John Cross (@johncrossmirror) 
0-0 at half time at the Emirates. A lot of empty seats here. The modern fan's 
apathy. To be honest, they're not missing much. Awful.

Our man in Leicester is not feeling entertained.
Paul Doyle (@Paul_Doyle) 
Leicester 0-0 Everton. A late but compelling entry for the worst half of 
football in 2016.
 <https://twitter.com/Paul_Doyle/status/813410923348185088> December 26, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/Paul_Doyle/status/813410923348185088>  
“Time wasting by West Brom is a blue and white striped herring,” writes Roy 
Allen as the players at the Emirates go in for half-time with the score at 0-0. 
“We all know what Pulis is going to do: he’s going to play a narrow back four 
with wingbacks as fullbacks and three midfielders in front. A back nine. That’s 
what’s happening. Arsenal have to do more than faff around in front of them. 
They need to play at pace, play vertical passes, take risks, take people on. 
Endless square passes in front of Pulis’s masses ain’t going to cut it. It just 
makes bus-parking easy.”

 
GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Sunderland (Blind, 39 mins)

Just recovering from a minor technical issue, so I can’t tell you much about 
this goal other than that it happened a few minutes ago, and was apparently 
good.

Sunderland to score the opening goal at Old Trafford. Photograph: Gareth

From a short free-kick Burnley’s Boyd slams a piledriver goalwards, but it’s 
pushed away.
 
In the big game in League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball>, it’s now Plymouth 1-1 
Wycombe. Jordan Slew has scored the goal.
 
“About 30 minutes in and West Brom are looking in imperious time wasting 
form,” writes JR, who is watching the action from Arsenal. “Dawson and Foster 
in particular are dominating possession averaging about 15 seconds at every 
dead ball. Yacob has chipped in by sitting down with a pretend injury. Neil 
Swarbrick doesn’t seem to care so the Baggies may have a chance at really 
shortening the game and escaping with a 0-0.”
 
Sock change! Islam Slimani calls on the physio, his problem eventually solved 
by him taking off his socks, revealing the fact that he was wearing more socks 
under his socks, and then donning a new pair of secondary socks over those 
socks.
 
Bournemouth are playing well at Stamford Bridge, though. Jack Wilshere just 
went close, and a penalty appeal, following Matic’s challenge on Smith, has 
been turned down.
 
Eden Hazard Rabona alert! The ball rolls to the Belgian 20 yards from goal and 
he sends a 20-yard rabona towards the top corner! It’s tipped round the post, 
and the whistle had already gone for a Bournemouth free-kick, but still.
