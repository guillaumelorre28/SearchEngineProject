Sliding deadlines for safety improvements following the Rana Plaza disaster 
demonstrate why the Bangladesh government must act (Bangladeshi workers still 
in danger despite safety pledges, says report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/bangladesh-garment-factories-safety-alliance-rana-plaza-report>
, 21 November).

Rana Plaza made the potentially deadly conditions in garment factories 
impossible to ignore. Safety improvements promoted by retailers have brought 
some positive changes but, given the scale of the problem inBangladesh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/bangladesh>, these cannot tackle the root of 
the problem on their own, and they are not exclusive to garment factories – so 
what about other sectors?

Basic safety measures such as fire escapes should be emphasised (and brands 
need to invest), but if Bangladesh truly wants to help the women who labour in 
the factories it must think bigger and longer term to find sustainable 
solutions. Key to this will be diversifying the economy to create better jobs 
and strengthen workers’ rights so that women have more job options for a better 
future, and employers compete to attract workers by offering the best 
conditions.
