Ghana’s main opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo has won the presidency in his 
third run for the office.

State broadcaster Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ghana> Television 
said on Friday that the president, John Mahama, had conceded defeat in a 
telephone call that Akufo-Addo confirmed soon after.

“A few minutes ago, I received a call from President @JDMahama congratulating 
me on winning the 2016 Presidential Election,” he tweeted.

The country’s election commission said Akufo-Addo received 53.8% of the vote, 
with Mahama on 44.4%.

Mahama became president in July 2012 after the sudden death of the incumbent 
leader and was elected later in the year.


Before Wednesday’s election, the opposition had emphasised Ghana’s high 
unemployment levels and underperforming GDP growth rates

 to appeal to frustrated voters.

Mahama defended his record, hingeing his campaign on plans to boost economic 
growth and continue modest gains in infrastructure development.

A change in government, he said, would reverse the progress made over the past 
four years.

Elections in Ghana have been peaceful since the country moved from military 
rule to democracy in 1992.
