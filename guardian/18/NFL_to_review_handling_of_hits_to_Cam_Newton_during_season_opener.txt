The NFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> will review how the Panthers’ 
medical team handled a hit to Cam Newton’s head during Carolina’s loss to the 
Denver Broncos in the season opener.

The league said Sunday that it wants to ensure the concussion protocol is 
being “uniformly applied across all 32 teams.” So along with the players’ 
association, the NFL will review “the relevant documents and video and 
interview the involved parties.”

Newton took several hard hits in Thursday night’s game, including one after 
which he appeared woozy. The union has questioned why Newton didn’t undergo a 
cognitive exam on the sideline during the game.

The Broncos were only penalized once for a number of helmet-to-helmet hits on 
Newton, something that disturbed the quarterback’s father. “It starts with the 
guys who control the behavior on the field,”Cecil Newton told ESPN on Friday

. “I think the culprit is the mere fact that they allowed the game to get out 
of control. They allowed players to push the envelope to the very edge. That’s 
my ultimate concern. Whether [the NFL] want to go after them or not, fine. But 
I’m thinking about Cam Newton being healthy today, tomorrow and 25 or 35 years 
from now.”

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy reiterated in his statement Sunday that this 
review “does not mean that we have seen any evidence that the protocol was 
applied improperly, but simply reflects our obligation to ensure the health and 
safety of our players.”
