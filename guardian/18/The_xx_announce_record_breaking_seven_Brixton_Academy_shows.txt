Though the band could probably have played a couple of nights at the giant O2 
Arena instead, “doing Brixtons” has long been considered a mark of status for 
artists. Among those to have played five consecutive nights at the south London 
venue are Rammstein, Nine Inch Nails, Hard-Fi and the Prodigy. Comedians the 
Mighty Boosh played seven nights there in 1998.

The xx’s UK tour in March takes in arena shows in Nottingham (4 March), 
Cardiff (17 March) and two nights at Manchester Apollo (March 5,6) as well as 
the seven-night Brixton run. They release their new album,I See You, on 13 
January.
