Fears of a British exit from the European Union are adding to the list of 
concerns causing turbulence on global financial markets, the IMF’s managing 
directorChristine Lagarde <https://www.theguardian.com/world/christine-lagarde> 
said on Saturday.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> she called for a swift deal that 
would ensure the UK could remain in the EU, for the good of the European and 
world economies.

The comments came after a volatile week which saw sharp falls in world 
markets, triggered in part by concerns over a slowdown in the Chinese economy 
and uncertainty about the impact of the fall in the price of oil. On Wednesday, 
the FTSE index fell to its lowest level in more than three years, before 
recovering some ground later.

Lagarde said Europe’s overall economic outlook had improved recently and that 
she expected global growth this year to be 3.4%, up from 3.1% in 2015. However, 
she had two big concerns – a possible British exit from the EU and the threat of
 a collapse of the Schengen passport-free travel

 agreement under the weight of refugees.

With regard to “Brexit”,  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/brexit-what-would-happen-if-britain-left-eu-european-union-referendum-uk>
she said her worry was “whether there is a deal to be had between the United 
Kingdom and other members of the European Union, which we hope very much 
because it would really be conducive to more stability and more a cohesive 
economic zone”.

She agreed with those warning that the refugee crisis could “make or break” 
the EU’s Schengen agreement. Failure to handle the crisis could put the 
arrangement, seen as an essential element of the single market, at risk. 
However, Lagarde told a panel inDavos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> that a proper strategy and policy 
on how to manage the new pool of labour could add around 0.2 percentage points 
to growth across the eurozone.

Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP and member of the Commons Treasury select 
committee, says any prolonged global downturn could have a serious impact on 
the UK economy, and particularly George Osborne’s deficit-cutting strategy. 
Writing ontheguardian.com 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/23/british-economy-too-reliant-financial-services-osborne>
, Reeves warns that George Osborne’s plan risks being blown off course, raising 
the possibility of more cuts or tax increases.

Citing recent calculations by the Office for Budget Responsibility, Reeves 
says a failure to rebalance the UK economy has placed it more at risk. “A 
surplus of more than £5bn would now be needed in the final quarter of this 
financial year to meet the chancellor’s targets. If that surplus doesn’t 
materialise, that means even more cuts and tax increases or further drift in 
the deficit reduction plans - already extended by five years.”

She also ridicules Osborne’s claim in his autumn statement in November that 
the good times were returning. “Just two months ago Osborne used his autumn 
statement to boast about the ‘improvement in the public finances’ that allowed 
him to U-turn on unpopular cuts to tax credits and policing while delivering a 
plan that would leave Britain ‘ready for whatever storms lie ahead’. It is 
extraordinary how quickly those words have come to seem so incredibly 
complacent.”

Osborne, also in Davos, said he was confident of an EU deal. “There is 
goodwill out there with the other member states, and the institutions of the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. We’ve now got to make it 
happen,” he said.
