HOW TO WIN UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE

By Ted Loveday, University Challenge winner, 2015

Memorise your US states. Prepare some sassy comebacks for Paxman’s insults. 
Practise saying “Rachmaninov” in the mirror until it rolls off your tongue. 
Buzzer reaction speeds are key! Learn from Russia’s Olympians by doping up on 
six espressos before going on air. Or try adopting a longer surname, like 
“Drnovsek-Zorko”. You’ll gain crucial seconds to think. Finally, stock up on 
knitwear. It’ll itch, but granny will be so proud when her cardigan’s trending 
on Twitter.

It’s hideous isn’t it, the yearning to be liked? No matter how many people 
thumbed hearts on your recent Insta-selfie, it still feels hard to make new 
actual real-life mates. If you are feeling like it’s a hopeless mission to find 
someone like you, someone that’s into what you’re into, someone that will 
accept your every quirk, it’s time to shake a little. So hunt like you are 
searching for Pokémon and sniff out your flavour of ‘freaks’ in every corner, 
whether it’s signing up to the Fencing Society, or galvanising everyone in your 
halls to start watching a Scrubs boxset. You never know, you might end up being 
best mates with that person who keeps leaving their pubes in the shower.

Toolkit To How Magic And Messed Up Life Can Be, is available to pre-order now

HOW TO PULL OFF BEING FASHIONABLE

By Priya Elan, writer

Look, none of us saw this one coming: dressing for now is about looking like a 
football fan from the 80s. The trend of athleisure shows no sign of letting up 
and has even gone into its second iteration: splicing up bits of a smart look 
with a posh jogging bottom or a high-end-look hoodie with some sensible pants. 
There’s also a market for retro tracksuits (think: Ray Liotta in Goodfellas) 
paired with, say, some reissued Gazelles. Just don’t let anyone tell you you 
look like Loadsamoney.

 Mmm. Shakshuka. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian  Yotam Ottolenghi.
Hangover food is all about eggs. Braised, if possible, in a tomato sauce. 
Shakshuka is the ultimate for mopping up sore heads 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/19/yotam-ottolenghi-breakfast-recipe-shakshuka>
. Make a big batch of the sauce in advance: diced red pepper and onions in a 
pan for a long slow cook with a couple of cans of tomatoes, some ground cumin, 
a pinch of cayenne or some chopped red chilli – and then you are all set to go. 
Add the sauce to your pan, make however many wells you want for the eggs (four 
or five works well for two people) and use a fork to whirl the white of the egg 
through the sauce. Braise on a low heat with the pan covered until the whites 
are just set and the yolk still has a wobble. Serve as it is, with some crusty 
white bread. You can also tailor the sauce on the day with whatever you have 
around: the salt from some chunks of fried bacon are sometimes a must. Chopped 
parsley or coriander also adds requisite green if your body is crying out for 
it.

HOW TO KNOW WHETHER TO DROP OUT

By Laura Snapes, writer

University is not always the time of your life – and that’s OK. Lowered 
expectations are generally a decent survival technique, though it’s vital to 
recognise when everyday crapness becomes untenable: a disappointing course, 
crushing mental health or hunger for life beyond nursing off Wetherspoons’ 
midweek drinks deals at 9am lectures. Your parents will freak when you quit, 
but tell them that companies are increasingly dropping degree requirements for 
job applicants. And, besides, you can always go back as a mature student (when 
it’ll be so expensive, you’ll make better choices anyway).

 Owen Jones. 
Starting a revolution is both an excellent hangover cure and a convenient 
distraction from the library. It doesn’t mean spending the afternoon shelling 
the Palace of Westminster. But joining a living wage campaign for university 
cleaners, getting involved in a single-issue group on, say, tax justice or 
racism, or signing up to a political party (cough, except the Tories or Ukip, 
cough) – these can all help create a peaceful revolution to change society. A 
skilfully crafted placard – featuring such classics as “I wish my boyfriend was 
as dirty as your policies” or “What do we want? Things to be better! When do we 
want it? Within a reasonable timeframe!” – is a must. Politicians think they 
can screw over young people because they won’t fight back, so remember to shout 
very loudly so that they get the point. Bring a determined scowl and a sage 
nod. Radical change – and nobody gets shot.

HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH ALL THE MUSIC GENRES YOU TOLD EVERYONE IN 
FRESHERS’ WEEK YOU’RE INTO

By Joe Bish, writer

WOMBCORE Heads up: goth is back, but it’s now really sad and feminist, and let 
me tell you, being sad and feminist is very in vogue now. Think Jenny Hval and 
Julia Holter having a tea watching the rain. That moody person you fancy will 
love it.
DRUG SINGING It’s like Gregorian chanting, but instead of monks it’s the 
Weeknd and Future crooning about their purple drank addictions.
GRIME You’ve seen Stormzy on about three Subway adverts and now it’s time to 
find out who he is. Get some AJ Tracey and un-Googleable rapper Dave down you 
to stay ahead of the curve.
TROPICAL GLOOM The new kings of house like Duke Dumont will have you weeping 
at your desk as their sunny upbeat dance hits remind you of the holiday you’ll 
never have.

Tell them to brush their teeth! I’d give someone three chances. If they’re 
still messing around or being loud too much, not cleaning up or leaving their 
dirty underwear all over the place, I’d just tell them: “You’re on your bike!” 
I’m obsessed with salmon, and if I came back and someone had my salmon out of 
the fridge, I’d go mad. There wouldn’t be no fun and games if you can’t behave 
when it comes to salmon. 

HOW TO START A BIZARRE SOCIETY

By Owen Todd, secretary of the Viking Society, University of Plymouth

Make sure there’s enough interest in what you’re doing, but no matter how 
out-there your idea seems, a few people will be into it. And check that the 
society doesn’t already exist. Try to grab people’s attention. At Freshers’ 
Fair, we have costumes, swords and walk around campus “hassling” people. As for 
running the society, I’d say having regular meetings with the committee is a 
must. If you aren’t all on the same page, things fall apart pretty quickly.

 Nish Kumar. 
I started doing comedy at university, in the Durham Revue. In 2006 we did a 
show at the Edinburgh Fringe which one critic described as “not as bad as I’d 
expected”. This led me to take up stand-up comedy, which is now my job. Here 
are five tips on getting started as a student.

1. Audition – if there is a group, then great! Go along to auditions. If you 
don’t get in, go again. Refuse to take a hint.
2. If there isn’t a group, set one up. My friends started a night at a local 
pub, which is where I did my first standup gig. So if you hate my comedy it’s 
their fault.
3. Experiment. Feel free to be terrible. Due to the vast quantities of alcohol 
students consume, no one will remember.
4. Get yourself to the fringe. It’s the best place to learn. 
5. DO IT.

Always bribe the judges with alcohol. Once they’ve had a few beers and your 
guitars are tuned, practice blaming the bass player for anyone else’s mistakes. 
You’ve got to look the part, so wear tons of leather and be sure to get 
matching haircuts. If all else fails, learn the arts of distraction and 
sabotage. Keep puns to a minimum and keep your clothes on. Finish on an Oasis 
song. 

By Theo from Wolf Alice

Solely rely on your bands look. In our Instagram reliant age, your “swag” is 
elementary. Skechers are a great starting point as they’re a timeless shoe. 
Some spray on skinnies are another “indie essential”essential. Yellow or red 
are my legging of choice. Your torso should always be adorned by either a 
draping faux retro shirt and or band t-shirt (doesn’t matter if you don’t 
listen to the band you’re representing). Finish the look with a classique Jack 
Sparrow fedora. This will signify you as a musical era crossing vagabond. If 
you follow these effective and concise style tips you will be snapped up by 
every indie A&R for at least a three-month contract.

Make sure to turn up any music or television you are listening to so your 
neighbours can enjoy it, too. Likewise, it’s always good to make as much noise 
when walking around your flat just to let them know you are in; nobody likes to 
be lonely, after all! If they have pets, take them and house them for a 
fortnight or so: after grieving over their assumed deaths, they’ll get a 
wonderful feeling when you give them back. This ideal neighbourly system of 
entertainment, inspiration and surprise has left many of mine desperate to 
share it with others by moving out immediately.

HOW TO HAVE A NIGHT OUT FOR FREE

By Alexi Duggins, writer

As Rihanna once sang, if you want a cheap night out, you have to “work, work, 
work, work, work, work”. Or, at least, you have to pretend to. Set up an 
Insta/Snapchat for culture/food/drink containing a few artsy photos of your 
dinner, cuppa or pet pug and – hey presto! – you’re in for evenings spent 
blagging freebie drinks/gig tickets/pointlessly trendy meals of avocado on 
toast. Soon you’ll be swimming in so much complementary booze that all you’ll 
be capable of is slurring incomprehensibly. For which, you may also see the 
lyrics of Rihanna’s Work.

The best advice I ever received on this was: make a club that you and your 
closest mates would love and consider every minute detail of what that means. 
Be as niche as you want to be and think small. Work on getting an amazing 
poster rather than a finding a DJ who can mix. If you make something that is 
true to you then like-minded people will naturally find it. Don’t worry about 
appealing to the masses on campus; most of them are idiots who want to roll 
about to the Baywatch theme tune. If the lads in the pub golf costumes hate it, 
then you’re probably on to something.

HOW TO NOT DIE

By Luke Holland, writer

The odd apple – as opposed to a Pringle and a fag – will prevent your immune 
system moving back home to your parents’. Making a brew with a teaspoon so rank 
it looks like a dog’s foot will make you ill. Use condoms, otherwise STIs will 
basically cause your personal contemplation area to explode. Oh, and don’t 
become a daredevil drunk. Imagine your family, weeping before a gravestone that 
reads: “Died as they lived: acting like an arse.”

1. Don’t rely on dating apps
Tinder, Happn, Grindr: all great ways to avoid your dissertation, sure, but 
don’t forget The Real World. You’ve only got a few years to make the most of 
uni, so save the apps for later. Think of campus as one giant Tinder!

2. Do date someone who cooks 
…because date night may be the best meal you get all week. And don’t forget to 
demonstrate your own value. Throw parties. Decorate your communal space with 
vibrant colours (and if you take that to mean dyeing your pubic hair lavender, 
so be it). Basically, be a person that people want to be around, and you’ll 
never want for admirers.

3. Do be aware of proximity
If you live in a shared house, it’s best not to fall for the person in the 
room directly beneath yours. If things go wrong between you, you’ll have to 
spend the next few terms playing Adele to drown out the sound of them having 
sex with better-looking people. No one wants a year of Adele on full blast. See 
also: don’t date your housemate’s exes. Seriously, what are you, a masochist?

4. Do be careful sharing photos on phone apps
There isn’t a Snapchat filter on Earth that’ll make you feel better when your 
private parts end up the subject of a WhatsApp group discussion with the 
bellends from media studies. You may not care that much now, but spare a 
thought for future you. Spoiler: Future you is not impressed.

5. Don’t settle down too quickly
Love is lovely, but don’t stress about meeting The One. If you’re ever going 
to have a wild phase, this is it. Uni is for experimenting and having fun and 
finding yourself, sometimes in other people’s beds. Just try not to get a 
disease? They’re called “condoms”.

Freshers week is chaos. I didn’t make many friends in the halls I was staying 
in, I made friends with some people who lived in another halls of residence, so 
I decided to move to that one with them. For the rest of my time in university 
they became my best friends and housemates. The only downside was they all 
happened to be English lit students and I was an architecture student. Two very 
different endeavours! English students tend to binge-write before deadlines 
whereas architecture requires constant legwork and concentration. So try to 
find people to live with who might keep the same hours as you and share the 
same work ethic. Given how the Tory Baby Boomers have messed up your future, 
you’re gonna need that 2:1.

I find networking quite cringey. People feel like they need to sell themselves 
and it’s not about selling yourself. If you bump into whoever – a massive DJ 
that you’re a fan of – you don’t have to sell themselves to them. We call it 
bred: a word you say when you’re bredding something; you don’t have to beg to 
be a part of something. Your confidence in who you are will get you to that 
place you want to be. It’s about being confident that you’re proficient enough 
to get what you want and those people around you all the time will see that. 
But also, be a good representation of yourself. I bump into people and think: 
“You’re the guy that’s always vomiting outside the club at six o’clock in the 
morning.” Carrying yourself well, especially as a female, is important. Be 
everywhere, be comfortable everywhere, and be you everywhere. Don’t go to 
certain places and feel like you have to put on an image or vibe to fit in. Be 
cool being who you are.

HOW TO CONVINCE YOUR PARENTS EVERYTHING’S FINE

By Anna Fabric, writer

You might not have slept for days and be living off tinned fry-ups but you can 
still fool the fam that, yes, you are attending even the boring lectures and, 
no, you haven’t contracted scurvy. Don’t WhatsApp them at 3am. Send emails that 
are longer than two lines and include a question; feign interest. As long as 
you get a haircut and hide any unsightly sexual partners before they come to 
visit, you’ll have no problem convincing them you are a functioning human 
making excellent life choices.

Student jobs can be v v yawn, so here are a few that are v v yeah!:

Cool job Student cookbook writer.
Describe it, yo! Write a funky Cook-B for your fellow studes! Students like it 
weird and topsy-turvy so bung a couple of left steers in there (feel free to 
funk up your type styles too!). Examples: ToAzT oN BeAnZ! or CRISPZ & WATER! or 
ChiCk£n & SweEtcorN & poo sarnie!

Cool job Getting the alcohol out of students’ mouths.
Describe it, yo! Students are paid £40 an hour by the university to steal the 
alcohol out of their brightest students’ mouths to ensure they stay focused on 
their subject of study! Eg Maths.

Cool job Cafe.
Describe it, yo! Work in a cafe as a chef or a waiter!!! 

HOW NOT TO ANNOY THE LOCALS

By Harriet Gibsone, writer

Learn the local lingo: bus phrases like “single to south square please”. Do 
the local limbo: when a local walks by, shimmy aggressively to show approval. 
Don’t wear gratuitous fancy dress in public unless you’re volunteering as the 
gratuitous local mascot. If you’re sick in a park call the police so locals 
don’t step on it. Two key sayings regarding student cliches: road signs remain, 
bog roll belongs. Don’t steal their stuff. Work so hard you pass your degree 
two years early. Leave.

Lower people’s expectations In order to impress your peers sufficiently enough 
for them to want to “take part” in your “scene”, they must first be convinced 
of your all-encompassing irrelevance, at which point singing vaguely in tune or 
being able to organise a “night” suddenly seem like minor miracles. The lower 
they think of you, the better you are.

Establish a common source of villainy This will encourage people to step 
beyond the tepid narrative of constructive argument: listening, dialogue, 
tolerance, etc. These things are old hat. What folks are after now is somewhere 
convenient to store all of the hatred they can’t quite take out on their 
families and “loved ones”.

Find a suitably despicable location You’ve spent enough time banging on about 
the evils of gentrification to know how it works. For those with limited means 
but cumbersome levels of social ambition, the only option is the colonisation of
 some misspent part of town where folks will let you plough your crappy wares 
for nothing out of sheer boredom. Affordability and integrity walk hand in hand.

Recruit followers For a scene to work, you need a “group” or “team” or “gang”. 
Should you have the requisite intelligence to bother embarking on this quest in 
the first place then have faith in your abilities, and that those around you 
will soak up your vision. You need the hopeless, the washed-up or the utterly 
naive to be your pawns. The more putty-like their minds, the easier their 
loyalty is to inspire.

Spread the word Even if your message is rooted in nothing but 
self-aggrandisement and nihilism, your “scene” must make those who partake in 
it feel “active’” If that involves throwing a spontaneous street party to 
celebrate the death of an old woman [as the Fat Whites were pictured doing in 
2013 when Margaret Thatcher died], so be it. It’s impossible for people to 
write about inaction.

The causes of hangovers are poorly understood, despite the number of 
scientists and doctors that begin the working day with one. There seem to be a 
few things at work: gastric irritation; the effects of the acetaldehyde (the 
main breakdown product of alcohol), which is extremely toxic; tiredness. 
Perhaps least understood is how much alcohol is lovely and soothing for your 
brain – like it’s having a soak in a nice hot bath with candles and rose 
petals. Because it’s relaxing in the booze, your brain seems to make a lot less 
of the chemicals that it usually makes to help soothe itself. This is a 
problem, because when the alcohol goes away, it’s like you’re suddenly taken 
out of a hot bath and plunged into a freezing lake of sewage. There’s none of 
those nice calming neurotransmitters around. They’re taking a break. All the 
sweaty, anxious, paranoid, palpitations, dry mouth dry eyes stuff – that’s 
probably all happening in your brain. It’s not dehydration. Unless you did a 
lot of dancing. So by all means have a pint of squash and take some 
painkillers, but what you really need for your jangled brain is pleasure. Sex, 
food, TV, or ideally a combination of all three. Ideally in large quantities.

Hey!!! For some reason people think leaving notes in the kitchen is passive 
aggressive, so I just wanted you to know that taking food from the fridge you 
definitely haven’t paid for is totally fine!!!

Ivo Graham
Dearest housemates,

Enjoying your young romantic lives is all well and good, but if it could be a 
little bit more of the whispering missionaries and a little bit less of the 
barking dogs, that would be greatly appreciated over on this side of the wall.

Yours jealously, Ivo. 

Dane Baptiste
GENERAL MESSAGE TO HOUSEMATES NOTICE: As well as enjoying my orange juice 
without bits, I also enjoy crushing horse laxatives into my drinks as a theft 
deterrent. But you’ll learn that soon enough. Enjoy.

Joel Dommett
To the person who keeps stealing my passive aggressive fridge notes – please 
continue to do so because I bloody love writing passive aggressive fridge notes.
