Travel group Tui is proving popular in a downbeat market.

The company’s shares have risen 10p to £11.72 following a report it could be 
considering a break-up, as well as a positive broker note after last week’s 
figures.

Tui is considering a spin-off of some non-core assets with turnover of around 
€3bn,the Times reported (£)

, including hotelbeds.com, Crystal Ski Holidayis and Hayes & Jarvis.

Meanwhile Deutsche Bank issued a buy note with a target price raised from 
£12.35 to £13.85:

The raised guidance and results have led us to upgrade our forecasts by 9% for 
2015 and beyond. The improved blend of profits drives a 12% increase in our 
target price, with 20% upside to our base case and 39% to our bull case.

The company was created last year when London-listed Tui Travel

company Tui AG.
