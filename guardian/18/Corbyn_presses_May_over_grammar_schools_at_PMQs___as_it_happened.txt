 * Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, has told MPs that Tony Blair

be with him “whatever” to cabinet colleagues.

Heywood, who was principal private secretary to Blair at the time of the Iraq 
war, initially refused to say what he would do as cabinet secretary if a PM 
refused to circulate a note like this. It was a hypothetical question, he said. 
Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the committee, replied: “It’s not hypothetical, it 
happened.” Then Heywood said: 
I think the cabinet secretary in that situation should seek a one-on-one 
meeting with the prime minister to speak to them directly and say to them that 
he really must share this collectively. It’s going to become government policy. 
That’s the way the cabinet works ...

I certainly agree with you that private memos from the prime minister to the 
president of the United States setting out what the government’s position is 
should have been subject to collective approval, and would be today.

Cabinet secretary gives evidence to MPs on Chilcot inquiry

Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, has been giving evidence to the 
Commons public administration committee about the Chilcot inquiry. According to 
the Sun’sTom Newton Dunn, it has been a waste of time.
Tom Newton Dunn (@tnewtondunn) 
Always wonder why committees bother calling Sir Jeremy Heywood. #PACAC 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/PACAC?src=hash> also getting zilch from him. 
Tighter than proverbial gnat's chuff.

 <https://twitter.com/tnewtondunn/status/776058091062394880> 
But the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope and the Mirror’s Jack Blanchard have 
found some lines worth tweeting.
Jack Blanchard (@Jack_Blanchard_) 
Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood says the Chilcot Inquiry was "an 
outstanding piece of work." He has met Chilcot and told him so

the investigation from the beginning#Chilcot

Blanchard (@Jack_Blanchard_) 
Heywood says the problem was not how long it took to conduct the Chilcot 
inquiry, but the claims at the outset that it could be done quickly

2016 <https://twitter.com/Jack_Blanchard_/status/776054340561801216> Jack

Heywood cannot think of any way Chilcot could have been speeded up. "If you 
want a thorough inquiry, it's going to take that length of time"

£10.3million was "considerably cheaper" than other inquiries - "if that is what

Lunchtime summary

 * Theresa May has united the educational establishment in opposition to her 
plans for new grammar schools, Jeremy Corbyn has told the prime minister in a 
boisterous prime minister’s questions, saying the system would lead to 
“segregation for the few”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/14/corbyn-lambasts-may-on-grammar-schools-in-boisterous-pmqs>
 * May has refused to rule out Britons having to pay for visas to visit Europe 
after Brexit. Angus Robertson, the SNP leader as Westminster, asked for an 
assurances that May would protect visa-free travel in the Brexit negotiations 
with the EU, but she refused to give this assurance. 
 * May has said that an international competition will be launched to design 
Britain’s new national memorial to the Holocaust.It will be built in the 
Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. 
 * Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has 
condemned attacks on Polish people in the UK in the aftermath of the Brexit 
vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/juncker-european-unity-brexit-vote-eu>
 Later, on the World at One, the Ukip leader Nigel Farage accused Juncker of 
being selective. Referring to the killing ofArkadiusz Jozwik, Farage said: 
[Juncker] did refer to that awful incident, but equally he could have referred 
to many other dreadful things being done all over Europe. Not to mention 14 
recognised terrorist attacks in the space of this year. I don’t actually think 
that it’s ever very wise to pick any one incident against an individual and to 
use it for political ends.

 * The government has said it did not renew the contract of an American firm 
accused of wrongly withdrawing tax credits from claimants because its work was 
not up to scratch - but has ruled out an inquiry.As the Press Association 
reports,
Concentrix’s contract to reduce fraud and error in the tax credits system will 
not be extended when it comes up for renewal in May 2017. Responding to an 
urgent question on the matter in the House of Commons, Treasury minister Jane 
Ellisonsaid the firm has “not been providing the high levels of customer 
service that the public expect and which are required in their contract”. But 
she said there is no need “to go into inquiries etc etc” as the contract is not 
being renewed. 
 * A slide in wages growth in the month after the Brexit vote appeared to give 
the first warning sign that the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 
referendum could harm the UK labour market. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/wages-growth-slows-after-brexit-vote-eu-referendum-uk-labour-market-employment>
AsPhillip Inman reports, the Office for National Statistics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics> said wages 
growth slipped to 2.1% in the three months to July, from a revised 2.4% a month 
ago. When bonuses are added to the wage total, earnings rose by 2.3% during the 
quarter, down from 2.5%.Employment rose by 174,000 in the period, while the 
unemployment rate remained at 4.9%. The claimant count, which is calculated for 
August,found there were 771,000 people claiming unemployment related benefits, 
up from 763,600 in July

“brutal” way Theresa May effectively reversed David Cameron’s decision to 
reappoint Rona Fairhead as chair of the corporation.

 * Britain should have taken far more extensive and decisive action in Libya

the former chief of the defence staff has said, following the release of a

PMQs - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> on Twitter.

In summary, they are almost unanimous in thinking that Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> was very effective, and 
Theresa May poor.

From the Daily Mirror’s Kevin Maguire
Kevin Maguire (@Kevin_Maguire) 
Corbyn beat May at #PMQs <https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMQs?src=hash>. She was 
floundering, didn't have answers. And Cameron will be laughing his little socks 
off

PMQs - Verdict

PMQs - Verdict: People often think PMQs is a pointless, archaic ritual but, 
for all the shouting and sloganising, it is remains an arena where ideas and 
policy gets scrutinised and no amount of wit or mudslinging can disguise a 
seriously weak argument. That is whyJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> won today, handsomely. 
Theresa May may be entirely sincere in her desire to create more good schools, 
and her point about “selection by house price” is a good one, but Corbyn 
successfully highlighted some of the multiple flaws with her grammar policy. 
Where are the experts who back it? Why do FSM (free school meal) pupils in 
grammar-school Kent do so much worse than those in non-grammar London? Will 
pupils at grammar school feeder schools be guaranteed a place? How can 
segregation at 11 be justified? On all these questions, May couldn’t provide an 
answer. It was easily her worst PMQs so far.

And that’s what I thought watching it in TV from my desk. Many of the 
journalists who tweet and report on PMQs watch it from press gallery in the 
chamber and they often get a different impression because they hear the actual 
noise levels (which can be much louder, and much more one-sided, than you would 
realise from just following it on TV). And they tell me what was striking was 
how little support May was getting from her own side. That’s not because Tory 
MPs have suddenly gone all Corbynite; it’s because many of them have serious 
reservations about grammar schools. On the basis of today’s PMQs, and judging 
by what happened the last time Corbyn won a PMQs so clearly on an education 
matter (see 12.26pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/14/pmqs-corbyn-may-brexit-cannot-have-a-la-carte-access-to-single-market-eu-chief-says-politics-live?page=with:block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5#block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5>
, the chances of May’s plans being ditched, or having to be substantially 
amended, must be quite high.

My PMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> coverage normally leaves 
outAngus Robertson, the SNP leader, because he asks his questions as I’m 
writing my snap verdict. So here is what he asked.

He started by asking if May would protect visa-free travel to the EU.

She dodged the question.

There was a very clear message from the British people that they wanted to see 
an end to free movement as it operated, they want to see control of the 
movement of people from the EU into the UK and that’s what we will deliver.

Robertson then quoted Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s chief Brexit 
negotiator. He asked May:

Does she agree with Mr Verhofstadt, the EU negotiator, and the Scottish 
government who want to protect Scotland’s place in Europe?

May responded by saying the Scots voted to stay in the UK two years ago.

It’s all very well him asking that question but only two years ago he didn’t 
want to protect Scotland’s place in the EU because he wanted Scotland to leave 
the Uk and on all of these questions - whether it’s the q of the EU referendum, 
the referendum on independence on Scotland, the right honourable gentleman 
seems to think if he asks the same question all the time he’ll get a different 
answer. Well, it won’t work for me and it won’t work for the Scottish people.

Labour’s George Howarth says the police are being asked to do more and more in 
difficult circumstances.

May praises the police for what they do, on duty and off duty. But she says 
police budgets have been protected. Labour wanted to cut them by 5 to 10%, she 
says.

And that’s it.

David Tredinnick, a Conservative, asks about the cooperation between the US 
and Russia and Syria. If we can improve relations with Russia, we may be able 
to solve more problems in the region.

May says she hopes this agreement will lead to progress. But we should have no 
doubt that the relationship with Russia is not a business as usual one, she 
says. She said that after the report into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, 
and still thinks that.

 * Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, has told MPs that Tony Blair 
should have circulatedthe Iraq war note he wrote to George Bush saying he would 
be with him “whatever” to cabinet colleagues. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/07/tony-blair-with-you-whatever-pledge-was-not-commitment-to-war>
Heywood, who was principal private secretary to Blair at the time of the Iraq 
war, initially refused to say what he would do as cabinet secretary if a PM 
refused to circulate a note like this. It was a hypothetical question, he said. 
Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the committee, replied: “It’s not hypothetical, it 
happened.” Then Heywood said: 
I think the cabinet secretary in that situation should seek a one-on-one 
meeting with the prime minister to speak to them directly and say to them that 
he really must share this collectively. It’s going to become government policy. 
That’s the way the cabinet works ...

I certainly agree with you that private memos from the prime minister to the

Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, has been giving evidence to the 
Commons public administration committee about the Chilcot inquiry. According to 
the Sun’sTom Newton Dunn, it has been a waste of time.

But the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope and the Mirror’s Jack Blanchard have

At PMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> Theresa May also

cause offence to students in universities. My colleague Rowena Mason has filed

 * Theresa May has united the educational establishment in opposition to her 
plans for new grammar schools, Jeremy Corbyn has told the prime minister in a 
boisterous prime minister’s questions, saying the system would lead to 
“segregation for the few”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/14/corbyn-lambasts-may-on-grammar-schools-in-boisterous-pmqs>
 * May has refused to rule out Britons having to pay for visas to visit Europe 
after Brexit. Angus Robertson, the SNP leader as Westminster, asked for an 
assurances that May would protect visa-free travel in the Brexit negotiations 
with the EU, but she refused to give this assurance. 
 * May has said that an international competition will be launched to design 
Britain’s new national memorial to the Holocaust.It will be built in the 
Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. 
 * Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has 
condemned attacks on Polish people in the UK in the aftermath of the Brexit 
vote. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/juncker-european-unity-brexit-vote-eu>
 Later, on the World at One, the Ukip leader Nigel Farage accused Juncker of 
being selective. Referring to the killing ofArkadiusz Jozwik, Farage said: 
[Juncker] did refer to that awful incident, but equally he could have referred 
to many other dreadful things being done all over Europe. Not to mention 14 
recognised terrorist attacks in the space of this year. I don’t actually think 
that it’s ever very wise to pick any one incident against an individual and to 
use it for political ends.

 * The government has said it did not renew the contract of an American firm 
accused of wrongly withdrawing tax credits from claimants because its work was 
not up to scratch - but has ruled out an inquiry.As the Press Association 
reports,
Concentrix’s contract to reduce fraud and error in the tax credits system will 
not be extended when it comes up for renewal in May 2017. Responding to an 
urgent question on the matter in the House of Commons, Treasury minister Jane 
Ellisonsaid the firm has “not been providing the high levels of customer 
service that the public expect and which are required in their contract”. But 
she said there is no need “to go into inquiries etc etc” as the contract is not 
being renewed. 
 * A slide in wages growth in the month after the Brexit vote appeared to give 
the first warning sign that the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 
referendum could harm the UK labour market. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/wages-growth-slows-after-brexit-vote-eu-referendum-uk-labour-market-employment>
AsPhillip Inman reports, the Office for National Statistics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics> said wages 
growth slipped to 2.1% in the three months to July, from a revised 2.4% a month 
ago. When bonuses are added to the wage total, earnings rose by 2.3% during the 
quarter, down from 2.5%.Employment rose by 174,000 in the period, while the 
unemployment rate remained at 4.9%. The claimant count, which is calculated for 
August,found there were 771,000 people claiming unemployment related benefits, 
up from 763,600 in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit>

 * The former vice-chairman of the BBC Trust has expressed alarm about the 
“brutal” way Theresa May effectively reversed David Cameron’s decision to 
reappoint Rona Fairhead as chair of the corporation. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/14/theresa-may-role-bbc-chief-exit-brutal-extraordinary-rona-fairhead>
 * Britain should have taken far more extensive and decisive action in Libya 
to prevent the country sliding into chaos after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, 
the former chief of the defence staff has said, following the release of a 
damning report into the UK’s intervention. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/britain-should-have-been-more-decisive-in-libya-says-ex-army-chief>

Colin Myler and legal manager Tom Crone in contempt of the House of Commons 
over evidence they gave about the phone-hacking scandal.

Point C nuclear plant.

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> on Twitter.

In summary, they are almost unanimous in thinking that Jeremy Corbyn

Theresa May poor.

<https://twitter.com/singersz/status/776017957872889856>  
PMQs - Verdict: People often think PMQs is a pointless, archaic ritual but, 
for all the shouting and sloganising, it is remains an arena where ideas and 
policy gets scrutinised and no amount of wit or mudslinging can disguise a 
seriously weak argument. That is whyJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> won today, handsomely. 
Theresa May may be entirely sincere in her desire to create more good schools, 
and her point about “selection by house price” is a good one, but Corbyn 
successfully highlighted some of the multiple flaws with her grammar policy. 
Where are the experts who back it? Why do FSM (free school meal) pupils in 
grammar-school Kent do so much worse than those in non-grammar London? Will 
pupils at grammar school feeder schools be guaranteed a place? How can 
segregation at 11 be justified? On all these questions, May couldn’t provide an 
answer. It was easily her worst PMQs so far.

And that’s what I thought watching it in TV from my desk. Many of the 
journalists who tweet and report on PMQs watch it from press gallery in the 
chamber and they often get a different impression because they hear the actual 
noise levels (which can be much louder, and much more one-sided, than you would 
realise from just following it on TV). And they tell me what was striking was 
how little support May was getting from her own side. That’s not because Tory 
MPs have suddenly gone all Corbynite; it’s because many of them have serious 
reservations about grammar schools. On the basis of today’s PMQs, and judging 
by what happened the last time Corbyn won a PMQs so clearly on an education 
matter (see 12.26pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/14/pmqs-corbyn-may-brexit-cannot-have-a-la-carte-access-to-single-market-eu-chief-says-politics-live?page=with:block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5#block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5>
, the chances of May’s plans being ditched, or having to be substantially 
amended, must be quite high.
 
My PMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> coverage normally leaves 
outAngus Robertson, the SNP leader, because he asks his questions as I’m 
writing my snap verdict. So here is what he asked.

He started by asking if May would protect visa-free travel to the EU.

She dodged the question.

There was a very clear message from the British people that they wanted to see 
an end to free movement as it operated, they want to see control of the 
movement of people from the EU into the UK and that’s what we will deliver.

Robertson then quoted Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s chief Brexit 
negotiator. He asked May:

Does she agree with Mr Verhofstadt, the EU negotiator, and the Scottish 
government who want to protect Scotland’s place in Europe?

May responded by saying the Scots voted to stay in the UK two years ago.

It’s all very well him asking that question but only two years ago he didn’t 
want to protect Scotland’s place in the EU because he wanted Scotland to leave 
the Uk and on all of these questions - whether it’s the q of the EU referendum, 
the referendum on independence on Scotland, the right honourable gentleman 
seems to think if he asks the same question all the time he’ll get a different 
answer. Well, it won’t work for me and it won’t work for the Scottish people.
 
Labour’s George Howarth says the police are being asked to do more and more in 
difficult circumstances.

May praises the police for what they do, on duty and off duty. But she says 
police budgets have been protected. Labour wanted to cut them by 5 to 10%, she 
says.

And that’s it. 
 
David Tredinnick, a Conservative, asks about the cooperation between the US 
and Russia and Syria. If we can improve relations with Russia, we may be able 
to solve more problems in the region.

May says she hopes this agreement will lead to progress. But we should have no 
doubt that the relationship with Russia is not a business as usual one, she 
says. She said that after the report into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, 
and still thinks that.
 
Shailesh Vara, the Conservative, asks about a forthcoming report from Louise 
Casey about political correctness threatening traditions like Christmas 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/10/traditions-such-as-christmas-celebrations-will-die-out-unless-pe/>
. He says minority communities should respect mainstream traditions.

May says she will not comment on the report. But mainstream traditions, as 
well as minority ones, need to be respected, she says.
 
Diana Johnson, the Labour MP, asks for an inquiry into the contaminated blood 
scandal.

May says she will consider this.
 
Lucy Allan, a Conservative, asks if May will agree to an independent review of 
child sexual abuse in Telford.
