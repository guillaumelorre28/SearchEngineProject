Weather Report – Black Market 

John Eriksson: A very summery track from the masters of jazz fusion. Just 
listen to Joe Zawinul’s synth solo. Eerie sounds were important when he made 
music. If I could have been in a band other thanPeter Björn and John

picked Weather Report.

Malin Dahlström’s vocals and the steamy 80s production. High five.

Sigue Sigue Sputnik – Love Missile F1-11

Eggstone – Like So

PM: Per Sunding who produced Gimme Some was the singer in my favourite Swedish 
band of the 90s, Eggstone. Their last album came out in 1997 and now out of the 
blue they release a new single that sounds as if it was recorded at the same 
sessions. Maybe it was. Maybe they are cheating. Either way, it is still great.
