It’s not often the water sector causes many ripples of excitement, but Severn 
Trentis bucking a downbeat trend after it unveiled an agreed takeover deal.

It is buying Dee Valley Group, a neighbouring business which operates in 
Wrexham and Chester, for £78.5m or £17.05 a share. Dee Valley, which has been 
supplying water for 150 years, has 125,000 customers in northeast Wales and 
northwest Cheshire. Severn chief executive Liv Garfield said:

[This] represents an opportunity for Severn Trent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/severntrent> to apply its successful 
operating model for the benefit of customers across an enlarged asset base.

Dee Valley chairman Jon Schofield said:

We believe the acquisition provides attractive value to Dee Valley 
shareholders.

Severn Trent shares are up 51p at £21.90 on the news. The sector has also 
benefitted from Citigroup raising its recommendation to neutral on Severn,Pennon
, 15p better at 791p, andUnited Utilities, up 7.5p at 883p.

Overall the FTSE 100 is down 11.01 points at 6781.73 as investors pause for 
breath again, and the UK jobless rate falls to an 11 year low but benefit 
claims rise.

Rolls-Royce is leading the fallers, down 26p at 728.5p after the aero engine 
maker said it aimed to deliver cost savings at the top end of its guided £150m 
to £200m range to cope with mixed markets. It also announced more details of a 
change in accounting policy. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves 
Lansdown, said:

Five profit warnings in the 20 months up to November 2015 means Rolls-Royce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/rollsroycegroup> shareholders have had 
anything but a smooth ride recently. Over this time, the group’s credibility 
took a pasting and its accounting policies were widely criticised.

 For example, Rolls previously accounted for aftermarket revenues, the 
maintenance and service work done after the engines are initially sold, 
upfront. But when customers started to retire old planes rather than have 
existing ones serviced, much of that cash never materialised.

The new accounting policies mean that last year’s profits will be restated, 
and adjusted down by £900m. However, that doesn’t affect what is actually 
coming in to the group’s coffers, only when it’s accounted for. The new system 
should mean greater clarity moving forward.

 Operationally, the group is undergoing some major restructures. Investors 
will hope that it emerges as a leaner and more transparent company. However, 
the road ahead could be a long one, and as Rolls-Royce has found, it is best 
not to count any chickens before they have hatched.

Barratt Developments has fallen 12.5p to 470.4p after the housebuilder’s 
latest update 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/barratt-london-homes-brexit> 
showed it cutting London prices at the top end of the market.

Among the mid-caps B&M European Value Retail continues to rise following 
Tuesday’s update, adding 10.9p to 255.9p as Jefferies moved from hold to buy 
with a 285p target. It said:

We believe B&M’s 33% share price fall since peak provides a buying 
opportunity. We think B&M is well positioned for a tough UK consumer 
environment and Jefferies’ latest consumer survey results support our view that 
B&M can gain market share and maintain resilient margins.

But Ocado has dropped 19.1p to 263.1p as one of its partners Morrisons 
unveiled an increased deal with Amazon. Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein said:

It’s unclear at this stage what the deal means for the prospect of in-store 
picking with Ocado but it will certainly give Morrisons much better negotiation 
power in the discussions. It should also improve the bargaining position any 
other retailer looking to sign a deal withOcado
