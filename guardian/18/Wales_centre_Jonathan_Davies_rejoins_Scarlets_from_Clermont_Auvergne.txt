“I am delighted to have signed a national dual contract and to be returning to 
the Scarlets,” he said.

“I have immensely enjoyed my time in France and would like to thank Clermont 
Auvergne for the opportunity.

“The joint commitment between the WRU and regions is driving for success and I 
believe the time is right to return to Wales and signing an NDC is the best 
decision for me rugby-wise.”
