The singer Shannon Noll has been charged over the alleged assault of a 
security guard at anAdelaide

Noll was arrested and charged with two counts of assault after an altercation 
outside the Crazy Horse Revue at 2.30am on Sunday.

A witness quoted by the Adelaide Advertiser

 said he had seen Noll, “intoxicated and screaming”, being forcibly removed 
from the club by security guards. “He kept saying, ‘I’m Shannon Noll, let me 
back in,’” said the bystander of the Australian Idol runner-up.

Noll was taken away in a police car after reportedly punching a security 
guard. He was bailed to appear in Adelaide magistrates court on 24 February.

The Crazy Horse Revue, on Hindley Street, describes itself on its website as 
“the home of ‘Miss Nude Australia’ ... where fantasy becomes reality”.


The 41-year-old singer was in South Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> to perform What 
About Me and other songs at the Sounds By the River music festival in Mannum on 
Saturday.

Many posts on Noll’s Facebook page referenced the altercation on Sunday. 
“Nollsie what you been up to old fella!!! I heard from bazza that you ending up 
in the clink last night!?? Are you alright trooper? Let me know if you want me 
to come bail you out,” commented one Noll supporter

Just two days before his arrest, Noll had shared a photo of his new vegetable 
garden

 with his 160,000 followers: “A little late this year, but I put in a little 
veggie patch anyway. Could’ve picked a cooler day but got it done! Nothing like 
home grown veggies! I would luv to have some chooks as well! Maybe down the 
track!”

Since placing second to Guy Sebastian in the first season of Australian Idol 
in 2003, Noll has found a new life as an internet sensation, with hordes of 
young Australians championing him more than a decade on.

 A Facebook petition to “Get Shannon Noll to Groovin’ the Moo” in January last 
year received thousands of likes, though it did not achieved its stated 
purpose. A subsequent campaign among Victorian high school students to write 
“Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australian Idol title” on their exam 
papers was more successful.

Noll told News Corp

 Australia in September that he was embracing viral infamy, releasing a single, 
Who I Am, to capitalise on it. “Some of the stuff they’ve done is bloody 
brilliant and very clever and very funny,” he said. “I reckon half of the kids 
putting together these memes need to be on my marketing team.

“They’re not being offensive towards me, they’re genuinely funny. I’ve done my 
time where what people were saying about me on social media wasn’t positive.

“Where people used to enjoy taking the piss out of me or having a go at me 
from behind the computer screen now it feels like it’s cool to be in my corner. 
I put it down to that thing where you go to a game of footy and you boo a guy 
for so long you end up cheering for him. I’m running with it.”
