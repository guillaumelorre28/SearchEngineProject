A Utah <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah> high school homework 
assignment directing students to “go on a date” and telling girls to be 
“feminine and lady-like” and not to “waste” a boy’s money has caused an uproar 
over what some said was an example of misogynistic lessons common in the state.

The handouts from Highland high school in Salt Lake City, copies of which 
spread on Facebook

 this week, outlined guidelines for a “$5 Date” and provided separate 
instructions for boys and girls.

The lesson, which came from a Utah teachers’ database of assignments and has 
since been removed, told girls, “Don’t keep checking in the mirror combing 
hair,” “Don’t fish for compliments,” “Don’t criticize his driving” and “If you 
think you’re too fat etc, keep it to yourself.”

Jenn Oxborrow, the mother who posted the handout on Facebook, said in an 
interview that her 16-year-old daughter’s “financial literacy and adult roles” 
course has repeatedly promoted gender stereotypes and sexist material.

“I was horrified. It wasn’t the first time that we had seen content that was 
gender biased in this class. But this was over the top,” she said. “As a 
teacher, you have a responsibility to be inclusive and to think very carefully 
about the message you’re sharing.”

Her daughter, Lucy Mulligan, a junior and honors student, said she was 
immediately surprised by the language of the assignment and the fact that it 
offered different directions for girls and boys.

“I just thought it was so bizarre,” she said. “The girls’ assignment was 
essentially based around how to please boys.”

The handouts said they were offering girls suggestions “from the guys” and 
vice versa and told boys to “make plans for the date”, pick up the girl and pay 
for the meal.

The boys’ worksheet further said, “At a restaurant, say what you’re going to 
order so she will have a guide in ordering”, “Girls like flowers and little 
gifts”, “chew with your mouth closed”, “no gross noises” and “Don’t comment or 
be concerned with how much she is or isn’t eating”.

Highland’s principal Chris Jenson did not respond to a request for comment but 
told the Salt Lake Tribune 
<http://www.sltrib.com/home/4804114-155/utah-high-school-assignment-on-dating> 
that the teacher did not write the lesson and that students could spend time 
with a friend to complete the assignment.

Jenson declined to identify the teacher but said, “She wanted it to be a 
light-hearted lesson in social norms.”

Mulligan said it seemed the students had no choice but to go on a date, noting 
that the worksheet requires a “date’s signature”.

She said she was particularly concerned that LGBT students would feel excluded 
or hurt by the message of the worksheets, which assume that girls only date 
boys.

“I was thinking of kids in my class who might not identify as being straight 
or might not identify as any particular gender,” she said. “If you’re 
struggling to come out or feel comfortable in your environment and then you’re 
given this assignment that makes it seem like it might be unacceptable, I just 
think it’s encouraging pretty unfair standards.”

Oxborrow, who is the executive director of the Utah Domestic Violence 
Coalition, said lessons that reinforce male entitlement and gender norms can 
have serious consequences. She noted that the highly conservative state hashigh

“This can contribute to really dangerous and unhealthy relationships,” she 
said, adding, “It’s completely non-inclusive and completely insensitive.”

Mark Peterson, spokesman for the Utah board of education, said the assignment 
came from an “open source”network <http://www.uen.org/> where teachers can 
upload and share lessons and that the state did not vet the material. But 
officials have since removed the worksheets, which werereportedly

part of a “Purposes of Dating” section.

“It is inappropriate and unacceptable. It is very much is reminiscent of a 
textbook on dating from the 1950s or earlier,” Peterson said.

It’s unclear how widely teachers have used the assignment, but Oxborrow said 
it appeared the lesson has circulated since 2011. She also noted that 
communities outside of her district have since told her that teachers assigned 
the same homework for the class, which is a state-mandated course.

“They are acting like this is all taken care of because one worksheet has been 
modified or taken down,” she said, adding, “I’m really concerned that the 
content and messaging is evidence-based.”

Mulligan said she felt her frustrations with her coursework made her a 
minority in the class, but hoped the attention would encourage school officials 
to more broadly reform curricula.

“I hope it just becomes more overall inclusive for people who don’t identify 
as being male or female or straight,” she said. “I hope people are able to feel 
more comfortable in the classroom.”
