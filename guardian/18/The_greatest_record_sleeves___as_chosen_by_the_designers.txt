’s sleeve was really radical and ahead of its time and it still looks 
contemporary. By contrast to Peter Blake’s vivid artwork for the Beatles’ 
previous album, Sgt Pepper’s, it was a plain white sleeve with the band name 
just embossed, almost invisible. There was a stamped number, which made each 
one unique. My parents had it first, but I thought it looked boring until I 
studied art. Once you understand the context, it gets really interesting. We 
think of design as for the present moment, but while music doesn’t change, 
people’s feelings and relations to it do. So the sleeve becomes a reflection of 
that. It placed an avant-garde idea into the mainstream – the cover is a blank 
space on which you can project your fantasies. A few years ago, this guy had a 
record shop selling nothing but old copies of the White Album. People had drawn 
on them, made coffee cup rings on them or whatever and each one was different, 
because it had lived a life. Onthe vinyl edition of Blackstar 
<http://store.davidbowie.com/blackstar-vinyl-lp.html>, you can see the record 
and, over time, watch it decay. It’s trying to say: “That’s reality.”

By the end of the 60s, we had people walking on the moon and Concorde zooming 
across the Atlantic in three-and-a-half hours. The future seemed right around 
the corner. At the same time, there was this incredible psychedelic movement 
going on. It felt as if everything could be different. The musicians were 
making new worlds. I was obsessed with designing the future, but the graphic 
designers of the day were hardwiring it into our existing culture with their 
decades-old design and fonts. That’s whyRick Griffin 
<http://www.myraltis.co.uk/rickgriffin/>’s cover had such a powerful effect on 
me, and is still my favourite sleeve. He had changed the use of lettering 
completely but it was still legible. The painting looks as if it comes from a 
completely other world. It seemed to be saying to me that the rules were 
bullshit, that we could do anything we wanted. As an art student, this was like 
being given the keys to a prison door. I didn’t copy it, but it allowed me to 
do my own thing. The album is OK, but the cover is blisteringly amazing. When I 
look at it, I see freedom.

Autobahn was the first album I ever bought, after I heard the single on the 
radio. In 1974, as a teenager who had never been abroad, listening to the full 
22-minute title track while staring at the autobahn symbol on the sleeve felt 
like being taken on a journey. I was on a European highway, in a soundscape 
crafted by classically trained musicians, seeing cathedrals and power stations, 
villages and skyscrapers, ancient and modern, in time as well as distance. It 
was a continental tour – from gothic to postmodern, from the dark ages to 
Brigitte Bardot – with the pulsebeat of a speeding vehicle. All defined in a 
simple symbol. As a fledgling visual artist, this was my first lesson in 
semiotics. I realised that visual codes acted as keys to unlock the huge range 
of potential awareness in an audience. Four years later, when I was asked to do
the poster for the first night of the Factory club 
<http://www.2welve.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/the-factory-poster.jpg>, I 
noticed an industrial warning sign on a workshop door at art college: “Use 
hearing protection.” I’d been thinking “Factory ... new music ... industrial 
city” and realised: “That’s it!” My Autobahn moment.

At my grammar school, you displayed your allegiances via the album you carried 
under your arm: Deep Purple in Rock, Genesis’s Nursery Cryme and so on. The 
longhairs were outsiders, but to be ever more apart, you carried Hawkwind. The 
designer,Barney Bubbles 
<http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/2007/01/20/barney-bubbles-artist-and-designer/>
, was a genius. This wasn’t just a square of card. Itunfolded out to a rough 
hawk shape 
<https://pathwaygroupstoke.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/hawkwindisoslog2.jpg>. 
On the front, there was this post-psychedelic, pre-electro, sci-fi mandala. On 
the back, there were no track titles, just a completely blurred picture of them 
playing live (which seemed to replicate the Hawkwind live experience) and the 
words: “Technicians of spaceship Earth, this is your captain speaking, your 
captain is dead.” Coming with a booklet of countercultural images and texts, it 
really broke convention for album packaging. It inspired me graphically, with 
its geometric shapes and fluorescent colours, and I became immersed in an 
“alternative” lifestyle and took psychedelic drugs. On one trip in Scotland, I 
was convinced I could see aliens landing, I experienced synaesthesia and 
distinctly remember listening to this album through my teeth. When the Sex 
Pistols came along, I realised this outsider attitude applied equally to 
another counterculture, punk.

I wanted to design record sleeves from the moment I went to see a Roger Dean 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/oct/21/roger-dean-somewhere-near-here-prog-rock-album-covers-in-pictures>
 lecture in Durham when I was 15. His sleeves weren’t about how the band 
looked, but the use of imagination. In my work, I’m keen on the ambiguous and 
the mysterious. This sleeve is the complete antithesis of my philosophy, but I 
like its innocence and directness. I’m not a fan of the graphics, but this 
image – given what Iggy was going through in 1977 with heroin addiction – is 
just extraordinary. Andy Kent’s photograph isn’t the depiction of a wasted 
rock’n’roller one might expect. Iggy’s a beautiful man, aged 30, but it’s like 
a high-school photograph and totally fits the words Lust for Life. I bought it 
when I was at Newcastle Polytechnic, probably because of David Bowie’s 
involvement. The sleeve seemed confrontational and unexpected. Iggy looks like 
a children’s TV presenter or someone about to present the weather forecast, but 
the record inside is raw and harrowing. It’s the absolute opposite of 
everything conjured up by the sleeve. I love that.

<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/may/04/shopping.culture>

I was brought up in a house in Cornwall where no one listened to music. When I 
was a teenager, my friends bought this album and showed me it. In 1989, I had 
never seen anything like it. The combination of Simon Larbalestier’s 
photography andVaughan Oliver 
<http://www.hardformat.org/designers/vaughan-oliver-designer/>’s design and 
typography was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I thought: “Whatever 
that is, that’s what I want to do.” I had always been a messy person, but 
suddenly everything made sense. I realised that in art and design, you can get 
your hands dirty, make mistakes and embrace them. Before this, to me, a record 
cover meant a boyband on a sleeve, which made me want to puke, but here was 
something I could emotionally engage with. It gave me no answers, only a 
million questions. Why are the letters like this? Why is the print over the top 
of everything? I can’t even remember playing it, just staring at it and it 
taking over my brain. It gave me permission to be me, which has influenced 
everything in my life.

Chosen by Tony Hung, artist behind Blur’s The Magic Whip 

Jean-Michel Basquiat <http://basquiat.com/>’s artwork brought this great 
hip-hop 12in from 1983 to my attention in a record shop in Manchester. The 
cover is typically Basquiat. In the context of a record sleeve, he brings 
something unconventional, bold, playful, thought-provoking, raw and engaging 
while maintaining an unlaboured feel. All the surfaces – including the record 
labels – are something to behold, and perfectly suit the music within. Despite 
being 33 years old, this work feels more potent than ever, when much of our 
daily eyeline is bombarded with overstylised, computer-perfected, market-led 
noise. Armed with just a paint stick, Basquiat effortlessly cuts through it 
all. It’s life-affirming. It reminds me I am a human being and to be a human 
being, to be instinctive, and that with just primitive tools, we can still make 
joyful and fulfilling work.

Chosen by Dan Hillier, winner of the 2014 Best Art 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art> Vinyl award for the cover of 
Royal Blood’s debut album

I was five or six when this came out in 1979, and didn’t know anything about 
Joy Division, but it’s one of those images that has always been about. When I 
was younger, I didn’t know what it was or understand it, but something about 
the graphic always appealed. I later found out that Peter Saville’s sleeve 
designdepicts a frequency wave from the first known pulsar 
<http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/>
, but it could equally be a landscape or depict musical frequencies. My 
experience of the music on records has always been influenced to some degree by 
the cover art, and this is dark and bleak and jagged, which is perfect for that 
album. After Royal Blood used myPachamama image for their album 
<https://www.danhillier.com/artwork/pachamama----screen-print>, their manager 
and I agreed we would have preferred not to have words on the cover. On the 
front of Unknown Pleasures, there’s no band name or text, so no marketing or 
conventional enticement. It has something akin to the monolith in 2001: A Space 
Odyssey about it, like a communication from somewhere unknown. It’s mysterious, 
dark and self-contained.

This has been my favourite album cover for as long as I can remember. Hipgnosis
 <http://www.hipgnosiscovers.com/> did lots of the great 70s sleeves and this 
is weird, timeless and iconic. I recently did a cover for an album of Zeppelin 
covers called From the Land of Ice and Snow andredrew the Houses of the Holy 
image in my own style <http://www.jealousbutcher.com/products/various>. So I’ve 
spent a lot of time with it. It’s a photo collage image of nymph-like, 
mermaid-like, naked children – actually a brother and sister – climbing Giant’s 
Causeway, in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Zeppelin combine blues with 
fantasy and JRR Tolkien, and all that is on the cover. It seems to signify 
otherworldliness, something primal and social taboos. There’s something vaguely 
sexualised about the children, but whatever sexuality it’s alluding to is 
subtle enough that you can shrug it off. Onthe cover of the Decemberists’ What 
a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World 
<http://decemberistsshop.com/products/what-a-terrible-world-what-a-beautiful-world-cd>
, I drew a stylised, flat depiction of a naked woman, with tiny pink dots for 
nipples. I was told that big stores wouldn’t stock it. They were the most 
benign, non-sexual nipples that anyone ever had.

Chosen by Cey Adams <http://ceyadams.com/>, designer of Def Jam Recordings 
sleeves from the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and Jay Z

This is one of Miles Davis’s last recordings, in his avant-garde period – it’s 
named after Archbishop Desmond Tutu. It’s just a stark photograph byIrving Penn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/08/irving-penn-obituary> of 
Miles looking straight on, and the edges are faded black [the cover was 
designed byEiko Ishioka 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/29/eiko-ishioka>]. I was 
taken by the fact that an artist could have a cover without his name on it, and 
Miles Davis was obviously so popular that he could do that. Miles always had 
very powerful features, and the texture and detail in his face shows the 
journey of his career and how much he put into it. I was drawn to the album by 
that intense, beautiful stare. I modelled my career on Miles in terms of 
wanting to push boundaries. For example, Public Enemy’sFear of a Black Planet 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_a_Black_Planet#/media/File:Fear_of_a_Black_Planet.jpg>
 was conceptual art, which no one had done in hip-hop before. However, I was so 
moved by the Tutu cover that when the time came to do LL Cool J’s greatest hits 
album, All World, Iapplied the same idea to an Albert Watson photograph of LL 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_World:_Greatest_Hits#/media/File:All_World_-_LL_Cool_J.jpg>
. There was type on the front, but it was on a shinkwrap that peeled off. It 
was my homage to Tutu.

Chosen by Joe Buckingham <http://josephbuckingham.com/>, designer of various 
De La Soul sleeves including De La Soul Is Dead

I’ve always liked album sleeves that double as construction kits. I had a 
Jefferson Airplane album that you could take apart and build into a fully 
three-dimensional cigar box. The inner sleeve was an image of marijuana, and 
that sat in the box, so it looked as if it was filled with grass. In this 
field, though, this Parliament cover is king and is still my all-time favourite 
sleeve. It was a gatefold with a pop-up element. If you laid the album flat, 
this fantasy castle popped up along with various characters you could cut out 
and stand up in the castle. There were tons of illustrations, and the cover 
featured a giant bird coming down on the album’s Sir Nose character. There was 
just so much to look at inOverton Loyd <http://overvision.com/>’s artwork. It 
really piqued my imagination. I think subconsciously the starkness and 
simplicity of the cover image against a white background seeped into how I

Chosen by Scott Sandler <http://mrscottdesign.com/>, Grammy-nominated designer 
of artwork for everyone from Def Jam to Lil Wayne to the Rolling Stones

I love this because of the story behind it and the way the cover works with 
the music. In the mid-70s, Marvin Gaye had had two enormous albums in What’s 
Going On and Let’s Get It On, but was going through an acrimonious divorce from 
Anna Gordy. They agreed a deal whereby she wouldn’t get any money, but would 
get all the proceeds of his next album, which looked guaranteed to be the 
biggest record ever. Instead, he sabotaged the deal by making a wilfully 
uncommercial album, full ofsongs about their relationship 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ74DQ-HWxQ>, although it’s now seen as 
another classic. Gaye gave Michael Bryan, the artist, very specific 
instructions, so the cover features the singer looking like a Greek god. The 
artwork includes the words “love and marriage” and “judgment” and it unfolds to 
a picture of him handing her this itsy-bitsy, teeny-tiny record. That’s dark, 
but mostly a record just features a photo of the band. This is a total concept, 
a snapshot of his state of mind and an amazing art piece.

When I was about 13, I heard I Will Follow 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2BqLlVHlWA> when I was listening to the John 
Peel show on headphones. I thought it was amazing, and immediately went to this 
little local shop that sold TVs as well as records, and ordered it. At that 
point, I had no idea what it would look like. When I got it, I just thought it 
was so beautiful, I stared at it for hours. I don’t care much for the graphics, 
but it’s very evocative of a time in my life that shaped my love of music, and 
there’s something almost Mona Lisa-like about the photograph on the sleeve. 
Does it capture innocence, or something darker? Theyused the same boy two 
albums later for War 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/child-appeared-u2-album-covers-boy-war-grown-31-years-article-1.964294>
, by which point he has a split lip. So there’s a narrative developing. When I 
was about 13 or 14, I had this big blue Adidas bag for school, and I wrote “U2” 
on it in really big lettering in ballpoint pen, but messily and badly. That was 
my first attempt at graphics.

Chosen by Rochelle Nembhard, who worked on the acclaimed cover for Petite 
Noir’s La Vie Est Belle

I like covers that relate directly to the musician, more than abstract images. 
I like some abstract images, but those covers could be anyone. Homogenic is a 
piece of art, and the fact that she used Alexander McQueen to design it was 
amazing. It’s a fusion between African and Asian – the African necklaces and 
the Asian dress – that stands the test of time. I love all Björk’s covers for 
that reason – they all show an aspect of her. The visual aspect of music, the 
album cover, is important, because it is a picture of the music, depicting the 
sound. It should be so much more than just a one-dimensional image – it has to 
be the face of the music. That’s what I was trying to dowith Petite Noir, 
working with the artist Lina Viktor 
<http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/22275/306b06ea.jpg>. I knew she had the type 
of imagery that would translate into his music and stand the test of time.

I love the DIY aesthetic of the first edition of Elvis Presley’s first album 
<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Elvispresleydebutalbum.jpeg>, 
later homaged byRay Lowry for the Clash’s London Calling 
<http://www.raylowry.com/> sleeve. The wonky type looks like it has been cut 
out and stuck on by hand. There’s another musician awkwardly cropped in the 
photo of Elvis. Nowadays, the record company would ask you to Photoshop him 
out. The immediacy of the image and graphics make a statement of intent: “Here 
I am.” Many years and genres after that was released, the same aesthetic 
inspired me when I came across this EP of Scritti Politti’s second John Peel 
session in Chick-A-Boom Records in Sutton Market, some years after it came out 
in 1979 on Rough Trade Records. The sleeve was just a plastic bag with two bits 
of photocopied paper in it. One of them listed the entire costs of making the 
record, including £65 for 5,000 plastic covers. The other photocopy was of a 
bag of crisps, a badge and some sugar. It demystified the entire process and I 
realised that I could do something similar at the local library. So I took 
loads of stuff down and started photocopying it.
