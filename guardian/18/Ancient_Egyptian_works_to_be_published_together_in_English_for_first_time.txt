Ancient Egyptian texts written on rock faces and papyri are being brought 
together for the general reader for the first time after a Cambridge academic 
translated the hieroglyphic writings into modern English.

Until now few people beyond specialists have been able to read the texts, many 
of them inaccessible within tombs. While ancient Greek andRoman texts

 are widely accessible in modern editions, those from ancient Egypt have been 
largely overlooked, and the civilisation is most famous for its monuments.

our image of the monumental pharaonic culture and its mysterious god-kings.

Toby Wilkinson said he had decided to begin work on the anthology because 
there was a missing dimension in how ancientEgypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt> was viewed: “The life of the mind, as 
expressed in the written word.”

The written tradition lasted nearly 3,500 years and writing is found on almost 
every tomb and temple wall. Yet there had been a temptation to see it as “mere 
decoration”, he said, with museums often displaying papyri as artefacts rather 
than texts.

The public were missing out on a rich literary tradition, Wilkinson said. 
“What will surprise people are the insights behind the well-known facade of 
ancient Egypt, behind the image that everyone has of the pharaohs, 
Tutankhamun’s mask and the pyramids.”

Hieroglyphs were pictures but they conveyed concepts in as sophisticated a 
manner as Greek or Latin script, he said. Filled with metaphor and symbolism, 
they reveal life through the eyes of the ancient Egyptians. Tales of shipwreck 
and wonder, first-hand descriptions of battles and natural disasters, songs and 
satires make up the anthology, titled Writings from Ancient Egypt.

Penguin Classics, which is releasing the book on Wednesday, described it as a 
groundbreaking publication because “these writings have never before been 
published together in an accessible collection”.

Wilkinson, a fellow of Clare College and author of other books on ancient 
Egypt, said some of the texts had not been translated for the best part of 100 
years. “The English in which they are rendered – assuming they are in English – 
is very old-fashioned and impenetrable, and actually makes ancient Egypt seem 
an even more remote society,” he said.

In translating them, he said, he was struck by human emotions to which people 
could relate today.

The literary fiction includes The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, a story of 
triumph over adversity that Wilkinson describes as “a miniature masterpiece”. 
It is about a magical island ruled by a giant snake – his body “fashioned in 
gold, his eyebrows in real lapis lazuli” – who shares his own tragedy in 
encouraging a shipwrecked sailor to face his predicament.

“I was here with my brothers and my children ... we totalled 75 snakes ... 
Then a star fell and they were consumed in flames ... If you are brave and your 
heart is strong, you will embrace your children, you will kiss your wife and 
you will see your house,” it reads.

Letters written by a farmer called Heqanakht date from 1930BC but reflect 
modern concerns, from land management to grain quality. He writes to his 
steward: “Be extra dutiful in cultivating. Watch out that my barley-seed is 
guarded.”

Turning to domestic matters, he sends greetings to his son Sneferu, his “pride 
and joy, a thousand times, a million times”, and urges the steward to stop the 
housemaid bullying his wife: “You are the one who lets her do bad things to my 
wife … Enough of it!”

Other texts include the Tempest Stela. While official inscriptions generally 
portray an ideal view of society, this records a cataclysmic thunderstorm: “It 
was dark in the west and the sky was filled with storm clouds without [end and 
thunder] more than the noise of a crowd … The irrigated land had been deluged, 
the buildings cast down, the chapels destroyed … total destruction.”

The number of people who can read hieroglyphs is small and the language is 
particularly rich and subtle, often in ways that cannot be easilyexpressed in 
English 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/09/translated-fiction-sells-better-uk-english-fiction-elena-ferrante-haruki-murakami>
.

Wilkinson writes: “Take, for example, the words ‘aa’ and ‘wer’, both 
conventionally translated as ‘great’. The Egyptians seem to have understood a 
distinction – hence a god is often described as ‘aa’ but seldom as ‘wer’ – but 
it is beyond our grasp.”

Words of wisdom in a text called The Teaching of Ani remain as true today as 
in the 16th century BC: “Man perishes; his corpse turns to dust; all his 
relatives pass away. But writings make him remembered in the mouth of the 
reader.”
