A Bolivian government investigation into the plane crash that killed dozens of 
Brazilian soccer players 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia-plane-crash-2016> last month has 
concluded that a Bolivian airline and pilot were directly responsible.

 The pilot, Miguel Quiroga, was one of 71 people killed when a plane operated 
by the Bolivia-based charter apparently ran out of fuel and crashed on a wooded 
hillside near the Colombian city of Medellín. Quiroga was also a co-owner of 
the airline.

 The aircraft had been transporting Brazil’s Chapecoense football team to the 
biggest game in their history, the final of the Copa Sudamericana.

 “LaMia and the pilot are directly responsible for what happened with this 
tragic event,” said Bolivia’s public works minister, Milton Claros, who 
oversees Bolivia’s aviation authority.

 Gustavo Vargas Gamboa, LaMia’s chief executive, was jailed pending trial 
earlier this month on manslaughter and other charges. He has denied the charges.

His son Gustavo Vargas Villegas, a former official with Bolivia’s aviation 
authority,is also being held until trial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/10/colombia-plane-crash-second-suspect-bolivia-brazil>
 on charges that he misused his influence in authorising the licence of the 
plane that crashed. He also says he is innocent.

 Criminal charges were also brought against LaMia co-owner Marco Antonio Rocha 
Benegas, whose whereabouts are unknown, and air traffic controller Celia 
Castedo,who fled Bolivia after the crash and is seeking asylum in Brazil

.

At the press conference, Claros said the crash was an “isolated” incident and 
did not mean it was unsafe to fly inBolivia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/bolivia>. Still he said the government would 
accelerate the process of implementing a new aeronautical safety system.
