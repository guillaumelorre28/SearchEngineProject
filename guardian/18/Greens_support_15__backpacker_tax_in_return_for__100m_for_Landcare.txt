The Greens <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-greens> have 
come to terms with the Turnbull government on the backpacker tax, securing an 
additional $100m for Landcare funding in the process.


The legislation passed the Senate on Thursday night, ending a day of 
arm-twisting and backroom dealing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/dec/01/malcolm-turnbull-flags-security-overhaul-police-let-protestors-off-scot-free-politics-live>
 on the measure which culminated in the Greens agreeing to support a nominal 
tax rate of 15%, and a drop in the clawback of super payments from 95% to 65%.

Currently the government claims 95% of their compulsory superannuation 
contributions when backpackers leave Australia.


“What we have seen today is common sense prevail,” the Greens leader, Richard 
Di Natale <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/richard-di-natale>, told 
reporters earlier in the day. “We are very, very pleased that we have been able 
to secure a commonsense outcome, to be the sensible voice in this Senate.”

Di Natale said the change in the super payments, combined with the 15% rate, 
meant the deal was effectively revenue neutral with a 13% headline rate. But 
the $100m spend for Landcare is a new government investment.

Labor pointed out that the combined deal with the Greens was significantly 
more costly for the budget bottom line than it would have been to agree with 
the opposition and the crossbench on a 13% tax rate.

Asked why the government would do a deal with the Greens when the budget 
impact was negative to the tune of $160m, and when it already had the numbers 
in the Senate to secure a 13% tax rate without the additional spend, the prime 
minister told reporters Landcare was a “great” investment.

The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has cut 
$300m from Landcare since 2013.

The treasurer, Scott Morrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison>, said the agreement 
would see the government “achieve over 70% of the revenues that were set out in 
the budget”.

But the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts expressed frustration at the turn 
of events, suggesting Pauline Hanson had supported the government throughout 
the imbroglio without asking for additional expenditure.

followed a chaotic sequence

 on Thursday when the Turnbull government dug in behind a 15% rate, while a 
number of Senate crossbenchers, the ALP and, initially, the Greens, lined up to 
demand the government accept a 13% rate.

The National Farmers’ Federation, which had supported the 15% rate, on 
Thursday urged the government to accept the rate that parliament would deliver, 
rather than refuse to compromise and see the headline rate for the tax revert 
to 32.5%.

The political standoff continued until just after question time on Thursday 
when the Greens involvement emerged.

Di Natale explained the shift by his party from 13% to 15% over the course of 
Thursday as a desire to fix an issue that was creating significant problems for 
farming and horticultural communities.

“We needed a circuit breaker because we risked this whole thing descending 
into a farce – a farce that would have impacted on people living in regional 
communities whose livelihood was affected,” Di Natale said.

The handshake between the Greens and the government cleared the way for the 
necessary legislation to pass through parliament before the chambers rose for 
the Christmas break.

The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, took to Twitter to thank the Greens 
for cooperating with the Coalition.

In the parliament, Morrison welcomed the decision by the Greens to support a 
15% rate. The treasurer said the episode demonstrated the government could come 
to terms with One Nation senators, Nick Xenophon Team senators and, “once 
again, with the Greens”.

Morrison said the Senate had rebuffed Labor’s “belligerence”.

“The government has been able to get this done in the 45th parliament,” the 
treasurer said.

But the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Morrison had failed to mention the 
fiscal impact of his deal with the Greens.

“The treasurer has done a deal that involves a higher tax rate and less money 
for the budget,” Bowen said on Thursday afternoon.

Bowen said the deal with the Greens would cost the budget more than accepting 
a backpacker tax set at a rate of 13%.

He said Morrison was so determined not to do a deal with Labor on the measure, 
he’d been prepared to spend more in order to come to terms with the Greens.

Earlier in the day the prime minister used a series of media interviews to 
blast Labor for refusing to support a 15% rate.

In an attempt to ratchet up political pressure, Turnbull declared the ALP 
wanted “white kids, rich, white kids from Europe, who come here on their 
holidays, to pay less tax than some of the Pacific Islanders from some of the 
poorest countries in the world”.
