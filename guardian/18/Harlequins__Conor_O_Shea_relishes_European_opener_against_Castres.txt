The Harlequins <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/harlequinsru> director of 
rugby, Conor O’Shea, is relishing another tilt at major French opposition when 
the European Champions Cup kicks off on Fridaynight.

Quins will get the ball rolling by hosting the 2013 French champions and 2014 
runners-up, Castres, at The Stoop. Whereas Quins are outside the Aviva 
Premiership’s top half,Castres <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> have 
only two teams below them in the Top 14 and are 16 points behind the leaders, 
Clermont Auvergne, after losing six of their opening nine league games.

O’Shea said: “They might have had an inconsistent start to the season but they 
are a brilliant side. They are Top 14 champions and finalists over the past two 
years, so what a massive game to start it off. It’s going to be ferocious.

“We always like playing the French sides because they play rugby, they try and 
attack. People have this turgid view of the Top 14 but they don’t [play like 
that], especially Castres.”

O’Shea has made three changes to the side beaten by Leicester last Friday, 
with the centre George Lowe replacing Tom Casson, the scrum-half Danny Care 
returning after his partner gave birth to the couple’s first child, and the 
hooker Dave Ward in for Joe Gray.

Castres will be spearheaded by their outstanding half-back combination of Rémi 
Talès and Rory Kockott, with the Scotland internationals Max Evans and Richie 
Gray also in the starting XV.
