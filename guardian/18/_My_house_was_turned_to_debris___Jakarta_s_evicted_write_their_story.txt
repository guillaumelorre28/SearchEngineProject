In August 2015, hundreds of residents living in an informal community in Pulo, 
Jakarta, were evicted, and their houses bulldozed. The government said it was 
to provide better housing, and to protect them from the floods to which the
kampung was prone.

The residents – mostly fishermen, small traders, informal workers and blue 
collar workers – were moved to social housing, roughly 12 miles away. Their new 
homes were in large tower blocks, in apartments that couldn’t have been more 
different from the neighbourhood they’d known for decades.

Some months later, journalists from the social activist group Islam Bergerak 
<http://islambergerak.com/>, the nonprofit architecture magazine Ruang 
Arsitektur <http://membacaruang.com/> and the Jakarta Post held a writing 
workshop for the evicted residents. The idea was to give them the chance to 
express their feelings about the move.

Though concerned that their criticisms would cause the government or their new 
landlords to punish them, the residents agreed to have their stories published.

The following are excerpts.

In my old age I need peace in life. I need my happiness. 

The place where I lived was identified as part of the Ciliwung River 
Normalisation Programme 
<http://citiscope.org/citisignals/2015/jakarta-aims-normalize-ciliwung-river>, 
so relocation was inevitable. But it did not seem urgent. In everyone’s minds 
here, the relocation would bring adequate compensation and benefits.

The governor had stated that everything would be compensated with money. After 
that promise, none of the residents were concerned about the displacement, even 
when the surveyor came to measure our buildings.

The fight kept going even when officers fired tear gas
Yusuf Supriyadi 
The residents were initially enthusiastic to help. Afterwards, however, 
meetings between the officials and the residents became increasingly intense. A 
committee was formed by the residents, but to no avail. The provincial 
government announced they would not pay anything to the citizens unless they 
have certificates.



I still clearly remember what happened. A crowd of people facing the Jakarta 
Public Order Agency, police and military, both sides ready to attack. The 
majority of young people were eager to defend their homes. They did not want to 
leave the place where they’d lived for decades without any compensation.

The atmosphere was tense. The fight between the groups kept going even when 
officers fired tear gas. In the end, even the innocent ones became the victims.

When it was the turn of my house , my wife could not stand it and fainted. My 
house was turned to debris.

It contained a lot of memories of my life, from my childhood to my old age. I 
had lived in that house for decades – just a normal house, like the other 
buildings at the river bank, yet I was so comfortable with it. Perhaps that is 
why it is difficult to forget.

I used to have a coffee stall in Jatinegara street. I earned a profit of 
Rp150,000 (£8) a day. I used it to pay school fees, electricity and water, and 
other household needs. I saved some money, and in 2000 I bought a house. Little 
by little, I started to repair it.

On 28 August 2014, they evicted my coffee stall along with the shops in the 
same street. I lost my livelihood.

In the kampung, we could trade freely. There were no rules. There are so many 
rules here
Iwan Setiawan 
My wife tried to open small shop at home, and I worked odd jobs: sometimes as 
a porter, and also a construction worker.

But a year after that, before I was able to find a steady job, our house was 
demolished. With resentment and sadness, we were forced to move to flats.

Living in the flat is much harder. I no longer have a job, especially as now I 
am 60 years old. Most days, I just rely on the help of my children.

I think of life in the new towers compared to our previous life in Kampung 
Pulo as like taxis compared tobajaj (rickshaw). As soon as you open the taxi 
door, the meter starts running – but with bajaj you can always bargain.

My life in the new housing is more luxurious, like in a castle. There are 
facilities for children and a suggestion box near the elevator – though it’s 
not much use.

My income has fallen sharply. In the kampung, we could trade freely. There 
were no rules. There are so many rules here.

In our previous life, we did not have to think about rent, water or 
electricity – which, of course, is now more expensive. We had a simple house, 
but we owned it – rather than a tall and luxurious building which we rent.

Now we are given a warning letter and are banned from trading in front of the 
house we live in. But the majority of Pulo’s citizens are traders!

The lift has already broken several times. My child is four years old and is 
traumatised by the lift because he experienced and saw first hand when people 
were stuck in it.

Children need a place to play outdoors, like we had in the old home, where 
they can run free. Though there are playground facilities provided by the 
organiser, they are not maintained and protected.

Even though our house was very simple and often flooded, we were comfortable 
and in peace, because we did not need to think about rent and the price of 
water. Because the water in this housing is obtained from the distillation 
process, it does not taste good and after a shower it makes my skin itchy. In 
Kampung Pulo I have never had problems like that.

Our lives are like a soccer ball, constantly kicked and passed around
Ade 
I used to lived next door to my parents but now they live downstairs. I am 
concerned about them: if they have an illness or asthma relapse, I am worried 
no one will know. I could just live with my parents, but I am already married – 
and this housing is not big enough for us if we want stay together. I have 
asked to be moved to their floor, but the manager said I cannot, even though 
there is an empty unit there. The selection process is like playing the lottery.

I am a private employee and I am grateful that I am still able to work and 
gain some money. But whereas my salary used to be enough for daily expenses and 
I still had some for savings, since my family and I moved to this housing my 
salary is used up in rent, electricity and water. If you do not pay, you get a 
warning; after a third warning letter, you will be evicted. If that happens, 
where would we stay? Would we have to live on the street?

How long will we all have to stay in this housing and pay rent? Our whole 
lifetime? The contract contains a clause stating that the use of this building 
is only for up to 20 years, and every two years we have to sign an extension. 
After 20 years, would we be moved again?

Our lives are like a soccer ball, constantly kicked and passed around.

I am a mother without any income, and being supported by two sons-in-law. But 
sometimes I also help out the neighbours. Normally everything is covered just 
like that, but now it is not enough.

Everything feels a bit formal. Children do not feel at home. Due to the lack 
of proper facilities for children to play in Rusunawa, many children go away to 
play. My 12-year-old son still likes to play in Kampung Pulo, the place where 
he lived before. After mingling with children around the towers, it seemed like 
my son can no longer be disciplined. He likes to skip school.

My house in​ Kampong​ Pulo ​didn’t leak. The house was big and we had two 
floors

 I am a sixth grade student, and I usually play in the kampung, either cooking 
games, dolls, riding bikes around with my friends.

My house in Pulo didn’t leak. The house was big and we had two floors. Even 
though there were a lot of rats, all our stuff could fit, and we did not have 
to pay for water.

Our apartment in this new housing leaks. It is small , there are a lot of 
beetles, not all of our stuff can fit in and we have to pay for water.

$40bn to save Jakarta: the story of the Great Garuda

I am a fourth grade student; my hobby is dancing and my dream is to become a 
doctor.

I have many friends and relatives in Pulo. When the excavator came, I watched 
my house be demolished. I saw it with my father. I hugged him because I was 
scared.

Why did they demolish it, what did I do wrong? I wish I could go back to Pulo. 

What would make Jakarta better, and what changes are most urgently needed?
