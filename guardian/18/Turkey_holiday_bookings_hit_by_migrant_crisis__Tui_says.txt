Summer holiday bookings to Turkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> 
have tumbled by 40% amid fighting and mass migration in neighbouring Syria, 
Tui, the owner of Thomson Holidays and First Choice, has said.

About one in seven of Tui’s customers holidayed in Turkey last summer but the 
current crisis has led tourists to opt forGreece

Turkey is particularly popular with German holidaymakers, however Tui said 
many looking for an alternative place in the sun were opting for the Caribbean.

The decline in Turkey bookings, coupled with continued weakness in north 
Africa due to terrorism in Egypt and Tunisia

, did not stop Tui reporting improved results. Underlying losses in the first 
quarter, when tour operators traditionally operate in the red, narrowed 
slightly from €104.8m (£81m) to €101.7m on sales up 5.4% to €3.7bn. Tui expects 
to report a 10% lift in underlying profit at the end of the year.

Its chief executive, Friedrich Joussen, said Tui had “delivered a good 
underlying performance in spite of the backdrop of geopolitical turbulence in 
some of our destinations”.

The UK performed slightly ahead of the rest of Tui’s business, with bookings 
for the current winter 3% higher, compared with a flat market overall. The 
contrast is even more marked for summer bookings, with the UK up 9% compared 
with a 1% increase across the company.

The UK had been partly boosted by the strength of the pound against the euro, 
Tui said.

But bookings to long-haul destinations had also improved, up 16% to 
destinations such as Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica.

disappear by 2017.
