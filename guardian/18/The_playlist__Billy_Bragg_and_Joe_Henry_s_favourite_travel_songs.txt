Billy Bragg’s choices 

2-4-6-8 Motorway – Tom Robinson Band 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMy2bmSAIeA>

One for anybody who has ever sat in the back of a transit van driving home 
from a gig 100 miles away, following their dreams down the M whatever.

Willin’ – Little Feat <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrCMlSWlDX8>

If you live on the road, you better be willing. And like the best travel 
songs, the lyrics to this make you want to visit these exotic-sounding places: 
“Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonapah.”

Promised Land – Johnnie Allan <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG8rG9RhnhY>

Chuck Berry  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/24/chuck-berry-bobby-gillespie>
wrote this tale of the “poor boy”, crossing America from Norfolk, Virginia, to 
Los Angeles by Greyhound bus, train and jet plane. Johnnie Allan’s 
Cajun-flavoured version gives us a taste of that epic swing through the south.

Talk to Me of Mendocino – Kate and Anna McGarrigle 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fcBEGjK3cM>

Some travel to work, some to play and some to find a new beginning. The 
McGarrigles fall into the latter category, packing their bags and heading west 
in the hope of better times.

Roadrunner (Once) –  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnmHgnPPkkQ>Jonathan 
Richman and the Modern Lovers <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnmHgnPPkkQ>

This hymn to the joys of driving around all night says it’s not the 
destination that is important, it’s the journey. Especially if you have the 
radio on.

Joe Henry’s choices 

Come Fly With Me – Frank Sinatra <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmQq6yLe2ww>

The ultimate travel song, perhaps, from the freewheelin’ Francis Albert 
Sinatra, who envisions that it matters not where he and his lover go, as long 
as they get gone together.

Pony – Tom Waits <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4zDaTESGvQ>

One of the saddest songs in the American songbook, sung from the perspective 
of the vagabond whose life has taken him so far away from all that informs him, 
he can’t imagine his way back. He’s clinging to blind faith and circumstance, 
and it may yet lead him on. This song is just pitiful – and gorgeous.

Wanted Man – Johnny Cash <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kHiuxn0FhI>

Rangy and lusty, this song – written for Johnny Cash  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/johnny-cash-out-among-the-stars-again>
by his young acolyte Bob Dylan, and performed at his seminal live show at San 
Quentin State prison – makes being on the run from the law (and a concerned 
mother or two) seem sexy and liberating. As a bonus, it contains one of the 
best lines of the era: “Got sidetracked in El Paso, stopped to get myself a map 
/ Came the wrong way into Juárez with Juanita on my lap.”

Sail Away – Randy Newman <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Pkt3W25I4>

Wherein a ship’s captain pitches to African natives on the pleasures of the 
new world. Bitterly revealing of this nation’s darkest impulses, and all in 
under three minutes. The same might have takenHerman Melville 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/hermanmelville> 300 pages to express.

Leaving on a Jet Plane – Peter, Paul and Mary 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc-7SnMnX78>

A confection from my youth. It has been easy to shrug off John Denver 
<http://johndenver.com/about/biography/> as a significant songwriter, given how 
soft-focus he remained while Rome was burning and Mr Jones was playing 
sword-swallower at Warhol’s Factory. Nonetheless, this is tender and deftly 
rendered.

• Shine a Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad 
<http://shinealight-joehenry.billybragg.co.uk/> is released on 23 September via 
Cooking Vinyl. Billy Bragg and Joe Henry tour the UK in November.
