 between 2007 and 2009 and returns with the Premiership title chasers having

“Initially when Welch went down we thought we would be able to ride through 
the situation with what we had,” Rob Baxter told the club’s website. “However, 
once Lees got injured we had to reassess things, not just in terms of getting 
people to play, but also to ensure we had enough bodies for training.”

The Exeter coach added: “We’ve looked at the market to see what options are 
out there and once we knew Lewis was available, we’ve worked very hard to get 
him back. Having played here before, Lewis knows the club and we know him. 
We’re very aware of the qualities he can bring to the squad and what kind of 
character he is, so he ticks a lot of boxes for us.”

Stevenson made 62 appearances for Exeter in his first spell and said Exeter 
had made huge strides on and off the pitch since. “Since I’ve left the club 
have established themselves as a real force within the Premiership and each 
year they seem to go from strength to strength. For anyone on the outside, they 
are a real example of how to get into the Premiership and stay there.”

Stevenson will join the squad in time for the Premiership trip to Worcester on 
Saturday.
