The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with 
Hardrive: Deep Inside (Shadow Child remix)

For me this is the perfect blend of old school and new school, analogue and 
digital. It always goes down well and reflects the energy I hope to sustain 
throughout my DJ sets.

The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor 
Drake ft Wizkid & Kyla: One Dance

Everyone likes a One Dance with a bottle of Hennessy in their hand! This song 
has always been a huge tune for me, of course, and I still can’t quite believe 
that it took off the way it did last year.Drake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake> got in touch with us the day before 
April Fools’ so [when he asked to use our sample] we all thought it was a hoax.

The track I wish I’d never played 
Dynamite Mc Vs TNT: Rush The DJ

Playing a track named Rush The DJ is never a good idea, schoolboy error!

The track that got me out of bed this morning 
Bleaker: Hype (Funk)

If this doesn’t get you out of bed you should probably be worried. A dose of 
Bleaker taken from the garage classic Antonio, it has a better effect than 
coffee in the morning. Pure hype!

The track that should have been a crossover hit 
Endor ft Feral Is Kinky: Fever

This tune will have your grandma body-popping in a way you didn’t think was 
even possible. Play with caution.

The ideal festival track 
Kerrier District: Techno Disco

Get on someone’s shoulders, close your eyes, throw your hands in the air and 
then, only then, will you discover your true festival inner hippy

The track I’d play at my funeral 
Common: Be (Intro)

I’d like to go out peaceful and relaxed. No EastEnders drama

 at my funeral, thanks!
