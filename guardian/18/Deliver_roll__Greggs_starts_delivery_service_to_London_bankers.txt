now orderGreggs <https://www.theguardian.com/business/greggs> pasties and steak 
bakes to their desks as the bakery chain trials a new service for London’s 
financial district.

Roger Whiteside, the Greggs chief executive, said the company was “late to the 
party” on deliveries and was also developing plans to offer a click-and-collect 
service.

It comes as the high street chain said like-for-like sales, excluding those at 
shops open for less than a year,rose by 4.2% in 2016 
<https://corporate.greggs.co.uk/>. Total sales were up 7%.


Trading was was particularly strong over Christmas, with shoppers treating 
themselves to festive bakes and mince pies. The main driver of sales was 
Greggs’ “food on the go” range, with popular items including itsBalanced Choice 
bakes

, with fewer than 400 calories, along with hot food options such as burritos.

The company said full-year results for 2016 would be better than expected 
following a positive fourth quarter, but warned of greater uncertainty in the 
year ahead as consumer budgets come under pressure and business costs rise.

Whiteside said: “We finished 2016 well, delivering our 13th consecutive 
quarter of like-for-like sales growth, and anticipate that we will report 
full-year results for 2016 slightly ahead of our previous expectations.

“Looking forward there is greater uncertainty in the trading environment with 
increased pressure on real income growth. We also continue to expect some 
industry-wide cost pressures in 2017 and these are likely to have a modest 
impact on margins in the short term.”

He said the business needed to be “mindful” of the financial pressures facing 
consumers in 2017, as disposable incomes become squeezed byhigher inflation

.

Whitesaid said that the rising cost of ingredients, the living wage, and the 
apprenticeship levy were all factors driving up business costs. Following the
sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/17/hard-brexit-fears-hit-pound-and-stocks-ahead-of-theresa-mays-speech>
, food manufacturers are facing higher costs for ingredients imported from 
abroad and for those priced in dollars.

“We’re trying to mitigate these and we have significant levers to pull. We’re 
investing in the supply chain and stores which will drive productivity higher. 
We’re still in growth mode,” he said.

As well as opening 66 net new stores in 2016, Greggs converted 208 shops to 
its “bakery food on-the-go format”, with seating and wifi. “We’ve been busy 
transforming the business from a traditional bakery business to a modern food 
on the go brand,” Whiteside said.

Greggs now has more than 1,700 shops.

Tom Berry, analyst at Verdict Retail: “Greggs’s confidence in becoming a more 
varied and appealing food service provider, increasing its threat on the likes 
of Pret a Manger and Costa, is highlighted through plans such as broadening its 
hot drinks offer to options such as vanilla latte and Fairtrade peppermint tea.

“Meanwhile, Greggs classics such as the sausage, bean and cheese melt now 
share shelf space with more innovative and on-trend lines such as Bombay potato 
bake and burritos, meeting cultural demands for different tastes and flavours.”

Greggs shares rose by almost 4% to £10.40.
