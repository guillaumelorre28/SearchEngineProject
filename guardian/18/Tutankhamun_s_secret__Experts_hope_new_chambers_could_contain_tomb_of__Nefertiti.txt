As even the least attentive school-age students of history will recall, Howard 
Carter’s discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb in 1922 was the archeological 
discovery of that century. Now a find of similar importance could be soon 
unearthed – in a chamber directly behind that of the boy king.


Radar scans of Tutankhamun’s resting place in Luxor have shown a 90% chance 
that there are two hidden chambers to the rear of it, possibly containing metal 
and organic material, according to Egypt’s antiquities minister, Dr Mamdouh 
Eldamaty.

The presence of new tombs untouched for thousands of years adjoining one of 
the most famous burial places in history would be reason enough for excitement. 
But there is speculation that inside one of the chambers could be the remains 
of Queen Nefertiti, among the wives of Tutankhamun’s father and celebrated for a
famous 3,300-year-old bust of her beautiful likeness

The scans were conducted after a theory proposed in October by the British 
Egyptologist, Dr Nicholas Reeves, speculating that beyond Tutankhamun’s chamber 
could lie the tomb of Nefertiti, who died in the 14th century BC. Some 
Egyptologists have cast doubt onReeves’s hypothesis that murals inside 
Tutankhamun’s tomb point to a much grander chamber beyond 
<http://www.academia.edu/14406398/The_Burial_of_Nefertiti_2015_>, and his 
certainty that this could only be that of Nefertiti.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Eldamaty declined to speculate on 
what might be found, saying only that the likelihood of finding a new tomb was 
now greater than his previous estimate of “67% sure”.

“We can say more than 90% that the chambers are there. But I never start the 
next step until I’m 100%. Maybe it could be the lady of the family, as Reeves 
has said,” said Eldamaty. “But I think we could find Kiya, or Ankhesenamun,” 
referring to the young pharaoh’s mother and his half-sister.

However, he did stress the apparent significance of the news: “This would be 
like having the discovery ofTutankhamun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tutankhamun> again. It could be the 
discovery of the century. It is very important for Egyptian history and for all 
of the world.”

Analysis of the fuzzy, colour radar scans, taken at the site in November by 
Japanese radar specialist Hirokatsu Watanabe showed anomalies in the walls of 
the tomb, indicating a possible hidden door and the chambers, which lay behind 
walls that were covered up and painted over with hieroglyphics.

The next step, Eldamaty said, would be to find the exact dimension of the 
chambers, as well as the thickness of the adjoining walls. This could give some 
clue as to the nature, and grandeur, of the undiscovered chambers.

This would be done with more advanced scans at the end of this month. Only 
then, Eldamaty said, could thought be given to when a team might unseal any new 
rooms.

Any find would present a boost to Egypt’s rapidly declining tourism industry, 
stymied by years of political instability and the recent downing of a plane 
carrying mostly Russian tourists in the Sinai.

“The results are fabulous. It would be nice, as Dr Eldamaty said, to be 100% 
percent sure,” said Dr Salima Ikram of the American University of Cairo. “All 
of the Egyptologists alive now have missed out on Tutankhamun, so we want our 
own Tutankhamun! We want to be there, to experience it. We’re all terribly 
excited and rooting for it containing as much as possible.”

But even the discovery of new treasures would not be the end of the debate. 
“The whole thing presents a challenge to decide what to do,” explained 
archaeologist Michael Jones, of the American Research Centre in Egypt. “If 
they’re organic and metal remains, sometimes it’s best to just leave them in 
the ground.Archaeology <https://www.theguardian.com/science/archaeology> is a 
process of controlled destruction. Unless there’s a real threat, the best thing 
might be to leave something where it is.”

Given the potential for the grave to be robbed and its contents sold on the 
illegal antiquities market, Dr Ikram disagreed. “If one knows that there’s 
something there, although in an ideal world we would leave some or all of it, 
given the fact that people know about it, I think it would be very 
irresponsible if we didn’t take the view of excavating this tomb and removing 
the material in a safe way,” she said.

Tutankhamun died aged 19 in 1324 BC after nine years on the throne. His tomb 
was discovered by Carter in November 1922 on a dig financed by a British earl, 
Lord Carnarvon. It took Carter nearly six years to excavate more than 5,000 
objects, among them the king’s sarcophagus and celebrated gold burial mask.

Artefacts from the dig have since been shown around the world, including a 
famous British Museum exhibition in 1972 which attracted 1.6 million visitors 
in nine months.

Nefertiti, whose image was immortalised in a bust now on display in a Berlin 
museum, was the primary wife of the pharaoh Akhenaten. There is some confusion 
over the order of succession, but Akhenaten was succeeded by two rulers known 
as Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten. The order in which they ruled is uncertain, 
but Neferneferuaten is thought by some to have been Nefertiti. Neither ruled 
for long, however, before Tutankhamun, who has been show by genetic testing to 
have been Akhenaten’s son, took the throne.

Tutankhamun’s tomb is in Luxor, in southern Egypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt>, the pharaonic capital in ancient 
times. Researchers are scanning four pyramids for undiscovered rooms. The 
project, given the literal name of Operation ScanPyramids, is expected to 
continue until the end of 2016.
