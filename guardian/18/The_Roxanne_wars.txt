When UTFO released a B-side chastising a woman who (unfairly in the group's 
mind) had spurned their advances, they didn't realise what they were doing.

response records followed. The most memorable was by 14-year-old Roxanne Shant√© 
who dissed the men and made this early rap battle all about the music.
