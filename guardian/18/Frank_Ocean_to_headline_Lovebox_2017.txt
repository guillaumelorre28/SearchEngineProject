Ocean released Blonde in August following a four-year hiatus after the release 
of the Grammy award-winning Channel Orange. Ocean last performed in the UK two 
years ago, and has not yet performed his new album live.

Ocean’s announcement is a major coup for the festival, whose headliners last 
year were Major Lazer and the newly reformed LCD Soundsystem. The remainder of 
the lineup will be revealed in the coming months.

Tickets are available now from the festival’s website
