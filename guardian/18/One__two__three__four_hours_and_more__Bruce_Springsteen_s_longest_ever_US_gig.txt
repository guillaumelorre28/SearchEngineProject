four minutes, breaking the previous record for the group’s longest US show set 
only last week.

The band played four hours on 30 August at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. 
Springsteen, who recentlyopened up about his battles with depression 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/07/bruce-springsteen-depression-wrecking-ball-interview>
, has built a reputation for exhaustive performances from material recorded 
over more than 40 years.

The Boss’s longest show in the world was four hours, six minutes in Helsinki, 
Finland, in 2012.

Springsteen’s 75-show US and European The River Tour wraps up with a show in 
Foxborough, Massachusetts, on 14 September.

Foxborough officials voted last week to extend its concert curfew by 15 
minutes, to 11.30pm for Springsteen.
