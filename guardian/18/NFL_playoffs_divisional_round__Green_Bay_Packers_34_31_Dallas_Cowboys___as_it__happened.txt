Final thoughts

Michael P:

Did I call this game or what.

You guessed “32-31 Green Bay” and that’s close enough for me. I think the main 
takeaway from this game is this: there’s always enough time on the clock for 
Aaron Rodgers and theGreen Bay Packers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/green-bay-packers>. I don’t think we’ve seen 
this before.

And there’s a whole another game after this, the Steelers and Chiefs are due 
to be facing each other shortly. I’ll be enjoying that, but as a mere viewer 
rather than a commentator. Thanks for following along with this liveblog, 
especially those who contributed, and continue to follow us here at the 
Guardian throughout theNFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> playoffs. 
Ciao!

Mason Crosby comes in for the 51 yard field goal attempt. His first attempt is 
good, but the Cowboys call a timeout to attempt to ice him.

So Crosby kicks again and… IT’S GOOD! IT”S GOOD! THE PACKERS WIN!

This is at the Dallas 32 and it looks like a catch to me.

Packers 31-31 Cowboys, :18, 4th quarter

Now here’s the thing: did the Cowboys leave too much time on the clock for 
Aaron Rodgers? That sounds like a joke but… it isn’t.

Packers start at their own 25. Rodgers throws incomplete to Cook. 2nd & 10, 30 
seconds left, Rodgers connects with Montgomery for 17 yards. On 1st & 10, 
Rodgers takes a 10 yard loss courtesy of Heath. Packers take a timeout. 18 
seconds left, Rodgers throws incomplete.

3rd & 30, Rodgers throws to Cook and did he manage to make the catch? The two 
officials don’t agree. We’re going under review.

Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 1:44, 4th quarter

Very next play, Montgomery gets hit by DeMarcus Lawrence for a 5 yard loss! 
That might have taken the Packers out of field goal range! The Cowboys take 
another timeout.

Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 1:48, 4th quarter

Rodgers throws the ball… AND IT’S INTERCEPTED BY JEFF HEATH AGAIN!

But there’s a flag on the play: defensive pass interference against the 
Cowboys on, Church! Wow. That negates the interception and the play will start 
at the Cowboys 35. Automatic first down. Montgomery takes the ball two yards 
and the Cowboys take a timeout.

Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 2:00, 4th quarter

The Packers take a timeout here. It’s going to be 2nd & 1. Rodgers decides to 
take the ball himself and he scrambles to the Dallas 45. That’s a gain for 5 
yards and a first down. And we are at the two minute warning!

Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 3:20, 4th quarter

Adams is on the sidelines, his return is questionable. Doctors are looking at 
his left ankle.

It’s 1st & 10 at the Green Bay 41, Rodgers hands off to Montgomery who takes 
it to midfield.

Rodgers throws to Adams, he picks up 16 yards on the play, getting to the ball 
to the Green Bay 41 but it looks like he’s hurt on the play.

@HunterFelt <https://twitter.com/HunterFelt> From afar, why do they call it a 
touchdown when the ball isn't touched down? :)#NBL17

Also: there really isn’t that much feet involved with this game. Not a lot of 
the terminology makes sense, I’ll admit.

Packers start at their own 25. Rodgers’s 1st down pass is incomplete.

Now. Can the Cowboys stop Aaron Rodgers and the Packers? Bailey’s kickoff goes 
into the end zone for a touchback. Okay let’s take a breath here everyone.

Touchdown & 2 Point Conversion! (Cowboys) Packers 28-28 Cowboys

Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 4:08, 4th quarter

1st and 10 at the Green Bay 15. Elliott gets the ball again and he takes it 
the 7. They’re almost at the door.

And on 2nd & 2, Prescott throws incomplete. 3rd & 2, still at the 7. Prescott 
throws a pass to Dez Bryant in the end zone and it’s a TOUCHDOWN!

And here’s the key part: The two point conversion. Prescott takes the ball in 
himself and he makes it into the end zone! WE HAVE A TIED GAME!

Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 5:05, 4th quarter

2nd & 10, Elliott only picks up 2 yards. 3rd & 8, the Cowboys really really 
really can’t settle for a field goal here considering the circumstances.

And they get a break, a defensive pass interference call results in an 
automatic first down!

Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 5:48, 4th quarter

Elliott picks up 12 yards this time, he’s at the 115 yard mark and he’s almost 
certainly not done.

Cowboys in shotgun, Prescott throws to Witten and all of a sudden the Cowboys 
are at the Green Bay 29.

Prescott throws deep here, taking a chance to find the end zone but it’s 
incomplete.

Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 7:34, 4th quarter

Elliott picks up 4 yards. On 2nd and 6, Prescott finds Bryant for a 15 yard 
gain to the Dallas 39. In some way or another, you figure Dez is going to 
factor into this ending.

On 1st and 10, Prescott throws to Bryant again, he gets pushed out after about 
2 yards. Elliott gets the ball next and he gets to their 49 yards and that 
looks like it’ll be a first down.

Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 9:22, 4th quarter

Pakers at their own 39. Rodgers throws incomplete. On 2nd and 10, Montgomery 
picks up 5 yards but Barry Church takes Rodgers down for a 10 yard loss and the 
Packers have to punt!

Okay now this is getting REAL interesting.

Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 10:51, 4th quarter

Michael takes the kickoff to the Green Bay 20, where they’ll start their 
drive. Rodgers throws to Cook for a 19 yard gain. Well, that’s one way to start 
a counterpunch.

Touchdown (Cowboys) Packers 28-20 Cowboys

Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 11:39, 4th quarter

Prescott gets sacked at the Green Bay 21 but it doesn’t stop his drive. He 
throws to Witten for a 15 yard gain and, in the very next play,he throws to 
Witten for a touchdown!

Two point conversion time? Nope, they play it conservative, Bailey kicks the 
extra point.

Packers 28-13 Cowboys, end of the 3rd quarter

Rodgers’ interception is so earth-shattering that it crashed my browser. In 
the meantime the Cowboys make it to the Green Bay 36 to start the 4th.

Interception!

Packers 28-13 Cowboys, 7:19, 3rd quarter

It’s 1st and 10 at the Green Bay 28. Elliott picks up 9 yards, the Packers’ 
offense can’t seem to stop him.

2nd and 1 and Prescott finally throws that interception that he’s been lucky 
to avoid to this point. Micah Hyde picks it off and takes it 18 yards to the 
Green Bay 39.

Packers 28-13 Cowboys, 8:43, 3rd quarter

Elliott goes off for a 22 yard burst that gets the crowd something to cheer 
for here. On 1st & 10, Elliott manages to eke out 4 yards.

But there’s a false start on Dallas. 2nd and 6 becomes 2nd and 11. A Prescott 
pass to Witten mangoes to just get them the first down.

Oh lord, Prescott throws an incomplete pass that was nearly intercepted. Next 
down, the Cowboys stick to running. Elliott picks up 5 yards on 2nd and 10 and 
then goes off ford 8 yards to the Green Bay 28. Their drive remains alive.

Well, their chances just took a significant hit, I’d say. They get the ball 
for the first time in the second half, starting at their own 25 here.

Touchdown (Packers) Packers 28-13 Cowboys

Packers 28-13 Cowboys, 11:25, 3rd quarter

Well this is deflating for the Cowboys. Rodgers throws a beautiful pass to 
Cook for 26 yards that puts the Packers at the Cowboys 3.

And he puts the Cowboys defense out of its misery by finding a wide open Cook 
in the end zone for a touchdown about 40 seconds later. Touchdown Green Bay! 
Crosby’s extra point is good. Utter calamity for Dallas.

Packers 21-13 Cowboys, 13:02, 3rd quarter

The Packers start at their own 25. Rodgers throws deep to Cobb for 25 yards, 
and just like that he’s at midfield.

Mongomery picks up 3 yards, Rodgers finds Adams for 4 yards. It’s another 3rd 
down situation for the Cowboys defense.

And Rodgers completes a throw to Adams for a 14 year old gain and the Packers 
are already at the Dallas 29.

this game at HT. No more stupid penalties and let's make a game of this.

Well, we’ll see if they can. First they have to stop the Packers, who get the 
ball to start the second half.

Email from Paul S.:


Who was at fault on the Seattle safety—the quarterback, of the lineman? Seems 
to me that Wilson was very close under center, and that it would be natural for 
the lineman to take one step back and plant – collision course! Aren’t there 
exact foot placements, movements, etc. that folks are taught, to prevent this 
stuff from happening? (I’d prefer to blame the veteran, not the rookie.)

Okay I’m gonna be honest here: I don’t remember a single thing that happened 
during that Seahawks game. My brain has completely blanked it out. But I always 
blame the quarterback for everything because it’s funnier when the quarterback 
screws up.

Halftime thoughts

Well it briefly looked like it was going to be a blowout but it’s starting to 
look like this could be the entertaining, high-octane offensive battle we 
thought it could be. Credit to the Dallas defense, which has started to figure 
things out at the end of the half after having absolutely no answers for 
Rodgers for the first quarter and a half.

Halftime! Packers 21-13 Cowboys

Packers 21-13 Cowboys, end of the first half

And Orlando Scandrick takes down Rodgers, it’s a loss of 9 yards. The best 
defensive sequence for the Cowboys so far in the game and definitely something 
good they can take into the locker room heading into halftime.

Packers 21-13 Cowboys, :55, 2nd quarter

1:03 is way too much time to leave on the clock for Rodgers. Bailey’s 
touchback will put the Packers at their own 25. Rodgers’s first two throws are 
incomplete, however.

Field Goal (Cowboys) Packers 21-13 Cowboys

Packers 21-13 Cowboys, 1:03, 2nd quarter

And Prescott’s 3rd and 10 throw to Witten is incomplete, partially tipped. Not 
sure about the play calling in that sequence. In any case, Dan Bailey is out 
for a 33 yard field goal attempt that cuts the Packers’ lead down to 8.

Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 1:08, 2nd quarter

Prescott throws incomplete on 1st and 10. On 2nd and 10, Prescott throws 
incomplete and the Cowboys are looking for a flag for pass interference that 
apparently isn’t to come.

It’s 3rd and 10 and the Cowboys have to desperately call their final timeout 
to avoid a delay of game penalty.

Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 1:59, 2nd quarter

It’s 3rd and 4 and Prescott finds Beasley for 18 yards before he’s absolutely 
nailed by Kentrell Brice. Yikes.

But he’s okay and, more importantly, the Cowboys are at the Green Bay 15 with 
a fresh set of downs.

Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 2:00, 2nd quarter

On 1st and 10, Elliott gets nowhere. 2nd and 10, Prescott passes to Beasley 
for a 6 yard gain and…

And we’re at the two minute warning. So hold that thought. (Gotta love those 
artificially created cliffhangers.)

Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 3:38, 2nd quarter

After a return from Schum’s short punt, the Cowboys are at their own 49. 
Prescott and Bryant connect for 5 yards, putting them in Packers territory. 
Elliott picks up 3 yards. A big 3rd down here and Elliott converts it, making 
it to the Green Bay 39.

Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 5:10, 2nd quarter

Rodgers’s pass to Adams, who may have been held on the play, is incomplete. In 
any case, the Cowboys have finally forced the Packers to bring out the punting 
unit.

Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 5:13, 2nd quarter

Another good break for Dallas. Christine Michael bobbles the ball during the 
kickoff return and recovers around the 6 yard line. That could have been a 
safety there.

Ripkowski only gets a measly yard on his first down run. Rodgers throws to 
Allison, it’s incomplete. It’s 3rd and 9 and the Cowboys are poised to finally 
stop the Packers.

But they realize they have 12 men on the field and are forced to take their 
second timeout.

At what point does Mr. Jones’s boy start warmin’ up?

I think Dez Bryant just made that question moot for the moment.

Elliott picks up 9 yards. That’s good. Then Prescott throws to Dez Bryant, who 
DEFINITELY makes this catch, putting them at the Green Bay 40!

And in the very next play, Prescott finds Bryant again, who takes it in for a 
40 yard touchdown! WE MAY HAVE A GAME! Bailey’s extra point attempt is good.

Packers 21-3 Cowboys, 7:37, 2nd quarter

Cowboys will start at their own 25 after a touchback. They really,really, 
really need to score on this possession. That’s my expert analysis.

Prescott finds Jason Witten, oh hey almost forgot about him, for 5 yards.

Rodgers throws to Adams who almost scores right then. He gets the stop at the 
1 yard line. Doesn’t matter though, on the next play Montgomery takes it in for 
his second touchdown of the game. Crosby’s extra point is good.

But the Packers’ offensive lineman David Bakhtiari was injured during the play.

Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 9:02, 2nd quarter

Packers, still in shotgun, go to work. Rodgers passes deep to Allison who gets 
to the Dallas 33. Cobb gets the Packers 2 more yards and Ripkowski goes off and 
gets the Packers all the way to the 11.

Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 10:33, 2nd quarter

On 2nd and 10, Rodgers throws to Cobb who puts up 4 yards. Can the Cowboys 
finally get a third down stop here?

Rodgers gets hit while throwing to Adams…. BUT there’s a penalty on Morris 
Claiborne. Illegal use of hands. That’s a 5 yard play and automatic first down 
and Dallas can’t even get a stop when they get a stop.

Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 11:09, 2nd quarter

So, it’s 2nd and 9 for the Packers. No biggie, Rodgers and the wonderfully 
named Geronimo Allison connect for 11 yards and it’s yet another Green Bay 
first down.

But the Cowboys defense does get to Rodgers on the next play, forcing a rare 
incompletion intended for Adams. The Packers take a timeout

Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 13:00, 2nd quarter

Aaron Rodgers is back on the field and he immediately starts making 
completions. His pass to Cook is good for 6 yards.

But, finally a break for Dallas, a false start penalty pushes the Packers back 
five yards.

Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 13:09, 2nd quarter

Elliott picks up just a hard-earned 2 yards. On 3rd down, the Packers’ defense 
get to Prescott, whose throw is incomplete. That’s the end of that. Chris Jones 
comes in to punt, pinning the Packers back at their own 20.

Crosby’s kickoff goes to the end zone. So, the Cowboys will start at their own 
25. They’re gonna need to get some points on this drive just to stay afloat it 
seems.

Prescott’s first throw is… almost picked off by Gunter. Yikes.

Michael P:

Did I call this game or what.

You guessed “32-31 Green Bay” and that’s close enough for me. I think the main 
takeaway from this game is this: there’s always enough time on the clock for 
Aaron Rodgers and theGreen Bay Packers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/green-bay-packers>. I don’t think we’ve seen 
this before.

And there’s a whole another game after this, the Steelers and Chiefs are due 
to be facing each other shortly. I’ll be enjoying that, but as a mere viewer 
rather than a commentator. Thanks for following along with this liveblog, 
especially those who contributed, and continue to follow us here at the 
Guardian throughout theNFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> playoffs. 
Ciao!
 
The Green Bay Packers <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/green-bay-packers> 
are going to play the Atlanta Falcons with a Super Bowl berth on the line! What 
an incredible game, what a crazy ending, holy heck!

Mason Crosby comes in for the 51 yard field goal attempt. His first attempt is 
good, but the Cowboys call a timeout to attempt to ice him.

So Crosby kicks again and… IT’S GOOD! IT”S GOOD! THE PACKERS WIN!

And it stands!
 
Packers 31-31 Cowboys, :18, 4th quarter

Now here’s the thing: did the Cowboys leave too much time on the clock for 
Aaron Rodgers? That sounds like a joke but… it isn’t.

Packers start at their own 25. Rodgers throws incomplete to Cook. 2nd & 10, 30 
seconds left, Rodgers connects with Montgomery for 17 yards. On 1st & 10, 
Rodgers takes a 10 yard loss courtesy of Heath. Packers take a timeout. 18 
seconds left, Rodgers throws incomplete.

3rd & 30, Rodgers throws to Cook and did he manage to make the catch? The two 
officials don’t agree. We’re going under review.
 
Packers 31-31 Cowboys, :35, 4th quarter


Prescott throws to Beasley, who picks up 7 yards. On 3rd & 3, he throws 
incomplete to Dez Bryant. It’s a 52 yard field goal attempt for Dan Bailey, who 
drills it to tie up the game!
 
Packers 31-28 Cowboys, 1:07, 4th quarter

Prescott throws to Witten who gets to the Green Bay 40. Prescott spikes the 
ball to stop the clock.
 
Packers 31-28 Cowboys, 1:33, 4th quarter

Crosby’s kickoff goes in the end zone. The Cowboys will start on their own 25. 
Prescott throws to Williams for a 24 yard gain! The Cowboys are already at 
their 49 yard line!
 
Packers 31-28 Cowboys, 1:33, 4th quarter

Rodgers’s pass on 3rd & 13 is incomplete. The Packers bring out the field goal 
unit, it’s a 56 yard attempt.

And Crosby’s kick is… JUST BARELY GOOD! The Packers take the lead!
 
Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 1:44, 4th quarter

Very next play, Montgomery gets hit by DeMarcus Lawrence for a 5 yard loss! 
That might have taken the Packers out of field goal range! The Cowboys take 
another timeout.
 
Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 1:48, 4th quarter

Rodgers throws the ball… AND IT’S INTERCEPTED BY JEFF HEATH AGAIN!

But there’s a flag on the play: defensive pass interference against the 
Cowboys on, Church! Wow. That negates the interception and the play will start 
at the Cowboys 35. Automatic first down. Montgomery takes the ball two yards 
and the Cowboys take a timeout.

Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 2:00, 4th quarter

The Packers take a timeout here. It’s going to be 2nd & 1. Rodgers decides to 
take the ball himself and he scrambles to the Dallas 45. That’s a gain for 5 
yards and a first down. And we are at the two minute warning!
 
Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 3:20, 4th quarter

Adams is on the sidelines, his return is questionable. Doctors are looking at 
his left ankle.

It’s 1st & 10 at the Green Bay 41, Rodgers hands off to Montgomery who takes 
it to midfield.
 
Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 4:04, 4th quarter

Rodgers throws to Adams, he picks up 16 yards on the play, getting to the ball 
to the Green Bay 41 but it looks like he’s hurt on the play.

Also: there really isn’t that much feet involved with this game. Not a lot of 
the terminology makes sense, I’ll admit.

Packers start at their own 25. Rodgers’s 1st down pass is incomplete.
 
Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 4:08, 4th quarter

Now. Can the Cowboys stop Aaron Rodgers and the Packers? Bailey’s kickoff goes 
into the end zone for a touchback. Okay let’s take a breath here everyone.
 
So. This might be a decent game, I think.
 
Packers 28-28 Cowboys, 4:08, 4th quarter

1st and 10 at the Green Bay 15. Elliott gets the ball again and he takes it 
the 7. They’re almost at the door.

And on 2nd & 2, Prescott throws incomplete. 3rd & 2, still at the 7. Prescott 
throws a pass to Dez Bryant in the end zone and it’s a TOUCHDOWN!

And here’s the key part: The two point conversion. Prescott takes the ball in 
himself and he makes it into the end zone! WE HAVE A TIED GAME!
 
Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 5:05, 4th quarter

2nd & 10, Elliott only picks up 2 yards. 3rd & 8, the Cowboys really really 
really can’t settle for a field goal here considering the circumstances.

And they get a break, a defensive pass interference call results in an 
automatic first down!
 
Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 5:48, 4th quarter

Elliott picks up 12 yards this time, he’s at the 115 yard mark and he’s almost 
certainly not done.

Cowboys in shotgun, Prescott throws to Witten and all of a sudden the Cowboys 
are at the Green Bay 29.

Prescott throws deep here, taking a chance to find the end zone but it’s 
incomplete.
 
Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 7:34, 4th quarter

Elliott picks up 4 yards. On 2nd and 6, Prescott finds Bryant for a 15 yard 
gain to the Dallas 39. In some way or another, you figure Dez is going to 
factor into this ending.

On 1st and 10, Prescott throws to Bryant again, he gets pushed out after about 
2 yards. Elliott gets the ball next and he gets to their 49 yards and that 
looks like it’ll be a first down.

Happy I can help. The Cowboys will start here at their 20.

 
Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 9:22, 4th quarter

Pakers at their own 39. Rodgers throws incomplete. On 2nd and 10, Montgomery 
picks up 5 yards but Barry Church takes Rodgers down for a 10 yard loss and the 
Packers have to punt!

Okay now this is getting REAL interesting.
 
Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 10:51, 4th quarter

Michael takes the kickoff to the Green Bay 20, where they’ll start their 
drive. Rodgers throws to Cook for a 19 yard gain. Well, that’s one way to start 
a counterpunch.
 
Packers 28-20 Cowboys, 11:39, 4th quarter

Prescott gets sacked at the Green Bay 21 but it doesn’t stop his drive. He 
throws to Witten for a 15 yard gain and, in the very next play,he throws to 
Witten for a touchdown!

Two point conversion time? Nope, they play it conservative, Bailey kicks the 
extra point.
 
Packers 28-13 Cowboys, end of the 3rd quarter

Rodgers’ interception is so earth-shattering that it crashed my browser. In 
the meantime the Cowboys make it to the Green Bay 36 to start the 4th.
 
Packers 28-13 Cowboys, 2:31, 3rd quarter

The Packers get all the way to the Dallas 38 and THERE IT IS, there’s Aaron 
Rodgers’s first interception! Jeff Heath intercepts a ball intended for Adams 
and takes it to the Dallas 41!
 
Packers 28-13 Cowboys, 5:19, 3rd quarter

Rodgers keeps feeding the ball to Montgomery who keeps getting the job done, 
piecing together a drive that gets the Packers to midfield.
 
Packers 28-13 Cowboys, 7:19, 3rd quarter

It’s 1st and 10 at the Green Bay 28. Elliott picks up 9 yards, the Packers’ 
offense can’t seem to stop him.

2nd and 1 and Prescott finally throws that interception that he’s been lucky 
to avoid to this point. Micah Hyde picks it off and takes it 18 yards to the 
Green Bay 39.
 

Packers 28-13 Cowboys, 8:43, 3rd quarter

Elliott goes off for a 22 yard burst that gets the crowd something to cheer 
for here. On 1st & 10, Elliott manages to eke out 4 yards.

But there’s a false start on Dallas. 2nd and 6 becomes 2nd and 11. A Prescott 
pass to Witten mangoes to just get them the first down.

Oh lord, Prescott throws an incomplete pass that was nearly intercepted. Next 
down, the Cowboys stick to running. Elliott picks up 5 yards on 2nd and 10 and 
then goes off ford 8 yards to the Green Bay 28. Their drive remains alive.

Well, their chances just took a significant hit, I’d say. They get the ball 
for the first time in the second half, starting at their own 25 here.
 
Packers 28-13 Cowboys, 11:25, 3rd quarter

Well this is deflating for the Cowboys. Rodgers throws a beautiful pass to 
Cook for 26 yards that puts the Packers at the Cowboys 3.

And he puts the Cowboys defense out of its misery by finding a wide open Cook 
in the end zone for a touchdown about 40 seconds later. Touchdown Green Bay! 
Crosby’s extra point is good. Utter calamity for Dallas.
 
Packers 21-13 Cowboys, 13:02, 3rd quarter

The Packers start at their own 25. Rodgers throws deep to Cobb for 25 yards, 
and just like that he’s at midfield.

Mongomery picks up 3 yards, Rodgers finds Adams for 4 yards. It’s another 3rd 
down situation for the Cowboys defense.

And Rodgers completes a throw to Adams for a 14 year old gain and the Packers 
are already at the Dallas 29.

Well, we’ll see if they can. First they have to stop the Packers, who get the 
ball to start the second half.

 
Email from Paul S.:


Who was at fault on the Seattle safety—the quarterback, of the lineman? Seems 
to me that Wilson was very close under center, and that it would be natural for 
the lineman to take one step back and plant – collision course! Aren’t there 
exact foot placements, movements, etc. that folks are taught, to prevent this 
stuff from happening? (I’d prefer to blame the veteran, not the rookie.)

Okay I’m gonna be honest here: I don’t remember a single thing that happened 
during that Seahawks game. My brain has completely blanked it out. But I always 
blame the quarterback for everything because it’s funnier when the quarterback 
screws up.

I 100% agree with this sentiment.

 
Halftime thoughts

Well it briefly looked like it was going to be a blowout but it’s starting to 
look like this could be the entertaining, high-octane offensive battle we 
thought it could be. Credit to the Dallas defense, which has started to figure 
things out at the end of the half after having absolutely no answers for 
Rodgers for the first quarter and a half.

 
Packers 21-13 Cowboys, end of the first half

And Orlando Scandrick takes down Rodgers, it’s a loss of 9 yards. The best 
defensive sequence for the Cowboys so far in the game and definitely something 
good they can take into the locker room heading into halftime.

 
Packers 21-13 Cowboys, :55, 2nd quarter

1:03 is way too much time to leave on the clock for Rodgers. Bailey’s 
touchback will put the Packers at their own 25. Rodgers’s first two throws are 
incomplete, however.

 
Packers 21-13 Cowboys, 1:03, 2nd quarter

And Prescott’s 3rd and 10 throw to Witten is incomplete, partially tipped. Not 
sure about the play calling in that sequence. In any case, Dan Bailey is out 
for a 33 yard field goal attempt that cuts the Packers’ lead down to 8.

 
Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 1:08, 2nd quarter

Prescott throws incomplete on 1st and 10. On 2nd and 10, Prescott throws 
incomplete and the Cowboys are looking for a flag for pass interference that 
apparently isn’t to come.

It’s 3rd and 10 and the Cowboys have to desperately call their final timeout 
to avoid a delay of game penalty.
 
Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 1:59, 2nd quarter

It’s 3rd and 4 and Prescott finds Beasley for 18 yards before he’s absolutely 
nailed by Kentrell Brice. Yikes.

But he’s okay and, more importantly, the Cowboys are at the Green Bay 15 with 
a fresh set of downs.
 
Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 2:00, 2nd quarter

On 1st and 10, Elliott gets nowhere. 2nd and 10, Prescott passes to Beasley 
for a 6 yard gain and…

And we’re at the two minute warning. So hold that thought. (Gotta love those 
artificially created cliffhangers.)
 
Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 3:38, 2nd quarter

After a return from Schum’s short punt, the Cowboys are at their own 49. 
Prescott and Bryant connect for 5 yards, putting them in Packers territory. 
Elliott picks up 3 yards. A big 3rd down here and Elliott converts it, making 
it to the Green Bay 39.
 
Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 5:10, 2nd quarter

Rodgers’s pass to Adams, who may have been held on the play, is incomplete. In 
any case, the Cowboys have finally forced the Packers to bring out the punting 
unit.
 
Packers 21-10 Cowboys, 5:13, 2nd quarter

Another good break for Dallas. Christine Michael bobbles the ball during the 
kickoff return and recovers around the 6 yard line. That could have been a 
safety there.

Ripkowski only gets a measly yard on his first down run. Rodgers throws to 
Allison, it’s incomplete. It’s 3rd and 9 and the Cowboys are poised to finally 
stop the Packers.

But they realize they have 12 men on the field and are forced to take their 
second timeout.
 
Michael P:


Subject: Romo time

At what point does Mr. Jones’s boy start warmin’ up?

I think Dez Bryant just made that question moot for the moment.

Elliott picks up 9 yards. That’s good. Then Prescott throws to Dez Bryant, who 
DEFINITELY makes this catch, putting them at the Green Bay 40!

And in the very next play, Prescott finds Bryant again, who takes it in for a 
40 yard touchdown! WE MAY HAVE A GAME! Bailey’s extra point attempt is good.
 
Packers 21-3 Cowboys, 7:37, 2nd quarter

Cowboys will start at their own 25 after a touchback. They really,really, 
really need to score on this possession. That’s my expert analysis.

Prescott finds Jason Witten, oh hey almost forgot about him, for 5 yards.

Rodgers throws to Adams who almost scores right then. He gets the stop at the 
1 yard line. Doesn’t matter though, on the next play Montgomery takes it in for 
his second touchdown of the game. Crosby’s extra point is good.

But the Packers’ offensive lineman David Bakhtiari was injured during the play.
 
Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 9:02, 2nd quarter

Packers, still in shotgun, go to work. Rodgers passes deep to Allison who gets 
to the Dallas 33. Cobb gets the Packers 2 more yards and Ripkowski goes off and 
gets the Packers all the way to the 11.
 
Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 10:33, 2nd quarter

On 2nd and 10, Rodgers throws to Cobb who puts up 4 yards. Can the Cowboys 
finally get a third down stop here?

Rodgers gets hit while throwing to Adams…. BUT there’s a penalty on Morris 
Claiborne. Illegal use of hands. That’s a 5 yard play and automatic first down 
and Dallas can’t even get a stop when they get a stop.

 
Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 11:09, 2nd quarter

So, it’s 2nd and 9 for the Packers. No biggie, Rodgers and the wonderfully 
named Geronimo Allison connect for 11 yards and it’s yet another Green Bay 
first down.

But the Cowboys defense does get to Rodgers on the next play, forcing a rare 
incompletion intended for Adams. The Packers take a timeout
 
Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 13:00, 2nd quarter

Aaron Rodgers is back on the field and he immediately starts making 
completions. His pass to Cook is good for 6 yards.

But, finally a break for Dallas, a false start penalty pushes the Packers back 
five yards.

 
Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 13:09, 2nd quarter

Elliott picks up just a hard-earned 2 yards. On 3rd down, the Packers’ defense 
get to Prescott, whose throw is incomplete. That’s the end of that. Chris Jones 
comes in to punt, pinning the Packers back at their own 20.
 
Packers 14-3 Cowboys, 14:05, 2nd quarter

Crosby’s kickoff goes to the end zone. So, the Cowboys will start at their own 
25. They’re gonna need to get some points on this drive just to stay afloat it 
seems.

Prescott’s first throw is… almost picked off by Gunter. Yikes.
