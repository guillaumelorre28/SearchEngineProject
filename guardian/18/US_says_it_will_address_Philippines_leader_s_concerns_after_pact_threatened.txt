President Rodrigo Duterte <https://www.theguardian.com/world/rodrigo-duterte> 
was enraged after a US government aid agency deferred a vote on a renewal of a 
major development assistance package for the Philippines over concerns about 
extrajudicial killings in Duterte’s war on illegal drugs, which has left 
thousands dead.

This week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-personally-killed-criminals>
, Duterte said he used topersonally kill suspected criminals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-personally-killed-criminals>
 when mayor of Davao city. Senators subsequently said that admission was 
grounds forimpeachment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/philippines-senators-duterte-impeached-killing-confession>
. Duterte saidhe would continue his crackdown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/16/duterte-vows-to-continue-war-on-drugs-after-killing-confession>
 on drug dealers and users.

Although no decision on the aid package has been taken, Duterte on Saturday 
launched an expletives-laden tirade, telling the US to “prepare to leave the 
Philippines, prepare for the eventual repeal or the abrogation of the Visiting 
Forces Agreement”.

He was referring to a 1998 accord that governs American forces visiting the 
Philippines for joint combat exercises. The pact has helped the Philippines 
contain a violent Muslim insurgency in the south and train and equip Filipino 
forces facing an assertive China in disputed South China Sea waters.

“You know, tit for tat … if you can do this, so [can] we. It ain’t a one-way 
traffic,” Duterte said, adding tauntingly: “Bye-bye America.”

The US embassy in Manila said in a statement that Washington would work 
closely with the Duterte administration to address any concerns it may have. It 
did not elaborate.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but 
spokesman Josh Earnest has said the White House will not react publicly each 
time Duterte makes an offhand remark.

The 71-year-old Duterte, who describes himself as a leftwing politician, has 
made similar threats since taking office in June but he and his officials have 
walked back many of his public statements, causing confusion.

While calling Americans “sons of bitches” and “hypocrites”, Duterte on 
Saturday praised China as having “the kindest soul of all” for offering what he 
said was significant financial assistance.

“So what do I need America for?” he asked.

He also said Russia could be a very important ally.

“They do not insult people, they do not interfere,” he said.

The Philippines had been slated for another aid package after its previous 
five-year, $434m poverty reduction program was successfully completed in May 
under Duterte’s predecessor, Benigno Aquino III.

A spokeswoman for the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Laura Allen, said on 
Thursday it would continue to monitor events in the Philippines before the next 
board review in March 2017.

The US decision is among the first signs of how concerns about the rule of law 
and human rights under Duterte could entail economic costs.

The US government, along with European Union and United Nations officials, has 
raised concerns about Duterte’s crackdown on illegal drugs, which has leftmore 
than 2,000 suspected drug users and dealers dead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/philippines-secret-death-squads-police-officer-teams-behind-killings>
 in purported gun battles with police.

More than 3,000 other deaths are being investigated to determine if they were 
linked to illegal drugs.

At a news conference in his southern home town of Davao, Duterte was asked on 
Saturday how many crime suspects he killed himself while he was a crime-busting 
city mayor. The former government prosecutor again gave contrasting replies.

“Maybe one, two, three … I’m saying, maybe my bullets hit them, maybe not, but 
after the burumbumbumbum, they’re all dead,” Duterte said.

Replying to another question, he said that he indeed had killed personally, 
but did not provide details and tried to justify his act.

“When I tell you now that I killed, do not term them as suspects because all 
of them died while they were fighting government people,” he said.

He asked God for forgiveness in advance, saying he may not have time to pray 
if he’s assassinated.

“God, forgive me for killing these idiots,” Duterte said, before blaming God 
for the presence of criminals.

“You create a human monster, so if you are God, why do you have to create 
these idiots? That’s why they die.”

Earlier this month, Duterte said he had spoken to the US president-elect, 
Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/03/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-donald-trump-white-house-invite>
, who he said approved of his war on drugs.
