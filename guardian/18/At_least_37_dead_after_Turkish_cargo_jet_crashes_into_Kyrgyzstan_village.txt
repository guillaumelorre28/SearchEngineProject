A Turkish cargo jet has crashed near Kyrgyzstan’s Manas airport, killing at 
least 37 people, most of them residents of a village struck by the Boeing 747 
as it tried to land in dense fog, Kyrgyz officials have said.

According to the airport’s administration, the plane was supposed to make a 
stopover at Manas, near the capital city, Bishkek, on its way from Hong Kong to 
Istanbul. It crashed when trying to land in poor visibility at 7.31 am (0131 
GMT).

The plane ploughed on for a few hundred metres through the Dachi Suu village, 
home to hundreds of families. It shattered into pieces and damaged dozens of 
buildings.

Plumes of smoke rose above the crash site, with some mudbrick buildings razed 
to the ground and others pierced by parts of the plane.

The torn-off tail assembly, rotated upside down, towered above a one-storey 
house. The area nearby was completely levelled and covered with twisted pieces 
of metal.

Locals said they had thought at first the area had been struck by an 
earthquake.

“Around seven o’clock in the morning I heard a strong [noise] and after that 
all the nearest houses were shaken,” said Andrei Andreyev. “Of course, everyone 
got frightened and started to run out of the houses to the street.

“Nobody understood what was going on because there was a fog, the weather was 
not good.”

Initial estimates put the death toll from the crash at 37, according to 
Kyrgyzstan’s emergencies ministry. The Kyrgyz president, Almazbek Atambayev, 
announced that Tuesday would be a national day of mourning.

Turkish Airlines said the cargo flight was operated by ACT Airlines and 
neither the aircraft nor the crew belonged to Turkish Airlines. ACT Airlines 
confirmed the Boeing 747-400 was its plane.

“Our TC-MCL signed plane, flying on Jan 16 from Hong Kong to Bishkek, crashed 
on landing at Bishkek at the end of the runway for an unknown reason,” ACT 
Airlines said in an emailed statement.

“More information will be disclosed concerning our four-person team when we 
get clear information.”
