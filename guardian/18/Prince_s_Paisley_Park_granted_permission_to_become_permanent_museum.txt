, meaning it now no longer needs special permission to admit the public.

For the last month, Paisley Park has been open for a limited number of public 
tours, on the basis of temporary permits granted by the council to Bremer 
Trust, which is running the property. The new vote followed a review of traffic 
and pedestrian safety.

Paisley Park will open to the public on 28 October and tickets for tours from 
now until mid-December areon sale via the museum’s website 
<https://www.officialpaisleypark.com/tickets>. Visits to the site include 
self-guided tours of the main floor of Paisley Park, Prince’s video editing 
suites and rehearsal rooms and the musician’s private NPG Music Club. The tour 
lasts an average of 70 minutes and costs $38.50 (£31.50) plus a $7.50 service 
charge.

Also on display at the museum is the urn containing Prince’s ashes, which is a 
scale model of Paisley Park measuring 14 inches high and 18 inches long, 
decorated with Prince’s symbol.
