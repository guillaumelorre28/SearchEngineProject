A source at the Bishkek police told AFP that the Mitsubishi Delica car smashed 
a gate on the embassy before blowing up in the centre of the compound, close to 
the ambassador’s residence.


Another source with the Central Asian nation’s security service said an 
“explosive device” had been placed inside the vehicle.

Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, said China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> was deeply shocked by the “extreme 
and violent attack”.

“We are demanding that Kyrgyzstan find out the truth rapidly and punish [those 
responsible],” she told a press conference in Beijing.

Asked whether other Chinese diplomatic facilities had stepped up security 
measures following the attack, Hua said: “We attach great importance to the 
safety of Chinese personnel abroad. We have always taken protective measures to 
ensure the safety of Chinese personnel overseas.”


Blame for Tuesday’s attack is likely to fall on militants from the Uighur 
ethnic minority who are waging what some describe as a low intensity insurgence 
against Chinese rule across the border in the Chinese region of Xinjiang.

Raffaello Pantucci, the director of international security studies at the 
Royal United Services Institute, said Kyrgyzstan had a large Uighur community 
and that Uighur militants were the “obvious candidates” for the bombing. “It 
certainly would stack up in many ways,” he said.

Pantucci, a Xinjiang expert, said the attack appeared to have specifically 
targeted the Chinese embassy, which is in an isolated compound outside the 
centre of Bishkek. “The Chinese embassy isn’t exactly in the heart of town,” he 
pointed out.

China has been waging what it calls a “people’s war on terror” in the restive 
western region since 2014, when Uighur extremists launched attacks on 
civilians, includingthe bombing of a street market in Urumqi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/22/china-urumqi-car-bomb-attack-xinjiang>
, Xinjiang’s capital.

That war has seen dozens killed and many thousands detained 
<http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/01/23/xinjiang-arrests-nearly-doubled-in-14-year-of-strike-hard-campaign/>
 on terrorism charges.

“[We must] make terrorists become like rats scurrying across a street, with 
everybody shouting ‘beat them!’,” President Xi Jinping declared last year.

However, critics accuse China of responding to the attacks with a campaign of 
fear, harassment and repression in Xinjiang. They argue that rather than simply 
targeting terror groups, authorities have instead launcheda frontal assault on 
conservative Islam

.

Critics of the crackdown believe it is breeding even greater resentment 
against Chinese rule that is likely to fuel further bloodshed.

Pantucci said there was no significant history of attacks on Chinese interests 
in Central Asia but there did seem to be a growing trend of such incidents 
around the globe.

As well as Tuesday’s attack, the academic pointed to the deadly 2015 bombing 
of Bangkok’s Erawan Shrine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/17/bangkok-rocked-by-explosion-at-busy-road-junction>
, which was a popular destination for Chinese tourists.

“If we take that [Thailand attack] and we take this – if it proves to be 
linked to Uighur militants – you are seeing a problem which is really starting 
now to export itself globally … that really lived in southern Xinjiang and then 
spread across the province, then spread across the country, and now is showing 
up globally.

“You are dealing with a problem that is metastasising negatively in a way that 
is really quite worrying.”
