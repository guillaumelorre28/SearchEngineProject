, while smaller rivalImagination Technologies rose 11.4p to 220.7p after it 
unveiled a series of collaborations with major technology companies, including 
Oracle and Broadcom.

Overall the FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down 0.48 points at 
6820.56, following a mixed picture from the latest PMI surveys, with good 
results from China and the US, a poor one from France and a reasonable one from 
the eurozone as a whole. Global tensions, in Ukraine, Thailand and Korea, also 
unsettled investors. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said:
 The FTSE 100 endured something of a seesaw day, hopping between gains and 
losses, but the overall impression has been of a market in a more relaxed frame 
of mind than was the case earlier in the week. Chinese data, which when 
positive always provides a useful tonic, provided support for the mining 
sector, rallying on hopes of increased consumption and helping to allay fears 
about weaker growth. 
SABMiller climbed 112.5p to £33.72 after it announced a 1% rise in full year 
profits to $6.45bn, and unveiled a new cost cutting programme to save $500m a 
year by 2018.

As IG noted, mining shares were boosted by the positive Chinese data, with 
Antofagasta adding 15p to 786p and Fresnillo 15.5p better at 845p.

Smith and Nephew rose 20p to 956p after UK competition authorities cleared its 
proposed $1.7bn acquisition of Texas-based medical devices business ArthoCare.

.

Royal Dutch Shell B shares slid 95p to 2456.5p after it agreed to sell its 
100% interest in 106,000 acres of oil and gas properties in Texas to Sanchez 
Energy for $639m. It has also decided to scrap its scrip dividend.

Retailer Halfords accelerated to the top of the FTSE 250, up 46.6p to 488p 
after strong demand for cycles in the final quarter - up 41.6% - helped boost 
full year sales by 7.9% and profits by 1.1% to a better than expected £72.8m.

But a number of other mid-cap companies fell sharply after their updates.

Dairy Crest dropped 32.1p to 427.9p despite a 31% rise in full year profits to 
£65.3m. Investors were concerned about the outlook, with the company saying 
higher costs would reduce profits in its milk business in the current year. 
Traders also pointed out that last year's profits including property sales and 
lower financing costs.

Polymetal, the Russian gold and silver miner, fell 32.5p to 510.5p after 
agreeing to pay $618.5m for a gold project in Kazakhstan.

And Electrocomponents lost 8.4p to 280.6p after the electronic products 
distributor reported just 2% growth in sales for the first seven weeks of its 
financial year after full year profits rose 7.4%. Analysts at Jefferies said:
 2014 results were exactly in line with consensus but revenue momentum has 
been softer than expected at the start of the new year and strategic 
initiatives required to drive growth continue to weigh on profitability. We 
downgrade 2015 earnings per share by 6%. Hold.
