Martin Schulz, the head of the European parliament, has announced he is 
leaving EU politics to seek a seat in the German Bundestag, fuelling 
speculation that he could enter the race to challenge Angela Merkel in next 
year’s federal elections.


The Social Democrat will stand for the party in his native North 
Rhine-Westphalia in the 2017 general election and is almost guaranteed a seat 
in the German parliament as head of the SPD list for the region.

As European parliament president, Schulz helped create the mood music of 
Brexit, calling for theBritish government to act swiftly on its decision 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/top-eu-leader-we-want-britain-out-as-soon-as-possible>
 to leave the European Union.

Born near the German-Belgian-Dutch border, he has also been a staunch defender 
of the EU’s principle of free movement of people, insisting it cannot be 
compromised as part of any single market deal. “I refuse to imagine a Europe 
where lorries and hedge funds are free to cross borders but citizens cannot,” he
said

 recently.


He had served an unprecedented two terms at the head of the parliament but was 
considered unlikely to win a third when a reshuffle of top positions begins in 
January.

In Germany, he has been mooted as either a potential replacement for the 
foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier,who is set to swap his current job 
for the presidency next February

, or even the candidateto challenge Angela Merkel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/20/angela-merkel-expected-stand-for-re-election-germany>
 for the chancellorship at the elections in September 2017.

Sigmar Gabriel, currently deputy chancellor in Germany’s coalition government, 
and Hamburg mayor Olaf Scholz are seen as other potential challengers. The SDP 
plans to announce its candidate in late January.

Schulz’s departure is unlikely to have any impact on Brexit negotiations, 
however. The next European parliament president, expected to be drawn from the 
dominant centre-right group, will almost certainly stick to the same red lines. 
Guy Verhofstadt, the parliament’s Brexit negotiator, will also ensure 
continuity.

Speculation over Schulz’s future has been running high since Jean-Claude 
Juncker, the president of the European commission, argued that his friend 
should lead the parliament until 2019 to guarantee stability. Juncker’s 
intervention infuriated MEPs by flouting a deal that the presidency should pass 
to the centre right.


Following European elections in 2014, senior MEPs agreed, in line with 
tradition, that the presidency of the parliament would be shared between the 
parliament’s two largest groups: the centre-right European People’s party and 
the Socialists. As Schulz’s two and a half year term came to a close, there was 
growing anxiety he would tear up the agreement. Senior EPP MEPs had sworn to 
oppose him if he attempted to stay.


Schulz, a former bookseller who was first elected to the European parliament 
in 1994, said it had not been an easy decision to go. He vowed to continue 
fighting for the EU in national politics.

The frontrunner to succeed him will become clear in December, when the 
European parliament holds elections to choose a candidate. France’s Alain 
Lamassoure and Ireland’s Mairead McGuinness are seeking the centre-right 
nomination. MEP Antonio Tajani, an ally of Silvio Berlusconi, who was Italy’s 
European commissioner, is also expected to throw his hat into the ring.

Smaller groups attacked the “backroom stitchup” that guarantees the presidency 
passes between the two largest groups. Syed Kamall, the British Conservative 
who leads a Eurosceptic centre-right group, said Schulz’s departure was an 
opportunity for MEPs to rethink how they choose their president.

“With the figurehead of the European parliament’s backroom dealing now 
leaving, the grand coalition should seriously ask if its conduct is increasing 
or undermining people’s perceptions of the European parliament,” he said. His 
group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, announced that Belgian MEP 
Helga Stevens would be their candidate for president.


But with pro-EU MEPs holding two-thirds of the seats, it is unimaginable that 
a Eurosceptic could win.


The parliament’s 751 MEPs, including the 73 MEPs from Britain and Northern 
Ireland, will elect the new president in January.

But the next president could make life difficult for the British MEPs who 
chair influential committees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/14/britains-meps-ushered-quietly-off-stage-as-the-eu-show-goes-on>
. The positions of Claude Moraes, the Labour chair of the civil liberties 
committee, and Vicky Ford, the Conservative who leads the single market, are 
under threat in the January reshuffle.

Committee chairs can serve a five-year term, but the halfway reshuffle is a 
chance to clear the decks. Some MEPs have been pressing for Britain to 
relinquish these influential positions, now the UK is on the way out.
