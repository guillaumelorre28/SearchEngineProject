I don’t always play the same tune, but this has been doing the trick recently. 
It’s basically a slightly cheesier version of La Mezcla by Michel Cleis, which 
I also hammered, but you can’t deny its energy!

The track that currently gets the most rewinds

Don’t think I’ve ever done a rewind in a set, but this probably deserves one.

The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes

For when it gets really nasty.

The track that got me out of bed this morning

This used to be my alarm as well.

The track I wish I’d never played

Things got out of hand when I played a 10-hour set in Melbourne recently and 
ended up playing this rave tune, which was maybe a bit much. But I don’t regret 
any tracks I play, even if they go down shit, because I wouldn’t play them if I 
didn’t love them.

The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding 
Girls On Top: I Wanna Dance With Numbers

I’d play this thinking it’s a cool balance of cheesy classic and electronic, 
but I’d probably just end up spoiling the wedding.

The ideal festival track

Not just because it’s mine, it’s honestly been my biggest track all year.

The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza

I’d been saving tracks for a sunset set at Café Mambo this summer, but it 
didn’t work out. Hopefully I’ll get to play this there next summer!

Planning songs for my own funeral is one step too far! But I’d go with this.
