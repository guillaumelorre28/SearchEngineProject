Harriet Sherwood raises some interesting questions, but misses a fundamental 
point (Christmas challenge for vicars with multiple challenges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/22/christmas-highlights-pressure-church-of-england-stretched-rural-clergy>
, 23 December). England’s amazing collection of historic rural churches should 
not be viewed as a liability or a burden. Rather, we should celebrate the 
existence of such a vast and beautiful array of capital assets, unique in the 
world and of incomparable historic, social and indeed economic value. Key to 
their revival is the application of fresh ideas and energy, from which funding 
and footfall can and do follow. As your author notes, diversification of 
purpose is essential. Prior to the late 19th century, churches served as 
multi-purpose centres of activity, both secular and spiritual, social and 
civic. Our post-Victorian narrowness of vision has in many ways caused the 
decline of popular usage.

The Churches Conservation Trust <https://www.visitchurches.org.uk/> has 
demonstrated many innovative and practical models of working among our 350 
exemplar church buildings. Rather than decry the communities who fail to 
attend, CCT moves that in an increasingly atomised, digital society, the 
existence of genuinely democratic, accessible spaces, welcome to all, is more 
necessary than ever.
