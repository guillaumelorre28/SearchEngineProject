the RFU over a possible breach of concussion management protocol.

A panel will examine a 30th-minute incident in Sale’s 29-26 Premiership defeat 
atHarlequins <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/harlequinsru> in which the 
back-row TJ Ioane appeared to be concussed but remained on the pitch and 
completed the match.

The investigation comes less than a month after Northampton were the subject

Ioane took a hit to the head while tackling the Harlequins hooker Dave Ward at 
The Stoop but groggily returned to his feet and resumed play without receiving 
any medical treatment.

The incident was not picked up by the member of Sale’s medical team appointed 
to look for instances of concussion during the match, with the assistance of TV 
replays.

“A concussion management review group panel will convene to examine an 
incident in the 30th minute of the match between Harlequins and Sale on 7 
January, involving Sale player TJ Ioane,” an RFU statement read.

“The RFU and Premiership Rugby have appointed Dr Julian Morris to be the 
independent chairman and will be joined by the RFU’s director of professional 
rugby, Nigel Melville, and Phil Winstanley, the rugby director at Premiership 
Rugby.

“A joint RFU/Premiership Rugby update will be provided in seven days and until 
that time no further comment will be made.”
