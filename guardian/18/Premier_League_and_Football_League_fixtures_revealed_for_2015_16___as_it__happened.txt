Dates for the diary

Now then, I shall be signing off shortly but here are a few important dates 
for the diary.

19 September – After winning their opening five matches with consumate ease, 
Arsenal sink away to Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho pokes Arsene Wenger in the 
eye.

21 November – After defeat to Manchester City, Brendan Rodgers is heard 
begging in vain to FSG, ‘please don’t make me redundant’.

28 December – Arsenal 11-0 Bournemouth – the Gunners embark on a long winning 
run but fail to contest the title race after a dismal autumn. Bournemouth are 
relegated.

23 April – Tottenham 1-0 West Brom – Harry Kane scores his first goal of the 
season for mid-table mediocrity’s Spurs.

15 May – The final day of the season. Liverpool wrap up the title after Jurgen 
Klopp revives the Reds. Brendan Rodgers keeps popping in but refuses to phone 
ahead. Tottenham finish sixth to book another season in the Europa League. 
Nigel Pearson descends on his final press conference of the season armed to the 
teeth with explosives.

As you’re digesting all these lovely fixtures, let’s keep in mind that the 
transfer window does not slam shut – it never closes or slips off the latch – 
until four rounds of matches have been played. The sharper ones among you will 
know that means some players could play against a club they subsequently played 
for. Comprende? Anywho, here’s The Rumour Mill:

In all this excitement we haven’t yet touched upon the fact that Manchester 
City 0-0 Chelsea in on the second weekend, currently 15 August but don’t be 
surprised to see it shifted to the Sunday. Other early matches likely to get 
the ‘AND IT’S LIVE’ treatment includeArsenal v Liverpool, currently scheduled 
for 22 August,Manchester United v Liverpool, currently scheduled for 12

How rude of me. In reeling off the key derbies, I overlooked the south coast 
showdown. Southampton host Bournemouth on 31 October and Dean Court will open 
his front door and welcome the Saints on 1 March.

Yet again Spurs are away on the opening day (or Sunday), with the other North 
London team (also yet again) at home. Spurs have played away on the opening day 
more than any otherPremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> club. This goes beyong 
mere coincidence; it has to be cynically deliberate. At least the last two 
years we played in London - now it's Old Trafford!

More derby news for you now.

Burnley’s relegation back into the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> means their fans can once 
again look forward to another east Lancashire clash with Blackburn on 25 
October. Prior to March 2014, the Clarets had not defeated their bitter rivals 
in 35 years and Danny Ings, the man who delivered that long-awaited victory, 
has already moved on this summer. They do still have manager Sean Dyche, 
though, and he is unbeaten in his four derby games - indeed Burnley would have 
won their last two games at Ewood Park were it not for an offside, 
stoppage-time equaliser from David Dunn in 2013.

The fixture list anoraks out there will be aware that the fixture list always 
contains the quirk of one fixture being returned as it were, a lot sooner than 
it feels like it should. This year it appears to be 28 December and 6 February. 
That is all.

Ever wondered how the fixture list is decided in Germany? Wonder no more.

Here in Germany the fixtures are arranged in such a way that the second half 
of the season is the reverse of the first half. For example if Stuttgart plays 
the first game of the season at home to say Bremen, the first game after the 
winter break is Bremen versus Stuttgart. This is a much fairer system as it 
means that teams only have 2 home games and 2 away games in succession 
throughout the season. Why can't they do this in England?

Plenty of comments coming in about Manchester United’s run-in – oh the 
optimism of you Red Devils. After heading to Tottenham to the reverse of their 
opening day fixture (I told you everyone plays everyone twice) they faceAston 
Villa (H), West Ham (A), Leicester (H), Norwich (A) and Bournemouth (H).

October however, is not so straightforward looking. Trips to the Emirates, 
Goodison Park, a bogey ground somewhat, are followed by the first Manchester 
derby of the season on 24 October.

Champions Chelsea begin their campaign against Swansea who will swan up the M4 
all the way to Stamford Bridge.

Swan down the M4, surely?

I mean, they will actually go upwards and downwards on their travels along the 
M4, but their destination is more southern than their starting point.

Let’s cherry pick a few Bournemouth fixtures for you now. After hosting Aston 
Villa they’re off to Anfield a week later while Manchester City 7-1 Bournemouth 
is scheduled for 17 October and Bournemouth 1-0 Manchester United is on 12 
December.

It’s worth remembering of course that a lot of these dates will change when BT 
Sport and Sky Sports have had their say but, just for a little while, let’s 
close our eyes, pretend that every match is 3pm kick-off on Saturday and 
imagine tuning in on the wireless.
 Bournemouth start at home to Aston Villa, before a visit to Liverpool.

Now, as previously mentioned, plenty of thought goes into compiling these 
fixtures lists but spare another for Carlisle supporters who will be travelling 
in their 10s to Plymouth on 18 August, a midweek fixture, which is a 780-mile 
round-trip is the longest away journey in the entire Football League.

Liverpool fans, still scarred by that 6-1 defeat to Stoke and facing the 
prospect of returning on the opening day can at least take solace from the fact 
that they won’t have to go there on a wet and windy Wednesday. They cannot 
however, take any solace from their first seven away fixtures that readsStoke, 
Arsenal, Manchester United, Everton, Tottenham, Chelsea, Manchester City. 
Brutal.

Back to the Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>
 then now we’ve caught our breath, and how about those fixtures then? All 20 
teams, play everyone, twice. Of course, some teams fare better than usual on 
the opening day – Chelsea for example, have not lost in their last 12 home 
fixtures on the curtain-raising weekend. Have a peak of this little graphic to 
see how this season’s 20 measure up.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> at the end of the 2013/14 
season, begin life in the bottom tier with new boss Ian Hendon coming up

League One fixtures

Here’s a quick take from the wires, we will of course revisit in bucketloads 
more detail.

Wigan’s attempt to bounce back from last season’s relegation starts with a 
2015-16 opening-day trip toCoventry. The Latics have suffered two relegations 
in three years following a lengthy stay in thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> and Gary Caldwell will be 
hoping his men can get off to a winning start at the Ricoh Arena on 8 August.

Nigel Adkins’ reign at Sheffield United begins with a lengthy trip to 
Gillingham, while Burton’s first ever game in the third tier starts with a 
visit of Scunthorpe.Millwall and Blackpool, who also suffered the drop last 
season, head toShrewsbury and Colchester respectively, while promoted sides Bury
 andSouthend also hit the road to face Doncaster and Fleetwood. 
There are local derbies as Crewe host Port Vale and Chesterfield welcome 
Barnsley, while Swindon hope to bounce back from last season’s play-off final 
defeat by seeing offBradford at home. 


Walsall’s home clash with Oldham and Rochdale against Peterborough complete 
the opening-day line-up.

Premier League fixtures announced

Starting the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> then. Champions Chelsea 
begin their campaign againstSwansea who will swan up the M4 all the way to 
Stamford Bridge.

Manchester United host Tottenham in what, at first glance, is the most 
mouthwatering fixture – Louis van Gaal facing the team he says he nearly joined.


And Liverpool, without Steven Gerrard of course, are back at the Brit, hoping 
to avenge their 6-1 drubbing byStoke on the final day of the season. Tasty!

DING! DING! DING!

The fixtures for the 2015-16 English domestic season are out, and it’s 
official, everyone plays everyone … twice! Right, I’m going to run through this 
very briefly league by league, encompassing the opening days, before we really 
get down to the nitty gritty of Accrington’s difficult November period.

An interesting point raised by vagnerhate in the comments, but who will it be 
against and where? My money is on a Saturday lunchtime collapse at The 
Hawthorns.

I'm really looking forward to when Arsenal's title challenge collapses this 
year. Last year it was matchday 5, I believe.

What with everyone playing everyone … twice, it is of course, the opening 
day’s fixtures that often grab the most attention. Who will Bournemouth, riding 
the crest of the promotion wave, pinch a 1-1 draw off on the first weekend? 
Where will José Mourinho show off his mahogany summer tan on w/e starting 8 
August? Who fancies a trip to the Hive to face Barnet, now restored to the 
Football League of course?

But there are other fixtures to keep us occupied. The official fixture list 
will probably say that Stoke will play Sunderland only twice but to these eyes, 
it always seems to happen roughly 17 times a season, often ending goalless, 
almost always the penultimate slot on MOTD. We’ll keep abreast of that as well 
as thecrucial festive period, the make or break Easter timetable, the already 
thinking about the beachfinal weekend matches etc. Stay tuned, not long to go 
now …

Now then. As the minutes tick by it’s worth pausing for a brief moment to 
ponder just how these fixtures lists are compiled. Balls plucked from buckets 
by former pros out of work and effectively touting themselves for managerial 
vacancies? No. Monkeys with typewriters? Nope. The whims of Messrs Mourinho and 
Wenger? Of course not. It’s far more complicated than that, it takes into 
account Nottingham’s Goose Fair and uses the kind of matrixes, algorithms, 
trigonometry, alegbra, adding up etc that would make of mockery of Spider 
Solitaire, on the hardest difficulty – as the Guardian’s very own James Riach 
found out last year.

When the Premier League and Football League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league> fixtures for 2013-14 are 
announced at 9am on Wednesday, spare a thought for the individuals involved in 
compiling the season’s schedule.

“I don’t think people realise what goes into it,” says the Football League 
fixtures officer, Paul Snellgrove. “They think names go into a hat and it’s 
almost like a draw. Because it’s so difficult to explain it’s hard to keep 
people’s attention.”

A laborious process that begins four years ahead of each season, when Fifa and 
Uefa set out their international schedules, goes through a raft of complex 
stages before the final fixture list is signed off.

Preamble

Hello world! It’s the day you’ve all been waiting for. It’s the second most 
exciting day of the year, after Pancake Day. It’s been a whopping 24 days since 
the end of the Premier League, which marked the end of the domestic football 
season, the FA Cup final notwithstanding. Those football addicts out there, 
feeding off the scraps of the Copa America, the Women’s World Cup, the 
Champions League final and Euro 2016 snoozefests, are due for their next big 
hit. It’s almost time for the full fixture lists for thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>, Championship, League One 
and League Two … AND IT’S LIVE!

Full fixture lists will be announced at 9am. Lest we forget, everyone will 
play everyone …twice!!!

That just about wraps things up from me but make this your first, second and 
third port of call for all things fixtures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-fixtures-2015-16> as plenty more 
will be added as the day progresses. As ever, thanks very much for reading, 
posting your comments and your emails and tweets. Cheerio!

Now then, I shall be signing off shortly but here are a few important dates 
for the diary.

19 September – After winning their opening five matches with consumate ease, 
Arsenal sink away to Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho pokes Arsene Wenger in the 
eye.

21 November – After defeat to Manchester City, Brendan Rodgers is heard 
begging in vain to FSG, ‘please don’t make me redundant’.

28 December – Arsenal 11-0 Bournemouth – the Gunners embark on a long winning 
run but fail to contest the title race after a dismal autumn. Bournemouth are 
relegated.

23 April – Tottenham 1-0 West Brom – Harry Kane scores his first goal of the 
season for mid-table mediocrity’s Spurs.

15 May – The final day of the season. Liverpool wrap up the title after Jurgen 
Klopp revives the Reds. Brendan Rodgers keeps popping in but refuses to phone 
ahead. Tottenham finish sixth to book another season in the Europa League. 
Nigel Pearson descends on his final press conference of the season armed to the 
teeth with explosives.
 
As you’re digesting all these lovely fixtures, let’s keep in mind that the 
transfer window does not slam shut – it never closes or slips off the latch – 
until four rounds of matches have been played. The sharper ones among you will 
know that means some players could play against a club they subsequently played 
for. Comprende? Anywho, here’s The Rumour Mill:

Football transfer rumours: Chelsea move for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain?

The fixtures being released is actually quite boring isn't it?
 
Oh how we must all hope for some sweet September rain. West Ham v Newcastle is 
on 12 September. Slaven Bilic v Steve McClaren – part-time rockstar v Wally 
with a Brolly 2.0.
 
In all this excitement we haven’t yet touched upon the fact that Manchester 
City 0-0 Chelsea in on the second weekend, currently 15 August but don’t be 
surprised to see it shifted to the Sunday. Other early matches likely to get 
the ‘AND IT’S LIVE’ treatment includeArsenal v Liverpool, currently scheduled 
for 22 August,Manchester United v Liverpool, currently scheduled for 12 
September andChelsea v Arsenal, currently scheduled for 19 September.
 
How rude of me. In reeling off the key derbies, I overlooked the south coast 
showdown. Southampton host Bournemouth on 31 October and Dean Court will open 
his front door and welcome the Saints on 1 March.
 
Heathcote is a Tottenham supporter and Heathcote smells a rat.

Yet again Spurs are away on the opening day (or Sunday), with the other North 
London team (also yet again) at home. Spurs have played away on the opening day 
more than any otherPremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> club. This goes beyong 
mere coincidence; it has to be cynically deliberate. At least the last two 
years we played in London - now it's Old Trafford!
 
Craig Wood has been in touch, and one gets the feeling he’s a Hammer. Wham of

More derby news for you now.

Burnley’s relegation back into the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> means their fans can once 
again look forward to another east Lancashire clash with Blackburn on 25 
October. Prior to March 2014, the Clarets had not defeated their bitter rivals 
in 35 years and Danny Ings, the man who delivered that long-awaited victory, 
has already moved on this summer. They do still have manager Sean Dyche, 
though, and he is unbeaten in his four derby games - indeed Burnley would have 
won their last two games at Ewood Park were it not for an offside, 
stoppage-time equaliser from David Dunn in 2013.
 
The fixture list anoraks out there will be aware that the fixture list always 
contains the quirk of one fixture being returned as it were, a lot sooner than 
it feels like it should. This year it appears to be 28 December and 6 February. 
That is all.
 
Ever wondered how the fixture list is decided in Germany? Wonder no more.

Here in Germany the fixtures are arranged in such a way that the second half 
of the season is the reverse of the first half. For example if Stuttgart plays 
the first game of the season at home to say Bremen, the first game after the 
winter break is Bremen versus Stuttgart. This is a much fairer system as it 
means that teams only have 2 home games and 2 away games in succession 
throughout the season. Why can't they do this in England?
 
And here is the long list of all 380 Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> matches for the 2015-16 
season in which everyone plays everyone, twice.

On the topic of derbies, the two North London clashes are on 7 November at the 
Emirates and 5 March at White Hart Lane.

The Merseyside showdowns are 3 October at Goodison and 27 February at Anfield.

The Tyne-Wear tussles are 24 October at the Stadium of Light and 19 March at 
St James’.
 
Plenty of comments coming in about Manchester United’s run-in – oh the 
optimism of you Red Devils. After heading to Tottenham to the reverse of their 
opening day fixture (I told you everyone plays everyone twice) they faceAston 
Villa (H), West Ham (A), Leicester (H), Norwich (A) and Bournemouth (H).

October however, is not so straightforward looking. Trips to the Emirates, 
Goodison Park, a bogey ground somewhat, are followed by the first Manchester 
derby of the season on 24 October.
 
CIAAH has made an interesting point, I was always under the impression that 
one travelled ‘up’ to London. Seeing as I’m from London, I’m going to say I’m 
probably right …

Champions Chelsea begin their campaign against Swansea who will swan up the M4 
all the way to Stamford Bridge.

Swan down the M4, surely?

I mean, they will actually go upwards and downwards on their travels along the 
M4, but their destination is more southern than their starting point.

(Reading and Hull) have both opened with a home win. Unfazed.

Let’s cherry pick a few Bournemouth fixtures for you now. After hosting Aston 
Villa they’re off to Anfield a week later while Manchester City 7-1 Bournemouth 
is scheduled for 17 October and Bournemouth 1-0 Manchester United is on 12 
December.

It’s worth remembering of course that a lot of these dates will change when BT 
Sport and Sky Sports have had their say but, just for a little while, let’s 
close our eyes, pretend that every match is 3pm kick-off on Saturday and 
imagine tuning in on the wireless.

Now, as previously mentioned, plenty of thought goes into compiling these 
fixtures lists but spare another for Carlisle supporters who will be travelling 
in their 10s to Plymouth on 18 August, a midweek fixture, which is a 780-mile 
round-trip is the longest away journey in the entire Football League.
 
As promised, here’s the full story on the Championship

Liverpool fans, still scarred by that 6-1 defeat to Stoke and facing the 
prospect of returning on the opening day can at least take solace from the fact 
that they won’t have to go there on a wet and windy Wednesday. They cannot 
however, take any solace from their first seven away fixtures that readsStoke, 
Arsenal, Manchester United, Everton, Tottenham, Chelsea, Manchester City. 
Brutal.
 
Publicans around the country, I strongly advise you to order an extra barrel 
or two for early October.

Back to the Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>
 then now we’ve caught our breath, and how about those fixtures then? All 20 
teams, play everyone, twice. Of course, some teams fare better than usual on 
the opening day – Chelsea for example, have not lost in their last 12 home 
fixtures on the curtain-raising weekend. Have a peak of this little graphic to 
see how this season’s 20 measure up.

1 - Watford's last season in the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> started at Everton in 
2006/07. Spooky.

And likewise with League Two:

Teddy Sheringham’s managerial career gets under way as his Stevenage side 
welcomeNotts County on the opening day. The former England international 
replaced Graham Westley at Broadhall Way as he dips his toe into management for 
the first time aged 49 and Ricardo Moniz’s relegated Magpies provide the 
opposition on 8 August.

Leyton Orient, who were 45 minutes away from the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> at the end of the 2013/14 
season, begin life in the bottom tier with new boss Ian Hendon coming up 
against his former clubBarnet, winners of the Vanarama Conference last season. 


Fellow promoted side Bristol Rovers, back in the Football League after a year 
away, hostNorthampton while Paul Cook’s Portsmouth reign begins with the visit 
ofDagenham. There is a West Country derby as relegated Yeovil head to Exeter, 
Terry Butcher begins life atNewport with a trip to Cambridge and Derek Adams’ 
reign atPlymouth starts with a trip to AFC Wimbledon. 

Hartlepool host Morecambe, Mansfield welcome Carlisle and Crawley, looking to 
bounce back from relegation last season, start atOxford. Wycombe’s clash with 
York completes the opening day programme.
 
Here’s a quick take from the wires, we will of course revisit in bucketloads 
more detail.

Wigan’s attempt to bounce back from last season’s relegation starts with a 
2015-16 opening-day trip toCoventry. The Latics have suffered two relegations 
in three years following a lengthy stay in thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> and Gary Caldwell will be 
hoping his men can get off to a winning start at the Ricoh Arena on 8 August.

Nigel Adkins’ reign at Sheffield United begins with a lengthy trip to 
Gillingham, while Burton’s first ever game in the third tier starts with a 
visit of Scunthorpe.Millwall and Blackpool, who also suffered the drop last 
season, head toShrewsbury and Colchester respectively, while promoted sides Bury
 andSouthend also hit the road to face Doncaster and Fleetwood. 
There are local derbies as Crewe host Port Vale and Chesterfield welcome 
Barnsley, while Swindon hope to bounce back from last season’s play-off final 
defeat by seeing offBradford at home. 


Walsall’s home clash with Oldham and Rochdale against Peterborough complete 
the opening-day line-up.
 
I’ll also have the full season’s fixtures for you shortly, but for those of 
you who cannot wait that long,here it is in full 
<http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2015-16/jun/170615-fixture-list-for-2015-2016-season-released.html>
.

As feared, Stoke and Sunderland are only playing each other twice …
 
League One champions Bristol City kick-off at currently managerless Sheffield 
Wednesday, runners-upMK Dons go to Rotherham and play-off winners Preston play 
host toChampionship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> 
play-off losersMiddlesbrough.

Paul Clement’s time at Derby will begin at Bolton, while Marinus Dijkhuizen’s 
time atBrentford starts at home to Ipswich. Elsewhere on the opening day 
Birmingham host Reading, Wolves go to Blackburn, Cardiff are at home to Fulham 
andNottingham Forest make the trip to Brighton.

I’ll have the full story on the Championship for you shortly, but in the 
meantime, read these interesting words:

Tuesday 18 August sees the meeting of two former Real Madrid assistant 
managers in the shape of Derby’s Clement and Middlesbrough’s Aitor Karanka.

QPR do not have to go far when the Championship kicks off on the same weekend 
as thePremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>, 
although they’ll probably a Friday night match – the Hoops travel toCharlton 
whileBurnley and Hull, start away at Uwe Rosler’s Leeds and at home to 
Huddersfield respectively.
 
Here is the full story of the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> fixtures – Hugo Lloris to 
face his former club on the opening weekend perhaps?

Fellow newcomers Watford and new manager Quique Sanchez Flores are at Everton 
while play-off winnersNorwich host Crystal Palace in a Championship-looking 
fixtures if ever there was one.

Elsewhere, Manchester City start out on the road at West Brom, Newcastle host 
Southampton andLeicester and Sunderland have booked themselves the final MOTD 
slot with their 0-0 draw at the King Power Stadium.
 
Aston Villa have been dealt a trip to the seaside on the opening weekend – 
they have the honour of beingBournemouth’s first ever Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> opponents while Arsenal 
kick things off against Slaven Bilic’sWest Ham at the Emirates.
 
Starting the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> then. Champions Chelsea 
begin their campaign againstSwansea who will swan up the M4 all the way to 
Stamford Bridge.

Manchester United host Tottenham in what, at first glance, is the most 
mouthwatering fixture – Louis van Gaal facing the team he says he nearly joined.


And Liverpool, without Steven Gerrard of course, are back at the Brit, hoping 
to avenge their 6-1 drubbing byStoke on the final day of the season. Tasty!

The fixtures for the 2015-16 English domestic season are out, and it’s 
official, everyone plays everyone … twice! Right, I’m going to run through this 
very briefly league by league, encompassing the opening days, before we really 
get down to the nitty gritty of Accrington’s difficult November period.
 
Following on from the last post, who will secure those lucky post-Europa 
League Thursday trips to White Hart Lane? Whose April capitulation at Carrow 
Road will spark the unlikeliest of survival surges from the Canaries? On what 
day in February will Hartlepool finally win away?
 
An interesting point raised by vagnerhate in the comments, but who will it be 
against and where? My money is on a Saturday lunchtime collapse at The 
Hawthorns.

I'm really looking forward to when Arsenal's title challenge collapses this 
year. Last year it was matchday 5, I believe.
 
What with everyone playing everyone … twice, it is of course, the opening 
day’s fixtures that often grab the most attention. Who will Bournemouth, riding 
the crest of the promotion wave, pinch a 1-1 draw off on the first weekend? 
Where will José Mourinho show off his mahogany summer tan on w/e starting 8 
August? Who fancies a trip to the Hive to face Barnet, now restored to the 
Football League of course?

But there are other fixtures to keep us occupied. The official fixture list 
will probably say that Stoke will play Sunderland only twice but to these eyes, 
it always seems to happen roughly 17 times a season, often ending goalless, 
almost always the penultimate slot on MOTD. We’ll keep abreast of that as well 
as thecrucial festive period, the make or break Easter timetable, the already 
thinking about the beachfinal weekend matches etc. Stay tuned, not long to go 
now …

 
Now then. As the minutes tick by it’s worth pausing for a brief moment to 
ponder just how these fixtures lists are compiled. Balls plucked from buckets 
by former pros out of work and effectively touting themselves for managerial 
vacancies? No. Monkeys with typewriters? Nope. The whims of Messrs Mourinho and 
Wenger? Of course not. It’s far more complicated than that, it takes into 
account Nottingham’s Goose Fair and uses the kind of matrixes, algorithms, 
trigonometry, alegbra, adding up etc that would make of mockery of Spider 
Solitaire, on the hardest difficulty – as the Guardian’s very own James Riach 
found out last year.

When the Premier League and Football League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league> fixtures for 2013-14 are 
announced at 9am on Wednesday, spare a thought for the individuals involved in 
compiling the season’s schedule.

“I don’t think people realise what goes into it,” says the Football League 
fixtures officer, Paul Snellgrove. “They think names go into a hat and it’s 
almost like a draw. Because it’s so difficult to explain it’s hard to keep 
people’s attention.”

A laborious process that begins four years ahead of each season, when Fifa and 
Uefa set out their international schedules, goes through a raft of complex 
stages before the final fixture list is signed off.

Hello world! It’s the day you’ve all been waiting for. It’s the second most 
exciting day of the year, after Pancake Day. It’s been a whopping 24 days since 
the end of the Premier League, which marked the end of the domestic football 
season, the FA Cup final notwithstanding. Those football addicts out there, 
feeding off the scraps of the Copa America, the Women’s World Cup, the 
Champions League final and Euro 2016 snoozefests, are due for their next big 
hit. It’s almost time for the full fixture lists for thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>, Championship, League One 
and League Two … AND IT’S LIVE!

Full fixture lists will be announced at 9am. Lest we forget, everyone will 
play everyone …twice!!!
