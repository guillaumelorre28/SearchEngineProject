 this afternoon as there is at the two jumps meetings at Ayr and Exeter put 
together, and with heavy ground prevailing at the Scottish track, the Sunbury 
venue is probably the one to focus on.

Dutch Art Dealer (3.05) is an obvious choice in the seven-furlong handicap, 
having recorded a comfortable success on his first start for Ivan Furtado at 
Newcastle at couple of weeks ago. He has a hold-up running style that can 
sometimes get him into trouble, but the six-year-old was a winner off a mark of 
87 a couple of seasons ago and is a very solid bet at around 3-1 racing off 86.

Tomily (3.40) also catches the eye in the most valuable race on the card. 
Richard Hannon’s runner put up a couple of very strong performances in defeat 
at the end of last season, and does not have much to find on that form to give 
Sutter County, the likely favourite, plenty to think about. At the prices on 
offer – 6-1 versus 13-8 for the market leader – he is an obvious bet.

Squire (4.10) does not win very often but looks like a very big price at 
around 16-1 in the one-mile handicap half an hour later, having run well to 
finish second over this course and distance last time out.

Tred Softly (4.40) is up against a big field but should be good enough to 
emerge in front, and a similar comment applies toLate Shipment (1.30) in the 
17-runner handicap hurdle at Exeter.Bramble Brook (3.15) is another to consider 
on the same card, while if there is a bet to be had at Ayr, it is probablyPlus 
Jamais (3.30) in the handicap chase.
