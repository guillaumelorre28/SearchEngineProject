Tim Sherwood <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tim-sherwood> has been 
appointed director of football at Swindon Town. The former Tottenham Hotspur 
and Aston Villa manager had been linked with the manager’s job at QPR but has 
instead moved to the League One strugglers and was presented to the media on 
Thursday afternoon.

The 47-year-old played with the Robins chairman, Lee Power, at Norwich City 
and had previously sent players to the County Ground on loan while at Tottenham.

Sherwood told a press conference: “I’ve had other offers but it’s an 
interesting project I’ve had a close eye on for four years since I started 
loaning players to this club. I’ve had a lot of discussions with a lot of clubs 
but I’m happy to be sat here. Luke Williams [the head coach] is at this club 
because of me, he was my recommendation. I came across him in a development 
phase of the game and I recommended him to Lee. He is a very good coach and has 
a lot more to come.

“I am coming here to help out. I think it needs tweaking, possibly the style 
of play at times, sometimes we might need to flip the page a bit. I think I can 
give him a helping hand in that. Let’s make sure we stay in the league and 
start climbing up the table.

“I’ve got a soft spot for this club. It was a club who developed a lot of 
Tottenham players who have gone on to big-money moves, Ryan Mason and Alex 
Pritchard.”

Williams will remain Swindon’s head coach, with Sherwood expecting to be in 
the stands on match days. Swindon are fourth bottom inLeague One
