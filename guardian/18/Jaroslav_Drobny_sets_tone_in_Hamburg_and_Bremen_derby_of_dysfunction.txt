“Drobo, Drobo,” the khal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khal_Drogo> – sorry, 
the call – went from the stands. Hamburg fans took care to acknowledge a former 
favourite, goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny, on his return to the Volksparkstadion in 
the green and white of Werder Bremen. Before crossing theNord-Derby divide this 
summer, the 37-year-old had spent the previous six years with die Rothosen, 
mostly left to his own devices by an array of bumbling defenders, forced to 
pick hundreds of balls out of his net with the dignified desolation of a man 
scouring piles of discarded betting slips for a forgotten winner.

On Saturday, though, Drobny was the enemy, a traitor for moving 128km down the 
A1 to the Weserstadion, and the “Drobo” chants were designed to hurt not 
please. Every nervous touch of the Czech stopper was accompanied by the 
gleeful, sarcastic repetition of his nickname by the home supporters. Markus 
Gisdol’s players knowingly targeted their former team-mate – “probably the 
worst footballing keeper of the league,” according toWelt – whenever he tried 
to kick the ball. The strategy paid off, instantly.

One of Drobny’s miscued clearances went straight into touch and indirectly led 
to Hamburg’s early opener, a header from Michael Gregoritsch from the ensuing 
throw-in in the third minute. Since silly mistakes at the back soon became the 
main theme of the afternoon, as Fin Bartels (14th minute), Gregoritsch (28th 
minute) and Serge Gnabry (45th minute) traded goals that owed a lot to 
defenders absent-mindedly stepping out of the way or being precisely in the 
wrong place at the right time.

Drobny, a “constant source of disquiet,” as the Hamburg tabloid MoPo put it, 
never quite recovered from his early blunder, even if he didn’t follow up with 
another decisive mishap. The Werder coach Alexander Nouri’s explanation for 
preferring the veteran to the equally accident-prone Felix Wiedwald for the 
must-win game against their fellow strugglers –Hamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> and Werder were 18th and 16th in 
the table, respectively, before their 105th meeting – sounded as unconvincing 
as his team’s defensive performance had looked on the whole. “We chose Jaro to 
provide stability with his presence, personality and experience,” Nouri said. 
“The way he saved the shot from [Filip] Kostic – we all thought the ball was in 
but he got there.”

Drobny did make a couple of decent saves to ultimately rescue a point for the 
visitors but in the end the 2-2 draw only exposed the glaring deficiencies of 
both teams. The first half, especially, had brought one of those immensely 
shambolic, wonderfully diverting matches that theBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> used to produce every 
single week before clevergegenpressing became the leitmotiv in the current 
decade. It’s no coincidence that the demise of the big two up north started 
when their natural rivals and many other, lesser-endowed clubs developed 
collective playing systems based on a strong collective ethos. Hamburg’s and 
Werder’s enduring individualism – the idea that a couple of big-name heroes can 
lift you above the mundane – amounts to a multi-season-ticket for relegation 
strife. They haven’t had a functioning system or team for years now, only a 
series of under-qualified coaches and over-extended star players who are 
revered as saviours.

The 68th minute substitution of Gnabry, Werder’s best player of the season and 
most important goalscorer (five goals in as many away games), was emblematic of 
the cult of personality that has substituted good sense: Gnabry’s replacement 
Claudio Pizarro, the 38-year-old demigod, on the pitch by popular demand, was 
not quite up to speed and unable to swing the tide Bremen’s way. Werder can now 
add a “Torwartproblem” (Weser-Kurier) to their long list of worries, as neither 
Drobny nor Wiedwald inspire any real confidence. Thirty-one goals conceded in 
12 games are reminiscent of the stinky, defensively incontinent Thomas Schaaf 
days, early improvements after Viktor Skripnik’s dismissal back in September 
have vanished amid the realisation that the men at Nouri’s disposal lack the 
necessary quality to achieve anything near a clean sheet.

“You can’t win any games defending the way we do,” the captain Clemens Fritz 
said. “We served up the two goals on a silver platter for them.” Hamburg were 
just as accommodating at the other side of the pitch. “We were a little 
careless,” HSV coach Markus Gisdol said generously, in an effort to protect 
“the tender shoots” of progress he had witnessed.

Going forward, Hamburg did indeed almost look like a normal Bundesliga side, 
thanks to the energetic Gregoritsch, who nearly scored a hat-trick that would 
have made the best answer to a quiz question for years to come. Following his 
header and successful left-footed shot to make it 2-1, the Austrian had a 
chance to score a third goal – without a boot on. He was carrying it in his 
hand, having lost it in a challenge by Philipp Bargfrede, he was primed for 
eternity (“I thought: if I score now, I go down to history”) but, alas, the 
ball never reached him. Shame. (The goal would have stood. Playing on without 
shoes or shin pads after losing either accidentally is allowed under the latest 
version of the Laws of the Game).

The result was just about enough to keep Hamburg, bottom of the table with 
four meagre points, “alive,” as Gregoritsch said. It was greeted by the 55,000 
fans in the ground – two hundred Werder ultras had been kept away under the 
flimsiest of pretences by the Hamburg police – by concerned silence rather than 
jubilation or anger, however. Whether the self-styledBundesliga-Dino (dinosaur) 
can soon return to a more comfortable existence is doubtful, while the 
situation off the pitch remains as fraught with vagaries as Johan Djourou’s 
thought-process. Under-fire sporting director Dietmar Beiersdorfer will be 
allowed to stay in office for a little longer which is another way of saying 
that the club’s dysfunctional leadership structure, with investor Klaus-Michael 
Kühne calling the shots over the heads of the board, will persist. Gisdol’s 
green shoots will do extremely well to grow into anything substantial on such 
uneven, barren ground.

Results: Freiburg 1-4 Leipzig, Gladbach 1-1 Hoffenheim, Köln 0-0 Augsburg, HSV 
2-2 Bremen, Ingolstadt 1-1 Wolfsburg, Frankfurt 2-1 Dortmund,Bayern 2-1 Bayer 
Leverkusen, Schalke 3-1 Darmstadt, Hertha 2-1 Mainz.

Talking points

• “In Bavaria, we are democrats – so there’s no need for an opposition,” the 
great Gerhard Polt once observed. The bon mot came to mind as 98.5% of Bayern 
Munich club members re-elected Uli Hoeness as president on Friday night. A 
total of 108 no-voters were shouted down as self-important irritants. Polt 
again: “We in Bavaria are a democracy that forces no one to become a minority. 
Everybody has the right to avow themselves part of the majority.” Hoeness, 64, 
had looked apprehensive during his pre-vote address to the 5,000-strong crowd 
in the Audi Dome, with 2,000 more in an adjacent tent. How many would turn 
against him after his conviction for tax evasion and jail sentence? He promised 
to work “seven days a week for Bayern”, admitted a “terrible mistake” and 
recalled “crying like a puppy dog” in his cell. But soon enough, the old 
bravado reappeared. Hoeness, officially not involved in the day-to-day running 
of the football club, a plc controlled by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, left no one in 
doubt that his opinion will be heard, inside and outside Säbener Strasse.

League leaders RB Leipzig, who temporarily stretched the gap to six points 
with a 4-1 win at SC Freiburg that evening, were gently needled (“they were 
watching on the sofa while we played Champions League”) and welcomed as a 
“serious rival”, while an overhaul of the academy system was named a priority. 
In addition, Hoeness appeared markedly less convinced by the idea of Philipp 
Lahm as a future sporting director and vowed to ensure that Bayern would meet 
their “social responsibility”. It’ll be interesting to see how that can be 
squared with another winter trip to Qatar in January, among other things.

On the pitch, it was hard to discern any positive effect from the comeback of 
“Mr Bayern”. Carlo Ancelotti’s team were rather laboured and ultimately lucky 
to win a tightly contested game against Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 on Saturday 
evening, courtesy of a Mats Hummel header from an improvised corner (“I was 
supposed to take it short but no one came,” Joshua Kimmich said) and Javi 
Martínez saving a goal-bound Kevin Volland header with his right arm, without 
anyone relevant noticing. “If it’s a penalty, it’s penalty,” Leverkusen 
sporting director Rudi Völler grumbled. “Football isn’t that complicated 
sometimes.”

• Thomas Tuchel might not agree but his mood was darker still. The BVB coach 
blamed “a (complete) technical, tactical and mental deficit” for Borussia’s 2-1 
defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt. “Today’s performance, from the first to the last 
minute, didn’t deserve a single point,” the 43-year-old added. The harshness of 
the manager’s criticism betrayed plenty of tension behind the scenes as his 
young team struggle to play to the exacting standards of a manager remarkably 
low on patience.

• While Frankfurt and Hertha continue to outperform relative to their squad 
strength, Schalke 04 are slowly beginning to look like the decent, well 
put-together team that many had expected to see under new leaders Markus 
Weinzierl and Christian Heidel this season. The Royal Blues showed resilience 
to bounce back from going a goal down early at home to Darmstadt, the 3-1 
result prolonged a run of 12 games without defeat in all competitions and seven 
wins in a row. Next up for the eighth-placed side is a trip to Leipzig – for a 
clash between tradition and artifice.
