Subway riders around the world might have noticed something missing when their 
fellow transit users went trouserless on Sunday for the annual no pants subway 
ride.

Participants were told to get on trains and act as they normally would and 
were given an assigned point to take off their pants. They are asked to keep a 
straight face and respond matter-of-factly to anyone who asks them if they’re 
cold.

The event, organised by the Improv Everywhere comedy collective, started in 
2002 inNew York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> with just seven 
participants.

“We want to give New Yorkers a reason to look up from their papers, from their 
phones, and experience something that’s a little different than their average 
run-of-the-mill stuff,” said Jesse Good, one of the event’s organisers.

Moments before entering a Manhattan station, Peter Saez said it was his third 
time going pant-less. “People who don’t understand what we’re doing will look 
at us like we’re doing something bad or wrong,” Saez said. “It’s just for fun. 
It’s a fun trip, that’s all.”

Toni Carter planned on stripping down to her tight boxers with little 
polka-dots. “Not very often do I have an opportunity with a group of people to 
take my pants off and show it whatever I got to show,” Carter said. “I’m 
entertaining New York City. This is my form of art.”

Wei Wei, a student from China who just moved to New York, was curious about 
the event but was on the fence about whether she was going to go through with 
taking off her pants. But there was no hesitation for Angela Bancilhon, a 
tourist from Australia who had her husband and two young sons along for the 
ride. “It’s fun. Why the hell not?” Bancilhon said. “We’re in NYC. Why wouldn’t 
you?”
