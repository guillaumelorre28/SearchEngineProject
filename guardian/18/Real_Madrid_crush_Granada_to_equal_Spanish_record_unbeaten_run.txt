Benzema tapped in Real’s second in the 20th minute after Ochoa failed to hold 
a shot from the lively Luka Modric, before Cristiano Ronaldo struck his 11th 
league goal of the season by nodding in a left-wing cross from Marcelo.

Isco turned in a low cross from Modric to stretch Real’s lead in the 31st 
minute, and defensive midfielder Casemiro scored his first goal of the season 
by stabbing in at the far post from James Rodríguez’s free kick in the 58th 
minute.
