Kick Out the Jams (Kick Out the Jams, 1969)
Rocket Reducer #62 (Rama Lama Fa Fa) (Kick Out the Jams, 1969)
Kick Out the Jams was the MC5’s own mantra. Not for themselves – they were 
sure they could kick out the jams – but for the bands who came to Detroit. The 
Five had been playing together for four years by the time they released their 
debut LP on Elektra, with rhythm section of Michael Davis and drummer Dennis 
“Machine Gun” Thompson providing the combination of fluidity and solidity that 
allowed guitarists Wayne Kramer and Fred “Sonic” Smith to soar and singer Rob 
Tyner to wail. Playing in and around Detroit for so long gave the band an 
understanding of both each other and of what the hardest rocking crowd in the 
US demanded. So when the big-name bands came through town, usually to headline 
the Grande Ballroom, the MC5 were there waiting to be impressed. They rarely 
were, and would shout their derision at the visitors: “We got in the habit, 
being the sort of punks we are, of screaming at them to get off the stage, to 
kick out the jams, meaning stop jamming,” Kramer said. Kick out the jams, 
motherfuckers, kick out the jams!

 Given the chance to commit their own live set to vinyl for their debut, the 
MC5 slightly botched the opportunity. They rambled where they should have 
attacked, and without the spectacle of the band throwing themselves around the 
stage, there was little to distract from the brutal plod ofMotor City Is Burning
 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFqxMhmI3iw> or I Want You Right Now 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG8WhjH6KmU>. But when they got it right, they 
got it completely right. And on Rocket Reducer they got it right: they didn’t 
just have the rock, they had the roll, too.

Tonight (Back in the USA, 1970)
The American Ruse (Back in the USA, 1970)
The MC5’s second album ought to be one of the all-time classics. The 
songwriting is taut and focussed. The revolutionary message is harnessed to 
sleek and concise vehicles modelled on the speed and brevity of early 
rock’n’roll rather than the rambling, sludgy free-jazz-meets-heavy-rock of 
their debut. Almost everything about it is perfect. Almost everything. The 
problem is the one thing that’s not, because it’s a pretty big thing to get 
wrong: the sound. The album was produced by Jon Landau – the rock journalist 
who was to later find his true vocation as Bruce Springsteen’s right hand – who 
entered the control room and decided America’s most confrontational rock’n’roll 
band would be just that little bit better with the entire bottom end taken out. 
So an album that should roar out of the speakers instead tinkles: there should 
be a Ferrari engine behind Back in the USA; instead there’s a Fiat Panda. I 
guess there’s something truly punk about it – it’s got a speedy kind of 
tinniness that’s clearly deliberate and sounds like a truer precursor of punk 
than the debut, even if it’s wrongheaded – but one can’t help wishing for a bit 
more oomph.

 Even so, it’s my favourite MC5 album. It’s the most complete portrait of the 
America the band saw themselves as inhabiting, the one of “dope, rock’n’roll, 
and fucking in the streets”. The rock’n’roll’s there in the bookend covers of 
Tutti Frutti and Back in the USA and their ownShakin’ Street 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbVdrnRm4R4> (“where all the kids meet”), the 
fucking in the streets is there inTeenage Lust 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHTGvCJ1ieU>, and the dope – if we take it to 
mean not just drugs, but the straight dope, the truth – is the theme of The 
American Ruse: “I learned to say the pledge of allegiance/ Before they beat me 
bloody down at the station/ They haven’t got a word out of me since/ I got a 
billion years probation.” And Tonight offers all three: a boy who’s got his 
draft letter but doesn’t care because the rock’n’roll dance is in town and he’s 
got a girl who wants to go. Teenage revolution, Detroit-style.

Skunk (Sonicly Speaking) (High Time, 1971)
Here, on their final studio album (since their demise, countless live albums 
of largely atrocious quality have been released), the MC5 finally achieved what 
they’d been searching for, and it all happened on the five glorious minutes of 
Skunk (Sonicly Speaking). This was where rock and jazz really did come together 
in a song that sacrificed neither the power and vigouor of rock’n’roll nor the 
exploratory, questing nature of jazz. It all depends on Thompson and Davis: 
Thompson’s performance is little less than a five-minute percussion solo, 
leaving Davis alone to anchor the spiralling guitar riff, and the horns, which 
are trying to lift off for the sun from the moment they enter. Even as they 
achieved apotheosis, however, the MC5 were falling apart, riven by drugs and 
having seen each of their albums sell a little less than the one before (and 
it’s not like they were starting from a multi-platinum base). Skunk makes one 
wonder what else they might have achieved. This is hard rock as it had never 
been played before and would never be played again. And yet this is the album 
that tends to get overlooked when the testimonials are drawn up, for there was 
no revolution here, just a band on their uppers, left behind by the times as 
the insurrectionary fervour of the late 60s faded into the solipsism of the 
early 1970s. Proof that the struggle had been lost, once and for all, came when 
Rachel in Friends wore an MC5 shirt to kid around with Monica, Chandler, Ross 
and the gang.
