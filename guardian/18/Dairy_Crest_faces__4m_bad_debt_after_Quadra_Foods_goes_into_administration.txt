Dairy Crest has slipped back after news that one of its customers has gone 
into administration, leaving the group with a Â£4m bad debt.

The company said it would lose the money after Quadra Foods - which makes 
Dairystik - had called in administrators, but it was looking at options to 
reduce the amount involved. It said it would treat any loss as an exceptional 
item, but it would not have any impact on its dividend policy and would have no 
material effect on its borrowings. Dairy Crest's shares have edged down 0.3p to 
330.5p, and analyst Charles Hall at Peel Hunt said:
 The loss will obviously be seen as negative to sentiment in the short term, 
but should have minimal effect long term.
