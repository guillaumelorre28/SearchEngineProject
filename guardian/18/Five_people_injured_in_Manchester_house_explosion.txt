Speaking to Manchester Evening News, neighbours compared the sound of the 
explosion to a bomb. “I went to the street and it looks like it has taken out 
an entire house,” one man said. “There were loads of police and fire crews 
there.”

A neighbour said: “The house shook; we thought someone had crashed a car into 
our house, so we went out to see and it was that bang.”
