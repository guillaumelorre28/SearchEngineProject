A statement from Forest read: “The club has made the decision following a 
series of disappointing results this season and given the current position in 
the league table. The search for a replacement manager will now begin. In the 
meantime, Gary Brazil will be handling first-team affairs.”

Montanier joined Forest in the summer, having been with Rennes in his home 
country of France. The 52-year-old initially oversaw some positive results, 
but, amid a confusing ownership situation at the City Ground, Forest have 
slipped into relegation trouble. They sit fifth bottom, three points clear of 
safety.

On Friday, the owner, Fawaz al-Hasawi, announced that a prospective takeover 
of the club by an American consortium had fallen through. Al Hasawi said the 
deal, which had been expected to be finalised this week, was “not in the 
interests of the long-term future of our club”. Montanier is the seventh 
manager to have been sacked by Al-Hasawi since he took over the club in June 
2012.
