On 14 December 1911, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and his team became the 
first people to reach the South Pole. They beat Captain Robert Falcon Scott's 
British expedition by over a month. One hundred years later and anniversary 
celebrations included Jens Stoltenberg, the Norwegian prime minister, unveiling 
an ice sculpture of the man at the south pole's Amundsen-Scott scientific base.

It was to take several months for news of Amundsen's success to reach Europe. 
Confirmation came at the beginning of March 1912 when his ship, the Fram, 
arrived at Hobart, Tasmania. On 10 March, the Manchester Guardian congratulated 
the Norwegian and, rather grudgingly, said: "We shall not grudge Amundsen his 
great success, which none but an explorer of great courage and resolution could 
win, but we look forward also with keen expectation to the solution of the 
questions which his success has raised."

The next day, the Observer reprinted Amundsen's own straightforward account of 
the journey to the pole.
