With references to the Black Lives Matter movement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement>, Malcolm X 
and the Black Panthers, Beyoncé’s half-time show at the Super Bowl on Sunday 
might be the most radical political statement from the superstar in her 20-year 
career.

Backing dancers wearing Black Panther-style berets and clad in black leather 
were photographed after the performance posing with raised fists evocative of 
the black power salute by Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Olympic 
Games in Mexico City.

Black Pride at the Super Bowl? Beyoncé embodies a new political moment |

The dancers’ visual homage to the Black Panthers marked 50 years since the 
formation of the group, which had its roots in Oakland, less than 50 miles from 
the stadium where the Super Bowl took place.

Founded by Huey P Newton and Bobby Seale, the movement was a revolutionary 
black nationalist organisation and one of the most influential civil rights 
groups of the late 60s, but vilification in the media and some members’ 
connections to illegal activities led the then FBI director, J Edgar Hoover, to 
call it “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country”.

Beyoncé <https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce> was widely tipped to be 
preparing to make a deeply political statement with her Super Bowl show after 
releasing a surprise single and video, Formation, on Saturday, which referenced 
both Hurricane Katrina and the recent mass protests across the US over police 
killings of unarmed young black men.

The video shows Beyoncé sitting on top of a police car and includes scenes 
showing a young black boy dancing in front of lines of riot police, who put 
their hands up, before cutting to a wall of graffiti that reads: “Stop shooting 
us.”

On Friday, Beyonce’s husband, Jay-Z, announced that he would donate $1.5m 
(£1m) raised at a charity concert run by his streaming service Tidal last year 
to theBlack Lives Matter movement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement> and other 
social justice organisations.

Beyoncé’s performance was not the only political statement of the night, with 
Coldplay’s set featuring a marriage-equality inspired rainbow wave of placards 
held up across the stadium, which spelled out: “Believe In Love”.

Commentators said the message was indicative of how far the gay rights 
movement has come. “This was a combination of local pride – I was born and used 
to live in San Francisco – and the simple reminder of the country’s progress on 
LGBTQ acceptance,”wrote Seth Millstein of Bustle.  
<http://www.bustle.com/articles/140337-super-bowl-50s-pro-gay-marriage-moment-sends-a-beautiful-message-about-love>

“Even five years ago, it wouldn’t have been conceivable for the Super Bowl to 
express an unabashedly pro-gay message during the half-time show.”

• This article was amended on 8 February 2016 to clarify that the lawyer 
representing Mario Woods’s family is asking the federal government to consider 
criminal charges in the case, not seeking to bring them himself.
