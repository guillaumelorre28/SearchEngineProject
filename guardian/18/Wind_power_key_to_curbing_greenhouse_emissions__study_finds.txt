Wind power <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower> plays a key 
role in curbing greenhouse emissions from other energy sources such as coal and 
gas, a new study has shown.


Energy <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> from windfarms in the 
UK prevented almost 36m tonnes of harmful carbon emissions in six years, 
equivalent to taking 2.3m cars off the road, the analysis found.

Edinburgh University researchers studied National Grid figures for power 
generated by sources including wind, coal and gas between 2008 and 2014.

They said the study is the “most accurate of its kind to date” as it uses 
real, rather than estimated, energy output figures, detailing figures for every 
half hour.

The university claimed the study suggests UK government figures 
“underestimate” carbon savings from wind turbines by 3.4m tonnes. The study 
also claims the method used by the Scottish government “overestimates” the 
savings.

Researchers said their findings support building more windfarms in the UK to 
help cut carbon emissions and reduce climate-change impact.

They said the study suggests wind power could play a key role in meeting the 
UK’s future energy needs and the methodology used could be applied to give 
accurate estimates of possible future emissions savings.

The study’s leader, Camilla Thomson, said: “Until now, the impact of clean 
energy from windfarms was unclear.

“Our findings show that wind plays an effective role in curbing emissions that 
would otherwise be generated from conventional sources, and it has a key role 
to play in helping to meet Britain’s need for power in future.”

The analysis, published in Energy Policy 
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7kD6wZ95RwHTG5OX2pLekZZRmc/view> and 
supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, was 
welcomed by WWF Scotland.

WWF Scotland’s director, Lang Banks, said: “It’s great to finally have an 
independent and authoritative study that puts a more accurate figure on the 
massive amounts of climate-damaging carbon emissions being avoided thanks to 
wind power.

“We’ve long known that wind power and other renewables were making a major 
contribution to reducing carbon pollution, but it’s fantastic to learn more 
clearly just how huge that contribution is.”

UK climate targets at risk without government support for windfarms, says

A Scottish government spokesman said: “With 34% of the UK’s wind power 
generated inScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>, this [study] 
reinforces the crucial role of both on and offshore wind in meeting our 
international climate change obligations.

“It is particularly significant that the study is reported to suggest that a 
greater investment in wind energy could help meet Scottish and UK government 
targets for carbon emissions reduction.

“This is a key message we have also been directing to UK ministers and one 
that they should heed, especially in the context of wind energy being amongst 
the cheapest electricity sources available.”

A spokesman for the UK government’s Department for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy, said: “We have made a firm commitment to a low-carbon 
future, and our recent ratification of the historic Paris agreement shows we 
are serious about global action on climate change.

“Nearly £52bn has been invested in renewables in the UK since 2010, and just 
last month we reiterated our commitment to spend a further £730m per year 
supporting new renewable projects over the course of this parliament.”
