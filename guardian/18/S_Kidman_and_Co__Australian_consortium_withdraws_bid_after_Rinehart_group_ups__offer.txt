increased its bid to $386.5m, and after the S Kidman and Co chairman, John 
Crosby, said his fellow directors would recommend shareholders accept the offer 
from the mining billionaire’s vehicle, Australian OutbackBeef

The all-Australian BBHO consortium, which had offered $386m, has congratulated 
the AOB joint venture.

AOB is 67% owned by Hancock Prospecting and 33% by China’s Shanghai CRED.

“The BBHO consortium advises that it withdraws its previously announced bid 
for S Kidman & Co following the receipt and unanimous recommendation of a 
superior offer by the Kidman board,” BBHO said on Friday.


“We are disciplined investors in Australian rural assets and made what we 
believed to be a full and fair offer.

“After what has been a lengthy and complex sales process we congratulate the 
Hancock Shanghai CRED consortium for similarly recognising the potential of the 
iconic Kidman brand.

“BBHO would like to acknowledge the very strong groundswell of public support 
it has received from well-wishers across the country, all of whom recognise the 
importance of the Kidman name and legacy to our industry. We would also like to 
thank our advisers and financiers who assisted us through this process.

“Each of the BBHO partners wishes the Hancock consortium well and, should they 
be successful in completing the acquisition, we look forward to welcoming them 
as neighbours.”

The AOB bid will need to be approved by the Foreign Investment and Review 
Board.

BBHO was supported by the federal independent MP Bob Katter and senator Nick 
Xenophon, both of whom attended the BBHO announcement in federal parliament.
