 Click to hear Bob Lind’s The Swan. 
I hesitate to recommend this record because I know that Bob Lind himself hates 
it and that it did a lot of harm to his career – but I love it, so here goes … 
This is the story as I understand it: Lind had a massive global hit withElusive 
Butterfly <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5mD_loFlfg> in 1965. Someone 
crawled out of the woodwork and sold some acoustic demo recordings he had made 
a few years earlier as a teenager to Verve Records. Verve decided to add bass, 
drums and strings to the songs, which consisted of voice and acoustic guitar 
only, in order to make them sound more like the single he had in the charts. 
The whole affair reeks of the worst side of the exploitative music business of 
those days – and yet … somehow they made something beautiful. It’s like a 
weird, inverted form of sampling: instead of cutting and pasting the vocals and 
guitar over a steady rhythm track – as would happen today – Lind’s performances 
speed up, slow down, have irregular bar counts, and the bass and drums just 
have to follow him as best they can. So the songs end up with very 
modern-sounding, unusual structures. The dislocation between the various 
elements emphasises the loneliness in the songs. It has an absolutely unique 
atmosphere – the voice is swathed in a 50s-style reverb, the instrumentation 
and string arrangements are very mid-60s, but when they lock into a groove and 
trance out (like on What Colour Are You?) it could have been made last week. 
It’s not only my favourite Bob Lind album; it’s one of my favourite albums, 
full stop. Go figure.

 is from London but lives in Paris and she has sung with Damon Albarn and Mary 
J Blige but I love her own music. It reminds me of old songs such asDream a 
Little Dream of Me <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7j8wa9sWOE>. I saw her 
playing in this bar, like some cool 1940s nightclub, and she started singing at 
really low volume, and it was so beautiful I fell in love with her. A few years 
later I was on the Eurostar and I saw her walking past and I was like: “Oh my 
God, it’s the girl from the bar!” So I said hi and told her I loved her music. 
Then I saw her again at a festival and she was incredible. The sounds she uses, 
the mic she uses, it’s really “old” and the way she sings is really 
conversational. She even uses her hands in a really elegant way. Listening to 
her is like having a big hug; you feel like you have had a massage.

You would expect us to be constantly listening to drum’n’bass, the Prodigy, 
Biggie Smalls and bashment but we have a wide spectrum of music that we love. 
We were touring America in 2011 for our No More Idols tour and our frontman MC 
Rage put this on our tourbus and this incredible tune called Big Jet Plane came 
on. The beautiful music and combination of male and female voices really 
touched me. It became the soundtrack to the tour and since then I’ve followed 
their career and got all their records. Fans of folky funk with classic 
songwriting and modern production – Bon Iver fans, for example – will love it.

, had hits with her songs: she was a bit of a Carole King. This was her second 
album – she was 20 at the time. She had so much passion in her songwriting, her 
voice and her arrangements. Very theatrical, in a way: she clearly influenced 
Kate Bush. I love the changes in tempo – these are songs of many parts. Her 
singing style was a mixture of jazz, gospel, soul and pop. But she had a real 
fear of performing live that stemmed froma disastrous appearance at the 
Monterey festival <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YxIGXISEi4>. She retreated 
from the limelight after that, although she carried on making records such as 
the cover versions album Gonna Take a Miracle, with Labelle, which is another 
brilliant album.

Phil Spector <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/phil-spector> produced six

and quite fucked-up when he was making this record.Dion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/dec/15/jazz> disowned it and he faded 
into obscurity. He described it as “funeral music”. I think it’s a great pop 
record: grand and epic. It’s got that Be My Baby sound, with a lot ofthe

co-written by Spector and Gerry Goffin, who used to write with Carole King. It 
was actually James Skelly ofthe Coral 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/03/the-coral-return-success-was-like-a-runaway-train-chaotic-with-no-control>
, who produced our album, who put me on to it. Musicians love it, such as Bobby 
Gillespie and Pete Townshend. And Bruce Springsteen, who visited the studio 
during the recording of it. It’s got an uplifting melancholy to it, a euphoric 
heartbreak –an atmosphere I’m always trying to recreate.

This album charted when it was released, but over time has slipped gently into 
quasi-obscurity.Simple Minds <https://www.theguardian.com/music/simple-minds> 
went on to become a stadium rock band, leading most people to forget that 
before super-stardom they were idiosyncratic, electronic and Bowie-influenced. 
I first heard this in early 1982 when I was a junior at high school in Darien, 
Connecticut, and for me it was everything that suburban America in 1982 was 
not. It was atmospheric, weirdly European and disco-influenced at a time when 
radio in the States was all shiny American pop and pedantic rock. It’s a 
remarkable record that deserves its place in the canon of great Bowie-inspired 
albums.

 Click to hear Robert Wyatt’s At Last I Am Free. 
This is without doubt one of my favourite albums. Before its release, Robert 
Wyatt was known to me as drummer and co-vocalist of Soft Machine, through 
listening to John Peel, who almost single-handedly championed him throughout 
his solo career. Peel brought Wyatt further attention, particularly in 1983 
when his original version of Elvis Costello and Clive Langer’s Falklands 
war-inspired songShipbuilding <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoZiOOD0HRU> 
reachedNo 2 in his Festive 50 <http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/festive50s/>
. By that time, I was already well under the influence of Nothing Can Stop Us. 
It was on my Walkman throughout that summer, usually as I hoofed it on a daily 
basis from Paddington up to Shepherd’s Bush, where my mates and I were busy 
occupying ourselves with the recording of a bunch of songs that would be 
released as New Gold Dream. I loved listening to the album in its entirety, and 
repeatedly so. I still do. Why? You could begin by listening to At Last I Am 
Free, followed by Strange Fruit, and then the aforementioned Shipbuilding. And 
perhaps like me you, too, will get a lump in the throat listening to what was 
surely a purposefully pale and wan rendition of Red Flag. I don’t think Robert 
Wyatt knows how great an artist he really is.

 Click to hear the Clark Sisters’ Is My Living in Vain? 
This was given to me by a writer I met in New York in about 1982: this 
recording of rapturous devotion to God has abided with me ever since. It’sso 
good … it almost passeth all understanding. Taped live in 1979 at Detroit’s 
Bailey Cathedral, Elbernita “Twinkie” Clark with her four sisters and their 
mother, group founder Dr Mattie Moss Clark, perform some of the most ineffably 
sublime music I have ever heard. As funky as grandpa’s drawers and with an 
ecstatic sense of yearning, the sisters’ goosebump-inducing singing – sometimes 
fragile, sometimes fearsome – is put to the service of eight exquisitely 
crafted paeans to the Lord. You can find a clip of the sisters in their 
floor-length pastel chiffon gowns performing a version of the album’s title 
song on YouTube, which is magnificent but only hints at the record’s treasures. 
In 1983, the Clark Sisters performed at the Grammys, provoking the ire of their 
church, which forbade Mattie Moss from ever performing with her daughters 
again. Her singing of They Were Overcome on this album is one of the loveliest 
things I know. A couple of years after I was first given the record, the 
sisters came to London to sing at [the] Westminster Hall. After their 
astonishing appearance I approached them to express my admiration and 
gratitude. I was invited to visit the family next day at a house in Tottenham, 
or maybe it was Finsbury Park. I’m sure I was a nuisance but they were gracious 
and I was blessed with some albums from their back catalogue. Is My Living In 
Vain is an exalted delight and is up there with the venerated best.

I was recommended these sisters by a female Uber driver in LA; I’d just played 
my song Baby Love to her. It was my best musical ride. She heard the gospel 
vocals in my song and said: “You’ve got to hear these girls!” They’re sisters 
who sing these big gospel songs with so much energy and love. It’s inspiring to 
listen to as it gives me ideas. I love the rawness of the recordings from those 
days. Go find them … you won’t regret it.

I was in the sixth form when I came across this. I was working in Watford WH 
Smith in the music department, and I’d get 25% discount, so I ordered it in and 
used to listen to it on my PlayStation because I didn’t have a CD player. I was 
fascinated because Sawhney was British-Asian, too: I didn’t think it was 
possible to make Asian sounds and still be cool. On the surface, the album was 
about nuclear weapons, but really it was about a personal quest to find 
yourself, with lots of songs about love. It’s quite dark, but the lyrics are 
full of light. He was refusing to be bound by any rules. He combined flamenco 
music with Qawwali, jazz with drum’n’bass. It made me ultimately brave. Once 
I’d finished sixth form, I was ready to start my journey as a composer and 
producer. Being boxed-in wasn’t an option because of this album.

I bought this at the Derrick Harriot record shop in Kingston, Jamaica. It was 
one of the few stores that would carry albums as soon as they were released; 
they used to rent movies on VHS as well, so it was a popular spot. When it came 
out, Buju was already a dancehall superstar but it took him to a different 
level. Most dancehall albums at that time were usually a collection of hits 
that were already out but this was made up of new material. When I got home and 
put it on the stereo, it was mind-blowing. Buju was in full-on rasta mode and 
every single song was absolute fire. The consciousness was turned all the way 
up. Even on the party songs and girl tunes he was talking from a higher 
perspective. Champion and Murderer may have been the hardcore boom shots that 
everyone knows but Til I’m Laid to Rest and Not an Easy Road spoke to me deeply 
and truly inspired me even more to pursue music. Everyone needs to listen to 
this dancehall reggae gem and see who Buju Banton really is.

 Click to hear Faine Jade’s Don’t Hassle Me. 
This is one of my favourite psychedelic records – and one of the rarest. Get 
it now! It has the visceral edge of the Velvet Underground in places and the 
wistfulness of Syd Barrett in others. Faine Jade is effectively a solo project 
from Chuck Laskowski, a Long Island-based singer and guitarist who previously 
released one single with the Rustics in 1966. Barrett similarities run through 
the record; one of my favourite things about Syd’s songs is the feeling that 
they could go in any direction, at any moment. They are totally tense, raw and 
unpredictable, and the songs on Introspection follow a similar creative path. 
Laskowski claims to have been unaware of Pink Floyd at the time, which is 
totally believable as the tracks never stray into homage territory. While 
seeking to emulate some of the British psych sounds of the time, Introspection 
retains the identity of late-60s amphetamine-driven US garage. Don’t Hassle Me 
captures the spirit of rebellious youth, and Ballad of the Bad Guys is a burst 
of garage rock that Between the Buttons-era Rolling Stones fans will be into. 
The tension reaches its height on People Games Play, a song that combines the 
“ostrich guitar” strumming of Lou Reed with familiar late-60s percussion and 
unsettling, monotone vocals. There’s definitely a bit of the Byrds in here as 
well. The lyrics are fairly typical of the Timothy Leary era, with mystical 
lines such as, “Trim the wick with scarlet scissors,” but they fit the mood. 
Laskowski went on to release an album with the country rock band Dustbowl 
Clementine in 1970 but has since been largely inactive. More recently, Faine 
Jade gained wider exposure asMGMT <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mgmt> 
covered the folk-rock title track Introspection on their debut Oracular 
Spectacular. Laskowski even gave his seal of approval by appearing with them on 
the closing date of their accompanying US tour.

Herb Alpert produced this album, mostly in LA and Paris. It was a hugely

it – Bill Medley, Paul Williams – and some great jazz musicians. It’s one of 
those masterpieces that isn’t what you’d call a commercial record, but it’s one 
of my favourites. I love Herb, and Michel, who was a great composing talent. It 
was a bit of a love-in! There’s some amazing music on it: very moving – there’s 
a song on it called Emmanuel, for Michel’s son, who died very young – but it 
also rocks like mad. It was very personal to Michel, who was a very unusual 
musician. He was often in another place, another world. It was made for pure 
pleasure. You could call it a kind of folly.

 Click to hear Karyokinesis by Franco Battiato. 
It’s progressive rock but more short song-based than overblown 15-minute rock 
like Yes, Genesis or ELP. He’s a composer and songwriter who’s still one of 
Italy’s best-known musicians; a sort of Italian Peter Gabriel. He moved away 
from this strange experimental record towards a more poppy, new wave direction; 
Foetus is his first solo album. It’s a very beautiful-sounding, analogue 
synth-based record, but also very pop: the songs are very immediate, melodic 
and easy on the ear. The Italian version was the first one I really loved; then 
I came across the English version and that suddenly opened it up; now I knew 
what the songs were about. It’s a very original take on describing your place 
in the world; not your usual singer-songwriter confessionals. It’s similar to 
the experimental pop approach of a Brian Wilson mixed with someone like Jim 
O’Rourke from 90s underground Chicago.

 Click to hear Betty Wright’s Clean Up Woman. 
The Numero Group collect really old compilations from obscure labels no longer 
in existence. This album is all of the tracks from a soul label based in Miami 
called Deep City; most of the music is mid-to-late-60s. A lot of the players 
were part of Florida marching bands – the cover of the album shows them wearing 
the most sick, badass uniforms – who later went on to run more successful 
studios that released funk and disco. This predates that stuff; it’s tracks 
that had no commercial success, but it does feature artists such asBetty Wright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/16/cult-heroes-betty-wright-soul-golden-agony-aunt>
. It’s similar to what was going on in Detroit, only a little funkier. It’s a 
little rough around the edges, but if you like old soul, it’s great.

 Click to hear Driving and Talking at the Same Time by he Necessaries. 
This is a record that has even evaded diehard fans of Arthur Russell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/17/arthur-russell-alexis-taylor-devandra-banhart>
, who played keyboards in the group during their short lifespan and wrote two 
of the album’s best songs: Driving and Talking at the Same Time and More Real. 
When I listen to Event Horizon, I marvel that it isn’t one of the most 
influential records in rock music. But it didn’t make the impact it intended 
to, and was forgotten by Sire and eventually by fans. Russell went on to a 
celebrated solo career after quitting the band by jumping out of the van at the 
mouth of the Holland Tunnel in New York, while on the way to a gig in New 
Jersey. But this is a record that needs to be examined further by anybody 
interested in this era of rock music. It’s an elusive missing piece to the lore 
of the downtown scene. Everyone who walks through the door of my apartment is 
subjected to and is changed by it.

 Click to hear Thee Fire This Time’s Reluctant Warrior. 
It’s a shining example of an activist-musician using art as a weapon. The guy 
who got it together is Pat Andrade, who organises indigenous resistance, 
helping Aboriginal people, with songs about native rights issues and the way 
corporations own the government. In the punk days, people tended to wear 
politics like a haircut, but Pat actually walks what he talks. He was 
influenced by us [Pop Group/On-U Sound] to a certain extent. There are loads of 
guests – Augustus Pablo, Chuck D, Mikey Dread – on this album. He’s a real 
internationalist; a dub activist. It’s resistance through reggae. What he’s 
talking about is really real.

 Click to hear Aereogramme’s The Question is Complete. 
When people talk about artists who don’t get the recognition they deserve, 
Aereogramme are always the first band I think of. It’s a stunning record, so 
different to anything I’d heard before: atmospheric, with beautiful melodies 
and really heavy riffs. I got intoMogwai 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/mogwai> through my brother when I was 11 or 
12 and I thought it would be great to have that sort of music with vocals and 
Aereogramme did just that. I love the contrast of light and dark. It was 
definitely an influence on Fightstar. Funnily enough, Iain Cook the guitarist, 
is now inChvrches <https://www.theguardian.com/music/chvrches>, so he did 
finally get some recognition.

They were my peers growing up in Edinburgh. I had a massive crush on Giles, 
the singer with the thunderbolt hair

: she was like a rock star, with incredible charisma and an image that would 
still look killer today. Back then she appeared to come from Mars: she was like 
a female David Bowie to me. I worked in Miss Selfridge and she came into the 
store one day and I kept staring at her. Later I got introduced to her at a 
club and became obsessed with her and her band. I still think they deserve more 
recognition; they were a fantastic pop band. The record was produced by Tony 
Visconti and Martin Rushent, and the result is a strange mix of white funk, 
jangly 80s guitar, catchy pop and synths, with girl group harmonies and some 
“alternative” flavour. They flamed brightly for a few minutes then seemed to 
disappear, but they’re really unique.

 Click to hear Lisa Gerrard’s Sanvean. 
She used to sing with Dead Can Dance 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJhVM930YXY>. She is kind of classical and 
sings in her own language that she makes up. She works a lot with Hans Zimmer 
and she’s just unreal. She did the theme from Gladiator,Now We Are Free 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBE-uBgtINg>. That made me want to find out 
more about her. I really like the song Sanvean (I Am Your Shadow). It’s quite 
dark; heavy and emotional. It creates a mood and it’s moving. To me, she’s one 
of the best vocalists of all time. If someone went on The X Factor and sang Now 
We Are Free, it would be unbelievable. It’s whether the audience are ready for 
that.

 Click to hear Carole King’s Goin’ Back. 
This was Carole King’s album before Tapestry, which I don’t think anybody 
bought apart from me and a couple of other people. She made an album before it, 
in 1968, with a group calledthe City 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCR5syrzWw4> because she didn’t really like 
being a frontperson. But Writer was significant because it was the prelude to 
Tapestry. There are some wonderful songs here such as Up on the Roof and Goin’ 
Back – covers of her own songs. But the album only sold about 10 or 20,000 
whereas Tapestry sold 10 or 20m! James Taylor is on it, and [guitarist] Danny 
Kortchmar; a lot of the same people who were on Tapestry. It’s a really lovely 
album. It definitely influenced my writing, particularly the chord sequences on 
Child of Mine. If I’d grown my hair and worn jeans and a denim shirt I would 
have easily fitted into that category of singer-songwriter. But I dared to be 
different and chose an unusual image.

 Click to hear Abner Jay’s I’m So Depressed. 
This is the only record I own that I love that has jokes on. I tend to like 
miserable, depressing, pretentious music. Abner Jay was a one-man-band, who 
classed himself as an entertainer – “The last great southern black minstrel 
show,” as he described himself. He’d move from town to town, selling vinyl 
records and cassettes that he published on his own label. It’s folk-blues; the 
kind of thing that, when you hear it, you can’t believe it hasn’t sold a 
million copies. It’s a guy singing his heart out, playing amazing music. The 
songs are absolutely incredible, poignant, dark, really captivating and wild. 
He wrote them about Vietnam, cocaine, the moon landing. My favourite one on 
this album is I’m So Depressed. That’s the one that blew me away. I’m not sure 
if it’s a joke, but it’s really moving.
