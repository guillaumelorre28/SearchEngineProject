If the teenage son of a Methodist preacher had not visited the Great 
Exhibition in 1851,The Jungle Book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jun/10/review-the-jungle-book-rudyard-kipling>
 and other beloved works ofRudyard Kipling  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/26/rudyard-kipling-unexpected-revival-150-years-after-birth>
would probably never have been created. The awe-struck visitor was not the 
author but his father, John Lockwood Kipling, whose life was changed forever by 
the Indian treasures he saw on display at Crystal Palace, and whose passion for 
India profoundly influenced his son.

Lockwood’s children were born in India 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> and grew up surrounded by the works 
of the Indian art he had collected, the artists he trained and promoted, the 
stories he told, and the images he recorded of traditional craft workers.

 “If you mention the name Kipling in Lahore they assume it’s Lockwood, not the 
Jungle Book one,” said the V&A curator Julius Bryant. “He is still a hero 
there. He is unquestionably the William Morris of India. Only instead of 
staying home and whining about the death of traditional arts and crafts, he 
went out there and did something about preserving them.”

When his son became one of the best loved authors of late Victorian and 
Edwardian Britain, Lockwood created many of the first illustrations for his 
books through a tortuous process of carving them as relief sculptures and then 
photographing them. Several of his original clay sculptures are on display at 
the V&A, including his design for his own book plate, a self portrait of a 
happy man reading a book, wreathed in pipe smoke, under the textFumus Gloria 
Mundi.

Many of the paintings, ceramics, carvings and furniture are within the vast 
V&A collection – including some of the objects displayed at Crystal Palace 
which so thrilled the 13-year-old Lockwood. But they have not been on display 
for most of the last century.

“These things were not lost, but they have been rescued from deep storage, and 
displayed in a totally new context,” Bryant said. “We’re tackling the empire 
head on. Seventy years after it ended with Indian independence in 1947 it 
really is time to get to grips with it.”

The stores yielded an imposing portrait by John Everett Millais, last 
displayed in 1969, of Kipling’s patron, the viceroy Lord Lytton, who 
commissioned Kipling to work on the design of the giganticDelhi Durbar 
<http://navrangindia.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/king-george-v-in-procession-with-queen.html>
 of 1877, at which Queen Victoria (in absentia) was proclaimed empress of 
India. “It was Lockwood’s Danny Boyle moment,” Bryant said, “the Durbar was 
absolutely the equivalent of getting the London Olympics job, and his 
reputation was made.”
