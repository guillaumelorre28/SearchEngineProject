His first campaign during the Vancouver mayoral election hinged on a 
deceptively simple idea: housing is a human right. In 2008, as he stumped 
through this city of some 600,000 people Gregor Robertson vowed to boost 
affordable housing and end homelessness.


Eight years later, Robertson is into his third term as mayor. Housing remains 
one of the top issues facing the city, but the battle has been recast. No 
longer is Robertson simply fighting to keep the city’s most vulnerable off the 
streets, he’s part of a global cadre of mayorssquaring off against superheated 
housing markets

 to ensure that middle- and low-income earners have a place to call home.

Has Vancouver found the solution to a super-heated housing market?

The city’s struggle to inject affordability into a housing market that ranks 
as one of the world’s least affordable was laid bare last week, as Vancouver 
became the first jurisdiction in Canada toslap a tax on vacant homes

 “I wouldn’t have dreamed the crisis would get this intense, half a dozen 
years later,” Robertson told the Guardian in an interview at Vancouver’s city 
hall. “We’re dealing with global capital, national governments underinvesting 
in housing and provincial governments not doing enough. That leaves the cities 
dealing with chaos on our streets and people struggling to find a place to 
live.”

Housing in metro Vancouver, which includes the city of Vancouver and the 
greater region that surrounds it, now ranksamong the least affordable in the 
world

stood at about C$76,000 (US$56,000) a year, low interest rates and foreign 
capital –much of it from China

It’s a challenge echoed in cities around the world, from London to Sydney. But 
in Vancouver the pace of the transformation has been singular; one decade ago 
the percentage of million-dollar homes in the city stood at 19%. “We’re now in 
a different league,” said Robertson. “It’s been a big change, it’s pretty 
dramatic.”

At the heart of the issue lies a fundamental question over whether housing 
should be treated as a right or simply seen as an unregulated commodity, said 
Robertson. Staunchly in the former camp, Robertson has for years been among 
those inCanada <https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada> sounding the alarm 
about rising housing prices, calling on the provincial and federal governments 
to tax luxury homes and those who flip houses and more rigorously enforce 
Canadian tax laws.

Mounting public anger and a chorus of concern emanating from the country’s 
banks forced a turnaround in recent months. In August, the province of British 
Columbia instituteda 15% tax on all home buyers in metro Vancouver 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/vancouver-real-estate-foreign-house-buyers-tax>
 who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents. Soon after, the federal 
government said it wouldclose a tax loophole believed to be used by some 
speculators.

The city of Vancouver has proposed its own measures in recent months, from a 
1% tax on vacant homes starting next year – after an attempt to do so last year 
was stymied by the provincial government – and a crackdown on short-term 
rentals, such as those done through Airbnb.

But the measures are a case of “too much, too late”, said Robertson, shaking 
his head. “Ideally those would’ve come earlier and more modestly just to ease 
the curve.”

Housing starts in Vancouver have fallen to their lowest level in more than 
five years 
<http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/vancouver-housing-starts-fall-to-lowest-level-since-2011/>
while home sales plunged 38.8% compared with October of last year. “We’re 
watching it closely,” said Robertson. “What we don’t want is instability and 
volatility.”

His comments hint at the balancing act being demanded of global cities for 
whom the ability to attract foreign capital has long been seen as an 
unequivocal strength. Vancouver boasts the strongest economy of any city in 
Canada, in part thanks to the construction and real estate industry. In 2014, 
these two sectorsaccounted for some 25% of the province’s GDP 
<https://www.biv.com/article/2016/1/bcs-real-estate-boost-comes-peril-say-economists/>
. “We need to find a balance between welcoming investment and ensuring it 
doesn’t skew the housing options for people who live here,” he said.

The city’s focus now is on boosting the supply of rental housing, particularly 
for those on modest incomes.

Vacancy rates in the city hover around 0.6%, leaving many working multiple 
jobs to make rent or couch surfing. “Anything that is built is immediately 
occupied, rents continue to escalate,” said Robertson.

The city has also been watching closely as other jurisdictions around the 
world wage battle against the same forces, he said. “I’ve met with officials in 
Hong Kong, New York, London, San Francisco, and talked about housing challenges 
that we all share.

“I think its just everyone’s got to be at the table and committed to a big 
goal of building affordable housing and making sure everyone has a good place 
to live,” Robertson said. “Because a country like Canada should not have people 
dying on our streets, homeless, when there is so much affluence and openness to 
global capital.”
