That’s all from me but here’s the last word from Chris Hughton himself. “It’s 
a big win for us, we were not at our best but we found a way of winning the 
game,” Hughton says, speaking to Sky Sports. “I think there’s a resilience in 
the squad, and there was a period in the first half when we were desperate not 
to concede.

“I think we deserve to be where we are but there’s an awful long way to go. At 
the moment we are doing well but we are conscious of how tough games in this 
league are.”

Thanks for your company!

Brighton are now unbeaten in 17 matches but in true footballer 
approach-every-game-as-it-comes speak, Glenn Murray’s not getting too carried 
away. “The league table means nothing at this stage, we just want to keep going 
and see where we are come May,” Murray says.

“There’s a long way to go yet and we’ve seen people come up from the play-off 
pack before in previous seasons.”

It was straightforward in the end and another brilliant victory for Brighton, 
who trump Newcastle to top spot. Everything about it felt routine; another 
Glenn Murray goal, more brilliance from Anthony Knockaert and a sumptuous 
effort by Sam Baldock – although that opener felt rather more spectacular.

“It was my first home goals since my Dad passed away and obviously it was an 
important goal for me,” Knockaert says, speaking about his poignant 
celebration, in which he held a portrait of his late father, Patrick, aloft. 
“It was an occasion to show how much I love him and I am very happy to score 
again today.”

85 min: QPR have a corner and glimpse of goal. Bidwell delivers a in-swinging 
ball and it almost falls at the feet of Sylla but Dunk does enough to clear. At 
the other end, Hemed chases down Smithies and they simply have not stopped 
running. A commendable performance by Brighton, who are surely heading top of 
theChampionship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> this 
afternoon.

82 min: QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> owner Tony Fernandes, 
Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand look pretty glum in the posh seats at the Amex 
Stadium. They’ve tried hard but look unlikely to find the net – again. 
Meanwhile, Luongo receives medical treatment after a clash of heads.

78 min: Brighton cheer every player’s touch, as they knock the ball about in 
the final third. This must be pretty chastening for Holloway and hisQPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> team. Bong then loses the ball to a

76 min: Just as Brighton look infallible, a high ball from Bidwell reaches 
Sylla, whose looping header is kept out by Stockdale.QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> might well feel unlucky, if they 
finish this match with absolutely nothing to show for their efforts. And it’s a 
final change for Brighton, with Skalak replacing Baldock, who got the ball 
rolling for the hosts.

72 min: Brighton are well on their way to extending that unbeaten record to 17 
matches.QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> have pretty much 
capsized this second half, not helped by Onuoha’s red card. Meanwhile, Stephens 
almost finds a fourth after being played in by Hemed.

70 min: Top-scorer Glenn Murray is replaced by Tomer Hemed, last season’s 
top-scorer. Hughton’s got plenty of appealing options at his disposal. One of 
Steve Sidwell or Jiri Skalak could yet be called upon.

GOAL! Brighton 3-0 QPR (Knockaert, 69)

Brighton have a third, and it’s a special moment for Knockaert, who jinks 
inside and drills low beyond Smithies. Knockaert’s been superb today. The 
winger then holds aloft a picture of his father, Patrick, who passed away last 
month.

half-time looking for pigs and blankets? Has there been a heating failure at 
Guardian Towers,” asks Daisy, picking up upon a fatal typo, “necessitating a 
desperate search for cuddly pets and insulation? The public should be told.”

57 min: It’s been a truly dreadful start to the second half for QPR. The 
sending off seems a little harsh, it’s more of a collision between the two 
players and Baldock falls under pressure from Onuoha. Anyway, Brighton’s 
training ground routine from the resulting free-kick is smart but not smart 
enough.QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> seek to rebuild.

56 min: Onuoha is sent-off for QPR! Baldock races clear, in behind the 
defender and the striker bounces off the defender’s right shoulder and that’s 
it, he’s off. Onuoha, theQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> 
captain, can’t believe it and the visitors are reduced to 10 men.

GOAL! Brighton 2-0 QPR (Murray, 53 pen)

It’s goal No15 of the season Murray. Brighton have started this second half 
like a Southern Rail train. Well, a train. Their brilliant start to the second 
period has been rewarded. It was a silly challenge from Luongo for the penalty 
but Murray did not care an inch as he sent his penalty rattling down the 
middle, low and hard beyond Smithies.

49 min: March, who joined Brighton from local neighbours Lewes, the non-league 
club, has done more in this second half than in the entire first 45 minutes 
already. He looks very a totally different player.

48 min: Brighton win a free-kick in a dangerous area, 20 yards out but 
Knockaert spoons it over, following Onuoha’s foul. Brighton have started this 
second half rather turbocharged, andQPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> might need to just compose 
themselves a little.

47 min: Grant Hall gets lucky, throwing a boot at Solly March’s low, driven 
ball which eventually earns Brighton a corner. March had ran down the left 
flank before getting to byline, bamboozling Perch, before trying to seek out a 
team-mate.

Half-time! Brighton 1-0 QPR

Baldock’s magical strike from distance is the difference at the break. As it 
stands, Brighton top theChampionship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> and will upstage Newcastle, 
until next Friday at least.

QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> might trudge down the tunnel 
feeling down and out but they shouldn’t feel too hard done by, and could have 
found an equaliser through Sylla. I’m off to try and find some leftover pigs in 
blankets, before mulling over some terrific first-half action.The next 45 
minutes is on the way!

44 min: Lip-reading Holloway and it’s relatively pleasant. “Move, move,” he 
shouts from the touchline. They haven’t been disastrous here by any means. 
Meanwhile, Brighton win a free-kick, after Hall trips Murray 25 yards out. 
There’s only one man for the job, surely?

42 min: Another corner for Brighton and this time Dunk goes close! Smithies 
saves from virtually point-blank range, before Stephens picks out Baldock and 
his header is blocked. Another corner follows, before Knockaert runs the ball 
out play. Danger averted forQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>.

40 min: Bruno storms down the right, crossing low and Grant Hall does well to 
steer the ball away from Baldock’s feet. Shane Duffy then heads over from the 
resulting corner. Worth mentioning the two teams are now level-pegging in terms 
of possession.

his team are behind. They’re not, althoughQPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> are still very much in this one on 
evidence so far. Sam Baldock’s peach from distance remains the difference 
between the two teams at the moment.

35 min: QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> are the better team at 
the moment. And Bong does brilliantly to keep Brighton in front, blocking 
Luongo who was surging into the box with only Stockdale in front of him. 
Brighton, though, counterattack through Knockaert and Baldock unselfishly tries 
to slide the ball across goal for Murray but his pass is cut out. It had opened 
up beautifully.

close  
That’s all from me but here’s the last word from Chris Hughton himself. “It’s 
a big win for us, we were not at our best but we found a way of winning the 
game,” Hughton says, speaking to Sky Sports. “I think there’s a resilience in 
the squad, and there was a period in the first half when we were desperate not 
to concede.

“I think we deserve to be where we are but there’s an awful long way to go. At 
the moment we are doing well but we are conscious of how tough games in this 
league are.”

Thanks for your company!

For QPR and Ian Holloway, it’s six consecutive league defeats and their worst 
run for 26 years. Next up forQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> is 
a trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers while Brighton host Cardiff City, also on 
Friday night. In terms of the top two, Newcastle United play Nottingham Forest.
 
Brighton are now unbeaten in 17 matches but in true footballer 
approach-every-game-as-it-comes speak, Glenn Murray’s not getting too carried 
away. “The league table means nothing at this stage, we just want to keep going 
and see where we are come May,” Murray says.

“There’s a long way to go yet and we’ve seen people come up from the play-off 
pack before in previous seasons.”

2016 <https://twitter.com/OfficialBHAFC/status/813756826453942272>  
It was straightforward in the end and another brilliant victory for Brighton, 
who trump Newcastle to top spot. Everything about it felt routine; another 
Glenn Murray goal, more brilliance from Anthony Knockaert and a sumptuous 
effort by Sam Baldock – although that opener felt rather more spectacular.

“It was my first home goals since my Dad passed away and obviously it was an 
important goal for me,” Knockaert says, speaking about his poignant 
celebration, in which he held a portrait of his late father, Patrick, aloft. 
“It was an occasion to show how much I love him and I am very happy to score 
again today.”
 
Brighton go top of the Championship!

90+2 min: Hemed drives forward before picking out Knockaert, who attempts a 
Rabona cross. It comes to nothing but Brighton are already home and hosed.
 
90+1 min: Sandro has a shot blocked from distance and another QPR substitute, 
Mackie, continues to charge down the ball.QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> cannot be faulted for their effort, 
but they have never really truly looked like scoring.
 
90 min: Dunk rises highest and meets the ball but heads wide. Three additional 
minutes will be played at the Amex.
 
89 min: Bong delivers a cross from the left and Hall does well to fend off 
Hemed and clear the ball for a corner. Skalak to deliver ...
 
88 min: Knockaert has been awarded the man of the match award, seconds after 
almost finding his second of the day. The winger darts onto a through ball, but 
Smithies rushes out of his goal to deny the Belgian a shot at goal.
 
87 min: Skalak tries to pick out Hemed but Grant Hall, born in Brighton, cuts 
the ball out forQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>. Brighton, as it 
stands, will move top and go eight points clear of third-placed Reading.
 
85 min: QPR have a corner and glimpse of goal. Bidwell delivers a in-swinging 
ball and it almost falls at the feet of Sylla but Dunk does enough to clear. At 
the other end, Hemed chases down Smithies and they simply have not stopped 
running. A commendable performance by Brighton, who are surely heading top of 
theChampionship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> this 
afternoon.
 
83 min: Hemed goes close to finding a fourth, but Smithies saves well. The 
striker twists and turns on the edge of the box before driving low to the right 
of the goalkeeper, who smothers the ball.
 
82 min: QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> owner Tony Fernandes, 
Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand look pretty glum in the posh seats at the Amex 
Stadium. They’ve tried hard but look unlikely to find the net – again. 
Meanwhile, Luongo receives medical treatment after a clash of heads.
 
80 min: QPR bring on 19-year-old Osman Kakay and Sandro. 
 
78 min: Brighton cheer every player’s touch, as they knock the ball about in 
the final third. This must be pretty chastening for Holloway and hisQPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> team. Bong then loses the ball to a 
huge chorus of boos.
 
76 min: Just as Brighton look infallible, a high ball from Bidwell reaches 
Sylla, whose looping header is kept out by Stockdale.QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> might well feel unlucky, if they 
finish this match with absolutely nothing to show for their efforts. And it’s a 
final change for Brighton, with Skalak replacing Baldock, who got the ball 
rolling for the hosts.
 
75 min: It’s one attack after the other at the moment for Brighton, who 
continue to expose James Perch in defence. He’s not had his best game.
 
72 min: Brighton are well on their way to extending that unbeaten record to 17 
matches.QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> have pretty much 
capsized this second half, not helped by Onuoha’s red card. Meanwhile, Stephens 
almost finds a fourth after being played in by Hemed.
 
70 min: Top-scorer Glenn Murray is replaced by Tomer Hemed, last season’s 
top-scorer. Hughton’s got plenty of appealing options at his disposal. One of 
Steve Sidwell or Jiri Skalak could yet be called upon.
 
Brighton have a third, and it’s a special moment for Knockaert, who jinks 
inside and drills low beyond Smithies. Knockaert’s been superb today. The 
winger then holds aloft a picture of his father, Patrick, who passed away last 
month.

photograph of his father who passed away last month. Photograph: Andrew 
Matthews/PA  
68 min: Half-hearted handball shouts for QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>, as the ball cannons into Lewis Dunk 
in the penalty area. And that’s about it for now. Meanwhile, Murphy enters for 
the hosts, as March is withdrawn.
 
66 min: Jamie Murphy’s kitted out to come on, and it’s Solly March to make 
way. Hughton, meanwhile, continues to bark instructions to his players, who 
have been pretty relentless this second half.
 
64 min: What is going on? A total mess for QPR at the back, with Baldock 
chasing down Smithies after a nothing ball downfield. The ball ends up 
catapulting into the sky and with the goal gaping, Knockaert then closes down 
Perch beforeQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> eventually clear. 
Sterling effort from Brighton, though.
 
62 min: Just after the hour mark then, and it’s cruise control time for 
Brighton. It’s also the perfect time for an email or two. “You went off at 
half-time looking for pigs and blankets? Has there been a heating failure at 
Guardian Towers,” asks Daisy, picking up upon a fatal typo, “necessitating a 
desperate search for cuddly pets and insulation? The public should be told.”

 
59 min: QPR look shellshocked. Chris Hughton looks the same, oddly. Or 
sensibly? Brighton go again, with Baldock orchestrating things for the hosts.
 
57 min: It’s been a truly dreadful start to the second half for QPR. The 
sending off seems a little harsh, it’s more of a collision between the two 
players and Baldock falls under pressure from Onuoha. Anyway, Brighton’s 
training ground routine from the resulting free-kick is smart but not smart 
enough.QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> seek to rebuild.
 
56 min: Onuoha is sent-off for QPR! Baldock races clear, in behind the 
defender and the striker bounces off the defender’s right shoulder and that’s 
it, he’s off. Onuoha, theQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> 
captain, can’t believe it and the visitors are reduced to 10 men.
 
54 min: March lets fly with the outside of the boot, to much excitement from 
the home crowd but it’s not as good as it sounds. On the touchline, Jamie 
Mackie readies himself forQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>.
 
It’s goal No15 of the season Murray. Brighton have started this second half 
like a Southern Rail train. Well, a train. Their brilliant start to the second 
period has been rewarded. It was a silly challenge from Luongo for the penalty 
but Murray did not care an inch as he sent his penalty rattling down the 
middle, low and hard beyond Smithies.

52 min: Penalty to Brighton! Luongo dives in on Stephens and Keith Stroud can 
only point to the spot. Brighton have the chance to double their lead from the 
spot. Murray to take ...
 
50 min: March drops his shoulder and cuts inside Perch before shooting at 
goal. Smithies does well to make himself relatively big before clearing, 
although he didn’t know too much about it. Meanwhile, Cousins receives 
treatment for – at last a bit of respite for the visitors.
 
49 min: March, who joined Brighton from local neighbours Lewes, the non-league 
club, has done more in this second half than in the entire first 45 minutes 
already. He looks very a totally different player.
 
48 min: Brighton win a free-kick in a dangerous area, 20 yards out but 
Knockaert spoons it over, following Onuoha’s foul. Brighton have started this 
second half rather turbocharged, andQPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> might need to just compose 
themselves a little.
 
47 min: Grant Hall gets lucky, throwing a boot at Solly March’s low, driven 
ball which eventually earns Brighton a corner. March had ran down the left 
flank before getting to byline, bamboozling Perch, before trying to seek out a 
team-mate.
 
We’re back underway for the second half! Brighton begin as they mean to go on, 
penningQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> in down the left-hand 
side.
 
Baldock’s magical strike from distance is the difference at the break. As it 
stands, Brighton top theChampionship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> and will upstage Newcastle, 
until next Friday at least.

QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> might trudge down the tunnel 
feeling down and out but they shouldn’t feel too hard done by, and could have 
found an equaliser through Sylla. I’m off to try and find some leftover pigs in 
blankets, before mulling over some terrific first-half action.The next 45 
minutes is on the way!
 
44 min: Knockaert, of course, sends it goalwards and his looping, curling 
effort crashes on top of Smithies’s goalnet. TheQPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> goalkeeper saw it all the way but it 
was dispatched with some venom.
 
44 min: Lip-reading Holloway and it’s relatively pleasant. “Move, move,” he 
shouts from the touchline. They haven’t been disastrous here by any means. 
Meanwhile, Brighton win a free-kick, after Hall trips Murray 25 yards out. 
There’s only one man for the job, surely?
 
42 min: Another corner for Brighton and this time Dunk goes close! Smithies 
saves from virtually point-blank range, before Stephens picks out Baldock and 
his header is blocked. Another corner follows, before Knockaert runs the ball 
out play. Danger averted forQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>.
 
40 min: Bruno storms down the right, crossing low and Grant Hall does well to 
steer the ball away from Baldock’s feet. Shane Duffy then heads over from the 
resulting corner. Worth mentioning the two teams are now level-pegging in terms 
of possession.
 
38 min: Chris Hughton looks on from the touchline, with a stern face, as if 
his team are behind. They’re not, althoughQPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> are still very much in this one on 
evidence so far. Sam Baldock’s peach from distance remains the difference 
between the two teams at the moment.
 
36 min: And now things calm down a little, with Stephens sending his effort 
towards Row X from just outside the box.
 
35 min: QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> are the better team at 
the moment. And Bong does brilliantly to keep Brighton in front, blocking 
Luongo who was surging into the box with only Stockdale in front of him. 
Brighton, though, counterattack through Knockaert and Baldock unselfishly tries 
to slide the ball across goal for Murray but his pass is cut out. It had opened 
up beautifully.
 
33 min: Some more QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> pressure, 
with little to show for it. First Dunk clears and second time around, the cross 
finds Sylla, who does brilliantly to kill the ball from Bidwell’s cross before 
driving low and wide.
