I took this photograph 10 miles south of our family cotton farm in Lorenzo, 
Texas using a Canon 7D camera and Tokina 11-16mm lens. I grew up here and 
travel back to visit every year for the holidays. It snows in this part of 
Texas but I never remember it snowing this much before.Cory Aycock

I’ve been to New York on many occasions but never visited the coast line of 
Coney Island. New York was just recovering from a snow storm so I jumped on the 
subway and checked this town out. I took this picture with my iPhone 6. In my 
bag I had my Olympus Trip 35 film camera and a Nikon D800, but for street shots 
I usually just use my phone. Sometimes you can’t beat using it as a camera, 
especially if the light is kind.Robin Pope

Still Waters at Langsett Reservoir in the Peak District 
Photograph: Carole Tidball/GuardianWitness

This was taken from the footpath that runs alongside Langsett Reservoir, 
managed and very well-maintained by Yorkshire Water and on the very edge of the 
Peak District National Park. I am fortunate enough to live around four miles 
from the reservoir and it is one of my favourite year-round circular walks 
leading past waterfalls and up into wild moorland, finishing up at the Wagon 
and Horses Inn for some real ale, pies and chips. I love the beautiful muted 
colours on an afternoon stroll in the spring sunshine.

 It was an amazingly still, spring day with barely a ripple on the water. I 
was experimenting with my new, lightweight Fuji X-T1 and a 35 mm F1.4 lens. 
This was a hand-held shot and I had to scramble down a bank to get a clear view 
as surrounding trees lining the footpath encroached on my first attempts.Carole

A Perfect Sunday Evening On Burnham Beach

This is the lower lighthouse on the north side of the beach at Burnham-On-Sea. 
We spend a lot of time walking along the beach in all weather as its a perfect 
place for walking our seven month old Cockapoo Fudge. Sunsets along the beach 
are always stunning, as such its our favourite time of day to go for a walk. My 
eight-year-old daughter Poppy took the picture on a Cannon EOS 11OOD using an 
18-55mm lens. I’m the one doing the cartwheel.Vicky Harris

I live in Whitehaven which is about 12 miles away from Gallows Hill near 
Gosforth in west Cumbria. I often walk in that area. There are a few lonnings 
(country lanes) in that area which are particularly pleasant to walk. This was 
one path I’d not been down before, but as soon as I reached the top of the hill 
and the landscape dropped down through the sunken lane to the farm, I knew it 
would make a superb picture. The macabre history of the hill apparently being 
used for public hangings in medieval times seemed to add to the atmosphere of 
the picture too.Alan Cleaver

I was walking a route I do many times with my black Labrador Merlin, when the 
yellow of the oil seed rape flowers bloomed from a field just off a busy road. 
There is a public footpath through the field so this was the path we took that 
day. It had been quite a dull day in May, but the colours of the flowers were 
stunning and brought a warm and sunny feel with them.Susanne Quinn

This is a shot from my daily commute home by bike from Manchester to Hebden 
Bridge. I was training for a 4,500km MTB race in Canada from Banff to the 
Mexican border with the USA at the time. It was taken with a Sony RX100 Mk1. It 
pretty much lives in my pocket all the time as carrying a Leica around on a 
bike is not so smart.Greg May

This was taken on Bardsea Beach during the school holidays. The weather was a 
surprise to us, as this was the week in June where the whole of the UK was 
bombarded with rain apart from the Lake District which was protected by the 
Pennines and was very warm and sunny. I used a Nikon d3100 with at 35mm lens.

I visited Albania for the first time this year, and this was my favourite 
holiday snap. I love the contrast between the wispy cloud, the sillhouetted 
people and the graffiti on the wall. We were driving on a spectacular coastal 
road along what they now call the Albanian Riviera. The camera was my rather 
retro little Nikon Coolpix p7000 which I love.Penelope Farmer

Marsden Bay lies just north of Sunderland about nine miles away from my home 
in Seaham Harbour, County Durham. I often have a stroll there with my camera. 
That morning I was enjoying a coffee at the Marsden Grotto overlooking the 
beach, when I saw two men pushing their bikes to fish from the shore. There had 
been a mist for a few days but on that day the mist had disappeared leaving a 
beautiful sunny morning.Anne Stancliffe

I live in Portsmouth, the UK’s only island city. You are never far from the 
sea. I regularly take a walk along the seafront especially in the summer, when 
the daylight lasts well into the evening. On this particular day I noticed a 
new structure off shore that I hadn’t seen before - a post that will hold 
navigation lights for large aircraft carriers in the Solent.

It was a beautifully still day with a calm sea and the sun was low on the 
horizon. The contrasting colours of the sea and sky were stunning. I used a 
tripod to keep my Nikon DSLR camera steady for a 13 second exposure. Since then 
several more of these navigation posts have appeared as new features in a 
constantly changing Solent.Jon Neil

Cloud inversion, Lake Pukaki

I moved to New Zealand three years ago. I go up to the lake a few times a year 
as it’s on the way to Aoraki Mount Cook. I took this picture in August when my 
mother and step father were visiting NZ for the first time and I was showing 
them around.
Cloud inversions are quite common on New Zealand’s big lakes in the winter. We 
hit the fog about 20 minutes before the lake and I was really worried my folks 
weren’t going to be able to see Aoraki.

We created a rise a little further round the shore and broke out of the cloud 
to this beautiful view with the classics turquoise colours of the lakes in full 
splendour. Late winter sees fog rolling off the glacier lakes and rivers, 
filling up the Mackenzie Country basin. Luckily for my sightseeing parents, we 
emerged from it coming around the edge of Lake Pukaki and were greeted by this 
beautiful symphony of winter colours.Rose Hanley-Nickolls

This was taken on the Suffolk coast in Aldeburgh, looking out to sea after the 
sun had set behind me. Using a Canon 6D, with a 24-70mm lens at 42mm f/16 
ISO100 for 72 seconds, I attempted to capture in a long exposure of just over a 
minute the wondrous lustrous light and the particular stillness in the sea that 
evening.Phillip Edwards

Close to the former Queen’s Palace at Haagse Bos in the city of The Hague, 
there is a small piece of woodland with a majestic beech lane. It’s a public 
park near a residential area. Fly agarics are quite rare in our region, but 
this is one of the few spots I know of where they can appear. At first it was 
too dry for them to surface, but finally the rain came and they popped up 
immediately. So I got out my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ30 and my bike, and set off 
from my home in 
Voorschoten. I was duly rewarded with this photo. There were so many of them 
this year. It was a sight to behold.Gerrie Stegehuis

We’d been having some nice sunsets that week and on this particular October 
evening I grabbed my camera and headed out. The air was absolutely still and 
the vapour rising from the refinery over in Grangemouth had been hanging around 
in the sky for hours like this. Just as the sun was setting this vapour cloud 
lit up and, in combination with another serendipitous cloud that appeared, 
turned the evening sky into something quite apocalyptic looking.Brian Smith

November dog walk weather

Our dog Florrie gets walked two or three times a day and during the week it 
tends to be in the local park. But at the weekend we like to use the extra time 
to give a bit of variety, so we popped across south Manchester to Chorlton 
where you can get to the banks of the Mersey. While fog isn’t a shock in 
November, it’s not the most common weather phenomenon and can be tricky to 
capture in a photo. I just thought this was a nice moment to get the iPhone out 
and have a go because of the yellow leaves and Florrie’s apparently curious 
stance. In reality she would have been checking for squirrel activity. The fog 
accentuates the relaxing solitude that can be had on a long dog walk.Stuart Fear

was right.Gareth Logue
