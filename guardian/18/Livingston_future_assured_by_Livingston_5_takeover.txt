The future of Livingston appeared to be secured today after the club were sold 
to theLivingston <https://www.theguardian.com/football/livingston> 5 
consortium. The debt-ridden West Lothian outfit had been on the brink of going 
bust this month but have now been rescued by the former Cowdenbeath owner 
Gordon McDougall and the ex-Dumbarton chairman Neil Rankine.

McDougall becomes the club's new chairman, with the ex-Livi director Ged Nixon 
taking the post of chief executive. The news comes on the day Livingston have 
had their appeal heard against their relegation to the Scottish Third Division 
for breaching the Scottish Football Association's insolvency rules.

Livi were put into the hands of Donald McGruther – of administrators Mazars – 
last month after West Lothian Council took legal action to reclaim a £330,000 
debt. McGruther had since been trying to negotiate a sale of the club to the 
Livingston 5 consortium, whose initial rescue plan had been based on Livi 
remaining in the First Division.

The club refused to play last weekend's opening Third Division game of the 
season at East Stirlingshire as they feared prejudicing their appeal against 
their relegation, but they are likely to lose that appeal at Hampden this 
afternoon. Today's takeover announcement appears to demonstrate the 
consortium's readiness to run the club whichever division they end up in.

"I am delighted that the club now has a future in Scottish football and wish 
the new owners every success," McGruther said. "The club also announced they 
had been granted a safety certificate for Almondvale Stadium, allowing them to 
host matches this season.
