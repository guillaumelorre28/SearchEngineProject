 ‘This is nothing like I’ve ever seem’: Christine and the Queens at the O2 
Academy Brixton. Photograph: Richard Isaac/Rex/Shutterstock 
This is the last gig I went to, just before I started the night tsar job. I 
came across her albums in France and she absolutely blew my mind. I gave her 
her first UK airplay on 6 Music in 2014, which I’m very proud about. It’s great 
now that she’s hit the big time. When I saw her live, I thought this is like 
nothing I’ve ever seen: contemporary dance mixed with a big light show. It’s an 
entire artistic vision. It’s not sequenced and showbiz style – there are no 
sequins. It’s different from what you’d expect from a pop star. She gets quite 
emotional on stage, the audience gets emotional as well and it’s a beautiful 
moment we all share.

 ‘It is is disturbing and brutal’: Anastasia performed by the Royal Ballet. 
Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian 
I love ballet, probably because it’s one thing I could never, ever humanly do. 
Watching the dancers takes you into a completely different space. I find it 
really helpful for working out problems. Most of the music is by Tchaikovsky, 
and it’s choreographed byKenneth MacMillan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jan/15/kenneth-macmillan-ballet-dance>. 
The first two-thirds are classical ballet, so pretty and lovely, then at the 
end, when Anastasia is in a mental institution, there’s German expressionist 
modern dance. It jars because it is disturbing and brutal. It’s so demanding 
for the prima ballerina. You have to be an incredible dancer and proficient in 
so many kinds of dance.

This is a film I’ve seen many times, but it’s something I’m really looking 
forward to seeing again because the BFI has itsScorsese season 
<https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=scorsese&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=>
 beginning in January. I could not be more excited about it as he’s one of my 
favourite film directors. The season is also showing some films that have 
influenced him, a strand he has programmed. His new film,Silence, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/10/silence-review-the-last-temptation-of-liam-neeson-in-scorseses-shattering-epic>
 is debuting as part of the season, but I’ve chosenMean Streets because it’s 
one of his earliest films and you can see how it’s influenced every film he’s 
done. It also made me fall in love with Harvey Keitel. It’s just a very sad, 
sexy film.

 ‘Pay a little extra and get kd lang guiding you through meditation’: the Stop, 
Breathe & Think app. 
This is a mindfulness meditation app put together by a charitable education 
foundation <http://www.stopbreathethink.org/about.html> in the US, where they 
teach kids in inner-city schools simple meditation techniques. There are lots 
of different options: things for anxiety, for getting a positive outlook on the 
day. The one for falling asleep is amazing – it really does the trick. The 
bonus is thatkd lang 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/10/kd-lang-music> is involved in 
the project, so you can pay a little extra and get her helping you do guided 
meditation through your earphones. It’s like pouring chocolate and honey into 
your ears. I also loveDuolingo <https://www.duolingo.com/> – I’ve been trying 
to learn some simple Polish phrases on it and I’ve not been very successful, 
but it’s a lot of fun.

I’m addicted to radio and have been since I was a child. I think in every 
photo my parents have of me, I have a little yellow transistor radio glued to 
my ear. WNYC is the national public radio station for New York and I listen to 
it via a phone app. I find it interesting to hear the kinds of things that 
matter to New Yorkers in their city life. A couple of broadcasters, in 
particular, are superb:Brian Lehrer <http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl>, who has a 
political programme, andDavid Remnick 
<http://www.wnyc.org/people/david-remnick/>, editor of the New Yorker 
<http://www.newyorker.com/> magazine, who presents The New Yorker Radio Hour. 
It’s always a great collection of people and topics.

<http://www.thesocietyclub.com/events-1/2016/12/16/soho-poetry-nights-iii-anthology-book-launch>
 is poetry, but unlike any other show I’ve been to. Every 10 minutes, someone 
will stand up, the room will go quiet, they’ll read a poem for a minute or two, 
and then sit down and everyone carries on drinking. Another 10 minutes later, 
somebody else stands up and does the same thing. It punctuates the conversation 
in such a lovely way; the cocktails are amazing, too. It’s one of those hidden 
places you think don’t exist any more – but this one does.

 ‘To call them cabaret doesn’t really describe it’: Bourgeois & Maurice. 
Photograph: Christa Holka 
They’re the most acerbic cabaret. To call them cabaret doesn’t really describe 
it because the lyrics are so acidic, biting, political and satirical. It’s 
clever, super-politicised cabaret. Their appearance is quite whimsical – 
they’re dressed in sequin onesies and huge wigs – which contrasts with the 
message. They sing songs about how we could save the world but we’re all just 
too busy, we haven’t got the time. It’s very topical. They’ve written a great, 
sad song about Brexit,British Values 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nOuYlIc5lU>, their version of a national 
anthem, which is quite shocking, but so truthful. I suggested they release it 
as a single.
