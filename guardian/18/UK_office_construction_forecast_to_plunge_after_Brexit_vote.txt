The Brexit vote will lead to a slump in office construction, with up to half 
of planned developments in central London likely to be postponed or scrapped in 
coming years, according to estate agentSavills 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/savills>.

Commercial development has barely recovered from the post-financial crisis 
slump, and the uncertainty surrounding the terms of Britain’s departure from 
the EU will trigger another 30% to 40% decline across the country in the next 
five years,Savills said in its annual forecasts 
<http://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/173549/211676-0>. Central London 
will be worst hit.

Its report said: “The seismic shock of the Brexit vote brought transactional 
activity in many cases to a juddering halt, a pause at least to reconsider 
pricing as opposed to pulling out of deals.”

Several commercial property funds suspended trading 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/07/property-fund-turmoil-continues-as-legal-and-general-foreign-and-colonial-reveal-cut-in-value>
 in the summer to stop withdrawals from panicking investors fearing a collapse 
in property values, but all funds have sincere-opened 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/24/property-funds-back-brexit-vote-closures>
.

Worried about the impact of Brexit on the City, banks are considering moving 
operations to mainland Europe and there have beenwarnings that 100,000 jobs 
could go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/23/100000-clearing-jobs-at-risk-from-brexit-vote-stock-exchange-chief>
 if London loses its ability to process euro-denominated transactions. This 
would sharply reduce demand for new office space.

Savills is predicting a 4% fall in UK office prices next year followed by a 1% 
drop in 2018. Thereafter it forecasts a slow return to growth, pencilling in 
price increases of 1.1% in 2019, 2.5% in 2020 and 3.2% in 2021. This translates 
into 1.6% growth over the five-year period.

Mat Oakley, head of UK & European commercial research at Savills, said: “In 
London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> offices we have seen about a 5% 
fall this year, and there is probably another 2% to 3% to go – assuming we get 
a reasonably soft Brexit.”

The gloomy predictions come a week after the City’s biggest tower, 1 
Undershaft, received planning permission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/28/trellis-1-undershaft-skyscraper-london-green-light-building>
. The developer, Singapore-based Aroland Holdings, says it will house 10,000 
workers. Another tower at 22 Bishopsgate has also been given the green light. 
The developer, French-owned fund management firm Axa, had warned before the 
referendum that that it might pull out in the event of a Brexit vote, but 
decided to push ahead in October.

Oakley said there had been an increase in overseas investors piling into 
London offices 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/inside-china-passion-foreign-property-investment-uk>
 and other UK commercial assets since the June referendum, all attracted by the 
weaker pound. As domestic investors are in retreat, the proportion of foreign 
buyers is about to rise to a record high of about 60% between October and 
December, up from a recent average of 42%.

While the Brexit vote came as a shock in June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/commercial-property-prices-brexit-clauses-ubs>
, other events such as the election of Donald Trump in the US and the upcoming 
elections in France and Germany next year meant that the UK is regarded as 
somewhat less risky than before, he added.

 With London property so expensive, investors from the Middle East have been 
hunting for cheaper deals outside the capital, in places such as Birmingham, 
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Bristol.

The Savills report said: “Lower levels of domestic demand, particularly at 
larger lot sizes will give non-domestic investors a clearer playing field.” The 
next five years are likely to experience record levels of international 
investment in commercial property outside London, ranging from office blocks to 
shopping centres, warehouses and data centres.

Mark Ridley, chief executive of Savills UK and Europe, said: “The sterling 
devaluation has made UK property very attractive for international investors 
pegged to the dollar or euro, with 2017 activity in central London likely to be 
dominated by Asian investors, with American and pan-European investors also 
strong nationally.”

Sterling has lost 13% of its value against the dollar since the referendum and 
is down almost 9% against the euro. At one stageit had lost almost 20% of its 
value

Another draw for foreign investors is that they continue to be taxed in the 
same way as UK buyers, unlike countries such as the US which have imposed extra 
non-dom taxes.

Savills also sees an end to the post-credit crunch house price boom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/04/end-property-boom-uk-house-prices-flatline-savills-forecast>
, forecasting that residential prices will flatline next year after five years 
of increases. London’s luxury property market has been hit in particular, as 
Brexit uncertainty and increased stamp duty have been putting off foreign 
buyers.

Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, noted that there had 
been a shift in housing policy under housing and planning minister Gavin 
Barwell, with a bigger emphasis on building more homes across a wider range of 
tenures such as homes for rent. But a representative fromChurch Commissioners, 
who manage the Church of England’s £7bn investment fund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/16/church-of-england-sells-investments-fearing-market-slowdown>
, suggested that Cook was painting too rosy a picture.
