Owen Coyle, the Blackburn Rovers manager, was full of praise for Charlie 
Mulgrew after the Scot scored the winner in a 1-0 victory againstNewcastle 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited>.

The decisive moment came in the 74th minute when Mulgrew’s free-kick – 
Blackburn’s first shot on target – found the bottom corner to decide the

It was his second goal of the season – the first came in the 75th minute of 
the corresponding fixture between the sides, when he again scored the only goal 
of the game. Blackburn had spent much of the game on the back foot and relied 
on resolute defending and goalkeeping.

It is Blackburn’s first win and clean sheet since defeating Newcastle at the 
end of November

, and after their first home victory since 19 November, Coyle could not hide 
his delight at having a player of Mulgrew’s ability at his disposal. “You know 
you’re getting a wonderful player and a proper leader, which is not too common 
in the game these days,” Coyle said. “He’s been like that from day one. He’s 
such an accomplished and wonderful player, composed on the ball and as good as 
anybody in this division, there’s no doubt about it.

“He popped up with his free-kick, which was a wonderful strike, and then had 
to be brave with those leadership skills at the back, organising everybody and 
standing up to a real test.”

Blackburn’s defence has been their main problem this season, with only three 
clean sheets – but after watching his side shut out Newcastle for the second 
time, Coyle was delighted.

The Rovers manager said: “I think we knew we would have to do a lot of things 
very well. We would have to defend for our lives at times because we’re playing 
against, for me, a quality side. We felt we could cause them problems but 
always accepting Newcastle will work your backline all day long.

“Charlie popped up with a wonderful free-kick and then again we had to stand 
up to be counted. We had to be brave in that defending. It’s all credit to the 
group that have really stood up to a good team and have got a wonderful three 
points.”

Newcastle have now lost two of their past three games and been replaced at the 
top of the table by Brighton. It was the first time they have failed to score 
in an away league gamesince the campaign’s opener at Fulham in early August

 and the manager Rafael Benítez was at a loss to explain how his side came out 
of the game without anything to show for their dominance.

“The stats in the first half, the chances and the possession were in our 
favour and it’s difficult to explain,” Benítez said. “What we had to do is keep 
doing the same things in the second half and we started with two goals 
disallowed and the same control.

“We lost maybe, for five minutes, control of the game, and conceded the goal. 
They put a lot of bodies in the box and it’s not easy to find space, but it’s 
difficult to explain. How can you not even draw, and lose this game? It’s 
incredible.

“For me, to see the team playing so well and not winning the game is difficult 
to understand but we have to carry on trying to play in the same way, trying to 
create as many chances as today and trying to take our chances.

“The only thing we didn’t do is to score when we had a lot of chances, 
especially in the first half. If we continue playing like this, we will win 
games.”
