What was the first song you ever bought?

Daddy Cool – Boney M
I bought it on 7in from Woolworths in Archway in London, where I grew up. I 
was about six and I couldn't really speak English, I only spoke Turkish. I 
think I gravitated to it because it had the word "daddy" in the title. I 
wouldn't play it now but there are some Boney M songs that still stand up 
today. My parents were really into music: I'm named after a Turkish singer.

What song always gets you dancing?

If You Want Me to Stay – Sly and the Family Stone
I love the way the whole record unfolds. If I'm anywhere where it's being 
played I know I'm somewhere good. It has a political level to it. I don't get a 
chance to dance that much these days but when you're DJing you need to be 
dancing on the inside. I'm always wary of DJs who stand totally still when 
they're playing.

What song takes you back to your childhood?

Friend or Foe – Adam Ant
I was a big Adam Ant fan when I was in primary school. One day, when I was 10, 
we were allowed to take records into assembly to play to the whole school and I 
took this. There were some confused faces. That was my first DJ gig, I suppose. 
I asked my teacher not to call me by my name in registration but to call meAdam

What is your perfect love song?

Close to You – Karen Carpenter
I grew up with it – it's one of those records I know I will have forever. 
Karen Carpenter is one of my favourite vocalists. She has a beautiful way of 
pronouncing words. She's pretension-free in a very pure way.

What song would you want at your funeral?

Don't You Know – Jan Hammer Group
I don't want anything too maudlin or too jokey. This song has a nice sentiment 
to it. It's one of my favourite new old records and I included it onmy latest 
Bugged In mix <http://erolalkan.co.uk/?p=9104>.

Time for the encore. One last song that makes you, you.

Be My Baby – The Ronettes
I've been infatuated with it since I can remember. I associate it with my life 
more than any other record. I never tire of it. There's not a note out of place.
