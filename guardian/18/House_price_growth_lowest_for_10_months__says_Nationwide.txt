Despite the slowdown, Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the 
latest increase is in line with growth rates seen since early 2015. In October, 
an annual increase of 4.6% was recorded.

Gardner said: “There are some signs that, despite the uncertain economic 
outlook, demand conditions have strengthened a little in recent months, 
reflecting the impact of solid labour market conditions and historically low 
borrowing costs. Mortgage approvals increased in October, and surveyors report 
that new buyer inquiries have increased modestly.

“The relatively low number of homes on the market and modest rates of housing 
construction are likely to keep the demand/supply balance fairly tight in the 
quarters ahead, even if economic conditions weaken, as most forecasters expect.”

Gardner pointed to data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showing the 
popularity of fixed mortgage rates as borrowers lock into ultra-low-rate deals.

He said: “Data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders suggests that over 90% of 
new mortgages were contracted on fixed rates over the past 12 months. This may 
be driven by a desire to lock in record low interest rates.

“The proportion of new mortgage lending contracted on fixed rates has 
increased considerably since the low point in 2010, when less than half of 
lending was on fixed rates. In recent years, the proportion of lending 
accounted for by fixed-rate deals has persisted at levels well above those 
prevailing before the financial crisis.

“Fixed-rate deals are most popular amongst first-time buyers for whom 
certainty over monthly payments is likely to be particularly important. Indeed, 
over the past 12 months 95% of new mortgage lending to first-time buyers was on 
fixed rates.”

Gardner said the average rates on fixed-rate deals have edged down in recent 
years, adding: “For borrowers with a 10% deposit, two-year fixed rates are 
currently the lowest on record, at 2.42%.”

Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of 
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), said the housing market 
tends to slow down in the run-up to Christmas.

He said the figures “reflect the struggle between those trying to take 
advantage of very low interest rates and softening house prices versus those 
showing caution in view of the economic and political uncertainty. The result 
is modest house price increases mainly because of the continuing shortage of 
supply”.

Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 
“House prices look likely to rise modestly in the near term.

“However, we suspect that house prices will come under increasing pressure as 
2017 progresses and may edge down over the year, possibly by around 2%.”

Archer said a lack of homes on the market would help to keep prices up.
