toxic air pollution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/06/delhi-air-pollution-closes-schools-for-three-days>
 that have prompted authorities to declare an “emergency situation” in the city.

Locals have expressed their concern over the dangerous smog on Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter>, with some saying they have 
been forced to take their families out of Delhi due to concerns over their 
health. Others said they had not seen the sunrise in more than a week due to 
the haze that clogs the sky.

Delhi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/delhi> is suffering from its seventh 
consecutive day of heavy smog, which is a result of farmers in India’s northern 
plains setting fire to their fields combined with revellers setting off 
firecrackers to mark the Diwali festival.

The toxic haze hanging over the city contains concentrations of harmful 
particles that are so high they cannot be measured by most air quality 
instruments.

Using the hashtags #DelhiSmog and #DelhiChokes, residents and tourists posted 
about their experiences of the pollution on Twitter.

There was little escape from the toxic cloud, even inside.

It's 5:45 and @FaithGoldy <https://twitter.com/FaithGoldy> and I can't sleep 
because our lungs are so bad right now. There's smog in the hotel hallways.

Journalists covering the visit by the British prime minister Theresa May to 
Delhi also noted the hazardous conditions.
