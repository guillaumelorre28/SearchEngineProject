Housing <https://www.theguardian.com/society/housing> providers can apply for 
a share of a £7bn fund to increase the supply of affordable homes, the 
government has announced.

As of 5 January, housing associations, local authorities and private 
developers in England are able to bid for funding to build thousands of shared 
ownership, rent-to-buy and affordable rented homes in what the Department for
Communities <https://www.theguardian.com/society/communities> and Local 
Government described as a “dramatic expansion” of its housing programme.


However, the £7bn figure is compiled from previous announcements. It is made 
up of £4.7bn ingrants announced in April 2016

, £1.4bn that wasannounced in the November 2016 autumn statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/24/housing-gets-4bn-boost-to-increase-number-of-new-homes>
, and about £1bn that was allocated under a previous affordable homes programme.


The £1.4bn will be available to housing associations and councils and used to 
fund work on 40,000 additional affordable homes by 2021. The government has 
already said the £4.7bn of cash available between now and 2021 would help 
deliver at least 135,000 shared ownership homes, 10,000 rent-to-buy properties, 
and 8,000 homes for supported living and older people to rent.

Under rent to buy, rents will be set at or below 80% of the local market rent 
for a set period in order to give tenants the opportunity to save for a deposit 
and then the option to buy their home.


Work should soon be able to start on the first of these homes after the 
government announced that the housing providers which had successfully been 
allocated a total of nearly £1.3bn from this £4.7bn pot were due to be named 
today.


The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “Our newly expanded affordable 
housing programme, turbo-charged by a multibillion-pound investment, will allow 
housing associations to build more homes in places where they are most needed, 
particularly for families who are just about managing.


“By encouraging the delivery of more homes under a variety of tenures, we can 
create a housing market which truly works for everyone, meeting the diverse 
housing needs of this country.”
