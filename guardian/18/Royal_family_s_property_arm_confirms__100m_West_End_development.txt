The royal family’s commercial property arm will press ahead with a £100m West 
End development that had been placed under review following the UK’s decision 
to quit the EU.

The Crown Estate confirmed that it would begin the redevelopment of Duke’s 
Court

, a mixed retail and office block, in St James’s. The plans form part of a 
wider £500m investment programme in the area.

James Cooksey, director of central London

committed to re-establishing St James’s as a world-class business and lifestyle 
destination.

“Such an investment reflects our belief in the fundamentals of London’s West 
End, notwithstanding the near-term market outlook, and its continued 
performance over the long term through creating fantastic buildings that stand 
the test of time.”

The project will be delivered by Skanska and is set to be completed in spring 
2019.

The Crown Estate owns around half the buildings in the area and earlier this 
year it completed the £400m St James’s Market redevelopment with Oxford 
Properties, creating 260,000 sq ft of office space, seven restaurants and five 
shops.

Last year the property empire delivered a record £304.1m to Treasury coffers

and saw the value of its portfolio rise 9.7% to £12bn.

The Crown Estate, which owns large swaths of land and property across Britain, 
said its income rose 6.7% as it reaped the benefits of a regeneration plan and 
its offshore wind assets.
