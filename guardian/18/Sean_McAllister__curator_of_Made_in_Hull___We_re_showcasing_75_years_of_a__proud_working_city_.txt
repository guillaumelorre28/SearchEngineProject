The 51-year-old documentary-maker is best known for his award-winning 2015 film
A Syrian Love Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/a-syrian-love-story-review-refugees>
. Born in Hull, he left school at 16 and spent periods signing on and working 
in a pea factory before going to the National Film and Television School at 28. 
He is the curator ofMade in Hull 
<https://www.hull2017.co.uk/whatson/events/madeinhull/>, a week-long event 
involving projections on and installations in landmark buildings, created by a 
team of local and international artists. Opening tonight, it launches Hull’s 
reign as UK City of Culture 2017. He and his partner, Ruth, live with their 
three children in Brixton.

What’s the idea behind Made in Hull?
We have a trail through the city that people can take for six hours each 
evening over seven days. It covers 75 years of a proud working city that has 
taken some knocks and has overcome them. Hull was the second most bombed city 
in the country in the second world war. Its heyday was in the 60s, when 
fishermen would come back from a three- or four-day fishing trip as 
millionaires. After that, the Icelandic wars [over territorial fishing rights] 
caused the demise of that industry and a recession. Now Hull’s the City of 
Culture, and it’s got thismarvellous contract with Siemens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/01/hull-siemens-factory-wind-turbine-blades>
 [to build offshore wind turbines], which is bringing hope and jobs.

What kind of artworks will we see?
There’s a 15-minute surroundsound piece 
<http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-city-centre-will-be-transformed-with-an-epic-light-show-smoke-machines-and-animations/story-29928419-detail/story.html>
 on the whole history in Victoria Square by Hungarian animator Zsolt Balogh. 
The caravan industry is big in Hull so we have a piece on the history of that 
in one shop window in Whitefriargate, and a caravan with actors performing a 
comedic piece in another.Jesse Kanda <http://www.jessekanda.com>, who has 
worked with Björk, is doing a piece about nightclubbing, which was a big scene 
in Hull. And on the Deep, the aquarium on the Humber, we are doing a piece 
about immigration calledDepartures and Arrivals: Hull voted 68% to leave 
Europe, although it has been made up of a mix of people since [local 
anti-slavery campaigner] William Wilberforce’s time.

Our aim is to involve the working class, because they don’t naturally feel 
part of what's called art or culture

Hull was voted “worst place to live” in the book Crap Towns in 2003 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-said-hull-was-the-worst-town-in-the-uk-in-my-crap-towns-book-but-now-i-m-queuing-to-visit-8952488.html>
…
People embraced that [laughs]! They made T-shirts saying “It’s never dull in 
Hull”. Although of course it was. Now, within the city, there is so much going 
on subculturally, small things that just spring up and spread on social media. 
You go to a speakeasy or a performance poetry night and it is absolutely packed 
on a Monday night.

What will being City of Culture mean to Hull?
There is something about being at the end of the M62 – geographically it is 
the end of the road. There’s a kind of cultural disconnect with the rest of the 
world because of that. As City of Culture, for the first time, we feel people 
are looking in and interested in what is going on inHull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hull>.

This seems a departure from your international documentaries or studies of 
Hull’s working classes…
I wanted to say no when I was offered it, but it was one of those 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that you can’t walk away from, and it opened 
my eyes to a different way of working, with a huge team, delegating a lot of 
the ideas. Our aim was to make the working-class population, 280,000 people, 
feel involved, because those people don’t naturally feel involved in what is 
called art or culture. Having worked in factories and come from that culture 
myself, I don’t naturally feel that is my world either.

What does Hull mean to you?
I have lived in Brixton for 20-odd years but when I talk about home, I still 
mean Hull. My parents are 92 and 93 and still live there, and my sisters and my 
friends. Whenever I have made a film abroad, I’ve always come back to make a 
film in Hull. I thought, if I’m going to make a film in Britain, I might as 
well make it in a place where no one else will [laughs].
