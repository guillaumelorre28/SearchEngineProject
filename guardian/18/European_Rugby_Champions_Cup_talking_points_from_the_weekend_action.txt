1) Clermont’s exclusion of Davies may delight Gatland

Jonathan Davies was nowhere to be seen, the Clermont centres on the Saturday 
being Aurélien Rougerie and Wesley Fofana. They were selected by the new head 
coach, Franck Azéma, on form in the Top 14 rather than reputation. It is not 
only at Racing Métro in Paris that the worth of Welsh imports is being 
questioned. That all-important members of Warren Gatland’s Wales are failing to 
light up France can be seen as a worry – or by the Wales coach perhaps with 
delight. Warren-ball seems to have a formula whose secrets do not travel well 
abroad, and his boys will be coming home to him in November rested and raring.

2) Onward Christian soldier

There is sharp and then there is Christian Wade. The three Leinster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/leinster> defenders he left sprawling in his 
wake will definitely not be the last people this season to be left for dead by 
the Wasps wing whose finishing ability will surely see him restored to the 
England squad this week. “Christian has struggled a little bit with his 
confidence this season but we’ve always known what he’s capable of,” said 
Wasps’ director of rugby Dai Young. “On a big stage he can always do something 
special.”Robert Kitson

3) Will Toulon be too good again?

Have the rest of the clubs in Europe had enough time to work out a plan to 
stop Toulon making it three European titles in a row? Is it just that they have 
the best players, and the biggest bench, or is it their style? Are they more 
vulnerable without the generally conservative Jonny Wilkinson at outside half? 
Double champions they may be, but teams can score tries against them - the
Scarlets <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/scarlets> scored two and Glasgow 
got four at Stade Mayol last season. Matt Giteau brings different qualities to 
the No 10 jersey compared to Wiliknson. Is he the man to guide Toulon to an 
unprecedented European treble?Tom Edwards

4) Tigers profit from TMO technicality

Leicester’s evening was launched by Owen Williams’s try, which was referred to 
the TMO with the second of the two questions – “Is there any reason why I can’t 
award a try?” This means the referee’s instinct is that a try has been scored, 
and it’s over to the TMO to prove otherwise. The second question arose, 
reasonably, because the burden of proof for a try should normally be on the 
try-scoring side, but sometimes you can’t see for sure, even though it is clear 
to the referee and everyone else that the ball probably was grounded. On this 
occasion, though, it seemed it probably wasn’t, but because the second question 
had been asked the TMO could not deny the score. It’s all deeply 
unsatisfactory. There’s got to be another way. Hawkeye technology has been 
mooted lately, which would be invaluable for adjudicating on things like 
forward passes, but presumably wouldn’t be much use for seeing through a pile 
of bodies. Isn’t there some sort of electronic chip that could be inserted into 
a rugby ball? Don’t ask me how it would work, but surely there are boffins at 
Nasa who have a spare moment or two to think it through. If they can land 
people on the moon, etc …Michael Aylwin

5) An ill wind favours Quins

Sometimes games can be shaped by little details invisible to the paying 
public. Friday night at The Stoop was a good example, with Castres paying the 
penalty for not studying the local weather forecast. Conor O’Shea, Quins’ 
director of rugby, knew there was wind and rain racing in from the south-west 
and was delighted to have the elements at his side’s backs in the second half. 
“We knew where the weather was coming from and wanted to play into the wind 
during the first half. FortunatelyCastres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castres> made the decision to kick-off after 
winning the toss which allowed us to play into the breeze before it picked up.” 
O’Shea also suggested first-time fatherhood had been a factor in Danny Care’s 
sharp performance, with the England squad due to be announced on Wednesday: “I 
think he’s looking forward to four weeks’ sleep in Pennyhill Park. That’s 
probably why he wanted to play so well.”Robert Kitson

6) Dan not the man for Racing, yet

The Wales and Lions flanker Dan Lydiate sat in a blazer in a fenced off area 
at the front of the stand reserved for replacements and squad players who did 
not make the match 23. The Six Nations player of 2013 has only started two 
matches for Racing this season, both defeats, with the Paris club playing him 
left and right at wing forward rather than a specialist blindside. It is a 
waste of talent that may cost Wales in November with a key member of their pack 
lacking minutes on the pitch, but it also reflects how rich French clubs 
sometimes buy players for the sake of it rather than for what they will add, 
names-dropping leading to names being dropped. Wales want to rescue him from 
the wilderness and given Racing’s cynical approach at the breakdown, the 
uncomplicated Lydiate does not belong in Colombes.Paul Rees

7) Not a vintage Munster, but still a good one

Ronan O’Gara may be long gone and coaching on the other side of the Channel, 
but the memory of Munster’s cussedness lingers on. This squad is not in the 
same class of the sides which twice took the Heineken Cup and early season form 
was iffy until they beat Leinster in front of 40,000 in Dublin. But the spirit 
is still there and under new coach Anthony Foley, captain of the 
Heineken-winning 2006 side, bothClermont Auvergne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/clermontauvergne> and Saracens will find a 
trip to Thomond Park daunting.Mike Averis

8) Warriors show spirit and style

Glasgow’s victory over Bath was noticeable not for the Scots coming out on the 
winning side but for the manner with which Gregor Townsend’s team got there. 
The style with which they responded to an early Jonathan Joseph try, the 
dominance in the set-piece and aggression, accuracy and decision-making in the 
loose, and the flowing ambition in attack, proved too much for leading 
Premiership sideBath <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bath>. Crucially, now 
Glasgow have finishers scattered across the field, the try-scorers Mark 
Bennett, Sean Maitland, Tommy Seymour and Niko Matawalu only some of them. And 
that is perhaps where Glasgow now differ to sides of the past who produced 
great one-off triumphs but could not back it up.David Ferguson

9) Baker blow for Ospreys – and Wales

When Dan Baker went over the line to score Ospreys’s fourth try during the 
42-7 cruise over Treviso, it seemed it could be just the start of a brilliant 
week for the young No8. His blistering form this season at the heart of a side 
who have won six from six in the Pro12 has not gone unnoticed by Warren 
Gatland. The Wales coach seemed certain to pick him in his squad for the autumn 
internationals where he would have provided stiff competition for Taulupe 
Faletau as a ball-carrying back-rower. But a troubling injury in the 59th 
minute of Ospreys’ match against Treviso has scuppered his chances, and the 
sight of a potential Welsh star being stretchered off the pitch in a neck brace 
will not have been welcomed by anyone - particularly those at the club, who 
will know they have sterner tests than Treviso ahead. Arguably one of the best 
Welsh players of the season so far, there will be many in both the Ospreys and 
the Wales camps wishing him a speedy return.Tom Bryant
