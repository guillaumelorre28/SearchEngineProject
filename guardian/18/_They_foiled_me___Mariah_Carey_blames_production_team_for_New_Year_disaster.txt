Mariah Carey <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mariahcarey> has issued a 
partial explanation for her glitch-plagued performance in New York City on New 
Year’s Eve, saying she was “put into the hands of a production team with 
technical issues who chose to capitalise on circumstances beyond our control”.

“Listen guys,” she said in an audio file posted to Twitter. “They foiled me … 
it turned into an opportunity to humiliate me.”

Dick Clark Productions, which produced the show for ABC, said earlier this 
week that reports Carey’s performance may have been sabotaged with a faulty 
earpiece were “absurd”.

In her statement, Carey said her “ear monitors were not working at all”.

The singer, 47, performed in Times Square as part of Dick Clark’s New Year’s 
Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest. Experiencing technical difficulties after 
starting strongly, she stopped performing as pre-recorded vocals continued to 
play.


“Let the audience sing,” she said. “I’m trying to be a good sport here.”

Her first response

after the concert was more pithy than Sunday’s statement. Early on New Year’s 
Day, Carey posted to Twitter a gif that simply said: “Shit happens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/01/mariah-carey-shrugs-off-new-years-eve-performance-trouble-in-message-to-fans>
.”

The celebrity news site TMZ later reported that a source 
<http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/01/mariah-carey-new-years-eve-performance-sabotage-emotion/>
 in “Mariah’s team” believed the production company may have “sabotaged” 
Carey’s performance by providing her with a faulty earpiece, in order to score 
ratings.

In response, Dick Clark Productions issued a statement 
<http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/02/mariah-carey-new-years-eve-fail/>. “To suggest 
that [a] producer of music shows including the American music awards, Billboard 
music awards, New Year’s Rockin’ Eve and Academy of Country Music awards would 
ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, 
outrageous and frankly absurd.”

The statement added: “We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for 
Ms Carey as an artist and acknowledge her tremendous accomplishments in the 
industry.”

On Sunday, Carey said: “I haven’t really addressed the situation that happened 
on New Years Eve and in time I will, but for now I want everyone to know I came 
to New York in great spirits and was looking forward to a celebratory moment 
with the world.

“It’s a shame that we were put into the hands of a production team with 
technical issues who chose to capitalise on circumstances beyond our control.”

Amid the social-media-driven furor after the New Year’s performance, some 
observers expressed shock that Carey had been lip-syncing.

“It’s not practical for a singer to sing live and to be able to hear 
themselves properly in the middle of Times Square,” Carey said on Sunday, “with 
all the noise, the freezing cold, the smoke machines, thousands of people 
celebrating, especially when their ear monitors were not working at all.

“Listen guys, they foiled me. Thus it turned into an opportunity to humiliate 
me and all those who were excited to celebrate the new year with me.”

She added: “Eventually I will explain this in greater detail to anyone who 
cares to hear it. I cannot deny that my feelings are hurt but I’m working 
through this and I’m truly grateful for my fans and my true friends, who have 
been so supportive in this time.

“I’m going to take a break from media moments, social-media moments although I 
am going to fulfil my professional obligations. This is an important time for 
me to finally take a moment for myself and to be with my loved ones and prepare 
for my upcoming tour in March.

“I just want to thank everyone for their support, thank you my industry 
friends and thank you to my fans, you’re always there for me, I can’t imagine 
life without you and you’ll always be a part of me. I can’t wait to sing for 
you again.”
