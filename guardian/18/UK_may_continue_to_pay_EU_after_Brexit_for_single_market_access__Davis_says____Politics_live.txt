Lunchtime summary

 * David Davis has suggested that the government would consider making 
contributions to the EU budget in exchange for access to the single market, 
saying his Department for Exiting the EU would consider all options to get the 
best deal with the bloc.

 * Tony Blair has announced that he is creating a new organisation to support 
politicians who are fighting “the new populism of left and right”. Explaining 
his plan on his website 
<http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/news/entry/tony-blair-announcement-on-new-organisation/>
he said: 
This new populism may differ in some respects between left and right – the 
left anti-business, the right anti-immigrant – but in others what is remarkable 
is the convergence between them, especially around isolationism and 
protectionism, in what is an essentially closed-minded approach to 
globalisation and its benefits and to international engagement.

So we want to add a fourth pillar to what we do. I emphasise this is not in 
place of our other work but in addition to it.

This is the creation of a platform designed to build a new policy agenda for 
the centre ground together with the networks which link people up, and allow a 
reasonable and evidence based discussion of the future which avoids the plague 
of social media-led exchanges of abuse.

This platform will have a policy unit which will draw on the best ideas and 
practical solutions, building partnerships with other organisations, in the 
public policy and private spheres, so that those in the frontline of politics 
have a bigger and better policy agenda to reflect upon; and a networking 
capability to join like-minded people up.

This is not a think tank. There are enough of those, many doing excellent work 
we would want to utilise. It is a platform for engagement to inform and support 
the practising politician.

 * Immigration to Britain hit its highest ever annual level of 650,000 in the 
run-up to the Brexit referendum, fuelled by record numbers of EU migrants 
coming to work in “the jobs factory of Europe”, new official figures have 
revealed. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/01/immigration-to-uk-hit-record-levels-in-run-up-to-brexit-vote-latest-figures-show>
 * Sir Michael Wilshaw, the outgoing Ofsted chief inspector, has linked the 
Brexit vote to the failure to raise education standards in parts of England. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/dec/01/ofsted-chief-michael-wilshaw-links-divide-in-education-to-malaise-behind-brexit-vote>
 * Theresa May wanted children of parents unlawfully in the UK to be dropped 
to the bottom of lists for school places, according to reports of leaked 
Cabinet Office letters. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/01/may-wanted-to-deprioritise-school-places-for-children-of-people-illegally-in-uk>
 * Voters have been going to the polls in the Richmond Park byelection. 
That’s all from me for the moment.

Tonight I will be blogging from the Richmond Park byelection count. I’ll 
launch the blog at around 10pm and you’ll find it here.

Thanks for the comments.

Ed Balls says he would 'love' to return to politics

Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor and Strictly star, was on the BBC’s 
Victoria Derbyshire show this morning and he told the programme he would “love” 
to return to politics. He also said that he was not planning a comeback, and 
that he thought it might not happen, but nevertheless his comments were quite 
striking.

It is a really, really difficult time for the country so it would be foolish 
for me to pretend that I don’t miss it. I miss it very much, but I think maybe 
I had my time.

Once you have been a cabinet minister, you always hanker after having that 
kind of responsibility and difficulty and public service again.

So if I spent the next 15 years never having a chance to do public service 
again, I would feel as though I’d missed out. I’d love to do that, but how and 
in what way and where, I don’t know and that’s OK.

I really wanted to be chancellor and I think I probably missed my chance last 
year and I’ve not been thinking about being re-elected again because it’s a 
long process.

But I’m not going to say to you that I can never imagine it because there is a 
little part of me that thinks that, having done it once and knowing how hard it 
is and how important and how people much people depend on you ... If I said to 
you that there wasn’t a bit of me that hankered, that would be untrue, but it 
is not the plan and I think it is probably the wrong thing, but I don’t know.

Balls has never categorically ruled out a return to politics in any of the 
interviews he has given since losing his seat in the 2015 general election, but 
he has always implied that it is a remote possibility. Today’s comments suggest 
that a comeback of some kind is less unlikely than we assumed.

The department for business has put out a press release today 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eu-nationals-remain-eligible-for-postgraduate-support-from-uks-research-councils>
 about government support for EU postgraduates who are studying in the UK that 
says “funding support will cover the duration of their course,even if the UK 
leaves the EU”.(My italics.) 

Does that mean Brexit might not actually mean Brexit? Er, no. The department 
says it would be wrong to read that as meaning it is planning for the 
possibility that the UK might not leave the EU. It just seems to be loose 
drafting.

Brexit questions in the Commons - Summary

Often cabinet ministers can waltz through an hour of taking questions in the 
Commons without saying anything of interest, butDavid Davis, the Brexit 
secretary, is more willing to engage with questions than some of his colleagues 
and today’s Brexit questions was quite revealing. Here are the key points.

 * Davis said the government may continue to pay the EU after it leaves for 
access to the single market.Labour’s Wayne David asked if the government would 
consider “making any contribution in any shape or form for access to the single 
market” after Brexit. Davis replied: 
The major criterion here is that we get the best possible access for goods and 
services to the European market. And if that is included in what he’s talking 
about, then of course we will consider it.

 * Davis said that he was opposed to the European commission’s plan to conduct 
the Brexit negotiations in stages.According to Sky News, 
<http://news.sky.com/story/eu-adopting-three-tier-approach-to-brexit-sources-tell-sky-news-10670578>
 Michel Barnier, the commission’s Brexit negotiator, wants to negotiate a 
transitional deal with the EU before negotiating a final trade deal. Davis said 
he was opposed to this. In response to a question from Labour’s Pat McFadden 
about whether the government wanted to negotiate withdrawal from the EU and the 
final UK-EU trade deal at the same time, Davis replied: 
The answer is yes. We want to see them both done in parallel, inside the two 
years.

In Brussels jargon the approach Davis is advocating is now known as 
“parallelism”.

Later, in response to a question from Labour’s Emma Reynolds, Davis confirmed 
that seeking a transitional deal was still an option.

We are seeking to ensure a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union, 
and it would not be in the interests of either side, Britain or the European 
Union, to see disruption. To that end, we’re examining all possible options, 
focusing on the mutual interests of the UK and theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

But he also restated his opposition to conducting the negotiation in stages. 
On the subject of whether the negotiation is conducted “in parallel” or “in 
series”, Davis said:

We do not accept the “in series” approach. In terms, we’ve made that plain to 
the European Union and we need to deal with that before we come to the detailed 
question of whether there’s a transition or not.

On transition itself, I just make this important point ... Transition when 
it’s raised by various people means different things. For example, at least one 
of the Europeans talking about this has effectively meant a much, much longer 
negotiation period, whilst other people are concerned about matters such as 
financial stability. The different issues need to be dealt with in different 
ways.

This suggests that Davis might agree to a transitional period if, when it 
starts, it has already been decide what will happen when it ends, but not if 
the transitional period is just a means of extending the two-year Brexit 
negotiation.

 * He said he did not believe reports saying Boris Johnson has told EU 
ambassadors in private that he personally favours free movement of people. 
<http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-supports-freedom-of-movement-in-brexit-10678355>
 Davis said: 
What I’ve seen in the papers this morning strikes me as completely at odds 
with what I know about [Boris Johnson’s] approach to this matter. He believes 
very clearly, and he made this clear in the leave campaign because he was a 
much more major part of it than I was, that some immigration is useful. We all 
believe that. That is not the same as thinking that free movement of people as 
it now stands is a good idea.

 * Davis said the government expected to see “pretty free movement of highly 
talented labour”. Asked about immigration policy after Brexit he said: 
The function of my department, and this strategy, is to bring back control of 
migration to the British government, the British parliament. That will be 
exercised in the national interest. That means we would expect to see pretty 
free movement of highly talented labour and, in other aspects of the economy, 
it is no part of the national interest to cause labour shortages. So I think 
businesses should be aware, this is not a shutting the door, this is a taking 
back control.

 * He dismissed reports that the European commission could ask the UK to pay 
€60bn to leave the EU 
<https://www.ft.com/content/480b4ae0-aa9e-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122>, saying that 
was just an “opening bid”.When Labour’s Matthew Pennycook asked about this, 
Davis replied: 
We have seen from the European Union an opening bid - it’s nothing more than 
that - an opening bid for the maximum price on departure from the union. 
Frankly, I’m not going to engage in chipping way at that bid. We will start 
from scratch when we go in that door when the negotiations start in March.

 * David Jones, the Brexit minister, said that government had not yet decided 
what powers repatriated from Brussels would be devolved to Scotland. 
 * Jones said it was “extremely difficult” to see how Scotland could stay in 
the EU single market if the rest of the UK left, despite this being one of the 
Scottish government’s key Brexit objectives. Jones said: 
I have to say I find it extremely difficult to see how one part of the United 
Kingdom could remain part of the single market while the rest was not. I would 
refer you to what the first minister of Wales Carwyn Jones said only the other 
day, when he said he couldn’t see how there could be separate market 
arrangements between different nations in the UK that share the same land mass.

 * Jones claimed UK regions were a “European construct”. In response to a 
question from fellow Conservative James Duddridge who labelled regions a 
“pernicious invention”, Jones said: 
Indeed. The regions of course are a European construct and post-Brexit we will 
be able to choose which parts of our country benefit from Government support.

Labour’s Jenny Chapman said she did not agree. She told Jones:

I can assure him that not where I come from in the North East, they are very 
much not a European construct, they are something about which we are intensely 
proud.

The DUP’s Sammy Wilson asks if Davis is disappointed by Donald Tusk’s 
“petulant” response to the request for an early resolution of the issue about 
EU nationals in the UK.

Davis says that was disappointing. But he is not going to be rude about Tusk. 
He says over the next two years he intends to be polite to everyone.

Davis says he expects to see “pretty free access” to the UK for skilled 
labour. And the government does not want to create labour shortages, he says. 
He says the government’s focus is on taking back control of immigration.

Davis says the government is giving very high priority to achieving 
tariff-free access to the EU. That could be achieved by a number of methods, he

 * Tony Blair has announced that he is creating a new organisation to support 
politicians who are fighting “the new populism of left and right”. Explaining 
his plan on his website 
<http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/news/entry/tony-blair-announcement-on-new-organisation/>
he said: 
This new populism may differ in some respects between left and right – the 
left anti-business, the right anti-immigrant – but in others what is remarkable 
is the convergence between them, especially around isolationism and 
protectionism, in what is an essentially closed-minded approach to 
globalisation and its benefits and to international engagement.

So we want to add a fourth pillar to what we do. I emphasise this is not in 
place of our other work but in addition to it.

This is the creation of a platform designed to build a new policy agenda for 
the centre ground together with the networks which link people up, and allow a 
reasonable and evidence based discussion of the future which avoids the plague 
of social media-led exchanges of abuse.

This platform will have a policy unit which will draw on the best ideas and 
practical solutions, building partnerships with other organisations, in the 
public policy and private spheres, so that those in the frontline of politics 
have a bigger and better policy agenda to reflect upon; and a networking 
capability to join like-minded people up.

This is not a think tank. There are enough of those, many doing excellent work 
we would want to utilise. It is a platform for engagement to inform and support 
the practising politician.

 * Voters have been going to the polls in the Richmond Park byelection. 
That’s all from me for the moment.

Tonight I will be blogging from the Richmond Park byelection count. I’ll 
launch the blog at around 10pm and you’ll find it here.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor and Strictly star, was on the BBC’s 
Victoria Derbyshire show this morning and he told the programme he would “love” 
to return to politics. He also said that he was not planning a comeback, and 
that he thought it might not happen, but nevertheless his comments were quite 
striking.

It is a really, really difficult time for the country so it would be foolish 
for me to pretend that I don’t miss it. I miss it very much, but I think maybe 
I had my time.

Once you have been a cabinet minister, you always hanker after having that 
kind of responsibility and difficulty and public service again.

So if I spent the next 15 years never having a chance to do public service 
again, I would feel as though I’d missed out. I’d love to do that, but how and 
in what way and where, I don’t know and that’s OK.

I really wanted to be chancellor and I think I probably missed my chance last 
year and I’ve not been thinking about being re-elected again because it’s a 
long process.

But I’m not going to say to you that I can never imagine it because there is a 
little part of me that thinks that, having done it once and knowing how hard it 
is and how important and how people much people depend on you ... If I said to 
you that there wasn’t a bit of me that hankered, that would be untrue, but it 
is not the plan and I think it is probably the wrong thing, but I don’t know.

Balls has never categorically ruled out a return to politics in any of the 
interviews he has given since losing his seat in the 2015 general election, but 
he has always implied that it is a remote possibility. Today’s comments suggest

The pound rose in value this morning after David Davis’s comment about the 
government considering paying the EU after leaving for access to the single 
market, my colleagueGraeme Wearden reports.

There is a byelection in Richmond Park today. And next week there is another, 
in Sleaford and North Hykeham. My colleague John Harris has been there to make 
this video, which is well worth watching.
Sleaford’s Brexit byelection: a people united by fear for the future

The department for business has put out a press release today 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eu-nationals-remain-eligible-for-postgraduate-support-from-uks-research-councils>
 about government support for EU postgraduates who are studying in the UK that 
says “funding support will cover the duration of their course,even if the UK 
leaves the EU”.(My italics.) 

Does that mean Brexit might not actually mean Brexit? Er, no. The department 
says it would be wrong to read that as meaning it is planning for the 
possibility that the UK might not leave the EU. It just seems to be loose 
drafting.
 
Often cabinet ministers can waltz through an hour of taking questions in the 
Commons without saying anything of interest, butDavid Davis, the Brexit 
secretary, is more willing to engage with questions than some of his colleagues 
and today’s Brexit questions was quite revealing. Here are the key points.

 * Davis said the government may continue to pay the EU after it leaves for 
access to the single market.Labour’s Wayne David asked if the government would 
consider “making any contribution in any shape or form for access to the single 
market” after Brexit. Davis replied: 
The major criterion here is that we get the best possible access for goods and 
services to the European market. And if that is included in what he’s talking 
about, then of course we will consider it.

 * Davis said that he was opposed to the European commission’s plan to conduct 
the Brexit negotiations in stages.According to Sky News, 
<http://news.sky.com/story/eu-adopting-three-tier-approach-to-brexit-sources-tell-sky-news-10670578>
 Michel Barnier, the commission’s Brexit negotiator, wants to negotiate a 
transitional deal with the EU before negotiating a final trade deal. Davis said 
he was opposed to this. In response to a question from Labour’s Pat McFadden 
about whether the government wanted to negotiate withdrawal from the EU and the 
final UK-EU trade deal at the same time, Davis replied: 
The answer is yes. We want to see them both done in parallel, inside the two 
years.

In Brussels jargon the approach Davis is advocating is now known as 
“parallelism”.

Later, in response to a question from Labour’s Emma Reynolds, Davis confirmed 
that seeking a transitional deal was still an option.

We are seeking to ensure a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union, 
and it would not be in the interests of either side, Britain or the European 
Union, to see disruption. To that end, we’re examining all possible options, 
focusing on the mutual interests of the UK and theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

But he also restated his opposition to conducting the negotiation in stages. 
On the subject of whether the negotiation is conducted “in parallel” or “in 
series”, Davis said:

We do not accept the “in series” approach. In terms, we’ve made that plain to 
the European Union and we need to deal with that before we come to the detailed 
question of whether there’s a transition or not.

On transition itself, I just make this important point ... Transition when 
it’s raised by various people means different things. For example, at least one 
of the Europeans talking about this has effectively meant a much, much longer 
negotiation period, whilst other people are concerned about matters such as 
financial stability. The different issues need to be dealt with in different 
ways.

This suggests that Davis might agree to a transitional period if, when it 
starts, it has already been decide what will happen when it ends, but not if 
the transitional period is just a means of extending the two-year Brexit 
negotiation.

 * He said he did not believe reports saying Boris Johnson has told EU 
ambassadors in private that he personally favours free movement of people. 
<http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-supports-freedom-of-movement-in-brexit-10678355>
 Davis said: 
What I’ve seen in the papers this morning strikes me as completely at odds 
with what I know about [Boris Johnson’s] approach to this matter. He believes 
very clearly, and he made this clear in the leave campaign because he was a 
much more major part of it than I was, that some immigration is useful. We all 
believe that. That is not the same as thinking that free movement of people as 
it now stands is a good idea.

 * Davis said the government expected to see “pretty free movement of highly 
talented labour”. Asked about immigration policy after Brexit he said: 
The function of my department, and this strategy, is to bring back control of 
migration to the British government, the British parliament. That will be 
exercised in the national interest. That means we would expect to see pretty 
free movement of highly talented labour and, in other aspects of the economy, 
it is no part of the national interest to cause labour shortages. So I think 
businesses should be aware, this is not a shutting the door, this is a taking 
back control.

 * He dismissed reports that the European commission could ask the UK to pay 
€60bn to leave the EU 
<https://www.ft.com/content/480b4ae0-aa9e-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122>, saying that 
was just an “opening bid”.When Labour’s Matthew Pennycook asked about this, 
Davis replied: 
We have seen from the European Union an opening bid - it’s nothing more than 
that - an opening bid for the maximum price on departure from the union. 
Frankly, I’m not going to engage in chipping way at that bid. We will start 
from scratch when we go in that door when the negotiations start in March.

 * David Jones, the Brexit minister, said that government had not yet decided 
what powers repatriated from Brussels would be devolved to Scotland. 
 * Jones said it was “extremely difficult” to see how Scotland could stay in 
the EU single market if the rest of the UK left, despite this being one of the 
Scottish government’s key Brexit objectives. Jones said: 
I have to say I find it extremely difficult to see how one part of the United 
Kingdom could remain part of the single market while the rest was not. I would 
refer you to what the first minister of Wales Carwyn Jones said only the other 
day, when he said he couldn’t see how there could be separate market 
arrangements between different nations in the UK that share the same land mass.

 * Jones claimed UK regions were a “European construct”. In response to a 
question from fellow Conservative James Duddridge who labelled regions a 
“pernicious invention”, Jones said: 
Indeed. The regions of course are a European construct and post-Brexit we will 
be able to choose which parts of our country benefit from Government support.

Labour’s Jenny Chapman said she did not agree. She told Jones:

I can assure him that not where I come from in the North East, they are very 
much not a European construct, they are something about which we are intensely 
proud.

Here is the key quote where David Davis said the government would consider 
paying the EU after Brexit for access to the single market.

Labour’s Wayne David asked if the government would consider “making any 
contribution in any shape or form for access to the single market” after Brexit.

Davis replied:

The major criterion here is that we get the best possible access for goods and 
services to the European market. And if that is included in what he’s talking 
about, then of course we will consider it.

 
Brexit questions is over.

I’ll post a summary shortly.
 
The DUP’s Sammy Wilson asks if Davis is disappointed by Donald Tusk’s 
“petulant” response to the request for an early resolution of the issue about 
EU nationals in the UK.

Davis says that was disappointing. But he is not going to be rude about Tusk. 
He says over the next two years he intends to be polite to everyone.
 
Davis says he expects to see “pretty free access” to the UK for skilled 
labour. And the government does not want to create labour shortages, he says. 
He says the government’s focus is on taking back control of immigration.
 
Davis says the government is giving very high priority to achieving 
tariff-free access to the EU. That could be achieved by a number of methods, he 
says.
 
Davis says people should be wary of taking economic assumptions underlying a 
forecast as a statement of what will happen.
 
The SNP’s Roger Mullin asks Davis where in the OBR documents it shows the 
financial bonanza the UK will have after Brexit.

Davis says John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has spoken about the 
possible benefits coming to the UK. SadlyKeir Starmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer> does not agree, Davis says.
 
Labour’s Mary Creagh says Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, told the 
environment committee that between a quarter to a third of EU environmental 
legislation would not be transposed into UK law in the great repeal bill. What 
will happen to it?

Davis says that may require separate primary legislation.
