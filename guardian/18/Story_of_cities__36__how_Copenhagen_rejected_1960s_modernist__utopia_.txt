“In the 60s and 70s, we thought that if you built huge blocks with apartments 
and efficient traffic systems, everyone would be happy … But quality of life is 
more than square metres, concrete, lifts, motorways and subways.”

From his house on the outskirts of Copenhagen, veteran planner Søren Elle is 
reliving his 42 years with the city’s transport department. “The question was, 
should we rebuild Copenhagen into a modern American city, or should we keep 
Copenhagen as Copenhagen and just make small adjustments in a pragmatic, Danish 
way?”

Elle’s words echo the dilemma that faced planners in so many European cities 
during the 1960s and 70s – a time when the modernist movement dominated visions 
of what the future city would look like. Traditional residential blocks and 
narrow streets were deemed unhealthy and suppressive, and the utopian vision 
was of streets in the sky and grand boulevards for the motorcar.

European engineers were sent in flocks to the US to learn from the 
environments in which these revolutionary ideas were playing out, returning with
tabula rasa development plans to realise their own modernist dreams. Many 
cities still bear the battle scars of the planners’ ensuing “enlightened 
experiments”.

In Britain, vast swathes of the city of Birmingham were gutted to make way for 
an inner ring road, which placed cars on the surface and buried many footpaths 
and road crossings beneath the built-for-speed streets. In Stockholm, the 
Essingeleden motorway was opened in 1966 to traverse the city’s islands. It was 
soon repainted from six to eight lanes, but this failed to make a dent on 
congestion levels – it remains the busiest road in Sweden.

We were lucky that Copenhagen was poor after the second world war
Søren Elle 
While concrete was being poured to create other giant urban spaghetti 
junctions acrossEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, 
Copenhagen found itself at a crossroads: “[It] has reached a state of 
development where it is necessary to develop a network of motorways through the 
city to secure its arterial functions. [The motorways] will change the 
appearance of the city,” wrote architect Ole Nøregård in a 1965 engineers 
report.

Nøregård’s urgent recommendations referred to several transformative road 
plans for the city, including Søringen (The Lake Ring) – a 12-lane thoroughfare 
first proposed in 1958, that would slice across Copenhagen’s core and pave over 
its iconic lakes in the name of urban progression.

Alongside the road building blueprints was the City Vest (City West) plan to 
raze the Vesterbro neighbourhood – then deemed a ghetto – to make way for 
motorways and high-rise developments. Both proposals were part of the broader
1948 Finger Plan 
<https://danishbusinessauthority.dk/sites/default/files/fp-eng_31_13052015.pdf>
, drawn up as a long-term vision for the Greater Copenhagen area, which would 
see urban development concentrated alongside a new network of arterial roads 
and railways located along five “fingers”.

the 1960s. Photograph: Copenhagen City Archive 
But it didn’t happen. Much to the modernists’ discontent at the time, 
Copenhagen’s development took a different trajectory, and managed to escape the 
congested concrete clutches of modern urban planning. In the process, it laid 
the foundations for its contemporary reputation as one of the world’s most 
“liveable” cities – an urban model so desirable that copying its outcomes even 
has its own verb: “to Copenhagenise”.

“We were lucky that Copenhagen was poor after the second world war,” Elle 
says. Rather than intelligent foresight, or a difference in the mindset of 
those in power, he suggests the Danish capital’s avoidance of major 
carriageways is down to good fortune. “We thought we were unlucky and very 
poor. We were actually lucky, but still very poor.”


Copenhagen’s lack of funds led to the city’s modernist visions progressing at 
a painfully slow pace. It did get a small taste of a car-oriented future in the 
shape of the six-lane Bispeengbuen expressway, which rips through its northern 
neighbourhoods directly in front of second-storey windows.

“That was a real eye-opener. People could see that this would change 
Copenhagen – that this is what the plans mean,” Elle says. “Inside people’s 
heads, they found out that they were not happy with these [modernist 
developments]. By the 70s, they could experience how it was to live in it … you 
have to feel it in your body to know it’s not good.”

People were taking notice of these changes to the urban fabric throughout 
Europe. Protest movements such asHomes Before Roads 
<http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/browse/307/308/6418/3/31> emerged in 
London; it attempted to limit the removal of housing in the capital to make 
space for motorways. But perhaps the key element that set Copenhagen’s 
anti-motorway protests apart was the fact they also demonstrated that an 
alternative future was possible.

One group was pushing cars out of the city whilst others were trying to push 
them in
Jan Gehl 
“We had the notion that common space could pull people out of isolation,” says 
Jan Gehl, renowned urban planner and godfather of the liveable cities movement. 
“There were these big freeway people, and then there were the counter streams 
that happened between 1960 and 1970 ... One group was pushing cars out of the 
city, while others were trying to push them in.”

Sitting in the bright top-floor offices of Gehl Architects in Vesterbro, the 
79-year-old gestures to his surroundings: “This building wouldn’t be here. The 
motorway would’ve gone straight through it.”

As a young architect at the time of these plans, Gehl says many of his 
Copenhagen peers were working on “humane city planning” policies, after the 
pressure began to build at a citizen level: “A discussion was beginning about 
the virtues of having a city for people … There was an environmental group, 
which started to put floats out in the lakes to show how far the motorway would 
extend. A big hotel was going to be built, so they winched up weather balloons 
to show how high it was going to be.”

In 1968, Denmark’s primary newspaper Politiken switched its view from support 
to opposition of Søringen and the City Vest plans, mirroring the mood in 
Copenhagen at the time. In a city that was getting poorer and poorer, road 
projects could not happen without state support – and that was revoked in 1972.

The scrapping of plans once and for all coincided with the 1973 global oil 
crisis, which saw car use almost dry up in the city. It helped to shake the 
dust off the cycling culture and pedestrian movement, both of which have been 
on the rise ever since.

The dystopian outcomes of designing cities for cars can be seen in the likes 
of Stockholm and Birmingham

Five decades on, Copenhagen continues to retain its historic housing stock, 
strong bicycle culture and extensive pedestrianised zone – an urban model that 
many cities around the world are now desperately trying to claw back.

The 6km lake shores are teeming with human activity, its frozen waters 
providing temporary public space <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2w7C_Ened4> 
during the winter months. And it is impossible to imagine how the 36,000 
cyclists who currently use theNørrebrogade lake crossing 
<https://vimeo.com/141516172> – Europe’s most popular cycling street 
<http://denmark.dk/en/green-living/bicycle-culture/cycling-in-copenhagen---the-easy-way/>
 – would have got past a roaring 12-lane barricade, which would have left many 
now-thriving areas resembling the hinterland surroundingLondon’s Westway

.

Research on global transport released in 2015 found that building new roads 
<http://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf> (pdf) does little more than breed more cars, 
increase traffic and impactresidents’ health and wellbeing 
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/>. The 
dystopian outcomes of designing cities for cars can be seen in the likes of 
Stockholm and Birmingham.

“You might think you want to build a ring road to get the cars off the streets 
in the city,” Elle says, “but if you really want to get the cars off the 
streets, you can just close the roads. It’s a classic transport planning 
mistake to want more capacity.”

This sentiment is echoed by Gehl: “What we have been able to prove is that a 
strong culture of using public spaces and bicycle facilities has developed 
here; [the opposite of] other cities that have a strong culture around using 
cars … It just depends on what you invite in.”

Cities are racing to catch up with what this different way of thinking has 
brought to Copenhagen’s streets – but while they may seek to copy the city’s 
road layouts, bicycle lanes and gleaming public spaces, it isn’t that simple. 
“I was always more interested in changing the mindset – then someone else can 
change the actual city,” Gehl says. “In this firm, we don’t do design – we do 
programmes and strategies for cities.”

Next stop for Gehl is Moscow, where he is returning to check up on a number of 
public space projects <http://gehlarchitects.com/cases/moscow-russia/> that 
began in 2011 
<http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-danish-urban-planning-guru-vs-moscow>
. He talks of the “efficient democracy” that allows leaders to implement 
changes almost overnight in places such as Russia and America – removing 
on-street parking, widening pavements and creating public squares: “If the 
mayor says ‘car parking must go’, you come back two weeks later and it’s gone.”

To fully progress beyond the paradigm of car-centric planning, however, many 
of Copenhagen’s experts say there is still much work to be done – such as the 
decoupling of economic success from road building.

“When the plans failed, some at the time might have said, ‘We’re not able to 
grow the economy’ – but the lesson learned from that was that you don’t need 
new roads to do that,” says Mike Axon, who is leading theCreate 
<http://www.create-mobility.eu/> project, which is investigating the deeper 
barriers to changing our planning methodologies. “There are other ways around 
the problem … [our report] might find that road building is not a reasonable 
proxy … It’s not the panacea.”

Story of cities #37: how radical ideas turned Curitiba into Brazil's 'green 
capital'

Citizen-focused planning is still at the heart of Copenhagen’s future visions: 
“We are investing in sustainable solutions, and want to use the city as a 
laboratory for testing new technologies,” says its lord mayor Frank Jensen, who 
is currently increasing bike infrastructure andextending the metro by 17 
stations <http://www.thelocal.dk/20140625/metro-delay-now-certain>. “But the 
philosophy behind all the development in the city comes down to the question of 
liveability.”

In true Copenhagen fashion, the underbelly of Bispeenbuen flyover – the 
leftover trace of the city’s modernist fantasies – is now the site of a new
public space competition <http://work.wearepark.dk/Bispeengbuen> trying to 
bring life back to the concrete wasteland.

But the city is also bowing to the pressure of a desire for economic growth 
and prosperity. The old principle of reducing car parking in the centre year on 
year isbeing reversed 
<http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE2838201/boern-veje-og-idraet-loeber-med-pengene-i-koebenhavn/>
, and Copenhagen has also flirted with the idea of constructing a 27bn kroner 
(£2.8bn) tunnel beneath its harbour.

But Gehl’s optimism is undimmed – based not just on his home city, but from 
his work with more than 100 others around the world: “There has really been a 
change in paradigm; now cities really want to be liveable, healthy and 
sustainable. This is really global now.”
