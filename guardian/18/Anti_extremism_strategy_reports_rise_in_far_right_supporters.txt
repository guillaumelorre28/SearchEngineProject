A UK anti-extremism strategy has reported a rise in the number of people being 
referred to it with far-right links.

About one in 10 referrals to the scheme nationwide were linked to the 
far-right, according to the Prevent anti-extremism group.

Simon Cole, the National Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> 
Chiefs’ council lead for Prevent, said: “They are typically about people who 
want to do things that destabilise communities.”

The highest regional figure is about 20%, Cole added, saying: “For some parts 
of the country it is a significant part of their workload.”

Authorities highlighted concerns that the threat from the extreme right could 
be growing followingthe conviction of Thomas Mair for the murder of the Labour 
MP Jo Cox.

Mair, 53, who killed Cox as she arrived to hold a surgery in her West 
Yorkshire constituency, was handed a whole-life sentence in November.

This month National Action became the first extreme rightwing group to be 
banned as a terrorist organisation.

Cole described Prevent as absolutely fundamental to Britain’s counterterrorism 
effort.

He argued that the strategy is often presented in hysterical terms, while in 
reality the process is aimed at supporting vulnerable individuals. The latest 
figures show that in 2015-16 there were about 7,500 referrals to Prevent.
