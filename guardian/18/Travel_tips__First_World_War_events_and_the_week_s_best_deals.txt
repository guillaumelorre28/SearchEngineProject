Take me there: Ieper, Flanders


Why go?
Next week sees the start of a long-running series of commemorative events to 
mark the centenary of the First World War. The Flemish town of Ieper (known 
then as Ypres), was at the centre of much of the fighting, its medieval 
buildings reduced to rubble, only to be rebuilt, brick by brick, in an 
extraordinary act of determination by the local people. Today, it makes an 
attractive and peaceful base for exploring the monuments, battlefields and war 
cemeteries of Flanders.

What to do
There’s no better introduction to First World War history than the excellent 
In Flanders Fields museum, which tells the story of the Great War through the 
experiences of individuals (inflandersfields.be 
<http://www.inflandersfields.be/>). It can be found on the first floor of the 
Lakenhalle, a meticulous reconstruction of Ieper’s medieval cloth hall. A few 
streets away is the Menin Gate, a huge memorial arch inscribed with the names 
of 54,896 “lost” soldiers whose bodies were never found. At 8pm every day the 
road through the arch is closed and the “Last Post” is played. There are dozens 
of war cemeteries in the area, but if you’re only going to visit one make it 
Tyne Cot – the largest British military cemetery in the world. For details of 
commemorative events happening, seevisitflanders.co.uk 
<http://www.visitflanders.co.uk/>.

Where to stay
Don’t be put off by the uninspiring name: the Main Street Hotel is a real 
one-off: cosy, welcoming and just the right side of eccentric (doubles from 
£125,mainstreet-hotel.be <http://mainstreet-hotel.be/>).

Where to eat
De Ruyffelaer is the place to try hearty Flemish favourites, such as pork 
knuckle in a mustard sauce, and rabbit in beer, in an intimate wood-panelled 
dining room (deruyffelaer.be <http://www.deruyffelaer.be/>).

Insider tip
Tracey Morgan of Holts Tours (holts.co.uk <http://holts.co.uk/>), which offers 
escorted trips to the Flanders battlefields, recommends a visit to the trench 
system at Sanctuary Wood. “You can go into the muddy trenches and get a feel 
for what it would have been like, and see the bullet holes in the trees.”
