Capacity: 487

Who plays there: A mixture of mid-level acts, rootsy rockers and 
up-and-comers. Forthcoming shows include South African band the Parlotones and 
two nights from Lucy Rose. It’s also a popular venue for secret shows from big 
bands – the Strokes played their first show in four years here in 2010, under 
the name Venison.

Cloakroom: Yes.

Admission: Usually in the £10-£15 range.

Bar: The main bar, at the back of the club, is one of the hardest places to 
get served in London. It always seems to be understaffed, and the scrum to get 
served is unshrinking. Once you get to the front, the choice of drinks is as 
resolutely uninspired as you might fear. There are two bars attached – Lock 17 
and the Market Bar – so you can use your hand stamp to pop out for a drink 
between bands. For meeting beforehand, the pub Tapping the Admiral – five 
minutes’ walk away on Castle Road – is a delight. Just don’t disturb its 
Wednesday quiz night.


Food: No.

Toilets: At the side of the stage, but at the end of a long raised platform, 
so you don’t have to fight your way through the crowd, at least.

Wheelchair access: Yes – there’s wheelchair viewing at entry level, and though 
Dingwalls is on a cobbled yard, you can arrange to drive close to the entrance. 
There is a dedicated toilet.

Sound: You are subject to the whims of the sound engineer, but the low ceiling 
minimises echo and bounceback. It’s usually pretty good – though I’ve seen some 
punishingly loud shows here.

Where to stand: Dingwalls is one of the most oddly laid out venues on the 
circuit. The central viewing area is on four tiered levels, each joined by a 
couple of steps. Either side are ramped walkways leading down to the side of 
the stage. The very best spot is on the rail of the first tier up from the 
floor, where you have a perfect sightline and are still within spitting 
distance of the stage. If you can get to the stage end of the sides, that’s 
just as good. The very worst is the back tier, where you can see little and are 
subject to the noise of the bar. The problem with the tiers is that if you are 
not in the front row of any of them, it becomes impossible to see anything 
because the stage is below you.

Overall: Dingwalls is one of the legendary names of the London music scene, 
host to famed gigs by scores of great bands. Lemmy used to be a regular here. 
These days, though, it’s more comedy venue than gig venue, and it feels tired. 
It situation – on the edge of Camden’s Stables Market, right by the Regent’s 
Canal, makes it more a tourist attraction than a living venue. And yet … on the 
right night, the magic of the old place comes through, and, for all its 
drawbacks, it becomes the atmospheric sweatbox of the past. And the tiered 
system has one great advantage: by in effect confining the moshers to the floor 
section, it allows those everywhere else to watch the bands without either 
group annoying the other.
