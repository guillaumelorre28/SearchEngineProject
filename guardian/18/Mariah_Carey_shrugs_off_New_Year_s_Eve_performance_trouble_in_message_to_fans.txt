After experiencing difficulties with her New Year’s performance in Times 
Square in New York City that included stopping singing midway through a song,
Mariah Carey <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mariahcarey> used Twitter to 
say: “Shit happens.”

The singer

, performing on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest, on ABC, 
appeared to have technical difficulties during her live performance on Saturday 
night.

After a brief, flawless Auld Lang Syne, Carey’s mood seemed to range from 
frustration to resignation as she struggled with pre-recorded musical tracks.

Telling revelers jammed into Times Square there had not been a soundcheck for 
her hit song Emotions, she lamented: “We’re missing some of these vocals, but 
it is what it is.”

“Let the audience sing,” she decided, as she paced the stage.

“I’m trying to be a good sport here,” she said, adding her own sarcastic 
review of the performance. “That was … amazing.”

The next song, We Belong Together, went no better. At times, Carey lowered the 
microphone from her mouth and the music, vocals and all, kept playing, making 
it clear she was lip-synching.

“Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance 
given the circumstances,” spokeswoman Nicole Perna said on Sunday.

A representative for Dick Clark productions did not immediately respond to an 
email seeking comment.

Carey headlined the festivities in Times Square, where about a million 
revellers jammed in to greet the new year.

At 2am on 1 January, apparently working on the theory that bad publicity is 
better than no publicity at all, Carey used social media to say: “Shit happens. 
Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here’s to making more headlines in 
2017.”
