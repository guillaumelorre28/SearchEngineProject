Embattled Labor senator Sam Dastyari says he made a mistake by asking donors 
to pay for expenses he should have covered himself, but refused to give a 
straight answer about whether he departed from Labor’s position on theSouth 
China Sea <https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-china-sea> during the 
election campaign.


Dastyari faced the media for the first time since news broke last week 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/labor-senator-sam-dastyari-had-chinese-interests-foot-the-bill-for-travel-entitlement-repayment-20160830-gr4mlh.html>
 that Chinese business interests had paid a $1,600 travel bill for him – 
accepting full responsibility for the “mistake”.

But during a lengthy press conference he dodged questions about whether he had 
told a media conference during the recent election that the South China Sea 
dispute was a matter forChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> and 
Australia should stay neutral.

Dastyari said he may have been misquoted by the Chinese media, who reported 
the remarks, or he may have misspoken.

“I support the Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> position on the issue 
of the South China sea and if there is an instance in which I have misspoken or 
been misquoted, then that is wrong,” Dastyari said in response to direct 
questions about what he’d said during the campaign media event.

He also stepped around one question about why he’d approached Top Education, a 
company linked to the Chinese government, to pick up the travel overspend – why 
he knew they would be amenable to helping out.

Dastyari said he knew the firm “from the Chinese Sydney community” but then 
deflected by saying: “It would have been inappropriate, regardless of who I had 
asked ... the issue was not the company, the inappropriate action was I should 
have made that payment myself.”

He rejected out of hand suggestions that he’d been influenced by donations 
from Chinese business interests.

“No one has ever asked for anything in return or nor would have I done 
anything in return,” he said. “I asked a private company to fix – to settle – a 
$1,670 office overspend that I should have paid for myself.

“I accept that and I take responsibility for that. I completely reject, 
though, I completely reject an assertion or implication that in any way, shape 
or form, any of my comments or decisions have been influenced by anything other 
than the national interest.”

Dastyari’s apologia followed a signal earlier in the day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/06/cory-bernardi-joins-calls-ban-foreign-corporate-union-donations>
 from the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, that he would continue to back the New 
South Wales senator.

Shorten told reporters Dastyari – who he incorrectly characterised as a very 
junior figure despite his status as influential factional player, frontbencher 
and manager of opposition business in the Senate – deserved a second chance.

As the political row escalated into Tuesday evening, the deputy prime 
minister, Barnaby Joyce, was asked on the ABC’s 7.30 how a donation from the 
mining magnate Gina Rinehart to his campaign differed from the funds supplied 
to Dastyari.

Joyce told the program donations made via a political party were different. 
“It is auditable. There is an arm’s length between the individual and that 
person, via the political party,” he said.

He said donations from Rinehart “balanced up” contributions made to the Greens 
by the internet entrepreneur Graeme Wood, and by trade unions to the ALP.

Joyce said he didn’t have to give Rinehart anything in return for her support. 
“To be honest, Ms Rinehart, I haven’t had to give anything. They are strongly 
of the conservative side of politics. There’s no doubt about it.

“They support the conservative side of politics. They’re Australian. It goes 
via a political party. It’s auditable,” he said.

Labor has used the current imbroglio to reignite calls for substantial reform 
to Australia’s donations and disclosure regime 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/05/bill-shorten-tells-malcolm-turnbull-to-use-g20-trip-to-address-foreign-donations>
, and Shorten wrote to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, offering support 
for a range of reforms, including real-time disclosure of donations, disclosure 
at lower thresholds a ban on foreign donations.

Shorten noted on Tuesday there was now a “coalition of the willing” in the new 
parliament to ban foreign donations.

The Greens have restated their commitment to boosting disclosure. On Monday 
the Greens leader,Richard Di Natale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/richard-di-natale>, said he 
supported an end to donations from foreign entities and corporations.

Di Natale says the Greens would also support strict caps from not-for-profit 
organisations and individuals on the Australian electoral roll.

Malcolm Turnbull signalled he was willing to countenance reform en route to 
the East Asia Summit, a gathering of leaders expected to ventilate tensions 
over Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.

The prime minister has previously backed the principle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/03/turnbull-restates-belief-in-donations-cap-but-does-not-commit-to-act>
 of limiting donations to enrolled individuals, which would ban donations from 
corporations – Australian or foreign – as well as unions.

A number of Coalition MPs have also endorsed an overhaul of the system 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/05/sam-dastyari-donation-row-coalition-steps-up-attack-on-bill-shorten>
 in the prime minister’s absence.

Speaking on 7.30 Joyce backed a discussion about limiting foreign donations. 
“I think it’s well worth the discussion. I’m happy to have the discussion.”

But senior players have played down the need for a wide-ranging overhaul of 
the donations and disclosure system.

The attorney general, George Brandis, on Tuesday said the Dastyari imbroglio 
and the matter of donations reform were separate issues.


Brandis told ABC’s AM on Tuesday that a ban on foreign donations was “a 
different conversation” to the controversy around Dastyari, because it related 
to a gift, not a donation. He said political donations were subject to 
“extensive regulation and an extensive integrity regime” and gifts were not.

“I’m not going to change the subject. This is about one particular individual 
– Sam Dastyari – who has accepted money from an entity ... that is effectively 
controlled by the Chinese state.”

The treasurer, Scott Morrison, told Sky News the issue was not about donation 
reform “it was about Shanghai Sam, and he’s got to go”.

He said Dastyari’s conduct was “beyond explanation, beyond defence, and he 
should go”.

Di Natale said on Tuesday it was “easy” to pile in on Dastyari, but it 
wouldn’t change a system which was obviously in need of a significant overhaul. 
He said he would be courting Senate crossbenchers when parliament resumes next 
week to keep the pressure on for reform.
