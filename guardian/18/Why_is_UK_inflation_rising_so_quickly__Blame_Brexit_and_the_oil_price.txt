Gyrations in the oil market meant it was a stone-cold certainty that inflation 
would be on the rise in late 2016

. This time last year the price of crude was crashing, which put strong 
downward pressure on the cost of living. The annual inflation rate is the sum 
of price movements in the latest 12 months, so last year’s price falls are 
gradually dropping out. As they do, inflation automatically goes up.

This trend is, however, is being amplified by two other factors. The first is 
that oil prices are not just holding steady: as a result of thedeal between 
oil-producing countries

to curb production they are going up. A year ago, it was possible to find 
unleaded petrol at around £1 a litre; this Christmas it will be £1.20 a litre.

The second factor is the 15% depreciation of the pound since the EU referendum 
in June. Although sterling has been edging higher for the past month, the 
lagged effect of its drop during the summer and early autumn is making imports 
dearer. A pick-up inproducer price inflation

– the cost of goods leaving factory gates – is early evidence of this effect.

At 1.2%, inflation remains below the government’s 2% target but it will not 
remain there for long. Prices fell by 0.8% in January 2016 and unless that fall 
is replicated next month (which it won’t be), inflation will rise. It is likely 
to hit 2% by the spring and 3% by the end of the year, unless the price-fixing 
deal for oil falls apart and the cost of crude comes crashing down again.

Historically, an inflation rate of 2% to 3% is relatively modest for the UK. 
It will still be enough, however, to put a pronounced squeeze on living 
standards next year, because prices are going to rise faster than wages.
