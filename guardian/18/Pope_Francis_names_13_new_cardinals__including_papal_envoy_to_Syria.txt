Cardinals, known as the “princes of the church”, who are under 80 are eligible 
to vote in the papal conclave that picks the next pope or become pope 
themselves.


Heading up the list of new cardinals is Italian archbishop Mario Zenari, who 
Francis said would remain in his post to show the church’s concern for “beloved 
and martyred Syria”.

Second on the list was Dieudonne Nzapalainga, the archbishop of Bangui, the 
capital ofCentral African Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/central-african-republic>, who is the 
youngest of the 13 new cardinals aged just 49.

And in a rare move, 87-year-old Albanian Ernest Simoni has been elevated to 
the position of cardinal from parish priest.


He was imprisoned by Albania’s communist regime in 1963 and sentenced to 
death, although that was later commuted to 25 years forced labour, according to 
aVatican <https://www.theguardian.com/world/vatican> profile. He spent a total 
of 18 years imprisoned.

Three of the 13 who will have conclave voting rights are from Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, three from Latin America, 
three from the US and two each from Africa and Asia.

Among the other senior church leaders from developing countries being promoted 
to cardinal are Sérgio da Rocha, archbishop of Brasilia, Patrick D’Rozario, 
archbishop of Dhaka, Baltazar Porras Cardozo, archbishop of Mérida in Venezuela 
and Maurice Piat, the bishop of Port-Louis inMauritius 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mauritius>.

Three are American moderates, including Chicago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago> archbishop Blase Cupich and 
Indianapolis archbishop Joseph Tobin in a clear signal to the conservative US 
Catholic hierarchy that Francis values pastors focused more on mercy than 
morals.

Tobin’s nomination also carries a political message ahead of the US election, 
given thathe openly opposed a request from Indiana governor Mike Pence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-nominees-tim-kaine-mike-pence-catholic>
, now Donald Trump’s running mate, to not settle Syrian refugees in the state.
