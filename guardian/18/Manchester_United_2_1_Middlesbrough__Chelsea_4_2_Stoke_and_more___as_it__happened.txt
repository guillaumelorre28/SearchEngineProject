“United being beaten by Boro after biggest spending ever and no better than 
LVG,” says Stephen Lysaght. “Meanwhile Chelsea don’t spend and are 27 points 
better off. So what is Jose?”

GOAL! Manchester United 2-1 Middlesbrough (Pogba 86)

United have turned it round with two goals in two minutes. The increasingly

Alex Ferguson, in the crowd on his 75th birthday, will be experiencing many a 
happy flashback.

GOAL! Manchester United 0-1 Middlesbrough (Leadbitter 67)

Oh my. Middlesbrough lead at Old Trafford, with Grant Leadbitter finishing 
well from a superb knockdown by Alvaro Negredo. The last time Boro won at Old 
Traffordwas in 2004 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/feb/12/match.sport8>, when Juninho 
scored twice and Diego Forlan hit the crossbar from 0.0001 yards.

GOAL! Chelsea 2-1 Stoke (Willian 53)

Ach, I can’t keep up with all these goals. Willian has finished off a 
brilliant move to put Chelsea back in front. Teams managed by Antonio Conte 
aren’t exactly renowned for losing a lead twice in one game, so you’d fancy 
Chelsea to win from here.

“Dearest Rob,” lies Mac Millings. “Greetings and seasonal felicitations from 
(thanks to North Carolina’s passing of the “bathroom law”) the superior of the 
two Carolinas - although not, I suspect, for long; South Carolinians are proud 
to be among the worst people in the nation (State Motto: “Nil Satis Nisi 
Oppressio”). I don’t really care about the football any more - just wanted to 
take the opportunity to make fun of my adopted homeland while that’s still 
allowed.”

Happy new year!

“Thanks for the clip of the Arsenal defence being shredded by QPR,” says 
Charles Antaki. “Particularly prophetic are the two appearances of Steve Bould 
in the post-goal scenes, practicing the wearied, disbelieving expression that 
would come to be so useful in later years.”

Hal Robson-Kanu scored one of the goals of 2016, and he has ended the year 
with ascreamer to give West Brom the lead at St Mary’s. Indeed that’s his first 
goal since he paid tribute to Johan Cruyff against Belgium in the summer.

last year, but didn’t Jose do the same - if not more so - by publicly

Schadenfreude, like onanism, is an activity in which you should only partake 
if you are absolutely certain it’s not going to come back in your face.

 
Here’s how the Premier League table looks after today’s matches

Sunderland are well and truly in the malodorous stuff.
 
It’s probably fair to say that United would have lost that game a year ago. 
They aren’t quite back, but they are going in the right direction.
 
Chelsea make it 13 consecutive league wins despite a fine performance from 
Stoke. They are nine points clear of Liverpool, who play Manchester City later 
today.

“United being beaten by Boro after biggest spending ever and no better than 
LVG,” says Stephen Lysaght. “Meanwhile Chelsea don’t spend and are 27 points 
better off. So what is Jose?”

He’s a mirage, a spook story, a concept.
 
United have turned it round with two goals in two minutes. The increasingly 
influential Paul Pogba has headed them ahead from Juan Mata’s cross, and Sir 
Alex Ferguson, in the crowd on his 75th birthday, will be experiencing many a 
happy flashback.

conclusion of 15 minutes of ceaseless pressure.

Chelsea have been severely tested today, and they have come through it so 
impressively. Diego Costa has sealed victory with a thumping finish.

Manchester United’s love affair with the referee Lee Mason continues: after 
disallowing Ibrahimovic’s goal in the first half, he has now turned down a big 
appeal for a penalty.
 
Manchester United are swarming all over Middlesbrough, with the substitute 
Marcus Rashford having their 25th attempt at goal.

Sunderland are taking one hell of a beating at Turf Moor. Ashley Barnes has 
got the fourth for Burnley, who have now picked up 22 points at home this 
season.

Oh my. Middlesbrough lead at Old Trafford, with Grant Leadbitter finishing 
well from a superb knockdown by Alvaro Negredo. The last time Boro won at Old 
Traffordwas in 2004 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/feb/12/match.sport8>, when Juninho 
scored twice and Diego Forlan hit the crossbar from 0.0001 yards.

Stoke were level for 74 seconds. Willian has scored  the greatest goal of all 
time his second to restore Chelsea’s lead once again.

season to bring Stoke level again.

“If you as the writer on Clockwatch cannot legally view the action,” says 
Steve Colwill, “how do you know if was a fine finish from Gray?”

Bob Kingsley told me 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/dec/30/joy-of-six-new-year-fixtures>
.
 
Ach, I can’t keep up with all these goals. Willian has finished off a 
brilliant move to put Chelsea back in front. Teams managed by Antonio Conte 
aren’t exactly renowned for losing a lead twice in one game, so you’d fancy 
Chelsea to win from here.

A hat-trick for Andre Gray! This is another excellent finish, and surely 
ensures victory for Burnley.

“Dearest Rob,” lies Mac Millings. “Greetings and seasonal felicitations from 
(thanks to North Carolina’s passing of the “bathroom law”) the superior of the 
two Carolinas - although not, I suspect, for long; South Carolinians are proud 
to be among the worst people in the nation (State Motto: “Nil Satis Nisi 
Oppressio”). I don’t really care about the football any more - just wanted to 
take the opportunity to make fun of my adopted homeland while that’s still 
allowed.”

Happy new year!
 
Andre Gray gets his second to give Burnley a comfortable lead at home to 
Sunderland. As things stand, Burnley are nine points clear of the relegation 
places.

“Thanks for the clip of the Arsenal defence being shredded by QPR,” says 
Charles Antaki. “Particularly prophetic are the two appearances of Steve Bould 
in the post-goal scenes, practicing the wearied, disbelieving expression that 
would come to be so useful in later years.”
 
Hal Robson-Kanu scored one of the goals of 2016, and he has ended the year 
with ascreamer to give West Brom the lead at St Mary’s. Indeed that’s his first 
goal since he paid tribute to Johan Cruyff against Belgium in the summer.

“Hi Rob,” says Wilfy, “To spread some Christmas/New Year’s cheer among all QPR 
fans looking forward to another year at the wrong end of the table and 
wondering where it all went wrong, please can you show all the goals from John 
Jensen’s finest hour.”

Better still: tomorrow is the 25th anniversary of Dennis Bailey Day.
 
Peep peep! It’s half time around England, if not Scotland. Chelsea are on 
course for their 13th consecutive win; Swansea are on course for theChampionship

“Lee Mason’s call to disallow Zlatan’s goal is, for me, the worst refereeing 
decision in 2016,” says Putera Satria. “According to his standards, then all 
overhead kicks should be disallowed for high feet.”

This is what really sets Clockwatch apart: many of the readers can legally 
view the action being described, but the writer can’t.
 
Bournemouth pass Swansea to death and go 2-0 up. Eventually Stanislas goes
