Isa Nacewa’s fifth try of the campaign spurred Leinster into a 10-0 lead by 
the quarter-hour mark, with the 20-year-old Garry Ringrose impressing in the 
centre.

Munster <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/munster>, despite losing James 
Cronin and Keith Earls to injury, closed the gap to three points by half-time, 
a converted effort from Robin Copeland getting the home fans on their feet.

Turning around with the wind behind them, Anthony Foley’s charges could not 
outmuscle a resolute Leinster defence, and tries from Jack McGrath and Kirchner 
saw the Blues triumph to move up one place to third in the GuinnessPro12

A hip injury prevented the Munster scrum-half Conor Murray from playing, with 
illness sidelining BJ Botha. Tomas O’Leary and John Ryan came in as late 
changes as did Rory Scannell, who partnered Francis Saili in midfield.

Leinster stunned the hosts with an early try, Dominic Ryan’s turnover at the 
breakdown launching a pacy counter from deep. The fit-again Sean O’Brien sent 
Ringrose raiding down the right wing and the youngster left two forwards for 
dead before passing for Nacewa to finish off by the posts. Ian Madigan 
converted and soon landed his first penalty attempt following an advancing 
Leinster maul controlled by the impressive O’Brien. In between, Scannell sent a 
kickable three-pointer wide.

Individual errors spoilt Munster’s attempts to get into scoring range, 
although direct running from the replacement prop Dave Kilcoyne and the 
captain, CJ Stander, enabled them to make some headway. A frantic spell of 
Munster attacking, with Earls, Saili and Stander to the fore, ended with Mike 
Sherry being held up. In a further setback, Earls was taken off on a stretcher 
shortly afterwards, wearing a neck brace.

However, Foley side’s got the boost they required just before the interval 
when the flanker Copeland scrambled over from a ruck in front of the posts.

Munster held that momentum into the second period, turning down two 
place-kicks before O’Brien came to the visitors’ rescue with a vital ruck 
penalty. Andrew Conway, Stander and Simon Zebo exposed chinks in the Leinster 
defence, but the blue shirts scrambled to good effect. That defensive solidity 
sprung them forward soon after, Nacewa pressing from a Madigan cross-field kick 
before McGrath burrowed over.

Foley reacted by bringing on Denis Hurley, Duncan Williams and Tommy 
O’Donnell, who was returning from the dislocated hip he suffered prior to the 
Rugby World Cup. But Munster misfired as Saili was held up in a choke tackle 
and a series of handling errors, allied to lineout issues, prevented them from 
responding on the scoreboard.

The tireless Jamie Heaslip forced an important turnover in the dying minutes 
for Leinster, and the icing on the cake came when Kirchner gobbled up a Saili 
pass and sprinted clear from his 10-metre line.
