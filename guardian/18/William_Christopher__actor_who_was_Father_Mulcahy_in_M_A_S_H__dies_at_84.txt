Christopher is best known for the role of Father Francis Mulcahy on M*A*S*H, 
the long-running 1970s TV show set during the Korean War.

“Everyone adored him,” said fellow M*A*S*H actor Loretta Swit. “A great sense 
of humor and a great humanitarian.

“He became TV’s quintessential padre as Father Mulcahy on M*A*S*H. It was the 
most perfect casting ever known.”
