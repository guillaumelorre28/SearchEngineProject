The Boko Haram <https://www.theguardian.com/world/boko-haram> leader, Abubakar 
Shekau, has rejected statements by the Nigerian military that he was seriously 
wounded in an airstrike.

In a video posted on social media on Sunday, a man purporting to be Shekau 
addresses the “tyrants ofNigeria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria> in 
particular and the west of Africa in general,” saying: “You broadcast the news 
and published it in your media outlets that you injured me and killed me, and 
here I am.” The speaker says: “I will not be killed until my time comes.”

Last month, Nigeria’s air force said it had killed senior members

The Nigerian military has claimed to have varyingly killed or seriously 
wounded Shekau multiple times in recent years, statements that are often 
followed by someone saying they are him and denying this on video. Due to the 
grainy footage, it is not always possible to confirm whether the person 
appearing in the videos is the same.

The most recent video, which is 40 minutes long, is recorded in Arabic and 
Hausa – a language widely spoken in northern Nigeria – and was uploaded to 
YouTube

Last month, Islamic State, to which Boko Haram pledged allegiance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/07/boko-haram-suicide-bombers-50-dead-maiduguri>
 in March 2015, announced the appointment of a new leader 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/05/isis-tries-to-impose-new-leader-on-boko-haram-in-nigeria>
 of the militant group, in an apparent rejection of Shekau.

This was later dismissed in a 10-minute audio clip featuring a man purporting 
to be the Boko Haram leader, exposing divisions among the jihadis,who have 
plagued Nigeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/join-us-or-die-birth-of-boko-haram>
 and its neighbouring countries of Chad, Niger and Cameroon.
