The Met Office issued its second consecutive severe weather warning for fog, 
after the misty visibility-reducing conditions blighted the south of the 
country overnight on Saturday.

Greg Dewhurst, a Met Office meteorologist, said the new severe weather warning 
covers southern parts of England and Wales and is valid until 10am on Monday.

“For the morning there could be some tricky driving conditions. The fog will 
be in and out – you could be fine driving along and the next minute come across 
this thick fog,” he said. “It is worth drivers being aware first thing in the 
morning,” adding that “some dense patches are definitely possible”.

Over the weekend Gatwick and Heathrow airports warned their passengers they 
could face delays and cancellations because of the “foggy conditions”.

As the next batch of fog rolled across the south-west, southern Wales, the 
Midlands and parts of the south-east, Dewhurst said visibility in Bournemouth 
was around 200 metres and 400 metres in Exeter.

The Met Office warning advised people to “be aware of potential delays and 
hazardous driving conditions”.

Dewhurst said that in terms of temperatures on Monday morning “it could be on 
the cold side” and a “little bit frosty in one or two places … But that is more 
likely in countryside, towns and cities will be holding up around four or five 
degrees – which is about average,” he added. “It will be quite a dull start to 
the day elsewhere as well – with generally cloudy conditions and some light 
patchy rain.”
