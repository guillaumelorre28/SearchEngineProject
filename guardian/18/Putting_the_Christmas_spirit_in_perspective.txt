Three Christmas cheers for the Guardian and Observer’s appeal in aid of 
refugee children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/guardian-and-observer-charity-appeal-2016>
, for combining both the need for charity and change – and showing society that 
the two are not mutually exclusive.

The seasonal concern for others – from restaurants opening for the homeless to 
toy and gift donations – is always uplifting. But before Boxing Day morning has 
even begun, consumers will be splurging cash at the sales and government policy 
continuing to create the kind of desperate need that a few pounds in the 
charity tin atChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> 
can never solve.

As a GP in Oldham, I will be spending the post-Christmas Day period tending 
the vulnerable who are made up of more than just the elderly and frail who have 
been failed by our fragile social care system. They will no doubt also include 
those experiencing stress-related illnesses, including desperate anxiousness 
caused by ongoing joblessness and the spectre of debt. While some individuals 
will have consumed about six times their recommended daily calorie intake on 
Christmas Day, my patients may also include malnourished children.

Homelessness <https://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness> has become 
this year’s cause célèbre – and given that three-quarters of them have physical 
health problems and 80% have mental health issues, they will no doubt be 
seeking medical attention too. Because of the government’s cuts to homeless 
shelters, many will be back on the streets in the cold.

Random acts of kindness must be replaced by a concerted sense of compassion 
365 days a year. And charitable drives need to be accompanied by 
awareness-raising exercises that do not shy away from challenging government to 
examine disastrous policies such as the bedroom tax, which are beginning to 
bite and could leave thousands more people homeless.

One of the most famous charitable campaigns in Britain’s history is “A Dog is 
for Life and not just for Christmas” which warned that animals bought as pets 
are often discarded and maltreated following the festivities. If we want to 
make sure our most vulnerable people are not forgotten, we must bring some 
longevity to our charity and ensure it is accompanied by the kind of political 
action that can lead to sustainable change.

• Re the John Mullan article on representation of Christmas in literature (
Review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/17/christmas-chaos-in-literature-from-emma-to-adrian-mole>
, 17 December), my favourite is the Christmas dinner scene in A Portrait of the 
Artist as a Young Man. Among many reasons is that until I first read it, I 
thought that only in my family was politics so near the surface that it would 
turn the most sacred occasion into mayhem at the slightest opportunity. And it 
had nothing to do with drink in our case, a tiny glass of port being all that 
was likely to be on offer. It was pure passion, and this Joyce conveys as no 
one else could. The Christmas dinner in The Dead has a similar quality of 
emotion, where tears and laughter have the same intensity.

• I read in last Saturday’s Guide (17 December) the review of what was 
described as “The festive 40 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/17/christmas-tv-2016-50-shows-to-watch>
” programmes for the Christmas and New Year season. It was a strange article. 
None of the list of 40 had any connection to Christmas at all and those 
programmes that did got no mention whatsoever – programmes such as Midnight 
Mass on Christmas Eve (BBC1), Christmas carols with Aled Jones (ITV1), Carols 
from King’s (BBC2), Christmas Day service (BBC1), On Christmas Night (BBC1) and 
Gospel Christmas (BBC2). It might pay the Guardian to offer some training on 
what Christmas is all about to the anonymous reviewer?

• Stuart Heritage asserts: “Elf on the Shelf isn’t a real Christmas tradition 
… It began 12 years ago as a self-published picture book in the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/18/elf-on-the-shelf-isnt-real-christmas-tradition-post-truth-doll-intimidation>
” (G2, 19 December). Well we had an “elf on the shelf” (or mantelpiece) back in 
the 1960s – he’s still brought out at Christmas but he’s now sadly missing his 
little Noel book.

When we took our young son to my mother’s at Christmas in about 1990, he was 
told the story about the Christmas elf on the mantelpiece – then later on, when 
he thought no one was watching, he went up to the fireplace and said to the 
elf: “I’m not afraid of YOU!”

So it probably is a tradition from somewhere – my grandmother was German – but 
has been co-opted commercially!

• A two-page article (Rapid polar warming ‘behind a dramatic rise in extreme 
weather’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/19/arctic-ice-melt-already-affecting-weather-patterns-where-you-live-right-now>

houses across the UK (Eyewitness
