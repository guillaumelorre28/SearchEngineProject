Hollywood films such as City of Joy, Wolf, and Charlie Wilson‚Äôs War.

Fanatic and East is East.

have no regrets at all. I have done quite well for myself. I didn‚Äôt have a 
conventional face, but I have done well, and I am proud of it.‚Äù


He received an honorary OBE in 2004 for his contribution to British cinema and 
in 1990 was awarded the Padma Shri, one of India‚Äôs highest civilian honours.

Actors, athletes and fans, including the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi,
