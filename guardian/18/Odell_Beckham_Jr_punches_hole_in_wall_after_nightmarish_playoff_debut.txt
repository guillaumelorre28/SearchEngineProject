New York Giants <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-york-giants> wide 
receiver Odell Beckham Jr followed a nightmarish play-off debut with a meltdown 
in the bowels of Lambeau Field on Sunday evening.

The third-year Pro Bowler reportedly punched a hole in a wall and banged his 
head against his locker after catching just four balls for 28 yards in a
lopsided defeat to the Green Bay Packers

ESPN reported the Giants’ star wideout head-butted his locker after speaking 
with reporters after the 38-13 loss, while several members of the stadium’s 
grounds crew told Newsday that Beckham was responsible for the hole in the wall 
outside the visitors’ locker room.

Beckham had been targeted 11 times and dropped four passes, including one for 
a sure touchdown in the first quarter that forced the Giants to settle for a 
field goal.

The dreadful outcome was the climax of a week that saw New York’s wide 
receiving corps face criticism for spending a day off last week on a yacht in 
Miami with the R&B artist Trey Songz.

“There was nothing that could connect seven days ago to today and how we came 
out and played and executed,” Beckham told reporters. “There’s just nothing in 
the world, that’s not realistic. I think it did a great job at creating 
distractions for us. It’s unfortunate. That’s just the way this world is.

“There’s just no way you could connect something that happened seven days ago 
to this game today.”

On Monday the Giants general manager said that Beckham was confident that 
Beckham would adjust his behavior. “We all have had to grow up in different 
times in our lives,” Reese said. “I think it’s time for him to do that. He’s 
been here for three years now. He’s a little bit of a lightning rod because of 
what he does on the football but the things he does off the football field he 
has to be responsible for those things. We’ll talk through it and I believe – I 
know – he’s a smart guy. I believe he understands he has a responsibility being 
one of the faces of this franchise. I think he’ll accept that responsibility.”


The Giants’ veteran quarterback, Eli Manning, does not believe the yacht trip 
had an effect on Beckham but believes the widely circulated pictures of the 
team’s receivers relaxing before a playoff game had not helped the build-up.

“You’ve got to learn that the perception of things makes it different,” 
Manning said on Monday. “You do things, you’ve got to back it up. I don’t think 
it had an impact on the game. I thought we had a great week of practice. Guys 
were making plays and running around and intense and focused. Unfortunately we 
just didn’t have it yesterday.”

Beckham was selected to his third Pro Bowl in as many years last month, 
finishing the regular season with 101 catches for 1,367 yards and 10 touchdowns 
after overcoming aslow start to the 2016 campaign
