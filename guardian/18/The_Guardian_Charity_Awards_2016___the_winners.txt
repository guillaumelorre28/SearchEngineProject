It’s been a tough year for charities. Not only has trust in the sector 
declined following media coverage ofpoor fundraising practices 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/25/charities-with-dubious-fundraising-methods-are-on-last-chance-mps-warn>
, butdemand for services 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/benefit-sanctions-food-banks-oxford-university-study>
 has never been greater, as government policies force more people to turn to 
projects run by voluntary organisations. And at the same time, funding for 
charities is increasingly threatened by cuts to council budgets.

So, the helping hand offered by the Guardian Charity Awards 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/26/the-guardian-charity-awards-2016-shortlist>
 to this year’s five winning charities couldn’t come soon enough. The awards, 
currently supported by Bates Wells Braithwaite, the FSI, Jigsaw24, Media Trust 
and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, have been celebrating 
since 1993 the inspiring, innovative and life-affirming work performed by small 
social welfare charities across the UK.

By shining the spotlight on five extraordinary charities annually, the judges 
– drawn from across the third sector 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/06/the-guardian-charity-awards-judges>
– aim to give each of the winners a vital boost with a small cash prize, an 
iPad mini, and a range oftailor-made support 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/06/see-this-years-charity-awards-prizes>
.

Speaking at the awards ceremony in London on 13 December, the actor and 
activist Sir Ian McKellen said he was “humbled” by the winning charities’ work. 
“At a time when the protective arms of the state have become weaker, those of 
charities are even more important,” he said.

Marsh Community Centre: Guardian Charity Awards winner 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/dec/13/marsh-community-centre-guardian-charity-awards-winner-2016-video>
Marsh Community Centre has an unusually diverse user group, catering both to 
residents of an estate in one of the most deprived wards in Lancaster and 
Morecambe and to asylum seekers looking for refuge in the area.

The centre’s Open Access sessions help an average of 25 local residents a day 
with welfare support and advice. Meanwhile, the Lancaster and Morecambe City of 
Sanctuary Project, which started a year ago, provides welcome packs for asylum 
seekers and tailored support in areas including health, getting a lawyer and 
learning English. The judges were impressed with its innovative approach to 
boosting integration and building communities in an area that was previously 
almost exclusively white British. While there has been undeniable tension 
around the new arrangements, says centre manager Rebecca Joy Novell, attitudes 
are slowly changing.

“When you have breakthroughs, like when lads from different backgrounds sit 
and play [the computer game] Fifa together, it’s really magical,” she says.

During the summer, the centre, which has been running since 2003, was the 
venue for the Syrian People’s Cafe, in which new arrivals cooked for 500 
members of the local community. With more asylum-seeking children arriving all 
the time, the charity will use its cash prize to develop a programme helping 
them to integrate with local young people, as well as purchasing school 
uniforms for them.

“Winning is really overwhelming,” says Novell. “It’s just nice for a little 
community charity to be acknowledged, because it highlights what we do: we 
invest a lot of time in people.”

The judges applauded Music Action International’s ability to bring people 
together through music and break down negative stereotypes, while transforming 
lives blighted by torture.

The charity offers refugees and asylum seekers therapeutic, creative music 
sessions that help reduce the psychologicaleffects of trauma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/lesbos-greece-refugee-boats-capsize-volunteer-describes-huge-trauma>
 and isolation. Participants include survivors of torture, children and 
unaccompanied young people who have recently arrived from conflict areas. They 
create their own music and give free public performances at schools, community 
centres and arts venues.

By sharing the truth about refugee experiences in an uplifting and moving way, 
they aim to build stronger communities, especially in areas of disadvantage and 
deprivation. Since 2010, MAI has worked with more than 1,800 refugees and 
asylum seekers, reaching around 37,000 people through its shows. It will spend 
its prize money on school events, recordings and performances, to reach wider 
audiences still.

“Winning this award will have a fundamental impact in making refugees and 
asylum seekers feel they are being given some recognition of who they are, what 
they contribute and what they’re going through,” says Lis Murphy, the charity’s 
creative director.

MyBnk: Guardian Charity Awards winner 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/dec/13/mybnk-guardian-charity-awards-winner-2016-video>
Working in schools and also with vulnerable young people, including care 
leavers and youth offenders, MyBnk aims to help them avoid debt and live 
independently. It has already armed 160,000 11- to 25-year-olds with budgeting 
and saving skills.

The judges praised the way the charity involves young people in the creation 
of its programmes to ensure they are effective, and highlighted how 
successfully it has scaled up its work. Financial education is covered by a 
single bullet point in the national curriculum, says Declan Wilkes, MyBnk’s 
head of communications, and is not mandatory in academies, free schools, 
primary schools or sixth forms. The charity’s workshops come in time for some 
young people’s biggest “firsts” – from opening a bank account and leaving home, 
to accessing credit and starting university. MyBnk will use its prize money to 
deliver sessions to 150 vulnerable young people.

Winning will have an enormous impact, says Wilkes. “This really raises the 
flag that there’s a way of addressing some of the issues that cost us so much 
in adulthood. It’s a lightning rod for the cause, and it will definitely help 
us attract more support. More financial service companies, such as Prudential, 
are starting to back us – and this will help us demonstrate to corporates the 
value of scaling what works in the charity sector.”

<https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/dec/13/refugee-and-migrant-centre-guardian-charity-awards-winner-2016-video>
The Refugee and Migrant Centre offers a range of help to asylum seekers, 
refugees and other vulnerable migrants in the Black Country – including 
accommodation, immigration and health advice, education, training and 
employment.

Now, thanks to its charity award, it will also be able to address mental 
health issues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/08/experts-sound-alarm-mental-health-toll-migrants-refugees-depression-anxiety-psychosis>
 among traumatised asylum seekers. “For a long time we’ve identified this dire, 
unmet need,” says Heather Thomas, the organisation’s head of new projects. 
“Many of our asylum-seeking clients experience low-level mental health issues 
at least, because of the experiences in their home country that made them 
leave, as well as the journey here and then their experiences since arriving.

“People are suffering from sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, low moods. The 
need is probably bigger than any other health issues we’re addressing.”

Such clients aren’t able to get mental health support via mainstream routes 
because of wider issues impacting on their mental health – things like their 
legal status, accommodation and financial security – are largely unresolved. 
The centre, based in Wolverhampton, will use its prize money to pilot a 
six-week course teaching exercises to help manage stress and low mood, and 
hopes health service funders will support its continuation.

The judges were impressed by the depth and breadth of its impact, highlighting 
“a combination of solid support and innovation” and adding: “They are 
aspirational in what they do.”

TCC: Guardian Charity Awards winner 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/dec/13/tcc-guardian-charity-awards-winner-2016-video>
With a tiny core staff, TCC (Trefnu Cymunedol Cymru/Together Creating 
Communities <http://www.tcc-wales.org.uk/>) trains around 150 adults and young 
people a year in community leadership and supports them in campaigning for 
change on issues affecting their lives.

Its community organisers bring together members in north-east Wales, including 
faith groups, community organisations and schools, to discuss new issues they 
are facing and to agree on action to be taken. They then arrange face-to-face 
meetings with decision makers such as MPs, Welsh Assembly members, councillors 
and business people.

The judges noted the real impact of TCC’s work, seen in the practical 
improvements won for communities, and praised its collaboration with other 
charities. Recent successes include a campaign calling on Wrexham council to 
sign up to theSyrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/472020/Syrian_Resettlement_Fact_Sheet_gov_uk.pdf>
. Winning will allow the 21-year-old charity to develop a stage further as it 
looks to develop and ideally increase its staff numbers and geographical reach, 
says lead organiser Sam Rex-Edwards. The tailored support element of the prize 
in trustee training, development and communications will be crucial, 
particularly for a charity that operates in a unique way.

“With such a small staff team where we’re wearing so many hats, it’s just 
going to be invaluable to have somebody else giving an external perspective and 
challenging us,” says Rex-Edwards.


“We’re overwhelmed and delighted to have won. It means so much to everybody.”
