The British singer-songwriter Peter Sarstedt has died aged 75.

Best known for the 1969 number one hit Where Do You Go to My Lovely 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8XQZYIiNgo>, his family announced that he 
died after a six-year battle with progressive supranuclear palsy.

His family released a statement, according to the BBC, saying they were “with 
him to the last” and that his music would be missed by many.


During his 50-year career, Sarstedt created 14 albums, the last of which, 
Restless Heart, was released in 2013.

He released at least two singles a year between 1967 and 1987, including 
Beirut, Take Off Your Clothes and I’m a Cathedral.


Sarstedt was born into a musical family in Delhi – his parents were classical 
musicians and his brothers, Eden Kane (real name Richard Graham) and Clive 
Sands (real name Robin) both became pop stars.


His music received widespread attention again in the 2000s when Where Do You 
Go to My Lovely, which won him an Ivor Novello award in 1969, was used in the 
Wes Anderson films Hotel Chevalier andThe Darjeeling Limited

2010.
