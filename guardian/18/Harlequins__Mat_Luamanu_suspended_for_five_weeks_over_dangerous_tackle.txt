The Harlequins <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/harlequinsru> forward Mat 
Luamanu has been given a five-week suspension by the Rugby Football Union for 
dangerous tackling.

Luamanu received a yellow card in the first half of his team’s win over Exeter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/exeter> in the Anglo-Welsh Cup on Saturday 
for a tackle on the opposition fly-half Will Hooley.

The 27-year-old New Zealander was subsequently cited for the challenge, and a 
statement from the RFU on Tuesday said: “The charge against Mathew Luamanu of 
Harlequins RFC for dangerous tackling, contrary to Law 10.4(e), was heard in 
London this evening.

“Luamanu pleaded not guilty, but was given a five-week suspension. He is free 
to play again on 13 December.”

The chairman of the RFU discipline panel, Sir James Dingemans, said: “The 
panel upheld the citing, concluding that Mathew Luamanu had committed a 
dangerous tackle because he had made contact with his [Hooley’s] head, having 
been reckless within the meaning of RFU Regulation 19.11.8(b) and Appendix 5.”

Luamanu was banned for three weeks by the RFU for a tackle on the Sale forward 
Josh Beaumont in September.
