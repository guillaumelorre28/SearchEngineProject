A piece of an aircraft wing found on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mauritius> has been identified as belonging 
to missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Malaysian and Australian officials 
said Friday.

The piece of wing flap was found in May and subsequently analysed by experts 
at the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is heading up the search for 
the plane in a remote stretch of ocean off Australia’s west coast.

Investigators used a part number found on the debris to link it to the missing 
Boeing 777, the agency said in a statement.

Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai also confirmed the identification.

Several pieces of wreckage from the plane have washed ashore on coastlines 
around the Indian Ocean since the aircraft vanished with 239 people on board 
during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on 8 March, 2014.

So far, none of the debris has helped narrow down the precise location of the 
main underwater wreckage. Investigators need to find that in order to locate 
the flight data recorders that could help explain why the plane veered so far 
off-course.

Search crews are expected to finish their sweep of the 120,000 square kms 
(46,000 square mile) search zone in the Indian Ocean by December.

Oceanographers have been analysing wing flaps found in Tanzania and on the 
French island of La Reunion to see if they might be able to identify a 
potential new search area through drift modelling.

But any new search would require more funding; Malaysia, Australia and China 
said in July that the $160m hunt will be suspended once the current stretch of 
ocean is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific 
location of the aircraft.
