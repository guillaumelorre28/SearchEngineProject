Every five years, on camera, Ragnar Kjartansson

’s actress mother, Guðrún Ásmundsdóttir, spits on her son’s face. He stands 
beside her, a dutiful but errant son in a dapper suit, and takes it. Sometimes 
alarming, always surprising, and weirdly joyful, the Icelandic artist’s 
Barbican exhibition captivated audiences, many of whom returned again and again 
to a show that was itself full of repetition.

On screen, American band the National (recorded live in New York) sang their 
songSorrow <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6p_qe45miY> for six hours 
straight. In The Visitors, the artist and his friends, all miked-up and 
occupying different rooms of a dilapidated Hudson Valley mansion, performed 
another song, with lyrics provided by the artist’s ex-wife, over and over, in a 
cumulative, plangent performance that tugged at the heart.

 Songs and sadness … visitors are serenaded at Ragnar Kjartansson’s Barbican 
exhibition. Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty 
Filling one part of his show with a group of live troubadours, who lounged 
about, drank beer and sang an accompaniment to a 1970s Icelandic soft-porn 
movie starring Kjartansson’s parents (the story goes that he was conceived 
during their onscreen antics), the exhibition was full of twists and turns, 
paintings and portraits, song and sadness.

Having seen Kjartansson’s work in Venice and New York, in Penarth and in 
London, he always makes me want to go back and see it all again. I never tire 
of The Visitors, with its constant refrain: “And so, once more, I fall into my 
feminine ways.” Embracing high aspirations and low comedy, Ragnar’s work is 
glorious, life-affirming, funny and utterly disarming.

He even had two young women floating about the Barbican pond in a rowing boat, 
kissing through the afternoon, both pretending to be Helena Bonham Carter. 
Whatever he does, Ragnar is always a performer, at once crooner, impresario, 
stage compère, film director, painter. It is all one to him, the act of being 
an artist. He is an artist for our times and what times they are.Read more

If anyone ever doubted Rauschenberg, or would collapse him into an enfant 
terrible who once erased a Willem de Kooning drawing and stuck a tyre round the 
belly of a stuffed goat,this stunning, hugely enjoyable exhibition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/29/robert-rauschenberg-review-tate-modern>
 shows a prolific artist constantly refreshing his art and rethinking his game. 
With a great touch and feel for materials, Rauschenberg was as inventive as he 
was acute, turning much of what came after him into footnotes.Read a review

 ‘What a great no-show’ … Maria Eichhorn’s 5 weeks, 25 days, 175 hours.

break for the duration ofher exhibition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/25/nothing-to-see-here-maria-eichhorn-chisenhale-gallery>
, and expected them not to work. Neither strike nor protest, Eichhorn asked 
what the value of time was, how we use it, how we spend it. Galleries are human 
places as much as spaces for objects to be displayed. Eichhorn made us think 
about labour, and what happens when it is withdrawn. What a great no-show this 
was.Read more

Parreno has turned the Turbine Hall into a kind of musical instrument,

matches, the sound of the river piped in from outside. Often, nothing happens, 
till the noise of a passing aircraft roars through the building, or the noise 
of rain drums through the space. Screens rise and fall from the roof, and a 
ventriloquist speaks to a squid in a tank.Anywhen

its cavernous undercroft, to David Medalla’s delicate foam fountains, from

This biting exploration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/20/monuments-should-not-be-trusted-yugoslav-art-fascinates-country-gone>
 of art during the communist years of the former Yugoslavia was fascinatingly 
chaotic, catching the flavour, contradictions and conflicts of art under Tito’s 
communism. The exhibition resurrected forgotten experimental film-makers and 
hilarious period pieces by artists who found themselves local heroes on the 
fringes of official culture, set beside monstrous and monumental brutalist 
ashtrays and other factory gifts to Tito. This was in-depth curating with a 
sense of adventure and fun.Read more

 Far-sighted pioneer … Klint’s Evolutionen, 1908 Photograph: Albin

There may be as much wish fulfilment in the idea that Swedish artist Hilma af 
Klint 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/21/hilma-af-klint-occult-spiritualism-abstract-serpentine-gallery>
 was a far-sighted pioneer of modernism as there is in the idea that her 
paintings reveal unseen spirit worlds. Her beautiful work remains a revelation 
nonetheless. Drawing on the same spiritualist beliefs as Kandinsky and 
Mondrian, she stipulated that her work was not to be shown till 30 years after 
her death in 1944. We get it now, but much about her remains a mystery, still 
to be unravelled.Read a review
