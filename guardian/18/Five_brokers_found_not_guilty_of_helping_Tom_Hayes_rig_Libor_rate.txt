Five brokers accused of helping rig the Libor interest rate have been found 
not guilty by a jury at Southwark crown court in London.


In a large blow to the Serious Fraud Office, five of the six brokers accused 
of helping Tom Hayes – who is serving 11 years in prison – to rig Libor have 
been cleared. The judge has asked the jury to reach a majority verdict on the 
sixth.

The brokers on a trial were Darrell Read, Danny Wilkinson and Colin Goodman, 
who worked at Icap, Noel Cryan, formerly of Tullett Prebon, and Jim Gilmour and 
Terry Farr, who worked at RP Martin.

The jury reached a not guilty verdict on one count of conspiracy to defraud 
faced by Read, but is yet to reach a verdict on the second count.

The trial of the brokers has lasted 15 weeks, but the jury was out for less 
than a day before revealing its verdicts.

The brokers, whose nicknames included “Lord Libor” and “Big Nose”, were 
accused of acting as gobetweens by passing around requests from traders and 
being paid extra commission by Hayes.

The jury will return on Thursday.
