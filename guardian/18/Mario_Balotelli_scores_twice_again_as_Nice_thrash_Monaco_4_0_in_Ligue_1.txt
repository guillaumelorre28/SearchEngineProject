Alassane Plea rounded off the scoring to put Nice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nice> on 14 points from six games.

Monaco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/monaco> suffered their first 
league defeat of the season and now lie third on 13 points, behind Paris St 
Germain on goal difference.

Champions PSG beat Dijon 3-0 on Tuesday.

Bordeaux are fourth on 12 points after a 3-0 win at Metz on Wednesday while 
Lyon moved up to seventh on 10 points courtesy of a 5-1 hammering of 10-man 
Montpellier with Nabil Fekir and Corentin Tolisso scoring twice each.

At the Allianz Riviera, Nice took matters into their own hands and went ahead 
in the 18th minute when Baysse headed home from a free kick.

Balotelli, in only his second league appearance, doubled the lead from just 
inside the box just after half an hour with a low shot after being perfectly 
set up by Younes Belhanda.

The former Liverpool and Milan striker, who scored only one goal in Serie A 
last season, scored his fourth in two league games by tapping in from Ricardo 
Pereira’s cross in the 69th minute.

It got even worse for Monaco as Tiemoue Bakayoko was shown a straight red card 
for a foul in the box, but Plea’s penalty kick was parried away by Danijel 
Subasic.

Plea, however, quickly made amends by heading Nice’s fourth from Wylan 
Cyprien’s cross. The result left Nice as the only undefeated team inLigue 1
