It’s the age-old debate from a galaxy far, far away: which has the most 
hardcore fans –Star Wars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> or The 
Archers <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-archers>? Felicity Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/felicity-jones> acted in both, as Rogue One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story>’s Jyn Erso and 
Ambridge’s Emma Grundy. She says there’s no contest. “Nothing beats an Archers 
fan for their level of devotion,” she told the BBC. Is she right?
