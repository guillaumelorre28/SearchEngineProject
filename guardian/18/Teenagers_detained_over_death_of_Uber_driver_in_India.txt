Indian police have detained two teenagers for allegedly killing a 51-year-old 
Uber driver in New Delhi earlier this week, after an argument erupted in the 
car. The two 17-year-olds “got into a heated argument with the driver” soon 
after entering the vehicle,Delhi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/delhi> 
police deputy commissioner, Pushpendra Kumar, told Agence France-Presse.

Since both of the suspects are minors, they cannot be formally arrested in 
accordance with Indian law. The police said a juvenile board will now decide 
what action should be taken against them.


The initial police investigation suggested that the argument could have 
started over directions or where to stop the car. “The driver, Kuldeep, was 
shot twice, once each in the head and chest, and his body was dumped,” Kumar 
said. A Press Trust ofIndia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> report 
said that Kuldeep is survived by his wife and three children.

Locals discovered the body at a secluded spot in the capital on Thursday, a 
day after the killing. Police officials said the accused were tracked with help 
from the cab company’s software, which the duo had used to book their ride.


In a statement, Uber later said that it had “proactively shared details” to 
help the police investigation.Uber <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber>
