Sir Terence Etherton, Britain’s first openly gay senior judge, has been 
appointed master of the rolls, making him head of the civil judiciary in 
England and Wales.

The 64-year-old lawyer’s promotion was confirmed by an announcement from 
Downing Street on Thursday morning.

Etherton, who has been on the court of appeal and is currently chancellor of 
the high court, was a member of the British Olympic fencing team for sabre in 
1980.

He will be the second most senior judge in England and Wales, outranked only 
by the lord chief justice,Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd

and will receive a salary of around £220,000.

Educated at St Paul’s school in west London and Corpus Christi College, 
Cambridge, Etherton has been a judge since 2001 and was the first to become so 
while publicly declaring his sexuality.

He entered a civil partnership in 2006 with Andrew Stone, which was then 
converted to a marriage in 2014 in a traditional Jewish wedding ceremony at 
West London Synagogue.

On joining the appeal court in 2008, Etherton said: “My appointment also shows 
that diversity in sexuality is not a bar to preferment up to the highest levels 
of the judiciary.”

Etherton, who takes up the post in October, succeeds Lord Dyson, who has been 
master of the rolls since 2012

Thomas said: “I am delighted to congratulate Sir Terence Etherton on his 
appointment as master of the rolls. Following his excellent work as chancellor 
over the last three years, I look forward to continuing to work with him 
closely in the major reform of our system of justice.”
