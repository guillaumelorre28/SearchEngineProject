whipsnakes, bad karma, Rio Bravo, Sister Morphine, go fuck yourself.”

 You Need Hands

 Would you like to see more chaos in the world?
Transvision Vamp: “Yes, definitely.”

 Transvision Vamp, you’re alright. Which is more important – the brain or the 
body?
Wendy: “Oh, the brain.”
Nick: “Oh, the body.”

 Why’s that?
Nick: “You can’t fuck with your brain.”
Wendy: “You can’t fuck without one. You have to have your brain to tell you 
what to do. If your brain wasn’t turned on, you wouldn’t get a hard-on.”
Nick: “But if you just had a brain and no body you’d look pretty stupid.”
Wendy: “I think the two go hand-in-hand really.”

So it’s the hands that count...?
Wendy: “Hur hur hur. The spirit.”
Tex: “What do you go for in a girl – brain or body?”

 Me? Eyes. Especially if they’re in the back of her head. What’s all this about
Patti Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/16/patti-smith-remembrance-lost-found-singer>
, you manifesto maestros?
Wendy: “My favourite female singer. A true rebel.”

 So will you be reciting poetry on your next record?
Wendy: “Yeah. Then I’m gonna fall off a stage and break my neck.

 Then you’ll write a play with Sam Shepard?
Wendy: “Yes, that’s it. Phwoar, Sam Shepard.”
Nick: “Patti Smith’s the sexiest woman in music history apart from Debbie Harry
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2014/nov/02/debbie-harrys-glory-years-in-pictures>
. No, sheis. I know she’s ugly, but she’s wild. Imagine what she’d be saying to 
you when you fuck her.”
Wendy: “So the brain is more important?”

 Excuse me ... she went off to paint, didn’t she?
Tex: “Yes. And decorate.”
Wendy: “So anyway, tell me about her and Sam Shepard...”

 Well...

“COME ON, it’s like, well, the highest form of anything is sainthood. A 
marvellous thief like Villon or Genet ... they were saints cos they raised 
thievery to its highest state of grace. People want a street angel. They want a 
saint but with a cowboy mouth. Somebody to get off on when they can’t get off 
on themselves. A sort of god in our image ... y’know? Am I losing ya? I mean, 
just tell me if I’m getting draggy. It’s just hard and it’s real important ...”
“No, baby, it’s beautiful.”
“Well, I want it to be perfect, cos it’s the only religion I got … any great 
motherfucker rock’n’roll song can raise me higher than all of Revelations.”

The Perfunctory Bit

 Transvision Vamp. I am talking to Wendy James (former child opera star, of 
lost Norwegian parents), Nick Christian Sayer, and Tex Axile. Revolution Baby, 
and they were supposed to be the foamy sea that washed over us. Not quite. 
Never mind, let’s try again. Tell That Girl to Shut Up, as belted out by Holly 
and the Italians, the sort of great trashy song you thought nobody remembered 
but you. And soon, an album with the only name it could have; Pop Art, 
featuring Hanging Out With Halo Jones, Andy Warhol’s Dead, and Sex Kick. Every 
one a rip-off, every one a thrill.

 Transvision Vamp didn’t want me to interview them. Partly because Wendy is 
Sinead O’Connor’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/17/sinead-oconnor-review-barbican-london>
s babysitter, and partly because they thought I would ask them to “justify 
themselves”. I have never asked a pop group to justify itself in my life. 
There’s no need; fools always stick their own gob in the noose.

 Anyway, I may not be impressed by Transvision Vamp’s press officer, the Queen 
of Bloody Sheba, but if I have time right now to think about the group itself 
and what it’s gamely doing, I could well be as dazzled as those who’ve gone 
before me.

 Transvision Vamp drop all the right names and all you can do, despite the 
nagging doubt that they’re a journalist’s dream concept rather than a human 
being’s pop group, is catch them like a puppy. There’s enough rain, concrete, 
and science. Quite enough. Vamp would like to vomit shooting stars and seduce 
the eye of the storm. Make of all this what you will: it’s the only way. I’d 
just like to add that Revolution Baby was not, as is commonly thought, Get It 
On. It was Telegram Sam. I know about these things. Call it a soft spot.

Great Artists of Our Time 
No 1: Andy Warhol

 Where were you when he died? Gosh, it’s like John F Kennedy, isn’t it?
Wendy: “I think I wasn’t born.”

 But it was only last year!
Wendy: “No, John F Kennedy.”

 Ah.
Nick: “[Warhol’s] not dead though, he’s asleep. You know that, don’t you?”
Tex: “I used to serve him camomile tea at Nell’s. It’s the only way to get 
someone’s confidence. Then I stole the tape of the telephone conversation with 
him that you can hear on the track.”
Wendy: “He made extreme amounts of money doing the most banal things and 
taking the piss out of everything.”
Tex: “The fact that he’s dead just means the space is there for someone else 
to do what he did.”

<http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DcoVVVrAXmhc&media=>
 And that’s Transvision Vamp?
Tex: “No, Kylie Minogue.”
Wendy: “We just take all our favourite music and make something relevant to 
the 80s out of it, which is similar to what hip-hop has done. Like Warhol took 
things that were there, and flogged them for all they were worth.”

 For all they weren’t worth.
Nick: “The thing is stealing blatantly and not being precious about it. Like 
the Pet Shop Boys were aboutthat Cat Stevens thing 
<http://www.soundsjustlike.com/293/pet-shop-boys-sounds-like-cat-stevens/>. We 
just say, ‘Yeah, of course we ripped that off ...’ And when people hear the 
B-side of the single,God Save the Royalties 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzQYnOTQGbM>, which is one of our songs 
backwards, it shouldirritate ...”
Wendy: “We’re just doing to Warhol what he would do to bananas.”


No 2: Salvador Dalí

What else would you do it to?
Tex: “We’re just waiting for Salvador to die, but he’s hanging on.”
Wendy: “We’re gonna collaborate with Amanda Lear. We went to see her play on 
Dalí at Riverside. It was complete crap.”

 But where’s the surrealism in this group?
Tex: “Everyone wears a fish down their trousers.”

 Come on, Transvision Vamp have a strong sense of reality – everything’s very 
zap-pownow, contemporary, bang up-to-the-minute (in fact, they straddle the 
thin line between self-awareness and self-consciousness), whereas surrealists 
would bung in a few elephants from 1862 ...
Tex: “Oh, the elephants are on the next album.”

 The only thing I don’t like about the present day – well, hell no, one of the 
things I don’t like about the present day – is that all this technology and all 
these computer games (which you more than dabble with) are not very romantic or 
poetic. There’s something cold and clinical ...
Nick: “It can be very romantic. ’Cos on your little computer at home you can 
phone someone up and leave a love-letter on their screen for the next morning. 
Kids now probably dream or fantasise in a different way to us. More violently.”
Wendy: “I shouldn’t think their levels of romanticism or dreams or creativity 
are any greater or lesser than ours, it’s just a different world.”
Nick: “Not all kids are at home with computers. Where we live they’re all out 
on the street selling dope and throwing stones at us.”
Wendy: “Human nature doesn’t change through generations though, does it? Just 
its surroundings.”

 But it can be surreptitiously redirected. It can veer …
Wendy: “The emotions can be put through different outlets, but I shouldn’t 
think what they’re experiencing is any different to the anger and violence we 
felt when we were young.”

 Should we perhaps discuss “rebellion”?
Nick: “Music as a youthful rebellion ended with the Pistols really; you can’t 
go any further than that. But you can irritate. Anything that’s conservative or 
stuck in its ways is giving you the opportunity to annoy it.The rules are: 
there are no rules.”

Jiggers, it’s the lobster man! Quick, put away that knife. We don’t want to 
scare him off. Oh, Mr Lobster Man. We’re so happy to see you. We were just 
talking about you. Won’t you come in? Have a seat. How long have you been a 
lobster?

(Cowboy Mouth)

No 3: Charles Bukowski 

Have you seen Barfly <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/35643/barfly> 
yet? What do you think of Bukowski’s writing?
Wendy: “Um – I love the way all the critics said there was no story, because 
of course there’s no beginning middle or end,it just is ... I love that 
romanticism. He was a drunken old fart who didn’t care about the concept of 
being some respected writer: he just wrote and wanted to drink. He was an old 
slob. But that’s far more enjoyable than somebody who’s really precious about 
their work and has got their head up their arse.”

 But he still wrote. Why?
Nick: “To give him something to do when the pubs were shut.”

 That won’t do. He could, and surely did, get take-outs.
Tex: “He shagged a lot of women as well. I don’t know whether feminists would 
like that sort of thing. Do they? I mean, would they?”
Wendy: “He only had two girls in that film.”
Tex: “Yes, but have you read Women?”
Wendy: “Yeah – if he was that out of it he couldn’t’ve got it together.”

 So are you the Warhol of pop or the Bukowski of pop?
“Both. And the Salvador Dalí. Have you been listening?”

 This was the first interview I’ve ever done where my trusty tape recorder 
didn’t work smoothly at first. I consider this a significant landmark in my 
you-kick-my-shins-and-I’ll-kick yours-you-bastard relationship with technology.

 No 4: Holly Beth Vincent

 Whatever happened to Holly <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shYf4x7PWg4>?
Nick: “I saw her down the Rock Garden once. Miles away. Brilliant.”
Wendy: “She went out with Mark Knopfler, didn’t she? And disappeared?”

 She’ll get some royalties now <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kia8_rnuKrs>, 
anyhow.
Wendy: “Not if we can help it! Actually, I heard she became a drug addict in 
New York.”
Nick: “Became? I think she already was.”
Wendy: “Oh yeah ... Oh no, it wasn’t her that you knew intimately, was it?”
Nick: “No. That was Wendy Wu. But anyway.”

 But anyway.
Wendy: “She went out with Paul Simonon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/23/the-clash-mick-jones-paul-simonon>
 as well, which you have to give her credit for. Holly, I mean.”

 Wendy talks a lot about her love for the Clash, although, past a certain 
point, I think this might be a trifle tongue-in-cheek. Transvision Vamp’s 
tongue is in fact welded to their cheek. That’s a lot of tongue and a lot of 
cheek. Some welder.

 Why Tell That Girl [for the next single]? (Psychosonic Cindy 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE99YupX2Ak> was diverted because “it was too 
psychotic”. Uh huh.)
Wendy: “It’s a brilliant comment, as it happens, on all those little girls who 
dance around on Top of the Pops saying: ‘You can fuck me too if you want to.’ 
Fuck me, I’m 22 years old, those girls are half my age, so I tell them to fuck
right off.”

 It’s designed to show you as a tough chick?
“I don’t know if it’s designed to do that, but it will do that.”

 Hey, she’s sharp. But is she a tough chick? She’s been described in her time 
as both “conniving” and “naive” ...

Wendy: “It’s far more exciting to see a girl challenging, and saying: ‘You 
can’t pull the wool over my eyes ’cos I’ve got a brain actually.’ And the 
attitude of the song sums up what every girl feels in that situation: don’t 
ignore me just because you’ve got a new girlfriend. And it also ties in with 
Fatal Attraction, in my head. But that’s got nothing to do with it really.”

 Mish Mash

[Fatal Attraction is] a crap film. And don’t see Baby Boom 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKHGK7KWz5g>, chucks, it’ll taint your vision 
of Sam forever. And as for Star Wars, which you cite frequently ...
Nick: “But we contrast it with Easy Rider. The populist and the cult. The 
furthest things away from each other.”
Tex: “Plus they were both written on LSD. I mean, who would cast a huge monkey 
as the hero’s right-hand-man if they weren’t out to lunch?”

 Isn’t it d-d-d-dodgy mentioning LSD?
Nick: “But we are a supremely dodgy band.”
Wendy: “We don’t take it.”
Nick and Tex: “’Cos we’ve taken so much we can’t take any more, if we take one 
more we disappear.”

 The new video has Transvision Vamp whizzing about “on Harley Davidson 
choppers with Triumph gear on, which is sacrilege to bikers. Our whole thing is 
a mish-mash of images, see?”

 Wendy: “The Comic Strip 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/28/comic-strip-reunited> are 
so much sharper than 99% of rock groups. What they’re doing to drama is what 
I’d like to see us doing to music. Hitting the mainstream at peak time butevery 
sentence cuts …showing up the rest as puerile.”

 You’re very London, aren’t you?
“We’re global.”

 But maybe you wouldn’t be so aware of “the global” if you were in, I dunno ...
Macclesfield?
“Wherever you are in the world, you’re still in your brain.”

Fools For Love

 Aren’t there any twisty love songs?
“Sister Moon is about being in love with nature, man. We are actually ecology 
voters.”

 Oh well, that’s good because it’s the opposite end of the spectrum from the 
technology stuff ...
Wendy: “But you have to accept everything ...”
Nick: “Any Hot Hits album from any year will give you five love songs with the 
same words in a different order ... but ours don’t do that ...”
Wendy: “What do you suppose that means? Does that mean we’re not aiming at the 
12-year-olds?”
Nick: “No, it just means we’re not repeating exactly what’s gone before. We’re 
stealing it and changing it and making it something new.”
Wendy: “But does a 12-year-old want to be challenged?”
Nick: “Of course. That’s why people end up in factories doing something they 
don’t want to do for 40 years. Because they just accept it.”
Wendy: “Yes, but they don’t want to challenge love at that age, do they?”

 They want to embrace it. They want to never, never give you up. (Make me 12.)
Wendy: “Right.”

 But anyway, Stock, Aitken and Waterman are like woodwork men.
Wendy: “Sorry?”

 I mean, carpenters. Craftsmen.
Wendy: “Oh. Yes. Disgusting.”

“We’ll be there before you can spit in a hornet’s eye. In fact! In fact, you 
know what?”
“What?”
“We’re here.” 

(Cowboy Mouth)

The 1990s 

 Wendy: “I should think they’ll be very violent.”
Tex: “See, I don’t think the 80s has happened. The 60s happened in the 
mid-60s, the 70s happened in ’76-’77, the 80shas not happened yet. It’s gone 
back to disco cliche music of ’72. I think we’ll find in the next two years the 
musical change will occur, and that’s where we’re going.”

 Or maybe it won’t happen, and that’ll be what happened. That nothing happened.
Tex: “Ha! I think it’ll come.”

 Transvision Vamp wriggle on thus, pillaging 30 years of pop history, rocking 
and roleplaying. (I trust they appreciate this has been the world’s first 
scratch feature, sampling Sam and Patti no end and sod the copyrights.) What 
I’ve heard of Pop Art is quite splendidly stewed in impact. They will play live 
(“energy”) soon, and Wendy hopes Jessica Lange fancies a divorce.

 When I’m out of the room they accost the tape recorder and say very rude 
things about fucking my brain. I’d blush if I hadn’t guessed. Transvision Vamp 
are as transparent as they come but God knows we need windows. Savoir-faire and 
sheen.

 So why wasn’t Revolution Baby – the perfect hit – a hit?
“It’s number one in Czechoslovakia.”

 There’s a funny thing.
