 man.

The bruised 48-year-old victim suffered facial injuries and required hospital 
treatment after being punched and kicked in the street in the early hours of 10 
December.

The assault happened outside Chelsea Food Fayre on Kings Road in Chelsea, west 
London.

Scotland Yard described the man they wanted to speak to as white and aged 
about 30, with short brown hair. He was wearing a short black jacket and jeans. 
He was with a woman, to whom police are also keen to speak.

A Metropolitan police spokesman said: “Police are keen to hear from anyone who 
may recognise the man shown in the CCTV still or those who witnessed the 
assault. The road would have been busy with people travelling home after a 
night out in the area and it is possible that they may have seen or heard 
something that will help the investigation.”

Almost 80% of people sleeping rough were attacked or suffered abuse or 
antisocial behaviour over the past year, according to figures from theCrisis 
<http://www.crisis.org.uk/news.php/1117/research-scale-of-violence-against-rough-sleepers-revealed>
 homelessness charity released shortly before Christmas. About one in three 
rough sleepers questioned in England and Wales said they had been deliberately 
hit or kicked or been subjected to violence, while a similar number said they 
had had things thrown at them.

Almost half reported being intimidated or threatened with violence, six in 10 
claimed to have been verbally abused or harassed and 10% said people had 
urinated on them. About 7% said they had been the victim of a sexual assault 
while homeless. The report was drawn from a survey of 458 rough sleepers.
