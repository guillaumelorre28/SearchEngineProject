Luke Winslow-King

jazz. This debut set is a celebration of Chris Ligon, the left-field country

Flotus (For Love Often Turns Us Still) (Merge), 4 November

decades; this time around, the songs promise to pay homage to Kendrick Lamar,

Miranda Lambert 

(Title and date unknown)

Last month, Miranda Lambert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/28/miranda-lambert-country-renegade-interview>
 released Vice, a new single off her forthcoming album that is unlike anything 
we hear on country radio. It was written from the perspective of a woman coping 
with the wreckage of a relationship by numbing herself with casual sex, and the 
song’s very real subject keeps her in good company with other country 
rule-breakers like Loretta Lynn and Kitty Wells.
