In his illuminating book of essays, The Pleasures of Good Photographs 
<http://aperture.org/shop/books/the-pleasures-of-good-photographs-2535>, Gerry 
Badger <http://www.gerrybadger.com/> speaks of “the quiet photographer” who is 
unusually attentive to “the thereness of things and places”. Badger was 
referring to the work ofStephen Shore <http://stephenshore.net/>, who once 
declared photography “an exercise in attention 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/nov/13/photography.shopping>” 
and “an art that calls forth intelligence, concentration and delicacy”.

These quotes came back to me when I first encountered the Dutch photographer 
Awoiska van der Molen <http://www.awoiska.nl/>’s work at a group show called 
Natural Order <http://www.purdyhicks.com/exhibitions.php?opt=p&aid=133> back in 
June.

 #245-18. 
Now comes her first photobook, Sequester 
<http://www.ideabooks.nl/9789490119294-awoiska-van-der-molen-sequester>, which 
is laden with an inordinate sense of silence. Her monochrome landscapes, made 
using long exposures at dusk or early morning, alert us in their meditative way 
not just to the thereness, but also to what James Joyce calledthe “whatness” of 
things <http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/paper_valente.html>.

Van der Molen favours out-of-the-way places – the volcanic landscapes of the 
smaller Canary Islands loom large in her book. She spent long periods of time 
there alone, honing not just her craft but the sense of isolation needed to 
“gain access to the stoic nature of the landscape”, as she so memorably puts it.

 #212-7. 
Here is a photographer that is infinitely patient, and interested in the 
stubborn core of things. Her images are captured in single exposures of up to 
half an hour, then painstakingly printed in her darkroom on large format, 
silver gelatin paper. The methodology is unapologetically old-fashioned, and 
the results extraordinary powerful.

In one of my favourite shots, a black mountaintop looms out of the slate-grey 
darkness, two wavy white lines flowing from the peak like moonlit streams. 
Astonishingly, these are light trails made by two groups of nocturnal hikers, 
which she managed to capture from a distance thanks to long exposure. You do 
not need to know this to appreciate its haunting beauty, but it alerts us to 
the delicacy of her transformative art.

Elsewhere, the flowery braces of tall trees

 that is deep spatially and atmospherically. You can almost hear the rustle of 
the mountain breeze. You often feel you could be looking at a different planet:
volcanic rock seems lunar 
<http://blog-imgs-65.fc2.com/t/a/k/takumisuzuki123/53b0af74d2802_vanderMolen_Awoiska_01_20140903150631975.jpg>
; cliffs give way to ominously dark voids that could be the edge of the world; 
surfaces look alien with their odd shadows and crevices. In one startling shot, 
a huge peak rises out of a barren plain, witha single line of grey 
<http://www.villanoailles-hyeres.com/uphyeres26/van_der_molen_awoiska_2.jpg> – 
a walking track, perhaps – traced as if by hand over its brow.

The book is beautiful, but it is worth trying to see her work in a gallery, 
where the detail of the silver gelatin prints adds to the palpable sense of 
emptiness and isolation. She has just won the grand prize of the Japanese 
Hariban award, which allows her to travel to Kyoto to study colloidal printing 
with the master craftsmen of theBenrido Collotype Atelier 
<https://benrido-collotype.today/>.

 #275-4. All photographs: Awoiska van der Molen 
One senses that, for Van der Molen, photography is like a metaphysical quest, 
a journey to the essence of things. Her images take me back to Nan Shepherd’s 
classic bookThe Living Mountain 
<http://www.canongate.tv/the-living-mountain-3.html>, which recounts, in 
luminous prose, the Scottish writer’s lifelong fascination with the Cairngorms 
as a physical and spiritual landscape. In it, she writes of her solitary 
walking and looking: “It is a journey into Being: for as I penetrate more 
deeply into the mountain’s life, I penetrate also into my own. For an hour I am 
beyond desire ... I am not out of myself, but in myself. I am. To know Being, 
that is the final grace accorded from the mountain.” That grace exists, too, in 
these quiet photographs of a world both desolate and beautiful.
