Turkey’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said earlier that of the 20

were Turks. The family minister, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, said the majority of 
the injured were foreign, including nationals of Morocco, Lebanon and Libya.

Saudi Arabia did not immediately confirm a death toll for its nationals but 
issued a strong condemnation of the attack, saying the kingdom was “standing 
alongside brotherlyTurkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> against 
terrorism and extremism”.


The Dubai-based broadcaster al-Arabiya cited sources at the Saudi embassy in 
Istanbul as saying seven Saudi nationals had died and at least 10 were wounded.

Istanbul is a major tourist destination for holidaymakers from the Middle 
East, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors a year.

The Jordanian foreign ministry said three Jordanians had been killed and four 
injured, according to the Petra news agency, while Tunisia’s foreign ministry 
said two Tunisians had died. Media reports said the Tunisian victims were a 
businessman and his wife.

Three Lebanese citizens were among those killed in the attack, the country’s 
foreign ministry said. Four other Lebanese were injured.


The ministry named those killed as Elias Wardini, Haykal Mousallem and Rita 
Shami. Lebanon’s consulate in Istanbul and the state news agency said one of 
the injured was the daughter of an MP, Estephan El Douaihy.

Stephanie Deek, a friend of Moussallem’s wife, said the couple had been at the 
club when the attacker opened fire. “They were just tourists, married for five 
months,” she said. “They wanted to find the perfect place to spend New Year’s 
Eve.” Moussallem’s wife survived.

The Lebanese government said it was sending a plane with a medical team to 
Turkey on Sunday night to bring the wounded back to Beirut.

France’s foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said a woman with French and 
Tunisian citizenship had been killed, along with her Tunisian husband.

Israel’s foreign ministry said one of its citizens had died. Media reports 
named her as Leann Zaher Nasser, 18, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira.


India named two nationals – Abis Rizvi, the son of a former MP, and Khushi 
Shah – as among the dead. Morocco’s embassy in Ankara told the MAP news agency 
that three Moroccans had been wounded.

The foreign ministry of Belgium confirmed that a Belgian-Turkish dual national 
had been killed.

Turkish media said Turkey’s dead included Burak Yildiz, 22, a policeman who 
had been in the force for 18 months, Ayhan Arik, 47, a travel agent, and Hatice 
Karcilar, a private security guard.

Soylu, the interior minister, said that of the Turkish victims, three or four 
may have been employees of the club.

He added that four of the 69 wounded being treated in hospital were in a 
serious condition. Soylu said the attack was “a massacre, truly inhumane 
savagery.”
