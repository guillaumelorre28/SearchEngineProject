The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> 
government will crack down on foreign workers by forcing them to leave 
Australia within 60 days instead of 90 if they lose their jobs.

Announced as Labor sells its own policy of a crackdown on foreign workers in 
north Queensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/15/bill-shorten-vows-labor-will-crack-down-on-457-visa-program>
, the measure will come into effect from 19 November.

It also comes as rural Liberals reminded both sides that 457 visa holders are 
essential for labour shortages in rural and regional Australia.

The immigration minister, Peter Dutton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/peter-dutton>, said the measure was 
designed to ensure the 457 program fulfilled the intention of supplementing 
rather than substituting the Australian workforce.

“This change is about reducing competition from overseas workers for those 
Australians who are actively looking for work,” Dutton said.

The change was announced fewer than 24 hours after Liberal National party MP 
for Dawson,George Christensen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/george-christensen>, wrote to the 
prime minister calling for a total ban on 457 visas in central and north 
Queensland.

But Dutton said the regulation had been gazetted in October. He said Labor had 
extended <https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C01025> the 28-day period 
once employment ceased to 90 days in 2013.


Christensen also wrote to the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and the 
ministers for employment and immigration, requesting a moratorium on 457s in 
the region hardest hit by the mining downturn.

“The explosion of 457 workers that we saw under the Labor government, which 
peaked in 2012, saw many foreigners come to the region to take up jobs and many 
of those workers remain,” Christensen wrote on his website.

“This has caused considerable resentment and public backlash in a community 
where Australian workers have lost jobs and cannot find new ones.”

But Tony Pasin, Liberal MP for the South Australian seat of Barker, said it 
was dangerous to demonise foreign workers such as 457 visa holders, who filled 
critical needs in rural and regional communities.

“We need a balanced approach, particularly in regional areas they often fill 
critical needs whether it is at the hospital or on the factory floor,” Pasin 
said.

“There needs to be conversation to make sure the system enjoys integrity and 
is fit for purpose but simply demonising foreign workers, such as health 
workers who make a difference in regional communities, is dangerous.”

Pasin said he had received an emails from constituents who were worried that a 
Coalition MP had called for 457 visas to be stopped. Of one from Keith 
(population 1,100, he said: “She said while the system has to have integrity, 
these visas ‘fill a need’.”

Ewen Jones, the former Liberal MP for Herbert who lives in Townsville, said 
457 visa holders were essential to fill temporary shortages in regional 
economies and criticised both Labor and Christensen’s stance on the issue.

Jones said that in Townsville, one Indian family had arrived as doctors and 
nurses and their community quickly grew to 160 people from the same Indian 
district filling many health roles.

“We now have an Indian festival and we are proud to have them here and when 
you start pointing the finger you want to be bloody careful,” Jones said.

He said the rush to Trump-style politics was a mistake and an ugly look for 
Australia.

“I don’t think Trump won, it just shows what a shit candidate Hillary was,” 
Jones said. “Trump should not have been looked at, but this is an ugly look for 
Australia.”

Bill Shorten immediately claimed credit for the government’s 457 visa 
crackdown, sayingMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> had worked out 
the Australian people want to prioritise Australian people getting jobs.


“The question you have to ask of Malcolm Turnbull, Peter Dutton and George 
Christensen – as they are doing their window dressing, their fake support for 
workers – is when Labor proposed to help improve the governance of the 
regulation of the visa system to make sure Australians were getting looked 
after and not ripped off and exploited, they voted no,” Shorten said.

“The only reason they are trying to play catch up politics now is because they 
know Labor is right.”

But the prime minister said Shorten was completely hypocritical on the issue. 
“This is just a distraction on the part of Mr Shorten designed to cover up the 
divisions in theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> on the fundamental 
issue of national security and border protection,” Turnbull said.

“Mr Shorten should stop his hypocritical complaints about skilled migration 
and stand with the government in saying no to illegal migration, saying no to 
people smugglers.”
