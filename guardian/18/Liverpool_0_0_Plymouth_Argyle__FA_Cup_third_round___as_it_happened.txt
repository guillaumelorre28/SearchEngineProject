For Plymouth, a match of never-to-be-forgotten tedium is complete. They 
defended incessantly and immaculately, restrictingLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> to maybe one clear chance all 
match. Plymouth’s fans and players are celebrating like they’ve won the game of 
life, never mind the FA Cup; when you see these celebrations, you realise the 
end more than justifies the means. The book says Plymouth drew at Anfield, and 
it will say that forever. Congratulations to Plymouth. Thanks for your company, 
bye.

90+5 min Lucas sizes up a bouncing ball 35 yards from goal and lashes it a few 
yards wide. McCormick wasn’t worried.

90+4 min It’s dinked in by Alexander-Arnold, flicks off the head of Gomez and 
hits the unsighted Smith before ricocheting towards his own goal. Thankfully 
for him, McCormick is sufficiently alert to make a comfortable save.

90+1 min A replay is not ideal for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>, who already have an extremely

first half, we’re going back to Family Fortunes with Vernon Kay.’

85 min Jervis finds energy from somewhere, marauding down the right wing. He 
flips the ball one side of Stewart and runs round the other before driving a 
cross-cum-shot that drifts well wide of the far post. He had only had one man 
in support, Tanner I think, and the cross was nowhere near him. It was a great 
run though.

81 min Firmino stands a left-wing cross up for Sturridge, whose header loops 
onto the roof of the net. He was under pressure and couldn’t get a proper run 
at the ball, so it wasn’t much of a chance.

80 min Ojo’s deliberate curler is easily held by the plunging McCormick. 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have created 
surprisingly little in this game, especially when you consider they have had 
110 per cent of the possession.

78 min Plymouth almost sneak a goal on the break! Carey drove a pass to the 
halfway line to find the lively Tanner, who zipped away from the dithering 
Gomez. The last man Stewart came across to make a superb interception, without 
which Tanner would have had a clear run on goal.

74 min Gary Miller is in a lot of pain after landing awkwardly. He needs 
oxygen and is going to be stretchered off. While that is happening, Adam 
Lallana and Roberto Firmino replace Ben Woodburn and Ovie Ejaria. Woodburn 
didn’t do a lot, but the way in which he did it suggests he has a chance of 
being a top player, and maybe even a top, top one.

57 min Lucas comes forward and hits a fierce long-range shot that is well held 
by McCormick, high to his right. It was a save you’d expect him to make but he 
did so very confidently.

55 min A stupid foul from Alexander-Arnold gives Plymouth a shooting chance 
from 30 yards. Carey bends it nicely over the wall but it’s a comfortable save 
for Karius. That’s Plymouth’s first shot on target. They have been better since 
half-time.

54 min The excellent Woodburn dupes Miller on the left and crosses deep to 
Ojo, who heads well wide under pressure from Purrington. There was a slight 
appeal for handball but I don’t think there was anything in it.

“Eleven years without winning the FA Cup a long time in “Liverpool years’” 
quotes Sean Kilgannon. “They famously didn’t win it at all until 1965. Yes, I’m 
aLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> fan, so I am, of 
course, obsessed with history......I’ve even got an MA (Honours) in it.”

If we’re boasting, I’ve got a PhD in 

But yes, fair point, I should have said ‘a long time in post-Shankly Liverpool 
years’.

Half-time chit-chat

“I doubt Plymouth would regret parking the bus and losing 2-0,” says Rich 
Harland. “As a Reading fan I’d have taken that over watching us drive the bus 
around a bit at Old Trafford and being out of the FA cup after 15 minutes.”

“Not so fun fact - Plymouth is the largest city in England that has never had 
a team in the top division,” says Øyvind Røed. “At least according to a 
Norwegian newspaper’s Christmas quiz.”

“Blimey Rob, what a game to give up drinking for,” says Paul Sumner. “I am 
going to sponsor you, but exactly the same as if you gave up for a month (or 
even a day tbf, it is a good cause). Think of that in glorious summer evenings 
in the pub garden, or as the nights draw in ten months from now.”

(Thanks Paul!)

“ZigZags are limited edition KitKats,” says Daniel Friedman. “Instead of 
delicious parallel chocolate covered wafer straight lines, they are delicious 
parallel chocolate covered wafer crooked lines. PS no Twitter?”

(Maybe in 2018 when there is some drink to which it can drive me.)

37 min Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have had 86 
per cent of the possession, and 255 passes to Plymouth’s 21. Somewhere in the 
north west, Pep Guardiola’s knees are trembling. When Plymouth do put four 
passes together, they are accompanied by olés.

36 min For all the attacking they’ve done, Plymouth might as well be playing 
Carlos Kaiser up front. I shouldn’t be too critical - like Kylie said, you’ve 
got to put yourself in their place. But if they lose this 2-0, that 293-mile 
journey home will be accompanied by a few regrets.

33 min Good play from Ojo, who tricks the second left-back Slew to make some 
room in the box before hitting a low shot that is kicked behind for a corner by 
Bradley. Miller heads the corner just wide of his own goal.

Plymouth hold out against Klopp’s young Liverpool to earn FA Cup replay

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/08/liverpool-plymouth-argyle-fa-cup-match-report> 
For Plymouth, a match of never-to-be-forgotten tedium is complete. They 
defended incessantly and immaculately, restrictingLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> to maybe one clear chance all 
match. Plymouth’s fans and players are celebrating like they’ve won the game of 
life, never mind the FA Cup; when you see these celebrations, you realise the 
end more than justifies the means. The book says Plymouth drew at Anfield, and 
it will say that forever. Congratulations to Plymouth. Thanks for your company, 
bye.

Peep peep! 
 
90+5 min Lucas sizes up a bouncing ball 35 yards from goal and lashes it a few 
yards wide. McCormick wasn’t worried.
 
90+4 min It’s dinked in by Alexander-Arnold, flicks off the head of Gomez and 
hits the unsighted Smith before ricocheting towards his own goal. Thankfully 
for him, McCormick is sufficiently alert to make a comfortable save.
 
90+3 min Slew commits a needless foul on Ojo just outside the box on the 
right. Moreno and Alexander-Armstrong are over it...
 
90+1 min A replay is not ideal for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>, who already have an extremely 
busy month. They haven’t played well in the final third.
 
90 min There will be six minutes of additional ambience.
 
87 min Lallana fouls Carey 35 yards from goal. Plymouth look more positive 
than at any stage in the match. Fox wafts the free-kick into the box and
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> clear.
 
86 min “In Germany,” says Tim, “Eurosport have given up and switched to 
Chelsea v Peterborough...”

This is the future of sport on TV, incentivised exposure. ‘I don’t care if 
it’s the Champions League final, there hasn’t been a shot on target in the 
first half, we’re going back to Family Fortunes with Vernon Kay.’
 
85 min Jervis finds energy from somewhere, marauding down the right wing. He 
flips the ball one side of Stewart and runs round the other before driving a 
cross-cum-shot that drifts well wide of the far post. He had only had one man 
in support, Tanner I think, and the cross was nowhere near him. It was a great 
run though.
 Jervis gets a shot away. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA  
82 min Lallana’s inswinging cross skims off the head of the stooping Origi and 
goes well wide of the far post. He thought he was fouled by Purrington, but 
there wasn’t much it in.
 
81 min Firmino stands a left-wing cross up for Sturridge, whose header loops 
onto the roof of the net. He was under pressure and couldn’t get a proper run 
at the ball, so it wasn’t much of a chance.
 
80 min Ojo’s deliberate curler is easily held by the plunging McCormick. 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have created 
surprisingly little in this game, especially when you consider they have had 
110 per cent of the possession.
 
78 min Plymouth almost sneak a goal on the break! Carey drove a pass to the 
halfway line to find the lively Tanner, who zipped away from the dithering 
Gomez. The last man Stewart came across to make a superb interception, without 
which Tanner would have had a clear run on goal.

76 min Miller is replaced by Connor Smith. He doesn’t seem too bad as he is 
stretchered off, though it’s hard to know with these things.
 
74 min Gary Miller is in a lot of pain after landing awkwardly. He needs 
oxygen and is going to be stretchered off. While that is happening, Adam 
Lallana and Roberto Firmino replace Ben Woodburn and Ovie Ejaria. Woodburn 
didn’t do a lot, but the way in which he did it suggests he has a chance of 
being a top player, and maybe even a top, top one.

70 min “This match is so dull, I’m reading up on Plymouth’s sponsors--Ginsters 
of Cornwall,” says Rich McGahey. “Apparently (I’m a Yank) maker of wonderful 
pasties, and their Cornish pasty has geographically protected status from the 
EU. Will Brexit mean that world markets will be flooded with inauthentic 
Cornish pasties?”


Why else do you think I voted Remain?
 
69 min Sturridge has added considerable menace to the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> attack, and his dangerous 
through pass just evades the sliding Ojo in front of goal.
 Ojo comes close. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA  
68 min “Shall we sing a song for you?” chant the Plymouth fans, apparently 
oblivious to the fact that they are already doing so.
 
67 min The substitute Tanner goes on a lovely, fleet-footed run infield from 
the right, past Gomez and Lucas before his shot from the edge of the area is 
blocked by the recovering Gomez.
 
65 min A Plymouth substitution Paul Garita is replaced by Craig Tanner.
 
64 min And for his first trick, Sturridge sidefoots fractionally wide from 20 
yards. I think the keeper had it covered, but it was a decent statement of 
intent.
 Sturridge has a shot. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images  
63 min Liverpool’s domination has been on the infecund side of sterile, so 
here comes Daniel Sturridge. He replaces Emre Can.
 
62 min Moreno’s corner is headed towards goal by Lucas and blocked by Bradley. 
 
61 min Can’s long-range shot takes a double deflection and goes behind for a 
corner. There’s a delay before it is taken while Garita receives treatment.
 
59 min Daniel Sturridge is getting his kit off.
 
57 min Lucas comes forward and hits a fierce long-range shot that is well held 
by McCormick, high to his right. It was a save you’d expect him to make but he 
did so very confidently.
 
55 min A stupid foul from Alexander-Arnold gives Plymouth a shooting chance 
from 30 yards. Carey bends it nicely over the wall but it’s a comfortable save 
for Karius. That’s Plymouth’s first shot on target. They have been better since 
half-time.
 Carey takes the free-kick. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images  
54 min The excellent Woodburn dupes Miller on the left and crosses deep to 
Ojo, who heads well wide under pressure from Purrington. There was a slight 
appeal for handball but I don’t think there was anything in it.
 
53 min Liverpool have some big-hitters on the bench and you’d expect to see 
them soon because they are creating nothing against this excellent and 
plentiful Plymouth defence.
 
51 min Slew has Plymouth’s first shot of the match. It almost goes out for a 
throw-in, but it’s the thought that counts.
 
48 min Garita breaks down the left and then fouls Stewart. The referee, out of 
either boredom or sympathy, gives the free-kick to Plymouth. But then Carey 
wafts a poor cross straight into the loving embrace of theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> keeper Karius.
 Garita in and Stewart tangle. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters  
47 min “In Die Hard the character Argyle spent most of the 90 minutes parked 
up in his limo before bursting into life just before the end,” says Niall 
Mullen. “Not sure why I’m thinking about him.”
 
46 min Peep peep! Plymouth kick off, attacking from right to left.
 
“Eleven years without winning the FA Cup a long time in “Liverpool years’” 
quotes Sean Kilgannon. “They famously didn’t win it at all until 1965. Yes, I’m 
aLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> fan, so I am, of 
course, obsessed with history......I’ve even got an MA (Honours) in it.”

If we’re boasting, I’ve got a PhD in 

But yes, fair point, I should have said ‘a long time in post-Shankly Liverpool 
years’.
 
Half-time chit-chat

“I doubt Plymouth would regret parking the bus and losing 2-0,” says Rich 
Harland. “As a Reading fan I’d have taken that over watching us drive the bus 
around a bit at Old Trafford and being out of the FA cup after 15 minutes.”

“Not so fun fact - Plymouth is the largest city in England that has never had 
a team in the top division,” says Øyvind Røed. “At least according to a 
Norwegian newspaper’s Christmas quiz.”

“Blimey Rob, what a game to give up drinking for,” says Paul Sumner. “I am 
going to sponsor you, but exactly the same as if you gave up for a month (or 
even a day tbf, it is a good cause). Think of that in glorious summer evenings 
in the pub garden, or as the nights draw in ten months from now.”

(Thanks Paul!)

“ZigZags are limited edition KitKats,” says Daniel Friedman. “Instead of 
delicious parallel chocolate covered wafer straight lines, they are delicious 
parallel chocolate covered wafer crooked lines. PS no Twitter?”

(Maybe in 2018 when there is some drink to which it can drive me.)
 
He hasn’t misplaced a single pass, etc.
Richard Jolly (@RichJolly) 
One Plymouth player (Threlkeld) completed 0 passes in the first half. Two more 
(Garita & Jervis) completed 1 each.

Let us never speak of that 45 minutes again.
 Green Army, still in it. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images  
45+2 min Slew wins a free-kick on the left wing, almost by the corner flag. 
Plymouth have six men in the box ... and Carey’s cross is headed away.
 
45+1 min Moreno’s chipped cross is headed away to Ejaria, whose adroit volley 
ricochets around the box before Plymouth clear.
 
45 min In fairness to Plymouth, they have defended extremely well - so much so 
that McCormick has only had one real save to make. If they can cross the 
halfway line in the second half, anything could happen.
