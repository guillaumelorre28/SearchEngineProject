A planned strike by baggage handlers and check-in staff at 18 airports has 
been called off, the trade union representing them has announced.

Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/len-mccluskey>, took part in the talks 
and said that the unions had accepted a new and improved pay offer. “I am 
delighted to report that we have reached an agreement which our shop stewards 
will recommend to our members,” he said.

Members of Unite employed by Swissport

 were due to walk out from Friday for 48 hours, threatening disruption for 
those leaving the UK for Christmas. The baggage handlers and check-in staff had 
voted for industrial action in protest at a 4.65% pay rise offer over three 
years.

The airports affected would have included Gatwick, Heathrow, Manchester, 
Birmingham, Glasgow, East Midlands, Stansted and Belfast. Aberdeen, Bristol, 
Bournemouth, Cardiff, Doncaster, Edinburgh, Leeds/Bradford, Luton, Newcastle 
and Southampton could also have faced disruption. The strike was called off 
following talks at the conciliation service Acas.

Talks are continuing in an attempt to avert a separate strike by British 
Airways cabin crew

 but McCluskey said progress was “painfully slow”. BA crew are due to strike on 
Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a dispute over pay. The airline said it will 
run a full service despite the strike.

McCluskey appealed to senior management at BA to get involved in the talks, 
saying that a resolution is still possible. “I will make myself available 24 
hours a day to try to reach an agreement,” he said.
