The Isthmian League Premier Division side Merstham will host Oxford United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/oxford-united> in their debut appearance 
in the first round of the FA Cup. The seventh-tier club beat Ebbsfleet United 
in the final qualifying round and have been rewarded with a home tie against 
League One opponents.

The lowest-ranked side, Westfields of the Midland League Premier Division, 
will host the National League North side Curzon Ashton, who defeated York City 
in a replay after the draw was held.

“We are delighted we are at home, six home games on the bounce now this 
season,” the Westfields chief executive, Andy Morris, told the BBC. “I’m 
quietly confident with a home draw. Getting this far is a huge bonus – we have 
earned enough money so far to get us through this season and keep us going into 
next season.”
