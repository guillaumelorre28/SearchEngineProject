Today, there is almost nothing to be seen. But at the time of the Norman 
conquest,Dunwich <http://www.suffolktouristguide.com/Dunwich.asp>, on the 
Suffolk coast, was a thriving port, second only to London in terms of trade and 
importance. It was the capital of theKingdom of the East Angles 
<http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/EnglandEastAnglia.htm>, and 
boasted a rich and growing population. What could possibly go wrong?

Then, on the night of 1 January 1286, a huge storm surge swept in from the 
North Sea, flooding much of the town and destroying buildings, including 
several churches. The following year two further floods hit the town, in 
February and December. The port kept going, though trade was much reduced.

But gradually, over the decades that followed, more storms eroded even more of 
the coast: in 1328, when two priories were swept away; and in 1347, when 400 
houses and two more churches were destroyed.

By then the problem was that the shingle bank that had once protected the port 
had been swept into the harbour, preventing boats from entering and leaving. 
With the coming of the plague in the same year, Dunwich’s days of power were 
over. And in January 1362, the“Grote Mandrenke” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2011/jan/20/weatherwatch-grote-mandrenke> 
(Great Drowning) finally put paid to the town.

Today Dunwich is a small and picturesque village, with few obvious signs of 
its former fame. But local legend claims that on some nights, if you listen 
carefully, you may still hear the bells of those lost churches ringing from the 
deep.
