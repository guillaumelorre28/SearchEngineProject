Ralepelle, who plays for Toulouse <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/toulouse> 
in the French Top 14 competition, has previously tested positive for a banned 
substance, methylhexanamine, in 2010, although he was not banned on that 
occasion.

In a statement on World Rugby’s “Keep Rugby Clean” website 
<http://keeprugbyclean.worldrugby.org/?page=news&id=82>, World Rugby chief 
executive Brett Gosper said: “World Rugby operates a zero-tolerance policy on 
doping and players are responsible for any prohibited substance found in their 
body.

“Rugby is founded on fair play and the promotion of a level playing field for 
all players. This particular case illustrates the rigorous anti-doping 
programme World Rugby implements in conjunction with Wada, both in and out of 
competition.”

The 28-year-old front row played for South Africa 22 times between 2006 and 
2013. He signed for Toulouse in 2013 from the Bulls Super Rugby franchise.
