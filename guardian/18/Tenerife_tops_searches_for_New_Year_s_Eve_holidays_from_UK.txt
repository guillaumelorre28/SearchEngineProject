Nearly one in five people in the UK searching for a holiday break over the new 
year period eyed up a trip to the Canary Islands, according to data provided 
exclusively to the Guardian byTravelSupermarket 
<http://www.travelsupermarket.com>.

The figures also reveal that the largest island in the region, Tenerife, was 
considered more than any other world destination for a break on 31 December.

TravelSupermarket’s analysis is based on 14.5m searches made on the comparison 
website forholiday <https://www.travelsupermarket.com/en-gb/holidays/> and hotel
 <https://www.travelsupermarket.com/en-gb/hotels/> breaks between September and 
November. In total, 8.3% of searches were for Tenerife, while 5.5% went to 
second-placed New York City.

Tenerife’s fellow Canary isle Lanzarote took fourth place with 4% of traffic, 
while Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura were placed sixth and eighth respectively.

Top 10 by volume of search were:


 * Tenerife (8.3%) 
 * New York (5.5%) 
 * Amsterdam (4.2%) 
 * Lanzarote (4%) 
 * Dubai (4.3%) 
 * Gran Canaria (4.1%) 
 * Paris (2.8%) 
 * Fuerteventura (2.2%)

 * Cancún (1.9%)

 * Sal (1.7%) 
Bob Atkinson, a travel expert at TravelSupermarket, said: 

It is the iconic locations of Sydney Harbour bridge and New York’s Times 
Square that capture the headlines when it comes to New Year’s Eve celebrations. 
However, our data shows the Canary island of Tenerife is the favourite with 
Brits for taking a holiday at new year – and it’s easy to understand why. 
Winter sun pretty much guaranteed, great value for money due it being tax-free 
and the chance to party in the way that you want means no one is disappointed.

Who is taking a new year break?

The data just on holidays (with flights), rather than hotel-only breaks, shows 
couples dominating holiday travel, with 68.6% of all holiday queries by two 
adults intending to share a room.

Families, or groups that feature both grownups and children, were the second 
largest bloc, with 21.1%. The remaining searches were divvied up among groups 
of three or more adults (6.2%) and solo travellers (4.1%).


Tenerife proved popular among all travellers on holiday breaks, but the appeal 
of other locations was less broad. Disneyland Paris was the target of 8% of 
search traffic by people looking to book a family trip, but that dropped to 1% 
or less among adult-only groupings.

Amsterdam appears to be the first port of call for grownup new year 
excursions. One in 10 searches by groups of three or more adults were by those 
looking at holidays in the Dutch capital.

How far are people planning to travel?

Approximately 30.3% of holiday searches were by travellers looking to take a 
city break, with popular destinations including New York, Paris and Rome. Just 
under one in five searches (18.9%) were for long-haul trips to sunny locales 
such as Cancún or Cuba.

Traditional skiing destinations did not seem to be a mainstay, accounting for 
just 3.9% of searches. For those who did want to hit the slopes, the French 
Alps was the most popular choice followed by the Austrian Alps. The Pyrenean 
principality of Andorra came in third.

Just a hotel, please

TravelSupermarket.com also broke out the data on those searching for just 
hotel rooms rather than a package including a flight.
