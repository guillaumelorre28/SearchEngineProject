A severe typhoon is expected to hit the Philippines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/philippines> on Christmas Day, bringing 
strong winds, floods and storm surges to the disaster-prone country.

Typhoon Nock-Ten, called Typhoon Nina in the Philippines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/weather/philippines>, is forecast to strengthen 
into a category four typhoon before making landfall on Sunday, local time.

On Saturday morning, the typhoon was east of the Philippines, approaching it 
at about 20 km/hour <http://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/1626.html>. Sustained wind 
speeds near the centre were 180km/hour, with gusts as high as 250km/hour, 
making it a category three typhoon.

Some forecasts <http://tropic.ssec.wisc.edu/#> suggested it would strengthen 
to category four before making landfall. The predicted path was through the 
north of the country, over Manilla, although cities on the East of the country 
would be hit worse, including Naga in the Bicol Region.

In 2015, a United Nations report 
<http://www.unisdr.org/2015/docs/climatechange/COP21_WeatherDisastersReport_2015_FINAL.pdf>
 listed the Philippines as one of countries most affected by natural disasters. 
And Manilla has beennamed as particularly vulnerable

 to the impacts of climate change.

Typhoons and hurricanes draw their energy from the warmth of the water below, 
leading scientists toexpect them to intensify

 as global warming continues.

In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan smashed into the Philippines, killing at least 10,000 
people in that country alone. It was one the most deadly, and the strongest 
landfalling storm, ever recorded.

Typhoons are the same phenomena as cyclones and hurricanes. They are called 
“typhoons” when they develop in the western part of the North Pacific Ocean.
