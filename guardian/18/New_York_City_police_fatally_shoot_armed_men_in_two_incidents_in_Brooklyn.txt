In the first incident, police killed 63-year-old James Owens in the borough’s 
Canarsie neighborhood. Officers were responding to a report of an “emotionally 
disturbed person” on Tuesday evening when they found Owens in a house, 
according to the police account. Authorities said Owens grabbed a 13-inch knife 
and moved toward the officers. Police first shocked Owens with a stun gun 
before fatally shooting him.

About six hours later, police shot and killed a second man in Brooklyn’s 
Prospect Heights neighborhood. Police say the man was carrying a gun and firing 
shots into a lounge early Wednesday morning. According to authorities, the 
officers opened fire when the man turned toward them with the gun in his hand.

New York City police killed 12 people in all of 2016, according to The Counted
