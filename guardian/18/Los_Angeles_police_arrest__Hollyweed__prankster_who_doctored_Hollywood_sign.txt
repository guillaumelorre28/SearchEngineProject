The prankster was recorded by security cameras in the area changing the sign 
early on New Year’s Day.

Fernandez, an artist, had claimed credit for the stunt in a Vice magazine 
interview, but police had not previously confirmed his involvement.

He will be released on his own recognizance and must return to court on 15 
February. Neither Fernandez nor his attorney could be immediately reached for 
comment.

The Hollywood sign was erected in 1923 and originally said “Hollywoodland”, to 
advertise a new housing development in the hills above Los Angeles.


It has been altered to say “Hollyweed” before – in 1976, after the passage of 
a state law relaxing rules concerning marijuana.

The same prankster, Danny Finegood 
<http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/27/local/me-finegood27>, changed it to 
read “Ollywood” in 1987, in protest over positive treatment of Col Oliver 
North, the marine at the center of the Iran-Contra scandal.

He also made the sign read “Oil war” in 1990, in protest at the first Gulf 
war. Finegood died in 2007.
