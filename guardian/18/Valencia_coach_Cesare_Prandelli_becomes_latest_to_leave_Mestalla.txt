The former Italy coach Cesare Prandelli has resigned as manager of Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> after one win in eight league 
matches in charge, the La Liga club confirmed on Friday.

Prandelli, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/16/valencia-hand-cesare-prandelli-winning-la-liga-start-at-sporting-gijon>
 who was under contract until June 2018 with Valencia’s Chinese owners after 
joining the club in October to become their ninth coach since 2012, is 
negotiating the termination of his deal.

“Cesare Prandelli has communicated to Valencia Club de Fútbol his irrevocable 
decision to resign from his position as coach, as of Friday 30 December,” the 
club said in a statement. “‘Voro’ Gonzalez will take over in charge of the 
first-team squad.”

After a 2-1 win against Sporting Gijón in his first match in charge, Valencia 
have lost four and drawn three, languishing in 17th place in the La Liga 
standings with 12 points from 15 games, above the relegation zone only on goal 
difference.

The 59-year-old has now had two short stints at clubs since leaving Italy 
after the 2014 World Cup – his spell at Galatasaray lasted only 147 days.

In March, Gary Neville 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/30/gary-neville-leaves-valencia-immediate-effect>
 was sacked as Valencia coach less than four months after arriving at the 
Mestalla Stadium.
