After years of waiting (eight to be exact), Copenhagen finally got its missing 
link.Cykelslangen, or Cycle Snake, is an elevated orange bike lane, wriggling 
its way over the harbour, seamlessly connecting the highway and the harbour 
bridge. Up until now our only options consisted of pushing our bikes up and 
down steep stairs, or taking ridiculous detours, in a narrow space haphazardly 
shared with pedestrians.
Looking at it now, the solution seems so obvious: an elevated two-way bike 
lane at the first-floor level, leaving pedestrians on the ground, with the 
added benefit of a less stressful atmosphere. Even on our best behaviour, bad 
or insufficient city planning creates tension. But good design can relieve it, 
as is the case withCykelslangen.

 Crossing Copenhagen'sCykelslangen – video 
When you think about it, the concept of an elevated road is not even that 
far-fetched: we have been doing this for cars for decades. It is odd, even, 
that it took us this long to get one, considering its overwhelmingly positive 
reception.

It is one of those rare occurrences in Copenhagen where seemingly everyone is 
happy. Cars have not had to budge an inch, the lower level has been returned to 
pedestrians, and cyclists love it. Besides easing the transition from highway 
to bike bridge, it is a pure joy to ride. At 4m across, the Cycle Snake is wide 
enough for you to overtake acargo bike

, as it would have to be in Copenhagen, although I don’t see why anyone would 
want to rush this ride. Crossing the 220m of snake will take you less than a 
minute, at a comfortable pace, without stressing out your fellow cyclists. And 
riding over water while taking in the view is exhilarating.

Infrastructure works the same for cars and for bikes: if you build it, they 
will come. We are in an ongoing struggle for space in Copenhagen, with an 
unfair amount of it still reserved for cars, but every cycle bridge and bike 
lane is a win. And more bike bridges are on their way. Once you cross one, 
there is no going back: you start dreaming of more.

The bike is the Copenhagener's preferred method of transportation, creating 
pressure for more and better infrastructure. Fortunately, the city is picking 
up the pace, connecting the dots and thinking in continuous bike lanes. They 
call these safe corridors “super bikeways”, but really all they are is just 
road space for bikes. Elevated or not, no city should be without it.
