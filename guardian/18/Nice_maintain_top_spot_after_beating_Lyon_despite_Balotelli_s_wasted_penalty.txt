Nice <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nice> prevailed thanks to goals by 
Paul Baysse and Jean-Michael Seri, who found the back of the net either side of 
the interval.

Lyon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lyon>, who are fifth on 13 points, 
played more than two thirds of the game with 10 men after Nabil Fekir was shown 
a straight red card for a dangerous tackle on Baysse in the 28th minute. Baysse 
had opened the scoring in the fifth minute with a neat volley from inside the 
area.

The hosts, who started with Mario Balotelli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mario-balotelli> up front, doubled the 
tally with 14 minutes left when Seri fired home after Younes Belhanda’s shot 
bounced off a post into the way of the midfielder. Balotelli saw his penalty in 
the 81st minute saved but Nice hung on to stretch their lead.

Earlier Monaco wasted a one-goal lead as Toulouse fought back following Valere 
Germain’s fourth-minute opener. The hosts equalised through Oscar Trejo in the 
65th minute before Martin Braithwaite struck twice in the 84th and 87th minutes.

Toulouse are third on 17 points.

On Saturday the champions Paris Saint-Germain will move four points behind 
Nice if they beat Nancy.
