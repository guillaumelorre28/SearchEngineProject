Nicholas Cullinan, director of the NPG, said the gallery was delighted to be 
staging the show. “Up until now, Cézanne’s portraiture has received 
surprisingly little attention,” he said, “so we are thrilled to be able to 
bring together so many of his portraits for the first time to reveal arguably 
the most personal, and therefore most human, aspect of Cézanne’s art.”

It will include portraits that have never before been on display in the UK. 
For example, his arresting Self-Portrait in a Bowler Hat 1885-86, which hangs 
in a collection presented to Denmark by the brewers Carlsberg in the late 19th 
century in theNy Carlsberg Glyptotek gallery in Copenhagen 
<http://www.glyptoteket.dk/>.


Other works will include Boy in a Red Waistcoat, being lent by Washington, and 
Madame Cézanne in a Yellow Chair 
<http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/62371>, coming from the Art 
Institute of Chicago. Both will be shown in the UK for the first time since the 
1930s.

There will also be portraits from the 1860s of the artist’s Uncle Dominique, 
for which heused a brush and palette knife 
<https://www.nortonsimon.org/collections/browse_title.php?id=M.1968.31.P>, 
applying paint almost as if it were cement, and portraits made shortly before 
his death in 1906 ofhis gardener and odd-job man 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/cezanne-the-gardener-vallier-n04724> at 
Les Lauves, Aix-en-Provence, Vallier.

The show includes about a quarter of the 200 portraits Cézanne is known to 
have painted in his career. He painted 26 self-portraits and 29 portraits of 
his wife, Hortense Fiquet.


Cézanne is a hugely important figure in art history, influencing the art of 
Cubists, Fauvists and successive generations of avant-garde artists.

The exhibition will open in Paris first, running at the Musée d’Orsay from 13 
June-24 September 2017, before it goes to the NPG form 26 October-11 February 
2018, and finally the National Gallery of Art in Washington from 25 March-1 
July 2018.
