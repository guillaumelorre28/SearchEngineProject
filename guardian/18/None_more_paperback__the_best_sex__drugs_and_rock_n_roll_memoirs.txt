“I was a total asshole,” scrawls Sebastian Bach in his memoir 18 And Life On 
Skid Row <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/18-and-life-on-skid-row.html>. 
“Thinking back on it now disgusts me.” “Quite,” you mumble, as you survey a 
narrative wasteland strewn with bunched fists, cocaine, vodka, fellatio, singed 
pubic hair, denim shorts and exhaustive asininity. But suffer he, and we, must. 
Ever since the 2001 publication of The Dirt, Mötley Crüe’s bogglingly squalid 
backstage confessional, the unvarnished tell-all has been a rite of passage for 
the reflective ageing metaller, with life lessons dispensed against a backdrop 
of, as Bach attests, near-total assholery. So many of these memoirs are out 
there now that it’s not easy to tell where one pounding anecdotal buttock ends 
and the next begins. Here’s a guide to those that, inevitably, go up to 11...

 He is Ozzy. Photograph: Hachette 
The gist... Stupefied pensioner galumphs through tempestuous life story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/04/ozzy-osbourne-autobiography-review>
 in manner of concussed pantomime cow (back end).

Pages of... Drugged vicars. Machine-gunned chickens. The clap. Booze, bats, 
rehab, regrets and a bewildering preoccupation with fellow celebs’ toilets (“If 
you’re reading this, Roger Whittaker, sorry for wiping my arse on your shower 
curtain”). Dignitaries wince and ex-wives lunge for rolling pins as trad metal 
memoir becomes something closer to metal sitcom, with hapless Ozzy as the 
accidental maverick (gurns) in a world of breadheads and squares (rollerskates 
into duck pond).

Typical quote... “OZZY, ARE YOU PISSING IN MY FUCKING SINK?”

 David Lee Roth: Crazy From the Heat. Photograph: Penguin Random House 
The gist… Synapses melt and patience turns to fondue as Van Halen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/van-halen>’s original frontman “Diamond 
Dave” rampages through his metal past like an air horn in tights.

Pages of... Gnashing bravado. Crashing similes. The words “I’m a 
multimillionaire” repeated at intervals of 0.0003 paragraphs. Non-chronological 
score-settling, Partridgean proclamations of the “I’ve read Huckleberry Finn 
200 times” variety, and “lovemaking” (sic) so explosive it’s accompanied by car 
alarms and falling masonry, as well as some strange euphemisms (“We commenced 
delivering the groceries at 138 beats per minute”).

Typical quote... “She turned my shorts into grilled cheese.”

 Dave Mustaine: A Life In Metal. Photograph: Harper Collins 
The gist... Imperious Megadeth <https://www.theguardian.com/music/megadeth> 
poobah fires succession of pontifical edicts from the flaming trebuchet of his 
own ego.

Pages of... Heroin. Exorcisms. Beer. Third-person passive-aggression wreathed 
in guffclouds of self-righteousness (“When Dave Mustaine announces his 
conversion to Christianity, there’s no shortage of people eager to find 
hypocrisy in his decision”). Lemony musings re his early ejection from 
Metallica, brutal punch-ins with a conga-line of understandably miffed 
bandmates and, ultimately, Dave Mustaine’s Spiritual Awakening™.

Typical quote... “The first time I heard Lars Ulrich play drums, I was shocked 
at his mediocrity.”

 Alice Cooper, Golf Monster. Photograph: Penguin Random House 
The gist... Shock rock’s own Uncle Giggles plonks life story on a tiny wooden 
peg and – fore! – tees off for a memoir that whizzes effortlessly down the 
fairway (*removes sunglasses*) of common sense.

Pages of... Golf. Sobriety. Golf. Turtlenecks. Golf. Christ. 13.5-tog 
celebrity anecdotes: “Lou Reed asked me for help with his swing.” And ellipses 
so loaded with… profundity that you could drop a five iron in the gap that 
follows (“I’m a golf addict. But it didn’t used to be that way…”) and it would 
still take days to hit the bottom.

Typical quote... “Once again, Alice Cooper was ahead of his time.”

Slash

 Slash: The Autobiography. Photograph: Harper Collins 
The gist... Ambulant hard rock piñata is recast by co-writer Bozza as 
deep-thinkin’ – and surprisingly endearin’ – chronicler ofGuns N’ Roses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/gunsnroses>’ “pretty heavy scene”.

Pages of... Steeple-fingered self-analysis. Genital warts. Cardiomyopathy, 
homelessness, McRibs, boggling pharmaceutical adventurism (“I just ran fully 
naked and bleeding down the fairway”) and sex so incessant it’s like being shot 
in the face by a pump-action bum gun.

Typical quote... “I had no remorse whatsoever about my overdose, but I was 
pissed off at myself for havingdied 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jul/09/velvetrevolver.gunsnroses>.”

18 And Life On Skid Row by Sebastian Bach (Dey Street Books) is published on
