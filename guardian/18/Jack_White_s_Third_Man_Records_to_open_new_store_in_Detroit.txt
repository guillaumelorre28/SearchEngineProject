Jack White <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jack-white> has announced plans 
to open a new branch of his Third Man Records store in his home town of 
Detroit. The new retail and office space is the result of a partnership with 
Shinola, a local watch and high-end goods manufacturer.


The store, which is set to open on 27 November, also known as “Black Friday”, 
will be located in the Cass Corridor neighborhood of Detroit, where the White 
Stripes performed their first ever show. White, who went to school in the area, 
said: “[Cass Corridor is] the most inspiring area of Detroit for me as an 
artist and as a Detroiter. From the great visual artists like Gordon Newton to 
the music of the Gories, and the birth of the Detroit garage rock scene, the 
Corridor has nurtured Detroit’s soul and inventiveness for decades.”


He added: “That spirit pushes forward with Shinola’s passion and will come 
full circle for the artists of the Corridor that work with Third Man Records to 
plant a new foundation there to help keep that creative spirit alive for 
decades to come.”


Shinola, which makes bikes and leather goods, along with headphones, speakers 
and record players, seems like a good fit for White’s store, as it has played a 
key role in bringing manufacturing jobs back to Detroit. The city filed for 
bankruptcy in 2013 but has since undergone an impressive recovery.

Third Man was originally founded in Detroit in 2001, but the label has 
operated out of its Nashville base since 2009.

White was recently in the news following an interview he gave to the Third Man 
website in which he claimed former White Stripes drummer Meg White no longer 
picks up the phone to him. The site was forced to put out a statement to say 
the quotes had been sensationalised by news sites.
