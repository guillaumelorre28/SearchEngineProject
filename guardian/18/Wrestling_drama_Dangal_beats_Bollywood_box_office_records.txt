Khan, 51, plays their father and coach, Mahavir Singh Phogat, who had hoped 
for sons he could turn into world-class grapplers, but sees the promise in his 
young daughters after they thrash two local boys who insult them.

alternative for young women in the village: an early marriage and a lifetime of 
child-rearing and domestic labour.

“It’s a marvellous thing that it has done so well because it’s not a 
traditional Bollywood film,” said Anupama Chopra, a film critic and author of 
several books on the industry.


“There’s no love story and its about very strong women. There are no gorgeous 
young people romancing each other in Switzerland. The only traditionally 
sellable element is Aamir Khan, and he plays a much, older overweight man – and 
yet it becomes the biggest hit in Indian cinema.”

She said the film’s success “tells you that audiences have evolved, and not 
just in the urban centres”.

“It gives a sense of how viewers are feeling about the difficult conversation 
that’s being had about women inIndia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> 
in recent years,” Chopra said.

It also reflected Khan’s storytelling instincts: “He has the best gut in the 
business,” she said.

For some scenes in Dangal his gut was also the largest: Khan put on nearly 
30kg (4 st 7lbs) for the part, which he quickly had to lose to play a younger 
version of the character in flashback scenes.

Tickets for Dangal were made tax-free in four states as part of the Beti 
Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign, which aims to reduce female infanticide.

The gender disparity is worst in Haryana, where 830 girls are born for every 
1,000 boys.

The film has kicked off a debate among Indians 
<http://feminisminindia.com/2016/12/26/dangal-feminist-film-review/> about its 
feminist credentials, many lauding the celebration of women in a male-dominated 
sport, others questioning why the sisters’ father is the focus of the story.

“The script erases the girls and constantly credits [Mahavir Phogat] for 
braving the taunts of conservative neighbours,” a review in the Hindustan Times 
said.


“This is unfortunate because in reality, the young women would likely have 
been the target of a bulk of the disparaging comments and could only have 
carried on with extreme courage.”

It is the second Bollywood film to tackle feminist themes after September’s 
Pink, a courtroom drama that examines India’s attitudes towards consent and the 
growing freedom of Indian women to dress, work and live as they choose.

Dangal was released on 23 December and was India’s second hit wrestling film 
of 2016. Sultan, starring Salman Khan, was released in July and made 3.15bn 
rupees, sitting third on the all-time grossing list.

The Phogat sisters’ success paved the way for other Indian athletes including 
Sakshi Malik, another wrestler from Haryana who won a bronze model at last 
year’s Rio Olympics – India’s first Olympic medal in the sport.

The two sisters are still wrestling, forming part of a team called UP Dangal 
in India’s pro-wrestling League. Babita is out of the competition with an 
injury, but Geeta was on Monday declared fit for the next match against NCR 
Punjab Royals on Tuesday.
