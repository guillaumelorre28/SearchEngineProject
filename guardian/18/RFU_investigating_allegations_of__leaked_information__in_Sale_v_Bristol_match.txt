Sale have made a complaint to the Rugby Football Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugby-football-union> after information was 
allegedly leaked to opponents Bristol earlier this month.

Bristol fought back from 15-0 down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/01/premiership-roundup-sale-bristol-worcester-harlequins>
 to win the Aviva Premiership encounter 24-23 at the AJ Bell Stadium on New 
Year’s Day.

A spokesman for the RFU confirmed that the governing body was investigating 
the accusation, but no other details were given.

The spokesman said: “The RFU are investigating a complaint made by Sale Sharks 
in relation to the passing of information to the opposition team ahead of the 
match againstBristol <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bristolrugby> earlier 
this month.”

Sale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/salesharks> are next in action when 
they host the Scarlets in their final European Champions Cup group game on 
Saturday.

Bristol – who are bottom of the Premiership, seven points adrift of 
10th-placed Sale – welcome Cardiff Blues in the European Challenge Cup this 
weekend.
