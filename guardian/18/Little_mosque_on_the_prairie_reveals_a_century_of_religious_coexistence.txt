Sitting in her white pickup truck at the gates of the Muslim cemetery in Ross, 
North Dakota <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/north-dakota>, Lila 
Thorlaksen had a simple answer to a question about those who fuel the growing 
anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States.

“That’s their problem,” she answered matter-of-factly.

Word of the Islamophobia that continues to swirl around the US and world 
doesn’t reach very far into the lands that are home to one of North America’s 
earliest Muslim communities, where lifelong residents like Thorlaksen say there 
have never been problems and pay little attention to the rhetoric that suggests 
otherwise.

Ross’s original mosque was torn down in the 1970s due to its deteriorating 
condition. Thorlaksen’s mother funded the construction of a small masjid that 
was built on the piece of land in the mid-2000s. There it stands today – with 
its small dome poking up over the vast expanse of grassland and pasture, oil 
wells bobbing in the distance – a memorial to this unique chapter of Islam’s 
American story that will live on long after the residents who remember the 
original mosque pass on.

“It’s not used much,” Thorlaksen said, looking out of her truck window at the 
small mosque as the wind howls. She was raised Muslim two miles up the road 
from the mosque, but became Christian when she got married. “But it’s there if 
it needs to be.”

The number of practicing Muslims in or around Ross – population 109 – is small 
today, and those who remain would be over 80 years-old, at least. However, the 
descendants of North Dakota’s Muslim homesteaders, many of whom are now 
Christian, are keeping their forefathers’ memory and tradition of coexistence 
alive by maintaining and visiting this small cemetery and mosque in the heart 
of the Scandinavian-dominated northern plains.

Islam’s roots in north-west North Dakota, while few in number, run deep. 
Family names like Omar, Juma, Abdallah and Hassen are woven into the fabric of 
this region, today the center of North Dakota’s oil boom. Ross’s Muslim sons 
went off to fight for the United States in the first world war and other 
conflicts. During the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, townspeople would congregate in 
their rural masjid – locally called the Mohammadan church – to pray for rain.

Thorlaksen’s father was among the 2,000 or so Lebanese immigrants who came to 
North Dakota near the turn of the 20th century. In the 1920s, after spending 
decades praying in community members’ basements, they built a half-basement 
mosque on this piece of land in rural Mountrail County – one of the first 
masjids to be built in North America.

“It was part of my upbringing,” said Emmett Omar, an engineer now living in 
Washington state, but who was raised in Ross and remembers visiting the mosque 
as a child. “Every community has their little temple, or church, or mosque. And 
that was ours.”

“It was in such poor shape when I was growing up,” said Betty Abdallah, who 
now lives in Colorado but who grew up on a farm near Ross. “We’d go out and 
clean the cemetery, but [the mosque] was in such poor shape that we weren’t 
really allowed to go in. I never actually was inside the old structure.”

As the generations went on, Ross’s Muslim children often married their 
Christian neighbors.Islam <https://www.theguardian.com/world/islam> slowly 
faded among the new generations.

“One of the memories that really sticks out,” Abdallah said with a laugh, “and 
I make jokes about it – is prior to butchering and hunting, [my dad] would go 
through his ritual of cleaning and praying. And do you know how long it takes 
to butcher 50 chickens when you have to say a prayer for every chicken?”

“It was beautiful to listen to him pray and talk about his beliefs,” she 
added. “He was just a cool dad. He didn’t care that I went to a Lutheran 
church, or that another sister went to a Catholic church.”

The mosque that sits on the piece of land today has a small prayer rug in the 
center of the cement floor, pointed east towards Mecca. There is a frame of 
pictures of Ross’s Muslims – the parents and grandparents of today’s Ross 
diaspora.

“That made my father very proud,” Abdallah said about the new mosque. “It was 
something he could look at. If he chose, he could go out there and pray.”

“It’s significant to the people that grew up there,” Omar said. “It was part 
of their life.”

“From my upbringing, the Muslim faith isn’t unkind,” Abdallah said, when asked 
about her reaction to hearing anti-Muslim sentiment in mainstream American 
politics and media. “It makes me sad, for the stupidity. It’s not Muslims that 
are unsafe. It’s ‘radical’. And you can be a radical Christian. You can be a 
radical Jehovah’s Witness. It’s just the word ‘radical’.”

“There’s a lot of hatred being spewed forth by a segment of Americans,” Omar 
said. “And that’s not an indictment on all Americans. It’s just an indictment 
of those that follow the likes of the Donald Trumps, and people like that.”
