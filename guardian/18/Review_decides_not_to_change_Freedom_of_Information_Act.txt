A government announcement that there will be “no legal changes” to the Freedom 
of Information legislation following a review of the act was being cautiously 
welcomed by campaigners on Monday.

The report of a commission established in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/17/ministers-to-review-freedom-of-information-act>
 by Matthew Hancock, Cabinet Office minister, to examine whether the Freedom of 
Information (FoI) Act 2000 is too expensive and intrusive is to be published on 
Tuesday.

Pledging to encourage transparency in the public sector, Hancock said on the 
eve of publication: “After 10 years we took the decision to review the Freedom 
of Information Act and we have found it is working well.

“We will not make any legal changes to FoI. We will spread transparency 
throughout public services, making sure all public bodies routinely publish 
details of senior pay and perks. After all, taxpayers should know if their 
money is funding a company car or a big pay off.”

The five-member committee, which has been described by campaigners 
<https://www.cfoi.org.uk/campaigns/stop-foi-restrictions/> as an “establishment 
stitch-up”, includes the former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw, who is 
already on the record calling for the act to be rewritten.

Also on the panel is former Conservative party leader Michael Howard, whose 
gardening expenses were criticised after being exposed by FoI requests, and 
Dame Patricia Hodgson, the deputy chair of Ofcom, which has criticised the act 
for its “chilling effect” on government.

The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tim-farron>, has been among those who 
called for the commission be disbanded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/30/tim-farron-calls-for-breakup-of-freedom-of-information-review>
, describing the stance of his party’s own peer, Lord Carlile, and others on it 
as one-sided.

Reacting on Monday night to the Cabinet Office statement that there would be 
be no legal changes to the act, the director of the Campaign for Freedom of 
Information said the words used suggested that it was less likely that the 
statutory changes campaigners and others had feared were on the way.

“The most substantial changes [that] had been floated would require 
legislation. But it could be that they are now possibly talking about various 
forms of guidance,” added Maurice Frankel, director of the campaign, which 
works for the strengthening of the FOI act and advises the public on their 
right to information.

Hands off the FoI act: information is a vital tool of democracy

“What has been notable has been the universal criticism from the all corners 
of the press. No signifiicant newspaper or even individual commentator, as far 
as I am aware, has said: ‘Let’s face it the FoI act has gone too far’.”


FoI campaigners have been concerned that the commission could recommend 
introducing a charge for freedom of information requests or tightening the 
rules on how much a request can cost.

The commission has been consulting on three central changes: charging for the 
requests, making it easier to refuse requests on cost grounds and giving 
ministers more powers to veto disclosures so that Whitehall has a safe place 
where civil servants and ministers can devise policy out of the public eye.

Giving more veto powers and increasing or introducing new charges would 
require statutory legislation, according to experts.

Under current freedom of information law anyone can ask for information as 
long as finding it does not cost a government department more than £600 or 
another public body £450.
