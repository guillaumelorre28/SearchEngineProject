What I choose to remember about 2016: Adele at Glastonbury. The wonderful 
Billie Piper in Yerma at the Young Vic.Angela Merkel

compassion and allowing one million human beings into Germany. And who could 
forget Ed Balls dancing and making us laugh in a truly horrible time.

• Percentage of anglophone titles recommended by Guardian readers (Review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/31/readers-books-of-the-year-2016>, 
31 December): 95%. In translation: 5%. Percentage in other languages: 0%. Looks

smacks a little of mere petulance at being excluded.
