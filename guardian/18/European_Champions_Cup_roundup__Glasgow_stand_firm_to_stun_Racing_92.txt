Gregor Townsend hailed Glasgow’s heroic defensive effort after a famous 23-14 
win atRacing 92. Townsend’s side claimed only their third win on French soil to 
give their hopes of qualifying from the pool stage of the European Champions 
Cup a huge boost.

Tries from Alex Dunbar and Ali Price put Glasgow on the road to victory a year 
on from a defeat in Paris that all but ended their European hopes.

The Argentina wing Juan Imhoff put Racing ahead in the opening exchanges 
before Dan Carter scored late, but it was not enough to lift them off the foot 
of Pool One before next week’s return fixture at Scotstoun.

“It was great seeing the players going out there and performing,” Townsend 
said. “We missed that opportunity last year with a couple of errors that they 
capitalised on but today we looked after the ball really well and took our 
chances especially in the first half.

“We were outstanding in defence, not only in general but in our lineout 
defence where they are really strong.”

Rory Best and Paddy Jackson shone as Ulster kept their qualification hopes 
alive by inflicting a 39-32 defeat onClermont Auvergne.

The returning Ireland duo inspired Ulster to edge a nine‑try match at Kingspan 
Stadium against the Top 14 leaders with Jackson scoring 19 of his side’s points.

Ulster led 22-18 after a dramatic first half during which the lead changed 
several times. The home side stretched that to 39-18 just before the hour.
