More than a million Brazilians have joined anti-government rallies across the 
country, ramping up the pressure on embattled presidentDilma Rousseff

 in Brazil’s history, the Workers party leader was given another reason to 
doubt she will complete her four-year term.

The demonstrations on Sunday – which reached all 26 states and the federal 
district – were expected to be bigger than similar rallies last year. The 
largest took place in São Paulo, where the polling company Datafolha estimated 
the crowd at 450,000, more than double the number it registered last year.

Organisers, police and local media calculated far greater numbers. According 
to police sources cited byGlobo 
<http://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/protestos-contra-dilma-reunem-36-milhoes-em-todos-os-estados-18865889>
, 3.5 million people took part nationwide in 326 cites, including 100,000 in 
Brasilia and 70,000 in Curitiba. The exact figures are contested, but 
undeniably huge.



In Rio de Janeiro, dense crowds stretched along the beachfront from Copacabana 
to Leme, and organisers estimated there were as many as a million participants. 
Police had yet to provide figures, but it looked likely to exceed 100,000.

Many protesters wore the canary yellow shirts of the national football team, 
or draped themselves in the national flag. Others carried banners expressing 
anger at bribery scandals and economic woes.

Parents brought children, and some families wore matching “impeachment now” 
T-shirts. Neighbours travelled on public buses, chanting anti-Rousseff slogans.

“She’s a horror,” said Paulo Rodriguez, a 53-year-old businessman who came 
with his wife and daughter. “The Workers party is a horror. They’re a criminal 
organisation that is robbing state resources. They are destroying our country.”

Rodriguez’s primary frustration was with the economy. Sales at his crepe 
business were down 30% to 40% compared to last year, he said. Even though he 
believed opposition politicians were as crooked as those in government, he felt 
a change was needed.

“If Dilma goes, the currency will get stronger and confidence will return and 
people will start spending again,” he said.

Brazil rallies call for president Rousseff’s impeachment - video

Worryingly for Rousseff, some of the major protests were in former Workers 
Party strongholds in the north-east.

In Rio, the crowd was predominantly white, middle class and predisposed to 
supporting the opposition. Several of the more prominent figures who spoke from 
sound trucks had rightwing backgrounds.

Among them was Marcelo Itagiba, the city’s former state security secretary and 
ex-federal police superintendent, who has been investigated for ties with 
militias and was one of the inspirations forthe gritty film Elite Squad 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/11/elite-squad-the-enemy-within-review>
.

Now a congressman with the opposition Brazilian Social Democratic party, he 
led chants of “Fora Dilma!” (“Dilma Out!”) from the top of a sound truck, and 
tried to shout down a critic by labeling him “Petista” (a Workers party 
supporter).

But compared to last year, the extreme right was less in evidence in 
Copacabana. The crowd also appeared more diverse.

“It’s not just the rich. Everyone is suffering,” said house cleaner Claudia 
Brasilina, who had travelled almost an hour to get to the protest from her home 
in the poor suburb of São Cristovão. “Dilma is ruining the country. She has to 
go.”

Like many of the demonstrators, she put her hopes not in the opposition but in 
the judiciary, particularly judge Sergio Moro, who has presided over the Lava 
Jato investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/04/brazil-police-raid-home-former-president-lula-petrobas>
 into the kickbacks and bribes associated with Petrobras, the state-run oil 
company.

That case has spread to involve dozens of other companies and senior 
politicians from almost all of the major parties. A popular chant on Sunday was 
“Viva o Sérgio Moro! Viva a Lava Jato!”

Rousseff has not been implicated, but several close aides are either in prison 
or under investigation. For the protesters, she is tainted by association.

“At the very least, she is guilty of incompetence and arrogance,” read one 
placard. “Dilma: Institutionalising Corruption 2010-2016” said another. Many 
others called for her to be impeached.

Congress is debating whether the president should be removed on a separate 
allegation, of window-dressing government accounts ahead of the election in 
2014. The legal basis for this challenge is weak, however, and the man leading 
the charge,speaker Eduardo Cunha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/brazil-eduardo-cunha-perjury-investigation-swiss-bank-account>
, is himself under investigation for bribery.

But the political winds are blowing hard against the president. The biggest 
party in her coalition has said it will decide within 30 days whether to quit 
the government coalition.

Later this week, Rousseff supporters will stage a rally against what they see 
as a judicial coup, but allies are becoming harder to find.

Several protesters on Sunday said they had previously voted for the Workers 
Party, which came to power in 2002 with a promise to clean up Brazilian 
politics. The economic downturn and corruption scandals have turned many former 
supporters away.

“I voted for Lula, but now I think he is a thief,” said systems analyst 
Barbara Santos, referring toan ongoing investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/brazilian-prosecutors-fresh-move-to-detain-former-president-lula>
 into claims that the former president received illicit benefits from 
construction companies.

“People are angry. We’ve had it up to here. Dilma needs to fall so we can have 
a new government. Right now all we have is drift. It’s hopeless.”
