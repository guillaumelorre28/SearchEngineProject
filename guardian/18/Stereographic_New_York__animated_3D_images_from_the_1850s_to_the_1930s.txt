The stereoscope provided 19th-century viewers with the illusion of 3D depth, 
in much the same way as the virtual reality headsets of today. In the 
pre-television, pre-movie days, families would gather round the stereoscope 
instead.

Stereoscopic photography uses the binocularity of human vision to recreate the 
illusion of depth. Our eyes are set slightly apart, meaning each eye sees the 
world from a different angle. Our brains combine these two images into one, 
giving us spatial depth.

The stereoscope allowed viewers to see a pair of two-dimensional images taken 
from slight different angles – one for the right eye, one for the left. Viewed 
through a stereoscope, the brain combines the two offset photographs into one, 
giving the impression of a 3D image.

Wiggle stereoscopy 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiggle_stereoscopy#Wiggle_stereoscopy%0A> is a 
technique which combines the two stereographic images into one animated GIF.

“Between the 1850s and the 1910s, stereographic images were a mainstay of home 
entertainment, perhaps second only to reading as a personal leisure activity,” 
says the NYPL. “Like television, stereos were an intimate medium viewed by 
individuals or small groups at home, or at churches, schools or clubs”

1850 and 1930.

Stereoscopes varied from small handheld devices for viewing single images to 
large pieces of furniture that could display a changing series of 50 or more 
views.

“The makers of stereos were equally diverse,” says the NYPL. “Into the 1880s, 
they ranged from eager amateurs photographing family scenes for private 
distribution to the famed camera artists of the day who demanded high-quality 
publishing and distribution and got it. By the 1890s, stereo photographers 
tended to be skilled and enterprising professionals who either sold their 
images to large commercial producers or worked anonymously under contract to 
them.”

end for stereoscopy in the 1930s.
