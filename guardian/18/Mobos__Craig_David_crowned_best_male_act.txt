Craig David <https://www.theguardian.com/music/craig-david>, the poster boy of 
UK garage and R&B, has capped a huge comeback year by winning best male act at 
the 2016 Mobo awards, as organisers faced embarrassment after an award was 
given to the wrong group.

Mobo producers apologised after the award for best song was mistakenly given 
to R&B group WSTRN. Hosts Rickie Williams and Melvin Odoom were forced take to 
the stage an hour later to announce that “someone picked up the wrong envelope” 
and that the winner should have been MC Abra Cadabra for Robbery, featuring 
Krept & Konan. WSTRN were later awarded a Mobo for best newcomer.


Organisers blamed the mix-up on a “production error”.

David staved off competition from the likes of Skepta, Stormzy, Kano and Tinie 
Tempah for his first Mobo since 2001. That year he won in three categories 
following the release of his debut album Born To Do It, which featured hits 
such as 7 Days and Fill Me In.


The performer subsequently relocated to Miami to work as a DJ and songwriter, 
but his newest and sixth album, Following My Intuition, last month claimed him 
a UK No 1 spot for the first time in 16 years.

David, who performed at Friday night’s Mobo awards ceremony at Glasgow’s SSE 
Hydro alongside acts such as Wiley, Professor Green and Clean Bandit, can add 
his ninth Mobo victory to three Ivor Novellos and 12 Brit awards.

In the 15 years since his debut, David released four albums but none achieved 
the success of his original. For a long time the artist was also blighted by 
Leigh Francis’s Bo’ Selecta! parody of him, which he has admitted was 
detrimental to his status in the music industry. But when he finally appeared 
on 1Xtra last year,ad-libbing Fill Me In over Skrillex and Diplo’s beat for 
Where Are U Now? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYu8HgWJ9QU>, he became an 
internet sensation for all the right reasons, and has since performed withMajor 
Lazer at Alexandra Palace <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZlw_pOab9s>, and at 
Fabric, Ibiza Rocks and Glastonbury.

It was a disappointing year at the Mobos for Skepta, however, who had eyes 
pinned on himafter he triumphed at the Mercury Prize with his album Konnichiwa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/15/mercury-prize-2016-goes-to-skeptas-konnichiwa>
, beating acts such as Radiohead, David Bowie and the 1975. Skepta lost in all 
three Mobo categories he was nominated in, including best male act, best grime 
act, and best album. In the latter category, it was his fellow grime MC Kano 
who was victorious withMade in the Manor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/10/kano-made-in-the-manor-review-grime-mainstay-finds-a-reflective-maturity>
, his first LP in six years, which peaked at No 8 in the UK charts and earned 
him four Mobo nominations this year.

Founded in 1996, the Mobo (Music of Black Origin) awards celebrate the 
creation and performance of black music. They have been the subject of 
criticism in previous years for rewarding the work of white, mainstream pop 
artists such as Sam Smith and Jessie J. For the second year running, the 2016 
nominations were a nod to grime in a mark of growing mainstream acknowledgement 
of the genre, which was developed in east London in the early 2000s and has its 
roots in UK garage and jungle.

Grime <https://www.theguardian.com/music/grime> artist Lady Leshurr beat Laura 
Mvula, Katy B, and Nao to win the best female act category. It was the second 
Mobo nomination for the 27-year-old, who is working on her debut album. The 
rapper Chip also won in the best grime act category, which was introduced by 
the Mobos in 2014.

The wins come after the BBC Radio 1 boss, Chris Price, predicted this year 
that grime would be the UK’s next “big cultural export”.In an interview with 
the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/12/bbc-radio-1-music-boss-grime-britain-chris-price-1xtra>
, he said it felt “like international eyes are on the genre”.

As evidence, Stormzy’s freestyle single Shut Up beat The X Factor winner 
Louisa Johnson to the No 1 spot in the UK singles chart last December. This 
summer, grime collective Boy Better Know – which includes Skepta – headlined 
London’s Wireless festival, and last month Dizzee Rascal performed his seminal 
2003 grime album Boy in Da Corner in its entirety at a special show in London.

 “It feels like a second chance – doing it the right way,” Kano has said of 
grime’s resurgence. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/25/kano-grime-battle-culture-mc-new-album-made-in-the-manor>
 “We don’t want to make it to a mainstream audience by doing just anything. 
Let’s not hide the fact we’re British, when in the past we have, with American 
accents.”

Michael Kiwanuka, whose soul-infused album Love & Hate 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMZ4QL0orw0> was also nominated in the best 
album category, also said this year felt like“a good moment for black music 
being recognised in the mainstream” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/21/skepta-kano-mobo-award-nominataions-laura-mvula>
 and pointed to the popularity of grime, not just in the UK mainstream but 
across the world.

“You can’t really escape it,” Kiwanuka said. “Up until now, grime has been 
pushed to one side and not seen as relevant. It’s always been credible but 
people are finally sitting up and taking notice. So it’s a good year, I think, 
and good to be a part of it.”

Other winners at this year’s Mobos <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mobos> 
include rising star Nadia Rose, whose music video Skwod won in the best video 
category; Drake, who won best international act; and Section Boyz, who won best
