Jack White is aiming to set a Guinness world record with the first single from 
hisforthcoming solo album 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/02/jack-white-lazaretto-solo-album-high-ball-stepper>
. The former White Stripe plans to produce "the world's fastest-released 
record" by recording and releasing Lazaretto's title track on the same day.


On international record store day on 19 April, White will take to the stage at 
his Third Man headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee, performing the song 
Lazaretto and recording it straight to acetate. Assistants will then rush the 
master tapes to United Record Pressing, 2kms away; technicians will immediately 
begin pressing 45s, using photographs from the concert for the records' sleeves.


As soon as they're finished, these limited-edition 7-inch records will go back 
to Third Man. The singles will reportedly be offered for purchase, in person 
only, for as long as buyers are still lining up, or at least until midnight. 
White will include a live recording of Lazaretto on his subsequent album.


In order to attend White's record-setting, record-making gig, fans must be 
paid "platinum members" of Third Man's Vault subscription service. As well as 
watching White's solo performance, concertgoers will attend a set by 
garage-rockers Whirlwind Heat. It will be the band's first show in eight years.

It may not be good news for Vollgas Kompanie, a Swiss polka trio who currently 
hold the Guinness record for thefastest album release
