Captains are expected to get everybody else off a sinking ship 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_captain_goes_down_with_the_ship> before 
worrying about themselves. But the code of nautical chivalry does not require 
civilian skippers to steer their way into gunfire to save vulnerable lives, as 
the man in charge of one Tunisian boat off Sousse did on Friday.

Nor is the captain’s code normally assumed to extend to hoteliers. But as 
tourists fled Seifeddine Rezgui’s bullets, they found staff “running towards 
the beach

 when we were running away”. Local medics, too, displayed extraordinary 
bravery, with ambulances sent in to the site of the massacre before the police 
had arrived to stop it.

Tunisia’s prosperity is now threatened, because of the shadow one madman has 
cast across its reputation as a holiday paradise. The terrorists’ version of 
Islam is a twisted distortion. Real Islam stresses hospitality. Tunisians have 
shown what that looks like when it is fortified with courage.
