This tune means all things to all people: it transcends fads, the underground, 
overground, wombling free debate and reunites moody or disparate dancefloors 
simply by using an international peace-keeping bassline.

The track that currently gets the most rewinds 
Kryder & The Cube Guys: You & Me

Who would have thought two well-chosen notes from Gary Numan’s Are ‘Friends’ 
Electric? could cause such spontaneous euphoria all these years later? When I 
heard this first at home on my laptop speakers I thought: this is either genius 
or bollocks. It got its first airing at a party I played that night in the 
Dalston branch of Oxfam and I immediately knew it was the former.

The track that got me out of bed this morning 
The Beatles: I Want You (She’s So Heavy) (Isolated bass version)

I would like to point out that I do not normally listen to bass-appellas but I 
happened upon this a few years back and, as a bassist myself, to hear the 
genius of Paul McCartney’s performance sends shivers down my spine.

The track I wish I’d never played 
The Gourds: Gin And Juice

I was doing really well at a festival in Sweden, I think, and wanted to finish 
with a flourish. For some reason I thought the Gourds’ hillbilly Gin And Juice 
would go down as well as it had the previous weekend at an afterparty at my 
house – spontaneous square dancing, hillbilly Snoop impressions, etc. Sadly, it 
went down like a turd in a swimming pool and I backed off stage with my tail 
between my legs.

The ideal festival track 
John Paul Young: Love Is In The Air

I have witnessed religious moments when this is dropped at the right time. I 
first witnessed it one Sunday teatime at Glastonbury when Zoe and I were four 
days in and didn’t think we could get any higher. Rob da Bank played it as his 
last tune and we all right royally lost our shit

The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with 
Dino Lenny & Doorly: Magic Room (Luke Solomon Remix)
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrHFd44USNDQ&picture=>

The mood and sentiments of the vocal along with the teasing nature of Luke’s 
filtered loops is the perfect foreplay to a long building set. If you only have 
a 45 minutes at a cheesy EDM festival then you’ll need to skip this and go for 
early penetration.

The track I wish I’d signed to my label
Kideko & George Kwali: Crank It

<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DU61Mye7h3bA&picture=>

Aside from it being one of the grooviest records of the year, aside from 
finding out latterly that this duo live just up the road in Brighton and 
George’s dad is one of my old mates from when I first started DJing 35 years 
ago… Aside from both these things I would want it on my label just to save it 
from the obligatory glued-on vocal top line treatment to get it on the radio. 
This kind of commercial suicide is probably why it wasn’t offered to my label 
in the first place!

The track that’s been unfairly slept on this year

A sure fire floorfiller that has been a staple in my sets all summer, 
particularly in Ibiza. It gets the crowd on it like a bonnet and yet I have yet 
to hear another DJ ever play it.

The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes
Incredible Bongo Band: Apache

I started my sets with this for years to clear the crowd’s musical palette. 
One of the best breaks known to man introduces a slightly camp but percussive 
version of the Shadows classic. It certainly has people looking up from their 
pints.

The track that should have been a crossover hit

The biggest tune in Ibiza this summer and then all over the radio and touching 
hearts and minds everywhere, but it only scraped the top 10. There is no god!
