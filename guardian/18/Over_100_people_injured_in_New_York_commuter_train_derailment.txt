“We believe that the worst injury we’ve heard of at this time is a possible 
broken leg,” New York governor Andrew Cuomo said at the scene. “That’s what 
we’re monitoring at this time. A broken leg is not good, but we’ve been in 
situations where we’ve had worse.”

The six-car train was traveling from the Far Rockaway station in Queens. There 
were between 600 and 700 people on the train.

Cuomo said the train did not stop at a bumper at the end of the track, but was 
traveling at a “fairly low rate of speed”.

He said officials did not know why the operator did not stop the train and 
that there would be an investigation into the incident.

Daniel Alvarez, who was on the derailed train, said passengers were standing 
in the packed train when it rolled into the station.

“It ran into one of the bumpers and jolted up,” Alvarez told the New York 
Daily News

. “Everyone in the train just went flying. I fell into a woman and she fell 
into someone else.”

New York City mayor Bill de Blasio did not visit the scene of the incident.

“Long Island Rail Road is obviously the purview of the governor,” de Blasio 
said. “But more importantly, thank God these are very minor injuries.”


The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) said the derailment caused traffic 
and travel delays near the station, which is also a stop for city subway lines.

About 300,000 people ride the LIRR each week, according to the MTA.
