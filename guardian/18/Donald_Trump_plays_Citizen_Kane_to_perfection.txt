Where did the real Guardian go? Front-page prominence for Princess Diana’s 
stepmother 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/21/raine-countess-spencer-obituary>
 on Saturday, but aWitney byelection report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/witney-byelection-lib-dems-tories-slashed-majority>
 only on page 12, giving no analysis of the wider significance of the result. 
Clearly, whatever the press and politicians believe, the public may well now 
use the Liberal Democrats as a brake on bulldozing Brexit.

• In Citizen Kane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/22/citizen-kane-voted-greatest-ever-american-film-bbc-poll>
, Orson Welles plays a newspaper tycoon who is running for public office. On 
the eve of the election results he has two headlines prepared for the morning 
edition of his paper. The first welcomes his victory, the second cries “Fraud 
at the Polls”. Sounds familiar (I will accept election – as long as I win, says 
Trump

• Susan Hill (Review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/20/susan-hill-ghost-stories-winter>
, 22 October) is mistaken in thinking that JB Priestley never wrote a ghost 
story. She should look up his short novel, Jenny Villiers, published 1947, 
about a theatrical haunting – a great favourite of mine in my teens.

• Surely Alan Partridge demonstrated a cool and rational approach to using the 
H-word (Letters, 20

hate him (‘He is a total wazzock and I can’t stand him’

• The prime minister made her refusal to negotiate Brexit in French (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-brexit-negotiations-language-french>
, 22 October), from behind a stand emblazoned with the words “Honi soit qui mal 
y pense” and “Dieu et mon droit”.
