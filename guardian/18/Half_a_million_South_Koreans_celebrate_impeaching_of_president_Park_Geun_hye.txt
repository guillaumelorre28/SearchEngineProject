, with thousands braving freezing temperatures over the weekend to declare a 
victory for people power.


Large numbers of protesters returned to the streets of Seoul on Saturday, 
marking Friday’s suspension of Park’s presidential powers with candlelit 
vigils, music, chanting and impromptu firework displays.

Some among a crowd organisers estimated at 500,000 played drums and gongs, 
while other held up an effigy of park dressed in a prison uniform.

Despite the festive mood, people who had gathered just outside the 
presidential Blue House made it clear they were still not satisfied, calling on 
Park to resign immediately rather than awaita ruling on the legitimacy of her 
impeachment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/09/south-korea-impeachment-vote-the-key-facts-behind-a-presidential-crisis>
 by the constitutional court.

After MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of impeachment, Park said she would 
wait for the court’s nine judges to confirm whether or not the move was valid – 
a process that could take up to six months.

But at the weekend, protesters demanded that Park vacate the Blue House, where 
she is expected to remain, shorn of her powers and shunned by much of her own 
party, while the judges consider their verdict.

She may have been able to hear crowds outside chanting: “Park Geun-hye, get 
out of the house!” and “Come down and go to jail!”

Kim Hye-in, a demonstrator who was attending her sixth anti-Park 
demonstration, said impeachment was just a first step. “It was a day when we 
all realised how strong we can be collectively,” Kim said. “But we aren’t there 
just yet. We need to keep gathering strength and protest until the court 
officially removes her from office.”

Kim In-sook, a café owner, handed out free coffee to protesters. “I am giving 
away coffee to celebrate Park’s impeachment and to call for her arrest,” Yonhap 
quoted Kim as a saying. “I want to share in the people’s joy.”

Park has denied any legal wrongdoing in a corruption and cronyism scandal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/nov/02/south-korea-explainer-park-guen-hye-six-key-points-scandal-choi-soon-sil>
 that has left her fighting for her political life, four years after she became 
South Korea’s first female president.

She is accused of helping her longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil

, coerce South Korean companies into handing over tens of millions of dollars 
in donations to foundations run by Choi.

Choi faces embezzlement charges while Park, who has been named as a formal 
suspect, has apologised for her “naivety” but denied seeking any personal gain. 
Park’s lawyer described as groundless prosecutors’ allegations that she was 
“collusively involved” in Choi’s alleged activities.

Moments after she was impeached, Park apologised for her “lack of virtue” and 
the turmoil her relationship with Choi has caused, but resisted calls to step 
down. Her powers have been temporarily transferred to the country’s prime 
minister, Hwang Kyo-ahn.

Analysts believe Park is reluctant to resign because scandal-hit South Korean 
presidents who leave office before their single, five-year term has ended leave 
themselves open to criminal charges.

Park’s impeachment has prompted talk of a resurrection of popular resistance in
South Korea <https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea>, three decades 
after huge demonstrations led to the introduction of free and fair elections.

“We accomplished a peaceful revolution,” said Park Seong-su, a frequent 
anti-Park protester. “For long, people were told by politicians what to do, but 
on Friday, it was the will of people that forced politicians what to do.”

The overwhelming vote in favour of impeachment, with opposition MPs joined by 
scores of lawmakers from Park’s Saenuri party, came after several consecutive 
weekends of protests with a combined attendance running into the millions.

Park will be removed from office if at least six of the constitutional court’s 
nine justices support her impeachment, with a presidential election held within 
60 days. But if at least six judges are opposed, Park’s presidential powers 
will be restored and she could limp on until the end of her term in February 
2018.

There have been warnings that failure to uphold the impeachment vote would be 
a betrayal of the South Korean people and could lead to civil unrest. “Then the 
candles will turn into torches,” said protester Kim Hyeong-seok.
