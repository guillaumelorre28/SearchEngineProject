Egypt <https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt> has unearthed a city more than 
7,000 years old and a cemetery dating back to its first dynasty in the southern 
province of Sohag, the antiquities ministry has said.

The find could be a boon for Egypt’s ailing tourism industry

, which has suffered a series of setbacks since the uprising that toppled the 
autocratHosni Mubarak

 in 2011, but remains a vital source of foreign currency.

The city is likely to have housed high-ranking officials and grave builders. 
Its discovery may yield new insights into Abydos, one of the oldest cities in 
ancient Egypt, the ministry said in a statement.

Experts say Abydos was Egypt’s capital towards the end of the predynastic 
period and during the rule of the first four dynasties.

The discovery was made 400 metres away from the temple of Seti I, a New 
Kingdom period memorial across the Nile from present day Luxor.

Archaeologists have so far uncovered huts, pottery remains, iron tools and 15 
huge graves.

“The size of the graves discovered in the cemetery is larger in some instances 
than royal graves in Abydos dating back to the first dynasty, which proves the 
importance of the people buried there and their high social standing during 
this early era of ancient Egyptian history,” the ministry said.

Egypt’s tourism industry has struggled to recover since the bombing of a 
Russian plane

carrying 224 people from a Red Sea resort in October 2015.

More than 14.7 million tourists visited Egypt in 2010, dropping to 9.8 million 
in 2011. In the first quarter of 2016 just 1.2 million tourists travelled to 
Egypt, down from 2.2 million a year earlier.
