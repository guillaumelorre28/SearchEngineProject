The California <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california> commission on 
judicial performance ruled on Monday that there was no evidence that Santa 
Clara County judge Aaron Persky displayed bias in handing down a sentence 
decried as too lenient by critics across the country.

“The commission has concluded that there is not clear and convincing evidence 
of bias, abuse of authority, or other basis to conclude that Judge Persky 
engaged in judicial misconduct warranting discipline,” the 11-member panel 
concluded in its unsigned ruling.

Turner’s case exploded on social media and ignited a debate about campus rape 
and the criminal justice system after thevictim’s 7,200-word letter

 that she read in the courtroom during sentencing was published online.

The commission said it received thousands of complaints and petitions 
regarding Persky and the sentence.

The petitions included complaints that Persky “displayed gender bias and 
failed to take sexual assault of women seriously”, and showed favoritism to 
Turner because the judge was a former Stanford athlete as well.

The 21-year-old was released from jail in September after serving three 
months. He will be on probation for three years in his native Ohio and is a 
registered sex offender.

Persky is the target of a recall campaign

launched by Stanford law professor Michele Landis Dauber, who said in a 
statement on Monday that the recall effort would continue.

“This report simply highlights what we have been saying from the beginning,” 
the statement read, “which is that a petition for judicial discipline was not 
the correct venue to address these concerns, and the recall is the only 
realistic way to remove Judge Persky from office.”

“Judge Persky has a long record of failing to take violence against women 
seriously, and we will demonstrate that when we launch the campaign early next 
year,” Dauber said.

Turner was convicted of assaulting the woman behind a dumpster after they 
drank heavily at a fraternity party. The woman had passed out and Turner was on 
top of her when confronted by two graduate students passing by on bicycles. 
They chased and tackled him when he tried to flee, holding him on the ground 
until police arrived.


A jury in March found Turner guilty of three felony sexual assault counts. 
Persky sentenced him to six months in jail, citing the “extraordinary 
circumstances” of Turner’s youth, clean criminal record and other 
considerations in departing from the minimum sentence of two years in prison. 
Prosecutors had argued for six years.
