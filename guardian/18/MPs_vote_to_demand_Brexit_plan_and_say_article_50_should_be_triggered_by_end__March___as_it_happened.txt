Summary

 * Britain has taken a significant, although largely symbolic, step closer to 
Brexit after the MPs voted by a majority of almost 400 to back Theresa May’s 
plan to trigger article 50 by the end of March. In two votes, Labour and 
Conservative MPs joined forces to back a Labour motion saying the government 
should publish a “plan for leaving the EU” before article 50 is invoked, and a 
government amendment saying the government should invoke article 50 by 31 
March. The vote is not technically binding on the government, but it is the 
first time parliament has backed May’s Brexit timetable, which would lead to 
the UK being out of the EU by the end of March 2019 (assuming that the two-year 
withdrawal process does not get extended.) 
 * Labour has set out its conditions for supporting the triggering of article 
50. In his speech Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, set out five 
conditions for the government’s Brexit plan. (See 4.41pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/07/brexit-debate-plan-labour-pmqs-call-for-government-to-publish-its-brexit-plan-politics-live?page=with:block-58483705e4b06a0d55b187ec#block-58483705e4b06a0d55b187ec>
Unless the government wins its supreme court appeal there will have to be an 
article 50 bill and Starmer said, if the government’s Brexit plan did not 
fulfil his conditions, Labour would try to impose these terms on the government 
by amending the bill. On Sky News a moment ago, asked what would happen if the 
government did not cooperate, he said the government would face “further 
challenge” from Labour. He refused to elaborate on what this might mean, 
although ministers know they could be vulnerable to defeat because several 
dozen Tory MPs agree with Labour in favouring a “soft” Brexit. If there is an 
article 50 bill, the government wants to make it as hard to amend as possible, 
to minimise the chances of being defeated in this way. 
 * Labour’s decision to back the government amendment has triggered a 
significant rebellion. Some 23 Labour MPs defied the whip and voted against the 
amendment on the first vote. It is claimed that another 56 Labour MPs 
abstained, by not voting without being given permission to be absent. At the 
start of the week the Conservative party was said to be facing a rebellion, but 
only one Conservative MP, Ken Clarke. voted against the whip on the first vote. 
The Labour MPs who defied the whip did so because they thought it was wrong to 
agree to triggering article 50 by the end of March when the government still 
has not said what it wants. Labour denies offering the government a “blank 
cheque”, and Starmer stressed that his support for triggering article 50 was 
conditional. 
 * David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has refused to commit the government to 
publishing a white paper on its Brexit plan, suggesting that the “plan” that 
does get published will be a minimalist one. He has also refused to commit to 
giving MPs a vote on whether or not to leave the customs union. (See2.57pm.)

This is from the Press Association.

The second vote asked MPs to approve the amended motion, and therefore give 
their symbolic consent to both the call for a plan and for Brexit to be 
formally triggered by no later than the end of March next year.

Ken Clarke was the sole Conservative to vote against the motion. 

He was joined by nine Labour MPs, 51 SNP MPs, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas 
and five Liberal Democrats, among others.

This is from the Press Association.

MPs held two votes, with the first in favour of adding the Government 
amendment to the original Labour motion - by 461 votes to 89, majority 372.

This was opposed by 23 Labour MPs and one Conservative - former chancellor Ken 
Clarke.

The Labour rebels included Ben Bradshaw, David Lammy and former shadow 
chancellor Chris Leslie.

The amendment was also opposed by five Liberal Democrat MPs, three Plaid Cymru 
MPs and 51 SNP MPs.

Meanwhile, some 150 Labour MPs backed the government’s amendment.

Leave Means Leave, the successor to the Leave.EU campaign, has welcomed the 
vote. This is from its co-chair, Richard Tice.

This vote is a very significant step forward in the Brexit process.

Parliamentarians who, today, backed the government’s amendment have honoured 
the democratic decision taken by the British people in the EU referendum.

Going forward, these parliamentarians who voted with the government must not 
sabotage the Brexit process.

Any attempt to delay the process after backing this amendment would be an 
unforgivable betrayal of the British people.

 * Britain has taken a significant, although largely symbolic, step closer to 
Brexit after the MPs voted by a majority of almost 400 to back Theresa May’s 
plan to trigger article 50 by the end of March. In two votes, Labour and 
Conservative MPs joined forces to back a Labour motion saying the government 
should publish a “plan for leaving the EU” before article 50 is invoked, and a 
government amendment saying the government should invoke article 50 by 31 
March. The vote is not technically binding on the government, but it is the 
first time parliament has backed May’s Brexit timetable, which would lead to 
the UK being out of the EU by the end of March 2019 (assuming that the two-year 
withdrawal process does not get extended.) 
 * Labour has set out its conditions for supporting the triggering of article 
50. In his speech Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, set out five 
conditions for the government’s Brexit plan. (See 4.41pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/07/brexit-debate-plan-labour-pmqs-call-for-government-to-publish-its-brexit-plan-politics-live?page=with:block-58483705e4b06a0d55b187ec#block-58483705e4b06a0d55b187ec>
Unless the government wins its supreme court appeal there will have to be an 
article 50 bill and Starmer said, if the government’s Brexit plan did not 
fulfil his conditions, Labour would try to impose these terms on the government 
by amending the bill. On Sky News a moment ago, asked what would happen if the 
government did not cooperate, he said the government would face “further 
challenge” from Labour. He refused to elaborate on what this might mean, 
although ministers know they could be vulnerable to defeat because several 
dozen Tory MPs agree with Labour in favouring a “soft” Brexit. If there is an 
article 50 bill, the government wants to make it as hard to amend as possible, 
to minimise the chances of being defeated in this way. 
 * Labour’s decision to back the government amendment has triggered a 
significant rebellion. Some 23 Labour MPs defied the whip and voted against the 
amendment on the first vote. It is claimed that another 56 Labour MPs 
abstained, by not voting without being given permission to be absent. At the 
start of the week the Conservative party was said to be facing a rebellion, but 
only one Conservative MP, Ken Clarke. voted against the whip on the first vote. 
The Labour MPs who defied the whip did so because they thought it was wrong to 
agree to triggering article 50 by the end of March when the government still 
has not said what it wants. Labour denies offering the government a “blank 
cheque”, and Starmer stressed that his support for triggering article 50 was 
conditional. 
 * David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has refused to commit the government to 
publishing a white paper on its Brexit plan, suggesting that the “plan” that 
does get published will be a minimalist one. He has also refused to commit to 
giving MPs a vote on whether or not to leave the customs union. (See2.57pm.)

That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

The second vote asked MPs to approve the amended motion, and therefore give 
their symbolic consent to both the call for a plan and for Brexit to be 
formally triggered by no later than the end of March next year.

Ken Clarke was the sole Conservative to vote against the motion. 

He was joined by nine Labour MPs, 51 SNP MPs, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas 
and five Liberal Democrats, among others.
 
The SNP is using the same line as Iain Duncan Smith.

This is from the Press Association.

chancellor Chris Leslie.

The amendment was also opposed by five Liberal Democrat MPs, three Plaid Cymru 
MPs and 51 SNP MPs.

Leave Means Leave, the successor to the Leave.EU campaign, has welcomed the 
vote. This is from its co-chair, Richard Tice.

This vote is a very significant step forward in the Brexit process.

Parliamentarians who, today, backed the government’s amendment have honoured 
the democratic decision taken by the British people in the EU referendum.

Going forward, these parliamentarians who voted with the government must not 
sabotage the Brexit process.

Any attempt to delay the process after backing this amendment would be an 
unforgivable betrayal of the British people.
