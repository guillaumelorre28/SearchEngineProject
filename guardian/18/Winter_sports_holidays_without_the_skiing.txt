Ride a Snooc, Le Grand Bornand, France

Hiking off into the wilderness and finding peace away from the pistes is one 
of the most rewarding things to do in the mountains. But learning how to ski in 
backcountry takes years, and can involve a lot of swearing and slapstick 
mishap. Now, thanks to a new invention called the Snooc, even those who can’t 
ski or snowboard can go snow-touring off the beaten track. It functions as a 
pair of easy-to-use skis for walking uphill, then when it’s time to head down, 
it quickly transforms into a toboggan for riding safely and enjoyably back to 
the resort, perhaps even with a few powder turns along the way. Le Grand 
Bornand is one of the first resorts to offer Snooc rental.

Given that snowboarding, which is essentially surfing on snow, was invented 
over 40 years ago, it’s surprising that it’s taken so long for someone to 
introduce front-lying bodyboarding to the slopes. Of course, there is the 
skeleton bobsleigh, but that’s hardly recreational, given that it involves 
racing down a lethal icy track at approaching 80mph. With the new sport of 
baseboarding, offered in Whistler for the first time this winter, riders lie on 
an aerodynamic board to descend soft snowy pistes with plenty of room to 
manoeuvre. Anyone can give it a go and full training and guidance is provided, 
starting on a 200-metre warm-up track before hitting the main 1.5km course.

There are plenty of music festivals in the mountains, but there aren’t many 
where everything, from stages to seating, is constructed from ice and snow. 
That’s the case at the Ice Music Festival in the Norwegian ski resort of Geilo, 
where even the instruments – harps, xylophones, guitars and trombones – are 
made of ice, bringing a wholly original atmosphere and sound. however, visitors 
do have to layer up in all the clothes they own to attend. Beyond the festival, 
Geilo has plenty of other exciting winter activities, including snowshoeing, 
dog-sledding, tobogganing and fat biking.

Modified mountain bikes with super-fat tyres can be ridden on snow. Known as 
fat bikes, they originated in the US, and some European ski resorts introduced 
them last winter. They’re popular, especially among cyclists who can’t ski, but 
the problem has been where to allow them. Fat bikes are less easy to control 
than normal bikes, so aren’t allowed on open ski slopes,but cross-country 
skiers weren’t mad about bikes being ridden on their trails either. Lenzerheide 
in eastern Switzerland may have the answer. It has closed one ski slope to 
skiers and snowboarders and turned it into a fat bike piste. It will also boast 
a snow bike park with custom-made obstacles and big jumps for bolder riders.

Many mountain regions claim a long history of snowshoeing, but none has the 
carbon-dated proof the Italian Dolomites have. Earlier this month, what is 
believed to be the oldest snowshoe in the world was found here, dated to 
sometime around 3,700 BC. It’s still a popular activity and a great place to 
learn. The scenery, a Unesco world heritage site, is just as stunning and 
unspoilt now, especially on trails away from the pistes amid the snowy woodland 
and high mountains. No prior experience is needed but participants need to be 
happy walking for four to five hours.

Unless you’re an Inuit or an idiot, kayaking in deepest winter on the one 
stretch of water in the region that hasn’t frozen over, might not seem the most 
sensible or appealing proposition. But it’s a breathtaking and original 
experience. Hightide Kayak School runs guided trips throughout the winter on 
Lake Brienz, amid striking snowy peaks, which reflect off the mirror-like 
water. Top-of-the range dry suits and boots keep paddlers toasty warm. And 
though sunny days may be the most beautiful, snowy ones are by far the most 
atmospheric and memorable. The lake is a short (free) bus ride from the ski 
resort of Interlaken.

There’s no need to go to the Arctic for a dog-sledding adventure. Surrounded 
by stunning peaks, Peyragudes in the Pyrenees is a great place to give it a go, 
and far more peaceful than the Alps. After a 30-minute technical session, 
sledders who are reasonably fit and at least 12 years old get to pilot their 
own team of eager huskies. Families with younger children can enjoy a guided 
sled ride led by an experienced musher. The resort also offers igloo-building, 
skidoo rides and a tour of the slopes on a piste basher.

Driving on ice can be scary at home, but it can also be hugely thrilling, 
thanks to a new 3,500-square-metre ice-karting track, near the ski resort of
