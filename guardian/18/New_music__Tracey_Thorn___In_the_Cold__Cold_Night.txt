When Tracey Thorn first announced details of her forthcoming Christmas album, 
Tinsel and Lights, back in August it seemed a little disconcerting, like being 
confronted with the Christmas aisle in a supermarket while the sun is still 
shining outside. However, it's all starting to make a lot more sense now 
everyone's had to whack their heating on and the wind and rain have picked up. 
Making a festive record is something of a dream come true for Thorn: "I've 
always wanted to make a Christmas record. Every year, when the Christmas albums 
start appearing in November, I get jealous and wish I had one coming out. Last 
year when that happened again, I made a resolution to get recording in January 
to be ready for the following Christmas. And so that's just what I did." The 
first single to be taken from the album – which comprises 10 seasonal covers 
(some are just about winter, as opposed to all things Christmassy), two new 
compositions and a duet with Green Gartside – is Thorn's take on the White 
Stripes'In the Cold, Cold Night <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuipVth6O4M>, 
premiered here. It takes that crisp guitar riff, adds a distant metronomic beat 
and, by the end, feels a whole lot warmer.

• Tinsel and Lights is released on 12 November on Strange Feeling.
