It was bloody tight, as you can absolutely imagine, but on the balance of play 
Rangers probably deserved that. Andy Halliday was superb for Mark Warburton’s 
side over the 120 minutes, and stuck his penalty away very nicely.Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> will play Hibs in the final, but 
this game will certainly mean more. And if nothing else, it sets up the regular 
return of the Old Firm games up next season very nicely indeed.

Remarkable scenes, but that was an absolutely hideous penalty by Tom Rogic at 
the end. He should’ve tried a Panenka....

Tell a lie - the last time the Old Firm were involved in a shoot-out was in 
the Dryborough Cup in 1974.Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
won 4-2 on that occasion, and by coincidence the score in normal play then was 
2-2.

Extra-time - 30 mins: Griffiths took that shot by the way. Sorry - forgot that

Extra-time - 29 mins: Celtic free-kick around 30 yards out....and Foderingham 
brilliantly tips it onto the bar! The ball then hits the keeper’s back and goes 
just wide! So a slice of brilliance and a bit of luck for the keeper!

Extra-time - 23 mins: Griffiths plays a booming crossfield pass to Griffiths, 
who brings it down brilliantly but makes a mess of the cross. The ball finds 
its way to McGregor, who shoots from range but Foderingham dives to his right 
to make a good save.

Extra-time - 20 mins: Rogic goes close again! McGregor threads the needle with 
a pass through the defence, the sub is clear but he takes a slightly heavy 
touch, allowing Foderingham to get close and just tip the shot wide.

Extra-time - 18 mins: And now Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> look lively - the ball falls to 
Roberts in the area who has a great chance to shoot with his right foot...but 
tries to switch onto his left and skews it backwards. And in the process, he 
cramped up. So a bad choice all round, really.

Extra-time - 16 mins: Tierney breaks down the left, avoids a challenge from 
Tavernier and cuts back to Rogic, who finds himself in some space in the area 
and sweeps home a left-footed shot! Great response fromCeltic

Cheers for reading - I’m off to have a brief lie down. Here’s Ewan Murray’s 
match report:

Rangers in Scottish Cup final after beating Celtic in penalty shootout
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/17/celtic-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-match-report> 
It was bloody tight, as you can absolutely imagine, but on the balance of play 
Rangers probably deserved that. Andy Halliday was superb for Mark Warburton’s 
side over the 120 minutes, and stuck his penalty away very nicely.Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> will play Hibs in the final, but 
this game will certainly mean more. And if nothing else, it sets up the regular 
return of the Old Firm games up next season very nicely indeed.

Remarkable scenes, but that was an absolutely hideous penalty by Tom Rogic at 
the end. He should’ve tried a Panenka....
 
Rangers 5-4 Celtic: MISS! Rogic steps up...and balloons it high and wide!
 
Rangers 5-4 Celtic: Law sends Gordon the wrong way. Remarkable stuff, this. 
 
Rangers 4-4 Celtic: Lustig doesn’t look confident...but he puts it superbly 
into the corner.
 
Rangers 4-3 Celtic: Zelalem cooly sidefoots into the corner. 
 
Rangers 3-3 Celtic: Griffiths has to score...and does, high to the keeper’s 
right.
 
Rangers 3-2 Celtic: Wallace scores and the pressure is all on Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> now!
 
Rangers 2-2 Celtic: MISS! Another miss! Brown sidefoots to Foderingham’s left 
but it’s a poor penalty and theRangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> keeper saves!
 
Rangers 2-2 Celtic: MISS! Clark tries the same but Gordon gets a strong enough 
hand to it to tip over the bar!
 
Rangers 2-2 Celtic: Bitton sidefoots it straight down the middle. 
 
Rangers 2-1 Celtic: Mckay just scores with Gordon getting a big hand on it. 
 
Rangers 1-1 Celtic: Miss! McGregor hits the bar!
 
Rangers 1-1 Celtic: Miss! Tavernier puts it over the bar!
 
Rangers 1-1 Celtic: Mulgrew puts it into the corner.
 
Rangers 1-0 Celtic: Halliday is first up and sends Gordon the wrong way. 
 
Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> have won the toss and 
will take their penalties first.
 
Tell a lie - the last time the Old Firm were involved in a shoot-out was in 
the Dryborough Cup in 1974.Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
won 4-2 on that occasion, and by coincidence the score in normal play then was 
2-2.
 
Strewth.

Extra-time - 30 mins: Griffiths took that shot by the way. Sorry - forgot that 
in all the excitement.
 
Extra-time - 29 mins: Celtic free-kick around 30 yards out....and Foderingham 
brilliantly tips it onto the bar! The ball then hits the keeper’s back and goes 
just wide! So a slice of brilliance and a bit of luck for the keeper!
 
Extra-time - 27 mins: Far as I can work out there hasn’t been a competitive 
penalty shoot out between these two teams. Blimey and so forth.
 
Extra-time - 25 mins: Five minutes to go. Who’s going to make a horrible 
mistake and ensure they can never show their face in Glasgow again?
 
Extra-time - 23 mins: Griffiths plays a booming crossfield pass to Griffiths, 
who brings it down brilliantly but makes a mess of the cross. The ball finds 
its way to McGregor, who shoots from range but Foderingham dives to his right 
to make a good save.
 
Extra-time - 22 mins: The game has that ‘there’s loads of space because 
everyone is so tired, but everyone is too tired to actually do anything with 
the space’ feel to it at the moment. Lovely stuff.
 
Extra-time - 21 mins: Holt makes a mess of a shot and it loops up into the 
air, Gordon deciding to punch for reasons unclear. The ball is hoofed down 
field and Foderingham charges out of his goal, just getting there before 
Griffiths out on theRangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> 
right.
 
Extra-time - 20 mins: Rogic goes close again! McGregor threads the needle with 
a pass through the defence, the sub is clear but he takes a slightly heavy 
touch, allowing Foderingham to get close and just tip the shot wide.
 
Extra-time - 18 mins: And now Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> look lively - the ball falls to 
Roberts in the area who has a great chance to shoot with his right foot...but 
tries to switch onto his left and skews it backwards. And in the process, he 
cramped up. So a bad choice all round, really.
 
Extra-time - 16 mins: Tierney breaks down the left, avoids a challenge from 
Tavernier and cuts back to Rogic, who finds himself in some space in the area 
and sweeps home a left-footed shot! Great response fromCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>.
 
They’re level straight away!
