Jack White has set a US record for the biggest one-week vinyl sales since the 
industry started counting accurately. Fans snatched up 40,000 vinyl copies of 
White's new solo album,Lazaretto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/05/jack-white-lazaretto-review>, 
which was packed with special effects that onlywork on turntables

Prior to Lazaretto's blockbuster week, Nielsen SoundScan's vinyl record had 
remained unbroken for almost as long as the organisation has been monitoring 
sales in 1991. The previous benchmark was Pearl Jam's LP Vitalogy, released 
three years after SoundScan's creation, which moved 34,000 copies in its first 
seven days. Unlike White's split song intros and hidden tracks, the grunge 
band's only trick was its sale date: Vitalogy's vinyl edition dropped two weeks 
before it came out on CD or cassette.


Lazaretto doesn't have a cassette version. But its CD edition scarcely outsold 
the vinyl. Overall, including more than 80,000 digital purchases, Lazaretto 
sold about 138,000 copies - the same figure as White's solo debut, 2012's 
Blunderbuss. Though this number pales next to top-sellers like Taylor Swift, 
who sold 1.2m albums in one week in 2012, it was enough to make Lazaretto this 
week's Billboard No 1 full-length. According to Billboard, White's vinyl sales 
alone, split from the rest, would be enough to make it No 4.


"This [object] ... is my proudest moment with Third Man Records," White said 
on a recentConan O'Brien appearance 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cn_Kr0nLeU>. "We got away with a lot of 
things." In the UK, Lazaretto debuted at No 4.
