He has announced forthcoming books twice in the last two years: one on the 
Gamergate controversy, whichhe flagged in December 2014 
<http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/12/15/i-m-writing-a-book-about-gamergate/>
, and one called The Sociopaths of Silicon Valley, in January 2015.

Neither has been published.

Yiannopoulos, the technology editor at far-right website Breitbart, was banned 
from Twitter in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-twitter>
 for his role in the online abuse of the Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones. The 
chief executive of Breitbart, Steven Bannon, is Trump’scontroversial choice for 
chief strategist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/steve-bannon-white-house-racism-fear>
 in the White House.

Yiannopoulos told the Hollywood Reporter that negative publicity had only 
boosted his profile, likening it to MTV banning the video for Madonna’s Justify 
My Love in 1990 and coverage of Trump in the lead-up to the US election.

“They said banning me from Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> would finish me off,” 
Yiannopoulos said. “Just as I predicted, the opposite has happened.”

He did not confirm the precise amount paid for his book, but claimed he was 
offered “a wheelbarrow full of money”.

“I met with top execs at Simon & Schuster earlier in the year and spent half 
an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions. I thought 
they were going to have me escorted from the building – but instead they 
offered me a wheelbarrow full of money.”

Threshold Editions was founded in 2006 “to provide a forum for … innovative 
ideas of contemporary conservativism”. Accordingto its mission statement 
<http://www.thresholdeditions.com/>, it is “celebrating 10 years of being 
right!”

Its recent bestsellers include works by the president-elect Trump, Glenn Beck, 
Rush Limbaugh and Dick and Liz Cheney.

The Chicago Review of Books described Yiannopoulos’ book deal 
<https://twitter.com/bookschicago/status/814544045825474561> as a “disgusting 
validation of hate” and said it would boycott books published by Simon & 
Schuster in 2017 in protest.

In response to this disgusting validation of hate, we will not cover a single 
@simonschuster <https://twitter.com/simonschuster> book in 2017.

Yiannopoulos <https://twitter.com/paperhaus/status/814512212488224768>as a 
“troll promoting racist, sexist views”.

If you approved a $250K book deal for the troll promoting racist, sexist views 
so extreme he got thrown off this platform - we need to talk.

Publishers & agents get to ask themselves daily where they would draw the 
line, what books they wouldn't take on. The answer defines us.

Simon & Schuster has been contacted by the Guardian for comment.


Yiannopoulos told the Hollywood Reporter that he was “more powerful, more 
influential and more fabulous than ever before”, and that his upcoming book 
would mark “the moment Milo goes mainstream”.

He is also understood to be filming highlights of his “Dangerous Faggot” 
speaking tour of universities in the US for a full-length feature documentary.

A talk he was scheduled to give at his former school, Langton Grammar in Kent, 
in November wascancelled due to security concerns
