One of China’s most prominent feminists has a message for the US 
president-elect: “Hey Trump, feminists are watching you.”

Zheng Churan, who has been supported by Hillary Clinton for her advocacy, 
wrote a letter to Trump warming him of the perils of chauvinism as he prepares 
to take office.

Trump famously boasted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
 about using his fame to have sex with women and grope them without prior 
consent, saying: “When you’re a star they let you do it.”


In 2015 Zheng was one of five feminist activists detained by police 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/five-chinese-feminists-held-international-womens-day>
 for more than a month after the group planned a peaceful protest against 
sexual harassment.

Zheng, who is also known as Datu or Big Rabbit, wrote to the president-elect: 
“Even across the Pacific, in the faraway land ofChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china>, there are constantly reports of you 
and your government’s involvement in sexual discrimination.

“We wish you to watch out, the feminists worldwide are speaking, and we are 
watching you.”

Zheng called on Trump to respect women’s rights, warning him not to use his 
position to spread “straight-man cancer”.

The term has become popular in China in recent years to describe a “disease” 
among narrow-minded men seeking to control women and work against gender 
equality.

“Straight-man cancer” also chastises men seen to cling on to traditional 
Chinese norms in relationships, such as suppressing women’s rights through 
official policies, devaluing female labour and branding educated women as 
unattractive.

“In general ‘straight-man cancer’ is the equivalent of ‘male chauvinist pig’ 
in English,” Zheng wrote.

“Just like cancerous cells, straight-man cancer spreads everywhere damaging 
feminist movements and undermining social equality. It is pervasive.”

Clinton supported China’s feminists during their detention, accusing President 
Xi Jinping of the“shameless” 
<https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/648099640714391552> persecution of 
women’s rights activists.

Trump’s eventual election rival became an icon following a 1995 speech she gave
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=-10&v=xXM4E23Efvk> at the UN’s 
Fourth Conference on Women in Beijing.

Trump’s record of supporting causes of the persecuted is far less clear – and 
manyadvocates in China worry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/15/trump-and-china-fears-deal-making-consign-human-rights-to-political-roadkill>
 his presidency will prioritise deal-making over human rights.

Zheng predicted a hard fall if Trump’s previous sentiments followed him into 
the White House.

“We wish to warn you that those who spread this straight-man cancer will 
inevitably pay their price for the contemptible comments, violent remarks 
towards women or actions sexualising women.”
