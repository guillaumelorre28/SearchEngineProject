 in the Indian Ocean has been formally identified as part of the wreckage of 
Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, a French prosecutor has said.

 The part, known as a flaperon

, was discovered on 29 July and the Malaysian authorities have said that paint 
colour and maintenance record matches prove it came from the missing Boeing 777 
aircraft.

 The Paris prosecutor, who had been more cautious about its provenance until 
the statement, issued on Thursday, said a technician from Airbus, which made 
the part for Boeing, had formally identified one of the three numbers found on 
the flaperon as being the serial number from MH370.

They said: “It is therefore possible to confirm with certainty that the 
flaperon found onRéunion <https://www.theguardian.com/world/reunion> island on 
29 July corresponds to the one from flight MH370.”

 The plane disappeared in March last year

 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on 
board.
