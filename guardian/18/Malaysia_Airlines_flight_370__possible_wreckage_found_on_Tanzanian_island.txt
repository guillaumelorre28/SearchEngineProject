that vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board, said a “piece of aircraft

MH370: officials from Australia, China and Malaysia to discuss future of search

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is conducting the search on 
Malaysia’s behalf, is seeking further information to determine whether the 
debris is from flight 370, Chester said in a statement.

Several pieces of the plane have washed up over the past year on coastlines 
around the Indian Ocean, which is consistent with drifting models based on it 
having crashed in the Indian Ocean southwest of Australia.

The bureau announced on Wednesday that debris found on an Australian island 
earlier this month was not from flight 370

.

The airliner vanished on 8 March, 2014, after flying off course during a 
flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.

Authorities say the plane probably crashed in the Indian Ocean, but officials 
have not found the main wreckage despite an extensive underwater search of a 
vast area. Crews are expected to complete their sweep of the 120,000-square 
kilometre (46,000-square mile) area by August, and there are no plans to extend 
the hunt beyond that.

More debris was found earlier this month washed ashore in Madagascar by a man 
who previously found a part of Flight 370, but the pieces have yet to be 
examined by investigators.
