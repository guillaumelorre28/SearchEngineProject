Camden Market owner Market Tech is in demand on its first day as a public 
company.

The company, the biggest flotation on Aim this year, has seen its shares jump 
from the 200p placing price to 226p, valuing the business at more than £830m.

The placing, which was oversubscribed, raised £100m which will be used to 
develop its e-commerce platform, market.com, and to develop the site of the 
market in north London.

Some of the proceeds will go towards developing the five acre Camden Lock 
Village, a canal-side site with residential, commercial and retail space as 
well as a new primary school.

 The business is backed by Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi, founder of online 
gambling software company Playtech, who bought the Camden stables market site 
in March for £400m and purchased Camden Lock market in October for £100m.

The 11 acre site attracts around 28m visitors a year to its mix of bric-a-brac 
stores, arts and crafts shops, and fast food vendors.

But some stallholders are said to be concerned about the redevelopment plans, 
fearing they could harm the uniqueness of the area.
