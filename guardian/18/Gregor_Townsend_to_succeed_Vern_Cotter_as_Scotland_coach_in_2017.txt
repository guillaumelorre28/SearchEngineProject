Gregor Townsend has been named Vern Cotter’s successor as Scotland head coach.

The Scottish Rugby Union has announced that the Glasgow Warriors head coach 
will take over in June 2017, when Cotter’s contract expires.

The SRU chief executive, Mark Dodson, said: “Gregor’s abilities as a head 
coach are evident and he is increasingly becoming one of the most sought-after 
coaches in the game.”

Townsend, 43 has coached Glasgow since 2012 and led them to the Pro12 title in 
2015. He previously worked with Scotland as part of Andy Robinson’s backroom 
team following a playing career at fly-half that saw him capped 82 times.

Dodson added: “Gregor’s playing record as a Scotland internationalist and 
British Lion showed he is a man of vision and great professionalism, which he 
has since successfully transferred into his coaching roles, firstly with 
Scotland and subsequently Glasgow Warriors.”

Townsend said: “I am incredibly proud to take on the Scotland head coach role 
at the end of the season. It is a real honour to be given the responsibility of 
coaching the national team and I look forward to working with such an 
impressive group of players.

“I’d like to thank Scottish Rugby for this opportunity and also the 
supporters, players and staff at Glasgow Warriors for their support over the 
past four years. My focus is firmly on the season ahead with Glasgow and I will 
be doing all I can to help the club continue to progress this year.”
