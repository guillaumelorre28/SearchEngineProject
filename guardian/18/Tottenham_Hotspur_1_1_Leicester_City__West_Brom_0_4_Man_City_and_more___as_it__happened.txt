Meanwhile in Spain ...

La Liga: Real Madrid have come from behind to beat Alaves 4-1, with Cristiano

Full time: Manchester United 0-0 Burnley

Premier League: Manchester United slaughter Burnley 0-0 and miss almost 40 
attempts on goal in the process, That’s a great point for Burnley, but expect 
no end of whinging from Jose Mourinho in his post match press conference. He 
was sent to the stands at the start of the second half, while Ander Herrera 
also received a red card for two bookable offences.

Manchester United pile the pressure on Burnley

Premier League: Despite being down to 10 men, Manchester United are throwing 
the kitchen sink, the bathroom sink and the few stadium toilet sinks that 
naughty Manchester City fans didn’t vandalise during the week at Burnley. 
They’ve had 34 attempts on goal, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic missing the latest. It 
remains scoreless at Old Trafford.

And in Spain ...

La Liga: Alaves took a seventh minute lead against Real Madrid courtesy of
