It really depends on the DJ who’s playing before me, but if I could just start 
new and play whatever I wanted, it would be this. It just makes you want to 
move and dance.

The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor

This was a hit when minimal was big, but I’m now playing it 10 years later in 
a different context. Everyone freaks out whenever I play it – it always works.

The track that currently gets the most rewinds 
Sharif Laffrey: Key Jam (ACID)

It’s groovy and sexy – all of a sudden everyone is dancing rather than just 
marching on the dancefloor.

The track I wish I’d signed to my label 
Georgio: Bedrock (Dub A Dub A Doo Mix)

Who would have thought that a track like this would come out on Motown? My 
ex-boyfriend found it ages ago in a €2 bin and it became an instant staple in 
my sets. I never get tired of it, so it would have been perfect for Love On The 
Rocks.

The track that should have been a crossover hit 
Fantastic Man: A Fountain Gate

A Love On The Rocks track. Sorry for the shameless self-love, but this is such 
a good jam.

Since I have a Persian background. I love the rhythm of this.

This one for sure. It’s dreamy and bittersweet, and sets the vibe for a 
magical night where anything could happen.

The track I’d play at my funeral

I didn’t understand many of the words when I was younger, but it has such a 
strong groove and reminds me of my childhood. This pick probably explains the 
absurdity of my life.
