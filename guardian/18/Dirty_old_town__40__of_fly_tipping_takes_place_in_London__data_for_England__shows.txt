Animal carcasses and armchairs, bathtubs and boilers … and more than 200,000 
instances involving black bags of rubbish – fly-tipping is on the rise again 
across England, costing its 10 biggest cities more than £32m in cleanup and 
enforcement costs in 2014/15.

Over that period there were 16 dumping incidents recorded per 1,000 population 
in England – but the rate inLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> was 
more than two-and-a-half times higher, and both Manchester and Liverpool 
experienced twice as much dumping per head than the national average.

The UK capital accounted for more than 40% of recorded fly-tipping incidents 
in the year to March 2015 at a cost of more than £25m in combined cleanup and 
enforcement. The next nine largest cities – Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, 
Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and Sunderland – accounted 
for a further 12% of the dumping incidents recorded last year.

Items dumped across the London in the last reporting period included more than 
100,000 instances of black bags dumped by households and businesses, almost 
10,000 fridges, washing machines and other white goods, and 1,600 animal 
carcasses.

London accounts for seven of the 10 worst areas for fly-tipping per head of 
population. The east London borough of Newham had the highest rate.

Newham council said that the increase was partly due to an investment in 
technology and staff to tackle the issue locally. “We have new smartphone 
technology, linked directly to our refuse vehicles which means reporting, and 
collecting of tips has increased dramatically,” a spokeswoman said, noting that 
a 37% increase in fly-tipping between April to September mirrored a rise in the 
number of residents reporting incidents through theLove Newham app

The number of dumping incidents recorded across England had been on the 
decrease – falling to a low of 711,000 between April 2012 and the end of March 
2013. But illegal dumping has been on the rise for the past two years for which 
data is available. In 2014/15 there were almost 900,000 fly-tipping incidents 
according tofigures published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural 
Affairs

.

Defra said some of this increase may be down to improvements in local 
authority recording, but cautioned that the number of reported incidents does 
not include dumping on private land.


Richard McIlwain, deputy chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy, said tighter 
bugets are forcing many local authorities to charge users to keep recycling 
facilities open.

It was important to “make it easy for people to do the right thing” by 
ensuring recycling centres were free to access, he said.


“Local Authorities are not the bad guys here – they are facing really tough 
choices and often charging is the only way they can keep the recycling 
facilities open. So the government needs to help out here – they raise £1bn 
centrally every year throughlandfill tax 
<http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/landfill-tax>. We are asking them to make 
some of this available to local authorities to help keep recycling centres 
open.”


But McIlwain also called for stricter enforcement and higher penalties for 
fly-tippers.

“The maximum penalty that magistrates are allowed to impose is £50,000 and/or 
a 12-month custodial sentence, yet over 60% of fines are less than £200 and 95% 
of the fines issued are less than £1,000. Magistrates need to impose stricter 
penalties to create a real deterrent.”


The estimated cost of fly-tipping to local authorities across England was £50m 
last year while a further £17.6m was spent on actions taken by councils, 
including investigations, warning letters, duty of care inspections and 
statutory notices. Prosecutions resulted in fines of less than £600,000 in the 
same time period.
