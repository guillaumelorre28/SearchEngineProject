A tribunal that hears complaints against the UK intelligence services is due 
to rule in a major state surveillance case on the confidentiality of 
conversations between lawyers and their clients.


The judgment at the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT) could be a decisive 
moment in the protracted courtroom manoeuvres involving the government and 
legal advisers to the Libyan dissidentAbdel Hakim Belhaj 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-hakim-belhaj>, who was abducted in 
2004 in a joint UK-US rendition operation and forcibly returned to Muammar 
Gaddafi’s regime.

A key section of the judgment, however, may be kept secret. At an earlier 
hearing last month, James Eadie QC, for the government, told the tribunal that 
making a public determination of whether or not there had been interception of 
sensitive material could endanger public safety.

The IPT, he urged, should stick to a policy of “neither confirm, nor deny”, 
known as NCND. “In circumstances where to depart from the NCND approach would 
cause damage to national security … the tribunal should adopt an approach which 
does not reveal the fact that interception has taken place.”


Belhaj is supported by Reprieve, Amnesty International and other human rights 
groups. The case was launched following revelations by the American 
whistleblower Edward Snowden exposing the extent of online and telephone 
surveillance carried out by US and UK monitoring agencies.

The government has already admitted that the policies and procedures governing 
the handling of legally privileged material were unlawful for the past five 
years because the safeguards were not made public. Exchanges between lawyers 
and their clients are entitled to a special level of legal protection.
