 buried near a temple from the era of the warrior king Thutmose III.

The tomb was likely to have belonged to a nobleman, Amenrenef, who would have 
been a servant of the royal household, the ministry said.

The archaeological team’s head, Myriam Seco Alvarez, said the mummy was 
adorned with many colourful decorations recallingreligious symbols from ancient 
Egypt
