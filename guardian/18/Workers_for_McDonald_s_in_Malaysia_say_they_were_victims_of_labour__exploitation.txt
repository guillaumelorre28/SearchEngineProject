Workers at McDonald’s restaurants in Malaysia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia> claim they earned as little as 60p 
an hour and were cheated out of months of salary, a Guardian investigation has 
found.

The workers allege they were subjected to months – and in some cases years – 
of exploitation by Human Connection HR, a labour supply company contracted by 
McDonald’s in Malaysia to provide workers to its restaurants in Kuala Lumpur.

The workers, who come from Nepal, say they had their passports confiscated, in 
contravention of Malaysian law.

They claim they were deceived about their wages and were charged additional 
fees when they arrived in Malaysia, resulting in a 25% deduction in their basic 
monthly salary. Over the course of working at McDonald’s, this equated to the 
loss of months of wages.

Unlike in its other major markets – including the UK and US – where McDonald’s 
operates through a franchise model, McDonald’s outlets in Malaysia are 
company-owned.

 The migrants also say that their salaries were not received on time, leaving 
them unable to buy food or send money home to their families.

“We didn’t have the money to eat because we were not paid regularly,” said one 
man, adding that some workers went on strike earlier this year in protest at 
late payment of wages. “How can we go to work on an empty stomach? I thought it 
was a good company and I would earn good money. Now my life is damaged. I feel 
that I have no future.”

 McDonald’s Malaysia said in an email that it had ended its contract with 
Human Connection. “At McDonald’s Malaysia, the welfare of staff is a top 
priority,” said the company. “Earlier this year, we became aware of certain 
circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were 
not in compliance with our standards. As a result, we have terminated our 
contract with them.”


The investigation, which comes just days after the Guardian exposed 
allegations of abuse among migrants making products for Samsung and Panasonic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/21/malaysia-forced-labour-casts-dark-shadow-over-electronics-industry>
 in industrial zones across the country, sheds further light on the malpractice 
of some labour supply agencies used by major international brands in Malaysia.

“We were not given our salary on time,” said another Nepalese worker. “When we 
went to meet the managers of McDonald’s to complain, they usually said we were 
not employed by McDonald’s and they are not responsible for anything. One of my 
friends even went to the McDonald’s manager crying after he heard news of his 
child’s death [at home in Nepal]. He asked him to ask for his passport [from 
Human Connection, so that he could attend the funeral,] but the McDonald’s 
manager said that he cannot do anything. I would rather die than go back to 
work at McDonald’s. I will never work there [again].”

The Guardian spoke to 15 Nepalese workers formerly employed at four McDonald’s 
restaurants in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. The men worked at McDonald’s at 
different times over the course of three years.

More than half said that they had been forced to run away from their jobs 
without their passports or back pay, entering the illegal work market in an 
attempt to make some money. This would leave them vulnerable to arrest and 
detention by the Malaysian authorities.

Others said they had been forced to pay their own way back to Nepal after 
their passports were not returned by Human Connection.

Some of the workers criticised McDonald’s for failing to respond to complaints 
of mistreatment by Human Connection while they were working in McDonald’s 
outlets.


They claim that they repeatedly informed the company about problems relating 
to wages, salary deductions and passports, but received no assistance.

“I complained about our salary to McDonald’s many times, and the branch 
manager … sent the message to McDonald’s headquarters,” said one worker. “[But] 
McDonald’s said they had already paid Human Connection.”

I expected to earn money here. But I’m leaving with nothing
Nepalese migrant worker 
The manager of one McDonald’s branch that previously employed some of the 
workers claims that the company’s headquarters in Malaysia were informed about 
the problems the men faced: “The labour supply company withheld two to three 
months’ wages. The workers only had a photocopy of their documents, but they 
should have had the original with them. We are humans. We tried to help them 
with food, but you can’t do it all the time.”

During their time working in McDonald’s restaurants, the men claim they were 
paid less than they were promised in Nepal. In some of their contracts it 
states that they would not have to pay the foreign worker levy, a charge placed 
on companies using migrant labour in Malaysia that is often passed on to the 
workers themselves. Payslips seen by the Guardian show that the levy was 
deducted, however, equating to a 25% reduction in their basic wages.

The workers also claim that they had their passports confiscated by the labour 
supply company on arrival in Malaysia, a pervasive but illegal practice that 
ties them to their employer and denies them the freedom to leave their job or 
the country.

“The supply company took our passports, but they will not send workers back to 
Nepal or give our passports back,” said one man formerly working at a 
McDonald’s restaurant. “Even those who finished the three-year contract cannot 
go home because they don’t have their passports.”


Another worker said: “Even when it is time to go, the company does not return 
your passport. I don’t know why … I asked to go home, but the company said they 
will not send me back.”

The workers who chose to return home have had to pay the equivalent of two 
months’ basic wages to a middleman to arrange the documents and paperwork 
needed to get them back to Nepal without their passports.

“I expected to earn money here,” said one. “But I’m leaving with nothing.”

The men also complained about the conditions they faced in the accommodation 
provided by Human Connection while they worked in McDonald’s restaurants.

The Guardian visited one squalid hostel with paint peeling off the damp walls. 
McDonald’s advertising banners were used as makeshift curtains. In one room, a 
McDonald’s trophy was propped up on a fan switch with “Best of the Best Kitchen 
Crew” printed on its base. At one point, the workers say, 18 men were crammed 
into the small flat, with most sleeping on mattresses on the floor. They shared 
one small, grimy toilet, which also passed as a washroom.

Firms profiting from their business in places like Malaysia can’t say they're 
unaware of issues facing migrant workers
Aidan McQuade, director, Anti-Slavery International 
In a statement, McDonald’s said: “While local employees make up the vast 
majority – more than 90% – of our workforce, we sometimes work with established 
recruitment agencies which employ foreign workers, and sub-contract a number of 
them to McDonald’s in Malaysia. These staff members are employees of the 
recruitment agency, not McDonald’s.

“McDonald’s Malaysia made repeated attempts with Human Connection HR to 
investigate and verify issues of non-compliance shared by the workers, raising 
our serious concerns through both verbal and written correspondence. Because 
the workers are not employees of McDonald’s, our efforts to address the issues 
were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald’s to assume responsibility 
for paying workers directly. In the interim, to assist, we authorised 
restaurants to provide food and provisions to workers affected while we worked 
to address the issue.

“Following the termination of our contract, the workers remain employees of 
Human Connection HR and as such we understand that they will either return to 
their home country or be redeployed to other businesses.”

Human Connection did not respond to a request for comment on the worker’s 
allegations.

Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, said businesses must no 
longer hide behind codes of conduct but should instead take proactive measures 
to ensure they are not profiting from exploited labour.

“The great tragedy about this kind of exploitation is that it is actually easy 
to fix,” he said. “Companies operating and profiting from their business in 
places like Malaysia can’t say that they are not aware of the issues facing 
migrant workers there. They need to take a proactive investigative approach to 
ensuring that, if they use labour supply companies, those companies are 
adhering to the law and corporate codes of conduct. It’s time for this to stop.”
