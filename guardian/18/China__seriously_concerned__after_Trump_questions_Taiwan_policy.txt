The Chinese government has warned Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> it is “seriously concerned” 
after the US president-elect indicated he might jettison a four-decade 
understanding with Beijing unless its leaders were prepared to strike a new 
“deal” with his administration.

In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, the president-elect said he saw no 
reason why the US should continuing abiding by the “One China” policy – under 
which Washington does not recogniseTaiwan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/taiwan> as a sovereign state – unless 
Beijing was prepared to enter into some kind of bargain.

“I don’t know why we have to be bound by a ‘One China’ policy unless we make a 
deal withChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> having to do with 
other things, including trade,” Trump told the channel.


Washington’s acceptance of the “One China” principle – according to which 
Taiwan is officially regarded as part of the same single Chinese nation as the 
mainland – has been a crucial part of the foundation of US-China relations 
since ties between the two countries were re-established by Richard Nixon and 
Mao Zedong in 1972.


Trump’s comments drew an angry riposte from Beijing. Geng Shuang, a spokesman 
for China’s foreign ministry, told reporters that bilateral ties and “the sound 
and steady growth of China-US relations” would be “out of the question” were 
Trump to turn away from the “One China” policy.

“We urge the incoming US administration and its leaders to fully recognise the 
sensitivity of the Taiwan question … [and] to properly deal with Taiwan-related 
matters in a prudent manner so as not to disrupt or damage the overall 
interests of the bilateral relationship,” Geng said, describing the “One China” 
principle as the “political bedrock” of ties between the two countries.

The question of Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a breakaway province that 
should one day be reunified with the mainland, was one of China’s “core 
interests”, the spokesman pointed out.

In a separate statement, the ministry cited Foreign Minister Wang Yi as 
warning during a trip to Switzerland against moves to damage the “one China” 
principle, having been asked by a reporter about Trump’s call with Tsai.

“China is paying close attention to developments,” Wang said. “I can clearly 
say that no matter whether the Tsai Ing-wen authority, any other person in the 
world, or any other force, if they try and damage the one China principle and 
harm China’s core interests, in the end they are lifting a rock only to drop it 
on their feet.”

Trump’s comments came less than a fortnight after he looked to have initiated 
a potentially damaging diplomatic row with Beijing byholding a telephone 
conversation with Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/03/china-donald-trumps-taiwan-phone-call-complaint-us>
, and subsequentlyattacking China on Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/a-storm-is-gathering-on-the-horizon-chinese-scholars-fret-about-trump>
.

In what was widely seen as an attempt to soothe tensions, Trump subsequently 
appointed the Iowa governor, Terry Branstad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/07/trump-administration-terry-branstad-ambassador-china>
 – a man China called “an old friend of the Chinese people” – as ambassador to 
Beijing.

Orville Schell, the head of the Centre on US-China Relations at New York’s 
Asia Society, said Trump’s latest comments – which the academic described as an 
“incredible provocation” – were the latest example of the billionaire’s 
contradictory moves towards China.

“He sometimes punches Beijing and he sometimes seems to reach out and hug 
them. The phone call to Tsai Ing-wen would be the former. Terry Branstad would 
be the latter. Now we have another uppercut,” he said of the Fox News interview.

Speaking on Sunday, Trump defended his protocol-shredding decision to talk to 
President Tsai on 2 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/03/trump-angers-beijing-with-provocative-phone-call-to-taiwan-president>
, the first such conversation between a US president or president-elect and a 
leader of the self-ruled island since ties between America and Taiwan were 
severed in 1979.


China considers Taiwan a renegade province and does not allow countries to 
maintain diplomatic relations with both Taipei and Beijing.


“I don’t want China dictating to me and this was a call put in to me,” Trump 
said. “It was a very nice call. Short. And why should some other nation be able 
to say I can’t take a call?”

“I think it actually would’ve been very disrespectful, to be honest with you, 
not taking it,” he added.

The president-elect also returned to some of the themes on which he criticised 
China during the election campaign 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/world/asia/china-donald-trump-fans.html>.

“We’re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation, with taxing us heavy 
at the borders when we don’t tax them, with building a massive fortress in the 
middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn’t be doing, and frankly with 
not helping us at all with North Korea,” he told Fox News.

“You have North Korea. You have nuclear weapons and China could solve that 
problem and they’re not helping us at all.”

 Trump speaks on Fox News on Sunday. 
Nick Bisley, an international relations expert from La Trobe University in 
Melbourne, said: “The signal Trump is sending to China is: ‘You are not going 
to push us around; you are not going to dictate terms; we are going to be the 
ones who dictate terms to you’. And he’s also signalling, whether deliberately 
or not, that there are no sacred cows in US foreign policy, whether in Asia or 
anywhere else.”

Bisley said Trump’s early moves would have China’s leaders, who had 
anticipated dealing with a predictable “Obama 3.0” under a Clinton 
administration, scratching their heads.

“I think they will be genuinely befuddled and just thinking: ‘How do we deal 
with this guy? What’s the playbook?’” he said. “The overall consequence of all 
of this is that it’s going to make the region a lot more uncertain and the 
temperature is going to be a lot higher.”

Li Yonghui, the head of the school of international relations at the Beijing 
Foreign Studies University, said Trump was “testing the water” with China 
before taking office next month.

“It fits with the logic of a businessman. But on this issue, he has really 
gone off in the wrong direction. If he doesn’t understand the nature of the 
Taiwan issue then sooner or later he will. Taiwan is not like other issues … 
China will not compromise on the Taiwan issue.

“If the US wants to change the ‘One-China’ policy, then it will shake the 
foundations of Sino-US relations. [The consequences] are hard to imagine,” the 
Chinese academic warned.


In an editorial <http://opinion.huanqiu.com/editorial/2016-12/9797239.html>, 
the Global Times, a fervently nationalistic party-run tabloid, said Trump was 
“as ignorant as a child” in the field of diplomacy and warned him the “one 
China” policy was “not for sale”.

The newspaper claimed Trump’s inexperience meant he was easily “influenced or 
even manipulated by hardliners around him”.

It said China needed “to launch a resolute struggle with him” and should be 
“prepared to accompany Trump on a rollercoaster ride” for Sino-US relations. 
“We must buckle up, as should others around the world,” it said.

Schell said it was hard to predict how Beijing might respond to Trump’s latest 
gambit.

“I don’t know what Beijing is going to make of this because they have always 
dealt with these very square, proper people like Obama and Hillary Clinton who 
have always sought to keep the US policy relatively constant. And here you have 
someone who is doing the absolute opposite,” he said.

“I think they will be very careful about responding because in a certain sense 
they are meeting a brinksman just like themselves … [and] I don’t know what a 
brinksman or a bully does when they meet another brinksman and a bully. 
[Violence] would be one option, but very often one of them backs down.”
