 The Adoration of the Shepherds. Photograph: The National Gallery London 
This powerfully realistic portrayal of the humble shepherds who came to see 
the new born Christ is palpably influenced by Caravaggio and was probably 
painted in Naples about two decades after he worked there. Who can have created 
this tough yet tender image of the Christmas story? It is a mystery, but Naples 
was under Spanish rule and as well as being Caravaggeian this resembles The 
Adoration of the Magi by Velazquez. A painting to open hearts.

One of the remarkable creations by Phyllis Posnick, US Vogue’s executive 
fashion editor whose styling we showcased this week. She remembers: “I liked 
the ‘Minnie Mouse couture’ look of this mask and brought it to [photographer] 
Irving Penn. He thought it was charming and imagined it on a ‘young woman 
wearing an old‐fashioned negligee.’”
