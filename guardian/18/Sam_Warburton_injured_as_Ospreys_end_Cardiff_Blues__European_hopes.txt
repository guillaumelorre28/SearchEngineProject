Sam Warburton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sam-warburton> gave Wales an 
injury scare ahead of their summer tour to New Zealand when he was taken off 
after 28 minutes of Cardiff Blues’ match against the Ospreys. The Blues 
coaching staff described the injury as a shoulder strain, something the Wales 
captain has suffered from a number of times before.

Warburton missed Wales tour to South Africa with a similar injury in 2014. 
Wales are already without Justin Tipuric, who stood in for Warburton as captain 
and No7 during the Six Nations, as he is on a break from rugby after suffering 
concussion against Italy in the tournament in April.

The Ospreys won the match at the Millennium Stadium 40-27, with tries from 
James King, Sam Underhill and two apiece for Hanno Dirkson and Rhys Webb giving 
them a bonus point that keeps their hopes of European Champions Cup 
qualification alive. The Blues, however, whose points came from Aled Summerhill 
and Josh Navidi tries plus five penalties and a conversion from Gareth 
Anscombe, can no longer qualify for next season’s competition.
