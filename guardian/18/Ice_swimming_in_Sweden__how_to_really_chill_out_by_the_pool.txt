Most winter tourists to Sweden choose to wrap up warm and take a sled or 
snowmobile ride – or watch the northern lights somewhere remote but close to a 
roaring fire. Or spend a night in the Ice Hotel. Not me. As I’m a regular 
winter swimmer in the UK, the obvious, if daunting, choice was to get into my 
swimming costume and plunge into icy water, courtesy of theInternational Winter 
Swimming Association <http://iwsa.world/>’s World Cup, which holds one of its 
five stages in Skellefteå, a small town in north Sweden.

Ice-swimming may be a niche sport but it is growing in popularity in the 
northern hemisphere: in the UK theBig Chill Swim in Windermere 
<http://www.chillswim.com/the-swims/big-chill-swim/>, the only World Cup stage 
held in the UK, took place on 6-7 February and attracted 1,000 competitors, 
despite only being in its the third year. The 2016 World Cup event in 
Skellefteå was a more modest affair, but still attracted more than 300 
competitors from 17 countries.

My flight landed in Luleå, a university town and port that’s a little more 
urban and glamorous than Skellefteå, which is 130km south of it. Facebook 
selected Luleå as the site for a large new hub because of the technology 
know-how of local graduatesand because it wouldn’t have to spend so much money 
on air conditioning for its servers. The town has snow for six months of the 
year.

Luleå’s Clarion Sense Hotel <http://www.clarionsense.se/en/> was my base for 
the night and before venturing out for some evening reconnaissance I checked 
out its Skybar restaurant – for some surprisingly tender reindeer, and sea 
buckthorn sorbet. Warm and full, I went out into the night snow to a local 
park, in the middle of which was an underground ice cave concert hall. I sat 
there, bundled up against the cold, on benches carved from ice, with glistening 
icy walls and snow flurries falling through ventilation holes, while a folk 
band played glowing instruments – carved out of ice. This wasthe brainchild of 
Canadian engineer and ice artist Tim Linhart 
<http://www.icemusic.se/sv/in-english/>, who spends eight weeks of the year 
(with his team) carving the auditorium out of ice, and another two months 
hosting concerts.

After a nervous, somewhat sleepless night, I headed to Skellefteå where 
preparations were under way for the start of the competition. The “pool” at 
Skellefteå is cut out of the ice that covers the river Skellefte and is 25 
metres long and four lanes wide. It took the organisers three days to create 
the hole using chainsaws, and it was also someone’s job to stand and poke the 
water at the edges to stop more ice from forming.

In ice-swimming, there are three races: a traditional 25m breaststroke, 50m 
freestyle and, for the particularly brave, 200m freestyle. The breaststroke is 
swum “head up” with a woolly hat on. Wearing a hat is theoretically warmer than 
not wearing one – but it’s more about making a statement than any practical 
benefit.

I signed a disclaimer saying (more or less) that if I had a heart attack it 
was my own fault – and waited anxiously for my heat. Because I was only brave 
enough to enter the 25m breaststroke I bought a comedy hat in the shape of a 
shark, which I jammed on over my swimming cap. This gained me instant friends. 
I chatted to fellow swimmers from Poland, Latvia, Finland, Sweden and the US, 
who were waiting around for their heats. I realised, too late, that they might 
have thought that the shark hat was a statement of my swimming prowess; it 
wasn’t.

When the time came for my heat we were marched down to the ice pool. When the 
air temperature is -3C and you are in your swimming costume you really don’t 
want to be hanging around – so the organisers’ swiftness and efficiency was 
appreciated. We lowered ourselves via steps at the end of each lane and once 
all competitors’ shoulders were below the water’s surface we were given our 
starting orders.

Before I could think about what I was doing I was swimming 25m with crowds 
cheering on. The water was 0.3C and beautifully needle cold and shocking. The 
race was over before I knew it. I felt exhilarated and relieved. Pink as a 
lobster I staggered up to the sauna brought in for the event where a Finnish 
woman gave me a sip of her flask of sweet, and very alcoholic, recovery drink. 
I sat and chattered excitedly with the other women from my heat.

 The ice pool cometh … 
Many of the town’s residents turned out to watch the event, lining the banks 
of the river, cheering swimmers on with the eerie and dull thud of thickly 
gloved hands clapping. After all the heats were over, the evening was spent at 
a post-competition party, eating and drinking, swapping stories and listening 
to a hilarious Finnish punk band dressed solemnly as Pierrots and playing 
traditional folk instruments.

I spent the following day warmly clothed and behaving like a conventional 
tourist: admiring Skellefteå’s 17th-century clapperboard houses nestled, 
picture-perfect, between tall pine trees and all topped with snow.

Lunch was at Värdshuset Nordanågården <http://www.skellefte.net/nordanagarden/>
 in the old part of town where I grazed on several types of delicately cured 
sweet salmon and reindeer cold meats, followed by a rich moose stew, all for 
around £8. This part of Skellefteå is beautiful and, blanketed with thick white 
snow, very quiet. My guide Anna-Karin told me how it was also beautiful during 
the summer but I was captivated by the clean, white, glistening silence.
