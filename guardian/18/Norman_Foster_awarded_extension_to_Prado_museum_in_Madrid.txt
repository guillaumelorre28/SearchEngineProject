The British architect Norman Foster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/norman-foster> has been selected to 
renovate a 17th century building to house an extension of Madrid’s Prado museum.

In a joint project with Spain’s Carlos Rubio, Foster will refurbish the Hall 
of Realms, not far from the main museum in the centre of the Spanish capital. 
The project is estimated to cost around €30m (£25m).

In a statement on Thursday, the museum said Foster and Rubio’s proposal 
“respects and values what is already there, adjusting it to the necessities of 
our times”.

The Hall of Realms is one of the only remaining buildings from the Buen Retiro 
palace, commissioned by Spain’s King Felipe IV as a second residence, and 
pre-dates the Prado which opened in 1819.

The Prado acquired the building, once Spain’s Army Museum, last year with the 
aim of increasing its exhibition space.

Foster and Rubio’s firms plan to open up the southern facade, creating a giant 
atrium that will give the impression that the building is semi-open, while 
keeping its original balconies.

“A new roof will harvest energy from integrated solar cells, give natural 
light to the galleries below and cantilever as a shade to protect the southern 
facade,” Foster and Partners said in a statement.

Foster, who led the bidding team, said he was honoured to contribute to the 
next phase of the expansion of the Prado.

The 81-year-old architect has worked on projects all over the world. His firm 
is responsible for the Millennium Bridge in London, a winery on France’s 
premium Chateau Margaux estate, airports in Panama, Jordan and Hong Kong, and 
the remodelled Camp Nou stadium, home to Barcelona football club.

Rubio founded Rubio Architectural in 2014. The firm works mainly on projects in
Spain <https://www.theguardian.com/world/spain>, but also in Russia and Saudi 
Arabia.
