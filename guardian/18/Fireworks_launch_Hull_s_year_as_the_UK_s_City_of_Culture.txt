A huge audience packed in to Queen Victoria Square to watch as stories of the 
city and its people over the last 70 years were projected on to nearby 
buildings.

McAllister said: “We’re finally going to share our secret. If you’re from Hull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hull>, we always knew we had culture, it’s 
just the world didn’t know, so the secret’s out. Finally we’ve had to let them 
in. In a way we’ve kind of had these doors up to keep everybody out of our 
culture.

“It’s just for us, we’ve had it as a subculture but, damn it, we’ve finally 
had to open the door to the international world and let them in. They can come 
and see what we’ve been enjoying.”

 From the devastating bombing during the second world war, to the 
disappearance of its fishing fleet in the 1970s due to the cod wars, to the 
decimation of its shipping industry, Hull has struggled during the last seven 
decades. Hull city council leader Stephen Brady called it “a city that had lost 
its confidence”.

But he believes Hull’s tenure as UK City of Culture 2017 will breathe new life 
into the city. Hull is the second city to be given this honour, following 
Derry-Londonderry four years ago. It was selected in2013 from a shortlist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/nov/19/uk-city-culture-2017-leicester-hull-dundee-swansea-bay>
 which included Dundee, Leicester and Swansea Bay.

More than £30m is being spent on the year’s events and £25m has been invested 
in revamping the city centre and refurbishing the FerensArt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/artanddesign> Gallery and the city’s 
main theatre.

This, Brady says, is an attempt for the city to entice new businesses and 
employers who will bring their staff with them and create more jobs.The city 
recently secured a £310m commitment by the German-owned firm Siemens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/01/siemens-310m-hull-plant-will-take-windfarm-technology-to-new-level>
 to build new offshore wind turbines in the city, creating up to 1,000 jobs.

proud working city’

“We did it with Siemens and we can do it again. We want people to stay here, 
we want there to be opportunities. This year is so important in so many ways, 
we need it to breathe life into Hull and keep it buoyant for future 
generations,” he said.

Brady, a former butcher’s boy who grew up in a three-bedroomed terraced house 
with his eleven siblings, says it was about time to change the conversation 
about his home city.

He said: “Hull is a city like no other, it is more like a large village. 

“There is also the fact that it is the end of the line in terms of road and 
rail networks. There is essentially nowhere beyond, which gives it a very 
isolated feel. We needed something to keep people here, bring in new talent, 
jobs, employers. Getting this City of Culture status has been as sweet as a 
nut.”

Celebrations began in earnest on Sunday night with the official opening 
spectacular. Thousands of people lined the waterfront for a fireworks display 
to mark the beginning of Made In Hull, as its historic buildings become 
backdrops for projections illustrating and celebrating more than 70 years of 
the city’s history.

The crowd in the city centre square – where one of eight art installations 
will be located for the next week – chanted a countdown before a projection of 
a propeller was beamed on to theFerens Art Gallery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/nov/20/hull-uk-city-of-culture-in-pictures>
 building.

The crowd then fell silent as they watched Hull’s history, from pilot Amy 
Johnson’s solo flight to Australia in 1930 to the present day, projected around 
the square.

Other installations in the Made In Hull event include Hullywood Icons, 
featuring local people recreating images from classic films, and a multi-screen 
and sound installation recreating the club scene in 90s Yorkshire.

Sunday may be the official opening but the buzz began over the summer, when US 
artist Spencer Tunick convinced 3,200 locals to strip naked and have themselves 
painted blue for his trademark photographs around Hull’s landmarks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jul/09/sea-of-hull-by-spencer-tunick-in-pictures>
 celebrating the city’s relationship with the sea. Other events planned over 
the year include a visit by the Turner prize, plus a one-off gig from David 
Bowie’s old backing band, the Spiders from Mars.

Brady, 70, who has been council leader since 2011, admits that some may have 
trouble coming to grips with some of the “wackier” installations, but he will 
be gritting his teeth and trying new things.

Hull has ambitions to become the next Liverpool, which reinvented itself 
following its year as European Capital of Culture in 2008.The status earned the 
city bumper visitor numbers and a multimillion-pound boost to its economy. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/mar/11/liverpool-profited-from-being-culture-capital>
 The festival year saw 9.7m visitors to the city, an increase of 34%, and 
generated £753.8m for the economy.

Brady said: “The perception of Liverpool was forever changed after its city of 
culture year and that’s what we are hoping for here. We don’t want to return to 
our sleepy old times again – we want others to say it is a wonderful place that 
they will return to again and again.”

So far, there have been upgrades to streets and public buildings in Hull city 
centre. The improvements include the makeover of Humber Street in the old Fruit 
Market, where galleries and other artistic businesses are based. A £700,000, 
350-seat outdoor theatre will also be built in the city’s disused Central Dry 
Dock.

One of its most famous sons, the poet Philip Larkin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/philiplarkin>, once said it is “a city that 
is in the world, yet sufficiently on the edge of it to have a different 
resonance”.

Brady said: “We are not a people that shout loudly or sing our own praises 
like others. We quietly go about our own way. But now those barriers are coming 
down and we will not disappoint.”
