North: Identity, Photography, Fashion

An exhibition that explores the myriad ways in which the north of England has 
inspired the wider world in terms of fashion, music and youth culture. It asks 
whether the north of England has a particular aesthetic as well as an attitude? 
Helping provide the answer are photographers such asNick Knight

,Corinne Day <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/corinne-day>, Jason Evans

<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jeremy-deller>. The theme of 
masculinity will feature strongly.

Michael Andrews

This is a welcome fresh look at one of the most intriguing British painters of 
the 20th century.Michael Andrews 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/michael-andrews-649>, who died in 1995, was 
a poetic realist who saw things from unexpected and eerie points of view. His 
1974 paintingLights VII: A Shadow 
<http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/a4/49/b2/a449b2bde3629bd32ce58805e34ae6ce.jpg>
, a cool depiction of the shadow of a balloon moving across a beach, is one of 
the defining works of art of its age; a strange and sad image of something we 
know only from the light it blots out. Who is in the balloon and where is it 
going? Is art itself a kind of shadow? This and other major works by Andrews 
ought to make this a revelatory encounter with an exciting artist.

Amie Siegel: Strata

American artist Amie Siegel’s much anticipated first UK solo show takes us 
from the world’s deepest underground marble quarry to the stone’s destination 
in Manhattan’s skyscrapers in a complex film about place and material, work and 
history. A second film rummages through Sigmund Freud’s collection of totemic 
objects, as though it were itself a kind of subconscious. Always a delight, 
Siegel’s films are mesmerising, complex affairs filled with mystery and wonder.

Life of Clay: Experimental Practice at Grymsdyke Farm

In a group of farm sheds in the quaint Buckinghamshire village of Lacey Green, 
an unlikely laboratory of robotic arms, potters’ wheels and sausage-making 
machines has been busy squeezing the future out of lumps of clay. From 
intricate latticework screens to elephantine columns and finely glazed 
ceramics, groups of architects, students and researchers atGrymsdyke Farm 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/aug/08/clay-robotics-architecture-chilterns-farm>
 have been investigating the realm where earthy local materials and high-tech 
computer-controlled manufacturing collide – and the results of their latest 
architectural experiments will be on show at this intriguing exhibition in

COUM Transmissions (Hull UK City of Culture)

Founded in Hull by Cosey Fanni Tutti and Genesis P-Orridge in the late 1960s, 
COUM Transmissions have become a countercultural legend. Celebrating the 
renegade band of art provocateurs who later morphed into the no less 
confrontationalThrobbing Gristle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/throbbing-gristle>, this is the first major 
survey of their rackety lives and art. Their influential performances and 
exhibitions, music and lifestyles were chaotic and sexually provocative, 
leading one Conservative MP to call them “wreckers of civilisation”, which is 
good enough for me.

Tim Noble and Sue Webster

This spiky artistic duo have talent to burn and a flippant insouciance that 
can make it seem they are happy to see it in flames. Their new show sees them 
full of punk spunk. It’s called Sticks With Dicks and Slits and consists of 
colossal sculptures that gleefully reduce the human form to graffiti 
essentials. These anatomically explicit self-portraits were modelled with bits 
of wire before being made big in bronze. Once gain,Webster and Noble 
<http://www.timnobleandsuewebster.com/> display their innate graphic ability. 
Have they rediscovered a primal and primitive art of the body? Or is it just a 
laugh?

Mark Wallinger MARK

Punning on his name and leaving his mark wherever he goes, Wallinger splits 
and doubles, mirrors and twins himself with simultaneous shows in Scotland. 
Recent Rorschach blot paintings form the basis of exhibitions that put the 
artist in a bear suit and the I back into the id. Wallinger can be funny, 
poignant, painful, perverse and political, sometimes all at the same time. He 
once performed as the back half of a pantomime horse, and has his nose deep 
into British culture. He really deserves a huge museum retrospective. For now, 
this’ll have to do.

Robots


Only now is technological reality catching up with the robots that have so 
long haunted science fiction.Leonardo da Vinci 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/davinci>, whose art is arguably one 
huge experiment in science fiction, made a mechanical monster to impress the 
king of France in the early 1500s. At the start of the 20th century, artists 
and writers became fascinated by the post-human: in 1913-15,Jacob Epstein 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Epstein> imagined a terrifying droid in 
his sculpture The Rock Drill, and in 1920 the Czech writer Karel Capek wrote 
RUR (Rossum’s Universal Robots). This exhibition has everything from 
Renaissance automata to the latest attempts to replace ourselves.

Vanessa Bell

The life of this quintessential artist of the Bloomsbury group 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/books/2016/feb/12/vanessa-bell-review-biography-bloomsbury-group-virginia-woolf>
 in early 20th-century-Britain has often eclipsed her works. Books, films and 
TV serials have told of her loves, friendships and her relationship with her 
sister Virginia Woolf. Yet how good an artist was she? This survey of Bell’s 
paintings offers a chance to look seriously at her work. Inspired by French 
modern art yet faithful to a very English preoccupation with the depiction of 
reality, her paintings are vivid, sensual and civilised. Perhaps too civilised 
– let’s go along and see.

David Hockney

Nearing 80, the Bradford-born one-time symbol of Swinging London has been a 
painter of swimmers and California pools, heat-struck canyons and damp 
Yorkshire wolds. A terrific graphic artist and etcher, portraitist, 
photographer, opera designer and sometime video artist, Hockney is celebrated 
in the largest exhibition of his long and varied career. It promises to be both 
celebration and a mixed bag of his manners and preoccupations.

Volcanoes

Charred papyruses from a Roman villa buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in 
AD79 are among the fascinations of this history of volcanoes in science and 
art. The first volcanologist was probablyEmpedocles 
<https://www.britannica.com/biography/Empedocles>, an ancient Greek philosopher 
who is said to have dived into Mount Etna in a fatal experiment. The modern 
study of volcanoes started in the 18th century, when artists includingJoseph 
Wright of Derby <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wright_of_Derby> painted 
spectacular images of Vesuvius spewing fire and William Hamilton published his 
sumptuously illustrated scientific work Campi Flegrei. In more recent times,
Andy Warhol <https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/andywarhol> painted 
Vesuvius. This should be hot stuff.

America After the Fall

Grant Wood’s classic 1930 painting American Gothic 
<http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/6565> is possibly the single most 
recognised work of American art with its unsmiling duo in front of their 
church-like wooden house. It leaves the US for the first time to appear in this 
exhibition, which explores how the Great Depression reshaped American art. The 
generation who found fame as abstract expressionists a decade later survived 
the 30s working for public art programmes. Realism and Americana were their 
obsessions in this time of struggle and despair.Jackson Pollock 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/jackson-pollock> and Edward Hopper 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/hopper> are among the stars of what 
should be a haunting journey through a broken America.

Deutsche Börse photography prize

The Deutsche Börse shortlist often betrays the curatorial bias of the judging 
panel – one artist this year and three curators – more than it illuminates the 
state of contemporary photography. This year is no exception, withSophie Calle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/sophie-calle>, Dana Lixenberg 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Lixenberg>, Awoiska van der Molen 
<http://www.awoiska.nl/pages/page.php?page=home> and the duo, Taiyo Nontaro and 
Nico Krebs <http://tonk.ch/> vying for the award. How you pit one against the 
other is anyone’s guess, but van der Molen’s formally beautiful nocturnal 
landscapes are quiet and haunting, while Lixenberg’s epic project from the 
troubled Watts district of Los Angeles is social documentary on a grand and 
moving scale. Calle will probably swing it, though.

Madonnas and Miracles

Museums distort the Italian Renaissance by treating its – admittedly gorgeous 
– creations as pure “art” separated from life. Decorated trays that were made 
specifically to serve food to women who had just given birth are hung up 
vertically as “paintings”. Bedroom chests have their paintings stripped off to 
hang as high-cultural trophies. This exciting exhibition puts Renaissance art 
back in the homes of merchants and their families with a rich mix of household 
objects and paintings that portray home life. It is a trip to a time when you 
might have aBotticelli <https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/botticelli> 
by your bed and get water from aDonatello 
<http://www.biography.com/people/donatello-21032601> fountain.

The American Dream

Pop art was about “all the great modern things”, Andy Warhol 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/andywarhol> said, but it also 
unleashed new creativity in the time-hallowed tradition of printmaking. Warhol 
himself pioneered a new approach to silkscreening andRobert Rauschenberg 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/robert-rauschenberg> took it up in 
his powerful montages.Jasper Johns 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/johns> uses printing to meditate on 
the nature of copying and memory. This exhibition of American art in prints 
begins with these giants and comes to date withKara Walker 
<http://www.biography.com/people/kara-walker-37225#synopsis>, Julie Mehretu 
<http://whitecube.com/artists/julie_mehretu/> and Ed Ruscha 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/ed-ruscha>. It ambitiously tries to 
tell not just the story of American art but American society from JFK to Trump.

Michelangelo and Sebastiano

Two major collaborations, the Pietà 
<https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_(Sebastiano_del_Piombo)#/media/File:Sebastiano_del_piombo,_piet%C3%A0.jpg>
 for San Francesco in Viterbo (c 1512–16), and theRaising of Lazarus 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raising_of_Lazarus_(Sebastiano_del_Piombo)#/media/File:Sebastiano_del_Piombo,_The_Raising_of_Lazarus.jpg>
 (c 1517–19), painted for the Cathedral of Narbonne, are the centerpieces of an 
exhibition devoted to the intimate friendship and artistic collaboration 
between Michelangelo and Sebastiano del Piombo. The younger Venetian artist 
arrived in Rome in 1511, and their relationship continued, often at long 
distance, until an acrimonious falling-out in 1534. Art and life, eh?

The Japanese House: Architecture and Life After 1945

One house looks like a little bookcase, its shelves held up on impossibly thin 
toothpick columns. Others look like gnarled concrete caves, or precipitous 
climbing frames, or enclosures of screens and curtains that are barely there at 
all. Japanese domestic architecture of the last 70 years has seen some of the 
most experimental and imaginative structures ever built, over 50 of which will 
be brought to life in this fascinating exhibition.

Queer British Art 1861-1967

Queer identities and everyday lives, erotic images and queer aesthetics are 
the focus of this wide-ranging show, which takes us from the mid-19th century 
to the decriminalisation of male homosexuality in England and Wales in 1967. 
Mixing the personal and the political, and including music hall and theatre 
design, private ephemera and the door to Oscar Wilde’s cell in Reading jail, 
Queer British Art follows changing definitions and attitudes to sexuality and 
gender, stories of repression and of celebration. Will it go far enough?

Grand Tour: Documenta; Venice Biennale; Münster Sculpture Project

We are hyperventilating already at the thought of the forthcoming Documenta 
14, taking place both in Athens and Kassel in Germany. The five-yearly 
exhibition’s often opaque polemics frequently act as a deterrent, while the art 
itself rarely fails. The 57th edition of the Venice Biennale, curated by 
Christine Macel, will be titled Viva Arte Viva. No big theme then, but lots of 
artists.Phyllida Barlow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/28/phyllida-barlow-artist-success-2017-venice-biennale>
 will be filling the British Pavilion, Rachel Maclean’s mad films represent 
Scotland and James Richards will be doing it for Wales. More focused and always 
a delight, the 10-yearly Münster Sculpture Project, an accumulation of new and 
earlier commissions, fills the city and kicks off in June.

Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains

Years before Damien Hirst put a shark in a tank, Pink Floyd 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/music/pinkfloyd> sent inflatable pigs floating 
above Battersea power station. The artistic ambitions of this operatic rock 
group, who evolved from psychedelia to sociopolitical rage, have a vivid visual 
dimension. As well as those pigs, they worked with cartoonistGerald Scarfe 
<http://www.geraldscarfe.com/> to create the epic imagery of their concept 
album The Wall, and put a prism onDark Side of the Moon 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/aug/26/dark-side-moon-pink-floyd>
 to create a masterpiece of pop art. Early on, their light shows used 
spectacular druggy effects. When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse out 
of the corner of my eye.

Design and California go together like Charles and Ray Eames, or the swimming 
pool and the glass-walled villa. But what’s been happening since the glory days 
of mid-century modernism? This ambitious exhibition picks up the story in the 
1960s, charting how the Golden State pioneered tools of personal liberation, 
from LSD to skateboards and iPhones, bringing together political posters and 
self-driving cars, and exploring how designers in the Bay Area are shaping our 
everyday lives.

What makes art popular and what makes a popular art? Populism is a tough card

<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/grayson-perry>’s roles and personae – 
cross-dressing, Turner prize-winning potter and analyst of masculinity, TV

him a popular and enduring cultural presence. Perry the artist and the art

This imaginative artist <http://aleksandramir.info/> is obsessed with the 
dream of space travel. In her latest homage to humanity’s stellar destiny, she 
has created a 200-metre tapestry that tells the story of our journeys into 
space – real and imagined, past, present and future. The similarity of her 
project to theBayeux tapestry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry> 
is no coincidence, for the makers of this great medieval artwork wove an image 
of Halley’s comet into it – one of the oldest astronomical depictions in art. 
Mir has worked with a team of young people to create her optimistic history of 
our urge to go beyond Earth.

runs along Exhibition Road, the V&A’smost ambitious project in 100 years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/11/vanda-underground-extension-plan-permission>
 will open this summer. Designed by Amanda Levete Architects, it will provide

new courtyard paved with shimmering porcelain tiles in a nod to the decorative 
ceramics in the museum’s collection, and the sgraffito frieze of Aston Webb’s 
original buildings, revealed for the first time since it was built in 1873. The 
V&A’s Porter Gallery will also be hosting Plywood, an encyclopaedic show about 
the diverse applications of this humble laminated material, from its earliest 
use by ancient Egyptian craftsmen to groundbreaking 20th-century designs. 
Full-scale installations will include a 1913 Deperdussin Monocoque plane 
dangling from the dome, and an office designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.

Louvre Abu Dhabi <http://louvreabudhabi.ae/en/Pages/home.aspx>

Hovering over the water like an upturned colander on the edge of Abu Dhabi’s 
£18bn Saadiyat Island, the Louvre’s spectacular Gulf outpost will finally open 
in 2017. Ten years in the making, the complex has been designed by French 
architectJean Nouvel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/15/jean-nouvel-architecture-is-still-an-art-sometimes>
 as a city-sized cluster of buildings rising out of sea, covered with a 
gigantic woven metal dome that will cast an ever-changing “rain of light” over 
the spaces beneath. Originally intended to be one of many such outposts, 
including the Guggenheim, it may well end up standing alone: the others have 
yet to even begin construction.
