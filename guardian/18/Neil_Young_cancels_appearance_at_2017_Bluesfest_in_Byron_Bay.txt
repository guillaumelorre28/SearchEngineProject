The musician was scheduled to headline the five-day festival in April, playing 
a three-hour set on Good Friday with his latest backing group Promise of the 
Real.

Friday single day tickets are now available for refund, but Bluesfest is 
urging ticket holders to stay tuned for further announcements of new headlining 
artists. Three-day tickets are not available for refund or reconfiguration at 
this stage, and Bluesfest has confirmed there will be no refunds for five-day 
tickets.

Young’s management has not released a statement regarding the cancellation, 
but ina Facebook post from Bluesfest 
<https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=bluesfest%20byron%20bay>, festival 
director Peter Noble relayed the news with “a heavy heart”.


“Although I have been aware of this as a possibility for a couple of weeks 
now, I have been appealing to Neil’s management for him to play the confirmed 
concert. Unfortunately, this is now not going to happen,” Noble said.

“Whilst details for the cancellation remain sketchy, from what I can gather 
Neil has decided to take 2017 off from touring.” There are no dates currently 
listed for 2017 on Neil Young’s website.


Noble continued: “I have no reason to believe this is due to any illness, I 
have been advised he is tired from recent touring, and I surmise wants to have 
some down time.”

Bluesfest had its own contract with Neil Young’s representatives, independent 
of Frontier Touring; the festival had paid the deposit, and had full permission 
to announce the performance.

Noble said they are in negotiations with “other great artists” to play in 
Young’s place.

“I understand that no one can replace Neil Young 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/neilyoung>, and that there will be 
disappointment as a result of his cancelling ... we are very disappointed at 
making this announcement.

“I feel I have done everything I can, to cause the concert to be performed.

“We value our audience, and their assumption, that when buying their ticket, 
they should have an expectation the advertised performance will occur. In this 
case, that has not occurred, and I apologise, even though the events were out 
of my control.

“I want to wish Neil Young the very best and what he is doing for First 
Nations People at Standing Rock. We look forward to presenting him soon at 
Bluesfest.”

Bluesfest, which takes place on the Easter long weekend on 120 hectares at 
Tyagarah Tea Tree Farm, is among the largest in Australia music festivals, with 
capacity for 100,000 people.
