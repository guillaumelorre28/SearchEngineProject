Lee said in a statement: “I have always been fascinated by the Chinese and 
Indian cultures which are so philosophical and rich in tradition and morality. 
Monkey Master will be unique in how it interweaves Chinese and Indian myth to 
create a hero that will entertain fans across the world with his martial arts 
skills and unstoppable superpowers.”


Devarajan added: “The story will take place between ancient and modern-day 
China andIndia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> as the myth of monkey 
warriors, known to both cultures, come together in the creation of a modern-day 
superhero.”

According to producers, no cast has yet been hired, but a “western director” 
is likely, with a shoot starting at the end of 2017.

The Monkey Master project follows the announcement that a “Kingsman-style” 
70s-set biopic of Lee
