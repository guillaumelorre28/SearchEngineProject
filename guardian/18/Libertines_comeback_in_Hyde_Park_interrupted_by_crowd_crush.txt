Pete Doherty <https://www.theguardian.com/music/petedoherty> and Carl Barat 
produced a typically chaotic performance as the Libertines returned to England 
for the first time since their reunion.

The Libertines <https://www.theguardian.com/music/libertines>, playing at the 
latest British Summer Time gig in Hyde Park in London, were interrupted 
part-way through their second song, Boys in the Band, when the 60,000-strong 
crowd were asked to spread out due to a surge as the indie rockers opened.

Doherty made an impromptu appearance on drums during the first 10-minute 
interlude, playing percussion on a rendition of the White Stripes' Seven Nation 
Army and then strumming his guitar to the Foundations' Build Me Up Buttercup.

The audience were asked to stop throwing fireworks and flares during the first 
few minutes of the set.

Doherty also used one of very few interactions with the audience to pay 
tribute to Queens Park Rangers football club, the Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, 
and Gerry Conlon – who as one of theGuildford Four 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/guildford-four> was wrongly imprisoned for IRA 
pub bombings in 1974 and died last month – during a hit-filled set, the band's 
first in the capital for more than four years.

Barat and Doherty put their once much-discussed personal differences aside as 
they frequently shared a microphone and embraced mid-set as the sun went down.

The set included crowd favourites such as Can't Stand Me Now, Don't Look Back 
into the Sun and What a Waster before further interruptions – mid-song – as 
Barat was instructed to request that fans stop climbing the towers of the PA 
system.

A singalong of the pre-school staple the Hokey Cokey closed the show.

The band also used the gig to announce two further London concerts, at 
Alexandra Palace on 27-28 September.
