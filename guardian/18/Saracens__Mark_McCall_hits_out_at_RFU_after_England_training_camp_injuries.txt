Mark McCall, the director of rugby of the European and Premiership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/premiership> champions Saracens, has hit out 
at the timing of this week’s England training camp in Brighton, at which two 
players have suffered long-term injuries. He said he was “flabbergasted” that 
it was being held less than two weeks before the start of the European 
Champions Cup and questioned why the clubs were not consulted before it was put 
in the calendar.

 and the Bath wing Anthony Watson returned to his clubwith a broken jaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/anthony-watson-out-of-england-autumn-internationals-with-broken-jaw-bath-rugby-union>
. Both players will know on Friday exactly how long they will be out after 
seeing specialists, but neither will be involved in England’s autumn 
international campaign and they are facing the prospect of not playing again 
this year.

This week’s camp, which followed one in August, was arranged as part of the 
new eight-year elite player agreement between the clubs and theRugby Football 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugby-football-union>. In return for 
more than £25m a year, Premiership Rugby agreed, among other changes, that the 
national head coach would have extra training camps in October and in January, 
a month before the start of the autumn series and Six Nations respectively. 
Both are Champions Cup months.

“Injuries can happen in training sessions,” said McCall. “We do not have 
control over the contest of England’s camps, nor should we. What I would prefer 
to talk about is that, from my club’s point of view, Premiership Rugby could 
have fought harder as to when these camps were situated [in the season 
calendar]. We would like to have been involved in that discussion and to have 
one 10 days before the first Champions Cup games is flabbergasting.

“It seems strange that the clubs were not consulted and we have got to fight 
our corner in this. The directors of rugby in the Premiership should at least 
be asked when they think the England training days should be. It was a done 
deal in the calendar and when I raised an objection to it, there was surprise 
that there should be any problem. There are competing needs and Premiership 
Rugby should have some non-negotiables.

England suffer double injury blow before autumn internationals

“Premiership Rugby need to be careful chasing all this money if it comes at 
the expense of the clubs who need to be strong and fight their corner as the 
RFU will fight theirs for the international game. I was part of a system in 
Ireland where the Pro 12 became a bit devalued because the bigger international 
players did not play for their teams on a consistent basis. We already have a 
league where our best players do not play for half of the campaign. That is a 
big enough thing but to have them away before a game as big as Wasps on Sunday 
and 10 days before the Champions Cup is not ideal.”

Saracens <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens> open their defence of 
the Champions Cup a week on Saturday at Toulon, winners of the tournament for 
the three previous seasons. “We normally have a two-week preparation before our 
opening game in Europe, working hard in the first and tapering off in the 
second,” said McCall. “We were not able to do that this week because so many 
players were away. I understand England need time with their squad, but we 
would have preferred it to happen after the two European rounds. It seems 
madness to me that we are playing Wasps [the Premiership leaders] this Sunday 
and, at a time when everyone is talking about player welfare, our England 
internationals have had a tough Monday and Tuesday. We have had to be careful 
with them since they returned and that compromises your preparations, unless 
you are mad.”

The club’s England second row George Kruis did not train on Thursday because 
of a back strain, but the outside-half Owen Farrell, who has not played since 
the summer tour to Australia because of back and hip problems, took part for 45 
minutes. “It is a case of when he can do all the things he needs to,” said 
McCall. “Then he will play, but while he is kicking out of hand he has not 
place-kicked yet and I do not know if he will be ready for Toulon.”
