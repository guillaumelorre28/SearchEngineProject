Pontus Jansson, who had a pretty decent game, says that he’d have taken a 
point before the game, and that was certainly how it looked from the way they 
started the game. But they looked a better side than Villa, especially once 
Pablo Hernandez came on, and must wonder how they’d have done if they’d gone 
for it from the start.

Villa, meanwhile, were much improved following the arrival of Adomah and 
Gestede. I can see why it’s tempting to keep them in reserve, the latter 
especially, but the team were so much better it must give Steve Bruce pause.

Full-time: Aston Villa 1-1 Leeds United

So, there we go. Those last ten minutes were pretty good fun, the rest of the 
game not so much. Villa retain the only remaining unbeaten home record in the 
league, moving up one place into 9th; Leeds go above Huddersfield into 4th.

90+3 min Chester slides in as Sako dashes down the line, tipping the ball into 
touch and cleaning his man out for bonus points. Oddly, he’s booked.

90+1 min A scramble in the Villa box leads to a pair of desperate blocks, 
before Villa break through Kodjia, alone at inside-left. He veers inside and 
shoots, the ball flying just wide of the far post.

90 min “New York-based villa fan here,” says David Bertram. “Woeful. Surely 
middle of the road Premiership teams will be looking at Kodjia soon?”

And as I paste that, he breaks into the box after playing a one-two off 
Gestede and skirting Jansson on his inside. But the ball bounces up for him and 
he’s forced to shoot from an unnatural position, allowing Green to dive in 
front of him and take one on the chest.

As for Kodjia, he’ll be off if Villa don’t go up and perhaps even then. On the 
plus side, you can just goLuger’s <https://peterluger.com/> and forget about it.

88 min Or can Leeds now get a winner? Amavi, the £25m pound man, has had a 
stinker tonight, and he dithers on the ball as it runs away from him, hoping to 
shield it and turn. But Sako chases him down, snaffles possession and breaks 
into the box - before Amavi, doing brilliantly to redeem himself, slides in to 
block the shot, which loops up, hits the bar and bounces clear.

GOAL! Aston Villa 1-1 Leeds United (Kodjia pen, 86)

That’s how to take pressure penalty, battered into the left of the net, 
two-thirds of the way up. Very well done, and can Villa now get a winner?

PENALTY TO VILLA!

83 min Why didn’t Villa try this earlier? They’re putting balls into the box 
and causing panic in the Leeds defence. And from once such cross, Gestede goes 
up, Cooper knocks it away from him with his hands, and Roger East does nothing! 
But his lino corrects him, Cooper is booked, and can Villa level things?

80 min Adomah teases Berardi and whips a cross around him, looking for 
Gestede; Cooper does brilliantly to hurl himself at it and head behind. The 
corner is then punched clear by Green, but eventually the ball ends up with 
Adomah again, on the left this time, and he cross to the far post, forcing 
another desperate defensive header. This time, the corner is properly cleared.

58 min Leeds win another  corner, and in the absence of Dallas, they go short,

Our match report from Villa Park:

Jonathan Kodjia spot-kick helps Aston Villa save point against Leeds
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/29/aston-villa-leeds-united-championship-match-report> 
Anyway, I reckon that’s us. Have good nights all, and happy new year. Bye! 
 
Pontus Jansson, who had a pretty decent game, says that he’d have taken a 
point before the game, and that was certainly how it looked from the way they 
started the game. But they looked a better side than Villa, especially once 
Pablo Hernandez came on, and must wonder how they’d have done if they’d gone 
for it from the start.

Villa, meanwhile, were much improved following the arrival of Adomah and 
Gestede. I can see why it’s tempting to keep them in reserve, the latter 
especially, but the team were so much better it must give Steve Bruce pause.
 
So, there we go. Those last ten minutes were pretty good fun, the rest of the 
game not so much. Villa retain the only remaining unbeaten home record in the 
league, moving up one place into 9th; Leeds go above Huddersfield into 4th.
 
90+3 min Chester slides in as Sako dashes down the line, tipping the ball into 
touch and cleaning his man out for bonus points. Oddly, he’s booked.
 
90+1 min A scramble in the Villa box leads to a pair of desperate blocks, 
before Villa break through Kodjia, alone at inside-left. He veers inside and 
shoots, the ball flying just wide of the far post.
 
90 min There shall be four added minutes.
 
90 min “New York-based villa fan here,” says David Bertram. “Woeful. Surely 
middle of the road Premiership teams will be looking at Kodjia soon?”

And as I paste that, he breaks into the box after playing a one-two off 
Gestede and skirting Jansson on his inside. But the ball bounces up for him and 
he’s forced to shoot from an unnatural position, allowing Green to dive in 
front of him and take one on the chest.

As for Kodjia, he’ll be off if Villa don’t go up and perhaps even then. On the 
plus side, you can just goLuger’s <https://peterluger.com/> and forget about it.

 
88 min Or can Leeds now get a winner? Amavi, the £25m pound man, has had a 
stinker tonight, and he dithers on the ball as it runs away from him, hoping to 
shield it and turn. But Sako chases him down, snaffles possession and breaks 
into the box - before Amavi, doing brilliantly to redeem himself, slides in to 
block the shot, which loops up, hits the bar and bounces clear.

That’s how to take pressure penalty, battered into the left of the net, 
two-thirds of the way up. Very well done, and can Villa now get a winner?

85 min Here comes Kodjia...
 
83 min Why didn’t Villa try this earlier? They’re putting balls into the box 
and causing panic in the Leeds defence. And from once such cross, Gestede goes 
up, Cooper knocks it away from him with his hands, and Roger East does nothing! 
But his lino corrects him, Cooper is booked, and can Villa level things?
 
83 min Final change for Leeds, Vieira replacing Bridcutt. 
 
80 min Adomah teases Berardi and whips a cross around him, looking for 
Gestede; Cooper does brilliantly to hurl himself at it and head behind. The 
corner is then punched clear by Green, but eventually the ball ends up with 
Adomah again, on the left this time, and he cross to the far post, forcing 
another desperate defensive header. This time, the corner is properly cleared.
 
78 min Double change for Villa: Gestede and Adomah replace Jedinak and Ayew. 
Poor Gaby Agbonlahor.
 
77 min Hernandez has made such a difference since he came on, and he pokes out 
a leg to grab the ball at inside-right, sliding a pass between Amavi and Baker 
for Sacko. But Bunn is out sharply to block.

76 min “If you had the chance to show off your sleeve tattoos (should you have 
them),” emails Graeme Thorn, “in front of hundreds, nay, tens of thousands of 
supporters and viewers, would you cover them up with a long sleeve?”

I am, of course, double hard and impervious to cold, but were that not so, on 
a night like tonight I’d keep it to myself.
 
75 min McCormack nashes down the right and with very few options, clips a 
cross to Ayew, on the edge of the box, left-hand side. He takes a touch to 
control and mishit a shot that’s not too far wide.
 
74 min Hernandez takes a square pass from Berardi and makes to inside Hutton 
before disappearing outside and outswinging an early shot that passes just past 
the post.
 
73 min Ayling races in and ducks towards a header as Ayew pulls out to avoid 
hurting him. There’s a short pause for recovery.
 
70 min Do sleeve tattoos make your arms warm? It seems that every footballer 
who has one also wears a short-sleeved top, though maybe it just looks that 
way. Or maybe thy’re just less bothered by cold, i.e. harder.
 
69 min Change for Leeds, Roofe replaced by Wood. 
 
67 min Lovely from Kodjia who fools Jansson, shaping to shoot then dashing 
away and skirting Cooper too, swivelling into a powerful cross-shot that Green 
dives to push away. Lovelily done.

66 min Leeds looks a much better side than Villa now; I wonder why they didn’t 
go for it in the first half on that basis.
 
65 min Kodjia appears at inside right and moves the ball into the middle 
without apparent plan, but it reaches Hutton nonetheless, only for Cooper to 
intervene with a well-timed tackle.
 
64 min “Watching this at 04:53 am in Western Australia is killing me,” brags 
Harry Hall. “Any chance of a Bacuna bullet header again?”


Every chance, I’d say. 
 
63 min Villa need to do something, because Leeds look far more likely to score 
again than they do to equalise.
 
61 min The very definition of sobriety.

60 min Lovely link-up between Sako and Hernandez, Hernandez then playing 
Doukara in. He’s offside, apparently - though it looked close.
 
60 min Well, this is a bit better at least. 
 
59 min Villa break, feeding Bacuna, who nips the ball around Bridcutt, who 
runs through him anyway and takes the inevitable yellow card.
 
58 min Leeds win another  corner, and in the absence of Dallas, they go short, 
Hernandez to Sako. Between them they make a mess of it, but winanother 
nonetheless, which is cleared.
 
57 min Change for Leeds, Hernandez replacing Dallas. 
 
56 min Again, Dallas’ delivery is good and Baker gets a slight touch, 
diverting the ball to Jansson who cushions it with a dextrous touch then slams 
a shot which clips the top of the bar!
 
55 min Suddenly Leeds look lively and Roofe runs at Baker, swivelling into a 
cross and winning another corner.
