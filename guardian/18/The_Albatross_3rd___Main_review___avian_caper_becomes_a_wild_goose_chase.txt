When Spider (Charlie Allen) turns up at the local dime store carrying a dead 
golden eagle, which he claims committed suicide on his windscreen, he thinks 
he’s hit the jackpot. With the sale ofthe protected birds highly regulated 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_feather_law>, he’s convinced that all he 
needs is a little help from Gene (Hamish Clark) to sell the eagle – which is of 
particular spiritual significance to Native Americans – on the black market.

 But Spider’s a fool. Lullaby (Andrew St Clair-James), the ex-boxer who works 
in the store, is prone to quoting fromThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/oct/26/rime-ancient-mariner> 
to remind him that he doesn’t have an eagle so much as an albatross.

 Actually, Simon David Eden’s comedy turns out to be a bit of a wild goose 
chase. It is heavy on plot and often floridly written but short on laughs 
(until the second, far perkier half). It comes across as a pastiche of aTracy 
Letts <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/18/superior-donuts-review> 
drama. There’s way too much cryptic banter and not enough character 
development; it’s hard to care about anybody, or believe that Gene and Lullaby 
would even give the obnoxious Spider the time of day.

 Eden designs and directs his own play with pleasing simplicity, and Clark is 
watchable as Gene, a man with his own problems. But despite all the similes and 
metaphors, it has nothing pressing to say about contemporary America, and isn’t 
so entertaining that you’d fail to notice.
