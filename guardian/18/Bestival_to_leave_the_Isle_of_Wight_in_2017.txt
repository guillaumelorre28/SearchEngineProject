Bestival, the fancy dress friendly event that wraps up the UK’s summer 
festival season, is to move sites. No more will revellers have to contend with 
queues for ferries to and from the Isle of Wight, because the event’s 
organisers plan to move it to the Lulworth Estate in Dorset, the home of its 
sister festival,Camp Bestival

“Hot off the press – yes Bestival is moving!” said Bestival curator Rob da Bank

. “We can confirm we have submitted a licence application for a new site at the 
Lulworth Estate in Dorset and we’re super excited about our shiny new Bestival 
adventure. We have an incredible lineup, headliners confirmed and ridiculous 
new stages and installations coming your way in 2017.”

This year’s event is due to take place from 7-10 September. 

That the Lulworth Estate already hosts Camp Bestival is likely to make the 
logistics of moving easier. The Scottish festival T in the Park was forced to 
change sites from Balado airfield to Strathallan Castle, and after just two 
years at the new siteits organisers have cancelled next year’s event

. “The constraints – logistically and financially – that the resulting planning 
conditions put upon us are simply not workable,” said DF Concerts.

Bestival has been held at the Robin Hill country park on the Isle of Wight 
since 2004, growing from an event in which 10,000 people saw the Bees, Basement 
Jaxx and Zero 7 headline to one with a 55,000 capacity, attracting some of 
music’s biggest names. Its headliners have included Outkast, Elton John, Stevie 
Wonder, Kraftwerk and the Cure. In 2015 and 2016 it also offered a spinoff 
festival in Canada,Bestival <https://www.theguardian.com/music/bestival>
