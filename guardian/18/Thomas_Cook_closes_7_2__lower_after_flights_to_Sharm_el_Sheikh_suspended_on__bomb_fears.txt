The move came amid fears that the crashed airliner Flight 9268 may have been 
brought down by a bomb planted by militant group Islamic State. Prime minister 
David Cameron called President Sisi on Wednesday to discuss what Egyptians are 
doing about security arrangements at Sharm el-Sheikh airport. A team of UK 
experts will asses what further measures may need to be taken.

Thomas Cook closed down 7.27% or 5.5p at 112.2p while Tui lost 1.9% to £11.37. 
The ABTA travel association estimated there were around 9,000 customers 
currently on holiday at the popular Egyptian destination. Both companies said 
they had cancelled all flights and holidays to Sharm up until 12 November. They 
said customers who had booked during that time would be refunded. Analyst Wyn 
Ellis at Numis told Reuters:

Sharm el Sheikh being closed is undoubtedly going to cost them some money.

Meanwhile easyjet, up 1.3% to £17.56, said it had cancelled five flights to 
Sharm from Britain on Thursday.
