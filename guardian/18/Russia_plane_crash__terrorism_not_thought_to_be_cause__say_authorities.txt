Russian authorities say they do not believe a terrorist attack was responsible 
for the crash of a Syria-bound military plane with 92 people on board. However, 
the cause of the crash is still unclear: the main possibilities under 
consideration are pilot error, technical malfunction, poor quality fuel or an 
unidentified object lodging in the engines.

Early on Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry confirmed it had found a flight 
recorder from the Tu-154 jet.

The aircraft, which was carrying more than 60 members of the internationally 
renowned Red Army choir to entertain Russian troops inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> for the new year, went down off the 
resort city of Sochi shortly after takeoff early on Sunday morning. From the 
start, there was little hope that any passengers had survived the crash.

More than 3,000 rescue workers laboured through the night, racing to find the 
remaining bodies and debris before the currents carry them further away from 
shore.

The first 10 bodies have been flown to Moscow amid a national outpouring of 
grief.

Vladimir Putin orders investigation into plane crash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/dec/26/vladimir-putin-orders-investigation-into-plane-crash-video>
The FSB security services said on Monday that terrorism was not deemed a 
likely cause, as did the transport minister, Maksim Sokolov, in a televised 
briefing.


“Currently, the main versions do not include an act of terror,” he said. 
“There could be various causes – they are being analysed by specialists, 
experts, the investigative committee.”

The search operation included 39 vessels covering more than 100 sq km (38 sq 
miles), with planes, helicopters and drones searching from above and deep-water 
equipment and divers hunting below the surface.


“I think we will be able to find the location of the plane on the bottom of 
the Black Sea today,” Viktor Bondarev, the commander of the Russian air force, 
told Russian agencies.

“When we find the plane, we will raise the flight recorders to the surface. We 
know they are located in the tail and I am sure that the tail was damaged the 
least,” he said.

On Monday, evening, agencies reported that parts of the fuselage had been 
found and lifted from the seabed, but the black boxes had not yet been found.

Sokolov said some of the bodies could have already been carried off by the 
current to Abkhazia, the separatist region of Georgia. Search operations were 
under way there too.

By Monday evening, 13 bodies had been found, as well as more than 150 body 
fragments.

“The search is complicated by the large depth range and the sea bottom relief 
characteristics in the presumed crash area,” Igor Konashenkov, a defence 
ministry spokesman, said in a briefing.

Along with the first 10 bodies, 86 body parts were flown to the capital for 
DNA analysis, he added.

The passenger jet went down at 5:25am local time (0225 GMT) on Sunday, minutes 
after taking off from Sochi’s airport where it had stopped to refuel after 
flying out from the Chkalovsky military aerodrome in the Moscow region.


On board were 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble – the army’s official 
musical group, also known as the Red Army Choir – and their conductor, Valery 
Khalilov.

“The ensemble has been orphaned by a third,” said the state channel Rossiya.

The choir was due to perform for Russian troops deployed in Syria during new 
year’s celebrations at the Hmeimim airbase, which has been used to launch 
airstrikes in support of Moscow’s ally, President Bashar al-Assad.

Other passengers included military officers, journalists and Yelizaveta 
Glinka, a popular charity worker also known as Doctor Liza who had been flying 
with medical supplies for a hospital in the coastal city of Latakia.

The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered a day of national mourning on 
Monday, with state television flashing black and white pictures of the victims 
across the screen while entertainment programmes were cancelled.

There has been little public discussion of Russia’s war in Syria, except for a 
simple narrative about fighting terrorism. In a carefully phrased editorial on 
Monday, the daily newspaper Vedomosti said the plane crash was a tragedy, but 
the dead were “victims of a war which we are taking part in, whether freely or 
not”.

“We understand the depth of this tragedy, but we do not think it should limit 
public discussion of whetherRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> 
should be taking part in this war,” it said.

People brought flowers to improvised memorials at the port in central Sochi 
and the city’s airport, as well as to the Moscow headquarters of the Red Army 
Choir and the office of Fair Aid, the non-governmental organisation that Glinka 
headed, which primarily worked with the homeless.


Tu-154 aircraft have been involved in a number of accidents and are no longer 
used by commercial airlines in Russia.

But Sergei Bainetov, the air force head of flight safety, said on Sunday that 
the plane involved in the crash was “in good condition technically”.

In April 2010 many high-ranking Polish officials, including the then president 
Lech Kaczynski, werekilled when a Tu-154 airliner went down

 in thick fog while approaching Smolensk airport in western Russia.
