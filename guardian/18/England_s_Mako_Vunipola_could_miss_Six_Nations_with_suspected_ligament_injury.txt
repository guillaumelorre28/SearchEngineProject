The England prop Mako Vunipola’s participation in the Six Nations Championship 
is in doubt. Vunipola suffered suspected ligament damage in his left knee after 
being forced off inSaracens’ European Champions Cup win at Sale

The 25-year-old is expected to see a consultant in a month’s time when the 
swelling on the knee subsides, and could be out for up to 12 weeks.

It seems unlikely Vunipola will be fit for England’s Six Nations opener 
against France at Twickenham on 4 February. A serious injury could rule 
Vunipola out of the entire tournament and prevent him from being part of 
England’s title defence.

“It’s not looking good to be honest,” said the Saracens director of rugby, 
Mark McCall, afterSaturday’s win over Newcastle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/24/saracens-newcastle-falcons-premiership-rugby-match-report>
. “He’s got to go and see his consultant in four weeks’ time and then we will 
determine how long he will actually be out. We have to let the injury settle 
down as much as possible to have any idea because otherwise you are just 
guessing.”

Vunipola’s brother and Saracens team-mate Billy is in danger of missing the 
Six Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/27/england-billy-vuniploa-six-nations-knee-ligament-operation>
 after an operation to repair a torn knee cartilage suffered during England’s 
27-14 win against Argentina last month.

“It’s a big blow to lose Billy and then Mako,” McCall said. “Both are such 
important players for us. We were going to lose them for the Six Nations but to 
lose them in the run-up to that is so disappointing.”

Mako Vunipola’s absence would be a huge blow for the England coach, Eddie 
Jones, as the 39-times capped prop has played a major part in the team’s 
success during 2016.

The New Zealand-born player featured in every game of England’s grand 
slam-winning campaign, as well as the3-0 summer series win in Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/03/england-australia-autumn-internationals-match-report>
 and the four autumn Test victories.

Vunipola has certainly been ruled out of Saracens’ festive programme, which 
features a home match against Newcastle on Christmas Eve and a trip to 
Leicester on New Year’s Day.

Saracens <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens> then host Exeter in the 
Premiership on 7 January before concluding their Champions Cup group fixtures 
against Scarlets and Toulon.
