On a cold day, bare earth crunches underfoot. This is because ice needles have 
formed, pushing the soil upwards, and the pressure of a footstep crushes them 
down again. In frozen regions, a similar effect on a grand scale produces
unusual hillocks known as pingos 
<https://www.fws.gov/refuge/arctic/permcycle.html>.

Pingos can be as much as 50 metres high. They typically start in old lake 
beds. Freezing water forms into a lens shape and expands as it becomes ice. As 
more water is added and the ice mass becomes larger, the ground above is 
gradually forced upwards into a mound. This can grow at the rate of a few 
centimetres a year.

The outlook: perpetual freezing darkness

Pingos are conspicuous landmarks in otherwise flat landscapes, and useful 
vantage points for spotting caribou herds or whale offshore; the name comes 
from an Inuit language. A quarter of the world’s pingos are in Canada’s 
Northwest Territories, where there is aNational Landmark 
<http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/v-g/pingo/index.aspx> dedicated to preserving 
them.

Pingos meet their end when they expand so much that the crust above them 
breaks open. Sunlight melts the ice, water flows out, and the pingo collapses. 
This leaves what looks like a miniature volcanic crater known as a pingo scar.

A rash of craters appearing in Siberia in 2014

 were initially thought to be the result of meteorite strikes or underground 
gas explosions. Pingo collapse turned out to be a more likely explanation.

Geologists have identified ancient pingo scars in Ireland and in Norfolk

glacial adolescent pimples.
