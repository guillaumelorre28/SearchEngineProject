Three Femen activists have been acquitted of exhibitionism for a topless 
protest staged as former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique 
Strauss-Kahn arrived

 at his trial for “aggravated pimping” in February 2015.

“It’s the first acquittal in a trial against Femen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/femen> on the charge of sexual exhibition,” 
their lawyer Valentine Reberioux told AFP.

“A political demonstration should not be confused with sexual aggression,” she 
said. “These are political acts using the nude torso as a mode of expression 
and it ends there.”

With slogans such as “pimps, clients, guilty” scrawled on their chests and 
hurling insults at the car, the three protesters were quickly rounded up by 
police as Strauss-Kahn’s car entered an underground parking area near the court 
in Lille, northernFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>.

Strauss-Kahn, a former head of the IMF, was accused of being at the centre of 
a large prostitution ring but was acquitted in June.

Prosecutors, who have 10 days to appeal Wednesday’s verdict acquitting the 
Femen activists, had demanded a three-month suspended prison sentence and a 
€1,000 (£792) fine.

The acquittal was the first for Femen in France after two convictions, which 
are under appeal.

One Femen activist was convicted and fined €1,500 for a topless protest 
against the visiting Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in June 2014 at Paris’s 
Grevin wax museum.

Another was given a one-month suspended prison sentence for a December 2013 
topless protest outside the Madeleine church in Paris against harsh new 
restrictions on abortion in Spain.
