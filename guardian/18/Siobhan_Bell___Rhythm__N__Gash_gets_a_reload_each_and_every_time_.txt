I always like to open with an unexpected classic that will make you go: “Wow I 
remember this”. I go for this purely for the intro.

The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor

This will never fail. A feel-good classic that people know all the lyrics to.

The track that currently gets the most rewinds 
Rebound X: Rhythm ‘N’ Gash (Instrumental)

This instantly gets a reload each and every time.

The track I wish I’d signed to my label

A real fave with a UK vibe. Mumblez and Charmer are the perfect duo that, for 
me, represent alternative hip-hop in the UK.

The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding 
Cheryl Lynn: Got To Be Real

I definitely am an old soul musically thanks to my family and this track would 
go down well at my aunt’s wedding along with loud singalongs and groovy dance 
moves.

The track that got me out of bed this morning 
Lil Uzi Vert: You Was Right

Any time I hear this record I can’t help but dance.

The best track by my favourite new artist

Atlanta artist 2Fourhrs – formerly known as Royce Rizzy and brother of 
MadeinTYO – has really rebranded himself into greatness.

The ideal festival track 
Yeah Yeah Yeahs: Heads Will Roll (A-Trak remix)

This track will forever be my hyped festival track. When the vocals drop, you 
instantly get a bumped-up vibe, especially with this remix by a favourite DJ 
and producer of mine.

The track that should have been a crossover hit 
Giggs: Whippin Excursion

This should have been supported by the mainstream. He’s a legend and no matter 
what time or what city I play that song in, everyone goes crazy for it.
