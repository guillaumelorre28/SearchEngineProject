The former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt has been appointed lead 
Brexit negotiator for the European parliament, as the other 27 EU member states 
gear up for the complex negotiations ahead.

Any deal on Britain’s new relationship with the rest of the EU after Brexit 
will have to be ratified by the European parliament, and Verhofstadt, regarded 
as a diehard European, will represent the views of MEPs from across the EU. He 
said he was “honoured” to take on the role.

The politician insisted that after the EU referendum result in July Britain 
should not be allowed to restrict immigration – a central demand, according to
Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> – yet retain 
access to the other aspects of the single market.

“The European parliament will never agree to a deal that de facto ends the 
free movement of people for a decade, while giving away an extra rebate in 
exchange for all the advantages of the internal market. What would stop other 
countries from asking the same exceptional status?” he said.

Instead, Verhofstadt said, some form of associate status for Britain would be 
a better approach “with less obligations but equally less rights”.

Vincenzo Scarpetta, of the thinktank Open Europe, in a blogpost about the 
appointment 
<http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/guy-verhofstadt-european-parliaments-top-brexit-negotiator-mean/>
, suggested that Verhofstadt’s role would be less critical than that ofMichel 
Barnier, the French former EU commissioner who will negotiate on behalf of the 
more powerful commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/jean-claude-juncker-puts-michel-barnier-in-charge-brexit-talks>
.

Scarpetta added: “On a personal level Verhofstadt could be a pretty tough nut 
to crack. A diehard European federalist, he generally comes across as less 
pragmatic than Barnier. I would expect Verhofstadt to be particularly 
intransigent when it comes to splitting the EU’s so-called four freedoms – that 
is the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.”

Verhofstadt’s appointment was applauded by the Scottish National party. He has 
backed the SNP’s case for an independent Scotland to be quickly admitted to the 
EU. In a tweet after it became clear on 24 June that Scotland had voted 
strongly to remain in the EU, he said: “It’s wrong that Scotland might be taken 
out of EU, when it voted to stay. Happy to discuss with Nicola Sturgeon.”

Before meeting Scotland’s first minister, late June, he added: “If Scotland 
decides to leave the UK, to be an independent state, and they decide to be part 
of the European union I think there is no big obstacle to do that.”


It is unclear if a Scottish claim for entry as an independent state will 
affect the UK’s Brexit negotiations, or the European parliament’s response, but 
Alyn Smith, the SNP MEP, said he was delighted with the former Belgium 
premier’s appointment. “Guy’s appointment is good news – we can do business. He 
is a long-standing respected MEP. [He] has also proven he is alive to the 
Scottish question and I have every confidence all the doors we need are open.”

Verhofstadt’s appointment was announced after the president of the European 
council, Donald Tusk, used a breakfast meeting in Downing Street to urge the 
prime minister topress ahead with formal negotiations as soon as possible 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/donald-tusk-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-negotiations-eu>
.

Speaking before the pair shared what a spokeswoman said was a friendly 
breakfast of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, Tusk said: “The ball is now in 
your court.”

The spokeswoman said the pair had discussed working together to create a 
“smooth process for Britain’s exit from the EU but reiterated that May would 
not invoke article 50, which begins the formal negotiations, before the end of 
the year.

May also discussed with Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, the recent 
attacks on Polish people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/five-teenage-boys-arrested-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-essex>
 in the UK, the spokeswoman said. She sought to reassure him that Britain was a 
“tolerant country” and would remain so outside the EU. She detailed the action 
the government was taking to crack down onhate crime 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/hate-crime>.

With uncertainty over the EU’s future likely to dampen economic confidence, 
the government could face increasing pressure from the other member states. 
Other EU leaders will meet in Bratislava next week – without Britain – to 
consider the way forward.

But Tusk made clear there could be little progress until article 50 was 
triggered. “It doesn’t mean that we are going to discuss our future relations 
with the UK in Bratislava, because for this, and especially for the start of 
the negotiations, we need the formal notification, I mean triggering article 
50. This is the position shared by all 27 member states. To put it simply, the 
ball is now in your court. I’m aware that it is not easy but I still hope you 
will be ready to start the process as soon as possible. I have no doubt that at 
the end of the day our common strategic goal is to establish the closest 
possible relations.”

With Westminster’s summer recess now over, the government is gearing up for 
the challenge of Britain’s EU exit. However, May gave little away about her 
intentions, insisting in the Commons on Wednesday that her government would not 
give a“running commentary” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-not-provide-running-commentary-on-brexit-negotiations-video>
 on the issue.

May has made clear that controls on immigration would have to be a key element 
of any deal, but she does not favour the points-based system that was advocated 
by many pro-Brexit campaigners in the run-up to the referendum.


It is also unclear whether May believes Britain can remain a member of the 
single market after leaving. The Brexit secretary,David Davis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit>
, who was asked if Britain could remain inside the single market, said this 
week: “The simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up 
control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable.”

But the prime minister’s spokeswoman subsequently indicated that Davis was 
“setting out his opinion” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy>
 rather than making a statement of government policy – underlining the tensions 
that could emerge between the pro-remain prime minister and the pro-Brexit team 
she has put in charge of negotiating Britain’s departure.

May has also insisted that she does not see the need 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/27/theresa-may-acting-like-tudor-monarch-in-denying-mps-a-vote-over-brexit>
 for a parliamentary vote to ratify a decision to trigger article 50.
