David Davis has pledged to share the Westminster government’s “latest 
thinking” on Brexit with the leaderships of Scotland,Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> and Wales, before the first 
meeting of a forum intended to allow the devolved administrations to help shape 
Britain’s strategy.

At the end of October, Theresa May promised Scotland’s first minister, Nicola 
Sturgeon, the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, and Northern Ireland’s first 
minister, Arlene Foster, and her deputy, Martin McGuinness, a “direct line” to 
Davis, her Brexit secretary, saying it was “imperative that the devolved 
administrations play their part in making [negotiations] work”.

At the forum meeting on Wednesday, Davis will commit to sharing analysis 
undertaken by his department for exiting theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and to hosting further monthly meetings 
of the forum, formally named the EU negotiation joint ministerial committee.

Davis said” [The government is] determined to get a deal that works for all 
the parts of the United Kingdom. I want to ensure the free and trusted flow of 
important information between all parties involved. So we are asking the 
devolved administrations to bring us their analysis that will help shape our 
priorities for the negotiation with the EU, and we will share our latest 
thinking.

“The UK has chosen to leave the EU and we are determined to work closely with 
the governments ofScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>, Northern 
Ireland and Wales in making a success of it.”

On Tuesday, Sturgeon announced that the Scottish government would seek to join 
the next legal battle over MPs’ right to vote onarticle 50 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50>, after the UK government’s 
defeat in the high court 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules>
 last week.

She said Scotland’s lord advocate would lodge a formal application to 
intervene in the Westminster government’s supreme court appeal against last 
Thursday’s ruling, which stated that MPs needed to vote on triggeringarticle 50 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu>
 to begin the process of leaving the EU.

Sturgeon, who has previously endorsed a proposal from Jones, the Welsh leader, 
that any planned negotiating package should be subject to a vote in all four UK 
parliaments and assemblies, said Holyrood should also be formally consulted on 
the decision.

This would mean the Scottish parliament voting on a legislative consent 
motion, under the parliamentary convention which requires that Holyrood agree 
to any changes in its powers and responsibilities. This does not amount to 
Holyrood having a veto on triggering article 50.

Sturgeon said that regardless of the legal outcome, politically she believed 
there should be a legislative consent motion before Holyrood. “It would be 
disrespecting the whole devolution settlement and the place that that 
convention has always had in the devolution settlement for a decision of this 
magnitude and with this degree of impact on our devolved responsibilities to be 
taken without the Scottish parliament being consulted,” she said.

The first minister said she believed members of the Welsh and Northern Irish 
governments would take similar views of their own parliaments.

The Brexit case will be heard at the supreme court over the course of four 
days between 5 and 8 December. The Welsh government has already declared its 
intention to intervene in the case. Appeals by Northern Ireland groups arguing 
that parliament and the assembly in Stormont should ratify the triggering of 
Brexit may also be joined to the supreme court case.
