1. Mythologies <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/mythologies-286747.html> by 
Roland Barthes (1957)
I wouldn’t have become the writer I am if I hadn’t discovered Barthes. At 
university I felt a confused longing to write, but couldn’t imagine what sort 
of writer to be – then I discovered a Frenchman who showed me a new way of 
writing nonfiction.Mythologies is about the most ordinary things: washing 
powder, the Eiffel Tower, falling in love, short and long-hemmed skirts, 
photographs of his mother. And yet he brought a classical education and a 
philosophical mind to bear on these subjects. He knew how to connect Racine and 
beach holidays, Freud and the anticipation of a lover’s phone call. His work 
rejected the division between the high and the low; he could see the deeper 
themes running through supposedly banal things.

For Proust the meaning of life turns out to be located not so much in love or 
worldly success as in aesthetic experience

2. The Unquiet Grave 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/unquiet-grave-403578.html> by Cyril Connolly 
(1951)
This is usually out of print and is often compared unfavourably with 
Connolly’s far-better-knownEnemies of Promise (1938). The accusation most often 
levelled at it is that it’s a work of self-indulgence, which fails to 
distinguish between talking a lot about yourself and being self-centred; 
Connolly did a lot of the former, but was not the latter. It’s a seductive 
mixture of diary, commonplace book, essay, travelogue and memoir, arranged in 
loose paragraphs in which Connolly gives us his views on women, religion, 
death, seduction, infatuation and literature. The thoughts are wise and 
beautifully modelled, with the balance of the best French aphorisms: for 
example: “There is no fury like an ex-wife searching for a new lover.”

3. Letters from a Stoic 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/letters-from-a-stoic-2.html> by Seneca (AD65)
Given the times we live in, Seneca should be the author of the hour. In a time 
of continuous political upheaval (Nero was on the imperial throne), Seneca 
interpreted philosophy as a discipline to keep us calm against a backdrop of 
perpetual danger. He tried to calm the sense of injustice in his readers by 
reminding them – in AD62 – that natural and manmade disasters will always be a 
feature of our lives, however sophisticated and safe we think we have become. 
We must, argued Seneca, hold the possibility of the most obscene events in mind 
at all times. No one should undertake a journey by car, or walk down the stairs 
or say goodbye to a friend without an awareness – neither gruesome nor 
unnecessarily dramatic – of fatal possibilities.

4. Essays and Aphorisms 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/essays-and-aphorisms-2.html> by Arthur 
Schopenhauer (1851)
Schopenhauer is another great pessimist who makes you feel happier: he pointed 
out that all humans find it easy to imagine perfection, but that it’s a problem 
to suppose such perfection can ever occur. The modern bourgeois philosophy pins 
its hopes firmly on those two great presumed ingredients of happiness – love 
and work. But there is vast unthinking cruelty discreetly coiled within this 
magnanimous assurance that everyone will discover satisfaction here, which 
almost never happens. So our individual misfortunes – our fractious marriages, 
our unexploited ambitions – instead of seeming to us quasi-inevitable aspects 
of life, will weigh down on us like particular curses.

5. In Search of Lost Time 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/in-search-of-lost-time.html> by Marcel Proust 
(1913-1927)
What I appreciate here is that this isn’t a novel so much as a philosophy book 
with novelistic details. It’s one person’s search for how to stop wasting, and 
start appreciating, that most precious commodity: time. The meaning of life 
turns out to be located not so much in love or worldly success (two 
alternatives amply explored by Proust) as in aesthetic experience: the 
heightened, clarified, sympathetic version of reality we find in the best art.

1. Men, Women, and Chainsaws 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/men-women-and-chain-saws.html> by Carol J 
Clover (1992)
Clover was a specialist in old Norse-Icelandic literature who began to notice 
feminist undercurrents in the disreputable slasher movies that had 
traditionally been dismissed as sadistic trash. Exploring the complex ways in 
which horror audiences identify not with the tormentors but with the tormented, 
Clover identified the “final girl” as the touchstone character of these 
narratives, brilliantly refiguring theories of gender identity in exploitation 
cinema. Astute, insightful, and terrifically entertaining,Men, Women, and 
Chainsawscrystallised ideas many horror fans had previously struggled to 
express, and did so with an irresistible enthusiasm.

With eye-opening candour, Roenblum explains how films can be lost, found and 
reshaped in post-production

2. The Dilys Powell Film Reader 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dilys-Powell-Film-Reader/dp/0856359122/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483551815&sr=8-1&keywords=dilys+powell+film+reader>
 by Edited by Christopher Cook (1991)
Over the years several friends and relatives have bought me film readers from 
the publisher Carcanet, including works byCA Lejeune 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/mar/02/ca-lajeune-changed-view-cinema-pioneering-film-critic>
, Graham Greene and (of course)Philip French 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/27/philip-french-much-loved-observer-film-critic-dies-at-the-age-of-82>
, all of which now occupy a special section of my bookshelf. The first, 
however, was this collection by “the doyenne of British film critics”, Dilys 
Powell, which my mentor, Arnold Hinchliffe, bought me as a reminder of what 
“proper” film criticism should look like. Reading the work of critics like 
these has always been important to me, not least because it serves to remind me 
how elegant the medium can be.

3. When the Shooting Stops… the Cutting Begins 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/When-Shooting-Stops-Cutting-Begins-x/dp/0306802724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483552041&sr=8-1&keywords=When+the+Shooting+Stops+%E2%80%A6+the+Cutting+Begins>
 by Ralph Rosenblum & Robert Karen (1979)
It’s often claimed (with some justification) that film critics don’t 
understand how movies are made, but when it comes to editing even those whomake 
films can be baffled by this most “invisible” process. Editor Ralph Rosenblum 
worked on movies as diverse asThe Night They Raided Minsky’s and Annie Hall, 
and his first-hand account of the practicalities and politics of the cutting 
room is as fascinating as it is accessible. With eye-opening candour, he 
explains how films can be lost, found and reshaped in post-production, blending 
technical knowledge with vast personal experience.

4. Black American Cinema 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Black-American-Cinema-Film-Readers-Manthia-Diawara/0415903971/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483552234&sr=8-1&keywords=Black+American+Cinema>
 by Edited by Manthia Diawara (1993)
Having studied English literature rather than film at Manchester University, I 
remain unqualified to talk about cinema other than as a lifelong enthusiast – 
something that only gets you so far. In attempting to plug the vast academic 
gaps in my knowledge, this seminal collection of essays from the AFI [American 
Film Institute] readers series proved invaluable. In the preface Diawara talks 
about addressing both “a black film aesthetic by focusing on the black artist” 
and “the thorny issue of film spectatorship”. This authoritative volume covers 
film-makers fromOscar Micheaux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/12/pioneers-african-american-cinema-oscar-micheaux>
 toSpike Lee <https://www.theguardian.com/film/spikelee>, and is as relevant 
now as it was when first published.

5. Nightmare Movies <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/nightmare-movies.html> 
by Kim Newman (1985)
Along with the horror/fantasy film critics Nigel Floyd and Alan Jones, Kim 
Newman was a guiding light when I started out in film journalism, and I remain 
in awe of his work. First published in the 1980s, since when it has been 
massively expanded and updated,Nightmare Movies is matchless stuff – a textbook 
which turns Newman’s encyclopaedic knowledge into a readable romp through the 
hidden byways of horror cinema. Like Mark Cousins’sThe Story of Film 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/story-of-film.html>, it’s as book that never 
ceases to amaze and delight me.

 Noreena Hertz: ‘Sometimes people think about economics as a much narrower, 
less rich subject than it really is.’ 
1. The Affluent Society 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/affluent-society.html> by John Kenneth 
Galbraith (1958)
I read this when I was studying economics for A-level aged 15 and it opened my 
eyes to the fact that it was a much richer discipline than the graphs and 
numbers in the dry textbooks I’d been exposed to. Here was a thinker who was 
making clear that economics was inextricably linked with politics and that 
economists not only could, but should, take views on big social and political 
issues, should challenge prevailing beliefs and norms. That was very 
influential reading at such an early age. It’s also beautifully written and 
showed me you could do yourself a real service as an economist if you could 
write well.

Amartya Sen’s work really resonated with the realities I experienced in Africa 
and the Middle East

2. Exit, Voice, and Loyalty 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/exit-voice-and-loyalty.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
 by Albert O Hirschman (1970)
This is a really slim book but with a good idea: essentially that our power 
doesn’t only lie in our ability to walk away but also in our ability to stay 
put and complain. The economic orthodoxy up until then was that the market was 
the regulating force, so what regulated company behaviours was that customers 
could walk away if they didn’t like their product and what regulated 
governments was that an election would come up. But what Hirschman said was 
that it can be even more powerful to stay and exercise your ability to 
complain. I found it a powerful idea when I read it at university and it was 
definitely influential in my thinking behindThe Silent Takeover.

3. Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/institutions-institutional-change-and-economic-performance.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
 by Douglass North (1990)
This is probably the hardest read from my list, but the ideas are some of the 
most influential I’ve come across – this was when I was studying for my PhD. 
His big idea was that when you’re trying to understand why some countries 
become rich while others remain poor, you have to look at the complex interplay 
of the country’s history, culture, societal norms, laws and belief systems, not 
just the markets. We ignore history and culture at our peril. I was looking at 
Russia in the early 90s and realised you couldn’t just impose a market economy 
on to it and expect something to emerge that looked like the US or the UK, but 
that a very particular Russian form of capitalism would emerge.

4. If Women Counted by Marilyn Waring (1988)
I read this at university and it was the first feminist economics book I read 
– I wasn’t even aware the branch existed. Waring talks about how much of 
women’s work at home isn’t included in GDP calculations, and how women are 
ignored in traditional economics. She argues that the production of 
well-cared-for children is just as important as that of cars or crops. It 
triggered my interest in where gender and economics intersect and I went on to 
do work around who we value in society. I think there has been progress, but 
the whole caring economy still remains significantly undervalued.

5. Development As Freedom 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/development-as-freedom.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
 by Amartya Sen (1999)
This essentially argues that economic development isn’t just about raising 
income, but also about political rights – health, opportunity, safety, security 
– ideas that were very influential in the creation of the UN’s human 
development goals. I spent a few years working in Africa and the Middle East 
and Sen’s work really resonated with the realities on the ground, how a 
person’s life was not necessarily enhanced in an uptick in that country’s GDP, 
how you had to look at how the money was being distributed and who got access 
to it. What all my authors have in common is that they straddle politics, 
ethics and history. Sometimes when people think about economics they’re 
thinking of it as a much narrower, less rich subject than it really is.

1. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/universal-declaration-of-human-rights.html> 
(1948)
This little booklet stays in my handbag and I constantly refer to it. My work 
is increasingly about human rights and this foundational document shows their 
development and reminds us why they matter. For example, it addresses the right 
to equal access to education. I’m the president of a bursary programme that 
helps the very disadvantaged begin education again: girls who get pregnant at 
school, young men in trouble. We’ve discovered that people fleeing persecution 
and given sanctuary are charged as if they were foreign students and article 26 
argues this is unfair. I believe human rights should be integrated into our 
daily lives by recognising that everyone has a right to life, liberty and 
security.

On every page beautiful black-and-white photographs display the inhumanity of 
war, lynching in America, Belsen, poverty…

2. Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Archbold-2016-Criminal-Pleading-Evidence/0414054318/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1483014411&sr=8-3&keywords=Archbold+Criminal+Pleading%2C+Evidence+and+Practice>
 (Published annually)
Archbold is the criminal lawyer’s bible: a great, fat legal tome, which I 
spend my life carting around. Now I have one shoulder that slopes down further 
than the other. The book sets out the law and is regularly brought up to date. 
It’s useful for addressing the law on homicide, for example, which has been 
modernised, and analysing issues such as diminished responsibility, which has 
evolved due to advances in psychiatry. It explains the changing position on the 
killing of newborn infants and the law on joint enterprise. The fine print is 
incredibly important to the way in which you make legal argument, a journey of 
research that culminates in the use of relevant cases in court.

3. The Rule of Law <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rule-of-law-2.html> by 
Tom Bingham (2010)
Bingham was the president of our supreme court, or the appellate division of 
the House of Lords, as it was then known. He was a wonderful judge and an 
inspirational man and he wrote this very small book in which he sets down the 
meaning of the rule of law. It emphasises the importance of knowing the rules 
of society and the social contract and encourages equality before and open 
access to the law, something I’m worried about now because of the legal aid 
cuts. He discusses the sovereignty of parliament and I’m sure the judges had it 
in their mind during the recent decision regarding parliament’s role in any 
major constitutional matter (triggering article 50).

 by Bruce Bernard and Terence McNamee (2002)
I have this fantastic book on a stand in my study. It’s an incredible 
commentary on the 20th century, in many ways a century of horror, but which 
gave us the reasons why human rights matter. On every page beautiful 
black-and-white photographs display the inhumanity of war, lynching in America, 
Belsen, poverty, events throughout the world. I learned human rights by sitting 
in cells, in immigrant detention centres, in refugee camps. But you also learn 
from understanding our history and there’s nothing more powerful than an image 
to remind us. In the field of law, we’ve got to keep remembering we’re capable 
of terrible things unless we speak to our better angels.

5. Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/staying-alive-5.html> Edited by Neil Astley 
(2002)
I often use poetry when speaking to the jury, and I share the same taste as 
Neil Astley, who edited this anthology. It’s wonderful to find words that speak 
about human experience. This includes many poets I love, such as Seamus Heaney, 
Ted Hughes and Mary Oliver. She wrote a poem called Wild Geese, which is about 
how we are all connected, and you want to remind jurors of that connection, 
particularly on difficult cases. Poetry reaches parts that you otherwise 
cannot. You can quote Martin Luther King on “the arc of history”, or use Seamus 
Heaney to describe a moment to be seized, and say that as human beings we must 
rise to the occasion.

wildness in all its forms.’ Photograph: Mike Sim 
1. The Diary of Virginia Woolf (Five volumes, 1915-1941) 
Everything starts for me with Woolf. I read Orlando 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/orlando-8.html> first, but my abiding love is 
for the five pastel-jacketed volumes of herdiaries 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/selected-diaries.html>. She began on 1 
January 1915, writing after tea and using the notebooks as a laboratory for 
ideas, a place to catch stray thoughts and observations: weather reports from 
the teeming days. It’s this rough quality that appeals to me, the sense of 
someone thinking at full pelt, worrying their way into new concepts, new forms 
of language. As for that last, steadfast entry: “L. is doing the rhododendrons…”

My aesthetics, my politics, my model of how to be an artist, even my style as 
a gardener, were founded in Modern Nature

2. Collected Poems by Frank O’Hara (1995)
My battered copy bristles with pink and yellow Post-its. A queer poet and 
curator who was killed by a dune buggy on Fire Island in 1966 at the age of 40, 
O’Hara is one of the most purely talented and nimble writers who ever lived. 
His poems are a scourge to pomposity: casual, intimate and expansive, spreeing 
between registers, cramming in high art and oranges, taxi cabs and exclamation 
marks. I keep trying to put him in a book, but he wriggles away. All the same, 
he has my heart.

3. The Andy Warhol Diaries 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/andy-warhol-diaries.html> (1989) 
I’m not sure I’ve ever written a piece without consulting the formidable index 
of Andy Warhol’s diaries. He knew everyone, went everywhere, possessed a gimlet 
eye for the absurd and was never shy about dishing the dirt on friends and 
enemies alike. Originally begun as a way of logging his expenditure for the 
IRS, Warhol dictated the diary down the phone each morning to his secretary, 
Pat Hackett, which accounts for the wickedly giggly tone. Forget 
self-reflection: Andy was the consummate mirror for his times, making this the 
best imaginable history of the glittering, vacuous 1980s.

4. Modern Nature <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/modern-nature.html> by 
Derek Jarman (1991)
It always strikes me as funny that the nature writing currently in vogue never 
involves any sex. I much prefer Derek Jarman’s sublime and criminally underrated
Modern Nature, a memoir-cum-plantsman’s diary, written as a kind of spell 
against the devastations of Aids. Jarman is a magically acute observer, 
celebrating wildness in all its forms, from the poppies and sea kale of 
Dungeness beach to the midnight boys out cruising on Hampstead Heath. Reading 
it now, I’m amazed to see how pervasively it shaped me. My aesthetics, my 
politics, my model of how to be an artist, even my style as a gardener, were 
founded here.

5. Close to the Knives 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/close-to-the-knives.html> by David 
Wojnarowicz (1991)
This, by the artist and activist David Wojnarowicz, is my book of a lifetime, 
my book for these dark times, an antidote to stupidity, cruelty and oppression 
of all kinds.Knives is about Wojnarowicz’s life – his boyhood as a homeless 
hustler in New York, his diagnosis with Aids, the death of his best friend – 
but it is also about art and power, sex, freedom and resistance. It’s long been 
out of print in the UK. Happily, next March it will be brought back into 
circulation by Canongate. Get those pre-orders in now.

 Richard Mabey: ‘To see how “nature” prose should be done I turn repeatedly to 
Kathleen Jamie’s essays.’ Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian 
1. The Lives of a Cell by Lewis Thomas (1974) 
I’m on my second copy of The Lives of a Cell and its wine stains and frayed 
pages give it the air of one of the ancient and sociable organisms that swarm 
in the text. I first read it in the 1970s after it had, uniquely, won two US 
National Book awards, in both science and arts categories, and it changed the 
way I thought, wrote and laughed. Thomas was a polymathic, witty, literate 
biologist and this collection of short essays covers subjects as seemingly 
disconnected as moth pheromones, language as an evolving ecosystem and the 
meaning of mythological animals. But his genius was to find and explore their 
connections, in a coherent story of reverberating wisdom and sublime prose.

Oliver Rackham almost singlehandedly turned historical ecology into a national 
enthusiasm… we are all in his debt

2. The Poet as Botanist by MM Mahood (2008) 
Professor Molly Mahood 
<https://www.kent.ac.uk/congregations/honorary-grads/archive/2010/mollymahood.html>
 is an eminent English literature scholar and her description of this book as 
exploring “the relationship between biological thought and the poetic process” 
does not do credit to its darting intelligence and mischievous humour. She 
trawls the works of writers such as Crabbe, Wordsworth, DH Lawrence, Ruskin and 
especially John Clare to examine how their botanical knowledge informs their 
poetry and vice versa. Poetry emerges as a kind of science, truth alloyed out 
of acute observation and imaginative insight.

3. Insectivorous Plants by Charles Darwin (1875)
When I was younger, I held a fashionably Romantic disdain for Darwin as a cold 
mechanist. Then I began to read him properly and found that he was passionate, 
uncertain, a magnificent writer and full of Keats’s “negative capability”. I 
once declaimed the final paragraph ofOn the Origin of Species, with its famous 
rhapsody to “endless forms most beautiful”, as a secular grace at a wedding 
breakfast and hankies appeared.Insectivorous Plants is a classic expression of 
both his scientific method and prose style and, as he experimentally feeds 
sundews with the contents of his larder, you feel you are in on a fizzing 
country house murder mystery.

4. Ancient Woodland by Oliver Rackham (1980) 
Oliver Rackham, who died in 2015, almost singlehandedly turned historical 
ecology into a national enthusiasm.Ancient Woodland is his masterpiece, an 
overarching survey of East Anglia’s woodland heritage that embraces as evidence 
Anglo-Saxon charters, carpenters’ receipts and the habits of mildews. He 
excoriated generalisations and what he called “factoids” in elegant English 
that had its roots in the precision of Gilbert White and the robustness of 
William Cobbett. He had little truck with the self-centredness of modern nature 
writing but we are all in his debt.

5. Findings <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/findings.html>, Sightlines 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sightlines.html> by Kathleen Jamie (2005, 
2012)
Alan Bennett’s journals are my regular secular collects, but to see how 
“nature” prose should be done I turn repeatedly toKathleen Jamie 
<http://www.kathleenjamie.com/>’s essays. Writing of the moon and the night 
sky, or the skeletons of embryos in a medical museum, she has a clarity, an 
attentiveness that rinses your mind. She is quite without ego and has no need 
of extravagant metaphorical frameworks. “The outer world flew open like a 
door,” she writes, “and I wondered, what is it that we’re just not seeing?”

 Steven Pinker: ‘So many profound ideas were first explained in Thomas 
Schelling’s witty masterpiece.’ Photograph: Rex Features 
1. The Blind Watchmaker 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/blind-watchmaker.html> by Richard Dawkins 
(1986)
This was one of the books that inspired me to try my hand at scientific 
writing for a broad audience. It’s a model of how to explain complicated ideas 
without dumbing them down or boring one’s readers and Dawkins’s description of 
how he refuted a creationist’s claim that bombardier beetles could not have 
evolved sent me into a fit of giggles. I’ve gone to it both for explanations of 
evolutionary phenomena and for examples of lucid prose, including the masterful 
use of analogy, which I reproduced in my bookThe Stuff of Thought 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/stuff-of-thought.html>.

David Deutsch never passes along the conventional wisdom: everything is 
thought through and patiently explained

2. The Strategy of Conflict 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/strategy-of-conflict.html> by Thomas 
Schelling (1960)
So many profound ideas were first explained in this witty masterpiece: the 
bizarre logic of nuclear deterrence; the paradoxical value of being helplessly 
incommunicado or irrationally hotheaded; why negotiators split the difference 
or settle on a round number; why bribes and threats are so often veiled; the 
best way to rendezvous with someone if you made no plans and your mobile phones 
go dead.

3. The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/cambridge-grammar-of-the-english-language.html>
 by Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey Pullum (2002)
I go to this massive reference work to understand the logic of English. Unlike 
the primary linguistics literature, where you’ll find a mess of contradictory 
theories and a blizzard of jargon, this book analyses every grammatical 
construction in English in a consistent framework, with depth and insight that 
are nothing short of astonishing. I go to it for my research on language, my 
tinkering with definitions and usage notes forThe American Heritage Dictionary 
(for which I’m chair of the usage panel) and for guidance in my own writing. 
Most of all, when I had to commit to a set of analyses and technical terms in 
my writing guideThe Sense of Style 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sense-of-style.html>, I adapted them from the 
Cambridge Grammar.

4. Retreat from Doomsday 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Retreat-Doomsday-Obsolescence-Major-War/dp/0465069398/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483012955&sr=8-1&keywords=retreat+from+doomsday>
 by John Mueller (1989)
It seemed foolhardy in 1989 to publish a book with the subtitle “The 
obsolescence of major war”, but in this punchy and wit-filled book Mueller 
correctly predicted the end of the cold war and the decline of interstate 
conflict. He also gave superb analyses of the periods of war and peace over the 
past two centuries and fascinating reflections on the nature of moral progress, 
such as the abolition of slavery. This book was a major inspiration for my own
The Better Angels of Our Nature 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/better-angels-of-our-nature.html>.

5. The Beginning of Infinity 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/beginning-of-infinity.html> by David Deutsch 
(2011)
This 21st-century statement of the ideals of the Enlightenment offers fresh 
insight on a vast number of topics, including the workings of human cognition, 
the ways of science and the drivers of progress. Deutsch doesn’t labour to be 
provocative for its own sake and he never passes along the conventional wisdom: 
everything is thought through and patiently explained.

 Paul Morley: ‘Richard Meltzer made rock criticism an obsessive, dramatic and 
ultimately futile search for meaning.’ Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian 
1. Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/awopbopaloobop-alopbamboom.html> by Nik Cohn 
(1970)
Cohn wrote this book aged 22 in seven committed weeks to the loud sound of 
Beethoven’s string quartet No 15 in A Minor, rather than the Little Richard, 
Dylan, James Brown, Beatles, Who and Stones he was vividly mythologising. Cohn 
helped me understand how exciting writing about pop could be. The old saying 
that writing about music is like dancing about architecture is wrong because, 
as Cohn made brilliantly clear, as a rock critic you are writing about much 
more than music – personality, appearance, illusion, myth, emotion, desire – 
and ultimately about yourself. Your response should be illuminating, 
exaggerated, inspired, serious, mischievous and put the reader somewhere new 
and special, like the music.

2. The Aesthetics of Rock by Richard Meltzer (1970)
This was another book ambitiously inventing a new form of writing, a new way 
of talking about art that fixed a fan’s intensity to a self-styled specialist 
knowledge. Briefly a philosophy student at Yale, Meltzer wasn’t afraid to 
consider that rock music was the world itself, a battle between purpose and 
purposelessness, and take it from there. It made rock criticism an obsessive, 
dramatic and ultimately futile search for meaning, an epic contemplation of 
possibilities. Meltzer advocated writing as a performance that mixed 
enthusiasm, insight, mystery and a weirdly focused sense of absurdity. The idea 
of writing as a projection of your own personality, became, for better or 
worse, a major factor in my own writing.

Arts in Society's pioneering essays on style, pop and art were a big influence 
on me as a 20-year-old writer at the NME

3. Silence: Lectures and Writings 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/silence-9.html> by John Cage (1961)
A timeless book about ideas that is itself full of ideas, a series of 
conceptual invitations. In the early 70s, when it was hard to actually hear any 
Cage music, I thought of him as being as much a writer as a musician, and not 
just about music, but about the mind, performance, pleasure, the future. After 
the influence of Meltzer and Cohn, and their indirect connection with the new 
journalism of Wolfe, Mailer, Didion and Sontag, my search for an innovative 
form of nonfiction writing led to the poetic, provocative Cage. It was never 
just about what he said but how he said it, his experiments with form as well 
as content.

4. Stockhausen: Conversations With the Composer 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stockhausen-Conversations-composer-Jonathan-Cott/dp/0330241656/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1483017549&sr=8-9&keywords=jonathan+cott>
by Jonathan Cott (1973)
I choose this as much for its influence as a book about the nature of the 
interview as for the ego, spirit and cosmic timing of musical illusionist
Karlheinz Stockhausen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/08/guardianobituaries.obituaries>, 
and for its enigmatic blue cover and minimal Picador elegance, which as a 
16-year-old were irresistible. The way Cott, a writer forRolling Stone, slipped 
through the looking glass into star man Stockhausen’s slightly menacing other 
world, burned the idea of the interview into my mind and it became something I 
wanted to do as much as being the personality rock critic – spend time with 
favourite musicians, having their glamour rub off on me, but also get some 
clues about life, living and other mysteries.

5. Arts in Society  
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arts-Society-Paul-Barker/dp/1905512074/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483017926&sr=8-1&keywords=arts+in+society+paul+barker>
Edited by Paul Barker (1977)
This wonderful book compiles the stimulating, idealistic writings of weekly 
magazineNew Society, first published in 1962, which expanded the radical 
approaches to popular culture and mass media initiated by Walter Benjamin, 
Roland Barthes and Richard Hoggart. It included pioneering essays on style, 
pop, art, TV and architecture by Angela Carter, George Melly and John Berger, 
all of them performers and entertainers in their own way. These were a strong 
influence on me as a new 20-year-old writer at theNME, serious about the role 
of critic and trying to bring speculative urgency into writing about rock. It’s 
original thinking and writing about art that was often itself art and remains 
invigorating today.

1. The Autobiography of Malcolm X 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/autobiography-of-malcolm-x-2.html> (1965) 
As for many people who write about race, this book was life-changing for me. 
It’s really two books in one, and strictly speaking neither of them is an 
autobiography. The introduction and epilogue, by Alex Haley (ofRoots fame), 
could easily stand alone as a poignant snapshot of Malcolm X in his final 
years. The main body of the book is the fruit of more than 50 face-to-face 
interviews and plots how the young Malcolm Little is transformed, first into 
the Harlem criminal Detroit Red and then, via the US prison system, into the 
black Muslim Malcolm X. Over the months of interviews Malcolm bared his soul to 
Haley but often his accounts of others are the most telling: he describes the 
heyday and decline of his gangland boss “West Indian Archie”, the character of 
his closest friend, “Shorty”, and the suffering of his own parents; his father 
was murdered by the KKK. Alongside Ralph Ellison’sInvisible Man 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invisible-man.html>, this is one of the great 
literary indictments of American racism.

You can't get a rounded sense of the age of empire – the audacity and the 
horror – without reading Conrad

2. The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt (1951) 
Arendt is better known today for her 1963 book Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report 
on the Banality of Evil <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invisible-man.html>. 
But, to me, her greatest work is this 1951 classic. Much of my historical work 
focuses on the idea of linkage; that what happens in colonies and on distant 
battlefields seeps back into Europe. More than any thinker it was Hannah Arendt 
who identified how those movements of ideas, racial theories, people and 
methods takes place, showing how they fused with other forces – most notably 
European antisemitism – to shape and ultimately disfigure the 20th century.

3. Heart of Darkness 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/heart-of-darkness-17.html> by Joseph Conrad 
(1899)
You can read this in a day but you can then spend years reading the many books 
written about it – few novels in history have generated so much speculation and 
debate. That’s because as well as being one of the most compelling and shocking 
novels, it is also a brilliant exercise in ambiguity. Whose voice do we hear, 
the unnamed narrator or the witness to events, Marlow? Where is the book set? 
Conrad never mentions Africa or the Congo but talks of a great river in a great 
continent. The biggest mystery of all is who – if anyone – was the central 
character, Kurtz, based upon? A whole array of possible contenders, men whom 
Conrad may have met during his time in the Congo, have been assembled by 
historians. To me it is impossible to get a rounded sense of the age of empire 
– the audacity and the horror – without reading Conrad.

4. Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/straw-dogs.html> by John Gray (2007)
Since Darwin, millions of people have come to terms with the idea that humans 
are little different from other animals. InStraw Dogs John Gray forces us to 
examine the difficult corollaries of that easy statement. It’s a book that’s 
become infamous for its pessimism yet I’ve always found it enormously 
liberating, as it challenges so many of my own unexamined assumptions. Gray 
dissects humanity’s seemingly innate need for the consolation of religion, our 
addiction to the myth of progress and our Darwin-proof belief that we “belong 
to a species which can be master of its own destiny”. This, the so-called 
“philosopher of pessimism” warns us, is “faith not science”.

5. The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Vols 1-5
Orwell is a victim of his own versatility. Because he transitioned from 
journalist to novelist his posthumous fame centres on the novels1984 and Animal 
Farm. Yet for most of his life Orwell was a working journalist and eloquent 
witness to the political ructions of the 1930s and 1940s. These volumes of his 
collected journalism are not merely a masterclass in journalistic prose, 
they’re history written in real time. No one skewered the hypocrisies of his 
age with greater precision and no one was more willing to own up to his own 
mistakes and misplaced loyalties. In my view, if you’re a journalist and Orwell
isn’tone of your heroes then something’s gone wrong.
