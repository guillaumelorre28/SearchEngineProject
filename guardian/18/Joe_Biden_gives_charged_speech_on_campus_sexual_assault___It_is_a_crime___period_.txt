Vice-President Joe Biden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden> spoke 
emphatically about the need to address sexual assault on college campuses on 
Tuesday as part of multi-campus tour to highlight the issue.

“The legal system and the court of public opinion still allowed [sic] 
prosecutors to ask victims of rape: ‘What were you wearing?’” he told nearly 
1,000 students at the University of Pittsburgh. “What difference does it make, 
what a woman was wearing?”

The city was his first stop in a series of events to discuss sexual assault 
and promote the It’s On Us initiative, launched by the White House in 2014. The 
campaign promotes a pledge to keep women and men safe from sexual assault, and 
focuses in particular on campus sexual assault. Someestimates show that as many 
as one in five women are assaulted during their college years

. Biden implored students to intervene and prevent sexual violence.

“We have to change the culture that allows the abuse of women and men, and it 
must be clear that no means no,” Biden said. “And when consent cannot be given 
it is assault, it is a crime, period.”

Biden spoke previously about campus rape

 and the It’s On Us campaign at the Oscars in February, where he introduced 
Lady Gaga. Gaga performed on stage surrounded by dozens of survivors of sexual 
assault.

Biden is scheduled to visit the University of Nevada in Las Vegas and the 
University of Colorado in Boulder later this week.
