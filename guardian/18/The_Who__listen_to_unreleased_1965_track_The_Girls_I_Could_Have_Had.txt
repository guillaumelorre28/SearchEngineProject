Next month sees the release of a super deluxe remastered edition of the Who’s 
1965 debut album, My Generation. Naturally, as these things do, it comes in 
multiple formats – five CDs or three LPs, a double LP version following in 
February – with the usual baubles and bangles in the form of books and insert.

The big draw for Who fans is likely to be three songs previously unreleased in 
any form. The Girls I Could Have Had, As Children We Grew and My Own Love were 
recorded as demos in 1965 byPete Townshend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/petetownshend> at his flat in Chesham Place 
in central London, where he also wrote My Generation.

Have a listen to The Girls I Could Have Had below – and here’s what Townshend 
has to say about the song.

I have often said about my early songs that I tried hard to appeal to Roger’s 
sense of late teenage machismo. Either that, or I attempted to sound like Jan & 
Dean so that Keith Moon – who was a surf music fan – would get behind the song. 
Here, a rather machismo and bragging song slipped away because it was more 
about me than Roger Daltrey, and certainly not a surf number. It’s about my 
lack of success with girls when I lived at Chesham Place, partly because I 
spent all my time in my studio. Roger did very well with girls; it would never 
have worked for him to sing this lyric. The lyric is also fantastical. I make 
it sound as though I was turning down girls every day. In real life I was 
probably piqued that rarely happened. My tape machine was my mistress.

 * My Generation – Super Deluxe Edition is released on 18 November.
