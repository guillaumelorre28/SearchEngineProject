Lol (Laurence) Tolhurst and Robert Smith met aged five at primary school in 
Crawley, West Sussex, in 1964. Later, while at St Wilfrid’s Catholic secondary 
school, they formed a band – Easy Cure – with fellow pupil Michael Dempsey 
(with Smith on lead guitar and vocals, Tolhurst on drums and Dempsey on bass). 
In 1978 they changed their name to the Cure, signed to Fiction Records and 
released their first single, Killing an Arab, a two-and-a-half minute slice of 
post-punk pop inspired by Albert Camus’ novelL’Etranger. The Cure’s early, 
doomy phase brought them a devoted UK fanbase, with the band going on to huge 
international success with more pop-leaning albums includingThe Head on the Door
 (1985, by which time Tolhurst had moved onto keyboards) andKiss Me, Kiss Me, 
Kiss Me (1987). The band’s lineup changed often, with Smith and Tolhurst the 
only constants, until 1989 when Tolhurst, by then an alcoholic, was asked to 
leave the band. In 1994, he sued Smith for royalties and joint ownership of the 
band’s name and lost. The two have since reconciled and played a Cure gig 
together in Sydney in 2011. Tolhurst currently lives in LA where he records 
with his band,Levinhurst <http:>. His new memoir, Cured: The Tale of Two 
Imaginary Boys, is published by Quercus.

The suburbs of the 1970s are a vivid presence in the opening chapters of your 
book. Was forming a band a reaction to the bleakness of it all?
People forget that in 1970s England there was still a hangover from the second 
world war, postwar austerity was still around and that didn’t change till the 
80s. The only thing for us to do – our only defence – was to make our society. 
In that way it was a good thing, because it stimulated people to do stuff. If 
you’re too comfortable, you probably don’t want to change things too much.

I remember looking out into the audience at the 2011 gig seeing somebody that 
I had seen at a show maybe 30 years before

You and Robert found an escape in punk – what was it that appealed?
I can remember the first Clash album, and it was something completely 
different for us. We’d been used to either disco or overblown prog. But the 
energy of punk completely resonated, and that idea that something had to 
change. But then, of course, we put it through a slightly different lens 
because we were more isolated than somebody who was living in the capital; we 
took longer to register how things changed.

There are quite a few violent incidents in the book!
I look back on it now and I realise it was probably all quite dangerous, but 
it was something we were used to. We dressed in old mohair jumpers and 
jumble-sale trousers and walking down the streets in Crawley, people would 
always say things to us. And then sooner or later, someone would come out and 
try to take a pop. At one of our first proper gigs in Soho, we had a lot of 
skinheads there who had assumed something entirely wrong about us from the 
title of Killing an Arab. We were expecting them to lay into us but then the 
biggest guy, with a tattooed eagle on his chest, decided he loved us and after 
that, we were fine. Even at that age, Robert was able to make people feel 
somehow included.

You say Pornography (1982) was your favourite Cure album. Why?
The distillation of the sounds that we had built up by that time. I mean, any 
band that tells you they’ve invented this new sound is being a bit disingenuous 
– you learn it bit by bit – and for us we decided we would play the bits that 
we liked and disregard the rest. And gradually, by that time we got to
Pornography, we’d got to the pinnacle, for us, of the sound we wanted as a 
three-piece band. And I think, in terms of emotional intensity, it’s really the 
most succinct and it works well in that way. I like other albums for different 
things. I mean, thank goodness, we have quite a vast catalogue, so there was a 
lot of room for that.

The Cure had huge success in the US, not always a given with British bands. 
Why?
The early shows, we played with this Boston band Mission of Burma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/05/mission-of-burma-unsound-review>
, who were kindred spirits. We appealed to people who lived in small towns in 
America, the same kind of people as in England, and from very early on we played
lots of small towns, for months and months at a time, in the kind of clubs 
where people would see their local bands. So we really connected with people. 
People still write to me from those towns that saw us back in those days; we’re 
like adopted sons. That’s what worked for the Cure.

You talk very honestly in the book about your descent into alcoholism caused 
by the stresses of touring...
It was a lot of pressure, although, let’s be honest, not the sort of pressure 
you face if you’re working in a factory. But you’re putting people together who 
every night have to be an extreme version of themselves and then you were doing 
long journeys and we’d just be bored. Also most English people drink in one way 
or another, and so that’s where we found ourselves. With that kind of intensity 
and sleep deprivation and everything else, in the end it’s going to turn things 
a little mad.

You describe your legal proceedings against Robert Smith as something you were 
regretting even as you pushed them forward.
I set it in motion because of my resentment [at being pushed out of the band] 
but once these things are started it becomes this unstoppable thing. I’mhonestly
 glad I lost though. I would have had a little more money for a while and I 
would have had some kind of feeling of victory, but I would be back in a very 
bad situation, if I was alive at all.

You wrote to Robert years later to make amends. He wrote straight back. Did 
you expect that?
I didn’t not expect it, does that make sense? That’s what I wanted to explain 
in the book. I knew if I admitted completely to the part I played in the bad 
stuff, then anyone who is really a friend would say, “OK, I forgive you.” 
Sometimes people see a band in a different way and they forget it’s just people.

How did playing with the Cure again in 2011 feel?
I remember looking out into the audience and seeing somebody that I had 
perhaps seen before at a show maybe 30 years before. They were older, like me, 
but it felt like no time had passed at all, and that was a pretty wonderful 
feeling.

And do you think you will ever make music with Robert again?
The good thing about my life now is that anything is possible, whereas around 
25 years ago, very little was possible for about a year or two, in any way 
shape or form.

Tolhurst’s memoir.
