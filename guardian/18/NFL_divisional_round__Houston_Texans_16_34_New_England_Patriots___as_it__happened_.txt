Texans 16-34 Patriots, Final

New England kneel one more time, and that will do it. 


That’s six straight AFC Championship games for New England as they get set for 
either KC or Pittsburgh next Sunday. When will this ever end?

Houston? They did a great job, we’re grateful for a semi-competitive game - 
they had their chances, this could have been more, but they just didn’t have 
enough and the kid at QB has some issues.


That’s all for now - join us tomorrow for much, much more live NFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> football. Until then, good morning, 
good afternoon and good night.

INTERCEPTION! Texans 16-34 Patriots, 2:25 4th quarter

Osweiler back to pass - and he delivers, an interception, this time to Duron 
Harmon, and that’s the kids third INT this half!

I expect Mr Philip to be emailing in again any second now.

Texans 16-34 Patriots, 3:21 4th quarter

Fiedorowicz ( I spelled that without looking, is it right?) - he has a first 
down catch as we play out the string in gar-bage time. It’s a 17-yard gain on 
the near sideline.

Houston are actually driving here but this won’t help. Holding, no74 offense 
(Chris Clark), still first down. That pushes Houston to the 41 where it’s 1st & 
20...

Grimes gets much of that down to the 26, 2nd & 5.

FIELD GOAL! Texans 16-34 Patriots, 6:37 4th quarter

It’s good, and the Pats are covering that spread. 

If you’re scoring at home, the Pats did not call time, so they have all three 
and that’s actually irrelevant because this one is just about over.

Texans 16-31 Patriots, 6:49 4th quarter


Bennett is up and off the field under his own power - good news. 


Brady is back to pass again - no idea why, and is running, running, and holds 
on to it a little too long and gets punished for it, pushed out of bounds by 
Mercilus.


Now Lewis fumbles again, but Joe Thuney pounces on the football and here comes 
New England trying to make it a three possession game with a 43-yard football. 
The Pats call time, their first.

Texans 16-31 Patriots, 7:58 4th quarter


So we’re getting into the kill the clock portion of our program. 


Run run run. Edelman, a reverse goes for 13 yards after a shorter four-yard 
run from Blount.

Then Brady goes for Edelman downfield again, for some reason. Edleman nearly 
made an incredible sideline catch, but lost it right at the end as he bobbled 
it out of bounds.

Now here is more razzle dazzle! What? This time it is an Amendola double 
reverse and there’s Brady throwing a block!

What’s gotten into these guys? 

New England are inside the Texans 30 as that clock burns away. 


Bennett is down for New England - the TE is down after a leg injury. Stand by.

Texans 16-31 Patriots, 10:22 4th quarter

Malcolm Brown just helped himself to Osweiler’s leg, whipping him down for the 
Pats third sack and a nine-yard loss.


Hopkins then has a reception, about nine yards on third down - not enough. 
Houston punt and New England will start from their own 33.

Texans 16-31 Patriots, 11:50 4th quarter

So suddenly, New England are a pint or two from covering the spread, when not 
too long ago, they looked like possible victims in a historic upset.

Funny how that works, isn’t it?

So now Houston has some major work to do, and they start with Miller on the 
ground for a yard.

TOUCHDOWN! Texans 16-31 Patriots, 12:16 4th quarter

Lewis pushes into the endzone, and now he’s got a rushing TD, in addition to a 
TD catch, TD kickoff return, and made a key turnover as well.


That’s some line.

INTERCEPTION! Texans 16-24 Patriots, 12:44 4th quarter

Osweiler, all kinds of time, he fires looking for Hopkins, deflection, INTO 
THE HANDS OF RYAN!

He’s up and running, and takes the ball to the Texans siz-yard line. It’s 1st 
& goal for New England, who will move into the drivers seat if they can punch 
it in!

Texans 16-24 Patriots, 13:00 4th quarter

It’s 3rd & 7 for Tom Brady and the Pats. From the shotgun, Brady has time and 
Edelman open, but he can’t make the catch! A rare misfire from Brady and that 
forces a punt.


Fuller calls for a fair catch with no one around him, for whatever reason, and 
they start from the 10, looking for eight on this drive to somehow tie this 
game up.

FIELD GOAL! Texans 16-24 Patriots, 14:51 4th quarter

We’re into the final frame as we try to figure out who will face the Chiefs or 
Steelers in the AFC Championship game next Sunday.


Osweiler goes deep and that’s nowhere near anyone - so here is Novak for a 
46-yard attempt that is good!

So the Texans turn a turnover into three points - not enough. They really have 
had their opportunities in this game, which has been way WAY more than we ever 
could have asked for as neutrals.

INTERCEPTION! Texans 13-24 Patriots, end of 3rd quarter

New life for the Texans as their D forces a second pick from Tom Brady - 
doubling his interceptions this season. Hal made the play following yet another 
deflection!


Houston must turn this into seven. 


When we return, it’s 3rd & 4 on the Pats 28

Texans 13-24 Patriots, 1:30 3rd quarter

Osweiler airs it out, way down field, over the middle, he throws a strike, but 
it’s through the hands of Fuller! Oh man! Oh my! That is a brutal play for 
Houston: this should be a four-point game.


Instead, New England receive a punt at the 10 after a fair catch. 


That is the moment...or that was the moment.

So, the rule is an incomplete pass, not a fumble, and there is no illegal 
substitution. So it’s 3rd & 8...

Texans 13-24 Patriots, 2:07 3rd quarter


Illegal hands to the face by Valentine costs New England five yards, pushing 
Houston across midfield.


Miller, pushes a head for a few yards. 


Now, we have play-action - Osweiler hit as he throws, it’s McClellin.


Now Patrick Chung is running towards the endzone for New England - what is 
going on?


As it turns out, the Pats illegally substituted. But now they’re saying New 
England has it because the play was ruled a fumble.


I have no idea what’s going on. This is a good time for a commercial, and CBS 
here in the US obliges.


Please stand by.

OK, here we go - five yards for a first down...Osweiler ducks pressure and 
takes off! He has room to roam, and when he finally gets out of bounds on the 
near sideline, he has 18 yards up to their 40!

Osweiler has time, and finds Miller streaking underneath for five yards. It’s 
3rd & 5:

The play clock is down to one second so the Houston QB calls for time and the 
Texans will talk it over.

Fiedorowicz drops a sure first down over the middle on first down, which just 
can not happen here.

Then Osweiler comes back strong! A bullet to Hopkins who breaks free 
underneath for a first down and a gain of about 18!

Texans 13-24 Patriots, 5:56 3rd quarter

It’s 2nd & 20 at the Houston 40 after offensive pass interference. He has to 
throw it away, setting up a 3rd down - Amendola can’t make the catch over the 
middle, so New England have to punt, and it’s a good one!

Matthew Slater makes the catch on the two! That’s where Houston’s offense will 
have to start, a tremendous play by New England’s special teams after a big 
stop by Houston’s D.

Texans 13-24 Patriots, 6:19 3rd quarter

On 2nd & 10, Brady has time, runs to his right, but runs out of real estate 
and throws it away. So here is another third down:

Brady in the gun, pumps, fires, and there’s that man again - it’s Edelman, a 
run towards the flag and a pick up of 26. Edelman, the all-time Pats leader in 
playoff receiving yards, has 134 tonight.


Now Brady is taken down by Clowney after throwing the football and he’s not 
happy. He may have a case.

Ball on the Texans 30.

INTERCEPTION! Texans 13-24 Patriots, 7:19 3rd quarter

It’s 3rd & 4 - an important down coming up here. Osweiler, under center, then 
shifts to the shotgun, back to pass, throws...into the hands of McCourty (he 
plays for New England) and the Pats D have their first turnover of the game, in 
a huge spot for the home team. Osweiler really could not do that.


Nerves are settling in New England. They have the ball at their own 44, with 
their offense drooling for more.

violent flame-out, or do they find a way to settle down and move the ball on 
offense?

Osweiler, off to a good start: play-action, complete to Hopkins in the middle 
for 15 yards.

TOUCHDOWN! Texans 13-24 Patriots, 9:09 3rd quarter

Big 3rd & 3 here for the Texans defense. 


Crowd on their feet with Brady in the shotgun. He has time, throws over the 
shoulder of White and into his hands for the touchdown in the far side of the 
endzone!

It’s a 90-yard drive that has a business as usual look to it as New England 
unlock Houston’s defense, putting pressure on Osweiler and the Texans offense.

Texans 13-17 Patriots, 10:03 3rd quarter


After a holding call, Brady, play-action, finds Hogan on the near sideline - 
that’s 21 more yards, and suddenly, New England can move the ball.

Was it something Belichick said?

Now Lewis is on the ground, running left...no, right, it’s enough for a first 
down as the Pats quickly move to the Houston 30.

Brady is destroyed, but gets it away to Edleman who makes another big catch 
downfield, a huge gain on the near sideline! That’s 26 yards.


They should run that play every down. 

Now Edleman has it again after another Brady throw, this time it’s 14 yards, 
and suddenly New England are at midfield!

Texans 13-17 Patriots, 12:30 3rd quarter


From the shotgun, Osweiler is once again hit as he throws,this time it’s 
deflected and...incomplete. Van Noy set it up with the penetration and the 
Texans punt.

So New England’s defense has some answers of their own - the Pats will start 
at their own 10 after a fair catch by Edelman.

Flowers and Hightower hit Osweiler as he throws on first down. Then Miller has 
room again, this time for about seven, and it’s 3rd and 3 at the Pats 40.

Texans 13-17 Patriots, 13:31 3rd quarter


Here’s Miller up the middle, shakes, bakes, moves left and has room! That’s a 
17 yard gain! It’s their biggest play of the night, say CBS TV here in the US.

Texans 13-17 Patriots, 14:07 3rd quarter


Bouye nearly has an interception on the first play from scrimmage in the 
second half! He really should have had that!

Blount, pushes ahead for two setting up a 3rd & 8 from the NE 27. 


Brady, under pressure from Cushing and Clowney, fires incomplete - so the 
Houston D once again hold up their end of the bargain.

Houston start from their own 36 after a 55-yard punt.

Halftime


OK, I’ve downed a Thai dinner and am back for what could be a historic upset. 
Actually, the Texans, who for my money are one of the most generic, boring 
franchises in North America have a chance to finally make a name for 
themselves, and in the most dramatic of fashion.


But nevermid that for a moment, here’s a few stats. Osweiler is 13/20 for 83 
yards, which is fine because he has a TD and no interceptions. Brady is 8/13 
with 145 yards, most of which came on just two plays. Miller has been decent on 
the ground with 42 yards, while New England have combined for just 17 yards. 
The big stat is turnovers: Houston have taken two to NE’s none.

Texans 13-17 Patriots, halftime

Well, we all expected a dud and what we’ve seen is a Houston defense stand up 
to a dynasty, away from home in less than ideal conditions. It’s as impressive 
as it gets and sets the stage for an unlikely second half of gritty playoff 
football!

FIELD GOAL! Texans 13-17 Patriots, 0:07 2nd quarter

Gostkowski’s chip shot is good from 19, and New England settle for three. 

Take away the special teams TD and New England are down. Actually, if Houston 
take their chances this half, the Texans are up big.

Blount’s two efforts are both denied - Mercilus is there again! A tremendous 
stand before the end of the half, represents what they’ve been able to do this 
half to a tee! 


WOW!

Brady, back to pass, settles in, has a cup of tea, cooks a steak, then decides 
to run to about the one.

Now Brady fires complete to Develin who pushes towards the endzone but is 
denied by Dent and Pleasant - tremendous play by Houston’s defense. Timeout New 
England.

WARNING! Texans 13-14 Patriots, 2:00 2nd quarter

Time ticks away in the half..

...first down, Brady is hit as he throws! Houston’s defense is establishing 
themselves in a major way and we all know Brady does NOT like to get hit (does 
anyone).

But now Brady bounces back, he has time and is firing deep for Edelman, who 
turns around, totally pushes off, and makes the catch!

That’s a much-needed (illegal) 48-yard gain, pushing New England to the 
Houston 18. Lewis then runs for two yards as we hit the two-minute warning.

Texans 13-14 Patriots, 3:54 2nd quarter


Ninkovich steps up and nearly picks off the Houston QB! 

The Texans have to punt - and on the kick there’s a penalty for an illegal 
block in the back, it’s Matthew Slater who is guilty. So New England and their 
rusty offense start at their own 33.

Texans 13-14 Patriots, 4:23 2nd quarter


The Texans are looking for a little bit of room and Miller pushes ahead up the 
middle for four yards.

Then Osweiler under center, and it’s Miller again, this time he gets just two, 
setting up a 3rd & 3.

Texans 13-14 Patriots, 5:30 2nd quarter


It’s 3rd & 6. Brady, in the shotgun - Mercilus breaks with a spin and Brady 
has nowhere to go except the turf!

The Pats turn down the 55-yard field goal and elect to back up Houston’s 
offense - the pooch punt puts the Texans on the five, where they will begin.

Texans 13-14 Patriots, 6:43, 2nd quarter


Brady has a pass broken up by Andre Hal, intended for Lewis on first down. Now 
he’s in the shotgun and looking for Lewis again, this time down the near 
sideline - but he is double teamed and Mercilus, a linebacker, is downfield to 
break it up!

On 3rd & 10 now - Brady chucks it up - it’s short of the receiver, but Hogan 
comes back and gets under it and makes the catch! That’s a huge play on a blitz 
and a gain of 45 yards down to the Houston 37!

Osweiler fires incomplete over the middle - it was short, heading towards 
Hopkins and Ryan almost scooped it off the ground.

The Pats weathered defense holds, and after the punt, New England will start 
at the 17.

Fake hand off to Miller, who shakes out of the backfield and is open - 
Osweiler misfires badly on first down. Now Miller pushes ahead for five, it 
sets up a big 3rd & 5.

Bennett is streaking across the middle towards the near sideline for a short 
reception - it’s 3rd & 5 and BRADY IS SACKED!

Total turn of events in Foxborough! Cushing and Mercilus sandwich Brady and 
the Pats have to punt as the crowd sit in stunned silence.

Solid return from Fuller and the Texans start at the New England 49! 

New England have just nine plays from scrimmage, and the time of possession 
battle is 16:02 to 5:15. Wild!

will be just his seventh snap in the ballgame, a ridiculous stat.

close  
New England kneel one more time, and that will do it. 


That’s six straight AFC Championship games for New England as they get set for 
either KC or Pittsburgh next Sunday. When will this ever end?

Houston? They did a great job, we’re grateful for a semi-competitive game - 
they had their chances, this could have been more, but they just didn’t have 
enough and the kid at QB has some issues.


That’s all for now - join us tomorrow for much, much more live NFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> football. Until then, good morning, 
good afternoon and good night.

 
Texans 16-34 Patriots, 1:19 4th quarter

New England take a knee. That’s one...

 
And I quote...


Well, at one time, you’ve got it, and then you lose it, and it’s gone forever.

 -Sick Boy





 
Osweiler back to pass - and he delivers, an interception, this time to Duron 
Harmon, and that’s the kids third INT this half!

I expect Mr Philip to be emailing in again any second now. 

 
Texans 16-34 Patriots, 3:21 4th quarter

Fiedorowicz ( I spelled that without looking, is it right?) - he has a first 
down catch as we play out the string in gar-bage time. It’s a 17-yard gain on 
the near sideline.

Houston are actually driving here but this won’t help. Holding, no74 offense 
(Chris Clark), still first down. That pushes Houston to the 41 where it’s 1st & 
20...

Grimes gets much of that down to the 26, 2nd & 5. 

 
Email


Michael Philip is back:


“Frock Osweiller, money well spent...”

Surely that’s not a typo...

 
It’s good, and the Pats are covering that spread. 

If you’re scoring at home, the Pats did not call time, so they have all three 
and that’s actually irrelevant because this one is just about over.

 
Texans 16-31 Patriots, 6:49 4th quarter


Bennett is up and off the field under his own power - good news. 


Brady is back to pass again - no idea why, and is running, running, and holds 
on to it a little too long and gets punished for it, pushed out of bounds by 
Mercilus.


Now Lewis fumbles again, but Joe Thuney pounces on the football and here comes 
New England trying to make it a three possession game with a 43-yard football. 
The Pats call time, their first.

 
Texans 16-31 Patriots, 7:58 4th quarter


So we’re getting into the kill the clock portion of our program. 


Run run run. Edelman, a reverse goes for 13 yards after a shorter four-yard 
run from Blount.

Then Brady goes for Edelman downfield again, for some reason. Edleman nearly 
made an incredible sideline catch, but lost it right at the end as he bobbled 
it out of bounds.

Now here is more razzle dazzle! What? This time it is an Amendola double 
reverse and there’s Brady throwing a block!

What’s gotten into these guys? 

New England are inside the Texans 30 as that clock burns away. 


Bennett is down for New England - the TE is down after a leg injury. Stand by. 


 
Texans 16-31 Patriots, 10:22 4th quarter

Malcolm Brown just helped himself to Osweiler’s leg, whipping him down for the 
Pats third sack and a nine-yard loss.


Hopkins then has a reception, about nine yards on third down - not enough. 
Houston punt and New England will start from their own 33.

 
Texans 16-31 Patriots, 11:50 4th quarter

So suddenly, New England are a pint or two from covering the spread, when not 
too long ago, they looked like possible victims in a historic upset.

Funny how that works, isn’t it?

So now Houston has some major work to do, and they start with Miller on the 
ground for a yard.

 
Lewis pushes into the endzone, and now he’s got a rushing TD, in addition to a 
TD catch, TD kickoff return, and made a key turnover as well.


That’s some line. 

 
Osweiler, all kinds of time, he fires looking for Hopkins, deflection, INTO 
THE HANDS OF RYAN!

He’s up and running, and takes the ball to the Texans siz-yard line. It’s 1st 
& goal for New England, who will move into the drivers seat if they can punch 
it in!

 
Texans 16-24 Patriots, 13:00 4th quarter

It’s 3rd & 7 for Tom Brady and the Pats. From the shotgun, Brady has time and 
Edelman open, but he can’t make the catch! A rare misfire from Brady and that 
forces a punt.


Fuller calls for a fair catch with no one around him, for whatever reason, and 
they start from the 10, looking for eight on this drive to somehow tie this 
game up.

 
We’re into the final frame as we try to figure out who will face the Chiefs or 
Steelers in the AFC Championship game next Sunday.


Osweiler goes deep and that’s nowhere near anyone - so here is Novak for a 
46-yard attempt that is good!

So the Texans turn a turnover into three points - not enough. They really have 
had their opportunities in this game, which has been way WAY more than we ever 
could have asked for as neutrals.

 
New life for the Texans as their D forces a second pick from Tom Brady - 
doubling his interceptions this season. Hal made the play following yet another 
deflection!


Houston must turn this into seven. 


When we return, it’s 3rd & 4 on the Pats 28

 
Texans 13-24 Patriots, 1:30 3rd quarter

Osweiler airs it out, way down field, over the middle, he throws a strike, but 
it’s through the hands of Fuller! Oh man! Oh my! That is a brutal play for 
Houston: this should be a four-point game.


Instead, New England receive a punt at the 10 after a fair catch. 


That is the moment...or that was the moment. 

 
Texans 13-24 Patriots, 2:07 3rd quarter


So, the rule is an incomplete pass, not a fumble, and there is no illegal 
substitution. So it’s 3rd & 8...


 
Texans 13-24 Patriots, 2:07 3rd quarter


Illegal hands to the face by Valentine costs New England five yards, pushing 
Houston across midfield.


Miller, pushes a head for a few yards. 


Now, we have play-action - Osweiler hit as he throws, it’s McClellin.


Now Patrick Chung is running towards the endzone for New England - what is 
going on?


As it turns out, the Pats illegally substituted. But now they’re saying New 
England has it because the play was ruled a fumble.


I have no idea what’s going on. This is a good time for a commercial, and CBS 
here in the US obliges.


Please stand by. 

 
Texans 13-24 Patriots, 3:22 3rd quarter


OK, here we go - five yards for a first down...Osweiler ducks pressure and 
takes off! He has room to roam, and when he finally gets out of bounds on the 
near sideline, he has 18 yards up to their 40!


 
Texans 13-24 Patriots, 3:51 3rd quarter


Osweiler has time, and finds Miller streaking underneath for five yards. It’s 
3rd & 5:

The play clock is down to one second so the Houston QB calls for time and the 
Texans will talk it over.


 
Texans 13-24 Patriots, 5:10 3rd quarter


Fiedorowicz drops a sure first down over the middle on first down, which just 
can not happen here.

Then Osweiler comes back strong! A bullet to Hopkins who breaks free 
underneath for a first down and a gain of about 18!




 
Texans 13-24 Patriots, 5:56 3rd quarter

It’s 2nd & 20 at the Houston 40 after offensive pass interference. He has to 
throw it away, setting up a 3rd down - Amendola can’t make the catch over the 
middle, so New England have to punt, and it’s a good one!

Matthew Slater makes the catch on the two! That’s where Houston’s offense will 
have to start, a tremendous play by New England’s special teams after a big 
stop by Houston’s D.

 
Texans 13-24 Patriots, 6:19 3rd quarter

On 2nd & 10, Brady has time, runs to his right, but runs out of real estate 
and throws it away. So here is another third down:

Brady in the gun, pumps, fires, and there’s that man again - it’s Edelman, a 
run towards the flag and a pick up of 26. Edelman, the all-time Pats leader in 
playoff receiving yards, has 134 tonight.


Now Brady is taken down by Clowney after throwing the football and he’s not 
happy. He may have a case.

Ball on the Texans 30. 

 
It’s 3rd & 4 - an important down coming up here. Osweiler, under center, then 
shifts to the shotgun, back to pass, throws...into the hands of McCourty (he 
plays for New England) and the Pats D have their first turnover of the game, in 
a huge spot for the home team. Osweiler really could not do that.


Nerves are settling in New England. They have the ball at their own 44, with 
their offense drooling for more.


 
Texans 13-24 Patriots, 8:09 3rd quarter

So now what? Do the Texans throw all of their first-half performance away in a 
violent flame-out, or do they find a way to settle down and move the ball on 
offense?

Osweiler, off to a good start: play-action, complete to Hopkins in the middle 
for 15 yards.

 
Big 3rd & 3 here for the Texans defense. 


Crowd on their feet with Brady in the shotgun. He has time, throws over the 
shoulder of White and into his hands for the touchdown in the far side of the 
endzone!

It’s a 90-yard drive that has a business as usual look to it as New England 
unlock Houston’s defense, putting pressure on Osweiler and the Texans offense.




 
Texans 13-17 Patriots, 10:03 3rd quarter


After a holding call, Brady, play-action, finds Hogan on the near sideline - 
that’s 21 more yards, and suddenly, New England can move the ball.

Was it something Belichick said?

Now Lewis is on the ground, running left...no, right, it’s enough for a first 
down as the Pats quickly move to the Houston 30. 

 
Texans 13-17 Patriots, 11:34 3rd quarter


Brady is destroyed, but gets it away to Edleman who makes another big catch 
downfield, a huge gain on the near sideline! That’s 26 yards.


They should run that play every down. 

Now Edleman has it again after another Brady throw, this time it’s 14 yards, 
and suddenly New England are at midfield!

I imagine Hunter speaks for most of those folks in states north and east of 
New York.

 
Texans 13-17 Patriots, 12:30 3rd quarter


From the shotgun, Osweiler is once again hit as he throws,this time it’s 
deflected and...incomplete. Van Noy set it up with the penetration and the 
Texans punt.

So New England’s defense has some answers of their own - the Pats will start 
at their own 10 after a fair catch by Edelman.


 
Texans 13-17 Patriots, 12:58 3rd quarter


Flowers and Hightower hit Osweiler as he throws on first down. Then Miller has 
room again, this time for about seven, and it’s 3rd and 3 at the Pats 40.


 
Texans 13-17 Patriots, 13:31 3rd quarter


Here’s Miller up the middle, shakes, bakes, moves left and has room! That’s a 
17 yard gain! It’s their biggest play of the night, say CBS TV here in the US.


 
Texans 13-17 Patriots, 14:07 3rd quarter


Bouye nearly has an interception on the first play from scrimmage in the 
second half! He really should have had that!

Blount, pushes ahead for two setting up a 3rd & 8 from the NE 27. 


Brady, under pressure from Cushing and Clowney, fires incomplete - so the 
Houston D once again hold up their end of the bargain.

Houston start from their own 36 after a 55-yard punt. 

 
How will it end?

 
Halftime


OK, I’ve downed a Thai dinner and am back for what could be a historic upset. 
Actually, the Texans, who for my money are one of the most generic, boring 
franchises in North America have a chance to finally make a name for 
themselves, and in the most dramatic of fashion.


But nevermid that for a moment, here’s a few stats. Osweiler is 13/20 for 83 
yards, which is fine because he has a TD and no interceptions. Brady is 8/13 
with 145 yards, most of which came on just two plays. Miller has been decent on 
the ground with 42 yards, while New England have combined for just 17 yards. 
The big stat is turnovers: Houston have taken two to NE’s none.

 
Well, we all expected a dud and what we’ve seen is a Houston defense stand up 
to a dynasty, away from home in less than ideal conditions. It’s as impressive 
as it gets and sets the stage for an unlikely second half of gritty playoff 
football!

 
Gostkowski’s chip shot is good from 19, and New England settle for three. 

Take away the special teams TD and New England are down. Actually, if Houston 
take their chances this half, the Texans are up big.

 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 0:10 2nd quarter

Blount’s two efforts are both denied - Mercilus is there again! A tremendous 
stand before the end of the half, represents what they’ve been able to do this 
half to a tee! 


WOW!

 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 0:19 2nd quarter


Brady, back to pass, settles in, has a cup of tea, cooks a steak, then decides 
to run to about the one.

Now Brady fires complete to Develin who pushes towards the endzone but is 
denied by Dent and Pleasant - tremendous play by Houston’s defense. Timeout New 
England.


 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 1:21 2nd quarter


Under center is Brady, he has Hogan who is streaking towards the far sideline 
- it’s a first down to the Texans two!


 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 1:30 2nd quarter

Lewis, outside to the far sideline, down to the 10, setting up a 3rd & 2. 

 
Time ticks away in the half..

...first down, Brady is hit as he throws! Houston’s defense is establishing 
themselves in a major way and we all know Brady does NOT like to get hit (does 
anyone).

But now Brady bounces back, he has time and is firing deep for Edelman, who 
turns around, totally pushes off, and makes the catch!

That’s a much-needed (illegal) 48-yard gain, pushing New England to the 
Houston 18. Lewis then runs for two yards as we hit the two-minute warning.


 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 3:54 2nd quarter


Ninkovich steps up and nearly picks off the Houston QB! 

The Texans have to punt - and on the kick there’s a penalty for an illegal 
block in the back, it’s Matthew Slater who is guilty. So New England and their 
rusty offense start at their own 33.


 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 4:23 2nd quarter


The Texans are looking for a little bit of room and Miller pushes ahead up the 
middle for four yards.

Then Osweiler under center, and it’s Miller again, this time he gets just two, 
setting up a 3rd & 3.


 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 5:30 2nd quarter


It’s 3rd & 6. Brady, in the shotgun - Mercilus breaks with a spin and Brady 
has nowhere to go except the turf!

The Pats turn down the 55-yard field goal and elect to back up Houston’s 
offense - the pooch punt puts the Texans on the five, where they will begin.

 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 6:43, 2nd quarter


Brady has a pass broken up by Andre Hal, intended for Lewis on first down. Now 
he’s in the shotgun and looking for Lewis again, this time down the near 
sideline - but he is double teamed and Mercilus, a linebacker, is downfield to 
break it up!

On 3rd & 10 now - Brady chucks it up - it’s short of the receiver, but Hogan 
comes back and gets under it and makes the catch! That’s a huge play on a blitz 
and a gain of 45 yards down to the Houston 37!


 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 7:48, 2nd quarter


Osweiler fires incomplete over the middle - it was short, heading towards 
Hopkins and Ryan almost scooped it off the ground.

The Pats weathered defense holds, and after the punt, New England will start 
at the 17.


 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 8:08, 2nd quarter

Fake hand off to Miller, who shakes out of the backfield and is open - 
Osweiler misfires badly on first down. Now Miller pushes ahead for five, it 
sets up a big 3rd & 5.

 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 8:43, 2nd quarter


Bennett is streaking across the middle towards the near sideline for a short 
reception - it’s 3rd & 5 and BRADY IS SACKED!

Total turn of events in Foxborough! Cushing and Mercilus sandwich Brady and 
the Pats have to punt as the crowd sit in stunned silence.

Solid return from Fuller and the Texans start at the New England 49! 

New England have just nine plays from scrimmage, and the time of possession 
battle is 16:02 to 5:15. Wild!


 
Texans 13-14 Patriots, 10:43, 2nd quarter

Lewis is chased out of bounds on the kickoff and here comes Tom Brady for what 
will be just his seventh snap in the ballgame, a ridiculous stat.


New England start on the 17.
