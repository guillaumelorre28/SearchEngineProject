The Colombians celebrate – they’ve won their first Olympic point against the 
best team in the world. USA were the better team, on balance, but one 
goalkeeping error and one piece of brilliance have Colombia a share of the 
points. No blame attached to Hope Solo for the second goal, though.

90 min: What a brilliant goal from the Colombian. It was such a tight angle, 
with her left foot from the right side, but she hit it with pace and dip, and 
it beat Solo and nestled in the top corner. Outstanding!

68 min: There’s much more space now for USA to exploit. Colombia have tired 
somewhat, but they’re also prepared to commit more players forward. Usme 
produces some lovely skill by the corner flag, which brings gasps from the 
crowd, but it comes to naught.

64 min: Colombia clear the corner, but it’s tossed back in towards Press, who 
heads wide. France now lead 2-0 against New Zealand, but if USA win here, 
they’ll top the group regardless.

60 min: USA had attacked with vigor, and Dunn went down the left, taking a 
clutch of defenders with her. Her cross was missed by everyone, but Pugh 
controlled at the back post, took a touch inside, and fired a shot past a posse 
of defenders on the line. USA lead, and it’s deserved.

50 min: Horan is denied by Sepulveda! Lovely build up, and Horan just tried to 
bend it round the corner, but the Colombian stopper pushed it over the bar. 
Sent in, and Echeverri cranes her neck to head it clear.

46 min: France still leading New Zealand at the half. And a change for 
Colombia: Isabella Echeverri is on for Orianica Velasquez. Oh, and Carli Lloyd

43 min: Press found Lloyd with a lovely flick round the corner, Lloyd smashed 
it at goal, and Sepulveda did well to get hands to it, but it bounced up and 
off the bar, and Dunn reacted quickest to prod home. Normal service appears to 
have been resumed.

40 min: Oh, Sepulveda saves from Press! It was just a long hoof from the back, 
but Press read it well, beat Arias to the ball, but couldn’t beat Sepulveda, 
who had come off limits to make herself big. Good save, but Press was all 
alone, and would presumably like to have that one back.

We’re going to wrap this blog up now. Well done to Colombia, but they go home, 
and USA march through in first place. Thanks for reading – bye.
 
The Colombians celebrate – they’ve won their first Olympic point against the 
best team in the world. USA were the better team, on balance, but one 
goalkeeping error and one piece of brilliance have Colombia a share of the 
points. No blame attached to Hope Solo for the second goal, though.
 
And the Colombians earn an historic point!
 
90 min +2: A minute left, and USA win a corner.
 
90 min: What a brilliant goal from the Colombian. It was such a tight angle, 
with her left foot from the right side, but she hit it with pace and dip, and 
it beat Solo and nestled in the top corner. Outstanding!
 
Another free kick from Catalina Usme – and it was brilliant!
 
89 min: Colombia win a free kick in the final third. Last chance? 
 
87 min: Nice work from Pugh, who drives forward and feeds Morgan, who goes to 
the corner flag. Gaitan is booked for an earlier infraction.
 
85 min: Yellow card to Ali Krieger for time-wasting, which seems a bit unfair.
 
82 min: Still time for more goals, although neither side seems to be in a 
great hurry to change that.
 
79 min: These players have played three games in six days. This has been some 
effort.
 
77 min: Usme shoots, and it’s off the top of the crossbar! What an effort! 
Solo might have had that covered – it was pretty central – but that was a 
fabulous strike from long range.
 
76 min: Colombia haven’t really managed to create anything since the goal, but 
they’ve got a free kick 40 yards from goal, and a chance to get it in the box.
 
74 min: Pugh burns Clavijo on the left side, and cuts it back for Long, who, 
weirdly, went with the outside of her right foot rather than her left, and her 
effort was blocked.
 
72 min: Yellow card for Liana Salazar for a foul on Long, and the crowd 
whistle and jeer. She caught Long in the face but was perhaps a bit unlucky: it 
didn’t appear to be intentional.
 
70 min: USA happy to keep the ball for now.
 
68 min: There’s much more space now for USA to exploit. Colombia have tired 
somewhat, but they’re also prepared to commit more players forward. Usme 
produces some lovely skill by the corner flag, which brings gasps from the 
crowd, but it comes to naught.
 
65 min: Final change for USA: Morgan Brian, who’s been impressive, is replaced 
by Allie Long.
 
64 min: Colombia clear the corner, but it’s tossed back in towards Press, who 
heads wide. France now lead 2-0 against New Zealand, but if USA win here, 
they’ll top the group regardless.
 
63 min: Horan’s header – tipped over by Sepulveda!
 
61 min: Pugh has the ball in the net, but it’s offside. That was a bum pass by 
Press – she’d have been better off taking the shot. For Colombia, Diana Ospina 
is on for Lady Andrade.
 
60 min: USA had attacked with vigor, and Dunn went down the left, taking a 
clutch of defenders with her. Her cross was missed by everyone, but Pugh 
controlled at the back post, took a touch inside, and fired a shot past a posse 
of defenders on the line. USA lead, and it’s deserved.
 
And it’s the 18-year-old!
 
55 min: USA should really be ahead, considering the amount of possession 
they’ve had and the chances they’ve created. But they aren’t!
 
53 min: Morgan fizzes one just over the bar! Long ball from Press, Morgan 
races over the top, and the control is perfect, but the shot is just too high!
 
50 min: Horan is denied by Sepulveda! Lovely build up, and Horan just tried to 
bend it round the corner, but the Colombian stopper pushed it over the bar. 
Sent in, and Echeverri cranes her neck to head it clear.
 
48 min: USA beginning the second half as they finished the first: on the front 
foot.
 
46 min: France still leading New Zealand at the half. And a change for 
Colombia: Isabella Echeverri is on for Orianica Velasquez. Oh, and Carli Lloyd 
seems to have been withdrawn for Alex Morgan.
 
That’s the half, and it was reasonably entertaining! See you shortly for more.
 
45 min +1: Pugh goes to the byline, but can’t quite wrap her foot around it, 
and it’s behind for a goal kick.
 
45 min: Two minutes of stoppage time. Horan’s had a good game in midfield, by 
the way.
 
44 min: Horan finds some space in the box but heads over! Unlucky.
 
43 min: Press found Lloyd with a lovely flick round the corner, Lloyd smashed 
it at goal, and Sepulveda did well to get hands to it, but it bounced up and 
off the bar, and Dunn reacted quickest to prod home. Normal service appears to 
have been resumed.

 
Crystal Dunn! USA are level!
 
41 min: Foul on Horan by Clavijo, right on the edge of the box, but there was 
an offside call, and it’ll be a Colombia free kick.
 
40 min: Oh, Sepulveda saves from Press! It was just a long hoof from the back, 
but Press read it well, beat Arias to the ball, but couldn’t beat Sepulveda, 
who had come off limits to make herself big. Good save, but Press was all 
alone, and would presumably like to have that one back.
 
38 min: Horan miscontrols by the left touchline, and it’s out for a Colombia 
throw. France are leading New Zealand 1-0, by the way.
 
37 min: O’Hara’s ball in, right-footed, from the left flank, and Dunn heads 
wide! She was free in the box, but never really looked confident with the 
header. If only that was Carli Lloyd, eh?
 
34 min: USA were in cruise control up until that goal; now they’re finding 
life just a touch more difficult. Colombia happy to sit on their lead.
 
32 min: Well, that’s Rapinoe’s day done: she was only scheduled to play half 
an hour, and Mallory Pugh is on her stead. Purely a precautionary measure for a 
player returning from a bad injury. Some really good things from Rapinoe near 
Colombia’s goal, but a daft tackle for the Colombia opener.
