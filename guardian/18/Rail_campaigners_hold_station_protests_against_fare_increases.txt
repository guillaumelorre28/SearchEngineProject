Campaigners have braved freezing temperatures to protest against the new 
year’s hike in rail fares at dozens of stations in England and Scotland.

Action For Rail staged the demonstrations after fares rose on Monday by an 
average of 2.3%, almost four times the rate of inflation.

At King’s Cross in London the Fair Fares choir from the Campaign for Better 
Transport <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> entertained commuters with 
a protest song accompanied by a string quartet. Singing to the tune of Ode to 
Joy the song began: “Fares are rising, pay not changing, overcrowding just gets 
worse ... standing in a toilet doorway that’s no way to start the day.”

Josephine Rossi, a part-time executive assistant at a charity, said she spent 
a third of her pay on rail fares, after childcare and pension costs.

“Today I paid £172 for a week’s travel from Ashford in Kent. That is simply 
unaffordable. I work in Victoria but I’m forced into using the high-speed link 
to King’s Cross because the Southern train service to Victoria is so long and 
unreliable.”

Rossi said she was often unable to get a seat on the train and claimed many of 
her friends could not afford to work in London because of the cost of travel.

“It is £650 per month to pay to travel so any benefits you get from moving out 
of London to chase cheaper house prices just completely disappear. Some of my 
friends have had to turn down part-time jobs in London and take a full-time job 
in Ashford, leaving a very young child at home, because they couldn’t afford 
the train fares. Lots of companies are embracing flexible working but train 
companies aren’t catching up.”

The protest at King’s Cross was joined by the transport union leaders Mick 
Cash and Manuel Cortes, the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, and the 
shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry.

Speaking to the Guardian, Thornberry accused rail companies of “whacking up 
fares … much greater than the amount of money people are getting in their 
wages”.

She said Labour’s plan to renationalise the railways was popular with the 
public.

“The majority of people think rail should be in public hands and we think so 
too. Bread and butter issues like how much it costs to get to work are 
absolutely hardcore Labour issues that I campaign on like everybody else.”

“Southern rail keeps falling over and it reminds people of the incompetence of 
some of these rail companies and the fact that people’s lives are miserable 
because of bad management and profits being made out of their misery and it 
should be back in public hands. It is a simple case.”


The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was also billed to be at the protest, but 
posted a video message instead.

He said: “Privatised rail franchises have become a licence to print money.” He 
said Labour would create a “publicly owned and publicly accountable rail system 
to be proud of”.

Campaigners were planning to stage protests at more than 100 stations. Those 
that did take place included Eastbourne, Manchester, Doncaster, Grimsby, 
Bolton, Birmingham and several other London stations.

This year’s rise in fares is the highest since January 2014 when they 
increased by 2.8%.


Figures vary between operators, with fares on Virgin Trains East Coast 
services up by 4.9%.

The government uses the previous July’s retail prices index (RPI) measure of 
inflation to determine increases in regulated fares. In 2016 it was was 1.9%. 
This applies to about 40% of all tickets, including season tickets on most 
commuter routes and some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys. 
Train operating companies set the prices of other tickets but are bound by 
competition rules.

Bruce Williamson, of the independent campaign group Railfuture, called on the 
government to use the consumer price index for regulated fare rises rather than 
RPI, claiming it is a “much more accurate figure” for measuring inflation.

He said: “This is only 0.6%, which would be a much more reasonable fare 
increase.”

According to the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, about 
97p in every pound paid by passengers goes back into running and improving 
services.

RDG’s chief executive, Paul Plummer, said: “Nobody wants to pay more to travel 
to work and at the moment, in some places, people aren’t getting the service 
they are paying for.

“However, increases to season tickets are set by government. Money from fares 
is helping to sustain investment in the longer, newer trains and more punctual 
journeys that passengers want.”

Virgin Trains East Coast said an overhaul of its pricing strategy would mean 
there would be an extra 10,000 discounted advanced fares available every week.

The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said: “We are delivering the biggest 
rail modernisation programme for more than a century, providing more seats and 
services.

“We have always fairly balanced the cost of this investment between the 
taxpayer and the passenger.”
