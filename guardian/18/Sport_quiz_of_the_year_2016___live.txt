Thanks to everyone who took part today. The standard was typically high, with 
a few people scoring as many as 57 out of 60. We’ll be in touch with all of the 
winners by email to offer them a choice of prizes. We won’t name and shame them 
here in case their bosses discover that they’ve been on our website for most of 
the working day. See you next year. And thanks again.

Round three: who said these quotes?

1. “There you go, I’m the greatest.”

2. “You wave your finger ‘No1’ and you’ve been caught drug cheating … I’m not 
a fan”

3. “My last game tomorrow at Parc des Princes. I came like a king, left like a 
legend”

4. “It’s not an issue. About 80% of you here have at some point scratched your 
balls. Therefore, everything is good.”

5. “It’s like we live in a bubble. Compared to the rest of society, we earn a 
ridiculous amount. It’s unfathomable.”

6. “When they jump without me, do you think it’s honest? Of course I will 
congratulate the winner, but I’m sure she will not feel it’s a real gold 
because she didn’t beat me.”

7. “We all got a receipt, 18 receipts, 18 credit cards, it was the most 
ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I have never seen anything like that before.”

8. “I don’t want to be known as the idiot who urinated in a pint glass”

9. “I have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya’s later”

10. “They need to silence the pudgy, basement-dwelling, irritants, stuffed on 
cookie dough and pissy beer, pausing between mouthfuls of hot dog so they can 
scream ‘Baba booey’ until their jelly faces turn red.”

Welcome to the Guardian Sport quiz of the year

The President of the United States has been elected. The Ballon d’Or winner 
has been crowned. And now it’s time for the big one: which proud Guardian 
reader will come out on top in our live sports quiz of the year?

The rules are roughly the same as ever, but people misunderstand them every 
year, so listen up: there will be six rounds of questions, posted at regular 
intervals from 12.30pm to 1.30pm GMT. At the end of the quiz, a form will be 
posted in which you have one hour to send in your answers. As soon as the 
unlucky work experience kid has counted up all the scores, we’ll reveal the 
right answers and the winners will be crowned. We’ll give away as many prizes 
as possible/as many sports books as we can find lying around the office.

That all make sense? Good. Here are the rounds:

 * Round One: General knowledge - 12.30pm 
 * Round Two: Football - 12.45pm 
 * Round Three: Quotes - 12.55pm 
 * Round Four: Olympics - 1.05pm 
 * Round Five: Odds & ends - 1.15pm 
 * Round Six: Pictures - 1.30pm 
Any questions? Mail them to Paul.Campbell@theguardian.com and I’ll do my best 
to answer them.

Round three: who said these quotes?

1. “There you go, I’m the greatest.”

2. “You wave your finger ‘No1’ and you’ve been caught drug cheating … I’m not 
a fan”

3. “My last game tomorrow at Parc des Princes. I came like a king, left like a 
legend”

4. “It’s not an issue. About 80% of you here have at some point scratched your 
balls. Therefore, everything is good.”

5. “It’s like we live in a bubble. Compared to the rest of society, we earn a 
ridiculous amount. It’s unfathomable.”

6. “When they jump without me, do you think it’s honest? Of course I will 
congratulate the winner, but I’m sure she will not feel it’s a real gold 
because she didn’t beat me.”

7. “We all got a receipt, 18 receipts, 18 credit cards, it was the most 
ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I have never seen anything like that before.”

8. “I don’t want to be known as the idiot who urinated in a pint glass”

9. “I have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya’s later”

10. “They need to silence the pudgy, basement-dwelling, irritants, stuffed on 
cookie dough and pissy beer, pausing between mouthfuls of hot dog so they can 
scream ‘Baba booey’ until their jelly faces turn red.”

 
The quotes round is coming up next, which gives us a good excuse to look back 
on Steve “it’s been the perfect response” McClaren’s unfortunate commentary 
during the England v Iceland match at Euro 2016:

quiz. Oh, and if you Google any answers, you’ll have your own conscience to 
deal with.)
 
Fifteen minutes to go. Play this 30 times in quick succession to build up the 
tension:
 
“Yes, yes, President, Ballon d’Or and the what not,” emails Chris Drew. “But 
can the Guardian quiz beat the real quiz of the week?”

No, I don’t think we can. What a theme tune.

Welcome to the Guardian Sport quiz of the year

The President of the United States has been elected. The Ballon d’Or winner 
has been crowned. And now it’s time for the big one: which proud Guardian 
reader will come out on top in our live sports quiz of the year?

The rules are roughly the same as ever, but people misunderstand them every 
year, so listen up: there will be six rounds of questions, posted at regular 
intervals from 12.30pm to 1.30pm GMT. At the end of the quiz, a form will be 
posted in which you have one hour to send in your answers. As soon as the 
unlucky work experience kid has counted up all the scores, we’ll reveal the 
right answers and the winners will be crowned. We’ll give away as many prizes 
as possible/as many sports books as we can find lying around the office.

That all make sense? Good. Here are the rounds:

 * Round One: General knowledge - 12.30pm 
 * Round Two: Football - 12.45pm 
 * Round Three: Quotes - 12.55pm 
 * Round Four: Olympics - 1.05pm 
 * Round Five: Odds & ends - 1.15pm 
 * Round Six: Pictures - 1.30pm 
Any questions? Mail them to Paul.Campbell@theguardian.com and I’ll do my best 
to answer them.
