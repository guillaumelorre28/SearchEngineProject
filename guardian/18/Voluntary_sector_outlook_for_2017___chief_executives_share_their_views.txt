“I’m looking forward to working with communities up and down the UK who are 
providing emergency food, support and hope to people who would otherwise face 
hunger. It’s both humbling and inspiring to know that you are working alongside 
thousands of volunteers tackling poverty in food banks across the country.”
David McAuley, chief executive,The Trussell Trust 
<https://www.trusselltrust.org/>

Standing up for shared values

“We are looking forward to voluntary sector campaigners getting on to the 
front foot and finding ways to work together to stand up for the values most 
people still share: an open diverse society, based on respect for civil 
liberties and social justice. We need to get behind Jo Cox’s vision that we are 
far more united and have far more in common with each other than the things 
that divide us.”Fiona Weir, chief executive, Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust

Becoming a place of sanctuary

“We are chairing Reading’s bid to become a City of Sanctuary 
<https://cityofsanctuary.org/>. We have made huge progress and the council has 
just passed a unanimous, cross-party motion of support. We are looking forward 
to being one of many organisations that come together in 2017 to host the City 
of Sanctuary national conference and being awarded City of Sanctuary status.”
Nick Harborne, manager, Reading Refugee Support Group

“Working with our partners around the world to help build peace, especially in 
countries with exciting new opportunities such as Colombia, as well as pushing 
forward the case for more investment in peacebuilding and preventing violence. 
In 2017 Sweden takes its place on the UN security council and in September, the 
UN has a special focus on conflict prevention so it’s a good moment to call for 
radical change.”Harriet Lamb, chief executive, International Alert

Highlighting mental health issues on Vincent van Gogh’s birthday

“2017 is a very exciting year for The Yellow House 
<http://yellowhouseliverpool.blogspot.co.uk/p/about-us.html?view=snapshot>. We 
will be naming 30 March, Vincent van Gogh’s birthday,International Yellow Day 
<https://www.facebook.com/IndependentLiverpool/posts/960080374075717>, to 
highlight mental health issues.

Van Gogh <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/van-gogh> suffered for most 
of his life from isolation, loneliness and depression, and eventually took his 
own life. We are asking people to wear something yellow on 30 March as a sign 
of solidarity with those members of our community who are suffering with mental 
health issues.”George McKane, founder, The Yellow House

What are you worried about and why?

Emergency support becoming the ‘new normal’

“In 2015/16, more than 1.1m three-day emergency food supplies were provided to 
people by Trussell Trust food banks. I’m worried that in 2017 we may see a new 
record high in the volume of support people require. We urgently need progress; 
the level of support needed from Trussell Trust food banks this year must not 
become the new normal.” DM

the impact of financial pressures on NHS England; we’re seeing worrying funding 
decisions, such as the recent decision todeny funding for second stem 
transplants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/nhs-cancer-second-stem-cell-transplants-funding>
, which effectively means a backwards step when it comes to access to 
treatment. We’re doing everything we can to get this decision overturned.”Henny

“I am worried about two things. First, the uncertain implications of Brexit 
over the coming years may lead toslower research progress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/jul/04/why-brexit-is-bad-news-for-cancer-research>
, and reduced levels of health and social care, for the 7 million people in the 
UK living with heart and circulatory disease. Second, the UK charity sector is 
held in the highest esteem globally, and is made up of amazing examples of 
care, compassion and effective social action. No charity gets it all right all 
the time. But public trust and confidence in the work of dedicated staff and 
inspirational volunteers hasrecently been damaged 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/28/trust-charities-low-charitable-work-public>
 and must be restored if we can continue doing our lifesaving work.”Simon 
Gillespie, chief executive, British Heart Foundation

Lack of leadership on global violence

“If the UN does not make the radical changes needed to put peace first, bad 
global geopolitics will trump action. In 2016, from the tragedy in Aleppo to 
northern Nigeria, violence rose, along with intolerance and hatred. Governments 
are simply not addressing the root causes of violence: the world spends 250 
times more on the military than on peacebuilding.”HL

If you could achieve only one thing in 2017, what would it be?

“Survival. After 24 years supporting refugees and asylum seekers Reading 
Refugee Support Group’s services are needed more now than they ever have been. 
We are absorbing core funding cuts at the same time as experiencing increasing 
demand for our services. It took us five days last month to secure safe 
accommodation and support for a trafficked mum and her baby who were literally 
deposited on to the street, homeless with their entire life’s possessions 
packed in two large suitcases.

No other charity or local authority department would help. What sort of 
society have we become? The international refugee crisis is just beginning. We 
have no idea how the UK will adapt or respond but if we close due to a lack of 
core funding, Reading will be a poorer place as a result.”NH

Fund even more world-class research into heart disease

“I would love to say that next year we could cure heart and circulatory 
disease, to end the devastation and misery for hundreds of millions worldwide. 
But realistically my answer would be to grow the British Heart Foundation’s 
income, so that we are able to fund even more world-class medical research in 
the UK, to save and transform even more lives in the future.”SG
