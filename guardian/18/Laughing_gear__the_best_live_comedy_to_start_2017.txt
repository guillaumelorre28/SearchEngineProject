Mr Swallow – Houdini

Lots of comedy is escapist, but only Nick Mohammed’s new show is escapologist. 
After 2014’s uproarious Dracula spoof,Houdini 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/16/mr-swallow-houdini-edinburgh-festival-review-nick-mohammed>
 is the second comic musical that Mohammed has created for his camp chatterbox 
alter ego Mr Swallow. This one is every bit as daft and delightful, but comes 
with an added feast of breathtaking escapology. It’s multiple entertainments 
for the price of one and well worth seeing.

Bridget Christie

Of the several comedy shows since June 2016 to broach Brexit, the first out of 
the blocks remains the funniest. To what extent was the success of Christie’s 
hastily assembled Edinburgh festival show – a clownish howl of impotent fury at 
the successfulLeave <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> 
campaign – down to its being so hot off the press? We’ll find out this spring, 
as Christie takes Because You Demanded It around her soon to be ex-European 
country.

Kieran Hodgson

Kieran Hodgson’s autobiographical solo work about his teenage obsession with 
Lance Armstrong was the most accomplished comedy show of 2015. Its follow-up,
Maestro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/13/kieran-hodgson-review-mahler-voodoo-rooms-edinburgh-festival-maestro>
, about his ambition to write a Mahler-inspired symphony, attains heights 
almost as dizzy. Like its two predecessors in Hodgson’s trilogy of 
coming-of-age narratives, it showcases considerable character-comedy flair, 
great joke-writing – and in this instance, a heartwarming love story.

Leicester comedy festival

The UK’s second biggest comedy festival returns with a cool 770 events over 19 
days. Everyone who’s anyone in comedy is there, including big-hitters like Sue 
Perkins (as part of a post-Bake Off solo tour) and up-and-comers Dane Baptiste, 
Ahir Shah, Fin Taylor and more. Festival favourites such as the UK pun 
championships and droll ghost tour Dead Leicester round off a programme that – 
according to its 2017 mission statement – promises to “get the UK laughing 
again”. Good luck with that!

The tears of clowns never flowed more freely than at the 2016 Edinburgh 
fringe, which showcased a striking number of standup shows addressing trauma 
and mental illness, sickness and bereavement. One of the most distinguished – 
and funniest – was by New Jersey comicChris Gethard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/10/chris-gethard-at-edinburgh-festival-review-frank-and-funny-tales-of-depression>
. His depression confessional Career Suicide strikes an adroit balance between 
storytelling, candid intimacies and big laughs, often at the expense of his 
no-boundaries shrink Barb. It’s a gripping hour.
