Cover bands have all the fun. With less hassle and better pay than most 
third-tier gigging bands, from time to time, they can even achieve glory 
commensurate with their objects of imitation.

So it has proved for The B Street Band 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/13/bruce-springsteen-tribute-band-trump-inauguration-gala-b-street>
, who will be taking on theirthird consecutive inaugural ball 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/13/bruce-springsteen-tribute-band-trump-inauguration-gala-b-street>
 for Donald Trump, having played for Barack Obama in 2009 and 2013. Given the 
inverse McCarthyism of the media elite to those playing Trump’s inauguration, 
the Bruce Springsteen tribute act has had to dodge considerable flak this week, 
especially sinceGarry Tallent – member of the original Springsteen backing 
band, E Street Band – tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/gwtallent/status/819607893087547392>: “Please tell me this 
is more fake news. Or at least a joke.”

, clearly already getting into character.

The chance to grab some limelight on the biggest stages is one only a few 
select cover bands have had in their time. Here are some others.

Bootleg Beatles 


Clocking up over 4,000 gigs in their 37-year span, the Bootleg Beatles are 
almost older than John Lennon ever was. Unlikethe original Beatles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles>, who merely sang about it 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLH1x_SGAL4>, they actually performed a 
60-date tour in the USSR, but their high watermark came whenOasis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/oasis> began to take unabashed Fabs worship 
into the mainstream. In the same era that agiant image of Lennon would be 
lowered 
<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9UXAqVYKy7E/Vhfp7DqjG9I/AAAAAAAACyU/fpNBSlmcBMw/s1600/John%2BLennon.jpg>
 at the end of every show so that the Gallaghers could bow down in front of it, 
they began recruiting the Bootlegs as their support act. At Knebworth, this 
culminated in them playing to a crowd of 250,000 over the two nights. In 1999, 
the fake four played the roof of 3 Savile Row, in imitation of the famous Let 
It Be gig. Sadly, their 2009 plan for a 40th anniversary repeat was nixed on 
health and safety grounds.

The Australian Pink Floyd Show 


Founded in 1988, The Australian Pink Floyd Show <http://www.aussiefloyd.com/> 
has cannily avoided any dependence on facial similarity toDavid Gilmour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/06/david-gilmour-ive-been-bonded-to-charlie-since-he-was-three-we-were-incensed-by-the-injustice>
 by distracting punters with a dazzling lasered-up AV show in the lysergic 
spirit of the original Cambridge art school crew. As well as a copy of thepink 
pig last seen flying over Battersea Power Station 
<http://www.batterseapowerstation.org.uk/floyd/floyd.html>, the Aussies have 
their own inflatable: Skippy, a flying kangaroo. In 2008, theymounted a 
full-blown version of The Wall <https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TeKzMG73dWQ>, 
and, while as far back as 1996 they found themselves playing Gilmour’s 50th 
birthday, their high watermark was surely 2006’s Royal Albert Hall sellout.

Lez Zeppelin 


In a saturated novelty landscape, Led Zeppelin tributes have ranged through 
all the angles, fromDread Zeppelin <http://www.dreadzeppelin.com/> – “the songs 
of Led Zeppelin in a reggae style as sung by a 300-pound [140 kg] Las Vegas 
Elvis impersonator” – up to and including theLez Zeppelin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/07/iron-maidens-joanne-joanne-ramonas-rise-female-tribute-bands>
 – an all-female version of Plant, Bonham and Page. Having managed to tame 
big-stage crowds at notoriously picky moshers’ favourite Download festival, 
they have bloomed into a tribute act so confident that they record their own 
albums.

Oasish 


“Let’s fookin’ ‘ave it Glastonbudget <http://www.glastonbudget.org/>”, were 
“Liam’s” opening words as Oasish fulfilled their dream of headlining 2014’s 
Glastonbudget – a Leicestershire-based festival that pulls in crowds upwards of 
12,000. Short of an as-yet-uninvented Knebworthless, it’s the biggest stage for 
UK tribute acts. Perhaps he was on such swaggering form because that weekend 
also saw a tense recreation of the famous 1995 chart battle withBlurb 
<https://www.warble-entertainment.com/blur-tribute-band-blurb> playing the same 
event, alongside the likes of T Rextasy, Metallica Reloaded, the Killers’ Aldi 
version the Fillers, Green Date and the confusingly named the Real Nirvana.

The Clone Roses 


While mastering John Squire’s endless widdly-widdly is hugely taxing on 
guitarists, as live singing gigs go, being better than Ian Brown doesn’t take 
much more than turning up. TheClone Roses <http://www.thecloneroses.co.uk/> 
have long been best at both the widdly-widdly and the turning up, so – for the 
25th anniversary of their namesakes’ famously inaudible epoch-making mega-gig – 
they decided torecreate the Spike Island concert song for song 
<http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/in-your-area/widnes-remembers-stone-roses-gig-9341572>
 in the less remote, wind-blown and possibly-toxic surrounds of a boozer in 
Widnes.

 * This article was amended on Monday 16 January to correct an editing error. 
The band who recreated the 1995 chart battle with Oasish was Blurb, not Blurd – 
a different Blur tribute act.
