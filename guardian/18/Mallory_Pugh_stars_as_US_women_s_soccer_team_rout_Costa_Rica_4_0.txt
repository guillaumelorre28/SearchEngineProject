Crystal Dunn scored in the 15th minute and Carli Lloyd notched her 88th career 
goal to help the United States women’s team beat Costa Rica 4-0 on Friday night 
in its final game before the Rio Olympics next month.

Mallory Pugh and Christen Press also scored. The US will face New Zealand on 3 
August in Belo Horizonte.

Dunn scored her second goal in two games, putting away a cross from Meghan 
Klingenberg. Moments later, Pugh slipped a left-footer between goalkeeper 
Dinnia Diaz and the near post in the 22nd minute. It was the 18-year-old Pugh’s 
third career goal.

Lloyd scored with a header in the 51st, and Press, who came on for Alex Morgan 
in the 63rd minute, capped the scoring in the 79th.

It was the 50th win for US coach Jill Ellis.

“I saw space, so I just took it,” Pugh said of her goal. “I just saw the angle 
to go in and then just that near-post finish. Ever since I started playing, I 
just like running with the ball if I have space, but I know I’ve definitely 
tried to work on that near-post finish since I’ve been playing more wide.”

“She’s a funny player,” midfielder Carli Lloyd said of Pugh. “She’s just kind 
of like, ‘Yeah, whatever.’ I asked her about her goal — I said, ‘So did you 
know you could shoot near post?’ And she was like, ‘Oh, I just shot it.’ That’s 
just kind of her demeanor. Nothing rattles her.”

“Overall I was really pleased with the simplicity with which we played, but 
also the effectiveness with which we played,” Ellis said. “I thought we moved 
the ball really well.”
