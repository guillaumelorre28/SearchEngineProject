.

Parveen Bibi confessed before a special court in the city of Lahore to killing 
her daughter in June for what she said was “bringing shame to the family”.

Police said 18-year-old Zeenat Rafiq married Hassan Khan and eloped to live 
with his family a week before she was killed.

The court sentenced Rafiq’s brother Anees to life in prison after the evidence 
showed her mother and brother had first beaten her, before her mother threw 
kerosene on her and set her on fire.

After Rafiq’s murder in a poor district of Lahore, none of her relatives 
sought to claim her body, police said, leaving her husband’s family to bury her 
charred remains after dark in a graveyard near the city.

Violence against women is rampant in Pakistan, according to the independent 
Human Rights Commission ofPakistan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan>
. Citing media reports, it said there were more than 1,100 so-called “honour 
killings” in 2015.

Pakistan’s parliament passed legislation against “honour killings” in October, 
three months after themurder of outspoken social media star Qandeel Baloch

. Her brother was arrested in relation to her strangling death in July.

Perceived damage to a family’s “honour” can involve eloping, fraternizing with 
men or other breaches of conservative values. In most cases, the victim is a 
woman and the killer is a relative who escapes punishment by seeking 
forgiveness for the crime from family members.

Under the new law, relatives can forgive convicts in the case of a death 
sentence, but they would still have to face a mandatory life sentence.
