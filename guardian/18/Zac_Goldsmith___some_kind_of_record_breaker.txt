The exploitation of agency workers (Agency workers ‘exploited and forgotten’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/britains-agency-workers-underpaid-and-exploited-thinktank-says>
, 5 December) has even spread to the Ministry of Justice which employs court 
interpreters through an agency. The MoJ can book me for a full day’s work but 
should the case be adjourned or cancelled when I show up, I will only be paid 
little more than an hour’s pay, putting the cost of cancellation or curtailment 
on me, the interpreter. What hope is there for agency workers’ conditions if 
even the MoJ colludes in this bad practice?
