The Royal Navy <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/royal-navy> has fired flares at 
a Spanish research vessel after it strayed into British Gibraltar territorial 
waters.

HMS Sabre gave the warning to Angeles Alvarino after attempts to contact it by 
radio failed.

The research vessel, which is investigating the geological risks to the 
seabed, left British waters after the flares were fired.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “The Royal Navy challenges all unlawful 
maritime incursions into BritishGibraltar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gibraltar> territorial waters (BGTW). We 
back this up by making formal diplomatic protests to the Spanish government.”

Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, said he had been in contact with 
the commander of British Forces, Cdre Mike Walliker.

He said: “I have discussed all the tactical decisions taken and am satisfied 
that they have been designed to demonstrate untrammelled sovereignty, 
jurisdiction and control over BGTW.

“I congratulate the Royal Navy for the work they have undertaken so far in 
very challenging circumstances in light of the reckless disregard for safety 
displayed by the official Spanish vessels involved.

“Diplomatic and political action must now support the excellent work 
undertaken by the navy personnel with limited resources.”
