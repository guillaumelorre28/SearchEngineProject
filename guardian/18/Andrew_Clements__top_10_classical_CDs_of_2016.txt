1 Liszt: Transcendental Studies; Paganini Studies, etc / Daniil Trifonov 

(Deutsche Grammophon)

Trifonov’s Rachmaninov recording was a highlight of 2015, and his 
extraordinary account of the Transcendental Studies, one of the greatest 
challenges in the piano repertoire, surpasses even that. Despite the sustained 
brilliance of the playing nothing is done for effect; the dazzling technique is 
entirely used to musical ends. These are the performances of a great musician, 
not of a showman.Read our review

2 Mendelssohn: String Quartets Op 44 No 3 and Op 80 / Escher Quartet

(BIS)

Since the first disc in the Escher Quartet’s Mendelssohn series appeared 
almost two years ago, the personnel of the group has changed. But what has 
remained has been the quality of their performances; not just the unanimity of 
their playing, and the care they take over its details, but the sheer energy 
they bring to every bar of this music. Their performance of the F minor Op 80 
quartet is stark and genuinely tragic, it’s a quite exceptional account.Read

3 Henze: Being Beauteous; Kammermusik 1958 / Prohaska/Gijsbertsen/Ruck/NDR 
SO/Ruzicka

(Wergo)

Two of Hans Werner Henze’s most ravishingly lyrical works from the early 
1960s, in radiant performances under Peter Ruzicka. Anna Prohaska’s silverly, 
effortlessly soaring soprano is perfectly suited to the ecstatic vocal lines of 
the Rimbaud settings of Being Beauteous; while Kammermusik 1958, composed for 
Peter Pears and Julian Bream, has Peter Gijsbertsen and Jürgen Ruck as the 
superb tenor and guitar soloists in what is one of Henze’s most introspective 
and personal works.Read our review

4 Debussy: Images; Jeux, etc / San Francisco SO/Tilson Thomas

(San Francisco Symphony)

Michael Tilson Thomas has been music director of the San Francisco Symphony 
for more than 20 years. The depth of the rapport that’s developed between 
conductor and orchestra is shown in this ravishing and superbly recorded 
Debussy collection, one of the best things they have done together on disc, in 
which every fleck of colour in the music is vividly realised in performances 
that course with rhythmic life.Read our review

5 Abrahamsen: Let Me Tell You / Hannigan/Bavarian Radio SO/Nelsons

(Winter & Winter)

Hans Abrahamsen’s Ophelia-haunted song cycle, using words taken from Paul 
Griffiths’ novel, seems as enduringly beautiful now as it did when soprano 
Barbara Hannigan introduced the work to the UK, with Andris Nelsons conducting 
the CBSO, in 2014. They had performed it first in Munich six months earlier, 
and the recording comes from that premiere, perfectly encapsulating 
Abrahamsen’s fragile, enchanted soundworld.Read our review

6 Beethoven/Liszt: Symphony No 9 / Yuri Martynov

(Alpha)

Martynov has been making his way steadily through Liszt’s piano transcriptions 
of the Beethoven symphonies, recording them on a superb-sounding 1867 Blüthner 
piano. But musically and technically, the Ninth Symphony presents him with the 
stiffest challenge of all; one that he meets magnificently, uncovering a wealth 
of detail that is regularly hidden in orchestral performances and making the 
finale a genuine climax on its own pianistic terms.Read our review

7 Copland: Symphonies / Scott/BBC Philharmonic/Wilson

(Chandos)

A handful of orchestral pieces apart, Aaron Copland’s music seems 
unfashionable at the moment, especially his larger-scale works. But John 
Wilson’s collection of early scores, which for want of a better description 
Copland called symphonies, is a revelation; it’s all serious music with 
something genuinely original to say, and superbly played by the BBC 
Philharmonic.Read our review

 Depth and breadth ... Jaap van Zweden and the Hong Kong Philharmonic and 
soloists perform Die Walküre 
8 Wagner: Die Walküre / Melton/Lang/DeYoung/Skelton/Goerne/Struckmann/Hong 
Kong PO/Van Zweden

(Naxos, three CDs)

In what has generally been a disappointing year for new opera recordings, the 
latest instalment of Naxos’s Ring cycle, recorded in concert in Hong Kong, 
easily maintains the standard set in Rheingold last year. Conductor Jaap van 
Zweden has the breadth and depth of a true Wagnerian, and the cast is a fine 
one, with Stuart Skelton’s superb Siegmund, a thoughtfully nuanced Wotan from 
Matthias Goerne, and Petra Lang’s increasingly involving Brünnhilde.Read our

9 Tchaikovsky, Sibelius: Violin Concertos / Batiashvili/Berlin 
Staatskapelle/Barenboim

(Deutsche Grammophon)

Tchaikovsky and Sibelius are not composers usually associated with Daniel 
Barenboim and his fabulously characterful orchestra. But they provide the 
perfect foil to Lisa Batiashvili’s thrilling, soaring accounts of two of the 
most familiar concertos in the violinist’s repertory, following every twist and 
turn of her solo line and adding real symphonic weight to the tuttis.Read our

10 Stravinsky: Threni; Requiem Canticles / Collegium Vocale Gent/Royal Flemish 
PO/Herreweghe

(Phi)

Stravinsky’s austere late works appear as infrequently on disc as they do in 
the concert hall. Threni, his first ever completely serial score, has only ever 
been recorded twice before, and versions of the Requiem Canticles, his final 
major work, are almost as scarce. But Philippe Herreweghe’s performances have 
more than sheer rarity to recommend them; they have a chilly refined beauty, 
which may not make the music more accessible, but captures its essence 
perfectly.Read our review
