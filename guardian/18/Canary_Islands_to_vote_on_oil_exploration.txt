Authorities in the Canary Islands will allow its residents to vote on plans to 
drill for oil and gas off the coast of the popular tourist destination.

Spain’s government outraged the islands’ officials, residents and 
environmental groups in August by giving oil group Repsol permission to explore 
near the archipelago.

The Conservative regional president, Paulino Rivero, said he would ask 
residents to vote on the proposals, which he fiercely opposes, on 23 November. 
“Do you think the Canaries should change its environmental and tourism model 
for the sake of oil and gas exploration? That is the question that will be put 
to the vote,” he said.

Residents of the seven-island group, off the north-west coast of Africa, fear 
drilling willharm the environment and disrupt the tourism industry

 on which their economy relies. The company has been authorised to spend three 
years scouring below the seabed 30 miles from Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.

Under the terms of the deal, Repsol must provide a €20m (£15.7m) deposit to 
cover its environmental responsibilities. It must also halt its explorations if 
an earthquake stronger than magnitude 4.5 strikes the region.

Those safeguards have failed to satisfy the deal’s opponents, however. A civil 
rights group has called for protests across the seven Canary islands on 18 
October under the slogan “We live here, we decide here”.
