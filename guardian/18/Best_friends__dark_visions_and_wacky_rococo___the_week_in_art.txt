The Lower Falls of the Labrofoss, 1827, by Johan Christian Dahl
The dark trees, purple rocks and eerie distant luminosity of a landscape near 
Oslo give a melancholy dreaminess to this archetypal Romantic painting. Dahl 
was Norway’s answer to Turner and famous enough in the early 19th century for 
this to have been commissioned by a British fan. Created decades before Edvard 
Munch came along, it establishes the spooky magic of the north as a new 
territory for art.
