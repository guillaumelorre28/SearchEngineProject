A Bahraini criminal court has sentenced a sports journalist to three months in 
prison 
<https://rsf.org/en/news/bahraini-journalist-faisal-hayyat-detained-over-tweet-about-religion>
for a tweet that allegedly defamed the Sunni sect of Islam.

Faisal Hayyat was arrested on 9 October, but it was unclear about the specific 
nature of his offence. A few days earlier, he postedan open letter on Facebook 
<https://www.facebook.com/faisal.hayyat.16/posts/10154731342476162> to 
Bahrain’s interior minister in which he referred to the conditions in which he 
was detained, and tortured, in 2011.

He referred to government corruption and urged for an end to restrictions on 
civil and political freedoms.

Hayyat’s conviction has been condemned by the press freedom group Reporters 
Without Borders and theBahrain <https://www.theguardian.com/world/bahrain> 
Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) as a violation of Hayyat’s right to 
free speech.


On Monday, 46 rights groups, including Article 19 and Index on Censorship, 
wrote to King Hamad of Bahrain calling for Hayyat’s release.

The letter described Hayyat’s prosecution as part of “the ongoing 
criminalisation of free expression in Bahrain.”


Hayyat is a former sports journalist and social media activist who presents a 
YouTube series on local politics. During the 2011 Arab spring protests, he was 
arrested and held for 84 days.

During his detention, he was subjected to physical and psychological torture, 
including sexual harassment and degrading treatment.

Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD’s director, said: “Bahrain’s repressive nature was 
on full display in Faisal Hayyat’s case. Bahrain has zero tolerance for free 
speech or critical reporters to conduct their work and is an enemy of the 
internet.

“Its allies in London and Washington should not give it a free pass. A father 
of five children is unjustly serving prison time while perpetrators of abuse 
and torturers are rewarded.”
