Child criminals should be given lifelong anonymity to reduce reoffending 
rates, a government-commissioned review has recommended.

Ministers are considering introducing legislation to indefinitely ban the 
identification of offenders who commit crimes while under 18, the Times 
reported.

If the law had been in place when Robert Thompson and Jon Venables murdered 
two-year-old James Bulger, the public would never have known their identities.

Currently, under-18s are automatically granted anonymity when they appear in a 
youth court and are routinely granted the same if they appear at crown court. 
However, this expires when they become adults.

The review of the youth justice system by Charlie Taylor, published this 
month, said: “Once the child turns 18 years of age their name may once again be 
reported, which risks undermining their rehabilitation as their identity could 
be established on the internet even though a conviction may have become spent 
for criminal records purposes.”

The Just for Kids Law charity welcomed the recommendation, saying: “Being 
named and shamed for what they have done or accused of doing prevents them ever 
being able to move on.”

But the Conservative MP for Kettering, Philip Hollobone, said the public had a 
right to know who had been convicted of serious offences.

Child suspects are not legally entitled to anonymity but it is incredibly rare 
for media outlets to name them. Taylor said this situation could “undermine” a 
future order banning identification and should also be changed.

The Ministry of Justice said it would “engage with interested parties, 
including the Home Office, media and youth justice interest groups” on the 
recommendations, the Times reported.
