It’s day zero of the Rio Olympic Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/olympics-2016-daily-briefing-rio-analogue-opening-ceremony>
 and as everyone knows, nothing screams “Win the discus!” more than watching a 
pop star get smothered in a parachute while dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow.

Katy Perry’s

 video for Rise, her Olympics song released before the opening ceremony on 
Friday evening, is a gymnastic extravaganza in which she attempts to launch 
herself from Utah’s Snow Canyon and Sand Hollow state park into the sky like a 
scabby-faced Cirque du Soleil performer. Along the way she is tangled in 
parachute cables, nearly drowns and scales a mountain. In fact, there’s so much 
billowing pink fabric and emphasis on triumph in the face of adversity that the 
three minutes of footage could double up as an advert for Always maxi pads with 
supermassive wings.

Perhaps the pressure of global competition, mixed with the responsibility of 
representing four years of athletes’ gruelling training schedules, is the 
reason why so many Olympic songs are totally bereft of fun. If itsropey lineage 
is anything 
<http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/music/top-10-olympic-songs#gallery-5>to 
go by, an otherwise entertaining pop star is left with nothing but a list of 
empty verbs such as “rise”, “survive”, “thrive”, “dream” and – in the case of 
Bryan Adams and Nelly Furtado’s 2010 Vancouver Winter Games soundtrack – 
“banging the drum”.

On Rise, glossy, cavernous production is paired with some relatively 
straightforward concepts, such as not conforming, rising, surviving, thriving, 
not negotiating, and, er, ignoring the vultures whispering “you’re out of 
time”. I’m no Chris Packham but I’m pretty sure beaks reduce a vulture’s 
ability to whisper . I digress. Anything is possibly if you try! Enjoy!
