The Serious Fraud Office <https://www.theguardian.com/law/serious-fraud-office>
 has stepped up its inquiries into the collapse of BHS and the conduct of the 
department store chain’s former owner Dominic Chappell.

The Guardian understands that the SFO has contacted individuals involved in 
runningBHS <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs> before it fell into 
administration in April, and the administrators themselves, and asked for a 
series of documents. The SFO is thought to be particularly interested in the 
dealings of Chappell and his consortium, Retail Acquisitions, during the 13 
months it owned the retailer.

The move raises the possibility of the agency launching a formal investigation 
into the collapse of BHS and Chappell. The SFO always explores whether there is 
reasonable grounds to suspect that fraud has taken place before publicly 
announcing it is launching a full investigation.

The demise of BHS led to 11,000 job losses and left a £571m pension deficit. 
Its failure is already under investigation by the Insolvency Service and the 
Pensions Regulator, but the SFO’s interest raises the stake considerably 
because it has the power to bring criminal charges.

Chappell controversially bought BHS for £1 from Sir Philip Green in March 
2013. The company collapsed just 13 months later, but Retail Acquisitions
received at least £17m from the retailer

.

A parliamentary investigation into events at BHS accused Chappell of having 
“had his fingers in the till” and helping to oversee the “systematic plunder” 
of the business. The MPs labelled Chappell and the other directors of Retail 
Acquisitionsas “incompetent and self-serving”

.

Chappell owes more than £500,000 to the taxman on the profits he made from 
owning BHS. Chappell has put the business that owes the tax, Swiss Rock 
Limited, into liquidation, meaning he could walk away without paying the bill.

Swiss Rock is Chappell’s personal business and was paid at least £1.6m by BHS. 
It owes £365,000 in VAT and £196,306 in corporation tax, according to documents 
drawn up by Chappell and David Rubin & Partners,the liquidator.

 The SFO confirmed that it was reviewing documents relating to BHS but was yet 
to open a formal investigation.

A SFO spokesperson said: “The SFO confirms it is reviewing material in its 
possession. If the director considers there are reasonable grounds to suspect 
serious or complex fraud which meets his criteria, he will open a criminal 
investigation.”

Chappell declined to comment. He has previously said he “earned” the money 
paid out from BHS, that his “conscience is very clear” and his team “did the 
right thing, right the way through”.

Green remains in talks with the pensions regulator about a deal to bail out 
the BHS pension scheme. The billionaire tycoon, his family and other BHS 
investors collected more than £580m from the company during the 15 years he ran 
it.


Green told MPs in June that he would “sort” the pension deficit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/mps-sir-philip-greens-reputation-and-knighthood-depend-on-pension-offer>
. However, he is yet to secure an agreement, despite pressure from MPs such as 
Frank Field, who has said Green should be stripped of his knighthood if he does 
not pump money into the pension scheme.

Field chaired the parliamentary investigation into BHS alongside Iain Wright. 
The report concluded that the collapse of the company represented the 
“unacceptable face of capitalism”.

The last of BHS’s 164 shops closed in August. However, the Middle Eastern 
group that bought the BHS brand and international business out of 
administration will relaunch it on Friday as a website. BHS.com will sell a 
range of lighting and furniture, with plans to eventually sell kitchen and 
dining products and clothing.

David Anderson, the managing director of BHS International, said the website 
would sell about 75% of the most popular online items before the original 
company fell into administration.

He said: “A huge amount of work has gone into rebuilding and launching BHS 
back into the UK as an online retailer. With a loyal British customer base of 
well over one million people and the fact that we have secured contracts with 
so many leading suppliers who are providing products that were among the most 
popular with our shoppers, we are in the best possible position for launch.”
