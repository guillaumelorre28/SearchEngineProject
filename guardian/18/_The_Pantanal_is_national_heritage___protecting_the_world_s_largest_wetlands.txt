Inside a small aircraft, decorated with a polka-dot jaguar design, Ângelo 
Rabelo checks data on a small laptop computer. “We’re approaching a river 
spring!” he shouts over the plane’s noisy engine.

Below, the Paraguay <https://www.theguardian.com/world/paraguay> river in 
Brazil’s Mato Grosso state snakes between clusters of vibrant green forest and 
extensive patches of farmland. The plane flies over a large, barren-looking 
stretch of light brown land where soy is being grown. A small buffer zone of 
trees separates the crops from the river, in which lies a pulsating spring.

Rabelo is the head of local NGO Instituto Homem Pantaneiro 
<https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiGjcCSq5bQAhXHthQKHTu1A70QFggdMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.institutohomempantaneiro.org.br%2F&usg=AFQjCNGnWatRTbzlG8QlV6AMRiwGtI1ZnQ&sig2=y9E9l4n3q9Wot3LNnFmHlQ>
, which works to conserve the Pantanal region by monitoring waterways and 
promoting sustainable practices with the local population. The Paraguay river 
“is like the main artery feeding the veins of the Pantanal’s body – if this 
artery gets blocked, the whole body breaks down”, he says.


The Pantanal is the world’s largest wetland territory. Located mostly in 
Brazil but also coveringBolivia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/bolivia> and 
Paraguay, the wetlands cover an area of 170,500 sq km – equivalent to the 
combined size of Belgium, Holland, Portugal and Switzerland. It’s home to 4,700 
species of plant and wildlife, including endangered species such as jaguars, 
giant anteaters, giant armadillos and the hyacinth macaw. Thousands of local 
people make a living from the land, through small-time farming or fishing.

But the Pantanal’s waterways – essential to all life in the region - are 
threatened by deforestation, soil erosion from expanding industrial 
agriculture, and infrastructure projects.

I am seduced by the natural beauty and the constant renewal process of the 
waters
Angelo Rabelo 
Maintaining this unique region is an uphill struggle that requires a 
multi-pronged approach, but activists and local and international NGOs are 
taking on the challenge.

Some are Pantaneiro – as the locals are known – by birth, others by vocation. 
Whether their work involves monitoring and preserving the rivers that sustain 
the wetlands, keeping tabs on endangered species, or pushing for better 
protective legislation, they are united by a passion for the Pantanal that is 
both infectious and inspiring.

“Today, I still feel like the first time I arrived in the Pantanal,” says 
Rabelo, a former forest police colonel. “Seduced by the natural beauty and the 
constant renewal process of the waters.”

 Agriculture has made a comeback in the Pantanal, with cattle and soy two of 
Brazil’s biggest exports.

Mass farming in the region began in the 1960s under Brazil’s then military 
government. Following huge floods in 1974, many farms were brought to the edge 
of bankruptcy and land value plummeted.


Since then, and as Brazil’s economy grew during the 2000s, agriculture has 
made a comeback in the region, with cattle and soy two of the country’s biggest 
exports. In the past five years especially, the Pantanal has seen an influx of 
farmers from other parts ofBrazil <https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil>. 
They are known as “asphalt farmers” as they live in the cities instead of on 
the farms, unlike the traditional farmers of the region.

This is the frontier region, so chemicals that are banned in Brazil can be 
smuggled in from Bolivia and Paraguay
Dr Catia Nunes da Cunha 
“They come to the Pantanal because of the cheap land prices,” says Dr Catia 
Nunes da Cunha, the coordinator of the Pantanal Ecological Studies Centre at the
Federal University of Mato Grosso <http://www.ufmt.br/ufmt/site/>. “In Sao 
Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, where there is good infrastructure, you can’t buy 
cheap land. They often acquire the land [in the Pantanal] for below market 
price because the local farmers are struggling to make a living.”

The change from local, mainly subsistence, farmers to macro-scale agriculture 
producers, who have no personal connection with the land and use intensive 
farming techniques and machinery, is regularly cited by academics and NGOs as 
one of the main threats facing the Pantanal.

According to WWF Brazil <http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/brazil/>, 
some 40% of the total area of the upper Paraguay river basin in Brazil has 
already been deforested, and 30% of springs that feed the Pantanal are at 
ecological risk and require urgent action.

Analysts point to rising soy production in the region as an especially 
worrying trend due to the use of agrichemicals that can run into the waters.

“We don’t know where these chemicals are coming from or what’s in them. This 
is the frontier region, so chemicals that are banned in Brazil can be smuggled 
in from Bolivia and Paraguay,” says da Cunha.

Further complicating the situation is a severe lack of resources available to 
local police. In the Pantanal city of Cáceres, Captain Thiago Martins de Souza 
of the local environmental military police says his battalion has just 25 
officers to cover 22 municipalities, and only one working 4x4 truck.

Instituto Homem Pantaneiro runs a project called Cabeceiras do Pantanal, which 
monitors nearly 1,000 water springs and areas of farmland near river banks via 
monthly plane excursions.

Results are sent to the research department of the local federal university 
for analysis and if there are any infractions, such as a farm encroaching too 
close to the banks of the river which can cause soil erosion and interfere with 
its flow, the environmental police are alerted and the property owner can face 
a hefty fine.

Infrastructure interrupting the environment

Beyond agriculture, the increasing use of hydroelectric dams to create energy 
in the region is also a major threat.

“If you put a series of dams together on one river, you are going to cause 
interruption to the environment,” says Júlio César Sampaio da Silva, the 
Cerrado Pantanal programme coordinator at WWF Brazil. In 2012, the organisation 
launched the Pantanal Pact, a project to protect the Pantanal’s waterways 
across 25 municipalities, 70 institutions, the public and private sectors, and 
civil society. The overuse of dams alters the Pantanal’s annual flood and 
drought patterns, he explains.

There are around 50 dams in the upper Paraguay basin, with another 80 planned. 
According to Pierre Girard, a professor at theCentre for Pantanal Research 
<http://cppantanal.org.br/>, 70% of the hydroelectric energy potential in the 
region has already been used, leaving just 30%, which will not bring 
significant benefits. “But it’s a profitable business, given the high cost of 
energy in Brazil,” he says.

A waterway connecting Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia and Uruguay to transport 
agricultural products to the ocean is also planned, but a construction date is 
still to be set.


“The Paraguay river is like a snake; it’s very curvy and they intend to make 
the waterway in a straight line. Can you imagine the kind of impact that this 
would have? This is a big problem,” says da Silva, referring to damage of the 
local ecosystem that would be caused if the river banks were altered 
artificially.

 One million tourists pass through the Pantanal each year
 Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
Flying from the Pantanal’s highlands – the Planalto – where the farms and dams 
are located, to the lowlands – thePlanicie – soaring over vibrant green forests 
and shiny silver lakes , it’s easy to see why one million tourists pass through 
the Pantanal each year.

Ecotourism is a growing industry, upheld as a way to preserve the region and 
supplement the locals’ incomes.

At the Pousada Amolar <http://www.pousadaamolar.com/> guesthouse, a Unesco 
heritage site in the Pantanal conservation area of Serra do Amolar, vet Diego 
Viana works with Instituto Homem Pantaneiro to collect data from 30 cameras set 
up to monitor jaguars.

The more they degrade the environment, the more likely that a jaguar will 
attack their cattle.
Diego Viana 
Part of Viana’s work involves visiting communities across the Pantanal and 
advising them not to kill jaguars, for whichPantaneiros can earn a great deal 
of money from rich cattle farmers. Viana says that anonceiro – a jaguar killer 
– can earn up to BR$1,000 (£250) from a wealthy farmer, the equivalent of a 
month’s wages. Killing jaguars in illegal in Brazil, but the perpetrator has to 
be caught red-handed.

Viana says that while farmers lose cattle to jaguars, therefore reducing 
profits, killing them is a short-sighted solution. “The jaguar is at the top of 
the food chain. Kill the jaguar and you will have more deer, more capybara – 
animals that transmit diseases to cattle,” he says.

Farmers cutting down trees to make more space is also an issue, adds Viana. 
“The more they degrade the environment, the more likely that a jaguar will 
attack their cattle.”

Pushing for a new law

Brazil’s forest code provides no specific protocol for the Pantanal. A recent, 
controversial change to the code in 2013 – brought in under pressure by the 
powerful agribusiness lobby – has reduced the buffer zone necessary between 
farmland and river springs, a potentially disastrous measure for the Pantanal. 
As such, activist groups have been pushing for a Pantanal-specific law.

“The constitution says that the Pantanal is national heritage and therefore a 
specific law should be created for it. We are trying to push for this at the 
moment,” says Girard.

The law would encompass all of the Pantanal and the Planalto highlands, and 
override the forest code. The original version of the law was submitted to the 
senate in 2011 by Blairo Maggi, the controversial former governor of Mato 
Grosso state and the current Brazilian minister of agriculture. He is popularly 
known as the Soybean King, in reference to the fact that between the 1990s and 
early 2000s, he was one of the world’s biggest producers of the commodity.

Since then, activist groups have been lobbying for the pending legislation to 
include better protection of the Pantanal and its people.

“It’s a law about restriction of use – things you can and can’t do, using the 
concept of micro habitats. For example: ‘In this place you can do this, but in 
this place you can’t do that’,” says Girard. “You have to have rule of law.”
