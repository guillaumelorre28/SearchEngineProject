Chris Robshaw <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-robshaw> faces a 
nervous wait to discover the extent of his shoulder injury, with England 
ordering further examination of a problem sustained with Harlequins.

The 30-year-old has been unable to take part in England’s two-day training 
camp owing to the shoulder problem picked up in Harlequins’ 24-17Premiership 
defeat at Worcester.

Robshaw sustained the problem midway through the first half on New Year’s Day, 
but soldiered on until he was withdrawn at half-time.

The former England captain joined Eddie Jones’s Test squad in Brighton as 
planned on Monday, but his problem now needs further assessment.

“Chris Robshaw will go for a scan tomorrow to determine the extent of a 
shoulder injury sustained while playing forHarlequins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/harlequinsru> against Worcester Warriors on 
New Year’s Day,” read a short Rugby Football Union statement.

England continue to wait to learn the extent of the knee injury that has 
denied Manu Tuilagi any involvement in the two-day training camp in Brighton. 
The Leicester centre hobbled out of the New Year’s Day 16-12 home defeat to 
Saracens, that has since led to the sacking of Richard Cockerill as director of 
rugby.

England start their Six Nations title defence by hosting France at Twickenham 
on Saturday 4 February, and will hope both Robshaw and Tuilagi can be fit to 
contest selection.
