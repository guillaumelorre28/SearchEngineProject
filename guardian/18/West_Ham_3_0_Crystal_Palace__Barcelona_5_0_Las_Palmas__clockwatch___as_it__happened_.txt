Barcelona have beaten Las Palmas 5-0, Luis Suarez scoring twice and Lionel 
Messi, Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal also getting on the scoresheet. Newcastle 
have won 2-1 at Brentford, while the latest in Europe isRennes 0-1 PSG, and 
Benfica 1-3 Boavista. That’s about all she wrote; there’ll be Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> reports and plenty of

It’s been a bad day for Brighton; Tomer Hemed has missed a penalty in stoppage 
time. Not the best for Norwich either; they’re 2-1 down at Rotherham, while 
Newcastle have nine minutes of injury time to see out.

Newcastle retake the lead at Brentford, Daryl Murphy’s goal putting them top 
of the provisional Championship table. Brighton are still two goals down at 
Preston, while Josh Morris has given Scunthorpe a vital lead at Northampton. 
That’s his 18th goal of the season.

Still goalless at Turf Moor, with Jay Rodriguez on for Southampton and Joey 
Barton on for the hosts. Van Dijk lifts a cross into the box, but Burnley clear 
after a proper penalty box melee.

The same scoreline at Watford, but Middlesbrough are shading the second half, 
and have thrown Rudy Gestede on to test Costel Pantilimon, on in place of the 
injured Heurelho Gomes.

West Ham bring on Byram for Ogbonna, moving to a back four, as both Benteke

“Simon Murray’s early opener has been cancelled out by Queen of the South. 
Currently 1-1 at Tannadice” says Simon McMahon.

“Hibs lead Dumbarton 1-0, and it looks like a long(er) journey home for the 
Annan Athletic fans as they trail Elgin 2-0.” It’s now 3-0.

Tom Lawrence’s low free kick has put Ipswich ahead against Blackburn, Plymouth 
are now ahead against Stevenage, and Oldham have a crucial goal at home to

precious little to report.

Fernando Forestieri scores on the break to confirm victory for Sheffield 
Wednesday, while Chesterfield have beaten Coventry in a League One six-pointer, 
and Swindon have snatched victory at Bolton through Yaser Kasim!
 
The referee is dishing out yellow cards after a corner flag skirmish at 
Vicarage Road. Still no goals there, and I fear there might not be one.
 
Huddersfield are a goal and a man down at Hillsborough, but are pushing for an 
equaliser. At Turf Moor, Tom Heaton claws a Shane Long shot away as the hosts 
cling on.
 
I hope Simon McMahon is still watching; Dundee United have just equalised 
through Simon Murray.
 
Newcastle retake the lead at Brentford, Daryl Murphy’s goal putting them top 
of the provisional Championship table. Brighton are still two goals down at 
Preston, while Josh Morris has given Scunthorpe a vital lead at Northampton. 
That’s his 18th goal of the season.
 
“What was that I was saying about United being unbeaten at home? Dundee United 
1 Queen of the South 3. I’m off to the pub. Happy New Year!”

Same to you, Simon McMahon - although United have pulled one back.
 
Antonio’s smart through-pass sends Lanzini clear, and he lifts the ball over 
Hennessey. Are West Ham finally settling into their new home?
 
Sheffield United are 4-1 down to Walsall. That... is unexpected. In a big 
League Two relegation battle, Cheltenham lead Accrington 3-0, and Exeter lead 
Grimsby by the same score.
 
Hat tip to Kevin Porter, who points out that Benfica, leaders of Portugal’s 
Primeira Liga, are 3-0 down at home to Boavista after half an hour. In France, 
new boy Julian Draxler has just made itRennes 0-1 PSG.
 
Joey Barton, fresh onto the pitch, fires a free kick under the wall and in! 
Turf Moor goes wild.

bicycle kick!

Turan makes it four 60 seconds later.

Still goalless at Turf Moor, with Jay Rodriguez on for Southampton and Joey 
Barton on for the hosts. Van Dijk lifts a cross into the box, but Burnley clear 
after a proper penalty box melee.

The same scoreline at Watford, but Middlesbrough are shading the second half, 
and have thrown Rudy Gestede on to test Costel Pantilimon, on in place of the 
injured Heurelho Gomes.
 
Lionel Messi doubles Barcelona’s lead after Javi Varas spilled Rafinha’s 
cross. At Swansea, Arsenalmake it four through Alexis Sanchez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/jan/14/swansea-arsenal-premier-league-live>
, and are set to climb above Liverpool on goal difference.

Tough day for League One’s leaders, with Sheffield United 3-1 down at Walsall, 
and Bolton pegged back by Swindon.
 
Arsenal’s second may go down as a Jack Cork own goal, and Kyle Naughton joins 
him on the wrong side of the scoresheet.Tim Hill has more.

Swansea City’s Kyle Naughton and past Swansea City keeper Lukasz Fabianski to 
score the Gunners’ third goal. Photograph: Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images  
Antonio goes round Hennessey but sends his shot trickling wide... only for 
Feghouli, racing in at the far post, to bundle the ball home!
 
Lasse Vibe got the goal for Brentford, while Tom Lawrence is on target again 
as Ipswich pull clear of Blackburn. 3-1 at Portman Road, and Leicester could do 
worse than haul the on-loan Lawrence back to thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>. Callum Connolly has his 
second for Wigan at Burton, while Plymouth have gone 3-2 up at home to 
Stevenage.
 
Hull are not toast. Tom Huddlestone’s well-struck shot deflects off Tyrone 
Mings and into the net, and they have a two-goal cushion.
 
Christophe Berra has put Ipswich ahead, Fulham lead Barnsley 2-0... and 
Brentford have equalised against Newcastle!
 
Brighton have slipped two goals down at Preston, Callum Robinson doubling the 
hosts’ lead. Newcastle are set to return to the top of the Championship.
Sheffield Wednesday lead Huddersfield through a Ross Wallace screamer, and 
Cameron Jerome has levelled for 10man Norwich at Rotherham.
 
This had been coming, and Swansea could end the day back at the bottom of the 
table.Tim Hill has the 411.

Local boy Jay Rodriguez is still kicking his heels on the bench, as 
Southampton fail to break Burnley down. Portsmouth lead Leyton Orient 2-1, 
while David Wheater has headed Bolton into the lead against Swindon.
 
West Ham bring on Byram for Ogbonna, moving to a back four, as both Benteke 
and Carroll let half-chances pass them by. Watford v Boro has livened up too, 
with Okaka forcing Valdes into a fine save, before Da Silva tests Gomes from 
distance.
 
Hernandez cuts inside and wallops an early shot into the top corner, and Hull 
have fought back to lead!

Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> lead Las Palmas 1-0 
at half-time, while it sounds like the big Yorkshire derby at Hillsborough 
isn’t delivering:
Laura Jones (@YICETOR) 
#swfc <https://twitter.com/hashtag/swfc?src=hash> 1st half highlights on big 
screen included the minute's applause for Graham Taylor. That's how good the 
half was.

In League Two, Plymouth have been pegged back by Stevenage. Parity is the 
order of the day; only Doncaster, Exeter and Morecambe hold a half-time lead. 
Busta will be delighted. Any more random celebrities at football matches? Send 
‘em this way.
 
None of the top four in League One are leading at half time: Sheffield United 
are level at Walsall, the same goes for Scunthorpe at Northampton, while it’s 
Bolton 0-0 Swindon at the Macron Stadium, and Bradford are behind at 
Shrewsbury, thanks to a goal fromCrystal Palace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/crystalpalace> loanee Freddie Ladapo.

It’s been a testy display from Barcelona; they’re dominant, but have picked up 
three yellow cards as they scrap for a second goal.
 
A couple of deadlocks broken very late in the first half: Chris Martin comes 
in from the cold to put Fulham ahead, and Wigan have the lead at fellow 
strugglers Burton.

Burton Albion 0-1 Wigan Athletic

Swansea’s Ki is booked for diving after a hearty penalty shout, while Hope 
Akpan has grabbed an equaliser for Blackburn as games reach half-time, plenty 
of them goalless.
 
“Simon Murray’s early opener has been cancelled out by Queen of the South. 
Currently 1-1 at Tannadice” says Simon McMahon.

“Hibs lead Dumbarton 1-0, and it looks like a long(er) journey home for the 
Annan Athletic fans as they trail Elgin 2-0.” It’s now 3-0.
 
Tom Lawrence’s low free kick has put Ipswich ahead against Blackburn, Plymouth 
are now ahead against Stevenage, and Oldham have a crucial goal at home to 
Gillingham, Josh Law putting the Latics ahead. At Burnley and Watford, there is 
precious little to report.
 
With thousands of fans already heading home, Sunderland have a glimmer of hope 
through - who else - Jermain Defoe.

mighty comeback? Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images  
Rafinha drills a shot wide as Barcelona keep Las Palmas hemmed in. “I stand by 
my toast declaration,” says JR. There are three teams with a distinctly toasty 
appearance, and the third have just gone behind,Olivier Giroud putting Arsenal 
ahead

 at Swansea.
 
Palace getting the upper hand on West Ham, James Tomkins almost putting his 
old club a goal down. James Vaughan now has four in half an hour for Bury, and 
Doncaster lead Barnet, who peaked too early, 3-1.
 
Mannone spills a Shaqiri shot against the post and out for a corner, from 
which Peter Crouch nods home. Sunderland fans are leaving, and who can blame 
them?

“Hull are toast. They’re lucky not to be down more than one to Bournemouth 
already. And then take a gander at their next four games. Away to Chelsea, Man 
U, and Arsenal and home against Liverpool. Like I said: toast.”

JR from Illinois with the gift of perfect timing.
 
Hull are level! Abel Hernandez gets a rare top-flight goal with an excellent 
header.
