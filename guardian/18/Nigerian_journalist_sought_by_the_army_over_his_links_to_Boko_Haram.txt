A Nigerian journalist, Ahmad Salkida, is being sought by the country’s army 
following this week’s release ofa video by Boko Haram  
<http://qz.com/757948/boko-haram-says-some-kidnapped-chibok-schoolgirls-have-been-killed-by-nigerian-airstrikes/>
purportedly showing some of the 219 schoolgirls kidnapped in northeast Nigeria 
in April 2014

.

Salkida, a freelance, is wanted on the grounds, which are disputed, that he is 
linked to the Islamic extremist group whichclaims allegiance to Isis 
<https://www.yahoo.com/news/accepts-allegiance-nigeria-jihadists-boko-haram-201513146.html?ref=gs>
. He fled Nigeria in 2013 to live in the United Arab Emirates.

According to a statement issued by the Nigerian military 
<http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/nigerian-journalist-wanted-boko-haram-video-160815060059971.html>
, there is “no doubt” that Salkida and two other men it is also seeking - Ahmed 
U Bolori, coordinator of the Partnership Against Violent Extremism, and Aisha 
Wakil, a lawyer - are connected to Boko Haram.

The army believes Salkida and the others “are in possession of information on 
the conditions and the exact location of schoolgirls.”

However, tweets on Salkida’s Twitter account 
<https://twitter.com/ContactSalkida>, make clear his hostility towards Boko 
Haram and his sympathy for the plight of the kidnapped girls.

And some websites, such as Quartz Africa 
<http://qz.com/758109/nigerias-army-is-going-after-the-journalist-who-first-got-the-video-of-the-kidnapped-chibok-schoolgirls/>
, appear unconvinced by the allegations against Salkida, accusing the army of 
“going after” the journalist who happens to have been the first recipient of 
the Boko Haram video.

Salkida has certainly enjoyed a rare access to Boko Haram’s leadership. In 
2009, he interviewed the group’s former leader, Mohammed Yusuf. As a result he 
wasarrested and (allegedly) tortured

.

After fleeing to the UAE, Salkida has been increasingly critical of claims by 
Nigeria’s army about its much vaunted progress in the fight againstBoko Haram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/boko-haram>, suggesting the claims were 
exaggerated.

In a posting on his own blog 
<http://salkida.com/re-nigerian-army-declares-ahmad-salkida-ambassador-ahmed-u-bolori-and-aisha-wakil-wanted/>
, Salkida has argued that his actions have “stayed within the creed of 
professional journalism”. He also pledged, “in the coming days”, to fly back 
from his self-imposed exile to Nigeria and hand himself in to the army.
