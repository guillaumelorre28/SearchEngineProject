Lemonade – Beyoncé

Beyoncé’s Lemonade was a jaw-dropping audiovisual work, in which the theme of 
infidelity knocked boots with a host of vivid tropes: of the resilience and 
resourcefulness of generations of black women, of the sins of the fathers being 
visited upon the daughters. With this sumptuously produced visual album,Beyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce> once again pulled the rug out from 
under the idea of what a pop R&B record could be – it’s hard to think of a pop 
star who has travelled further from bumping and grinding out Top 40 fodder, to 
this politicised avenging angel.

Even if it is all an elaborate hoax, dreamed up by a pair of cackling 
Illuminati <http://www.beyonce-illuminati.com/>, Lemonade is still magnificent. 
If listeners cannot cope with a little light fictionalisation in the medium of 
the pop song, in some degree of verisimilitude in their cultural products, then 
they are going to have trouble consuming art of any kind.Read more

Blonde – Frank Ocean

Four years in the making and 17 tracks long, Blonde was high-stakes stuff. You 
needed to invest energy in it. For some fans, who found their hardbodied ennui 
so prettily articulated by Ocean’s previous album Channel Orange, it might have 
been a step too far. But to regard a more difficult record as a less successful 
one would be a shame; as brilliant as Channel Orange was, Blonde is more 
adventurous, more vividly authored.Read more

Blackstar – David Bowie

Blackstar is an inky labyrinth of human cruelty and frailty shot through with 
moments of grace and transcendence, and obsessed with different kinds of 
transformation. And it’s another record on which each song carves out its own 
unique space, with no room for repetitions or redundancies. Even Bowie’s voice 
never does the same thing twice. It’s haunted, wired, seductive, menacing, 
mischievous, kind: a final, multi-faceted performance from pop’s great actor.

Kanye West – The Life of Pablo 

Kanye delivered a piece of work that was as true to him as it was to what 
appeared to be the spirit of 2016: volatile, unexpected and era-defining. The 
Life of Pablo wasn’t West’s most influential record (808s & Heartbreak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak>), 
nor his most coherent (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/25/kanye-west-beautiful-dark-twisted-review>
) or innovative (Yeezus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review>), but 
it was as close to a perfect compendium of his career there has been to date: 
an endlessly appealing hot mess, casually and frequently scattered with genius.

Solange – A Seat at the Table 

Solange’s most political release to date earned her first number 1 slot on the 
US Billboard 200 albums chart and put to bed the idea that pop-R&B can’t both 
have a message and sell. Self-assured and raw, A Seat at the Table felt more 
like a meditation; a healing balm that was undeniably her voice and her story.

Anohni – Hopelessness

The artist formerly known as Antony and the Johnsons made her name with nimble 
piano torch songs, but for her first album as Anohni, she emerged as a 
velvet-voiced harbinger of doom, her anguish at drone warfare, climate change, 
Guantánamo, the Obama administration and humanity at large set to an exuberant 
electronic soundtrack. If that suggested an uneasy listen then that was the 
point. Complex, rich and formidable, Anohni’s masterwork proved that political 
music in 2016 could be galvanising and confrontational.Read more

Rihanna – Anti

Unlike the clarity of her early material, Rihanna’s songs on Anti were often 
intimate and unusual. The production could be rough, distorted or stoned. It 
was the first album on which she successfully aligned her music with her true 
rebelliousness. Here Rihanna morphed from cowboy to gangster to the world’s 
most accomplished lover, maintaining throughout her status as pop’s greatest 
rock star.Read more

Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine


In the year of David Bowie’s death 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-at-the-age-of-69/>
, Chaleur Humaine was a salutary reminder that pop can be inspirational and 
comforting, that it need not be the preserve of the gimlet-eyed careerists or 
the glum exponents of authenticity. Like Bowie’s 1970s albums, it was the sound 
of someone using pop as a vehicle for self-realisation, and discovering that 
the commercial, experimental and personal could combine in such a way that they 
struck chords with an awful lot of other people.Read more

Skepta – Konnichiwa

Full of simmering beats and swaggering vocals, Konnichiwa reached No 2 in the 
charts and won the Mercury prize, but these achievements seem small fry 
compared to how the album managed to sell grime to a new generation of fans. 
With this long-delayed debut album, Skepta managed to do something simple but 
impressive with it: make British music cool again.Read more

Radiohead – A Moon Shaped Pool

Contained within A Moon Shaped Pool was a warning about the state of the 
world. Burn the Witch’s McCarthyist overtones came at a time when one of 
Yorke’s biggest fears – the rise of far-right ideology – is becoming a reality. 
While Hail to the Thief skewered the Bush-Blair era, it’s possible A Moon 
Shaped Pool will provide the accidental soundtrack to the time of Trump.Read

Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds – Skeleton Tree

Here is an album on which grief is served several different ways: raw, 
spatchcocked, fermented, brined, grief sous-vide. The tracks that make up 
Skeleton Tree often unfurl in an elliptical and allegorical way, rather than 
naked confessions; the album was in train before the untimely death of Cave’s 
teenage son Arthur in 2015.Read a full review

Danny Brown – Atrocity Exhibition

The snaggle-toothed Detroit rapper has previously dabbled in grime, ghettotech 
and other esoteric styles, but he goes further still on Atrocity Exhibition, 
sketching out uncharted territory for hip-hop with the gonzo musical penmanship 
of Robert Crumb or Ralph Steadman. Really Doe and Pneumonia show Brown can do 
hook-filled hits, but there’s also stuff here that no other MC is attempting.

22, A Million isn’t quite the baffling non sequitur it seems. For all the

On the LA soul trio’s full-length debut, escape is a big theme and the subject 
of love looms large. Stevie Wonder also looms large in King’s sound, but a

Jazzy, cheeky and often political, the New York band’s sixth album serves as 
the final chapter of their story and a clarion call for others to follow their

One counterpoint to Drake’s woes is how fantastic the music he sets them to 
frequently is. Views is impressively diverse, taking in everything from the

perfect, but the album suggests his stardom is unassailable for the foreseeable

Angel Olsen – My Woman

Angel Olsen’s third album is immediately and enormously enjoyable, but also 
one that might take a long time to fully absorb. Its 10 songs are by turns 
beautiful, sad, funny, silly, obvious and oblique; relatively compact and 
upbeat in the album’s first half, but gradually exploring more expansive, 
torch-song territory in its second.Read a full review

Anderson .Paak – Malibu

Paak’s sound is a warm and hazy blend of styles – funk, jazz, New York house, 
reggae, trap, blaxploitation-era soul, a hint of psych-rock – anchored in R&B 
and hip-hop. Malibu is much deeper than his light-hearted first album, Venice, 
full of long-buried and painful childhood memories, transformed into 
bittersweet melodies and woozy, punch-drunk raps.Read a full story

Blood Orange – Freetown Sound

There are plenty of absorbing, clever production touches here. Dev Hynes is 
good at twisting sounds that usually signify comforting familiarity until they 
start to feel uneasy. What seems like a chaotic demonstration of undeniable but 
insufficiently marshalled talent is anything but: on close inspection, it’s 
meticulously woven together, musical ideas and lyrical refrains reappearing in 
different songs.Read a full review

The 1975 – I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware 
of It

The real strength of the 1975’s second album is that is isn’t much different 
from their debut, their writers unencumbered by fear of melodic gaucheness. 
You’re left with an album that fancies itself as a challenging work of art, but 
turns out to be a collection of fantastic pop songs full of interesting, smart 
lyrics.Read a full review

Young Thug – Jeffery

The best moments on Jeffery come when Young Thug focuses on a hook and raps 
over an unconventional beat. Gucci Mane tribute Guwop is one of these moments, 
with a beat reminiscent of the ambient trap that Suicideyear specialises in; 
guest appearances by Young Scooter and Migos flesh it out.Read a full review

Jenny Hval – Blood Bitch

Menstruation, death and uncontained desire are among the preoccupations of 
Hval’s fourth album under her own name. Given the title and themes, Blood Bitch 
is less operatic than you might expect. There are references to waking up in 
blood, and some shrieky Giallo-esque sound effects on The Plague, but Hval 
keeps things mostly quiet, hushing the weirdness and disorientation to a 
whisper.Read a full review

Michael Kiwanuka – Love & Hate

Unlike his debut, Love & Hate never seems like an album screwing its eyes shut 
and trying to make believe that it’s 1971. The retro affectations are bound up 
with stuff that sounds very modern: ambient electronics, warped acoustic 
guitars and an almost short-circuiting distortion. It’s the work of an artist 
coming into his own.Read a full review

James Blake – The Colour in Anything

Blake’s vocal style is magically evocative and, like Arthur Russell, he can 
summon a joyful sadness that seems to transcend the song. This album of digital 
anxiety and millennial unease is wrapped in something that feels wildly 
accomplished and heart-wrenchingly frail.Read a full review

Sunflower Bean – Human Ceremony

At its core, Human Ceremony quakes with the hunger and excitement of three 
twentysomethings embarking on an adventure, in and out of bars, on and off the 
stage. Best of all is the lightness and nuance to Julia Cumming’s vocals – a 
quality that adds more texture and emotion than the dishevelled indie 
nonchalance of their predecessors.Read a full review

Ariana Grande – Dangerous Woman

While Ariana Grande’s second album, 2014’s My Everything, was a commercial 
success, it also seemed as if she’d lost her musical identity. Dangerous Woman 
is a refinement of her sound, shifting from the low-slung groove of the title 
track and Moonlight’s jazzy refrain to the throbbing electro of new single Into 
You and the pulsating, Future-assisted Everyday.Read a full review

Kano – Made in the Manor

Made in the Manor is a reflection on days gone by in east London: lyrics 
namecheck roads, postcodes and hairdressers. While the likes of Stormzy and 
Novelist have concentrated on harder, myopic tracks that reference their world 
and little else, here Kano offers more accessibility. As grime continues its 
ascent, Kano’s new approach might be catnip for those who want something more 
mature.Read a full review

Margo Price – Midwest Farmer’s Daughter

There’s an explicit debt here to predecessors such as Loretta Lynn and Dolly 
Parton, and it’s no surprise that the album has come out – a decade after Price 
starting playing around Nashville – on Jack White’s Third Man records. Midwest 
Farmer’s Daughter is a record for which “authenticity” is crucial – and it’s 
all the better for it.Read a full review

Whitney – Light Upon the Lake

Light Upon the Lake merits superlatives. It’s a confident and effortless 
record that sounds as if it has always existed. Anyone who loves the strain of 
American pop that began when the Byrds started branching out in 1966 and 1967 
should rush to hear this delightful confection.Read a full review

Lambchop – Flotus

The synths and effects never as if they’re the result of dabbling: Flotus 
still sounds like Kurt Wagner (below) and co of Lambchop, even when it sounds 
like nothing they have done before. Indeed, it plays out like a counterpoint to 
the wracked alienation of Bon Iver’s recent Auto-Tune-heavy record 22, A 
Million, and is filled with warmth, wistful nostalgia and soft, autumnal light.

Tegan and Sara – Love You to Death

For all Tegan and Sara’s adoption by queens of teen pop such as Katy Perry, 
Love You to Death feels like a distinctly grownup album, unafraid to explore 
nuanced, mature themes. There’s something unflinching about 100x’s description 
of a failed relationship, and there’s a disturbing darkness lurking around 
Dying to Know.Read a full review

Kaytranada – 99.9%

This debut by name-to-drop Montreal producer Kaytranada is a millennial 
collection that flares its nostrils at genre. The slightly disjointed 15 tracks 
provide ample evidence of 360-degree skills, of house and funk steals, often 
undercut with the clattery skip of bass music. It’s hard to keep up – but worth

Iggy Pop – Post Pop Depression

Despite the rock pedigree involved, this is not an exercise in raw power as 
per the Stooges album of 1973, but rather a vein of weathered chanson like that 
explored on 2009’s Préliminaires, where Iggy went highbrow. “When your love of 
life is an empty beach, don’t cry,” he sings on Chocolate Drops. The lyrics are 
as bare as Iggy’s legendary torso.Read a full review

Nao – For All We Know

For all the album’s sharp production, the song Trophy has an almost 
rock’n’roll swagger to it, and there’s an unmistakably 90s feel to the 
multilayered vocals. Throughout, Nao balances some very aerated sulking about 
unsatisfactory relationships with defiantly old-school touches. You can hear 
everyone from Janet Jackson to Aaliyah in this confident artist’s deceptively 
dreamy tones.Read the full review

Shura – Nothing’s Real

There’s emotional weight to the lyrics, the fizzing title track detailing a 
panic attack that landed Shura in hospital, while Indecision and Kidz ’n’ Stuff

with snippets of audio from old home videos, Nothing’s Real feels like a
