Since Prince’s death earlier this year, one of the great unanswered questions 
has been: what will happen tothe vast amount of unreleased music in his vault

. Now, we have news that it is to begin seeing the light of day.

Don’t get too excited, though, because there’s not going to be a great rush of 
songs. The big news for fans is that his 1984 album Purple Rain is to be 
reissued in a deluxe, remastered version, featuring a second disc of previously 
unreleased material. What that material might be is unknown, as is the release 
date. All that is known is that the record will emerge in early 2017, and will 
be based on plans agreed withPrince <https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince> 
before his death in April.

The Purple Rain reissue will be preceded by a new a new 40-track compilation, 
Prince 4Ever, to be released next month. While that album is almost entirely 
greatest hits, there’s one treat for fans (or a shameless attempt to get them 
to shell out for music they already have, depending on your point of view) in 
the form of Moonbeam Levels, a previously unreleased track.

Previously unreleased does not, in this case, mean previously unheard. The 
track is a much-bootlegged favourite among Prince fans, well enough known to 
have been covered in concert byElvis Costello

. You can find it on YouTube if you want to. It was recorded in July 1982, and 
included as the final track on the aborted album Rave Unto the Joy Fantastic – 
not the different Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic – before being shelved for Prince 
to work on the Batman soundtrack album.
