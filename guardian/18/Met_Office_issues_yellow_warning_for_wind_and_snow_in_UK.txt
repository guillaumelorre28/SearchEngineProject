The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for wind and snow for large areas 
of the UK, with sleet showers, gales and widespread overnight frosts expected 
to affect much of the country.

 Temperatures are expected to plummet to -10C (14F) in rural areas this week 
and last into the weekend. The weather is expected to turn cold and windy by 
Wednesday evening as a polar maritime airmass, with its origins over northern 
Canada, moves into northern Scotland and then south across the whole of the UK.

There will be gales which could lead to temporary blizzard conditions as well 
as a risk of hail and thunder in some locations. Daytime temperatures are 
likely to be between 2C and 5C, though strong gale-force winds will make it 
feel much colder.

Overnight, a frost will develop in most places with some severe frost likely 
where there is snow on the ground in the north.

The heaviest and most frequent snow showers are likely to be across northern 
and western Scotland, Northern Ireland and around Irish Sea coasts, but eastern 
coasts will also be affected at times. There will be gales which could lead to 
temporary blizzard conditions as well as a risk of hail and thunder in some 
locations.

Although the south of the UK is likely to avoid the majority of the snow 
showers, it will see a spell of rain on Thursday, with a small chance it could 
turn to sleet or snow.

Steve Ramsdale, deputy chief meteorologist said: “Southern counties of England 
and Wales will see a spell of rain during Thursday, and there’s a chance this 
could turn to sleet or snow, especially over hills later in the day.Forecasting 
snow <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/snow/snow-forecasting-in-the-uk> is 
always challenging and there’s often a fine line between whether it will rain 
or snow in a particular location, depending on slight changes in air 
temperature. Keep an eye on theforecast

latest information.”

Freezing temperatures across Europe in recent days have led to more than a 
dozen deaths

 and major disruption to power, water supplies and transport networks. 
Temperatures as low as -30C caused ice to form on the Adriatic Sea, the Danube 
and many small rivers, lakes and ponds.

In Italy, eight deaths were blamed on the extreme cold, and there were two 
weather-related deaths in Poland on Saturday. In Bulgaria, police said three 
people, including a man from Iraq and a Somali woman, had died from cold in 
mountains near Turkey as they travelled to Europe.

Meanwhile, thousands of refugees are enduring freezing temperatures

 in flimsy tents across Greece. Reports of illness among elderly and infirm 
people have been rife, with agencies attributing outbreaks of pneumonia and flu 
to lack of adequate shelter.
