 against local officials.

According to Deadline 
<http://deadline.com/2017/01/cher-flint-water-crisis-movie-lifetime-craig-zadan-neil-meron-1201878812/>
, Cher has been cast as a woman whose family has been badly affected by the 
crisis, in a storyline developed from Time magazine’s 2016 cover story, The 
Poisoning of an American City by Josh Sanburn. Driving Miss Daisy’s Bruce 
Beresford has been hired to direct, and the project is being produced for the 
Lifetime cable network.

Having won a best actress Oscar in 1988 for Moonstruck, Cher’s acting work has 
been sporadic in recent decades: her last onscreen role of any substance was as 
a clubowner in 2010’s Burlesque, following a decade-long gap after 1999’s Tea 
With Mussolini. In contrast to these comedic roles, she featured in the 
activist drama Silkwood in 1983, for which she received a best supporting 
actress nomination.

Cher donated thousands of bottles of mineral water to Flint residents via the 
Food Bank of Eastern Michigan in January 2016.The crisis is also to be the 
subject of a documentary
