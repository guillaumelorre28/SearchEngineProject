 * David Pannick, representing the lead respondent, outlined seven reasons why 
the government’s case should fail, including that the royal prerogative powers 
are insufficient to nullify the 1972 European Communities Act which has a 
constitutional status. 
 * He said there was “no relevant prerogative power” and the government 
desired trigger of article 50 would exceed its powers. He also said government 
must show that parliament “has clearly inferred a power to nullify a statutory 
scheme”, which he said it had failed to do.

 * The government rejected an amendment to give legal force to the referendum 
during a debate on the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, said Pannick. The 
amendment was proposed by the SNP’s Alex Salmond but was dismissed by the 
government because the act was said to “make no provision for what follows” the 
vote.

 * Pannick said there was an “irony” that the appellant wants to remove the 
powerful effect of EU law but said that is the very reason the government 
cannot act without the authority of parliament. 
 * He also argued that the prerogative powers to make and unmake international 
treaties are limited to the extent that they cannot affect domestic law.The 
prerogative power ends where domestic rights begin, he said. 
 * Earlier, concluding the case for the government, James Eadie QC warned that 
the claimants’ case is a “constitutional trap”. The lawyer argued that the 
court would be imposing a new rule in a “highly controversial area”, accusing 
the other side (the respondents) of “tight-rope walking” to make their case.

Pannick says it makes no sense if parliamentary authority was required under 
section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972 for an amendment to UK law if 
a new treaty is added but not for “destruction” of it, i.e. withdrawal from the 
treaty.

It would mean requiring an act of parliament for the “lesser” of the two 
actions, he argues.

One of the justices suggests parliament, through the 1972 Act could have 
intended to retain control over the terms of membership (i.e. requiring 
parliamentary authority for amendment) but to allow the executive to leave the 
“club” without authority.

Pannick replies that it’s possible but “unrealistic”.

Parliament did not intend to strain at a gnat and swallow a camel, Pannick 
says.

The 1972 act was intended to create a “constitutional revolution” and it is 
inherently implausible it would intend “that it could all be set at nought by 
the exercise of prerogative powers”, says Pannick.

Parliament has created and parliament can take away.

Pannick confirms thathe is treating parliament as the source of the law rather 
than the “conduit” as Eadie suggested yesterday.

However flexible our constitution, it cannot be that ministers can use the 
prerogative to take away powers that parliament has created.

The general message conveyed by the 1972 act is very clear as to parliament’s 
commitment to the new source of law. That the Crown has a role in the Council 
of Ministers does not advance the government’s case, says Pannick.

They’re discussing the long title of the European Communities Act, which was 
also scrutinised during Eadie’s arguments yesterday.

The long title of the act refers to the enlargement of the EU so it cannot be 
consistent that the executive can use powers to reduce the size of the EU by 
taking the UK out, asserts Pannick.

There is no provision for withdrawal because parliament intended to make the 
UK’s membership permanent until parliament should decide otherwise, he 
continues.

Fifty-five minutes into his submissions and Lord Pannick QC, who represents 
the lead claimant Gina Miller, appears to be receiving relatively few 
challenges from the semi-circle of 11 justices to his developing argument.
Royal prerogative powers are not sufficient to nullify the 1972 European 
Communities Act which has a constitutional status, Pannick asserts.

The 1972 European Communities Act is explicitly not subject to implied repeal 
and Eadie agrees with this point, says Pannick.

He cites the high court judgement saying that as parliament implied it should 
be exempt form casual repeal by parliament it cannot have intended that it 
could be repealed by ministers under prerogative powers. Pannick reads the 
quote saying: “I cannot have put it better myself.”

Pannick goes on:

The new legal order doesn’t merely confer rights on individuals in 
international law ...the new legal order, as recognised by the 1972 [European 
Communities] act, recognises a body of rights which take effect in national law 
and which national courts are obliged to protect and enforce.
Joshua Rozenberg (@JoshuaRozenberg) 
The 1972 Act creates rights and duties whose scope is decided by a court in 
Luxembourg and its decisions have priority over national courts.

Pannick says there’s an irony in this case in that the appellant wants to 
remove the powerful effect of EU law but that’s the very reason the government 
cannot act without the authority of parliament.

It’s not easy to find cases in the book because they are rare but what cases 
there are are all to the same effect (i.e. that prerogative powers cannot be 
used to take away the domestic rights of citizens), says Pannick.

Eadie refers to a number of other examples of the use of prerogative powers in 
his written case, he continues. We have addressed them in our written statement 
but none of them involved the use of the prerogative to alter domestic law, 
“far less to remove a whole body of law”, claims the counsel for Miller.

There is no relevant prerogative power in this case.

Next he says the government must show clearly that parliament conferred a 
power on it to alter rights and duties i.e. the power it is claiming in this 
case.

If there’s any doubt upon the power conferred, “it should be resolved by a 
restrictive approach”.

The prerogative power ends where domestic rights begin, continues Pannick. 

He is citing some of those “high judicial authorities” he referred to.

They include: 

 * the Parlement Belge (1879) <http:// 
http://swarb.co.uk/the-parlement-belge-adct-1879/> 
 * Laker Airways v Department of Trade (1976)

could not be used to commandeer a ship.

There is simply no prerogative power to nullify, frustrate a statutory scheme, 
says Pannick.

The appellant relies on the well-established power to enter into and resile 
from international treaties, he continues.

The respondent is not denying those powers but the government is not 
recognising the limitations of those powers to prevent them impinging on 
parliamentary sovereignty.

Miller’s counsel says the crown enjoys a broad power in the making and 
unmaking of international treaties is precisely because what happens on the 
international plain can not affect domestic law.

He says the limitation of the prerogative to change domestic law are supported 
by “high judicial authority”.

The government rejected an amendment to give legal force to the referendum, 
says Pannick.

Pannick refers to the transcript of the parliamentary debate and is asked to 
justify doing so. He says it is permissible to refer to Hansard in court.
Joshua Rozenberg (@JoshuaRozenberg) 
Lord Pannick tells the court it can look at Hansard to identify the purpose 
behind the 2015 Act. Courts are reluctant to do that normally.

They continue and Pannick says the amendment was proposed by Alex Salmond.

The act “did not address any consequence, far less did it address the process 
for leaving the EU if the people voted, as they did, to leave”.

The question for the court is does the appellant have a prerogative power to 
notify under article 50 (2). This is not to deny any effect to the referendum. 
The referendum is plainly an act of political significance.

But that - political significance - is not a matter for the courts, he 
continues.

If the proper interpretation of the 1972 act is ministers have no power to 
nullify the rights, the court would need a much clearer statement in the 2015 
act that the inhibition is removed, says Pannick.

 * David Pannick, representing the lead respondent, outlined seven reasons why 
the government’s case should fail, including that the royal prerogative powers 
are insufficient to nullify the 1972 European Communities Act which has a 
constitutional status. 
 * He said there was “no relevant prerogative power” and the government 
desired trigger of article 50 would exceed its powers. He also said government 
must show that parliament “has clearly inferred a power to nullify a statutory 
scheme”, which he said it had failed to do.

 * The government rejected an amendment to give legal force to the referendum 
during a debate on the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, said Pannick. The 
amendment was proposed by the SNP’s Alex Salmond but was dismissed by the 
government because the act was said to “make no provision for what follows” the 
vote.

 * Pannick said there was an “irony” that the appellant wants to remove the 
powerful effect of EU law but said that is the very reason the government 
cannot act without the authority of parliament. 
 * He also argued that the prerogative powers to make and unmake international 
treaties are limited to the extent that they cannot affect domestic law.The 
prerogative power ends where domestic rights begin, he said. 
 * Earlier, concluding the case for the government, James Eadie QC warned that 
the claimants’ case is a “constitutional trap”. The lawyer argued that the 
court would be imposing a new rule in a “highly controversial area”, accusing 
the other side (the respondents) of “tight-rope walking” to make their case.  
That’s it for today. The court is adjourned until 10.30am tomorrow. 

I’ll post a summary shortly. 
 
Pannick says it makes no sense if parliamentary authority was required under 
section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972 for an amendment to UK law if 
a new treaty is added but not for “destruction” of it, i.e. withdrawal from the 
treaty.

It would mean requiring an act of parliament for the “lesser” of the two 
actions, he argues.

One of the justices suggests parliament, through the 1972 Act could have 
intended to retain control over the terms of membership (i.e. requiring 
parliamentary authority for amendment) but to allow the executive to leave the 
“club” without authority.

Pannick replies that it’s possible but “unrealistic”.

The consensus seems that to be that Pannick is doing a pretty good job - his 
delivery is certainly punchy and fairly easy to follow. But a barrister from 
Doughty Street Chambers points out on oversight:

The panel consists of ten men and one woman - the deputy president Lady Hale.
 
The 1972 act was intended to create a “constitutional revolution” and it is 
inherently implausible it would intend “that it could all be set at nought by 
the exercise of prerogative powers”, says Pannick.

Parliament has created and parliament can take away.

Pannick confirms thathe is treating parliament as the source of the law rather 
than the “conduit” as Eadie suggested yesterday.

However flexible our constitution, it cannot be that ministers can use the 
prerogative to take away powers that parliament has created.

The general message conveyed by the 1972 act is very clear as to parliament’s 
commitment to the new source of law. That the Crown has a role in the Council 
of Ministers does not advance the government’s case, says Pannick.

They’re discussing the long title of the European Communities Act, which was 
also scrutinised during Eadie’s arguments yesterday.

The long title of the act refers to the enlargement of the EU so it cannot be 
consistent that the executive can use powers to reduce the size of the EU by 
taking the UK out, asserts Pannick.

There is no provision for withdrawal because parliament intended to make the 
UK’s membership permanent until parliament should decide otherwise, he 
continues.
 
Fifty-five minutes into his submissions and Lord Pannick QC, who represents 
the lead claimant Gina Miller, appears to be receiving relatively few 
challenges from the semi-circle of 11 justices to his developing argument.
Royal prerogative powers are not sufficient to nullify the 1972 European 
Communities Act which has a constitutional status, Pannick asserts.
 
The 1972 European Communities Act is explicitly not subject to implied repeal 
and Eadie agrees with this point, says Pannick.

He cites the high court judgement saying that as parliament implied it should 
be exempt form casual repeal by parliament it cannot have intended that it 
could be repealed by ministers under prerogative powers. Pannick reads the 
quote saying: “I cannot have put it better myself.”

Pannick goes on:

The new legal order doesn’t merely confer rights on individuals in 
international law ...the new legal order, as recognised by the 1972 [European 
Communities] act, recognises a body of rights which take effect in national law 
and which national courts are obliged to protect and enforce.
Joshua Rozenberg (@JoshuaRozenberg) 
The 1972 Act creates rights and duties whose scope is decided by a court in 
Luxembourg and its decisions have priority over national courts.

cannot act without the authority of parliament.

It’s not easy to find cases in the book because they are rare but what cases 
there are are all to the same effect (i.e. that prerogative powers cannot be 
used to take away the domestic rights of citizens), says Pannick.

Eadie refers to a number of other examples of the use of prerogative powers in 
his written case, he continues. We have addressed them in our written statement 
but none of them involved the use of the prerogative to alter domestic law, 
“far less to remove a whole body of law”, claims the counsel for Miller.

There is no relevant prerogative power in this case.

Next he says the government must show clearly that parliament conferred a 
power on it to alter rights and duties i.e. the power it is claiming in this 
case.

If there’s any doubt upon the power conferred, “it should be resolved by a 
restrictive approach”.
 
The prerogative power ends where domestic rights begin, continues Pannick. 

He is citing some of those “high judicial authorities” he referred to.

They include:
