jade mining area inMyanmar <https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar>.

State media published images of the 4.5m-long (15ft) drum resting in mud on 
property owned by a mining company in Hpakank, in the northern state of Kachin.

Chinese writing was found on a smaller piece of debris that fell through the 
roof of a nearby house at the same time. No one was hurt.

Residents reported hearing an explosion as the larger barrel-shaped piece 
crashed to earth then bounced 50 metres across the mine’s compound before 
coming to rest in a waterlogged area.

“Every local thought it was the explosion of heavy artillery,” Ko Maung Myo 
told the Myanmar Times.

“I think it was an engine because I found a diode and many copper wires at the 
tail of the body,” he said.

The state-run newspaper Global New Light said: “The metal objects are assumed 
to be part of a satellite or the engine parts of a plane or missile,” adding 
that authorities were still trying to confirm their origin.

On Wednesday, a Chinese rocket carrying an experimental satellite took off 
from the Jiuquan satellite launch centre, 1,000 miles (1,600km) from Hpakank. 
There has been no confirmation from Beijing that the debris in Myanmar is part 
of a Chinese satellite.

Pictures on social media showed what appeared to be pieces of technological 
equipment and wiring attached to the inside of the debris.

Clemens Rumpf, a space debris researcher at Southampton University, said it 
was “entirely plausible” that the object was part of the Long March 11 Chinese 
rocket that launched on Wednesday.

“Myanmar is directly to the south of the launch site and this would put the 
country directly under the launch trajectory for that rocket. It is entirely 
plausible that the first or second stage of the rocket could have come down 
there,” he said. “In general, the first stage of any rocket does not make it to 
orbit and thus falls down somewhere downrange from the launch site.”
