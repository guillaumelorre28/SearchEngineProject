The goal was Cavani’s 100th in a PSG shirt and came after a foul on Hatem Ben 
Arfa in the 66th minute. After scoring, he took off his shirt to reveal a white 
T-shirt bearing a hand-drawn logo of the Brazilian club above the word “Fuerza” 
(strength). He pointed both hands to the sky.

But the referee, Frank Schneider, followed the letter of the law and booked 
Cavani at the Parc des Princes. A minute’s silence had been held for the 
victims of the plane crash before kick-off and several Brazilian flags were to 
be seen in the crowd.

The Uruguayan has reached the century mark, the same number of goals scored by 
Dominique Rocheteau for the club, in 166 games but he remains well behind 
Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s record of 156 goals.

The Brazilian Thiago Silva opened the scoring for the champions in a victory 
that moved PSG above Monaco into second place. Nice went back to the top with a 
1-0 win at Guingamp.

Nice have 36 points from 15 games, with PSG on 35 and Monaco, who drew 1-1 at 
Dijon on Tuesday, on 33.
