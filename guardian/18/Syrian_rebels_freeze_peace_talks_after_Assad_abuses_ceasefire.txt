In a statement, the rebel groups also said that any territorial advances by 
the army and Iran-backed militias that are fighting alongside it would end the 
fragile ceasefire brokered byRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> 
and Turkey – which back opposing sides – that came into effect on Friday.

 “The regime and its allies have continued firing and committed many and large 
violations,” said the statement signed by a number of rebel groups.

On Saturday the UN security council gave its blessing to the ceasefire deal, 
which is slated to be followed by peace talks in the Kazakh capital, Astana. 
The statement said the main violations were in an area north-west of Damascus 
in the rebel-held Wadi Barada valley, where government forces and the 
Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah group have been trying to press their advances.

Rebels say the Syrian army is seeking to recapture the area, which contains a 
spring that provides most of Damascus’s water and which lies on a major supply 
route from Lebanon to the Syrian capital which is used by Hezbollah.

Like previous ceasefire deals in Syria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, it has been shaky from the start, 
with repeated outbreaks of violence in some areas, but it has largely held.

The rebel groups questioned Russia’s ability to force the Syrian government 
and their allies to abide by the terms of the ceasefire deal.
