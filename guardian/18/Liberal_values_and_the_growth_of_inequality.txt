Jonathan Freedland cites compassion for victims of war, the peaceful 
resolution of international disputes, Enlightenment values and a free press as 
the hallmarks of liberalism (Don’t fall for these dishonest attacks on the 
‘liberal elite’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/23/dishonest-attacks-metropolitan-liberal-elite>
, 24 December). But what of free trade and free markets? Low tax, the small 
state and deregulation? These too are hallmarks of liberalism in its “neo” form.

Liberalism stands for the freedom of the individual and the sanctity of 
individual liberties – as well as the openness and plurality that Freedland 
prefers to celebrate. The right of the individual to freedom from regulation or 
restraint is the notion that has driven globalisation, market fundamentalism 
and our present, unfettered, toxic form of capitalism. And those are the forces 
that have stripped many of the Trump voters in the rust belt and Brexit 
supporters in the north of England of their security, their dignity and their 
hope for their kids. Clinton (both), Blair, Cameron, Obama, all social 
liberals, all drank the neoliberal Kool Aid. The failure of progressives to 
sever social liberalism from its economic counterpart has led us to this crisis 
(Clegg, take note). Brexit and Trump are in many ways the fruits of liberalism.

Equality of opportunity is the liberal touchstone. Well and good. But the 
chance for the bright, energetic – or lucky – few to get ahead has done nothing 
to stop the corrosive growth of inequality. What we need now is a commitment to 
a much greater – and universal – equality of outcomes. Is that a liberal value?

• Jonathan Freedland casts much-needed light in the gloom of Brexit, Farage 
and Trump; most of all on Theresa May’s ridiculous reduction of “remainers” to 
a small metropolitan elite of “citizens of the world and of nowhere”. And yet, 
there is a danger of a different kind of reductionism. Having trudged the 
streets of one post-industrial city, Stoke, over recent years, and gathered 
stories from many people about decline, racism and radicalisation, we have, 
still, much work to do in understanding why Farage, and Brexit, have played so 
well. If this is largely to do with the economy, it is because people often 
feel dismissively stereotyped by metropolitans as passé, “northern”, “failures” 
and “basket cases”.

Note might also be made of how elements of the cultural elite are responsible 
for a huge and mainly negative representational shift of working-class life 
over many decades: from Alan Sillitoe’s cussed, rugged but respected characters 
in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning to the pornography of Benefit Cheats. 
Alongside all of this, we should also remember the political abandonment of 
whole estates by an elite called NewLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

Stockbroker Farage appals me too, but his appeal, like that of the BNP or EDL, 
is partly explained by processes of abandonment and stereotyping by elites in 
the City, in politics and in parts of the media. And I guess some of those 
might think of themselves as “liberal”.

The left needs to use sensible language again

• Jonathan Freedland is right to recognise that all sorts believe in that 
better, more egalitarian and compassionate society where rights and 
responsibilities set out in a balanced way resonate. The trouble is that many 
of our ilk (yes, Guardian readers and in particular liberal-minded lefties) 
wouldn’t last five minutes when talking to so many who voted leave. The left 
needs to use sensible language again, as Steve Richards implies (Take back 
control – the slogan the left should make its own 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/19/take-back-control-slogan-left-power-right-state-intervention>
, 20 December). We need literate, lateral thinkers who encompass the equivalent 
of the politics ofCrosland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/16/politics.comment> to 
Crossman, who ensured my party was (almost) the natural party of government 
under Harold Wilson.

Labour can do that again if it creates a proper coalition putting emphasis on 
more but not absolute economic equality, asking the better off (not just 
millionaires) to pay their dues in return for a Beveridge-style settlement that 
reduces means tests and workfare and pensioners having to sell homes to pay for 
care, raising living standards with more full-time employment rather than this 
zero-hours, triple-job, low-wage economy. Dare I suggest higher VAT on luxury 
goods to combat global warming?

• My wife is much respected in her science field and has a PhD. I have been a 
consultant headteacher and now work for a university. I am a life-long reader 
of the Guardian and we both voted to leave the EU, figuring the country would 
be better governing itself with its own politicians and own laws and a 
worldwide trading base. We strongly feel that, long-term, this a better option 
for our grandchildren. When will the Guardian start representing our views in 
the same way it does for so many minorities? After all, according to Jonathan 
Freedland, we representa minority of 9%
