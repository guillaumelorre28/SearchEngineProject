The government is to conduct an investigation into the impact on human health 
of microplastic particles found in shellfish and other marine animals.


The study by the chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, is 
to be carried out as part of a wider, year-long review of the health effects of 
pollution.

The move follows the announcement in September that the government is to ban 
the use of plastic microbeads in cosmetics and toiletries after the Commons 
environmental audit committeeraised concerns about their effect on the marine 
environment

.

In its official response to the committee’s findings, the government 
acknowledged

 there was “little evidence” available on the impact to human health of 
microplastics - defined as particles smaller than five millimetres.

It said that research had however shown high concentrations could cause 
physical harm to marine worms and microplastics could transfer along a “simple” 
food chain - such as from a mussel to a crab.

In its report, the committee said someone eating six oysters was likely to 
have consumed 50 particles of microplastics and that the human health impacts 
should be a “priority subject for research”.

Committee chairwoman, Mary Creagh, said: “It’s welcome news that the chief 
medical officer will investigate the impact of microplastics on human health.

“Our inquiry recommended more research in this area - as microplastics are 
found frequently in sea food like shellfish and oysters.”
