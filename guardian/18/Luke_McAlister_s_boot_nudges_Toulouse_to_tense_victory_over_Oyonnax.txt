Toulouse <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/toulouse> earned a hard-fought 
24-18 win over Oyonnax in their European Champions Cup clash at Stade Ernest 
Wallon.

The four-time champions fell behind to a pair of Régis Lespinas penalties as 
the underdogs started brightly, but they responded through Luke McAlister’s 
penalty and a Timoci Matanavou try, which McAlister converted.

Maxime Médard crossed to give Toulouse some breathing space, with McAlister 
adding the extra points once more, but Oyonnax would not go away and Vincent 
Martin went over for a try.

Gäel Fickou’s superb 50-metre sprint to touch down looked to have won it, but 
there was still time for Fabien Cibray to bring the visitors back into it again 
and set up a tense finale.
