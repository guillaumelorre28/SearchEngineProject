A pilot has died after a light aircraft crashed in Oxfordshire.

Emergency services raced to the scene, but the man was pronounced dead. His 
next-of-kin were in the process of being informed on Sunday.

It is believed the plane left Turweston aerodrome in Buckinghamshire and 
crashed about 30 miles away in the Aston Rowant national nature reserve just 
after 2.30pm on Sunday.

A spokesman for Thames Valley police said: “Sadly, the pilot of the aircraft, 
a man, has been pronounced dead at the scene. The emergency services remain at 
the scene and an investigation into the incident will take place.”

Air Accidents Investigation Branch personnel were on their way to the scene on 
Sunday evening to begin collating information for a report.

Heavy rain had fallen over the south of England for most of the day and low 
cloud was covering much of the region.

NPAS Benson said it sent a police helicopter to the scene, but low cloud 
prevented crews from landing.
