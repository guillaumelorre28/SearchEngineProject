Two men loyal to the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi hijacked a domestic 
flight with a replica hand grenade and pistols and forced the pilot to fly to 
Malta, reportedly claiming they wanted publicity for a new political party 
before letting passengers and crew leave the plane unharmed.

The four-hour standoff with negotiators from Malta and Libya ended on Friday 
when the two men came out of the Afriqiyah Airways plane with a crewmember who 
was their final hostage, and were led away in handcuffs.

The crew and 116 other passengers on board were allowed to leave the plane in 
batches, after which the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, tweeted:

Hijackers surrendered, searched and taken in custody.

In a later tweet, he said initial examinations had shown that the weapons used 
were replicas.

The Airbus A320, operated by the state-owned airline, was hijacked on an 
internal route between the cities of Sabha and Tripoli. During the 
negotiations, one of the hijackers told Libya’s Channel TV in a phone call that 
he headed a party supporting Gaddafi, and had organised the incident to promote 
the group.

But the men’s exact demands, relayed to a team of Libyan and Maltese officials 
after Muscat spoke with his Libyan counterpart, remained unclear even after the 
negotiations were wrapped up.


Muscat said the negotiators had refused to open discussions until all 
passengers had been released and denied a report from the Libyan foreign 
minister that the men had claimed political asylum.


“The hijackers were told that in order for any discussions to be entertained, 
they should release all passengers first,” Muscat said. “This request was 
negotiated and eventually accepted and passengers were released in groups.”

The men’s party was apparently called the New Al-Fateh, a reference to the 
1969 coup that brought Gaddafi to power

, Reuters reported. Photos from Malta appeared to show a hijacker standing 
outside the plane with a green flag like those used by Gaddafi supporters.

Libya’s autocratic former leader was toppled and killed in a 2011 uprising 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/20/muammar-gaddafi-dies-city-birth>
, during which three of his sons also died. Since then, much of the oil-rich, 
sparsely populated country has descended into chaos.

Rival governments are vying for control, with western nations backing the 
UN-brokered administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/30/chief-libyas-un-backed-government-fayez-sarraj-arrives-tripoli>
 as the best hope for uniting Libya, while a parliament that meets in the far 
east refuses to accept the government’s authority.

The power vacuum has allowed affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida to take 
root and fuelled human trafficking along the coast. In recent years Libya’s 
beaches have become a key jumping-off point for migrants and refugees 
attempting the dangerous sea journey to Europe.

The chaos in Libya may also have allowed the men to smuggle their weapons on 
board.

The men initially told the pilot to fly to Malta, 220 miles (350km) north of 
Tripoli, but then briefly headed back towards Libya, and finally turned around 
again to land in Malta, an Afriqiyah Airways official said. The pilot had tried 
to persuade the hijackers to land in Libya, Reuters quoted a security source at 
the main airport as saying.

“The pilot reported to the control tower in Tripoli that they were being 
hijacked, then they lost communication with him,” the official said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. “The pilot tried very hard to have them land at the 
correct destination.”


All flights to and from Malta’s airport were cancelled or diverted during the 
standoff, and security forces gathered near the plane, which sat on the runway 
with its engines running long after it had landed.


The Maltese president, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, appealed for calm.

Negotiations were under way by early afternoon, and the first releases were 
announced soon after Muscat spoke to his Libyan counterpart, Fayez al-Sarraj.

Malta has been a destination for hijackers before. In 1985, an EgyptAir flight 
from Athens to Cairo was forced to land on the island, where a 24-hour ordeal 
ended with thedeath of 60 hostages

. Many of them were killed when Egyptian commandos stormed the plane in what 
was considered a botched operation.

Twelve years earlier, the then prime minister, Dom Mintoff, negotiated a 
successful conclusion to another hijacking 
<http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20091126/local/when-malta-saved-247-passengers-on-hijacked-plane.283422>
. A KLM flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo was hijacked over Iraqi airspace, then 
flew to Malta after it was refused landing permission everywhere else. Mintoff 
secured the release of 247 passengers and eight crewmembers in return for fuel, 
and the plane headed to Dubai, where the remaining hostages were released.

In 1997, an Air Malta flight to Istanbul was hijacked by two men who used hoax 
bombs to force a landing in Germany. They surrendered peacefully after two 
hours of negotiations.
