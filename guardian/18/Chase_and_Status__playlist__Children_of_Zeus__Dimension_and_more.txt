Children of Zeus – Still Standing

 This is one of my favourite records this year; amazing authentic soul music. 
When I first heard it, I thought I was listening to oldMaxwell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/07/maxwell-returns-my-working-style-is-would-sade-or-marvin-do-this>
 or Musiq Soulchild from the mid 90s. Children of Zeus are Manchester duo Tyler 
Daley and Konny Kon and are most definitely ones to watch.

Dimension – Automatik

Dimenson has had a whirlwind couple of years writing some of the biggest 
drum’n’bass tunes and travelling all over the world. We’re fortunate to have 
him signed to our label MTA and our sets are always packed with Dimension 
records. Automatik has been lighting it up on the floor from London to Ibiza.

Chase and Status – Spoken Word

This is our latest single featuring George the Poet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/03/george-the-poet-rappers-power-educate>
 and samples the 90s Rozalla classic Everybody’s Free. We’re big fans of George 
and that era of music and wanted to combine his poetry with the euphoria we 
fell in love with back then. When we got together in the studio, it felt really 
effortless, and after he recorded his verses we knew we had something special 
on our hands.

Frisco – Them Man There

Frisco is, hands down, one of the best MCs out there and he’s been putting in 
the hard work for years. Taken from his System Killer LP, Them Man There, 
produced by Swindle, this track has a catchy hook and razor-sharp flows 
throughout. I expect nothing less from Big Fris.

Ini Kamozi – World a Music 

Such a timeless classic, which was heavily sampled by Damian Marley for 
Welcome to Jamock in the early noughties. We couldn’t have a Rhythm and 
Waves-themed playlist without including the reggae royalty that is Ini Kamozi. 
A day doesn’t go by where I don’t listen to this. The beat and bass and vocals 
are infectious and will always be a firm favourite.
