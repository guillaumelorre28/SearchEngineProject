After the match Page kept his squad in the dressing room for more than 45 
minutes. When he spoke to the local media, Page admitted his choice of words 
was “totally unacceptable”.

In a statement issued later on the club’s website, Page said: “Saturday was a 
very difficult afternoon for everyone. After the match I made a comment, when 
speaking to our local media, about the game being a case of ‘men against girls’.

“I immediately realised that this comment was totally unacceptable. No offence 
was meant by it and I apologise wholeheartedly if any was caused. This was an 
error of judgment I made in the heat of the moment shortly after a very 
difficult defeat, but that is no excuse, I accept that.”
