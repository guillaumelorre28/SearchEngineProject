Coal <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal> power plants use enough 
water to supply the needs of 1 billion people and that will almost double if 
all the world’s planned power plants come online.

Almost half the new power plants will be built in areas that are already in 
high water stress, a report commissioned by Greenpeace says.

“We now know that coal not only pollutes our skies and fuels climate change, 
it also deprives us of our most precious resources: water,” said Harri Lammi, a 
Greenpeace campaigner.

The research, released on World Water Day 
<http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday>, examined the water usage of each of the 
world’s 8,359 existing coal power plants, as well as of all the proposed power 
plants that could be identified. It combined the water used in producing the 
electricity, as well as that used in mining the coal.

The research found 44% of current plants, and 45% of planned coal power 
plants, were in areas that were in a state of water stress – where water use is 
already considered to be having significant ecosystem impacts.

And about a quarter of the proposed new coal plants were planned in regions 
that were already running a freshwater deficit, where water is used faster than 
it is naturally replenishing – areas that Greenpeace put on a “red list”.

That figure was largely driven by China, where most of the world’s coal is 
used and almost half of the proposed coal fleet was in red-list areas. India 
and Turkey were next, each with 13% of planned coal power stations set to be in 
red-list areas.

The research uses more precise data, and provides more in-depth findings, but 
is broadly in line with figures released by the InternationalEnergy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> Agency in 2012, suggesting the 
amount of water used in electricity generation would increase by 85% between 
2010 and 2035.

The agency noted that much of the increase in water use in future would, 
ironically, be driven by a move towards plants that produced less carbon 
dioxide.

More carbon-efficient technologies would actually make the water problem 
worse, since they generally use more water,it said 
<http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2012/WEO_2012_Water_Excerpt.pdf>
.

The new report found that although coal mining used a significant amount of 
water, the vast majority from the sector came from energy production, which 
used 84% of the water.

Greenpeace concluded that coal expansion in “red list” areas should simply not 
go ahead. It also called for existing plants in those areas to be phased out 
and replaced with renewable energy like solar panels and wind.

It called for coal-fired power plants that are more than 40 years old to be 
shut, since they were often the least efficient. The country that would save 
the most water by doing that was the US, the report found, saving 74% of the 
water used by the industry and 76bn cubic litres of water.

“Governments must recognise that replacing coal with renewable energy will not 
only help them deliver on their climate agreements, but also deliver huge water 
savings,” said Iris Cheng of Greenpeace, who is the lead author of the report.

“It’s more urgent than ever that we move towards a 100% renewable future.”
