Closing summary

Jessica Elgot

 * David Cameron and John Kerry have warned that corruption and terrorism are 
dual threats to the world’s economy and security, at a summit aimed at tackling 
graft featuring heads of state and business leaders. 
 * Six countries, Britain, Afghanistan, Kenya, France, the Netherlands and 
Nigeria, have agreed to publish registers of who really owns companies in their 
territories, a so-called register of beneficial ownership.This is a key goal of 
anti-corruption groups. Six more, including Australia, will consider doing so.

 * Eleven countries will join the now 29-strong group where lists of 
beneficial owners are drawn up and shared between governments, although not 
publicly. Those countries include Cayman Islands, Jersey, Bermuda, the Isle of 
Man and the UAE. 
 * The British prime minister used his opening speech to warn foreign 
companies that own around 100,000 properties in England and Wales that they 
will be required to disclose their ownership, one of a number of measures aimed 
at cleaning up London as an international centre for money laundering. 
 * The US is one of the countries which did not sign up to the pledge to share 
registers of beneficial ownership, and Cameron said he would keep pushing the 
Americans to be more accountable, as well as efforts to improve transparency on 
island tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, which also did not sign up 
to sharing information.  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani participates in a panel 
discussion Photograph: Paul Hackett/AFP/Getty Images 
 * This concern was echoed by Allan Bell, chief minister of the Isle of Man, 
which has signed up to the information sharing, who said there wouldn’t be real 
progress unless the United States made its own tax havens, such as Delaware, 
more open. 
 * US secretary of state John Kerry said he had been shocked at the extent of 
corruption in the world since taking on his role in the Obama administration.

We are fighting a battle, all of us. Corruption, writ large, is as much of an 
enemy, because it destroys nation states, as some of the extremists we are 
fighting or the other challenges we face.

 * Cameron called corruption “the cancer at the heart of so many of the 
problems we need to tackle in our world” and said tax-dodging holds back growth 
and undermines security by making poorer citizens more vulnerable to “poisonous 
ideology of extremists”. 
 * Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari, who has made tackling corruption a 
key part of his leadership, called for the conference to agree swifter measures 
to return stolen assets.Cameron announced he would require overseas firms to 
sign up to a new public register if they own or buy property or if they want to 
bid for central government contracts. 
 * Afghanistan’s president Ghani said corruption was fuelling his country’s 
political violence,and the fight against wrongdoing “should not be a fashion 
that is discarded with the next set of elections.”  Protesters dressed in top

 * Cameron last month announced that the overseas territories and Crown 
dependencies - such as the British Virgin Islands and Jersey - had agreed to 
provide UK tax and law enforcement agencies with full access to company 
ownership details. 
 * But campaigners say they are disappointed that the offshore territories are 
not pledging to create a public register, like the UK and others have promised 
to do. Adrian Lovett, deputy chief executive officer of anti-poverty campaign 
ONE, said:

ONE calls on countries who attended the anti-corruption summit to urgently 
implement gold standard policies that ensure fair play. To root out corruption, 
we need committed and robust action, crucially including the public disclosure 
of beneficial ownership of companies and trusts.

 * There were some notable omissions on the conference guest list, including 
any representative from Fifa during a plenary discussion on corruption in sport
, while the organisation is plagued by a deep-seated bribery scandal. 
 * Bermuda and the Cayman Islands were represented at the summit but others, 
such as the British Virgin Islands and Panama were not.

That’s all from me, thanks very much for reading.

Cameron is asked about the need to push overseas territories and crown 
dependencies to do more to be open and transparent over the registers of 
beneficial ownership.

He says the territories have come a long way in agreeing to the automatic 
sharing of information, and says that goes further than what the United States 
and some European countries have agreed.

If you think how far they have come in the last few weeks and months, I am 
convinced we will get them all over that bar [of automatic sharing of 
registers, which British Virgin Islands has not signed up to do].

The gold standard which I will push for as long as I have breath in my body, 
is public registers.

That is not just for small islands, it is the United States, China, India that 
I want to sign up as well.

Cameron admits there are challenges with the US, that the state of Delaware 
also has a lack of transparency. “We just have to work with all these countries 
to convince them to raise the bar,” he said.

Cameron hails 'coalition of the committed'

David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has hailed a 
“coalition of the committed” for what he described as the biggest demonstration 
of political will to tackle corruption.

He says there is “nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come” and that 
there are now 129 jurisdictions who have committed to implementing 
international standards to give tax information on request. He says those new 
standards have led to £50bn in extra tax revenue, “think of the roads, schools 
and services provided with that money”.

Today’s summit is not just about securing the agreements, it’s been a 
different kind of events, not having speeches and talking to ourselves, having 
open challenging conversations asking tough questions.

Cameron said there is a need for every country to reach a gold standard of a 
register of beneficial ownership made public, and he says that he includes 
crown dependencies and overseas territories in that.

This cannot be a fashion, we have to stay the course for the next 10 years and 
beyond.

We are talking about stopping the corrupt hiding their loot from authorities. 
When people steal from your country and hide it in mine, we can find it and 
return it to you.

President Santos is closing the session now. He says the “sisters and brothers 
of corruption are terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal mining”, which are all 
part of the same chain. He says heroin from Afghanistan and cocaine from 
Colombia can be connected to one drug dealer in the UK, and that’s why an 
international approach is necessary.

He says the Panama Papers show how corruption is “scared of the spotlight” and 
urges new protection for whistleblowers who he says are under great danger in 
many countries. Prosecution is also key, he says, because people have to know 
the process works.

 Spanish Justice Minister Rafael Catala says that tackling corruption must go 
beyond laws and regulation, and become part of the culture. It is not enough to 
have laws and values, we need resources to change cultures, he said.

He says organised crime intensively uses technology, anyone defending the 
rights of citizens also need access to those tools. Society as a whole needs to 
foster transparency as a value, he says, as do private companies.

Corruption is not something that belongs to any country, it is an 
international scourge and the fight has to be based on international 
co-operation.

'We inherited 'fantastically corrupt' system' says Afghan official

An Afghan official, tasked with tackling government corruption, is the first 
to make a jibe at Cameron for his gaffe when speaking to the Queen.

We inherited, and I quote, a ‘fantastically corrupt’ system.

He says that in his country for the past decade “there has been enthusiastic 
international community partnerships willing to pour in billions into a country 
without thinking about the safeguards that were needed in order to ensure that 
money would be spent transparently and effectively.”

He says the country is now saving $200m dollars a year from anti-corruption 
efforts which “otherwise would have gone into the pockets of mafia and corrupt 
companies”.

Without political will, there is no way we can fight corruption. No impunity 
for officials or companies, is a must.

He says Afghanistan is blacklisting on average one company a week, with the 
list published online and updated every week, and he invites the UK to publish 
a blacklist of corrupt companies as well.

Oxfam GB’s chief executive, Mark Goldring, adds his voice to concerns that the 
communique from the anti-corruption summit does not go far enough.


If corruption is a cancer then this summit has delivered some pain relief but 
not the major surgery needed to heal the global economy.

Until tax havens are required to publish public registers showing who really 
profits from shell companies, the corruption and tax dodging revealed by the 
Panama Papers will continue undisturbed and millions of people in both the UK 
and the world’s poorest countries will pay the price.

Laura Stefan, the Romanian anti-corruption campaigner, says a culture change 
is not easy in places where corruption is forced by economic circumstances.

“We tend to think that anti-corruption is something everybody wants. The 
establishment, in many of the countries where this is a real problem, does not 
want it,” she said. “Because they risk losing their assets.”

 * David Cameron and John Kerry have warned that corruption and terrorism are 
dual threats to the world’s economy and security, at a summit aimed at tackling 
graft featuring heads of state and business leaders. 
 * Six countries, Britain, Afghanistan, Kenya, France, the Netherlands and 
Nigeria, have agreed to publish registers of who really owns companies in their 
territories, a so-called register of beneficial ownership.This is a key goal of 
anti-corruption groups. Six more, including Australia, will consider doing so.

 * Eleven countries will join the now 29-strong group where lists of 
beneficial owners are drawn up and shared between governments, although not 
publicly. Those countries include Cayman Islands, Jersey, Bermuda, the Isle of 
Man and the UAE. 
 * The British prime minister used his opening speech to warn foreign 
companies that own around 100,000 properties in England and Wales that they 
will be required to disclose their ownership, one of a number of measures aimed 
at cleaning up London as an international centre for money laundering. 
 * The US is one of the countries which did not sign up to the pledge to share 
registers of beneficial ownership, and Cameron said he would keep pushing the 
Americans to be more accountable, as well as efforts to improve transparency on 
island tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, which also did not sign up 
to sharing information.  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani participates in a panel 
discussion Photograph: Paul Hackett/AFP/Getty Images 
 * This concern was echoed by Allan Bell, chief minister of the Isle of Man, 
which has signed up to the information sharing, who said there wouldn’t be real 
progress unless the United States made its own tax havens, such as Delaware, 
more open. 
 * US secretary of state John Kerry said he had been shocked at the extent of 
corruption in the world since taking on his role in the Obama administration.

We are fighting a battle, all of us. Corruption, writ large, is as much of an 
enemy, because it destroys nation states, as some of the extremists we are 
fighting or the other challenges we face.

 * Cameron called corruption “the cancer at the heart of so many of the 
problems we need to tackle in our world” and said tax-dodging holds back growth 
and undermines security by making poorer citizens more vulnerable to “poisonous 
ideology of extremists”. 
 * Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari, who has made tackling corruption a 
key part of his leadership, called for the conference to agree swifter measures 
to return stolen assets.Cameron announced he would require overseas firms to 
sign up to a new public register if they own or buy property or if they want to 
bid for central government contracts. 
 * Afghanistan’s president Ghani said corruption was fuelling his country’s 
political violence,and the fight against wrongdoing “should not be a fashion 
that is discarded with the next set of elections.”  Protesters dressed in top

 * Cameron last month announced that the overseas territories and Crown 
dependencies - such as the British Virgin Islands and Jersey - had agreed to 
provide UK tax and law enforcement agencies with full access to company 
ownership details. 
 * But campaigners say they are disappointed that the offshore territories are 
not pledging to create a public register, like the UK and others have promised 
to do. Adrian Lovett, deputy chief executive officer of anti-poverty campaign 
ONE, said:

ONE calls on countries who attended the anti-corruption summit to urgently 
implement gold standard policies that ensure fair play. To root out corruption, 
we need committed and robust action, crucially including the public disclosure 
of beneficial ownership of companies and trusts.

 * There were some notable omissions on the conference guest list, including 
any representative from Fifa during a plenary discussion on corruption in sport
, while the organisation is plagued by a deep-seated bribery scandal. 
 * Bermuda and the Cayman Islands were represented at the summit but others, 
such as the British Virgin Islands and Panama were not.

That’s all from me, thanks very much for reading.
 
Cameron is asked about the need to push overseas territories and crown 
dependencies to do more to be open and transparent over the registers of 
beneficial ownership.

He says the territories have come a long way in agreeing to the automatic 
sharing of information, and says that goes further than what the United States 
and some European countries have agreed.

If you think how far they have come in the last few weeks and months, I am 
convinced we will get them all over that bar [of automatic sharing of 
registers, which British Virgin Islands has not signed up to do].

The gold standard which I will push for as long as I have breath in my body, 
is public registers.

That is not just for small islands, it is the United States, China, India that 
I want to sign up as well.

Cameron admits there are challenges with the US, that the state of Delaware 
also has a lack of transparency. “We just have to work with all these countries 
to convince them to raise the bar,” he said.
 
David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has hailed a 
“coalition of the committed” for what he described as the biggest demonstration 
of political will to tackle corruption.

He says there is “nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come” and that 
there are now 129 jurisdictions who have committed to implementing 
international standards to give tax information on request. He says those new 
standards have led to £50bn in extra tax revenue, “think of the roads, schools 
and services provided with that money”.

Today’s summit is not just about securing the agreements, it’s been a 
different kind of events, not having speeches and talking to ourselves, having 
open challenging conversations asking tough questions.

Cameron said there is a need for every country to reach a gold standard of a 
register of beneficial ownership made public, and he says that he includes 
crown dependencies and overseas territories in that.

This cannot be a fashion, we have to stay the course for the next 10 years and 
beyond.

We are talking about stopping the corrupt hiding their loot from authorities. 
When people steal from your country and hide it in mine, we can find it and 
return it to you.
 
President Santos is closing the session now. He says the “sisters and brothers 
of corruption are terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal mining”, which are all 
part of the same chain. He says heroin from Afghanistan and cocaine from 
Colombia can be connected to one drug dealer in the UK, and that’s why an 
international approach is necessary.

He says the Panama Papers show how corruption is “scared of the spotlight” and 
urges new protection for whistleblowers who he says are under great danger in 
many countries. Prosecution is also key, he says, because people have to know 
the process works.
 
 Spanish Justice Minister Rafael Catala says that tackling corruption must go 
beyond laws and regulation, and become part of the culture. It is not enough to 
have laws and values, we need resources to change cultures, he said.

He says organised crime intensively uses technology, anyone defending the 
rights of citizens also need access to those tools. Society as a whole needs to 
foster transparency as a value, he says, as do private companies.

Corruption is not something that belongs to any country, it is an 
international scourge and the fight has to be based on international 
co-operation.
 
Baroness Scotland, secretary-general of the Commonwealth announces she will 
create an office of criminal and civil justice reform.

I intend to be a magpie for every single good idea to put in to a toolkit for 
implementation and change.

She also says she intends to create a Commonwealth standard of anti-corruption 
best practice, so companies can apply for a mark.

Perhaps another pointed comment at Cameron here from Maltese prime minister 
Joseph Muscat. He says we should not speak about “corrupt countries” but of 
individuals.

An Afghan official, tasked with tackling government corruption, is the first 
to make a jibe at Cameron for his gaffe when speaking to the Queen.

We inherited, and I quote, a ‘fantastically corrupt’ system.

He says that in his country for the past decade “there has been enthusiastic 
international community partnerships willing to pour in billions into a country 
without thinking about the safeguards that were needed in order to ensure that 
money would be spent transparently and effectively.”

He says the country is now saving $200m dollars a year from anti-corruption 
efforts which “otherwise would have gone into the pockets of mafia and corrupt 
companies”.

Without political will, there is no way we can fight corruption. No impunity 
for officials or companies, is a must.

He says Afghanistan is blacklisting on average one company a week, with the 
list published online and updated every week, and he invites the UK to publish 
a blacklist of corrupt companies as well.

Oxfam GB’s chief executive, Mark Goldring, adds his voice to concerns that the 
communique from the anti-corruption summit does not go far enough.


If corruption is a cancer then this summit has delivered some pain relief but 
not the major surgery needed to heal the global economy.

Until tax havens are required to publish public registers showing who really 
profits from shell companies, the corruption and tax dodging revealed by the 
Panama Papers will continue undisturbed and millions of people in both the UK 
and the world’s poorest countries will pay the price.

Laura Stefan, the Romanian anti-corruption campaigner, says a culture change 
is not easy in places where corruption is forced by economic circumstances.

“We tend to think that anti-corruption is something everybody wants. The 
establishment, in many of the countries where this is a real problem, does not 
want it,” she said. “Because they risk losing their assets.”
