Take me there: Masurian Lakes, Poland

Why go?
If you have ever fancied climbing into a canoe and paddling off into the 
wilderness, Masuria in the northeast of Poland is the place to do it. With more 
than 2,000 lakes connected by a network of rivers and canals, it's like the 
Norfolk Broads on steroids. In summer the lively lakeside resorts of Gizycko 
and Mikołajki are full of Polish families happily filling up on dumplings in 
waterfront cafés before diving off jetties for a swim. Just don't forget to 
bring the mosquito repellent.

What to do
Messing about on the water is virtually compulsory here. The signposted 
Krutynia river trail, which begins near the village of Sorkwity and ends 115km 
later in the town of Ruciane-Nida, is a beautiful and gentle route, with 
the option of camping overnight on the riverbanks: rent kayaks and canoes from 
English-speaking AS Tour (masuria-canoeing.com 
<http://www.masuria-canoeing.com/>). See wild European bison on a walk through 
the ancient Białowieza forest. The ruins of Hitler's Second World War 
headquarters, the Wolf's Lair, near Ketrzyn, make for a chillingly memorable 
day trip (wolfsschanze.pl <http://wolfsschanze.pl/index.php/en/wolf-s-lair>).

Where to stay
Nearly all of the furnishings at the Hotel Galery69 have been handmade by the 
artist owners to create a rustic and romantic lakeside retreat (from £48,

<https://www.designhotels.com/hotels/poland/stawiguda-masuria/hotel-galery-69>
). Soak up the watery views from the slick indoor pool, the waterfront 
restaurant or from a hammock on your balcony.

Where to eat
Try Polish specialities such as pierogi, lake trout and pickled cabbage at the 
Rynski Mlyn in Ryn, a restored old watermill overlooking Lake Ryn (rynskimlyn.pl
 <http://www.rynskimlyn.pl/>).

Insider tip
Marian Jurak, president of the local branch of the PTTK (Polish Tourist and 
Sightseeing Society), recommends a day trip to the town of Frombork. "Nicolaus 
Copernicus lived here," he says, "and is buried in the beautiful brick 
cathedral, which hosts wonderful organ concerts. The Bishop's Palace is home to 
a Copernicus museum with a planetarium and astronomy exhibitions."

Give me a break
