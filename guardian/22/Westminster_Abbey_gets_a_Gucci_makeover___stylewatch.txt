New style icon klaxon! And it’s not some 19-year-old streetstyle 
whippersnapper, weirdly. This year’s name to drop is 1,000 years old. And 68 
metres tall. You’re not going to guess this, unless you’ve looked at the 
picture, so I’ll just tell you. It’s Westminster Abbey.

Gucci has announced that its 2 June London fashion show will be the first 
catwalk event ever to take place in Westminster Abbey. Designer Alessandro 
Michele described the news that the abbey has agreed to Gucci showcasing its 
Cruise looks in the cloisters of the abbey as “magical”. And the abbey had 
already got the year off to a glamorous start with aspectacular neon makeover 
as part of Lumiere London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/jan/14/photo-highlights-of-the-day-rescued-ducklings-and-a-catch-of-the-day>
, so news of the Gucci show sees The Ivy pushed firmly out of the limelight as 
London’s most fabulous spot.

This may be the first cloisters catwalk, but the abbey has some serious style 
heritage. The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge five years ago was 
essentially a showcase for awesome Alexander McQueen dresses:one enormous lacy 
one

. Fifty-eight years before that, the abbey staged the Queen’s coronation, for 
which she wore anivory Norman Hartnell dress

 and a robe of crimson velvet edged with ermine and trimmed with embroidered 
gold lace.
