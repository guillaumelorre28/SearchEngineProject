Morrisons <https://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons> has sold its stake 
in the US grocery delivery service Fresh Direct for £45m, in a boost to the 
struggling supermarket’s bottom line.

It is understood that Fresh Direct, which is based in Long Island, New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/18/morrisons-fresh-direct-online-grocery>
, has bought back the stake that Morrisons acquired for about £31m in 2011.

Bruno Monteyne, a retail analyst at Bernstein Research, said the deal was a 
good move for Morrisons.

“It has to be positive,” he said. “Morrisons will be able to focus on its core 
business and is getting a very good price for this stake.”

The sale winds up the exit from some expensive investments Morrisons made in 
its early attempts to get a foot in the fast-growing online market.

The supermarket bought Fresh Direct after acquiring British online retailer 
Kiddicare for £70m

, which it tried to expand through physical stores. But in 2014 it was forced to
pull out of its expensive foray

 into children’s clothing and toys at a cost of £163m.

Morrisons has since launched an online grocery service in partnership with 
specialist provider Ocado,which it expanded last week
