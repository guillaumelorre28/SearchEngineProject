Best for breakfast

If Germany’s relationship with bread elsewhere in the country verges on the 
theological, Berlin is a den of infidelity. Good bakeries are few and far 
between, and the standard Berlin bread roll tastes of cardboard. But breakfasts 
atCafe Kalwil are a dream: fresh rolls, flaky croissants, well-cured cold cuts 
and a sea of jams. Located on Motzstrasse, between philosopher-anthropologist
Rudolf Steiner <http://www.rudolfsteinerweb.com/>’s former home and a row of 
fetish shops, it’s also a perfect spot for appreciating some of the 
ultra-specific subcultures Berlin still does so well to protect.

Drink in the city’s oldest bar

The iron rule with favourite locals is that one should never seek them out 
from a guide book but always stumble upon one by chance (a more Berlin-specific 
rule is that the best have very good light-fittings and no name on the outside).
Alt-Berlin is worth making an exception for: 123 years old and considered by 
many Berliners to be the oldest bar in the city, it used to be a smelly dive in 
Mitte until it had to make way for a fashion chain in 2014. But one of the 
regulars bought up the tobacco-infused wood panelling and moved it inside the 
empty premises next to a GDR-era ballroom a few kilometres north, where it 
reopened in May this year. After one beer too many, the Bulette (meatball), 
potato salad and pickled gherkins are a must.

Eat out late, Korean-style

Berlin’s street food enjoys a reputation outside the city’s borders, but a 
late-night currywurst or doner kebab is more often miss than hit. The one 
fast-food restaurant I will travel across the city for isIxthys, a tiny Korean 
next to Winterfeldtplatz in Schöneberg, in the old west. The walls are covered 
in handwritten bible verses, the photocopied menus are tatty, but the food is 
fresh, filling and – rare for Berlin – not just aromatic but properly spicy.

Trawl through history in a reclamation yard

 Photograph: Historische Bauelemente 
Not strictly speaking in Berlin, but in the town of Marwitz, around 45 minutes 
northwest of the capital, theHistorische Bauelemente reclamation yard 
effectively doubles up as a museum, and tells a better story of Berlin’s design 
history than many of the paid-for attractions in the city. There are depots 
with thousands of doors in all styles, 70s plastic furniture from Tegel 
airport, old funfair rides and a collection of art left behind at Soviet army 
posts.
• Open Tues-Fri and every first Saturday of the month, 10am-6pm. Bärenklauer

A day at the park
 Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images 
It’s not much of a secret, and far too vast to be hidden from anyone anyway, 
but the abandonedTempelhof airfield is the entire ethos of post-Wall Berlin 
summed up in 900 acres. Berlin’s status as a cultural capital was fashioned on 
empty lots and inside abandoned buildings across the capital, vacated as the 
city drained itself westwards in the 1990s. As Berlin began to grow again after 
the turn of the millennium, many of those ghost sites have again been built up; 
but Tempelhof – half Central Park, halfBurning Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jul/29/sp-burning-man-festival-survival-guide>
 – proudly defies the trend, with locals voting in 2014 to preserve it as a 
public park for joggers, kite-flyers, urban gardeners, dog-walkers and beer 
drinkers.

Go clubbing… on the water

“Have you been to Berghain <http://www.berghain.de/>? Did you get past the 
bouncer? Did you go into one of the dark rooms?” Even talking about clubbing in 
Berlin is exhausting. What I like aboutHoppetosse is that it’s fairly stress 
free without being uncool. The fact that it’s a nightclub in a boat docked 
permanently on the river Spree may have something to do with it: floating on 
water seems to make everyone a bit more considerate. Whenever I’ve been the 
place was full but not rammed, and while the music is unmistakably of the city 
– slow, minimalist house and techno – it doesn’t feel exclusive. You can even 
leave before dawn and not feel like a total square.

Pay your respects to the famous dead

Located in a central yet quiet part of Mitte, Dorotheenstadt cemetery is the 
German capital’s equivalent of Paris’Père Lachaise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/oct/25/fivebest-cemetery-tours>, and 
yet couldn’t be more different. Just compare the graves ofOscar Wilde 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/nov/27/oscar-wilde-grave-paris-cemetery>
 in the French capital – a sculpted, fantastical tomb covered in graffiti and 
lipstick traces – with that ofBertolt Brecht 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bertolt-brecht> in Berlin: arguably the most 
influential playwright of the 20th century lies underneath a humble boulder, 
with nothing but his name hewn into the rock in a no-nonsense sans serif. Some 
of the most important figures in the city’s history rest in peace here: 
architects likeKarl Friedrich Schinkel <http://www.karl-friedrich-schinkel.com/>
, novelists likeHeinrich Mann 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/18/thomas-mann-great-dynasties-world>
, philosophers like Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and the freedom fighters who 
died after the failed assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944.

Catch a film

Of many good art-house cinemas in the city, Kino International is by far the 
grandest. Built in 1963 as the prime venue for film galas in East Germany, it 
is located halfway down Karl-Marx Allee, a monumental socialist boulevard built 
to host expansive military parades. Inside there’s a vast bar, leather sofas 
and chandeliers made of fine Czech glass. The surroundings are so glamorous 
that every film feels like a premiere.

Go for a swim

A listed building, built in the 1930s by the Jewish-German businessman James 
Simon, Stadtbad Mitte is in many ways an ordinary swimming pool for inner-city 
locals, with no fancy modern gimmicks. But the glass roof is spectacular, and 
feels so contemporary it’s hard to believe that the building is over 80 years 
old. When it’s freezing outside but the sky is clear, there’s no better place 
to spend an afternoon doing a lazy backstroke.

Visit a Bauhaus neighbourhood
 Photograph: Alamy 
Rarely was modernism more fun than in the designs of Bauhaus architect Bruno 
Taut <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Taut>. Nicknamed the Papageiensiedlung
, or “parrot estate”, this set of colourful minimalist terraced homes around 
Onkel Toms Hütte station are less well known than Taut’s“horseshoe” estate in 
Neukölln <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hufeisensiedlung>, but just as much of 
a wonder to explore. Surrounded by woodland, the estate makes for a perfect day 
trip, and it can easily be extended to the adjacent country-cottage estate 
Waldsiedlung Krumme Lanke, initiated by Heinrich Himmler as a direct 
counter-statement to the modernist homes next door, and to provide homes for 
families of the SS.
