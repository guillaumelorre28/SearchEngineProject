The Penny Arcade Expo (Pax) is one of the biggest gaming conventions in the 
world, bringing together classic consoles, the latest shooters, mobile games, 
PCs, Macs, tabletops – and the people who love them.

For the latest event in Melbourne, Pax Australia, the biggest companies in the 
world – including Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony – came to show off their wares, 
but the most interesting stuff was relegated to one corner of the exhibition 
hall: Pax Rising, where independent developers let you play their latest games.


Australia used to have several major international studios producing games but 
from 2008, several mainstays shut their doors – Sega, THQ and 2K among them – 
due to the global financial crisis and the rising Australian dollar.

What’s sprung out of this collapse is a series of small innovative Australian 
studios, most of them with between three and 30 employees. We’ve had smash hits 
such as Fruit Ninja, Crossy Road, Flight Control and Shooty Skies sell millions 
of copies around the world each year – but there are many more games that fail 
than succeed.

Here’s our pick of the indie scene from Australia and beyond.

 Mini Metro lets you create your own rail network, if that’s the sort of thing 
you’re into. Photograph: Dinosaur Polo Club 
Ever been stuck on a crowded train and thought, “I could design a better 
transport system”? Well now you have your chance.

In this ever-growing transport network, you need to figure out the best 
combination of lines, carriages and tunnels to get your passengers to where 
they need to go in the most efficient way. The game is so intuitive it doesn’t 
even need instructions – and the soundtrack is fantastic.

 A Township Tale is a virtual reality game where you run a village with others. 
Photograph: Alta 
Sydney-based game company Alta have made a social virtual reality game in 
which you run a village with others, taking turns mining, smithing, hunting and 
building.

Every other VR game I saw at Pax was either about solving puzzles, shooting 
things or “on rails”, meaning it wouldn’t let you move around and explore. 
They’re all fun to play, but A Township Tale was unique. It was refreshing to 
play a game where you could just hang with friends, building things and soaking 
up the atmosphere. In the short demo I played I could see so many 
possibilities; I’m excited to see where they take this one.

This German-made game is set in the near future where all of our movements are 
tracked online, we post publicly on social media, and the state monitors our 
conversations to decide what our secret intentions are.

So, not too far in the future then.

You’re tasked with snooping on potential terrorists after a bombing. You 
monitor their private conversations, look up their police records and use all 
the information at your disposal to decide if they should be prosecuted. Is the 
subject dangerous? Should they be locked away? Or are you making judgements 
without a full picture?

I can’t see where the pirate is unless my ship is facing him. I fire my engine 
to hide in a nebula, but he sees me first and launches a missile – I’m hit! I 
run to the engine room to repair my reactor but it’s too late – a second 
missile disintegrates my ship, and my short spell as a captain is over.

Objects in Space is an open world stealth space-trading game where you are 
captain and maintain your own starship, buying and selling merchandise and 
trying to stay a step ahead of pirates and other dangers in the galaxy.

Flying this ship is not about fancy moves but strategy, timing and stealth. In 
one of the game’s best features, it lets youcreate your own way to control the 
ship <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUw9eFcLCWo>. You don’t need to stick 
with just your keyboard and mouse; you can actually build your own controls 
with buttons, switches and dials.

This makes the game much more immersive, and makes you feel like you really 
are in your own ship. It will be very interesting to see what customised 
interfaces the community creates.

 Death Squared is a cooperative puzzle game you can play with friends or family 
around the TV. Photograph: SMG 
I had a short go of this one with a developer, but I got the most out of 
watching a family of four play together.

They each controlled a square robot and had to solve puzzles by triggering 
switches, moving walls and carrying each other around the map. They died often 
but were ecstatic when they made it to the end of each level together.

The whole game has been created to facilitate this kind of social experience 
in front of a TV, and I love that people of all ages are able to play together; 
it’s all about observation and teamwork, instead of doing things as fast as 
possible.

This cartoony game has you jumping from platform to platform, fighting 
monsters and throwing bombs. With your trusty giraffe by your side, you’re on a 
quest to save your dad from an evil scientist who wants to turn all old people 
into hot dogs.

Adventure Pals draws a lot from cartoons such as Adventure Time or Spongebob 
Squarepants, but manages to pair that absurdist humour with a really fun 
gameplay experience. For instance: when you jump, you can hold the button to 
float downwards more slowly – a simple mechanism used in many of these types of 
games. But in Adventure Pals, the move is visualised by having the giraffe 
stick its head out of your backpack, rotating its tongue like a helicopter 
blade. It’s just a lot of fun to play!

 In Burger Up you need to build bigger burgers than your opponent. Photograph: 
Rule & Make Games 
This is a card game you play with two to four others. You’re competing by 
making burgers. Can you make the Queenslander by getting BBQ sauce, beetroot 
and fried egg? Or will you go for the Iron Giant, using three or more patties? 
Who will win the burger race?

I have a confession to make: I’m an absolute strategy board game geek who can 
spend hours with friends managing campaigns across three different game boards 
at once. But my partner isn’t quite so inclined so I’m always on the look out 
for fun things that can bring us together at home or on a trip. This is the 
kind of fun that can bring a lot of different people around a table. Just in 
front of me at Pax was a couple in their 50s, who bought the game after trying 
it on the show floor.

Plus: everyone likes burgers.

 ‘It makes your brain work hard’: Framed 2. Photograph: Loveshack 
This puzzle game lets you change what happens in the panels of a comic strip. 
When the story first plays out, you’re running from the cops – but you’re 
caught in each page. Can you rearrange the panels to solve the puzzle?

What if you change which corridor you go down first? Or see if you can sneak 
behind the cops instead of running straight into them?

Watching someone play the game, at first I thought they were just reading an 
animated comic – but when I realised what was happening all the gears in my 
brain turned at once. Playing it is a delight; it’s stylish, beautiful to watch 
once you arrange all the panels – and it makes your brain work hard.
