Thousands of fans flocked to the Anaheim Convention Centre in Los Angeles to 
go hands on with the latest and greatest PS4 titles this weekend, but it was 
these announcements that really grabbed the headlines. Here are the seven 
things everyone is talking about:

The Last of Us Part II

Despite the first game’s near perfect conclusion, Naughty Dog are revisiting 
post-apocalyptic surrogate father/daughter pairing Joel and Ellie for a 
full-blown sequel. It’s set a few years later on and we’re playing as a 
vengeful Ellie this time out, but that’s about as much as Neil Druckmann and co 
are prepared to say right now. The teaser trailer is brilliant, mind.

Uncharted: The Lost Legacy

A standalone expansion in a similar vein to (but longer than) The Last of Us 
DLC episode Left Behind, The Lost Legacy is set in war-torn India and, for now 
at least, promises to be a Nathan Drake-free zone. Instead star billing goes to 
Uncharted 2’s Chloe Frazer and the fourth game’s South African mercenary Nadine 
Ross. Let’s hope the boys don’t have to come and save the day.

Hideo Kojima and Guerrilla Games

Superstar developer Hideo Kojima finally confirmed new game Death Stranding 
will run on a modified version of the engine powering impressive open world RPG 
Horizon Zero Dawn named Decima. More than that, he’s also entering into a 
collaborative partnership with the Dutch studio who built it, GuerrillaGames 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games>, and opening a satellite Kojima 
Productions studio in Amsterdam.

Wipeout Omega Collection

Not a new instalment in the seminal sci-fi racing series, sadly, but rather a 
remake of the 2008 PS3 outing Wipeout HD, its 2009 expansion pack, Fury, and 
the 2012 Vita set Wipeout 2048. You’ll need a PS4 Pro and a new telly to make 
the most of the 4K textures, HDR support and 60fps performance boost but the 
good new is it feels as good as it looks.

Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom

Details about this gorgeous looking second collaboration between Japanese RPG 
kings Level-5 and animation auteurs Studio Ghibli are still extremely thin on 
the ground but the confirmation of a western release date at some point in 2017 
and a the unveiling of a new trailer was more than enough to send ripples of 
excitement around the Anaheim Convention Centre.

Nex Machina

In Resogun, Finnish developers Housemarque crafted a near-perfect spiritual 
heir to the seminal arcade shooter Defender so there’s a lovely symmetry to the 
news its successor is a collaboration with its creator, Eugene Jarvis. This 
time out they’ve looked to top down bullet-fests Robotron and Smash TV for 
inspiration and the result already feels like a classic in the making.

Windjammers

One of the more surprising remakes announced at PSX, Windjammers is a result 
of the “building the list” initiative which allows gamers to nominate old games 
for PS4 updates. It’s unlikely whoever put forward this 1994 flying disc game 
originally released on the Neo Geo console had much hope of a positive outcome 
but its existence is proof that some dreams do come true. Or something.
