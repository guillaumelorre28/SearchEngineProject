Saturday morning and Phnom Penh’s French-built station is buzzing as excited 
groups board the inaugural passenger train from Cambodia’s capital to the 
coastal town of Sihanoukville. After 14 years, regular rail services between 
the two cities restarted in May – offering a safer option than road for 
travellers aiming for some beach time.

“This should be much more fun than the bus,” says 30-year-old Ouk Sivonshe. 
“No crazy driving!”

Twenty minutes after we’ve left the city, the views from the large windows are 
of bucolic scenes synonymous with the lower Mekong region – water buffalo 
ploughing fields, palm trees and, in rainy season at least, green rice fields 
as far as one can see.

The service, which currently runs from Friday to Sunday – plus extra dates for 
national holidays – uses two refurbished trains, holding around 200 passengers 
each. The 266km journey to and from the coast takes 6½ hours, but this will be 
cut by two hours later this year – matching the bus journey time, and at almost 
half the price of some bus tickets. Passengers’ motorbikes, and even cars, can 
be transported on the train at an additional cost.

For now, the train stops at two stations between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville: 
Takeo, two hours south of the capital, and home to some little-visited Angkor 
temple ruins; and Kampot, another two hours on.

On the edge of Bokor national park, Kampot is a peaceful coastal town, famous 
for its pepper and salt farms. It is undergoing something of a revival, with a 
handful of new guesthouses and restaurants forcing older places to up their 
game.Kool Kampot 
<http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Kool-Kampot/Kampot/263646> is a 
new hostel with a riverside location (its address is simply: Riverside), and 
Portuguese seafood restaurant Tertúlia (Tuek Chhu Road) is already proving 
popular. Tiny Cafe Espresso, known for its coffees and brunches, has just 
started brewing its own cider and ginger beer – worth the pilgrimage.

Nearby Kep, once the playground of Cambodia’s elite, has largely recovered 
from the ravages of the Khmer Rouge era, and some of the renovated villas are 
opening as guesthouses. Walks in Kep national park, home to macaque monkeys, 
build up an appetite for dinner atKep’s famous crab market 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/28/foodie-traveller-kampot-pepper-cambodia>
.

Those following the line to the end at Sihanoukville, named after the former 
King Sihanouk, can stay to enjoy the lively port city, or jump on a boat to the 
islands ofKoh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jan/31/top-10-beach-hotels-bungalows-cambodia>
 – the latter light on modern amenities and with miles of near-empty golden 
sand.

 The train to Sihanoukville is running again after a 14-year hiatus.

With train travel in neighbouring Thailand and Vietnam featuring on many 
visitors’ itineraries, Cambodia’s gentle resumption of passenger services is 
bound to be popular. The restoration of a second line, linking Phnom Penh with 
the northern border city of Poipet – from where twice-daily trains run to 
Bangkok – is due to finish in February 2017, and prime minister Hun Sen is 
proposing a new line to Siem Reap, home ofAngkor Wat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/angkorwat>. The newfound enthusiasm for 
railways in the kingdom looks set to continue.

• A one-way ticket from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville costs $7; Phnom Penh to 
Kampot $6. Buy tickets at Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville stations, or via Royal 
Railway at +855 078 888 582
