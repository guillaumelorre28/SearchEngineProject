The term pide generally refers to a boat-shaped Turkish pizza that is topped 
with meat and cheese and cooked until crispy. But pide can mean different 
things: Ramazanpidesi is sweet doughy bread served at Ramadan; a similar style 
of pide is used in kebab shops as a base for cooked meat; andiçli pide, or 
filled pide, is the type I know and love.

Içli pide dates back to the 1850s, when bakers in the small town of Bafra, on 
the Black Sea, started stuffing their bread before baking it. This simple dish 
has been modernised with delicious toppings like cheese withsujuk (a cured beef 
sausage) and wafer-thin pastrami with egg.

My first experience of eating this original pide was in Samsun, a sleepy city 
just along the coast from Bafra, where this popular snack is still made on 
Sundays.

I was staying with my partner’s family. His mum cooked a mix of lamb mince, 
onions and black pepper in plenty of butter, which she told us to take down the 
road to the wonderful old baker. He spread the filling on to a thinly rolled 
piece of dough, expertly folded in the sides and shuffled the dough on to a 
wooden paddle that went into a roaring wood-fired oven. Once it was cooked, a 
generous amount of butter was brushed over the top and we carried the crispy 
Bafra pide back to a table of hungry relatives and a happy home.

Samsun has some of the oldest pide salons in Turkey and Gözde Pide Salonu 
<https://www.facebook.com/GozdePideSalonu> is one of the best in town. It’s run 
by two brothers who make incredible pastrami and egg pide as well as the Bafra 
version.
