Whenever Steve Peters walks into work on the day the Archibald Prize entrants 
start rolling in, there’s one thing foremost on his mind: will any of them be 
good enough for the Packing Room Prize?

With 51 per cent of the vote on his shoulders and 33 years of the Archibald 
Prize under his belt, what the Art Gallery of New South Wales’ head packer 
mainly wants is a portrait of someone he recognises.

This year he didn’t have to wait long before French-born Sydney artist Bruno 
Jean Grasswill walked in with his entry.

“He pulled back its cover and there was Michael,” Peters says. “I thought: 
‘You beauty! We’ve got something we can recognise. We’ve got one in that’s 
good.’”

The Michael in question is actor Michael Caton, an Australian household name 
since the 1970s for his work in TV and film and the man famous as Darryl “tell 
him he’s dreaming” Kerrigan from 1997’s The Castle.

“Everyone who saw Michael loved it,” Peters says. “A few of the boys said: ‘Is 
it in the running?’ and I said: ‘Absolutely.’”

The Packing Room Prize is the irreverent accompaniment to the Archibald Prize– 
one of the nation’s top portrait prizes. The unusual tradition started 24 years 
ago after Peters made an off-hand remark about a portrait of former Australian 
senator Gareth Evans “winning the packing room prize”.

Peters and his crew judge the works before the trustees get to them and they 
make their selection from the entire range of entries, which this year numbered 
832. If the Packing Room winner fails to make the Archibald finalists it hangs 
just outside the exhibition.

“It has to be good and that knocks out a lot!” Peters says of his selection 
criteria. “I don’t think it’s a crime for the finished product to look like the 
subject. For me some artists lose that side of things.”

The subject also has to be someone who is easily recognisable to the general 
population – not a requirement the trustees always consider, according to the 
storeman.

“There are few good enough and popular enough to win the Packing Room Prize,” 
he says.

After deciding the winner of the Prize more than a week earlier, on the 
morning of the announcement on Thursday July 9 Peters had a great surprise.

Caton was supposed to be attending a post-State of Origin birthday lunch for 
Queensland league legend and coach Mal Meninga in Brisbane but at the last 
minute changed his flights and came to the gallery instead.

Peters, a huge fan of The Castle, was delighted to meet him.

“He was absolutely down to earth and a very nice man. He signed the celebrity 
air conditioning duct that we have. His message was: ‘Steve, you’ve got good 
taste.’”

The winning artist Bruno Jean Grasswill, 69, has been submitting to the 
Archibald Prize regularly since moving to Australia in 1971. He says he chose 
Caton as his subject after meeting him socially.

“I saw a contradictory rawness and sophistication in Michael’s face. In 
presenting a discreet smile while he peers into the dark side of life, I’m 
mixing Shakespearean comedy and tragedy.”

Nigel Milsom was announced the winner of the Archibald Prize with his portrait 
of barrister Charles Waterstreet. The exhibition is now open to the public and 
runs until September 27 before touring regionally.

Here’s what Steve Peters has to say on the winners of his prize over the past 
five years:

Michael Caton – Bruno Jean Graswill (2015)

“I think the portrait is terrific. For me, it was always going to be a 
contender. That’s what the other guys thought as well.

“One of the things for us is it must be someone you know. It has to be easily 
recognisable and Michael Caton, through his TV, film and stage work, a lot of 
people will know him.”

“I remember when it came in last year I thought it was absolutely fantastic. 
It was a bit abstract but easily identifiable. It was Les and it was a beauty. 
It had stains everywhere all over his pale blue suit.

“I’m a great Sir Les fan. I’ve seen a few of his shows and every time I can’t 
believe how funny it is. I’m just hopeless, crying it’s so funny.”

“Mathew has been coming into the gallery for years and all his work has been 
good. It was a great picture. I met Tara on the opening night of the exhibition 
and I couldn’t get over how tall she was. I’ve seen her doing a show on Foxtel. 
She’s a very attractive girl.”

“The work was good and easily recognisable as John Wood. Every year there are 
two to three works we think are good. Raelene did a picture this year of Gary 
Sweet. It got pipped at the post by Michael Caton. There can only be one 
winner. Another contender for 2015 was Laurie Daley by Jan Williamson.”

“I didn’t know who did it but I thought: ‘Fantastic – it’s Matt Moran.’ I’d 
seen Matt numerous times on the cooking shows. It was a very good picture. I 
thought: ‘Here comes dinner, I’ll get a steak sandwich out of that.’”
