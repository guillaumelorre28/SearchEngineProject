The son of Equatorial Guinea’s leader is due to go on trial for corruption and 
money laundering in a landmark case inFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>.

Obiang, the 47-year-old vice-president of the oil-rich but impoverished 
African country, faces an array of legal cases across Europe as authorities on 
the continent investigate the sources of his vast wealth and uncover new and 
even more extravagant ways that he spent some of it.

 US officials have already forced Obiang to forfeit property after accusing 
him of “shamelessly” looting his country. In a settlement, Obiang agreed to 
hand over more than $30m (£24.5m) worth of properties, including a vast villa 
in Malibu, California, and a dozen luxury cars.

 Obiang, however, managed to keep his $38m private jet and collection of 
Michael Jackson memorabilia, which includes a crystal-studded glove.

In Europe, Dutch, Swiss and French authorities have seized property including 
Obiang’s 76-metre yacht, the Ebony Shine, and a mansion in Paris estimated to 
be worth $200m.


 The mansion includes a cinema, spa, hair salon and sports room. Bathroom taps 
were covered in gold leaf while original paintings by Degas and Renoir hung on 
the walls.

Cars seized in Geneva included a Swedish-manufactured vehicle worth $2.8m and 
a $2m Bugatti Veyron.

French prosecutors allege that Obiang plundered nearly $115m between 2004-11 
when he was agriculture minister for his father, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, 
who has been in power since 1979.

The post gave Obiang control over the lucrative timber industry. Proceeds from 
a so-called revolutionary tax imposed on wood sales was transferred to his 
personal accounts, prosecutors allege.

In court on Monday, one of Obiang’s lawyers asked for the trial be suspended 
on the grounds that his client had not been given enough time to properly 
prepare his defence, having been summoned to trial just three weeks ago.
“We’re not talking about a moped theft charge,” Emmanuel Marsigny told Reuters.

 The trial marks a major shift for France, which has long turned a blind eye 
to corrupt African dictators buying Parisian real estate, enjoying spending 
sprees in the capital or on the Coôte d’Azur, or simply fleeing to the country 
when in difficulty.

The policy was seen as part of a wider attempt by France to maintain influence 
in former colonies, but also in Africa.Equatorial Guinea

 The change is in part due to evolving popular and political values, greater 
media scrutiny at home and abroad, and nearly a decade of lobbying by
anti-corruption campaigners. <https://www.transparency.org/>

 “In the beginning, there was simply no political will in France to listen to 
us,” wrote one of the campaigners, William Bourdon from the Sherpa group, in 
September.

 The move by Swiss authorities 
<http://qz.com/827859/bugatti-ferrari-and-koenigegg-one-were-among-seized-cars-of-equatorial-guineas-vp-obiang/>
 also indicates a tougher stance, observers say.

 Obiang is expected to plead not guilty in the Paris court to charges of 
laundering the proceeds of corruption, embezzlement and misuse of public funds.

 He has “always said he earned the money legally in his country”, Marsigny 
told Agence France-Presse news agency.

 The defendant, who has failed with previous legal efforts to stop the trial, 
is not expected to attend or serve any sentence if he is convicted.

 Campaigners say the case will set an important precedent and has cost 
Obiang’s father diplomatic capital in the region.

 Now the longest-serving African ruler, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo made his 
son vice-president in June just after being re-elected with his usual score of 
more than 90% of votes cast.

 Born in 1969, Obiang was 10 when his father overthrew his bloodthirsty uncle, 
the dictator Francisco Macías Nguema. He has denied all wrongdoing and, during 
one of his appeals against the French trial, a lawyer acting for the French 
government said his client had a “compulsive need to buy”.

 Obiang is known to have bought a crystal-covered glove worn by Michael 
Jackson during his Bad tour, which is worth hundreds of thousands of euros. Its 
whereabouts are unclear.

The US justice department said he “embarked on a corruption-fuelled spending 
spree in the United States” after racking up $300m through embezzlement, 
extortion and money laundering.

 Equatorial Guinea is regularly criticised by human rights groups for its 
repressive laws, unlawful killings, use of torture and corruption.

In December, Obiang’s lawyers failed to convince the international court of 
justice that he had diplomatic immunity and so had no case to answer in France.

 Obiang has denied ownership of the luxury yacht seized by Dutch authorities,  
<http://qz.com/860194/equatorial-guineas-teodorin-obiang-has-had-his-luxury-yacht-seized-in-the-netherlands/>
claiming it belonged to his country’s government.

According to specialist media, Obiang has another yacht, worth even more, in 
Tangier, Morocco.


 The life expectancy in Equatorial Guinea, Africa’s third largest oil producer,
 is 57 years for men and 60 for women, <http://www.who.int/countries/gnq/en/> 
one of the lowest levels in the world.
