European markets slide again

Continuing concerns about the state of the global economy after a series of 
disappointing data from around the world continued to send shares lower. Poor 
UK construction figures and lower than forecast US private sector job numbers 
from ADP were the latest repots to unsettle investors.

Meanwhile oil slipped back from its early highs after a higher than expected 
increase in US crude stocks, while metal prices suffered on worries about China 
after its recent weak manufacturing figures. So commodity companies were among 
the biggest fallers.

And there was always Donald Trump’s approaching victory in the Republican 
nominations to provide another reason for investors to tread carefully.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 73.57 or 1.19% to a four week low of 6112.02 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 0.99% to 9828.25 
 * France’s Cac closed 1.09% lower at 4324.23 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.17% to 17,935.67 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 1.26% at 8654.3 
 * In Greece, the Athens market bucked the trend, adding 1.1% to 590.05 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 111 points 
or 0.6%, while Brent crude is down 0.49% at $44.75 a barrel.

On that note, we’ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and 
we’ll be back tomorrow.

In its statement 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2016/html/pr160504.en.html>, the ECB 
said:

It has decided to permanently stop producing the €500 banknote and to exclude 
it from the Europa series, taking into account concerns that this banknote 
could facilitate illicit activities. The issuance of the €500 will be stopped 
around the end of 2018, when the €100 and €200 banknotes of the Europa series 
are planned to be introduced.

4.15pm BST 16:15  <> 

The mixed picture from the day’s US economic figures does not mean a June rate 
rise is completely off the table. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

Today’s abundance of US data has made for a difficult trading environment, 
with contrasting data points providing mixed expectations for monetary policy 
implications. The overwhelmingly positive release of services and composite PMI 
readings helped paint an encouraging picture for US business, with improved 
factory orders and trade balance helping raise rate hike expectations for the 
June meeting.

However, the picture has been muddled by a shockingly poor April ADP non-farm 
payrolls number, which at 156,000 fell to the lowest level in over two years. 
The ADP reading is the only figure of the day that has a second bite at the 
cherry and if Friday’s headline figure confounds today’s ADP weakness, we are 
likely to see a significant rise in June rate hike expectations.

 The resurgence of the US dollar this week has sent shockwaves throughout the 
foreign exchange markets, as traders begin to realise that perhaps a 15-month 
low in the dollar index makes little sense just six weeks away from an 
increasingly ‘live’ [Federal Reserve] meeting. While markets are currently 
pricing in just a 12% chance of a June hike, the reality is likely to be 
higher, given the hawkish tone of recent Fed member comments.

US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, according to the latest 
figures from the Energy Information Administration.

Inventories climbed by 2.8m barrels compared to forecasts of a 750,000 
increase. Crude prices have come off their best levels following the figures, 
but even so, Brent is still up 0.8% at $45.33 a barrel. Earlier in the day it 
had climbed as high as $46.01.

And here’s the agenda for Monday’s Eurogroup meeting 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/eurogroup/2016/05/09/>, including 
talks on the Greece’s debt:

The Eurogroup will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the state of play 
of the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Greece.

Discussions will cover a comprehensive package of policy reforms as well as 
the sustainability of Greece’s public debt. Both elements need to be in place 
in order to finalise the programme’s first review and unlock further financial 
assistance to Greece.

Over in Greece, and efforts are continuing to reach a deal between the country 
and its creditors ahead of a proposed Eurogroup meeting next week. Greek 
newspaperKathimerini reports 
<http://www.ekathimerini.com/208359/article/ekathimerini/business/euro-working-group-holds-teleconference-aiming-to-bridge-differences>
:

Deputy eurozone finance ministers, known as the Euro Working Group (EWG), will 
hold a conference call on Wednesday aimed at bridging differences between the 
government in Athens and foreign creditors ahead of a crucial eurogroup meeting 
on Monday, May 9.

The teleconference is expected to focus on an additional 3.6 billion euros’ 
worth of contingency measures that Greece is being asked to implement should it 
miss budget targets in 2018.

The extra measures have been demanded by the International Monetary Fund, 
which deems that the 5.4 billion euros’ worth of measures set out in Greece’s 
third international bailout are inadequate for it to achieve a budget surplus 
worth 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2018.

Greek officials have instead proposed the activation of an automatic mechanism 
for cutting state spending in the event that the government misses budget 
targets.

IMF officials are also expected to take part in Wednesday’s teleconference. 
Greece will be represented by Alternate Finance Minister Giorgos Houliarakis.

for those in the energy industry, but has not been enough to initiate hiring or 
spending.” (Professional, Scientific & Technical Services)

season.” (Wholesale Trade)

US service sector grows faster than expected

And here’s is confirmation of a stronger US services sector.

The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index 
<https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ISMReport/NonMfgROB.cfm?> has 
climbed from 54.5 in March to 55.7 last month, better than the forecast level 
of 54.7. This is the highest level since December.

The new orders index rose to 59.9 in April, up from 56.7 the previous month.

But business activity slowed, with the index dipping from 59.8 in March to 
58.8.

The first set of US services data is out and is slightly better than expected.

The Markit services final PMI has come in at 52.8 for April, up from the 
initial reading of 52.1 and March’s level of 51.3.

The final composite reading - both services and manufacturing - was 52.4, up 
from an initial 51.7 and 51.3 in March.

Still to come are the figures from ISM’s services survey.

Wall Street opens lower

Not surprisingly US markets are once more following their global counterparts 
lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 106 points or 0.6%, 
following the weaker than expected ADP jobs data. The disappointing figures 
added to the general unease about a whole spate of releases pointing to a 
slowdown in the global economy.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both opened around 0.5% lower.

Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has fallen 0.99% - albeit off its worst levels - while 
Germany’s Dax is down 0.74% and France’s Cac is off 0.77%.

More from the US.

The country’s trade deficit fell by more than expected in March, down 13.9% to 
$40.4bn, as imports fell to their lowest level since 2010.

Meanwhile US productivity dropped at a 1% annual rate in the first quarter, 
the second quarterly decline. Labour costs rose by 4.1%, the quickest pace 
since the fourth quarter of 2014.

Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics which helps compile the ADP 
jobs data, said:

The job market appears to have stumbled in April. Job growth noticeably 
slowed, with some weakness across most sectors. One month does not make a 
trend, but this bears close watching as the financial market turmoil earlier in 
the year may have done some damage to business hiring.

The poor ADP jobs data adds to the feeling the US Federal Reserve may not be 
in a rush to raise interest rates but the report is worrying for the US 
economy, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said:

The US dollar fell sharply in the immediate aftermath of the release as poor 
jobs data reduces the likelihood of a rate hike next month from the US Fed.

Investors see the ADP data as a “heads-up” ahead of the official Non-Farm 
Payroll report which is due out this Friday. It certainly is effective in 
measuring the overall trend in the data, but it can be patchy on a 
month-by-month basis. This is because the government’s number tends to be 
considerably more volatile, and of course it is this volatility that traders 
look for and react to. So the fact that today’s release was so far away from 
trend will have traders scratching their heads. It may be positive for risk 
assets for the Fed to hold off from hiking rates, but it sends a grim message 
about the US economy.

US jobs figures lower than expected

Ahead of Friday’s US non-farm payroll numbers, the monthly survey of private 
sector jobs from ADP 
<http://mediacenter.adp.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=969068> came in much 
lower than expected.

ADP said US employment increased by 156,000 private sector jobs in April, 
compared to 194,000 last month and expectations of a rise of between 195,000 
and 200,000 this time round.

Last month’s figure was revised down from the initial estimate of 200,000.

Continuing concerns about the state of the global economy after a series of 
disappointing data from around the world continued to send shares lower. Poor 
UK construction figures and lower than forecast US private sector job numbers 
from ADP were the latest repots to unsettle investors.

Meanwhile oil slipped back from its early highs after a higher than expected 
increase in US crude stocks, while metal prices suffered on worries about China 
after its recent weak manufacturing figures. So commodity companies were among 
the biggest fallers.

And there was always Donald Trump’s approaching victory in the Republican 
nominations to provide another reason for investors to tread carefully.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 73.57 or 1.19% to a four week low of 6112.02 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 0.99% to 9828.25 
 * France’s Cac closed 1.09% lower at 4324.23 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.17% to 17,935.67 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 1.26% at 8654.3 
 * In Greece, the Athens market bucked the trend, adding 1.1% to 590.05 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 111 points 
or 0.6%, while Brent crude is down 0.49% at $44.75 a barrel.

On that note, we’ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and 
we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
In its statement 
<https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2016/html/pr160504.en.html>, the ECB 
said:

It has decided to permanently stop producing the €500 banknote and to exclude 
it from the Europa series, taking into account concerns that this banknote 
could facilitate illicit activities. The issuance of the €500 will be stopped 
around the end of 2018, when the €100 and €200 banknotes of the Europa series 
are planned to be introduced.

As expected 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/04/500-euro-banknote-could-be-scrapped-crime>
, the European Central Bank has said it will no longer produce or issue €500 
notes.

It added that existing notes will still remain legal tender and retain their 
value.

The mixed picture from the day’s US economic figures does not mean a June rate 
rise is completely off the table. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

Today’s abundance of US data has made for a difficult trading environment, 
with contrasting data points providing mixed expectations for monetary policy 
implications. The overwhelmingly positive release of services and composite PMI 
readings helped paint an encouraging picture for US business, with improved 
factory orders and trade balance helping raise rate hike expectations for the 
June meeting.

However, the picture has been muddled by a shockingly poor April ADP non-farm 
payrolls number, which at 156,000 fell to the lowest level in over two years. 
The ADP reading is the only figure of the day that has a second bite at the 
cherry and if Friday’s headline figure confounds today’s ADP weakness, we are 
likely to see a significant rise in June rate hike expectations.

 The resurgence of the US dollar this week has sent shockwaves throughout the 
foreign exchange markets, as traders begin to realise that perhaps a 15-month 
low in the dollar index makes little sense just six weeks away from an 
increasingly ‘live’ [Federal Reserve] meeting. While markets are currently 
pricing in just a 12% chance of a June hike, the reality is likely to be 
higher, given the hawkish tone of recent Fed member comments.
 
US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, according to the latest 
figures from the Energy Information Administration.

Inventories climbed by 2.8m barrels compared to forecasts of a 750,000 
increase. Crude prices have come off their best levels following the figures, 
but even so, Brent is still up 0.8% at $45.33 a barrel. Earlier in the day it 
had climbed as high as $46.01.

And here’s the agenda for Monday’s Eurogroup meeting 
<http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/eurogroup/2016/05/09/>, including 
talks on the Greece’s debt:

The Eurogroup will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the state of play 
of the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Greece.

Discussions will cover a comprehensive package of policy reforms as well as 
the sustainability of Greece’s public debt. Both elements need to be in place 
in order to finalise the programme’s first review and unlock further financial 
assistance to Greece.
 
Over in Greece, and efforts are continuing to reach a deal between the country 
and its creditors ahead of a proposed Eurogroup meeting next week. Greek 
newspaperKathimerini reports 
<http://www.ekathimerini.com/208359/article/ekathimerini/business/euro-working-group-holds-teleconference-aiming-to-bridge-differences>
:

Deputy eurozone finance ministers, known as the Euro Working Group (EWG), will 
hold a conference call on Wednesday aimed at bridging differences between the 
government in Athens and foreign creditors ahead of a crucial eurogroup meeting 
on Monday, May 9.

The teleconference is expected to focus on an additional 3.6 billion euros’ 
worth of contingency measures that Greece is being asked to implement should it 
miss budget targets in 2018.

The extra measures have been demanded by the International Monetary Fund, 
which deems that the 5.4 billion euros’ worth of measures set out in Greece’s 
third international bailout are inadequate for it to achieve a budget surplus 
worth 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2018.

Greek officials have instead proposed the activation of an automatic mechanism 
for cutting state spending in the event that the government misses budget 
targets.

IMF officials are also expected to take part in Wednesday’s teleconference. 
Greece will be represented by Alternate Finance Minister Giorgos Houliarakis.
 
And here are some of the comments made by the survey’s respondents:

 * “Severe non-skilled labor shortage is hurting the construction industry.” 
(Construction) 
 * “Business is holding steady, revenue is almost as anticipated and costs are 
lower which is helping to maintain current profitability.” (Finance & Insurance)
 * “We expect our business condition to improve in Q2 as compared to Q1. 
Typically, Q1 is our slowest period and business activity picks up later 
through the year.” (Health Care & Social Assistance) 
 * “Very favorable cost conditions all around.” (Accommodation & Food Services)
 * “In higher education we are gearing up for the summer conference season. 
This impacts (increases) the spend in our service category and drives income 
from many campuses.” (Educational Services) 
 * “Recent upturn in oil prices is creating a slightly more positive outlook 
for those in the energy industry, but has not been enough to initiate hiring or 
spending.” (Professional, Scientific & Technical Services) 
 * “Business is still improving. Trucking has tightened due to produce hauling 
season.” (Wholesale Trade) 
 * “Heading into a slower season, but cautious optimism of modest gains from 
same period last year.” (Retail Trade)  
Here are the details of the ISM survey:

And here’s is confirmation of a stronger US services sector.

The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index 
<https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ISMReport/NonMfgROB.cfm?> has 
climbed from 54.5 in March to 55.7 last month, better than the forecast level 
of 54.7. This is the highest level since December.

The new orders index rose to 59.9 in April, up from 56.7 the previous month.

But business activity slowed, with the index dipping from 59.8 in March to 
58.8.

<https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/727858800225599489>  
The first set of US services data is out and is slightly better than expected.

The Markit services final PMI has come in at 52.8 for April, up from the 
initial reading of 52.1 and March’s level of 51.3.

The final composite reading - both services and manufacturing - was 52.4, up 
from an initial 51.7 and 51.3 in March.

Still to come are the figures from ISM’s services survey.
 
Not surprisingly US markets are once more following their global counterparts 
lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 106 points or 0.6%, 
following the weaker than expected ADP jobs data. The disappointing figures 
added to the general unease about a whole spate of releases pointing to a 
slowdown in the global economy.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both opened around 0.5% lower.

Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has fallen 0.99% - albeit off its worst levels - while 
Germany’s Dax is down 0.74% and France’s Cac is off 0.77%.
 
More from the US.

The country’s trade deficit fell by more than expected in March, down 13.9% to 
$40.4bn, as imports fell to their lowest level since 2010.

Meanwhile US productivity dropped at a 1% annual rate in the first quarter, 
the second quarterly decline. Labour costs rose by 4.1%, the quickest pace 
since the fourth quarter of 2014.

Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics which helps compile the ADP 
jobs data, said:

The job market appears to have stumbled in April. Job growth noticeably 
slowed, with some weakness across most sectors. One month does not make a 
trend, but this bears close watching as the financial market turmoil earlier in 
the year may have done some damage to business hiring.

The poor ADP jobs data adds to the feeling the US Federal Reserve may not be 
in a rush to raise interest rates but the report is worrying for the US 
economy, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said:

The US dollar fell sharply in the immediate aftermath of the release as poor 
jobs data reduces the likelihood of a rate hike next month from the US Fed.

Investors see the ADP data as a “heads-up” ahead of the official Non-Farm 
Payroll report which is due out this Friday. It certainly is effective in 
measuring the overall trend in the data, but it can be patchy on a 
month-by-month basis. This is because the government’s number tends to be 
considerably more volatile, and of course it is this volatility that traders 
look for and react to. So the fact that today’s release was so far away from 
trend will have traders scratching their heads. It may be positive for risk 
assets for the Fed to hold off from hiking rates, but it sends a grim message 
about the US economy.
