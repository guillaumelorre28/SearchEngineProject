My bra history goes like this: young, flat-chested and embarrassed, I would 
guess my size and grab the first bra I could find in M&S, rather than actually 
seeking advice or trying anything on. Older, saggier and less concerned about 
what other people think, I’m more inclined to loiter in underwear departments, 
demanding attention and feeding my expensive lingerie habit. I’m wondering if 
there is a correlation? As confidence and earnings go up, nipples head in the 
opposite direction.

Age, hormones, gravity – as we get older, our breasts change size and shape, 
becoming more fatty and less glandular and hence softer and less pert, 
particularly after menopause. “Sagging is a natural occurrence,” states Nancy 
Szachno-Dressel, lingerie buyer for John Lewis, “and there’s nothing wrong with 
that, but many women stick with the size they’ve always had, even when their 
body changes shape.”

I much prefer to go for a proper bra fitting now than I did in my youth. One 
of my top tips on staying stylish for ever is to spend time finding clothes 
that fit, whether that’s shoes, tailoring or lingerie. Clothes look so much 
better and can boost confidence when they fit properly.

The last time I bought a bra, I was a size larger size than just a year 
before, a phenomenon that,according to scientific research by the International 
Health Foundation, Netherlands <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15223108>, 
can affect almost a fifth of women. A survey of 1,130 postmenopausal women 
reported that 18.6% of the women had to buy a larger bra size and concluded 
that “the most important factor associated with such an increase in breast size 
after menopause was weight gain”. Hooray. Bigger tits, at last.

I’m less of a lingerie skinflint now and spend money wisely; I’m more likely 
to splash out on expensive French brands than go for the cheaper option, 
though, having said that, I have found some good stuffin the Rosie for

’s Noeuds et Merveilles, which roughly translates as “nodes and marvels”. 
Marvellous nodes – I like it.

I’m not alone when it comes to my “buy better” bra habit. According to Holly 
Mountfort, lingerie technical manager at Figleaves.com, older women who can 
afford to do so tend to go for luxury and comfort. “I would recommend looking 
for styles with more flexible underwires – a lot of French brands use lighter 
wires and softer fabrics. And T-shirt bras are very popular because they offer 
a smooth look and light lift.” Mountford recommends theLepel Fiore full-cup bra

 and Lulu Tout for larger cup sizes and French brands Aubade and Maison Lejaby.

There’s also new brand Silent Assembly 
<http://www.silentassembly.co.uk/collections/bras/products/lana-contour-plunge-bra-black>
 to consider. Launching in Selfridges later this year, 3D technology is used to 
replace metal underwires with “engineered plastic ribs” and moulded pads which, 
apparently, improve comfort and fit. “Regular fittings are essential,” says 
company founder Kay Cohen. “Breasts change shape and soften and I have found 
that some women want fuller coverage from their bras as they age and experience 
the breast tissue softening – or, as one customer put it, ‘wobble more’. It 
does feel more comfortable if breasts are more contained in a fuller bra.”

 Bra £57, shorty £37 Simone Perele 
Experts recommend replacing bras every six months, but I think this is a bit 
excessive. Even if the label says machine washable, I usually hand-wash mine, 
but once it starts to loosen and slip, it’s time to get rid of any lingerie 
that’s languishing at the back of a drawer. “Don’t hold on to a saggy old bra 
because it’s comfortable,” says Schazno-Dressel. “The underband of a bra 
provides 80% of the support and this softens with washing and wearing. While 
your bra may feel comfortable, it may no longer be offering the optimum level 
of support, so an old bra may not be your bust’s best friend.”

No fear of that for me; now that oestrogen has left the building, I have 
become increasingly intolerant of bras that don’t do their job properly. Who 
wants to be hoicking and and hitching? Much better to sling out saggy bras and 
show off those marvelous nodes.
