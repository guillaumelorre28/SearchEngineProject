The last few years have seen songs from Africa, particularly afrobeats, 
gradually gaining global attention. In 2016, the continent finally stamped its 
musical influence on the rest of the world; Wizkid collaborated with Drake on 
the summer smash hit One Dance, and no less than five stars signed mega deals 
with some of the biggest record labels on the other side of the Atlantic. 
Here’s a pick of 10 of the best songs that gotAfrica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> grooving all year long – from 
artists looking to light up 2017.

Tekno – Pana

Not everyone can make a hit based on sexualising west Africa’s favourite tuber 
crop, thecassava <http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/3660051.jpg>; but 
Tekno Miles succeeds spectacularly. The 23-year old glides gloriously on an 
unruly instrumental to wreak havoc; spraying beautiful nonsense about doing 
anything for love. Party-goers need succour for the soul as two of Africa’s 
biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, battle currency woes due that 
mirror those of their western counterparts. If you’re in the mood and looking 
to hit the floor like your currency, this is the song to help you gravitate.

In the 90s, Tanzanian legend Saida Karoli’s classic Maria Salome was a hit 
across most of east Africa and wasone of the soundtracks to Tyler Perry’s 2013 
film, Peeples <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1699755/soundtrack>. More than two 
decades later, a remake by her compatriot Naseeb Abdul Juma – better known in 
these parts as the singing sensationDiamond Platnumz 
<https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDiamondplatnumz> – has become a hit, too. The 
27-year-old’s version features Wasafi Music labelmate Rayvanny and combines 
some of the best traditional outfits across Africa in its colourful slideshow 
of a video that has over 10m YouTube views. It’s a Kiswahili extravaganza.

Mr Eazi feat Joey B and Dammy Krane – Hollup

Tosin Ajibade has taken a path less travelled by artists on the 
Nigerian-Ghanaian axis, succeeding in his adopted country first before 
returning to his home country and consolidating his position as 2016’s breakout 
star in the region. His hits are currently dominating dancefloors from Accra to 
Lagos and evenBoko Haram-ravaged Maiduguri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/clubbing-birthplace-boko-haram-maiduguri-nigeria>
, where he made a surprise appearance in October todonate relief items to the 
refugees 
<http://ameyawdebrah.com/photos-mr-eazi-checks-nightlife-maiduguri-lights-boko-haram-ravaged-city/>
 (he became the first Nigerian A-lister to visit the city in a decade and the 
second celebrity after Bono since the insurgency began in 2009). Hollup is a 
mid-tempo goofy ode to it-girls on social media, with help from Ghana’s Joey B 
and Nigeria’s Dammy Krane. The opening line – “You think say the world dey 
revolve around your bum bum” – will suck you in, before he sings about being 
ignored first, then being fussed over now he’s a star.

Patoranking feat Sarkodie – No Kissing Baby
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8T-GeoXlEBg&picture=>

No Kissing Baby is another west African connection that harmonises Nigerian 
pidgin, Ghanaian Twi and Jamaican patois into one rolling ball of feel-good 
music, as Nigerian dancehall-reggae star Patoranking advocates for sexual 
consent alongside Ghana’s Sarkodie who pauses mid-flow to ask: can I touch you? 
The first single off his God Over Everything album, it follows in Patoranking’s 
usually conservative tradition of propagating good morals. However, while the 
lyrics show a tendency to negotiate, the riffs on the instrumental will go 
against your will to stay static. It’s no surprise that video has surpassed 10m 
YouTube views.

Babe Wodumo feat Mampintsha – Wololo
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DhlkybvVEQ4g&picture=>

She came out of virtually nowhere, but 23-year-old Bongekile Simelane has put 
the otherwise unknown gqom, a dance sub-genre of the popular kwaito from the 
city of Durban, on the map. On Wololo, the first single off her debut album, 
she features label boss Mampintsha in what has become the summer anthem in 
Johannesburg and environs, displacing other established acts from the airwaves 
and charts.

Eugy x Mr Eazi – Dance for Me
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBmRWXHRPZyo&picture=>

You’d be hard-pressed to find a bad Mr Eazi verse, and it’s no different on 
Dance for Me, during which he hops on as a guest vocalist to usher in Ghanaian 
rapper Eugy. The unofficial anthem of this year’s Notting Hill carnival, Eugy 
urges a love interest to perform some of Africa’s most popular contemporary 
dances – the Nigerianshoki, the Ghanaian alkayida and the imported dab – as 
they live happily ever after.

Kwesta feat Cassper Nyovest – Ngudu 
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWPU5dMC4y-M&picture=>

This laid-back cut is dedicated to the cheap South African beer that rappers, 
Kwesta and Cassper Nyovest – arguably the foremost rapper on the continent - 
drink while enjoying the finer things in life. It is an exercise in genre 
obfuscation, a blend of kwaito, hip-hop and trap music to lay the groundwork 
for a summer of chilling.

Yemi Alade – Koffi Anan
Facebook  
<https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZoU3tUldZ9w&picture=>

Ms Alade, one of the biggest female artists out of Africa right now, launched 
2016 with this fire freestyle which namechecks two of the most popular 
Ghanaians alive: former UN secretary generalKofi Annan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/kofi-annan> and tongue-twisting hip-hop 
artist Sarkodie. The Nigerian songstress’s goals in the interim are neither for 
regional nor world peace, but to introduce a new dance that is a hybrid of
Ghana’s world-famousazonto, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/03/ghana-azonto-dance-craze-world> 
its less-travelled sibling, Nigeria’salingo and a few other energetic moves.

DJ Maphorisa feat Wizkid, DJ Buckz – Soweto Baby

One-quarter of South African band Uhuru, DJ Maphorisa is one of the 
lesser-known names with co-producer credits onDrake’s One Dance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/29/bryan-adams-retains-record-for-longest-time-at-uk-no-1-charts-drake>
, the summer anthem that got the entire world – and aliens on the mothership in 
Earth’s orbit – tapping its feet. He recruits Wizkid, who was also on the 
chart-topper, and fellow South African DJ Buckz for this kwaito track about a 
mesmerising girl from Nelson Mandela’s hometown, Soweto.

After clinching a nomination for best international act at the BET awards and 
getting Barack Obama to do the Lipala dance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/jul/26/obama-performs-traditional-lipala-dance-kenyan-state-dinner-video>
 in 2015, frontline Kenyan boy band Sauti Sol’s hot streak continued this year 
with the stellar monochrome visuals for the a cappella hitKuliko Jana 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojvz49lSfM4>. Their biggest work was linking 
with Tanzania’s Alikiba (who signed to Sony Music this year) for the dance 
number Unconditionally Bae, which has racked up over 4m YouTube views.
