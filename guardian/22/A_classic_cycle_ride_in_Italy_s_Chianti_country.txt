‘The Giro is a wonderful physical tonic, an extraordinary outing in the 
country, a pilgrimage from one trattoria to another through gastronomic 
Italy...”

This tantalising glimpse of the 19 stages of the 1949 Giro d’Italia as “a 
series of restful heavens” was how one reporter related the experience of 
following the race to Dino Buzzati, the renowned Italian journalist, dramatist 
and author, who was about to cover his first cycling event for the daily 
newspaper Corriere della Sera.

A pilgrimage through gastronomic Italy is precisely what I had in mind when I 
decided to ride a section of this year’s Giro, a month ahead of the 99th tour 
of Italy. I chose my course wisely: stage nine, the individual time trial from 
Radda to Greve in Chianti, one of the shorter segments of the race, at 40.5km. 
It is a mere trifle compared with the average stage length of 161km and the 
total of 3,383km that the professionals will cover during the three-week race.

This time trial has been dubbed the Chianti Classico stage in reference to the 
300-year-old wine consortium that produces 35 million bottles of wine a year in 
the region it passes through. Perfect. Time trial stages in big races are 
usually flat and fast – a race against the clock – which, even for me, would 
mean less than two hours in the saddle. Better still.

That would leave plenty of time to explore this poster region of Tuscany over 
a weekend’s riding – leisurely rolls through the countryside, ducking into 
village cafes for a morning espresso, lingering over Tuscan lunches in medieval 
towns with panoramic views, and sloshing back a few glasses at some of the 
vineyards bearing the Gallo Nero emblem – the Black Rooster symbol of the 
Chianti Classico wine zone.

 The writer takes a breather on the Chianti Classico. 
The flaw in my plan became apparent on the evening drive from Pisa airport to 
my rented house near Radda in Chianti. As soon as I left the uniform dual 
carriageway leading south-east from the city, the country roads of Chianti 
kicked up. In the dark, as I ground through the gears over the rollercoaster 
roads, the landscape felt a little more dramatic than I’d anticipated.

There was a sense of relief when I eventually pulled up on a little gravel 
track a couple of hours later. I had arrived at the first “restful heaven”. The 
godsend was that the owner of La Casanova , a one-bedroom cottage on the edge 
of the walled town of Radda, also runs theCasa Porciatti 
<http://www.casaporciatti.it/> deli and an enoteca (wine shop) in the town, so 
the fridge was stocked with prosciutto, sheep’s cheese and tomatoes, and there 
was a loaf of bread and a bottle of Lilliano Chianti on the kitchen table.

 How the pros do it … the Giro d’Italia passing through Tuscany in 2015.

The next day, over coffee and toast on the terrace, I felt the world was a 
kinder place. The sun was already taking the edge off the early morning chill 
and the views stretched over fields of olive trees and vines to billowy 
baize-coloured hills rolling away in the distance.

Nothing could dampen my enthusiasm for the day’s riding, not even when I 
logged on to the Giro’s official website and confirmed that the Chianti 
Classico stage promised “a tough time trial … without a single flat section”. I 
preferred to focus on the bit extolling the “fabulous setting” and the “unique 
scenery”.

In the nearby village of Lecchi, which was still in the process of waking up, 
I picked up my hire bike fromIn Gamba <http://ingamba.pro/>, a cycle tour 
company run by former professional racer João Correia. I met my riding 
companion, Sean Caulfield, in Paolo’s cafe across the road. Sean is the owner 
of holiday letting companyTo Tuscany <https://www.to-tuscany.com/> and also 
rides for a team in the area, so the local roads are his training ground and he 
knows the best pitstops along the way.

We were going to add 40km to the stage, he said, heading out to the finish 
line in Greve and throwing in a loop to bring us back to the starting point in 
Radda.

I can’t tell you much about the first 20km of the ride except that it was 
mostly uphill and the only sound to be heard on the largely car-free road was 
my laboured breathing. In fact, if I tell you that we climbed a total of 2,000 
metres on our 84km journey, you’ll get the picture that it was a fairly testing 
ride. But you’ll only get part of the picture, because the scenery along the 
route was equally breathtaking. The most classical of Italian features rolled 
into view – lines of cypress trees standing sentry on drives leading to 
hillside estates and farms, symmetrical rows of vines racing down the slopes, 
small olive groves and huge swaths of oak forest, hilltop towers and jumbles of 
cobbled lanes and terracotta-tiled roofs.

It called to mind another passage from Dino Buzzati’s coverage of the 1949 
Giro: “Did the multicoloured mob of road cyclists know they were riding through 
one of the most beautiful regions in the world? Surely it was a crime, in a 
certain sense, to make use of such enchanting scenery for such unrewarding, 
bestial hard labour.”

And that’s where the restful heavens on our extraordinary outing in the 
country provided a wonderful physical tonic and much-needed sustenance. Just 
beyond the cobbled streets of the fortress town of Castellina, we stopped at 
the ice-cream parlourGelateria Castellina 
<https://www.facebook.com/Gelateria-di-Castellina-120288484664958/>. Simone and 
Chiara Municchi have been makinggelati and semifreddi in the town for 19 years, 
but recently moved to bigger premises in time for the Giro. Inside, the display 
cabinet was a psychedelic swirl of colour and artisanal flavours –frutti di 
bosco, pistacchio, stracciatella (with chocolate ripples), ricotta and fig.

In Panzano, we took full advantage of the generosity of celebrity master 
butcher Dario Cecchini, whoseAntica Macelleria Cecchini 
<http://www.dariocecchini.com/dariocecchini/en/> shop is always crowded because 
he lays out free plates of his signature fennel salami and creamy lardo 
(Chianti butter) infused with rosemary, along with chunks of crusty bread and 
carafes of wine on a long wooden table for all comers to taste. Meanwhile, he 
holds court behind a counter laden withbistecca alla fiorentina (T-bone steak), 
sausages and pork loins, wielding a fearsome cleaver and dressed in a white 
shirt and waistcoat in the colours of the Italian flag.

Did the multicoloured mob of road cyclists know they were riding through one 
of the most beautiful regions in the world?
Dino Buzzati 
In the arched loggias of the main piazza of Greve, we sampled the local salumi 
ofAntica Macelleria Falorni <http://www.falorni.it/#&panel1-1> but passed on 
the opportunity of Chianti Classico wines served by the glass in its enoteca. 
There was still another 40km of road to negotiate before we could settle down 
for a melt-in-the-mouth lunch of lasagne atLa Cantina Colle Bereto 
<http://www.collebereto.it/> in the square in Radda. After lunch, I dropped in 
at my landlord’sCasa Porciatti <http://www.casaporciatti.it/> wine bar, housed 
in a 14th-century building with a vaulted ceiling, to buy a couple of bottles 
of local wine, Poggerino and L’Erta di Radda.

 La Casanova 
All of the shops along the race route proudly displayed the poster for the 
Chianti Classico stage – the Gallo Nero sporting the pink jersey of the race 
leader – and signposts with the kilometre countdowns to the finish were already 
up in April. Large sections of the road were being dug up and resurfaced to 
smooth out any remaining potholes and ruts, to ease the riders’ passage. There 
was a sense of mounting excitement and anticipation of the massive cycling 
circus rolling into the region.

Tuscany is one of the heartlands of Italian cycling, along with Lombardy and 
Piedmont. It was the home of Gino Bartali, who raced in perhaps the most famous 
Giro of them all – against his arch-rival from Piedmont, Fausto Coppi. This was 
the race that Dino Buzzati covered for the Corriere della Sera in 1949.

That Giro was contested in an Italy still ravaged by the second world war, 
along roads that were either half-bombed out or little more than farm tracks 
snaking through the hills and mountains. Many of these white gravel tracks, or
strade bianche, still survive in Tuscany today, thanks largely to a retro 
cycling event called L’Eroica, which was started in 1997 in Gaiole in Chianti, 
by Giancarlo Brocci, who I met on the terrace of the resplendentCastello di 
Spaltenna <http://www.spaltenna.it/it/index.html> hotel in Gaiole.

 Andy on one of the white, gravelly lanes known asstrade bianche. 
“The idea of the event was to protect the strade bianche from being 
resurfaced, but also to rediscover the roots of the sport – away from 
technology and doping,” he told me. “You have to remember that after the second 
world war, Bartali and Coppi restored pride in the country.Cycling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling> was the number one sport in Italy. 
Not football. There was something heroic in their rivalry and their suffering.”

L’Eroica takes place every October, and last year added a spring edition. All 
cyclists have to ride steel-frame bikes made before 1987, and dress in suitable 
period costume – merino wool jerseys, leather shoes and cotton caps. The idea 
is to discover and enjoy the timeless scenery of Tuscany while cycling along 
quiet country lanes, but also to challenge yourself physically with the most 
basic tools of the sport. The longer routes, like the stages of the older Giro 
races, start when it’s still dark, but along the way there are lots of food 
stops supplying Tuscan staples like stew, salami, cakes and fruit along with 
gallons of Chianti wine.

It’s a hugely popular event that this year will draw in 7,000 riders from 
around the world, tripling the population of the usually quiet town of Gaiole 
over the course of a weekend, and pumps an estimated €3m-€4m into the local 
economy.

So successful has it been that L’Eroica has been taken up in seven other 
countries: South Africa, Japan, the US, Spain, the UK, the Netherlands and 
Uruguay.

“It’s about getting back to the joy and essence of cycling,” said Brocci. “And 
the beauty of fatigue – of tiring yourself out – is the essence of cycling.”

I rode a stretch of strada bianca on a vintage bicycle the following day, 
covering a loop of 33km. Even over such a short distance – and having nearly 
broken myself on the easiest section of the Giro the day before – I can relate 
to that sentiment.
