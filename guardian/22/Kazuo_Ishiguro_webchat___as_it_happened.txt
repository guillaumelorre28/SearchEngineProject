'I tend to write the same book over and over'

poppypoppy asks:

Hi Kazuo. I’m always impressed by how varied the subject matter of your 
writing is from novel to novel. What is it that inspires enough passion for you 
to fixate on characters and emphatically weave an entire story around them? Do 
you have to kind of become the characters or are they more shaped by your 
research?

To answer last part first: certainly for the first person narrators, I adopt a 
kind of method acting technique. Well, I don't go to extremes, becoming butlers 
or whatever. But I do feel I have to get to the point where I could, say, hold 
a fairly long conversation with my wife in the kitchen in the voice of the 
character. That way, I don't have to think line by line, 'how would s/he say 
this?'. Until I get to that point, I'm not comfortable starting the narration.

As for subject matter: well, let me tell you a dirty secret. My subject matter 
doesn't vary so much from book to book. Just the surface does. The settings, 
etc. I tend to write the same book over and over, or at least, I take the same 
subject I took last time out and refine it, or do a slightly different take on 
it. Example: Remains was essentially a repeat of the territory covered in 
Artist of the FW. But that latter book, when I came to the end of it, struck me 
as dealing with the theme of the wasted life only from the career perspective. 
It occurred to me there were other very good ways to waste your life - 
especially in the personal arena. So Remains was Artist Plus. Stevens wastes 
both his vocational life and his love life. I set it in England, not Japan, and 
everyone talked about a huge leap. But it was a re-make, or at least, a 
refinement of the earlier book.

'A lot of fine writers hit their peak aged 60'

Eglantine asks:

Is it ever too late in one’s life to begin seriously writing fiction? And how 
do you personally push past the self-doubt and silence the critical voices in 
your head so that you can get on with writing – if this is indeed a problem for 
you?

I don't think it's ever too late. In fact, a lot of fine writers hit their 
peak after 60 or so. Penelope Fitzgerald, maybe Cormac McCarthy, Philip Roth, 
etc. It doesn't even matter really if one doesn't produce world-shattering 
works. I think writing fiction is a good thing for almost anyone, at any point 
in one's life. I have been quoted saying that I believed novelists (not other 
kinds of writers) peaked somewhere between 35 and 45 - a little after 
footballers. Taken as a generalisation, that's probably true: just empirical 
observation suggests this, unfortunately. Most 'great' novels are written by 
people under 45, sometimes much younger. If you look through any literary 
encyclopaedia this tends to be borne out. However, that doesn't mean very good 
novels can't be written by people at any point in life. Countless examples for 
that.

As for self-doubt, etc. Well, I think we just have to have a sense of 
arrogance. Or maybe, we have to develop a very lonely sense of success and 
failure for each of us. Sometimes, I get praised for something, and I go away 
and think, well, I'm not convinced. And anyway, they're not praising me for 
what I wished to be praised for.

'My English vernacular can be pretty rocky'

Terry Smith asks:

Your first language must have been Japanese. Do you think the fact that your 
learnt English as a second language, though obviously when you were very young, 
has had an effect on your relationship with it? I am asking this question 
because, like many, I admire your prose style enormously.

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/46393460> 
I grew up in a house where English wasn't spoken. Even now, when I speak to my 
mother, we speak in Japanese. So although I grew up in Britain since the age of 
5, I don't have the same firm foundation, linguistically, as many of you out 
there. In fact, I'm pretty rocky, especially around vernacular and such. So I 
think this has led to a natural carefulness when writing prose. But I think 
that may be a good thing for me. I think in general, when people write fiction, 
they should be very very careful. In a way, my sense of wariness was a help to 
me in my early days as a fiction writer.

Also: in my early books, I was obliged to create the impression that the 
characters (even the narrator, in my second book) was speaking not in English, 
but in Japanese. But the book was somehow reaching the reader in English. So I 
had to create a kind of subtitles effect. I couldn't let loose with Japanese 
people going 'cor blimey' or 'what ho'. So I had to invent a kind of careful, 
'foreign' language. I think that's stayed with me to some extent. I've never 
been a particularly fluent kind of prose writer.

Deshni Naidoo asks:

Never Let Me Go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/26/bookerprize2005.bookerprize> has 
been one of the most deeply affecting novels I have ever read. The questions it 
raised about love, sex and what makes us human; whether that in fact is a soul 
and where that comes from, have always stayed with me and made me question just 
what “human” means. What led you to phrase those questions in the novel around 
art, or creativity? That this was perhaps where our souls reside, in our 
ability to create.

So pleased NLMG touched you so deeply. It's not really me believing that our 
souls may reside in our ability to create. That's more what certain characters 
in the novel believe - at least, they think for the purposes of campaigning on 
behalf of the clone kids, the general public would be more persuaded of them 
having souls if their creative work can be shown to bear witness to such a 
notion. The novel doesn't necessarily support that idea: My own feeling is that 
it's in the way these characters love and care for each other; the fact that 
when they realise their time's limited, they desperately want to reach out for 
each other, set right things they might have done to hurt one another - it's 
that kind of stuff that testifies to them having 'souls', if there was any 
doubt about it in the first place.

'There was a time when I'd have loved to take up film-making'

bobonline1981 asks:

Alex Garland wrote the screen play for Never Let Me Go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/10/never-let-me-go-review> after 
slowly shifting from novels (The Beach) to directing (Ex Machina). With some of 
your books being turned into films - do you harbour any desires to take a 
similar path and if not, why not?

There was a time when I'd have loved to take up film-making. But hanging 
around film sets, and getting to know film directors, has made me appreciate 
how enormously difficult it is to direct a film. In effect, you have to be a 
kind of CEO of a sprawling company under extreme stress and shifting 
conditions. I don't think I'm able to do that kind of stuff. Alex G is an 
enormously gifted guy. It's very rare that someone has the ability to write 
novels, and screenplays, and direct. The latter requires so many practical 
skills, and it requires getting up very early in the morning, and shouting at 
people.

As for my books being turned into films - in a way, that's the ideal for me. I 
can leave all the heavy-lifting of the film-making to someone else, and take 
credit for a good film, or disown a bad one angrily.

Sorry to hear you've had to go through such a difficult experience. While I 
wasn't trying necessarily to recreate such an experience in the novel as such, 
I did certainly have in mind a kind of metaphor for the general human condition 
- that we would, even if we were lucky, at some point have to lose control of 
various parts of our bodies and leave this life. It's a cruel kind of metaphor, 
I suppose - the idea of drawing a parallel between the natural ageing process 
and a savage regime that harvests young people's organs systematically. But in 
some ways, our experience of facing death is very cruel.

'I wrote my narrators up in the way I felt was authentic – human nature is 
unreliable'

BabyH asks: 

Many of your books depend on a self-deluding or otherwise unreliable narrator. 
What is it particularly that interests you in this device?

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/46391956> 
There are a few questions in this chat about unreliable narrators, and so this 
is in answer to some of the others as well. When I started out, I never really 
thought specifically about 'the unreliable narrator'. In fact, that term wasn't 
thrown around back then nearly as much as it is now. I just wrote my narrators 
up in the way I felt was authentic - the way I felt most people would go about 
telling a story about themselves. That's to say, any of us, when asked to give 
an account of ourselves over any important period of our lives, would tend to 
be 'unreliable'. That's just human nature. We tend to be 'unreliable' even to 
ourselves - maybe especially to ourselves. I didn't think of it as a literary 
technique. That's kind of how I think of my narrative voices now, today. I 
wouldn't want my narrators to be any more unreliable than the average person 
would be in a similar context.

I’m really excited and looking forward to reading The Buried Giant

 when my copy arrives. You’ve said once that one of your future challenges 
would be to write about how a whole society or nation remembers or forgets. Is 
this something that you’ve tried to do in The Buried Giant?

Yes, definitely. I spent many years thinking about things like France's way of 
facing up to (or not facing up to) the occupation years; the disintegration of 
the old Yugoslavia; Japan's memory of its role in WWII, etc. When is it better 
for a country to remember accurately? When does a nation need to forget just in 
order to hold together and stop itself descending into violence and civil war? 
But in The BG I'm also interested in how this question applies to a marriage - 
or any long-term relationship. Shared memories are crucial to a relationship. 
But the same questions apply here. When is it better for a couple to forget and 
move on? When should they explore the dark corners of their past together and 
face these things? Anyway, you can see what you make of the new book when you 
read it.

Who knows? Every reader's so different, coming from so many different 
directions, wanting so many different things. Remains of the Day and Never Let 
Me Go are certainly reckoned to be two of my most accessible books. But I think 
it's best to go to a bookshop, look at the covers, read the stuff on the back, 
and decide what takes your fancy on that day, at that time.

The Unconsoled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/06/january-reading-group-the-unconsoled-kazuo-ishiguro>
 is also my first experience of your writing, and at just over 200 pages in I’m 
wondering why I ever left it so long to investigate your books. Needless to 
say, the book has prompted much debate in our Reading Group, but a common theme 
seems to be that the book is a meditation on stress and memory.

Personally I see the book more about guilt and artistic success, and 
particularly the guilt that the artist feels towards neglecting his family in 
the name of his craft (hence Boris being forgotten in the cafe for hours on end 
and so on) - is there an element of this in the book, or am I reading too much 
of myself into it? (Having two young children of my own, the predominant theme 
in my life seems to be guilt at either not spending time with them due to work, 
or not being a good enough role model when I am with them). I read an old 
interview of yours the other day where you mentioned how having children 
changed you, and so I was just wondering how much of this feeling impacted on 
the book - there are certainly moments like this that strike me as incredibly 
poignant...

I think it's fair to say the book is fuelled by stress and by guilt - the both 
of them. Not just parents' sense of guilt towards their children, but the 
child's sense of guilt and responsibility for things going wrong in the 
parents' world. I think there's quite a lot there too about people trying their 
utmost to fulfil other people's ideas of what they should be - other people 
they love - and the tragic strain that puts on them.

'Electricians are usually good guys in my books'

MythicalMagpie  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4034427> asks: 

There appears to be several different ways of interpreting the ending of The 
Unconsoled, probably deliberately so. So I’d like to askKazuo Ishiguro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/kazuoishiguro> not who the electrician on 
the tram is, but who he would like him to be.

Look, I have to be honest. It's over twenty years since I wrote this book, and 
I haven't quite finished re-reading it. I can't quite remember about this 
electrician. I'll have to look at it. Electricians are usually good guys in my 
work. That much I do know. It's typical of Guardian readers to ask so many 
questions about theending, even though I've managed to re-read 95% of it!!

nightjar12 asks:

I enjoyed The Unconsoled so much that I didn’t want to reach the end but, when 
I got there, the final scene turned out to be one of my my favourites. It made 
me want to laugh, smile affectionately and cry all at the same time. Readers 
seem to interpret it in many different ways though. Did you mean it to be 
ambiguous or was there a particular message you wanted to convey?

The endings to my novels often go for a kind of sad courage. (I think my new 
one - The Buried Giant - ends on a note like this too. I must try and break 
this pattern at some point.) The situation may well be pretty hopeless, but the 
protagonist makes a huge desperate effort to be optimistic, against all the 
odds. I admire that in people. Their ability to find a bit of courage, a bit of 
optimism, a bit of humour and spirit in the face of overwhelming knowledge that 
it's all hopeless, everything one cared for is lost...

By the way, that ending on the tram turns up in musical form as the title 
track of Stacey Kent's 2007 Blue Note album 'Breakfast On The Morning Tram'. I 
co-wrote the song with Jim Tomlinson, and it's consciously a recreation of the 
ending to The Unconsoled. You could call it 'The Consolations of Breakfast' or 
something like that. I liked the idea of it happening on a tram going round and 
round the city on a circular track. I liked the kindness of strangers, and the 
overwhelming comfort of breakfast food and coffee.

theorbys asks: 

1) Is Unconsoled a novel about doubles, like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The 
Double, William Wilson, are? If so what were you thinking of this inner double 
as? e.g. Hyde was the Id, William Wilson a moral consciousness. It seemed to me 
you did something astonishing with Ryder. His second temporary personality 
which sprang into being when he got to the Town seemed like a fictional 
correlate of the second ‘personality’ any reader develops on opening a book and 
starting to read, a reading self so to speak. Ryder, the Town, and the Ryder’s 
inner double seemed to be all three fictional correlates of the Reader, the 
Book, and OUR double, (a temporary task specific double), that is our reading 
self: an inner self that willingly suspends disbelief, identifies itself with 
the novel’s characters, and which disappears when we close the book (but ready 
for a new experience the next time we open one). Did you intend to create a 
double who was the fictional correlate of the reading self?

2) Are you a Philip K Dick fan? I think if Unconsoled has a clear message it 
is about the unhappiness and destructive power of love without empathy. 
Brodsky’s desire for an animal, reminded me of Philip K Dick’s story Do 
Android’s Dream of Electric Sheep, which is also about empathy, and in its own 
way (as are other Dick stories) about dissociated personalities like the one 
Ryder seems to develop when he gets to the Town.

3) Did you think of the story of Ryder, Sophie, and Boris as a novel within 
the novel? Both ‘novels’, like Ryder’s two personae, intercommunicating, which 
in turn requires the oniric background of the novel.

I don't think doubles. It's more like the way, once again in a dream, people 
who are of relative unimportance to you can inhabit your vision, looking like 
the shopkeeper you saw earlier in the day, the person you struck up a 
conversation with on the train, etc, but actually, they're standing in for much 
more significant people - an ex-spouse, your father, etc. Many of the 
characters in the book 'double' in that sense, rather than in the Dostoyevskian 
sense. And yes, many of these characters are aspects of Ryder himself: versions 
- sometimes loose versions - of himself as a child, himself projected forward 
in his fears; others are versions or variants of his mother, father, wife, son, 
etc. It's another way of telling a story about a particular character. A 
variation on the David Copperfield 'biography' way, or the looking back with 
flashbacks to key moments way often used in many novels (including many of my 
other novels eg Remains of the Day, NLMG and others).

Incidentally, if you're interested in doubles, you might have a look at a 
Patrice Leconte movie called L'Homme du Train, which is a good example of the 
anti-double in a story. I find anti-doubles more interesting than doubles at 
the moment. In the movie two strangers become friends because each represents 
to the other the life they didn't have, the life they missed out on, and now 
they sense is too late to have. (Both men - one played rather well by Johnny 
Hallyday the singer - know they're likely to meet their deaths in the coming 
few days, and can only wistfully flirt with the identity represented by the 
other - Johnny is a bank robber and womanizer, Jean Rochefort is a provincial 
retired schoolteacher. Anti-doubles are fascinating and make for poignant 
relationships.

I've never read a Philip K Dick book, though I know that the movie Blade 
Runner is based on this one you mention. But I think your comment about 
'unhappiness and destructive power of love without empathy' is rather good. 
It's very interesting and rather well put.

'I used a guide of World Cup football teams to pick character names for The 
Unconsoled'

River12 asks:

A reader inevitably creates pictures in his or her mind based upon the 
descriptions and atmosphere within the novel. When I read ‘The Unconsoled’, I 
mainly pictured Prague. Did you have any one particular city in mind when you 
created your city, or were you inspired by elements of several different ones, 
and if so which?

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/46390451> 
Didn't have any city in mind. I would have been afraid of Prague, if only 
because I was always nervous about the Kafka comparison. It was a kind of 
generic European city, and it was quite a late decision to give the characters, 
streets, etc, German names. I had to come down somewhere, location-wise. But it 
wasn't a starting point. I had my city and community in my head, then I gave 
them German-sounding names. In the earlier drafts, they were often just dashes 
- no names at all, because I couldn't think of authentic German-sounding names 
off the cuff, whether for people or districts or whatever. I later went back 
and filled them in. Actually, I used extensively a guide to the World Cup 
(soccer) I had nearby. I looked up the line-ups for the West Germany teams and 
used those names. If I had to mention in passing a chemist or the name of a 
museum, I'd look up a West Germany team line-up and choose a name. I avoided 
Beckenbauer, but I think I got through just about everyone else. When I ran 
out, I opened a film encyclopaedia and starting looking at the cast and crew of 
German films. So a lot of people, particularly towards the back half of the 
book, have names from the cast and crew of The Blue Angel. The city grew up in 
my head. I wouldn't want to go there for my weekend break.

Baby H asks: 

I loved The Unconsoled, and when reading it I assumed it was an account of a 
dream. I have however read a comment from the author denying this was his 
intention. Really? It still reads to me like a dream, so if it isn’t, just what 
is it?

Glad you loved it. Not everyone does. I've just been reading it over the 
weekend in preparation for this webchat - and I'm not sure I always loved it 
all of the time! But about this dream business. I don't think I ever thought of 
it literally as a dream. It was more that I was telling a story, set in a 
particular kind of world a little removed from the one you and I normally live 
in, and I decided to borrow from the world of the dreaming mind. It was more 
like thinking, well, if the Dreaming Mind was a famous author, and I was 
allowed to plagiarize many of his/her signature stylistic quirks, what would 
they be? Which ones would I most want to nick? So yes, a lot of what happens is 
dream-like, and I did refer to my own dreams in working out how to do things. 
Not thecontent of the dreams, just the method by which my dreams went about 
unfolding a narrative, etc. The Unconsoled isn't about dreams. It just borrows 
a lot of the techniques and stylistic traits from the average dreaming mind. 
Far too many to list here, but you know what I mean. Old schoolfriends turning 
up out of context, with little sense of surprise. Being able to 'remember' or 
'realize' a huge hunk of someone's backstory when you've run into them for the 
first time. The backward projection of intentions. Odd ability to witness 
things happening outside of one's normal field of vision, etc, etc.

theorbys asks: 

Why is there so much relentless cruelty and humiliation in The Unconsoled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/13/kazuo-ishiguro-the-unconsoled-questions>
, and such hilarity aimed at its victims? For example the utter humiliation of 
the town poet was bad enough but was only a warm up for Brodsky’s. But there 
are lots of other examples.

Not sure I agree there's relentless cruelty, etc. The conceit in the book is 
that a community's musical values are crucial to its well-being. If they get 
their musical priorities wrong, it will lead to inevitable decline and misery; 
conversely, getting them right will lead to regeneration and happiness. e.g. 
the guy called Christoff - he's the cellist who came to the town some years 
before, and became their 'guru': now that decline has set in, the community is 
turning on him in much the way people might, in our world, turn on a 
political/religious leader they once believed in, who they now blame for all 
their woes. The bitterness shown to Christoff is of the same ilk - and 
proportion - as we show to such figures who we feel have misled/betrayed our 
trust. The town poet you mention, I think, is the guy who does a turn at the 
concert at the end of the book. He's a minor figure, but I guess he just gets 
caught up in the high stakes emotion of the town, as does poor Brodsky.

Those who are reading The Unconsoled along with this month’s Reading group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/06/january-reading-group-the-unconsoled-kazuo-ishiguro>
 will know just how many questions even one of these books can provoke – and 
just how much there is to discuss. You might also be interested to know that as 
well as novels and stories Ishiguro co-wrote four songs on Stacey Kent’s 2007 
jazz album, Breakfast on the Morning Tram and three more on her 2013 album The 
Changing Lights. He won The Booker prize for the Remains Of The Day in 1989,

especially for reading my books over the years. Yes, do drop in for The Buried 
Giant, which comes out start of March. If you think it's a disaster, let me

poppypoppy asks:

Hi Kazuo. I’m always impressed by how varied the subject matter of your 
writing is from novel to novel. What is it that inspires enough passion for you 
to fixate on characters and emphatically weave an entire story around them? Do 
you have to kind of become the characters or are they more shaped by your 
research?

To answer last part first: certainly for the first person narrators, I adopt a 
kind of method acting technique. Well, I don't go to extremes, becoming butlers 
or whatever. But I do feel I have to get to the point where I could, say, hold 
a fairly long conversation with my wife in the kitchen in the voice of the 
character. That way, I don't have to think line by line, 'how would s/he say 
this?'. Until I get to that point, I'm not comfortable starting the narration.

As for subject matter: well, let me tell you a dirty secret. My subject matter 
doesn't vary so much from book to book. Just the surface does. The settings, 
etc. I tend to write the same book over and over, or at least, I take the same 
subject I took last time out and refine it, or do a slightly different take on 
it. Example: Remains was essentially a repeat of the territory covered in 
Artist of the FW. But that latter book, when I came to the end of it, struck me 
as dealing with the theme of the wasted life only from the career perspective. 
It occurred to me there were other very good ways to waste your life - 
especially in the personal arena. So Remains was Artist Plus. Stevens wastes 
both his vocational life and his love life. I set it in England, not Japan, and 
everyone talked about a huge leap. But it was a re-make, or at least, a 
refinement of the earlier book.
 
Eglantine asks:

Is it ever too late in one’s life to begin seriously writing fiction? And how 
do you personally push past the self-doubt and silence the critical voices in 
your head so that you can get on with writing – if this is indeed a problem for 
you?

I don't think it's ever too late. In fact, a lot of fine writers hit their 
peak after 60 or so. Penelope Fitzgerald, maybe Cormac McCarthy, Philip Roth, 
etc. It doesn't even matter really if one doesn't produce world-shattering 
works. I think writing fiction is a good thing for almost anyone, at any point 
in one's life. I have been quoted saying that I believed novelists (not other 
kinds of writers) peaked somewhere between 35 and 45 - a little after 
footballers. Taken as a generalisation, that's probably true: just empirical 
observation suggests this, unfortunately. Most 'great' novels are written by 
people under 45, sometimes much younger. If you look through any literary 
encyclopaedia this tends to be borne out. However, that doesn't mean very good 
novels can't be written by people at any point in life. Countless examples for 
that.

As for self-doubt, etc. Well, I think we just have to have a sense of 
arrogance. Or maybe, we have to develop a very lonely sense of success and 
failure for each of us. Sometimes, I get praised for something, and I go away 
and think, well, I'm not convinced. And anyway, they're not praising me for 
what I wished to be praised for.
 
Terry Smith asks:

Your first language must have been Japanese. Do you think the fact that your 
learnt English as a second language, though obviously when you were very young, 
has had an effect on your relationship with it? I am asking this question 
because, like many, I admire your prose style enormously.

I grew up in a house where English wasn't spoken. Even now, when I speak to my 
mother, we speak in Japanese. So although I grew up in Britain since the age of 
5, I don't have the same firm foundation, linguistically, as many of you out 
there. In fact, I'm pretty rocky, especially around vernacular and such. So I 
think this has led to a natural carefulness when writing prose. But I think 
that may be a good thing for me. I think in general, when people write fiction, 
they should be very very careful. In a way, my sense of wariness was a help to 
me in my early days as a fiction writer.

Also: in my early books, I was obliged to create the impression that the 
characters (even the narrator, in my second book) was speaking not in English, 
but in Japanese. But the book was somehow reaching the reader in English. So I 
had to create a kind of subtitles effect. I couldn't let loose with Japanese 
people going 'cor blimey' or 'what ho'. So I had to invent a kind of careful, 
'foreign' language. I think that's stayed with me to some extent. I've never 
been a particularly fluent kind of prose writer.
 
Deshni Naidoo asks:

Never Let Me Go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/26/bookerprize2005.bookerprize> has 
been one of the most deeply affecting novels I have ever read. The questions it 
raised about love, sex and what makes us human; whether that in fact is a soul 
and where that comes from, have always stayed with me and made me question just 
what “human” means. What led you to phrase those questions in the novel around 
art, or creativity? That this was perhaps where our souls reside, in our

So pleased NLMG touched you so deeply. It's not really me believing that our 
souls may reside in our ability to create. That's more what certain characters 
in the novel believe - at least, they think for the purposes of campaigning on 
behalf of the clone kids, the general public would be more persuaded of them 
having souls if their creative work can be shown to bear witness to such a 
notion. The novel doesn't necessarily support that idea: My own feeling is that 
it's in the way these characters love and care for each other; the fact that 
when they realise their time's limited, they desperately want to reach out for 
each other, set right things they might have done to hurt one another - it's 
that kind of stuff that testifies to them having 'souls', if there was any 
doubt about it in the first place.

Alex Garland wrote the screen play for Never Let Me Go

There was a time when I'd have loved to take up film-making. But hanging 
around film sets, and getting to know film directors, has made me appreciate 
how enormously difficult it is to direct a film. In effect, you have to be a 
kind of CEO of a sprawling company under extreme stress and shifting 
conditions. I don't think I'm able to do that kind of stuff. Alex G is an 
enormously gifted guy. It's very rare that someone has the ability to write 
novels, and screenplays, and direct. The latter requires so many practical 
skills, and it requires getting up very early in the morning, and shouting at 
people.

As for my books being turned into films - in a way, that's the ideal for me. I 
can leave all the heavy-lifting of the film-making to someone else, and take 
credit for a good film, or disown a bad one angrily.

Sorry to hear you've had to go through such a difficult experience. While I 
wasn't trying necessarily to recreate such an experience in the novel as such, 
I did certainly have in mind a kind of metaphor for the general human condition 
- that we would, even if we were lucky, at some point have to lose control of 
various parts of our bodies and leave this life. It's a cruel kind of metaphor, 
I suppose - the idea of drawing a parallel between the natural ageing process 
and a savage regime that harvests young people's organs systematically. But in 
some ways, our experience of facing death is very cruel.

There are a few questions in this chat about unreliable narrators, and so this 
is in answer to some of the others as well. When I started out, I never really 
thought specifically about 'the unreliable narrator'. In fact, that term wasn't 
thrown around back then nearly as much as it is now. I just wrote my narrators 
up in the way I felt was authentic - the way I felt most people would go about 
telling a story about themselves. That's to say, any of us, when asked to give 
an account of ourselves over any important period of our lives, would tend to 
be 'unreliable'. That's just human nature. We tend to be 'unreliable' even to 
ourselves - maybe especially to ourselves. I didn't think of it as a literary 
technique. That's kind of how I think of my narrative voices now, today. I 
wouldn't want my narrators to be any more unreliable than the average person 
would be in a similar context.

Yes, definitely. I spent many years thinking about things like France's way of 
facing up to (or not facing up to) the occupation years; the disintegration of 
the old Yugoslavia; Japan's memory of its role in WWII, etc. When is it better 
for a country to remember accurately? When does a nation need to forget just in 
order to hold together and stop itself descending into violence and civil war? 
But in The BG I'm also interested in how this question applies to a marriage - 
or any long-term relationship. Shared memories are crucial to a relationship. 
But the same questions apply here. When is it better for a couple to forget and 
move on? When should they explore the dark corners of their past together and 
face these things? Anyway, you can see what you make of the new book when you 
read it.

it's best to go to a bookshop, look at the covers, read the stuff on the back,

judgeDAmNation asks: 

The Unconsoled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/06/january-reading-group-the-unconsoled-kazuo-ishiguro>
 is also my first experience of your writing, and at just over 200 pages in I’m 
wondering why I ever left it so long to investigate your books. Needless to 
say, the book has prompted much debate in our Reading Group, but a common theme 
seems to be that the book is a meditation on stress and memory.

Personally I see the book more about guilt and artistic success, and 
particularly the guilt that the artist feels towards neglecting his family in 
the name of his craft (hence Boris being forgotten in the cafe for hours on end 
and so on) - is there an element of this in the book, or am I reading too much 
of myself into it? (Having two young children of my own, the predominant theme 
in my life seems to be guilt at either not spending time with them due to work, 
or not being a good enough role model when I am with them). I read an old 
interview of yours the other day where you mentioned how having children 
changed you, and so I was just wondering how much of this feeling impacted on 
the book - there are certainly moments like this that strike me as incredibly 
poignant...

I think it's fair to say the book is fuelled by stress and by guilt - the both 
of them. Not just parents' sense of guilt towards their children, but the 
child's sense of guilt and responsibility for things going wrong in the 
parents' world. I think there's quite a lot there too about people trying their 
utmost to fulfil other people's ideas of what they should be - other people 
they love - and the tragic strain that puts on them.

seem to interpret it in many different ways though. Did you mean it to be 
ambiguous or was there a particular message you wanted to convey?

The endings to my novels often go for a kind of sad courage. (I think my new 
one - The Buried Giant - ends on a note like this too. I must try and break 
this pattern at some point.) The situation may well be pretty hopeless, but the 
protagonist makes a huge desperate effort to be optimistic, against all the 
odds. I admire that in people. Their ability to find a bit of courage, a bit of 
optimism, a bit of humour and spirit in the face of overwhelming knowledge that 
it's all hopeless, everything one cared for is lost...

By the way, that ending on the tram turns up in musical form as the title 
track of Stacey Kent's 2007 Blue Note album 'Breakfast On The Morning Tram'. I 
co-wrote the song with Jim Tomlinson, and it's consciously a recreation of the 
ending to The Unconsoled. You could call it 'The Consolations of Breakfast' or 
something like that. I liked the idea of it happening on a tram going round and 
round the city on a circular track. I liked the kindness of strangers, and the 
overwhelming comfort of breakfast food and coffee.
 
theorbys asks: 

1) Is Unconsoled a novel about doubles, like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The 
Double, William Wilson, are? If so what were you thinking of this inner double 
as? e.g. Hyde was the Id, William Wilson a moral consciousness. It seemed to me 
you did something astonishing with Ryder. His second temporary personality 
which sprang into being when he got to the Town seemed like a fictional 
correlate of the second ‘personality’ any reader develops on opening a book and 
starting to read, a reading self so to speak. Ryder, the Town, and the Ryder’s 
inner double seemed to be all three fictional correlates of the Reader, the 
Book, and OUR double, (a temporary task specific double), that is our reading 
self: an inner self that willingly suspends disbelief, identifies itself with 
the novel’s characters, and which disappears when we close the book (but ready 
for a new experience the next time we open one). Did you intend to create a 
double who was the fictional correlate of the reading self?

2) Are you a Philip K Dick fan? I think if Unconsoled has a clear message it 
is about the unhappiness and destructive power of love without empathy. 
Brodsky’s desire for an animal, reminded me of Philip K Dick’s story Do 
Android’s Dream of Electric Sheep, which is also about empathy, and in its own 
way (as are other Dick stories) about dissociated personalities like the one 
Ryder seems to develop when he gets to the Town.

3) Did you think of the story of Ryder, Sophie, and Boris as a novel within 
the novel? Both ‘novels’, like Ryder’s two personae, intercommunicating, which 
in turn requires the oniric background of the novel.

I don't think doubles. It's more like the way, once again in a dream, people 
who are of relative unimportance to you can inhabit your vision, looking like 
the shopkeeper you saw earlier in the day, the person you struck up a 
conversation with on the train, etc, but actually, they're standing in for much 
more significant people - an ex-spouse, your father, etc. Many of the 
characters in the book 'double' in that sense, rather than in the Dostoyevskian 
sense. And yes, many of these characters are aspects of Ryder himself: versions 
- sometimes loose versions - of himself as a child, himself projected forward 
in his fears; others are versions or variants of his mother, father, wife, son, 
etc. It's another way of telling a story about a particular character. A 
variation on the David Copperfield 'biography' way, or the looking back with 
flashbacks to key moments way often used in many novels (including many of my 
other novels eg Remains of the Day, NLMG and others).

Incidentally, if you're interested in doubles, you might have a look at a 
Patrice Leconte movie called L'Homme du Train, which is a good example of the 
anti-double in a story. I find anti-doubles more interesting than doubles at 
the moment. In the movie two strangers become friends because each represents 
to the other the life they didn't have, the life they missed out on, and now 
they sense is too late to have. (Both men - one played rather well by Johnny 
Hallyday the singer - know they're likely to meet their deaths in the coming 
few days, and can only wistfully flirt with the identity represented by the 
other - Johnny is a bank robber and womanizer, Jean Rochefort is a provincial 
retired schoolteacher. Anti-doubles are fascinating and make for poignant 
relationships.

I've never read a Philip K Dick book, though I know that the movie Blade 
Runner is based on this one you mention. But I think your comment about 
'unhappiness and destructive power of love without empathy' is rather good. 
It's very interesting and rather well put.

A reader inevitably creates pictures in his or her mind based upon the

Didn't have any city in mind. I would have been afraid of Prague, if only 
because I was always nervous about the Kafka comparison. It was a kind of 
generic European city, and it was quite a late decision to give the characters, 
streets, etc, German names. I had to come down somewhere, location-wise. But it 
wasn't a starting point. I had my city and community in my head, then I gave 
them German-sounding names. In the earlier drafts, they were often just dashes 
- no names at all, because I couldn't think of authentic German-sounding names 
off the cuff, whether for people or districts or whatever. I later went back 
and filled them in. Actually, I used extensively a guide to the World Cup 
(soccer) I had nearby. I looked up the line-ups for the West Germany teams and 
used those names. If I had to mention in passing a chemist or the name of a 
museum, I'd look up a West Germany team line-up and choose a name. I avoided 
Beckenbauer, but I think I got through just about everyone else. When I ran 
out, I opened a film encyclopaedia and starting looking at the cast and crew of 
German films. So a lot of people, particularly towards the back half of the 
book, have names from the cast and crew of The Blue Angel. The city grew up in 
my head. I wouldn't want to go there for my weekend break.

Glad you loved it. Not everyone does. I've just been reading it over the 
weekend in preparation for this webchat - and I'm not sure I always loved it 
all of the time! But about this dream business. I don't think I ever thought of 
it literally as a dream. It was more that I was telling a story, set in a 
particular kind of world a little removed from the one you and I normally live 
in, and I decided to borrow from the world of the dreaming mind. It was more 
like thinking, well, if the Dreaming Mind was a famous author, and I was 
allowed to plagiarize many of his/her signature stylistic quirks, what would 
they be? Which ones would I most want to nick? So yes, a lot of what happens is 
dream-like, and I did refer to my own dreams in working out how to do things. 
Not thecontent of the dreams, just the method by which my dreams went about 
unfolding a narrative, etc. The Unconsoled isn't about dreams. It just borrows 
a lot of the techniques and stylistic traits from the average dreaming mind. 
Far too many to list here, but you know what I mean. Old schoolfriends turning 
up out of context, with little sense of surprise. Being able to 'remember' or 
'realize' a huge hunk of someone's backstory when you've run into them for the 
first time. The backward projection of intentions. Odd ability to witness 
things happening outside of one's normal field of vision, etc, etc.

Why is there so much relentless cruelty and humiliation in The Unconsoled

Not sure I agree there's relentless cruelty, etc. The conceit in the book is 
that a community's musical values are crucial to its well-being. If they get 
their musical priorities wrong, it will lead to inevitable decline and misery; 
conversely, getting them right will lead to regeneration and happiness. e.g. 
the guy called Christoff - he's the cellist who came to the town some years 
before, and became their 'guru': now that decline has set in, the community is 
turning on him in much the way people might, in our world, turn on a 
political/religious leader they once believed in, who they now blame for all 
their woes. The bitterness shown to Christoff is of the same ilk - and 
proportion - as we show to such figures who we feel have misled/betrayed our 
trust. The town poet you mention, I think, is the guy who does a turn at the 
concert at the end of the book. He's a minor figure, but I guess he just gets 
caught up in the high stakes emotion of the town, as does poor Brodsky.
