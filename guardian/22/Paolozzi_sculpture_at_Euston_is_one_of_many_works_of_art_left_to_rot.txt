We are concerned that no one is taking responsibility for Sir Eduardo 
Paolozzi’s abstract head Piscator at Euston station in London (Valuable 
sculpture left to rot because no one wants to claim it

, 29 November). This is part of a familiar story. Historic England is 
campaigning to save postwar public art and has warned that some of this art, 
created by some of the most important artists of the 20th century, is 
disappearing. We have revealed that a growing number of sculptures, 
architectural friezes and murals – made after the second world war for the 
public to enjoy – are not being cared for. Many have been destroyed, sold, lost 
or stolen.

Historic England has been assessing postwar sculpture across England to build 
a better picture of the best examples of late 20th century sculptural art 
works. We can certainly explore the listing of Piscator. Listing identifies 
England’s most special and important buildings and structures. However, it is 
not an automatic solution for ensuring long-term maintenance and upkeep – this 
is ultimately the responsibility of owners who serve as guardians of our 
national heritage. This would also help inform the change about to happen at 
Euston station.
