Let’s get straight to the point here, because this is huge news. Barbie has a 
bum, and thighs that meet in the middle. The doll whose name has become a 
byword for unrealistic body ideals now comes normal-sized.


Barbie finally becomes a real girl – with more realistic figure and skin 
colours

Barbie has released three new Barbie body shapes: tall, curvy and petite. Tall 
is, well, taller than the original, and appears to have broader shoulders. 
Petite is basically Cheryl Tweedy-Cole-Fernandez-Versini-whatever-she’s-called. 
But it’s all about Curvy.


Curvy Barbie is still slim. She has a flat tummy and slender arms and her eyes 
seem to be wider than her ankles. But her plastic legs have a bit of meat on 
them, and she’s got a bit of a soft Gigi Hadid thing going on around the 
jawline.

After a survey on the fashion desk, we have decided that we particularly like 
the vibe of Everyday Chic Curvy Barbie, who has boldly teamed distressed 
cropped jeans with lace-up black brogues. We’re not wild about her loveheart 
necklace or plastic handbag, but then we’re not eight years old, so what do we 
know? Second place goes to So Sporty Barbie, a kind of Rihanna-lite in
Balmain-ish mesh vest dress 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2016-ready-to-wear/balmain/slideshow/collection#48>
 and open-toe shoe boots. We also quite like the one in the tight yellow skirt 
and a T-shirt with horizontal pink stripes: we’re calling her Generic Young 
Woman on Social Media Barbie.


The full range now has four body shapes, seven skin tones, 24 hairstyles, 22 
eye colours – who knew there even were 22 eye colours? – and feet that can wear 
trainers as well as high heels. What next: Barbie with flat hair?
