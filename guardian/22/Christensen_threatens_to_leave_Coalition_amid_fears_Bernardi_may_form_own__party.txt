The chief Nationals whip, George Christensen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/george-christensen>, has issued a 
threat to leave the Coalition “tent” if the Turnbull government is not more 
loyal to its voters, amid growing concern the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi is 
preparing to split as well.

The former prime minister, Tony Abbott, has weighed in to the controversy, 
calling for a “strong and united” Liberal party but warning it must not take 
its base for granted.

Concerns from conservative MPs that the Coalition is not doing enough to 
represent their constituencies’ concerns have grown since moderate Liberal 
Malcolm Turnbull narrowly won the July election and the nationalist One Nation 
party won four Senate seats andcontinued to build support in polls

.

In July Bernardi formed a grassroots Australian Conservatives movement

 purportedly to “make the Liberal party stronger” but his Coalition colleagues 
are increasingly concerned he intends to form his own party.

Returning from New York buoyed by the election of Donald Trump, Bernardi said 
in late November he realised “I have to be a part of that change, perhaps even 
in some way a catalyst for it”.

The Australian Conservatives website trumpets 
<http://www.conservatives.org.au/monday_19th_december_2016> that 60,000 
Australians have signed up for its mailing list “despite the fact we have been 
operating with modest staff numbers and a bare bones website up to this point”.

It says “this is all set to change in 2017” and promises the movement is set 
for a “massive 2017”.

On Thursday, in a Facebook post, Christensen noted survey data that 
satisfaction in democracy is at an all-time low in Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/20/trump-style-political-disaffection-taking-hold-in-australia-review-says>
 and expressed hope 2017 would “herald a new way of doing things for the 
Turnbull government and for politics in general”.

“A lot of people have told me to pull the pin on the government and go with 
another entity,” he wrote. “However, I am loyal to Barnaby Joyce, loyal to the 
Nationals and, most of all, loyal to local LiberalNational party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party> members who 
selected me to be their candidate.”

But Christensen then warned the Turnbull government needed to “start being 
more loyal to the voters and the party members who sent us here or there will 
come a time when remaining inside the tent is no longer tenable to my 
conscience or my voters”.

Before the July election Christensen threatened to leave the LNP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/18/george-christensen-predicts-coalition-will-axe-backpacker-tax-after-threats-to-quit-lnp>
 because of the government’s planned 32.5% backpacker tax but was satisfied 
with the compromise of 15% struck in December.

In a series of tweets Abbott said Bernardi had been right in July 2016 when he 
ruled out leaving the Liberal party, that “it’s best for the Australian people 
to have a strong, cohesive and sound Liberal Party”.

@corybernardi <https://twitter.com/corybernardi> was right in July 2016: it's

But Abbott warned to stay strong and united “the Liberal party cannot take the 
base for granted and must convincingly argue for its values and principles”.
