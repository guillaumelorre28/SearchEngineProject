Is Mark Zuckerberg seeking to become the Steve Jobs of grey T-shirts? That is 
to say, just asblack polonecks

 were a key part of Jobs’s brand, so grey marl has become visual shorthand for 
the Facebook CEO.

Zuckerberg has always claimed that his dedication to grey is simply an 
Obama-like strategy for minimising daily decisions

 (“I feel like I’m not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on things that 
are silly or frivolous

,” he has said).

In fashion we call this the “what this old thing?” defence.

Actually, this Vanity Fair cover is as grey, and as chic, as a Ralph Lauren 
campaign

. The T-shirt is the perfect shade of marl. The neckline has just the right 
slouch. And the greyscale is ramped up in the styling: smoky shades continue on 
the blackboard walls, behind him, and the slate floor beneath. It’s not quite 
50 shades, but there are at least three.

Like Jobs before him, this self-identified fashion refusenik knows a thing or 
two about branding – and he’s building his own through signature style.
