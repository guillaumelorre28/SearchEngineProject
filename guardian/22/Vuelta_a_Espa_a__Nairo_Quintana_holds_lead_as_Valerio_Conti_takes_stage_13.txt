Italian Valerio Conti eased to a commanding victory in stage 13 of the Vuelta 
a España <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/vuelta-a-espana>, the longest of 
the race, finishing 55 seconds clear of his closest challengers and over half 
an hour ahead of the peloton on Friday. Colombian Nairo Quintana retained the 
red jersey, maintaining his 54-second lead over Tour de France champion Chris 
Froome and his 65-second advantage over Spaniard Alejandro Valverde after the 
trio finished together in the peloton. The 23-year-old Conti raced clear of the 
five-man chasing pack with 19km left in the 213km stage from Bilbao to 
Urdax-Dantxarinea in the Basque country and never looked back, becoming the 
youngest rider to win a stage on this edition of the Vuelta. Danilo Wyss, 
Sergey Lagutin, Michael Gogl, Vegard Laengen and Yves Lampaert finished 
together behind the Italian, Wyss taking second and Lagutin third.

“We knew that the breakaway would go to the end because we had a huge 
advantage. We knew it would be difficult because the previous days have been 
taxing, but for me, it was the perfect day,” Conti told reporters.

“I felt really good, it was the right stage for me, it was the right 
breakaway, and when I attacked it was because I felt I was able to give 
everything.

“It’s my first victory in a Grand Tour and it’s a great feeling. This morning 
I felt perfect.”

Saturday’s stage is a 196km ride from Urdax-Dantxarinea to Aubisque-Gourette 
with a high-mountain summit finish.
