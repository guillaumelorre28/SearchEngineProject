The British Cycling president, Bob Howden, insists he is prevented from 
confirming what was in a package delivered toSir Bradley Wiggins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradleywiggins> five years ago due to the UK 
Anti-Doping investigation into the matter.

Wiggins announced his retirement on Wednesday  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/28/bradley-wiggins-announces-retirement-from-cycling>
but the contents of the package given to him at the end of a race in France in 
2011 are the subject of a Ukad investigation into alleged “wrongdoing”.

The Team Sky <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky> principal, Sir Dave 
Brailsford, told a department of culture, media and sport select committee last 
week that the package contained Fluimucil, an over-the-counter decongestant 
available relatively cheaply in France.

But that does not explain why the team went to such expense to have it 
personally delivered to Wiggins by the BritishCycling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling> coach Simon Cope. All parties deny 
wrongdoing.

Damian Collins MP, the chairman of the select committee, said in Thursday’s 
edition of the Times that evidence provided by British Cycling failed to 
confirm Brailsford’s explanation, adding that the “more we discover about the 
package, the more questions seem to be thrown up”.

But Howden told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that all the records that were 
required to prove the drug was just a decongestant, as claimed, have been 
supplied.

“Obviously it’s difficult to talk in detail about this because it’s the 
subject of an ongoing Ukad investigation,” Howden said. “What I can say is that 
the information that was requested at the Commons select committee has been 
forwarded to the chair of that committee [Damian Collins].

“What we’re obviously not able to comment on are the actual exact medical 
requirements that were in place, because they are issues between doctor and 
athlete and it’s a matter that Ukad are looking into.”

Responding to Collins’ concerns about the difficulty of getting precise 
records about what was in the package and why it was ordered, Howden said: “We 
forwarded the details around the transmittal of the package to the select 
committee.

“Ukad have the access to the records, they have the gateway, they have the 
keys to our medical room and all our records, so it would be for Ukad to 
confirm that, not British Cycling at this stage.”

Collins added to the uncertainty surrounding the contents of the package in 
his interview with the Times.

“We now know from Simon Cope’s expense claims that the request to take the 
package must have been made some time in advance, and that he travelled from 
southern England up to Manchester to collect it, and then went back [to 
southern England] to fly to France from London Gatwick,” Collins said.

“If this medicine was needed urgently it would have been much quicker to buy 
it in France. We also know from last week’s hearing that the medication was 
administered as soon as it was delivered. It also seems that British Cycling do 
not know categorically what was in the package.

“They say they understand it to be Fluimucil but do not explain why they 
understand that’s what it was. We need to be sure that British Cycling do keep 
proper records of what goes in and out of their medical stores.”

Wiggins brought the curtain down on one of the most remarkable careers in 
British sporting history when he posted a statement on his Instagram page on 
Wednesday, accompanying a picture of his collected race jerseys, medals and 
trophies.

He bows out as the owner of eight Olympic medals – a national record that 
includes five golds – and became the first Briton to win the Tour de France in 
2012.
