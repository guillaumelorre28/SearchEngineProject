Here’s the problem with feminism: it makes the holidays very hard. 
Particularly when it comes to gift-giving. Of course, most women are content 
with something pink and expensive under the Christmas tree. But what about 
those feminists who demand presents that don’t prop up the patriarchy, gifts 
that don’t give in to gender stereotypes, trinkets that don’t trade in 
transmisogyny and objects that don’t objectify? It’s a minefield, basically – 
and one you should tread carefully. Everyone knows feminists don’t have a sense 
of humour.

 Thankfully, there are already numerous gift guides tailored to the feminist 
in your life – you know, as opposed to all those other women who are not 
interested in equal-gifting rights. According to these guides, 
feminist-friendly presents include aUterus Plush Figure

These are all bloody good suggestions, don’t get me wrong. Sometimes, however, 
a feminist just has more vagina charm necklaces than she knows what to do with. 
So I’ve helpfully put together a few more ideas to help you close the gift gap 
this December.

1. A nice broomstick

Definitions of feminism can differ so it’s worth quickly recapping what the 
f-word actually means. Pat Robertson, an American televangelist, might have 
said it best when he described feminism 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/26/us/robertson-letter-attacks-feminists.html> 
as a movement that “encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their 
children, practise witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians”. Now, I 
hate to make sweeping generalisations, but if you’re going to practise 
witchcraft, then you’re going to need a broomstick.

2. A witty slogan T-shirt

If you’re a feminist but don’t have a T-shirt proclaiming you’re a feminist, 
are you really a feminist? Probably not. Women have never had so much freedom 
to purchase hideous T-shirts that let the world know that they truly do buy 
into feminism. Withslogans  
<https://mic.com/articles/83053/39-shirts-feminists-won-t-feel-guilty-buying#.AdIqIiKAN>
such as “Girls just wanna have fun-damental human rights”; “Who needs gender 
roles when we can have pizza rolls?”; or “Ovaries before Brovaries”, you can 
show the world how important it is to have equal access to terrible puns.

3. A mallet

The bigger, the better. What, did you think the patriarchy was going to topple 
itself?

4. A pinky ring

If you like feminism, you should put a ring on it. More specifically, you 
should put a pinky ring on it. Fred+Far, an LA-based jewellery company, offers 
a “self-love pinky ring” billed as ananti-engagement ring 
<http://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/anti-engagement-ring-trend-pinky-independent-woman-self-love%20http://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/anti-engagement-ring-trend-pinky-independent-woman-self-love>
. “Woman,”the website says <https://fredandfar.com/pages/the-mission>, “reclaim 
yourself … choose power, choose fulfilment, choose choice … choose yourself.” 
If you think this sounds like some grade A bullshit rather than Serious 
Feminism™, I’d caution you not to be so cynical and have a little feminist 
faith. Buy a $325 (£256) pinky ring and equal rights will undoubtedly follow.

5. Some fancy makeup

Don’t let anyone tell you that makeup is a foundation of patriarchal 
oppression; makeup is war paint. Suffragettes suffered for our right to go to 
Sephora and we should celebrate this freedom, not debate it. In case you still 
need convincing that eyeliner won’t ruin your feminist credentials, may I 
remind you that the Nigerian writer and feminist role model,Chimamanda Ngozi 
Adichie <https://www.theguardian.com/books/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie>, is a 
beauty ambassador for Boots No. 7. In arecent interview 
<http://www.racked.com/2016/11/22/13714228/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-boots-beauty>
 regarding this role, Adichie says that she wanted to be “part of the message 
that women who like makeup also have important and serious things that they’re 
doing in their lives … it’s time to really stop that ridiculous idea that 
somehow if you’re a serious woman you can’t and should not care about how you 
look.” So there you go: makeup still maketh you a feminist. A(wo)men to that.

It may be the holidays but feminists need to stay awake.
