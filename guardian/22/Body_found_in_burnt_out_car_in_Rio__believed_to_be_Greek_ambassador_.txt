Brazilian police suspect a body discovered inside a charred vehicle in Rio de 
Janeiro is Greece’s ambassador to Brazil who went missing three days ago, it 
has been reported.

 A police spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment on the report 
by TV channel Globo.

Ambassador Kyriakos Amiridis, 59, was last seen on Monday evening leaving the 
home of friends of his Brazilian wife in a suburb of Rio’s metropolitan area, 
police had said earlier on Thursday. A state police official said the 
ambassador’s wife reported him as missing on Wednesday.

Globo showed images of the burnt-out white car in the Nova Iguaçu 
neighbourhood where the ambassador went missing. The station reported that the 
licence plates on the car matched those of Amiridis’s rental vehicle.

 An official at the Greek embassy in Brasília would not confirm the ambassador 
was missing, saying only that he was on vacation in Rio and expected to return 
to the capital on 9 January.

 Rio police inspector Evaristo Pontes had earlier told the Folha de São Paulo 
newspaper that he did not believe the ambassador was kidnapped. “We’re 
following some leads, but not that one,” he said. “If it had been [a 
kidnapping], those who took him would have made contact by now.”

 Amiridis previously served as Greece’s consul general in Rio from 2001 to 
2004. More recently he was Greece’s ambassador to Libya from 2012 until he took 
the top Brazil post at the beginning of 2016.

 Brazil’s foreign ministry said it had no comment on the case, other than to 
say it was being fully pursued by police, while Greece’s foreign ministry had 
no comment.
