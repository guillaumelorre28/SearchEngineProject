Cycling, for too long a neglected sport, is finally receiving the media 
attention it deserves. Congratulations to Chris Froome and all of the cyclists 
who have provided us with such fine entertainment over the past three weeks of 
theTour de France <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance>. Thanks also 
for the quality of reporting in the Guardian and other papers. And let’s not 
forget the contribution of ITV4 in providing us with the high-quality pictures 
of the race, architecture and the French countryside, including some whole 
stage coverage. But above all for the superb commentaries, interviews and 
opinions of its team of experts whose informed and interesting explanations 
made a mockery of overpaid, self-indulged TV football pundits.
