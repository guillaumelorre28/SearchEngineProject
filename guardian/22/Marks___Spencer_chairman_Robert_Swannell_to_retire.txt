The chairman of Marks & Spencer is to retire next year after six years in the 
role.

Robert Swannell, a former investment banker, has overseen a tricky time at the 
high street stalwart,appointing long-term staffer Steve Rowe to take over as 
chief executive

 a year ago from former boss Marc Bolland.

Swannell, 66, who was previously an adviser to M&S helping to fend off a bid 
attempt <https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jun/01/3>by the Topshop 
boss, Sir Philip Green, during his 30 years in banking at Schroders and 
Citigroup, joined the company’s board as a non-executive in late 2010. He 
became chairman a few months later, taking over from Sir Stuart Rose.

His departure is another step in the changing of the guard since Bolland 
stepped down in the spring.

Rowe has since pulled back on some of Bolland’s key initiatives, including 
international expansion.

Swannell said: “A year ago we chose Steve Rowe as our chief executive. Steve 
completed a thorough analysis of the business and developed a detailed plan to 
build a simpler and more relevant M&S.

“This plan is now under way and I feel that it is the right time for the 
business to look for a new chairman. It is a real privilege to chair this 
iconic company and I will continue to do so until my successor is in place.”

M&S’s senior independent director, Vindi Banga, will now lead the process to 
identify and appoint the next M&S chairman.
