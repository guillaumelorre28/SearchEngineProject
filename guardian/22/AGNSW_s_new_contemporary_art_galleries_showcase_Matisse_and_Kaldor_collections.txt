The Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW) has refurbished the floor of its 
modern and contemporary art collection to make room for five new exhibitions.

After the de-installation of Pop to popism - the gallery’s major summer 14/15 
exhibition - Dr Brand and the gallery’s head of international art Justin Paton 
had the opportunity to “start fresh”.

Dr Michael Brand, director of the AGNSW, says that the freshly curated spaces 
create new possibilities for the display and interpretation of contemporary art 
making, and reflect the importance of public institutions engaging with 
contemporary artists.

“The reinstallation marks a new era, it brings a new energy,” he said. “I’ve 
been with the gallery for three years now and this is the first chance we’ve 
had to heavily rethink this floor.

 “My feeling was when I got here was that there was great art on display - the 
Kaldor galleries for example – but they lacked a bit of focus, they meandered a 
bit. We thought by giving it more focus and opening new sightlines through the 
collection, we could make it a more engaging experience for viewers.”

The new installation continues this commitment. “It is important for 
Australian artists to see how their work stacks up against their peers,” Dr 
Brand says. “And it is important for international visitors who may recognise 
more works from elsewhere to see how these works relate to Australian art, 
which they might be less familiar with.

 “This is much more in keeping with the 21st century global experience of 
mixing art together from so many places. The great thing for Australian artists 
is that it’s giving them prominence amongst their peers.”

And how to define an Australian artist anyway?

“I would say one of the good things about mixing Australian and international 
art together is that it is becoming increasingly harder to actually draw those 
lines in the first place,” Dr Brand says.

“With everything so much more global and multicultural, how do you classify an 
artist? Do they hold an Australian passport? What if they weren’t born here but 
they went to art school here? What if they came here at 12? What if they lived 
here and worked here but are from elsewhere, what does that make them?”

He refers to Khadim Ali, an artist of Afghani background, born in Pakistan and 
now living in Sydney.

 “His works have been exhibited at the Guggenheim in New York, at Documenta in 
Germany. He lives in Sydney and has studio in art space at Wooloomooloo, so why 
would we want to choose between showing his works in either an ‘Australian’ or 
‘International’ gallery space.

 “Now that we have a newly configured space for contemporary art, I like that 
it’s much more of a continuum both in terms of artists and the themes of the 
exhibitions.”

The Art Gallery of New South Wales’s contemporary art collections are now open 
to the public. Entry is free.Exhibition dates vary so please refer to the
