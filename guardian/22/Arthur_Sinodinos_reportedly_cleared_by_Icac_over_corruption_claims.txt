NSW anti-corruption body Icac is reportedly dropping major allegations against 
cabinet secretaryArthur Sinodinos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/arthur-sinodinos>.

The frontbencher, reinstated when Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> took over the 
leadership last year, resigned as assistant treasurer under the Abbott 
government after his conduct came into question over donations to the Liberal 
party by Australian Water Holdings of which he was deputy chairman.

But NSW’s Independent Commission Against Corruption 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/independent-commission-against-corruption>
 has advised Sinodinos that no corruption findings have been made against him, 
the Australian newspaper reported on Thursday.

The body has also dropped a key allegation of fraud against Liberal lobbyist 
and former AWH boss Nick Di Girolamo, whose gift of a $3,000 bottle of wine to 
Barry O’Farrell led to the NSW premier’s resignation.

Di Girolamo still faces a second allegation of conspiracy to defraud however.
