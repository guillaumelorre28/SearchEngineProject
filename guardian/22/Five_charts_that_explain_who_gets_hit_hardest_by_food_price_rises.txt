Global food prices will remain stable for the year ahead, suggest recent UN 
forecasts <http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/417117/icode/>, but in the 
longer term we can expect much more volatility.


That’s because the food sector is unable to cope with a double whammy of 
rising demand for food and risks including water scarcity, land degradation and 
climate change, a recentanalysis 
<http://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/documents/ERISC_Phase2.pdf> [pdf] concludes.

In a twist of fate, the countries and people who will be worst affected will 
be the ones that tend to contribute least to such environmental risks. Here are 
five charts that help explain the story.
Food price index 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2016-06-14T21:11:44/embed.html>
Although food prices have fallen in recent years, the volatility in prices – 
as seen in the price spikes in 2007-08 and 2011 – will be repeated as the food 
industry is vulnerable to risks such as climate change and water scarcity, says 
the UN. Rising global population and incomes are expected to create a growing 
imbalance between supply and demand, it adds.
Ecological footprint 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-27T16:27:20/embed.html>
Wealthy countries such as Australia, the US and the UK tend to contribute most 
to the environmental risks that make food prices higher and more volatile, says 
the UN, as they consume the most natural resources (land, water, carbon 
emissions etc).

The ecological footprint 
<http://www.footprintnetwork.org/ecological_footprint_nations/ecological_per_capita.html>
 attempts to measure in hectares the natural resources a country requires on a 
per capita basis to produce all the food, water and non-food commodities it 
consumes, or absorb the waste it generates. Nepal, Madagascar and Benin all 
hover near the bottom, well below the level (1.7 hectares) necessary for us to 
live within the resources of the planet.

By contrast, Qatar, Australia and the US use more than four times the 
resources and waste that the planet can regenerate and absorb in the 
atmosphere. In the long term this means depleted groundwater, deforestation, 
collapsed fisheries and the accumulation of carbon dioxide emissions in the 
atmosphere.
Climate change vulnerability 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-27T16:23:23/embed.html>
The countries that have the lowest ecological footprint tend to be the most 
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea level rises and 
water scarcity. TheNotre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN) 
<http://index.gain.org/> measures a country’s exposure and capacity to adapt to 
climate change and gives each country a score. Benin, Mozambique and Nepal are 
all more than twice as vulnerable to the impacts of climate change as the UK or 
the US.

A failure to tackle problems including water scarcity, land degradation and 
climate change is making the food sector more vulnerable, says the recentUN 
analysis 
<http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=27074&ArticleID=36179>. 
The result, it says, is a higher risk of price shocks.
Loss of GDP from food price rises 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2016-06-14T20:52:01/embed.html>
A sudden surge in the price of food commodities such as wheat, maize and 
soybean will mean more income and higher GDP for major exporters like Australia 
and the US. But for major food importers like India, if there were another 
doubling in food prices as seen in 2007-08, it will mean a reduction in GDP of 
an estimated $50bn, according to the UN.
Loss of GDP from food price rises 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-27T16:40:04/embed.html>
Any rises in the price of food will have the biggest effects on those 
households spending the highest proportion of their income on food. On a global 
level that means countries such as Benin, Mozambique or Nepal.

If we look at the look at the gains and losses in proportion to a country’s 
total GDP, India sees a comparatively small loss. In contrast, Benin, 
Mozambique and Nepal will see a significant loss. Benin, for example, will see 
an estimated reduction in GDP of 9% if food prices double as they did in 
2007-08.
