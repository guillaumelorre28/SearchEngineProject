Edinburgh’s dirtiest trick is hiding in plain sight. Sold a 2D iteration of 
Braveheart, bagpipes and festivals, tourists cling to trademark attractions 
that have steep prices and no soul. When festival revellers swell the 
population in August, most of them head indoors, trading the capital’s spoils 
for darkened rooms. But there’s much to discover beyond the summer festivals 
and the shortbread Scottishness sold in the tourist traps.

Venture out from the Royal Mile and you’ll find weathered stones and tall 
spires punctuated with green giants. In an afternoon, you can conquer an 
ancient volcano or scale an abandoned acropolis without leaving the centre.

What to do in Edinburgh: readers’ travel tips

Edinburgh is a city of rises and falls. Her crags, wynds, vennels and vaults 
entice you up crooked steps with good reason. Get some height, and you’ll 
really see her. Medieval tenements clustering on a glacial tail. The geometric 
perfection of rational Georgian streets. A lick of blue where North Sea meets 
sky. Gilded by summer sun, this city sings, but she wears her storm clouds 
effortlessly. Brooding under a blackened sky with the malting sweetness of hops 
on the air, Edinburgh gets into your bones.

With the city’s rich history, it’s easy to lose yourself unearthing the past. 
But beyond the cobblestones, a modern city aches to tell its tale. This 
capital’s present is just as relevant, if you know where to look. Here you can 
go urban foraging with theEdinburgh Larder <http://www.edinburghlarder.co.uk/>, 
find afetish club in a cave <http://torturegarden.com/>, welcome May Day with 
fire <http://beltane.org/>, or sit in Scotland’s first cat cafe 
<http://maisondemoggy.com/> with a fat Persian called Guillaume. Edinburgh is 
losing its stiff upper lip, and embracing a world beyond bygone heroes and 
royal ties.

For a cultural fix, look no further than multi arts venue Summerhall. Housed 
in the former veterinary school, it has an eclectic, well-curated calendar of 
events all year round, including science lectures, challenging art exhibitions, 
and food festivals. It’s also home to the much-loved microbrewery Barney’s Beer.

Give the tartan souvenir shops a wide berth and head down to Armstrong’s 
vintage clothing emporium on the Grassmarket for the real deal: a heavy 
pre-loved woollen kilt could cost about £25. Given that a new one can cost £600 
or more, it’s a keepsake worth splashing out on (if the prospect of a previous 
bare-arsed Scottish owner doesn’t put you off). Other great vintage shops are
Those Were the Days <http://www.thosewerethedaysvintage.com/>, Herman Brown 
<http://hermanbrown.co.uk/> and Godiva <https://godivaboutique.co.uk/>.

 A Basil Bramble Sling from Edinburgh Gin Distillery 
The city is known more for its whisky heritage, but good gin is everywhere at 
the moment. Top of the list is the Edinburgh Gin Distillery, where passionate 
guides will lead groups of visitors on a connoisseur tour. Afterwards, design 
your own gin cocktail, or just enjoy their other wares – the elderflower gin 
liqueur is a show-stopper.

Porty is Edinburgh’s seaside. Only a few miles from the middle of the city, 
this seafront was once the go-to destination for Midlothian holidaymakers. Its 
Victorian splendour has long faded, but Portobello’s allure lies in that 
nostalgia. Walk the esplanade, play the penny arcades and eat fish and chips 
(with salt and sauce) by the sea. If the weather’s grim, enjoy the public 
Turkish baths <http://www.edinburghleisure.co.uk/activities/spa/turkish-baths> 
(£7.20) – one of only a handful left in the UK.

El Cartel

This pocket-sized Mexican cantina was an instant hit with locals, but closed 
after a serious fire within a few months of opening. A year on, it has risen 
triumphantly from sooty ruin, and this second coming has been worth the wait – 
for the best tacos in town and rotating flavours of frozen margarita. There are 
no reservations, so if there’s a queue, have a drink in the Bon Vivant pub over 
the road and they will give you a call when there’s a table. Standoutantojitos 
(snacks) are the duckcarnitas, fish tacos (£6.50) and guacamole national.

Aizle – say it like hazel – isn’t your by-the-book fine dining restaurant. 
There is no menu, just a list of the season’s exceptional local produce, so 
your dining is at the mercy of the chef’s whim – but it is as generous on the 
eye as it is on the palate. Recent highlights included stout bread with whipped 
duck butter and carrot salt, miso-cured hake, and prosecco with strawberry 
puree and dill.

Empires

Sandwiched between a couple of the city’s more lauded reataurants, this cosy, 
family-run Turkish bistro is easy to miss. Serving traditional meze and solid 
vegetarian options, it is frequented more by regulars than visitors. You can 
bring your own booze, so take advantage of the cheap corkage. Those in the know 
order the special meze platter (£15.95pp, single meze £3.95) and a glass of 
traditional apple tea.

If you’re looking for a nutritious meal, you won’t find it here. This tiny 
pastel emporium deals in two things only: chocolate and ice-cream. Sit at a 
Formica table, sipping hot chocolate, or spooning up freshly made gelato. With 
come-hither flavours like butter-fried bananas and creamy gorgonzola, this is a 
Wonka factory for pudding hunters – unabashed culinary hedonism.

The Holyrood 9A

Beer and burgers have always been friends. Through some witchcraft, the 
Holyrood has turned one of the city’s scarier dive bars into an elegant go-to 
for both. Its drinks selection is bountiful – for hoppy session ale go for 
Fyne’s Jarl, or Williams Blackball for a roasted, chocolatey stout. Wash down a 
venison burger (served with clava brie from the Summer Isles and mulled 
cranberry) with a pint of Marmalade on Rye IPA from Tempest Brewing.

If you didn’t know exactly where to look, you’d miss Bramble. Without signage, 
this nook-filled cocktail bar in a Queen Street basement feels private even 
when it’s busy. Expect Roots Manuva on the sound system, a tealight glow and 
not a mojito in sight. The Rheingold Express (Bols Genever, house cardamom and 
vanilla syrup, fresh lemon juice and crème de cacao) is worth the visit on its 
own.

Among Edinburgh’s growing family of Swedish bars, Joseph Pearce still reigns 
supreme. The shabby-chic sitting-room vibe, solid drinks menu and great food 
keep regulars returning. In true Scandinavian spirit, the outside tables don’t 
hibernate – in winter, it’s alfresco boozing under a borrowed blanket.

This fun and unusual cafe and cocktail bar in Leith’s vibrant shore area has a 
large selection of drinks displayed among teapots and ladies’ hats. Tunes are 
of the old-timey variety, and the two-dozen cocktails are served in china cups. 
Try the Scottish Skagen open sandwich (local smoked salmon, shrimp, dill and 
crème fraîche on toasted brioche) and a Rose Garden “pot-tail” (cocktail in a 
teapot) with apple, rose liqueur and cucumber.

WHERE TO STAY

Edinburgh is overrun with big hotels and grotty hostels, so it takes a bit of 
sleuthing to find something different …

Small in size but big on character, this little apartment offers hotel luxury 
with the privacy of an apartment. Other good stuff includes a four-poster, 
Molton Brown goodies and castle view.

Once the home of polar explorer Ernest Shackleton, this unpretentious 
independent hotel won’t dent your savings. Spanning five Victorian townhouses 
in bohemian Stockbridge, it has bedrooms full of character, an excellent bar, 
fine dining and toiletries from the White Company. It’s incredible value in one 
of Edinburgh’s most interesting neighbourhoods.

Traditional tenement

Edinburgh wouldn’t be Edinburgh without its tenements. These towering flats 
are a marker of days when it built up instead of out. Once overcrowded and 
unsafe, many of the oldest have vanished, though as the city expanded, newer, 
roomy tenements became the norm. With their high ceilings, bay windows, 
intricate cornicing and grand fireplaces, they’re synonymous with the city, and 
the closest you’ll get to genuine central living.

As city views go, little can top this studio’s panorama of Arthur’s Seat – 
where people look like matchsticks. Spend your nights in the bell tower of the 
former James Clark School, with 63 acres of Holyrood Park mere paces from the 
door.
