A season of Marilyn Monroe films at London’s BFI 
<https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=marilynmonroe>
 is a cinematic treat and the perfect excuse to dress up in homage to a proper 
screen siren. Throw in the reissue of 1961’s The Misfits – released nationwide 
on 12 June – and adding a bit of Marilyn to your look is even more relevant 
this month. Here are six things to wear when watching the star’s back 
catalogue. Blond curls and smouldering expression are optional.

A white shirt and jeans

In the classic scene from The Misfits 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGF0YhPSZg>, when Monroe wrestles with Clark 
Gable to save a horse, she doesn’t play up the fact that she is the only woman 
in a world of men by wearing a dress. Instead, her clothes are strikingly 
simple: a white shirt and a pair of jeans. This is Western dressing taken down 
to its basic elements, and it’s all the better for it.

A killer frock

Marilyn’s dresses are the stuff of style legend – from the pleated white one 
worn over the grate in The Seven Year Itch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/sep/15/marilyn-monroe-seven-year-itch-dress>
, to the sequinnedHappy Birthday Mr President 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqolSvoWNck> number, and the pink strapless 
gown (veryLanvin <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/lanvin>) worn in 
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGfC7GYi18>. What 
better reason to find your own showstopper? Accessorise with sparkles for the 
full Lorelei Lee look, or a white fur, if you’re serenading the leader of the 
free world.

A chunky sweater

Monroe in her downtime is a different kind of glamour, as when she was 
photographed, windswept and natural, on the beach by George Barris in 1962 –
wearing a wrap-around, slightly bobbly chunky sweater and a blanket over her 
knees 
<http://aylmerfineart.com/communities/8/004/011/907/438/images/4603032172.jpg>. 
Laid-back but chic, it’s seaside style, whatever the weather.

A fringed skirt

In Some Like It Hot, the sequin dress worn by Monroe as she performs I Wanna 
Be Loved By You <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDHlgnRuaM> steals the show 
(and preludes that Happy Birthday moment, as it happens). But, to bite her 
style in a slightly more IRL way, go for the fringed skirt she wears while 
singingRunning Wild <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5At3UCMQSiw> and strumming 
a banjo on a train carriage. It has all that va-va-voom allure but is wearable 
to the cinema, too. Bonus.

A great pair of specs

Monroe made all secret nerds happy during her turn in 1953’s How to Marry a 
Millionaire, the matchmaking comedy that put her alongside Lauren Bacall and 
Betty Grable: a holy trio of 1950s glamour if ever there was one. Monroe wears 
glasses – rhinestone cat’s-eye ones – when off duty and looks amazing.As a 
suitor in the film comments <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCNj4i16BU>, she 
is “quite a strudel”.

A stripy vest

Monroe’s career was documented by Eve Arnold 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/eve-arnold> – the Magnum photographer 
snapped her from the early 1950s onwards and captured images of her on the set 
of The Misfits, hanging out at home, and with her husband Arthur Miller. A 
classic is the image ofMonroe reading Ulysses while sitting on a merry-go-round 
<http://cdn.openculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/marilyn-reads-joyce-e1352357312199.jpeg>
. Joyce’s mind-bending modernist classic might not be everyone’s cup of tea, 
but a striped vest like the one Monroe is wearing is a definite takeaway.
