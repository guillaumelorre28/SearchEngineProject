Thousands of council tenants could face just weeks’ notice of rent hikes if 
new pay-to-stay rules are not confirmed soon, an eastLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> council has warned.

Under changes contained in the Housing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/housing> and Planning Act, tenants in 
social housing with household incomes of more than £40,000, and £31,000 outside 
the capital, will have to pay higher rents if they want to stay in their homes.

Research has suggested that 70,255 households in England and Wales will be 
affected

 and face average rent increases of £1,065 a year.

The increases are due to be introduced in April 2017, but the government has 
not set out the details of the change, or how the extra rent will be collected.


Labour-led Hackney <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/hackney> council said that 
this meant it would have just a few months to write to about 20,000 people 
living in its homes to ask what their income is, calculate increases based on 
that and give the affected residents notice of rent rises.

That could leave families facing little time to adjust household finances to 
pay any increase, the council said.


Under the government’s rules, if a tenant does not respond to a request for 
information about their income, councils may be forced to increase their rent 
to market level.

Hackney council said that the government should delay the implementation of 
the policy for a year to minimise the risk of errors that could leave families 
paying large increases they should not have to. It estimates it will spend 
£500,000 to set up and run the new system.

Philip Glanville, mayor of Hackney, said: “Not only is this tenant tax a 
damaging policy that will penalise low-paid working families, it is at risk of 
becoming a shambles as ministers rush to bring in these changes without any 
idea of how the system will work.


“That could leave council tenants already struggling to make ends meet facing 
a bureaucratic nightmare, and the threat of huge increases in their rent with 
just a few weeks’ notice.”


Under the plans, for every pound a household earns over £40,000, they will pay 
15p a year more in rent, up to a cap based on market rate.


Councils have warned that nearly one in 10 social tenants in London and the 
South-east can expect rent rises, with those living in the capital facing an 
average monthly rent rise of £132.

The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and 
Wales, has previously urged the government to rethink the policy.

It said councils needed to invest millions in new IT systems, hire new staff 
and write to more than 1 million social housing tenants to try and understand 
household income and approve individual tenant bills by January.

‘This will cause massive hardship’: social housing tenants on 'pay to stay'

Nick Forbes, LGA senior vice chair, said: “Pay-to-stay will affect thousands 
of social housing tenants across the country, with the average affected 
households seeing their rents rise by £1,065 a year.

 “For families, this will cause anxiety, uncertainty and costs. For councils 
it will generate bureaucracy and new administrative costs and complexities. And 
at the end of it, for government, it will generate nowhere near the financial 
return it had originally expected,” he said.

He added: “Pay-to-stay sounds straightforward but it is a policy with 
initially unseen complexities, and which could generate large numbers of costly 
legal appeals and challenges from tenants.”

A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: “It’s 
simply not fair that hardworking people are subsidising the lifestyles of those 
on higher-than-average incomes, including tens of thousands of households 
earning £50,000 or more.

 “Pay-to-stay better reflects tenants’ ability to pay, while those who 
genuinely need support continue to receive it. It means households in London 
earning £41,000 would see rents rise by just a couple of pounds a week.”
