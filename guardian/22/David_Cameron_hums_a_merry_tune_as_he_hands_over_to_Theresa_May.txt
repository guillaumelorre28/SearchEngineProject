British prime minister David Cameron was heard humming a tune as he walked 
back into No 10 on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/david-cameron-gets-ready-for-his-own-exit>
, minutes after announcing that he would resign as prime minister on Wednesday 
afternoon.

After singing to himself on the way to the door, he was heard saying “right” 
and removing the microphone that had recorded his private moment.

Some speculated that it sounded like the start of the West Wing theme, while 
ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, suggested that it was a Winnie the 
Pooh-style ditty.

heavily in Hampshire.

Classic FM, a British radio station, analysed the notes and declared they were 
“Beethoven-esque”.

Some on Twitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> saw Cameron’s 
relaxed demeanour as a sign he was pleased to be leaving Downing Street amid 
the chaos of the Brexit vote aftermath.

I'm guessing that this hum from David Cameron is 'I'm bloody glad this is all 
over. Over to you Theresa May'pic.twitter.com/evV7rwn1oc
