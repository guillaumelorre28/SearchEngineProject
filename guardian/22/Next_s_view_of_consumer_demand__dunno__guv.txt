Here is Next’s considered opinion on the current state of consumer demand, 
derived from a detailed analysis of its own trading in the past six weeks: 
“Dunno, guv, we only sell clothes and stuff.”

The chief executive, Lord Wolfson, didn’t put it like that, of course. Instead 
there wasa worthy discourse

 on the effect of weather (cold in March and April versus last year’s hot 
Easter) on recent weeks’ weak sales followed by a confession that the real 
problem may just be that consumers are spending less.

Amid the uncertainty, Next <https://www.theguardian.com/business/next> reckons 
its sales this year could fall by 3.5% but might rise by the same percentage. 
Put another way, pre-tax profits could decrease 8.9% to £748m or could improve 
3.7% to £852m.

The odd part is the market regarded this finger-in-the-air exercise as mildly 
reassuring – Next’s shares rose 5%. In a sense, though, it is. Widening the 
range of possible profit outcomes from £74m in March to £104m is unusual, but 
the key conclusion is surely that Next doesn’t expect to come apart at the 
seams, whatever happens. The low-end profit figure of £748m is hardly a 
disaster. Not all retailers could confidently claim to be so resilient, 
especially if it’s true that consumer confidence has turned down.

In the long term, Next faces the problem of combating competitors who seem to 
have learned and copied all its best online distribution and logistics tricks. 
An upgrade is required for the online and catalogue Directory business, as Next 
admits. The short-term headaches, though, seem more irritating than painful.
