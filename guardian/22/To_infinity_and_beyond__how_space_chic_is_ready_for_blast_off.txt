When Tim Peake’s spacesuit curtailed his spacewalk this month, because of 
fears that it might spring a leak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/15/astronaut-tim-peake-kopra-spacewalk-international-space-station>
, designers – the fashion, not the Nasa kind – were no doubt itching to have a 
go at making him a new one. Blame it on Peake or David Bowie’s Starman, but 
space – the final frontier – is on fashion’s radar once again.

Pierre Cardin and he recently-departedAndre Courreges

in the 60s (another moment when spaceflight was in the news, of course). 
Simons’s 2014 couture show for Dior melded astronauts with courtiers at the 
court of Marie Antoinette, and he later used Cardin’s space-bubbled south of 
France home as the venue for the 2016 Cruise show. Ghesquiere’s Louis Vuitton 
collections continue on the space theme –spring/summer

At the men’s shows in Milan last week, astronauts appeared almost as often on 
the catwalk as theinevitable Bowie tributes

.Versace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/18/menswear-spacemen-and-peake-chic-at-versace-in-milan>
 produced a show dedicated, as Donatella said, to the future. The mood – all 
shiny white plastic – felt very 2001 (thefilm 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8TABIFAN4o>, not the year), especially when 
the show began with models running around the darkened catwalk in bright 
fibre-optic outfits, like those training for a mission. When the lights went 
up, Versace’s idea of an astronaut was earthbound, slick and boardroom-ready, 
probably with important financial reports rather than space food in his 
backpack-cum-jetpack. He wore a silver mac, or chunky bright white trousers and 
matching biker jackets, a bit like the fashion version of Buzz Lightyear’s 
outfit. A cropped leather jacket with Versace’s version of Nasa badges was 
another highlight of haute astronaut style.

, meanwhile, went for metallic minimalism, an aesthetic that totally suits 
space, and even feels a bit like The Force Awakens. Perhaps it’s a stretch, but 
the opening outfit – a white denim jacket and matching jeans, with slight 
scratches – could be seen as a fashion nod to Finn and his Storm Trooper 
outfit, complete with a handprint of blood on his helmet. Away from tenuous 
links toStar Wars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/21/fashion-lessons-from-star-wars-the-force-awakens>
, there was definitely the influence of actual space. Puffa jackets and the 
insides of macs had the gold shiny finish of the multi-layered insulation foil 
used on space probes.

 The prototype of a Virgin Galactic flight suit, designed by Y-3. 
Both of these brands are no doubt envious of Y-3. The Adidas brand, overseen 
by Yohji Yamamoto, is getting to make real flight suits – or at least the 
prototypes for what Virgin Galactic’s customers forSpace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/space> Ship Two will be wearing in 2017 
when the ship is expected to take off. The clothes don’t look like the Michelin 
man spacesuits we are used to. Instead, they are slick and streamlined, a 
space-ready version of the minimal sportswear that Y-3 customers have become 
familiar with over the past decade. They come with Yamamoto’s motto in mind: 
“With one eye on the past I walk backwards into the future.” The future is 
bright, then – and it’s certainly in fashion.
