A travel company specialising in holidays to Greece has issued a call for 
donations for refugees in Greece. Sunvil, which sends 20,000 holidaymakers to 
Greece each summer, will fly the donations to Samos on its last charter flight 
on the season on 1 October.

The tour operator – and charter airline Germania – expects to fly three tonnes 
of aid to the island. Following consultation with the Red Cross and local 
refugee support groups, it has appealed for tents, sleeping bags, gym mats and 
warm jackets in all sizes.

Sunvil managing director Chris Wright said it had been moved to help after 
talking to its holiday reps in Greece. “They live there and can see that the 
need is going to get greater rather than diminish.”

Samos is one of several islands close to Turkey to have received thousands of 
refugees this summer.


Sunvil had already offered empty seats on the return charter flight, free of 
charge, to enable the government to bring refugees to the UK – an offer 
unlikely to be taken up.

• Donations should be sent, by 29 September, to: Samos Donations, Sunvil, 
Sunvil House, Old Isleworth, Middlesex, TW7 7BJ
