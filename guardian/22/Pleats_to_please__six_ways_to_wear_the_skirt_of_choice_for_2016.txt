Take note, iron-averse style watchers: pleated skirts are the only ones that 
pass fashion muster right now – they’re everywhere from the catwalk to the red 
carpet to your iPlayer catch-up session. Likedenim hair

<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/21/beginners-guide-to-facial-contouring-kim-kardashian>
, pleats’ popularity is partly down to the fact that they’re really photogenic. 
They might not be desk-job-friendly (those wrinkles from sitting down do tend 
to spoil a pleat’s line) but when snapped moving – as on a Vogue editor on the 
way to a fashion show – or wafting through a waltz, they have a pleasing 
three-dimensional quality that an A-line mini or pencil skirt just can’t claim. 
In this brave new world of skirts, the pleat semantics are a minefield. Here’s 
our guide to six pleats and what they mean in 2016.

Why Formation is Beyoncé’s most high-fashion moment ever

<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/08/beyonce-formation-video-fashion-gucci-catwalk>
Beyoncé showed her fashion mettle in the opening outfit of Formation – wearing 
a monogrammed knife pleated skirt and shirt by Gucci, a brand with the power to 
bring on palpitations in any even vaguely fashion-conscious woman. Starlets 
like Zendaya have since followed suite with the knife pleats, wearing them on 
the red carpet. As any hitmaker knows, when you have a chart-topper like this, 
you have to keep one-upping yourself. Gucci designer Alessandro Michele showed 
he was a master of the pleat in February, when he brought another version of 
the knife pleat into theGucci autumn/winter show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/24/guccis-glamorously-nerdish-aesthetic-returns-with-a-twist>
. If this all sounds like the difference betweenBlue Steel and Magnum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/11/the-myth-and-the-reality-the-fashion-verdict-on-zoolander-2>
, such pleats might not be the ones for you. But, suffice to say, Gucci pleats 
will be taking their place in the front row at fashion shows in September.

A picture says a thousand words, and one of Alexa Chung in a Gucci skirt and 
jumper, at a dinner for the brand late last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/08/party-lame-razzle-dazzle-nightclub-metallic>
, speaks volumes, mainly about the fabulousness of wearing a metallic, pleated 
midiskirt with a jumper. This look – which Chung has repeated since, as seen 
here – is already a bit of a cult reference among fashion editors, as a way to 
do dressed up but not too much. Fashion blogThe Man Repeller 
<http://www.manrepeller.com/best_of_internet/alexa-chung-style-skirt.html> even 
created a whole post dedicated to Chung’s look. It’s the swishiness and shine 
of the pleats, paired with a nerdy jumper that makes it pop. The ripples of 
this image will be making their way through fashion throughout 2016. A case in 
point:Chung’s upcoming collection for Marks & Spencer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/04/alexa-chung-to-collaborate-with-marks-spencer-stylewatch>
, which includes a pleated midiskirt.

While many of the female advertising employees in Mad Men wander around in 
miniskirts and love beads in the final series, copy chief Peggy Olson wears the 
kind of clothes that might be suitable for a job as a flight attendant. See 
cravat ties, boxy jackets, white gloves, and lots of pleated skirts. These come 
with a dropped waist on some dresses, for a little bit of 20s style in the late 
60s. Wear them now – in 2016! – and you’ll be covering both eras, thereby 
signalling to everyone that you’re a total fashion-history nerd. And when has 
that ever been a bad thing?

The micro pleat

The springy, super-tight pleat was originally created by Issey Miyake with his 
Pleats Please line in 1993, using a machine that heat-presses fabric. Similar 
pleats have made their way into the work of other designers in recent seasons – 
see Proenza Schouler and Hugo Boss – and they are worn by fashion insiders such 
asKatie Hillier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/31/katie-hillier-and-luella-bartley-to-launch-own-luxury-label>
 (who has a penchant for Miyake’s pleated fisherman’s trousers) and sussed 
celebrities such as Solange. VeryFrieze art fair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/oct/15/frieze-frame-the-art-fairs-best-dressed>
, this is a pleat for the high-minded. Bonus: the micro pleat is so springy, it 
travels very well; all the better for jetset arty types.

 last year is great, but the kind of accordion pleats used here – not to 
mention the sparkles – is totally ballroom, as seen on Saturday night favourite,
Strictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/29/fashion-lessons-strictly-come-dancing-sequins-superheroes-tight-trousers>
. Forgot Chung down-playing the glamour, this is all about using a pleat to 
take it up a notch. The more sparkles, the better. Time to channel the likes of 
Georgia May Foote, Helen George and Anita Rani with a dress just asking for a 
waltz. In style terms, it’s four 10s from us.

The prep school pleat

The kilt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/13/why-you-should-buy-a-kilt-right-now>
 is pleated, apparently, to show off the sett – the pattern of the tartan – 
just so. While it has come a long way from its Highland beginnings, this 
principle still holds – especially in fashion. The neatness of lines appeals, 
as does the association with school uniforms. See London label,Le Kilt 
<http://lekilt.co.uk>, designed by Samantha McCoach. The autumn collection was 
fabulously bratty –Chanel Oberlin

 meetsBlair Waldorf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/oct/17/gossip-girl-fashion-farewell>
 with a dash of Marmalade Atkins. These pleats are made of stiff stuff to keep 
up with the after-dark adventures of their eye-rolling wearer. Note: this pleat 
isMrs Prada <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/prada> approved. The designer 
often wears a midi-kilt for her post-show bow.
