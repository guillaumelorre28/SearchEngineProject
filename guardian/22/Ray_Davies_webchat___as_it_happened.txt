Thank you for all your questions - sorry I didn't get round to answering more. 
Let's do it again sometime. But remember: computers are bad for your eyes. And, 
I have to say, your soul.

I went to one of your storyteller gigs in Sheffield around 15 years ago ( one 
of my favourite ever gigs!), and I’ve read a number of pieces where you mention 
Big Bill Broonzy, I’ve seen you play a National Resonator, covering Sleepy John 
Este’s Milk Cow Blues, and a number of Kinks songs with Blues in the title and 
lyrics. Could you tell us how much of an influence the blues have had on you, 
and which bluesmen in particular as well as Big Bill Broonzy please?

The American blues in the South was a profound influence on me. One of my most 
cherished awards is that I'm a Blues Ambassador of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when 
I was presented the Slim Harpo award. I think it's the simplicity - as I said 
earlier, it's a protest forum, that can touch on very emotive issues, for 
example Big Bill Broonzy's If You're Black Get Back Get Back was incredible 
important for its time. But you don't have to be from the American South to be 
a bluesman. One of my great friends and inspirations was a man called Davey 
Graham, who I believe was mixed race but sang the blues in an almost London 
accent. No American affectation whatsover. And he still conveyed the emotions 
of the blues without resorting to the American accent. When the Kinks first 
started we were often reported as saying we sing blues, but we don't sing in 
American accents. We tried to retain our Englishness.

Davey Graham was from Scotland I believe. He was a great technician.

As I said, the cast has changed now, but I did mention the 80 Days project to 
a couple of actors. I'd love to work with all of them again.

Very minimalist, with a great riff, fantastic key changes, something like You

Hi Ray! My Dad passed away last week and we’ve been busy planning his funeral. 
He was a lifelong Kinks fan, and one of my first ever gigs was when he took me 
to see you in London. We are trying to chose a Kinks song for his funeral, but 
are struggling to find the perfect song. Which of your song would you pick?

It's such an important event, that I couldn't presume to make a judgement 
call. Think of something your father loved, and something that you happily 
remember him by. From my own experience, when my mother died, I went to the 
funeral service and the rumour was she had chosen Days or Sunny Afternoon. I 
was about to brace myself for the moment, but was almost relieved when she 
chose My Way by Frank Sinatra. This is almost too personal for me to make any 
comment on, but sorry for your loss.

“The two characters in the song, Terry and Julie, are to do with the 
aspirations of my sisters’ generation, who grew up during the Second world War 
and missed out on the 60s” ... you said in Uncut, 2009.

Presumably Terry & Julie are in their 80s now. How do you think they would 
look back on their lives? How do you think they’d view the London, the UK, of 
2015?

That's not exactly a correct quote. I think I meant to say my older sister's 
generation. Many of my songs were inspired by things I saw growing up. In many 
respects, Terry and Julie were people from their generation, walking into their 
future. I think anyone who is young and in love sees that transition as a 
beautiful thing, regardless of what era they live in. Before she died last 
year, my sister was very fond of getting on the internet, so she embraced the 
times in which she lived. Again, we cannot live in the past. We must always 
keep a secret part of ourselves for the things we care about and cherish.

Going back to Presevation, Mr Flash was the capitalist dictator. He was an 
ex-game show host and vaudeville comedian, loosely modelled on Max Miller and 
other dictators who were around at the time. I actually managed to get Max 
Miller's actual hat from the comedian Roy Hudd, I bought the jacket from a sale 
at Harrods for £25.

2015 1:55pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/60880728> 
Because of the success of Sunny Afternoon, I've been approached to revive some 
of these shows, particularly 80 Days and Come Dancing. 80 Days was produced in 
La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in the late 80s, and the director at that time 
Des Maceinuff said it was one of the best scores he'd ever worked with. It was 
a massive undertaking for a provincial, albeit well-funded, theatre, with 125 
characters. And I'm very keen to get this re-staged. Perhaps the Barbican might 
be a good place... I think Des blew most of the budget on a mechanical elephant 
that eventually got cut from the show.

Come Dancing ran at Stratford East in 2008, and in order to get the funding, I 
had to play the narrator. Which was either a great moment or a disappointment 
depending or whether or not you're a fan. There's been interest in this show in 
America. And I'm toying with the idea of asking Christopher Walken to play my 
part. Now he's a fancy dancer. Real good.

You Really Got Me was our first number one. It was so diffcult to a) let the 
record company let us record it, because they considered it too "edgy" for pop 
music at that time, and b) the first recording of it wasn't the way I envisaged 
it to be. Because we were an unknown band, with one single option on our 
contract, we were considered to be upstarts because we asked for it to be 
adequately recorded. The inevitable lawsuit was threatened, but one of my 
managers at the time reminded me we hadn't yet granted a sync licence to the 
record company, which would allow them to put the record out. Again there were 
threats of litigation from the record company, but in the end they relented and 
allowed us to rerecord the song provided we paid for it ourselves. We recorded 
it in a studio just off Portland Place, near the BBC. After recording it, in a 
couple of hours, we put the equipment in the small van we had outside (no 
parking wardens in those days). And as we drove off, we all said: that's a 
number one record. So to answer the question, I think there's an instinctive 
thing you feel about something that's original, and more to the point, the way 
you want it to be.

I went to one of your storyteller gigs in Sheffield around 15 years ago ( one

Big Bill Broonzy, I’ve seen you play a National Resonator, covering Sleepy John 
Este’s Milk Cow Blues, and a number of Kinks songs with Blues in the title and 
lyrics. Could you tell us how much of an influence the blues have had on you,

The American blues in the South was a profound influence on me. One of my most 
cherished awards is that I'm a Blues Ambassador of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when 
I was presented the Slim Harpo award. I think it's the simplicity - as I said 
earlier, it's a protest forum, that can touch on very emotive issues, for 
example Big Bill Broonzy's If You're Black Get Back Get Back was incredible 
important for its time. But you don't have to be from the American South to be 
a bluesman. One of my great friends and inspirations was a man called Davey 
Graham, who I believe was mixed race but sang the blues in an almost London 
accent. No American affectation whatsover. And he still conveyed the emotions 
of the blues without resorting to the American accent. When the Kinks first 
started we were often reported as saying we sing blues, but we don't sing in 
American accents. We tried to retain our Englishness.

It's such an important event, that I couldn't presume to make a judgement 
call. Think of something your father loved, and something that you happily 
remember him by. From my own experience, when my mother died, I went to the 
funeral service and the rumour was she had chosen Days or Sunny Afternoon. I 
was about to brace myself for the moment, but was almost relieved when she 
chose My Way by Frank Sinatra. This is almost too personal for me to make any 
comment on, but sorry for your loss.

Wolverhampton Civic Hall; mid 90’s (great gig)

About 5 rows back: My mate Dave said you were nodding at him, I say you were 
nodding at me ... Please settle a 20 year a argument once and for all. Cheers. 
Keep up the stellar work.

“The two characters in the song, Terry and Julie, are to do with the 
aspirations of my sisters’ generation, who grew up during the Second world War 
and missed out on the 60s” ... you said in Uncut, 2009.

Presumably Terry & Julie are in their 80s now. How do you think they would 
look back on their lives? How do you think they’d view the London, the UK, of 
2015?

That's not exactly a correct quote. I think I meant to say my older sister's 
generation. Many of my songs were inspired by things I saw growing up. In many 
respects, Terry and Julie were people from their generation, walking into their 
future. I think anyone who is young and in love sees that transition as a 
beautiful thing, regardless of what era they live in. Before she died last 
year, my sister was very fond of getting on the internet, so she embraced the 
times in which she lived. Again, we cannot live in the past. We must always 
keep a secret part of ourselves for the things we care about and cherish.

Going back to Presevation, Mr Flash was the capitalist dictator. He was an 
ex-game show host and vaudeville comedian, loosely modelled on Max Miller and 
other dictators who were around at the time. I actually managed to get Max 
Miller's actual hat from the comedian Roy Hudd, I bought the jacket from a sale 
at Harrods for £25.

Is it possible in near future that your earlier musicals Chorus Girls, Around

so that your fans in other countries cold view these works. Please, please 
please do so.

Because of the success of Sunny Afternoon, I've been approached to revive some 
of these shows, particularly 80 Days and Come Dancing. 80 Days was produced in 
La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in the late 80s, and the director at that time 
Des Maceinuff said it was one of the best scores he'd ever worked with. It was 
a massive undertaking for a provincial, albeit well-funded, theatre, with 125 
characters. And I'm very keen to get this re-staged. Perhaps the Barbican might 
be a good place... I think Des blew most of the budget on a mechanical elephant 
that eventually got cut from the show.

Come Dancing ran at Stratford East in 2008, and in order to get the funding, I 
had to play the narrator. Which was either a great moment or a disappointment 
depending or whether or not you're a fan. There's been interest in this show in 
America. And I'm toying with the idea of asking Christopher Walken to play my 
part. Now he's a fancy dancer. Real good.

You Really Got Me was our first number one. It was so diffcult to a) let the 
record company let us record it, because they considered it too "edgy" for pop 
music at that time, and b) the first recording of it wasn't the way I envisaged 
it to be. Because we were an unknown band, with one single option on our 
contract, we were considered to be upstarts because we asked for it to be 
adequately recorded. The inevitable lawsuit was threatened, but one of my 
managers at the time reminded me we hadn't yet granted a sync licence to the 
record company, which would allow them to put the record out. Again there were 
threats of litigation from the record company, but in the end they relented and 
allowed us to rerecord the song provided we paid for it ourselves. We recorded 
it in a studio just off Portland Place, near the BBC. After recording it, in a 
couple of hours, we put the equipment in the small van we had outside (no 
parking wardens in those days). And as we drove off, we all said: that's a 
number one record. So to answer the question, I think there's an instinctive 
thing you feel about something that's original, and more to the point, the way 
you want it to be.
