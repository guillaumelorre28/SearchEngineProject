That's it folks.

Thanks so much to all of you for your questions, and to Zach for all of his 
very eloquent answers.

I’m wondering, what are your thoughts about people frequently citing Natalie 
Portman’s character in Garden State as an example of the ‘Manic Pixie Dream 
Girl’ trope? Do you find this a legitimate criticism or unfairly reductive?

Unfairly reductive is a more eloquent way of putting it than I could have put 
it. I essentially wrote the kind of girl I dreamed I would one day meet.

teebs21 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13135789> is wondering 
about the future:

After the grey beard the grey hair will surely follow, and your transformation 
into Jon Stewart will be closer to completion. (A compliment, naturally.) Would 
you ever consider moving into Daily Show-style TV?

No, but I'm so happy that show exists. There's so much ludicrous bullshit on 
the American news channels that I love it when people like John Stewart, John 
Oliver, Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert call out the hypocrisy. They are doing 
God's work.

I can answer both your questions at the same time: New York City. Whenever I'm 
there I feel like I'm in the centre of Earth. You can't look up without seeing 
every single type of person there is. You can't walk ten blocks without seeing 
every single type of business there is. And as a lover of the arts, it feels 
like the cultural centre of Earth. Don't get mad, Londoners, I know London is 
equally high on that list. It's just that I know New York a whole lot better.

Zach, “Guy Love” from Scrubs is my ring tone. What is yours?

My ringtone is Donald singing You Are The Wind Beneath My Wings. He sang it to 
me when the Internet, a few years back, tricked people into thinking I was 
dead. I asked Donald to join me in a video I made for Facebook, in order to 
correct the rumour - to sing Wind Beneath My Wings, because it made me realise 
if I died before him, I wanted him to sing it at my funeral. The funny thing 
about that story is, the video announcing that I was still indeed alive, didn't 
get that many likes.

I was a waiter in the year 2000. I am very aware that I would be nowhere 
without my incredible fans. Everything that I do I do with them in mind. This 
particular experiment, makingWish I Was Here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/wish-i-was-here>, was particularly made for 
them because I fought hard and many many battles, to bring to the theatres 
something that I felt pretty confident my fanbase would like. Some actors have 
other people manage all their social media; I do everything myself. I enjoy the 
discourse with my fans whether it's Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, 
Grindr...

I’m a fan since Broken Hearts Club and thought you were terrific. I believe 
you put the lie to the trope that straight can’t play gay and vice versa. Do 
you think the meme that a gay actor cannot play straight romantic lead is 
propaganda left over from less tolerant times, and will we ever get past it?

I personally think society has been way more tolerant of a straight man 
playing gay, than a gay man playing straight. But like many taboos, this seems 
to be on its way out, most famously Neil Patrick Harris has been playing a 
womanizer on the show How I Met Your Mother, and Jim Parsons in my own film 
Garden State, played a fast food knight that heroically banged Peter 
Sarsgaard's character's mother.

I know it's hard to believe but you get to a point where you don't even click 
on it when you see it on the guide. Sometimes people send me clips on YouTube, 
on Twitter, saying something like 'one of my favourite Scrubs moments' and I'll 
click on that and laugh, but no, I never watch it on TV. I also never watch 
Garden State when it's on TV.

Donald decided to marry a woman, which has made it difficult for us to tie the

Why did Scrub always have sentimental crappy life lessons in every episode? 
And why didn’t Bob Kelso get his own spin off show? He was the only character 
worth a damn.

Dear friend,

It is plural, Scrubs, and the show went nine seasons so it seems enough people 
liked it, as you say, "sentimental crappy life lessons". The show and its style 
are of course not for everyone, nor is my work independent of Scrubs. If you're 
not a fan of sentiment, and emotion, along with your comedy, then odds are my 
style is not for you.

As to your Bob Kelso question, because there would have been no sentiment, and 
you would have been the only person watching.

Dear Biatch,

That's a great question. In my own country 95% of all anyone wanted to talk 
about was the crowdfunding. As I've done this European tour, it's been really 
interesting that of course people are interested in talking about theKickstarter
 <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/kickstarter> element, because it's the 
first completely original film to be made on this scale in this way. But then 
after we get one or two questions of it out of the way, they're way more 
interested in talking about the film over here. The critiques of the film, good 
or bad, for better or for worse, seem way more based on the merits of the film 
itself, than from the viewpoint of someone who is already biased from thoughts 
on crowdfunding.

I can answer both your questions at the same time: New York City. Whenever I'm 
there I feel like I'm in the centre of Earth. You can't look up without seeing 
every single type of person there is. You can't walk ten blocks without seeing 
every single type of business there is. And as a lover of the arts, it feels 
like the cultural centre of Earth. Don't get mad, Londoners, I know London is 
equally high on that list. It's just that I know New York a whole lot better.

My ringtone is Donald singing You Are The Wind Beneath My Wings. He sang it to 
me when the Internet, a few years back, tricked people into thinking I was 
dead. I asked Donald to join me in a video I made for Facebook, in order to 
correct the rumour - to sing Wind Beneath My Wings, because it made me realise 
if I died before him, I wanted him to sing it at my funeral. The funny thing 
about that story is, the video announcing that I was still indeed alive, didn't 
get that many likes.

I personally think society has been way more tolerant of a straight man 
playing gay, than a gay man playing straight. But like many taboos, this seems 
to be on its way out, most famously Neil Patrick Harris has been playing a 
womanizer on the show How I Met Your Mother, and Jim Parsons in my own film 
Garden State, played a fast food knight that heroically banged Peter 
Sarsgaard's character's mother.

knot. Instead, we regularly get together and tie our penises together, in a 
glorious skin-knot.

these ponderances:


Why did Scrub always have sentimental crappy life lessons in every episode? 
And why didn’t Bob Kelso get his own spin off show? He was the only character 
worth a damn.

Dear friend,

It is plural, Scrubs, and the show went nine seasons so it seems enough people 
liked it, as you say, "sentimental crappy life lessons". The show and its style 
are of course not for everyone, nor is my work independent of Scrubs. If you're 
not a fan of sentiment, and emotion, along with your comedy, then odds are my 
style is not for you.

As to your Bob Kelso question, because there would have been no sentiment, and 
you would have been the only person watching.

know:

How did you break out of typecasting after so many years of working in Scrubs?

I don't know that I have. I just keep casting myself.

Hey zach, since watching scrubs my son insists on calling me biatch (for this 
I forgive you). As a family we have watched with admiration and have been 
inspired by your wish to make a film how you intended it to be made (for this 
we thank you). How does the reaction to kickstarter vary (if at all and yes i 
use too many brckets) from country to country? X

Dear Biatch,

That's a great question. In my own country 95% of all anyone wanted to talk 
about was the crowdfunding. As I've done this European tour, it's been really 
interesting that of course people are interested in talking about theKickstarter
 <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/kickstarter> element, because it's the 
first completely original film to be made on this scale in this way. But then 
after we get one or two questions of it out of the way, they're way more 
interested in talking about the film over here. The critiques of the film, good 
or bad, for better or for worse, seem way more based on the merits of the film 
itself, than from the viewpoint of someone who is already biased from thoughts 
on crowdfunding.
