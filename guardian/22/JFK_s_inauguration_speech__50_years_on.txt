John F Kennedy's grave at Arlington cemetery, looking out over the Potomac 
river on Washington, is marked by an eternal flame and the words he delivered 
in his inauguration speech 50 years ago today. Engraved in stone is the 
best-remembered line: "And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country 
will do for you – ask what you can do for your country."

Those words sum up a speech remembered as inspirational, a call for altruism, 
to end poverty, disease and war.

But that is not how the speech was viewed everywhere at the time. Guardian 
reporters did not mention that quotation, or much else from the speech, in 
their reports on the front pages the next day. They were more preoccupied with 
the weather: six inches of snow had fallen ahead of the speech and it was a 
chilly inauguration.

Nor has history been kind to Kennedy: his administration is now viewed more as 
symbolic and short on achievement. His vice-president Lyndon B Johnson, sitting 
beside him on the rostrum on inauguration day, did not have the looks or the 
eloquence but, as Kennedy's successor, he did bring in the civil rights 
legislation that JFK shied away from tackling and he did mount the war on 
poverty that Kennedy mentioned but failed to do anything about.

The main news story was written by a Guardian veteran Washington 
correspondent, Max Freedman, under the headline Mr Kennedy Sets His Sights. His 
introduction is straightforward enough, but focused as much on the weather as 
the speech. "Mr John Fitzgerald Kennedy became the thirty-fifth President of 
the United States at noon today in a ceremony whose mingled simplicity and 
solemnity lost none of its grandeur because the city was numbed by a storm that 
left six inches of snow on the main streets and chilled the festive gaiety of 
Inaugural Day."

The Guardian prides itself on the dictum of its longest-serving editor, CP 
Scott, that comment is free but facts are sacred – basically that there should 
be no editorialising in news reports. That seems to have passed by Freedman, 
who writes of Kennedy's speech: "Rarely has the anthem of courage been sounded 
so resonantly or so bravely in recent years."

In similar bursts of eulogy, Freedman writes that Kennedy spoke not only as 
the supreme leader of the American people but also as "the central guardian of 
the hopes of free nations everywhere" and that he was accompanied "by the 
prayers and blessings of generous men and women in all lands where the lamp of 
freedom shall never be dimmed by tyranny".

Sitting beside Freedman's report on the front page is a piece of fine 
colour-writing, less euphoric, by another Guardian US veteran, Alistair Cooke.

Cooke wrote his piece from New York, watching the inauguration on television – 
again almost unthinkable now. The Guardian would expect its main colour writer 
to be present.

Cooke, like Freedman, focused more on the weather than the speech. He opened 
with: "Snow swirling from high winds and 12 degrees of frost, the worst 
inaugural weather in 52 years did not ruffle the smooth succession of John 
Fitzgerald Kennedy to the presidency ..."

The overlap between the two men's reports may reflect the fact that the two 
had fallen out, seldom spoke to one another and did not co-ordinate their 
efforts.

Cooke carries only one quotation from the speech, and not one of the famous 
ones, but he praises the content and delivery, saying that, without a quaver, 
Kennedy delivered "the simple, rolling cadences of what is certainly one of the 
simplest and most eloquent of inaugural speeches".

Page seven of that day's Guardian carried the full text of the address. 
Reading it now, it seems dated and less inspirational than the quotes singled 
out would suggest. It does not have the resonance and universal appeal of 
Martin Luther King's "I have a dream 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/aug/21/usa.features11>" speech on the 
steps of the Lincoln Memorial orLincoln's Gettysburg address 
<http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm>. 
(Reporters covering the latter at the time did not think much of it, either: it 
was only later heralded as a great piece of oratory.)

Kennedy's main theme, not surprisingly in the middle of the cold war, is 
anti-communism, reassuring allies and warning enemies that the US "shall pay 
any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend or oppose any 
foe in order to assure the survival and success of liberty". He reiteratedthe 
Monroe doctrine <http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=old&doc=23>, 
promising to help fight poverty in Latin America but coupling it with a warning 
to other nations to stay outside the hemisphere.

It was this anti-communist theme that dominated his presidency: the CIA-backed 
debacle at the Bay of Pigs 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1961/apr/24/fromthearchive>, the 
standoff with Russia over Cuba 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1962/oct/29/fromthearchive> and then 
Berlin <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1963/jun/27/usa.germany>, and his 
struggle over how to deal with North Vietnam. In his speech, he promised to 
give a bigger role to the United Nations but the organisation was, as usual in 
Washington, absent from his thinking when major foreign policy decisions had to 
be made.

The Guardian's editorial welcomed Kennedy's "brave and dignified" speech, 
opening with a famous quote from it: "The torch has been passed to a new 
generation of Americans."

Kennedy spoke about the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and the Guardian 
editorial writer expressed hope that nuclear weapons could be removed from the 
frontline in Germany. We are still waiting.

It was also cold the day of Barack Obama's inauguration: it usually is in DC 
in January. Obama, an inspirational orator on the stump, deliberately opted for 
aworkmanlike inauguration speech 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/audio/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inaugural-address>
, trying to lower expectations. He may yet come to be regarded as more 
successful than Kennedy – not that the standard is particularly high.

The lasting legacy of the Kennedy speech is that his call for Americans to 
think not about what their country could do for them but what they might do for 
their country led to the creation of the Peace Corps, with lots of idealistic 
young Americans being sent off round the world to help fight poverty and, 
whether or not they did much good, coming back in most cases with an interest 
in the developing world.

A long way from the call to end poverty, disease and war but at least it is 
something.
