So, after a tense and tactical race where all the big players traded moves, 
Amalie Dideriksen took on the dominant Dutch team and won in a thrilling finish.

a tough, controversial year with a fourth-placed finish, but it was 
Dideriksen‚Äôs day. Thanks for joining me. Bye!

Wild looked bewildered to see the 20-year-old Dideriksen motor past her. That 
seemed entirely in her grasp, but she struggled to pull away and was caught 
cold by Dideriksen‚Äôs blistering finish. Lotta Lepisto came third, withLizzie 
Deignan <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lizzie-armitstead> sprinting to a 
creditable fourth placed finish.

‚ÄúI dreamed of a top ten... my team-mates were amazing today, I had a small 
crash and they brought me back,‚Äù says Dideriksen after the race, who admits her 
win ‚Äúis a surprise for everybody‚Äù. Worth pointing out that she only had two 
team-mates ‚Äì Julie Leth and Cecile Uttrup Ludwig ‚Äì in the small Danish team.

4km to go! Deignan is in around 20th position, tucked in behind King and 
Barnes ‚Äì but as they turn for home, the Netherlands have half a dozen riders at 
the front, dominating the pack. It will be a surprise if they let this get away 
now...

The Dutch team seem entirely unfazed by those British attacks, with Olympic 
champion Van der Breggen looking comfortable at the top. Are the riders 
resigned to a bunch sprint, or will Deignan make a move?

Here‚Äôs Leah Crampton, with an interesting insight into why it may be quiet in 
Qatar:

We live in the north of Qatar and always try to support the cyclists when the 
road races bring them up here. One year I was the lucky recipient of Mark 
Cavendish‚Äôs celebratory bunch of flowers! The heat and then traffic/roadworks 
in the city make it very challenging for expat support along the route at this 
time of day.

The British team, who have been policing the peloton throughout the race, 
launch their first breakaway through Dani King, who darts into the lead and 
splits the pack! Neben, exhausted from that breakaway, has fallen straight 
through the bunch, and out the other side.

One lap to go! The bell rings and Neben crosses the line out in front ‚Äì but 
with the peloton bearing down on her. We appear to be 15km from an all-out 
bunch sprint for the title, but there will surely be solo breakaways to contend 
with before then.

The Dutch team has so much pedigree ‚Äì perhaps the best women‚Äôs team ever 
assembled ‚Äì and Roxane Knetemann is the latest rider in orange to take up the 
reins, with the peloton moving at 41km/h, and still 20 seconds behind Neben.

Britain still have numbers at the front, perhaps waiting for instructions for 
defending championLizzie Deignan

Huang, a capable sprinter from Chinese Taipei, has crashed and is looking worse

Neben‚Äôs bid for glory looks set to fall short, with the gap just 20 seconds 
with 20km to go. Germany and Poland are making rare appearances at the front of 
the pack. It‚Äôs worth mentioning, given that this is a world championship event, 
that away from the finish line, absolutely no-one is watching from the side of 
the road.

Pearl. Britain have eight riders, and haven‚Äôt put the work in that the Dutch 
have ‚Äì what can Deignan, Barnes, King et al pull out of the bag in the latter 
stages? It‚Äôs all very tactical with just over 25km to go.

One reason a lot of teams aren't chasing Neben yet is that if she's caught too 
soon, opens up chances for more Dutch attacks#UCIDoha2016

Two laps to go, and Neben crosses in a time of 2:27:53 ‚Äì and a gap of 36 
seconds, as the peloton begin to regain their momentum. It took me longer than 
two-and-a-half hours to go 120km yesterday, and I was a) not travelling in 
desert heat, and b) in a car.

Much like in the Rio road race, Deignan is keeping a low profile, occasionally 
visible near the front as other riders burn themselves out trying to haul Neben 
in. 35km to go, and the gap is 45 seconds. It‚Äôs still a big ask, but she looks 
remarkably comfortable.

Those capable of taking this race in a breakaway move are agitating at the 
front of the pack ‚Äì including Vos and Deignan. They may need to form a separate 
group to reel Neben in, who is still 40 seconds clear. Further down the field, 
Zabelinskaya appears to have been disqualified, for getting a tow from her team 
to get back into the pack.

Now it‚Äôs the turn of Anna van der Breggen, the Olympic champion, to crank up 
the pace, hands across the front of her handlebars, making it all look much 
easier than it actually is. Team-mate van Vleuten picks up the baton, and ends 
the fourth lap of the Pearl in the lead, followed by Sweden‚Äôs Sara Mustonen and 
Britain‚Äôs Hannah Barnes.

Dani King does make a move to keep pace with Vos, and a gap opens briefly 
before the peloton, led by Australia, reel them back in. Vos stays at the front 
as they take a tricky right-hand hairpin, before the Australian charge is 
weakened as Tiffany Cromwell suffers a mechanical problem, and falls a long way 
off the pace.

They‚Äôre moving through the gears along a shady section of road, with Annemiek 
van Vleuten setting the pace. After her horrific crash in Rio, it‚Äôs remarkable 
that she‚Äôs racing here at all. She makes way for Amy Pieters, and then Vos, as 
the Netherlands are forced to counter-attack themselves. None of the other 
nations stocked with riders are willing to get involved.50km to go...

Hanselmann, previously part of a breakaway with Yonamine, is now rolling along 
at the back of the bunch, as shown by her on-board camera. The pack have passed 
through another feed zone and the pace has dropped, with riders dropping back 
to load up on refreshments.

Thanks Les. We‚Äôve got 57km of racing to go, and another Dutch drive, led by 
the legendary Marianne Vos, has hauled in the breakaway. Every Dutch rider 
apart from sprinter Kirsten Wild has pulled away off the front, and it‚Äôs 
starting to wear the peloton out in 37-degree heat.

With 65km left, the Dutch push hard again at the front through Vos. Deignan is 
quick to respond. As the pace quickens, the head of the peloton is starting to 
thin visibly. And as the tension ratchets up, I‚Äôm going to hand over to my 
colleague Niall McVeigh, who will guide you through the remainder of the race.

Attack and retreat remains the order of the day as the big guns look to thin 
the field.Van der Breggen leads the latest charge by the Dutch, and it 
certainly has the desired effect, stretching the front of the peloton. Vos is 
up there too, with Deignan and King likewise firmly in the frame.

Spare a thought for Giorgia Bronzini, who was unable to contest the race after 
falling sick. The Italian would have been a real contender here. Elena Cecchini 
is going well in her team-mate‚Äôs absence; she‚Äôs currently about seven places 
back in the peloton.

With 77km remaining and 41 seconds to Yonamine and Hanselmann, Amy Pieters

but it could be part of a wider attempt to break up the Australian contingent.

Aussie, Aussie, Aussie! Which is to say, the Australians are coming. Or they 
may be, at least. Chloe Hosking is among a group of three or four jostling for 
position at the head of the peloton, and that‚Äôs one to keep an eye on. If any 
country can live with the Dutch contingent in a bunch sprint, it‚Äôll be them. 
They‚Äôre joined by a glut of German riders.

Back at the front, where Yonamine has been joined by Nicole Hanselmann of 
Switzerland, there‚Äôs a 47-second gap to the field with 82km left. Surely the 
British will need to start thinking about splitting up the peloton soon? They 
can ill afford to sprint it out with the Dutch come the business end of 
proceedings. Speaking of the Netherlands, Vos is now close to the front of the 
peloton. She‚Äôs not been too prominent so far, but it‚Äôs unlikely things will 
stay that way.

some damage. She‚Äôs just had to stop again for a technical adjustment and it‚Äôll 
be interesting to see how the Dutch team respond. Will they help her back into 
contention, or will they simply seek to capitalise on their compatriot‚Äôs 
misfortune?

With the race yet to start in earnest, the sprint specialists would doubtless 
be licking their lips if they weren‚Äôt so parched.Anna van der Breggen is at the 
head of the peloton, and you have to wonder whether the Dutch are trying to 
control the pace before battling it out late on. The big question being, as 
ever with Dutch teams, will they work for the collective good or break ranks in 
pursuit of solo glory?

It‚Äôs not been a good race for Kuwait so far. Noura Alameeri suffered an early 
crash, and she‚Äôs now been joined on the sidelines by Nada Aljeraiwi, if I‚Äôm not 
mistaken. That leaves Naija Aljeraiwi as the sole Kuwaiti representative.

With 105km to go and the gap to Yonamine at 25 seconds, Russia hit the front 
of the peloton. There‚Äôs a grim determination etched on the collective 
countenance, with the riders desperately swilling water and dousing themselves 
with the dregs. Amber Neben, who is still bringing up the rear, is taking on 
ice. Looks like she‚Äôs collecting as much water as she can for her team-mates. 
No doubt they‚Äôll be grateful.

Plenty of action at the first feed zone, with all the riders scrambling to get 
fluids on board. Who can blame them in these conditions? Meanwhile, Yonamine 
continues to set the pace. She‚Äôs half a minute ahead of the rest. 
Interestingly, the 25-year-old is a former tennis player who only switched to 
cycling while at university. Judging by her performance here, she must have 
been an attack-minded sort on the tennis court; clearly she enjoys carrying the 
fight to the opposition.

Team tactics are likely to have a big bearing on the race and, with that in 
mind, it‚Äôs interesting that Roxane Kneteman has moved to the front of the 
peloton. The Dutch are the only team other than Great Britain with a full 
complement of eight riders and, with sprinters of the quality of Wild and Vos 
in their ranks, they‚Äôll be eager to ensure a fast finish.

Britain‚Äôs Hannah Barnes leads the peloton, which still lags Yonamine by about 
20 seconds. It‚Äôs exhausting just watching, and we‚Äôre still on lap one of seven 
of this sweltering circuit.

With the Pearl looming, a bunch of British riders have made their way to the 
front of the peloton. Dani King, who missed out on Rio in such heartbreaking 
fashion, is up there. So too isLizzie Deignan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lizzie-armitstead>. The gap to Yonamine is 
down to 15 seconds, although not for Amber Neben. A problem with her chain 
stopped the American in her tracks a couple of minutes ago, although she‚Äôs 
making up ground fast at the back of the field.

Yonamine ploughs on into a light headwind of about five or six miles per hour. 
She‚Äôs about 38 seconds ahead of the main field at this stage. With the race 
expected to culminate in a bunch sprint, it‚Äôs interesting that she‚Äôs decided to 
seize the initiative so early. Fracturing the peloton is probably the best way 
to avoid a bunch finish, but it‚Äôll take serious stamina to make the running and 
then break away from a smaller group in the closing stages.

peloton, but there‚Äôs no immediate reaction from the chasing pack. Little 
wonder, with 133 kms remaining.

Preamble

Good morning and welcome. If you like your sport laced with dramatic subplots, 
you‚Äôve come to the right place. While the competitors in this year‚Äôs women‚Äôs 
road race world championships will have their eyes firmly on the prize, the 
contest promises a host of potentially spellbinding sideshows and minor-key 
dramas. British interest will focus on Lizzie Deignan, the reigning champion,

 against a doping ban in the prelude to the Olympics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 
the controversy in which she became embroiled after missing three tests under 
the whereabouts rule has taken a mental toll on Deignan, and the noises 
emanating from her camp ‚Äì not to mention the rider herself ‚Äì suggest the 
combined effects of fatigue and an unfavourable course may be too much to 
handle.

But it‚Äôs not all about Deignan. A flat course with no climbs will inevitably 
favour the sprinters, which makes Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands the woman to 
beat. Australia‚Äôs Chloe Hosking, who in July sped to a brilliant La Course 
victory on the Champs √âlys√©es, has been preparing for the sweltering conditions 
in the Qatar capital bytransforming her bathroom into a temporary sauna

, who has no fewer than seven sprint victories to her name this year. And let‚Äôs

 in such horrific fashion but ‚Äì having recovered from a cracked spine ‚Äì is fit 
and raring to go again. What a story it would be if she could win today.

All that, and we haven‚Äôt even mentioned Olympic champion Anna van der Breggen, 
or the Belgian speedster Jolien D‚ÄôHoore. It should be quite a race.

So, after a tense and tactical race where all the big players traded moves, 
Amalie Dideriksen took on the dominant Dutch team and won in a thrilling finish.
Lizzie Deignan <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lizzie-armitstead> has ended 
a tough, controversial year with a fourth-placed finish, but it was 
Dideriksen‚Äôs day. Thanks for joining me. Bye!

Wild looked bewildered to see the 20-year-old Dideriksen motor past her. That 
seemed entirely in her grasp, but she struggled to pull away and was caught 
cold by Dideriksen‚Äôs blistering finish. Lotta Lepisto came third, withLizzie 
Deignan <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lizzie-armitstead> sprinting to a 
creditable fourth placed finish.

‚ÄúI dreamed of a top ten... my team-mates were amazing today, I had a small 
crash and they brought me back,‚Äù says Dideriksen after the race, who admits her 
win ‚Äúis a surprise for everybody‚Äù. Worth pointing out that she only had two 
team-mates ‚Äì Julie Leth and Cecile Uttrup Ludwig ‚Äì in the small Danish team.

Well... that was unexpected. Vos takes over with 300m to go, then Wild bursts 
for the line ‚Äì but former world junior champion, Denmark‚Äôs Amalie Dideriksen 
jumps off her wheel to stun the favourite at the line!

500m to go! The Dutch are holding everyone at bay as the finish line coming 
into view, and this looks to be Wild‚Äôs race to lose...
 
1km to go! Van Dijk takes up the pace, as four Dutch riders including Kirsten 
Wild stay out in front. Deignan is in sixth wheel, with Dideriksen of Denmark 
and Lepisto behind, but the Australian team are struggling...
 
2km to go! The Netherlands‚Äô pace has shredded what‚Äôs left of the peloton, 
leaving a group of around 20 riders in contention. Deignan, and Finnish 
sprinter Lotta Lepisto, are among those in with a chance if the Dutch team let 
this slip...
 
3km to go! The British trio do push up to try and compete with the Dutch, with 
Italy and Australia still in contention. King and Barnes don‚Äôt have any more to 
give, and leave Deignan on the wheel of the leading group in orange...
 
4km to go! Deignan is in around 20th position, tucked in behind King and 
Barnes ‚Äì but as they turn for home, the Netherlands have half a dozen riders at 
the front, dominating the pack. It will be a surprise if they let this get away 
now...
 
Van Vleuten and Van Dijk take turns on the front of the Dutch train, keeping 
any attacks at bay and setting up Wild for the sprint finish. Chloe Hosking‚Äôs 
Australian team are well-placed, with British riders dropping back a little with
5km to go...
 
The Dutch team seem entirely unfazed by those British attacks, with Olympic 
champion Van der Breggen looking comfortable at the top. Are the riders 
resigned to a bunch sprint, or will Deignan make a move?
 
Here‚Äôs Leah Crampton, with an interesting insight into why it may be quiet in 
Qatar:

We live in the north of Qatar and always try to support the cyclists when the 
road races bring them up here. One year I was the lucky recipient of Mark 
Cavendish‚Äôs celebratory bunch of flowers! The heat and then traffic/roadworks 
in the city make it very challenging for expat support along the route at this 
time of day.
 
The big hitters are right at the front now, with Sweden‚Äôs Emma Johansson 
bursting clear, reined in by Deignan and Marianne Vos. The pack regroup, and 
the pace drops slightly;there‚Äôs 10km to go, and the Netherlands show their 
strength again with Anna van der Breggen leading the way.
 
King is followed by Dutch and Australian riders, who are digging into their 
reserves of energy to keep pace with her. She hasn‚Äôt got away, but has 
certainly made this final lap interesting. It‚Äôs another British rider who 
counters, with Hannah Barnes making the running. They‚Äôre working to set up a 
breakaway, and with it another world title forLizzie Deignan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lizzie-armitstead>...
 The peloton rides at the Pearl in Doha. Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images  
The British team, who have been policing the peloton throughout the race, 
launch their first breakaway through Dani King, who darts into the lead and 
splits the pack! Neben, exhausted from that breakaway, has fallen straight 
through the bunch, and out the other side.
 
One lap to go! The bell rings and Neben crosses the line out in front ‚Äì but 
with the peloton bearing down on her. We appear to be 15km from an all-out 
bunch sprint for the title, but there will surely be solo breakaways to contend 
with before then.
 
The Dutch team has so much pedigree ‚Äì perhaps the best women‚Äôs team ever 
assembled ‚Äì and Roxane Knetemann is the latest rider in orange to take up the 
reins, with the peloton moving at 41km/h, and still 20 seconds behind Neben.

Britain still have numbers at the front, perhaps waiting for instructions for 
defending championLizzie Deignan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lizzie-armitstead>. Elsewhere, Ting Ying 
Huang, a capable sprinter from Chinese Taipei, has crashed and is looking worse 
for wear as she tries to rejoin the race.
 
Neben‚Äôs bid for glory looks set to fall short, with the gap just 20 seconds 
with 20km to go. Germany and Poland are making rare appearances at the front of 
the pack. It‚Äôs worth mentioning, given that this is a world championship event, 
that away from the finish line, absolutely no-one is watching from the side of 
the road.
 
The peloton has shed a fair few riders in the attritional heat, but the big 
players are present, and have cut the gap on Neben to 25 seconds. The American 
looking slightly less carefree at the front, with 22km to go, and events back 
in the pack aren‚Äôt going the USA‚Äôs way either ‚Äì Carmen Small needs a tyre 
change, and is left waiting at the side of the road.

Two women that have driven the pace at different times today ‚Äì Netherlands‚Äô 
Ellen van Dijk and Australia‚Äôs Loren Rowney ‚Äì lost touch with the main group at 
the start of this penultimate lap. Van Dijk has fought back, but Rowney‚Äôs race 
looks to be over. The same goes for Zabelinskaya, who has been disqualified and 
is waved off the course before she can begin another lap.
 
There‚Äôs still a lack of organisation at the front of the pack, which allows 
Neben, a time trial master, to maintain her lead around the western edge of the 
Pearl. Britain have eight riders, and haven‚Äôt put the work in that the Dutch 
have ‚Äì what can Deignan, Barnes, King et al pull out of the bag in the latter 
stages? It‚Äôs all very tactical with just over 25km to go.

One reason a lot of teams aren't chasing Neben yet is that if she's caught too 
soon, opens up chances for more Dutch attacks#UCIDoha2016

Two laps to go, and Neben crosses in a time of 2:27:53 ‚Äì and a gap of 36 
seconds, as the peloton begin to regain their momentum. It took me longer than 
two-and-a-half hours to go 120km yesterday, and I was a) not travelling in 
desert heat, and b) in a car.
 
Teams with pure sprinters in their midst ‚Äì Wild‚Äôs Dutch team and Chloe 
Hosking‚Äôs Australia ‚Äì are setting the pace at the top of the peloton, with 
Neben threatening to stretch her lead to a full minute. The shadows are 
lengthening in Doha, the temperature dropping a couple of degrees, but still 
unbelievably hot, of course.
 
Much like in the Rio road race, Deignan is keeping a low profile, occasionally 
visible near the front as other riders burn themselves out trying to haul Neben 
in. 35km to go, and the gap is 45 seconds. It‚Äôs still a big ask, but she looks 
remarkably comfortable.
 
Those capable of taking this race in a breakaway move are agitating at the 
front of the pack ‚Äì including Vos and Deignan. They may need to form a separate 
group to reel Neben in, who is still 40 seconds clear. Further down the field, 
Zabelinskaya appears to have been disqualified, for getting a tow from her team 
to get back into the pack.
 
The Dutch team in an awkward spot now, lacking the legs to reel Neben in, and 
lacking support from the peloton after their aggressive tactics in the opening 
laps of this final circuit. Neben has stretched her lead to 40 seconds after 
that expertly timed breakaway.
 
After a nervous ride through the free zone which saw a couple of riders, 
including Russia‚Äôs Olga Zabelinskaya, forced off their bikes, we have a solo 
breakaway, with American Amber Neben taking advantage of a tired peloton to 
carve out a 20-second lead. The 41-year-old will be feeling confident; shewon 
the time trial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/11/cycling-road-world-championships-2016-womens-time-trial-live>
 here four days ago.
 
Now it‚Äôs the turn of Anna van der Breggen, the Olympic champion, to crank up 
the pace, hands across the front of her handlebars, making it all look much 
easier than it actually is. Team-mate van Vleuten picks up the baton, and ends 
the fourth lap of the Pearl in the lead, followed by Sweden‚Äôs Sara Mustonen and 
Britain‚Äôs Hannah Barnes.
 
Dani King does make a move to keep pace with Vos, and a gap opens briefly 
before the peloton, led by Australia, reel them back in. Vos stays at the front 
as they take a tricky right-hand hairpin, before the Australian charge is 
weakened as Tiffany Cromwell suffers a mechanical problem, and falls a long way 
off the pace.
 
They‚Äôre moving through the gears along a shady section of road, with Annemiek 
van Vleuten setting the pace. After her horrific crash in Rio, it‚Äôs remarkable 
that she‚Äôs racing here at all. She makes way for Amy Pieters, and then Vos, as 
the Netherlands are forced to counter-attack themselves. None of the other 
nations stocked with riders are willing to get involved.50km to go...
 
Hanselmann, previously part of a breakaway with Yonamine, is now rolling along 
at the back of the bunch, as shown by her on-board camera. The pack have passed 
through another feed zone and the pace has dropped, with riders dropping back 
to load up on refreshments.
 
Thanks Les. We‚Äôve got 57km of racing to go, and another Dutch drive, led by 
the legendary Marianne Vos, has hauled in the breakaway. Every Dutch rider 
apart from sprinter Kirsten Wild has pulled away off the front, and it‚Äôs 
starting to wear the peloton out in 37-degree heat.
 
With 65km left, the Dutch push hard again at the front through Vos. Deignan is 
quick to respond. As the pace quickens, the head of the peloton is starting to 
thin visibly. And as the tension ratchets up, I‚Äôm going to hand over to my 
colleague Niall McVeigh, who will guide you through the remainder of the race.
 
Attack and retreat remains the order of the day as the big guns look to thin 
the field.Van der Breggen leads the latest charge by the Dutch, and it 
certainly has the desired effect, stretching the front of the peloton. Vos is 
up there too, with Deignan and King likewise firmly in the frame.
 
Spare a thought for Giorgia Bronzini, who was unable to contest the race after 
falling sick. The Italian would have been a real contender here. Elena Cecchini 
is going well in her team-mate‚Äôs absence; she‚Äôs currently about seven places 
back in the peloton.
 
As the riders complete the second lap, Israel‚Äôs Paz Bash moves to the front of 
the chasing pack. A brief feed zone frenzy ensues, with Nicole Cofino of 
Guatemala hitting the deck alongside one of the Ethiopian riders. Neither woman 
is hurt. Meanwhile, the leaders have a 25-second advantage.

With 77km remaining and 41 seconds to Yonamine and Hanselmann, Amy Pieters 
launches a Dutch breakaway at the front of the peloton. It doesn‚Äôt last long, 
but it could be part of a wider attempt to break up the Australian contingent. 
We‚Äôll see.
 
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie! Which is to say, the Australians are coming. Or they 
may be, at least. Chloe Hosking is among a group of three or four jostling for 
position at the head of the peloton, and that‚Äôs one to keep an eye on. If any 
country can live with the Dutch contingent in a bunch sprint, it‚Äôll be them. 
They‚Äôre joined by a glut of German riders.
 
Back at the front, where Yonamine has been joined by Nicole Hanselmann of 
Switzerland, there‚Äôs a 47-second gap to the field with 82km left. Surely the 
British will need to start thinking about splitting up the peloton soon? They 
can ill afford to sprint it out with the Dutch come the business end of 
proceedings. Speaking of the Netherlands, Vos is now close to the front of the 
peloton. She‚Äôs not been too prominent so far, but it‚Äôs unlikely things will 
stay that way.
 
And as I write that, race favourite Kirsten Wild is unseated following a 
slow-motion collision with Poland‚Äôs Alicja Ratajczak.She‚Äôs quickly up, is the 
Dutchwoman, and doesn‚Äôt look unduly perturbed, but her bike may have sustained 
some damage. She‚Äôs just had to stop again for a technical adjustment and it‚Äôll 
be interesting to see how the Dutch team respond. Will they help her back into 
contention, or will they simply seek to capitalise on their compatriot‚Äôs 
misfortune?
 
With the race yet to start in earnest, the sprint specialists would doubtless 
be licking their lips if they weren‚Äôt so parched.Anna van der Breggen is at the 
head of the peloton, and you have to wonder whether the Dutch are trying to 
control the pace before battling it out late on. The big question being, as 
ever with Dutch teams, will they work for the collective good or break ranks in 
pursuit of solo glory?
 
Meanwhile, further up the field, there‚Äôs a 21-second gap between Yonamine and 
the chasing pack with 97km to go.
 
It‚Äôs not been a good race for Kuwait so far. Noura Alameeri suffered an early 
crash, and she‚Äôs now been joined on the sidelines by Nada Aljeraiwi, if I‚Äôm not 
mistaken. That leaves Naija Aljeraiwi as the sole Kuwaiti representative.
 
With 105km to go and the gap to Yonamine at 25 seconds, Russia hit the front 
of the peloton. There‚Äôs a grim determination etched on the collective 
countenance, with the riders desperately swilling water and dousing themselves 
with the dregs. Amber Neben, who is still bringing up the rear, is taking on 
ice. Looks like she‚Äôs collecting as much water as she can for her team-mates. 
No doubt they‚Äôll be grateful.
 
Plenty of action at the first feed zone, with all the riders scrambling to get 
fluids on board. Who can blame them in these conditions? Meanwhile, Yonamine 
continues to set the pace. She‚Äôs half a minute ahead of the rest. 
Interestingly, the 25-year-old is a former tennis player who only switched to 
cycling while at university. Judging by her performance here, she must have 
been an attack-minded sort on the tennis court; clearly she enjoys carrying the 
fight to the opposition.

Team tactics are likely to have a big bearing on the race and, with that in 
mind, it‚Äôs interesting that Roxane Kneteman has moved to the front of the 
peloton. The Dutch are the only team other than Great Britain with a full 
complement of eight riders and, with sprinters of the quality of Wild and Vos 
in their ranks, they‚Äôll be eager to ensure a fast finish.
 
Britain‚Äôs Hannah Barnes leads the peloton, which still lags Yonamine by about 
20 seconds. It‚Äôs exhausting just watching, and we‚Äôre still on lap one of seven 
of this sweltering circuit.
 
With the Pearl looming, a bunch of British riders have made their way to the 
front of the peloton. Dani King, who missed out on Rio in such heartbreaking 
fashion, is up there. So too isLizzie Deignan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lizzie-armitstead>. The gap to Yonamine is 
down to 15 seconds, although not for Amber Neben. A problem with her chain 
stopped the American in her tracks a couple of minutes ago, although she‚Äôs 
making up ground fast at the back of the field.
 
Yonamine ploughs on into a light headwind of about five or six miles per hour. 
She‚Äôs about 38 seconds ahead of the main field at this stage. With the race 
expected to culminate in a bunch sprint, it‚Äôs interesting that she‚Äôs decided to 
seize the initiative so early. Fracturing the peloton is probably the best way 
to avoid a bunch finish, but it‚Äôll take serious stamina to make the running and 
then break away from a smaller group in the closing stages.
 
Yonamine continues to set the pace, with the gap to the peloton about 20 
seconds.
 
The distinctive Qatari landscape, full of cranes and construction sites, 
flashes past as the riders make their way towards the Pearl, an artificial 
island off the West Bay. Japan‚Äôs Eri Yonamine has made an early break from the 
peloton, but there‚Äôs no immediate reaction from the chasing pack. Little 
wonder, with 133 kms remaining.
 
They‚Äôre off! It looks swelteringly hot and, as the riders make their way 
around the wide, open roads of Qatar‚ÄôsEducation City 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_City>, the peloton looks loose and 
relaxed. No surprise there. These are not the conditions in which to make a 
flying start.
 
Good morning and welcome. If you like your sport laced with dramatic subplots, 
you‚Äôve come to the right place. While the competitors in this year‚Äôs women‚Äôs 
road race world championships will have their eyes firmly on the prize, the 
contest promises a host of potentially spellbinding sideshows and minor-key 
dramas. British interest will focus on Lizzie Deignan, the reigning champion, 
who is approaching the 134.5km course around Doha as‚Äúthe last weekend of a 
tough year‚Äù 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/14/lizzie-deignan-urges-cycling-world-governing-body-to-clarify-rules-on-theraputic-use-exemptions>
 defined by hersuccessful appeal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/01/rio-2016-lizzie-armitstead-court-appeal-olympics>
 against a doping ban in the prelude to the Olympics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 
the controversy in which she became embroiled after missing three tests under 
the whereabouts rule has taken a mental toll on Deignan, and the noises 
emanating from her camp ‚Äì not to mention the rider herself ‚Äì suggest the 
combined effects of fatigue and an unfavourable course may be too much to 
handle.

But it‚Äôs not all about Deignan. A flat course with no climbs will inevitably 
favour the sprinters, which makes Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands the woman to 
beat. Australia‚Äôs Chloe Hosking, who in July sped to a brilliant La Course 
victory on the Champs √âlys√©es, has been preparing for the sweltering conditions 
in the Qatar capital bytransforming her bathroom into a temporary sauna 
<http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cycling/uci-road-race-world-championships-20161009-grycps.html>
; she‚Äôs no slouch either. Ditto Marianne Vos, anotherformer La Course winner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/27/lizzie-armitstead-marianne-vos-la-course>
, who has no fewer than seven sprint victories to her name this year. And let‚Äôs 
not forget her Dutch compatriot, Annemiek van Vleuten, whocrashed out of the 
Olympic road race 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/annemiek-van-vleuten-intensive-care-olympic-road-race>
 in such horrific fashion but ‚Äì having recovered from a cracked spine ‚Äì is fit 
and raring to go again. What a story it would be if she could win today.

All that, and we haven‚Äôt even mentioned Olympic champion Anna van der Breggen, 
or the Belgian speedster Jolien D‚ÄôHoore. It should be quite a race.
