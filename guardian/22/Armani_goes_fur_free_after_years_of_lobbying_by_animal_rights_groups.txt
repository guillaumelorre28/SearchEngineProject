The Italian designer Giorgio Armani has agreed to stop using fur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/mar/01/animal-campaigners-protest-fur-fashion>
 for all his products following years of lobbying by animal rights activists.

Armani, 81, said in a statement on Tuesday that new technologies “render the 
use of cruel practices unnecessary as regards animals” and that the decision 
reflected his luxury group’s attention to “the critical issues of protecting 
and caring for the environment and animals”.

The Armani group, which includes catwalk labels Giorgio Armani and Emporio 
Armani, AJ Armani Jeans and homeware brand Armani Casa, will be fur-free from 
the autumn/winter 2016 collection.

Joh Vinding, chairman of the Fur Free Alliance, said the announcement “makes 
it clear that designers and consumers can have creative freedom and luxury, all 
without supporting animal cruelty”.

The Humane Society International called Armani’s pledge “probably the most 
powerful message yet thatkilling animals for their fur is never fashionable 
<http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2016/03/armani-fur-free-032216.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/>
”, adding that designers who continue to use fur “are looking increasingly 
isolated”.

Armani joins Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren in 
switching to synthetic alternatives, while British designerStella McCartney has 
long followed a “vegetarian” philosophy

, shunning fur, leather and feathers.
