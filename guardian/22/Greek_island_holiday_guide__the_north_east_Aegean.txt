Some islands fall easily into groups, others are left hanging and are gathered 
into more arbitrary designations. The latter is true of the north-east Aegean, 
which includes a hodgepodge of islands stretching from lush Samos in the south 
– just off the coast of Turkey – up to Thassos, 400km to the north and closer 
to Bulgaria than it is to Athens.

In between are an isolated stretch of islands, often far apart from each other 
and not well connected. Perhaps because of this, and the difficulty of 
labelling them easily together, these islands are often overlooked. For those 
prepared to travel a bit further afield, this is a bonus as, apart from 
midsummer, they tend to be uncrowded and unspoilt.

Samos is the nearest thing this group gets to “well-known destination”, but it 
is still more easily reached from Turkey than most of the rest of Greece. It 
does have its resorts but is big and diverse enough to still reward visitors. 
It is probably the most instantly attractive of the group.

Heading west, little Fourni is getting increasing recognition as an “unspoilt” 
gem, and still deserves the reputation. Larger Ikaria is a different kettle of 
fish and, while not immediately pretty, is worth exploring: the locals have an 
independent and proud streak that sets them apart.

Chios and Lesbos also hug the Turkish coast. The former has a long and often 
tragic history but hides many beautiful places away from its couple of beach 
resorts. Lesbos is one of the biggest of all the Greek islands, and a long 
visit and exploration will reveal why it is still beloved by artists, 
historians and modernSapphos <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho>.

In the north is a scattering of volcanic islands that remain off-the-beaten 
track. Limnos has become trendy, especially among mainland Greeks, but remains 
beautiful and authentic. Samothrace is one of the most dramatic of the Greek 
islands and is home to a stunning and world-class ancient site. And if you want 
to see how Greeks party, Thassos is your place.

All prices are for one week’s accommodation for two in August, and include 
breakfast unless otherwise stated. Prices outside of this month can be 
considerably cheaper. Greek taverna prices are remarkably similar and, if 
anything, have gone down in the last few years. You can usually expect to eat 
well for €15-€20 per head. If places are cheaper or more expensive than this, 
it is stated in the text.

Armonia Bay
This is exactly what you hope for from a Greek island hotel. The simple rooms 
are large and tastefully done, and most have balconies with great views down to 
the beach, which is a five-minute stroll away – although there’s a pool if you 
can’t manage that. The hospitality is relaxed and friendly.

Nikos
For a little island, Fourni has a surprisingly large permanent population 
(which gives it a more dynamic atmosphere than some). The key to this is its 
large fishing fleet, which means the island’s seafood tavernas are first class.

choice. Lobster pasta is an island speciality.

If anything this taverna’s terrace has even better views, and the hearty meals 
carry on the theme of value for money. Also, you can’t help but be tempted to 
follow the river canyon below to the sheltered cove itself, which is surrounded

The Ikarians like to do things differently. The four villages of Raches are 
linked by a well-mapped hiking trail, something that is becoming more common in 
Greece. They also run on “Ikarian time”. The villagers sleep for much of the 
day, then open up their shops and tavernas for most of the night.

Samothrace is a visually stunning island and there is nowhere better to 
appreciate this than the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. This cult was worshipped 
here for over 1,000 years, and the site still evokes awe in the visitor.

Thassos

Thassos can be on the lively side, so it can be nice to get away from it all. 
This hotel dominates the quiet and attractive hilltop village of Panayia. It’s 
bright yellow buildings are set round a terrace of plane trees and a 
carp-filled pools, while inside the simple rooms have terraces with great views.

Thassos is a destination for Greeks (especially those from Thessaloniki) who 
are looking for entertainment. The island is overpopulated with bouzouki bars, 
and it’s worth giving them a go, even if only for one night. Ideally go with 
Greek friends and don’t expect to be home before dawn and without a fair amount 
of whisky inside you.

Getting to the north-east Aegean

The larger, southern islands of the chain can be reached by ferry from Athens, 
and plane from Athens and other places in Greece. In summer, charter flights 
run from abroad. Limnos can be reached from Thessaloniki by ferry. The two 
northern islands of Thassos and Samothrace are a more difficult prospect. 
Ferries run from the northern mainland ports of Kavala and Alexandropouli 
respectively.
