Since the first colonisers landed on the continent, photography has been 
complicit in creating many of the modern myths aboutAfrica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa>.

But as an increasing number of young artists get behind the lens to tell their 
own stories, the view of the 54 countries is changing.


In Lagos, Nigeria, a hotbed of art, music and fashion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/oct/27/lagos-fashion-and-design-week-opens-in-pictures>
, this week marks the beginning of LagosPhoto, one of the continent’s largest 
annual photography festivals.

Described as month-long celebration “challenging prevalent images of 
Afro-pessimism”, the photographers included in exhibition and events across the 
city defy the global media’s focus on Africa “as a continent of the desperate”.

experience’​

Launched in 2010, participants say the festival helps showcase the quality of 
new work emerging from the continent, while allowing artists to meet and 
support each other.

Fati Abubakar, a photographer working in northern Nigeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria>, said: “You meet people from all 
over the world who teach you a lot about cultures, their experience as 
photographers, [their] challenges,” she says. “It is very necessary for us to 
not only to support [each other] but to critically assess each other so we can 
be better.”

Ishola Akpo, from Benin <https://www.theguardian.com/world/benin>, agrees: 
“Meetings such as these are essential [...] they really help to nourish our 
work and develop new perspectives.”

Abubakar and Akpo are among 10 promising young African photographers showing 
at LagosPhoto, working to change the way the next generation sees Africa.

Abubakar finds stories of beauty and resistance in the most unexpected places. 
She has taken her camera to some of Nigeria’s most dangerous regions, including
Maiduguri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/clubbing-birthplace-boko-haram-maiduguri-nigeria>
, in the northern Borno State, where she grew up, which is now better known as 
the “birthplace of Boko Haram”.

At Lagos Photo, Abubakar is presenting The Face, a series of portraits from 
remote, rural locations in Nigeria, where despite poor living conditions, 
people still “find a sense of integrity and beauty, thriving in the midst of 
adversity”.

Photograph: Ishola Akpo 
Working in Benin, the photographer and multimedia artist Akpo focuses on the 
subject of bridal dowries in the Yoruba and Nago communities.

The symbolism of the dowry, originally one of allegiance – seen as a way of 
joining families, tribes and ethnicities – is now often only a financial 
exchange, and in his series L’Essentiel est Invisible pour les Yeux, Akpo 
presents objects given as part of his own grandmother’s dowry – including 
pearls, mirror and bottles of gin.

Mixing the high-gloss luxury of fashion photography and the refined approach 
of classical portraiture, Lakin Ogunbanwo’s stripped-back portraits blur the 
line between advertising and art. Born and based in Lagos, the 29-year-old 
trained as a lawyer but started taking photographs while he was still studying.

The career change paid off, and his work is now part of the new advertising 
and fashion industry thriving in Nigeria. Internationally, he has featured in 
Harper’s Bazaar, GQ and Dazed & Confused magazines among others. In 2015, he 
was named as one of the British Journal of Photography’s top 25 photographers.

Tsoku Maela 
Based in Cape Town, the photographer and film-maker Tsoku Maela turned to 
photography as a way of dealing with depression and anxiety. His series of 
self-portraits about mental illness, Abstract Peaces, addressed a topic treated 
as taboo in South Africa.

In Lagos, the artist is presenting works from his series Broken Things, which 
he says features two characters who learn to love themselves, despite their 
flaws. For Maela, “the greatest form of acceptance is self-acceptance. But it’s 
not out there, somewhere, waiting to be found. It’s right here where you stand, 
and wherever you will go, as it always begins and ends with us.”

 Gyamfi re-enacts memories from his childhood in his self-portraits. 
Photograph: Eric Gyamfi 
Gyamfi’s photographs shed light on social tensions around gender and sexuality 
inGhana <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ghana>. Interested in people who 
have suffered exclusion or been labelled as minorities in their communities in 
the past and present, Gyamfi’s work began with self-portraits in which he 
re-enacted memories from his own childhood as a way to examine his sexual 
identity and position in relation to the myth of masculinity.

For his series Witches of Gambaga, Gyamfi visited a “witches’ camp” in 
northern Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2010/nov/25/witches-gambaga-ghana>
 where 130 women aged between 17 and 90 who have been found guilty of 
witchcraft live. They can only be freed if a family member pays a ransom of one 
sheep and three hens to the camp’s chief.

“These women, broken as they were from their individual traumatic experiences, 
pressed on daily with such resilience and beauty, in the face of all the 
devastation that engulfed them inside-out. It was this beauty and strength I 
wanted to paint back to them,” Gyamfi says.

connect with his roots: raised in Belgium, he began to take pictures in his 
father’s homeland during the presidential elections in 2011. His portraits 
capture events in the DRC – families in their homes, church ceremonies, 
nightlife and celebrations – that are not often seen in the international 
media, and confront the photographer’s own perception of the country.

“For us, women, we can’t just make art to look pretty and successfully hang on 
a wall at home or in a museum. It needs to demand respect, debates, confusion 
and experiment with tradition,” says Keyezua.

At LagosPhoto, the Angolan artist is presenting a series of works, Royal 
Generation, in which a model wears clothes made by hand from raw materials 
using traditional basket-making techniques..

LagosPhoto runs until 21 November
