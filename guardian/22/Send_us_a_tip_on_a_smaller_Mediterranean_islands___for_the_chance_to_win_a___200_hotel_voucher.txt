For summer’s last knockings where better to head than an island in the 
Mediterranean? Tell us about things to do and see, and great beaches, 
restaurants, and places to stay on smaller islands (not the likes of Sicily, 
Ibiza and Crete) right across the Med – off Spain in the west right across to 
Turkey and Greece in the east.

Send us your specific tips via GuardianWitness 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/>, with as much detail as you can (and 
including website and prices etc, if possible) inaround 100 words.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
fromUK.hotels.com <https://uk.hotels.com/>, allowing you to stay in more than 
260,000 places worldwide. Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using 
the text tab.

You’re welcome to add a photo if you own the copyright to it – but it’s the 
text we’ll be judging.
