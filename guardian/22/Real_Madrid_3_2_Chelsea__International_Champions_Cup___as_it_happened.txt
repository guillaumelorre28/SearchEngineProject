Full time: Real Madrid 3-2 Chelsea

And there’s the whistle. The scoreline will make it look closer than it was, 
consideringReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> more 
or less sent on their youth team when the score was 3-nil. But it’s nice 
consolation nonetheless for Chelsea, who today played before a bigger crowd 
than ever before in their 102-year history.

87 min: We have two pitch invaders at Michigan Stadium, including one who’s 
doing quite some job evading the three police officers in pursuit. Surely the 
referee will account for the break in play in stoppage time.

42 min: Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> on the attack 
for the first time in what seems like ages, but it doesn’t last long. They’re 
dispossessed and Cahill is shown yellow when he hacks down a Real player on the 
counter-attack.

40 min: Another iffy challenge from Pedro along the touchline and the referee 
wants a word. He’s already on a yellow ... but it looks as if he’ll get away 
with a stern talking-to.

GOAL! Real Madrid 3-0 Chelsea (Mariano, 37 min)

Seven quick passes in the build-up before the ball ends at Mariano’s foot and 
he immediately cracks a shot from outside the area past the outstretched arms 
of Begovic. Friendly or not, a jaw-dropping goal from the 22-year-old. Wow.
 Mariano Diaz celebrates his goal, while Gary Cahill can’t believe his eyes.

28 min: It appears Traore handled the ball there. He’s shown yellow so the

23 min: The free kick is sent in and nearly headed into the goal by Varane, 
but Begovic is there to parry it over the cross bar. More poor set-piece 
defending, this time from the Blues.

GOAL! Real Madrid 1-0 Chelsea (Marcelo, 19 min)

Well that was strange. Marcelo dribbles past two defenders before ripping a

defender and above the helpless Begovic into the goal.

13 min: Traore finds Pedro in space but the Spaniard gives it away poorly 
along the left flank. A squandered chance, that.

11 min: Oscar with a clattering challenge in the midfield but the referee says 
play on despite Real’s complaints. He’s looks quite good playing in a deeper 
role today so far.

5 min: Now it’s Real on the attack and forcing Begovic into emergency action 
but the threat is defused. And now an email from Shaun:

record attendance? there were 109,318 for the Manchester United game in Ann 
Arbor in 2014. can’t remember who we played....

They’re saying today’s crowd “could be” because it’s an unconfirmed number 
that may exceed the attendance for the Man U friendly. Guess we’ll find out 
later on today. In the end it’s all just carnival barking, innit?

A reported crowd of 106,000 are on hand for today’s friendly. Apparently that 
could be a record for a soccer match in the United States. A confirmed number 
will be circulated during the second half and we’ll be sure to share it with 
you.

About 10 minutes to kickoff. Looks like Luka Modric is a Tom Brady fan. Brady 
played for the Wolverines from 1995 to 1999, finally winning the starting job 
as a junior.

It’s been a busy week for the grounds staff at Michigan Stadium. They’ve been 
charged with replacing the artificial FieldTurf with real grass ahead of 
today’s friendly. The first of more than 25 loads of sod arrived Monday and 
were laid on top of the artificial surface.

Hello and welcome to today’s friendly between Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> and Chelsea at Michigan 
Stadium.The 107,601-seat home of the Michigan Wolverines – the second largest 
venue on the planet after North Korea’s Rungrado 1st of May Stadium – is a 
fitting stage for two of the world’s biggest clubs as they continue their 
pre-season preparations.

Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> have already played 
three pre-season friendlies in addition to their International Champions Cup 
opener: a 1-0 win over Liverpool on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Real Madrid opened 
their pre-season earlier this week with a 3-1 defeat against Paris 
Saint-Germain.

Plenty more to come from Ann Arbor.

Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s the latest on Real Madrid’s 
coy courtship of Paul Pogba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/27/zinedine-zidane-real-madrid-interest-paul-pogba-manchester-united>
.

Zinedine Zidane <https://www.theguardian.com/football/zinedine-zidane> has 
hinted Real Madrid could move for Paul Pogba despite Manchester United’s 
willingness to pay a world record fee for the midfielder.

United have been pursuing Pogba all summer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/24/manchester-united-paul-pogba-transfer>
 and would contemplate a £100m fee or more for the 23-year-old. Yet Real are 
Pogba’s preferred choice and if his personal terms and the price demanded by 
Juventus are met by them United face losing out.

Zidane said: “I don’t know if he will come. Until 31 August anything can 
happen. Everyone is interested in Pogba. He is a great footballer and when you 
are Madrid you always want the best. But now he is not aReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> player, he is a Juventus 
player. I can’t say anything more.”

If Pogba were to sign for Real it would be a significant disappointment for 
José Mourinho.

Real Madrid see off Chelsea before 105,826 at Michigan Stadium

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/30/real-madrid-beat-chelsea-michigan-stadium> 
And there’s the whistle. The scoreline will make it look closer than it was, 
consideringReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> more 
or less sent on their youth team when the score was 3-nil. But it’s nice 
consolation nonetheless for Chelsea, who today played before a bigger crowd 
than ever before in their 102-year history.
 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> catch Real’s youngsters 
out of position and Hazard beats the keeper in a one-on-one at the end of a 
quick counter-attack and they’ve closed it to 3-2.
 
90 min: Fourth official signals for two minutes of stoppage time. 
 
87 min: We have two pitch invaders at Michigan Stadium, including one who’s 
doing quite some job evading the three police officers in pursuit. Surely the 
referee will account for the break in play in stoppage time.

<https://twitter.com/EvanPetzold/status/759492218772217856>  
85 min: Batshuayi’s effort sails wide of the goal. Moments later he’s denied 
again after receiving a well-worked pass from Moses.
 
84 min: Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> win another 
free kick on the edge of the area. Looks like Batshuayi will take it.
 
A strange miscommunication finds the keeper way out of position as a long ball 
falls to Hazard, who simply deposits it into the gaping net.
 
79 min: Hazard’s free kick sails over the crossbar. Just one of those days for 
the Blues.
 
78 min: Enzo Zidane, the manager’s son, gets a handful of Moses’ shirt and 
finds himself in the referee’s book. A free kick here forChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> on the edge of the area.
 
76 min: The Nigerian winger Victor Moses comes on for Traore.
 
74 min: Signs of life from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> as the ball is worked up the 
right flank. Traore finds Batshuayi, whose shot to the far post from the edge 
of the area skids wide.
 
69 min: Mariano Diaz has a go from distance but it sails wide right of the 
post.
 
67 min: The official attendance for today’s match is 105,826, which is the 
second largest crowd to ever watch a soccer match in the United States.
 
64 min: Six Real players are coming off as Yañez, Tejero, Lienhart, Llorente, 
Ødegaard and Enzo Zidane enter.
 
61 min: We’re just past the hour mark and it looks like Real is about to send 
in a small army of subs, many of fresh-faced variety. Looks like the youth team 
will be getting some run today.
 
59 min: Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> with their best 
chances in ages as Chalobah releases Traore with the keeper Casilla badly out 
of position, but the shot is blocked by Nacho.
 
57 min: Casemiro shown yellow for a foul from behind. Real seem to have scaled 
back the intensity in the early going here, comfortable as they are with a 
3-nil lead.
 
52 min: Cuadrado’s effort is way off the mark and Real will have a goal kick. 
Moments laterChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are on the 
attack again with Cuadrado surging up the right flank, but he’s fouled, giving 
the Real players time to return into position.
 
51 min: Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> win a free kick 
near the top of the area. Can they pull one back here? Cuadrado to take it.
 
48 min: Courtois, Chalobah, Cuadrado and Batshuayi are on for Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, replacing Begovic, Oscar, 
Willian and Loftus-Cheek. Only one for Real Madrid: Danilo comes on for Dani 
Carvajal.
 
46 min: And the second half is underway. We’ll catch you up with the subs as 
soon as we’re up to speed.
 
Did someone say half-time substitutions? It looks like the Michigan ice hockey 
team is rearing to go. Though it’s doubtful they’ll be needed given how many 
playersReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> brought to 
America (30!).

<https://twitter.com/leonkal/status/759478554392399872>  
Changes expected at half-time. Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard are likely to 
come on per Antonio Conte’s remarks yesterday.
 
A Marcelo brace and a moment of brilliance from Mariano and Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are three up on the hapless 
Blues.
 
45 min: Fourth official signals for one minute of stoppage time.
 
42 min: Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> on the attack 
for the first time in what seems like ages, but it doesn’t last long. They’re 
dispossessed and Cahill is shown yellow when he hacks down a Real player on the 
counter-attack.
 
40 min: Another iffy challenge from Pedro along the touchline and the referee 
wants a word. He’s already on a yellow ... but it looks as if he’ll get away 
with a stern talking-to.
 
Seven quick passes in the build-up before the ball ends at Mariano’s foot and 
he immediately cracks a shot from outside the area past the outstretched arms 
of Begovic. Friendly or not, a jaw-dropping goal from the 22-year-old. Wow.
 Mariano Diaz celebrates his goal, while Gary Cahill can’t believe his eyes.

@BryanAGraham <https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham> Real Madrid won't score a 
goal today. Book it and post this on your website and let everyone cash in on 
Chelsea !!!!

<https://twitter.com/BitcoinProtect/status/759468354818023424> 
But do they have any stock tips?
 
34 min: More poor defending by Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> and Real break through and 
nearly make it 3-nil – but they’re saved by the offside flag!
 
33 min: Shortly after the Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> corner comes to nothing, 
Pedro is shown yellow for a tackle from behind on Marco Asensio.
 
29 min: Casemiro takes the kick and blasts it around the wall. Begovic does 
well to turn it away and Real will have a corner.
 
28 min: It appears Traore handled the ball there. He’s shown yellow so the 
referee must have believed there was intent. More pressingly Real will have a 
free kick from the top of the area.
 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> concede in the middle 
third, Marcelo wins the tackle, receives a pass from a team-mate and rumbles 
with the ball into the area before booting it past Begovic for his second goal 
of the afternoon.
 
23 min: The free kick is sent in and nearly headed into the goal by Varane, 
but Begovic is there to parry it over the cross bar. More poor set-piece 
defending, this time from the Blues.
 
22 min: Lucas Vazquez hacked down by Gary Cahill and Real will have a free 
kick from a reasonably good position about 25 feet outside the area.
 
20 min: An eerily quiet crowd today given the size.
 
Well that was strange. Marcelo dribbles past two defenders before ripping a 
shot from outside the area with his weaker (right) foot. It deflects off a 
defender and above the helpless Begovic into the goal.
 
15 min: Nacho somehow avoids the referee’s book despite a reckless challenge 
on Traore near the halfway line.
 
13 min: Traore finds Pedro in space but the Spaniard gives it away poorly 
along the left flank. A squandered chance, that.
 
11 min: Oscar with a clattering challenge in the midfield but the referee says 
play on despite Real’s complaints. He’s looks quite good playing in a deeper 
role today so far.
 
9 min: A bit of a lackluster start. Pedro has a go from distance but it’s 
easily corralled by Casilla.
 
5 min: Now it’s Real on the attack and forcing Begovic into emergency action 
but the threat is defused. And now an email from Shaun:

record attendance? there were 109,318 for the Manchester United game in Ann 
Arbor in 2014. can’t remember who we played....

They’re saying today’s crowd “could be” because it’s an unconfirmed number 
that may exceed the attendance for the Man U friendly. Guess we’ll find out 
later on today. In the end it’s all just carnival barking, innit?
 
3 min: Willian’s effort is sent in to John Terry, who nearly puts it in for an 
early goal! Alas, he can’t quite control it and it’s out for a goal kick. Very 
disorganized defending fromReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> early.
 
2 min: Chelsea win a free kick early. Willian to take it.
 
1 min: And we’re off! Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> in classic all-white kits 
attacking from right to left, Chelsea in their new dark away strips going from 
left to right.
 
And the players are emerging from the tunnel. Not much longer now. No Ronaldo 
or Benzema forReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> – 
they’re listed as injured – nor Bale, who is recovering from the Euros. Chelsea 
is down Cesc Fabregas after his red card against Liverpool on Wednesday
 
A reported crowd of 106,000 are on hand for today’s friendly. Apparently that 
could be a record for a soccer match in the United States. A confirmed number 
will be circulated during the second half and we’ll be sure to share it with 
you.
 
Michigan Stadium is nearly full as kickoff draws near. No small feat! Some

three pre-season friendlies in addition to their International Champions Cup 
opener: a 1-0 win over Liverpool on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Real Madrid opened 
their pre-season earlier this week with a 3-1 defeat against Paris 
Saint-Germain.

Plenty more to come from Ann Arbor.
 
Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s the latest on Real Madrid’s 
coy courtship of Paul Pogba

.

Zinedine Zidane <https://www.theguardian.com/football/zinedine-zidane> has 
hinted Real Madrid could move for Paul Pogba despite Manchester United’s 
willingness to pay a world record fee for the midfielder.

United have been pursuing Pogba all summer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/24/manchester-united-paul-pogba-transfer>
 and would contemplate a £100m fee or more for the 23-year-old. Yet Real are 
Pogba’s preferred choice and if his personal terms and the price demanded by 
Juventus are met by them United face losing out.

Zidane said: “I don’t know if he will come. Until 31 August anything can 
happen. Everyone is interested in Pogba. He is a great footballer and when you 
are Madrid you always want the best. But now he is not aReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> player, he is a Juventus 
player. I can’t say anything more.”

If Pogba were to sign for Real it would be a significant disappointment for 
José Mourinho.
