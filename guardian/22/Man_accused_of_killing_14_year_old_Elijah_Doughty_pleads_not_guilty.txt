The man appeared in Stirling Gardens magistrates’ court in Perth on Wednesday 
via video link from an undisclosed location where he pleaded not guilty to 
manslaughter as members of Elijah’s family watched.

Defence counsel Seamus Rafferty said his client offered to plead guilty to the 
lesser charge of dangerous driving occasioning death, but it was rejected by 
the prosecution. He said the offer remained.

Prosecutors are seeking for the trial to be held in Perth. The man is 
scheduled to appear in the WA supreme court in February.
