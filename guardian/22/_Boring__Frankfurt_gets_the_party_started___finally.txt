Next Thursday, locals and tourists alike will flock to an annual street party 
held in Frankfurt’s station quarter (8 September from 7pm).Bahnhorsviertelnacht 
<http://www.bahnhofsviertel-ffm.de/> will see streets closed to traffic, and 
bars and restaurants becoming live music venues. Some brothels and strip clubs 
will even operate an open door policy, allowing people inside to nose around. 
It certainly doesn’t reinforce the popular notion that Frankfurt is boring.

Railway stations and their seedy surroundings are rarely worth hanging about 
in for long. But these days, the area once known solely for its red light 
district is attracting crowds year-round, as it cements its reputation as one 
of the city’s most interesting areas, with a string of new restaurants, 
galleries and clubs. And with the city council committed to keeping the red 
light district here, the blend of rough edges and cultural hotspots produces an 
environment that is vibrant, varied and irreverent.

 Pizzeria Montana 
“What makes it interesting is that everybody just minds their own business,” 
says James Ardinast who, along with his brother David, has launched a series of 
ventures in the area, most recently Stanley Diamond <http://stanleydiamond.com/>
 (Ottostrasse 16-18), an upscale restaurant with creative takes on wiener 
schnitzel and classic fish dishes. Just behind the railway station and named 
after a New York gangster, it mixes fine white table cloths and retro decor, 
with the front completely open to the street, and offers great cocktails and a 
hefty wine list (ask the sommelier to recommend some of the German ones).

Earlier this year, a group of DJs began holding impromptu performances in a 
laundromat. The hum of creativy can also be felt in theTaunusstrasse Arts and 
Bites <http://tab-ffm.de/> monthly art market in the Kaiserpassage, which 
started last year and theAsian Arts Centre <http://www.aac-frankfurt.com/> 
(Wilhelm-Leuschner-Strasse 17) – another gallery space – opened in June. While 
on Gutleutstrasse, an abandoned building is being converted into artist 
studios. “It feels like there is a new place opening every week,” Ardinast says.

The neon sign on the Pizzeria Montana <http://www.montana-pizzeria.de/> 
(Weserstrasse 14), which opened last year, is a work of art by the party-loving 
German sculptor Tobias Rehberger reading “Free Parking, Free Coffee, Freedom”. 
TheGalerie Rundgaenger <http://www.rundgaenger.de/> (Niddastrasse 63) exhibits 
work by emerging German artists and others, just 100 metres away from a busy 
methadone clinic (during Bahnhorsviertelnacht it will show paintings by South 
Korean painterHa Nuk Jung <http://hanukjung.wixsite.com/hanuk>).

 Galerie Rundgaenger 
After dark, AMP <http://www.ampyourself.de/> (Gallusanlage 2), a cross between 
a cafe and a club, opened this summer overlooking a park and some of Europe’s 
tallest skyscrapers in the financial district beyond. Back closer to the 
railway station itself, theKarlson Club <http://www.karlson-club.de/> 
(Karlstrasse2) opened late last year and features DJs and live music.

But if you do have to catch a train, be sure to stop at Yok-Yok 
<http://prinz.de/frankfurt/locations/105882-yok-yok/> (Münchener Strasse 32). 
It looks like an average corner convenience store but actually sells 300 types 
of beer by the bottle. Grab one for your journey onwards.
