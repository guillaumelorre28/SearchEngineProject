The commander of the UN peacekeeping force in South Sudan has been dismissed 
by Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, after adamning report 
<http://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/executive-summary-independent-special-investigation-violence-which-occurred-juba>
 showed that the mission failed to protect civilians during summer violence in 
Juba.

A UN special investigation found that a lack of leadership by the the UN 
mission inSouth Sudan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-sudan> (Unmiss), 
spearheaded by Lt Gen Johnson Mogoa Kimani Ondieki, culminated in a “chaotic 
and ineffective response” during heavy fighting in the capital between 8 and 11 
July.

Peacekeepers abandoned their posts and failed to respond to pleas for help 
from aid workers under attack in a nearby hotel compound, according to a 
summary of the report.

The UN is now in discussions with member states on how to act on the report’s 
recommendation that countries involved in the policing aspect of the mission 
should send morefemale UN police officers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/women-better-peacekeepers-un-officers-think-so>
, said a spokesperson for the secretary general.

“We will start reaching out to members states exactly on this question of more 
female police contingents,” he said, citing the the example of Liberia, where 
an all-female unit washailed as a success

However, there was no word on when Ondieki would be replaced, or by whom. The 
UN secretary general’s office said it was in touch with Kenya but a replacement 
had yet to be identified.

Unmiss has 16,000 troops deployed in South Sudan, where there has been 
fighting between troops loyal to the president, Salva Kiir, and his former 
deputy, Riek Machar, since December 2013.

“The special investigation found that Unmiss did not respond effectively to 
the violence due to an overall lack of leadership, preparedness and integration 
among the various components of the mission,” said UN spokesman Stéphane 
Dujarric.

Chinese peacekeepers abandoned their positions at least twice and Nepalese 
peacekeepers failed to stop looting inside the UN compound, the inquiry found.

Ban said he was “deeply distressed by these findings” and “alarmed by the 
serious shortcomings” of the UN mission.

Dujarric said the UN chief had “asked for the immediate replacement of the 
force commander”, Ondieki. Other measures would follow, added Dujarric.

Ondieki, from Kenya, had been the force commander since May

Margrethe Løj of Denmark steps down at the end of November after more than two 
years in the job.

About a dozen aid workers and UN staff housed at the Terrain hotel compound 
were attacked by South Sudanese soldiers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/un-peacekeepers-refused-to-help-south-sudan-rebels-raped-aid-workers-report>
on 11 July. Peacekeepers just over 1km away failed to come to their aid despite 
multiple requests from China, Ethiopia, India and Nepal for forces to be 
dispatched.

The report noted that “each Unmiss contingent turned down the request, 
indicating their troops were fully committed”. During the attack, “civilians 
were subjected to and witnessed gross human rights violations, including 
murder, intimidation, sexual violence and acts amounting to torture perpetrated 
by armed government soldiers,” said the report.

The investigation, led by retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert, was unable 
to verify allegations that peacekeepers did nothing to help women who were 
raped during the heavy fighting.

But in a later incident on 2 September, a woman was assaulted near the 
entrance to a UN compound “in plain sight” of the peacekeepers, the report said.

“Despite the woman’s screams, they did not react” and other UN staff 
intervened, the report added.

After the crisis, peacekeepers “continued to display a risk-averse posture 
unsuited to protecting civilians from sexual violence” and other attacks.

Unmiss soldiers refused to conduct foot patrols near UN bases and instead 
would “peer out from the tiny windows of armoured personnel carriers, an 
approach ill-suited to detecting perpetrators of sexual violence and engaging 
with communities to provide a sense of security”.

British ambassador Matthew Rycroft described the report as a “damning 
indictment” and said the security council as well as the UN system must draw 
lessons from the failures.

Evan Cinq-Mars, an expert on the UN and policy adviser at the US-based Center 
for Civilians in Conflict <http://civiliansinconflict.org/> (Civic), said the 
report was particularly significant in naming the specific contingents who were 
found to have underperformed.

“In general, there needs to be more meaningful accountability when it comes to 
the failures of UN peacekeepers to protect civilians,” he said.

“That could include rotating out the contingents and individual personnel 
responsible. This should happen, and missions shouldn’t have the same 
peacekeepers deployed who have failed to protect civilians..”

“In general too with peacekeeping missions, there has been a larger issue of 
not having enough women in uniform 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/07/war-disproportionately-affects-women-female-peacekeepers-fiona-hodgson>
. More have to be recruited and deployed.”

A Civic report 
<http://civiliansinconflict.org/resources/pub/under-fire-the-july-2016-violence-in-juba-and-un-response>
 on the violence in Juba found nothing new in the UN’s flawed response. The 
organisation previously investigated a February incident in which peacekeepers 
fromEthiopia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ethiopia>, India and Rwanda 
stood by as government soldiers attacked another protection of civilians site 
in the northern town of Malakal, killing at least 30 people.

The UN security council is set to discuss the crisis in South Sudan on 17 
November.


In July, community leaders also reported that more than 120 women were raped 
over the course of a few days, a figure that tallied with the number of cases 
documented by the UN. Several rape survivors said soldiers camped along the 
road leading past the UN camp attacked women. Most of the women were members of 
the Nuer community, the ethnic group of opposition leader Machar.
