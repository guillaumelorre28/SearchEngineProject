Explore by bike

With parking near impossible and bike lanes aplenty, cycling is definitely the 
best way to get from A to B. Get a rear-fitted child seat, or seat them up 
front in a cargo-tricycle, called abakfiets, with seats and safety belts. Plan 
an itinerary including the 400-year-old canals and houseboats, the flower 
market and the busy docks.
• Bikes from 10€ a day, bakfiets 25€. MacBike (+31 20 620 0985, macbike.nl/en

Hit the library

Perfect for a rainy day, the city's Openbare Bibliotheek is the largest 
library in Europe, spread over seven floors in a cutting-edge building on the 
waterfront. An entire floor is dedicated to children, with hundreds of books, 
colourful contemporary oversized furniture to clamber over and regular story 
times (including in English). With free membership for under-19s, teens will 
enjoy the movies, music and free internet access on the 600-odd computers. 
Another must is the seventh-floor cafeteria deck for the best skyline views – 
and sociable pigeons!

Let loose in Vondelpark

Amsterdam's beautiful 116-acre central park is paradise for little ones. 
There's an outdoor theatre with free children's shows in summer, duck ponds and 
six playgrounds. The one near the Groot Melkhuis cafe has a dizzying array of 
slides, swings and rides, plus a sandpit, and a cafe for parents to indulge in 
tea or cake. The playground opposite the Melkhuis also has a water feature kids 
can paddle in on warmer days.
• Entrance off Van Baerlestraat, Open daily 8am-5pm,

Commute for fun

For the best views, take the GVB commuter ferry from behind Central Station 
across the Ij river to Amsterdam Noord. Absolutely free, it offers plenty to 
see, from the digital clocks counting down to departure to the frenzy of the 
bikes' last-minute-dash. Toddlers will love riding the trams, too. They're free 
for under-fours, and €2.80 adult fares are valid for an hour.

Museums for minis

The Neerlandia building on Nieuwe Herengracht is now Amsterdam's Hermitage 
museum for children () with exhibits and workshops for kids. And the Van Gogh 
Museum (under-sixes free) has a free treasure hunt (with gift on completion) 
and colouring pages. If you prefer to stay outdoors, Museumplein, in front of 
the magnificent Rijksmuseum, is an ideal spot for a picnic and a go at scaling 
the giant red "I AMsterdam" sign. Cool off afterwards in the Hide and Seek 
fountain.
