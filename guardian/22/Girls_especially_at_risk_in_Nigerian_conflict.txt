) rightly highlights the urgent need for humanitarian action to help those at 
risk of starvation in north-east Nigeria. We know from our work on the ground 
that tens of thousands of children will be at risk of starvation, abuse and 
death unless the international community takes immediate and coordinated 
action. We welcome the UN’s efforts in doubling its funding appeal for 
north-east Nigeria. But we also need to ensure that equal priority is given to 
girls caught up in the conflict. They make up one-third of the 2.6 million 
people who have been forced to flee their homes due to violence. For these 
girls, sexual abuse and forced marriage are real dangers that routinely 
threaten their lives. If we are to ensure the protection, survival and dignity 
of women and girls caught up in conflict, then as well as providing food, water 
and shelter, the humanitarian community must address sexual violence from the 
onset of its response.
