 A tyre service ad featuring two women in skin-tight catsuits with the tagline 
“we’re into rubber” is the most complained-about ad this year.

The Ultra Tune ad appeared three times in the Advertising 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/advertising> Standards Bureau’s top-10 list 
released on Tuesday, for ads criticised for sexism, sexual degradation and 
discrimination.

Another ad that drew the ire of viewers featured two women appearing helpless 
after their car stopped on a rail crossing in front of an oncoming train.

“Ultra Tune have routinely vilified and sexually objectified women in their 
ads; this portrayal of women has harmful consequences to the way women are 
treated and viewed in society,” Collective Shout spokeswoman Coralie Alison 
said.

“The code of ethics currently used by the advertising standards board does not 
include objectification of women or sexism, which we know is one of the 
cultural drivers behind violence against women.”

The “we’re into rubber” ad drew 418 complaints, topping the list for 2016 and 
coming second on the list of most complained-about ads on record.

It placed just behind an ad for adultery website Ashley Madison, which drew 
643 complaints.

A lamb ad, featuring SBS newsreader Lee Lin Chin ordering a James Bond-style 
mission to rescue Australians from other countries in a bid to let them to eat 
lamb on Australia Day, also drew a storm of complaints.

Despite placing second in the Top 10, which lists complaints according to the 
medium on which they are viewed, Meat & Livestock Australia’s lamb ad received 
the highest number of complaints overall at 747 across television, the internet 
and social media.

The Australia Day lamb ad stirring controversy with ‘Operation Boomerang’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jan/12/the-australia-day-lamb-ad-stirring-controversy-with-operation-boomerang-video>
The ASB dismissed the complaints 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/19/operation-boomerang-lamb-ad-cleared-by-advertising-standards-bureau>
 in its case report, saying that while some people thought it was in poor 
taste, “the issue of taste does not fall under the code of ethics”.

While most of the complaints for 2016 were dismissed, those upheld by the 
board required the advertiser to remove or alter the ad.
Alison said the bureau’s screening process was not strict enough.

“By the time the board makes a determination the ad has been up for a month 
already and has since been replaced by the advertiser,” she said. “For 
advertisers to be truly held accountable there should be penalties for 
breaching codes.”
