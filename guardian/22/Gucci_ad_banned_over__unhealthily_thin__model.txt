A Gucci <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> ad has been banned for 
featuring an “unhealthily thin” model.

The Italian fashion brand ran an online video ad featuring a number of models 
dancing to a soundtrack. The final part of the ad, which ran on the Times 
website in December, featured still photos of the individual models.

Gucci said the ad was aimed at an “older, sophisticated” audience and that the 
Times website was used as it provided an “adult and mature” readership.

The Advertising Standards Authority <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> 
received a complaint that the ad was irresponsible because the models were 
unhealthily thin.

Guccio Gucci, the parent company of the fashion brand, and the Times said that 
that the idea of an unhealthily thin model was to some extent a “subjective 
issue”. The fashion company said that the models had “slim builds” but were not 
depicted as “unhealthily thin”.

The images were shot to make sure none of the models’ bones were visible, 
which would accentuate thinness, and light rather than heavy makeup was used to 
stop the potential accentuation of thinness in features.

The ASA disagreed, saying that the ad irresponsibly showed a model with a body 
that was disproportionate and overly thin. “Further, her pose elongated her 
torso and accentuated her waist so that it appeared to be very small,” said the 
ASA. “We also considered that her sombre facial expression and dark makeup, 
particularly around her eyes, made her face look gaunt. For those reasons, we 
considered that the model leaning against the wall appeared to be unhealthily 
thin in the image, and therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible.”

The ASA told the Italian fashion company to make sure it used responsible 
images of models in its future ad campaigns.
