It’s not the first time that Justin Bieber has posed with his top off 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BAnGlBSgvuS/>. And it’s not the first time he has 
posed with a naked woman. But does this latest shot of the human meme suggest 
he has attained a new level of self-awareness?

In answer to Calvin Klein’s new fill in-the-blanks social media campaign (“I 
_________ in #mycalvins”), Bieber has replied “flaunt”.

Posing in your underwear next to a classical statue is a look that requires 
supreme confidence; the knowing arch of his eyebrows, the jaunty flex of his 
guns and the louche angle of his leg suggests Bieber knows he’s the full 
package.

In case you were thinking that’s all JB does in his briefs, you would be 
wrong. While the casual positioning of his right hand in this next shot might 
suggest an afternoon of solo delights, let’s be clear. He likes to “dream” too …

Calvin Klein recently shook things up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/17/cameron-dallas-draws-a-different-crowd-to-calvin-kleins-menswear-show>
 with an appearance from 21-year-old “internet personality” Cameron Dallas, who 
drew thousands of young fans not normally seen clamouring for selfies outside 
their Milan catwalk show. Online, the brand is widening its brief, with hip-hop 
starKendrick Lamar <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kendrick-lamar>, cult 
skateboarderMark Gonzales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/dec/05/rise-fall-skateboard-chic>
, British artistShantell Martin <http://www.shantellmartin.com/> and The Wire 
actor Tristan Wilds also featured in the #mycalvins campaign. Though if 
meme-able absurdity is the aim, it looks as though Bieber has already won.
