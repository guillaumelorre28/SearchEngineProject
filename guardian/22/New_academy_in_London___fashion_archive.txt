London, Wednesday.
A further attempt to make London the centre of fashion is just being made. 
This is the opening of a school of dress designers and modellers by the house of
 Reville <https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/933124>. A generation 
or so ago, when fashion artists were rare, dress designer Pilotelle 
<https://www.magnoliabox.com/products/a-pilotelle-fashion-plate-on-the-stage-xcf274388>
 ran a studio where students were taught to draw and design dresses, working 
from the actual fabrics, and getting a sound all-round training.

Since then fashion artists have hesitated between the art school and a 
dress-making training, and found combining both difficult. Henceforth they will 
be able to get “West End” training combined with drawing from the model, a 
study of the history of dress, and experience in cutting and fitting all under 
one roof. Later it is hoped to add textile designing to the course. The great 
need for this will be understood when it is realised that every model dress 
sold means the sale of thousands of yards of this same pattern fabric for 
making copies of this model, and it is the pattern of the fabric as much as the 
cut that sells the gown.

The linking of fashion with textile design should do much to help our textile 
trade. In 1933 the Society of Arts held its last group of competitions for 
designs for textiles, carpets, and furnishing fabrics, and in many sections the 
judges found it impossible to make an award. This would seem to show a great 
lack of originality, or perhaps an inability to link up designing with dress 
designing, among the competitors. Possibly by starting as dress designers and 
ending as textile designers the perfect result may be achieved.
