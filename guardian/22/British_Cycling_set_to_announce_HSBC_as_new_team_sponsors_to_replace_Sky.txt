HSBC is set to replace Sky as British Cycling’s lead sponsor and lead a 
renewed effort to turn Britain into a more bike-friendly nation.

Broadcaster Sky has been the governing body’s main commercial partner since 
2008 but announced last year that 2016 would be last year of its relationship.

Wiggins and Froome leaks raise familiar questions for cycling but do little 
else

The deal with the British-based global bank was first reported in the Daily 
Mail on Friday, which said it will be officially announced in Birmingham on 
Sunday at the first HSBC BikeFest, a free, city-centre ride on closed roads 
that has previously been part of the popular Sky Ride series.

A spokesman for British Cycling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-cycling> could not confirm that HSBC 
is the new partner, or disclose “any commercially sensitive details at this 
stage”, but the deal is understood to have been signed before the cycling 
team’s impressive performance at the Rio Olympics.

For a third successive Games, the team dominated proceedings in the Olympic 
velodrome, winning six of the 10 events, despite coming into Rio under the 
cloud of an investigation into alleged bullying within the elite set-up. That 
allegationled to the resignation

 of former head coach Shane Sutton. He has denied any wrongdoing and the result 
of that inquiry, which is being led by UK Sport, is expected next month.

The fact this did not derail the talks with HSBC is testimony to how far the 
sport has come during its eight years with Sky.

There are now 1.7 million more Britons riding regularly than there were in 
2008 and BritishCycling <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling> membership 
has grown from 21,000 to 111,000.

Sky has said it will continue to back Froome’s Team Sky, and the eponymous 
team that Wiggins has been riding for since 2015.

A pure focus on medals is something the Manchester-based governing body is 
hoping to get away from with HSBC’s support.

British Cycling is backing the UK government’s plan to translate elite success 
into more tangible benefits for everybody – so there will be more effort placed 
on getting women and minority groups into a sport that has gained a reputation 
for being too male and middle-class.

The governing body is also keen to boost the impact of its lobbying for 
changes to UK transport policy so that cycling as an option for commuters 
becomes more accessible and much safer.
