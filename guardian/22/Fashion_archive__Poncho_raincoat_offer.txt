One of the nicest shapes around this year is the poncho raincoat. Halfway 
between a cape and a raincoat, it has a lovely, swirly shape and being 
lightweight and loose can be worn over innumerable layers.


As our spring fashion offer we have just such a coat, exclusive to OBSERVER 
readers. Apart from the shirt-tail shape, it has a hood, large patch pockets, 
and double buttons at the side to give the sleeve shape. It is in 65 per cent 
polyester/35 per cent cotton, with a colour choice of stone or deep charcoal 
(almost black). The hood lining and trim are in a brushed fabric - a 
camel/brown/ orange/green check - which is 40 per cent acrylic/30 per cent 
wool/30 per cent other fibres. The coat should be dry cleaned.

Because a poncho is a loose garment there is no accurate fit to it, so ‘size’ 
is really a matter of preference. Tall people should probably have the larger 
version, short people the smaller, but most could wear either. (Our model wears 
the smaller size in stone colour, the larger in charcoal.) It depends how long, 
and voluminous, you would like it to be (the larger one has an extra 1 in. in 
length and 4 in. in width).

We think it is a marvellous price at £13.85 (including postage and 
packing),because it offers you a saving of 30 per cent on similar styles in the 
shops.
