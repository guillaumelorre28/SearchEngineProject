Paris


The French capital has put a lot of energy into developing its urban beach and 
riverside culture; the Paris-Plages have been a feature on the banks of the 
Seine since 2002 and the city continues to build up its riverside as a 
destination every year. The latest opening is a luxury floating hotelOff Paris 
Seine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jul/08/paris-first-floating-hotel-off-seine-river>
, which began taking bookings in June and is on the opposite bank toConcrete 
<http://www.concreteparis.fr/index.php?page=Home#>, one of the city’s leading 
underground clubs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jun/20/-sp-paris-nightlife-clubbing-para-one>
, which opened on a boat in 2011. Further up the river is another one of 
Paris’s most popular cultural venues,Wanderlust 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/31/paris-club-scene-dj-sven-hansen-love-eden-movie>
, which has an outdoor and indoor nightclub and open-air cinema on its huge 
waterfront terrace. Of course, the artificial beaches, complete with 5,000 
tonnes of sand, deck chairs and volleyball, are a huge draw for visitors. The 
main beach, the first to open, is a 3.5km strip between Pont Neuf and Pont de 
Sully. There are further beaches at Bassin de la Villette (close to metro 
Jaures/Stalingrad) and Voie Georges Pompidou. In 2013 the family-friendlyBerges 
de la Seine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/08/paris-le-berge-street-seine-family-playground>
 park and promenade opened on the left bank – a fantastic eco-urban project – 
with kids’ playgrounds, alfresco bar and snooze boxes formed out of old 
shipping containers. Paris mayorAnne Hidalgo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/15/paris-changed-permanently-mayor-anne-hidalgo>
 is aiming to allow swimming in the Seine – currently off-limits – by 2024. 
This year the beaches are open from 18 July until 21 August.

For years the city has boasted one of the best urban beach scenes in the 
world, made up of countless bars along the Spree. TheStrandbar Mitte bar 
<http://www.berlin.de/bars/adressen/strandbar/strandbar-mitte-0d1ab041fbae2cc0a7f4503ae9a2f4cb.html>
 is one of the oldest, with deckchairs, palm trees, and fresh pizza to enjoy 
with a bottle of beer. It’s one of the more easygoing spots, with dance classes 
in the evening followed by DJs. Other long-running beach bars include 
family-friendly African-Caribbean music venue,YAAM <http://www.yaam.de/>, which 
is the place for anyone seeking a sun-soaked, reggae-infused chill out; and 
riverside clubs, such asClub Der Visionaere <https://clubdervisionaere.com/>, a 
cluster of canal-side shacks in Kreuzberg where you can enjoy techno beneath 
the shade of a huge weeping willow tree. From May to September you can cool off 
at Badeschiff, a stylish floating bathhouse and beach area where you can relax 
and enjoy some yoga or standup paddleboarding classes. Meanwhile, those who 
really want to cut loose on the Spree (and don’t mind looking a bit stupid to 
passersby) should rent a raft fromFloss und Los <http://www.flossundlos.de/> 
and make their own floating barbecue party.

 Jubileumsparken (Jubilee Park) 
Sweden’s second city is well on its way to having an impressive urban beach of 
its own, comparable with Paris, thanks to theJubilee park 
<http://alvstaden.goteborg.se/jubileumsparken/playan/>. It’s a development 
under way to coincide with the city’s400-year celebrations in 2021 
<http://www.goteborg2021.com/in-english/>, but the waterside project has 
already started opening up to the public, with a beach, sailing school, public 
bath and the city’s outdoor roller derby track (which is also used for yoga, 
oddly). The whole area is a fantastic, ambitious, architectural endeavour, with 
ideas of urban sustainability running through it; the sauna, for example, is 
made from recycled materials and the changing rooms built from 12,000 recycled 
glass bottles. Meanwhile in Stockholm, you can find a tranquil retreat in
Långholmen Island 
<http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/See--do/Attractions/langholmen/> – a green 
oasis that was the site of a prison until 1974. Now it’s a popular summer 
hangout, with beaches, open-air stages and a cafe. The prison is now theSTF 
Långholmen Hostel <http://langholmen.com/en/vandrarhem/> (room in dormitory 
from £25) – a great place to pitch up for a summer break in Stockholm if you 
want to punctuate exploring the city with swimming and sunbathing.

Belgium’s capital is another city that injects a taste of the riviera into its 
urban environment each year, with itsBrussels Beach 
<http://www.brussels.be/artdet.cfm?id=4843&agendaid=696> pop up. Running from 
July until early August the beach features a full schedule of events, from sand 
sculpture contests to club nights and outdoor cinema and opera. New additions 
for this year include a market selling surfing and other watersports gear, 
“Love Boat” speed dating, dancing courses and a book exchange. All this on a 
sandy promenade decked out with palm trees on the on the banks of the Brussels 
canal.

The focal point of Vienna’s summer scene is Danube island 
<https://www.wien.info/en/vienna-for/families/outdoor/danube-island>, a leafy 
21km-long sliver of land in the eponymous river. There you’ll find sand, grass 
and gravel shores, including a family beach 250 metres in length as well as 
cafes, restaurants and bars and cycle and walking trails. While the island is 
set up for relaxation, those looking for more of a buzz should head to the 
Danube Canal andStrandbar Herrmann <http://www.strandbarherrmann.at/> for that 
unbeatable combination of cocktails and deckchairs as well as live sports and 
club nights. Just along you’ll find the impressiveBadeschiff 
<http://www.badeschiff.at/>, a unique club and bar on a rather big boat, with a 
floating pool attached to it and a big sun deck. Around that area of the canal 
you’ll find street food and pop-up restaurants – among them this year a gourmet 
burger grill calledIt’s All About the Meat Baby 
<https://www.facebook.com/Meatbaby/>.

Perhaps not the first city that springs to mind for a summer bathing break, 
but the Danish capital has a number of beautifully designed harbour baths and
urban beaches 
<http://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/copenhagen/sport/outdoor-swimming-spots>. 
There are four spots around the city where you can dive into the cool clear 
water:harbour bath Fisketorvet 
<http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/harbour-bath-fisketorvet-gdk412709>, 
which has earned the nickname Copencabana; the newest, theCoral Baths at 
Sluseholmen 
<http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/harbour-bath-sluseholmen-gdk713181>, 
which opened in 2011; andSvanemølle beach 
<http://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/denmark/svanemolle-beach-gdk497826> in the 
Østerbro district. But it’s theIslands Brygge baths 
<http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/harbour-bath-islands-brygge-gdk482346>
 that are perhaps the buzziest. Designed by architectsBjarke Ingels 
<http://www.big.dk/#projects> and Julien De Smedt <http://jdsa.eu/>, the baths 
have lawn space for sunbathing, barbecues and street food fans making it a 
hugely popular summer hang out. When you’re done drinking beer you can go for a 
dip in the 75-metre swimming pool beneath the Langebro bridge.

The coolest of the city’s urban beaches is perhaps Amsterdam Roest 
<http://www.amsterdamroest.nl/>; a post-industrial space in the east of the 
centre, with a sandy beach dotted with art made from recycled junk. There’s 
also a huge market hall and throughout the summer the beach is a venue for film 
screenings and events. You’ll find similar vibes atBlijburg aan Zee 
<http://www.blijburg.nl/> a beachside venue on the eastern part of IJburg 
<https://www.likealocalguide.com/amsterdam/blijburg-aan-zee>. Originally a 
pop-up summer space, the club, cafe and event space is a rustic hangout and, 
when the sun sets and the lanterns are lit, a magical place to spend a warm 
evening.

 Artificial beach next to The National Theatre, Southbank. Photograph: Alamy 
Eighty-five tonnes of sand aside, London’s Southbank Centre is already one of 
the best places to visit in the capital and with the impressive new Tate modern 
extension now open there’s never been a better year to make that leisurely 
stroll from the Royal Festival Hall to the Millennium bridge. During the summer 
the Southbank Centre comes into its own with an urban beach on the riverside 
promenade, part of theFestival of Love 
<http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/festivals-series/festival-of-love>, 
which will see a big programme of free and outdoor events – including a 
performance space by Good Chance,a collective that early this year set up a 
theatre at the Calais Jungle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/calais-refugee-camp-theatre-british-playwrights>
 – as well as ticketed shows. This year’s beach, however, is a Rio-themed 
affair, with caipirinhas and street food brought to you by Brazilian restaurant 
Cabana. Elsewhere in the capital, beach fun can be found everywhere from the 
roof of Camden’sRoundhouse 
<http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/whats-on/2016/camden-beach-2016/> to the huge 
Beach East <http://beacheast.co.uk/> at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park 
<http://queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/>, where 1,000 tonnes of sand are 
spread on the Stratford waterfront. Meanwhile, the beach atLondon Royal Docks 
<http://londonsroyaldocks.com/urban-beach/>, which launched four years ago is 
back for another year; an easygoing space with views towards the striking 
architecture that surrounds it.

Berlin may have its fair share of urban beach bars but Germany’s second city 
has a very impressivescene of its own <http://www.hamburg.de/beachclubs/>, 
which kicks off in spring when sand, sand and more sand gets shipped into 
Hamburg to get the party started. One of the main bars on the bank of the river 
Elbe isStrand Pauli <http://www.strandpauli.de/>, where straw-roofed wooden 
beach huts stand behind bamboo furniture and deckchairs, and cocktails can be 
sipped beneath a palm tree while enjoying dockland views. While Strand Pauli is 
a bit more grungy, Hamburg City Beach Club offers a slicker place to lounge. 
Meanwhile, if being by the water isn’t a prerequisite for you (this is an urban 
beach after all), then head toCentral Park <http://www.centralpark-hamburg.de/>
, a sand-floored venue in city centre, with ping pong, a bar and restaurant and 
a lively atmosphere in the evening.

 Temat Rzeka, a venue on the bank of the Vistula 
At night, when the lights of the Poniatowski bridge illuminate the river, 
Temat Rzeka <https://www.facebook.com/trzeka/> – a venue on the bank of the 
Vistula – has one of the most atmospheric locations in the city. This chic bar, 
which opened three years ago as part of an effort to develop the already 
popular beach has a wooden decking area with sun loungers that runs regular 
club nights, as well as family events during the day and film screenings every 
Wednesday. It’s similar toCud nad Wisłą 
<https://www.facebook.com/CudownieNadWisla/>, another beach bar on the opposite 
bank, which has been around since 2010; a venue with seating made from wooden 
pallets and a combination of club nights, performances and social events during 
the day. Further up the river you’ll find another city beach bar in the form of
La Playa <http://www.laplaya.pl/>, a tropical club which hosts latin nights to 
go with your cocktail. During the day you’re welcome to hang out on the beach 
and play badminton, volleyball or frisbee. Beyond the Gdanski bridge, you’ll 
findBoogaloo Beach Bar <https://www.facebook.com/boogaloobeachbar>. Like Temat 
Rzeka, it opened in 2013, creating a new party spot on the Żoliborz beach, with 
a Caribbean grill and regular reggae and dancehall parties.
