Chesterman Beach, Vancouver Island 


You could almost pick any beach off the ocean side of Vancouver Island, but 
Chesterman has the edge. It’s the kind of place where you might see kids 
pedalling along barefoot with a surfboard under one arm. With a bit of luck, 
and keen eyesight, you might spot orcas out beyond the breakers. Easier to find 
is the Carving Shed, where local craftsmen turn out exquisite sculptures and 
traditional canoes. At low tide a sandspit, the Tombolo, gets you out to Frank 
Island, with great views back to the beach.
• The Wickaninnish Inn <http://www.wickinn.com/> at the north end of the beach 
is famous, with summer prices to match (from £260). Or Chesterman Beach B&B 
<http://www.chestermanbeach.net/> has a cottage for four from £162 a night in 
summer

You might roam the globe for years and never find better beaches than those of 
the Scottish western isles, and none of them would ever be crowded. Gigha has 
its fans, Harris too, but real lovers of solitude should try this one on the 
island of Ceann Ear in the small group known as the Monachs, eight miles off 
the coast of North Uist. The soulful songs of the seal colony will haunt your 
trek across the white sands – that is assuming you can get there: there are no 
ferries, no flights, no people. A boat is first requirement. Fortunately
Hebridean Cruises 
<http://www.hebridescruises.co.uk/cruising-area/monach-islands> does take in 
the Monachs on several of its voyages, spending a night offshore and ferrying 
guests ashore to wander around the beaches and explore crofts that were finally 
abandoned in the 1930s.
• A 10-day remote island tour with Hebrides Cruises 
<http://www.hebridescruises.co.uk/cruises/far-flung-islands-mingulay-shiants> 
costs from £1,895pp all-inclusive

A four-day kayak paddle will get you to Nemto from Nusa Island 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/08/papua-new-guinea-kayaking-holiday>
 off the north coast of New Ireland, 600 miles east of Papua New Guinea. It is 
an astonishing journey, taking in fine beaches, sunken second world war planes 
and pristine reefs. But Nemto is the big treat: an island with the population 
of two, surrounded by white sands shadowed by palms that cackle with parrots. 
The reason this island is untouched lies with local superstitions about strange 
beasts that inhabit the interior. And if that sounds like King Kong and it 
means nobody comes near the place, all the better.

A single-file tunnel through the mountain takes you to Jagodna Bay, a 
different world from the swankier east side of Hvar, where those rare migrants, 
billionaires with good taste, hang out. Near Kamp Lili, a tightly packed but 
friendly campsite, a footpath leads to a beach barely bigger than a tennis 
court. It is, however, a jewel: clear water with plenty of fish, rocks to dive 
off and swim out to, and other coves to explore further along the coast. Above 
the beach, in the pines, there is a small restaurant-bar.
• Kamp Lili <http://www.kamplili.hr/Home.aspx> has pitches from €7 a night, 
and apartments for two from €40 in summer

A private yacht would be handy for getting here. Failing that, take the weekly 
flight from Fiji’s capital, Suva, to this craggy, elongated pinch of paradise. 
There are a few gorgeous sandy stretches, and if another visitor appears, you’d 
be very surprised. The population is just 1,200 and, in a good year, they get 
about two dozen visitors. Picnic on the sand, snorkel on magnificent reefs 
where sea shells the size of Bluebeard’s treasure chest gape up at the rays and 
sea snakes. As you’d expect, local cuisine relies on seafood, including a giant 
crab that cracks coconuts as if they were hazelnuts.
• Moana Guesthouse <https://www.facebook.com/Moana-Guesthouse-885600288159299/>
 has cabana-style accommodation next to the beach. Dinner is in the family 
kitchen, family room £30 a night
