, at thePalm Springs international film festival 
<http://www.psfilmfest.org/index.aspx> in California on Saturday. Scott, the 
film-maker behind such classics asBlade Runner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/blade-runner> and Alien 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alien>, has been nominated three times over 
the course of his career forThelma and Louise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78458/thelma.and.louise>, Gladiator 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/gladiator-scott-action> and Black 
Hawk Down <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jan/18/culture.reviews>, but 
has yet to win a trophy.

Speaking at the opening night gala for the festival, Damon said to the crowd 
that Scott has “given more than enough to cinema” to deserve the honor.

“He’s just a master director,” Damon added. “There are a handful of them on 
planet earth. But he is one of them. I don’t know if you’re supposed to say 
that out loud. But ... when I didThe Departed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/thriller.mattdamon>, we said it 
out loud a lot about Marty [Scorsese] and it panned out.”

Damon, who was given the Chairman’s award, was among the night’s honorees at 
the black-tie event, which attracted around 2,400 people in a cavernous 
convention hall to pay tribute to many of the actors (and one director) pegged 
to receive Oscar nominations on 14 January.

, chairman of the board of directors of thePalm Springs International Film 
Society <http://www.psfilmfest.org/yearround/>, stressed in his opening 
remarks, 28 of the Palm Springs honorees over the past three years went on to 
pick up Oscar nominations. The evening’s compere,Mary Hart

awards season!” she said, kicking off the show.

Cate Blanchett, honored with a Desert Palm achievement award for her lauded 
performance in Todd Haynes’sCarol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/26/carol-film-review-cate-blanchett-todd-haynes-rooney-mara>
, thanked the festival for “reminding all of us honored tonight that if we are 
not nominated for any other award, not to feel like losers, we had a moment of 
glory”.

Elsewhere, the event served as an opportunity for the honorees, all of whom 
had been announced ahead of time, to practice their speech-giving skills ahead 
of the Golden Globes this Sunday, and all the major awards show of the season 
that follow in its wake.

Despite this, Johnny Depp, awarded with a Desert Palm achievement award for 
his transformative performance as crime boss Whitey Bulger inBlack Mass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/04/black-mass-review-compelling-true-drama-is-mighty-comeback-for-johnny-depp>
, shied away from his prepared notes. “I hope you guys are planted well in your 
seats, this is going to take about 35 minutes. Maybe 37. Let’s just wing it, 
shall we?” he said upon taking to the stage.

In his rambling and endearing speech, Depp praised Warner Bros for supporting 
the dark thriller. “I’ve experienced this with studios where they get very 
frightened of what you might be doing – is Michael Eisner here?” he asked, 
name-checking the former Disney head who Deppclaims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/09/johnny-depp-interview-black-mass-afi-festival>
 resisted his initial loony portrayal of Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the 
Caribbean.

The actor also fondly addressed his wife, Amber Heard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/05/johnny-depp-and-amber-heard-marry>
, who was also in the audience having presented earlier in the evening to her 
co-star in The Danish Girl, Alicia Vikander. He thanked Heard “for putting up 
with me, for living with all these characters, which can’t be easy. It’s hard 
for me, it’s got to be hard for her”.

Saoirse Ronan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/05/brooklyn-review-saoirse-ronan-shines-in-nick-hornby-colm-toibin-drama>
, awarded with the International Star award for her performance in the period 
immigration drama Brooklyn, did the opposite of Depp by sticking to a written 
script. Noting that she wasn’t sure what to prepare, Ronan added: “I actually 
Googled Sandra Bullock’s speech from 2014 … I Googled Meryl’s as well. Aim high 
when you’re in doubt.”

Michael Fassbender <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender> 
appeared to do the same, glancing down at his notes, in accepting an 
International Star award for his performance as Steve Jobs in Danny Boyle’s 
Aaron Sorkin-scripted biopic. In presenting him with the honor, Kate Winslet, 
who co-starred in the film, shared how nervous Fassbender was to play the Apple 
maverick. Fassbender used a lot of his podium time to offer Winslet a heartfelt 
thanks. “Kate, you had my back from day one,” he said. “Your wicked sense of 
humor and just maternal nature kept everyone’s spirits buoyant and that’s not 
to mention your acting ability. You’re a class act and I owe you big time.”

Steve Jobs movie tanks in US. Should we really be surprised?

He also notably addressed the film’s poor performance at the box-office 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/26/steve-jobs-movie-tanks-us-box-office>
, which has many awards pundits unsure of the film’s Oscar chances. “It’s 
unfortunate about the box office figures, but thank God for Jurassic World,” 
Fassbender joked. (Both movies were produced by Universal.)

Mirren exclaimed at the lectern. In his opening remarks, Cranston poked fun at 
the title of his honor. Said the actor: “I got a call to say that I was the
