So, in case you haven’t heard, it’s Stan Smiths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/22/2015-stan-smith-went-mass-adidas-sneakers-trainer>
 out, Converse in, when it comes to fashion’s sneaker of choice. OK, Stan 
Smiths are still happening, but we did notice a lot of Converse at London 
Collections Men. In a bid to provide the crib sheet on what your choice of 
Chuck means, here’s a run down of Converse semantics.

These are the closest shoe to the Stan Smiths school of dressing – and go just 
as well with jeans and anything khaki. They’re usually worn by the kind of man 
who might wear stripy T-shirts, neat grey marl sweatshirts and glasses, quietly 
ruing the fact that they aren’t an extra in a Wes Anderson film while working 
at a biannual magazine dedicated to typefaces. Assuch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/aug/24/fantastic-mr-wes-anderson-how-tenenbaum-chic-took-over-the-catwalks>
, they totally work with this season Gucci.

These are the Converse for all you rockers out there – worn by musicians 
ranging from the Ramones to the Strokes, Kurt Cobain to Wiz Khalifa. With 
Cobain a bit of a muse atLondon Collections Men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-collections-men> this week, it’s no 
surprise that Nick Grimshaw and Labrinth are already on board with this. As 
Grimshaw usefully demonstrates, this is all about ripped jeans, hoodies and a 
bomber. Mosh pits are your natural habitat.

Wearing a pair of these has something of the mod about it – they are straight 
out of the Ivy League school of dressing. They have the pedigree of basketball 
courts of American college, but also a sort of Céline-approved unadorned feel 
with the natural canvas. As such, they are on the money for fashion’s current 
mood. See Agi & Sam atLondon Collections Men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-collections-men>, where they were 
worn with slick, minimal sportswear. Expect the wearer of these to have an 
Instagram blackout and an unGoogleable name.

There’s nothing like a pair of loud sneakers to tell the world that you’re 
really kooky. Patterned – or mismatched – Converse do the job with bells on and 
have been doing so since the 90s. See Green Day’sBillie Joe Armstrong 
<https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/48/47/19/4847198c651633ac03be7209c80900a2.jpg>
. There are some modern kooks who can still be counted on to fly the flag. See 
Rupert Grint and prepare for him to pair them with a novelty T-shirt and grin. 
Think TV presenter dressing.

The dark horse of the Converse world – which means they are sure to soon be 
the choice of early adopters. More Vans than Stan Smiths, they appeal to anyone 
with skater tendencies, even if they have never stepped foot on a skateboard 
and only carry one for show. Pharrell would wear Cons if he wasn’t working with
Adidas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/mar/27/pharrell-williams-adidas-collaboration>
 – the smart ones among his followers will soon be sporting them.
