Once known as the NX, the console looks to be a hybrid machine, half portable 
and half traditional console, but more flexible than either.

The device, which appears to take games loaded on DS-style cartridges, can be 
used as a traditional console like a PS4 or Xbox One, with the machine docked 
with the TV and an (Xbox-styled) wireless controller, called the Nintendo 
Switch Pro Controller, used to play games on it.

But it can also be used in a number of portable modes. The main body, which 
has an LCD screen on it, can be undocked from the hub and carried away. Owners 
can then either attach mini semi-controllers (called “Joy-Cons”) to its side, 
and use it like a particularly large portable games console – think a massive 
PS Vita – or prop up the screen and use the wireless controllers instead.

A second type of wireless controller allows owners to dock the two mini 
controllers to either side of a wireless body, and play using that. The 
Joy-Cons are included; the Pro Controller is an optional accessory.

Aside from the focus on the physical hardware, Nintendo also revealed a 
portion of the lineup for the machine. Alongside the newest Zelda game, which 
had already been confirmed for the console, actors were seen playing Splatoon, 
a Mario platformer, Mario Kart and the only third-party game, a port of 
Bethesda’s five year-old RPG Skyrim.

“Nintendo Switch allows gamers the freedom to play however they like,” said 
Reggie Fils-Aime, President and COO, Nintendo of America. “It gives game 
developers new abilities to bring their creative visions to life by opening up 
the concept of gaming without boundaries.”

The new machine will help Nintendo consolidate its powerful presence in the 
mobile gaming sector, led by the New Nintendo 3DS but under attack from 
smartphones. In the home console market Nintendo has had its weak but 
prestigious Wii U. The Wii U was similarly ambitious, offering owners a 
controller with a touch-screen built into the middle of it as default. But 
unlike the Switch, which makes an immediate case for why its versatile hardware 
offers a benefit, the Wii U struggled to convince many potential customers that 
the cumbersome controller was actually a positive.

Nintendo did not give a price for the console, nor did it offer up tech specs, 
beyond describing the screen as “high-definition”. But it did provide a lengthy 
list of partners, including major publishers such as Ubisoft, EA, Activision 
and Sega, as well as smaller developers including TelltaleGames 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> and PlatinumGames.
