Chris Froome clawed back a late attack led by Alberto Contador to retain 
second place in the overall standings after stage 17 of theVuelta a España 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/vuelta-a-espana>, from Castellón to Llucena.

Froome was initially left trailing by the charge led by Contador (Tinkoff) and 
also including the race leader, Nairo Quintana of Movistar, and his fellow 
Colombian Esteban Chaves (Orica), who started the day in third.

But Team Sky’s Froome soon managed to rejoin his main challengers and the four 
top riders in the standings crossed the line together, three minutes and 27 
seconds behind the stage winner, Matthias Frank.

The IAM Cycling <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling> rider secured his 
long-awaited victory after springing out of a 28-rider breakaway group, which 
had established an early advantage over the peloton.

Frank was joined by Dario Caltaldo of Astana in the charge towards the line, 
although Caltaldo subsequently flagged and Frank just managed to hold off the 
chasing pack at the line.

Team Sky’s Leopold König got within six seconds of Frank at the finish, with 
the Dutchman Robert Gesink and Spain’s Pello Bilbao just behind.

The result leaves Quintana’s lead of Froome at three minutes and 37 seconds 
heading into stage 18 on Thursday, with Chaves a further 20 seconds behind and 
the Spaniard Contador in fourth.
