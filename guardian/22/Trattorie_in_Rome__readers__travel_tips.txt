Winning tip: Da Lucia, Trastevere

A Sunday stroll through the Porta Portese flea market should be rewarded with 
a hearty Roman lunch at Da Lucia. This old-school neighbourhood trattoria is 
justifiably popular despite being hidden on a backstreet. Everything is good 
here but I recommend theantipasto della casa and spaghetti alla gricia (pasta 
with pork jowl, pecorino cheese and black pepper).

This place was recommended by a colleague from Rome and it didn’t disappoint: 
lots of locals were enjoying the tasty and reasonably priced food, despite the 
fact that it is near Piazza Navona. Service was exceptionally friendly. We 
enjoyed it so much we went two nights in a row.

La Scaletta degli Artisti

The owner makes a daily trek to the fish market at Ostia to find the freshest 
seafood and designs the menu around what’s available.Primi and secondi are 
superb, and the wine list is terrific and reasonably priced. Sit at a quiet 
outdoor table when the weather cooperates for friendly, unobtrusive service – 
and excellent English.

Armando al Pantheon

In the same family since 1961, this welcoming trattoria, just 200 metres from 
the Pantheon, is open weekdays only – because it serves local workers. The menu 
(three courses with wine for under €30) can feature pasta with tomato sauce and 
local pork or lamb.

La Villetta

La Villetta, just round the corner from music venue Il Circolo Degli Artisti 
<http://www.circoloartisti.it/en/> is a classic, catering for a mixture of 
young and old, elegant and casual – and the occasional pre-gig rock star. If 
you make it past the legendary antipasti buffet, the rest of the menu offers 
excellent and uncomplicated Italian food.

Trattoria il Tettarello
 Photograph: Sarah Evans 
Behind the unassuming facade of this small restaurant lies a wonderfully warm 
and typically Italian eatery, and you instantly feel at home. The food, and the 
house wine, are delicious and not expensive. It’s very popular with locals, so 
come early or be prepared to wait for a table.

L’Antica Pizzeria Fratelli Ricci

In an unassuming location on a poorly lit street near Piazza della Repubblica, 
this place looks nothing special. But it’s 100 years old, the pizza is out of 
this world and the family wine goes down smoothly, as do big portions of pasta. 
Conversation is lively and prices low.

Trattoria Vecchia Roma

We were delighted at the high quality, affordable food: Italian dishes have 
never tasted so good. It’s always a good sign when a restaurant is full of 
locals. The atmosphere was warm, and the waiter remembered us when we visited 
again three days later.

La Sagra del Vino

Inherited and run by Candido, Lella and their entertaining son Valentino, this 
trattoria has welcomed diners since 1938 with a warm and relaxed atmosphere. 
It’s away from the tourist centre but within easy reach of the Cipro metro 
station on Via Marziale. It has a large NO PIZZA sign on the door.
