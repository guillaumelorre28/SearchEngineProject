As a long time Milan resident, Giorgio Armani 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/23/giorgio-armani-shows-how-handle-heat-milan-fashion-week-2016>
 is familiar with cold January days and for his autumn/winter 2017 menswear 
show he set about creating a wardrobe to combat such weather.

This being Armani, hiking jackets and thermals won’t do. The collection shown 
at the brand’s discreetly elegant HQ was a study in his now signature 
outerwear, something men around the world know the designer for.

There were long military-style greatcoats, velvet jackets, oversized shaggy 
shearling coats, leather macs, bombers and enormous padded jackets, the latter 
provoking spontaneous applause.

Models also wore gloves and some wore a garments referred to as 
“sleeve-scarves” in the show notes. To the uninitiated, the sleeve-scarf is an 
item that would perplex Houdini – jumper sleeves combined with a scarf wrapped 
around the neck. If the addition was quizzical, the overall message was clear: 
Armani has a style solution for 2017, whatever the temperature.

The show notes described the collection as “evolving codes to define an idea 
of elegance tuned-in to the present, but rich with heritage”. Armani, now more 
than 40 years old as a brand and with an 82-year-old as its designer, walks 
this line of heritage and relevance.

The numbers don’t lie. The Armani group is an Italian fashion giant. It is the 
country’s second-largest fashion company, posting revenues of £2.3bn in 2015, 
behind only Prada with £3.1bn.

But even mega-brands are not immune to wobbles. Net revenues were down 5% in 
2016, and when asked what this year would bring, the founder described the 
economic situation as complicated.

In an attempt to stem any further complications, Armani announced a foundation 
in his name in July last year. As well as a home for philanthropic projects, it 
will act like a trust after the designer – who is without a hereditary heir and 
has yet to name a successor – dies, and protect the company from takeover.


The foundation administrators will now be responsible for the company. In a 
statement Armani said the new structure would “safeguard the governance of 
assets of the Armani Group and ensure that these are kept stable over time”.

The future was also in the frame earlier in the day at Armani HQ, when it was 
the venue for Nuova Generazione Di Designer. The showcase of three young 
brands, selected by Armani and Milan’s fashion body, Camera Nazionale della 
Moda Italiana, was the first time that Armani had lent his space to a 
multi-designer show.

The collections shown – by Yoshio Kubo, Moto Guo and Consistence – were 
varied. Kubo’s collection was an unusual fusion ofstreetwear

 and bohemia, inspired by bareback bronco riding in the US, and consisting of 
garments such as a pair of silk pyjamas with a long padded jacket.

Moto Guo, designed by three designers based in Malaysia, showcased models in 
outfits that recalled both Japanese school uniforms and the clothes worn by the 
Von Trapps inThe Sound of Music

Consistence, a London-based label, was the most Armani-ish of the three, with 
suiting, pinstripes, trenchcoats and cropped trousers. London’s reputation as 
the fashion city for new talent remains unthreatened by these collections, but 
Milan’s search for its own next generation has to be applauded.

Milan’s menswear shows concluded on Tuesday. The focus now shifts to Paris, 
whereLouis Vuitton <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton> and 
Balenciaga
