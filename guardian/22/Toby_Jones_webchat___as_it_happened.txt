I was extremely apprehensive about playing Captain Mainwaring. But the script 
has a scale the TV show couldn't – and I couldn't resist the opportunity to be 
stupid with the knights of the realm

I was extremely apprehensive about playing Captain Mainwaring. I was extremely 
sceptical about the project as a whole. When I saw the script, I was really 
impressed with how the 25-minute format of the TV series had been adapted and 
extended, into 100 minutes. The script has a scale that the TV series doesn't 
have time to explore and... women. I was really excited to work with Michael 
Gambon, Tom Courtenay, the two Bills, Danny and Blake, as well as Catherine. I 
felt I stood a chance if I watched what they were doing. In the end, it was a 
selfish decision - the opportunity to be stupid with knights of the realm.

Thank you Aubrey, for giving me an opportunity to lament our exit from last 
night's Carling Cup semifinal. I think you'll agree, we were robbed. Charles 
Churchill above is correct - I've always been a Potters fan. My father grew up 
in the potteries, and he watched Stanley Matthews play for them. When 
Marvellous was offered to me, I couldn't believe the coincidence. Of course 
meeting Neil is an event, and as the film shows, it tends to have long-term 
consequences. I now get approached regularly by members of Keele University's 
Neil Baldwin XI alumni. Both Gemma and I loved having Neil on the set, 
applauding the various scenes from his life, and his mother's death. Gemma's an 
extraordinary actress, but you know that.

I'd always loved reading and listening to Iain Sinclair, so it was a fantastic 
opportunity to work with him. Ken Campbell was a hero of mine, and like Ian, he 
alerted me to the unobserved stories that lurk all around us. I'm just about to 
play William Blake in a radio play that combines contemporary action in and 
around Lambeth, with Blake's life in the early 19th century. Something I think 
will appeal to Iain.

I loved Marvellous & Detectorists, & over the past few years you’ve become one 
of my favourite actors & a big inspiration to me in amateur dramatics at 
university to try to find the driving force behind each character (however

My question is whether stage acting is something you plan to return to in the 
near future, or are you planning on focusing on TV and film for the foreseeable 
future?

Thank you very much Will. There isn't really a plan. It's been a couple of 
years since I did a play and I'm very keen to do it again. I suppose I'm 
looking for a play that has to be done in a theatre, that is an event in and of 
itself, rather than just another play.

For Berberian Sound System, we didn't have anything to watch, or even an audio 
track. Oddly I enjoyed the challenge of imagining what I was hearing

When shooting Berberian Sound Studio, were you actually given anything to

just an audio track? Or were you improvising your ‘reactions’ to it without

No, we weren't given anything to watch. We weren't even given an audio track. 
Oddly I enjoyed the challenge of imagining what I was hearing. When I saw the 
film, I realised how much worse what I'd imagined was. Thanks for reminding me

I can't speak about the X19, but Mackenzie was worried stiff every time I got 
into the TR7. He bought it cheap for the art department, and had it done up. I 
often struggle with the gearbox, which felt clunkier than it looked. The 
original would have been painted mimosa, you know. Interesting.

Hi Liam. The best thing a director can do is tell you what he's seen, and what 
he takes it to mean. It sounds simple but it isn't.

I adored working with Tomas Alfredson. I hope I'm about to work with him 
again. He is one of the clearest directors I've ever worked with. He reports 
back to the actor exactly what he's seen and what he takes from what he's seen, 
and then he suggests how this might be adjusted to create an alternative 
impression. If that sounds dry, it isn't, he's just very clear and concrete, 
and reassuringly simple. And he's funny.

Thanks, I loved playing Owen Meany. In a way, it was similar to playing Dobby 
- I understood how loved the character was in the imagination of the reader. So 
I felt a special kind of responsibility to voicing it. I've loved radio drama 
since I was a kid - I know it's a cliche to say it's a very visual medium, but 
it's true, that learning to pitch your voice in the right way does teach you a 
lot about space.

Hi Ben. I'm desperately trying to link Dad's Army with By Our Selves, and I 
can't. I think the best part about my job is also the scariest: not knowing 
what's coming next. I'm lucky enough to have played very contrasting roles, and 
that is what I love. Sometimes big budget movies, I should say astronomical 
budget movies, feel like a different job. You can shoot the same scene three 
different ways over several months, whereas By Our Selves has almost no budget 
at all. The trick is to understand the world of the film you're in, and find a 
way to respect both processes. That reads like a Captain Mainwaring pompous 
answer!

I loved the Detectorists script: it's rooted in character rather than jokes, 
so it felt like doing a drama. Research was learning how to operate a metal 
detector

What did you have to do for the audition for the role.

Mackenzie and I have been in several films together but never in the same 
scene. Then we were cast as museum attendants in the last Muppet movie and 
spent a morning together. Apologetically, Mackenzie told me he'd written a part 
for me, and would I read what he'd written. It was a comedy. I dreaded having 
to tell him that I didn't like it - truth is, it was laugh out loud funny. I 
think because it's rooted in character rather than jokes, it didn't feel like 
we were doing a comedy but rather a drama. Research? He showed me how to 
operate a metal detector.

I was extremely apprehensive about playing Captain Mainwaring. I was extremely 
sceptical about the project as a whole. When I saw the script, I was really 
impressed with how the 25-minute format of the TV series had been adapted and 
extended, into 100 minutes. The script has a scale that the TV series doesn't 
have time to explore and... women. I was really excited to work with Michael 
Gambon, Tom Courtenay, the two Bills, Danny and Blake, as well as Catherine. I 
felt I stood a chance if I watched what they were doing. In the end, it was a 
selfish decision - the opportunity to be stupid with knights of the realm.

Thank you Aubrey, for giving me an opportunity to lament our exit from last 
night's Carling Cup semifinal. I think you'll agree, we were robbed. Charles 
Churchill above is correct - I've always been a Potters fan. My father grew up 
in the potteries, and he watched Stanley Matthews play for them. When 
Marvellous was offered to me, I couldn't believe the coincidence. Of course 
meeting Neil is an event, and as the film shows, it tends to have long-term 
consequences. I now get approached regularly by members of Keele University's 
Neil Baldwin XI alumni. Both Gemma and I loved having Neil on the set, 
applauding the various scenes from his life, and his mother's death. Gemma's an 
extraordinary actress, but you know that.

I'd always loved reading and listening to Iain Sinclair, so it was a fantastic 
opportunity to work with him. Ken Campbell was a hero of mine, and like Ian, he 
alerted me to the unobserved stories that lurk all around us. I'm just about to 
play William Blake in a radio play that combines contemporary action in and 
around Lambeth, with Blake's life in the early 19th century. Something I think 
will appeal to Iain.

I loved Marvellous & Detectorists, & over the past few years you’ve become one 
of my favourite actors & a big inspiration to me in amateur dramatics at 
university to try to find the driving force behind each character (however 
minor) & create a distinct personality for each and every one.
My question is whether stage acting is something you plan to return to in the 
near future, or are you planning on focusing on TV and film for the foreseeable 
future?

Thank you very much Will. There isn't really a plan. It's been a couple of 
years since I did a play and I'm very keen to do it again. I suppose I'm 
looking for a play that has to be done in a theatre, that is an event in and of 
itself, rather than just another play.

I can't speak about the X19, but Mackenzie was worried stiff every time I got 
into the TR7. He bought it cheap for the art department, and had it done up. I 
often struggle with the gearbox, which felt clunkier than it looked. The 
original would have been painted mimosa, you know. Interesting.

Hi Liam. The best thing a director can do is tell you what he's seen, and what

I adored working with Tomas Alfredson. I hope I'm about to work with him 
again. He is one of the clearest directors I've ever worked with. He reports 
back to the actor exactly what he's seen and what he takes from what he's seen, 
and then he suggests how this might be adjusted to create an alternative 
impression. If that sounds dry, it isn't, he's just very clear and concrete, 
and reassuringly simple. And he's funny.

Thanks, I loved playing Owen Meany. In a way, it was similar to playing Dobby 
- I understood how loved the character was in the imagination of the reader. So 
I felt a special kind of responsibility to voicing it. I've loved radio drama 
since I was a kid - I know it's a cliche to say it's a very visual medium, but 
it's true, that learning to pitch your voice in the right way does teach you a 
lot about space.
