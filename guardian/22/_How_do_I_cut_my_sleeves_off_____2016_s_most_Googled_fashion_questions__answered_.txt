1. ‘How to cut sleeves off a shirt?’


This year was largely focused on vandalising your clothes: razoring your jean 
hems <http://www.refinery29.com/how-to-fray-denim#slide>, cropping your tops 
and, apparently, de-sleeving your shirts. To do this one, you need scissors and 
good arms. We’re fairly confident this question was made up.

2. ‘How do I start modelling?’ 


A bleak perennial on the search engine’s annual fashion question roundup but, 
anyway ... To start, you need remarkable genes. If the year’s catwalk was 
anything to go by, you also needed curly hair and a decent handle on Instagram.

3. ‘What is haute couture?’ 


Thought £2,000 for a dress was expensive? Think again! Haute couture is like 
catwalk fashion except way, way more expensive, made to order as opposed to 
ready to wear and as close as fashion gets to art.

4. ‘How to wear booties with skinny jeans?’ 

In fashion parlance, with a sliver of ankle flesh showing. In normal parlance, 
just shove them on, mate.

5. ‘When can you start wearing white?’ 

Before Labor Day, but also when you don’t have or want a baby, no longer take 
public transport, give up coffee and are the Flotus –present

.

6. ‘How to become a fitness model?’


Sign up to Instagram. Get a handle like “StrongIsSexxxxi41”. Remember that the 
straw of your green juice is a conduit to an alternative reality where your 
Lycra sports bra is never three sizes too small and that all burgers are props 
not sustenance.


7. ‘What is boho?’


Essentially: dressing up like Florence Welch’s cat-lady aunt after a day spent 
foraging for oyster mushrooms.

8. ‘What did people wear in the 90s?’


Lots of layers. So many layers that people questioned the eyesight, taste and 
sanity of a generation (see: the entire wardrobe ofthe Spice Girls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/07/the-spice-girls-at-20-women-werent-allowed-to-be-like-that-in-public>
).

9. ‘How to dress like a hippy?’


Repeat (7) but with less awkwardly perched hats and a more laissez-faire 
attitude to personal hygiene.

10. ‘How to become a fashion designer?’


The best thing a burgeoning designer can do is put down the mood board, appear 
on I’m Dancing on Ice in the Big Brother Bake-Off and “drop” a sex tape. 
Celebrity is the new St Martins (see: theOlsen twins
