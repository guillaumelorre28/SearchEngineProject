Chris Froome <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> is to lead Team 
Sky in the Vuelta despite having come off a gruelling win in the Tour de France 
followed by participation in the Rio Olympic Games this month.

The Vuelta has so far proved elusive for the British rider, who was a 
runner-up 2011 and 2014 and was forced to withdraw last season after crashing 
andfracturing his ankle

 on stage 11.

The race, which starts with a team time trial in Ourense on Saturday 20 
August, represents a trial of strength for Froome whowon his third Tour de 
France

 in July then went on to compete in both themen’s time trial in Rio

, where he had to settle for bronze, and a brutal road race that saw him 
finishing down the field.

“It’s already been a great summer for both myself and the team, but the Vuelta 
is another big challenge for us,”Froome told the Team Sky website 
<http://www.teamsky.com/teamsky/home/article/88611#z5SmPKjVBmD2EBmh.97>.

“The tough course and stiff competition is bound to make for some aggressive 
racing. We’re going there with a strong group of guys who have a lot of 
experience with this race.

“The Vuelta is a race I really enjoy and where I guess you could say I have 
unfinished business, so I’m looking forward to getting started.”

Froome will be joined in Spain by Ian Boswell, Michal Golas, Pete Kennaugh, 
Christian Knees, Leopold Konig, Michal Kwiatkowski, Mikel Landa and Salvatore 
Puccio.
