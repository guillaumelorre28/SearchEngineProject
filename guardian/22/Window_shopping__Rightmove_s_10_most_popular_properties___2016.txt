Harry Potter fans turned a mundane £450,000 three-bed home in Bracknell, 
Berkshire, into one of the most sought-after properties in the country in 2016 
- although it was edged out of the top spot by a £55m luxury townhouse in 
Belgravia, London.


Rightmove, Britain’s biggest property website with around 127m visits a month, 
has compiled a list of the top 10 most-viewed homes across its site in 2016.

10. Holland Park, London - £24m

Behind the Victorian facade lies 9,000 sq ft of contemporary home, including 
the obligatory basement pool, gym and indoor cinema. Its gardens and terraces 
have been designed by a Chelsea Flower Show gold medallist, and its Addison 
Road address is one of the most prestigious in west London. It was first 
listed, according to Rightmove, in January 2016, and but is now understood to 
have been sold for an undisclosed price.

This fixer-upper dates back to at least 1613 and has links to Victorian 
adventure novelist Rider Haggard. The Grade II-listed gatehouse comes with 1.66 
acres and is in need of complete renovation. But before you sell that one-bed 
flat in south London to live like a lord in Suffolk, the bad news is that it 
has gone under offer. The agents say: “Fixer-uppers are generally extremely 
popular, so will often sell well in any case. Its size and potential charmed a 
huge amount of people who came to view the property, despite its listed status 
and need for major renovation from top to bottom. Safe to say, after over 150 
viewings and multiple open days, we have achieved a lot more than the guide 
price with an offer now locked in (subject to contract).”

The ultimate Notting Hill dream home, so say the agents, but the current 
owners of this mansion in Pembridge Square are “cagey” about being named or 
disclosing the sale price. Apart from the eight bedrooms, nine bathrooms and 
four reception rooms, the agent says the “centre piece of the lower ground area 
is a lavish spa with an oval-shaped massage area and a large gym”. An 
architectural historian writes on the Pembridge Association newsletter that 
“the houses represent the style of a country which exercised a dominating 
influence throughout the world. That style was determined by the attempt to 
combine grandeur with economy of means”.

7. Ampthill, Bedford - £275,000

This three-bed terrace house over three floors is in one of Bedford’s most 
desirable locations, just a 45-minute hop into central London from the local 
train station. The price tag, character features and a decent-sized garden made 
it hugely popular on Rightmove. “Among the really expensive and unusual ones 
each year we often see a few that just have really nice features, like this 
cottage,” a spokeswoman said.

Why would a humble two-bed cottage in Shropshire, extending to just over 1,000 
feet, generate such huge interest? Because it is one of the few remaining cave 
houses in Britain. Once the home of local artist Anthony Dracup, the key 
feature of the property is the 650 sq ft cave to the rear, with gothic archways 
and vaulted pillars. It is, according to the agents, “unlike anything else you 
are likely to see”.

The agents call it “one of the finest new mansions in the Ascot area”, but 
this new-build eight-bed, ninth-bath home has failed to find a buyer since 
first listing in October 2014. It includes a 14-seat cinema, three powder rooms 
and its own spa with a sauna, gym and 13m indoor pool, so it’s handy that the 
property also comes with its own staff quarters. The agents say it has “many 
high-impact rooms”, adding that “it’s no surprise that it has attracted a great 
deal of attention”. But not, it would seem buyers: it first listed at £24m 
before dropping to £19.75m earlier this year. Now with a £17.95m guide price 
it’s almost a bargain.

Rather better known as 4 Privet Drive, the Dursleys home in the Harry Potter 
films, this three-bed home went on the market in September, but has since been 
removed from sale. Any buyers will be able to make their own use of the 
cupboard under the stairs, which in the film was Harry’s place to sleep. The 
agents say the home is “in a quiet cul-de-sac location” and “has recently 
undergone complete renovation to an extremely high standard”.

 Despite listing on Rightmove only a month ago, this island fortress off the 
Pembrokeshire coast has ignited huge interest. The Napoleonic-era fort, built 
to defend Milford Haven harbour and garrison 100 men, has 10 bedrooms and three 
bathrooms, but would need serious amounts of money spent to bring it up to 
habitable condition. Or in perfect estate agency-ese, the new owner “will wish 
to reconfigure the accommodation”.

 Ex-footballer Ashley Ward and wife Dawn, star of the reality TV show Real 
Housewives of Cheshire, have reportedly had their ­11-bed mansion on the market 
since October 2013, but three years later it’s still on sale, despite having 
£1.5m knocked off the price. Set in 12 acres, it boasts a princess-themed 
bedroom, hair and nail salon, games room and cinema, with interiors designed by 
Dawn (who has also worked for Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard). But plans to 
build conference and banquet facilities on the site raised objections from 
around 150 neighbours in this upmarket Cheshire village.

The 10,500 sq ft former Belgian embassy in Eaton Square, and headquarters to 
the Belgian government-in-exile during the second world war, was sumptuously 
renovated and put on the market for £55m in November 2015. It boasts gold 
chandeliers, retractable glass ceilings, a basement swimming pool and a 
passenger elevator should the stairs across its six floors become too much. But 
its failure to find a buyer willing to pay not just the £55m asking price, but 
also the £6.5m stamp duy, is indicative of the slump in the top end of the 
London market.
