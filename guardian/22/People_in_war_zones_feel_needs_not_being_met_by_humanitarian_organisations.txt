People in some of the world’s worst conflict zones believe the presence of 
humanitarian organisations is declining

 even as their need for them increases, according to an investigation into the 
impact of violence and insecurity on relief efforts.

Researchers also found that incentives to highlight the presence of such 
organisations on the ground to the general public and donors meant they 
sometimes overstated their impact, inadvertently making humanitarian situations 
appear less dire than they were.

The findings, based on three years of field work in Afghanistan, Somalia, 
South Sudan and Syria, emerged from thesecure access in volatile environments 
(Save) <http://www.saveresearch.net/> project, funded by the Department for 
International Development and undertaken by the Humanitarian Outcomes 
consultancy and the Global Public Policy Institute, a Berlin-based thinktank.

Only in Somalia and one Syrian province did most people surveyed 
<http://www.gppi.net/fileadmin/user_upload/media/pub/2016/SAVE__2016__The_effects_of_insecurity_on_humanitarian_coverage.pdf>
 perceive an increase in the number of aid agencies operating.

The study comes at a time of acute concern about the security and safety of 
aid workers, including local staff, in humanitarian situations. NGO staff were 
assaulted and raped during anattack on aid workers

 in South Sudan in August that left at least one person dead.

As access becomes more difficult in “high-risk countries”, aid is becoming 
more basic and less responsive to the critical needs of the most vulnerable 
people, the project found.

“In high-risk countries aid agencies tend to narrow their field presence and 
cluster in safer areas,” said the researchers. “Only a small group of 
humanitarian organisations operate in the highest-risk places. Surveys of 
people living in high risk areas say that aid is declining even as their needs 
are rising.”

The researchers warned that donor policies and incentives can work against 
humanitarian access and coverage, making the aid presence seem more robust than 
it is, and also said that the independence of agencies was threatened by 
counter-terror policies and funding strategies that have the effect of 
discouraging aid programming in opposition-held territories.

The release of the research coincided with the publication of a report by 
Katherine Haver 
<http://odihpn.org/resources/tug-war-ethical-decision-making-enable-humanitarian-access-high-risk-environments/>
, a partner at Humanitarian Outcomes, into the ethical choices facing 
humanitarian organisations in zones where conflict makes it dangerous for aid 
workers to operate safely.

The study highlighted concerns among the senior staff of some NGOS about the 
duty of care to local workers, upon whom many international organisations are 
increasingly reliant.

Haver found that national partners in Somalia, Syria, South Sudan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-sudan> and Afghanistan were taking on 
more security risks, but often with insufficient support. “They saw the main 
risks as coming from aerial shelling and military clashes, and simply attempted 
to move staff away from possible strike locations,” she said.

Humanitarian action had the potential to do harm rather than good, added 
Haver. Examples of this risk included threatening to stop or withdraw services.

In South Sudan, organisations suspended operations in specific areas as a way 
of dealing with riots, interference by local authorities or threats to staff. 
“Some aid staff saw this as a form of collective punishment, whereby those not 
involved in the incidents were inappropriately denied aid,” said Haver.
