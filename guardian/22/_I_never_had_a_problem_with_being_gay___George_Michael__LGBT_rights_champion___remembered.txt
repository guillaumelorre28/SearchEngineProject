George Michael: singer, songwriter, pop superstar, dies aged 53 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/dec/26/george-michael-singer-songwriter-pop-superstar-dies-aged-53-video-obituary>
He came out as gay following his arrest in April 1998 for engaging in “a lewd 
act” in front of an undercover police officer in Beverly Hills. He was fined 
£500 and ordered to do 80 hours’ community service for the incident, sparking 
the Sun headline “Zip Me Up Before You Go Go”.

He later said: “I never had a moral problem with being gay. I thought I had 
fallen in love with a woman a couple of times. Then I fell in love with a man, 
and realised that none of those things had been love.”

In a 2007 interview 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/george-michael-why-i-had-to-keep-my-homosexuality-secret-403989.html>
, Michael spoke about why he felt he had to keep his sexuality a secret: “My 
mother was still alive and every single day would have been a nightmare for her 
thinking what I might have been subjected to. I’d been out to a lot of people 
since 19. I wish to God it had happened then. I don’t think I would have the 
same career – my ego might not have been satisfied in some areas – but I think 
I would have been a happier man.”

Michael admitted in an interview that his late 20s had been a very depressing 
time for him after he lost his partner, the designer Anselmo Feleppa, to an 
Aids-related illness in 1993.

He said: “I had my very first relationship at 27 because I really had not 
actually come to terms with my sexuality until I was 24. I lost my partner to 
HIV then it took about three years to grieve; then after that I lost my mother. 
I felt almost like I was cursed.”

He fronted a documentary about HIV to coincide with World Aids Day the year he 
came out. The film, Staying Alive, focused on the experiences of six young 
people from different countries who were either infected with or affected by 
the HIV virus.

He was also a passionate supporter of the HIV charity the Terrence Higgins 
Trust. LGBT charity Stonewall tweeted its sadness at the news of his death, 
saying:

George Michael RIP. You soundtracked so many moments, and your visibility and 
pride helped 90s LGBT kids like me realise we weren't alone.
