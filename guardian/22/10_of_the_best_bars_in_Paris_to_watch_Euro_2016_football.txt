From 10 June to 10 July, Paris will be transformed into Europe’s capital of 
football as France hosts the Euro 2016 tournament. It will be big, of course, 
in the city’s numerous sports bars, Irish taverns and faux English pubs such as 
theCoq & Bulldog <https://www.facebook.com/The-Coq-Bulldog-Pub-226637367401560/>
 or theFrog et Rosbif <http://www.frogpubs.com/pub-the-frog-rosbif-paris-1.php>
, but everybistrot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jul/17/paris.restaurants>, bar and 
cafe will also be installing TV screens, not just for those cheering on Les 
Bleus, but for fans from abroad flooding into Paris and looking for places to 
watch their nation compete. Games will be shown on giant screens at a massive 
fan zone in the Champ-de-Mars by the Eiffel Tower, and Les Berges de l’Europe 
(the pedestrian banks of the Seine by the Pont de Solférino) will have 
concerts, food trucks and parties. Just be prepared for very strict security 
checks. To find the nearest watering hole showing your favourite match, go to
allomatch.com <http://www.allomatch.com/> but these 10 bars do have a genuine 
neighbourhood feel.

The cosmopolitan, buzzing Belleville and Ménilmontant quartiers are a gold 
mine for neighbourhood bars, cheap and cheerful bistrots and live music venues. 
The atmospheric Tontons Bringueurs is a mix of all three, and while owner Yves 
Barruet loves to project cult 1950s French thrillers on to a huge wall, the 
place swiftly converts into a sports bar once a big match kicks off. If a game 
coincides with the 5pm-10pm happy hour, Yves generously extends until the final 
whistle, while bar snacks range from hot dogs and bruschetta to roasted 
camembert with honey. Don’t miss the killer absinthe selection, plus more than 
20 jars ofrhum arrangé – rums infused with spices like ginger or cinnamon. 
After the match, catch an indie concert at eitherLa Bellevilloise 
<http://www.labellevilloise.com/> or La Maroquinerie 
<http://www.lamaroquinerie.fr/>, on the same street.

The cosy Magellan is in a narrow sidestreet near where the November bomb 
attacks began, at theCarillon 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Carillon/118481121541684> bar and Le Petit 
Cambodge <http://lepetitcambodge.fr/#/>. But this nightlife neighbourhood is as 
busy as it always was, and to be sure of bagging a seat on the Magellan’s comfy 
leather Chesterfield, get there at least an hour before the match. Happy Hour 
is 6pm-8pm and is not suspended during games as is often the case in more 
classic sports bars. A generous plate of cheese and charcuterie is €10, and 
there is a good selection of Belgian beers. The laid-back local clientele run 
poker tournaments, and this is one of the rare spots in Paris to boast a dart 
board. The friendly owner/barman, Olivier Sayrou, admits he is more of a rugby 
fan, but expects big crowds during Euro 2016.

The fashionable Marais is home to one of Paris’s most famous Scottish pubs, the
Auld Alliance <http://www.theauldalliance.com/>. It still serves haggis and has 
half-a-dozen TV screens, but the Alliance is a shadow of its old self. A much 
better bet is to walk across the busy rue de Rivoli towards Place des Vosges to 
the snug Pure Malt. This is a genuine Scottish boozer, whose garrulous landlord 
Shep – Colin Shepherd from Aberdeen – opened in 2009 after he got fed up with 
working in themed Scottish bars that were run and mostly staffed by Frenchmen. 
It stocks more than 100 pure malts, Brewdog ales and no food apart from packets 
of crisps. A sign outside prohibits hipsters, but that is just Shep teasing the 
tourists. Scotland may not have made it to Euro 2016, but there will still be a 
great atmosphere here for every match.

Off busy Boulevard Haussman, the funky Bambolina is known as the best bar in 
Paris for watching Italian soccer, and is a second home to the raucous Paris 
San Gennar, the local club for Napoli fans, along with Juventini, Milanistas 
and Interistas. The bar has featured in Italy’s sports daily, La Gazzetta dello 
Sport, and French TV crews regularly turn up to film during big matches. Around 
60 people can cram into Bambolina, and though getting a seat when Italy is 
playing will not be easy, owner Andrea Conti guarantees an electric atmosphere 
for all the Euro 2016 games. Order a Bambolina spritz or chilled Peroni, then 
Andrea’s famous lasagne and homemade tiramisu.

If you think watching an England match in a German bar is a bad idea - 
especially if the match goes to penalties – think again, as the friendly Titon 
is a surprising venue. It may serve curry wurst, pretzels, apple strudel and 
foaming steins ofweissbier, but the bar is actually owned by a couple of 
Frenchmen, Joel and Stéphane, who fell in love with Germany during a holiday in 
Berlin and have created a one-off locale with a uniquefranco-allemande 
ambiance. So if France is playing, choose from the wide list of French organic 
wines and order acroque-monsieur or a steak tartare, followed by crème brûlée. 
Weather permitting, a big screen will be set up on the terrace which, during 
the last World Cup, helped put the cafe at the centre of a huge street party.

There are dozens of places in which to watch Euro 2016 in this bustling corner 
of the 10th arrondissement, from a Turkish kebab joint to football-mad Algerian 
cafes. But if France is playing, head for this classic corner cafe, taken over 
a few months ago by two Parisian brothers, Arnaud and Xavier. Both big footie 
fans, they are putting in a big screen for the tournament, but Arnaud says it 
will disappear afterwards, because “we don’t want a bar with a TV where 
everyone looks at the screen, no one talks and no one listens to the music”. 
The cafe serves craft beers, organic wines and traditional dishes such as beef 
cheeks orboudin noir blood sausage and mash.

Kieran Loughney and sons Donal and Kevin decamped from Dublin 10 years ago to 
found Patrick’s, for many people the best pub in Paris. You’ll find more 
Parisians here than noisy expats, and they come for draft Guinness, one of the 
world’s biggest selections of Irish whiskies – over 350 at the last count – 
dozens of Irish craft ales, and an unbeatable lunch menu at €10 for a juicy 
burger, fat hand-cut chips and a beer. There are three TVs surrounded by 
battered leather armchairs and velvet sofas, and for big matches, the end room 
is dominated by a huge roll-down screen. If Patrick’s gets too packed and 
noisy, another Loughney son runs the more relaxedGreen Goose 
<http://www.greengoose.fr/> just up the road, with food more gastro than pub 
grub.

This is a wonderfully preserved belle époque bistrot. With its enormous bay 
windows, art nouveau mirrors and paintings, it’s an oasis amid the area’s 
tourist traps and sleazy strip clubs. But when it is time for a big match, the 
TV takes pride of place in front of the mirror and locals crowd in, along with 
a few curious tourists. Owner James Patou offers a wide choice of wines and

Belgium’s Red Devils are one of the favourites for Euro 2016, and plenty of 
Belgian bars in Paris will be screening matches. La Gueuze, named after the 
country’s lambic beer, is a lively student haunt right by the Sorbonne, handy 
for the Latin Quarter’s tourist attractions. There is La Mort Subite on draft, 
and bottles ranging from Trappist ales to fruitykriek (cherries) and framboise 
(raspberries), and a steaming plate ofmoules-frites will set you back €12.50.

Parisians flood to this peculiarly named bar every time there is a big game. 
Between the Irish bars that line Boulevard Haussmann and mega sports bars like 
Le Players, Thirsty is almost a quiet, cosy alternative. The food is basically 
burgers andsteak-frites, while exotic cocktails, tequila shots and jägerbombs 
are just as popular as pints, with Guinness and Kilkenny on tap. Faithful 
England fans may remember it as the site of a pub festooned with red and white 
flags and called The Lions. The owners sold up a couple of years ago but have 
nowreopened <http://www.thelionsparis.fr/> near the 13th arrondissement’s 
Chinatown.
