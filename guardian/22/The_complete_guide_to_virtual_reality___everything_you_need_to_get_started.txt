Until recently, virtual reality had been something of a fantasy for 
storytellers and technologists. As long ago as 1935, American science fiction 
writer Stanley G Weinbaum described something like virtual reality in a short 
story calledPygmalion’s Spectacles 
<http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22893/22893-h/22893-h.htm>.

“But listen – a movie that gives one sight and sound. Suppose now I add taste, 
smell, even touch, if your interest is taken by the story. Suppose I make it so 
that you are in the story, you speak to the shadows, and the shadows reply, and 
instead of being on a screen, the story is all about you, and you are in it. 
Would that be to make real a dream?”

Technologists might still be working on smell and taste, but Albert Ludwig’s 
“magic spectacles” eerily foreshadow the current prominence for headsets and 
360-degree games, videos and virtual worlds.

Virtual reality for the masses is here. But do the masses want VR?

Since Ludwig’s magic spectacles found their way into print, there have been 
decades of experimentation around virtual reality, from the first head-mounted 
VR system in the late 1960s to the first commercial products in the 1980s – not 
to mention Hollywood’s interpretation in the1992 film The Lawnmower Man, which 
shaped mainstream perceptions of virtual reality, or VR, for some time 
afterwards.

The current age of virtual reality began in 2010, when American teenager 
Palmer Luckey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-rift-vr-palmer-luckey-trump-shitposts>
 created the first prototype of a VR headset that would evolve into the Oculus 
Rift. Two years later, he launched a $250,000 Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign 
to commercialise it – and $2.4m of pledges later, the tech industry’s interest 
in VR was reborn. Two years after that, Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, liked 
the Rift so muchhe bought the company for $2bn

Several competitors have emerged since then, from the HTC Vive and Sony’s 
PlayStation <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/playstation> VR to 
smartphone-powered headsets such as Samsung’s Gear VR and Google Cardboard. 
Meanwhile, hundreds of developers are making VR games and apps, film-makers are 
exploring the potential for documentaries and animation, and Facebook and 
YouTube have jumped on the bandwagon with 360-degree videos.

But if you’re new to virtual reality, where should you start? In the absence 
of a passing professor with magic specs, here’s everything you need to know 
about hardware, apps and games.

The basics

The most important piece of a virtual reality kit is the headset, a device 
like a thick pair of goggles that goes over your eyes. The more expensive, 
higher quality headsets need to be connected to a computer to run apps and 
games, while some cheaper ones use a cellphone clipped to the front of the 
headset.

All headsets need to be used alongside a good quality pair of headphones, and 
there are other optional accessories from hand controllers to treadmills that 
are all designed to enhance your simulated experience of being in another 
world. Hand controllers translate your real-world gestures into whatever game 
or application you’re using, although standard gaming joypads can also be used.

VR devices have their own app stores, similar to smartphone app stores, where 
you can browse and download games and apps. Some of these stores are accessed 
using the device itself, while others – the VR section of the Steam digital 
games store, for example – can be browsed on your computer.

Oculus Rift

Four years after its first crowdfunding campaign, the first commercial version 
of Oculus Rift launched in early 2016, sold initially from theOculus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/oculus> VR website and gradually made 
its way to retailers around the world.

Until now, you needed a powerful PC to use the Oculus Rift. The minimum specs 
for an Oculus Ready PC areon the official website 
<https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/oculus-ready-pcs/>, with Dell, HP, Alienware and 
Asus all offering VR-ready machines. Oculus VR has also launched bundles of 
Rift with a PC, such as the$2,050 Alienware bundle 
<http://www.alienware.co.uk/oculus/>.

That said, Oculus has just announced that thanks to some technology it has 
dubbed “asynchronous spacewarp”,the Rift will now work with PCs costing as 
little as $500 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/virtual-reality-future-oculus-rift-vr?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other>
.

Oculus is expanding its hardware offering, and in December Oculus will launch 
a dedicatedOculus Touch <https://www3.oculus.com/touch/> controller, which 
translates your hand gestures into the virtual environment. At $199, it’s not 
cheap.

Price: $599 (£549) includes the headset with built-in headphones and mic, 
movement sensor, remote and Xbox One controller.

You’ll also need: a powerful PC – check the recommended specs 
<https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/oculus-ready-pcs/>.

Best for: early adopters, and anyone keen for a first-hand view of how 
Facebook will make virtual reality more social.

Verdict: Oculus Rift kickstarted the newest generation of VR and has an 
inventive community of developers making games and apps for it – even if a few 
haveditched it in protest over its founder’s political activities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/27/vr-developers-oculus-rift-pro-trump-support>
. Facebook’s financial backing should ensure the Rift is in it for the long 
haul, too.

 HTC’s Vive has been the most direct competitor for the Oculus Rift so far. 
Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images 
Vive is a direct rival to Oculus Rift, though several games and apps are 
available for both devices. Like the Rift, it requires a PC to run its 
software, and HTC helps buyers get the right kit by maintaining a list ofVive 
Ready <https://www.vive.com/us/ready/> computers, including partners Alienware, 
HP and MSI.

The Vive has some unique features, including a front-facing camera which, in 
certain apps, can bring the real world into your virtual environments. You also 
get two hand-worn gestural controllers in the box, unlike the Rift, which 
partly explains the higher price.

The Vive also comes with a base station that tracks your movements, so within 
fairly tight limits you can walk around inside your VR space. This means a 
longer setup process, comparable to setting up a high-end home-audio system 
properly rather than just bunging your stereo on a shelf – but as more apps and 
games use the option, it could prove to be the Vive’s killer feature.

Price: $799 (£759) includes the headset, two wireless hand-controllers, two 
base stations and a link box to connect it to your computer.

You’ll also need: a powerful PC – check the recommended specs 
<https://www.vive.com/us/ready/>.

Best for: anyone who wants the absolute top-spec (for now) home VR system, 
with a mix of gaming and non-gaming.

Verdict: HTC Vive is the most expensive system on the market, and also the one 
that takes most effort to set up. Yet once you’ve done that, the ability to 
walk around within your virtual space, as well as turn your head, is 
impressive. The involvement of Valve, with its Steam store, means there’s a big 
community of developers too.

Sony PlayStation VR

The third big gun in the VR race is Sony’s PlayStation VR headset, which 
launched in October 2016 as an accessory for the PlayStation 4 games console. 
Both the PlayStation 4 and newPlayStation 4 Pro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/07/playstation-4-pro-announced-release-date-and-price-revealed>
 are compatible with the headsets, but the pro will run VR games at higher 
screen resolutions and frame rates.

PlayStation VR will use the PS4’s standard console controller, the DualShock 
4, but you’ll need the $60 PlayStation Camera accessory too.

Sony <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sony> is keen for PlayStation VR 
to be more than a solitary experience: a feature called VR Social Screen shows 
what you’re seeing in the headset on your TV screen, so friends can join in or 
watch.

PlayStation VR review – there's magic, but the mainstream is a way off
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/06/playstation-vr-review-theres-magic-but-the-mainstream-is-a-way-off>
Being part of the PlayStation world inevitably means that games are an even 
bigger focus for PlayStation VR than for Oculus Rift and Vive. Sony has more 
than 100 games confirmed already, with 50 of them due to arrive by the end of 
2016.

Price: $399 (£350) for the headset, processor unit, earphones and cables.

You’ll also need: PlayStation Camera, which costs $45 (£39). Although you can 
use standard PS4 joypads for games, some will support the PlayStation Move 
motion controllers, which cost $99 (£70) for a twin-pack.

Best for: gamers – or PlayStation 4 gamers at least, since there’s 
(unsurprisingly) no cross-console compatibility with Xbox One or Nintendo’s 
consoles.

Verdict: as the first console-connected VR headset out of the blocks, 
PlayStation VR is also the most affordable high-end model even if you have to 
buy the PS4 to run it. There are some impressive launch titles, while Sony’s 
clout means there will be a strong pipeline of titles in the months and years 
ahead, though there may be slimmer pickings for non-game VR apps.

Samsung Gear VR

With Gear VR, we’re into the category of VR headset that use your smartphone 
as both the screen and processor. Samsung’s headset uses technology from Oculus 
VR, although it isn’t as powerful as the Rift. It only works with Samsung’s S6 
and S7 smartphone series, as well as the Galaxy Note7 phablet (though if you 
still have a Note7 put the device down and step away slowly – the phone has 
been the subject of aninternational recall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/19/samsung-galaxy-note-7-fire-damage-owners-angry>
 after a problem with exploding batteries).

Gear VR can be bought as a standalone device, but some retailers will include 
one in when you buy a newSamsung 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/samsung> smartphone so it’s worth 
scouting about for deals.

Games <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> and apps are available 
through Samsung’s Oculus Home software, with a growing catalogue of apps, games 
and content. For Samsung owners, the Gear VR is an affordable way to explore 
virtual reality even if its graphical capabilities – and the processor of the 
device running its software – are less powerful than its rivals.

Price: $100 (£100) for the headset.

You’ll also need: a recent Samsung smartphone or phablet.

Best for: cost-conscious VR newcomers who don’t want to be tied to a computer 
or console while exploring virtual worlds and games.

Verdict: Gear VR should help grow a more mainstream audience for VR, and has a 
growing collection of apps and games. Its one restriction is that it can only 
be used with Samsung smartphones, so anyone with an iPhone or other Android 
handset is out of luck.

Google Cardboard and Daydream

Cardboard was Google’s first commercial attempt at virtual reality, and yes, 
the headsets were made of actual cardboard.

Google made the spec for these flat-pack headsets available to other 
companies, which means there are 13 models fromGoogle’s own 
<https://vr.google.com/intl/en_uk/cardboard/get-cardboard/> basic $15 model to 
Speck’s $70 Pocket-VR with CandyShell Grip, although the latter includes a 
protective case for your smartphone.

There are a growing number of apps available on the Android and iOS app 
stores, from 360-photography to games and documentaries. While not as powerful 
as more expensive headsets, there is some exciting experimentation going on 
here.

Google’s follow-up to Cardboard, Daydream 
<https://vr.google.com/intl/en_uk/daydream/headset/>, was announced in May 
2016. Its software will be built into the new Android smartphones (it is part 
of Nougat, the latest version of Android) as well as hardware, in the form of 
headsets and handheld controllers. Google’s headset, the Daydream View, is made 
of fabric rather than cardboard, and comes with a motion controller used to 
translate your gestures into apps and games.

Google services such as YouTube, Street View and Photos will all support 
Daydream headsets, and launch partners include Netflix, the Wall Street 
Journal, the New York Times, the Guardian, JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and 
Major League Baseball who will all provide apps.The Guardian’s offering 
<https://www.theguardian.com/vr>, Underworld, explores London’s subterranean 
web of Victorian sewers and lost waterways in the shoes of an urban explorer.

Price: Google Cardboard headsets vary in price, but most are $15-$25 
(£15-£25). Daydream View costs $79 (£69), including a controller.

You’ll also need: a smartphone – Cardboard headsets and apps support a wide 
range of Android phones and iPhones. Daydream View is more restricted: at 
launch it will work with Google’s new Pixel smartphones, but a range of 
Daydream-supporting Android phones will come out over the next year.

Best for: getting started with VR cheaply and easily, particularly for 
non-Samsung owners.

Verdict: Daydream View will offer strong competition for the Gear VR. 
Cardboard is excellent for dabblers, and while some of its apps are fairly 
limited experiences, others offer plenty to see, do and play.

Microsoft in the wings

As well as working on the augmented-reality headset HoloLens, Microsoft is 
working with hardware partners tomake a range of headsets for Windows PCs 
<http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/26/13418156/microsoft-windows-10-holographic-virtual-reality-headset-announced-price>
, starting at $299 when they go on sale in the spring of 2017.

“We’re really thinking how are we going to democratise this technology, how 
are we going to work with these partners to build devices that can reach all 
price points, that can reach everyone on the planet,”Microsoft’s Terry Myserson 
told ZDNet 
<http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-windows-chief-myerson-talks-windows-10-priorities-vr-headsets-surface-hardware-goals/>
. “One way you can think about these VR accessories is as an external monitor. 
It’s not technically accurate, but conceptually I think it works quite well. 
You put on the headset and you’re looking at another monitor.”

Accessories

A slew of other virtual reality products are coming on to the market beyond 
the big-name headsets. The early success of Oculus Rift on Kickstarter has made 
the crowdfunding site a focus for VR startups touting interesting hardware.

From headsets (Impression Pi, ANTVR, Cmoar, Opto, FOVE) to controllers (STEM 
System, Control VR, Gloveone, iMotion) there are plenty of projects to explore, 
although be warned – the Oculus, HTC, Sony and Samsung devices receive the 
lion’s share of attention, so you’ll need to research developer support for 
each device to work out if it’s compatible with your systembefore committing 
your cash.

There is also the OSVR project <http://www.razerzone.com/osvr> by gaming 
hardware company Razer, which is trying to create open standards around VR so 
that people can mix and match different headsets and accessories. For now, 
there are two versions of its prototype hacker development kit available to 
buy, although Razer is hoping manufacturers will use its standards to make 
their own headsets.

How do you film VR?

The cameras and editing software needed to film and then knit together VR 
footage involve a whole other level of complexity and expense. At $45,000,
Nokia’s OZO camera <https://ozo.nokia.com/> is out of most people’s price range 
but is a good example of the kind of kit that professional film-makers are 
using.

More affordable is Samsung’s Gear 360 spherical camera 
<http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-360/>, which costs $350, and which 
has front and rear lenses to capture 180-degree shots both horizontally and 
vertically to create panoramic video or photo. It’s still an expensive gadget 
for an average person, but if you want to explore making your own VR videos, 
it’s a good starting point.

There are a number of other 360-degree cameras available, like the Ricoh Theta 
S <https://theta360.com/en/>, Kodak Pixpro SP360 4K Action Cam 
<https://kodakpixpro.com/Americas/cameras/actioncam/sp3604k/>, LG 360 Cam 
<http://www.lg.com/uk/lg-friends/lg-LGR105>, Giroptic 360cam 
<http://eu.360.tv/en/> and the Vuze Camera <http://vuze.camera/>. It’s also 
worth keeping tabs on crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo as 
new camera projects pop up regularly.

360 vs virtual reality

The terms “360” and “virtual reality” are often used interchangeably, but 
there are important differences. The 360-degree photos and videos are panoramic 
pics and videos that have been stitched together, so you can turn your head to 
look around you. But these aren’t virtual worlds: you don’t have free movement 
to explore them as you do in full virtual reality experiences.

All VR devices offer a mixture of both, however: you can watch 360 videos or 
explore virtual worlds with Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard.

Augmented reality vs virtual reality

There are other headsets that let you experience digital wizardry but offer a 
different experience called augmented reality.

While virtual reality is about immersing you in an entirely virtual world, 
viewed through a screen in your headset, the real world outside you isn’t part 
of the experience – at least not until you trip over the cat or accidentally 
knock out your child while immersed elsewhere. But augmented reality, as the 
name suggests, is about augmenting oradding to reality reality. You might be 
looking at your cat or up your street, but there could be digital characters 
and content overlaid on them.

Glass, the hi-tech spectacles launched by Google in 2014, were an AR device, 
but the company has given up on trying to sell them as a mainstream idea. More 
hardware is on the way, however:Microsoft’s HoloLens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/19/hololens-the-virtual-reality-headset-for-elevator-repair>
 will be the augmented reality equivalent of PlayStation VR and with a similar 
emphasis on gaming; the popular Minecraft has been one of the key demos for it.

Meanwhile, a Florida-based startup called Magic Leap has raised an astonishing 
$1.4bn in funding forits AR headset and technology 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/07/magic-leap-headset-design-patent-virtual-reality>
, giving only afew teasers 
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2E1x3l45YUO2eOhRv-A7lw> on what it looks 
like and how it will work.

For now, the most affordable way to try augmented reality is through 
smartphone apps, which overlay text and graphics on the feed from the camera. 
The game Pokémon Go and the face-mangling lenses in Snapchat both use augmented 
reality. Others are more specific: the DFS Sofa and Room Planner (see how a new 
sofa might look in your living room), Plane Finder AR (see where that plane 
overhead is going by pointing your camera at it) and Mardles (make 3D 
characters jump out of stickers for kids).

Virtual reality beyond gaming

Games loom large in modern-day VR, partly because the original Oculus Rift and 
PlayStation VR headsets were made primarily for gamers, and also because games 
are the most easily understandable entertainment category to show off this 
technology. But as Mark Zuckerberg explained after announcing Facebook was 
buying Oculus VR, there’s a lot more to this than just games.

“This is just the start. After games, we’re going to make Oculus a platform 
for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, 
studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or 
consulting with a doctor face to face – just by putting on goggles in your 
home,”wrote Zuckerberg <https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971>.

“This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you 
can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. 
Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire 
experiences and adventures.”

Journalism and film-making

Hundreds of developers are working on VR games, but there is lots of activity 
around other kinds of entertainment and media too. Journalists, film-makers and 
a growing number of documentary-makers are using 360-degree cameras to find new 
angles on stories, if you’ll pardon the pun.

Film-maker Chris Milk set up his virtual reality company in 2014 to produce 
and distribute VR documentaries, and offers films shot in New York, Cuba and 
even Syria. “I’m not interested in the novelty factor,”Milk told the Guardian 
in 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/29/virtual-reality-documentary-middle-man-journalism-chris-milk-film>
. “I’m interested in the foundations for a medium that could be more powerful 
than cinema, than theatre, than literature, than any other medium we’ve had 
before to connect one human being to another.”

Traditional media companies have also experimented with VR journalism, from 
the New York Times VR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/20/new-york-times-google-nyt-vr-cardboard-virtual-reality>
 films to theGuardian’s 6x9 project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/apr/27/6x9-a-virtual-experience-of-solitary-confinement>
, which explores solitary confinement. As the cost of shooting and editing VR 
footage comes down, expect to see more media companies exploring the potential.

Social media

When Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was to buy Oculus, he said that 
virtual reality could be the next big social platform and connect more than a 
billion people. That seems a contradiction when the current version of software 
being created for these headsets is focused on solo experiences while wearing a 
device that isolates you from the people around you.

Yet some companies are trying to make VR more social. Oculus has launched “
Social Beta <https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/825923220795204/>” 
software that enables people to watch online video services Twitch and Vimeo in 
a virtual cinema with other people. It has also shown off Toybox, a prototype 
virtual toy-room where two people can interact with a range of objects together.

Tech startups are exploring social VR too. AltspaceVR <http://altvr.com/> 
wants people to “be together in a more natural way than a phone call, text or 
video chat” by creating avatars and wandering around its virtual worlds, and is 
available for some headsets already. Its rivalvTime <https://vtime.net/> is 
available for Gear VR, Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard, styling itself as a 
“sociable network” for people to meet up for avatar-based chat.

Sports and music

Would you watch a football match or music concert in a virtual world? A number 
of companies hope so, and are busy building the technology.

NextVR <http://www.nextvr.com/#/> is focusing on sport and entertainment, and 
has already worked on the US Open tennis tournament and several boxing matches, 
as well as a live Coldplay gig. It is preparing to produce a series of music 
concerts with live promoter Live Nation.

Another company, Voke <http://vokevr.com/live-virtual-reality-entertainment>, 
is working with stars including Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony, whileLiveLike 
<http://www.livelikevr.com/#sectionHome> wants to broadcast sports matches in 
VR for friends to watch together while chatting. British broadcaster Sky 
recently launched aGoogle Cardboard app 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/sky-360-videos-vr-app-beckham-star-wars>
, which includes a sports show fronted by David Beckham alongside news reports

 TheWaveVR will soon launch its music VR app. 
Tourism

One of the key selling points for VR technology is its ability to put you in 
places you’re unlikely to visit in the flesh, whether too expensive, too 
dangerous, out of bounds because of mobility issues or just because you don’t 
like flying.

You can already use VR to climb Everest <http://www.solfar.com/everest-vr/>, 
explore the Grand Canyon 
<http://www.immersiveent.com/the-grand-canyon-vr-experience/>, take a gondola 
ride in Venice <http://www.discoveryvr.com/watch/gondola-ride-in-venice/details>
 and watch a range ofstartling 360-degree videos 
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSSPBo7OVSZt1kg5D2Z13-sBn9TqzTbUV> 
published by wearable-cameras firm GoPro from around the world. Looking even 
further afield,Mars 2030 
<http://www.roadtovr.com/nasa-fusion-mars-2030-virtual-reality-size-of-skyrim/> 
will let you wander around the surface of Mars.

Oculus VR sees the potential in virtual travel. “There’s clearly value in 
real-world experiences: going to do things. That’s why we have field trips. The 
problem is that the majority of people will never be able to do the majority of 
those experiences,”claimed its founder Palmer Luckey in 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/03/oculus-vr-founder-classrooms-are-broken>
.

“People could say: ‘But visiting France virtually will never be the same as 
visiting Paris in the real world.’ Well, it might not be the same. What matters 
a lot more is that everybody is able to experience it.”

Medical and therapeutic


Virtual reality technology is also being explored by the healthcare industry. 
Medical Realities is a company using VR, AR and games to train medical 
students, with itsVirtual Surgeon <http://www.medicalrealities.com/> programme 
enabling them to experience operations from the surgeon’s perspective. The 
companylive-streamed an operation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/14/cutting-edge-theatre-worlds-first-virtual-reality-operation-goes-live>
 earlier this year to test its tech.Osso VR <http://www.ossovr.net/>, 
meanwhile, has developed surgery simulation for trainees, which works with 
Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.

The Los Angeles Cedars-Sinai hospital is also exploring whether VR can have 
therapeutic value <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpcNhnU-Aaw>, helping 
patients relax by flying above Iceland in a helicopter or swimming with whales, 
whileMindMaze <http://www.mindmaze.ch/> is making VR software that could play a 
role in the rehabilitation of stroke, spinal-cord injury and amputee patients.

Adult entertainment

Well, this was inevitable. Porn producers are famous early adopters of new 
audio/visual technology, and that trend has continued into VR. From 
point-of-view videos to animated sex simulations – and evena dedicated VR 
category on popular site PornHub 
<http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/23/hands-on-pornhub-vr/> – if there’s money to 
be made from virtual reality, chances are the adult-entertainment industry will 
find it first. Even if the results are “cold, silly, downright terrifying 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/09/how-virtual-reality-porn-could-bring-about-world-peace>
” for some viewers.

What next?

As a technology, virtual reality already has decades of experimentation (and 
hype) behind it, even if it is still early days for this latest generation of 
devices. That means you can expect the technology to improve rapidly, while the 
first few waves of apps and games are still figuring out how to make the most 
of it.

There’s a good argument for waiting until the technology, and the content 
created for it, is more established, more compelling and cheaper. But equally, 
there’s delight to be had in being one of the first to explore a whole new 
virtual world of entertainment, information and communication, as thousands of 
developers, games designers and film-makers explore the medium and its new 
creative potential.

Whether you’re an enthusiast, a sceptic, or somewhere in the middle, 2017 is 
going to be a big year in figuring out the real potential for this technology. 
When your grandkids ask where you were virtual reality took off, what will you 
say?
