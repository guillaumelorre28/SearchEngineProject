Hundreds of Uber <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber> drivers have 
not been paid this week and have been told they will have to wait until next 
week to get their earnings.

The taxi-hailing service, which is already facing legal claims from drivers 
who believe they have beenwrongly classed as self-employed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status>
, said drivers in Scotland and a number of cities outside London had been 
affected by what it said was a banking glitch.

An Uber spokesperson said: “Unfortunately an error by the bank has meant that 
payments due by today were delayed to a very small proportion of drivers who 
use our app. We immediately contacted the bank about this and they have already 
re-initiated the payments to arrive by Monday. We have contacted everybody 
affected to explain what has happened and offer our sincere apologies.”

Uber sent an email to drivers telling them they would receive payment on 
Monday, but some drivers claimed they had been warned that their money may not 
arrive until next Wednesday.

Without their weekly pay, some drivers said they would be unable to pay bills 
or buy petrol in order to work over the weekend. Others had incurred bank fees, 
because direct debit payments had gone out of their bank without cover from 
their expected pay.


One driver said: “If I am unable to get payment then I am left with half a 
tank of fuel and then I am out of work.”

Steve Garelick, a branch secretary at the GMB trade union who was involved in 
a high court action against Uber over the employment status of drivers, said: 
“Surely it is not beyond the wit of man to make a payment in a prompt fashion. 
How do they expect people to cover this? Are Uber going to compensate drivers 
for the extra expenses they incur?”
