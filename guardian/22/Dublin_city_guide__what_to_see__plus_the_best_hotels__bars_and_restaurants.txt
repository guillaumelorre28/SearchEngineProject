This is a big year for Ireland and its capital. The country is preparing to 
mark thecentenary of the Easter Rising 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/25/easter-rising-tour-dublin-google-maps-colin-farrell>
, a rebellion that culminated in Irish independence, and Dublin is set to be 
the centre of the commemoration. There have been debates over how 1916 should 
be celebrated, but O’Connell Street’s neoclassical General Post Office, the de 
facto headquarters of the insurrection, will be at the centre of things,hosting 
an immersive exhibition <http://www.gpowitnesshistory.ie/>, from 29 March.

The Dublin of 2016 is a city that feels optimistic but also a little 
shell-shocked. Eight years ago, the capital was financially crippled, but there 
was a silver lining in the form of a booming independent arts scene. Today, 
Dublin is getting its finances back on track, and DIY culture appears to have 
had its day. Boom-time cranes are back, as developments in the docklands area 
move on apace; the construction of a cross-city tramline has seen large parts 
of town excavated, and there are rumblings that College Green will be 
pedestrianised to make way for a grand plaza. And as property prices rise, some 
say the closing down of art spaces, such as Block T and The Joinery, is the 
work of a city rediscovering its Celtic Tiger strength.

resilience. Photograph: Alamy 
Amid all this tumult, something exciting has emerged. Off the radar as a 
culinary destination a mere decade ago, Dublin is home to a growing number of 
quality restaurants, casual eateries and cafes. Top-notch Mexican, Brazilian, 
Korean and modern takes on Irish food are now commonplace. Dubliners are also 
getting pretty snobby about their coffee, which is no mean feat in a city once 
famous for milky tea and dark stout.

Of course, some things are perennially true of this place: its pubs and 
theatres are world class, its Georgian squares are elegant, and the 
faux-traditional eastern end of Temple Bar is an overpriced tourist trap. The 
city is also famously compact – though visitors seeking laid-back charm are 
often surprised to find that life here moves at a brisk pace. This is, after 
all, a metropolis with a regional population approaching two million, huddled 
around a city centre that feels more like a large town.

Royal Hibernian Academy

The Hugh Lane <http://hughlane.ie/> and the Irish Museum of Modern Art 
<http://www.imma.ie/en/index.htm> might get most of the press, but the Royal 
Hibernian Academy is one of the city’s best art spaces. Home to works by 
artists such asMaeve McCarthy <http://www.maevemccarthy.net/> and David Farrell 
<http://www.davidfarrell.org/>, the building itself – which stands in stark, 
modernist contrast to its Georgian terrace neighbours – is worth the visit 
alone. The academy’s original home was Academy House, on the north side of the 
city, but the building and most of its contents were destroyed by fire during 
the 1916 rising. The exhibition27th of April Last 
<http://www.rhagallery.ie/exhibitions/27th-of-april-last/>, opening 22 March 
(until 11 June), marks the rebellion with a look at the Academy’s devastating 
loss of their original building and how it survived without an exhibition hall 
for nearly 70 years.

Small, fun and daring, the Science Gallery has been a city favourite since 
opening in 2008. Exhibitions are pitched as a blend of science and art, and 
have explored everything from trauma to failed inventions. A recent show 
horrified and enthralled Dubliners in equal measure, when its centrepiece 
turned out to be cheeses cultivated from bacteria found on parts of the human 
body. Housed in Trinity College Dublin’s Naughton Institute, the team behind 
the gallery not only put on some of Ireland’s most exciting exhibitions, it 
also has the world in its sights, with hubs in London, Melbourne and Bangalore 
set to open in the next two years. The cafe also serves some of the city’s best 
coffee.

Little Museum of Dublin

Situated in an imposing Georgian town house overlooking Saint Stephen’s Green, 
the Little Museum tells the story of 20th-century Dublin through a collection 
of donated ephemera – everything from models of one-time Dublin landmark 
Nelson’s Pillar to a room dedicated to U2. Brainchild of food critic and former 
magazine editor Trevor White, it regularly hosts exhibitions on unusual aspects 
of Dublin life, with guides bringing the material to life. Look out for an 
offbeat comic strip telling the story of the 1916 rising by artistFergal 
McCarthy, running until 24 April

Library Project

A notable exception to the tourist traps of Temple Bar, the Library Project is 
part-art book store, part-library for all things photographic. This might not 
be the best place to pick up a tome on Henri Cartier-Bresson; rather, it’s a 
repository of almost 1,000 books from independent publishers all over the 
world. Situated on Temple Bar’s eponymous main drag, it’s just minutes away 
from theGallery of Photography <http://www.galleryofphotography.ie/>.

 The Ha’penny bridge. Photograph: Corbis 
The narrow river Liffey is as much a part of Dublin life as its packed pubs 
and, with 23 bridges across it in all, no trip would be complete without a 
stroll across at least two or three. In the heart of town, must-sees are the 
famously wide O’Connell bridge, the Venetian-styleHa’penny bridge 
<http://www.bridgesofdublin.ie/bridges/hapenny-bridge>, and sweeping Grattan 
bridge <http://www.bridgesofdublin.ie/bridges/grattan-bridge>, with its 
characteristic seahorse lamps. Further east is the strikingly modern (if 
unloved by some)Samuel Beckett bridge 
<http://www.bridgesofdublin.ie/bridges/samuel-beckett-bridge>, designed by 
Spanish architectSantiago Calatrava 
<http://www.bridgesofdublin.ie/bridge-building/bridge-designers/santiago-calatrava>
. Heading west is Calatrava’s other Dublin offering, the James Joyce Bridge, 
and much further west is the archingIsland bridge 
<http://www.bridgesofdublin.ie/bridges/island-bridge>, which feels as though it 
is in the countryside.

 A soy potato roll at Hophouse/Kimchi 
Hophouse/Kimchi

Dublin’s so-called Chinatown is really a mix of Chinese and Korean 
restaurants, bars and cafes that sprung up on the north side’s tumbledown 
Parnell Street East in the boom years of the 1990s and early 2000s. More 
recently, Vietnamese restaurants have joined them. Many of these eateries 
occupy buildings that were once pubs, and Hophouse, considered one of the best 
in the city, is a fun mix of Korean restaurant and Irish bar. This may not be 
the fanciest place in town, but it’s an exciting and authentic blend of Dublin 
old and new. Thejeyuk (fried pork, €13.50) is a delight, as is the salmon 
bibimbap (mixed rice) at €10.90.

Delahunt


Delahunt offers modern takes on Irish food in what was once a well-known pub. 
And while the decor here is simple – the original Edwardian-era bar has been 
retained – the dishes are endlessly inventive. Of note is the coddle, a 
traditional Dublin broth usually made from leftover pork sausages and onions, 
but appearing at Delahunt as a carefully balanced and richly flavoured bouillon 
of homemade sausages, braised bacon, cabbage, potato and bacon broth (€9). The 
roast rump of beef with potato cake, shallot, onion rings and bone marrow (€25) 
is equally fine.

The Stag’s Head

As classically Dublin as any pub can be, this Victorian-era charmer has 
wood-panelled snugs, chandeliers and, of course, the famous wall-mounted stag’s 
head. It’s one of the few Dublin bars that attracts both locals and tourists, 
and cited by some as the place to grab the city’s best Guinness. It’s dark and 
elegant at ground level, cosy and unfussy on the first floor; and the cellar 
bar downstairs is home to acomedy club

The Chelsea Drugstore

Dublin’s hippest new bar takes its name from a long-gone London 
chemist-cum-swinging-1960s-market (featured in Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork 
Orange and name-checked in the Rolling Stones’ You Can’t Always Get What You 
Want). The moniker isn’t just a straight-up homage, though – this was the site 
of a bustling chemists in the 1900s. South Great George’s Street has long been 
the centre of Dublin’s creative quarter – markets, music shops, architects’ 
offices – and this bar certainly delivers on the inventive. Offering cocktails 
like the Penicillin (whiskey, honey, ginger and absinthe, €12.50) and the Truth 
Behind Augustus (rye, Amaro Meletti, Fernet-Branca and grapefruit, €11.50), the 
aesthetic here is warm and minimalist with exposed brick walls and 
marble-topped tables.

The Black Sheep

Capel Street is one of the city’s most eclectic areas, with furniture stores, 
hip cafes, a famous gay bar (PantiBar <http://www.pantibar.com/>), Korean 
restaurants and toy shops sitting side by side. In fact, the locale might be 
called Dublin’s biggest open secret – not many tourists venture here. The Black 
Sheep is a stylish but unfussy craft-beer emporium run by the Galway Bay 
Brewery. It serves ales and lagers from all over the world, including Dubbel 
(€7) and Rauchbier Marzen (€6.50); while the pub-grub menu offers a great 
pulled-pork sandwich (€8.25) at lunch, and chicken, chorizo and butterbean stew 
(€12) at dinner.

 The Marker Hotel’s rooftop bar and terrace 
The Marker Hotel


Designed by Portuguese architect Manuel Aires Mateus 
<http://www.airesmateus.com/>, this hotel is meant to look as if it’s carved 
out of Irish rock, but some say it seems more like an exercise in Celtic 
Tiger-era extravagance. Either way, The Marker is without equal in this city of 
architecturally restrained lodgings. Located in the heart of Dublin’s so-called 
silicon docks, the hotel’s neighbours include Daniel Libeskind-designedBord 
Gáis Energy Theatre 
<http://libeskind.com/work/bord-gais-energy-theatre-and-grand-canal-commercial-development/>
 and the sleek European headquarters of tech giants Google and Facebook. Rooms 
here are expansive (and expensive), with an angular, geometric feel, and its 
rooftop bar offers some of the best views in the city – on a clear day, the 
Dublin and Wicklow mountains can be seen, gently punctuating the skyline.

The petite dame of the museum and gallery district – the grande dame being the 
Shelbourne – Buswells is a Dublin institution that offers restrained Georgian 
opulence in the heart of town. Rooms are compact and well-appointed, with those 
on the lower floors boasting higher ceilings, as is the case with nearly all of 
Dublin’s 18th-century town houses. It’s right beside the parliament of Ireland’s
Leinster House

, theNatural History Museum <http://www.museum.ie/Natural-History>, the 
National Library of Ireland <http://www.nli.ie/>, the archaeology branch of the 
National Museum of Ireland <http://www.museum.ie/Home>, and the National 
Gallery of Ireland <http://www.nationalgallery.ie/>.

The Dean


Reserved and understated on the outside, unapologetically hip on the inside, 
The Dean blasted onto Dublin’s hotel scene just two years ago. Rooms here look 
a little as though they’ve been transported from a Brooklyn brownstone and are 
given monikers such as “modpods” and “Hi-Fis”. Each is fitted out with 
distressed-seeming wooden floors, tangerine Smeg fridges and Marshall speakers. 
Sophie’s, the rooftop restaurant with adjoining bar, has views over the south 
side of the city, and the decor is beautiful. The hotel is right in the heart 
of the south side’s nightclub core, an area that’s lively almost every night of 
the week. For some, this is a godsend; for others, not so much.
