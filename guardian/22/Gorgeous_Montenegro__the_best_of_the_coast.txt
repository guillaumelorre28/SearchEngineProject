With its new, multi-million pound marina – Porto Montenegro in Tivat – and a 
host of five-star hotel openings, Montenegro has become a magnet for wealthy 
Russian holidaymakers and Europe’s yachting fraternity. But beyond this 
affluent scene, the coast remains quirky and friendly, with pantiled villages 
clinging to the steep shoreline, uncrowded beaches and smokykonoba restaurants 
where you can spend the afternoon with a €5 bottle ofvranac.

And with easyJet flights from Gatwick to Tivat starting 16 June (flights from 
Manchester launched earlier this year), it’s easy to visit the Montenegro 
seaside and avoid the bling.

East of Herceg Novi, this long, forested bay is lined with a mix of old Greek 
and Turkish settlements, and small, concrete hotels that time forgot. The 
eight-room Palace Hotel in Zelinka (doubles from €42, +382 31 678 102) has more 
character than most, and there’s a pebbly beach just 50 metres away. In 
Baosici, a good place to visit is the house of Pierre Loti (the French sailor 
whose memoirs inspired Madama Butterfly). He lived for a while on the shore 
here, and wrote another romantic short story. The house is a ruin but has 
tranquil views.Aurora Hotel <http://aurorahotel.me/> on the quayside in Herceg 
Novi is owned by Serbian film director Emir Kusturica, and is full of his 
wife’s art work (doubles from €61 B&B). There’s a lively cafe-bar and small 
cinema downstairs. For food, Konoba Feral (Vasa Ćukovića 4), below the castle 
in Herceg Novi, has some good Montenegrin wines from theSavina Monastery 
<http://castelsavina.me/> and serves excellent (and affordable) grilled 
calamari, black risotto and swordfish.Restoran Olimpija 
<https://www.facebook.com/Restoran-Olimpija-390173031052277/> in Kumbor is a 
lovely family affair. Diners can hear mama in the kitchen while her sons are 
out front, and the local seafood and fish soup (€5) are excellent.

This showpiece of Venetian Montenegro, with its mountainous city walls and 
pantiled roofs, is in danger of being swamped by tour groups but for the moment 
the shopkeepers are still keen to chat.Hotel Marija 
<http://hotelmarija.me/en////> (doubles from €120) was opened in 1995 by Voljin 
Radanovic. These days his 17-bedroom mansion feels a touch over-modernised and 
the street outside can get noisy, but it is right in the centre. Cats are the 
unofficial symbol of Kotor and feline fans can check out theCat Museum 
<http://catsmuseum.org/index.php?lang=en> and the Cats of Kotor Shop 
<http://www.catsofkotor.com/?set_lang=3>, both full of locally made 
moggyphernalia. When it comes to food, avoid the tourist traps and head to
Bastion <http://restoranbastion.com/>, a decent old restaurant that does 
good-value fish dishes in the quieter North Gate end of the city.

Budva was President Tito’s Benidorm, a long arc of beach framed by 1960s 
high-rise hotels. It’s creeping upmarket these days, but the old Venetian city 
at the end of the beach (restored after an earthquake in 1979) has some quiet 
streets and cafe-strewn piazzas. TheHotel Astoria 
<http://astoriamontenegro.com/astoria-budva/> (doubles from €110) is a modern 
boutique hotel built into the old sea wall, with an attractive roof terrace. 
The best sights include the citadel and the four churches (two Orthodox and two 
Catholic) that stand shoulder to shoulder in the square below. Mogren beach is 
one of Montenegro’s best – it’s only 1km from the old town, down a narrow path 
that keeps the crowds away. For somewhere different to eat and drink theBudva 
Beer & Bike Club <http://beerbikeclub.com/> hosts local rock bands.

Four kilometres inland from the new port of Bar stands Stari Bar, a ruined 
Byzantine fortress-city that was conquered first by the Venetians and then the 
Ottomans, then abandoned after an explosion at the beginning of the 20th 
century. Locals refer to it as “our Pompeii”. Once you’ve wandered the steep 
streets of the old city and visited its 17th-century Turkish hammam, seek out 
one of the world’s oldest olive trees: it’s called Stara Maslina, it’s said to 
be over 2,000 years old, and it grows just below the city.Kaldrma 
<https://www.facebook.com/Restoran-Kaldrma-203376259700835/?fref=nf> is a 
justifiably popular restaurant. It’s scruffy, with an outside seating area of 
unstable furniture and tatty cushions, but the owner serves gorgeousjaprak 
(stuffed vine leaves made to his mother’s own recipe). There are no hotels in 
Stari Bar itself, butThe Princess 
<http://www.hotelprincess.me/Hotel-Princess-Montenegro/1/Home.shtml> (doubles 
from €86), down by the archaeological museum in New Bar, is comfortable. Ask 
for a room with a sea-view balcony and you’ll soon forget the slightly 
corporate ambience.

This pretty, 90% Albanian city in Montenegro has a delightful old town centre, 
full of fountains. Check out Bregut mosque and the adjacent food market, with 
its distinctly Ottoman flavour. On a rocky outcrop of Ulcinj’s old town stands 
the nine-room Hotel Kalaja (doubles from €30, + 382 85 421 435), owned by the 
Bushati family. It has great sea views and is only 200 metres from Malla Plaza 
(a small beach). For food, Bazar (Hafiz Ali Ulqinaku, + 382 30 421 639) is a 
balconeyed restaurant overlooking the city’s main drag, and run by three 
brothers, who catch the fish every morning – the sea bass is excellent. Wine 
lovers should take a taxi up toVinarija Milović 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Vinarija-Milovi%C4%87-Briska-Gora/954165801357205>
, in the hills north-east of the old city, which is Montenegro’s southernmost 
wine producer – fill your suitcase with its Vranac Status Barrique.
