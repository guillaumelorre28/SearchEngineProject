Stephen Marks is refusing to sit down with an activist investor that wants him 
to surrender his dual role as chairman and chief executive of the struggling 
fashion chain French Connection.

The retailer will update the City on first-half trading on Tuesday and 
Gatemore Capital Management, the US hedge fund that has built an 8% stake, is 
seeking a meeting with the full board to discuss ideas to improve its financial 
performance thatwere set out in a letter 
<http://www.gatemore.com/sites/default/files/gatemore-letter-to-french-connection.pdf>
 to the company in July.

Liad Meidar, a Gatemore managing partner, said it wanted the audience to 
discuss a turnaround plan under which the long-serving non-executive directors 
Dean Murray and Claire Kent would be replaced.

The pair have been on the board since 2008 so will soon lose their status as 
“independent” under the UK corporate governance code. Gatemore also wants the 
retailer to accelerate plans to shut unprofitable stores and to “move on” from 
using its well-known FCUK label.

“He [Marks] is not really willing to have an open conversation about why 
French Connection is underperforming,” said Meidar, who added that a wider 
shareholder base was unifying around its ideas. “You have a 41% shareholder who 
is running this business at his leisure, not for for the benefit of all 
shareholders.”

French Connection confirmed that Marks, who founded the business in 1972, 
would not be meeting any shareholders as part of the interim results roadshow, 
with briefings to be handled by other members of its executive team, which 
includes the new finance director, Lee Williams, who joined from its online 
rivalAsos

.

French Connection, which also owns the brands Toast and Great Plains, made a 
£3.5m loss in 2015. The shares are changing hands for 40.75p, giving the 
retailer a market capitalisation of £40m.

Marks has mapped out a plan for a return to the brand’s previous glories that 
involves shutting unprofitable stores and improving its ranges. The company has 
also enlisted the highly regarded fashion executive Christos Angelides, who has 
worked with Next and Abercrombie & Fitch, as an independent non-executive 
director.At its full-year results in March 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/french-connection-annual-loss-shares-slump>
, Marks insisted the business was moving in the right direction.

Its recent collections have been well received by the fashion press, but any 
progress is against a backdrop of tough trading, withNext and John Lewis

 both reporting a fall in first-half profits last week.
