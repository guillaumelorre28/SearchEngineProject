A computer game based on the recent fatal stabbing of eight children in a 
Japanese school has been removed from a web site, a spokesman for Yahoo said 
today.

An unidentified person had put the game, titled Killing Children at Ikeda 
Elementary School, on the Yahoo portal site following the June 11 school 
attack, said officials from YahooJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan>
 Corp.

Tokyo police asked Yahoo to remove the game, which they deemed offensive to 
parents of the eight victims as well as others at the school, the officials 
said.

Seven girls and one boy, aged from six to eight, were killed, and 13 children 
and two teachers injured, in the attack by a knife-wielding man last week at 
the Ikeda Elementary School in the suburbs of Osaka, 250 miles west of Tokyo. 
The 37-year-old suspect, Mamoru Takuma, is a former school janitor with a 
history of mental illness.

The goal of the game was to "kill as many children as possible", said a police 
spokesman. The creator of the game "voluntarily" removed it, he added.

It had appeared on a portal site where users can post their own games or home 
pages for free. The spokesman stressed that Yahoo had not been directly 
involved.

The attack on the school was the worst mass-killing in Japan since 1995, when 
a doomsday cult released sarin gas on Tokyo subways, killing 12 people and 
leaving thousands more ill.
