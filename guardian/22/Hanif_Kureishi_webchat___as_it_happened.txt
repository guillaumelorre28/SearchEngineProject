Thanks to Hanif, and indeed to all of you for your questions. Until next time!

"Writing today, particularly writing in English, is in a surprisingly healthy 
state"

HuNaught <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11797439> asks:

What is the state of literature today? The same as when you started out, or 
more competitive? What would your advice be to somebody looking to publish 
their first novel in 2015?

I would say that writing today, particularly writing in English - which is the 
form I'm most aware of - is in a surprisingly healthy state, and that new 
writing from India, Pakistan and the whole subcontinent is very lively at the 
moment. There is also much new writing coming out of Africa. So despite people 
speaking all the time about the death of the novel, and indeed of writing 
altogether, people clearly haven't given up on the idea that the novel - and I 
mean in particular the novel - is a central form for expressing both the social 
and psychological depths of human life.

One of the things I've noticed particularly with regard to my own teenage 
children is that there has occured a break between the culture of the past and 
the present. My children were mostly brought up in the 90s and 00s which meant 
their progenitors were really Sony and Apple. They were brought up more or less 
entirely on what I refer to as "electronics". What this means is that the 
transmission of humanism or humanistic tradition as I would think of it, is in 
danger of being lost. Without sentimentalising the past I'd like to say that 
the books my grandfather read he handed onto my father, and it was in my 
father's library that I educated myself. And that it would be a tragedy if this 
form of cultural transmission, that this history of values, was eroded by 
children who are receiving their education from the electronic media, rather 
than from other educated adults. I grew up in the 60s, at a time when authority 
was under attack, but it would seem to me now to be a tragedy for us to regard 
all authority as perverse or fascistic. It would be a further tragedy if our 
children saw themselves only as consumers. It is fascinating that some young 
people are choosing to go to Syria and join Isis. You'd have to say that this 
was misplaced idealism. It would be terrible to think, that on the other side, 
our children were merely consumers and had given up on idealism and politics 
altogether. Although we are condemned to five more years of Tory rule it 
doesn't follow that we should be disillusioned or give up on thinking about 
alternatives to this form of aggressive, elitist, and ultimately empty 
hyper-capitalism which will devastate the post-war values, particularly of the 
welfare state, that I, in my sentimental way, still hold dear.

I think what interests me at the moment in terms of race, and in terms of the 
future of Britain, is that we have probably reached the end of so-called 
identity politics. What I'm interested in now is a broader, socialistic 
alliance. So whether you are a lesbian, person of colour, or identify with any 
minority, I would like to see us forming a new politics that is concerned with 
what I would call public values. Thatcher destroyed public values; indeed, 
didn't appear to believe in them. So now, a generation later, we are left 
without public housing, decent pensions, effective trade unions, or a political 
party that can represent anything except the elite. So after the collapse of 
Marxist communism, and the instatement of neo-liberalism from Thatcher through 
her disciple Blair and onto Cameron, we are it seems to me now living more or 
less in a one-party state. We lack an effective and ideological opposition. The 
collapse of the left at the last election presents a great opportunity for us 
to think about possibilities of reframing politics and creating alternatives to 
the neo-liberal horror that awaits us.

Most people can sing, or dance, or cook a bit, and have all sorts of 
accomplishments they they are not necessarily outstanding at. It's irrelevant 
really. Most people are not geniuses at everything that they do. Also I think 
with writing, and particularly with the students, the most important thing is 
that they write because they have something to say to themselves at first. 
Whether you have something of interest to say to a reader is another kind of 
test. And one that can only be resolved if someone is prepared to hand over 
some money in exchange for something you have written.

"I often wish that I'd started a franchise like JK Rowling"

listlessbedouin <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2485239> asks:

If you had to write a sequel to one of your stories, which would it be? What 
would happen in it?

It's a good question. Because when you write a story, a novel, or a movie, you 
really inhabit the characters and they really inhabit you. For a long time 
they're a part of your life. They are bits of you, and they seem to have some 
sort of independent existence. So when you're done with them you do worry about 
what happens to them. I often wish that I'd started a franchise like JK 
Rowling, by which I mean a form in which you could keep the same characters 
going forever. I would be a richer man than I am now. So although I still 
wonder what might have happened to Karim Amir, or Charlie Hero, or DeeDee 
Osgood, what excites me are the new characters that I'm making, that still 
appear to me as I sit at my desk and starting talking in my ear. So when I 
finish something I feel a terrible vacancy, and I wait for myself to be 
inhabited by these new ghosts who soon, if I'm lucky, start speaking to me and 
to one another. I can't say I know how this kind of magic happens; I guess you 
have to turn up your hearing aid, and if you're lucky, you'll pick up 
something. Perhaps for a writer it becomes a kind of habit and you don't even 
have to look for stories any more; they find you.

I couldn’t put The Black Album 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/black-album.html> down, great read. Deedee 
sounded so hot.

I’ve heard you remark about identity issues facing third and fourth generation 
Pakistani kids and how for many this manifests itself in the religion of their 
parents. Like you, I come from a mixed heritage and it’s not something I 
struggle with. It’s not a big deal, I just embrace whatever bits of culture I 
like, and not even limited to those of my parents’ backgrounds.

Why is it that so many young people from South Asian backgrounds struggle to 
feel at home here and what can we do about it?

I noticed as a young man growing up, and I grew up in the 1950s and early 60s 
when Britain was much whiter than it is now, that other people had a problem 
with people of colour. And for some time, this did as they say, my head in. 
After a while I realised that this was a political and social issue, rather 
than something that concerned my psychological health. I saw that Britain had 
to change. There was an idea that whiteness was the standard, that whiteness 
was the bar, as it were. Just as at that time heterosexuality was considered to 
be the sexual standard. Things would only improve for all of us if these 
categories were questioned, dismissed, and we could begin to see things 
differently. As I say, this is a political, social and cultural issue. It's 
terrible when people become locked into identities that are too narrow for 
them, when they see themselves exclusively as, say, straight, Muslim, white, or 
whatever it is. You might say we need a more creative view of human 
possibility. The arts might be one way of advancing this.

There are some conflicts, some forms of antagonism, that are really worth 
engaging in. The opposite of conflict would be a terrible conformity or 
quiescence. It would be a form of death to remain silent. So you must say 
you'll say, and then you'll find out how others think about what it is you've 
said. Silence is worse. The truth is, you don't really know how others are 
going to receive your works, but if you remain silent, they'll never find out. 
It would be ridiculous to think you could live in a world without conflict; 
there's a lot of truth in conflict. I would recommend engaging in good 
conflict: where you might feel the need to speak the truth. When you're 
writing, the one thing you must do is say it how it feels to you. So if writing 
is of value to anyone, whether they're a real writer or not - they might be a 
weekend writer - they're at least speaking truthfully to themselves.

I worked with David Bowie, on the soundtrack to the TV series of The Buddha of 
Suburbia. When I asked him if he would like to do it, he was pleased and said: 
I thought you'd never ask. The album he made also called The Buddha of Suburbia 
is a terrific record, and a development of the short sequences of music he did 
for the TV series. He's a wonderful man, but of course rather intimidating to 
work with. You don't really want to be in the position of having to tell David 
Bowie what sort of music you think he should be making. It was interesting to 
me how thorough and committed and hardworking he was, and that was a good 
lesson.

I read philosophy at university and around that time in the mid 70s, became 
interested in the work of Freud, Lapin, Foucault, Deleuze etc. French 
intellectual life in the post-war period was very exciting, compared to what 
was going on in the UK. So for me philosophy and psychoanalysis crossed over 
and their concerns were very similar. So through philosophy and psychoanalysis, 
I could think about race, sexuality, contemporary politics, families, madness, 
and so on. I can't say how all this informs my work, but I would have to say 
that anything you listen to, think about, read, the conversations you have 
would inevitably inform your work. Mostly at the beginning of my career I was 
interested in writing about race because I came from a mixed-race background, 
and saw that although Britain was changing from the post-war period, very few 
writers and artists felt they were in a position to write about it. I remember 
reading ER Braithwaite's To Sir With Love, which concerns a black man going to 
teach in a white school in the East End, and thinking: I want to write about 
this subject. The end of the empire, and the beginning of a new form of 
colonialism within Britain. When I finally got around to writing The Buddha of 
Suburbia and I found a voice and tone and style for it, it was the book I'd 
been trying to write since I was 14 or 15 years old. The book that would be 
about race, fashion, drugs, music, sexual experimentation and punk, ie much of 
what I'd lived through. But you can't just write down what happened to you 
yesterday; you have to find an approach or point of view that enables you to 
write freely. And it's that that takes the time. But when you find that - when 
I found that I should write it in the first person rather than the third - it 
should then come relatively easily.

It would be a mistake to think that writing is therapy for the writer; that 
really is for bad writers. The therapy involved in writing is for the reader, 
that you are making or are part of a culture. The point of a culture is to 
provide a resource where people can think more widely about what matters to 
them. This is I guess why having a living culture, that's informed by new 
voices, is so crucial.

Being a good father is obviously the most important responsibility you can 
have, but I'm partly an artist in order to be a father. We writers are 50% 
artist and 50% in commerce. We try and make a living from what we do. One of 
the things I'm most proud of having achieved is of making a living as a writer 
since I was in my mid-20s. Looking back it seems more and more amazing to me 
that someone from my background is able to make a living as a professional 
writer. I can now see how difficult and how increasingly difficult that is. I 
would also like my kids to see what it is to have a vocation, what it is to 
have work that you love to do. And that would be at least one lesson I would 
like to pass onto the kids. When I get up in the morning after my coffee the 
first thing I want to do is write - I still have that passion. And I think that 
without that sort of engagement the life could feel empty.

I've never had any death threats. Apart from close friends. But if you want to 
be a writer, as soon as you pick up your pen, your mind fills with fears and 
anxieties. The real danger of censorship is of self-censorship and if you want 
to write you really have to hold off those fears and anxieties. One of the 
things that a creative writing teacher can do is help as student hold off the 
fears that he or she imagines that will follow the transgression of writing.

"There is no sex without meaning"

And here is his first answer. clareyesno 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13950903> asks:

You’ve been very frank in writing about sex – have the British got a 
healthier, more open, less repressed attitude towards sex now than they did in 
the 1980s/1990s? Is it hard to write about? And what do you make of the literary
Bad Sex Award <https://www.theguardian.com/books/badsexaward> – funny and 
worthwhile, or symptomatic of our squeamishness about sex?

They were said to have a repressed attitude in the 50s and 60s, that seemed to 
me to soon disappear. I wouldn't say that I write about sex particularly as an 
act - I think of myself writing about sex as a form of passion. So if you look 
at the film The Mother, or My Beautiful Laundrette or even Le Week-end, you 
would say these are stories about people's involvement with one another, their 
passion for one another., And what happens when that passion ignites, in the 
case of The Mother and Venus, or what happens when it dies, in the case of Le 
Week-end. I would never dissociate sexuality from the person or the character I 
was writing about. There is no sex without meaning.

I would write about not a particular act or position, but I would write about 
what a particular form of desire would mean to somebody and how it might change 
their life. After all, Anna Karenina doesn't just have sex - she does something 
that is deeply transgressive, and the whole of that novel revolves around the 
meaning of what she does.

People can write badly about anything! Landscapes, football... All writing is 
difficult for those who can't do it and reasonably simple for those who can.

I would say that writing today, particularly writing in English - which is the 
form I'm most aware of - is in a surprisingly healthy state, and that new 
writing from India, Pakistan and the whole subcontinent is very lively at the 
moment. There is also much new writing coming out of Africa. So despite people 
speaking all the time about the death of the novel, and indeed of writing 
altogether, people clearly haven't given up on the idea that the novel - and I 
mean in particular the novel - is a central form for expressing both the social 
and psychological depths of human life.

One of the things I've noticed particularly with regard to my own teenage 
children is that there has occured a break between the culture of the past and 
the present. My children were mostly brought up in the 90s and 00s which meant 
their progenitors were really Sony and Apple. They were brought up more or less 
entirely on what I refer to as "electronics". What this means is that the 
transmission of humanism or humanistic tradition as I would think of it, is in 
danger of being lost. Without sentimentalising the past I'd like to say that 
the books my grandfather read he handed onto my father, and it was in my 
father's library that I educated myself. And that it would be a tragedy if this 
form of cultural transmission, that this history of values, was eroded by 
children who are receiving their education from the electronic media, rather 
than from other educated adults. I grew up in the 60s, at a time when authority 
was under attack, but it would seem to me now to be a tragedy for us to regard 
all authority as perverse or fascistic. It would be a further tragedy if our 
children saw themselves only as consumers. It is fascinating that some young 
people are choosing to go to Syria and join Isis. You'd have to say that this 
was misplaced idealism. It would be terrible to think, that on the other side, 
our children were merely consumers and had given up on idealism and politics 
altogether. Although we are condemned to five more years of Tory rule it 
doesn't follow that we should be disillusioned or give up on thinking about 
alternatives to this form of aggressive, elitist, and ultimately empty 
hyper-capitalism which will devastate the post-war values, particularly of the 
welfare state, that I, in my sentimental way, still hold dear.

I think what interests me at the moment in terms of race, and in terms of the 
future of Britain, is that we have probably reached the end of so-called 
identity politics. What I'm interested in now is a broader, socialistic 
alliance. So whether you are a lesbian, person of colour, or identify with any 
minority, I would like to see us forming a new politics that is concerned with 
what I would call public values. Thatcher destroyed public values; indeed, 
didn't appear to believe in them. So now, a generation later, we are left 
without public housing, decent pensions, effective trade unions, or a political 
party that can represent anything except the elite. So after the collapse of 
Marxist communism, and the instatement of neo-liberalism from Thatcher through 
her disciple Blair and onto Cameron, we are it seems to me now living more or 
less in a one-party state. We lack an effective and ideological opposition. The 
collapse of the left at the last election presents a great opportunity for us 
to think about possibilities of reframing politics and creating alternatives to 
the neo-liberal horror that awaits us.

Most people can sing, or dance, or cook a bit, and have all sorts of 
accomplishments they they are not necessarily outstanding at. It's irrelevant 
really. Most people are not geniuses at everything that they do. Also I think 
with writing, and particularly with the students, the most important thing is 
that they write because they have something to say to themselves at first. 
Whether you have something of interest to say to a reader is another kind of 
test. And one that can only be resolved if someone is prepared to hand over 
some money in exchange for something you have written.

It's a good question. Because when you write a story, a novel, or a movie, you 
really inhabit the characters and they really inhabit you. For a long time 
they're a part of your life. They are bits of you, and they seem to have some 
sort of independent existence. So when you're done with them you do worry about 
what happens to them. I often wish that I'd started a franchise like JK 
Rowling, by which I mean a form in which you could keep the same characters 
going forever. I would be a richer man than I am now. So although I still 
wonder what might have happened to Karim Amir, or Charlie Hero, or DeeDee 
Osgood, what excites me are the new characters that I'm making, that still 
appear to me as I sit at my desk and starting talking in my ear. So when I 
finish something I feel a terrible vacancy, and I wait for myself to be 
inhabited by these new ghosts who soon, if I'm lucky, start speaking to me and 
to one another. I can't say I know how this kind of magic happens; I guess you 
have to turn up your hearing aid, and if you're lucky, you'll pick up 
something. Perhaps for a writer it becomes a kind of habit and you don't even 
have to look for stories any more; they find you.

I’ve heard you remark about identity issues facing third and fourth generation

parents. Like you, I come from a mixed heritage and it’s not something I

I noticed as a young man growing up, and I grew up in the 1950s and early 60s 
when Britain was much whiter than it is now, that other people had a problem 
with people of colour. And for some time, this did as they say, my head in. 
After a while I realised that this was a political and social issue, rather 
than something that concerned my psychological health. I saw that Britain had 
to change. There was an idea that whiteness was the standard, that whiteness 
was the bar, as it were. Just as at that time heterosexuality was considered to 
be the sexual standard. Things would only improve for all of us if these 
categories were questioned, dismissed, and we could begin to see things 
differently. As I say, this is a political, social and cultural issue. It's 
terrible when people become locked into identities that are too narrow for 
them, when they see themselves exclusively as, say, straight, Muslim, white, or 
whatever it is. You might say we need a more creative view of human 
possibility. The arts might be one way of advancing this.

of its seemingly autobiographical content. Was it worth it? Do you ever wish 
you’d done something completely different? If that’s too personal feel free to 
completely ignore my question.

PS: Did you ever get to meet David Bowie

There are some conflicts, some forms of antagonism, that are really worth 
engaging in. The opposite of conflict would be a terrible conformity or 
quiescence. It would be a form of death to remain silent. So you must say 
you'll say, and then you'll find out how others think about what it is you've 
said. Silence is worse. The truth is, you don't really know how others are 
going to receive your works, but if you remain silent, they'll never find out. 
It would be ridiculous to think you could live in a world without conflict; 
there's a lot of truth in conflict. I would recommend engaging in good 
conflict: where you might feel the need to speak the truth. When you're 
writing, the one thing you must do is say it how it feels to you. So if writing 
is of value to anyone, whether they're a real writer or not - they might be a 
weekend writer - they're at least speaking truthfully to themselves.

I worked with David Bowie, on the soundtrack to the TV series of The Buddha of 
Suburbia. When I asked him if he would like to do it, he was pleased and said: 
I thought you'd never ask. The album he made also called The Buddha of Suburbia 
is a terrific record, and a development of the short sequences of music he did 
for the TV series. He's a wonderful man, but of course rather intimidating to 
work with. You don't really want to be in the position of having to tell David 
Bowie what sort of music you think he should be making. It was interesting to 
me how thorough and committed and hardworking he was, and that was a good 
lesson.

Personal question really but I’m very intrigued by the interest your fiction 
takes in psychotherapy. Could you maybe say a little about your own intrigue 
with the comparability of writing and what happens in the therapist’s room.

I read philosophy at university and around that time in the mid 70s, became 
interested in the work of Freud, Lapin, Foucault, Deleuze etc. French 
intellectual life in the post-war period was very exciting, compared to what 
was going on in the UK. So for me philosophy and psychoanalysis crossed over 
and their concerns were very similar. So through philosophy and psychoanalysis, 
I could think about race, sexuality, contemporary politics, families, madness, 
and so on. I can't say how all this informs my work, but I would have to say 
that anything you listen to, think about, read, the conversations you have 
would inevitably inform your work. Mostly at the beginning of my career I was 
interested in writing about race because I came from a mixed-race background, 
and saw that although Britain was changing from the post-war period, very few 
writers and artists felt they were in a position to write about it. I remember 
reading ER Braithwaite's To Sir With Love, which concerns a black man going to 
teach in a white school in the East End, and thinking: I want to write about 
this subject. The end of the empire, and the beginning of a new form of 
colonialism within Britain. When I finally got around to writing The Buddha of 
Suburbia and I found a voice and tone and style for it, it was the book I'd 
been trying to write since I was 14 or 15 years old. The book that would be 
about race, fashion, drugs, music, sexual experimentation and punk, ie much of 
what I'd lived through. But you can't just write down what happened to you 
yesterday; you have to find an approach or point of view that enables you to 
write freely. And it's that that takes the time. But when you find that - when 
I found that I should write it in the first person rather than the third - it 
should then come relatively easily.

It would be a mistake to think that writing is therapy for the writer; that 
really is for bad writers. The therapy involved in writing is for the reader, 
that you are making or are part of a culture. The point of a culture is to 
provide a resource where people can think more widely about what matters to 
them. This is I guess why having a living culture, that's informed by new 
voices, is so crucial.

What is more important, being a good artist or a good father?

Being a good father is obviously the most important responsibility you can 
have, but I'm partly an artist in order to be a father. We writers are 50% 
artist and 50% in commerce. We try and make a living from what we do. One of 
the things I'm most proud of having achieved is of making a living as a writer 
since I was in my mid-20s. Looking back it seems more and more amazing to me 
that someone from my background is able to make a living as a professional 
writer. I can now see how difficult and how increasingly difficult that is. I 
would also like my kids to see what it is to have a vocation, what it is to 
have work that you love to do. And that would be at least one lesson I would 
like to pass onto the kids. When I get up in the morning after my coffee the 
first thing I want to do is write - I still have that passion. And I think that 
without that sort of engagement the life could feel empty.

I've never had any death threats. Apart from close friends. But if you want to 
be a writer, as soon as you pick up your pen, your mind fills with fears and 
anxieties. The real danger of censorship is of self-censorship and if you want 
to write you really have to hold off those fears and anxieties. One of the 
things that a creative writing teacher can do is help as student hold off the 
fears that he or she imagines that will follow the transgression of writing.

You’ve been very frank in writing about sex – have the British got a 
healthier, more open, less repressed attitude towards sex now than they did in 
the 1980s/1990s? Is it hard to write about? And what do you make of the literary
Bad Sex Award <https://www.theguardian.com/books/badsexaward> – funny and 
worthwhile, or symptomatic of our squeamishness about sex?

They were said to have a repressed attitude in the 50s and 60s, that seemed to 
me to soon disappear. I wouldn't say that I write about sex particularly as an 
act - I think of myself writing about sex as a form of passion. So if you look 
at the film The Mother, or My Beautiful Laundrette or even Le Week-end, you 
would say these are stories about people's involvement with one another, their 
passion for one another., And what happens when that passion ignites, in the 
case of The Mother and Venus, or what happens when it dies, in the case of Le 
Week-end. I would never dissociate sexuality from the person or the character I 
was writing about. There is no sex without meaning.

I would write about not a particular act or position, but I would write about 
what a particular form of desire would mean to somebody and how it might change 
their life. After all, Anna Karenina doesn't just have sex - she does something 
that is deeply transgressive, and the whole of that novel revolves around the 
meaning of what she does.

People can write badly about anything! Landscapes, football... All writing is 
difficult for those who can't do it and reasonably simple for those who can.
