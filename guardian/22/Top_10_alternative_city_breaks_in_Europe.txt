Ghent, Belgium

Why go?
While Bruges can sometimes feel a little like a tourist toy-town, Ghent keeps 
it real. The city still offers picturesque Flemish architecture and historical 
sites -St Bavo Cathedral <http://www.sintbaafskathedraal.be/> is the obvious 
one - but you’ll also find a buzzing contemporary creative scene too, with 
trendy hang outs such as bar and gig venueCafe Video <http://www.cafevideo.be/>
, cycle cafeBidon <http://www.barbidon.be/> and cutting edge restaurants such as
JEF <http://www.j-e-f.be/>. Evenings are far livelier too, with a big student 
population revelling in the city that spawned electro legends Soulwax.
When to go?
During the summer, Ghent hosts a wide range of festivals, including the 10-day 
multi-arts extravaganzaGentse Feesten <http://www.gentsefeesten.be/>. However, 
the city is just as beautiful during the winter, and in November is the 
location of the notoriously bonkersSix-days cycle race 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/15/six-days-of-ghent-races-cycling-belgium>
.
Where to stay?
The Backstay Hostel <http://www.backstayhostels.com/> opened last summer and 
occupies a stunning city centre art deco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/27/bed-breaking-news-ghent-belgium-newspaper-hostel>
 building, which was formerly the home of left-wing newspaper Vooruit. There’s 
a range of pod-style dorms and double rooms, each of which is named after a 
famous newspaper (including the Guardian). The restaurant and communal spaces 
are chic, chilled and light, with wooden floors, vintage furniture and a 
library.
• Dormitory beds from €19 a night B&B, double rooms from €64 B&B.

Why go? 
Lyon is packed with more than enough to compete with Paris for weekends away, 
but without having to exhaust yourself trekking from one arrondissement to the 
other. From May 2015, Eurostar will be running direct trains to Lyon meaning 
you can reach the city from London in less than five hours. It’s renowned for 
its food scene, but recently it’s the regenerated dock area on the banks of the 
Rhône and the Saône that’s got a buzz to it. That’s where you’ll find the 
recently openedMusée de Confluence <http://www.museedesconfluences.fr/> – a 
futuristic-looking science and anthropology museum – as well asLa Sucrière 
<http://www.lasucriere-lyon.com/homepage>, a new arts and music venue in an old 
sugar warehouse, as well as a host of other chic restaurants and art spaces.
When to go?
Being 250 miles further south than Paris, Lyon gets lovely hot weather during 
the summer. But it’s got plenty to offer all year round. In May, it hostsNuits 
Sonores <http://www.nuits-sonores.com/>, a five-day (and night) festival of 
electronic music and art, which sees hundreds of locations across the city 
transformed into creative stages (13-17 May). In September, 2015, the city will 
launch four months of contemporary art with theLyon Biennale 
<http://www.labiennaledelyon.com/>. 

Where to stay?
In true testament to Lyon’s growth as a creative hub, the city has recently 
gained its first designer hostel, Slo Living. Opened in June 2014 in Lyon’s 
city centre, it’s the brainchild of young team consisting of two world 
travellers and an architect. As you would imagine, the hostel, which also hosts 
events, is cool and relaxed and there’s a great private patio for socialising.

 The Spinnerei Galerien complex inhabits one of Leipzig’s old cotton mills. 
Photograph: Alamy 
Why go? 
Where else can you find a vegan kebab shop <http://www.vleischerei.de/>? A 
refuge for disenchanted Berliners, Leipzig has risen from its industrial past 
thanks to a new generation of young creatives looking for a cheap, fun and 
urban place to pitch up in. This May, theSpinnerei Galerien 
<http://spinnereigalerien.de/gallery-tour/> celebrates 10 years since this vast 
former cotton mill was converted into an art studio complex – it’s just one of 
manycontemporary art spaces in the city 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/11/top-10-art-galleries-art-attractions-leipzig-germany>
 that now includes the likes ofKaufhaus Held <http://www.held-leipzig.de/>, a 
department store repurposed into a creative venue in 2013. Meanwhile, the 
nightlife scene spans from hip, cheap pubs and bars to the legendaryDistillery 
<http://www.distillery.de> – one of Germany’s oldest techno clubs. 
When to go? 
As usual, summer is the time for festivals – and winter in Leipzig, as in 
Berlin, can be pretty cold. But even in October there are big events to build a 
trip around, including the Leipzig Jazz Festival and DOK, one of the world’s 
oldest documentary film festivals.
Where to stay? 
Hotel Fregehaus occupies a rich 18th-century building right in the heart of 
Leipzig’s old town. The boutique interior has been updated to be crisp, 
spacious and modern, but still retains hints of the building’s former glamour – 
think contemporary study chairs facing ornate gold-framed mirrors.

 Segovia has a large gothic cathedral and several beautiful churches. 
Photograph: Alamy 
Why go? 
If you’ve been to Barcelona, Madrid and Bilbao and are curious to explore 
another, smaller city in Spain, then Segovia, with its beautiful churches and 
slower pace is a good option for a peaceful mini-break. The huge gothic 
cathedral and Disney-esque castle are two of the city’s main attractions, as is 
the old town itself, a Unesco world heritage site. Thirty minutes’ train ride 
from Madrid, it’s also easy to explore as a day trip as part of a longer 
holiday in the capital.
When to go? 
While the summer can be pretty hot, this is a great city to visit during 
spring and autumn when you’ll find pleasant temperatures, perfect for exploring 
on foot.
Where to stay? 
Located on Plaza Mayor, the Hotel Infanta Isabel has 37 rooms, almost all of 
which feature windows that open out onto the main square and across the 
beautiful spires and rooftops of the city.

 A gallery in Rua de Miguel Bombarda, Porto Portugal. Photograph: Alamy 
Why go?
Portugal’s second city may not have quite the same party vibe as Lisbon, but 
it shares the faded charm and buzzing creative scene. There’s much more to do 
than sip on port. Rua de Miguel Bombarda is the centre of the city’s art 
district, an area where you’ll find well over a dozen contemporary galleries to 
check out, while theSerralves Museum of Contemporary Art 
<http://www.serralves.pt/en/museum/the-museum/> – as well as being a modernist 
masterpiece (by architect Álvaro Siza) – is one of the country’s most important 
museums. And even run down parts of Porto are worth exploring, thanks to clever,
alternative tours <http://theworsttours.weebly.com/> run by a group of young 
architects.
When to go? 
Porto’s traditional summer highlight is the St John’s Feast festival on 23 
June, which involves street parties, fireworks and hitting each other on the 
head with plastic hammers. Those up for some more contemporary fun will want to 
check in for theNOS Primavera Sound Festival 
<http://www.nosprimaverasound.com/?lang=en>, 4-6 June, an offshoot of the 
Barcelona music festival first run in Porto in 2012.
Where to stay? 
The bold and beautiful Tattva Design Hostel is one of the largest in the city. 
The dorms are modern and cool, the private rooms are on a par with boutique 
hotels, and the terrace bar is the perfect place to get warmed up before making 
the short walk to the city’s nightlife district.

 Ars Electronica Center and Postlingberg Church, Linz. Photograph: WestEnd61/Rex
Why go?
Linz combines old town charm with a burgeoning creative scene that might 
surprise one or two who aren’t up to speed with developments. Last December it 
was accepted intoUnesco’s network of Creative Cities 
<http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/creativity/creative-cities-network/>
 – and in 2009 it was a European capital of culture, in each instance helping 
raise the profile of the city as an arts and music destination. The recently 
upgradedArs Electronica Center <http://www.aec.at/center/en/> – a museum for 
the future – is a place to explore the interraction between people and the 
world around them, and encapsulates Linz’s reputation as an experimental, 
forward-looking city.
When to go? 
Two of Linz’s biggest long-running annual events are the Ars Electronica 
festival <http://www.aec.at/festival/en/> in September, a series of 
exhibitions, performances and events focused on arts and science, and
Pflasterspektakel Linz 
<http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.pflasterspektakel.at/&prev=search>
 in July, one of Europe’s biggest street artist festivals – a celebration of 
buskers, human statues, clowns and dancers.
Where to stay? 
Book a room through the Pixel Hotel, a conceptual accommodation project that 
allows visitors to stay in uniquely designed rooms scattered around the city 
“like pixels”.

 Swing low … Showroom Mama is a hub for the modern arts scene in Rotterdam 
Why go? 
Amsterdam may be pretty, but Rotterdam is a design-led Dutch city that’s 
brimming with iconic architecture. TheHet Nieuwe Instituut 
<http://www.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/> of architecture, design and e-culture is 
the obvious place to delve into the subject, whileTent 
<http://www.tentrotterdam.nl/informatie/index.php> and Showroom Mama 
<http://www.showroommama.nl/nl/> are highlights of Rotterdam’s cutting edge 
contemporary arts scene. The nightlife is excellent too;Bird 
<http://www.bird-rotterdam.nl/> is a top live music venue while clubs like 
Perron <http://www.perron.nl> consistently draw top underground DJs to the city.

When to go? 
One of the highlights of Rotterdam’s cultural calender is the North Sea Jazz 
festival <http://www.northseajazz.com/nl/>, which takes place in July and this 
year celebrates its 40th anniversary with a star-studded line up including 
D’Angelo, Tony Bennett duetting with Lady Gaga, Joshua Redman, and Herbie 
Hancock duo with Chick Corea.
Where to stay? 
The award-winning King Kong Hostel opened last March, instantly making an 
impression as one of Rotterdam’s coolest places to the stay. The hip spot is 
located on Witte de Withstraat, surrounded by the city’s best bars and 
restaurants.

Europe. Photograph: Alamy 
Why go? 
Don’t be put off by Turin’s location in Italy’s industrial north; the city is 
more attractive than nearby Milan and has a cafe and food scene that showcases 
the best that Piedmont (and Italy) has to offer. The historic Caffe Torino – 
known as “the living room” is a classic hangout, one of many richly furnished 
art nouveu and art deco cafes and restaurants to be found beneath the shaded 
pedestrian arcades. Newer restaurants worth checking out for an expert take on 
traditional ingredients includeRistorante Consorzio 
<http://ristoranteconsorzio.com/home_en.html>, while cultural attractions range 
from theMuseo Egizio 
<http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=it&u=http://www.museoegizio.it/&prev=search>
 – for one of the biggest collection of Egyptian artefacts in Europe – to the 
convertedLingotto Fiat Factory <http://www.lingottofiere.it/>, which featured 
in the Italian Job.
When to go? 
Spring is the best time to visit, when the weather is most favourable for 
exploring by foot, but there’s always a wide range of events going on. In 
October there’s the Movement music festival – the Italian offshoot of the cult 
Detroit electronic music event and at the end of March England will take on 
Italy in a friendly game at the Juventus stadium.
Where to stay?
For a less conventional place to stay, try one of Turin’s design B&Bs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/mar/30/turin-bed-and-breakfasts-italy>.
Vitamina M <http://www.bedandbreakfasttorino.com/> was the first to open, 
inviting visitors to stay in a chic, minimal house full of funky Italian 
objects (think bright red and shiny), whileTerres d’Aventure Suites

Why go? 
As is often the way with second cities, Gothenburg is less glam than the 
capital, Stockholm, but its more industrial environment provides the perfect 
backdrop for a lively creative scene. A prime example of this isRoda Sten 
<http://www.rodasten.com/> - an old boiler house on the concrete riverside 
that’s now a huge arts and cultural space. The cobbled streets of the 
historically run down Haga neighbourhood is a place to explore indie cafes, 
shops and restaurants. Nearby, on Andra Långgatan, you’ll find hang outs such as
Dirty Records/Cafe Santo Domingo <http://www.cafesantodomingo.se/> – where you 
can combine crate-digging with organic, homemade grub and coffee. When night 
falls there’s countless drinking spots to choose from; Ölhallen 7:an is a 
historic beer hall, whileBar Kino 
<http://www.goteborg.com/en/hagabions-cafe-och-bar-kino/>, next to Hagabions 
Cafe, is a popular alt hang out.

When to go? 
Go in summer and it’ll be be light till around 10pm. In August, Gothenburg 
hosts the three-day rock festival,Way Out West <http://wayoutwest.se/?lang=en>, 
this year including Patti Smith, Beck and Belle & Sebastian, as well as the 
annual culture festival, which provides six days of free entertainment - from 
comedy to film - in the downtown area.
Where to stay? 
The design-led Avalon hotel is a feng-shui certified establishment in the 
centre of the city. It has a wide range of rooms all fitted in a contemporary 
Scandi style as well as a bar and restaurant.

Why go?
Belgrade’s cultural scene has snowballed in the past five years. The 
combination of this with the gritty urbanism of the city sees it frequently 
(perhaps lazily) compared with Berlin - Belgrade is intriguing in its own 
unique way.Savamala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/feb/07/belgrade-savamala-serbia-city-break>
, the neighbourhood on the river below the old town, is the current focal point 
for the city’s creatives. Here you’ll findKC Grad <http://www.gradbeograd.eu/> 
andMikser House 
<http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=sr&u=http://house.mikser.rs/&prev=search>
, two arts and performance spaces as well as lots of bars and restaurants. The 
city’s clubbing scene is vibrant, and feaures legendary floating club20/44 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Klub-2044/218851144794013> and brand new 
“techno cathedral”Drugstore <https://www.facebook.com/drugstore.beograd>, in a 
former slaughterhouse.
When to go? 
Summer is super hot in Belgrade, but it’s also when the string of nightclubs 
on boats on the riverside are in full swing (most of these, apart from 20/44, 
close during winter). The best times to visit, according to locals, is spring 
or autumn, avoiding the particularly dreary spell winter can cast over the 
place.
Where to stay?
If you’ve got the money, Townhouse 27 in the old town has a boutique feel with 
sleek rooms and warm service. But backpackers on a party trip will want to 
check into the Green Studio Hostel where you can bag a bed from as little as €5 
per night and an atmosphere that should keep you up all weekend.
