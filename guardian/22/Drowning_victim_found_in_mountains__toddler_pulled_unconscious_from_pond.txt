drowning victim was recovered in the Snowy Mountains on Monday.

Police divers and Marine Rescue NSW found the 44-year-old’s body in Lake

public.


Emergency workers were called to the house in Fairfield West about 10.30am on

Acting Superintendent Mark Brett said police were investigating the 
circumstances of the girl’s death, including whether the pool fence had been 
left open. He said the toddler had been missing for “a few minutes” before she 
was found.

“Our prayers and thoughts go out to the family of the young child,” he told 
reporters on Monday. “It’s very tragic circumstances at a supposedly joyous 
time of the year.”

Brett begged parents to supervise their youngsters, especially around pools.

“Don’t assume you know where they are; be sure you know where they are,” he 
said.

The drowning victims in NSW since late December include two 23-month-old twins 
who died after they were pulled unconscious from a backyard pool at Kellyville 
Ridge in Sydney’s north-west on 20 December.
