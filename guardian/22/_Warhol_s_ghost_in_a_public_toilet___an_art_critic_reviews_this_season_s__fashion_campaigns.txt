Looking in a fashion magazine these days is like wandering through a very chic 
art gallery full of intensely radical artworks. It is only when you notice the 
£2,000 bag that lies casually across a model’s waxed leg that you realise these 
are ads. On the other hand, posh art galleries with their willowy squadrons of 
couture-clad staff are also easy to mistake for fashion magazines. Does the 
Gagosian now sell shoes? These spring and summer campaign images for leading 
fashion houses reveal that it’s all getting even artier. Provocative settings, 
abstract angles and minimalist bodies are everywhere. But how do the new looks 
being sold to us in 2016 really stack up as art? Are these ads Turner prize 
winners or Turnip prize nonsense? I put down my copy of John Ruskin’s Modern 
Painters to take a look at the latest convolutions in the art of style.

Are they having a laugh? Yes, of course. The Sicilian designers have often led 
the way in artistic advertising campaigns – for instance, praising the male 
nude in images that deliberately recalled the gay Renaissance art of Donatello 
and Michelangelo – but their latest campaign is more like a pastiche of 1950s 
neo-realist cinema. The models are eating spaghetti (which they evidently don’t 
get enough of in real life) in a stagey al fresco restaurant with check 
tablecloths that is clearly meant to look like a film set. It is even lit to 
bring out its filmic fakeness. The outrageous southerners are clearly paying 
tribute to that master of over-the-top Italian-ness and Italy’s greatest modern 
visual artist – the exuberant Federico Fellini. The maestro would surely have 
laughed at this absurd image of thin models pretending to be fattened up.

What? Huh? I don’t get it. This is the kind of image that can make leafing 
through a fashion magazine a bit like visiting a very advanced art biennale. 
You really are not sure what it means. Warhol-like bespectacled poseurs holding 
peacocks in eerie urban underpasses are all very well, but what’s wrong with 
lovely lasses in glamorous locations?Gucci 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> may be trying to escape its 
reputation for being sexy with this distinctly un-erotic campaign – unless, of 
course, meeting Warhol’s ghost in a public toilet is your idea of a good time. 
Very contemporary indeed.

Oh wait, I am starting to catch up. Fashion has gone Corbynista. Chanel has 
sent its models into the mean streets to send out a no-nonsense socialist 
message. Never mind that their clothes cost enough to build new flood defences 
for Cumbria, these women are out to save the city from Blairite scum. Or are 
they? It strikes me now that Chanel is French and those lovely garments are in 
the red, white and blue of the tricoleur. Can it really be that in showing two 
women of different race walking the streets together,Chanel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/chanel> is trying to say something 
coherent about France, terror, Islamophobia, the economic malaise and who knows 
what else? If so, it’s time that Michel Houellebecq followed up his art world 
novel The Map and the Territory with an equally scathing tale about the fashion 
industry.

This is more like it, pictorial traditionalists or men who happen to pick up a 
fashion mag might feel. A model poses on the edge of a luxurious swimming pool 
whose grand and sensual black and white design looks as if it may be in the 
most refined riad in Marrakech. The model is Anna Ewers, and the second woman 
approaching from above is singer and actor Zoë Kravitz. The picture creates a 
teasingly sexy cinematic scenario. It plays ambiguously on the pair’s 
relationship as well as the mystery of where they are. I want to go there, too. 
This is the most conventionally fantasist of these fashion shoots and yet it is 
also the most honest. Fashion is not about social realism or actual global 
problems. It is about desire, escapism and beauty, and this campaign tells it 
like it is.

Everyone is keeping it real this season in the realm of unreality. Urban grit 
has even entered the luxurious world of Louis Vuitton. Harsh light and tough 
poses on the street give this campaign the rather nostalgic look of a 1980s new 
wave pop video or perhaps a scene from Zoolander. But while Zoolander 2 is 
reeling from accusations oftransphobia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/23/zoolander-2-accused-of-transphobia-over-benedict-cumberbatch-character>
, Vuitton is playing on one of the hottest identity issues of our time by 
casting Will Smith’s son Jaden as one of its womenswear models. Let’s Vogue! 
But is Vuitton appropriating trans culture, as has been alleged? Surely it is 
just attempting to make its products reek a little bit less of ultra-rich 1% 
life and a little more of the raw realities of the 21st century. Which somehow 
elude this brittle image.

2016 campaign. Photograph: Balmain 
While some campaigns are drifting off into a futuristic artiness that makes 
Marcel Duchamp look like the 128-year-old man he is, Paris fashion house 
Balmain has assembled a dream team of veteran supermodels and photographed them 
in stark, savage, sexy black and white. These pictures of Cindy Crawford, Naomi 
Campbell and Claudia Schiffer remind you why fashion got a reputation for 
resembling art in the first place. Instead of muffling their maturity with 
Photoshop softening, Steven Klein’s photographs acutely home in on how they 
look now with a harsh and awe-inspiring monochrome aesthetic worthy of the 
great Helmut Newton. Crawford looks as gaunt and dangerous as an Edvard Munch 
Madonna while clutching herself ecstatically – or is it the material she’s 
pleased with? Campbell meanwhile projects sheer power like Pygmalion’s statue 
come to life. These women are works of art.
