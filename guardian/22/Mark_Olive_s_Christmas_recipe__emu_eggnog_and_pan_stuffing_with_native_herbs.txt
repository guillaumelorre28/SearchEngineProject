Cream 150g caster sugar and the egg yolk, slowly adding the sugar while 
whisking. Heat the milk over a water bath, adding creamed egg and sugar slowly 
as it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Chill for an hour in the fridge 
or sit over an ice bath to cool down. Add the vanilla essence. Beat the cream 
until it peaks, and set aside. Whisk the egg whites slowly, incorporating the 
remaining sugar until it peaks. Add the brandy. Fold in the egg whites and the 
whipped cream.

Served chilled or warm in a tall glass with grated nutmeg.

, rinse under cold water and squeeze out excess moisture. Set aside to dry 
while you prepare the rest of the mixture. De-crust the bread and cut into 
small diced pieces and place in a bowl. Add the remaining dry ingredients as 
well as the chopped warrigal greens and mix through the bread. (The greens may 
also be chopped and sprinkled on top at the end to give the stuffing a vibrant 
lift in colour.) Fry off the celery and onions and sage in the butter and stir 
until soft. Stir through bread mixture. Whisk the eggs and then combine through 
the stuffing mixture until moist. Add milk if it feels too dry â€“ it should just 
come together and not be slushy.


Turn out into a baking tray and cook in preheated oven at 160C until firm and 
browned. Check after 20 minutes. Turn out and cut into appropriate slices.
