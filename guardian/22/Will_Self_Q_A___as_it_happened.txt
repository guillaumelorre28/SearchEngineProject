And on that note, that's a wrap!

Will’s off to prepare for his trip to the Edinburgh international books 
festival now, so a big thank you to everyone who asked a question and another 
big thank you to Will for answering them!

Do you believe that publishing your work with corporate entities, in order to 
gain profit from your onanism, devalues its content and so continues the 
desecration of the novel, and that by being part of the celebrity author 
culture you are helping to hasten its demise?

Why do you bother with such an insulting question? Obviously I don't think of 
my writing as 'onanism' - I suggest you retreat quietly to a corner where you 
can pull your plonker (or abrade your clitoris, should you be a female Stevie) 
in peace.

Would you consider starring in the mooted reboot of Columbo? I think you have 
the right sort of wry facial expressions, sharp intelligence and somewhat 
dishevelled appearance to pull off the role quite nicely.

I watched Wings of Desire which has a cameo appearance by Peter Falk only 
yesterday... I'm half a Jewish New Yorker which is a good start, but I find it 
difficult to suspend disbelief in the whole detective genre, because the usual 
plot motivator is that when the detective turns up, someone gets dead.

The obscure words are there for all sorts of reasons - usually humorous ones. 
Orwell had many virtues as a writer, but humour was conspicuously lacking from

I certainly think that now copyright is in decline patronage should come in to 
support artists of all forms - I look to the rich for patronage, and if I see 
anyone I know who has a lot of money I never fail to ask them to cover this or 
that utility bill. I carry the bills with me to make it simpler for them to 
oblige...

Not as such, but on that question I'll allow myself the luxury of doubt... A 
personal afterlife - let alone immortality - would strike me as a cosmic

I watched Wings of Desire which has a cameo appearance by Peter Falk only 
yesterday... I'm half a Jewish New Yorker which is a good start, but I find it 
difficult to suspend disbelief in the whole detective genre, because the usual

I certainly think that now copyright is in decline patronage should come in to 
support artists of all forms - I look to the rich for patronage, and if I see 
anyone I know who has a lot of money I never fail to ask them to cover this or 
that utility bill. I carry the bills with me to make it simpler for them to 
oblige...

Not as such, but on that question I'll allow myself the luxury of doubt... A

solecism on a par with the hereditary monarchy...

South Mimms. I've fond memories of the time when it was the venue for 
large-scale ecstasy deals and the rendezvous for ravers... Excellent Harvester 
as well...

What was your nickname at school? I imagine there’s a lot of scope for micky 
taking or creative nicknames with a surname like Self.

Lurch - for obvious reasons.
