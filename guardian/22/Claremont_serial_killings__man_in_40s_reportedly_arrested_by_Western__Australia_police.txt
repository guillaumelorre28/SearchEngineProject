.

The man’s Kewdale home was searched by detectives who investigate unsolved 
homicides and are heading the investigation. Neighbours told Perth Now the home 
was swarmed by officers at 7.30am, yelling warnings at those inside.

Police cordoned off the home as a crime scene and concentrated on an area in 
the backyard where they set up a forensic tent, Perth Now reported. It is 
believed the man and his daughter had lived in the home for several years.

WA police declined to comment on the report, saying media speculation could 
compromise their investigation.

The deaths of three women over 14 months in 1996 and 1997 sparked one of 
Australia’s longest police investigations.

The first to disappear was Sarah Spiers, an 18-year-old secretary who was last 
seen calling for a taxi outside Club Bay View in Claremont about 2am on 27 
January, 1996. She was gone by the time the taxi arrived at 2.14pm. Her body 
has never been found.

Six months later, on 9 June, Jane Rimmer, 23, disappeared from the same part 
of Claremont. Her body was found in bushland at Wellard, about 45km south of 
Claremont, in August 1996.

The third woman was Ciara Glennon. The 27-year-old lawyer disappeared on 14 
March 1997, and her body was found three weeks later in scrub near Eglinton, in 
Perth’s northern suburbs.
