“I spent my whole life chasing my Olympic dream and that was to become an 
Olympian in 2016,” the 33-year-old said.


“I’m going to be taking my Olympic dream one step further. My goal is to let 
people see, if I can do it, they can do it. The goal is to hunt down that 
Olympic medal at the 2018 Olympics.”

The Polynesian kingdom of Tonga isn’t traditionally known for its prowess at 
winter sports; the snowless, tropical nation is more recognised for producing 
world class players in three forms of rugby – union, league and sevens.

Tonga made its winter Olympics debut at the last edition in Sochi, Russia, 
where the team consisted on one athlete, Bruno Banani, and two officials.

Banani, whose birth name is Fuahea Semi, made headlines in 2012 after it was 
discoveredhe had changed his name to match his sponsors

 – a German underwear firm.

Taufatofua, born in Brisbane, joins a burgeoning group of Tongans who are 
seeking to reach the Games in South Korea through the nation’s winter sports 
development program, the Royal Tonga Ski Federation, set up in 2014.

Last year Makeleta Stephan competed in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, 
becoming the first Tongan woman to do so.
