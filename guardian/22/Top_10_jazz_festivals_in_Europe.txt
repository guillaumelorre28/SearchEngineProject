Alfa Jazz Fest, Lviv, Ukraine

24-27 June
Highlight Pat Metheny Quartet
Lviv is an architectural treasure, close to the Polish border, and many of its 
Habsburg, art nouveau and baroque buildings survived 20th-century wars 
relatively unscathed. This festival, established in 2011, has three stages 
hosting artists from all over Europe, as well as US stars such as Pat Metheny, 
Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves and Branford Marsalis, who are joined by 
Cuban trumpet virtuoso Arturo Sandoval. Among the free highlights away from the 
main Eddie Rosner stage will be UK group Sons of Kemet and master percussionist 
Trilok Gurtu performing in the open air on beautiful Rynok Square.
Accommodation options Among the best-located B&Bs in the city is the 38-room 
Modern Art Hotel <http://modern-arthotel.com/en/hotel.html>, doubles from £28
• Eddie Rosner stage gigs from £12, alfajazzfest.com

 Amp it up … the Roman amphitheatre, venue for many of the festival’s concerts. 
28 June-15 July
Highlight Diana Krall
The French took American jazz to their hearts in the 1920s, adding their own 
flavours in the form ofjazz manouche <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy_jazz>
. In the summer the genre is still part of the street scene in towns and 
villages across the nation. One of the most dramatic settings for outdoor jazz 
is at ancient Vienne, south of Lyon on the Rhône, where a Roman amphitheatre 
hosts the main acts, which this year include Imelda May, Esperanza Spalding, 
Earth Wind and Fire, Chic, Erik Truffaz, a tribute to Django Reinhardt, Diana 
Krall, Lisa Simone and Brad Mehldau. But beyond the amphitheatre are smaller 
venues such as the Garden of Cybele, another Roman relic, offering music 
throughout the day and workshops for aspiring musicians.
Accommodation options Check out vienne-tourisme.com 
<http://en.vienne-tourisme.com/accommodations.html> for B&Bs and hostels. 
Vienne’s proximity to Lyon means stays in the southern part of that city can be 
only 25 minutes away by car or bus – if you find that Vienne itself is booked 
out.
• Tickets for amphitheatre gigs from €36 (under 12s free, €22 12-16s), 
seven-night ticket €180 and three nights from about €80,jazzavienne.com

1-3 July
Highlight Esperanza Spalding
While Rossini’s comic masterpiece Il barbiere di Siviglia is wowing punters at 
Glyndebourne, the audience a mile down the road at Glynde Place will be slaves 
to an altogether different kind of rhythm. In addition to Grace Jones, the 
lineup this year puts several charismatic female jazz/soul vocalists to the 
fore: there is south London’sLianne La Havas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/lianne-la-havas>, Dutch singer Caro Emerald, 
bluesy Melody Gardot, and hitmaker Kelis. The genre-bending compass swings back 
to full-on jazz with guitarist John Scofield (in an all-star trio with pianist 
Brad Mehldau and drummer Mark Giuliani), bass legend Stanley Clarke, and Kamasi 
Washington – a Kendrick Lamar sideman. Oh yes, and a certain Burt Bacharach 
will be segueing his strings of hits too.
Accommodation options In its third year, A Love Supreme offers a Lattitude-ish 
array of camping options including Hobbit Huts, bell tents and podpads (from 
£26.50pp pn in addition to weekend camping price)

1-16 July
Highlight Charles Lloyd New Quartet
The daddy of European jazz festivals – second in size globally only to 
Montreal’s enormous annual jamboree – has, over its 49 years, become a general 
modern music event. It has featured Led Zeppelin, New Order and Eric Clapton in 
its time, but jazz remains at its core with workshops, jazz cruises on Lake 
Geneva, jazz trains, competitions for young musicians, late-night jams, club 
stages, outdoor stages, large auditoriums, heaps of DJs and chilled out bars. 
Muse are the big rock act set for this year (already sold out) but for jazz 
lovers the lineup includes Lisa Simone, Mike Stern, Dweezil Zappa, Al Jarreau, 
Quincy Jones and Biréli Lagrène. Being in Switzerland it scrubs up well and 
there’s a big emphasis on sustainability with a vast cleanliness and recycling 
effort.
Accommodation options It’s a bit of a squeeze with up to 200,000 visitors 
tagged on to the 28,000 residents, although the town has a large hotel 
capacity. A good camping option isLes Horizons Blues 
<http://www.camping-club-vaudois.ch/camping-caravaning-les-horizons-bleus-villeneuve.html>
 at the lake’s edge, a couple of miles from the centre of town (two man tent

8-17 July
Highlight Branford Marsalis/Kurt Elling
Eclectic contemporary sounds will waft through gorgeous Perugia’s piazzas, 
cobbled alleys and arched stairways this summer, as they have most years since 
1973, leaving jazz lovers giddy. There’s music around every medieval corner but 
on the main stage at the outdoor Arean Santa Giuliana this year are guitarist 
John Scofield, veteran bluesman Buddy Guy, bassist Marcus Miller and 
vocalist/pianist Diana Krall. Also appearing is Chick Corea and organist Cory 
Henry and his Apostles band. They will be joined by two acts who aren’t 
strictly speaking jazz: George Clinton’s Funkadelic (remember thejoyous set at 
last year’s Glastonbury? 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e84mxj/acts/afzv9r#p02w7l2v>) and Mika, the singer 
of hit single Grace Kelly, who’s a judge on the Italian X-Factor.
Accommodation options If booking late, one possibility just outside Perugia 
and offering B&B and camping is the rusticPerugia Farmhouse 
<http://www.perugia-farmhouse.it/> (doubles from €58, camping from €16pp) – 
which has a pool.

8-10 July
Highlight Cécile McLorin Salvant
Every summer since 1976 (when Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie 
headlined) British jazz fans have streamed over to the Netherlands to help make 
up the 60,000-70,000-strong audience at this big-time yet intimate festival 
spread over 13 stages on four floors within the giant Ahoy complex. This year’s 
programme features many performers appearing at the other festivals on this 
list, with Earth Wind and Fire’s pyrotechnic funk to the fore once again. 
Simply Red and Level 42 add to the veteran groove/pop quotient but jazz purists 
will be mollified by legendary sax players Pharoah Sanders and Charles Lloyd, 
scorching drummer Antonio Sanchez (who composed and performed the score for the 
movie Birdman), the uniqueLebanese trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYDOIzmAQxQ&nohtml5=False> and wonderful young 
singer Cécile McLorin Salvant.
Accommodation options Plentiful and varied in the Hague/Rotterdam urban area 
but if travelling on a tight budgetHostel De Mafkees 
<http://hosteldemafkees.nl/> is offering beds in dorms for €12.50 B&B (bring 
your own sleeping bag or rent duvet €5), even on the Saturday night of the 
festival. It’s about 25 minutes, door-to-door by tube train to Ahoy.

12-16 July
Highlight Joshua Redman Quartet
This Basque city enjoys something of a love-in with the jazz world: in 2006 a 
life-size statue of trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who had written a suite 
dedicated to the city, was put up in Parque de la Florida, one of Vitoria’s 
many attractive green spaces. This year, guitarist Pat Metheny headlines with 
former Miles Davis bassist Ron Carter (€40), two true legends playing live in a 
duo. But the impressive lineup also features the Joshua Redman Quartet, 
splitting the bill with Tom Harrell (€30 = bargain), and what promises to be 
another truly memorable duo from Kenny Barron and Dave Holland. There’s also 
jazz on the street twice a day and midnight sessions at the Hotel Canciller 
Ayala. Vitoria-Gasteiz itself is sometimes overlooked in favour of nearby 
Bilbao, Pamplona and San Sebastian, but it’s a lively town with a large student 
population, a medieval quarter, a significant modern art gallery (theArtium 
<http://www.artium.org/en/>), and many great pintxo bars.

29 July-15 August
Highlight Snarky Puppy
Local mayor Jean-Louis Guilhaumon’s 1970s idea for a world-class jazz festival 
that could reap cultural, tourist and educational dividends for this quiet 
rugby-obsessed district of south-west France has surely exceeded the wildest 
dreams of even this most visionary of municipal officials. Guilhaumon doubles 
as festival president and has this year booked youthful US collectiveSnarky 
Puppy <http://snarkypuppy.com/> as headliners at the 39th edition of this 
spectacular gathering. Dianne Reeves, John McLaughlin, Maceo Parker, Ahmad 
Jamal and Wynton Marsalis also feature … names that resonate in jazz history 
and each will grace the 6,000-seat marquee set up on the town’s rugby pitch.
Accommodation options Stays in and around the village get snapped up early 
during the jazz fortnight (often by the musicians themselves) as the town’s 
population increases from 1,650 to somewhere around 20,000 each night. 
Therefore, late bookers will have to commute from nearby villages. Explore the 
options in the area atmarciactourisme.com <http://www.marciactourisme.com/>. If 
canvas is your thing tryCamping du Lac 
<http://www.camping-marciac.com/accueil-fr/tarifs-et-reservations/>, run by a 
welcoming English couple, where you can pitch tents from €19 (€22 with car). 
The campsite is extended during the festival.

Highlight Cyrus Chestnut Trio
Next to some of the west European biggies, Nišville offers great value for 
money, if not quite the aesthetic glories of, say, Perugia or Vienne. Not that 
Niš, Serbia’s third largest city, lacks appeal: the gigs are mostly staged 
within the Fortress, a vast green space enclosed by Ottoman walls and gates. 
Among some striking names to be enjoyed from only €12 a shot, are soul diva 
Joss Stone, hip hop-and-beyond saxophonist Soweto Kinch, flash fusion/flamenco 
guitar king Al Di Meola, US jazz aristocrats Cyrus Chestnut Trio featuring 
Buster Williams and Lenny White, and former Miles Davis saxman Bill Evans. As 
well as the international stars, the exciting, unpredictable rhythms of 
Balkan-infused jazz will carry across the avenues and squares of the city from 
free stages, workshops and impromptu street sessions.
Accommodation options Try centrally located and unfussily furnished Hotel Lotos
 <http://hotellotos.rs/en/> (doubles from €29 B&B) and if you are on a really

28-31 October
Highlight Randy Brecker/Alphonse Mouzon
Ireland’s biggest jazz festival is somewhat off-circuit (not being held in the 
summer), so often puts together great musicians outside their touring schedule. 
This year, for example, will see top New York trumpeter Randy Brecker, 
guitarist Larry Coryell and former Miles Davis and Stevie Wonder drummer 
Alphonse Mouzon playing together at the Everyman Theatre. The festival was 
started in 1978 by Jim Mountjoy, the Metropole hotel’s marketing manager, in a 
bid to boost visitor numbers, and it has worked triumphantly: Cork Jazz is now 
a lure for around 40,000 music lovers drawn, in previous years, by names such 
as Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson and Dizzy Gillespie. Up to 60 venues stage 
jazz at this friendly festival, ranging from street corners, to small bars, 
galleries and theatres – most of it free.
Accommodation options Rooms are bound to be under pressure in the small city; 
one B&B worth booking early isGarnish House <http://www.garnish.ie/> (doubles 
from €150), which supplies a breakfast lavish enough to keep jazzers on top of 
the beat all day.
