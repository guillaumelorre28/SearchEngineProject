The number of female directors working in Hollywood has fallen, according to a 
new study.

In 2016, just 7% of the top 250 films were directed by women, a fall of 2% 
from the year before. The annual report from theCenter for the Study of Women 
in Television and Film <http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/> found that the number 
was also behind the figure achieved in 1998.

“I would say I’m dumbfounded,” Martha Lauzen, executive director of the 
center, toldVariety 
<http://variety.com/2017/film/news/female-directors-hollywood-diversity-1201958694/>
. “It is remarkable that with all of the attention and talk over the last 
couple of years in the business and the film industry, the numbers actually 
declined. Clearly the current remedies aren’t working.”

The study also found that 35% of films employed no women in key roles behind 
the camera, such as writer, producer, executive producer, editor or 
cinematographer. Women also accounted for just 3% of composers. Documentaries 
and dramas were more likely to employ women while action films and horrors were 
almost exclusively male. Films with female directors at the helm employed a 
greater percentage of women in other positions.

Films released in 2016 from female directors included Jodie Foster’s Money 
Monster, Sharon Maguire’s Bridget Jones’s Baby, Mira Nair’s Queen of Katwe and 
Andrea Arnold’s American Honey. The year before saw two big hits from female 
directors: Sam Taylor Johnson’s Fifty Shades of Grey and Elizabeth Banks’s 
Pitch Perfect 2.

The next 12 months promise to be a better year for women behind the camera 
with new films from Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman), Niki Caro (The Zookeeper’s 
Wife), Sofia Coppola (The Beguiled) and Lucia Aniello (Rock That Body).
