Our late father, Harry Weil, owed his life to Clare Hollingworth (Obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/10/clare-hollingworth-obituary>, 11 
January), who was in charge of the British Committee for Refugees in 
Czechoslovakia. In 1939, having already escaped from the Nazis, he made his way 
to Katowice. Our father wrote: “One afternoon I was arrested and locked up with 
about 100 others in a school building. I knew what was waiting for me. I 
scribbled a note on a piece of paper, addressed it to Clare Hollingworth at the 
local consulate and asked to be allowed to go to the toilet. As there was only 
one ‘gendarme’ in charge of the school room he called the school caretaker to 
escort me. I managed to give him my note, pointed to the address and ‘swallowed 
hard’. It worked thanks to this good man! After the longest 45 minutes I have 
ever lived through two names were called and told they were free to leave. One 
was mine.”

He eventually arrived at Tilbury, via Gdynia and Gothenburg, with two pence in 
his pocket, all that was left of the 10 shillings given to him by Clare 
Hollingworth, and just enough to make his first phone call.
