Was it the proximity to Halloween? The skies turning from furnace-hot sunsets 
to totes emosh Bronte dark? Who knows, butLondon fashion week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-fashion-week> had traded in florals 
and stateliness for horror-movie dread and creaking-floorboard queasiness. Here 
are the unexpected influences from LFW ...

With the PA playing A Whole New World from Aladdin, the chairs decked with 
packets of Turkish Delight and tinsel chandeliers decking the venue, Ryan LO’s 
show was carved up like a three-year-old’s birthday party. The clothes: 
oversize bejewelled pirate hats, dresses in chocolate-box golds, pink and 
orange tiered like a showstopper from Bake Off, silk boiler suits decorated 
with genie lamps spoke to the idea of kids hitting the dressing-up box hard. 
While certain outfits, such as the white, tiered doily-like dress worn by a 
Bambi-ish model with zealishly applied blue eyeshadow and exaggerated, Joan 
Crawford-ish eyebrows suggested something more specific and creepy: the child 
beauty pageant show Toddlers and Tiaras.

The set for Ashley Williams was a tone poem to analogue teenage dreams. Serial 
Mom was on the telly, a JLS poster hung under a TV chair and a Tracey Emin-like 
bed sat catastrophically in the middle littered with empty bottles of gin, 
whisky and gin. It was perfect. The clothes spoke to a sense of adolescent 
awkwardness and dislocation pinned to her muse, River Phoenix. In the show 
notes, Williams was said to have “got lost in the place between reality and 
fantasy that exists in the teenage imagination,” but, she continued “the thing 
about River was, he just got it.” Phoenix was the oldest of his clan and the 
logo “First Born” re-appeared on the clothes, written in 80s Kerrang!-font. Of 
the other clothes, there were lilac pyjamas decorated with angel face prints 
and fringed with green, oversize denim dungarees worn with diamond buckled 
shoes, homely grey knitted jumpers featuring a Battenberg-like print, and bags 
featuring stuffed toy bears and cats straight out of Sonic Youth’s Dirty album 
sleeve.

 Shrimps Spring Summer 2017. Photograph: Smiejkowska/Rex/Shutterstock 
Fashion’s obsession with the ruff and the puff shows no sign of stopping. 
Molly Goddard, J.W.Anderson and Preen were just some of the labels that 
incorporated it into their collections. While Hannah Weiland’s Shrimps took 
elements from Tim Curry’s turn as Pennywise in Stephen King’s IT, a masterclass 
in camp creepiness. The presentation featured a childlike mise en scène with 
diamond-encrusted sea shells, old-fashioned pyjamas worn with night bonnets and 
delicately luxurious clown ruffs, fringed with gold and black.
