Hey Amanda,

It's Nate, formerly from Gitane. Look forward to seeing you tonight. Don't 
know if you've chimed in, or even have thoughts, but was wondering what you 
thought about the TSwift vs. Spotify debate?

P.S. What are the odds you'd have time to draw a Tardis tonight at the signing 
for down the road tattoo purposes?

<http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/music_news/2014/11/unpredictable_amanda_palmer_does_things_her_way>

....and the quote kind of sums it up:

"people want me to ride in and lop off Taylor Swift’s head with my 
crowdsourcing sword and I won’t do it."

Hey Amanda! I love your work, can't wait to read your new book :)
Two questions: which is your favourite song (that you've written/sung) and 
when are you visiting us in England?! <3

EASY
1) my favorite songs rotate all the time. i'm currently engaged in a love 
affair with "the bed song", which i've been playing live on the book tour and 
it just works wonders at the moment....

<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sW4dwXXX7Q>

2) HOPEFULLY THIS SPRING.
anthony, my best friend, is still very sick with cancer, and i'm currently 
leaving all plans on hold until he stabilises. when/if you read the book, 
you'll understand why.

If it wasn't gratuitous in any way, and it was tastefully done, would you 
consider keeping your clothes on in a live show?

i'll consider it, but only if the entire audience shows up naked.

Hi Amanda,

I know you & Neil have an open relationship - have you always been poly, and 
how have you and Neil navigated this aspect of your relationship (especially 
when you're apart a lot!). Do you have certain rules / things you are or aren't 
allowed to do outside of the relationship? How do you make it work?

we make it work by constantly talking and making our number one priority to 
Not Hurt One Another. it's not a choice i'd recommend you make unless you have 
an incredibly strong/tight relationship that isn't easily threatened by tempers 
and jealousy, and even then, neil and i have our weak moments. we do have rules 
(i've voted down certain lovers of his, and he's done the same) but we are in a 
constant state of learning and evolving...the main rules remains: us first, 
compassion first, honesty first. when those go away, we start floundering.

Hi Amanda,

I love your work and your performing - best gig ever was the Union Chapel when 
I managed to meet you and Neil after. Thank you.

I just wanted to ask whether you heard anything back from the Daily Mail? I 
was fortunate enough to be in the Roundhouse that night, and thought you rocked 
your response. Did they ever print anything about that or you again?

Also, just finished the book and loved it. Keep on being you. You're a gift to 
the world.

She’s referring to this story

the one i just workshopped ("the bed show", at bard college last week) is 
still in its infancy...and when i'm done with this book nonsense i'll hopefully 
dust it off and keep working on it....

you should read the book, where i go into depth about this topic.

i am scared shitless of:

-being alone
-being misunderstood
-being invisible.
....and oh the list goes on.

Amanda - Congrats on your success. The music industry and compensation 
structure seems really messed up. Just wondering what your thoughts are on 
crowd funding today. Has crowd funding gotten too crowded and competitive? Does 
one have to be outrageous to get attention and funded? Has your approach to 
"The Art of Asking" and crowd funding changed over time? What is your best 
advice today? Thanks.

i think crowdfunding is definitely wearing people out at the moment, on both 
sides...and there's kind of a grand balance happening in the AMOUNT of 
crowdfunding projects out there: there's a kind of crowdfunding-fatigue i see 
happening, because so many people are using it....BUT on the flip side, now 
that people are UNDERSTANDING how it works, it's becoming an even more powerful 
too. i think what we're starting to see is the drop off of "OH MY GOD COOL 
SYSTEM LET ME SEE HOW IT WORKS AND FUND EVERY FAMILY MEMBER AND ARTIST AND 
FRIEND!!!" to "ahh, ok.... i understand how this works, and these are the 
artists and friends and family members i need to prioritise, because they are 
the ones i want to help, and i only have so many resources"

Hey Amanda,

It's Nate, formerly from Gitane. Look forward to seeing you tonight. Don't 
know if you've chimed in, or even have thoughts, but was wondering what you 
thought about the TSwift vs. Spotify debate?

P.S. What are the odds you'd have time to draw a Tardis tonight at the signing 
for down the road tattoo purposes?

Hey Amanda! I love your work, can't wait to read your new book :)

when are you visiting us in England?! <3

EASY
1) my favorite songs rotate all the time. i'm currently engaged in a love 
affair with "the bed song", which i've been playing live on the book tour and 
it just works wonders at the moment....

2) HOPEFULLY THIS SPRING.
anthony, my best friend, is still very sick with cancer, and i'm currently 
leaving all plans on hold until he stabilises. when/if you read the book, 
you'll understand why.

If it wasn't gratuitous in any way, and it was tastefully done, would you 
consider keeping your clothes on in a live show?

Hi Amanda,

I know you & Neil have an open relationship - have you always been poly, and 
how have you and Neil navigated this aspect of your relationship (especially 
when you're apart a lot!). Do you have certain rules / things you are or aren't 
allowed to do outside of the relationship? How do you make it work?

we make it work by constantly talking and making our number one priority to 
Not Hurt One Another. it's not a choice i'd recommend you make unless you have 
an incredibly strong/tight relationship that isn't easily threatened by tempers 
and jealousy, and even then, neil and i have our weak moments. we do have rules 
(i've voted down certain lovers of his, and he's done the same) but we are in a 
constant state of learning and evolving...the main rules remains: us first, 
compassion first, honesty first. when those go away, we start floundering.

Hi Amanda,

I love your work and your performing - best gig ever was the Union Chapel when 
I managed to meet you and Neil after. Thank you.

I just wanted to ask whether you heard anything back from the Daily Mail? I 
was fortunate enough to be in the Roundhouse that night, and thought you rocked 
your response. Did they ever print anything about that or you again?

Also, just finished the book and loved it. Keep on being you. You're a gift to 
the world.

you should read the book, where i go into depth about this topic.

i am scared shitless of:

-being alone
-being misunderstood
-being invisible.

Amanda - Congrats on your success. The music industry and compensation 
structure seems really messed up. Just wondering what your thoughts are on 
crowd funding today. Has crowd funding gotten too crowded and competitive? Does 
one have to be outrageous to get attention and funded? Has your approach to 
"The Art of Asking" and crowd funding changed over time? What is your best 
advice today? Thanks.

i think crowdfunding is definitely wearing people out at the moment, on both 
sides...and there's kind of a grand balance happening in the AMOUNT of 
crowdfunding projects out there: there's a kind of crowdfunding-fatigue i see 
happening, because so many people are using it....BUT on the flip side, now 
that people are UNDERSTANDING how it works, it's becoming an even more powerful 
too. i think what we're starting to see is the drop off of "OH MY GOD COOL 
SYSTEM LET ME SEE HOW IT WORKS AND FUND EVERY FAMILY MEMBER AND ARTIST AND 
FRIEND!!!" to "ahh, ok.... i understand how this works, and these are the 
artists and friends and family members i need to prioritise, because they are 
the ones i want to help, and i only have so many resources"
