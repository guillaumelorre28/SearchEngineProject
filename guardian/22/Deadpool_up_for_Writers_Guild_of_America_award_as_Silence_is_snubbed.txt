and Paul Wernick from the X-Men comic books.

The last film’s final inclusion is one of a number of controversies around 
this year’s selection. Moonlight’s story was derived from a play and Loving 
from a documentary – despite both being nominated in the original screenplay 
category – while some have also criticised the fact the work of Tony Kushner on 
Fences is uncredited.

Some pundits, meanwhile, expressed 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/wga-awards-deadpool-nomination-what-does-mean-oscars-960831>
 surprised that the guild, who vote on nominations and subsequently for the 
prizes, had not found space for Whit Stillman’s Jane Austen adaptation Love & 
Friendship; Silence, which Martin Scorsese and Jay Cocks wrote from the novel 
by Shusaku Endo; or Noah Oppenheim’s Jackie.

The WGAs will be announced on 19 February.
