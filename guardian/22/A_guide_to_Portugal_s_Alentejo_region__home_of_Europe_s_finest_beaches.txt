It’s 7pm on a balmy Saturday night in June, and I have just ordered my first 
Sagres beer inI Cervejaria 
<http://casasbrancas.pt/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,48/Itemid,31/lang,en/>
, a restaurant in Zambujeira do Mar, one of the prettiest villages on 
Portugal’s south-west coast. The place is empty, but this doesn’t surprise me 
at all. I have spent two weeks in this area, driving along empty roads, playing 
with my son on empty beaches, and staying in B&Bs where we are the only guests.

No doubt the restaurant, run by two brothers for the past 28 years, is buzzing 
in July and August, when Portuguese holidaymakers descend on the Alentejo 
coast. But for the other 10 months of the year, the trickle of diners who come 
to feast on fantastically fresh seafood reflects the general pace of life in 
the Alentejo: sleepy, bordering on comatose.

One of the poorest, least-developed, least-populated regions in western 
Europe, the Alentejo has been dubbed both the Provence and the Tuscany of 
Portugal. Neither is accurate. It’s scenery is not as pretty and, apart from in 
the capitalEvora 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/10/portugal-alentejo-food-wine-restaurants>
, its food isn’t as sophisticated. The charms of this land of wheatfields, cork 
oak forests, wildflower meadows and tiny white-washed villages, are more subtle 
than in France or Italy’s poster regions.

To travel here is to step back in time 40 or 50 years. Life rolls along at a 
treacly pace; there’s an unnerving stillness to the landscape. But that 
stillness ends abruptly at the Atlantic Ocean, where there is drama in spades. 
Protected by theSouth West Alentejo and Costa Vicentina national park 
<http://www.visitportugal.com/en/NR/exeres/40048323-D0A9-4FAC-B8A6-FEFFC9B4267F>
, the 100km of coastline from Porto Covo in the Alentejo to Burgau in the 
Algarve is the most stunning in Europe. And yet few people seem to know about 
it.Walkers come to admire the views 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/mar/15/rota-vicentina-walking-portugal-holiday>
 from the Fisherman’s Way, surfers to ride the best waves in Europe, but day 
after day we had spectacular beaches to ourselves.

The lack of awareness is partly a matter of accessibility (these beaches are a 
good two hours’ drive from either Faro or Lisbon airports) and partly to do 
with a lack of beachside accommodation. There are some gorgeous, independent 
guesthouses in this area (see below), but they are hidden in valleys or at the 
end of dirt tracks.

Our base was Herdade da Nespereira <http://www.herdadedanespereira.com/>, a 
beautiful 600-acre estate of uncultivated land covered in rock-rose, eucalyptus 
and wild flowers 13km inland from Zambujeira. Our one-bedroom home, Azenha, was 
once home to the miller who tended the now-restored watermill next to it. A 
kilometre away from the main house, pool and restaurant, it is gloriously 
isolated. If Julian Assange ever leaves the Ecuadorian embassy in London, I 
suggest he hotfoots it to an Alentejo hideaway. He’d be safe for months.

Nespereira. Photograph: PR 
Stepping out of the house in the morning to greet our neighbours – wild horses 
on one side, donkeys on the other – with nothing but birdsong filling the air, 
I felt a sense of adventure you normally only get with wild camping.

“When people first arrive, they feel a little anxious wondering what they are 
going to do the whole time,” Sarah Gredley, the English owner of Nespereira, 
told me. “But it doesn’t usually take them long to realise that the whole point 
of being here is to slow down, to enjoy nature.”

 Herdade da Nespereira windmill house, Alentejo, Portugal. Photograph: PR 
We followed her advice, walking down to the stream in search of terrapins and 
otters, or through clusters of cork oak trees, their branches hairy with lichen 
like the ancient trees of a fairytale forest. On some days, we tramped uphill 
to the windmill, now a romantic house for two, for panoramic views across the 
estate and beyond.

When we ventured out, we were always drawn back to the coast – the gentle 
sands and shallow bay of Farol beach close to Vila Nova de Milfontes, the rock 
pools of Almograve or the cove at Carvalhal. At the end of the day, we would 
head, sandy-footed, to the nearest restaurant, knowing that at every one there 
would be a cabinet full of fresh seafood to choose from – bass, bream, salmon, 
lobster, prawns, crabs, goose barnacles, clams … We never ate the same thing 
twice.

A kilometre or so from I Cervejaria, on Zambujeira’s idyllic natural harbour is
O Sacas <https://www.facebook.com/restaurante.osacas>, originally built to feed 
the fishermen but now popular with everyone. After scarfing platefuls of 
seafood on the terrace, we wandered down to the harbour where two fishermen, 
kitted out in wetsuits, were setting out by boat across the clear turquoise 
water to collect goose barnacles. Other than them, the place was deserted – 
just another empty beauty spot where I wondered for the hundredth time that 
week how this pristine stretch of coast has remained so undiscovered.

WHERE TO STAY


100km of the Alentejo coast is natural park, so there are no hotels directly 
on the beach. The accommodation below is within easy reach of the coast by car 
(a car is essential in this region, which has virtually no public transport).

 The stylish interior of Monte West Coast. 
6km from Odeceixe beach
Newly opened this summer, Monte West Coast is a 50-hectare estate in a lush 
valley where an old watermill and outbuildings on the Seixe river have been 
converted into six stylish self-catering houses (sleeping between two and six; 
two have fridges but no kitchen). It has been renovated by Portuguese architect 
Pedro Oliveira, grandson of the film directorManoel de Oliveira 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manoel_de_Oliveira>, who is 105 years old and 
still making movies. The owner, half-Swedish, half-Portuguese Catarina Östholm 
Pinho, has transformed the traditional stone buildings with Alentejo tiles in 
the bathrooms and kitchens, and film posters on the 60cm-thick white walls. The 
hilltop pool offers gorgeous views of the valley, and a Moroccan-style tent 
provides an open riverside lounge area.

Catarina’s tip: 

Pont’a Pé (+351 282 998 104, pontape.pt 
<http://www.pontape.pt/restaurante/index.html>) restaurant next to the river in 
the historic part of Aljezur, serves some of the best traditional dishes, such 
as clams in white wine and coriander, grilled fresh fish and roast lamb. I 
always leave completely full. And if you want to stay longer, the owner’s 
brother owns the bar next door, overlooking the river.

 One of four bedrooms at Casa da Dina B&B. 
8km from Zambujeira beach
Tucked away up a dirt track on the outskirts of tiny Malavado, Casa da Diná is 
a four-room B&B run by Dina and her husband Walter, a painter whose works 
decorate their tasteful home. Whitewashed rooms have simple wooden furniture, 
and the garden is lush with peach, lemon, apricot and fig trees, but the real 
highlight here is breakfast. Three “courses” might comprise, say, yoghurt with 
fruit, then smoked salmon and cream cheese or Mexican-style eggs, then homemade 
cake, all beautifully served on delicate white china with white linen napkins. 
On at least one night of your stay it’s worth booking one of Dina’s 
three-course dinners (€25 a head). There’s nothing in particular to make it 
child-friendly but small people are welcome, and Dina and Walter were endlessly 
patient with my four-year old, who loved hunting for lizards in their garden 
and feeding treats to their poor decrepit old dog.
• No phone, casadadina.com <http://www.casadadina.com/>, doubles from €75 a 
night B&B (minimum two-night stay)


Dina’s tip: Café Central (+351 282 947 419) in the village of Brejão is my 
favourite restaurant in the area. The food is great, mainly grilled fish and 
seafood cooked to perfection, and the wine list is huge. From around €20-€25 
per person.

 Cerca do Sul guest house is painted in the traditional Alentejo colours of 
white with a blue trim.

A group of low-slung white buildings surrounded by the empty expanses of the 
Alentejo, Cerca do Sul has seven rooms, including one family room, all opening 
on to the terrace. With chill-out music playing in the background, hammocks 
strung from the rafters, yoga classes (daily on demand and free once a week) 
and an inviting pool, the vibe here is relaxed. But there is plenty of action 
nearby: Carvalhal beach is a short drive away, and owner Sara Serrão keeps 
noticeboards updated with local festivals, activities and events. Breakfast is 
a buffet of fruit, eggs, scones, iced tea and homemade custard tart, taken on 
the terrace.

Sara’s tip: The Historical Way is the romantic side of the Rota Vicentina, as 
opposed to the dramatic scenery of the Fisherman’s trail. The section between 
Odeceixe and São Teotonio, which you can access at Odeceixe bridge, is really 
beautiful and diverse, running along the Seixe river, then through eucalyptus 
forest – take a picnic.

 Herdade da Matinha hotel is a riot of colour in a lush valley. 
15km from Malhao beach
Hidden in a valley 5km south of Cercal, this country house is bursting with 
colour, thanks to owner Alfredo’s vivid paintings and red, pink and orange 
doors, chairs, sofas and cushions. Guests lounge in daybeds and by water 
features looking like they never want to leave. And if you make the most of the 
yoga studio, horse riding and cool pool it would be easy not to. Those who want 
to walk the Rota Vicentina could not be better placed as it runs right through 
the property. Dinners are prepared by Alfredo and Monica and served at high 
tables laden with vases of wild flowers and vintage kitchenware (meals are not 
cheap, though, at €38 a head for three courses, excluding wine). Family suites 
have bunk beds in a separate space visible from the parents’ room.
• +351 93 373 92 45, herdadedamatinha.com 
<http://www.herdadedamatinha.com/index.php>, from around €100-€170 B&B

Monica’s tip: Choupana (+351 283 996 643) is a very simple wooden restaurant 
directly on the beach in Vila Nova de Milfontes. Not many people go there – but 
we often go as a family and love it. It’s a great spot to end the day as the 
sun sets right in front of you.

Três Marias


4km from Aivados beach

An unpaved road running through fields of wheat and wild flowers brings you to 
Três Marias, a 10-room B&B, run by Balthasar Trueb (half-Swiss, half-Portguese 
in case you’re wondering). A passionate advocate for the area and a mine of 
information, he helped set up the Rota Vincentina walking route (see below). 
Ten rooms, including two family rooms with kitchenettes, are arranged in two 
houses, with polished concrete floors, mossie nets and small bathrooms. There’s 
no pool but the coast can be reached on the hotel’s free bikes. Outside there’s 
a shaded chill-out area with cushions and a telescope (night skies are 
dazzling) and the fields are home to donkeys and an ostrich – a lone survivor 
from Balthasar’s former life as an ostrich farmer. But that’s another story.

 is a great riding school offering everything from a one-hour lesson to

they also offer rides along the beach. From €20 per hour.

 The shallow, child-friendly waters of Farol Beach. Photograph: Isabel Choat 
Most of the beaches along Portugal’s west coast are pounded relentlessly by 
Atlantic Ocean waves and the Altentejo is no exception. Few are safe for 
children to swim from, so the gently sloping sands of Farol beach, protected 
from the rollers by a headland, are perfect for families.

There’s a restaurant right on the beach, so parents of older kids could 
feasibly sit on the terrace with a beer as their children paddle in the 
shallows. At low tide, kids can also busy themselves searching for crabs under 
the rocks.

Best for drinks with a view, Odeceixe

Photograph: Valter Jacinto/Getty Images/Flickr Open 
Odeceixe beach is breathtaking: a broad expanse of sand with a shallow river 
running through it (ideal for young children). The cherry on top of this 
natural gorgeousness is Bar da Praia, a tiny space with just three or four 
tables inside, and benches outside for taking in the view. It’s laid-back 
enough for you to rock up with sandy feet, sophisticated enough to serve good 
Portuguese wines in decent-size glasses and high-quality Spanish tapas. The 
cool soundtrack, the easy charm of the Spanish owners, the gobsmacking view… I 
didn’t want to leave. Next door, if you want something more substantial, is a 
more traditional restaurant and bar, with the same stonking view and a more 
extensive menu, including €4.50 burgers, plates of prawns, and pork chops with 
chips.

Best for rockpooling, Almograve

 Don’t forget your bucket and net. Photograph: Isabel Choat 
Every child loves rockpooling, and at low tide Almograve is a great place for 
hunting down crabs, shrimp and small fish in the many pools. You’ll need to 
stay with younger children and keep a keen eye on older ones – the waves here 
are rough – but it’s a great spot to while away a couple of hours with a bucket 
and a net.

 Carvalhal beach is reached by dirt track from Zambujeira do Mar. Photograph: 
Henrique Feliciano Photography/Getty Images/Flickr Open 
In July and August, Alteirinhos is the beach of choice for holidaying 
Lisboans, who prefer its slightly more isolated location over the busier beach 
at Zambujeira. It’s great if you want to feel part of the short-lived summer 
buzz. But if you want peace and quiet, even in the height of summer, try 
Carvalhal, an idyllic cove that is rarely crowded. There are no restaurants or 
kiosks at either beach so remember to take food and water with you.

THINGS TO DO


Walking

Of the few tourists I saw in the Alentejo, most were wearing hiking boots. The 
Rota Vicentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/mar/15/rota-vicentina-walking-portugal-holiday>
 is a 350km path between Santiago do Cacém, about 100km south of Lisbon, and 
Cabo de São Vicente at the south-western tip of the country. The route 
comprises two sections: the inland Historical Way, which runs through cork oak 
tree forests, valleys and villages, and the Fisherman’s Way, which follows the 
cliffs, offering superb views of empty golden sands, crashing waves, and the 
chance to see unique wildlife such as nesting storks at Cabo Sardão. With easy 
access on to the path and clear waymarking, it’s very easy to walk sections of 
the route independently, but several tour operators have packages, including 
British walking specialists Headwater (headwater.com 
<http://www.headwater.com/holidays/walking/portugal/W06AV.htm>) and Inntravel (
inntravel.co.uk 
<http://www.inntravel.co.uk/holidays/walking-holidays/portugal/along-the-costa-vicentina>
), and local outfits such as Ramblin’tejano (ramblintejano.com 
<http://ramblintejano.com/about.html>).

Portugal has some of the best surfing in Europe and hosts numerous 
international competitions, but you don’t have to be a professional to take to 
the waves. There are several surf schools along this stretch of coast. The 
Odeciexe Surf School <http://odeceixesurfschool.com/> offers one-, three- and 
five-day courses starting at €50 in low season (equipment extra).

 Isabel kayaks with her son on a Nature Activities trip. 
If surfing is too hardcore, kayaking offers a gentler way to enjoy this 
coastline.Nature Activities <http://www.kayaknatureactivities.com/en> is a new 
company run by Lisbon escapee Carlos Lourenço, offering kayaking excursions at 
the mouth of the river Mira, opposite the town of Vila Nova de Milfontes. 
Paddle across the delta, the sea winds at your back, spotting storks, herons 
and kingfishers along the shore (three hours from €25). Shorter trips (one-two 
hours) can be enjoyed by children from eight years up. Further upstream,Eco 
Trails <http://www.ecotrails.info/> offers a different view of the river, 
starting in the town of Odemira and following the river as it narrows, spotting 
numerous species of bird in the bankside reeds (three-five hours from €15pp, 
5-15-year-olds half-price).

A donkey’s plod is the perfect pace for this languid region. Burros & Artes 
offers tailormade tours from two to eight days from an idyllic base in the Vale 
das Amoreiras near Aljezur, just over the border in the Algarve. You spend a 
couple of hours getting to know your trusty steed, learning how to handle him 
or her, before setting off on a mapped route along the Rota Vicentina, staying 
in pre-booked guesthouses or hotels en route. You don’t actually ride the 
donkey – it’s there to carry your baggage and/or tired child. Owner Sofia also 
offers 1½-hour walks along a valley trail lined with rock-rose, lavender and 
eucalyptus – ideal for children.
