Winning tip: Solovetsky islands, White Sea


This archipelago is in the White Sea in the far north-west. You will find lots 
of history, including, on Bolshoy Solovetsky, mysterious ancient stone 
labyrinths, a famous 1920s gulag, and a medieval monastery surrounded by a 
kremlin. The nature is beautiful here too – some of the islands are 
tundra-bound; others covered in wildflowers and wild berries. The islands also 
offer a taste of Russian village life, but with lots more to do (excursions, 
bikes and boats available to rent, etc) than in most Russian villages. We 
stayed in Hotel Pryut (doubles from £35, breakfast £3.50, email
shelter_solovki@mail.ru <mailto:shelter_solovki@mail.ru>, no website), which 
has loads of charm and is close to the monastery. Highly recommended for a 
change from the big cities and accessible by train and boat or plane.

Kizhi Pogost, north west

 Photograph: Alamy 
Take a hydrofoil from the unprepossessing north-west city of Petrozavodsk 
across lovely Lake Onega (one of the largest lakes in Europe) to Kizhi, a 
pretty green island of wooden wonders. The trip takes 75 minutes and costs 
about 3,000 roubles (£38 return). Here you’ll find the remarkable Kizhi Pogost, 
a compound of two huge and ancient multi-domed cathedrals built entirely of 
wood, with not a nail to hold them together. Their onion domes are scaled with 
silvery shingles made of aspen and gleam in the sun. You can wander around the 
island’s open-air museum with its wooden farmhouses and chapels for glimpses of 
daily life in pre-revolutionary Russia and admire the painstaking carpentry of 
the restoration workshop.

Traditional village near Vladimir

 Photograph: Alamy 
If you are lucky enough to be in the countryside near Vladimir, 190km east of 
Moscow, for a bit, Suzdal is an absolutely beautiful village with traditional 
wooden house, churches and kremlin. It also has a great market where you can 
buy yourself a gherkin or two from older lady with a single, giant jar of 
pickles in front of her, or a blini pancake with sour cream and salmon eggs 
prepared right in front of you... delicious. And if it gets a bit nippy, you 
can buy a delicate, hand-dyed mohair shawl as soft as a cuddle.

Mafia graves, Yekaterinburg

 Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
For a memorable – if morbid – experience, visit the mafia graves in the 
southern Urals city of Yekaterinburg. They are in two cemeteries, one for each 
of the rival gangs that terrorised the area in the 1990s. Shirokorechenskoe 
cemetery, in the south-west of the city, is where members of the Central gang 
were laid to rest. Their graves are easy to spot, although you will need a 
while to wander around and find them all. They feature full-sized portraits of 
the deceased, many adorned in gold chains, leather jackets or holding Mercedes 
car keys.

A stop on the Trans-Siberian

 Photograph: Airbnb.com 
Utulik, a traditional Siberian village on the southern shores of Lake Baikal, 
has rustic architecture, scenic birch forests and a mountainous backdrop. To 
stay, I recommendFedor’s House <https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1302726>, a cosy 
wooden guesthouse, built and furnished by the owners. For an additional fee you 
can relax in itsbanya (Russian sauna). If you visit in spring you can try fresh 
birch water, tapped from the surrounding woodland. For local food, there’s 
smokedomul (fish from the salmon family endemic to Baikal) from the fish market 
at nearby Baykalsk and low-cost but delicious traditional dishes across the 
road at Cafe Polina.

Siberian summer

 Photograph: Alamy 
For the authentic Siberian summer holiday experience, go for the village of 
Sarma on the western shore of Lake Baikal. Shaman shrines, Buddhist stupas, 
Siberian cowboys and stone burial mounds litter the mountainous landscape, and 
a fishing excursion with resident sailor and former Soviet pilot Captain Andrei 
is available for just a few thousand rubles. We learned Russian songs, sat 
outside at night with stars and bonfires and experienced the delights of rural 
Russian cuisine, with daily meals of saltedkasha (buckwheat porridge) with jam 
and shashlik kebabs. A day trip to the island of Olkhon (the fourth-largest 
island in a lake in the world), organised by the Sarminskaya holiday park, 
offers a terrifying but exhilarating ride in a rickety old school bus (manned 
by a one-eyed driver) and a journey into the heart of thePribaikalsky national 
park <http://www.rusnature.info/zap/106.htm>. Shake off the nerves with a swim 
in the freezing cold, eerily transparent waters of the lake or by spotting the 
hordes of seals that gather on the island. Sarminskaya (doubles from £9,
viamichelin.com 
<https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Hotel/Sarma-665800-Sarminskaya_Holiday_Park-vxa6p5mp>
) was not the most luxurious of venues, but at around £5 a night for a 
traditional wooden hut for two it was the best-value adventure I’ve ever had.

In search of St Petersburg’s authors

 The cafe at Dom Knigi. Photograph: Alamy 
St Petersburg is literary heaven. Stroll alongside frozen waterways to 
Pushkin’s house and see where he died after his duel with D’Anthes. Drop in at 
Dostoevsky’s apartment and imagine the author rolling a cigarette, lost in 
thought. Follow with a visit to atmospheric Volkovskoe cemetery, resting place 
of Leskov and Turgenev. Then, just as the cold starts to deaden your toes, head 
forDom Knigi <http://www.spbdk.ru/>, an art nouveau bookshop gem. In the shop’s 
cafe, overlooking Kazan Cathedral, order a chilli hot chocolate and raise your 
cup to the ghosts of Russia’s literary greats. Perhaps next you’ll head to 
Nabakov’s house, or enjoy a laced coffee at the artyIdiot cafe 
<http://idiot-spb.com/eng/>.

St Petersburg guided walking

 On a guided tour in St Petersburg with Peters Walk. Photograph: Peters Walk 
The best decision we (four adults and three teenagers) made when visiting St 
Petersburg was to contactPeter’s Walk <http://peterswalk.com/> (£19 for 4-5 
hours) and arrange a custom-built tour. Ours included a trip to Zenit’s 
football ground, a very moving description of the siege of Leningrad and one of 
the best meals I’ve ever eaten, in a tiny Georgian restaurant. The worst 
decision we made was not to go on a guided tour of the Hermitage. We thought we 
would make our own way around and we got completely lost. Our hotel – thePushka 
Inn <http://www.pushka-inn.com/> (doubles from £90 B&B) – next to the 
Hermitage, was comfortable and a bit quirky.

Kazan’s bell tower

 Photograph: Alamy 
The 74-metre bell tower of the Cathedral of the Epiphany in the city of Kazan 
is spectacular. It is hard to miss with its striking red-brick facade and it 
was the tallest building in Kazan until recently. Built in the 1890s, it is on 
the Kremlin side (a world heritage site) of pedestrianised Bauman Street in the 
city centre. The bell tower has just recently opened to tourists, who can climb 
to the top for £1.30, and is an interesting contrast to the famous tiered but 
shorter Söyembikä Tower nearby.

Moscow clubbing

 The party gets started at Gipsy 
The capital has masses of trendy new places to dance away your nights. For 
excellent cocktails check outMendeleev Bar <http://mendeleevbar.ru/> (Petrovka 
20/1); for dancing, tryRolling Stone <https://www.facebook.com/BarRollingStone/>
,Gipsy <http://www.bargipsy.ru/> or Jagger 
<https://www.facebook.com/jaggerCity/>. But beware of “face control”. This 
1990s throwback is the bizarre system whereby the hugely unattractive bouncer 
gets to decide whether you are attractive (or wealthy enough) to enter his 
establishment. While back home, being female is usually enough to get you in, 
here the situation is reversed. The abundance of beautiful Russian girls, as 
well as the general idea that only men can pay for drinks, means being female 
isn’t necessarily enough. My advice? Dress up, go in small mixed-gender groups, 
smile, have someone try to speak Russian to the bouncer and, in the background, 
someone else speak English. The foreign card often does the trick.
