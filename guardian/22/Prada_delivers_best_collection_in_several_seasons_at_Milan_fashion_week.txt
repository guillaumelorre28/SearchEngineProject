In economic terms, Prada <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/prada> hasn’t 
been having the best of times of late. Not that you would ever guess that from 
its catwalk in Milan on Sunday. The brand’s show is one of the few real 
highlights in the Italian fashion calendar, and this time around it delivered 
its best – and most melancholic – menswear collection for several seasons.

The label remains so influential within the industry that it has become part 
of the Prada show ritual for attendees to attempt to decode every aspect of the 
event. Previous seasons have inspired showgoers to ponder whether the chocolate 
spread on small squares of white toast could be read as a comment on the unwise 
extravagances of the proletariat. No, seriously. Mrs Prada – as she is referred 
to in fashion circles – is known for her intellectual and often subversive 
approach to clothes and her designs really do inspire this sort of chin 
stroking.

Sunday’s show set was constructed from untreated chipboard panels, creating a 
square catwalk route picked out with black and red stripes. What did it mean? 
B&Q? A lack of pretension? Backstage, true to contrary form, the designer’s 
explanation of the set after the show was not entirely illuminating either – 
she alluded to a town square where people of different social status meet.

On the catwalk, the clothes had a distinctly naval feel. Not nautical in the 
jolly sense, more like naval in the misty, melancholic, bleak port sense. The 
models, wearing sailor hats, cropped uniform trousers and washed leather tunic 
tops, looked as if they were about to go to live on a war submarine for several 
months.

Cross body leather bags – almost knapsacks – were worn high above the hips 
over tailored coats with large fabric covered buttons and reinforced elbow 
patches. Models walking to a soundtrack of Nick Cave and Kylie’s Where the Wild 
Roses Grow had bunches of keys jangling (and a curious mini notebook) against 
their crotches. There was a doomed romance to the whole affair.

The idea of a uniform is a popular theme at the brand. Mrs Prada has herself 
admitted before she started designing clothes in the late 80s she hated wearing 
clothes that weren’t from uniform outfitters. However, it would be wrong to 
reduce this collection to ‘bleak naval show’ because there were so many other 
elements to it. For starters, there were Elvis-style 50s shirts depicting 
warring Centurions, and Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra kissing a marine. Then 
there were multicoloured knitted patchwork cardigans, shrunken checked jackets, 
knitted long johns. An almost indecipherable mash up of ideas for the rest of 
the fashion industry to ruminate on – and inevitably be influenced by – over 
the next few months.

Backstage, Mrs Prada tried to explain her inspiration to a crowd of reviewers 
– alluding to the struggles of mankind in the past and what we can learn about 
the struggles of today. It was characteristically oblique. One writer suggested 
she was alluding to the migrant crisis, but Mrs Prada knows better than to be 
specific, instead muttering about the sea, assassination and wars. “I’m not a 
pessimist,” she said, “but it is something to think about.”
