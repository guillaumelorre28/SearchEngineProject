How to turn highbrow inspiration into no-brainer, instantly desirable clothes? 
Put it in the hands of Stella McCartney. The British designer, who showed her 
spring/summer 2016 collection in Paris on Monday morning, , described her 
collection as being influenced by the idea of an artist and their muse. But 
forget interpretations of Picasso’s portraits ofDora Maar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/may/24/art>, or Rossetti’s of Lizzie 
Siddal <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/aug/21/art.fashion>, 
McCartney is a designer that lives very much in the real world and her clothes 
were about modern life – appealing with or without the art references.

The first outfit, a long, red gingham dress with a polo shirt top, was 
followed by other, equally uncomplicated designs: tightly pleated skirts and 
tops in a sunny palette of pinks and oranges, and McCartney’s signature 
tailoring in slouchy trousers and sleeveless jackets. Shoes were either low 
sandals with a chunky heel or the latest incarnation of a hiking shoe with cork 
and rubber uppers. Most models wore oversized aviator sunglasses in bright 
colours.

The collection finished with a selection of summer 
barbecue-to-evening-at-a-garden-party dresses in net-like fabric, with flouncy 
skirts, some appliquéd with spiral and squiggle patterns. While these revealed 
quite a lot of model flesh, there is no doubt McCartney will produce more 
modest versions in her ready-to-wear collection. To put it in the parlance of 
social media, IRL – in real life – is where she excels.

Backstage, McCartney, dressed in a black sweater and matching wide trousers, 
elaborated on her artist/muse inspiration. “It’s about how important that role 
is and celebrating that,” she said. Her own muse? “Women, all women,” she said 
and hugged her sister, Mary, waiting to congratulate her.

In McCartney’s world, ideas are just the start of something, eventually 
leading to clothes that women want to wear. Her label, a highly valued part of 
the Kering stable, the luxury goods conglomerate that also owns Gucci, 
Christopher Kane and Alexander McQueen, posted profits of £4.36m in 2014, a 
rise of 22.7%.

That is only part of the story. There are 30 standalone Stella McCartney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/stella-mccartney> stores, and the label 
sells in more than 70 countries worldwide, with other markets proving stronger 
than the UK. China was described by the chief executive, Frederick Lukoff, as 
an area of “tremendous growth”.

Monday at Paris fashion week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/paris-fashion-week> also featured Sacai, 
the Japanese label designed by Chitose Abe, tipped as a potential replacement 
for Alexander Wang at Balenciaga. Launched in 1999 by the former Comme Des 
Garçons designer, it has grown to become a cult label for fashion insiders who 
like the way Abe deconstructs tailoring in new ways.

This strong collection continued her themes: there were floaty chiffon dresses 
with bright scarf prints in stripes, some with knitted dresses worn on top, and 
blanket stripes on jackets and wraps. Classic navy blue jumpers came with 
unexpectedly luxe gold embroidery on the back.

 Paradise Garage, an inspiration for menswear in June, was evident here too, 
with the logo for the 1980s New York nightclub embroidered on to lace tops. It 
was a great advertisement for the combination of innovation, invention and cult 
references she might bring to one of Paris’s most storied heritage houses.
