As a child on Fraser Island, Rowan Foley was inspired by the camping trips he 
took each year with his mother to enjoy the traditional life on the land for a 
month at a time.

Whether they were fishing or cooking over an open fire, it instilled in the 
young Foley a love of country and culture that propelled him first into a 
career as a park ranger and then to burn a pathway into the emerging 
conservation economy.

The former Uluru Park Manager from the Wondunna clan of the Badtjala people 
today heads up the Aboriginal Carbon Fund (ABCF), a not-for-profit company 
based in Alice Springs that helps Traditional Owners make money from their land 
through the market for carbon credits.

“Carbon farming is something you can do to generate an income by looking after 
country,” he says. “You can turn over a livelihood using traditional methods.”

As part of the current Kowanyama project in Cape York, Aboriginal rangers use 
the burning of savannah on pastoral leases during the cooler, wetter months in 
May and June to generate carbon credits they can then sell.

The greenhouse gases released in the burn are tracked and analysed through 
computer monitoring. The difference when compared to the unmanaged raging 
wildfires of the dry season is then turned into the carbon credit through the 
mechanism of the Clean Energy Regulator.

One of the big buyers has been the National Australia Bank (NAB) which has 
been carbon neutral since 2010, and the first Australian bank to achieve 
National Carbon Offset Standard (NCOS) certification.

I think it’s about making a contribution to future generations. You want them 
to experience the same beautiful land...

When looking to buy offsets, the bank considers price, location, underlying 
technology and the co-benefits to the community. Kowanyama Aboriginal Shire 
Council is a customer, and the bank is also working to support Indigenous 
suppliers as a founding member of supplier diversity advocate Supply Nation.

“NAB has shown good leadership in this space,” Foley says. “And I think it’s 
up to other corporates to do likewise. If we can get a stronger relationship 
between Aboriginal Australia and corporate Australia it must be able to benefit 
both. It’s something that I’m passionate about.”

Foley was working as a consultant at Centrefarm, an Aboriginal-owned 
commercial economic development organisation in Alice Springs, when he decided 
carbon farming was an innovative way to generate income from the land by 
turning controlled burning into carbon credits.

The aim of establishing the fund in 2010 was to work with organisations like 
Land Councils and corporates to build wealth for Traditional Owners, as well as 
producing environmental, social and cultural co-benefits, through the ethical 
trade of carbon.

Foley says the result is a perfect match of ancient wisdom and modern markets.

“Quite often climate change programs can be imposed on people,” he says. “Here 
you are going back to the deep traditional knowledge that is held in Indigenous 
groups. It’s something people have worked out before – they understand the 
logic behind it.”

Foley says across Cape York as a whole there has been about $36 million 
generated in the past two years in the nascent industry.

The burns at Kowanyama produced just under 20,000 Australian carbon credits 
last year. The aim is for a sustainable business with tangible social benefits 
flowing into the local community of 1200 Traditional Owners.

“As long as the skies rain and the grasses grow this program is sustainable,” 
Foley says. “It’s an agribusiness – we are selling a commodity into a market to 
generate an income. We have developed what’s possible but we want to have an 
expanded market of buyers and sellers.”

Foley says when ABCF made its first sale two years ago he was “over the moon” 
to see his idea actually working and putting money in the bank accounts of 
Traditional Owners.

“What we are doing here is a one-stop shop. By simply buying carbon from 
Aboriginal groups such as ourselves, you are meeting corporate social 
responsibility goals, you are addressing your Reconciliation Action Plan, you 
are supporting Indigenous business and reducing climate impact.

“People who invest in conservation outcomes alone aren’t going to get as big a 
bang for their buck.”

The next step for the fund is to develop a certification system to make a 
“Fair Carbon” standard over the next six to 12 months.

“People are still coming to terms that you can make an income from carbon 
farming,” he says. “Most people have not seen the birth of a new industry.

“I see our role as broader industry development – it’s about trying to grow 
the pie. It’s about building the tools that the industry can use. We want to 
have a pool of carbon that corporates can buy with authentication.”

Foley, who has spoken at climate change summits internationally, says there is 
potential for exporting technology and methods they have developed locally to 
places like South America and Africa.

The father-of-two also continues to be inspired by his late mother Shirley, 
who led his people’s native title claim on Fraser Island.

“I think it’s about making a contribution to future generations,” he says. 
“You want them to experience the same beautiful land, the same thing that you 
experience now.

“If you just dig it up or flog the land then it’s all over. Doing this here 
means it will be here for the next generation. Australia is a great place. It’s 
a beautiful country and we want to look after it but also generate an income. 
And it’s actually happening for real.”
