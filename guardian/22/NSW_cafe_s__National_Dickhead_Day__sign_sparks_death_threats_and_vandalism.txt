A regional New South Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> coffee shop that 
displayed a sign labelling Australia Day “National Dickhead Day” was vandalised 
and its owner sent death threats after pictures of the provocative message were 
posted on social media.

Matt Chun said a blackboard with the message in chalk was displayed for 15 
minutes outside his cafe, Mister Jones, in the south coast town of Bermagui, 
the afternoon beforeAustralia Day

It was reproduced on several Facebook pages belonging to rightwing nationalist 
groups and liked more than 700,000 times, Chun said ina Facebook post on 
Wednesday <https://www.facebook.com/mattchunart/posts/974242262654908> that has 
been liked by 13,000 people and shared more than 3,000 times.

He arrived on Tuesday morning to find “the door locks to my business had been 
drilled out and the windows glued shut”.

His inbox was full of messages “containing unprintable abuse and describing 
group plans for physical attacks”, he said.

“My voicemail account has mercifully reached capacity and I’ve long stopped 
listening to the graphic and explicit death threats.”

Chun, a professional artist, said he and his customers had also received 
online threats of “vandalism, arson, murder [and] mass violence”.

Despite the furore, or because of it, 26 January was his busiest Australia Day 
on record.

“The provocative blackboard seems innocuous now, entirely disproportionate to 
the scale of the hatred,” he said.

“Indeed, taken on face value, the blackboard was possibly the most Australian 
thing that one could write about ‘Australia Day’, in a country that claims to 
be proud of its ‘larrikin’ irreverence and self-effacing humour.”

The message was intended to be lighthearted, but he stood by its sentiment 
that Australia Day was “a singular atrocity”.

“Celebrating January 26 at best trivialises – and at worst glorifies – the 
invasion of this continent, declaration of terra nullius, massacre and 
attempted genocide of its 30,000-year-old Indigenous population,” he said.

“It is a day spent reveling [sic] in the mindless perpetuation of old myths 
and the clumsy fabrication of new ones. It is no accident that ‘Australia Day’ 
has been so effectively co-opted by an extremist minority as a thinly veiled 
anniversary of white privilege.”
