Sweat, soap spikes and snarls are key ingredients of punk – and all are 
present and correct in Derek Ridgers’ photography of the London scene in the 
late 70s. As part of the celebrations of 40 years of punk, and to coincide with 
theLondon Collections Men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-collections-men> shows this 
weekend, they will be displayed atPaul Smith’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/10/paul-smith-design-museum-exhibition>
 Ablemarle Street store.

These images might have been taken 40 years ago but they are still full of the 
fizzy energy of a firework of a scene, one that burned quick and bright. There’s
Debbie Harry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/jul/01/debbie-harry-at-70-in-pictures>
 in an asymettric frock and choker, Siouxsie Sioux in signature stripes,Jordan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/07/never-mind-bus-pass-punks-look-back-wildest-days>
 with her face painted in a stage cameo, and a young, topless Adam Ant pre-pop 
idol moment.

Even with all that star power, it’s the audience that really shines. There’s 
the classic studding on jackets, zips, ripped mohair, scrawlings on jackets, 
chains, schoolboy ties and razor blades dangerously close to jugulars. But 
there’s also an almost visceral growl of having fun at the expense of 
everything else. That’s in piles of youth bundled up together on the banquette 
of a club, a boy in a biker jacket perfecting his open-mouthed stare in white 
sunglasses, and a whole host of eyeliner-rimmed, wide-eyed unhinged stares. As 
well as snarls and spikes, punks did a really good line in scary staring. Study 
to perfect. Or, you know, just study.
