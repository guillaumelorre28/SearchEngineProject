1. MYTH: Cruise ships go to boring destinations.

FACT: If you’re not too busy having fun on board, how about exploring a rugged 
Alaskan coastline, soaking up culture in Ho Chi Minh or riding a camel across 
the sands at Agadir, Morocco? You can visit Napoleon’s birthplace in Corsica or 
walk through Mayan ruins in Belize. And much more.

2. MYTH: I’ll be bored by the activities on offer.

FACT: Shuffleboard? What shuffleboard? How about simulated skydiving, dodgem 
cars, rock climbing and surfing? Or travelling gently skywards in an 
observation capsule to 300 feet above sea level, for stunning 360° views 
without too much of an adrenaline surge? Test your skill on the roller skating 
rink, see what it feels like to fly, play on the full-sized basketball court, 
clown around at circus school, or relax with a cold drink and live music in the 
pub. Zip-lining or card playing: the choice is yours.

3. MYTH: The entertainment is tired.


FACT: People often brag about the on board shows being “amazing”. Don’t 
believe them? Well, they’re every bit as good as the shows you’d pay money to 
see at home. Since the days of dodgy cabaret, entertainment has risen to a 
whole new level, offering award-winning Broadway productions, accomplished bar 
performers and random pop-ups like pianos in lifts. TheTwo70 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewR3gbcReFw>° experience is a $27 million 
presentation using 18 projectors to produce a spectacle on a massive moving 
wall. A far cry from latter-day lukewarm magic shows and out of tune falsettos.

4. MYTH: My room will be small.

FACT: Your home on the high seas has been designed with plenty of space to 
move around: swinging cats is optional but possible. If you want more, look out 
for two-storey loft suites with whirlpool tubs. Rather save your money? Try an 
interior room with virtual balcony. You’ll see sunrise, sunset and everything 
in between without having to leave your quarters.

5. MYTH: Cruising is all about queues.

FACT: Check in online and organise your holiday in comfort. You’ll save time 
and there won’t be forms to fill out at the pier. On arrival, hand over your 
signed boarding pass, identification documents and registered credit card. Once 
you’ve checked in, it’s just 10 minutes from sidewalk to ship.

Evolution of the cruise ship

FACT: Can’t live without Facebook? Fear not! Most cruise liners now have 
satellite-based Wi-Fi and they’re pretty speedy for sea-based systems. However, 
don’t expect to get it for free: you might discover you’re keen for a digital 
detox after all.

7. MYTH: Dining times are set.

FACT: The only thing that’s set about dining is that it’s available when you 
want and you know it’s going to be delicious. The booking system gives 
passengers the opportunity to pick and choose restaurants and meal times. And 
if you want to eat in the same dining room at the same time every night, you 
can do that too.

8. MYTH: It’s all about buffets.

FACT: Say goodbye to the ‘70s prawn cocktail and hello to celebrity chefs, 
countless restaurants and exclusive dining experiences. Think freshly sliced 
salumi at Jamie’s Italian, Michael Schwartz’s gastropub, made-to-order sushi 
and sashimi at Izumi, melt-in-your-mouth steak and fantasy gourmet dishes. You 
don’t always have to do it posh, there are also burgers at Johnny Rockets, 
pastries, hot dogs and pizzas straight from the streets of New York, and French 
patisseries.

9. MYTH: I’ll have to do safety drills and wear an orange life vest.


FACT: You won’t have to wear a life vest but the safety drill is maritime law.

10. MYTH: There’s nothing new about cruising.

FACT: Did you hear the one about the bionic bartender? Quenching your thirst 
with up to two cocktails a minute, these robots are experts at filling orders 
with quiet efficiency. Plus, you can try out your own bartending skills and 
design a cocktail of your own.

Still think cruising is old hat? Try one of Royal Caribbean’s two-day sampler 
cruises

and check it out for yourself. It could be the best decision you’ve ever made.
