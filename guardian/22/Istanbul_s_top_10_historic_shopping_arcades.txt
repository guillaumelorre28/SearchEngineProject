Among the 5,000 French words absorbed into Ottoman Turkish before 1914, one of 
the most recognisable ispasaj. Half a century after their emergence in Paris, 
these covered arcades flourished in Istanbul, drawing on French, Italian, and 
Ottoman architectural styles. Straddling the boundary between seedy and 
stunning, the city’s arcades offer a meze of experience to the modern-day 
flâneur, in contrast to souks where whole sections are devoted to one product, 
say leather, gold or precious stones. However, the recent take over of Anadolu 
Pasajı by a chain store highlights the vulnerability of these treasure troves 
to urban change. Go soon to see them while they still stand.

Çiçek Pasajı

Greek banker Hristaki Zografos Efendi built this most famous of Beyoğlu 
arcades on the site of the Naum Theatre, which was destroyed by fire in 1870. 
The original name, Cité de Pera, is still visible between the ornate caryatids 
and clock face above the entrance. The wordçiçek, Turkish for flower, derives 
from the bouquets once sold there byWhite Russian exiles 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_%C3%A9migr%C3%A9>. Since its renovation in 
1988, the grand interior has been lined withmeyhanes (traditional 
bar/restaurants offering the quintessential trio of meze, fish, andrakı.

 is recommended for a night of aniseed-flavoured abandon.

In contrast to a typical Parisian passage, this arcade is covered with hanging 
vines and tree branches rather than glass. Its cobbled floor runs from İstiklal 
Caddesi to Meşrutiyet Caddesi, in the Beyoğlu district, and its central 
courtyard holds a hubbub of tea, waterpipes and backgammon. The arcade’s name 
comes from the Greek Hacopulo banking family, who opened the arcade in 1871, 
and it was later frequented by Ottoman writer Ahmet Mithat Efendi and the Young 
Turks. When you’ve finished browsing the bargain jewellery, secondhand books 
and Istanbul-themed T-shirts, sit down for an authentic and reasonably priced

Aslıhan Pasajı

If your senses tingle at the scent of vintage pages, then this arcade will be 
a labyrinth of delight. Also known as Sahaflar Çarsısı (secondhand bookshops 
bazaar), Aslıhan Pasajı offers two floors of used books, magazines, comics, and 
posters. Dozens of shops on each floor contain an inexhaustible library, 
covering everything from Anatolian mythology to pulp fiction and contemporary 
art.Gezegen Sahaf <http://gezegensahaf.net/>, on the top floor, is the largest 
of these shops, with an emphasis on art history and antique books.

Just like modern malls, many of these arcades were designed to offer 
entertainment as well as shopping. Atlas Pasajı has been a home to Atlas Cinema 
and the Küçük Sahne state theatre since 1948 – find these next to Sefahathane 
cafe and bar, whose arcade tables are a cosier alternative to true outdoor 
drinking. Just like Çiçek Pasajı, this arcade’s original building was destroyed 
in the fire of 1870, after which the ground floor became a stable for horse 
dealers. Past the bar and cinema you will find a jumble of shops for women’s 
fashion, antiques, and novelty souvenirs.

Standing by the Karaköy shore, Fransız Geçidi 
<https://www.facebook.com/fransizgecidi> reflects the strong presence of 
European traders at this port throughout the Ottoman era. Built in 1860, the 
cross-shaped arcade had fallen into disrepair before being restored to its 
neoclassical glory in 1992. The lower floors are filled with upscale cafes and 
restaurants, includingOps Passage <http://www.opspassage.com/>, owned by former 
sea captain Yasin Kalender. The Turkish breakfast, fresh seafood andkadayıf 
dessert (similar to baklava) are not to be passed by. Meanwhile, Kağıthane’s 
reproductions of vintage Turkish school notebooks make excellent gifts.

Around the corner from İstiklal Caddesi, one of Istanbul’s famous avenues, the 
entrance to this glass-covered arcade is easily missed. But it’s worth finding 
Avrupa Pasajı for its architecture alone, and also the engrossing displays of 
antiques, textiles, ceramics, and lamps. The arcade was previously called 
Aynalı Pasaj (mirrored arcade) after the ground floor’s 22 mirrors – which also 
fell victim to the great fire of 1870. A row of classical figures still adorns 
the arcade’s sculpted walls, which stretch upwards to an arched glass ceiling. 
If you feel your life would be more complete with a meerschaum pipe or an 
Ottoman dagger, then Avrupa Pasajı is the place for you.

This neoclassical pasaj was commissioned by a relative of the Syrian Hasan

Impressive wrought iron doors flank the entrance, leading to an ornate arcade

Coop live music bar <https://www.facebook.com/coopbar> attracts an alternative

Under the ownership of the Armenian Mıgırdiç Tokatlıyan, the Hotel M 
Tokatlıyan was a fixture in the high-class social life of Pera, the historic 
Istanbul quarter now known as Beyoğlu. Notable patrons included Leon Trotsky 
and Mustafa Kemal, but by the 1950s the building had changed hands and fallen 
into disrepair, at which point a local Armenian church bought the property. 
Calls to preserve the hotel as a museum were ignored, and small shops soon 
filled the space. A visit to Tokatlıyan Pasajı is an eerie exercise in memory – 
catch melancholy glimpses of Pera’s fantastic past as you stroll by the 
barbers, teashops, and printing presses.

Found in the Asian neighbourhood of Kadıköy, Akmar Pasajı entered popular 
parlance as “the satanist arcade” after 21-year-old Şehriban Coşkunfırat was 
ritually killed by three friends in 1999 and a police raid on the arcade 
discovered Satanist literature, axes and crosses, and 15 people were remanded 
in custody. Shops selling heavy metal LPs, CDs, tapes and T-shirts still line 
the arcade today, though you will also find more innocent purveyors of precious 
stones, crystals and secondhand books – the most reputable of these is Nadir 
Kitabevi.

This arcade began life in 1900 as a block of luxury apartments with a private 
courtyard, before being opened at both ends to allow pedestrians in. Eminent 
Armenian architect Hovsep Aznavur put his name to the building, also designing 
the striking Mısır Apartmanı on İstiklal Caddesi and several of Istanbul’s 
theatres, hans and churches. Today, Aznavur Pasajı is a prime spot to spend an 
hour or two surrounded by colourful tights, outlandish underwear, vampy boots 
and headgear of all kinds. The arcade’s variety of inexpensive jewellery and 
evil-eye baubles is also a sight to behold.
