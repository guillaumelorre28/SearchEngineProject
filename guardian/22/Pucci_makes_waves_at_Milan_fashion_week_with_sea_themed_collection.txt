Massimo Giorgetti, the new designer at Emilio Pucci, has two credentials that 
will have appealed to luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, who bought the house from 
the Pucci family 15 years ago.

First, the MSGM label Giorgetti founded in 2009 is known for colourful prints, 
which gives it a visual synergy with the signature swirls and flourishes of 
Pucci. Second, MSGM posted revenues of $45m (£30m) last year, making 
Giorgetti’s company one of the most successful new launches of an era when 
Italian fashion has struggled to nurture new brands.

Giorgetti’s proven business smarts will have appealed to LVMH, who are keen to 
broaden the appeal of Pucci. Previous designer Peter Dundas, now at Roberto 
Cavalli, focused on red carpet fashion, but an expansion strategy led by the 
new CEO, Mauro Grimaldi, will target a wider and more youthful audience with 
day and casual offerings.

Emilio Pucci is a brand that looms large in Italian fashion folklore, but has 
never had a commercial bottom line to match. Its prime asset is a dreamscape of 
powerful associations from a pre-superyacht era of refined jet-set elegance, 
when the label dressed Jackie Kennedy on holiday and Marilyn Monroe for 
cocktails.

Giorgetti, who studied accounting at university, understands that monetising 
this requires a certain amount of showmanship. He called his first looks for 
the brand, which he showed in Florence in June, a “pilot” episode; his first 
full-scale Pucci show, staged in Milan yesterday, he called episode one.

Episode one was, said Giorgetti, “a homage to the sea world, which constantly 
returns in Emilio Pucci’s collections. Since I was very young, for me, Pucci 
meant sea, beach life, Capri, Saint Tropez.”

The show, staged in a former factory – “I wanted a kind of flat space, a 
little bit sad, where lights and patterns could sparkle” – began with a bronze 
sequinned skirt in this season’s modish below-the-knee length, worn with a 
geometric monochrome top. Then came washed-out pastel sequins on a loose skirt 
and T-shirt shaped top, worn with flat sandals. It was a less jazz-hands start 
to a new era of Pucci than might have been expected, and looked fresher for it.

Laudomia Pucci, Emilio’s daughter and board member, says of her father that 
“in prints he expressed a contagious happiness”. In the later part of the show, 
Giorgetti attempted to capture this with ocean-themed prints – fish, shells, 
seagulls – but these more literal configurations of the Pucci sensibility were 
less successful than the clothes which took colour and sparkle from Pucci and 
moulded them into something new.
