Besieged east Aleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> is braced for 
a fierce bombardment by Russian and Syrian aircraft as rebel forces intensify 
their efforts to break the siege using suicide attackers and heavy artillery.

The attacks have claimed dozens of lives in western Aleppo, normally far less 
dangerous

 than the rebel-held east, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

On the other side of the barricades there is a sense of apprehension in the 
shattered streets of east Aleppo, as hopes that the siege might be broken 
mingle with fear of the impending attacks.

“There has been movement, people have been going to the markets even though 
they are empty of food and vegetables, but they’re going out. Kids are coming 
to the side streets to play with their friends,” said Omar Arab, a local 
journalist in east Aleppo.

“When the bombing stops, they go out because they’re suffocating from the 
bombardment. But when the regime waits for a couple of days they make up for it 
by carrying out massacres.”

The assault on the west of the city came at the same time as a relative lull 
in air strikes inside heavily bombed eastern areas as the government of 
President Bashar al-Assad and his supporters tried to tempt civilians in 
opposition-held areas to leave through “safe passage” corridors.

 and text messages to residents of opposition-held areas urged them to leave 
during the break in hostilities, and warned that those who stay “will be 
annihilated”.

But even those who would like to leave the hungry and dangerous east are 
distrustful of promises from the government, which hasimprisoned, murdered,

 and caused the disappearance of tens of thousands of opponents since Syria 
slid into civil war.

Almost no one came through the corridors, which opposition fighters said were 
not actually safe. Now those living in the besieged areas are bracing for fresh 
attacks, with the arrival of a Russian frigate armed with cruise missiles 
adding to apprehension.

Among those preparing for an attack are doctors and other medical workers. 
Hospitals have been repeatedly targeted by government-led air strikes. The 
Syrian regime says that rebels use them as military bases, turning medics and 
patients into human shields, a claim which doctors reject.

“It’s totally untrue. We’ve showed photos of the whole hospital, we even had 
American doctors here,” said Mohammad Abu Rajab, a hospital director, recently 
injured in a bombing.

The ruins of bombed hospitals have been extensively videoed and photographed, 
and none of the footage has ever included weapons or parts of them.

“They lie until people believe them. Weapons in the hospitals? What weapons? 
We are treating people, it has an operation room, an intensive care unit, beds, 
a patient wing.”

There are thought to be between 200,000 and 300,000 civilians still living 
under siege in east Aleppo, which has endured years of barrel bombing from 
government troops and more recently attacks with bunker-buster bombs, napalm 
and chemical weapons.

“We expect everything from Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>,” 
said one former official from Ahrar al-Sham, a hardline Islamist group also 
fighting in Aleppo. “There isn’t a type of weapon that hasn’t been used by 
either the Russians or the Assad regime, including chlorine gas. Do they have 
anything else?”

The UN’s Syria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> envoy Staffan de 
Mistura warned last month that east Aleppo could be destroyed by Christmas, and 
called on the world to intervene to avoid “another Rwanda, another Srebrenica”.

He offered to personally go to the city and escort out the jihadi factions 
that Russia and Assad’s government say control the east, and insist are their 
main targets.

But while the push to break the siege has been led by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, 
until recently allied to al-Qaida and which shares much of its world view, more 
moderate groups say that it does not control the city.

“The entire strength is with the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo, they are the ones 
in control in Aleppo, and they are from Aleppo,” said Sharif al-Halabi, a 
spokesperson for Fastaqim, one of the main rebel factions in the city’s east.

He said that the opposition still had the support of most people in the city, 
pointing out that they had chosen to stay as government troops tightened 
control of areas around Aleppo, even after the siege was briefly broken in the 
summer.

“Of course under bombardment people are going to be restless and complain, but 
the fact of the matter is the majority of those who live in the liberated areas 
are with the Free Syrian Army despite the siege.”
