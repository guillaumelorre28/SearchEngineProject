Design thinking is not just the way of the future, but is essential to 
business success, according to Tim Brown, CEO and president of international 
design consulting firm IDEO, who are considered pioneers in this progressive 
and creative methodology.

Regardless of the industry, tomorrow’s organisations will need to apply tools 
from the world of design and think like designers, but with a strong skew on 
human behaviour, if they are to keep ahead.

Design thinking is essential for every industry, from education to healthcare”
David Zach, Futurist 
“The most valuable company in the world places design at the centre of 
everything it does,” Brown wrote in an article published in theHarvard Business 
Review last year. “Now that design thinking is everywhere, it’s tempting to 
simply declare it dead – to ordain something new in its place.

“It’s a methodology always in pursuit of unforeseen innovation, so reinventing 
itself might seem like the smart way forward. But in practice, design thinking 
is a set of tools that can grow old with us. And I’d argue that in order to 
create sustained competitive advantage, businesses must be not just 
practitioners, but masters of the art.”

Jonah Cretser-Hartenstein, manager of Digital Innovation and Emerging Channels 
at ING DIRECT, agrees, describing design thinking as “a global phenomenon” and 
that the key to future success lies in harnessing this creative methodology to 
set a brand, company or product apart.

“If you look back through history, products that have been designed well and 
for people, and not just for the benefit of the business, have always been more 
successful,” he says. “But I think now in this day and age – and into the 
future – it’s becoming more important because customers are spoilt for choice.

“Being able to differentiate in the marketplace is getting a lot harder. 
Mobile phones are a great example. Blackberry recently announced that they will 
no longer be producing mobile handsets. It was not that long ago that they were 
the leader in this space. But they were not able to differentiate themselves 
well enough as new players came into the market. And I think a big part of that 
is not really being in tune with the evolution of the customer desire. Human 
centred design is not just important to an organisation’s future success, it’s 
absolutely essential.”

Futurist David Zach describes design as being “the centre point not just of 
the economy, but where art and science meet form and function, strength and 
beauty – and it’s essential for every industry, from education to healthcare”.

In an online interview with SEGC (Society for Environmental Graphic Design), 
Zach was asked what conclusions might be drawn about the future of design. His 
response: “From where I’m sitting, two major forces are driving the economy: 
design and logistics. Design is how you create and organise your thinking about 
things; logistics is about how you organise and distribute those things. 
Logistics is measurable, design not as much. We are also seeing the automation 
of so many tasks.”

The potential of design thinking knows no boundaries. Its innovative and 
creative approach has been incorporated into a wide range of industries from 
healthcare, humanitarian and education to government, banking and retail. And 
while it is impossible to predict exactly how design will look in the future, 
there’s no doubt the focus will continue to shine firmly on the customer 
experience.

“The exciting thing about design is that it is always evolving,” 
Cretser-Hartenstein says. “At ING DIRECT we’ve always been a very 
customer-centric company, but what customer centric meant and the way that we 
developed products and services even five years ago is different to the way we 
think about it now. And it will be different again in the next five years.

“It’s hard to say what will happen in 10 years because so much of it will be 
led by the expectations of the customer. But if we look at a few of the trends, 
we are seeing a much faster uptake of technology, so the ability to respond to 
that is going to be crucial. We’re also seeing a proliferation of choice in the 
marketplace, which means consumers can be more discerning about what products 
or services they take up.

“But I think the biggest change will be around speed and our ability to 
understand the needs of our customers better than our competitors do. And as a 
result, I think we will see a lot more co-creation with customers. We will need 
to have the ability to understand quicker and deeper, and respond and iterate 
products and services to keep pace with changing consumer demand.

What is human centred design?

“Ultimately what we are talking about is a human relationship with every 
product we create – the customer, product, the service and experience are all 
intrinsically linked. The methodology we are using at ING we have branded 
internally as ‘PACE’ because we want to be able to increase the pace of 
innovation. It is customer centric with a combination of design thinking, lean 
start-up and agile methodologies so we can iterate and deliver quickly to meet 
our customers’ needs.”

The companies that will succeed in the future will be those that put design 
thinking at the top of the agenda, enabling them to truly understand their 
customer needs and expectations. In turn, they will not only be equipped to 
meet those needs and expectations, but also to exceed them.
