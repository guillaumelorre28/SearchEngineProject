We can only guess how future historians will report the events of last week. 
They will no doubt recall the defeat of the first ever female US presidential 
candidate from a major party, the shock election of Trump and the first 
historic meeting between Donald and Barack. Those of us who have lived through 
this era, though, will be able to give eyewitness accounts of what really 
happened:Ed Balls <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/edballs> danced Gangnam 
Style and went through to Blackpool.


Now that we have seen it, we can never unsee it. This is a man who learns a 
dance as if he were Hermione Granger facing expulsion from Hogwarts. And he 
performs it with a level of commitment matched only by a boa constrictor 
swallowing the last gerbil left on Earth, and with similar aesthetic qualities. 
The true test of any dance on Strictly is how soon and how frequently you want 
to rewatch it. And I can’t stop.

The highest credit must be given to Katya Jones, a woman of extraordinary 
courage. To trust him with those lifts when he has already nearly dropped her 
once on live television ... She is 90% bravery, 10% utter recklessness. She 
must have the strongest core in Christendom. It looked as if her hairstyle 
(super-high pony tail) was designed to act as a cushion and save her life if 
her skull came close to the floor. Which it did.

If you hadn’t already been struck dumb by that phenomenon, Danny Mac was 
sorely undermarked for not only one of the best Argentine tangos we’ve ever 
seen on the show but one of the best routines in the history of the show full 
stop. I think the judges are playing a cautious game with Danny, mindful of the 
voting public’s potential hysteria about “previous experience.” They’re careful 
not to overpraise him. In reality, he’s so far ahead of the competition, it’s 
laughable. And I can’t say enough how much I love Oti and her extraordinary 
legs.


Was it Daisy’s turn to go? Probably. Is Greg on borrowed time? Yes. But 
Natalie may yet pull a blinder. Am I the only person who thinks Joanne and Ore 
are frequently drawing the short straw on music choice? A rumba, the dance of 
love, to Ordinary People? (Sample lyric: “We’re just ordinary people/We don’t 
know which way to go.”) He was lucky to avoid the dance-off through no fault of 
his own. Louise, Judge Rinder and Claudia are steadily improving but need to 
pull something spectacular out of the bag.


Highlight of the entire thing (Gangnam aside)? Judge Rinder’s granny saying 
“We watch your husband on telly” while Mrs Vernon Kay tried to conceal her 
horror. Priceless. Here’s what the judges made of it all …


Darcey: woman of a thousand hairstyles

Darcey was curiously restrained this week. It’s as if they’ve asked her to 
tone down the “Phwooooarr” remarks to the male contestants as there have been 
(mercifully) few this series. Or there genuinely isn’t anyone she fancies. 
Favourite moment? Her face during Gangnam Style, screaming with laughter and 
clinging on to Craig for dear life.

Bruno’s moment of clemency towards Daisy was adorable. I’m sure he’s not 
briefed to do this and he would never admit to it, but he does have a habit of 
throwing a bone to the losing side in the dance-off and forcing Len to make the 
cruellest cut. Here it was a kind thing to do, making sure Daisy went out with 
her ridiculously beautiful head held high.

Len: the diamond geezer on a farewell tour

An excellent response to Ed Balls. “There are no words in the dictionary to 
describe that.” And: “There is always a sense of anticipation for you more than 
for any other couple.” If Len gets stuck for a job when he leaves Strictly, he 
can always write a compendium of euphemisms. I’m surprised he hasn’t been 
hotter on criticising the content of the routines the last couple of weeks. Was 
Gangnam really a salsa? (Not that anyone cares.) What about Daisy’s routine? 
(Also supposedly salsa.) Mind you, he won’t come out with critical remarks at 
feelgood Blackpool either. He must have laid in extra supplies of pickled 
walnuts under the desk to help him bite his tongue for now.


Craig: the great choreographer trapped inside a pantomime dame

Is it my imagination or has Craig actually not said “Ah-maz-ing”, “Fab-u-lous” 
or “Dis-ah-ster” this series? If I’m right, good for him: he seems more like 
himself this season than ever before, as if he’s finally escaped the shackles 
of the Darth Vader character who was promised on launch night. I thought it was 
a shame his reaction to Ed Balls was reduced to “OMG.” We could have done with 
hearing a lot from Craig; I wonder why he was silenced. Possibly he was made to 
sacrifice because Balls got an unprecedentedly long standing ovation. Anyway. 
My point is: Craig seems happy and I like him that way.
