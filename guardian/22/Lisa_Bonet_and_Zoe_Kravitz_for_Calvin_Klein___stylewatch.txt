If you’re feeling cynical about the glossification of motherhood, look away 
now. Featuring Lisa Bonet and her daughter Zoe Kravitz, Calvin Klein’s latest 
campaign makes the parental bond look as haute and aspirational as a Loewe 
puzzle handbag.

It’s clever casting – and not just for the matching cheekbones. Many thirty- 
and fortysomething fashion fans swooned over Bonet’s oversized blazers and pork 
pie hats when she played the Cosby Show’sDenise Huxtable 
<http://denisehuxtables.tumblr.com/> in the 1980s; many twentysomethings are 
currently in awe of Kravitz. But the best thing about this windswept vision is 
its ageless view of slightly rebellious, tattooed fashion. Very cool indeed.
