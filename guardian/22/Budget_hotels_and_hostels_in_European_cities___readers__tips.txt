Winning tip: Vienna

A five-minute tram journey from the city centre, MyMojoVie proved the hostel 
of my dreams. Behind a nondescript front door, on the top two floors of a 
typical Viennese apartment block, a group of local artists have designed an 
incredible network of dorms, private rooms and apartments with living rooms and 
fully stocked kitchens. Rooms are individually decorated in a modern, slightly 
eccentric, style. Loads of stuff is provided too: towels, hairdryers etc. 
Breakfast is laid out each morning and rooms cleaned each day, complete with a 
chocolate on your pillow.

The Roman city of Mérida in western Spain has a 1,900-year-old amphitheatre 
and circus, a well-preserved aqueduct, and the longest of all existing Roman 
bridges, the Puente Romano, which is still in use. All these stunning sights 
are just short walks from theParador de Mérida, an 18th-century former convent 
with its own amazing history. In the heart of the ancient city, the Parador has 
modern, comfortable rooms, a good restaurant, a pool and tranquil, peaceful 
gardens dotted with orange trees.

On a recent trip to Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/valencia>, we 
stayed at the charming, well-locatedZalamera B&B, a three-minute walk from the 
train and metro and on a direct line from the airport. The on-site rental bikes 
were perfect for exploring Valencia’s many attractions such as theCity of Arts 
and Sciences 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/09/santiago-calatrava-defends-record-architect-spain>
, the central market, cathedral quarter, and beaches. We started each day with 
a delicious alfresco breakfast on the terrace of this eco-friendly house, 
powered by solar panels and bio fuel.

Come snow or shine, this small city is an appealing break away from the hustle 
and bustle of the capital, Prague, and when there I’d recommend visitors to lay 
down their heads at the friendly, family-runKrumlov House. With a bohemian (and 
eco-friendly) soul and views to fuel the imagination this hostel makes an ideal 
base to discover this Unesco World Heritage city. It also hosts literary 
retreats and is the HQ of an online magazine, theLiterary Bohemian 
<http://www.literarybohemian.com/> and a place for WriteAway 
<http://writeaway.literarybohemian.com/> writing retreats.

A great find, right on the main square, is Hotel Royal Superga. Parking is 
hidden behind a wooden door right on Piazza Galimberti. There are plenty of 
shops as well as excellent restaurants within metres. Breakfast is included and 
the rooms are well-equipped. The 19th-century-built hotel offers a relaxed, 
snug library area with comfy sofas and free bicycle usage to guests for 
exploring along the river and Piedmont countryside. There is also a massive 
market on the doorstep on Tuesdays. Cuneo, although surrounded by mountains, is 
flat, so walking is easy.

The Hotel Domus Maria in Vilnius is in a 17th century former monastery where 
the monks’ cells are now guest quarters. There’s nothing spartan about these en 
suite rooms, however. The picturesque hotel oozes charm and tranquillity. It is 
in the old town and a 15-minute walk from the train station. I found breakfast 
in the vaulted refectory to be a real treat and the knowledgeable staff were 
only too happy to help my wife and I as first-time visitors to the city.

Lisbon has a huge range of hostels and this means the quality is fantastic. I 
stayed in thePoets Hostel on the edge of Chiado, one of the most interesting 
areas in this appealing city, which brims with bars down beautiful alleyways. 
The hostel has free Wi-Fi, sturdy bunk beds, small mixed dorms and good-quality 
showers and bathrooms. Breakfast was served in the large common area with bean 
bags overlooking beautiful old buildings and narrow streets. Among the 
highlights for guests are the excellent free walking tours and the chance to 
experience amazing fado music. The delicious tapas suggested by our guide (who 
worked at the hostel) combined with the pure fado sounds allowed my group to 
get an authentic glimpse into this beautiful city at night.

A rare moment of calm on the night of arrival in Tbilisi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/tbilisi>, July 2014. A taxi took us through 
the labyrinthine back streets of the old town before striking out across an 
LED-strewn bridge. While we were crossing the river, lasers cut through the 
sky, picking out a fast-moving cable car travelling above the water. Government 
buildings on the water’s edge were lit by fireworks exploding over nearby 
mosques and chapels. After 90 seconds slicing through this frantic vista, we 
were among the claustrophobic alleys once again, and almost immediately pulled 
up outsideOld Metakhi Hotel – the sense of calm in this little corner of the 
city was palpable. Soon after checking in, we took our grandstand seats on our 
balcony overhanging the Kura river, watched the controlled chaos below and 
wondered what special occasion warranted this celebratory display. The 
following night, we realised there was no special occasion - it was just 
Tbilisi being itself.

In the centre of Odessa the Babushka Grand Hostel has to be the grandest 
budget stay in all of Ukraine. It’s a very popular place to stay as it is right 
next to the pedestrianised Deribasivska Street. What I loved most about staying 
here is that Babushka (meaning grandma in Russian) really had that 
home-away-from-home vibe. Just like my grandmother’s place, the decor has 
character and you can enjoy endless cups of free tea and coffee. Plus, if you 
find yourself feeling a little lonely, there is a fireplace in the common room 
where many guests gather to share traveller’s tales.

My husband and I snagged an awesome deal at the Monbijou Hotel in east Berlin 
for only $70 a night. This boutique hotel is chic, clean, and offers a great 
rooftop view. It is elegant but modern, with romantic floor-to-ceiling windows 
in each of the rooms. The marble bathrooms, with high-quality shampoo and soap, 
feel luxurious. It’s in a great neighbourhood in the Hackescher markt, with 
lots of great food options for all budgets within walking distance including 
the famousCurry 61 <http://www.curry61.de/>, lots of falafel stands, German 
bakeries, and higher-end restaurants.

After three weeks roaming the Balkans, on hardboard mattresses and wafer 
pillows, we came across theKK Budapest Opera hotel for the softest sheets we’d 
slipped under in a long time. It’s right next to the Opera House, which is 
gloriously lit at night, and a short walk from the ruin bars, river and tourist 
sights. The friendly staff, sauna and bar in sleek surroundings ticked our 
boxes for a bargain £73 a night.
