Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> has claimed 
responsibility for a suicide bombing on Sunday that killed up to 49 Yemeni 
soldiers in the southern port city of Aden.

Officials said the soldiers were queuing to collect salaries near a military 
base in the Khor Maksar district when the attacker blew himself up. At least 60 
other troops were wounded, they said.

It comes eight days after an attack by Isis killed 50 troops nearby in Aden. 


Aden is the temporary capital of Yemen’s internationally recognised government 
in exile in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.

The administration has struggled to establish its control in the city as 
militants have launched dozens of attacks against its forces.

Al-Qaida <https://www.theguardian.com/world/al-qaida> and Isis have exploited 
nearly two years of war in the impoverished country to carry out assassinations 
and bombings, mostly in lawless southern Yemeni areas nominally controlled by 
the government.

Saudi Arabia and its allies in a mostly Gulf Arab military coalition have been 
bombing Yemen’s dominant Houthi movement in parts of the country under its 
control since it drove the government from power in March 2015. They have 
failed to dislodge the group from the capital, Sana’a.
