On the final day of London Collections Men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-collections-men> (LCM), the 
capital’s menswear fashion week, the focus shifted from all things British to 
style from across the pond. Coach, the 75-year-old American brand withBritish 
creative director Stuart Vevers <http://uk.coach.com/stuart-vevers-bio.html> at 
the helm, was the major show of the day. Rather than add to the theBrexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> debate, as other shows 
have, he kept his two cents to their original context: the US. Two icons of 
Britain 2016 – Kate Moss and her consort, Nikolai von Bismarck – sat front row.

Lindley Hall in Victoria <http://www.rhhonline.co.uk/> was transformed into 
the desolate American west with photographs of old billboards and telephone 
towers covering the walls, one featuring an American flag. It all formed a 
backdrop to a collection that allowed Vevers to do his trademark: using his 
outsider Brit perspective to bring a some cool to a blue-chip American brand.

The show notes called the collection “an eclectic American counter culture 
mashup”, but with the easy retail appeal that has seen Vevers give Coach the 
best financial results since he joined in 2013. References ranged fromGus Van 
Sant’s 1991 film My Own Private Idaho <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102494/> to 
episodes ofThe Twilight Zone <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone>, 
but were translated into rock’n’roll bikers, sporty bombers and punky studded 
jackets, along with tote bags, backpacks and holdalls. These are all items that 
have sold well for a brand with roots in accessories.

A collaboration with artist Gary Baseman <http://garybaseman.com/> brought 
paintings on the back of jackets, bags and sometimes on models’ legs as 
tattoos. Baseman also reworked theHave a Nice Day smiley face 
<https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c3/bd/8d/c3bd8de82245f154e2605265d3eb34eb.jpg>
 from New York plastic bags by melting it and adding a snaggle tooth on 
T-shirts. Vevers quipped that it was now “Have a Gnarly Day”.

Coach is now a regular at LCM, having shown on the schedule for four seasons. 
The “see now-buy now” trend meant that a selection of the smiley T-shirts and 
leather jackets with artwork by Bussman were available on the website 
immediately after the show. The collection will follow in store next year.

At a preview of the collection, Vevers said that even two and a half years 
into his tenure at Coach, his outsider status is still paying off. “It means I 
can play with references in a way American designers couldn’t – or wouldn’t – 
do,” he says. “Things that are really obvious, but sometimes being obvious is 
good.” A recent collaboration with Disney – launched on the same day as the LCM 
show and including bags with Mickey Mouse ears – is a case in point. Never 
afraid of the excellently obvious, Vevers wore a Mickey Mouse T-shirt for his 
post-show bow.
