A popular mobile phone game about collecting cats is being made into a 
live-action movie, to be released in 2017, in what has to be one of the most 
21st-century article introductions ever written.

The Japanese game Neko Atsume, which means “kitty collector”, created by 
Hit-Point, is being turned into a film starring the popular Japanese television 
and film actor Atsushi Ito.

The notoriously addictive game involves players populating a virtual backyard 
with food, cushions and toys to attract cats, who leave behind silver and gold 
fish as thanks.

The film, titled Neko Atsume No Ie, or Cat Collector’s House, tells the story 
of a young author, Katsu Sakumoto, who is struggling with writer’s block in the 
shadow of his own early success. After moving house in an unsuccessful attempt 
to reinvigorate his creative side, he spies a cat in his garden. He leaves food 
outside overnight in an effort to befriend it and a new obsession is born.

Ito, who plays Sakumoto, said his character’s connection with cats made him 
re-evaluate the way he dealt with other human beings. “The contact I had with 
cats while we were shooting scenes was a healing experience and gave me lots of 
energy,” he said on thefilm website <http://nekoatsume-movie.com/>.

The director, Masatoshi Kurakata, said: “I wanted to make a simple movie that 
gives off feelings of warmth. I and the staff and cast of the film really put 
our hearts into making the film.”

Neko Atsume has become a worldwide hit since its release in late 2014, with 
more than 5.5m downloads in its first year. Originally only available in 
Japanese, Hit-Point released an English-language version on iOS and Android in 
October 2015.
