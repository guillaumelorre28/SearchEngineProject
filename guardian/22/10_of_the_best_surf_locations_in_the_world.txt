Canggu, Bali


A decade ago, Canggu was just a black-sand beach with one food shack, rice 
paddies as far as the eye could see and a fantastic reef break for intermediate 
surfers wanting to take their skill to the next level. The wave is unchanged, 
though a little more crowded in peak season and there’s now a vibrant cafe 
scene and some hip places to stay, though it’s kept a laid-back, wellness-crowd 
vibe with none of the brashness of Kuta or swankiness of Seminyak. TheShady 
Shack <https://www.facebook.com/Theshadyshackbali/> is a great new spot for 
juices, low-alcohol coolers and tasty vegan food.Canteen Café 
<https://www.facebook.com/CanteenCafeCanggu/>, where vintage surf and 
skateboards adorn the walls, does excellent coffee and brunch.The Chillhouse 
<https://www.thechillhouse.com/> (doubles from €110 B&B) also offers surf 
lessons from €49, including board hire and a ratio of one coach to two guests. 
Yoga classes cost €9.

If Newquay is the loud, beating heart of the UK surf scene, Sennen Cove is its 
more peaceful and reflective soul. It takes another hour to get there, almost 
as far as Land’s End, but it’s worth every minute. The waves are some of the 
most consistent in the country, with a beach break that works left and right 
and will suit most abilities, but is far less crowded than many Cornish surf 
spots. The location feels wild and unspoiled with clear ocean, rolling grassy 
hills and craggy cliffs. The Sennen Surfing Centre 
<http://www.sennensurfingcentre.com/> offers lessons from £30, and board and 
wetsuit can be hired on the beach from £14. Yurt accommodation costs £19pp a 
night atWhitesands Lodge <http://www.whitesandslodge.co.uk/> just inland from 
the beach.Ben Tunnicliffe’s Sennen Cove <http://benatsennen.com/> 
family-friendly restaurant is worth a visit for fresh, unfussy seasonal 
cooking, or a guest ale with a view of the waves at its wooden outdoor bar, the 
Surf Den.

Thanks to recent advances in wetsuit technology, surfing in the icy waters off 
Norway is not just possible but wholly enjoyable. There are zero crowds and the 
beaches are wild and rugged – in natural amphitheatres with steep majestic 
mountains all around. The cliffs also protect the waves from the wind and the 
swell is remarkably consistent, with breaks to suit all levels.Lapoint Surf 
Camps <http://www.lapointcamps.com/surfcamp/norway/> runs packages in the 
fishing village of Hoddevik for beginner and intermediate surfers, including 
accommodation for seven nights, small-group lessons, board and wetsuit hire and 
use of the house kitchen from €577.

California may be the obvious capital of surfing in the US, but Hawaii, where 
the sport originated, is its spiritual home. Waikiki, the beachfront 
neighbourhood of Honolulu, is a great place to learn to surf, as the water is 
warm, the waves roll in gently and the rides are long, so when you do stand up 
you really get to enjoy it. With its high-rise backdrop, Waikiki is often 
dismissed as a tourist trap but it’s now finding fresh favour among visitors 
wanting a tropical beach holiday with some urban benefits, such as good food 
and decent coffee. Affordable hotels aren’t easy to come by butMaile Sky Court 
<http://www.mailesky.com/> has doubles from $105. Star Beachboys

In the south-west corner of the Algarve, Lagos is well-placed to pick up 
swells from every direction; it has breaks for all levels of surfer within easy 
reach. The town beach, Meia Praia, is a good beginner’s wave, while Zavial, 20 
minutes’ drive west, is a world-class point break for experienced surfers. The 
attractive old fishing town boasts great sea-themed restaurants such as 
Escondidinho (Rua do Cemitério 38) and The Blue Door (Rua dos Ferreiros 17), 
but a big part of the Lagos sell has always been that it is a good place to 
party.Mellow Loco <https://www.facebook.com/MellowLoco/>, run by pro surfers 
Marlon and Melvin Lipke, is the wildest spot, and Stevie Ray’s has popular live 
funk and soul nights. Health-conscious surfers will love new juice and salad

A growing band of travellers are converging on the small fishing village of El 
Paredón, which offers Guatemala’s most consistent surf at a beach break that 
never gets crowded and can accommodate most levels of surfer, depending on the 
tide. Turtles nest on the black sand beach, and mangrove forests grow all 
around. AtParedón Surf House <http://www.paredonsurf.com/surfing_guatemala.htm> 
private surf lessons cost about £12, board hire starts at £10 a day, and dorm

English lessons for children.

From a wave-riding point of view, Mozambique is relatively unexplored, yet 
much of its 2,500km coastline is surfable, with tropical blue waters washing on 
to palm-fronted white sandy beaches. Tofo, on the Ponta da Barra peninsula, is 
a pretty beach town with a central market that sells bright sarongs as well as 
fruit, veg and fish. Small, clean waves are protected by a headland and a reef, 
so it’s a good place for learners and improvers, though more advanced surfers 
won’t have to travel far to find challenging reef breaks, and the world-class, 
right-hand point breaks at nearby Tofinho beach.Errant Surf
