BEST SEASIDE COTTAGES


Spectacular views: CORNWALL

A renovated 1930s wooden hideaway on the cliffs overlooking Whitsand Bay, 
Rockwater Cabin takes some beating. Dine alfresco on the large decking area and 
you could catch sight of dolphins and porpoises. Inside it’s pretty and 
pristine: fresh, whitewashed walls, vintage furniture and sweet touches like 
fairy lights in the dining area and bright paintings by the owner on the walls. 
Newly available, it’s bound to get snapped up, so act quickly.

For a quintessential English beach holiday, Fisherman’s Cottage in Kingsdown, 
near Deal, ticks all boxes (minus sand in your sandwiches: the beach is of the 
pebbly variety). The two-bedroom end-of-terrace house is cute and cosy with 
charming garden and game-stocked summerhouse (dogs – but one only – welcome 
too). It’s the beach hut – complete with barbecue, table and chairs and 
surfboards, a few yards from the sea – that’s the real winner, though. Medieval 
Sandwich is close by and there’s plenty to do on the doorstep, with a pub 
around the corner and a golf course on the clifftop.

Situated near the bottom of the steepest road in England, Bird How in Holmrook 
is in a super-remote location in one of the least-visited parts of the Lake 
District, above the river Esk. Small and rustic, it’s perfect for a 
back-to-basics stay and for hikers wanting a challenge without the crowds. 
There’s a twin bedroom and another with bunk beds (bring your own sheets) but 
there’s no bathroom – use the kitchen for washing, and the toilet’s in the 
former cow barn in the basement of the cottage.

New this year, the Hobbit Box is a cleverly converted wooden horsebox in its 
own wildflower meadow on a 115-acre glamping site, Secret Meadows. With 
handcrafted wooden furniture, vintage velvet curtains and a Middle Earth theme 
(from goblets and round windows to Tolkien-themed prints on the walls), it’s a 
total charmer. There are two double bunks, a wood-burning stove, private loo 
and shower and wooden deck for moonlit nights underneath the oak trees. The 
site is run by The Sinfield Nature Conservation Trust and there are nature 
trails through old woodland and meadows, and bushcraft and Wild Way workshops 
too.

With its gleaming white walls and stripped floors, Nethergill’s two 
self-catering cottages might imply a vision of unsullied escapism – but most of 
their guests come here to get a bit of mud on their boots. On a working hill 
farm in Langstrothdale, these two converted haylofts are part of an 
environmentally sensitive retreat on 400 acres of moorland, meadows and pasture 
at the head of the river Wharfe. On site there are two observation hides (spot 
otters, black grouse, wagtails, redstarts, snipe and oystercatchers) and a 
field centre, while walks include direct access to Greenfield Forest (a red 
squirrel reserve) and the Dales Way.

There’s something totally magical about Eilean Shona, the private island off 
the west coast of Scotland that inspired JM Barrie to write Peter Pan. And the 
recently openedOld Schoolhouse adds a dreamy new place to stay. Totally 
off-grid (with no electricity, Wi-Fi or phone signal), it’s in a wild setting 
on a secluded bay with incredible views. The 1,300-acre island has eagles, 
otters and dolphins to spot. Inside, every inch is beautifully styled, with a 
mix of retro and contemporary furniture (not surprising when the designer is 
Vanessa Branson – sister to Richard).
• Sleeps four, £1,250 a week year-round (closed November to late March)

A clean-lined take on the log cabin, Culbin Edge mixes natural experiences 
with total comfort. Inside the cosy forest sanctuary there’s a modern kitchen, 
walk-in shower, bedroom with kingsize bed and living room with floor-to-ceiling 
windows. Outside a wooden hot tub and covered deck mean you can gaze at the 
surrounding fields and pine forest (and try to spot roe deer, badgers, foxes, 
red squirrels and pine martens) in all weathers. Wild sandy beaches are a walk 
away, or head to the pond to watch dragonflies. Recent guests have even seen 
the northern lights.

The closest you’ll come to a frontier cabin this side of Colorado, Ty Donkey 
offers a bit more comfort than your average settler’s homestead. The off-grid 
former railway cabin outside Crickhowell, in the Brecon Beacons national park, 
is a mix of log cabin simplicity and rustic decadence, with a hand-built 
kitchen, freestanding bath, solar-powered lighting, wood-burning stove, double 
platform bed and chunky wooden bunks (for under-eights only). It’s surrounded 
by 50 acres of woods and fields (also enjoyed by the two rescue donkeys that 
give the cabin its name) and visitors can spend their time swimming in a river 
pool and hiking through untamed countryside.

Named after the birds that sweep overhead, Red Kite Barn lies in a private 
forest north of Builth Wells in mid-Wales, surrounded by rolling hills. The 
traditional exterior hides a chic contemporary interior (and it’s eco-friendly 
too, with ground source heat pumps and wool wall insulation). The upstairs 
open-plan living area is flooded with light from windows on all sides, and 
downstairs there are three bedrooms (with beds rescued from London’s Savoy 
Hotel). But it’s the isolated location that’s the real winner: wrap up and 
enjoy a drink under the stars in the raised garden and forget about the rest of 
the world.

The National Trust’s newest holiday property, Foreland Bothy may not be what 
you’re expecting if you’re used to the organisation’s plush self-catering 
cottages. In this clifftop bothy, right on the South West Coast Path above 
Lynmouth, facilities stretch to a composting toilet and a cold-water sink. 
Think of it as a stone tent: if you want light after sunset, pack a torch; if 
you want to cook, you’ll need a camping stove. But what it lacks in frills, the 
bothy makes up for with unhindered access to wildlife. Instead of TV, enjoy 
panoramic sea views, tune in to the sound of stonechats on gorse bushes and 
spot black back gulls, kites, peregrines and, if you’re lucky, red deer or 
free-roaming Exmoor ponies.

A three-storey 1930s-built house by the coast in Beadnell, 1-2 The Haven has 
curves in all the right places. The bedrooms are downstairs and the living area 
is upstairs to make the most of the sea views. There’s oodles of space, with a 
terrace on the first floor and a sun deck on the second; two large lounges and 
a games room, make it perfect for large groups and families. Sandy Beadnell Bay 
stretches for two miles; the harbour town of Seahouses is two miles away and 
Bamburgh Castle four miles away. Summer availability is very limited, however, 
so move quickly.

Live out your Tudor fantasies at The Throne, a grade II-listed gentleman’s 
residence that dates back to 1478 (Charles I spent a night here during the 
English civil war). The house has secret doors, oak boards and panelling, stone 
flags, leaded windows, and wattle and daub walls – but marries old and new with 
the modern, bright, spacious kitchen and living area. There are seven bedrooms, 
and a lovely garden with trampoline and badminton net. Weobley is one of 
best-preserved “black and white villages” in England, full of timber-framed 
Tudor houses.

For a very special holiday steeped in history, try the Gothic Temple at Stowe 
(though it comes at a price). Built in 1741 and surrounded by Capability 
Brown-designed gardens, the rooms are all circular with pilasters, and the 
sitting room is decorated with heraldry and mosaic and topped with a gilded 
dome. The bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom are squeezed into turrets. There is a 
first-floor belvedere at the top of a spiral staircase, with stone seats and a 
view over the grounds, and a roof terrace.

Designed by modernist British architect Patrick Gwynne in the late 1960s, 
Vista Point, close to the pebbly beach in East Preston, has real wow factor – 
it feels like you’ve stepped back in time, with furniture and wallpaper from 
the era completing the look. The grade II-listed house (Gwynne completed it in 
1970) has a striking spiral staircase, five bedrooms, and an outdoor swimming 
pool (heated May to September) in the large garden, along with table football 
and trampoline. It’s one for splashing out on for a special occasion.

Hidden away in private woodland south of Newby Bridge – and 10 minutes from 
the shores of Windermere –Eller How House is a grand, self-contained wing of an 
architect-designed Regency villa, and has beautiful views. Its striking 
exterior is matched by unusual features inside, from ornate plasterwork in the 
living room to a collection of “heads” holding up the ceiling in the master 
bedroom, and furniture to match. With three en-suite bedrooms there’s plenty of 
space for families, and the lovely grounds, complete with summerhouse, are fun 
for children to explore. And, of course, the delights of the Lakes await, from 
walking on the southern fells to water sports on Windermere and Coniston.

It will come as little surprise that Kirknowe, now a peaceful, dog-friendly 
holiday cottage, was once a retreat for monks from Jedburgh monastery. Its 
double-height living area has an ecclesiastical feel, with a soaring arched 
window, huge tapestry and galleried bedroom (there are two more traditional 
bedrooms in a side wing). Colourful, boho decor and the wood-burning stove make 
this a convivial space to return to after a day walking or cycling around 
nearby Newcastleton forest, which is also home to one of Scotland’s renowned
7Stanes mountain biking centres

It’s hard to imagine a more romantic spot to hole up for a couple of days than 
a wooden boathouse on the edge of a Scottish loch. So popular has their first 
boathouse, Dipper, proved, that the owners of this beautiful 50-acre farm on 
the banks of Loch Tay have built a second one,Otter, which still has good 
availability for this summer. Like its sister property, Otter is a bright and 
airy open-plan love-nest, built on stilts at the edge of the water and 
decorated in Scandi-chic hues of white, grey and blue. Go skinny-dipping in the 
loch before warming up in front of the log-burner or star-gazing from your 
private deck.

When it comes to creative upcycling, a coal-fired hot tub fashioned from two 
disused digger buckets has to take the prize. This is just one of many 
“rustic-chic” treats atThe Hideaway, a new glamping retreat near Hay-on-Wye. 
The accommodation consists of two hand-crafted wooden huts in an ancient hay 
meadow. The first is your sleeping quarters, with a proper double bed, a 
wood-burning stove and a small kitchen. Outside is an enormous fire pit with 
large benches around it, from which to toast marshmallows. The second hut has a 
wet-room style shower with wood-burning stove and a hot tub positioned for the 
best mountain views.

A 300-year-old thatched cottage, 3 Whitewalls is small but perfectly formed. 
With low-beamed ceilings and stone fireplace, it’s super cosy, but the stylish 
furnishings keep things from straying into the twee zone and the details – 
White Company bed linen, Vi-Spring mattress, Roberts radio, ROK coffee machine 
and Molton Brown toiletries – are five-star. It’s questionable you’ll want to 
leave this retreat for long, but the location couldn’t be better: in the 
picturesque village of Mithian and just a minute’s walk from an inviting 
16th-century inn and 20 minutes from the nearest beach, at Trevellas Porth.

If your idea of fun is frolicking in ancient woodlands and wild swimming, look 
no further than theIdaho Cabin. The latest glamping option at Forest Garden 
(there are also two yurts) this log cabin blends seamlessly into the forest. 
It’s completely off-grid, so you’ll have to light your own fire in the evening 
and dine by candlelight. Owners Lisa and Charles are on hand to show the basics 
of firelighting, and if you’re feeling more ambitious they can teach you how to 
sculpt a bowl in one of their green woodworking courses, forage for mushrooms, 
or make your own lip balm from beeswax. Fall asleep to the soundtrack of owls 
hooting.

Eccentric, opulent and ever so English, riverside Blenheim Cottage, on the 
Blenheim Palace Estate, makes for a classy country getaway. It’s shaded by oaks 
and horse chestnuts and fronted by lawns sloping down to the Glyme river, while 
inside, the decor is dark and decadent – chandeliers, floor-length silk 
curtains, Zoffany wallpapers, open fires and a burgundy slipper bath. There’s a 
summerhouse in the garden and an honesty larder well-stocked with goodies. 
Guests can explore the birthplace of Winston Churchill and its manicured 
grounds then venture into Woodstock or Oxford. In the evening, the cottage 
offers a sense of privileged seclusion. Massages, a private chef or a picnic 
hamper can all be arranged.

Most shepherds would be gobsmacked at the luxury of this “shepherd’s hut” 
overlooking a lake in deepest Devon. A private hot tub, underfloor heating, hot 
showers, luxury bed linen and Wi-Fi are just some of the home comforts for 
guests checking intoShepherd’s Bliss, one of two new bijou glamping options on 
this family-run farm near Tiverton. Each hut has fire pit and barbecue, and of 
course, the hot tub so you can watch herons settling on the lake or buzzards 
circling overhead while you soak. It feels as though it’s in the middle of 
nowhere but the market towns of Tiverton and Crediton are a short drive away.

Surrounded by dramatic scenery, Wheeldon Trees Farm offers nine cheerful and 
homely cottages converted from an old dairy barn. The owners have gone to great 
lengths to make the place family- and dog-friendly: facilities include a 
communal dining and games room with pool table, table football, books, guides 
and DVDs. There are some great walks in the area, including the 17-mile High 
Peak trail. Your nearest pub is theQuiet Woman <http://quietwoman.com/>, a mile 
away in Earl Sterndale. It’s a proper old-fashioned local with coal fire, 
quarry tiles, a family room with pool, skittles and darts, and a menu that 
begins and ends with pork pies. For more sophisticated food, the Royal Oak and 
Packhorse Inn are also within walking distance.

The Applecross peninsula is reached via a dramatic mountain pass with hairpin 
bends and steep drops to test the nerves of the steadiest driver, but it’s 
worth the trip.Tigh-A-Chreagan (it means house on the rocks) is a newly 
refurbished croft cottage in an elevated position, four miles from the village 
of Applecross. It’s been kitted out with flair and vintage charm, with 
woodburning stoves and two cosy panelled bedrooms under the eaves. The cottage 
is new to Unique Cottages so still has decent availability for this summer. 
Stretch your legs with a hike to theApplecross Inn 
<http://www.applecross.uk.com/inn/>, three miles away. Hikers and climbers 
congregate in the friendly bar and the restaurant is famed for its fresh 
seafood and game.

Dating from the 15th century, Malt Cottage, in the riverside village of 
Nayland, was recently restored to its former splendour by an artisan builder

floors are softened by Persian rugs, tapestries and French antiques, and 
there’s a beautiful sunny garden for relaxing in. If you can tear yourself 
away, theAnchor Inn <http://www.anchornayland.co.uk/>, five minutes’ walk away, 
is a great pub on the banks of the Stour, with its own smokehouse and locally

A sweet little cottage for two in Norton St Phillip, Springfield Cottage packs 
a big punch when it comes to charm and character. White walls, wooden floors, a 
wood-burning stove and an original bread oven make for a homely and relaxing 
retreat. The village was once an important centre for the wool trade and has 
many beautiful 18th-century buildings and two pubs. The 700-year-oldGeorge Inn 
<http://www.georgeinnnsp.co.uk/home>, thought to be one of the oldest in the 
country, has oak beams, a galleried courtyard and a menu of traditional British 
dishes, including slow-cooked shin of beef in stout and sticky toffee pudding.

The market town of Middleham is famous for horseracing. Stay in mellow stone 
Castle Hill Cottage in the town centre and you may hear them clip-clopping 
across the cobbles as they make their way to the gallops each morning. This 
characterful cottage – flagstone floors, oak beams, huge fireplace, stylish 
contemporary furnishings – makes a great base for those who don’t want to rely 
on their car. The impressive Norman castle and attractive market square are a 
few minutes’ walk away, as are Middleham’s atmospheric hostelries, including 
the 300-year-oldRichard III <http://richard111hotel.com/>, which serves local 
ales and hearty portions of home-cooked food.

For anyone keen on fishing, or just kicking back by the water, Riverside Lodge
, on a lake next to the Avon, one of the UK’s best coarse fishing rivers, is 
perfect. New last autumn, the cedar-clad, two-bedroom, two-bathroom lodge has a 
veranda over the water and fishing rights. It’s also a great location for 
birdwatching and walks in the New Forest, and the pubs and restaurants of 
Fordingbridge are a mile away. Because of the proximity to the river and to 
free-roaming deer and other wildlife, it’s not suitable for small children or 
dogs.

terns, and diving gannets), it’s great for outdoor activities and for watching 
shooting stars and meteor showers.

Newly renovated, two-bedroom Glen Cottage on the Dunskey Estate pairs antique 
washstands, gilt-framed prints and painted tongue-and-groove panelling with G 
Plan sideboards and 1960s-style lamps (though the truly hip will need to shield 
their sensitive eyes from the ugly laminate kitchen). There’s loads to do, from 
a night photography course to a family-friendly rocket-making workshop with one 
of the Dark Sky Park rangers at Galloway Forest Park (gsabiosphere.org.uk 
<http://www.gsabiosphere.org.uk/explore-the-biosphere/biosphere-dark-sky-rangers/>

lemon tart at Dunskey’s organic cafe. There are other cottages on the site for 
larger groups.

One for art lovers, Godney Arts House is a traditional three-bedroom cottage 
that has been turned into a stylish bolthole with flagstone floors, retro 
furniture (think copper-top dining table and velvet sofas) and interesting 
artwork throughout. The award-winningSheppey Inn <http://thesheppey.co.uk/> is 
a few minutes away and there are lots of great walks – theWesthay Moor national 
nature reserve <http://www.somersetwildlife.org/westhay_moor.html> (where up to 
eight million starlings take refuge in reed beds) is one of several in the area 
and theSomerset Levels and Glastonbury Tor are on the doorstep
