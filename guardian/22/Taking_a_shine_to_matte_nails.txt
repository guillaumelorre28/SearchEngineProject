Typically, this time of year calls for bright nails, pinks, jazzy fluorescents 
to complement the sprouting greens underfoot. But what fashion likes to do is 
screw with expectations a little bit. Hence these matte nudes, as seen at 
Alexander Wang. The key is the matte-ness, which dampens all hint of gloss and 
sunshine from the varnish, leaving the hands looking elegant but 
mannequin-like, and leaving you more than ready for another rained-off weekend.
