dvdvns  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1787161>wonders about future 
generations:

I am a parent to an amazing son, now almost 2 yrs old, and I genuinely fear 
for his future. What do you think are the most important lessons that we can 
teach the next generation of activists and socially conscious members of 
society, when it seems protest is becoming weaker and weaker with each passing 
year, in favour of indifference and consumerism as distraction?

Well at least as of today he won't be playing with Shell-branded Lego! A 
little bit of good news. The most important thing we can teach protect in our 
kids is the deep love of nature with which they are all born.

miked453 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1438920> would like to get 
people talking:

My question is about breaking what I see a conspiracy of silence amongst most 
people who pretend this isn’t happening. It’s simply not talked about. I 
deliberately try to engage my friends and family on climate change but, as soon 
as I do, I can feel people bristle with anxiety or tension that I’ve brought it 
up. It’s as if it’s a taboo. How do you get people to talk about this and break 
through this collective denial about a real and immediate threat to us all?

Keep doing what you are doing. And also writer letters to local media asking 
that climate change stay on the front pages and that links be made with extreme 
weather when the science is clear - that'll help a bit. But as climate change 
hits us all harder, the denial will unfortunately drop away.

emotional side of climate change:

You mentioned at the end of your Guardian Live event quickly that we need to 
address the emotional side of climate change and address the reality of our own 
personal transformation and expressing that grief. Could you elaborate on this? 
Thanks!

It's a tough place to elaborate. But look up inner transition linked to the 
transition town movement. And also the anthology edited by Sally Weintrobe.

like to know about re-investment:

During your talk, you mentioned the importance of not just DIVESTMENT, but 
also ofRE-INVESTMENT of funds removed from fossil fuels into renewable energy, 
mass transit and other assets which benefit local communities not corporations.

Can you sign-post any visionary work being done to improve divestment, 
reinvestment pathways for finance...

For a sense of the kinds of projects that I think need special attention for 
investment, take a look at the fantastic Hour Pour campaign. These are 
frontline communities that need support to switch to a clean economy. There's 
also some very good work being done led by a handful of foundations called 
divestinvest.org.

"We need to liberate the art world from its addiction to Fossil Fuel cash"

Charlene Sharp <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13877147> asks:

I wondered in what ways you think the arts could help to continue your fight 
for awareness and activism - e.g literature, film etc. Many writers dipping 
their toe into the campaign but seem to focus on inciting small elements of 
reform environmentalism. How do you suggest they could/should go beyond this?

One of the most remarkable things about the People's Climate March in NY was 
the central role played by artists in creating unforgettable imagery, and 
making art in a beautiful and participatory way that many people said changed 
their lives. It was the best part of it. Locally, we also need to liberate the 
art world from it's addiction to Fossil Fuel cash. So check out Liberate Tate.

Yes. It's called This Changes Everything and it's about how the good guys can 
win.

lordaarons <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10119827> looks to Paul 
Krugmans’ NYT article:

What do you make of Paul Krugmans recent swipe in the NYT - “Environmental 
pessimism makes strange bedfellows. We seem to be having a moment in which 
three groups with very different agendas — anti-environmentalist conservatives, 
anti-capitalist people on the left, and hard scientists who think they are 
smarter than economists — have formed an unholy alliance on behalf of the 
proposition that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is incompatible with growing 
real GDP.”

With all respect to Krugman, he is not grappling with the real emission 
reduction numbers. I lay this out in the book, but Dave Roberts at Grist has 
just done a stellar job of laying out exactly what Krugman is missing. Do read 
it:

I think this is a myth. Voters want action on climate change, though they 
don't like policies that force working people to pay the entire bill while 
letting multi-national polluters off the hook. It's interesting to me that 
after years of backsliding and broken election promises, all the major 
political parties in the UK are trying to frantically shore up their green 
credentials ahead of the election. If voters didn't care, why would they do 
that? It's what happens between elections behind closed doors that we need to 
worry about.

"I owe Radiohead big-time!"

Eamon Sweeney  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10493117>asks about 
popular culture: 

Like many others, I bought ‘No Logo’ on the recommendation of Radiohead. What 
did their support mean to you? Are there any other bands/artists in more recent 
times whose political stance and activism you find admirable? What do you think 
of the current state of popular culture?

I owe Radiohead big-time! And still admire the band's continued commitment to 
transformative political change, including on climate change. I've been really 
lucky to work with some amazing artists in different capacities including my 
first film, The Take, directed by my husband Avi Lewis. That film had music 
from the Gotan Project and Llasa, who we still miss so much. Lately I worked 
with the hip hop caucus for the New York launch of This Changes Everything, 
they just produced an album times with the climate march - you should check it 
out! My personal heroes include Tom Morello, The Coup and of course your own 
Billy Bragg.

DanHolloway <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3703160> would like to 
know about staying angry:

We’re pretty much the same age, and I remember as an idealistic graduate 
student, I loved No Logo. One of the things that’s so inspiring about your work 
is that you have stayed angry, which is something very few people manage. Why 
do you think people find that so hard, and how have you managed it?

I do still get angry at injustice. I think it's one of the signs of still 
having hope. I know I'm depressed when I can't get angry anymore - which does 
happen. That said, I think this book is less angry than The Shock Doctrine. And 
I wrote it more out of love than rage.

The easy to get stuff is starting to run low. The problem is there are huge 
amounts of the harder to get "extreme" forms of fossil fuels like tar sands oil 
and shale gas. For this reason, I think the peak oil obsession distracts us 
from the much more important fact that we have too much, not too little, fossil 
fuel.

I believe strongly in polluters paying for the clean up, It seems to me that 
such a scenario is considerably less likely in the case of the oil 
corporations, as there is little chance of there coming to light the kind of 
smoking gun that nailed big tobacco. The complexities of the science behind 
global warming are just too great and too diverse. Do you have any further 
thoughts on this?

I think that this doesn't need to be won in court, as it was with the tobacco 
companies. It can be won in the court of public opinion, as is already 
happening with the growing numbers of public interest institutions divesting 
from fossil fuel stocks. Fossil fuel brand are becoming toxic. That brings us a 
significant step closer to demanding that governments take a much larger share 
of their profits to pay for the transition away from fossil fuels. It doesn't 
need to be a court settlement - though that would be nice!

hiddenpalette <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2449859> wonders about 
climate change deniers:

Given that there is data showing that there have been consistently increasing 
average global temperature and a dramatic increase in stand-out/abnormal 
weather events over the past 200 years, which seem to be growing more intense 
over the past 10-25 years especially, it is clear the climate is going through 
serious and drastic changes, but it seems the small shred of hope the climate 
deniers are holding on to is that as far as I understand it there has not been 
any unequivocal scientific proof that the increase of fossil fuels being 
released into the atmosphere has led to all these environmental events, despite 
the fact that all the logic and data would overwhelmingly conclude that the two 
are connected. And they cling on to the fact that as it is believed the world 
has gone through similar cycles in the distant past, perhaps not over such a 
short period, but that we are just in the midst of another one of those cycles.

All I’m trying to get at is that, is there not any laboratory-based examples 
where we can take atmospheric readings throughout the atmosphere on a daily 
basis and clearly show how the amount of trapped gases are drastically 
increasing and being trapped by the minute and then equate this to experiments 
that mirror these effects to a very similar degree under laboratory conditions 
to show to the world in a way that leaves no room for the climate change 
deniers to manoeuvre out of, and once the global population as such proof, 
maybe they will finally accept that this is a real situation.

I can’t help but feel, that small 0.1-5% of doubt in peoples minds that we 
really are responsible for this is enough to put people off from taking the 
necessary action. The changes you have outlined in the book need to be put into 
place, and I think people will only get on board is if they have 100% proof 
that the fossil fuel / mass agricultural farming industries are directly 
responsible. And at the moment to me it seems like the two are connected mainly 
by logic, in terms rather than hardcore, undeniable proof. If nothing else 
please can you point me and the other readers in the direction of the best and 
most thorough scientific papers to get a very sound understanding of how it is 
all connected, how it has changed over the past 10-25 years and where we are 
currently headed.

I don't think time should be wasted trying to convince hardcore deniers. We 
should spend our energy instead engaging with the huge numbers of people who do 
not deny climate change, yet see no way out of the crisis.

It's not about making the super-rich care - many care on an individual level - 
they are trapped within a system that actively discourages acting based on 
that, while encouraging and rewarding the most destructive behaviour. This 
discussion should be depersonalised and we should focus on the system.

wjk7 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4333439> asks about population 
growth:

Having read No Logo and Shock Doctrine I would now like to ask you why 
population growth doesn’t seem to figure in your concerns.I believe it to be of 
paramount importance if we are to overcome the many challenges now facing the 
world.For too long it has been dismissed by lefties,free market 
warriors,religious bodies and politicians with an eye on the main 
chance.Experts like Jane Goodall,Richard Attenborough and many others are 
dismissed and ignored while we see mounting protests against climate change and 
the neo-liberalism.How do we make the case for a coherent population policy as 
an integral part of the growing campaign for a viable and fairer future?The 
world’s non-human residents have no voice of their own and ever more are faced 
with imminent extinction.The buck stops with us.

I think we sometimes have a tendency to switch the topic to population because 
it's easier to think about controlling poor people's procreation that rich 
people's consumption. I'm not saying population doesn't matter. But high 
consumption lifestyles are driving the emissions boom, not population growth.

I do agree that it's a critical first step, particularly in the US. It's also 
a way to bring together a broad coalition of progressive interests, who are all

My question is about breaking what I see a conspiracy of silence amongst most

deliberately try to engage my friends and family on climate change but, as soon 
as I do, I can feel people bristle with anxiety or tension that I’ve brought it 
up. It’s as if it’s a taboo. How do you get people to talk about this and break

Keep doing what you are doing. And also writer letters to local media asking 
that climate change stay on the front pages and that links be made with extreme 
weather when the science is clear - that'll help a bit. But as climate change 
hits us all harder, the denial will unfortunately drop away.

You mentioned at the end of your Guardian Live event quickly that we need to 
address the emotional side of climate change and address the reality of our own 
personal transformation and expressing that grief. Could you elaborate on this? 
Thanks!

It's a tough place to elaborate. But look up inner transition linked to the 
transition town movement. And also the anthology edited by Sally Weintrobe.
 
JoelMoveYourMoney <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11467978> would 
like to know about re-investment:

During your talk, you mentioned the importance of not just DIVESTMENT, but 
also ofRE-INVESTMENT of funds removed from fossil fuels into renewable energy, 
mass transit and other assets which benefit local communities not corporations.

Can you sign-post any visionary work being done to improve divestment, 
reinvestment pathways for finance...

For a sense of the kinds of projects that I think need special attention for 
investment, take a look at the fantastic Hour Pour campaign. These are 
frontline communities that need support to switch to a clean economy. There's 
also some very good work being done led by a handful of foundations called 
divestinvest.org.

I wondered in what ways you think the arts could help to continue your fight 
for awareness and activism - e.g literature, film etc. Many writers dipping 
their toe into the campaign but seem to focus on inciting small elements of 
reform environmentalism. How do you suggest they could/should go beyond this?

One of the most remarkable things about the People's Climate March in NY was 
the central role played by artists in creating unforgettable imagery, and 
making art in a beautiful and participatory way that many people said changed 
their lives. It was the best part of it. Locally, we also need to liberate the 
art world from it's addiction to Fossil Fuel cash. So check out Liberate Tate.

Krugmans’ NYT article:

What do you make of Paul Krugmans recent swipe in the NYT - “Environmental 
pessimism makes strange bedfellows. We seem to be having a moment in which 
three groups with very different agendas — anti-environmentalist conservatives, 
anti-capitalist people on the left, and hard scientists who think they are 
smarter than economists — have formed an unholy alliance on behalf of the 
proposition that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is incompatible with growing 
real GDP.”

With all respect to Krugman, he is not grappling with the real emission

just done a stellar job of laying out exactly what Krugman is missing. Do read

I think this is a myth. Voters want action on climate change, though they 
don't like policies that force working people to pay the entire bill while 
letting multi-national polluters off the hook. It's interesting to me that 
after years of backsliding and broken election promises, all the major 
political parties in the UK are trying to frantically shore up their green 
credentials ahead of the election. If voters didn't care, why would they do 
that? It's what happens between elections behind closed doors that we need to 
worry about.

I owe Radiohead big-time! And still admire the band's continued commitment to 
transformative political change, including on climate change. I've been really 
lucky to work with some amazing artists in different capacities including my 
first film, The Take, directed by my husband Avi Lewis. That film had music 
from the Gotan Project and Llasa, who we still miss so much. Lately I worked 
with the hip hop caucus for the New York launch of This Changes Everything, 
they just produced an album times with the climate march - you should check it 
out! My personal heroes include Tom Morello, The Coup and of course your own 
Billy Bragg.

We’re pretty much the same age, and I remember as an idealistic graduate

I do still get angry at injustice. I think it's one of the signs of still

happen. That said, I think this book is less angry than The Shock Doctrine. And 
I wrote it more out of love than rage.

The easy to get stuff is starting to run low. The problem is there are huge 
amounts of the harder to get "extreme" forms of fossil fuels like tar sands oil 
and shale gas. For this reason, I think the peak oil obsession distracts us 
from the much more important fact that we have too much, not too little, fossil 
fuel.
 
frangin <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1138187> asks:

You said last night that the oil industry would follow in the footsteps of the 
the tobacco industry in having to pay compensation for continuing to extract 
and pollute while being fully aware of the consequences of their actions. While 
I believe strongly in polluters paying for the clean up, It seems to me that 
such a scenario is considerably less likely in the case of the oil 
corporations, as there is little chance of there coming to light the kind of 
smoking gun that nailed big tobacco. The complexities of the science behind 
global warming are just too great and too diverse. Do you have any further 
thoughts on this?

I think that this doesn't need to be won in court, as it was with the tobacco 
companies. It can be won in the court of public opinion, as is already 
happening with the growing numbers of public interest institutions divesting 
from fossil fuel stocks. Fossil fuel brand are becoming toxic. That brings us a 
significant step closer to demanding that governments take a much larger share 
of their profits to pay for the transition away from fossil fuels. It doesn't 
need to be a court settlement - though that would be nice!
 
hiddenpalette <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2449859> wonders about 
climate change deniers:

Given that there is data showing that there have been consistently increasing 
average global temperature and a dramatic increase in stand-out/abnormal 
weather events over the past 200 years, which seem to be growing more intense 
over the past 10-25 years especially, it is clear the climate is going through 
serious and drastic changes, but it seems the small shred of hope the climate 
deniers are holding on to is that as far as I understand it there has not been 
any unequivocal scientific proof that the increase of fossil fuels being 
released into the atmosphere has led to all these environmental events, despite 
the fact that all the logic and data would overwhelmingly conclude that the two 
are connected. And they cling on to the fact that as it is believed the world 
has gone through similar cycles in the distant past, perhaps not over such a 
short period, but that we are just in the midst of another one of those cycles.

All I’m trying to get at is that, is there not any laboratory-based examples 
where we can take atmospheric readings throughout the atmosphere on a daily 
basis and clearly show how the amount of trapped gases are drastically 
increasing and being trapped by the minute and then equate this to experiments 
that mirror these effects to a very similar degree under laboratory conditions 
to show to the world in a way that leaves no room for the climate change 
deniers to manoeuvre out of, and once the global population as such proof, 
maybe they will finally accept that this is a real situation.

I can’t help but feel, that small 0.1-5% of doubt in peoples minds that we 
really are responsible for this is enough to put people off from taking the 
necessary action. The changes you have outlined in the book need to be put into 
place, and I think people will only get on board is if they have 100% proof 
that the fossil fuel / mass agricultural farming industries are directly 
responsible. And at the moment to me it seems like the two are connected mainly 
by logic, in terms rather than hardcore, undeniable proof. If nothing else 
please can you point me and the other readers in the direction of the best and 
most thorough scientific papers to get a very sound understanding of how it is 
all connected, how it has changed over the past 10-25 years and where we are 
currently headed.

I don't think time should be wasted trying to convince hardcore deniers. We

not deny climate change, yet see no way out of the crisis.

It's not about making the super-rich care - many care on an individual level - 
they are trapped within a system that actively discourages acting based on 
that, while encouraging and rewarding the most destructive behaviour. This

I think we sometimes have a tendency to switch the topic to population because 
it's easier to think about controlling poor people's procreation that rich 
people's consumption. I'm not saying population doesn't matter. But high 
consumption lifestyles are driving the emissions boom, not population growth.
