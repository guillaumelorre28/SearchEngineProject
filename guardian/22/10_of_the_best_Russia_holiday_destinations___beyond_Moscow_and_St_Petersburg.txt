Ruskeala, Karelia

Why go?
Karelia, a republic in north-west Russia, is known as one the country’s most 
beautiful places. The nature here is breathtaking and more Finnish than 
Russian, with lakes, waterfalls and trees growing on giant rocks. Ruskeala is a 
village close to Sortavala, one of the region’s bigger towns. The main interest 
here is Ruskeala mountain park, with a marble canyon that is now a lake with 
crystal clear water, and another underground lake. You can rent boats, go 
diving, or hike. In summer there are light shows on the lake.

Where to stay?
Since Ruskeala is tiny most tourists stay in Sortavala. Hostel Lämpö 
<http://www.lampohostel.ru/index.php/en/> is a popular choice. Don’t be put off 
by the shabby pre-Soviet building: it is renovated inside and the location is 
excellent. If you’re staying for a while, there are several resorts, such as
Hotel Piipun Piha 
<http://www.booking.com/hotel/ru/piipun-piha-sortavala.fi.html>, near the lake, 
slightly further from the town centre, which offer sauna and barbecue 
facilities, too.
• Doubles from £34, dorms from £6

How to get there?
Take the train from Ladozhsky railway station in St Petersburg to Sortavala; 
depending on the train the journey will take about 4-5 hours. From there 
several buses can take you to Ruskeala, or you can book a taxi – the drive will 
take about 20 minutes.

Why go?
On the north-western spurs of the eastern Sayan mountains, the Stolby nature 
reserve is one of the most popular tourism destinations in Siberia. The 
reserve’s main attraction are its rocks and cliffs, called stolby, “pillars” in 
Russian, after their shape. The smallest cliffs are 55 meters high, while the 
highest go up to 600 metres. Rock-climbing and hiking are popular activities, 
although for those interested in the local flora and fauna the reserve also 
offers guided tours of the Siberian fir taiga that sprawls underneath the 
rocks: a mix of a hike and a botanical and zoological tour.

Where to stay? 
In the wooden cabins on the reserve’s grounds, surrounded by the taiga and the 
rocks. There are separate small cottages for six and eight people, and a 
hostel. The cabins area is called ‘the village’ and is a bit of a hike from the 
reserve’s main reception buildings but there is a car service for when you 
first arrive with your luggage.
• Dorms from £5 a night, six-person cottages from £47, zapovednik-stolby.ru 
<http://zapovednik-stolby.ru/service/>

How to get there?
Fly to Krasnoyarsk from Moscow or St Petersburg (about five hours) and get to 
Stolby on a bus or taxi; that journey will take around 11/2 hours.

Why go?
Velikiy Novgorod, also known as Novgorod the Great, is one of the most 
important cities in the country, often called the “birthplace of Russia”. For a 
long time the city was a sovereign principality, founded by merchants and ruled 
in relative democracy, and the unification of Novgorod with Moscow in the 15th 
century was an essential step towards a unified Russia. The city is an historic 
one and the traditional wooden architecture museum ofVitoslavlitsi 
<http://visitnovgorod.com/sights/museum_wooden_architecture_vitoslavlitsy.html> 
is a must-visit; the open-air exhibition of Russian izbas (farmhouses) has an 
ancient tradition of building without nails or metal to hold the wooden planks 
together. The Kremlin fortress in Novgorod is also one of the oldest in Russia, 
dating back to the 11th century.

 View from the Kremlin fortress in Kazan. Photograph: Alamy 
Why go?
The city of Kazan, in Tatarstan, is over a thousand years old and has always 
been an eclectic place, balanced between the Russian Orthodox and Muslim 
cultures with churches and cathedrals neighbouring mosques. One of the city’s 
landmarks is the Söyembikä Tower in the Kremlin fortress. It’s named after the 
city’s last queen, Söyembikä, who, according to legend threw herself off the 
tower, but actually was captured by the Muscovites led by Ivan the Terrible in 
the 16th century, when the city was conquered. The eclectic food of the region, 
a mix of Russian and Tatar, is one of the city’s highlights: try the 
traditional tea withchuk-chuk, a sweet pastry dish.

Where to stay? 
Stereo Hostel <http://stereo-hostel.hotels-kazan.ru/en/> in the city centre 
has a 1970s sci-fi bachelor pad vibe – and a bar onsite. If you’re looking for 
a quieter stay, theStary Gorod Hotel 
<http://stary-gorod-hotel.hotels-kazan.ru/en/> (Old Town Hotel) is an 
affordable retreat in the city centre, with views of the historic Märcani 
Mosque.

Why go?
Lake Baikal is the deepest in the world. Many Russians say that seeing the 
vast “Siberian sea” is a unique experience, and others tell stories of the 
Baikal monster, echoing tales of the Loch Ness monster. There are several 
hiking paths and in the summer you can swim in the lake, although the water is 
cold even in August. The shores are scattered with resorts, hotels and camping 
grounds, although many of them are of the Soviet times.

Where to stay? 
The Lagoon Ranch resort <http://www.baikallaguna.ru/index.php> is on the 
western bank of the Baikal, in the area called the Small Sea, and offers 
several types of accommodation: from the most affordable two-person summer 
houses to double rooms and separate cabins. There are stables and a 
horse-riding arena, sports grounds, Russian sauna and Baikal tour guide 
services available.
• Two-person summer houses from £20, doubles from £28, cabins from £37

How to get there?

Why go? 
A tiny piece of Russia in Europe, Kaliningrad used to be called Königsberg, 
and the architecture in the city’s old town still points towards Europe and not 
Russia. Traces of Kaliningrad’s German heritage can be seen in the surviving 
Brandenburg Gate and the Fishing Village, a tourist attraction with recreated 
medieval-style buildings. The flea markets here are known to be the best in 
Russia – many collectors from all over the world come here in hope of finding 
relics from the second world war. TheAmber museum 
<http://www.ambermuseum.ru/en/> is another popular attraction.

Where to stay?
The city centre Utro Hostel <http://hostelutro.ru/> is housed in a 19th 
century building, with minimalist design and big windows, and the city’s lowest 
prices per bunk-bed.

Why go? 
Far east is a dream destination for many Russians, and Vladivostok, at the 
head of the Golden Horn Bay, is the heart of it. The city was founded in the 
middle of the 19th century. The best place for views is the Eagle’s Nest Hill, 
the city centre’s highest point. This is also a food destination as seafood is 
abundant here and because of the proximity to the Russian-Chinese borders it’s 
almost the only place in Russia where good Chinese food is widely available.

Where to stay?
The Teplo Hotel <http://teplo-hotel.ru/en/> is close to the railway station, 
for all those Trans-Siberian railway travellers, and has dormitories and 
private rooms. Slightly more expensive isA Hotel Amur Bay 
<http://en.azimuthotels.com/russia/vladivostok/a_hotel_amur_bay>, which is in a 
white 1980s-designed building. Although a chain hotel (of the Azimut brand), 
it’s worth the price for the amazing sea views of the Golden Horn and Amur bays.
• Dorms at the Teplo Hotel from £6, doubles at A Hotel Amur Bay from £24

How to get there? 
Direct eight-hour flights to Vladivostok from Moscow. Vladivostok is also the 
eastern terminus of theTrans-Siberian railway <http://www.trans-siberian.co.uk/>
. Trains leave from Moscow’s Yaroslavskiy railway station – the journey will 
take six days.
