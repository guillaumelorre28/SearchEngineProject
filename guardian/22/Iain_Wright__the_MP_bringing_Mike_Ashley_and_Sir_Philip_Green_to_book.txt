“Do I have to have a beer with either of them?” asks Iain Wright, the chairman 
of the Commons’ business select committee, when quizzed about which, of the two 
billionaires he interrogated during 2016, he would choose to meet for a 
Christmas pint.

“Do you know what? I think Mike Ashley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/mike-ashley> would like a pint more than 
[Sir] Philip Green,” the Labour MP for Hartlepool says. “I don’t think Philip 
Green would want a pint. I think he’d probably want an extraordinarily 
expensive bottle of champagne ... and then he’d get me to pay for it.”

The quote just about sums up the year Wright has experienced at the centre of 
two separate scandals that engulfed a pair of Britain’s best known and 
wealthiest retailers.

There are parts of his statement that appear conciliatory, but then plenty 
more that would irk both tycoons who, according to Wright, have come to 
encapsulate the corporate excess that may have contributed to the country 
voting to leave the European Union.

Ashley was hauled in front of Wright’s business committee over working 
conditions at his sportswear chain Sports Direct, in the wake of a Guardian 
investigation that showed the company’swarehouse workers were being paid less 
than the national minimum wage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay>
. Business people have been dragged in front of MPs for much less, yet Ashley’s 
appearance did not happen without a fight.

The billionaire owner of Newcastle United football club initially refused to 
attend, despite Wright’s committee taking the unusual step of issuing him with 
a formal summons and then threatening to find him in contempt of parliament – 
an ancient offence which theoretically is punishable by imprisonment.

But parliament’s powers are so archaic that they may no longer be practically 
enforceable, meaning it was always unclear what could be done to Ashley if he 
failed to show – a move that would have put the whole select committee system 
on trial. At that moment, there must have been a lot of pressure on Wright?

“I didn’t feel any pressure at all,” he claims. “Maybe I should have. I felt 
it was a point of principle. Nobody’s bigger than parliament – I felt so 
strongly about that and I was keen to go to the wire ... You don’t refuse to 
come to a select committee – you just don’t.

“If necessary I would have been pushing to change the law to make sure it was 
a legal requirement to attend,” Wright adds. “You’ve seen with the likes of 
Margaret Hodge [the former chair of the public accounts committee] ... 
fantastic work [has been done by] the select committee. And all of that could 
have been put under threat if people think they don’t have to go.”


In the end, Ashley not only backed down but also made a string of admissions 
under the committee’s questioning, including acknowledging that Sports Direct 
had broken the law by not paying the minimum wage and confessing that he is 
struggling to control the company he founded and in which he still owns a 
majority stake.

 * Wright’s committee responded with a report accusing Ashley of running 
Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse>
 and building his success on a business model that treats workers “without 
dignity or respect”. A selection of the committee’s MPs then showed up at the 
firm’s controversial warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, for an impromptu 
inspection, which memorably ended with Wright accusing the company ofsecretly 
recording his group during a private meeting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/sports-direct-denies-knowledge-of-secret-camera-filming-mps-shirebrook-warehouse>
. 
 * 

 * “I’m still keen to work with him,” Wright insists. “I think the recording 
device suggests a real level of distrust.” 
 * 

 * The same might be said of the parliamentarian’s relationship with Green. 
The retail knight was questioned over the collapse of BHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/mps-sir-philip-greens-reputation-and-knighthood-depend-on-pension-offer>
 and the £571m shortfall in its pension fund by a joint parliamentary 
committee, made up of Wright’s committee plus the work and pensions committee, 
led by Frank Field. 
 * 

 * While Wright, a former accountant, pulls very few punches, there is still 
an obvious contrast in style with Field, the veteran Labour MP who went on 
radio tocompare Green with the pension plunderer Robert Maxwell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/mp-says-sir-philip-green-worse-than-robert-maxwell>
. Green was furious with Field – and remains so – and the MP’s lawyers 
apparently had to provide an assurance he had not meant to accuse Green of 
theft. 
 * 

 * But was the soundbite part of an agreed strategy, or did it come as a 
surprise to Wright? “He’d mentioned it privately to me, yeah,” Wright says. 
“He’ll understand what went on in the early 90s with Maxwell. I can see 
similarities in terms [of a ] corporate governance element. Frank’s entitled to 
say what he likes. There was an element of different styles, an element of 
different personalities coming to the fore, but we were definitely speaking all 
together.” 
 * 

 * If Wright was pleased with how his report on Sports Direct came out, he was 
even more proud of the BHS one co-written with Field, which found that the 
department store had been subjected to“systematic plunder” by former owners 
including Green 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report>
, who gave “insufficient priority” to the BHS pension scheme that slumped to a 
£571m deficit. 
 * 

 * Wright described the 60-page document as “my Sgt Pepper”. So, who was John 
and who was Paul? 
 * 

“One of the great thing about the Beatles – and you can hear it in Abbey Road 
particularly – is the harmonies and I think the way we harmonised together was 
really strong,” Wright says. “We worked as one team, we left our committee 
badges at the door, we left our party affiliation at the door and we just 
worked to see what on earth went wrong here and how we try to mitigate that.”

He eventually settles on Field as Lennon, while also lauding a pair of 
Conservative MPs – Jeremy Quin from the pensions committee and Richard Fuller 
from Wright’s own business committee – for their contributions.

Even so, the two inquiries have had different outcomes. While the Sports 
Direct saga eventually produced some benefit for the poorly paid workers, when 
the£1m backpay deal was unveiled in August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/sports-direct-staff-to-receive-back-pay-unite-hmrc>
, Wright still seems to view the company’s efforts as a work in progress.

Meanwhile, the BHS pension scandal rumbles on into 2017, with Green still 
promising to “sort” the deficit and the pension regulator launching formal 
legal proceedings in November against Green andDominic Chappell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/dominic-chappell>, the businessman he 
sold BHS to for £1.

Given the different outcomes, it would be good to know if Wright sees his 
Christmas pint glass as half empty or half full.
