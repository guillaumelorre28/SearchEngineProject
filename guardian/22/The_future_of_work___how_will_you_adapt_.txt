The way we work in the future will look vastly different to today’s landscape. 
Gone will be the daily commute to an office where people arrive with their 
coffees ready or the designated 38-hour week. Globally, experts predict that 
the workplaces of tomorrow will be more flexible, collaborative and mobile, 
where the majority of people work remotely on a freelance basis for multiple 
companies and are paid for work carried out for its value, rather than just 
hours.

In a presentation on ‘The Future of Work’ 
<http://www.slideshare.net/fpbrtrend/the-future-of-work-final-januarysm>, Faith 
Popcorn, US futurist and founder of marketing consulting firm BrainReserve, 
says that 33 per cent of Americans are currently freelancers and predicts that 
by 2020, that figure will rise to 50 per cent.

“We are entering a time of head-spinning, mind-bending upheaval,” she says. 
“Work, as we know it, is dying. Careers and offices: over. People [in the 
future] will be able to work anytime and any place as freelancers manage 
multiple jobs.”

Australia is showing similar trends. According to ‘Freelancing in Australia: A 
National Survey of the New Workforce’, which was published last year by Edelman 
Berland on behalf of online workplace Elance-oDesk, 30 per cent of Australians 
are already doing some form of freelance work. Of those, over half do so out of 
choice rather than necessity with the top drivers being the ability to earn 
extra money, increased flexibility and having the freedom to control their own 
destiny.

The study revealed that this figure is likely to rise, with a quarter of 
freelancers reporting an increased demand for their services in the past year. 
Of those surveyed, 59 percent said that technology made it easier to find 
freelance work, allowing people to work remotely and engage in a global 
marketplace. When asked about the future of the freelance job market, more than 
65 percent believe the best days are still ahead.

Meanwhile a 2014 report – ‘The Future of Work: A Journey to 2022’ – by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) canvassed 10,000 people in China, India, Germany, 
the UK and the US to give their views on the future of work and how it will 
affect their employment prospects and future working lives. Of those, 66 
percent see the future of work as a world full of possibility and believe they 
will be successful, while 55 per cent think technological breakthroughs will 
transform the way people work over the next five to 10 years.


The PwC report found that “new technologies, data analytics and social 
networks are having a huge impact on how people communicate, collaborate and 
work. As generations collide, workforces become more diverse and people work 
longer; traditional career models will soon be a thing of the past.”

Fiona Monfrooy, Executive Director of Human Resources at ING DIRECT Australia, 
says workplace change is already underway. With that change comes both 
challenges and opportunities.

“We are in a time of rapid change and the workforce landscape is shifting, now 
more than ever.” she says. “From an individual perspective, there’s an 
increasing need for transferrable skills; to be more adaptable. A flexible work 
approach also means, in some cases, multiple jobs.

“We’re also approaching a time when the workforce is potentially formed of 
five generations, all with different values, engagement preferences and 
experiences. A multi-generational workforce presents organisations with both 
challenges and opportunities: opportunities in terms of enhanced diversity, of 
thought and experience.

“We’re yet to see how they will engage with each other and the businesses, how 
to best manage a diverse workforce and the synergy of all five generations in 
the workplace at the same time. Another challenge for organisations is 
attracting talent, not only those with the right experience and skills but also 
the right mindset.

“In terms of opportunities, we’re seeing that workers are becoming more 
flexible, they’re more highly skilled, are more adaptable to a fast-changing 
business and able to move with it. On a personal level, those who are 
disruptors, people who challenge the status quo, are curious and have the 
courage to take it on and make it happen are the ones who will find the 
opportunities and be the most rewarded.”

From an individual perspective, there’s an increasing need for transferrable 
skills; to be more adaptable.

So what skills will we require and how do we prepare – as individuals and 
organisations – for an ever-evolving workplace?

According to ‘Future Inc’, a report by Deloitte Australia, harnessing 
diversity and global mobility will be increasingly important to business 
success, and that as individuals we will need to be “ready and willing” to 
adapt to changing circumstances and learn new skills.

Fiona agrees: “Business transformation is never-ending, so embracing change 
and learning to thrive in an ambiguous environment is an ongoing challenge for 
everyone. To be successful in an ambiguous environment, we need to make 
incremental changes in partnershipwith people instead of dictating change to 
people. It’s a journey that impacts all of us, so we all need to be on board. 
Change is the ‘new norm’ and we need to champion it as such.

“As individuals we need to be adaptable. We also need to have the ability to 
collaborate, influence and continually learn. It’s as much about mindset as it 
is about skills and experience.

“Likewise, organisations need to provide a workplace that is flexible and 
mobile. They need to create workplaces where people want to be, somewhere that 
stimulates their thinking and importantly allows them to work in the way they 
need to. That means having a workplace that’s not only a dynamic environment 
but one that encourages collaboration and supports flexibility.”

Technology also plays a critical role in the success of future workplaces. 
Already it facilitates a global workforce, eroding geographical boundaries and 
providing the ability to interact almost anywhere, anytime, blurring the lines 
between work and home life.

“Evolving technology means that all elements of our lives are intermingled,” 
Fiona says. “We take our lives to work, and likewise we work outside of work 
hours as well as inside – it’s fully versatile in my view. As a leader, I 
believe productivity should be measured by outcome. The way we live and work 
has evolved.”

Indeed, ‘Future Inc’ reveals that more waves of digital disruption are hitting 
Australian industries and that digitisation and technology are the biggest 
perceived drivers of occupational change in the next 10 years (along with 
changing consumer demand and globalisation). “As the pace of technological 
change continues to accelerate, unique opportunities, challenges and risks are 
introduced by digital disruption,” the report says.

While technology will lead to a reduction in some jobs – particularly in areas 
that can be automated – it will also create and provide new opportunities. 
‘Future Inc’ found that: “Given the rapid pace of technological change, it is 
apparent that technology will have the potential to create new jobs in areas 
that may not have been thought of previously...”. Many professions in place 
today (for example, machine learning specialists or cognitive computing 
engineers) specialise in areas that would not have been predicted ten years ago.

However, in this age of constantly advancing technology, Fiona says the human 
element can’t be underestimated: “Technology may evolve how we connect, however 
the way we establish our business relationships, manage our stakeholders or 
even network are distinctly human. Likewise, technology might make it easier to 
access education but it’s those who seek continuous improvement to ensure their 
skills are relevant that will stay ahead.”

Whatever industry you are in, success in the workplace of the future – for 
both employers and employees – will depend on our ability to harness and 
embrace the power of diversity and change.

And in a time of such rapid acceleration of technology, organisations that 
empower their people to employ these new tools and skills are the ones that 
will come out on top.
