Have we reached Stan Smith fatigue? Not likely. At fashion week, due to the 
sheer impossibility of the scheduling, they’ve become a fixture on the feet of 
the editors as they jog, perspiry, from frow to Pret to frow. Minimalist, neat 
and technology-free, they work with every look, and thanks to a bunch of new 
collaborations, are fashion-approved. To wit: this polka dot pair, as seen on 
the tootsies of Danyul Brown, stylist at Client magazine, which come from 
Pharrell Williams’ Polka Dot Pack capsule collection. The Raf Simons ones, 
which have an ‘R’ punched into the side, are also kosher. In a neat twist, the 
polka dots on Brown’s are made from the same felt used on tennis balls. You 
know, in case you’ve forgotten that they are actually sports shoes.
