Polignano a Mare, Italy


‘Cannier tourists wait for late summer and autumn’


“Don’t come in August.” That was the advice of a local when I discussed a 
return visit to Puglia, the heel of Italy. He has a point. In August – when 
Italians tend to take their summer holiday – the beaches and streets are 
heaving. Cannier tourists wait for late summer and autumn, when the sun still 
warms the skin, but there is far less skin about. However, there are enough 
visitors to ensure that everything’s open. The seas are still toasty, too, for 
those who like a dip. (And if Puglia fails to tempt you, the same holds true of 
Basilicata and Calabria, the other regions that make up the foot of Italy.)

For a city-based holiday, Lecce 
<http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/apulia/lecce.html> is a good choice, 
with its baroque architecture and Roman ruins, as isFoggia 
<http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/apulia/foggia.html>, if palaces and 
churches are your thing. Lecce’s historicPalazzo Gorgoni 
<http://www.palazzogorgoni.it/> (doubles from €90 B&B) is right in the centre. 
The famous medievalcittà bianche (white towns) of Ostuni, Locorotondo, 
Cisternino, Martina Franca and Ceglie Messapica offer a refreshing slice of 
Italy: they get busy, but mostly with Italian visitors. (Do drop into the 
cave-like bar/restaurantEvó Sapori di Vite  
<https://www.facebook.com/Ev%C3%B3-258556007664109/> if you’re in Ostuni.)

Postcard sellers do a much brisker trade in the Unesco-listed town of 
Alberobello, which boasts around 1,400trulli, the idiosyncratic conical houses 
for which Puglia is famous.

 Joya Canti di Stagione, Polignano a Mare 
However, my first choice would be the little seaside town of Polignano a Mare, 
a prepossessing place just made for quiet ambling and much-loved by Pugliesi 
themselves. I fell for it even before I’d seen the view for which it is best 
known: its beach in a narrow cove, with limestone cliffs topped by a jumble of 
ancient buildings. Searching for shade, I strolled the quiet stone-flagged back 
streets, where quotations from the great and the good have been daubed on 
sun-bleached doors.

Grab an ice-cream or a crepe at Joya Canti di Stagione 
<https://www.facebook.com/Joya-Canti-di-Stagione-yogurteria-frutteria-creperia-a-Polignano-a-Mare-1495770143990365/>
 on the corner of Via Gelso and Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, or have a healthy 
blow-out atMint <http://www.mintcucinafresca.com/> , where seasonal ingredients 
come from local farmers and fishermen. Afterwards, hit the sack atMalù 
<http://www.bebmalu.it/en/home/> (doubles from €70, bebmalu.it <http:>) or a 
little way out of town at the glorious pile that isSan Tommaso 
<http://www.hotelsantommaso.net/> (doubles from €75 B&B).

 Healthy food at Mint Cucina Fresca 
Polignano has a railway station, so day trips to the coastal cities of Trani 
or newly spruced-up Brindisi are simple and inexpensive, with sea views 
practically all the way. Indeed, the most glorious way to arrive in Polignano 
is by train via Paris and Milan (seeseat61.com 
<http://seat61.com/Italy.htm#Ancona>).
• Most visitors fly to either Bari (20 miles away) or Brindisi (60 miles)

On my last autumn visit to Symi, a 90-minute ferry ride from Rhodes Town, the 
only other British visitors on the island were Rick Stein and his television 
crew, shooting a cookery programme.

Symi’s amphitheatre-like harbour is a sun-trap, with its own microclimate. The 
sea is so warm you can swim until Christmas. Guaranteed sunshine isn’t the only 
reason this quietly glamorous Dodecanese island enjoys an unusually long 
season: the Archangel Michael Festival on 8 November each years attracts 
Orthodox Christian pilgrims from all over Greece to Panormitis monastery, in 
the uninhabited south-west of the island, which is such an important religious 
site that the ferry also stops there.

Symi is famous for its seafood, especially the tiny local shrimps, flash-fried 
and eaten whole. The best place to try them is Tholos (about €30 a head, +30 
22460 72033) at the tip of the horseshoe harbour. Do like Stein and tuck into 
unctuous octopus and fabulous taramasalata with a panorama of the prettiest 
port in Greece.

Neoclassical houses in shades of peach and apricot cling to the quay and climb 
up into the surrounding hills. Smack on the waterfront isHotel Aliki 
<http://www.symi-hotel-aliki.gr/> (doubles from €70 B&B), built in 1895. Its 15 
rooms (request a sea view) are furnished with family heirlooms.

 Yialos Port, Symi. Photograph: Jon Arnold Images/Alamy 
For an uplifting experience, it’s interesting to hike to one (or several) of 
the 100-odd monasteries in the hinterland, which is thick with cypress and pine 
forests. From Sotiris Megalos, perched on crags in the south-east, with an old 
winery and presses, to Agios Emilianos, on a rocky outcrop overlooking a limpid 
cove in the far west, their locations all inspire awe.

Most of Symi’s beaches are equally spectacular, and tantalisingly hard to 
reach, at least by car. Craggy footpaths and chugging water taxis take you to 
Nanou, a pebble beach with a tamarisk-shaded shack serving grilled just-caught 
fish, and Marathounta, where plucky goats will steal your leftovers at the 
excellent farm-to-tableTaverna Marathounta 
<https://www.facebook.com/taverna.marathounta> (about €25 a head). Cliff-backed 
Agios Georgios Disalonas on the east coast is accessible only by boat, and is 
best for a morning swim; the beach is in deep shade by mid-afternoon. It’s a 
shorter, gentler walk from the harbour to the waterfront hamlets of Nimborio to 
the west, and Pedi to the east.

As summer draws to a close, the scene moves up from the yacht-lined harbour, 
Yialos, to the upper town, Chorio. A little rougher around the edges, this 
jumble of crumbling houses is also home to the island’s oldest taverna, Georgio 
and Maria (+30 22460 71984; about €20 a head), where classic Greek dishes are 
served on a vine-covered terrace, often accompanied by live music.

To feel part of the local community, try a rented holiday home in Chorio 
throughSymi Visitor <http://www.symivisitor-accommodation.com/>. Options 
include a cosy medieval one-bedroom cottage,2 Fishes 
<http://www.symivisitor-accommodation.com/2fishes.htm> (from €115 plus tax), 
and, for the same price, two-bedroomPlesner House 
<http://www.symivisitor-accommodation.com/plesner.htm>, an elegant neoclassical 
house closer to the harbour, with many original features.

 Kitesurfing off Playa de los Lances, Tarifa. Photograph: Alamy 
Southern Spain’s city beaches are year-round urban playgrounds, but despite 
300 days of sun and daytime temperatures around 20C into December, vast swathes 
of the coast are deserted out of summer. Mainly this is a joy: hiking cliff 
paths is a wild and free business, and coastal forts are better without coach 
parties blocking the ramparts. But, irritatingly, several of the loveliest 
spots close down their beach shacks, seafood restaurants, some hotels and 
campsites, kayak rental stands and ice-cream parlours until Easter.

Tarifa, however – continental Europe’s most southerly town – is always lively 
because it’s windy: kitesurfers and windsurfers blow in all year round. The 
hotels and restaurants that remain open to accommodate them attract less active 
off-season beach-lovers too. In recent years, Tarifa has morphed from a funky 
party town to a funky party town with stylish accommodation and great eating, 
too. Most of the good stuff flanks the narrow cobbled streets and tiny plazas 
crammed inside the town’s thick (somewhat wind-proof) walls. There’s a real 
medina feel here, not surprising given the town was the first Arab foothold on 
the Iberian peninsula. It is still dominated by a solid Arab fort and Morocco 
is just 12 miles away across the Strait of Gibraltar (the ferry takes under an 
hour).

 Cafe Azul, for a late, great breakfast 
West from the ancient gates lies a stretch of fabulous beaches. Los Lances and 
Valdequeros are good for seeing kitesurfers in action. If you’re inspired, a 
couple of dozen companies offer half-day tasters or all-inclusive packages, 
plus equipment to hire or buy (start by googlingTantrum 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8ay_pyI-T4>, Rebels  
<http://www.rebelstarifa.com/>and Free Your Mind 
<https://www.facebook.com/fym.Tarifa>). If that’s not your bag, continue west 
to Bolonia, and explore its seaside Roman ruin, Baelo Claudia. These waters are 
packed with dolphins and whales and, until the end of October, there’s a fairly 
good chance of spotting them on a two-hour boat trip (adult €30,firmm.org 
<http://firmm.org/en/>).

Tarifa’s modus operandi is sleep late and eat late. Breakfast serves as lunch, 
and several cafes offer good ones. Try thebatidos (smoothies) and fruit, 
yoghurt and muesli combos atCafe Azul <https://www.facebook.com/cafeazultarifa/>
. While some restaurants close in October, there is still plenty of choice, 
such asVaca Loca <https://www.facebook.com/Vaca-Loca-Tarifa-465014273544267/>

For something more formal and fishy, there’s La Pescadería 
<http://lapescaderiatarifa.com/> (about €25 a head), while Restaurante 
Mandrágora <http://www.mandragoratarifa.com/> (about €25 a head) provides a 
taste of Morocco – lamb with plums and almonds, pastries stuffed with anchovies 
and aubergine,tabuli – without having to sail to Tangier.

The all-night club action simmers down in autumn, but there’s live music at 
veggie restaurant and social hubEcocenter 
<https://www.facebook.com/EcocenterTarifa> on Sundays and at the Almedina 
<http://www.almedinacafe.net/almedina/> flamenco cafe on Thursdays.

In contrast to all that cheery bustle, the best accommodation in town is calm 
and airy, with rooms painted white, cream and grey. Pretty Riad Lolita (doubles 
from €45,riadlolitatarifa.com <http://riadlolitatarifa.com/home_19090.html>) is 
a practical self-catering choice for families or groups of friends, to let as 
individual rooms or as a whole, with a central patio, shared kitchen, sitting 
room and roof terrace. If that’s full, try coolly artyHotel Misiana 
<http://www.misiana.com/> (doubles from €75 B&B). Up the coast, Hotel Hurricane 
<http://hotelhurricane.com/> (doubles from €87 B&B), hotelhurricane.com) is a 
perennial favourite, with lush gardens, palm trees and pool.

Less than an hour by ferry from her larger sibling, Ibiza, Formentera’s 32 
protected square miles are reminiscent of the White Isle of the 1970s. No 
branded nightclubs, no crowds of young Brits and no super-yachts moored in the 
harbour – just turquoise sea and pristine beaches. In September and October, 
things get even better – with the average temperature still around 24C the 
crowds dissipate and prices drop dramatically.

For example, a two-bedroom stone cottage 
<http://yourformentera.es/property/cottage-in-formentera-countryside/> 
(pictured) in the countryside near Cap de Barbaria costs €330 a night in July 
and August but just €130 in October.

For value and a beautiful location, check out Hostal Casbah 
<http://www.hostalcasbah.com/en/hostal-casbah.html> (doubles from €60 a night 
B&B). Its whitewashed sugar-cube dwellings, typical of Formentera’s rural 
architecture, are set in a lush, well-tended garden only five minutes’ walk 
from the quiet end of Playa Migjorn, the island’s biggest beach.

It’s not just quiet; it’s also nudist. In testament to how very chilled 
Formentera can make even uptight Brits, my partner and I soon followed suit – 
but then, Migjorn’s 6km of white sand allows for personal space of scandalously 
decadent proportions.

 Hotel Casbah, near Migjorn beach 
When we tired of Migjorn’s clear waters, we walked east to Kiosko 62 
<https://www.facebook.com/62Formentera> , a beach shack run by a delightful 
hippy who serves an addictive in-house gin-based cocktail, the Pomada.

To watch the sunset, a Balearic tradition, try drinks or dinner at Beso Beach 
<http://www.besobeach.com/> on the other side of the island. Rustic tables, 
sand underfoot and a woven straw roof cannot disguise the fact that Beso is 
more chic than shabby. There’s a sophisticated à la carte Mediterranean/Basque 
menu, or tuck into allonganissa hot dog, a street food snack dreamed up by 
ex-El Bulli chef Carles Abellan and served on the beach after 6pm.

By day, it’s possible to explore the island by bike, cycling across a flat, 
austerely beautiful landscape of olive groves and fields. Don’t, however, make 
the mistake of biking to Pilar de la Mola, which turned out to be located at 
the top of Formentera’s only hill – its craft market (Wednesday and Saturday) 
and chi-chi boutiques selling floaty, bohemian dresses and kaftans are best 
approached by car.

 Beso Beach is more chic than shabby 
For nightlife, head to Es Pujols, were the teenage children of the well-heeled 
Italians we’d seen at Beso Beach eat, drink and enjoy theirpasseggiata between 
the resort’s many bars.

Inland, Sant Francesc Xavier, the island’s biggest town, is set around a 
pretty church and a square with palm trees, where children play till late as 
their parents eat, drink and chat. It’s somehow typical of Formentera that all 
this unspoiled charm is combined with seriously stylish boutiques and 
restaurants such asCa Na Pepa <http://www.canapepa.com/en/> (mains from €21), 
with its extensive, eclectic menu.

Weary of commuting by ferry to more prosperous Malta, a vocal minority of 
young Gozitans are lobbying the government for a road tunnel connecting the two 
islands. But Gozo, very much Malta’s relaxed little sister, would surely change 
beyond all recognition should the plans go through.

For visitors, though, with temperatures in the 20s into October, the leisurely 
half-hour sea crossing from Cirkewwa (€4.65) is actually a pleasure. The ferry 
arrives in Mgarr harbour, overlooked by the sandy neo-gothic Our Lady of 
Lourdes Chapel. Waterside restaurants such asPorto Vecchio 
<http://www.portovecchiorestaurant.com/> (mains €20) offer great seafood 
platters.Gleneagles Bar 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gleneagles-Bar-Mgarr-Gozo/116370851819867> (on

Malta’s crisp, citrussy signature brew (pronounced “chisk”).

Gozo’s arresting greenery – relative to Malta’s dustier palette – is best 
surveyed from the lofty citadel in Victoria, its dinky capital. It’s easily 
reached by taxi (a sedate experience by Mediterranean standards, most rides 
around €10). Inside the ancient walls, restaurantTa’ Rikardu 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ta-Rikardu/132362870189416> (mains €18) offers 
a bounty of cheese, Gozitan sausage and wine made from grapes grown by the 
proprietor himself. Even the salt is harvested from traditional coastal 
saltpans.

Of the island’s 46 mostly baroque chapels, the Church of Saint John the 
Baptist in the village of Xewkija is one of highlights. In its shadow sits the 
boutiqueQuaint Hotel <http://www.quainthotelsgozo.com/xewkija-hotel/> (doubles 
from €71 B&B), a contemporary 12-room haven with restaurant.

For seaside lovers, Marsalforn on the north coast packs a lot in, with 
excellent restaurants – notablyIl-Kartell 
<https://www.facebook.com/kartellrestaurant/> (mains €15). On its eastern edge, 
the beach at Ghar Qawqla is perfect for swimming into October. A good bet for 
accommodation isMurella Living <http://www.murellaliving.com/> (doubles from 
€70 B&B), an artsy new joint with colourful rooms themed around the sights and 
culture of the island.

 Gozo has fantastic year-round diving. Photograph: Alamy 
Gozo is rightly famed for its year-round diving: the Inland Sea is a 
crystal-clear lagoon on the west coast, connected to the sea by a narrow, 
divable crevasse and teeming with marine life. To the south, divers can inspect 
the roomy MV Karwela, which was deliberately scuttled in 2006 to create a reef.

For Neolithic spectacle the Ggantika Temple is unbeatable: it’s 1,000 years 
older than Stonehenge and every bit as breathtaking. On the north coast, the 
Calypso Caves, immortalised in Homer’s Odyssey, are handily adjacent to Ramla 
Bay, consistently rated one of the finest beaches in the world. The Azure 
Window on its western fringe is an incredible 30-metre high limestone arch that 
featured in Game of Thrones and is, geologists reckon, on the verge of 
collapsing into the sea. Another reason to go now.
