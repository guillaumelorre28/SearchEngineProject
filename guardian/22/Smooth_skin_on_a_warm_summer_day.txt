Primers are summer’s secret weapon. Not only do they mattify sweaty skin, even 
your skin tone and “blur” wrinkles, but they keep your make-up from sliding off 
on to your computer keyboard by teatime. The best ones moisturise and give a 
gentle glow or tint too, so you can wear them without foundation on the rare 
relaxed days, when you care a little less.
