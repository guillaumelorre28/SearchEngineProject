In days gone by, for many families, a lunch at the local club wasn’t complete 
until the adult diners had lightened their pockets with a flutter on the pokies.

Affectionately known as “one-armed bandits”, the mechanical devices devoured 
spare change of any size and occasionally rewarded players when a bunch of 
coins clattered back into the tray.

These days, poker machines are an entirely different beast. And an 
unsuspecting Australian public is far worse off because of it.

Australia is home to 20% of the world’s poker machines, and the Australian 
Government estimates that 600,000 people play the pokies every week, with 40% 
of them addicted.

Whereas the old-style pokies had winning odds of about one in 8000, their 
modern electronic counterparts often only cough up a major prize once in every 
10 million – or more – hits.

The repercussions of problem gambling

Australians lose more money per capita to gambling than any other nationality 
in the world, saysThe Economist, with $20 billion dollars going down the 
gambling gurgler every year. Of that, $11 billion is swallowed up by poker 
machines.

in the world."

If losing all of that money isn’t enough of a problem, gamblers and their 
families lose in many other ways as well: the Australian Gambling Research 
Centre says that gambling problems affect a gambler’s intimate relationships 
with partners, children, parents, siblings and grandparents.

Research has also identified an association between problem gambling and the 
rate of family violence, and has also shown that the children of parents who 
have a gambling problem are at a much higher risk of becoming problem gamblers 
themselves.

To top things off, local businesses miss out on much-needed revenue when it is 
instead being fed to electronic machines in large clubs and gaming venues.

Sinister design hooks players

Recent research into how poker machines work and are designed consistently 
highlights a sinister finding: these machines are developed by teams of people, 
including engineers, programmers, composers and graphic designers, whose sole 
aim is to get players addicted to inserting more and more cash.

Dr Charles Livingstone, from the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive 
Medicine at Melbourne’s Monash University, says that Aristocrat, one of the 
world’s (and certainly Australia’s) biggest poker machine manufacturers, spends 
$153 million per annum on research and development.

“Poker machines are manufactured with the express intent of being efficient at 
relieving people of their money, and they’re very good at it,” Dr Livingstone 
says. “They know what they’re doing and they’re responsible for it. So yes, 
they should be held responsible.”

As addictive as drugs

So, how exactly do people become addicted? Dr Livingstone says players are 
conditioned to develop a pattern of behaviour that is incredibly difficult to 
change. And the pattern of addiction is not dissimilar to the one that develops 
in drug addicts.

“We now know that the underlying mechanism for this is the release of dopamine 
and other brain chemicals which stimulate the brain’s reward system in the same 
way that cocaine does,” he says. “In other words, the device provides rewards 
which the brain perceives in anticipation (releasing dopamine), and when they 
are delivered (releasing dopamine) and even when they appear as ‘near misses’ 
(releasing dopamine). The dopamine is the mechanism for addiction, which is now 
thought to also be a consequence of brain plasticity.”

South Australian woman Sharon Hollamby speaks of her poker machine addiction 
in the documentary,Ka-Ching! Pokie Nation <http://kachingfilm.com>.

“The machines hijacked my brain and I just couldn’t stop,” she says. “The 
longer I was there, the more I was hypnotised … they’re destroying communities, 
they’re destroying society.”

Taking a stand

The good news is that individuals and communities can fight back. With the 
help of a psychologist and support groups, Hollamby was able to beat her 
addiction. And, with the help of social justice lawyers from Maurice Blackburn, 
a tightknit community in Castlemaine, Victoria, recently prevented a business 
consortium from opening a large poker machine venue in a town that already had 
a large number of poker machines.


Working pro bono for the community group known as Enough Pokies in Castlemaine 
(EPIC), Maurice Blackburn entered into a drawn out battle that culminated in 
the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruling in favour of EPIC in 
2013.

A lawyer from Maurice Blackburn’s social justice practice, Elizabeth O’Shea, 
described the victory as a “watershed moment” that would be a blueprint for 
other communities fighting unwanted pokies and problem gambling.

John Salanitri, a principal at Maurice Blackburn, says that, along with the 
Alliance for Gambling Reform, the firm is now looking at pursuing a landmark 
legal action against the manufacturers of poker machines being in breach of 
consumer law for misleading and deceptive conduct.

“The idea of this action is to demonstrate there have been breaches of 
consumer law, ,” Salanitri says. “These companies are promoting an addiction.”

When a person buys the drug ice, they know that they are buying a drug of 
addiction, says Salanitri’s colleague, Maurice Blackburn principal, Jacob 
Varghese. “But with poker machines, often the players don’t know they are 
addictive,” he says.

“With all the bells, whistles and lights, and the almost-winning, they feed a 
reward centre in the brain, and under MRI, the reward looks the same as the 
reward people get from cocaine.”

Turning the spotlight of responsibility

Even when you are losing, the machine will do things to make you think you 
have almost won, such as flash lights and play winning music, saysDesigned to 
Create Addiction, a short film about the machines and their ability to entrap 
fromThe Pokies Play You <http://www.pokiesplayyou.org.au>, the Alliance for 
Gambling Reform’s website.

And mental health professionals now recognise “Gambling Disorder” as a 
syndrome with symptoms similar to those of drug addiction, writes Varghese in
The Guardian. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/29/to-beat-the-pokies-we-must-change-our-idea-of-personal-responsibility>

Pokies addiction is one of Australia’s most significant moral, social and 
economic problems."
Jacob Varghese 
He cites a court case that took place back in the 1990s between problem 
gambler and milkman, Christopher Reynolds, and the Katoomba RSL Club where he 
regularly lost thousands of dollars playing the pokies.

“The court found that Katoomba RSL had done nothing wrong,” Varghese says. “It 
had no duty of care to prevent Mr Reynolds from gambling.

But Varghese says it’s high time that the spotlight was turned to the 
responsibility of the pokies industry and the role it plays in developing 
problem gamblers.

“Pokies addiction is one of Australia’s most significant moral, social and 
economic problems. Lawyers, health care professionals, politicians and, 
ultimately, the pokies industry itself, need to take responsibility for solving 
this slow-burning national crisis.”
