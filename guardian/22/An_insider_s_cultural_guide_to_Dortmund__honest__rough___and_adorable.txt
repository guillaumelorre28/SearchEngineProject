In five words 

Honest, adorable, rough, multicultural, ever-changing.


Sound of the city? 

Fan chants in Signal Iduna Park 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion>, Borussia Dortmund’s football 
stadium. On some windy summer afternoons you’ll be able to hear them all over 
town. Gives you goosebumps.

Everyone’s tuning into …

Tatort is a legendary television series <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0806910/> 
that’s been broadcast every Sunday evening since 1970. It’s jointly produced by 
different regional broadcasters and features a collection of different police 
stories and different police teams in different cities. Every once in a while 
an episode from Dortmund is broadcast and everyone sits in front of their TV.

Singer-songwriter Jonas David, no doubt! Since quitting his job at the age of 
21, Jonas focused on playing the guitar in several bands until he founded his 
own. He refuses ordinary methods to capture his music and likes to record at 
the places he lives, writes or simply feels something. Visiting one of his 
concerts is a must-do.

Salsa Open Airs at Dortmund Westpark 
<https://www.facebook.com/events/1382768462053183/>. Although latin dances are 
not the first thing that come to mind when thinking about Dortmund, there’s a 
remarkable community that gathers every Friday to partake in them. Some weeks 
up to 100 people fill the Westpark’s temporary dance-floor with passion and 
contagious joy. From June until the end of September everyone is welcome, 
regardless of whether you’re a professional or a newbie.
