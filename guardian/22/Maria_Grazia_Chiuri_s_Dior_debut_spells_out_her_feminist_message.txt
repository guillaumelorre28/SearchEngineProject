With a catwalk show in the gardens of the Musée Rodin that brought Rihanna and 
Kate Moss to the front row and a square mile of central Paris to a standstill, 
Maria Grazia Chiuri became thefirst woman to head the house of Christian Dior 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/07/maria-grazia-chiuri-exits-valentino>
. It’s a position that arguably makes her the most powerful woman in Parisian 
fashion since Coco Chanel. The moment is significant not only because Dior is a 
byword for style that has currency all over the world, but because it’s a house 
that symbolises womanhood itself. Since its very beginning, with the nipped-in 
silhouette of the postwar New Look, Dior has represented femininity as surely 
as Chanel has stood for chic.

The most eyecatching look of the day was not a traditional waisted Dior Bar 
jacket <http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/17255>, or a fairytale red-carpet gown 
of the typeworn by Jennifer Lawrence at the Oscars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/feb/28/oscars-red-carpet-fashion-2016-in-pictures>
, but a slogan T-shirt bearing the title of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s 
Beyonce-sampled TED talk, “We should all be feminists 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc>”. The opportunity for a woman to 
redefine what femininity looks like could hardly come at a more culturally 
resonant time, as the first female US presidential candidate faces an opposing 
campaign mired in accusations of misogyny. Chiuri – who until now has kept a 
low personal profile, sharing her previous role at Valentino with a partner – 
made it explicitly clear that she intends to embrace the feminist symbolism of 
her appointment.

The new Dior is punchy and defiantly anti-pretty. Catwalk tributes to “strong 
women” are not new at fashion week – Donatella Versace almost has a patent on 
them – but the flat shoes, tightly tramlined braids and punk stomp down a 
floorboard catwalk were a remarkable contrast to recent Dior history. It’s only 
four years since Chiuri’s predecessor, Raf Simons,wallpapered the venue of his 
first show with fresh flowers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jul/02/raf-simons-show-christian-dior>
. The collection came as a surprise after Valentino, where Chiuri made her name 
with graceful, slender gowns and exquisite workmanship. The very first outfit 
in this show was an off-white quilted jacket and cropped trousers, which the 
designer said were based on “the uniform of the female fencer [which] is, with 
the exception of some special protections, the same as for a male fencer”.

Valentino fans hoping to see that label’s distinctive Renaissance-princess 
silhouette amplified at Dior were disappointed. With hindsight, the Valentino 
moment that best predicted what Chiuri would do at Dior came last year, when 
she enlisted Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson (in character as Derek Zoolander and 
Hansel)to end a show with a surprise walk-off 
<http://fashionista.com/2015/03/zoolander-valentino>, part of a Zoolander 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/14/zoolander-2-ben-stiller-owen-wilson-penelope-cruz-review-mark-kermode>
 publicity campaign. Chiuri’s love of pop culture was clear when she paid 
homage in her first Dior show not to the house’s signature tailoring, but to 
the “J’adore Dior” T-shirt worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex and the City. 
“There are many people who, when they think of Dior, they think of that 
T-shirt,” she said after the show.

The clothes themselves seemed very much secondary to the message. The honeybee 
motif that featured on Dior menswear last decade, when it was designed by Hedi 
Slimane, was embroidered on shirts, emblazoned in gold on handbags and embossed 
on the invitations. As well as the feminist message of questioning gender 
traditions that borrowing a menswear motif suggests, the designer said 
backstage that she wanted “her Dior” to reference not just Monsieur Dior’s 
early collections, but “so many other talents who have worked here – Slimane, 
Galliano, Raf Simons, Gianfranco Ferre”.

Chiuri, who is 52 and until recently lived in Rome, began her career at Fendi, 
where she was part of the team that created the famous “baguette” bag. In 17 
years at Valentino, in partnership with Pierpaolo Piccioli, she brought back to 
vibrancy a brand that was languishing in semi-retirement.

Piccioli, who has taken sole control of Valentino and will show his first 
collection without Chiuri on Sunday, applauded from the front row.
