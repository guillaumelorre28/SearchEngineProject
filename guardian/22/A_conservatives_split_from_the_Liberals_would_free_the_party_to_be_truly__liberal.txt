There have been interesting stirrings in the conservative hemisphere of 
Australian politics over the past few months. One of these stirrings involvesa 
media outlet called the Rebel. <http://www.therebel.media/>


If you’ve not heard of the Rebel, you can think of it as Canada’s Breitbart 
News – the far-right news outlet that was central to Donald Trump’s fortunes in 
the US presidential race. I’ve heard whispers around the traps over the last 
little while that the Rebel is considering setting up an Australian operation.

To try to get to the bottom of the speculation, I emailed Ezra Levant, who 
describes himself as Rebel Commander. His bio on his site cheerfully notes: “In 
2014, Ezra was chosen as the most irritating Canadian by the Globe and Mail’s 
TV critic.”

I asked Levant whether it was true the Rebel was planning an expansion down 
under. He didn’t confirm anything but he certainly didn’t deny it. “You’ll just 
have to watch and find out along with everyone else!” he said.

While we are all waiting and watching, I can share a bit of history. When the 
Liberal senator Cory Bernardiwent to America on his secondment to the United 
Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/03/cory-bernardi-warns-one-nation-will-rise-if-migration-not-halved>
 earlier this year,he got a ringside seat on the Trump insurgency 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/02/australian-senators-cory-bernardi-and-malcolm-roberts-pledge-support-for-donald-trump>
. He watched the operation carefully, and met a number of useful people.

He also made time to have a chat with the Rebel while he was at the UN.

According to the Rebel’s subsequent report, the UN had banned journalists from 
the news site from reporting the international climate conference in Morocco. 
The Rebel had raised a petition in protest, which it delivered to New York. 
Bernardi told the news site – in one of those far-right chats where everyone 
agrees with everyone else – that some UN delegates felt “almost bullied into 
complying” with resolutions.

 Cory Bernardi, agreeing with Ezra Levant. 
It doesn’t really matter who agreed with whom, or what the line of inquiry was 
about, let’s just note the contact between the far-right website andthe senator 
who keeps flirting with breaking away from the Liberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/22/christensen-threatens-to-leave-coalition-amid-fears-bernardi-may-form-own-party>
 and forming his own conservative political movement in Australia.

Any modern political insurgency requires an internet strategy, and while the 
establishment media market in Australia is dominated by News Corp Australia, 
which obviously leans right, we don’t really have a Breitbart equivalent in 
Australia.

There’s a market opening for a first mover. So let’s just call that contact in 
New York between Bernardi and the Rebel interesting.

Also interesting is one last pre-Christmas threat from the LNP’s George 
Christensen. Hetook to Facebook on Thursday 
<https://www.facebook.com/gchristensenmp/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED&fref=nf> to kick the 
prime minister (which is not the interesting part – these days the government’s 
internals are so surly you can find any number of people happy to do that). The 
interesting part was the explicit mention of other groups he could join, but 
probably wouldn’t, if Malcolm was a good lad.
 A Christmas message from George Christensen. 
Hint hint, Malcolm.

And, of course, there’s no show without punch. Another Christmas message, from 
a former prime minister, currently in Israel, for what it’s worth.

To be strong & united, the Liberal Party cannot take the base for granted & 
must convincingly argue for its values & principles.

Right now it is impossible to say with certainty whether Bernardi will part 
ways with theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> in 2017, either 
solo, or with company, because he’s not saying.

He’s being coy. As Santa might say, ho ho ho.

Some of the current static in the conservative hemisphere pre-Christmas may 
have nothing whatever to do with portending a breakout as the opening political 
chapter of 2017, it might just reflect continuing internal restiveness about 
the government’s current less-than-stellar political fortunes.

So I repeat, I do not know whether Bernardi will stay where he is and keep 
being the government’s in-house maverick, or jump ship.

No idea. Underlined.

But my end-of-year instinct, for what it’s worth, is he will strike out with 
his new venture, and if he does, I think this would be a good development for
Australian politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics>.

I think this would be a good development for the following reasons.

All year I’ve been writing that the Liberal party room exhibits the largest 
ideological spectrum we’ve seen inside the party for some time. There are 
capital C conservatives and small L liberals. If you are a prime minister 
living in fractious and febrile political times, and you have very limited 
internal authority, it is hard to bridge the differences convincingly.

Malcolm Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> 
as prime minister has made every effort possible to accommodate the internal 
spectrum of views. He has, in his own fashion, tried to lead in collegiate 
fashion, at considerable cost to his own personal standing. His approval 
ratings have nosedived.

He governs exactly like a prime minister in minority government, except all 
the internal deals aren’t transparent to the public.

When Julia Gillard presided over the minority parliament between 2010 and 
2013, she negotiated a bunch of agreements with crossbenchers that were in the 
public domain.

Turnbull right now is hostage to the whims of colleagues with only minimum 
levels of transparency. Anyone who has watched federal politics over the last 
12 months will know this looks like death by a thousand cuts.

So a splinter movement of conservatives could, if it works, hit pause on the 
rolling right-left struggles within the government. It would free the Liberal 
party up to be a genuine party of liberalism – not a party of reactionary 
populism with a conservative bent.

A split would, if it happens, and if it succeeds, be no less complicated than 
the current split in the progressive vote between Labor and the Greens.

The ALP would dearly like to take its left flank back and boost its primary 
vote, but not at the cost of a reverse takeover, which is, essentially, what we 
are seeing with the Jeremy Corbyn phenomenon in the UK.

Similarly in Australia, conservatives are attempting to engineer a reverse 
takeover of the Liberal party which leads to running internal conflict, and the 
deeply unconvincing situation of a political centrist – Turnbull – being the 
figurehead of a government mouthing a bunch of positions that explicitly 
contradict his own past beliefs and actions.

Quite apart from freeing the Liberal party, and allowing the opportunity for 
it to remain explicitly a party of the political centre – a conservative 
movement would offer more choice to voters who are increasingly expressing 
either exhaustion or disgust with Australia’s two-party system.

Democracies are highly competitive places. It would have to fight for its 
place in the spectrum.

Representative politics has to be responsive to the desires of the community, 
and political movements have to represent the cross-section of views that exist 
in the electorate.

I’ve said before I like the current parliament, because it is genuinely 
representative, from hard right to hard left, and a representative parliament 
has some prospect of keeping voters engaged with their democracy, which in my 
book is a positive thing.

The hegemony of the major parties declines every election cycle. Voters are 
looking for a different kind of politics.

For my last major reporting assignment for 2016, I spent a few days outside 
Canberra talking to voters who have parted ways with the major parties because 
they don’t feel connected to the process.

Cory Bernardi furious Malcolm Turnbull 'implied Coalition MPs are homophobic'

They are searching for democratic political representation that validates 
their views, that sticks up for their interests, and is quantifiably different 
from the tone and temper of the major parties.

They want Australian politics to be different, and they are voting with their 
feet.

So if Bernardi wants to sail forth with his own homegrown insurgency and 
connect with a group of voters who feel marginalised, and compete for public 
support, good luck to him.

If it makes life more complicated for major party politics, or for the current 
government, which barely clings to power, so be it.

In politics, as in life, you reap what you sow.
