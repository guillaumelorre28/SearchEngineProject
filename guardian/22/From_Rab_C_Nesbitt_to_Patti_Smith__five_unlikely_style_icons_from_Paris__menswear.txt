 Human tents at the Acne Studio Men’s SS17 show. 
For the Kinfolk reading aesthetes, the “hipster camping” phenomenon is a very 
real goal – the outdoorsy version of you who smokes a beautifully hand-crafted 
pipe and is casually confident about making corn bread in a Dutch oven. InParis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris>, designers took these aspirational 
dreams and made them real, from the sherbet-coloured headscarf and necklace of 
golden driftwood at Loewe (a psychedelic gap year) and Balmain’s Hunger 
Games-esque traveller (a mirror-covered poncho and coloured beads worn with 
gladiator sandals) to the Chapman Brothers’ safari animal imagery for Louis 
Vuitton. Acne’s collection included giant rain jackets cut to triangular 
tent-like shapes, creating an A-line silhouette. Inspired by languorous Swedish 
summers and the joy of triangles, this was a pyramid scheme we could totally 
get behind.

There was an undertow of Andersen-esque, disturbing fairytales at the Comme 
Des Garçons Homme Plus show. Among complicated weaves of Edward 
Scissorhands-style hair crowns and see-through trench coats was the logo: “The 
King Is Naked” emblazoned in a felt-tip pen font on a plastic vest top. A 
message from Andersen’s The Emperor’s New Clothes that, considering the 
extremity of the collection, was both tongue in cheek and a little bit defiant. 
Meanwhile, Rick Owens, master ofbody horror and shock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/22/-sp-penis-flashing-at-rick-owens-menswear-show>
, did the anti-Owens. His collection featured soft layered-robe outfits in 
shades of white, cream and yellow that looked like marshmallowy flowers. He was 
toying with the Andersen-esque themes of transformation (the show invite 
featured a man morphing into a walrus) and eco-human unity (several versions of 
Neil Young’s environmentally-themed After the Goldrush played on an extended 
loop). Very Little Mermaid.

 White shirts at the Maison Margiela show. Photograph: Peter White/Getty Images 
The deconstruction of the suit was a big talking point on the catwalks in 
Paris. Patchwork was the new uniformity. Broken suits were made from odd scraps 
of material sewn together which played on concepts of utility and recycling. At 
Maison Margiela the suits were worn with the cutting design lines still in 
evidence, while the jackets were styled half off-the-shoulder with the zip 
undone. Collars were cut off at the back, sleeves were pulled out from under a 
shirt and belts of material were left dangling in a model’s wake. It called to 
mind Patti Smith’s Robert MapplethorpeHorses

With Vetements, Demna Gvasalia redefined the architecture of the dress jacket. 
The alpha, exaggerated dress jacket was in, and the slim-fitting version 
suddenly felt like old news. In his first men’s collection forBalenciaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2016/jun/22/ikea-chic-and-talking-heads-suits-balenciaga-gets-the-vetements-treatment>
, Gvasalia went wide-shouldered and broad-chested, recalling David Byrne’s “big 
suit” from the Stop Making Sense era. At the time it was partly read as a 
comment on the depersonalisation of the self in the sea of big business, 
Gvasalia’s suit jacket felt equally subversive, a directive to go widescreen 
when world views are getting less so.

 String vests at Sacai. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock 
The Glaswegian’s string vest made a slight return at Paris (without the 
stains), becoming a sartorial symbol for youthful defiance. At Sacai the vest 
appeared as a T-shirt substitute, with models wearing it with thigh-length ones 
under lilac-pink trench coats, bombers and flower-print jumpers. While at the 
Comme Des Garçons Homme Plus show it appeared in a plastic see-through, shower 
curtain-like form. Dior Homme featured the string vest in a variety of guises – 
in white, worn with skinny bovver boots, and in black, tucked into some wide 
skater pants. The take-home message was that the string vest was no longer 
about drunken slumbers but now signified a punky outsider-dom.
