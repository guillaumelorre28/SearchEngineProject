“A terrible beauty is born.” Only William Butler Yeats could reconcile the 
catalyst for modern-day Ireland with the brutal fallout from the 1916 Easter 
Rising in five simple words. He was right of course. The sequence of events 
that followed on from that Easter Monday when rebellious men and women took 
hold of Dublin changed the mindset of a nation. Within six years Arthur 
Griffith was elected president of Dáil Éireann (the assembly of Ireland) and a 
new nation was created.

A hundred years later and Ireland has come of age; 2016 is all about 
commemorating the Easter Rising. For anyone visiting the Emerald Isle it will 
be hard to miss the centenary salutes throughout the year.

 Opening image from Dublin Rising, Google Maps’ virtual reality tour of the 
city. 
Most of the activity will centre on the capital, culminating in the 
synchronised laying of wreaths in locations around the city from Dublin Castle 
to the Garden of Remembrance. The GPO (General Post Office) building at the 
core of the capital and the rising was destroyed in 1916. It was restored in 
stages and from this year will house the 17,200 sq ftGPO Witness History 
Interpretive Exhibition Centre <http://www.gpowitnesshistory.ie>.

One particularly innovative marker of the centenary has been created by Google 
Maps. It’s calledDublin Rising <https://dublinrising.withgoogle.com/welcome/> 
and features the voice of actor Colin Farrell taking visitors on an online 
ramble through the modern streets of the Irish capital. It peels back the 
events on that Easter Monday with the click of a mouse, by linking the rising 
to 22 strategic locations. It features rare and previously unseen footage.

The head of the Irish government, taoiseach Enda Kenny labelled Dublin Rising 
a “time machine” at its launch. Google, now with a majordata processing centre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/23/ireland-cool-google-data-servers-weather>
 alongside its European HQ in Dublin, worked with academics, historians and 
museums around the city to provide graphics and stories from archive sources. 
It highlights the significance and fate of these landmarks during and after the 
rising.

The 1,200 rebels who stormed Dublin on Easter Monday 1916 were led by poets, 
academics and emerging politicians such as Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera. 
Poetry and verse have helped keep memories of these figures fresh so it comes 
as no surprise that Dublin is a Unesco city of literature.

If following all of Colin Farrell’s associated locations of the Easter Rising 
carves too much time from your Dublin itinerary, whittle it down to the four 
most important landmarks.

This was Dublin’s military stronghold at the time and the first of the 
rising’s failures, when an element of the Citizen Army failed to press home 
their initial attack. In the following years, however, the castle was at the 
epicentre of the independence struggle.
Today Visitors can take advantage of the free admission to the Chester Beatty 
Library <http://www.cbl.ie/>, a European Museum of the Year winner, during a 
visit to the castle. Its collection of medieval and renaissance manuscripts is 
famous – among them is one of the first illustrated volumes of the Life of the 
Prophet.

GPO

Rebel leader Padraig Pearse and his contingent captured the building and hung 
the Irish tricolour outside. He read the proclamation for a new state and held 
the building until he was forced to evacuate.
Today: With the opening of the GPO Witness History exhibition in March, the 
site should be on the to-do list of every visitor with an interest in history. 
There is also a statue at the GPO of the mythological pre-Christian era hero 
Cúchulainn, tied upright against a tree; it was put up as a symbol in honour of 
the Rising.

The rebel leaders were taken here after the rising failed. Future president 
Éamon de Valera (played by the late Alan Rickman in the movie Michael Collins) 
was held there at the time. Sixteen of the commanding officers and proclamation 
signatories were executed; mostly at this prison with many of them then being 
interred at Arbour Hill Cemetery.
Today: Kilmainhaim Gaol 
<http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/dublin/kilmainhamgaol/> is one of the most 
visited tourist attractions in Ireland. It’s among the largest unoccupied 
prisons in Europe and offers an incredible insight on the country’s turbulent 
past.

Four courts

Rebel commandant Ned Daly’s 1st battalion gained control of the courts 
<http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/pagecurrent/C405A2905C07523880256DA900495EE2>
 when capturing the area around Christchurch. He was executed by the British in 
the aftermath. The building would be largely destroyed some years later – and 
faithfully restored again.
Today: The Four Courts – housing the supreme court, high court and Dublin 
circuit court – dominate the river Liffey’s landscape. Its dome is one of the 
most recognisable landmarks in Dublin.

If the rugged voice of Colin Farrell through your headphones doesn’t work for 
you, there’s anorganised walk <http://www.1916rising.com/> from 11.30am every 
day in season (restricted to weekends from November to March). The tour leaves 
from the International Bar, Wicklow Street, takes two hours and costs €13pp.

This tour <http://vikingsplash.com/> (adult €22, child (2-12) €12, teenager 
€17), departing from Stephen’s Green North, makes for an exciting way to see 
the city. It’s a duck tour, aboard a second world war amphibious vehicle that 
dips in and out of the river Liffey. Passengers become Viking invaders for the 
trip and the guide likes to interact with unsuspecting members of the public. 
Wear warm clothes and a waterproof jacket; it can get chilly on the water. The 
tours run every half hour between 10am and 3.30pm most days.

And now for a pint of the black stuff

Ireland’s capital is awash with history but no visit would be complete without 
a sample of the black stuff. If literature is the soul of Dublin, then Guinness 
is the blood that has run through its veins for over 250 years. The best way to 
sample both is in the pub, a pivotal cornerstone of Irish society for centuries.

Toner’s Pub
“The problem with some people is that when they aren’t drunk they’re sober.” 
At least that’s what WB Yeats thought.Toner’s 
<http://www.visitdublin.com/see-do/details/toners-pub/31078/#53.337765|-6.252390|16>
 was the pub of choice for the great poet when he was in town.

“A man can never have too much red wine, too many books, or too much 
ammunition.” So said Rudyard Kipling. He was partial to one of Ireland’smost 
iconic properties <http://www.shelbournedining.ie/the-horseshoe-bar> when in 
town, as were many of the visiting literati throughout the years, including 
William Makepeace Thackeray.

“He entered Davy Byrnes. Moral pub. He doesn’t chat. Stands a drink now and 
then.” So wrote James Joyce of the fictional protagonist of Ulysses, Leopold 
Bloom. He was a regular atDavy Byrnes <http://www.davybyrnes.com/>, as was the 
great writer himself; they were both partial to the pub’s gorgonzola 
sandwiches, which are still on the menu.

The Bailey
“The mind maybe impaired by alcohol, I mused, but withal it may be pleasantly 
impaired,” wrote novelist and playwright Flann O’Brien. He was a Bailey 
regular, along with Patrick Kavanagh, Oliver St John Gogarty, James Joyce and 
poet Padraic Colum. After a night on the black stuff you may not feel quite as 
poetic the following morning. There’s no better way to shed the cobwebs from 
the night before than with a blast of rain-fresh Dublin air and a stretch of 
the legs.

Getting around independently

Forget driving in Dublin. Traffic slows to a snail’s pace in the city centre 
but bus lanes mean that buses are viable, especially with theHop On Hop Off 
<https://www.dublinsightseeing.ie/citytour.aspx> service (all-day from €18.70 
adult, €8.50 child), which is also a good way to see the city’s main tourist 
sights.
