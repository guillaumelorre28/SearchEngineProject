For some Aboriginal people, being on the cashless welfare card is akin to 
wearing a dog tag around their neck, says Jody Miller.

Miller, a Nauo man, is a member of the Aboriginal community council in 
Koonibba, a remote town of about 200 people in outbackSouth Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia>. Its population is 
included in the total for Ceduna, a seaside town 43km away on the west coast of 
the Eyre peninsula.

The 12-month trial of the cashless welfare card began in Ceduna on 15 March 
and in the Western Australian towns of Kununurra and Wyndham on 26 April.

Cashless welfare card could benefit other communities, says Turnbull

Welfare recipients in the trial communities, most of whom are Indigenous, 
began receiving 80% of their welfare payments into a restricted debit card. It 
cannot be used to withdraw cash or buy alcohol or gambling products. Many 
members of the communities and political leaders say the card has led to a 
decline in people playing the pokies and being drunk on the streets and say, 
anecdotally, they see more people buying fresh food.


Although the trial has been described as a success 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/31/cashless-welfare-card-could-benefit-other-communities-says-turnbull>
 by the government and by the Ceduna mayor, Alan Suter, a visit to broader 
areas of Ceduna, including the north-west towns of Maralinga Tjarutja and 
Koonibba, reveals mixed responses.


Miller says there is a sense of shame felt by members of his communitywhen 
they have to pay for items on the card, which is a distinctive grey.

“Everybody that I encounter that sees this card looks you up and down, and 
their eyes say, ‘You can’t get a job,’ ” he told Guardian Australia.

“But if you walk into local hotels, for example, they’re all backpackers who 
are working there. They’re the people who get employed and then make their 
money and off they go. But where are the jobs for Aboriginal people?”

Miller believes the majority are being punished for the alcohol and gambling 
issues of some. He also questions why the trial has been rolled out in 
communities where most welfare recipients are Aboriginal.

“If you want to make it non-prejudiced, you target the whites and the 
Aboriginals,” he says. “This was just meant for the Aboriginal people. They’ll 
be coming around with dog tags again soon.”

“Dog tags” is the term used by some Indigenous people for citizenship 
certificates issued until 1975. To obtain a certificate, which entitled them to 
move freely and to be served in pubs, people were required to renounce their 
Aboriginality and speak only English.

Miller says those on the card, known as the indue card 
<https://indue.com.au/dct/>, find ways to get extra cash. He knows of people 
who approach shoppers at grocery stores and ask them to pay for their items 
with the card in exchange for cash. Those handing over the cash will usually 
keep a percentage for themselves, he says.

People need the cash for lunch money for their children, to assist family 
members, or for cash-in-hand payments for goods and services. But he says 
authorities have not openly acknowledged problems with the card.

“I say to the government and the mayor, ‘Don’t dictate to us,’ ” he says. 
“Don’t bullshit to us. Lay it on the table.”

Minutes from a meeting of more than 100 people from Ceduna and the surrounding 
towns taken in November 2015 note that the Yalata elder Mima Smart, a medal of 
the Order of Australia recipient for her services to the Aboriginal community, 
supported the card “for some, not for all”. She signed up to the card on behalf 
of the Yalata community, 200km west of Ceduna on the Great Australian Bight.

 The debit card is a distinctive grey. ‘Everybody that I encounter that sees 
this card looks you up and down,’ Jody Miller says. 
The chair of the Maralinga Tjarutja Council, Keith Peters, told attendees, 
including senator Nick Xenophon and the then assistant minister for social 
services, Alan Tudge, that he did not support the card. No one at the meeting 
supported universal application of the card to everyone on welfare in the 
community, the minutes said.

A letter from the president of the National Welfare Rights Network, Kate 
Beaumont, to the Senate community affairs legislation committee also questions 
the extent of the government’s consultation.

“Evidence to the committee from other witnesses indicates that the 
consultation has occurred between government and organisations, as opposed to 
individuals likely to be impacted,” Beaumont wrote. “Another key stakeholder, 
the East Kimberly chamber of commerce, confirms an absence of direct 
consultation with people likely to be affected by the trial.”

But the government has said the card’s introduction followed widespread 
consultation with Aboriginal communities.

The report [on the welfare card] is brazenly biased, written to favour the 
card and shine the trials in a positive light
Greens senator Rachel Siewert 
During a tour of Ceduna in October, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said 
the card had made a “positive difference” to the community and could be rolled 
out to others.

His comments came after the release of the cashless debit card trial progress 
report, which cited reductions in poker machine revenue and fewer apprehensions 
under the Public Intoxication Act in the six months since the card was 
introduced. Ceduna’s mayor described the card as “the best thing we’ve ever 
had”.

Guardian Australia asked for the data used to inform the six-month progress 
report but was told by a media officer for Tudge, who is now the human services 
minister, that the report “has all of the data that we are releasing publicly 
at this point”.

The government also missed a deadline imposed by the Senate of 16 November to 
table the documents and statistics used to prepare the report, after questions 
raised by the Greens senator Rachel Siewert.

“The public and the Senate deserve to see how this report was put together,” 
Siewert said at the time. “The report is brazenly biased, written to favour the 
card and shine the trials in a positive light. The evidence in the report was 
premature and with a large amount anecdotal ‘evidence’ and should not be taken 
seriously.”

The government provided the raw data to the Senate in December, one month past 
the deadline.

Guardian Australia forwarded this data to a leading health economist, Prof 
Philip Clarke. A chair in health economics at the University of Melbourne, 
Clarke says he does not see how the data from it could be used by the 
government to determine if the trial should be continued or rolled out 
elsewhere.

“Surprisingly there is no use of statistical methods to test the significance 
of any observed trends, so it’s hard to know what can be concluded even on a 
descriptive level,” Clarke says. “Given the issues with the design, it is hard 
to see how they will have evidence of the program’s impact on which to base an 
informed policy decision.”

He says it is difficult to determine whether declines in discharges from the 
sobering-up unit in in Ceduna or decreases in driving under the influence of 
drugs were due to the card, “due to play of chance, or other factors unrelated 
to the program”.

The welfare card trial was implemented alongside other measures in South 
Australia andWestern Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/western-australia> aimed at 
reducing the impact of alcohol and gambling, such as improving housing and 
access to health and support services.

“Having so many outcomes which are not prospectively defined, there is always 
a risk of cherry picking what are deemed favourable results,” Clarke says.

But Tudge told Guardian Australia that the trial was progressing as well as he 
could have possibly hoped and that the data available pointed to its success. 
There would be a full independent evaluation at the end of the trial.

“There was extensive consultation about the trial and it was co-designed, and 
implemented, along with local community leaders – an element likely 
contributing to its early success,” Tudge says.

“Over 100 separate consultations occurred between government, communities, 
leaders, residents and service providers around the Ceduna region before the 
trials. This includes face-to-face and group meetings, plus town hall community 
forums.

“The design and consultation process for the trials was done hand in glove 
with the community leaders.”

He says although some individuals will always try to get around the system, 
local leaders, together with the government, took immediate action after 
hearing about a merchant or person not complying with the card’s rules.

“This includes blocking merchants from using the card, which takes business 
away from them, if they do not follow the rules,” he says. “If anyone has 
information about misuse or fraud, they should report it toCentrelink 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/centrelink> or the local police 
immediately.”

But Siewert told Guardian Australia that lessons had not been learned from the 
Northern Territory national emergency response 
<https://journal.anzsog.edu.au/publications/3/2012Issue3Final.pdf>, implemented 
in 2007 under the Howard government, which included a series of welfare reforms 
to stem the flow of cash going towards substance abuse. “When the Northern 
Territory intervention first started the government said it was clearly working 
because more people were buying fresh food,” she says.

“But the data didn’t hold up further in. People really just perceived things 
as being better, but when compared to centres outside of the Northern Territory 
they were getting poor results. So I have a huge question mark over this 
welfare card report, especially given how much of the evidence is anecdotal.”

Last month Siewert travelled to Kununurra in far north Western Australia to 
talk to welfare recipients on the card. Responses there were mixed: “The people 
on the card are very concerned about it and the broader non-Aboriginal 
community is by and large supportive.

“Those supportive of it all say the same things, that crime has gone down and 
rubbish has gone down, and it’s like they have swallowed what the government is 
saying hook, line and sinker because the data we have clearly indicates it’s 
too early to tell what is really going on.”

She had met a woman who told her she used her card to pay for other people’s 
groceries in exchange for cash. “She didn’t want the money for gambling or 
alcohol, she wanted it for her kids, to pay for school lunches and excursions 
and things like that,” she says.

Other people in the community told her that some businesses were charging 
higher prices to the welfare card, and giving people cash back – or a carton of 
beer – in return.

“The government says that they’ve dealt with that and those doing it have been 
sacked but the word I heard up here is that’s still going on,” Siewert said.

Bill payments are also being set up by Centrelink to automatically come out of 
the welfare card, the senator says, which means people are unable to make their 
own decisions about which bills should be prioritised and which ones could be 
paid late. “When payments are all automatic, all of their money is gone and 
there is no ability for discretion,” she says.


Similar stories were found by Guardian Australia in Ceduna. Several people 
spoke of how a local drug dealer had obtained an eftpos machine so that people 
could buy substances on their welfare card. Another woman said her friend had 
turned to prostitution to get cash.

People also said an accommodation provider in the town was allowing people to 
charge a night’s stay on their welfare cards in exchange for cash, though it 
would keep a percentage of that money for itself. A staff member told Guardian 
Australia that his manager was on holidays but that the claims were “all 
bullshit”. The manager did not return Guardian Australia’s calls.

Few welfare recipients Guardian Australia spoke to understood the processes in 
place for reporting problems with their card, or to apply for a greater 
percentage of their welfare payment to be available as cash. Others reported 
that some businesses were not set up to accept payments on the card, and that 
they needed to call the card provider and ask for those businesses to be added 
to the list of acceptable providers, a process that took time.

Wayne Miller, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man being mentored by the federal 
government to become an Indigenous leader in Ceduna, spoke in favour of the 
card during Turnbull’s visit and in the lead-up to the trial, taking part in 
photo opportunities with Tudge. When Guardian Australia contacted him for 
comment, Miller declined, insisting he was not an expert on the card or the 
best person to speak to on the topic.

I don’t think there is any one single silver bullet to these problems but it’s 
an important part of the broader solution
Ian Trust 
Another supporter of the card, Ian Trust, is the founding chair of the Wunan 
Foundation, an Aboriginal development organisation in the East Kimberley. He 
says something had to be done to address the devastating impact of alcohol and 
gambling in his community, and the card was one measure helping to do that.

Although he acknowledges there have been cases of businesses and individuals 
exploiting those on the card, he says that like any new program,it will have to 
be refined. The card was never supposed to solve all the problems in his 
community.

“I don’t think there is any one single silver bullet to these problems but 
it’s an important part of the broader solution,” he says.

“Since the introduction of the card, the streets in Wyndham and Kununurra are 
a lot quieter than usual. By and large the data indicates this has been 
positive for the community.”

He says people are now spending their money on fresh food rather than using it 
to buy and abuse drugs or to gamble. “The result of that drinking and gambling 
was neglected children growing up with foetal alcohol syndrome and domestic 
violence,” he says.

In conjunction with the card, work has begun on the “100 jobs project” which 
he hopes will be implemented early this year and will encourage businesses to 
hire Aboriginal people.

“If all your role models are people who have always been on welfare it is hard 
to break out of that,” he says. “But if all of a sudden someone in your family 
is getting paid it opens up a whole new dimension in people’s thinking about 
what is possible and, one by one, other people might change. We might be able, 
ultimately, to change the face of Kununurra and Wyndham through these range of 
programs.”

Warren Mundine looks back: 'Tony Abbott was a whirlwind'

<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/31/indigenous-australia-warren-mundine-treaty-consultation>
The chair of the government’s Indigenous advisory council, Warren Mundine, 
says when the concept of the card was flagged, council members “weren’t fully 
sold on the idea”.

But it was clear that the government under the former prime minister, Tony 
Abbott, was going down that road, he says.

“So we supported it but we said, ‘OK, if you’re going to do that, then this is 
how you should do it. One, it should be anti-discriminatory, you know, and you 
need to roll out the testing of it before you actually spread it out to the 
whole of Australian society, because we believe that you just can’t target 
Aboriginal people with it, you know, you’ve got to do something 
non-discriminatory.’ ”

The card is still in its early days, he says, but he wants to wait for more 
data before making a judgment.

“We have got to confront a number of issues that the debit card looks at in 
regard to the alcohol levels in Aboriginal communities, and I challenge anyone 
who can’t see the problems that are happening in Aboriginal communities,” he 
says.

Responding to comments that it had been imposed on the community, Mundine says 
no measure would ever receive total support.

“So it’s about what is the best thing and then learn the issues that you need 
to address,” he says. “Like, in the first place it was looking at 100% of the 
money going on the card, and at the end of it it was just a bit too difficult 
for people because they need cash.

It’s our money. We want to see cash, not a card. We want to spend time with 
our family in the pub too
Greg Peters 
“There’s a lot of things that will be negative about in regard to the 
unforeseen things that you haven’t looked at, but there will be other things 
that will be positive about it as well.”

But Greg Peters, a member of the Oak Valley Maralinga Tjarutja council, says 
he struggles to see any positives to the card, which he and many members of his 
family have been given.

Aboriginal people in his community describe feeling disempowered and 
voiceless, saying those with alcohol and gambling problems had found ways to 
get around the card and those without problems were being affected by receiving 
only 20% of their payment in cash. There are also fears that those with 
drinking problems will be placed at higher risk, going to more extreme measures 
to obtain alcohol and to hide their use of it.

“It’s our money,” Peters says. “We want to see cash, not a card. We want to 
spend time with our family in the pub too. The card is no good for our people.

“The government should come and talk to people in their land. Turnbull was 
talking to people on the other side. They never went to Yalata or Oak Valley. 
They only spoke to people they know in the community, but they should contact 
the old community.”

Peters’ daughter, Deb Queama (pictured at top), also from Oak Valley, says she 
doesn’t have the autonomy to buy a new car for her family. When she tried to do 
so using the card, she was declined. But the only businesses that are supposed 
to be prevented from receiving payments from the card are those selling alcohol 
and gambling products.

“I had enough money on the card but I couldn’t use it,” she says.

Peters says being on the card is like being placed on a ration. This is 
particularly painful to him because white pastoralists gave his ancestors 
rations of food, rather than wages, in return for their labour. It eroded many 
of the traditional hunting, gathering and eating practices of Aboriginal 
people, forcing them on to diets of less nutritious food.

“But we’re not in the old days,” Peters says. “We’re looking forward now. How 
can we go back to ration days? You tell the prime minister to come out here and 
talk to Mr Peters. I’ve got a lot more to say, and I’ll talk to him.”
