One last one

Nielav <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12996508> asks:

Is the picture of the TV industry painted in ‘Episodes’ anywhere close to 
reality? PS: Will we be treated to a 5th season?

It's very close. David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik who have created some of the 
best known American TV sitcoms (you might have heard of Friends or Mad About 
You) have always said that when writing Episodes, they were writing for 
revenge. What's wonderfully ironic is that the people working in the industry 
haven't recognised themselves. What's also wonderful is that the show is 
actually being made, so there is hope there is a quiet sense of irony alive and 
kicking in Hollywood.

As for a fifth season, we're waiting to hear.

Thank you for all your questions (and some statements). Sorry I've not been 
able to answer more, but if you're really serious about getting answers, I can 
be found nightly and afternoonly on Wednesdays and Saturdays at the Playhouse 
theatre in the musical version of Pedro Almodovar's Women on the Verge of a 
Nervous Breakdown. But you have to see the show before you ask the question.

We have an exceptionally talented bunch of women in Women on the Verge. I am 
overawed by their breadth of talent, knowledge, experience, and extraordinary 
welcome. Just by standing close to them, I'm hoping that their talent will rub 
off on me. There's no price on experience, but I think I may be pickpocketing 
from them. I think their courage to push the boundaries of musical expression 
is really inspiring. I've learned to sing the songs and now we're playing I'm 
hoping that I will learn to let the songs sing me.

How lovely. You're right, it's not much of a question. In fact, I don't 
believe it's a question at all, is it? However, your statement is lovingly 
received. That was a wonderful experience, working with Stephen Frears on the 
film version of Posy Simmonds' graphic novel. My character Beth witnesses her 
husband being trampled by a rampaging herd of cattle. This sounds really funny 
but as with most things that sound really funny, it was also rather 
heartbreaking. Stephen Frears said about the film that it was a rare bird 
because it dealt with the English middle classes, a section of the population 
who are rarely shown any interest. He also says this is probably because the 
middle class hate themselves. The word "middle: in itself has a whiff of 
mediocrity about it. But it is a delightful film because it upturns the stone 
most often overlooked.

'Comedies are very rarely put up for Baftas or Oscars...We're under the false

Ken Ward <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10441922> asks:

I love your varied areas of work. Was this an early decision to progress your 
career or complete luck/chance?

I feel incredibly grateful to have been offered the variety of work I have 
been. My agent works tirelessly to make sure that I'm not tarred with the brush 
of "the comic actor". Some of my most fulfilling roles have been serious: Edith 
Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank, Beth in White Heat, Constance in King John, 
DCI Maggie Brown in The Guilty. Human beings are funny and tragic, and to have 
the opportunity to explore both realms is a privilege.

I think we have got a fantastic array of female actors who can do both: Olivia 
Coleman, Julie Walters and Sheridan Smith to name but three are brilliant at 
bridging both realms. Weirdly, we are stuck in a contradiction. Comedy is very 
hard but it doesn't seem to be taken so seriously. It's interesting that 
comedies are very rarely put up for Baftas or Oscars. I think we are under the 
false impression that if something is serious, it can be taken seriously. But I 
don't think we need to divide the two realms. What's interesting to me is that 
acting is about finding the truth of a character, and good actors will do that 
work regardless of whether is something is labelled comedy or tragedy.

'Mark Heap is unbearable to work with'

Mark Heap is unbearable to work with. Very early on when we were making Green 
Wing they decided not to put me in scenes with him, because near him I cannot 
control myself. Even now, more than a decade on, when I am near him when 
filming Friday Night Dinner I have an immediate convulsive response. There are 
scenes in some episodes where they cannot cut round me laughing so they do 
actually appear in the show. I'm trying to disguise the fact, but very poorly. 
He is a genius.

What was it about the part of Pepa in Women on the Verge of a Nervous 
Breakdown that appealed to you?
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14569780> Guardian contributor
TamsinGreig  <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14569780> 03 March 
2015 1:42pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/48326961> 
I love the fact that Pepa is a woman of a certain age who seems to have 
arrived, and should know what's going on. She is however taken to the very edge 
of herself and I think for all human beings, that's a very profound place to 
find yourself. Looking into the abyss and deciding whether it will be breakdown 
or breakthrough. I love the fact that she comes to that point of choosing. When 
we remember we have a choice, and how we respond to things: I think that's 
where our freedom lies.

There are also some really good jokes in it.

I did go to Madrid before rehearsals and prepared myself to meet with the true 
Spanish spirit, by going to see Real Madrid play at the Bernabeu stadium 
followed by a late night flamenco club. There was a very similar spirit of 
passion, vision, rhythm, and grace. It was brilliant.

I’m fascinated that you played Constance in King John and Beatrice in Much Ado 
About Nothing, two roles which are seemingly worlds apart, in combination with 
each other. Was it a really difficult juggling act, or were you able to find 
some common ground or overlap in terms of what these characters demanded of you 
as an actor? Sorry to bring you all the way back to 2006!

It was an extraordinary opportunity, when I joined the RSC for that season, to 
experience Shakespeare in that way. I was directed by two wonderful women 
directors Marianne Elliott and Josie Rourke who have both established 
extraordinary careers for themselves.

Constance was a heartbreaking woman, full of fire and bile, but with a 
necessary yearning for justice. She's actually not that far removed from 
Beatrice, because however comic a character Beatrice seems, she is fuelled by a 
cleverly disguised fire of outrage at injustice. So the two seemed different 
and of course they are, but there are elements of deep grief in both. In each 
production, what's interesting is which colours you use to reveal the grief. It 
was a wonderful year.

When I was first approached to play the part I laughed and said no. But the 
producers went on a stealthy wooing campaign and I was given an almighty array 
of extraordinary artists, singing teachers, vocal coaches, musical directors, 
laryngeal osteopaths, and speech therapists to help me find my voice. It was 
quite an undertaking. So I began a year-long journey of lessons and exercises. 
Always thinking inside that I probably wouldn't be able to do it.

I'd never sung professionally before and the thought of singing nine songs, 
four of which are alone, filled me with genuine terror. And even now we're into 
the 80th performance, there's still a tiny voice that says: what do you think 
you're doing! But it's a naughty voice. It's thrilling and challenging and 
brings great delight to me.

What do you like most about playing Pepa?

Pepa is the part that I play in the musical version of Almodovar's film Women 
on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. She is a Spanish actress who is 
unceremoniously dumped by her lover Ivan by leaving her a message on her 
answering machine, so Pepa goes on a journey to find out what's happened. And 
she is fuelled by confusion, rage, grief, hilarity and despair. And finally 
reaches a place of hope.

So it's a wonderful journey to go on, and really thrilling that a woman's 
story is being told in that way, surrounded by so many other great female 
characters on a contemporary stage. I think it's very unusual for a show to end 
with nine female characters singing together on stage, a song of a great hope 
and longing. And surely there should be more.

Pedro is an extraordinary artist, with unimaginable generosity and vision and 
playfulness. He claims no ownership over any of his work, and is only delighted 
when the characters he brought to life initially, continue to find their ways 
in new outings. So it was thrilling to work with him, and to experience a 
little of his kindness and delight.

When he was asked why he is so interested in women, he said: when I was 
growing up in Spain in the 50s I was surrounded by women who made a great 
impression on me. They were the women who saved Spain after the civil war, so I 
have a great heart for women. So being around an artist who is so adept at 
storytelling but also has such great heart is a great privilege.

It's very close. David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik who have created some of the 
best known American TV sitcoms (you might have heard of Friends or Mad About 
You) have always said that when writing Episodes, they were writing for 
revenge. What's wonderfully ironic is that the people working in the industry 
haven't recognised themselves. What's also wonderful is that the show is 
actually being made, so there is hope there is a quiet sense of irony alive and 
kicking in Hollywood.

As for a fifth season, we're waiting to hear.

Thank you for all your questions (and some statements). Sorry I've not been 
able to answer more, but if you're really serious about getting answers, I can 
be found nightly and afternoonly on Wednesdays and Saturdays at the Playhouse 
theatre in the musical version of Pedro Almodovar's Women on the Verge of a 
Nervous Breakdown. But you have to see the show before you ask the question.

We have an exceptionally talented bunch of women in Women on the Verge. I am

welcome. Just by standing close to them, I'm hoping that their talent will rub 
off on me. There's no price on experience, but I think I may be pickpocketing 
from them. I think their courage to push the boundaries of musical expression 
is really inspiring. I've learned to sing the songs and now we're playing I'm 
hoping that I will learn to let the songs sing me.

How lovely. You're right, it's not much of a question. In fact, I don't 
believe it's a question at all, is it? However, your statement is lovingly 
received. That was a wonderful experience, working with Stephen Frears on the 
film version of Posy Simmonds' graphic novel. My character Beth witnesses her 
husband being trampled by a rampaging herd of cattle. This sounds really funny 
but as with most things that sound really funny, it was also rather 
heartbreaking. Stephen Frears said about the film that it was a rare bird 
because it dealt with the English middle classes, a section of the population 
who are rarely shown any interest. He also says this is probably because the 
middle class hate themselves. The word "middle: in itself has a whiff of 
mediocrity about it. But it is a delightful film because it upturns the stone 
most often overlooked.

I feel incredibly grateful to have been offered the variety of work I have 
been. My agent works tirelessly to make sure that I'm not tarred with the brush 
of "the comic actor". Some of my most fulfilling roles have been serious: Edith 
Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank, Beth in White Heat, Constance in King John, 
DCI Maggie Brown in The Guilty. Human beings are funny and tragic, and to have 
the opportunity to explore both realms is a privilege.

I think we have got a fantastic array of female actors who can do both: Olivia 
Coleman, Julie Walters and Sheridan Smith to name but three are brilliant at 
bridging both realms. Weirdly, we are stuck in a contradiction. Comedy is very 
hard but it doesn't seem to be taken so seriously. It's interesting that 
comedies are very rarely put up for Baftas or Oscars. I think we are under the 
false impression that if something is serious, it can be taken seriously. But I 
don't think we need to divide the two realms. What's interesting to me is that 
acting is about finding the truth of a character, and good actors will do that 
work regardless of whether is something is labelled comedy or tragedy.

Mark Heap is unbearable to work with. Very early on when we were making Green 
Wing they decided not to put me in scenes with him, because near him I cannot 
control myself. Even now, more than a decade on, when I am near him when 
filming Friday Night Dinner I have an immediate convulsive response. There are 
scenes in some episodes where they cannot cut round me laughing so they do 
actually appear in the show. I'm trying to disguise the fact, but very poorly. 
He is a genius.

I love the fact that Pepa is a woman of a certain age who seems to have 
arrived, and should know what's going on. She is however taken to the very edge 
of herself and I think for all human beings, that's a very profound place to 
find yourself. Looking into the abyss and deciding whether it will be breakdown 
or breakthrough. I love the fact that she comes to that point of choosing. When 
we remember we have a choice, and how we respond to things: I think that's 
where our freedom lies.

There are also some really good jokes in it.

show called series or season? I expect there’ll be four seasons if there is.

Who knows? It's a good thought. Followed up by another offshoot called Box 
Set. And finishing with a finale called Laughing All The Way To The Bank.

When did you find out that Johnny Marr had his guitar tuned to open E for the 
rhythm part on The Headmaster Ritual? I found out about a year ago. I suppose 
my question is are you in favour of open tunings?

I've just found out. I'm horrified. How is that possible? I've always thought 
that closed tunings were the way forward. Thank you for setting me straight.

I’m fascinated that you played Constance in King John and Beatrice in Much Ado 
About Nothing, two roles which are seemingly worlds apart, in combination with 
each other. Was it a really difficult juggling act, or were you able to find 
some common ground or overlap in terms of what these characters demanded of you 
as an actor? Sorry to bring you all the way back to 2006!

It was an extraordinary opportunity, when I joined the RSC for that season, to 
experience Shakespeare in that way. I was directed by two wonderful women 
directors Marianne Elliott and Josie Rourke who have both established 
extraordinary careers for themselves.

Constance was a heartbreaking woman, full of fire and bile, but with a 
necessary yearning for justice. She's actually not that far removed from 
Beatrice, because however comic a character Beatrice seems, she is fuelled by a 
cleverly disguised fire of outrage at injustice. So the two seemed different 
and of course they are, but there are elements of deep grief in both. In each 
production, what's interesting is which colours you use to reveal the grief. It 
was a wonderful year.

How did you prepare vocally for the part of Pepa in Women on the Verge of a 
Nervous Breakdown?

When I was first approached to play the part I laughed and said no. But the 
producers went on a stealthy wooing campaign and I was given an almighty array 
of extraordinary artists, singing teachers, vocal coaches, musical directors, 
laryngeal osteopaths, and speech therapists to help me find my voice. It was 
quite an undertaking. So I began a year-long journey of lessons and exercises. 
Always thinking inside that I probably wouldn't be able to do it.

I'd never sung professionally before and the thought of singing nine songs, 
four of which are alone, filled me with genuine terror. And even now we're into 
the 80th performance, there's still a tiny voice that says: what do you think 
you're doing! But it's a naughty voice. It's thrilling and challenging and 
brings great delight to me.

What do you like most about playing Pepa?

Pepa is the part that I play in the musical version of Almodovar's film Women 
on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. She is a Spanish actress who is 
unceremoniously dumped by her lover Ivan by leaving her a message on her 
answering machine, so Pepa goes on a journey to find out what's happened. And 
she is fuelled by confusion, rage, grief, hilarity and despair. And finally 
reaches a place of hope.

So it's a wonderful journey to go on, and really thrilling that a woman's 
story is being told in that way, surrounded by so many other great female 
characters on a contemporary stage. I think it's very unusual for a show to end 
with nine female characters singing together on stage, a song of a great hope 
and longing. And surely there should be more.

Pedro is an extraordinary artist, with unimaginable generosity and vision and 
playfulness. He claims no ownership over any of his work, and is only delighted 
when the characters he brought to life initially, continue to find their ways 
in new outings. So it was thrilling to work with him, and to experience a 
little of his kindness and delight.

When he was asked why he is so interested in women, he said: when I was 
growing up in Spain in the 50s I was surrounded by women who made a great 
impression on me. They were the women who saved Spain after the civil war, so I 
have a great heart for women. So being around an artist who is so adept at 
storytelling but also has such great heart is a great privilege.

Lemon curd. You think it's sweet, but it's got a hefty after-twang.
