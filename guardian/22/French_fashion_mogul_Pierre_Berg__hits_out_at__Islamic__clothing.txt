Bergé took aim at the big fashion chains that have followed the Italian 
designers Dolce & Gabbana in catering specifically to the Muslim market.

“I am scandalised,” the 85-year-old told French radio station Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 1 on Wednesday.

“Creators should have nothing to do with Islamic fashion. Designers are there 
to make women more beautiful, to give them their freedom, not to collaborate 
with this dictatorship which imposes this abominable thing by which we hide 
women and make them live a hidden life.

“These creators who are taking part in the enslavement of women should ask 
themselves some questions.”

He declared: “Renounce the money and have some principles.”

Earlier this year Dolce & Gabbana became the first major western brand to 
openly aim at capturing a corner of the Islamic fashion market – estimated to 
be worth $260bn (£180bn) – with its abaya range. It included 14 abayas or 
ankle-length dresses, which it matched with embroidered headscarves and hijabs.

The Swedish giant H&M followed their lead, using a veiled Muslim woman in its 
advertising campaign, with the Japanese brand Uniqlo earlier this month 
announcing it would begin selling hijabs in its London stores.

Marks & Spencer has also put its toe in the water, marketing full-body 
“burkini” swimming costumes in its online store.
