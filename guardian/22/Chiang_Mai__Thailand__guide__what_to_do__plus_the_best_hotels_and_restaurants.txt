With long, leafy boulevards, Chiang Mai presents an alluring alternative to 
the Thai capital, Bangkok. Instead of traffic-choked urban sprawl, travellers 
find a picturesque downtown easily navigated on foot, where the air is clean 
and the climate mercifully cool. A short bike or scooter ride out of the town 
leads to a densely rainforested countryside interspersed with waterfalls. Since 
the local airport received an upgrade in 2014, more regional flights have been 
heading to this serene city, making it cheaper and easier to reach.

The old town, inside its moat, is an extraordinary vision. Here amid the 
30-odd temple spires, barefoot monks in flame-coloured robes collect alms in 
the morning and street vendors sell their wares by night.

Contrary to what all the English-language signs offering yoga courses and 
trekking tours might have you believe, the ancient capital city harbours a 
vibrant contemporary scene. A spate of new galleries, co-working spaces and 
artsy cafes are giving creative people space to showcase their work.

Unlike many modern Asian cities, where such harbingers of gentrification have 
pushed traditional shops and street food hawkers out of the picture, Chiang 
Mai’s younger generation continues to embrace its older establishments. 
Bare-bones eateries serving fiery, northern dishes likelaab (minced meat salad) 
brimming with mint, dried spices and fresh blood, orsua ue, an herbaceous 
grilled sausage perfumed with lemongrass and served with fingerfuls of sticky 
rice, still stand proudly next to modern cafes and bars.

To visit the city’s modern side, head just beyond the centre to studenty 
Nimmanhaemin Road, with its boutiques, galleries, coffee shops and myriad 
restaurants. The pace of life may have speeded up in recent years as the city’s 
grown, but Chiang Mai is still a city of quiet charms, best absorbed at a 
leisurely pace.

 Fields of plenty … visitors to the Chiang Mai Thai Farm Cooking School select 
herbs. 
Although Thai massage can be a shock to first-timers, the after-effects of 
being forcibly contorted into pretzel shapes can be wondrous. Pick up a few 
tricks from the pros by registering at one of the training centres in town.Thai 
Massage School Shivagakomarpaj  <http://thaimassageschool.ac.th/>(courses from 
£36) in the Old Medicine Hospital stands out for its comprehensive courses in 
history, concept and technique. More than 20,000 students, half of them 
foreigners, have studied there since it opened in 1962. A full introductory 
course lasts five days, but there’s a two-day foot massage course or a one-day 
herbal hot compress course, using healing herbs gathered in a cloth bundle and 
applied to pressure points.

If you’d rather improve your culinary prowess, there are dozens of cooking 
schools in the city. A lesson at boutique hotel137 Pillars House 
<http://www.snhcollection.com/137pillarshouse/> (£46pp) includes a trip to 
Thanin market and instruction by a top chef. For a more budget option, the
Chiang Mai Thai Farm Cooking School <http://thaifarmcooking.net/home/#.VvE> 
(£24, including food and transfers) offers hands-on, small-group classes with 
individual cooking stations. Participants stop at the nearby Ruam Chok market 
before visiting an organic farm to stroll in the fields and take a crash course 
in ingredients such as jackfruit, holy basil and bitter eggplant, then get to 
work pounding curry paste with a mortar and pestle.

 The Elephant nature park serves as a sanctuary 
Selfie-snapping tourists have come under fire in recent years for posting 
pictures of themselves cuddling tiger cubs or riding elephants. But there are 
still plenty of ways to get up close and personal with nature ethically.
Elephant Nature Park <http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/>, some 40 miles from 
Chiang Mai, has been rescuing and rehabilitating pachyderms since the 1990s. 
Visitors can spend the day feeding, swimming with and walking alongside the 
contented herd in their 200-acre habitat. Got a little extra time and cash? 
Consider a week-longhomestay in a Karen village 
<http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/enp/en/visit-volunteer/projects/viewproperty/journey-to-freedom-weekly-volunteer/47>
 helping with reforestation, animal vaccinations and farming. A one-day package 
costs £46; the full week, with Journey to Freedom, costs £275, with full-board.

Support the arts

Chiang Mai fosters a small but steadily growing community of artists and 
designers. Join the city’s creative crowd any evening atThapae East 
<https://www.facebook.com/ThapaeEast>, a hip space decked out in exposed brick 
that hosts everything from poetry readings to indie concerts. Or check out 
exhibitions spotlighting local talent at the newGallery Kang Wat 
<http://gallerykangwat.tumblr.com/> in Baan Kang Wat, an artists’ village and 
craft showcase near Wat Ram Poeng.Hern Gallery 
<https://www.facebook.com/herngallery> (1/3 Padat Road) is a recently opened 
offshoot of theGallery Seescape <https://www.facebook.com/galleryseescape>, on 
a bend of the Ping river south of the old town.

Hit the markets 
 The city’s outdoor bazaars are a ‘riot of sounds and smells’. Photograph:

Chiang Mai’s outdoor bazaars are a riot of sounds, and smells. When dusk 
falls, prowl forgai yang (grilled chicken), khao kha moo (pork shank braised 
with star anise) andkanom jin (rice noodles with curry) on Chang Khlan Road 
every evening. Pick up silver jewellery and other handicrafts onWualai Road on 
a Saturday and save a few hours on Sunday to browse onRatchadamnoen Avenue. For 
a market with more locals and fewer bootleg DVDs, rise early and go to the 
smaller Somphet Market on Moon Muang Road.

See the best of the temples

One glance at the regal Wat Phra Singh (the temple of the lion Buddha) 
explains the crowds it attracts. But don’t missWat Chedi Luang, also in the old 
centre, where visitors can chat casually with monks about Buddhism, life, the 
universe and everything. Established in the late 13th century,Wat Chiang Man is 
not only impressive as the city’s oldest temple, but also for its two immense 
Buddha statues. One of the most revered shrines is across the Ping river:Wat 
Chedi Liam, part of Wiang Kum Kam, the ruins of the Lanna empire’s original 
capital. At the temples, remember to dress modestly.

After a few days in the city, the lure of the jungle beyond is hard to resist. 
Virtually every guesthouse will try to convince you to go on a trek, and with 
so many similar itineraries – rafting, elephants, hill tribe encounters – 
picking the right one can be a challenge.Tiger Trail Outdoor Adventures 
<http://www.green-trails.com/> (two-day treks from £67) is a socially 
responsible tour operator that has been organising treks in south-east Asia 
since 2000. Private treks are available, but group tours never exceed 10. Or try

By day, this swish spot serves mild-mannered staples like spaghetti and

With a former head chef of the ultra-luxe Dhara Dhevi (previously a Mandarin

ambitious (and pricey) side. Arthit Dissunont or “Chef O” shows finesse with

most with inventive Thai fusion such as lamb shank braised in Penang curry (£6) 
or seared tuna loin on a bed of lemongrass and green mango (£8).

Drinks are dirt cheap but delicious at this dive bar par excellence, thanks to

The Service 1921 Restaurant & Bar


Housed in the grandly refurbished former British Consulate, this slick number 
is the place to indulge in single malts, Cuban cigars and all manner of 
martinis. At £5-£6 each, cocktails like the Pomelo Julep, a zingy concoction 
spiked with tangerine, pomegranate syrup and dehydrated limes, or Tea Time, 
with Earl Grey-infused vodka, are pricier than at the local bucket bars, but

room accessed via a hidden door in one of the bookshelves.

In case the 60 types of single-origin beans decorating the walls and the 
powerhouse of a roaster didn’t tip you off, this Bangkok import takes its 
coffee seriously. In fact, its so committed to caffeine that aspiring baristas 
can sign up for intensive courses.

Beer Republic 


Gone are the days when Singha and Chang were the only brews in this 
increasingly cosmopolitan town. This popular pub offers 50 international beers, 
15 of which are on tap on any given evening, as well as the occasional draught 
cider. Burgers, fries and other greasy fare help soak up all the suds.
