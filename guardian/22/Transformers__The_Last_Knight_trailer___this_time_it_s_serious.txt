The title of Transformers: The Last Knight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/transformers--the-last-knight> carries a 
certain finality to it. And that makes sense. After all, the franchise is now a 
decade old, and the appeal of watching indistinguishable robots punch each 
other interminably wore off about three and a half films ago, so it makes sense 
for the series to wrap itself up before the wheels come off completely.


The first Transformers: The Last Knight trailer shares a similar air of 
finality. Could this really be the end? Let’s take a closer look.

This certainly looks final, doesn’t it? I mean, blood dripping from a crucifix 
isn’t the sort of imagery you can just drop midway into a franchise that’s 
historically been largely about urinating robots and girls in tight shorts. No, 
this feels serious. This feels like the end of something.

As does this. The first half of the trailer is almost exclusively concerned 
with the entire history of human violence. We see soldiers creeping through the 
woods with flaming arrows. We see knights on horseback. And we see the rise of 
nazism. This isn’t going to be any old Transformers movie. No, this one has 
something important to say about the human condition.

And, more final than anything, we see the frozen carcass of Optimus Prime 
spinning through space. Our hero is dead. All our heroes will die. This is the 
end, make no mistake of that.

This just cements the new, serious Transformers. The first Transformers film 
had Megan Fox bending over a car in a pair of tight shorts. Transformers 5, 
meanwhile, hasSir Anthony Hopkins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/anthony-hopkins> waxing poetical in a church 
about the nature of sacrifice. This is going to be a very powerful, very 
serious meditation on some very big themes.

Themes like the individual’s ability to effect profound societal change, as 
evidenced by this scene of Bumblebee punching a military drone unit in the 
face. Bumblebee is us, you see, rising up against an increasingly totalitarian 
state.

And, yes, admittedly this does just look like Mark Wahlberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-wahlberg> firing a giant gun in a really 
cool way. But, you know, maybe the gun represents society. Did you ever think 
of that?

And there’s quite a lot about this one really cool robot with a massive sword 
who swings it around a lot and it’s all like “Raaaargh!” I mean, you probably 
don’t need to concentrate too hard on why a giant metal robot needs to have a 
sword as a weapon, because that’d ultimately be the same as watching two 
medieval knights joust with uncooked sausages. But, anyway, look, it’s really 
cool and stuff.

BLAM! Take THAT, police car! That gun was all like DUGGA DUGGA DUGGA and the 
police car was all POW I’M GETTING OUT OF HERE andMark Wahlberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-wahlberg> is going HEEE HEEE HEEE and 
this is all so cool and it’s probably an allegory for Guantanamo Bay or 
something but mainly OH WOW FIRE.

And Optimus Prime isn’t dead either! That was just a fakeout! Optimus Prime 
will never die. Never ever. And this isn’t the last Transformers film, either. 
There’s going to be this one, and then the year after that Bumblebee is getting 
his own spin-off, and then the year after that there’s going to be another 
Transformers film. These films make a billion dollars each. Why would they stop 
making them? Now STAB HIM, OPTIMUS PRIME! STAB HIM REAL GOOD! WHEE!
