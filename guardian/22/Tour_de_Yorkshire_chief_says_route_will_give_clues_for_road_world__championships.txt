Sir Gary Verity has told cycling fans they can start studying Tour de Yorkshire
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tour-de-yorkshire> routes for hints as to 
where the road world championships will take place in 2019.

Verity announced the six locations that will host either starts or finishes of 
next year’s Tour de Yorkshire on Tuesday – Bradford, Bridlington, Fox Valley, 
on the outskirts of Sheffield, Harrogate, Scarborough and Tadcaster. The race 
will take place from 28 to 30 April, with the full route to be announced on 2 
December.

Yorkshire was confirmed as the host

 for the world championships two weeks ago, largely on the back of the huge 
success of the Grand Depart of the Tour de France in 2014 and its legacy event, 
the Tour de Yorkshire.

“Every edition of the Tour de Yorkshire now will in essence be dress 
rehearsals for those races,” Verity, the chief executive of Tour de Yorkshire 
organisers Welcome To Yorkshire, said of the world championships.

The routes for 2019 are 90% mapped out, and all races will finish in 
Harrogate, with starts spread out across all four corners of the county.

Verity said the clues as to where the race might go could all be found in the 
roads used over the last three years – and those soon to come.

“When those routes are formally announced for 2019, if you look back at what 
we had for the Tour de France and what we’ve had for the different editions of 
the Tour de Yorkshire, you’ll understand what we were doing,” Verity said. 
“We’re still testing some stuff to see if it will all work, and what we need to 
do slightly better.”

Verity had hoped to be naming eight places, not six, but the bid to expand the 
Tour to four days has again been rebuffed by BritishCycling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling> for 2017, perhaps a missed 
opportunity with the 2019 announcement increasing global interest in the race.

“That’s just raised it to another level now,” Verity said. “Everybody knows 
the centre of the cycling world at the end of this decade will be Yorkshire.”

The decision is in British Cycling’s hands and Verity said there are hopes of 
making it happen in time for the 2018 race.

“We’re good to go as soon as we get the nod,” he said. There’s no shortage of 
demand. We’ve had 15 places who wanted a start or a finish so it’s not as if we 
would have nowhere to go.”

With demand high, the inclusion of Scarborough for a third straight edition 
stands out. The opening stage of the first Tour and the final stage of this 
year’s event both finished in the town’s North Bay, and with the peloton 
heading back there again Scarborough has a chance to forge an ever stronger 
place within the race’s identity.

“I would love to go there every year,” Verity said. “Obviously that’s for the 
powers that be in Scarborough to think about but it’s a great location, an 
iconic location, and whether we do a start or a finish it’s a fantastic 
backdrop which lends itself to a great bike race. We have to fit in the 
landmarks, Scarborough is one and we have to make sure that becomes part of our 
DNA for this race.”

How the dots will be joined remains to be seen but Verity promised another 
route which would ensure the overall winner of the men’s race is not known 
until the final day, while the women’s race will again take place over the same 
parcours used by the men on the middle day.

He said: “We’ll have a hilly route for the first stage this time, a shorter 
stage for the second day, not pan-flat this time but one a sprinter could win. 
Then, for the third stage, I think we had 2,600m of climbing on the third day 
last time and this will be over 3,000m of climbs so it will be even more 
brutal.”
