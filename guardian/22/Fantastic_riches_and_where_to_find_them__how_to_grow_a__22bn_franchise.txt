A film franchise is like a shark: it must keep moving forward or die. Now that 
the goldmine of Harry Potter has been largely exhausted after eight 
phenomenally successful films, the baton has been picked up byFantastic Beasts 
and Where to Find Them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/13/fantastic-beasts-review-jk-rowling-eddie-redmayne-harry-potter>
. Fantastic Beasts is not simply a new outpost of the Harry Potter empire, it 
is a key plank in the extension of a “universe” that has given itself 
considerable elbow room with its retooled brand-name, The Wizarding World of JK 
Rowling. Encompassing films, books, videogames, websites and theme-parks, the 
Wizarding World is one of the most valuable brands in the entertainment 
industry.

Conceived and written by Rowling herself (and taking its cue from the Hogwarts 
school textbook mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone), 
Fantastic Beasts wasquickly reconfigured as a five-film series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/13/jk-rowling-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-franchise>
, starring Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne as its “magizoologist” protagonist, Newt 
Scamander. Rowling has set the film in the US, from where the vast majority of 
the Wizarding World’s revenue has so far derived.

Box office analysts 
<http://variety.com/2016/film/box-office/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-box-office-1201902424/>
 in the US are suggesting it will open there on $75m or so, far lower than 
Deathly Hallows 2’s $169m – but Fantastic Beasts, of course, doesn’t have a
huge-selling series of books <https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter> 
behind it to bolster its central character. Still, says David Hancock, senior 
cinema analyst for IHS, a franchise slowdown is nowhere in sight: “The studios 
are looking to achieve more financial control over what they do. With 
franchises they can plan ahead: five years, 10 years.”

In some ways, Potter has been the template for this: a structured series of 
entertainments with seemingly endless opportunities for cross-platforming and 
repurposing for a huge (and fanatical) fanbase. Hancock says: “WithoutHarry 
Potter <https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter> I don’t think you’d have 
the Marvel films, the new Star Wars series or Star Trek operating in the same 
way. But the films wouldn’t be made without the merchandising; that can make 
more than the box office.”

’s manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was famously sold to 
Bloomsbury for a £2,500 advance; it was published in June 1997 with a 500-copy 
print run (most of which were sent to libraries). The following year, 
Scholastic published it in the US and Canada (with a change of title, to 
Sorcerer’s Stone), after paying $105,000 for the rights. The sales figures over 
the years have been eye-watering: Philosopher’s Stone is among the 10 
bestselling books of all time, with 450m copies of the seriesreportedly sold up 
to 2013 
<http://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-k--rowling-s-magic-touch-sends-harry-potter-sales-booming-180159853.html>
. The totals have been bumped up by constant reissues, box sets and “adult 
editions”, as well as colouring books, jigsaw books, audiobooks and pull-out 
posters; the most recent figures from AC Nielsen suggest that sales in the UK 
currently stand at around £270m (part of a non-US tally of around $504m). But 
the giant share has been in the US, which isestimated to have earned $7.7bn

initially interested; however he dropped out to make AI: Artificial 
Intelligence, and the job went toChris Columbus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/26/chris-columbus-childrens-novel-house-secrets>
. Seven Potter books became eight films (the last one, Deathly Hallows, was cut 
in two, in a franchise-prolonging move copied by Twilight and The Hunger 
Games). In total, the series has taken $7.7bn worldwide – with the final entry,
Deathly Hallows Part 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/07/harry-potter-deathly-hallows-part-2-review>

third most successful franchise at the US box office, behind Marvel and Star 
Wars.Fantastic Beasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them> will

Photograph: Phelan Ebenhack/Alamy 
For decades, Disney has dominated the theme-park market, but in the last five 
years Universal has staged a healthy comeback after acquiring rights to The 
Wizarding World of Harry Potter. As TWWHP acts as a “land”, or a subworld, of 
each larger Universal resort it is attached to, it’s hard to directly measure 
its revenue. Butreports suggest 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/harry-potter-conjures-comeback-for-universals-parks-1460512158>
 that since the first TWWHP opened at Universal’s Orlando park in Florida, the 
company has added $1.8bn to its revenue; this has to be set against the $250m 
each TWWHP costs to build, the “tens of millions” in licensing fees and 12% of 
merchanding income said to be paid each year to Warner Bros. These are, 
however, not the same as thePotter-branded attraction at Leavesden studios 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2012/mar/14/harry-potter-studio-tour-in-pictures>
 just northwest of London, where the standing sets for the films were built and 
much of the shooting took place; this is a separate operation, run by Warner 
Bros, and is technically a studio tour, rather than a theme park. Opening in 
2012,it earned £57m in its first full year

The website set up by JK Rowling <https://www.pottermore.com/> in 2011 is the 
outlier in the Potter universe. Owned by Rowling herself, it presented itself 
as an official response to obsessive fan interest in the Potter books, giving 
users an inside experience of TWWHP. More cannily, it is the vehicle for the 
digital publishing rights that Rowling kept hold of personally, and where she 
places material not thought consequential enough for full book publication; it 
was also, for some time, the only place Rowling sold ebooks and audiobooks to 
readers. That function has, however, been opened up, andfigures show that

 last year its income dropped alarmingly, from £31m to £7m, for a £6m loss. The 
decline, apparently, was due to the end of a royalty agreement with Sony, which 
had been worth £24m the year before.

• This article was amended on 22 November 2016. Due to an error in working, 
the figure for the US sales ofHarry Potter and the Cursed Child 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child> was given 
as $624m; it has been corrected to $121m. The resulting total for plays has 
also been adjusted.
