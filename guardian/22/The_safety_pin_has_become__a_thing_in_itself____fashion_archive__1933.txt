The safety-pin is usually looked upon as having a humble role. It is used on 
anti-scratch lines for mere youth, while maturer years look upon it as a very 
present aid in time of trouble, and more shoulder-straps and more garters are 
established by means of safety-pins than most people would care to admit. 
Safety-pins have, however, grown in grace of recent years, and they may be had 
in colours – though these necessitate greater thickness - and also on little 
gold rings, without which assorted sizes no one would venture to travel and 
expect to enjoy the process.

The safety-pin seemed to reach its apotheosis when it was given at their 
christenings to babies in a gold version to fasten their bibs, even though the 
occasion for this had not yet appeared. Equally, it held in place the manly 
tie, and men felt greater and grander and nobler for its possession. Still, it 
was not general. The gold pin became purchasable for threepence, and perhaps 
the gold crisis caused the disappearance of the truly gold safety-pin in the 
interests of a vast number of shillings to the ounce.

The safety-pin has however, taken new life lately. Just as it is used to lock 
the Scotch kilt, so it has become an important part of the autumn fashion. 
Where bows and loops are tied everywhere at the neck, the safety-pin, often of 
copper, secures them once for all. Henna dresses may have a large copper 
safety-pin at the neck, which corresponds with a copper buckle. Grey dresses 
have safety-pins in chromium steel, with appropriate buttons or clasps. It does 
not matter which. Also the safety-pin has become “a thing in itself.” Three of 
it may be arranged in a straight line just above the belt and three below. It 
has arrived at the stage of pure ornament, with which no one can dispense this 
season.
