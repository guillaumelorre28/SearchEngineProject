Although pleased to read Helen Pidd’s otherwise excellent article on the 
number of statues of women under consideration (Britain to celebrate pioneering 
women with three new statues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/09/britain-statues-women-emmeline-pankhurst-ellen-wilkinson-victoria-wood>
, 9 January) the three women on the shortlist as sculptors of the Emmeline 
Pankhurst statue in Manchester are overlooked. One space on the shortlist was 
specifically reserved for a sculptor who has not been commissioned to produce a 
public statue. This is Amelia Rowcroft, renowned for her portraits and figures 
in museums. Also included are Hazel Reeves, who created the Sir Nigel Gresley 
statue at Kings Cross, daughter-and-father team, Roxy and Steve Winterburn, 
(the Billy Boston statue in Wigan), and Nick Roberson, whose works include 
Benedict Cumberbatch.
