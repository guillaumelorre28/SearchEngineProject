It’s almost as though we needed to endure contouring in order to get here, to 
July 2016, with the reaction trend “non-touring”. Where contouring required 
layers of foundation, blush and bronzer, plus a cache of YouTube tutorials, 
this light option asks only for a tinted moisturiser and a decent highlighter 
which you shimmer across your cheekbones, brow bone and nose. It should make 
you look like you, but through a flattering Instagram filter.
