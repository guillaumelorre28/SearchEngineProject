At the entrance to a disused Milanese train depot repurposed for the afternoon 
as a fairytale boudoir (plush seating cubes in buttoned pink velvet, strip-bar 
glitter curtains, a throaty undertone of dry ice), each guest arriving for the 
Gucci catwalk show was handed a pink piece of paper. On it was printed a quote 
byVladimir Nabokov <https://www.theguardian.com/books/vladimirnabokov>: 
“Literature was not born the day a boy crying ‘wolf, wolf’ came running out of 
the Neanderthal valley with a big grey wolf at his heels; literature was born 
on the day when a boy came crying ‘wolf, wolf’ and there was no wolf behind 
him.”

Alessandro Michele, Gucci’s creative director, likes to layer several 
characters into an outfit – he himself was dressed for the show in a 
distinctive Renaissance-biker style that theNew Yorker said in a recent profile 
<http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/guccis-renaissance-man> suggested 
“a dandy who had run off to join the Hell’s Angels”. And he chose this quote to 
convey several points.

First, that imagination is essential. (“All of my fashion is an illusion,” he 
said after the show.)

Second, that Gucci <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> is as much 
about fairytale as it is about reality. (Many of Michele’s dresses, with their 
pineapple-top fronds of organza and elaborate embroidery, look as if they might 
have been conjured into life by Cinderella’s fairy godmother, or stitched by 
the bluebirds in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.)

Third, that stars can be born from unlikely places: the boy who cried wolf, 
the villain of the tale, becomes a hero from Nabokov’s point of view.

This is Michele’s fourth season as the golden boy of Milan fashion week, 
having been plucked from the relative obscurity of the design room. The success 
he has brought to Gucci – sales of womenswear have risen 66% this year – is 
particularly notable, being in stark contrast to theailing fortunes of Prada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/25/prada-thinks-differently-at-milan-fashion-week-with-commentary-on-glamour>
 andArmani 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/01/giorgio-armani-revenues-hit-china-slowdown>
.

Fashion tires of its new discoveries fast. But Michele remains compelling 
partly because although his manner is warm and engaging – the virtual 
free-for-all backstage is unusual in strictly controlled Milan – he remains an 
intriguingly unknowable figure. He segues from dense cultural theorising (he 
mentioned French intellectual Roger Caillois in discussions about this show, as 
well as German author Elias Canetti) into raptures about his latest best 
friend, Elton John (“I love Elton! He is amazing! Like a … firework!”).

 Accessories were just as eccentric as the clothes on show. Photograph:

The stage set for this show had the scent and colour of a seedy nightclub, but 
a soundtrack of William Blake’s poetry recited over a choral backdrop. Channels 
of white light beaming down as if from high windows gave it an alternate 
identity as a sacred space. Michele, who in June staged thefirst ever show to 
take place in Westminster Abbey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/02/westminster-abbey-divine-inspiration-gucci-show>
, has said he is not religious, but is drawn to places of worship because “you 
can feel the power of the people who were inside to express themselves, or to 
ask for something”.


What makes Michele’s commercial revival of Gucci all the more extraordinary is 
that, in contrast to the straightforwardly glamorous clothes of the Tom Ford 
era, the aesthetic is a long way from the mainstream. An endless lineup of 
clashing sugary pastels, crammed together like the ice-cream trays in a 
Milanese gelateria, were whipped into a frenzy on the catwalk with the help of 
disco lurex, cricket-jumper trims, embroidered animals and cryptic legends in 
gothic fonts. Accessories – the cash cows of any luxury brand – were no less 
eccentric, with pearl-studded platform sandals and regal handbags hoisted into 
backpacks by wide satin ribbons.
