Thanks so much for your questions - it was great chatting to you. Tickets are 
still available for the Young Vic's Measure for Measure, which will involve 
wacky sets and lots of very emotional acting.

No I planned to say it – I said that I'd had 27 stitches in my vagina, so I 
didn't think I'd be laughing at anything very soon, when giving an award for 
comedy acting.

Did you understand the criticisms levelled at Inside I’m Dancing

I understood the criticisms, but I felt sad for the film, which was a geniune 
attempt to raise the issue of independent living and the problem that society 
has with disabled people, and their right to be independent, and live and work 
with freedom. No film on this subject has been made subsequently, but other 
films using able-bodied actors such as the Stephen Hawking biopic have been 
made and didn't seem to suffer the same level of criticism. Perhaps disabled 
actors should have been cast in that film, but I still feel proud that it was a 
film on an important topic that raised important issues, and feel sad that it 
wasn't promoted because of that controversy.

Measure for Measure is known as a problem play. Do you have any problems 
character wise playing one of Shakespeare’s females in this very patriarchal 
play?

I don't think it is a patriarchal play. I think it's a profoundly 
misunderstood play. I think directors misread Isabella as a character. She's a 
fiercely strong character. I would say one of the strongest in Shakespeare. 
He's given a woman a platform to express the truth that rape is not a 
bargaining tool, she absolutely has the moral imperative and at the end that 
opportunity to be the only true force for good in the play. It's the female 
Hamlet or Macbeth. But has been misinterpreted by patriarchal readers.

I didn't know very much about "dance music", what the kids are into is always 
a bit of a surprise to me. I just got the request from my agent, and I thought 
it would be interesting. To be honest they shot it in the underwater tank in 
Pinewood, and the day involved swimming in it - I'm a passionate swimmer, and I 
liked the idea of getting in a 40ft deep tank.

I have seen the original Star Wars but not for a very long time, and am 
largely totally disinterested in Star Wars as a franchise. I don't fancy Jeremy 
Corbyn, but then I've nothing to suggest he would fancy me either.

Like you, I trained with the National Youth Theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre>, but went to university rather than 
drama school. Tentatively, now I’ve graduated, I am attempting to continue 
acting.

I know it is probably a while back for you, but, once you were auditioning for 
film or theatre, is there any advice you were given/things you learned yourself 
that you’ve heeded? Your opinion is particularly interesting, because you come 
across so refreshingly thoughtful – but you already know that.

I'm so glad you noticed that! 

Remember you're auditioning them. Acting is a collaboration with the director, 
and it's only a worthwhile job if the director respects you completely as an 
equal. Go into every audition knowing that you're an equal and expect to be 
treated as such. And have fun collaborating.

I really enjoyed your performance in Francois Ozon’s Angel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121084/angel>. I though it was very 
smartly played and tonally quite a tricky thing to pull off. Do you have a 
preference for acting styles? Do certain styles come more naturally to you or 
is it the nature of the job that you just shift to whatever production your in?

I'm never consciously aware of style when I'm acting. I'm aware of tone, but 
that I think very much is largely the director's preserve, especially on film, 
so they have to tell you what tone they're looking for. I have to say that film 
is probably my most proud moment, I loved the film and I loved being in it - it 
was such an intelligent film about creativity and performance, and it was a 
delight to work with such a deeply intelligent and playful filmmaker.

I loved your Masha in Filter’s Three Sisters five years ago; how did you find 
the experience of doing a more experimental interpretation of Chekhov, after 
the more traditional Seagull (also a wonderful performance!)? Should we be more 
flexible in our approach to producing classic texts?

I think there's an emphasis today on design, so it looks like we have a very 
flexible approach because we do wacky things with design, but actually 
performance style is actually very unified in this country. And what I really 
liked about working with Filter was they were trying to inject a real sense of 
realism into the performances, which made the performances quite muted, which I 
thought was interesting because English actors are expected to be very 
emotional on stage a lot of the time. I think basically classic plays become 
classics because you can do them in lots of different ways, and that they 
should always be done differently. But I don't think having a wacky set or 
different costumes necessarily means that you're reinventing the play.

Book, film and music recommendations from Romola

Jason Davis <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15341776> says:

I love your works , thank you for creating such compelling characters and 
artfully exploring diverse themes so authentically. You are truly inspiring and 
I so look forward to seeing your incredible gravitas/also lightness in equal 
measure when you are on the screen...

I’m wondering if you could recommend a book or movie (or a song) you love 
these days...?

I read an amazing book this year that I recommend very highly, called We Are 
All Completely Beside Ourselves by Karen Joy Fowler, which I thought was one of 
the best novels I've read ever. It just destroyed me. I felt like she's a 
writer that's writing at the absolute top of her game, it was amazingly 
structured. And the emotional weight of the story was being crushed by a rock, 
it flattened you as the story went on. I can't say too much without revealing a 
reveal that happens very early on...

Movie, I saw a great movie confusingly called House of Cards, but in no way 
related to the series. It had Kathleen Turner and Tommy Lee Jones in it, and 
it's about a woman who thinks her child has autism - it was given to me by 
someone who read my script and said I should see it. If you want a really 
fantastic unusual drama - the kind we depressingly don't make very much any 
more - I really recommend it.

I'm not very good with the hit parade! This is embarassing... i basically only 
listen to contemporary composition like John Taverner and John Adams when I'm 
working and Katy Perry when I'm cooking. And that's it, basically.

I absolutely loved your performance as Bel in The Hour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-hour> and I really wish it had 
returned for a third series! So I was wondering what you think would’ve 
happened in a 3rd series and also what was it like working with Peter Capaldi?

No-one wishes it would return for a third series more than me! People are 
always saying it's such a shame and I'm like: YEAH. The third series would have 
been in the 60s, so it would have gone into the moon landings, been much more 
cold war, and there was some talk of Bel possibly getting married. It was 
delightful working with Peter - he is very experienced. Sometimes when you work 
with actors who have done so much stuff, you can feel them waiting for you to 
get the scene right - they're really supporting and encouraging, but they're 
having to go through all your terrible takes. He's very funny, a really nice 
man.

"I think there should be quotas. If you're fielding primetime television with

Your performance in The Hour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-hour> was an iconic piece of 
breathless British television. Do you feel there are enough great roles around 
for actresses on television and screen in both Hollywood and around the world? 
Does something need to change in your opinion?

I think there should be quotas. I think if you're fielding primetime 
television with 70% and 80% of the parts being white men, you should probably 
rethink that. There's a lot of tokenism in film and television, with a poster 
with three white guys, one black guy, and a woman, and that's equality, and 
it's not equality.

"The pornification of television has had a massive effect on actresses"

BaharKoru <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15343455> asks:

You have performed at many stages; TV, cinema and theater. Which one is your 
favorite?

I don't have a favourite. I think the ideal for me would be for me to do a 
little bit of all. But actually, all I really care about is playing interesting 
parts. I think I can get quite bored at work if I don't have something to get 
my teeth into, and that's really my only priority or concern. There just aren't 
enough parts for women across the board in film and television, of any kind. If 
you've got 30% of speaking roles for women, if you say 20% of those are shit, 
then you've got 10% of good parts - there's an awful lot of competition for 
those roles. Because of the emphasis we put on creative women becoming actors 
as opposed to other creative occupations. the emphasis for young girls who feel 
a creative spark is: don't you want to be an actress? A man can sit down and 
think: maybe I want to be an architect, or a set designer... it means there are 
a lot of actresses vying for a few parts.

 Film and television has also become very misogynistic in the last fifteen 
years so the problem has got worse. I think that the blossoming of nudity as 
entertainment has much more affected women that men, and there are a lot of 
shows that have tit quotas. So the pornification of television has had a 
massive effect on actresses. I have a lot of friends who are told if you don't 
get your tits out, we'll get the supporting artists to do it, but someone has 
to. I don't think audiences understand what a difficult position it is putting 
women who aren't trained to be strippers into turning their bodies to their 
occupation in that way. No one has ever told me to get my top off, but I know 
it happens. I'm at the stage where I wouldn't go in on a job if I thought that 
was going to happen. And you know, it often the writer's attitude. It's not 
seen as a morally unforgivable thing for a male character to have sex with a 
prostitute, it's seen as an extension of a reckless, sexy antihero, and I don't 
think that was the case 10 or 15 years ago on television. I'm hoping that what 
will happen is it will get a lot worse and people will think oh god, is this 
what we want? Probably not though.

How do you prepare as an actor for a role? Are there any specific routines 
that you follow irrespective of the role you are going to essay?

No. I don't really prepare very much. I suppose I do as much as the director 
wants. For this part, because Joe and I have been talking about it since 
January, we did quite a lot of research for her and I went and stayed in a 
convent and read a lot of books about nuns. And all my friends got very bored 
about me talking about nuns. I think it's a useful thing to remember in our 
secular bubble of the chatterati that most people in the world live with 
profound and devout faith - I don't think you can go into this play without 
respect for people with faith. It was a good reminder of a life where you 
wrestle with the big questions, which a life of faith requires.

On the night, I do a warm up I guess. But actually I think if this is an actor 
asking this question, I think character work is a very two headed monster. It 
gives you ideas, but it leads you away from the text. I'm of the opinion really 
that you're best advised to follow the text as close as possible. If you stray 
away from the page, you can get a bit lost. I think also Shakespeare tells you 
everything you need to know. It's useful, but it has to be treated with caution.

Churchill's Secret is a one-off 90 minute TV drama, about Winston Churchill, 
surprise surprise. And Churchill's secret is... that he was a woman! No, he had 
a stroke in 1952 and there's some historical evidence that he had brain damage 
after that stroke, so even though he went on to win the election and serve 
another term, he was seriously affected by the stroke. It focuses on his 
recovery from that stroke, and his deep need for power - his refusal to let 
power go. Steamrollering his wife Clementine's desire for him to retire. The 
part I play, his nurse, is a sort of subplot, where she encourages him to carry 
on working because she feels vocation is the only real reason people have to 
live.

I understood the criticisms, but I felt sad for the film, which was a geniune 
attempt to raise the issue of independent living and the problem that society 
has with disabled people, and their right to be independent, and live and work 
with freedom. No film on this subject has been made subsequently, but other 
films using able-bodied actors such as the Stephen Hawking biopic have been 
made and didn't seem to suffer the same level of criticism. Perhaps disabled 
actors should have been cast in that film, but I still feel proud that it was a 
film on an important topic that raised important issues, and feel sad that it 
wasn't promoted because of that controversy.

I don't think it is a patriarchal play. I think it's a profoundly 
misunderstood play. I think directors misread Isabella as a character. She's a 
fiercely strong character. I would say one of the strongest in Shakespeare. 
He's given a woman a platform to express the truth that rape is not a 
bargaining tool, she absolutely has the moral imperative and at the end that 
opportunity to be the only true force for good in the play. It's the female 
Hamlet or Macbeth. But has been misinterpreted by patriarchal readers.

I'm so glad you noticed that! 

Remember you're auditioning them. Acting is a collaboration with the director, 
and it's only a worthwhile job if the director respects you completely as an 
equal. Go into every audition knowing that you're an equal and expect to be 
treated as such. And have fun collaborating.

I'm never consciously aware of style when I'm acting. I'm aware of tone, but 
that I think very much is largely the director's preserve, especially on film, 
so they have to tell you what tone they're looking for. I have to say that film 
is probably my most proud moment, I loved the film and I loved being in it - it 
was such an intelligent film about creativity and performance, and it was a 
delight to work with such a deeply intelligent and playful filmmaker.

I loved your Masha in Filter’s Three Sisters five years ago; how did you find

I think there's an emphasis today on design, so it looks like we have a very 
flexible approach because we do wacky things with design, but actually 
performance style is actually very unified in this country. And what I really 
liked about working with Filter was they were trying to inject a real sense of 
realism into the performances, which made the performances quite muted, which I 
thought was interesting because English actors are expected to be very 
emotional on stage a lot of the time. I think basically classic plays become 
classics because you can do them in lots of different ways, and that they 
should always be done differently. But I don't think having a wacky set or 
different costumes necessarily means that you're reinventing the play.

I read an amazing book this year that I recommend very highly, called We Are 
All Completely Beside Ourselves by Karen Joy Fowler, which I thought was one of 
the best novels I've read ever. It just destroyed me. I felt like she's a 
writer that's writing at the absolute top of her game, it was amazingly 
structured. And the emotional weight of the story was being crushed by a rock, 
it flattened you as the story went on. I can't say too much without revealing a 
reveal that happens very early on...

Movie, I saw a great movie confusingly called House of Cards, but in no way 
related to the series. It had Kathleen Turner and Tommy Lee Jones in it, and 
it's about a woman who thinks her child has autism - it was given to me by 
someone who read my script and said I should see it. If you want a really 
fantastic unusual drama - the kind we depressingly don't make very much any 
more - I really recommend it.

I'm not very good with the hit parade! This is embarassing... i basically only 
listen to contemporary composition like John Taverner and John Adams when I'm 
working and Katy Perry when I'm cooking. And that's it, basically.

happened in a 3rd series and also what was it like working with Peter Capaldi?

No-one wishes it would return for a third series more than me! People are 
always saying it's such a shame and I'm like: YEAH. The third series would have 
been in the 60s, so it would have gone into the moon landings, been much more 
cold war, and there was some talk of Bel possibly getting married. It was 
delightful working with Peter - he is very experienced. Sometimes when you work 
with actors who have done so much stuff, you can feel them waiting for you to 
get the scene right - they're really supporting and encouraging, but they're 
having to go through all your terrible takes. He's very funny, a really nice 
man.

No I haven't! I think because I'm banging on about feminism in a really angry 
way, no-one offers me comedy...

Your performance in The Hour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-hour> was an iconic piece of 
breathless British television. Do you feel there are enough great roles around 
for actresses on television and screen in both Hollywood and around the world? 
Does something need to change in your opinion?

I think there should be quotas. I think if you're fielding primetime 
television with 70% and 80% of the parts being white men, you should probably 
rethink that. There's a lot of tokenism in film and television, with a poster 
with three white guys, one black guy, and a woman, and that's equality, and 
it's not equality.

I don't have a favourite. I think the ideal for me would be for me to do a 
little bit of all. But actually, all I really care about is playing interesting 
parts. I think I can get quite bored at work if I don't have something to get 
my teeth into, and that's really my only priority or concern. There just aren't 
enough parts for women across the board in film and television, of any kind. If 
you've got 30% of speaking roles for women, if you say 20% of those are shit, 
then you've got 10% of good parts - there's an awful lot of competition for 
those roles. Because of the emphasis we put on creative women becoming actors 
as opposed to other creative occupations. the emphasis for young girls who feel 
a creative spark is: don't you want to be an actress? A man can sit down and 
think: maybe I want to be an architect, or a set designer... it means there are 
a lot of actresses vying for a few parts.

 Film and television has also become very misogynistic in the last fifteen 
years so the problem has got worse. I think that the blossoming of nudity as 
entertainment has much more affected women that men, and there are a lot of 
shows that have tit quotas. So the pornification of television has had a 
massive effect on actresses. I have a lot of friends who are told if you don't 
get your tits out, we'll get the supporting artists to do it, but someone has 
to. I don't think audiences understand what a difficult position it is putting 
women who aren't trained to be strippers into turning their bodies to their 
occupation in that way. No one has ever told me to get my top off, but I know 
it happens. I'm at the stage where I wouldn't go in on a job if I thought that 
was going to happen. And you know, it often the writer's attitude. It's not 
seen as a morally unforgivable thing for a male character to have sex with a 
prostitute, it's seen as an extension of a reckless, sexy antihero, and I don't 
think that was the case 10 or 15 years ago on television. I'm hoping that what 
will happen is it will get a lot worse and people will think oh god, is this 
what we want? Probably not though.

How do you prepare as an actor for a role? Are there any specific routines

No. I don't really prepare very much. I suppose I do as much as the director 
wants. For this part, because Joe and I have been talking about it since 
January, we did quite a lot of research for her and I went and stayed in a 
convent and read a lot of books about nuns. And all my friends got very bored 
about me talking about nuns. I think it's a useful thing to remember in our 
secular bubble of the chatterati that most people in the world live with 
profound and devout faith - I don't think you can go into this play without 
respect for people with faith. It was a good reminder of a life where you 
wrestle with the big questions, which a life of faith requires.

On the night, I do a warm up I guess. But actually I think if this is an actor 
asking this question, I think character work is a very two headed monster. It 
gives you ideas, but it leads you away from the text. I'm of the opinion really 
that you're best advised to follow the text as close as possible. If you stray 
away from the page, you can get a bit lost. I think also Shakespeare tells you 
everything you need to know. It's useful, but it has to be treated with caution.

Churchill's Secret is a one-off 90 minute TV drama, about Winston Churchill, 
surprise surprise. And Churchill's secret is... that he was a woman! No, he had 
a stroke in 1952 and there's some historical evidence that he had brain damage 
after that stroke, so even though he went on to win the election and serve 
another term, he was seriously affected by the stroke. It focuses on his 
recovery from that stroke, and his deep need for power - his refusal to let 
power go. Steamrollering his wife Clementine's desire for him to retire. The 
part I play, his nurse, is a sort of subplot, where she encourages him to carry 
on working because she feels vocation is the only real reason people have to 
live.
