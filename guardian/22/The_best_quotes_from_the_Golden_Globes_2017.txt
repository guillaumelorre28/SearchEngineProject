Thank you, first of all, to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for this 
amazing honour. I suppose it’s made more amazing by the fact that I’ll be able 
to say that I won this at the last everGolden Globes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/golden-globes>. I don’t mean to be gloomy. 
It’s just that it has the words ‘Hollywood,’ ‘foreign,’ and ‘press’ in the 
title.
Hugh Laurie wins best supporting actor in a TV drama


Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners, and if you kick us all 
out, you’ll have nothing to watch except for football and mixed martial arts, 
which are not arts.

March 14 1981. It was the same day we had to put our dogs down. Three of them. 
Little Jack, Janet and Chrissie. My grandpa thought it’d be fun to go to a 
movie. It didn’t take our minds off it. Bambi’s mum. And also that was the last 
day I saw my grandpa. He disappeared. And I didn’t speak for two years.
Co-presenter Kirsten Wiig does the same


You make me proud to be an artist. You make me feel that what I have in me – 
my body, my face, my age – is enough.
Viola Davis introduces Meryl Streep


While I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best 
experiences I ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant 
with our second, and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. 
If she hadn’t taken all that on so that I could have this experience, there 
would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So sweetheart, thank 
you.
Ryan Gosling thanks Eva Mendes in his best actor speech

I’ve been to the Globes six times, and I’ve worn a dress every time. And I 
love dresses. I’m not trying to protest dresses. But I wanted to make sure that 
young girls and women know that they aren’t a requirement. And you don’t have 
to wear one if you don’t want to. And to just be yourself because your worth is 
more than that. So, I said, this year I’m going homage to Marlene Dietrich and 
Victor/Victoria and David Bowie, because it’s his birthday.
