After two days of teasing messages on Twitter, Rockstar has officially 
announced Red Dead Redemption 2. The sequel to the company’s 15m-selling 
western adventure will launch next autumn. A trailer will arrive on YouTube 
this Thursday.

In a brief press release sent out on Tuesday afternoon, Rockstar referred to 
the sequel as “an epic tale of life in America’s unforgiving heartland”. The 
publisher, best known for the Grand Theft Auto series also promised, “a brand 
new online multiplayer experience”. It’s probably some sort of persistent 
multiplayer world, similar to the hugely successful GTA Online is in 
development to accompany the single-player campaign.

“With Red Dead Redemption 2, the team is working hard to push forward our 
vision for interactive entertainment in a truly living world,” said Sam Houser, 
co-founder of RockstarGames <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games>. “We 
hope to deliver players an epic experience that builds upon everything we’ve 
learned making games.”

Little is known about the new title, but the teaser image shows seven 
characters silhouetted against the sun – a possible homage to The Magnificent 
Seven. It was previous thought that the game would be some form of prequel, 
starring a younger incarnation of Red Dead Redemption hero, John Marston. A 
possible map of the new title’s environment was leaked to site Tech Radar, 
showing that the story may take part in a similar area of the United States to 
its predecessor.

Much more is likely to be revealed when the trailer launches at 11.00am 
Eastern Time on Thursday.
