With his peerless hat-wearing and those thick black glasses, Spike Lee is a 
style icon that only the movies can make: a film character even without the 
clang of the clapper board. That’s not even mentioning the rich vein of style 
references that run through his back catalogue, fromDo the Right Thing 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muc7xqdHudI> to Malcolm X and Girl 6. 

Making a film for a fashion brand was never going to be a great trial for the 
the director – see Lee’s promotional short for Moncler, thepadded jacket

 brand that is opening a store in New York this week. In a 1.14 minute film, 
Brave, filmed across the city with the summer light of Do the Right Thing, 
these three backpacked boys walking through a mall stand out – crisp, full of 
purpose and striding forth as young Americans, members of a secret society we 
wouldn’t mind being a part of. That’s style as a story directed by Spike Lee, 
still doing the right thing after more than 30 years of movie-making.
