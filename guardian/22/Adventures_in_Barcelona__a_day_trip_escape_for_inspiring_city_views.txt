One of my favourite things about visiting famous, beautiful cities is escaping 
from them for a different perspective.

I love Barcelona – who doesn’t? – the architecture, the bustle, the energy. 
But there’s a great place not far away to get a totally different vibe. Jump on 
a train from central Barcelona and within an hour you’ll be at the foot of a 
steep mountain covered with enormous, weird, smooth rocky outcrops. At the top 
of the mountain is the beautiful Santa Maria de Montserrat, a Benedictine abbey 
with 1,000 years of history. You can either climb the mountain or, as I did, 
hop into a cable car and be whisked effortlessly to the top. Pilgrims have been 
coming here for centuries to see the abbey’s famous black madonna and there’s a 
boarding school that’s home to one of the oldest boys’ choirs in Europe, who 
often perform.

But besides the abbey, the real highlight is the miles and miles of 
well-marked beautiful hiking trails around the Montserrat natural park. The 
views are spectacular, the rocky landscape and cool, shaded woodlands are 
delightful, and rarely have I enjoyed a simple squashed jamon y queso sandwich 
more than watching the sun set from those peaceful heights.

Visiting Montserrat is an easy day trip from Barcelona, or you could do as I 
did and spend the night wild camping up on the mountain (there is a hotel if 
you prefer), hogging all its beauty to yourself for a fabulous night under the 
stars.
