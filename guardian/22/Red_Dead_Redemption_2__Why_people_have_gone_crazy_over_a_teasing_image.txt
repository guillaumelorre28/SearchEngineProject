Nobody announces anything on a Sunday afternoon. Nobody except Rockstar, of 
course.

The publisher behind the multimillion selling Grand Theft Auto series put out 
one tweet on the afternoon of 16 October – a refreshed version of its own logo, 
on a red background. That was it. So far the message has been retweeted 110,000 
times.

This is not how the games industry tends to hype its forthcoming 
announcements. Big companies pump millions of dollars into events like E3 or 
Gamescom to ensure a huge audience for their meticulously designed teaser 
trailers. They set up hashtags, get prominent YouTubers onboard, roll out 
pan-global campaigns from 24-hour command centres, then obsess over every 
column inch of coverage. Rockstar changed its logo colour.

What’s this all about? Well, it’s about Red Dead Redemption. 

The publisher’s 2010 western epic was a massive critical and commercial hit, 
bringing the open-world dynamic of GTA to the American frontier of 1911. With a 
wizened, Eastwood-esque hero in the shape of John Marston, a bloody revenge 
narrative and an elegiac tone, the game presented a vision of the wild west 
every bit as compelling, brutish and beautiful as anything from Leone or 
Peckinpah. Now it appears, a new title is coming.


But no one is quite sure what. A following tweet, posted 24 hours later, 
showed seven figures silhouetted against a huge orange sun – seemingly 
referencing The Magnificent Seven; a timely decision considering the recent 
movie remake.

It’s totally unclear whether we should expect a HD remake of the original game 
(and/or its forbearer, Red Dead Revolver), a sequel or a prequel. Most fans are 
expecting the latter option, an earlier tale from the adventures of Marsten. 
Many have also seena leaked map of the game 
<http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/this-is-the-map-you-ll-be-playing-in-red-dead-redemption-2-1319101>
, purporting to be the setting for the prequel – an area of land just to the 
east of Red Dead Redemption’s territory. But none of this has been confirmed. 
Because Rockstar doesn’t do confirmations.

It doesn’t need to. Within an hour of the first tweet, there was already news 
coverage of the logo alteration on every major gaming and tech site on the web, 
and with the second message, it has turned into a rolling story. A trailer is 
expected to follow, perhaps sometime this week, with a launch possible in 
October. Rockstar will reveal more when the company is good and ready.

It’s a fascinating story in this era of corporate messaging desperation; when 
the prevailing wisdom is, hit every platform hard. Rockstar doesn’t attend big 
industry events like E3, Gamescom, Pax or EGX, and it doesn’t align its 
announcements with the usual beats of the industry year. For Grand Theft Auto 
V, a tweet with just “#GTAV” arrived on 25 October, 2011, followed by a trailer 
a week later. That game went on to sell over 65m copies. Red Dead is smaller 
fry with sales of around 15m, but it’s been so long since we heard anything 
from Rockstar, the company could probably have announced a follow-up to its 
under-appreciated 2006 release Table Tennis and it would have created a storm.

As it is Red Dead is seen by some as Rockstar’s true masterpiece, a less 
corrosive, less bombastic proposition than GTA, suffused in the mythology and 
slower pace of the western. Everyone was expecting some kind of follow-up this 
year, but the publisher has left it late to say anything – and really it still 
hasn’t said anything. It must have known, however, the massive interest its two 
tweets would make, surely ruling out a mere HD update. Even Rockstar couldn’t 
get away with that.

The arch manipulator of video game fandom knows what it is doing. The slowest 
of slow burn releases. Let the forums and social media do the heavy lifting. If 
the game is as clever as its understated “announcement” it will surely live up 
to the anti-hype.
