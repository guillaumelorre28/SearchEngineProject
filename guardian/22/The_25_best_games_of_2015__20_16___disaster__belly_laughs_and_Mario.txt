It’s part two of our romp through the best games of 2015, and after 
yesterday’s concentration of offbeat indie hits, here are ... well, a few more. 
We did warn you this was a highly subjective list.

 Can you deal with disaster? Galak Z will tell you either way. 
The aesthetic is borrowed from 1980s Saturday morning cartoons, the kind where 
a boyish Japanese hero space pilot takes down the hulking alien monster while 
successfully negotiating a field of asteroids. Yet, behind the bluster, this is 
a game about learning how to deal with disaster when, for example, you’re 
quaking in some forsaken space cave, shields depleted, wondering how on earth 
you can make it home to the mothership in one piece. Designed by Jake Kazdal, 
who worked alongside Tetsuya Mizuguchi on the seminal shooter Rez, it’s a 
good-looking game too. But the real beauty lies in the disasters into which 
you’re thrusted even if, for some players, their demands will be a little too 
stratospheric.

 19. N++ (PS4)

 Arcade rhythms … N++. 
The arcade rhythms of N++ are almost instinctively familiar. This is a game in 
which you repeat the same actions, time and again, in a quest to master spatial 
reasoning. Your character, a diminutive ninja, lives for just 90 seconds. In 
that time, you must attempt to traverse five deadly rooms. It’s not the most 
novel or affecting premise, and yet, N++ feels freshly essential (as well as 
bulky: there are around two thousand challenge rooms to tackle). As with all 
the very best twitch classics, the journey from beginner to master is told not 
via new abilities for your avatar, but rather in your hands and muscle memory. 
You leave an expert – albeit one in a uselessly particular dimension.

 Tragedy and belly laughs: Tales from the Borderlands. 
Like Traveller’s Tales with the Lego titles, Telltale provides a factory 
production line capable of taking any gaming, movie or television franchise and 
turning it into something smart, entertaining and often hilarious. Though Game 
of Thrones and Minecraft: Story Mode also shined this year, it’s this spin off 
from the Gearbox RPG shooters that we really enjoyed, thanks to its excellent 
characters, genuinely funny script and expert understanding of a narrative 
universe where tragedy and belly laughs are only ever a laser blast apart.

 Invisible Inc 
A title pun worthy of the purest stealth game this year, Invisible Inc. also 
boasts greater beauty and urgency than any turn-based strategy title has a 
right to. You have 72 hours to save your spy agency by infiltrating 2074’s 
megacorps, siphoning power and funds with the odds firmly stacked against you, 
even with a vital rewind function. Its recent expansion doubled the length of a 
campaign already worth revisiting due to its extensive customisation and 
character selection; who you bring along will radically alter your playstyle.

 Super Mario Maker Photograph: Nintendo 
At one time or another, we’ve all secretly thought: ‘Hey, that Shigeru 
Miyamoto is a complete hack; I could do better.’ Well now we have a chance. 
Super Mario Maker is a deceptively powerful creation tool, allowing just about 
anyone to construct their own platforming levels and share them with the world. 
Although it’s deep and complex,Nintendo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo> knows how to design an 
interface that works, so making stuff is as much fun as playing. Of course, we 
all immediately realise that Miyamoto is in fact a genius, but maybe that’s the 
point.

 * The Guardian Games ‘Review of the Year’ is taking place at the Guardian’s 
Scott Room on Thursday evening, 7-8.30pm. Featuring Keith Stuart, writers Simon 
Parkin and Cara Ellison and game developer Mike Bithell, we’ll look back at 
2015, with mince pies and a giant (free!) Xmas tombola with amazing prizes!
Tickets available here
