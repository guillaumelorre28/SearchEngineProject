Germany can be overlooked as a holiday destination, but its beautiful 
timbered, medieval towns; lakes; mountains; forests; and cosmopolitan cities 
make it a great base for adventure and relaxation. We’d like to hear about your 
highlights beyond the obvious guidebook sights.


Send us your specific tips via GuardianWitness 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/>, including as much detail as you can in 
around 100 words (along with website, menu details and prices etc, if possible).


The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
from Hotels.com, allowing you to stay in more than 260,000 places worldwide. 
Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using the text tab.

You’re welcome to add a photo if you own the copyright to it – but it’s the 
text we’ll be judging.
