Topman opened the spring/summer 2016 shows at London Collections Men 
<http://www.londoncollections.co.uk/> with a show that crammed in enough youth 
culture references to test even the most enthusiastic of trainspotters.

Northern Soul <https://www.theguardian.com/music/northern-soul> was the most 
obvious – its influence was seen in wide-legged trousers and vests (all the 
better for spinning around the dance floor) and patched jackets – while classic

 references came in the form of studded denim (very Billy Idol). Some prints 
had designs resembling the logos of post-punk bands like PiL.

Anoraks had an 1980s casual colour palate, and, to tick the 2015 “essential 
nineties moment”, one T-shirt sloganed with “Soul Nites”, which looked like a 
Pulp tour T-shirt circa 1995. A nice additional touch was the mixtape of the 
show’s soundtrack, which appeared on each guest’s seat.

This was the patchwork of references that looked like a brand’s moodboard made 
into clothes. Indeed, design director Gordon Richardson is all about the 
mix-up. He says it’s the way to keep things modern – essential when appealing 
to the teens and 20-somethings shopping in store, none of whom were even alive 
when these movements were in full swing. “The great thing about Topman is that 
we’re a cross-section of things,” he says. “We’re not just one esoteric 
viewpoint.”

He admits, however, that he has a soft spot for northern soul’s hedonistic, 
living-for-the-dance-floor culture. “I love that kind of reference,” he says. 
“It’s good music and people having a good time.” Richardson even believes it 
may hold the key to the Great Trouser Debate – AKAgetting men out of their 
beloved skinny jeans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jan/09/skinny-jeans-fashion-trend-refuses-to-die>
. “It’s a chance to bring back the wider trouser,” he explains, pointing to the 
wide-legged strides worn with vests in the show. “The more context you can put 
something into the more relatable it is.”

It will be a tough ask to get all young British men to take up the uniform of 
a 70s subculture, but it might just work, as it did the first time around, for 
a very happy niche.
