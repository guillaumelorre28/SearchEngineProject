Forza Horizon 3

The visually astonishing motor sports series returns to Xbox One, and this 
time the setting is a realistically modelled reproduction of Australia. With a 
maptwice the size of the previous game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/21/forza-horizon-3-racing-game>
 and featuring more than 350 cars, it’s a vast driving challenge. There is also 
a four-player coop mode, so you can take a road trip with your friends, from 
the rain forests of Queensland to the hippy paradise of Byron Bay.

Fifa 17

The annual footie sim has had a major overhaul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/13/fifa-17-new-engine-new-story-mode-and-five-more-key-additions>
, with a new intelligence system for computer-controller players, refreshed 
attacking and set-piece controls, and a newjourney mode 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9LHzVEPodg> that drops you into the boots of 
a rookie player named Alex Hunter as he seeks to make his mark on the Premier 
League. Sports sims and life stories don’t usually go together, so this should 
be interesting.

Gears of War 4

The testosterone-soaked sci-fi shooter is back after a five-year hiatus, and 
promises a familiar blend of massive guns, giant monsters and epic carnage. Set 
25 years after the apocalyptic battle that ended Gears 3, a new alien army 
named the Swarm has emerged to threaten humanity. Luckily, humanity has 
chainsaw-clad assault rifles and Buzzkill saw blades that whizz around the 
battlefield until they slice something’s limbs off. There will be blood.

At £349, Sony’s virtual reality headset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/17/playstation-boss-console-hideo-kojima-manufacturers-developers>

Infinite and Resident Evil 7 – it could be the most accessible introduction to 
VR gaming so far.

Battlefield 1

The long-running military shooter series is travelling back in time to the 
first world war. Historically accurate weapons, tanks and aircraft will all 
figure in the 64-player online dustups, which take place across the muddy 
fields of France, the frozen Alps and the Sinai desert. Expect action on an 
epic scale thanks to destructible environments and giant airship attacks.

Dishonored 2

One of the most visually and thematically interesting action adventures of the 
last five years,Dishonored 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/30/video-games-2016-dishonored-2-uncharted-4-xcom-2>
 allowed players to sneak around a bizarre steam-punk city, completing stealth 
missions against its corrupt aristocracy and learning magical skills. The 
sequel moves the action to an intriguing new locale and introduces a fresh 
playable character, the beautiful empress Emily Kaldwin, who has become an 
assassin to claim back her kingdom.

Watch Dogs 2

Hacker hero Marcus Holloway must bring down the sinister computerised security 
system controlling San Francisco in Ubisoft’s near-future cyberpunk thriller. 
Players can hack and control everything from cars to drones as they explore the 
beautifully detailed urban environment. The original fell a bit short of its 
hype, but this seems a much more entertaining and well-structured game.

Pokémon Sun and Moon

The phenomenal success of smartphone spin-off Pokémon Go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/14/pokemon-go-future-multiplayer-app-advertising>
 has boosted interest in the monster-collecting series – just in time for the 
latest instalments (the main Pokémon titles always come in twos). Set on a 
series of tropical islands, Sun and Moon offer familiar Pokémon-catching 
adventures, but add new mini-games and competitive multiplayer modes. We’ve 
still gotta catch ’em all.

Final Fantasy XV

After 10 years in development, fan expectations are somewhat elevated for this 
epic role-playing adventure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/19/final-fantasy-xv-footage-reveals-magic-quests-and-chocobos>
, which takes place on an Earth-like planet where apocalyptic war looms. The 
more naturalistic, modernised setting gives the game a different feel to its 
predecessors, as do the freely explorable environments. It’s a concession to 
action-focused adventures like Mass Effect and Fallout 4, but have directors 
Tetsuya Nomura and Hajime Tabata moved too far fromthe classic blueprint
