Direct Energie’s Calmejane made a solo attack from the breakaway with eight 
kilometres remaining of the 163.5km route from Betanzos to San Andrés de 
Teixido in Galicia.

The 23-year-old finished 15 seconds clear of Atapuma (BMC Racing) and Benjamin 
King (Cannondale-Drapac) to claim victory, with the Colombian Atapuma doing 
enough to take possession of the leader’s jersey from Movistar’s Rubén 
Fernández.

seconds back, with Froome four seconds further behind and Chaves and Quintana 
39 seconds adrift of the leader.

seconds behind Atapuma.

Calmejane told Eurosport: “It’s a very great feeling. To win a stage so soon 
in the Vuelta is just awesome.

“Today in my head was just ‘the breakaway, the breakaway’ and to have no 
regrets. I saw (Thomas) De Gent was very strong in the group so I attacked. 
When I was alone, first in the race, I gave everything and it’s wonderful.

“The goal was to win a stage, so now everything from here is a bonus.”
