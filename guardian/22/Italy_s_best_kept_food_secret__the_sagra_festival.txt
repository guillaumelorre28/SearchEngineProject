Italy’s best-kept food secret is the sagra. A festival organised to show off a 
local food or drink (or both), a sagra is a place where you’ll eat well – and 
learn. Mostsagre have local producers selling the goods, but there are also 
tastings, competitions, demonstrations and special menus. And they’re not just 
about the food: many sagre have their roots in old country fairs or pagan 
festivals celebrating the harvest and have been running for decades, even 
centuries. And while some have soared beyond local status to that of crowded 
international festivals, hundreds remain events where you’ll dine and drink 
elbow-to-elbow with locals. Here are seven autumn sagre that are both bustling 
but still true to their roots.

Yes, you’ll find chestnuts roasting in every piazza in this unspoilt hilltop 
town an hour’s drive north of Rome. But this sagra is about more than that: 
it’s also when Soriano’s four districts duke it out over which one best 
transports the town to a bygone era. In the Convivium Secretum, for example, 
costumed locals serve dishes such ascapon fricassee and white-rabbit pastry in 
the contest for best historic banquet. There are also jousts, archery and – in 
a dramatic finale – 700 townsfolk, each looking like they’ve sprung to life 
from a Renaissance painting or medieval tapestry, parading through the streets.

 Mortadella, a dish many see as the Italian precursor of bologna. Photograph: 
Charlotte Observer/Getty Images 
The pink sausage known as mortadella bologna has been beloved for ages – it 
was even traded like currency in the middle ages. And with its IGP protection 
ensuring no preservatives, artificial colours or flavours, this version is as 
far from US or UK “baloney” as you can get. No wonder the festival in its 
honour – now in its fourth year – has become so popular: 130,000 came last 
year. “Mortadella is sliced and served with bubbly aperitivo in the city 
streets,” says Italy-based food writer Eleonora Baldwin, while tastings, 
demonstrations and competitions sprawl across Bologna’s central Piazza 
Maggiore. As the president of theConsorzio Mortadella Bologna 
<http://www.mortadellabologna.com/> put it: “I guarantee that it will be ‘love 
at first slice’.”

The most famous of Italy’s truffle festivals is the International White 
Truffle Fair in Alba. But the medieval hilltop town of Sant’Agata Feltria – 
near where Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna, Le Marche and Umbria intersect – is home to 
a festival as local as it is vibrant. In the main tent restaurants scoop out 
dishes such as truffle-infused cheese fondue, truffled veal and gnocchi with 
truffle, while vendors proudly display their (wonky-looking) wares and no 
matter where you walk, the earthy scent lingers. Don’t miss the race of the 
truffle-hunting dogs on 11 October.

The small town of Morbegno is near the border of Switzerland, 70 miles 
north-east of Milan, and few foods reflect that like its beloved cheese. Given 
protected (DOP) status 20 years ago,bitto, which is soft and sweet when young 
but gets sharper as it ages, relies on cows grazing on Alpine pastures. The 
sagra offers tastings and bitto-centric menus (look for the most traditional 
dish: the cheese melted overpizzoccheri, a buckwheat pasta), as well as vendors 
selling products such as Alpine-herb amaro or local honey. “What I love about 
this sagra – and many sagre on the northern boundaries of Italy – is how much 
the cheese and its preparations feel distinctly connected to the neighbouring 
nations, in this case Switzerland,” says Katie Parla, an Italy food expert and 
author of the book Tasting Rome. “It’s a wonderful reminder of how what is 
perceived as authentic Italian cuisine is just a small part of Italy’s 
gastronomic culture.”

Where to eat, year round

<http://www.osteriadelcrotto.it/>, which also serves local dishes like roast 
lamb and ricotta ravioli.

 Visitors revel in the foodie streets at Bacco nelle Gnostre 
Held in a pretty, whitewashed town halfway between Bari and Taranto, this 
festival celebrates the Pugliese spirit at its most welcoming, where locals 
prepare food at home and share it with passersby in the town’s distinctive
gnostre (semi-private courtyards). Grab a steaming dish of orecchiette or 
grilled octopus and wash it down with a glass of vino novello, primitivo or 
negramaro, while listening to the thrum of tarantella that threads through the 
streets. “On every alley there’s something happening,” says Puglia native 
Antonello Losito, founder of Southern Visions Travel. “If someone asked me: ‘I 
want a quick showcase of Puglia, as I’ve never been before and I only have two 
hours’, I’d bring them here.”

 Roast with the most … marrone are celebrated, and eaten in great quantities, 
at the festival in Cuneo 
Now in its 18th year, this festival in Cuneo, 60 miles south of Turin, has 
become one of Italy’s most popular, welcoming about 300,000 visitors. And with 
good reason. The chestnut’s more desirable, sweeter cousin (and the one used for
marrons glacés), marrone have been cultivated in the area since the middle 
ages. This festival in the fruit’s honour is Italy’s foremost, but it’s not 
just marrone you’ll find here: 250 vendors also sell local olive oils, cheeses, 
wine and the not-to-be-missedcuneesi al rhum, a local speciality of rum-infused 
dark chocolate.

 Marino’s central fountain. 
“The sagra in Marino is, as far as I know, the only one in Italy where wine 
(not water) runs through the town’s central fountain,” says Italy-based food 
writer Elizabeth Minchilli. “It’s literally a bacchanalian adventure.” Launched 
in 1924, today the sagra – held every year in a town overlooking Lago Albano, 
15 miles south of Rome – is one of Italy’s liveliest. Stalls sell specialities 
such asporchetta and ciambelle al mosto (a ring-shaped cake with raisins that 
gets its own sagra the following weekend), grapevines are strung across streets 
and statues are piled with bunches of grapes. The real draw, however, is on 
Sunday, when a costumed procession re-enacts the 1571 Battle of Lepanto – and 
when the fountains flow with wine. Bring an empty water bottle and fill up. 
Just keep in mind that everyone else is doing the same … meaning this festival 
sometimes gets a little too bacchanalian for everyone’s liking.
