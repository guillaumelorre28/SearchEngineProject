Aloian, the flyweight silver medallist on the final day of the Games, failed a 
test for tuaminoheptane, a stimulant. Sincraian, who won bronze in the menâ€™s 
85kg event, tested positive for exogenous testosterone on 12 August. The CAS 
said the results of both athletes had been disqualified.

The build-up to the Games was overshadowed by the spectre of doping and about 
100 Russian athletes were banned from competing following revelations of a 
widespread and state-backed doping system in their country.
