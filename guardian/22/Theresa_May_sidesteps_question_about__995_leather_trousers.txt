Theresa May has been challenged over her decision to wear a £995 pair of 
leather trousers for a newspaper photoshoot by a reporter on aflight to Bahrain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/theresa-may-announces-joint-effort-on-security-in-gulf>
, but sidestepped the question to insist she was working for everyone in 
Britain.

The prime minister was interrogated after it emerged she wore the trousers and 
a pair of £295 Burberry trainers when photographed by the Sunday Times last 
month.

May was also questioned about her choice of goose for Christmas dinner rather 
than a traditional turkey, but replied that her fashion choices or festive menu 
did not mean she was distant from the general public.

Giving a look of mild exasperation, May responded: “I stood on the steps of 
Downing Street and said what I did about the importance of a country that works 
for everyone because that’s what I have heard from people as I’ve gone around 
the country, as I’ve met people in a whole variety of circumstances.

“I believe it is important for politicians to get out and about and that’s 
what I continue to. It is important we have a country that works for everyone.”

Over the weekend, Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary who was sacked 
by May, said the trousers had been “noticed and discussed” in local Tory 
circles. “I don’t have leather trousers. I don’t think I’ve ever spent that 
much on anything apart from my wedding dress,” Morgan said.

On Tuesday, the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries rounded on Morgan for 
criticising May’s dress sense, implying that a male politician would get no 
such criticism.

Calling the former education secretary “sacked Nicky Morgan”, Dorries tweeted:

In her interview with the Sunday Times in November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/27/brexit-keeps-me-awake-at-night-says-theresa-may>
, May said she did not have a stylist but took fashion advice from her husband, 
Philip. “He’s good at accessories, too,” she said, “particularly good at 
choosing handbags and bracelets for presents, and good at flowers.”

On Monday, the Radio Times published an interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/05/pms-christmas-poirot-goose-and-church-before-presents>
 in which the prime minister revealed that she preferred goose for Christmas 
dinner, watching Doctor Who over the festive season and listening to Radio 
Berkshire in the evenings before bed.
