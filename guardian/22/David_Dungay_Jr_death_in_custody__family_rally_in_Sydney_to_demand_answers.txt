The family of an Indigenous man who died in custody have rallied outside the 
New South Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> 
Department of Corrective Services building in Sydney to demand answers about 
his death.

David Dungay Jr, 26, died while being treated for a medical condition at Long 
Bay prison on 29 December 2015. His family said he was due to be released on 
parole three weeks later.

The Dunghutti man from Kempsey was reportedly being restrained by several 
guards around the time of his death.

Police said Dungay’s death was not suspicious, and an investigation conducted 
by the Corrective Services investigation unit found no criminal negligence.

But Dungay’s family do not accept that finding, and are demanding answers from 
Corrective Services as to the cause and circumstances of his death.

On Thursday morning, Dungay’s mother, Leetona Dungay, gave a tearful address 
to a crowd of dozens outside Central Station inSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> near the Department of 
Corrective Services on Lee Street.

“It is hard to believe that today in Australia that this type of thing is 
still happening but I stand here before you as the mother of a son who was 
taken away from me when he was still just a kid.”

Dungay said her son, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at the age of six, died in 
the prison hospital after he was prevented from eating a biscuit for his blood 
sugar levels.

“In prison they just don’t look after you properly,” she said. “The officers 
knew that day that Junior was diabetic.”

Leetona Dungay said David was “overpowered” and “restrained” by several 
officers.

“Why is this happening? Why is this happening in Australia today? Why are we 
locking up our proud young Aboriginal men in prison? How many of them need to 
die? This is 2016, not 1816 or 1916. We need to get angry.”

Dungay’s death has been referred to the NSW coroner for a public inquest.

The Indigenous Social Justice Association (ISJA), which organised the protest 
with the Dungay family, is calling for the guards involved in Dungay’s death to 
be stood down and for the coronial inquest to start as soon as possible.

Inquests into deaths in custody are mandatory, but may not be held for 12 to 
18 months following the date of death. A spokeswoman for the statecoroner told 
Guardian Australia the matter of Dungay’s death was still under review and no 
inquest date had yet been set.

Ken Canning, an Indigenous rights activist with ISJA, said Dungay had said he 
could not breathe when he was being restrained by officers.

He called for video footage of Dungay’s death to be made public, as it was in 
the case of Ms Dhu in Perth

 last week.



 Many people in the crowd were members of Dungay’s family and wearing shirts 
with his photo on them.

“My auntie stands here with no son,” said Elizabeth Jarrett, his sister. “My 
baby stands here with no uncle. Do you see what you are doing, Australia? Cease 
hostility against my people.”

The group was met by about eight police officers outside the Corrective 
Services building, before marching to The Block in Redfern.

A spokeswoman for Corrective Services told Guardian Australia the department 
respected the right to peaceful protest but could not comment as the matter had 
been referred to the coroner.

ISJA and Dungay’s family intend to hold another rally against Aboriginal 
deaths in custody outside the Sydney Town Hall on 29 December.
