i'm really looking forward to the Action Bronson album (which i also produced 
two songs on). i've heard some of the Jamie xx album which is really 
incredible. and the Hudmo album is amazing too. i think people are going to be 
surprised at how symphonic and soulful that it is. those are a few things to 
mention.

Bruno directed the video, along with Cameron Duddy. The Time were so visually 
striking, I really looked up to them as a kid. New Jack City, the film, was 
also an influence.

without James Brown, there would be no George Clinton. but George is certainly

Dr Funkenstein lately. it's mind blowing

Love Uptown Funk! Very deserving to be at the top of the UK charts. Parts of

Duran Duran were responsible for a lot of the first "funk" music i heard 
growing up, from "Notorious" to the "Reflex", etc... they always said that they 
wanted to sound like Chic so that makes sense. i learned alot, and continue to 
learn alot, from those men.

it took about 7 months to finish "uptown funk". Bruno was on tour so me and 
Jeff (Bhasker, who co-produced the album with me) would go meet him whenever he 
had a day off. whether it was in Los Angeles, Memphis, Toronto or London.

Version was such an unexpected thing. i made the covers just so i could play 
them in my dj sets and then Zane Lowe and Gilles Peterson started playing 
"Just" and I ended up getting a record deal from it. i feel really strongly 
about those batch of songs. i'm not sure if there's another batch of 12 songs 
that i feel so strongly about that i would want to do another covers album.

Looking across your discography do you have a favourite song? Until yesterday 
mine was Ooh Wee with Ghostface and Nate Dogg but I love I Can’t Lose with 
Keyone Starr - I think it’s my new favourite.

i still like hearing "ooh wee" and it's pretty great to me that it still gets 
played in hip hop clubs 10 years later. "i can't lose" is definitely one of my 
favourites off the new record. as is "summer breaking". you have great taste.

i'm not afraid to say i enjoy dj'ing weddings. you can play alot of fun tunes 
that you might not get away with at the Coronet in Brixton...as for Sir Paul's 
wedding, "temporary secretary" was a big hit. "Crazy in Love" is always great 
for weddings.

writing about music alot though. i wrote for my high school paper in NY 
reviewing gigs and interviewing rappers like KRS-One. i also wrote for a few 
heavy metal fanzines in my teenage years. i still enjoy some Pantera.

i love the day that we went to Daptone Studios in Brooklyn, NY for the first 
time. Back to Black had just come out but she hadn't met all the musicians that 
had played on the album. i introduced her to Nick, Homer, Tommy, Victor and 
Binky (the musicians) and they all were laughing for a while. and then we 
recorded Valerie for Version in an hour or so. that was a pretty magical day.

hudson mohawke is one of my favourite producers of the past few years. the 
song he co-produced on my album unfortunately had to be left off at the last 
minute due to sample issues. but i'm hoping to fix it and then put the song out 
in the spring. it also had A$AP Rocky on it. it's a banger. by the way, Hudmo's 
own album is coming soon. i've heard most of it and it's ridiculous.

i'm really looking forward to the Action Bronson album (which i also produced 
two songs on). i've heard some of the Jamie xx album which is really 
incredible. and the Hudmo album is amazing too. i think people are going to be 
surprised at how symphonic and soulful that it is. those are a few things to 
mention.

Bruno directed the video, along with Cameron Duddy. The Time were so visually 
striking, I really looked up to them as a kid. New Jack City, the film, was 
also an influence.

without James Brown, there would be no George Clinton. but George is certainly 
a genius. i've been listening to alot of Parliament & Funkadelic and Brides of 
Dr Funkenstein lately. it's mind blowing

Duran Duran were responsible for a lot of the first "funk" music i heard 
growing up, from "Notorious" to the "Reflex", etc... they always said that they 
wanted to sound like Chic so that makes sense. i learned alot, and continue to 
learn alot, from those men.

it took about 7 months to finish "uptown funk". Bruno was on tour so me and 
Jeff (Bhasker, who co-produced the album with me) would go meet him whenever he 
had a day off. whether it was in Los Angeles, Memphis, Toronto or London.

Version was such an unexpected thing. i made the covers just so i could play 
them in my dj sets and then Zane Lowe and Gilles Peterson started playing 
"Just" and I ended up getting a record deal from it. i feel really strongly 
about those batch of songs. i'm not sure if there's another batch of 12 songs 
that i feel so strongly about that i would want to do another covers album.

i still like hearing "ooh wee" and it's pretty great to me that it still gets 
played in hip hop clubs 10 years later. "i can't lose" is definitely one of my 
favourites off the new record. as is "summer breaking". you have great taste.

i'm not afraid to say i enjoy dj'ing weddings. you can play alot of fun tunes 
that you might not get away with at the Coronet in Brixton...as for Sir Paul's 
wedding, "temporary secretary" was a big hit. "Crazy in Love" is always great 
for weddings.

i love the day that we went to Daptone Studios in Brooklyn, NY for the first

had played on the album. i introduced her to Nick, Homer, Tommy, Victor and 
Binky (the musicians) and they all were laughing for a while. and then we 
recorded Valerie for Version in an hour or so. that was a pretty magical day.
