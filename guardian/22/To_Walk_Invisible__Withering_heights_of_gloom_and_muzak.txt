Surely Sally Wainwright should have called her Brontë play “A Hopeless Being” 
– Emily Brontë’s comment on her brother Branwell – as it all hinged on him and 
ended with his death (Last night’s TV, 30 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/30/to-walk-invisible-review-a-bleak-and-brilliant-portrayal-of-the-bronte-family>
). Calling it To Walk Invisible, which refers to the sisters’ wish to maintain 
anonymity after they began to publish, was a misnomer, leading me, at least, to 
expect a play concentrating on them and their writing, not on the dismal 
subject of Branwell’s decline. As it is, more could have been shown of the 
expectations and hopes his family had of him when he was seen as a brilliant 
poet and painter.

As for the swearing, this is an example of modern authors using quite 
inappropriate obscenities just because they can. It jerks one right out of 
period, whether Branwell would have used the F-word or not. If he had, the 
reaction of his father and sisters would have been much greater.

• In Sally Wainwright’s intelligent reimagining of the Brontës the hills 
certainly were alive with the sound of music – incessantly, and not in a good 
way. It suffocated mood and dialogue. Happens all the time, signalling lack of 
confidence in the material on the part of producers and directors. They need to 
be reminded that if they’re good enough, words are music.
