The German discount supermarkets Lidl  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lidl>and Aldi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/aldi> have sparked a new school uniform 
price war, with each chain offering an entire outfit for less than £4.

Lidl <https://www.theguardian.com/business/lidl> said the package of four 
primary school essentials – comprising two polo shirts, a sweater and trousers 
or pleated skirt – would go on sale for £3.75 next Thursday.

In response its rival Aldi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/aldi> slashed 
its earlier offer of £4 for its Back to School uniform – the same items – to 
just £3.69.


The parallel moves undercut other high street retailers by as much as 80%.


Aldi fired the opening shots in the new price war in June, when it launched 
its £4 uniform package – offering a round-neck sweater for just £1.25, a 
two-pack of plain polo shirts for £1.25 and a school skirt or pair of trousers 
for £1.50 – adding up to £4.

But cutting the price further this week, Tony Baines, managing director for 
corporate buying at Aldi, said: “In order to deliver outstanding quality at 
unbeatable prices, we have reduced the retail price of our Back to School 
uniform package from £4 to £3.69.”

Lidl said its collection – comprising 41 separate items and including 100% 
cotton fabrics and leather shoes – could save British families with two 
children up to £2,854 over their entire primary school education. The 
discounter claims it offers an 80% saving compared to John Lewis’s uniform 
range. At John Lewis, the same items cost £19, at Marks & Spencer they are £15, 
Sainsbury’s £13.50, Tesco £8.50 and at Asda £7.50.

 “Over the course of seven years at primary school, parents can find 
themselves racking up thousands of pounds in the cost of school uniforms, which 
can be especially tough on families with more than one child,” said Josie 
Stone, non-food buying manager for Lidl UK.

At this time of year, internet talkboards such as Mumsnet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mumsnet> are dominated by parents’ concerns 
that cheap, mass-produced, poor quality school uniforms are a false economy, as 
they will not last long when worn and washed regularly. Aldi said its range, in 
sizes 4-11, had been praised for its quality in independent tests.

Lidl insisted that, despite the price, product quality had not been 
overlooked. But earlier this year the chain sparkedcontroversy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/13/lidl-jeans-bangladesh-worker-pay-23p-an-hour>
 when it offered a pair of jeggings for just £5.99 at its 600-plus UK stores. 
The items were manufactured in Bangladesh, where the minimum legal wage for a 
garment worker is 23p an hour. Lidl said the school uniforms were made in 
Bangladesh and China.

 Martin Buttle, head of apparel and textiles at the Ethical Trading 
Initiative, said: “Paying an extra couple of pounds on a school uniform is not 
normally a massive cost to a UK consumer, but the difference can be huge to a 
Bangladeshi or Chinese garment worker.”
