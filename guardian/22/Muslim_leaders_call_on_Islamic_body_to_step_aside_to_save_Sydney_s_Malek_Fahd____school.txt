The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils’ financial mismanagement, 
governance failings, and self-interest has jeopardised the future of 
Australia’s largest Islamic school and its 2,500 students, leading figures from 
Australia’s Muslim community have alleged in an open letter.

AFIC should immediately terminate its agreements with Sydney’s Malek Fahd 
Islamic school so that the school can continue to operate, the letter, signed 
by nearly 40 prominent members of Australia’s Muslim community, says.

But spokesman for AFIC Keysar Trad told the Guardian that AFIC’s board had 
been comprehensively reformed, and that the organisation stood willing to help 
the school: “we have the best interests of the school at heart”.

Last week, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal upheld the Turnbull 
government’s 2016 decision to pull $19m in funding to Malek Fahd after 
<https://www.scribd.com/doc/300211320/Malek-Fahd-Islamic-School-Notice-of-Proposed-Decision>
 the school was found to be operating as a “for-profit” organisation, because 
of its agreements with AFIC.

The Commonwealth is the largest funder of the school, and the withdrawal of 
federal money may force the school to close. Currently, Malek Fahd, which 
operates across three campuses in westernSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>, has more than 2,500 
students enrolled from kindergarten to Year 12.

The open letter

 says “AFIC does not represent Australian Muslims”, and said the federation 
must immediately sever its arrangements with Malek Fahd so the school’s 
students can continue their educations.

“The Australian Muslim community is united with the broader community in its 
outrage over the gross financial mismanagement, governance failings and long 
history of financial self-interest on the part of the Australian Federation of 
Islamic Councils which prompted the funding withdrawal,” the letter says.

“We, the undersigned, demand that AFIC acts in the interests of the school, 
the Muslim community and the Australian public by immediately:


AFIC is operating as an undemocratic boys’ club with flagrant disregard for 
the wellbeing of Australian Muslims.

 * terminating the uncommercial lease agreements that are crippling the 
current MFIS board’s ability to secure the future of the school; 
 * returning all advanced rental payments for school-occupied land; 
 * returning the $1.42m borrowed from the school for land purchases; 
 * and turning school-occupied land over to an independently managed school 
trust. 
“It is our strongly held opinion that AFIC is continuing to operate as an 
undemocratic boys’ club with flagrant disregard for the wellbeing of Australian 
Muslims. AFIC does not represent us.”

The letter has several hundred supporters online

.

Trad, treasurer of AFIC, told Guardian Australia the organisation had 
democratic processes by which its members could seek change, and that public 
petitions were unhelpful and uninformed.

“This is an organisation that has changed. Seven out of nine board members of 
the organisation have changed... so that there can be no doubt about its 
commitment to fair and transparent and proper process. This is a different 
body, but the people bringing petitions don’t seem to understand the reforms 
that have been undertaken.

“This new body has done everything in its power to meet the requirements of 
the department of education so that the school can continue. We have the best 
interests of the school at heart, and we remain willing to sit down, anywhere, 
anytime, to negotiate a new arrangement to secure the future of the school.”


The Administrative Appeals Tribunal found last week Malek Fahd school was 
being run for profit and was not a fit and proper organisation.

Bernard McCabe, the AAT’s deputy president, said Malek Fahd appeared to be a 
good school with community support. But contractual relationships with the 
Australian Federation of Islamic Councils means government funding would 
continue to flow from the school to the federation.

“The only appropriate course is to affirm the decision [to revoke federal 
funding],”McCabe wrote in his ruling 
<http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AATA/2016/1087.html>. “That is a hard 
outcome for [Malek Fahd] and for the students and community it serves. But the 
ultimate responsibility must be laid at the door of the previous management of 
[the school].”

Simon Birmingham, the federal education minister, welcomed the AAT’s ruling to 
withdraw Malek Fahd’s funding, saying the school had been operating for profit 
in breach of the Australian Education Act. “Australians rightly expect that 
every taxpayer dollar committed to school education is genuinely expended on 
school education,” Birmingham said. “School governance should be of the highest 
standard and funding should be exclusively used for the education and welfare 
of students.

“Our attention now turns to working with the students and their families, the 
teachers and the whole school community about how we best support them through 
this difficult time.”

Malek Fahd operates over three campuses in Sydney’s west in Greenacre, Hoxton 
Park and Beaumont Hills. Between 2012 and 2015, it received more than $76m in 
financial assistance from the commonwealth, as well as money from the New South 
Wales government and tuition income from parents.

It is estimated roughly two-thirds of Malek Fahd’s income in 2014-15 came from 
the federal government.
