It seems ironic that the prime minister’s journey to India (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/theresa-may-visa-offer-india-citizens-uk>
, 8 November) should coincide with the Sheffield Hallamreport 
<http://www4.shu.ac.uk/research/cresr/sites/shu.ac.uk/files/cresr30th-jobs-welfare-austerity.pdf>
 on the devastating hollowing out of UK manufacturing. Where have our 
manufacturing jobs gone but to poorly paid workers in India and China, where 
exploitative working conditions and child labour are rife? Should we not be 
erecting more tariff barriers rather than seeking to remove them?

• John Crace is right to suggest the Royal Festival Hall as a place to start 
taking out “a huge swath of the liberal metropolitan elite” (Digested week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/11/the-week-started-with-an-old-school-jailbreak-and-ended-with->
, 12 November). Last week I was there watching Abel Gance’s magnificent film 
Napoleon. Near the end, when Napoleon, alone, waxes eloquent about his vision 
of a Europe without borders, most of the audience erupted in cheers and 
applause, drowning out the relatively few boos (not to mention the accompanying 
Philharmonia Orchestra).

• Emma Brockes’ friend (Notebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/white-safety-net-worried-about-trump>

remind her that Israel is the country that has already built its wall.

• A large, wealthy retailer makes a TV Christmas advert (John Lewis bets on 
Buster the boxer for sales bounce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/10/john-lewis-christmas-ad-2016-dog-trampoline>
, 10 November) and the Guardian devotes half a news page to it. The power of 
free advertising, eh.

• I would like to alert readers to a potential hazard this Christmas. Here in 
north London foxes regularly poo on our trampoline. Just mentioning it.
