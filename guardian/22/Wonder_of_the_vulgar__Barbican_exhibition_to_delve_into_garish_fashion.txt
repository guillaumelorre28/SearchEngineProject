The Barbican <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbican> gallery has 
announced a new exhibition for the autumn dedicated to vulgarity in fashion 
from the renaissance to the present day.


The Vulgar: Fashion Redefined was conceived by exhibition maker Judith Clark 
and psychoanalyst Adam Phillips. It explores how ideas of vulgarity have 
changed and evolved, from extreme 18th-century corsets to the modern trend for 
oversized logos.

The exhibition will include 18th-century mantuas, with overskirts of nearly 
2.5 metres in width, and stomachers, the panel of embroidery worn over corsets. 
These will be contrasted with more modern items, such asVivienne Westwood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vivienne-westwood> and Malcolm McLaren’s 
“tits” T-shirt bearing a photograph of naked breasts, and oversized hats from 
the milliner Stephen Jones.

It also explores what good taste is at any given moment, which is particularly 
relevant now that high fashion brands such as Vetements, Moschino and Gucci 
embrace the garish and downright tacky. Vetements’signature piece is a T-shirt 
with DHL branding

, hardly the expected aspirational logo.

Jane Alison, head of visual arts at the Barbican 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbican>, praised the curators for 
creating “a highly original, redefining and hugely enjoyable exhibition about 
fashion past and present”.


She said it followed on from previous Barbican fashion exhibitions including 
Jam: Style+Music+Media in 1996, The House of Viktor & Rolf in 2008, and Future 
Beauty: 30 Years of Japanese Fashion in 2010.
