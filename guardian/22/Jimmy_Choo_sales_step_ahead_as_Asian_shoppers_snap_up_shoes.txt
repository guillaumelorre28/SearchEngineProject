sales in 2015 as Asian shoppers snapped up its luxury shoes.

In Europe, Jimmy Choo benefited from rising tourist numbers, but highlighted 
the loss of Russian visitors at its European stores amid the country’s economic 
malaise, and the impact of the Paris terror attacks. Its US business made “good 
progress” despite volatile exchange rates and competition.

Shoes accounted for more than three-quarters of revenues, with men’s footwear 
again Jimmy Choo’s fastest growing category even though women’s shoes remain 
its bread and butter.

Accessories sales were stable, with a trend towards smaller bags. The firm 
recently launched its Illicit fragrance for women and continues to roll out 
men’s fragrances. It also highlighted successes in sunglasses and eyewear.

The company, founded in 1996 by shoe designer Jimmy Choo and Vogue accessories 
editor Tamara Mellon, said retail net revenues grew by 9% at constant exchange 
rates to £208m last year, contributing to 7% growth in overall revenues to 
£318m.

Peter Harf, the chairman, said: “The company successfully reversed the 
first-half decline in wholesale revenues and is on track with growth forecasts 
in Asia and Japan where brand awareness continues to grow strongly.”

Jimmy Choo has been refitting some of its 140 stores around the world and said 
this had paid off.


Shares in the London-listed company were up 1.7% to 129.5p just before midday 
on Thursday.
