A family member in Barcelona first took me to this restaurant about 10 years 
ago. She knows I like to eat wild rabbit, and she told me she’d found a place 
that has an amazing recipe for pickled hare. It’s quite a traditional 
restaurant in the uptown Eixample area and they like to follow the roots of the 
recipes then play around with the presentation and add a twist to them.

But they don’t take risks with the taste, and preserve those well known 
Barcelona flavours. They have a lobster with chickpea soup that’s fantastic and 
they like to serve game in winter. They also serve old-style hare with black 
truffle sauce and the homemade cannelloni with pig trotters is amazing.

It used to be a bar, before developing into a restaurant and it’s got smarter 
over the years. They used to just have paper tablecloths but now they use 
linen. The ambience is quite intimate – you could definitely go for a romantic 
dinner. I try to go every time I visit Barcelona – it’s great for family 
celebrations. It’s always full, so book well in advance.
