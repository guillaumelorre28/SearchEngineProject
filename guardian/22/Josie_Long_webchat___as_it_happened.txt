Thank you loads for asking me things, I can't believe how quickly it's gone. 
Sorry if i didn't answer your question about why my charity won't be right wing

Thank you! I am writing a screenplay for a feature film at the moment, it's 
been in development for about 18 months and I've just finished the 4th draft of 
it. We have cool producers and we are hoping to shoot it up in Glasgow this 
summer. It's with the same director as the short films and sort of continuing 
similar characters and themes. It's a sort of sad comedy about an earnest woman 
(played by me!) whose life falls apart, about all of her friendships and 
relationships and political dreams. Hopefully it will really happen and it 
won't be bad!

Dairy Milk or Galaxy?

Don’t say neither.

I think probably Dairy Milk. Does that mean something terrible about my 
personality? The best dairy milk is australian dairy milk imho, it's so sour, 
delicious!
I was obviously, devastated about the creme egg recipe change.

Hello Josie. I have followed your comedy for years and love your work, however 
I hold almost diametrically opposed views to you on almost everything and last 
time I came to your show it made me think how much of a bell end you would

ha! I am amazed that you can tolerate my stuff. If it works for you then I am 
happy to have you, and I'm sorry that we will never agree. How funny that you

Yeah, I would love to have my grandma back just for a little bit. She really 
looked after me and we had a lovely relationship, writing to each other and 
sharing books and music. I really miss her voice and her way of speaking- she 
could be very stern and brusque but was very funny and animated. I miss her 
flat and her possessions and how they were laid out. I miss being able to see 
all of her pictures and cards on the walls, her desk and things like that!

How much do you detest Orpington? On a scale of 1 to Petts Wood.

it's weird because growing up I really hated it, I was desperate to get to 
"real london"- i thought it was grotty and boring and smug and all of these 
things. Now I am getting a bit older I am trying to make my peace with it. I 
really loved my school, and the charity shops are out of this world, especially 
in Petts Wood. It's a funny place to me, because I always saw it as not near 
enough to london to be exciting and not far enough away to be pretty, and very 
conservative. But I think a lot of my feelings about it were related to my 
upbringing and just general desperation to get to be a writer and a performer. 
Also there used to be a second hand bookshop there and the guy who ran it gave 
me books for free. And you could get a round of toast for 20p at Poppins cafe 
in my day. Now I am just thinking nostalgically about Orpington: the walnuts 
leisure centre! The library! It's not a bad place!

Thank you for releasing Romance and Adventure 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9WBd_yvrg0> online. Is there any chance that 
you might upload any of your other shows?

And I seem to remember that you were writing a book. How is that going?

Oh, and will you record more episodes of Utter Shambles 
<http://uttershamblespodcast.tumblr.com/>?

I don't need to answer about Utter Shambles because kagcool has done it for 
me. I'm releasing my shows from 2010 and 2011, which are both about politics, 
via Lost Map Records, and they should be out really soon. I'm also hoping to 
release my latest show at some point, too. I'm really hoping to have a book out 
soon.

"My favourite MP? I have a few. I really like Dennis Skinner, John McDonnell 
and Caroline Lucas"

anred <http://moderation.discussion.gutools.co.uk/moderation/users/2960183/> 
asks:

Who is your favourite MP?

Josie’s reply 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/live/2015/jan/23/josie-long-webchat-cara-josephine?commentpage=3#comment-46665966>
:

Ooo. I have a few. I really like Dennis Skinner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dennis-skinner>, of course. He’s 
principled, he’s proud and he’s really sarcastic and funny. I likeJohn McDonnell
 <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell>, because he isn’t afraid 
to vote with integrity and supports a lot of important causes – I always see him
on Twitter <https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellmp> backing things I approve of 
and I see him at protests too. And obviously,Caroline Lucas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/caroline-lucas> – who is fantastic. And 
Tom Watson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tom-watson> too – he is a 
power house, who has done some of the most important and difficult work, with 
Leveson and with this abuse scandal, he’s an asset to the country (if that 
doesn’t sound ridiculous!). There’s loads of others that I really like as well. 
I would say I don’t believe any MP is without fault, but I’m definitely not 
cynical about them.

I recently attended a comedy night and the main act bombed. However, the 
supporting performers were loudly laughing at almost every gag, it seemed 
disingenuous. Their arse licking felt like part of a comedy hierachy. Is this 
common on the comedy circuit?

It probably wasn't disingenuous. Quite often, at really bad gigs, there's a 
sense of complete camaraderie amongst the comics. Sometimes, it can make the 
experience of dying on your arse more bearable. Also, comics tend to love 
comedy. I really think on the whole the circuit is a supportive place - not 
always, but most of the time.

"I dream of getting to talk about Joanna Newsom all the time"

Hi, Josie. You recently tweeted that life, at the moment, was just one long 
waiting game forJoanna Newsom <https://www.theguardian.com/music/joanna-newsom>

Basically, I dream of getting to talk about Joanna Newsom all the time. I 
think she's phenomenally talented. When I think of people around my age who I 
think are really culturally significant and the closest that I would get to 
being a genius i think of her. Her music is so VAST and expansive, and her 
lyrics are so intelligent that I never get bored of them. Her vocabulary and 
the way she uses folkloric stuff just floors me. I think as a poet she's not 
acknowledged enough, let alone as a musician. As you can tell, I just 
completely love her, and I love the fact that she makes this strange esoteric, 
long music completely in her own fashion!

No, but all the time with Josie Lawrence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/aug/13/features.magazine57>, the 
improviser and actor. Which is hard, because she’s much better than me and I 
feel like if I died suddenly everyone would be like “Oh no that woman off of
Whose Line Is It Anyway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/11/josie-lawrence-greg-proops-whose-line-is-it-anyway>
 is dead!” I once got introduced onstage on one of my own tour shows as Josie 
Lawrence. The theatre was booked in my name, I was on all the tour posters. I 
was like, “how the hell did you get this wrong?!” I had to go onstage and 
apologise. Hopefully the audience weren’t too disappointed.

Do you think the lack of political thought and activity in young people is due

:

I don’t think there is a lack of political thought and activity among young 
people – look at the Scottish referendum. A whole generation (that’s a bit of a 
wanky thing to say, sorry) of 16 to 18 year olds so passionately engaged. Young 
people we work with atArts Emergency <http://www.arts-emergency.org/> are very 
political. But I’d like to see more education and obviously democratic reform – 
proportional representation (anything other than first past the post).

Thank you! I am writing a screenplay for a feature film at the moment, it's 
been in development for about 18 months and I've just finished the 4th draft of 
it. We have cool producers and we are hoping to shoot it up in Glasgow this 
summer. It's with the same director as the short films and sort of continuing 
similar characters and themes. It's a sort of sad comedy about an earnest woman 
(played by me!) whose life falls apart, about all of her friendships and 
relationships and political dreams. Hopefully it will really happen and it 
won't be bad!

I think probably Dairy Milk. Does that mean something terrible about my 
personality? The best dairy milk is australian dairy milk imho, it's so sour, 
delicious!
I was obviously, devastated about the creme egg recipe change.

Hello Josie. I have followed your comedy for years and love your work, however 
I hold almost diametrically opposed views to you on almost everything and last 
time I came to your show it made me think how much of a bell end you would 
think I am if we ever met. Shall I just not bother in future?

ha! I am amazed that you can tolerate my stuff. If it works for you then I am 
happy to have you, and I'm sorry that we will never agree. How funny that you 
still like it, I would say you are some kind of rare masochist but you're very 
welcome!

Yeah, I would love to have my grandma back just for a little bit. She really 
looked after me and we had a lovely relationship, writing to each other and 
sharing books and music. I really miss her voice and her way of speaking- she 
could be very stern and brusque but was very funny and animated. I miss her 
flat and her possessions and how they were laid out. I miss being able to see 
all of her pictures and cards on the walls, her desk and things like that!

How much do you detest Orpington? On a scale of 1 to Petts Wood.

it's weird because growing up I really hated it, I was desperate to get to 
"real london"- i thought it was grotty and boring and smug and all of these 
things. Now I am getting a bit older I am trying to make my peace with it. I 
really loved my school, and the charity shops are out of this world, especially 
in Petts Wood. It's a funny place to me, because I always saw it as not near 
enough to london to be exciting and not far enough away to be pretty, and very 
conservative. But I think a lot of my feelings about it were related to my 
upbringing and just general desperation to get to be a writer and a performer. 
Also there used to be a second hand bookshop there and the guy who ran it gave 
me books for free. And you could get a round of toast for 20p at Poppins cafe 
in my day. Now I am just thinking nostalgically about Orpington: the walnuts 
leisure centre! The library! It's not a bad place!

I don't need to answer about Utter Shambles because kagcool has done it for 
me. I'm releasing my shows from 2010 and 2011, which are both about politics, 
via Lost Map Records, and they should be out really soon. I'm also hoping to 
release my latest show at some point, too. I'm really hoping to have a book out 
soon.

:

Ooo. I have a few. I really like Dennis Skinner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dennis-skinner>, of course. He’s 
principled, he’s proud and he’s really sarcastic and funny. I likeJohn McDonnell
 <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell>, because he isn’t afraid 
to vote with integrity and supports a lot of important causes – I always see him
on Twitter <https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellmp> backing things I approve of 
and I see him at protests too. And obviously,Caroline Lucas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/caroline-lucas> – who is fantastic. And 
Tom Watson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tom-watson> too – he is a 
power house, who has done some of the most important and difficult work, with 
Leveson and with this abuse scandal, he’s an asset to the country (if that 
doesn’t sound ridiculous!). There’s loads of others that I really like as well. 
I would say I don’t believe any MP is without fault, but I’m definitely not 
cynical about them.

I recently attended a comedy night and the main act bombed. However, the 
supporting performers were loudly laughing at almost every gag, it seemed 
disingenuous. Their arse licking felt like part of a comedy hierachy. Is this 
common on the comedy circuit?

It probably wasn't disingenuous. Quite often, at really bad gigs, there's a 
sense of complete camaraderie amongst the comics. Sometimes, it can make the 
experience of dying on your arse more bearable. Also, comics tend to love 
comedy. I really think on the whole the circuit is a supportive place - not 
always, but most of the time.

Hi, Josie. You recently tweeted that life, at the moment, was just one long

Basically, I dream of getting to talk about Joanna Newsom all the time. I 
think she's phenomenally talented. When I think of people around my age who I 
think are really culturally significant and the closest that I would get to 
being a genius i think of her. Her music is so VAST and expansive, and her 
lyrics are so intelligent that I never get bored of them. Her vocabulary and 
the way she uses folkloric stuff just floors me. I think as a poet she's not 
acknowledged enough, let alone as a musician. As you can tell, I just 
completely love her, and I love the fact that she makes this strange esoteric, 
long music completely in her own fashion!

No, but all the time with Josie Lawrence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/aug/13/features.magazine57>, the 
improviser and actor. Which is hard, because she’s much better than me and I 
feel like if I died suddenly everyone would be like “Oh no that woman off of
Whose Line Is It Anyway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/11/josie-lawrence-greg-proops-whose-line-is-it-anyway>
 is dead!” I once got introduced onstage on one of my own tour shows as Josie 
Lawrence. The theatre was booked in my name, I was on all the tour posters. I 
was like, “how the hell did you get this wrong?!” I had to go onstage and 
apologise. Hopefully the audience weren’t too disappointed.

:

I don’t think there is a lack of political thought and activity among young 
people – look at the Scottish referendum. A whole generation (that’s a bit of a 
wanky thing to say, sorry) of 16 to 18 year olds so passionately engaged. Young 
people we work with atArts Emergency <http://www.arts-emergency.org/> are very 
political. But I’d like to see more education and obviously democratic reform – 
proportional representation (anything other than first past the post).
