Bruce Springsteen and Grandmaster Flash might not sound like natural 
bedfellows but Stuart Vevers managed to make a rock-hip hop mash-up look 
totally feasible on theCoach <http://uk.coach.com/> catwalk, done out with 
girders to look a bit like a building site. See loads of plaid, combat boots, 
bucket hats straight out of a Jamal Shabaz street style picture, and the 
excellently named Gotham tote bag.

‘It’s a New York brand so I’m looking at things from New York,’ said Vevers. 
‘There are parallels between Bruce’s poetic rebellion and the early hip hop 
scene.’ Certainly in the hands of Vevers. Add XXXXL puffas, biker jackets and 
skinny straight-legged trousers and here’s an autumn 2016 look that is both 
born to run and a rapper’s delight.
