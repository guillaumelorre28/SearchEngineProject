High-shine, jet black, gloss and smoke – find the words that summon the 
deepest, shiniest midnight non-colours with which to polish your nails this 
season, and use them, liberally. At Julien Macdonald nails were perfect and 
square, and matched the drama of the models’ gothic eyes, but black nails work 
well, too, as a kind of anti-manicure, slightly chipped, with nothing but a 
smear of red lipstick to show that you know you’re alive.
