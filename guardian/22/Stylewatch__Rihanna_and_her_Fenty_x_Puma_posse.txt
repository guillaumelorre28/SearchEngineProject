A backstage group shot is now a bit of a thing, following the Kardashian-Jenner

 clan gathering after the Life of Pablo launch in February, in which they were 
dressed to resemble a pack of very expensive afghan hounds. Rihanna’s Fenty 
show, on Wednesday evening in Paris, sees a similar setup, but with a flock of 
models dressed in the spring/summer collection. Rihanna herself is, of course, 
the centrepiece – complete with RiRi fan (want) and sugar pink co-ords (need). 
Her excellently diverse gang of Fenty-wearing models look, as you might when 
you’re hanging out with the woman who uses a glass ofwine as accessory

, like they’re having a great time, smiles all round.

That might be the best advertisement for a collection, closely followed by the 
clothes. The second collection that Rihanna created for Puma, it wisely 
followed a formula close to her heart: part classic streetwear, part clothes 
most people might wear to bed. See slip dresses, parkas, hoodies, pyjamas, 
robes and caps, across women’s and menswear. A favourite piece is the camisole 
crossed with a string vest, worn by a male model with pearls, seen here on the 
back row, second from left. Apparently,Rihanna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna> said, “Let’s do this thing, let’s 
make some money” before the show. With all these guys, plus camisole-string 
vests on her side, she’ll no doubt do just that.
