Sony’s PlayStation VR headset launches this week, offering a more affordable 
and intuitive introduction to the concept than the likes of the HTC Vive and 
Oculus Rift. All you need is aPlayStation 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/playstation-4>, a PlayStation Camera – 
and the £350 headset itself of course.

If you’ve taken the plunge into virtual gaming, here are the nine games we’d 
recommend trying first.

Rez Infinite (Enhance Games, £25)

The reboot of Tetsuya Mizuguchi’s cult rhythm shooter Rez may deliver familiar 
content, but its a tremendous fit for VR. The on-rails, sonic journey through a 
world built from rave flyers and ancient architecture is a wonder to explore 
via a headset, and delightfully reminiscent of the VR vision the 1990s 
promised, and promptly failed to deliver.

 Understated gem … Tumble VR. Photograph: Supermassive Games 
If Sony’s headset brings an understated gem to the table, it is surely Tumble 
VR. This simple puzzle game sees players piling up blocks to meet various 
goals, whether reaching for height, deflecting lasers or building round 
obstacles. The pleasure is in the highly tactile nature of selecting and 
placing blocks, making it feel very much like a simulated form of Jenga. 
Atypically meditative in contrast to its launch lineup stable mates, Tumble VR 
is as rewarding as it is modest.

 Dogfighting in space … EVE Valkyrie. Photograph: CCP 
Since the prototype Oculus Rift rekindled affection for VR, the traditional 3D 
space shooter has enjoyed a return to prominence. The reason? Glancing around 
and out your cockpit as you dogfight in the stars is a beguiling notion, and as 
there’s no character movement, it’s much easier on those who have limited space 
or are prone to motion sickness. In practice, everything works rather well, and 
while Valkyrie isn’t perfect, it hammers home a VR fantasy many have waited a 
considerable time to experience: shooting aliens from inside a cool spacecraft.

Batman: Arkham VR (Warner Bros, £16)
 Dark Knight as detective … Batman Arkham VR. Photograph: Warner Bros 
Devoted to the Dark Knight’s role as detective, Batman: Arkham VR highlights 
the fact that virtual reality can be at its strongest when shunning action. 
Here the emphasis is on a series of scenes where the Caped Crusader gathers 
clues and solves crimes. Rocksteady’s game may be too fleeting for some, but it 
offers an astounding sense of presence – that feeling you really are inhabiting 
its world. And seeing yourself reflected in a mirror wearing the bat suit is an 
extraordinary moment.

 Super Hypercube. Photograph: Kokoromi 
Best described as a cross between Tetris and Super Hexagon, Kokoromi’s trippy, 
first-person puzzler has players reorganising clusters of blocks in order to 
navigate a series of approaching walls – each with a specifically shaped gap to 
slip through. The virtual reality element is subtly used, allowing clusters to 
be viewed from all angles, and the minimalist, hyper-colourful design makes for 
a highly sensual environment. This is a beautifully constructed score chaser.

 Cosmic obstacle course … Thumper. Photograph: Drool 
Billed as a rhythm violence game, Thumper is a sort of cosmic obstacle course 
swirling through a bullet hell shooter. The simple controls have you piloting a 
metallic beetle along a galactic track, hitting buttons to take corners, leap 
over barriers and fire missiles, all to a driving electronic beat. Designed by 
ex-members of the Harmonix team (makers ofGuitar Hero and Rock Band 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/06/rock-band-guitar-hero-music-games-returning>
), it’s a visually astonishing test of timing and coordination.

 Boisterous anti-realism … Job Simulator. Photograph: Owlchemy Labs 
Transporting players to a cartoonish realm, Job simulator demonstrates VR’s 
capacity to host a new form of comedy. This is a game that – through anarchic 
simulations of careers from chef to office worker – offers a boisterous 
anti-realism. It perhaps makes a strength of unruly interaction, but is 
delightfully silly, and perfect for introducing friends to VR.

 Mini-gangland drama … London Heist. Photograph: Sony 
This collection of short VR experiences, developed by Sony’s in-house studios 
give a polished and varied introduction to the technology. London Heist is a 
mini-gangland drama with some truly astonishing moments of embodiment, while 
Ocean Descent is a picturesque diving experience, and Street Luge is an 
interesting urban racer with a quite dizzying sense of speed. Another launch 
title that’s great for showing off the headset to curious friends and 
neighbours.

 Football heading sim … Headmaster. Photograph: Frame Interactive 
Developed during a virtual reality game jam co-sponsored by Valve, the comedic 
influence of the Portal developer is clear in this football heading sim. Set in 
a sort of sporting prison camp players have to successfully complete a series 
of heading tests, using just the requisite body movement to control the ball 
into a variety of tests and targets. It’s weird, funny, challenging and 
compelling, the lack of handheld controls adding to the easy, intuitive feel. 
An offbeat take on the sports sim that really makes the best of the hardware.
