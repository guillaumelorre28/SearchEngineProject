Khadija Balayma Allieu sits on her hospital bed, grimacing at every movement 
of her legs. It has been five days since she was forcibly genitally mutilated, 
she says.


As she receives treatment in the eastern Sierra Leonean town of Kenema, 
Khadija, 28, recounts what she went through at the hands of five cutters. She 
is now in hiding because the soweis – as the cutters are known locally – are 
looking for her.

Khadija says she was blindfolded and held by five or six women. “They gagged 
me as I shouted. Then [one of them] started cutting. They held my head down. I 
started bleeding profusely. I tried screaming but there was cloth inside my 
mouth.”

Khadija, the mother of a 12-year-old boy, says she was left locked inside the 
house for four days “without food or medicine”. Eventually, the police were 
alerted. They raided the house, extracting her through a smashed window.

As Khadija explains her nightmare, she constantly wipes away tears and turns 
her sunken eyes towards the window, to be sure no one is coming to get her. She 
is in genuine fear for her life.

The woman accused of cutting her, Elsie Kondoromoh, is an influential figure in
Sierra Leone <https://www.theguardian.com/world/sierraleone>. Initially 
detained by police, she was released when hundreds of cutters mounted a protest 
outside the police station. Kondoromoh’s supporters have been to the courthouse 
to make a case for legal investigations against her to be dropped.

Police inspector Marty Tarawille said: “[Kondoromoh] was with us [at the 
police station] but the sowei people came in numbers …They were singing, they 
were shouting that we should leave that lady [alone] … If we had not released 
her it would have been a problem for us in this station.”

The case highlights the challenges facing anti-FGM campaigners in Sierra 
Leone. The minister for social welfare, Sylvia Blyden, has said the 
government’s focus is on children under 18. This is seen as leaving adult women 
free to decide what they do with their bodies.

FGM has been banned in the country since emergency health measures were 
introduced after the Ebola outbreak in 2014. But despite the continued ban,the 
practice has returned through all-female secret societies, the Bondo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/aug/24/sierra-leone-female-genital-mutilation-soweis-secret-societies-fear>
and condemnation by the authorities has become increasingly absent.

In August, a young woman died in the northern town of Makeni shortly after 
undergoing the procedure 
<http://forwarduk.org.uk/press-release-young-woman-dies-undergoing-fgm-sierra-leone/>
, prompting the arrest of several soweis. In another recent case, police say 
children were rescued from a disused house in Magburaka, also in the north, 
after undergoing an initiation ceremony.

The World Health Organisation estimates that 88% of women in Sierra Leone 
<http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/> between the 
ages of 15 and 49 have undergone FGM.

That the women who converged on the police station were able to secure 
Kondoromoh’s release is indicative of the power soweis wield in Sierra Leonean 
culture. Civil society organisations have called for Khadija to be evacuated 
from the town, expressing concern for her safety, but fear of the soweis is 
such that campaigners are afraid to come to the fore.

“The soweis are so powerful that nowhere in Sierra Leone will be safe for her 
again,” one activist says.

Kondoromoh, who is national vice-president of the Sowei council, admits she 
carried out the procedure but says she did not force Khadija to go through with 
it. She claims Khadija asked for it.

“She met me at home saying she was being taunted by her fellow women because 
she had not been circumcised,” says Kondoromoh. “She came to me to initiate her 
and asked how much it would cost. I told her that I did not want anything from 
her because she was being provoked. I took her to a nearby society bush to 
initiate her”.

Kondoromoh says Khadija asked to stay with her until she recovered because she 
would be taunted if she went back home: “I bought her provision. I woke up 
every morning to prepare food for her before leaving home.”

Medics treating Khadija say her condition is improving, but predict it will 
take some time for her to heal both medically and psychologically. One nurse 
described her as “badly traumatised”.

“With elections in early 2018, it is unlikely the government will take any 
serious action against the soweis, who will now be emboldened by their apparent 
success in having their way,” says a local journalist whose radio station has 
been threatened if it continues to cover the issues surrounding FGM.

He believes that even if the matter reaches court – “which is unlikely” – the 
victim will be in danger if she testifies.
