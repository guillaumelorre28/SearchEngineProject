Hasbro has reported its biggest jump in quarterly revenue in nearly five 
years, driven by demand for toys based on theStar Wars: The Force Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii> and Jurassic World 
movies.

 Revenue from toys targeted at boys, which include action figures based on the 
two blockbuster films released last year, surged 35% to $569.8m (£395m) in the 
final three months of 2015.

 Industry-wide sales of Star Wars-licensed merchandise totalled about $700m in 
the US in 2015, according to retail researchers NPD Group.

 Larger rival Mattel reported a surprise rise in quarterly net sales this 
month as sales of Barbie dolls recovered and demand rose for Hot Wheels toys, 
driven by Star-Wars-licensed items such as the Millennium Falcon Starship.
