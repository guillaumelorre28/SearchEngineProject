I love Claire Ptak’s recipes, but the photograph showing her removing the 
stone from an avocado – holding the fruit in the palm of her left hand while 
tapping the stone with the knife held in her right – for her chocolate avocado 
mousse, made me blanch (Let there be light 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/07/chocolate-avocado-mousse-recipe-claire-ptak-baking>
, Cook, 7 January).

I used this method once after seeing it illustrated in a magazine. The knife 
went straight through the avocado and nearly cut my finger off, resulting in 11 
stitches and plastic surgery on the nerve.

The surgeon told me that there were three types of knife/finger accidents: the 
oyster-opening one, the avocado one, and the separating-two-frozen-burgers one. 
A paradigm of the British class system perhaps?
