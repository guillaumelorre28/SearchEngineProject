Winning tip: Benirrás beach


A beautiful approach, meandering down through hills and valleys, brings you to 
the beach at Benirrás. In Ibiza’s north, this is a pretty stretch of sand and 
pebbles, with rocks on either side that you can clamber over, and it offers an 
eye-catching view across the water to an interesting rock formation known as 
Cap Bernat (“the hand of God” to locals). The sea bed is rocky, which makes it 
excellent for snorkelling. This sheltered bay is a popular anchoring spot for 
private yachts and motor boats, which gather in the late afternoon to enjoy the 
romantic sundown, accompanied on Sundays by the drummers who descend on the 
beach to “drum down the sunset” – it’s a unique Ibiza experience, established 
over many years.

Sa Talaiassa, a 1,560ft (475-metre) mountain, is the highest point in Ibiza, 
signposted from St Josep in the south-west of the island. It offers a 
breathtaking view from east and west coasts. You can watch the sunset in all 
its glory, listening to nothing but the sound of nature. To the east, you’ll 
see the island darkening beneath a beautiful purple sky, while the west is 
still lit in a deep orange sunset. It’s the most magical way to experience the 
natural beauty of Ibiza for free.

This is a vibrant place set within the lobby of the island’s historic former 
theatre. Pereyra is situated in the Old Town, with jazz, soul and Latin 
performances on stage from 11.30pm until 3.30am. The varied selection of drinks 
go up in price once the music kicks in, but you won’t find a better mojito, and 
there is no entrance fee or silly VIP area. A varied (though not exclusively) 
mature crowd, real music, no queues and subtle lighting make for a memorable 
evening.

This tiny village has the best location on Ibiza. Amid olive, lemon and citrus 
groves, it is perched on a headland with clear, uninterrupted views over the 
silver-sprayed sea to the island of Formentera. Explore the lovely old church 
or walk down steep steps to the white sandy beach, before heading back to enjoy 
the vista from the terrace of family-run Bar Llumbi – it serves fresh fish or 
paella for €12.

We discovered a little gem of a restaurant when we were exploring the many 
beautiful coves Ibiza has to offer. A bit off the beaten track, Cala Mastella 
is a tiny cove lined with small, rustic fishing huts. Scramble over the rocks 
to the left and you will find El Bigotes, a tiny eatery that is always buzzing 
with people at lunchtime. Only one dish is served here, an amazing fish stew, 
cooked over a wood fire. Arrive early or you won’t get a table. A true Ibizan 
experience.

Ibiza is a hub for alternative living, and arguably just as many people flock 
to the island to experience that as they do for the clubbing scene. Casita 
Verde is a long-established community promoting a more sustainable way of life, 
in idyllic surroundings. Open to the public every Sunday from 2-7pm, it serves 
a homemade, and homegrown, vegetarian lunch for only €7. You can tuck in under 
the shade of a gorgeous carob tree while enjoying live music and the sea view. 
Afterwards you can take part in a guided tour to see the accommodation for 
those who live there (yurts and tree-houses galore) and learn about the compost 
toilets, solar panels and plants.

We went to Santa Eulalia last year – it’s a clean, pleasant, upmarket-looking 
resort with a promenade that’s made for people-watching. Liquido Cocktail Bar 
has a great view over the marina – you could be in Cannes. The boss looks like 
he came over here in the 90s, and likes to showcase his love of northern soul. 
The cocktails aren’t all that cheap, but great service and atmosphere make up 
for it. I would recommend the Hawaiian Explosion and the Mai Tai, but I regret 
not trying the enormous G&Ts I saw other people drinking ...

Sample the other side of Ibiza on a bike. Route 19 winds upwards and 
northwards from Ibiza town for 60km. Soon you are pedalling through villages 
with traditional churches and cafes. Fields of olives and swaying cypresses 
stretch out before you, until you arrive in St Llorenç. Take in the view of the 
sea, sparkling in the evening light, and pop in toLa Paloma 
<http://palomaibiza.com/> restaurant for a tasty gazpacho (€6) or a delicious 
fish stew (€15).

Head to the very north of the island, down an unpaved rough track, and you’re 
rewarded with a stunning small cove with old fishing huts, a handful of 
sunbathers and a littlechiringuito. The abandoned hotel at the back of the 
beach just adds to the uniqueness of the spot. Just don’t tell anyone.
