Take me there: Maastricht


Why go?
OK, so it’s not Rio, but Maastricht knows how to throw a carnival party, 
albeit with brass bands and giant puppets instead of samba and sequins. Even if 
you visit outside the raucouspre-Lenten street celebrations 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_in_the_Netherlands> (15-17 February) 
there’s plenty to enjoy. Maastricht University attracts an international mix of 
students and the choice of cool places to stay and eat, arthouse cinemas and 
alternative shops makes this one of Europe’s most underrated destinations.

What to do
Start your explorations in one of the city’s two handsome squares: het Vrijthof
 <http://www.holland.com/global/tourism/article/het-vrijthof.htm>, overlooked 
by the imposing Sint-Servaas Basilica, or the Markt, where you’ll find the town 
hall and Maastricht’s biggest food and flower market. Once you’ve seen the main 
sights – the old-town fortifications,Bonnefantenmuseum 
<http://www.bonnefanten.nl/en/> with its paintings by Brueghel and Rubens and 
theSint-Servaasbrug bridge 
<http://www.holland.com/uk/tourism/article/sintservaasbrug-2.htm> – wander into 
the Wyck neighbourhood, a perfect spot for people-watching (tryCafé Zondag 
<http://www.cafezondag.nl/> on Wycker Brugstraat 42) and browsing in the 
second-hand and artisan shops. Then visit the Centre Céramique (
centreceramique.nl <http://www.centreceramique.nl/>) a cultural space with a 
creative programme of exhibitions and theatre, or the Lumière Cinema (lumiere.nl
 <http://www.lumiere.nl/en>), which shows arthouse films.

Where to stay
Boutique Hotel Grote Gracht opened last year in a quiet street off Vrijthof 
square. The style is low-key elegance with French antiques. Doubles from £65 (
boutiquehotelsintjacob.nl <http://boutiquehotelsintjacob.nl/en/facilities>).

Where to eat
The restaurant at the Marres contemporary arts centre serves a menu of 
Mediterranean and Asian-inspired dishes. In the summer you can eat outside or 
stroll in the lovely gardens (marres.org/en/kitchen 
<http://marres.org/en/kitchen>).

Insider tip
Raoul Spronken, who offers running and sightseeing tours (maastrichtrunning 
tours.nl <http://maastrichtrunningtours.nl/>), recommends hiring a bike at the 
station and cycling along the river to Restaurant Sofa (sofamaastricht.nl 
<http://www.sofamaastricht.nl/>). “It’s a great place for lunch and the route 
takes you past the Bonnefantenmuseum into the modern Céramique quarter.”
