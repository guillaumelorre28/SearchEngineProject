For gamers, it was like discovering the Ark of the Covenant – but made of 
plastic and less likely to contain the power of God. In early July, one Dan 
Diebold posted a YouTube video showing an apparently functional prototype of 
the SNES CD, an aborted update of the famed Super Nintendo Entertainment System 
built in partnership betweenNintendo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo> and Sony.

Developed in the late 1980s, the machine was intended to run games on both 
cartridges and CD-rom discs, but then Nintendo and Sony fell out and things 
went wrong. Sony proudly showed off its console – now called the Play Station – 
at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show, but Nintendo switched its allegiance to 
Philips a day later. Enraged,Sony <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sony> 
decided to release a new PlayStation console on its own, and many of the 
SNES-CD prototype units were destroyed. Which is why this new footage has 
caused much excitement in the gaming community.

However, the SNES CD is far from the only obscure games machine that either 
died at the prototype stage or collapsed shortly after release. Here are six 
more to look out for at your next car boot sale.

Apple Pippin (1995)

 The Apple Pippin was based on the Macintosh computer platform, but struggled 
to find an audience amid many similar – and superior – products. 
Say what you like about Apple, the company is famed for its impeccable 
industrial design and market sense – which makes the Pippin one of its most 
inexplicable mis-steps. Intended as a multimedia machine with gaming and 
internet browsing functions, Apple licensed the platform out to other 
manufacturers, including Bandai and Katz Media, which produced units from 1995. 
Unfortunately, it was expensive, poorly marketed and less powerful than 
competitors like the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation. It was also called the 
Pippin, the least cool console title ever (though Bandai did try to beat that 
four years later with its Japan-only handheld, the WonderSwan).
Value today: You’re looking at around £150 for a basic Bandai model, but 
prices can go up to £400 for limited-edition versions.

Matsushita M2 (1997)

 Matsushita M2 demo 
Originally designed as a followup to the innovative but expensive 3DO console, 
the M2 technology was instead sold to Japanese electronics company Matsushita 
in 1995 for a reported $100m. A powerful 64-bit machine was promised, complete 
with a graphics engine that could push one million polygons per second – 
unprecedented at the time. But by 1997, the manufacturer was having second 
thoughts about the games market and pulled out of production, leaving only a 
handful of prototypes.
Value today: They rarely materialise, though an offshoot of the tech, the 
Panasonic M2 FZ 35S, did make it to market and has turned up on eBay for 
between $1,000 (£644) and $3,000 (£1,933).

Nintendo Virtual Boy (1995)
 The Virtual Boy was intended as an entry into the world of virtual reality, 
but it turned out no one wanted to play Mario Tennis in red and black graphics 
until they were sick. Photograph: Evan Amos/public domain 
This legendary table-top virtual reality system was designed by GameBoy 
creator Gunpei Yokoi and used oscillating mirrors to create a monochromatic 
3D-style display. Nintendo promised that the 32-bit device would immerse 
players “into their own private universe” – it just happened to be a private 
universe of really bad headaches. The weird red LED visuals were far from the 
vision of virtual reality that consumers had been sold by the movies of the 
era, and the expensive toy vanished without a trace within a year, taking a 
vast catalogue of, erm, about 20 games with it.
Value today: This one’s easier to get hold of as it was actually released to 
the public, though you’ll pay between £180 and £400 for a boxed unit in good 
condition.

RDI Halcyon (1985)

 RDI Halcyon 
Marketed as a kind of advanced living room entertainment computer, the Halycon 
was like a cross between a PlayStation and Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey, 
capable of talking to owners and receiving voice commands. Developed by RDI 
Systems, the company behind 1983 arcade classic Dragon’s Lair, the machine ran 
games on laser discs and had an initial retail price of $1,800 ($2,100 if you 
wanted the voice control capability). Production was meant to begin in 1985, 
but strangely, the company had difficulty drumming up consumer interest for a 
games console that cost more than a car. It was never released and the handful 
of custom-built prototypes are with the product’s original investors and a few 
lucky private collectors.
Value now: Erm, substantially more than $2,100?

Sega Mega Jet (1994)

 Sega Mega Jet 
Between 1990 and 1999, Sega was a veritable production line of abortive 
hardware ideas, with the likes of the Neptune (combined Mega Drive and 32X) and 
the Jupiter (a Saturn with a cartridge port) failing to make it beyond the 
planning stages. The Sega Mega Jet was different though, a handheld version of 
the Mega Drive originally only sold to Japanese airlines, where it was used for 
inflight entertainment. It wasn’t strictly a portable console as it needed an 
external screen and power source, but that didn’t stop Sega giving it a limited 
consumer sales run in Japan, before employing the tech in its more widely 
available Sega Nomad handheld.
Value now: Well, there’s one on eBay right now 
<http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/MEGA-DRIVE-JET-PLUS-1-SEGA-Console-System-ALPINE-HMJ-0300-SONIC-3-0656/301553544290?_trksid=p2047675.c100011.m1850&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D32332%26meid%3Dee77264a8de248d68edb15cba0024b3e%26pid%3D100011%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26sd%3D151409093314>
 for $750 (£484), complete with a copy of Sonic 3.

VM Labs Nuon (1999)
 The Nuon was supposed to revolutionise the home entertainment market by 
combining a DVD player with a games console – but then came PlayStation 2 … 
Originally known as Project X, the Nuon was a powerful, 128-bit chipset 
complete with a state-of-the-art audio/video decoder. The idea was to market 
the tech to DVD manufacturers, allowing them to turn their players into games 
consoles. Co-founded by Richard Miller, who helped design one of the world’s 
first laptops (the Z88 from Cambridge Computers) and later the Atari Jaguar, VM 
Labs thought it could disrupt the entire consumer electronics industry, and 
managed to convince a few companies, as well as garnering plenty ofpress 
excitement 
<http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/6.07/projectx.html?pg=2&topic=>. 
However, by the time the tech was available in 1999, Sony was preparing its 
PlayStation 2 console – complete with a DVD player. That pretty much killed it. 
Just under 20 games were produced for the Nuon, including Jeff Minter’s 
excellentTempest 3000 <https://youtu.be/YyaeUNAAaXc>.
Value now: Several Nuon-equipped DVD machines were released in or shortly 
after 1999, including the Samsung DVD-N range. They’ve come up on eBay for 
around £400 boxed.
