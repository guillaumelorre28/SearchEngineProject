Holidaymakers who got stuck in monster traffic on their way to Dover and the 
Eurotunnel last weekend can attest to the fact that we are now in peak holiday 
season. According to the ONS, Brits made 65.7m foreign trips last year, while 
there were 36m visits to UK from overseas in the same period.

There was one very big winner when it comes to attracting UK tourists: one in 
five overseas visits by British residents last year were to Spain, almost 13m 
trips in all. The reverse isnâ€™t quite as popular: Spanish residents made an 
estimated 2.2m trips to the UK in the same period.

In terms of the total number of visits, Spanish people were the fifth most 
frequent visitors to the UK last year. France topped that list with 4.2m trips, 
followed by Americans (3.3m visits), Germans (3.2m) and Irish people (2.6m). 
All four countries also feature in the top-10 destinations for UK residents.

British people made almost 6.5m trips to Portugal, Greece and Turkey 
collectively last year. But that level of tourism was not reciprocated, with 
just over 800,000 trips made in the other direction.

The ONS bases its travel and tourism estimates on responses from visitors 
arriving to and leaving the UK who take part in the International Passenger 
Survey.
