Spurs were dreadful at the back in the first half and not much cop going 
forwards either. But a young side was always going to be nervy. Lamela was 
streets ahead of anyone when he came on in the second half and Winks and 
Harrison looked the most impressive of their young players. Wanyama was solid 
for 90 minutes too. As for Juve, Dybala and Pjanic looked sharp and dangerous. 
But let’s remember, it was just a warmup. Thanks for your emails. Bye.

Full-time: Juventus 2-1 Spurs

Winks gets his toes twinkling again, dinking in a cute pass that Lamela was 
close to getting on the end of. But peep! That’s that.

90+1 min: Lamela takes a pass under pressure midway inside the Juve half. He 
shows razor--sharp feet to evade his marker and slip in Harrison. The youngster 
connects well with his shot but Neto palms it wide at his near post. Corner. 
The corner is cleared. This is almost exciting.

88 min: Yedlin drops his shoulder and whips in a ball towards Lamela, who 
connects with the cross but watches his attempted shot slam into a defender and 
spin clear. That was sharp by Yedlin.

86 min: Lamela drops deep to pick the ball up off the back four. He runs 
forwards and tries to spark a move but the Juve defence snuff out the danger. 
Coccolo struggles to clear, though, and Spurs come back at Juve.

84 min: Spurs are on top and pushing for an equaliser. Edwards, the 
17-year-old who has slipped into the No10 role, looks really lively. He is 
looking to take the ball and turn at every opportunity and is finding space 
where previously there appeared to be none.

80 min: Juve have just made about 25 changes. I think Macek, Rossetti and 
Blanco Moreno came on for Lemina, Hernanes and AN Other but to be honest I 
don’t know. There may have been more. For Spurs I do know that Amos is on for 
Ball, who won’t look back on that first half fondly at all.

sidefoot it when he really should have laced it.

75 min: Omonah just can’t dampen a drilled diagonal ball into him from the 
left, watching it bounce off his toe and away to Neto. He looks lively, though. 
Always alert and looking to play off the shoulder.

73 min: Lemina drills a long ball out to Vitale on the left wing. He nips 
inside and dinks the ball off to his right to Rugani. He somehow bundles his 
way through two Spurs defenders before connecting with a shot that deflects 
wide for a corner.

70 min: What was clear from watching that Spurs goal is just how good and how 
quick both your feet and mind have to be to receive a ball where Hernanes did, 
midway inside his own half, with his back to goal, and escape without conceding 
possession as Hernanes did when put under pressure. It makes you realise just 
how good some of the best holding midfield players are: Alonso, Busquets et al.

Goal! Juventus 2-1 Spurs (Lamela 67)

Spurs treat Juve to a taste of their own medicine. Wanyama nips in and nicks 
possession off Hernanes, I think, and squirts the ball through to Lamela, who 
finishes sharply from 18 yards, across Neto, and into the far corner.

63 min: Substitution time! Trippier, Carroll and Janssen are off. Harrison, 
Walkes and Edwards are on. I think Edwards is about 12. Meanwhile, Spurs almost 
conceded a goal after faffing around with it at the back again only for Vorm to 
be alert to the danger and hoik it clear.

60 min: I’d go as far as to say that Spurs now look comfortable. Lamela is 
getting on the ball at every opportunity and is showing for the defenders all 
the time. Basically, he just wants possession. Always a handy attribute that.

58 min: Spurs are playing much better going forwards this half. Credit is due 
to Winks for that. He’s making himself a pesky presence in there, pressing with 
intent and ruffling a few feathers. Maybe he is worthy of personalised boots 
after all.

55 min: Lamela has the first half-decent shot of the match for Spurs. It 
followed some neat hold-up play from Janssen, who worked the ball back to 
Lamela to strike a fizzing low shot a foot to the left of the Neto’s far post 
from 20 yards.

from 12 yards out after being sent scuttling clear by a delicious curled ball 
from Hernanes that splits the Spurs defence in two. Brilliant vision.

49 min: Well those personalised Harry Winks boots have just delivered a lovely 
dinked pass over the top of the Juve defence to within a yard of Onomah, who 
just couldn’t get a foot to it as Neto raced out to collect on the edge of the 
area. What a delightful feather-toed pass from the Spurs youngster that was.

48 min: Spurs have begun reasonably enough. Well, they haven’t conceded and 
nor have they given the ball away under the merest hint of pressure at the back.

James Hallett’s glass is half-empty: “Not many positives to take from that 
first half for Spurs. Wanyama looked strong and Janssen showed some good 
movement, but the delivery to him has mostly been poor. The wildly 
inexperienced central defence highlights the need for defensive reinforcements 
- with Vertonghen injured the only remaining fit centre backs are Wimmer and 
Alderweireld. An injury to one of those two and Dier will be drafted into 
defence, which isn’t so bad with Wanyama now on the books but I would be much 
happier if Spurs signed another central defender rather than the next option 
being one of these youngsters - there was some talk of Ragnar Sigurðsson after 
the Euros but other than that I don’t think there has been so much as a 
whisper.”

Raymond Reardon has run the stats on expectant father Harry Kane so that I 
don’t have to: “Hi Gregg, in regard to your earlier posting that Harry Kane and 
his partner are expecting in January 2017 it should not affect Harry’s scoring 
too much....in the 2014/2015 season he scored 15 of his 21 Premier League Goals 
between November-February and in the 2015/2016 season, just completed, he 
scored 12 of his 25 Premier League Goals between November - February. In both 
of those seasons he scored an own goal before he got on the Premier League 
Golden Boot tally. With that now out of the way we will have to wait to see if 
he can score in the warmer months leading up to November, providing he has 
recovered from the summer Euros.” I’d like to think his performances against me 
last season were the real reason for his surge in goals in 2015-16.

cross just a moment ago. He took a wild air-shot and lost all sense of where he 
was, watching the ball fall behind him only to be gathered by Neto before 
Janssen could pounce.

36 min: Spurs try to play out from the back on the right and get into all 
sorts of bother as Juve nick possession. Dybala is sent racing through the 
middle of the pitch and plays a neat one-two with Pjanic before Spurs get 
enough bodies back to force him to play a backwards pass. Juve build again. I 
like the way Dybala wears his socks low. Wearing your socks low gives the 
impression of a hard-working player even if you’re not. Although Dybala 
definitely is.

33 min: Miller has got forwards gamely enough so far. He bursts into the box 
and then tumbles over as Benatia leans into him. He wants a penalty but the 
referee waves his appeal away. There was contact but hardly enough to warrant a 
spot-kick in my opinion. A moment before that, a free-kick was given against 
Dybala who almost gave Carroll an impromptu facelift with a high boot.

29 min: Carroll puts a decent cross in from the left but Juve clear for a 
corner. Carroll’s corner is knocked in deep to the man-mountain Wanyama at the 
back of the penalty area, he loops a header up and back into the throng of 
players in the box, from where Son has a pop at goal. It’s a poor pop. It’s a 
poor game.

26 min: Spurs are finally enjoying a bit of possession. They’re not going 
anywhere with it but still, it’s progress. I don’t think Spurs have had a touch 
in Juve’s penalty area yet. Anyway, here’s something: Spurs’ William Miller in 
action as Oliver Twist in the 2007 miniseries that also starred Tom Hardy.

23 min: Wanyama drops deep and collects the ball off the back four before 
spraying a pass out wide to Miller. He controls and has a gallop forwards 
before checking back and trying to play in Chadli, but the move breaks down.

short, and just aren’t making the silly mistakes that Pocchetino’s side have 
made so far.

the back at every opportunity but the young players at the back aren’t 
confident enough to do that effectively.

17 min: Another short back pass from Spurs almost leads to Dybala rounding 
Vorm and scoring, but the keeper doesjust enough to put the Juve striker off. 
But my, my, this Spurs defending is atrocious.

Goal! Juventus 2-0 Spurs (Benatia 15)

Spurs make a right royal mess of clearing the corner, the ball drifts out wide 
and is lofted back in towards the Juve defender, signed from Bayern this 
summer, who rises highest and sends the ball back towards the near post across 
Vorm. Simple. But this defending from Spurs. They’re pretty much leaving the 
door open forJuventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> whenever 
they get near the Spurs penalty area.
 Medhi Benatia heads home to put Juventus 2-0 up against Tottenham.

10 min: Juve have sensed that the way forwards in this game is to put an 
intense press on the young, nervy Spurs back line. Miller is forced to clear 
forwards under pressure from Pereyra and Juve win back possession. The Italian 
champions are in total control.

9 min: Spurs had an incredibly high line when they conceded there. Both sides 
have looked rusty so far, mind. Only when Juve got a sniff of a goal did they 
make every pass count. Prior to that they’d looked wasteful in possession.

Goal! Juventus 1-0 Spurs (Dybala 6)

Oh dear! Dominic Ball fails to control a simple pass back to him midway inside 
the Spurs half. Pereyra nips in and nicks possession before racing away towards 
goal, drawing a poor attempt at a tackle from Carter-Vickers, and playing in 
Dybala, who wallops the ball home from 10 yards with his left foot.
 Paulo Dybala scores to give Juventus a 1-0 lead against Tottenham Hotspur.

3 min: Neto makes hash of playing a simple pass out from the back and sends 
the ball whistling out of play for a Spurs throw-in. To be fair, anyone would 
be a nervous wreck having to cover for Buffon. Even in a pre-season warmup.

of the Dutchman and clear the danger.

Right, it’s almost time for kick-off at the MCG. It’s pretty sparsely 
populated but it is a hell of a big stadium to fill. Spurs are wearing a gold 
kit with pinstripes tonight. Juve in their iconic black and white  changed 
strip of blue because there’s money to be made on tour you know.

Spurs fans, what are you expecting this season? Is it going to be better or 
worse than last time out? And Juve fans, is £79m for Higuáin not a sure sign of 
madness?

Harry Kane isn’t with the Spurs squad. In fact, none of England’s Euro 2016 
heroes have travelled with Spurs to Australia. They’ve been left at home. 
Kane’s announced some good news in the last 24 hours.
Harry Kane (@HKane) 
So happy that @KateGoodlandx <https://twitter.com/KateGoodlandx> and I are 
expecting our first child! Exciting times ahead! Can't wait! 👶🏼🍼❤️

It’s also good news for Premier League defenders. Kane will be knackered in 
January.

Sean Kilgannon has this on the weather in Australia. “Cold in Melbourne? Try 
Boxing Day, 1998, the Ashes Test at the MCG, Aussie summer … drizzle started 
about 10.25, no play all day, freezing Antarctic wind. Don’t believe 
Neighbours!” Is Neighbours still going? If so, how many times has Harold Bishop

Team news!

Juventus team: Neto; Lirola, Benatia, Rugani, Alex Sandro; Lemina, Hernanes, 
Asamoah; Pjanic, Pereyra; Dybala.Subs: Audero, Del Favero, Loria, Marrone, 
Blanco Moreno, Parodi, Severin, Coccolo, Macek, Kastanos, Vitale, Rosseti, 
Cerri, Padovan

Spurs team: Vorm; Trippier, Ball, Carter-Vickers, Miller; Mason (C), Wanyama; 
Son, Carroll, Chadli; Janssen.Subs: McGee (GK), Glover (GK), Walker-Peters, 
Yedlin, Amos, Edwards, Lamela, Onomah, Walkes, Winks, Harrison.

So both managers start with their new signings. Pjanic in midfield for Juve, 
where he’ll have the huge presence of Wanyama to contend with in the centre of 
the park. While up front for Spurs, Janssen is given the chance to lead the 
line as a lone striker in the absence of Kane. He’s not facing the usual Juve 
wall of Buffon, Chiellini, Barzagli and Bonucci, mind. So some relief for 
Janssen if he had the butterflies.

Preamble

Hello. Where better than the Melbourne Cricket Ground for a pre-season warmup 
match between the champions of Italy andTottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur>? Ah, OK. Well, anyway. 
Mauricio Pochettino has kept his squad together this summer and added the steel 
of Victor Wanyama to his midfield for £11m as well as the aggressive young 
attacking talent of Vincent Janssen, who came to the club from AZ Alkmaar for 
£17m (which would have been about £1.50 a year ago, such is the inflated 
transfer market). Both players are with the squad in Australia so we may see 
them in action. As for Juventus, well, they’re still in a state of flux. 
Gonzalo Higuáin is on the verge of a £79m move to the club from Napoli (yes, 
£79m – oh football!) and Paul Pogba is almost certain to leave for a figure so 
high it is probably beyond most people’s comprehension. Miralem Pjanic, who 
came in for £26m from Roma, will likely get a run out. Much will be expected 
from him this season when Pogba is safely despatched to Manchester/Madrid.

I’m not sure how much Pochettino will be enjoying dragging his players around 
the world before the season starts. He’s famed for taking extra care to get his 
players fitter than his rivals, with regular double sessions. I’ve heard it’s 
difficult to do squat thrusts on a commercial flight – even in business class. 
It might be that Chelsea’s Antonio Conte steals a march on the Spurs boss in 
the fitness stakes this season. Just look at this:

Spurs were dreadful at the back in the first half and not much cop going 
forwards either. But a young side was always going to be nervy. Lamela was 
streets ahead of anyone when he came on in the second half and Winks and 
Harrison looked the most impressive of their young players. Wanyama was solid 
for 90 minutes too. As for Juve, Dybala and Pjanic looked sharp and dangerous. 
But let’s remember, it was just a warmup. Thanks for your emails. Bye.
 
Winks gets his toes twinkling again, dinking in a cute pass that Lamela was 
close to getting on the end of. But peep! That’s that.
 
90+1 min: Lamela takes a pass under pressure midway inside the Juve half. He 
shows razor--sharp feet to evade his marker and slip in Harrison. The youngster 
connects well with his shot but Neto palms it wide at his near post. Corner. 
The corner is cleared. This is almost exciting.
 
90 min: Great new if you like pre-season matches. There’ll be two more minutes 
of this.
 
88 min: Yedlin drops his shoulder and whips in a ball towards Lamela, who 
connects with the cross but watches his attempted shot slam into a defender and 
spin clear. That was sharp by Yedlin.
 
87 min: Lirola, who snuck on when I wasn’t looking, pulls Wanyama’s shirt as 
the big man steams through the middle of the pitch and is booked for his 
trouble. I like Lirola’s style. He’s not taking this lightly.
 
86 min: Lamela drops deep to pick the ball up off the back four. He runs 
forwards and tries to spark a move but the Juve defence snuff out the danger. 
Coccolo struggles to clear, though, and Spurs come back at Juve.
 
84 min: Spurs are on top and pushing for an equaliser. Edwards, the 
17-year-old who has slipped into the No10 role, looks really lively. He is 
looking to take the ball and turn at every opportunity and is finding space 
where previously there appeared to be none.
 
80 min: Juve have just made about 25 changes. I think Macek, Rossetti and 
Blanco Moreno came on for Lemina, Hernanes and AN Other but to be honest I 
don’t know. There may have been more. For Spurs I do know that Amos is on for 
Ball, who won’t look back on that first half fondly at all.
 
76 min: Lamela stings the palms of Neto from 18 yards out. He chooses to 
sidefoot it when he really should have laced it.
 
75 min: Omonah just can’t dampen a drilled diagonal ball into him from the 
left, watching it bounce off his toe and away to Neto. He looks lively, though. 
Always alert and looking to play off the shoulder.
 
73 min: Lemina drills a long ball out to Vitale on the left wing. He nips 
inside and dinks the ball off to his right to Rugani. He somehow bundles his 
way through two Spurs defenders before connecting with a shot that deflects 
wide for a corner.
 
70 min: What was clear from watching that Spurs goal is just how good and how 
quick both your feet and mind have to be to receive a ball where Hernanes did, 
midway inside his own half, with his back to goal, and escape without conceding 
possession as Hernanes did when put under pressure. It makes you realise just 
how good some of the best holding midfield players are: Alonso, Busquets et al.
 
68 min: A moment before that Spurs goal Pjanic was replaced by Parodi and 
Asamoah was taken off for Vitale, who is not wearing a full-face mast tonight, 
as he did in the training session yesterday evening.
 
Spurs treat Juve to a taste of their own medicine. Wanyama nips in and nicks 
possession off Hernanes, I think, and squirts the ball through to Lamela, who 
finishes sharply from 18 yards, across Neto, and into the far corner.

Juventus. Photograph: Scott Barbour/Getty Images  
63 min: Substitution time! Trippier, Carroll and Janssen are off. Harrison, 
Walkes and Edwards are on. I think Edwards is about 12. Meanwhile, Spurs almost 
conceded a goal after faffing around with it at the back again only for Vorm to 
be alert to the danger and hoik it clear.
 
60 min: I’d go as far as to say that Spurs now look comfortable. Lamela is 
getting on the ball at every opportunity and is showing for the defenders all 
the time. Basically, he just wants possession. Always a handy attribute that.
 
59 min: Lamela is wearing gloves in a pre-season friendly in Melbourne. I know 
it’s winter there, but come on, it’s hardly Sunderland.
 
58 min: Spurs are playing much better going forwards this half. Credit is due 
to Winks for that. He’s making himself a pesky presence in there, pressing with 
intent and ruffling a few feathers. Maybe he is worthy of personalised boots 
after all.
 
55 min: Lamela has the first half-decent shot of the match for Spurs. It 
followed some neat hold-up play from Janssen, who worked the ball back to 
Lamela to strike a fizzing low shot a foot to the left of the Neto’s far post 
from 20 yards.
 
52 min: What a pass this is! Pjanic slices over horribly with his left foot 
from 12 yards out after being sent scuttling clear by a delicious curled ball 
from Hernanes that splits the Spurs defence in two. Brilliant vision.

49 min: Well those personalised Harry Winks boots have just delivered a lovely 
dinked pass over the top of the Juve defence to within a yard of Onomah, who 
just couldn’t get a foot to it as Neto raced out to collect on the edge of the 
area. What a delightful feather-toed pass from the Spurs youngster that was.
 
48 min: Spurs have begun reasonably enough. Well, they haven’t conceded and 
nor have they given the ball away under the merest hint of pressure at the back.
 
45 min: It’s the second half – and only the six changes to report. Erik 
Lamela, DeAndre Yedlin, Harry Winks and Joshua Onomah have replaced Son, Mason, 
Chadli and Oliver Twist Miller. As for Juventus, Cerri is on for Pereyra and 
Benatia is replaced by Marrone.
 
James Hallett’s glass is half-empty: “Not many positives to take from that 
first half for Spurs. Wanyama looked strong and Janssen showed some good 
movement, but the delivery to him has mostly been poor. The wildly 
inexperienced central defence highlights the need for defensive reinforcements 
- with Vertonghen injured the only remaining fit centre backs are Wimmer and 
Alderweireld. An injury to one of those two and Dier will be drafted into 
defence, which isn’t so bad with Wanyama now on the books but I would be much 
happier if Spurs signed another central defender rather than the next option 
being one of these youngsters - there was some talk of Ragnar Sigurðsson after 
the Euros but other than that I don’t think there has been so much as a 
whisper.”
 
Raymond Reardon has run the stats on expectant father Harry Kane so that I 
don’t have to: “Hi Gregg, in regard to your earlier posting that Harry Kane and 
his partner are expecting in January 2017 it should not affect Harry’s scoring 
too much....in the 2014/2015 season he scored 15 of his 21 Premier League Goals 
between November-February and in the 2015/2016 season, just completed, he 
scored 12 of his 25 Premier League Goals between November - February. In both 
of those seasons he scored an own goal before he got on the Premier League 
Golden Boot tally. With that now out of the way we will have to wait to see if 
he can score in the warmer months leading up to November, providing he has 
recovered from the summer Euros.” I’d like to think his performances against me 
last season were the real reason for his surge in goals in 2015-16.

Spurs displayed a toxic mix of inexperience and rust in the first 20 minutes. 
Juventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> capitalised on it. 
Here’s some half-time reading:

45 min: “I know it’s only pre-season but I still think that David Crowther 
should get a straight red for that Pjanic crack,” peeps Mike Mackenzie. Its 
quality is in keeping with that on show at the MCG Mike.
 
43 min: Dybala cuts out another move on the Spurs right but his pass inside to 
Lemina is wayward. Yup, not much happening here. Poor Janssen’s heat map will 
be colder than the North Pole.
 
41 min: On the subject of panic, Hernanes made a hash of clearing a Carroll 
cross just a moment ago. He took a wild air-shot and lost all sense of where he 
was, watching the ball fall behind him only to be gathered by Neto before 
Janssen could pounce.
 
39 min: “Disappointed that Miralem Pjanic chose Juventus over Spurs, as was 
mooted at one point. If that had gone through, we could’ve had Pjanic on the 
streets on London. I thank you,” writes David Crowther.We already have Yannick 
on the streets of London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2015/dec/08/yannick-bolasie-the-gallery>
 anyway.
 
36 min: Spurs try to play out from the back on the right and get into all 
sorts of bother as Juve nick possession. Dybala is sent racing through the 
middle of the pitch and plays a neat one-two with Pjanic before Spurs get 
enough bodies back to force him to play a backwards pass. Juve build again. I 
like the way Dybala wears his socks low. Wearing your socks low gives the 
impression of a hard-working player even if you’re not. Although Dybala 
definitely is.
 
33 min: Miller has got forwards gamely enough so far. He bursts into the box 
and then tumbles over as Benatia leans into him. He wants a penalty but the 
referee waves his appeal away. There was contact but hardly enough to warrant a 
spot-kick in my opinion. A moment before that, a free-kick was given against 
Dybala who almost gave Carroll an impromptu facelift with a high boot.
 
31 min: The few shouts ringing around the MCG make this sound eerily like a 
game of cricket is being played in Melbourne, not a football match.

<https://twitter.com/GreenNGoldMatt/status/757885003799728128>  
29 min: Carroll puts a decent cross in from the left but Juve clear for a 
corner. Carroll’s corner is knocked in deep to the man-mountain Wanyama at the 
back of the penalty area, he loops a header up and back into the throng of 
players in the box, from where Son has a pop at goal. It’s a poor pop. It’s a 
poor game.
 
26 min: Spurs are finally enjoying a bit of possession. They’re not going 
anywhere with it but still, it’s progress. I don’t think Spurs have had a touch 
in Juve’s penalty area yet. Anyway, here’s something: Spurs’ William Miller in 
action as Oliver Twist in the 2007 miniseries that also starred Tom Hardy.
 
23 min: Wanyama drops deep and collects the ball off the back four before 
spraying a pass out wide to Miller. He controls and has a gallop forwards 
before checking back and trying to play in Chadli, but the move breaks down.
 
21 min: Juve look miles ahead here. They’re mixing up their play, long and 
short, and just aren’t making the silly mistakes that Pocchetino’s side have 
made so far.
 
19 min: The problem that Spurs have is that they’re trying to play out from 
the back at every opportunity but the young players at the back aren’t 
confident enough to do that effectively.
 
17 min: Another short back pass from Spurs almost leads to Dybala rounding 
Vorm and scoring, but the keeper doesjust enough to put the Juve striker off. 
But my, my, this Spurs defending is atrocious.
 
Spurs make a right royal mess of clearing the corner, the ball drifts out wide 
and is lofted back in towards the Juve defender, signed from Bayern this 
summer, who rises highest and sends the ball back towards the near post across 
Vorm. Simple. But this defending from Spurs. They’re pretty much leaving the 
door open forJuventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> whenever 
they get near the Spurs penalty area.

13 min: Carter-Vickers and Ball are caught out of position once more, allowing 
Dybala to nip in behind them and hit a snap-shot that Vorm palms away for a 
corner.
 
10 min: Juve have sensed that the way forwards in this game is to put an 
intense press on the young, nervy Spurs back line. Miller is forced to clear 
forwards under pressure from Pereyra and Juve win back possession. The Italian 
champions are in total control.
 
9 min: Spurs had an incredibly high line when they conceded there. Both sides 
have looked rusty so far, mind. Only when Juve got a sniff of a goal did they 
make every pass count. Prior to that they’d looked wasteful in possession.
 
Oh dear! Dominic Ball fails to control a simple pass back to him midway inside 
the Spurs half. Pereyra nips in and nicks possession before racing away towards 
goal, drawing a poor attempt at a tackle from Carter-Vickers, and playing in 
Dybala, who wallops the ball home from 10 yards with his left foot.
 Paulo Dybala scores to give Juventus a 1-0 lead against Tottenham Hotspur.

3 min: Neto makes hash of playing a simple pass out from the back and sends 
the ball whistling out of play for a Spurs throw-in. To be fair, anyone would 
be a nervous wreck having to cover for Buffon. Even in a pre-season warmup.
 
1 min: Spurs get us under way. Janssen is sent racing through the middle early 
on but Benatia shows a good set of heels – and strength too - to get in front 
of the Dutchman and clear the danger.
 
Right, it’s almost time for kick-off at the MCG. It’s pretty sparsely 
populated but it is a hell of a big stadium to fill. Spurs are wearing a gold 
kit with pinstripes tonight. Juve in their iconic black and white  changed 
strip of blue because there’s money to be made on tour you know.
 
Spurs fans, what are you expecting this season? Is it going to be better or 
worse than last time out? And Juve fans, is £79m for Higuáin not a sure sign of 
madness?
 
Harry Kane isn’t with the Spurs squad. In fact, none of England’s Euro 2016 
heroes have travelled with Spurs to Australia. They’ve been left at home. 
Kane’s announced some good news in the last 24 hours.

It’s also good news for Premier League defenders. Kane will be knackered in 
January.
 
Personally I think young players should have to have made 50 appearances 
before getting personalised boots.

Sean Kilgannon has this on the weather in Australia. “Cold in Melbourne? Try 
Boxing Day, 1998, the Ashes Test at the MCG, Aussie summer … drizzle started 
about 10.25, no play all day, freezing Antarctic wind. Don’t believe 
Neighbours!” Is Neighbours still going? If so, how many times has Harold Bishop 
returned from the dead?
 
Juventus team: Neto; Lirola, Benatia, Rugani, Alex Sandro; Lemina, Hernanes, 
Asamoah; Pjanic, Pereyra; Dybala.Subs: Audero, Del Favero, Loria, Marrone, 
Blanco Moreno, Parodi, Severin, Coccolo, Macek, Kastanos, Vitale, Rosseti, 
Cerri, Padovan

Spurs team: Vorm; Trippier, Ball, Carter-Vickers, Miller; Mason (C), Wanyama; 
Son, Carroll, Chadli; Janssen.Subs: McGee (GK), Glover (GK), Walker-Peters, 
Yedlin, Amos, Edwards, Lamela, Onomah, Walkes, Winks, Harrison.

So both managers start with their new signings. Pjanic in midfield for Juve, 
where he’ll have the huge presence of Wanyama to contend with in the centre of 
the park. While up front for Spurs, Janssen is given the chance to lead the 
line as a lone striker in the absence of Kane. He’s not facing the usual Juve 
wall of Buffon, Chiellini, Barzagli and Bonucci, mind. So some relief for 
Janssen if he had the butterflies.
 
Hello. Where better than the Melbourne Cricket Ground for a pre-season warmup 
match between the champions of Italy andTottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur>? Ah, OK. Well, anyway.
