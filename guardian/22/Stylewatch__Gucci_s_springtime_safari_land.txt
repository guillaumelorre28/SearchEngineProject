Of course it makes sense that Alessandro Michele would have a wild-animal 
fetish: the Gucci demigod’s aesthetic persona is equal parts cowardly lion, 
Victorian dandy andKings of Leon <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kingsofleon>
 four albums ago.

The spring/summer campaign shot by Glen Luchford is no Kenzo-lite; instead, 
it’s a beautiful diorama of hipsters with added wild beasts. The moodboard here 
is very “Mowgli from The Jungle Book moved to Brooklyn and brought his furry 
friends with him”.

Stylewatch did a bit of a double-take, we have to admit, when we realised that 
the sleek tiger and giraffe prints existed on actual tigers and giraffes. The 
clothes are peak-Michele, with a soupçon of 80s about them: sweatshirts inMolly 
Ringwald <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/molly-ringwald> pink, T-shirts 
emblazoned with retro logos and Freddy Krueger-cut suit jackets. And if there 
is a sense of the familiar about it – Gucci, likeWestworld 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld>, is stuck in a narrative 
loop – we want to go there.
