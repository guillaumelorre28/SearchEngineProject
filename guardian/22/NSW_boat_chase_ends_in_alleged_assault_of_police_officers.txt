Two men will face court after police were allegedly assaulted following a boat 
chase in NSW’s Shoalhaven.

Police were called to a wharf at about 5:40pm on New Year’s Eve after a 
collision between the half-cabin boat and a small runabout on Saturday evening 
on Sussex Inlet.

When the boat skipper refused a police order to stop, officers commandeered 
two private vessels and chased the boat which eventually stopped off Kangaroo 
Point, St Georges Basin.

“The occupants of the vessel then had an altercation with police and allegedly 
assaulted officers and damaged their uniforms and a police radio,” police said 
in a statement.

After the crew of a police boat and a marine rescue vessel rendered assistance 
two men, aged 28 and 38, were arrested.

Police say the 28-year-old skipper returned a positive alcohol test and later 
returned a reading of 0.144 leading to a charge of operating a vessel with 
mid-range PCA.

The 38-year-old man was charged with seven offences including obstructing, 
resisting and assaulting police and offensive behaviour and is to appear at 
Nowra Local Court on 30 January.
