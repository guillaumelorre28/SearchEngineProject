At Mary Katrantzou, eyelashes looked like seascapes. Clumps and blobs of 
turquoise mascara – that looked like it had been applied fast, on a train, with 
a wand that had seen better days – made models into walking holiday photos. 
Blue skies, endless oceans, the sense there is peace to be found – if you dig 
deep enough into your make-up bag.
