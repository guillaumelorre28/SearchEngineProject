I was wandering around aimlessly – and high, like most tourists here – when I 
foundJazz <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> Café Alto. I heard a muted 
trumpet coming from inside a small dark bar and, to my surprise, the place was 
packed with locals. At the end of the narrow room, a swinging four-piece 
ensemble was playing an awesome jazz version of the Flintstones theme. I’m very 
picky about jazz bars but this place has never failed me. I’ve been six times 
and there’s always been a full house, and live music playing until 4am. Anyone 
with a passion for live improvisational music would enjoy it.

In 2011, I brought a group of friends here: the place was packed but there 
were incredible samba rhythms coming from the back of the room. The music is 
loud enough for dancing but never so loud that you can’t talk to the person 
next to you. We must have been there drinking cocktails and dancing for hours.

Amsterdam is a playground for adults, with something for everyone. But amid 
the commercial clubs, bars and coffee shops, this place stands out for its 
intimate, underground atmosphere and great live music.
