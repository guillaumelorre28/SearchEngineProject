What links Kanye West, Phoenix Nights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.film>’s bouncers 
Max and Paddy and next season’s menswear collection at Calvin Klein? It’s also 
been seen on 90s ravers, Steve McQueen and a host of Instagram-friendly 
off-duty models.

The answer is the MA-1 bomber jacket – and you can see the appeal. The bomber 
is a wardrobe staple that’s both practical and enough of a blank canvas for 
generations of style tribes to make their own: it works with trainers or heels, 
for hip-hop or catwalks. It’s a simple design that’s open to interpretation – 
solid colours (khaki, black, navy), the punch of the bright orange inner 
lining, and the satisfying detail of a pocket sewn on the left arm (with bonus 
points for the least nerdy pen holder ever).

 A nod to rave? Maharishi x XL Recordings MA-1 flight jacket 
From trenchcoats to parkas, pea coats to combat pants, there’s a long 
tradition of military wear being adopted by subcultures and fashion labels, and 
the bomber jacket is no exception. The originals were, of course, flight 
jackets – the MA-1 which was designed by the US airforce in the late 1950s as a 
solution for pilots to wear in bomber planes (hence the name). They were 
outsourced to Alpha Industries, which has continued to make them ever since, as 
well as collaborating with labels such as Opening Ceremony, Uniform Experiment 
and A Bathing Ape for interesting riffs in recent years.
