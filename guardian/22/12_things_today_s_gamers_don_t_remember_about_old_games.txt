Gamers tend to glorify the past, wistfully recalling when graphics were 
simple, but the challenge was tough. Get two gaming veterans together and it’s 
not long before they’re reminiscing about how good Final Fantasy used to be, 
and how Jet Set Willy was better than Sonic the Hedgehog.

Well I was there and let me tell you, it was weird. Here are 12 aspects of 
ancient gaming history that we tend to forget.


1. For years, we only had Pong

When the first games consoles appeared in the 1970s, they had black-and-white 
graphics. The box would often boast ‘comes with 10 games!’ – but it was 10 
different versions of Pong. Football? Pong with more bats. Squash? Pong with 
only one wall. Still, the electricity was off most of the time anyway, so we 
just played with the packaging.

2. You had to type in games yourself

Home computers would often come with a book entitled ‘fun games to program 
yourself’. When you finished typing gibberish, you got to play a game called 
Syntax Error where the aim was to cry until your dad located the one line where 
you used a comma instead of a semicolon. When he finished and hit ‘Run’, you 
played Pong.


3. This is what a joypad looked like in the early 1980s

That’s right, they had ONE* button! Until the Nintendo Entertainment System 
came along in the mid-eighties, you could forget about being able to jump, 
fire, strafe and open a conversation window at the same time. If you owned a 
Spectrum, you had to buy a separate interface to use a joystick – and they broke
all the time.
(*Okay, so the ColecoVision and Intellivision controllers had more buttons, 
but they looked like prototype mobile phones not joypads – and they were silly.)

4. Games came on cassettes

Cassettes! Those things your mum and dad used to record the Top 40 on. Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> took about five minutes to load, 
and even then they would probably crash at the last second. During the loading 
process they would make weird noises like R2D2 being tortured by the Clangers.

5. We had to stare at this for five minutes before playing anything

Some games showed pixel art and flashing coloured lines on the screen while 
loading. This was to fool you into thinking that something was definitely 
happening. It was often a lie.

6. Games came with gigantic instruction books

 ‘I’m sure the Lords of Midnight instruction booklet is here somewhere.’ 
Photograph: ClassicStock/Corbis 
In the 1980s, all games came with lengthy instruction manuals. Titles like 
Elite and Lords of Midnight even had short novels that players were asked to 
read before starting. If a modern game asked you to read a short novel before 
starting, it would be on the pre-owned shelf at Game quicker than you could say 
‘Britain’s literacy crisis’.


7. Games were brutally hard ...

 Fail again ... fail better? Donkey Kong. Photograph: video game screenshot 
A lot of the principles of action video game design came out of the immensely 
competitive coin-op industry of the late 70s and early 80s, when companies like 
Sega, Namco, Taito and Capcom were in the business of separating you from your 
10p as quickly as possible. Most people have no idea that Donkey Kong has three 
different levels after the first one.

 ‘I stayed up all night for this?!’ Photograph: video game screenshot 
Until hard drives and cartridges with battery-backed memory were widely 
available, very few games allowed you to save your progress. If you died, you 
went back to the beginning, and if you had to go on holiday before finishing
Super Mario Bros 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/sep/13/games-gameculture>
, you put the game on pause and hoped your house didn’t burn down while you 
were away.

9. The internet was just something nerds used to start nuclear wars

There were no online 32-player Battlefield sessions for us. Also, we didn’t 
have Reddit, we had bulletin board systems, which were very different because 
they were full of angry anonymous men being horrible to each other. That’s 
almost inconceivable now.

10. We had weird indie games back then too

If you yearn for a time before weird indie games turned up to “spoil” your 
fun, hard luck; they’ve been around since the beginning. In the 1984 title Deus 
Ex Machina, Dr Who actor Jon Pertwee narrated a story about a lifeform evolving 
from mouse poo, while the accompanying music tape played experimental synth pop.

11. There was no such thing as a YouTuber

In the olden days, if you wanted an over-enthusiastic youth to shout at you 
about video games for two hours, you had to go to Currys and ask a sales 
assistant to show you Manic Miner. Instead of YouTubers with crazy names like
PewDiePie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/22/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-this-book-loves-you>
 and StampyCat, we had games magazines with crazy names like Crash, Zzap and

There was no Xbox Live. If you wanted to meet and play against other gamers, 
you went to the arcade, a hive of scum and villainy where all the high scores 
tables were dominated by local heroes called TIT, BUM and NOB. You’d spend 
hours uselessly staring at a screen while pathetic bullying sociopaths mocked 
everything you did. We’ve got Twitter for that now.
