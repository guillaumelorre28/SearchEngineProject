C: Listen to Frankie Goes To Hollywood.

D: I just relax - put my feet up. Criminal Intent. Or I watch QI - I love it.

C: I watch a lot of TV: Game of Thrones, House of Cards, True Detective over 
and over again.

Thanks to everyone, and sorry if we missed people. Check out the show at 
Somerset House - it starts 5 November. And don't believe everything you read.

D: Keep your minds out of the gutter. And don't believe anything we've said 
today.

Chris: 'I try not to be too professional'

C: I try not to be too professional, except to turn up on time for things. 
"Professional" indicates a kind of stiffness.

D: The idea of satisfying yourself in whatever you write... if you write 
something you're proud of, that's a goal, that's always a goal. You think you 
are a better songwriter now than back in the day?

C: No, I can't tell.

D: What the hell Chris? You're a better musician, that's for sure.

C: I guess I have better technical skills now.

It sounds like various members of the band were quite into mysticism and the 
occult (a heady combination!) How did that feed into the music? Is Rapture all 
about the ‘varieties of ecstasy’ for example?

C: No, it's about the Second Coming.

D: You bastard!

C: We just had one of the many raptures, that was supposed to come. Snoop Dogg 
tweeted "Where'sBlondie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/blondie>?" We were 
trending that day. But I'm a huge fan of Austin Osman Spare - Google that. I 
have a bunch of his works, though Jimmy Page has the best collection of his 
stuff. He's a great British graphic artist, who died right after the war. He's 
compared to Durer, but he's a mystic.

C: It was great. Very memorable and weird. The phrase Zombie Birdhouse was 
completely improvised, just flew out of his mouth. At that point no-one was 
interested in him, so he went on my little dinky vanity label.

D: [drily] We're going to start a new label: New Music For Old Artists.

C: Billy Joel is our first signing.

Do you think that pop music is the domain of young people?

C: Yeah, but it always has been. The Beatles were 20 years old when they 
emerged, as was everybody.

D: Pop music has always been the domain of the young - they make the 
discoveries, and it then becomes multi-generational. Pop is part of the mating 
game.

C: You have to want to screw whoever is on stage. But when I was younger my 
heroes were all 60 years old - Miles Davis, Muddy Waters...

D: But you were weird. It's all a mishmash - there was once a time when it was 
pop, R&B, metal, and now everything is lumped together. There should be five 
votes for each genre in the Hall of Fame, there are so many that are excluded, 
it's so limited.

C: iTunes ruined it by having a myriad of genres: Swedish Latin House. It 
started getting out of hand.

to Chris Stein & Clem Burke

as the 2 remaining original instrumentalists in the band, and given your 
different styles, are you finding your styles gelling a la Keith and Charlie as 
you get older, or do you have to work on arrangements and songs to keep things 
tight?

C: I'm not going to say I wish Clem sounded like Charlie... I don't know how 
much the Stones' style has changed over the years. I was always a Stones freak.

D: No, it wasn't about drugs. I was about the idea of lives going along, 
separately but at the same pace, never really crossing - the idea of infinity. 
I went further with that with The Bride of Infinity. But Parallel Lines was 
about ships in the night, stuff like that. It was always our intention to be 
subliminal though, or double.

A bunch of us Durham Archaeology students were digging on Orkney - Summer 1979 
- and on Saturday nights we would party playing Parallel Lines followed by 
Outlandos d’Amour followed by Parallel Lines followed by Outlandos d’Amour 
followed by Parallel Lines. You get the picture - great times! Did you write 
the lyrics first, write the music first or just jam and follow your 
inspiration? What was the creative process to produce an album of such 
outstanding and catchy songs.

C: What I find nervewracking about Broadway, is that they write the lyric 
first and the music is woven around, whereas in pop, music comes first, or at 
its best, simultaneously. What were you digging up, is what I want to know...

D: Vikings, that kind of stuff?

C: I think there's as good stuff coming out now as there ever has been. People 
are a little resistant to the EDM thing, there are always purists in every 
form, every fanbase has crazy purists, but pop music today is just as exciting 
now. Songs I play over and over: Titanium by David Guetta and Sia, Chandelier 
by Sia I can't get the chorus out of my head even though I prefer the verse. 
Gotye, I listened to hundreds of times on repeat. Wake Me Up by Avicii is 
awesome. Teenage Dream by Katy Perry really stands up for me, I'm so happy to 
hear her not singing the melisma style that makes you sound like you're running 
while you're singing.

D: After you hear Avicii, you can just say 'fuck off' to the world. Fever Ray 
songs are amazing too. There are obviously strong hooks and melodies today. 
Great songwriters.

"Professional" indicates a kind of stiffness.

D: The idea of satisfying yourself in whatever you write... if you write 
something you're proud of, that's a goal, that's always a goal. You think you

tweeted "Where'sBlondie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/blondie>?" We were 
trending that day. But I'm a huge fan of Austin Osman Spare - Google that. I 
have a bunch of his works, though Jimmy Page has the best collection of his 
stuff. He's a great British graphic artist, who died right after the war. He's 
compared to Durer, but he's a mystic.

C: It was great. Very memorable and weird. The phrase Zombie Birdhouse was 
completely improvised, just flew out of his mouth. At that point no-one was 
interested in him, so he went on my little dinky vanity label.

D: [drily] We're going to start a new label: New Music For Old Artists.

C: Yeah, but it always has been. The Beatles were 20 years old when they 
emerged, as was everybody.

D: Pop music has always been the domain of the young - they make the 
discoveries, and it then becomes multi-generational. Pop is part of the mating 
game.

C: You have to want to screw whoever is on stage. But when I was younger my 
heroes were all 60 years old - Miles Davis, Muddy Waters...

D: But you were weird. It's all a mishmash - there was once a time when it was 
pop, R&B, metal, and now everything is lumped together. There should be five 
votes for each genre in the Hall of Fame, there are so many that are excluded, 
it's so limited.

C: iTunes ruined it by having a myriad of genres: Swedish Latin House. It 
started getting out of hand.

D: No, it wasn't about drugs. I was about the idea of lives going along, 
separately but at the same pace, never really crossing - the idea of infinity. 
I went further with that with The Bride of Infinity. But Parallel Lines was 
about ships in the night, stuff like that. It was always our intention to be 
subliminal though, or double.

Do you think pop music will ever get it’s edge back, or is it now too much of 
an ‘Industry’?

C: I think there's as good stuff coming out now as there ever has been. People 
are a little resistant to the EDM thing, there are always purists in every 
form, every fanbase has crazy purists, but pop music today is just as exciting 
now. Songs I play over and over: Titanium by David Guetta and Sia, Chandelier 
by Sia I can't get the chorus out of my head even though I prefer the verse. 
Gotye, I listened to hundreds of times on repeat. Wake Me Up by Avicii is 
awesome. Teenage Dream by Katy Perry really stands up for me, I'm so happy to 
hear her not singing the melisma style that makes you sound like you're running 
while you're singing.

D: After you hear Avicii, you can just say 'fuck off' to the world. Fever Ray 
songs are amazing too. There are obviously strong hooks and melodies today. 
Great songwriters.
