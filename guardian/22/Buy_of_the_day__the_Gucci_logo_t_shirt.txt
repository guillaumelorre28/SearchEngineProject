Gucci’s creative director Alessandro Michele is a man who is not afraid of a 
bit of postmodernism, as evidenced byGuccighost 
<http://guccighost.bigcartel.com/>. Among the exciting geek-chic items, Gucci’s 
cruise collection featured a shockingly simple, logo’d T-shirt. The font was 
capitalised, in a rusty shade of gold, underlined by a drawing of their 
trademark red and green belt. It worked for several reasons, not least because 
of Michele’s self-referentiality which feels very in the air (Armaniquickly 
followed suit

).

The T-shirt also feels very on-trend, contexualised by wearers such as Olly 
Alexander from Years & Years and Justin Theroux, whose new status as clothes 
horse is underlined by his love for iconic vintage T-shirts. Although the 
T-shirts are yet to be made available from Gucci online,Ebay

 is filled with vintage Gucci T-shirts, which are almost as exciting.
