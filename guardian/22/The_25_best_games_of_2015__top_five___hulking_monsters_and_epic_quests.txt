Here they are: the five best games of 2015. After a week of discussion, 
controversy and disbelief, we reach the end of our journey with – somewhat 
fittingly – five games that are about epic quests.


Once again, we based on our list on the titles the Guardian games writers 
actually played the most this year, and collectively we have probably lost 
thousands of hours to these adventures – and will continue to do so into 2016.

All of these entries speak of the vast ambition and technical brilliance 
inherent in the modern games industry. Although this is a medium prone to 
nostalgia, we should sometimes stop and recognise something: this is an amazing 
time to be a gamer.

 A beautiful vision of the post-apocalypse … Fallout 4. 
Fallout 4 was what we expected. The Commonwealth, founded on what used to be 
Boston, is an uncommonly beautiful vision of the post-apocalypse. Filled with 
shattered remnants of structures past, themselves crammed with crannies and the 
promise of treasure, simply walking is an adventure for the eyes. A dangerous 
one mind, thanks to the pulpy sci-fi monsters and endless combat that 
punctuates the Wanderer’s journey. The goal of a roleplaying game is to make 
the player invest in another world, and create their own stories within it –
Fallout 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/fallout-4> certainly pushes 
the button.

4. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate (3DS) 
 The most content-rich game Capcom has ever produced … Monster Hunter 4 
Ultimate. 
Monster Hunter 4U 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/17/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-game-of-year>
 is the experienced professional in this list, the latest entry in a series 
that nailed the core mechanics early and has iterated since. But MH4U goes far 
beyond simple refinement, and into offering what is perhaps the most 
content-rich game Capcom has ever produced. Come for the thrilling monster 
battles with precision combat, stay for the fine outfits you can make out of 
their hides, and be swept away by the camaraderie of hunters co-operating 
online.

 Hideo Kojima bows out … Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. 
Hideo Kojima’s swansong is overshadowed by the ongoing saga of his departure 
for Konami. A pity because MGSV: The Phantom Pain brought a spectacular close 
to a unique, inventive series that leaves no obvious successor. Kojima 
Productions re-engineered the core of MGS’s stealth system to fit a new kind of 
open-world: condensed, detail-rich, both battleground and playground. The most 
fun parts, like the fulton, feed into the fleshed-out metagame of Mother Base – 
and constructing the army that Solid Snake will destroy in 1987’s Metal Gear. 
This is the end for Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid, wrapped back into the 
beginning. But what a way to go.

 State of the art game design … Witcher 3. 
A world so big you can lose yourself in it for days, a gruff-voiced lead 
character who somehow retains humour and humanity, and a menagerie of horribly 
memorable monsters and antagonists – Witcher 3 is everything you could want 
from an open world role-playing adventure. It takes its fiction seriously, but 
not so seriously that one of the first side quests you happen across is helping 
an old woman find her favourite cooking pot. This is state of the art 
mainstream game design.

 A world overrun by beasts … Bloodborne. Photograph: Sony 
Bloodborne’s director Hidetaka Miyazaki doesn’t create game worlds, he creates 
game systems and weaves a world and its history around them. The streets of 
Yharnam are overrun by beasts and culled by hunters like you - who survive 
through regular blood ministration. But Yharnam is only the gate to an Eldritch 
nightmare, and the shattered remnants of societies obsessed with the uncaring 
‘Great Ones.’

 This rich mythos combines with an action-oriented twist on third-person 
combat, which is built around permanent aggression from the player and the use 
of trick weapons - a curved sword that becomes a scythe, say. The hulking 
werewolves and brain-sucking abominations will rip you apart in a second 
regardless, but it’s the exquisite boss fights that elevate this combat system 
to all-time-great status.

 Lovecraft and intense precision combat are not for everyone, and Bloodborne 
is a tough challenge to boot. But it’s 2015’s most important AAA release for 
showing how to better-integrate the many, many component parts of a videogame 
into a coherent package. Bloodborne’s world is built upon blood, literally and 
metaphorically, and every part of the design flows from this.

Honorable mentions – the games that just missed out

Cibele: Nina Freeman’s autobiographical tale has interesting things to say 
about love and relationships in the era of online gaming.


Volume: Robin Hood meets Metal Gear Solid in this clever minimalist stealth 
puzzler, which will soon be getting an outing onPlayStation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/playstation> VR.

Yoshi’s Woolly World: Another beautiful handicraft adventure, following on 
from the luscious Kirby’s Epic Yarn.

Star Wars Battlefront: Limited in terms of depth and progression, but EA Dice 
perfectly captures the look, feel and atmosphere of the movies.

Pillars of Eternity: Obsidian Entertainment’s spiritual successor to classic 
action RPGs Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale is as deep, engaging and 
well-written as fans demanded.
