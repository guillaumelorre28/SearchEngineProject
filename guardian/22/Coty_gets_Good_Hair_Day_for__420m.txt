Beauty <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/beauty> products maker Coty Inc 
has said it would buy Good Hair Day (ghd), a high-end hairstyling appliances 
brand, from private equity firm Lion Capital LLP for about £420m ($522m).

Coty, which owns hair colour brands such as Wella and Clairol, became the 
global No 2 in hair colour and styling products through its$12.5bn acquisition 
of Procter & Gamble’s perfume, hair care and makeup businesses

 in October.

London-based ghd generated £178m in revenue in fiscal year 2016. 

The business will become part of Coty’s professional beauty unit, which 
services salon owners and professionals in hair and nail care, and will be a 
standalone business led by its current chief executive Anthony Davey and team, 
Coty said on Monday.

The all-cash deal, to conclude by the end of 2016, is expected to immediately 
add to Coty’s earnings, the company said.

Coty said last year it would shift its executive team to London, as part of 
its transformation into a global beauty products maker.

 Lion Capital and ghd are being advised by Rothschild & Co and Proskauer Rose 
LLP. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP is the legal adviser to Coty.
