Sound of the city

A scacciapensieri – a typical instrument known also as marranzanu in Sicilian 
dialect – is played using your mouth and plucked with your finger, as the 
positions of the tongue make different sounds. Now, few people play this 
instrument, but this clip includes three original pieces composed and played by 
the musician Giuseppe Marino.

 Arab-Norman Cathedral of Palermo. Photograph: Anna Ditta 
The Arab-Norman Cathedral of Palermo represents a charming example of the 
historical commingling of cultures in the city. In AD831 the Saracens took 
control of Palermo and transformed the original seventh century cathedral into 
a large mosque called Gami, until the Norman conquest of the city returned the 
building to Christian worship. The cathedral as we know it today was erected in 
1185 by the archbishop Walter Ophamil.


In July 2015 it was given world heritage status by Unesco, together with other 
monuments in the region including the Monreale and Cefalù Cathedrals and the 
Palatine Chapel, which are part of theArab-Norman itinerary 
<http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1487> – defined as an “outstanding example of a 
socio-cultural syncretism between western, Islamic, and Byzantine cultures”.

Homegrown talent


Davide Shorty is a songwriter, beat-maker and rapper from Palermo who moved to 
London a few years ago. His single My Soul Trigger dedicated to his hometown, 
gained him the third place in the Italy’s X Factor and nationwide popularity. 
Shorty was previously part of the group Combomastas known for the hit U 
Tagghiamu stu Palluni <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8CBPoJ10qw> (2008).

Biggest controversy?


Due to its geographical position, Sicily has become a primary destination for 
an increasing number of refugees and migrants. According to statistics from the
UNHCR <http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=105>, at the time of 
writing, 59,042 people have arrived in Italy by sea in 2016 – 35,289 in Sicily 
– and 29% of arrivals come from the world’s top 10 highest refugee-producing 
countries.

Sicilian inhabitants, especially those on the small island of Lampedusa, have 
been on the frontline welcoming refugees. Agnese Ciulla, regional government 
member responsible for social activity, recently attracted media attention 
because she takes care of 480 unaccompanied minors as foster children (15% of 
arrivals by sea are unaccompanied minors).

But migrant reception is not always easy to organise, and on 28 March, a 
protest took place 
<http://gds.it/2016/03/28/siamo-in-troppi-protesta-dei-migranti-in-centro-di-prima-accoglienza-a-palermo_493154>
 in Palermo’s Via Monfenera, where an overcrowded reception centre hosts 240 
migrants.

 Palermo’s sack. Photograph: Anna Ditta 
During the 1950s and 60s an abnormal building expansion known as Sacco di 
Palermo (Palermo’s Sack) upset the architectural character of the city. The 
wider construction was, in many cases, favourable to Cosa Nostra (Sicilian 
mafia) business interests, and produced 10 or more storey concrete buildings. 
Some 19th-century liberty-style houses were demolished to make way for the new 
buildings. A clear example is the demolition of Villa Deliella (designed by the 
architect Ernesto Basile, famous representative of art nouveau style), which 
was destroyed in 1959 over just one weekend. A car park is now in its place.


Moment in history

The Maxiprocesso (Maxi-trial) is a famous criminal trial against mafia members 
that took place in 1986-7 at the Tribunale di Palermo, thanks to the work of 
the “anti-mafia pool” made up of a team of prosecutors coordinated by Giovanni 
Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. More than 400 people were investigated for a 
series of mafia-connected crimes. The trial ended with 19 life sentences 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/17/world/338-guilty-in-sicily-in-a-mafia-trial-19-get-life-terms.html>
 and more than 300 convictions (among them also the mafia bosses Toto Riina and 
Bernardo Provenzano), and overall 2,665 years of imprisonment.


The Maxi-trial was the first time in history when mafia existence was 
recognised by the state and punished as a specific crime. Falcone and 
Borsellino were both killed in two different attacks organised by mafia in 1992.
Giovanni Falcone <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNHFb9vGig8>, his wife 
Francesca Morvillo and the members of the security detail were killed in an 
explosion on the motorway near Capaci, 18km far from Palermo. Two red obelisks, 
one at each side of the street, commemorate the victims.

 Sicilian photographer Francesco Faraci captures the grit of Palermo’s suburbs. 
Photograph: Francesco Faraci 
Palermo suburbs with their mixture of cultures, flavours and energy is in my 
opinion successfully represented by the work of photographerFrancesco Faraci 
<http://www.francescofaraci.com/>. He says his work is inspired by 
“contradictions, existential paradoxes, and cultural crossroads of Sicily and 
the immigration flow”. This picture is from his long-term project Malacarne 
(literally “badflesh”), which started in 2013 and portrays children living in 
the poorest outskirts of the city. His work has been published in Italian and 
international newspapers and websites.


What does your city do better than anywhere else?

Sicilian street food is one of the most appreciated peculiarities of the 
region in bothItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> and abroad. 
Stigghiola (lamb guts) are one of Palermo’s specialities, but for more 
sensitive visitors or vegetarians, friedpanelle (made of chickpeas flour, to 
eat inside a sandwich or alone) are a more than convincing alternative.

Sicily is also famous for its sweets: cassata, cassatelle and cannoli above 
all, and an original Palermitan invention is the Setteveli cake. Like the city, 
the cake is composed of stratifications. But in this case, it’s seven different 
layers of chocolate.

Here’s a taste of our street food, with Nino u’ballerino (Nino the dancer) 
serving up Palermo’s top specialitypani ca’meusa (bread with spleen).

 Forco Italico has been neglected by the city and its citizens. Photograph: 
Anna Ditta 
A unique view of Palermo can be enjoyed on Foro Italico lawn, a fascinating 
promenade located between Mount Pellegrino and the sea. Unfortunately the green 
area – a park on the cost of the city – has suffered years of neglectful 
behaviour by public administration and acts of vandalism by citizens. But 
recently, local authorities launched a recovery campaign 
<http://palermo.gds.it/2016/05/25/palermo-al-via-primi-interventi-di-recupero-cosi-rinasce-il-prato-del-foro-italico-video_517203/>
 of the area.


How green is your city?

Despite the significant parks like Villa Giulia and the Botanical Gardens in 
the centre of the city, Palermo is not a very green city. Environmental 
awareness is slowly rising, however, the most recent example is the 
installation of neweco-friendly tourist information points 
<http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/05/09/news/palermo_ecco_i_nuovi_centri_informazione_per_turisti_ecologici_ma_chiusi_il_sabato-139440777/>
.

Most recently, on 16 June, a series of violent blazes  
<http://www.corriere.it/cronache/16_giugno_17/sicilia-roghi-ancora-ovunque-emergenza-resta-df64db9c-344f-11e6-a404-40e2630a61a7.shtml>
spread along the northern coast of Sicily, including the wooded areas around 
Palermo. Due to high temperatures and wind, it was very difficult to 
distinguish the fires, and this soon escalated into an environmental disaster.

 Visit the ‘blue chamber’... Photograph: Anna Ditta 
A few steps away from the Ballarò market is Via Porta di Castro, located on 
the old bed of river Kemonia. Here inside the flat of the journalists Giuseppe 
Cadili and Valeria Giarrusso is a mysterious chamber, like something out of One 
Thousand and One Nights. The wonderland chamber (or blue chamber, as it has 
been named) was discovered accidentally in 2013 during a renovation by Franco 
Fazzio, and has been studied by experts from Bonn University, who tried to 
decipher the Arab inscriptions that were hidden for ages behind layers of white 
pastel. The mystery behind this chamber is still not completely clear. In the 
meantime, the room is open tovisitors on specific days.
