In Patmos <http://www.patmos-island.com/> you would hardly know there was a 
crisis. Everything seems just as normal. I have been here for four days with my 
family, and my Canadian in-laws, and we’ve all had a wonderful time, delighting 
in the beauty of the island, the delicious food and the warm welcome we’ve 
received.


There are no shortages of fuel, food or anything else. Restaurants are full. 
The Patmos Hoteliers Association reports that a total of only 50 nights have 
been cancelled. If anything, locals report that tourist numbers are higher than 
last year.

“We’re still laughing,” says Eleni Santouko of Astoria Travel 
<https://www.facebook.com/astoriatravelpatmos>, in the island’s main town, 
Skala. The only cancellations she’s had are by Greeks, and these were around 
the time of the referendum. Some Athenians cancelled because they wanted to 
stay at home to vote.

Patmos, one of the northernmost of the Dodecanese islands, is weathering the 
current storm because it’s a special island. To the Greeks, it is a holy 
island. It is the home of the beautiful and renowned Monastery of St John the 
Theologian, who is said to have written the Book of Revelation in a nearby 
cave. Founded in 1088, the monastery’s fortress-like walls dominate the 
island’s skyline.

Patmos is also protected by its relative inaccessibility: the nearest 
international airports, at Kos and Samos, are both around three hours awayby 
boat <http://www.12ne.gr/en/index.asp>, which means it has not been blighted by 
any huge hotel developments. Beaches are pristine and the whole island has an 
unexploited, old-fashioned feel.

It is also a foodies’ paradise. In three of Skala’s restaurants – Tsipouradiko 
(+30 224 703 2803), Trehantiri (+30 224 703 4080) and Chiliomidi (+30 224 703 
4179) – the owners catch fish in the morning and serve it that night. Even the 
simplest beachside taverna is a delight.

“Patmos is a place people fall in love with, and come back to again and 
again,” says Elina Scoutari, manager of the Porto Scoutari Hotel. “Sixty to 70 
per cent of bookings here are by people who have stayed before.”

As a result, the island is in a very different situation to that of the larger 
islands, which are more dependent on holidaymakers chancing across them as a 
destination, having found good deals on the internet.

The mood among local people has greatly lightened since the referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/05/greek-referendum-no-vote-signals-huge-challenge-to-eurozone-leaders>
. On the day before the vote, there was a palpable sense of unease: some people 
I spoke to were reluctant to talk about it, and there was a fear that the 
country would become dangerously divided. The strength of the No majority has 
done much to reassure Patmians. The vote also seems to have given them a 
welcome sense of catharsis: finally, they have had a chance to take action, 
rather than passively wait on events.

Apocalyptic news reports in other countries are met with incredulity. “There 
is a problem inGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, but it’s not 
nearly as bad as people are saying,” says Vassilis Gryllis, manager of Skala’s 
oldest cafe, the Bar Plaza.

“I just talked to someone in Denmark who’d heard there were no boats between 
the islands,” says Chrissa Gryllis, manager of T&G Car Rental. “The boats are 
running better than ever. There are no shortages that I know of. Things are 
only hard for the [mainland] Greeks.”

“There is no shortage of petrol here,” says cab driver Michael Grammaticus. 
“We had a big delivery of fuel just three days ago.”

“The only shortage I have is money,” says Acoumina Karavis. The cash machine 
of the local National Bank of Greece is working as normal, and tourists with 
foreign accounts can withdraw freely, but locals can only draw out €60 per day.

“The only thing to be careful of is changing foreign banknotes,” says Chrissa 
Gryllis. Exchange restrictions meant her visiting mother was unable to change 
her Australian dollars. “It’s better to change banknotes before you come.”

But beneath the smiles there is, of course, a great deal of anxiety. People 
are hoping the uncertainty will not drag on too long. Eleftheria, who works at 
the Rouge Parfumerie, is concerned about the timing of the crisis: “Things are 
all right now, but August is our main season.”

Elina Scoutari adds: “Come to Patmos! Enjoy! My hotel, Porto Scoutari 
<http://www.portoscoutari.com/hotel/>, is almost fully booked for the whole 
summer right now, but we will gladly help you find another place. Or come in 
September: the sea is warm, the sun shines, and it’s a beautiful month here.”

Most of all, though, the message the people of Patmos want to drive home is 
that all is fine here. “Come to Greece and don’t be afraid,” says Vassilis 
Gryllis. It is a message with which I would wholeheartedly agree. It’s a true 
pleasure to be able to show support for Greece.
