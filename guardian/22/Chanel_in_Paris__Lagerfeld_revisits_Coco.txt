The concept of the front row is understood even by those with just a whisper 
of an interest in fashion. While music venues have their moshpits and politics 
has its front bench, fashion has the Frow. A catwalk front row is a microcosm 
of all the narcissistic peacocking that exists in any industry. But here on the 
Frow, fashion’s top table, everything is laid bare for all to see. It appears 
that Karl Lagerfield is a designer who finds this never-ending fussing over 
seats an absolute delight. Why else would he do away with the row formatting at 
theChanel <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/chanel> show and make every 
single seat – all 3,500 of them – a front row? Certainly not for democratic 
reasons (that seems unlikely for a man at the helm of a billion-euro label 
selling bags with four-figure price tags) – it’s more likely for the insider 
fun of it.

Staging a show which was titled Front Row Only with the theme itself being 
catwalk show is both meta and standard for the German-born designer, who likes 
to fool around with fashion and its tropes. This season, his Chanel 
extravaganza was more in the concept than the execution. Gone were the fancy 
sets (see thesupermarkets

 of catwalks past) and instead he constructed a fancy fashion salon with cream 
walls, carpets and giant mirrors. It was a salon presentation on steroids. A 
mashup between the brand’s Coco Chanel heritage with Lagerfield’s pop-art spin 
on it.

If the set represented a meeting of fashion minds, so did the clothes. The 
models wore flattened boater hats – much loved by Coco herself – with strings 
of pearls in cartoonish dimensions. The flat boots with tweed suits were the 
sort in which a Duchess might feed the chickens of her country estate, while 
the tweed iPad covers were more akin to an international airport lounge. 
Emoji-printed shoppers – complete with peace V signs, cat faces and flowers – 
were a typical move from the designer to get cash tills ringing. The 
fingerless, quilted leather gloves said Lagerfeld, while the giant trapeze 
trench coats said Coco in her Scottish estate.

The show was at its best when at its most modern. Top was a black leather 
hooded anorak with quilted sleeves, hinting at the Parisian rush towards a more 
street approach. Less country chic, more street scally is what the Frow is 
getting excited about.
