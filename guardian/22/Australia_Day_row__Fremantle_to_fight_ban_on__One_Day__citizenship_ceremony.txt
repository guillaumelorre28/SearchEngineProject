Fremantle will fight a federal government ban on holding a citizenship 
ceremony as part of its alternativeAustralia Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-day> celebrations on 28 
January.

The planned ceremony was blocked by the assistant immigration minister, Alex 
Hawke, on Friday on the grounds that it would breach the Australian Citizenship 
Ceremonies Code, which stipulates that ceremonies must be “non-commercial, 
apolitical, bipartisan and secular”.

The Fremantle mayor, Brad Pettitt, told the West Australian 
<https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/33420519/fremantle-to-cancel-australia-day-citizenship-ceremony/#page1>
 that the council would try to convince Hawke a ceremony on 28 January would be 
“like every other”.

If that doesn’t work they will hold a citizenship ceremony on another day, so 
long as it is not 26 January.

The Western Australian city announced in February that it would replace its 
usual Australia Day celebrations with a “One Day” celebration two days later, 
out of respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents who regard 
26 January as Invasion Day.

It is the first local government in Australia to act on the “Change the Date” 
campaign, which calls for Australia’s national day to be moved to a date that 
is more inclusive.

The decision was made after consultation with community groups, including the 
local Indigenous community.

Hawke said it sent an anti-Australia Day message and was therefore political.


“It’s really important … we’ve got hundreds of councils administering this 
around the country … that they don’t get the idea they can use citizenship as a 
political football,”he said 
<http://www.communitynews.com.au/fremantle-gazette/news/fremantles-australia-day-alternative-citizenship-ceremony-blocked/>
. “We’re very dark on that.”

The WA senator Rachel Siewert said it was hypocritical of the Turnbull 
government to accuse Fremantle of using citizenship as a political football and 
disingenuous to characterise opposition to the date change as apolitical.

“I think they need to look at what they have been doing with citizenship 
before they accuse anyone else of using citizenship as a political football,” 
she told Guardian Australia.

Siewert said Fremantle was a progressive city and opposition to the date 
change was loudest outside its boundaries, among the ranks of the WA Liberal 
party.

Hawke’s office confirmed that he had been asked to look at the issue by 
Liberal MP Ben Morton, whose electorate of Tangney neighbours the Labor-held 
seat of Fremantle.

“Citizenship ceremonies should in no way be associated with events making a 
political statement like Fremantle’s One Day event,” Mortontold the West 
Australian 
<https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/33420519/fremantle-to-cancel-australia-day-citizenship-ceremony/#page1>
.

Siewert said continuing to celebrate Australia Day on 26 January, given the 
history of the date and the distress it caused Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander people, would also make a political statement.

“It’s clearly a political issue and it will continue to be a political people 
because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People and others will continue 
to raise it as a point of discussion,” she said.

The first formal protest against against the date, the national Day of 
Mourning, was held in 1938, just three years after 26 January became known as 
Australia Day.

It has only been regularly celebrated as a public holiday on that date since 
1994 – before then, a public holiday was taken on the Monday closest.

The founder of IndigenousX, Luke Pearson, has said that 26 January “will 
always be Invasion Day, Survival Day, a Day of Mourning ... It will always be a 
day of protest for as long as there are things that need to be protested 
against”.

Hawke has been contacted for comment.
