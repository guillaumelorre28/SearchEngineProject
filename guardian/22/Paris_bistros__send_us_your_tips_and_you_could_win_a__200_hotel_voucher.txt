This week we’re searching for the best bistros in Paris. From vintage cafes to 
traditional eateries and “bistronomiques” – we want to know exactly where you 
savoured your favourite French dishes.

Send us your tips via GuardianWitness 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/56964589e4b0962b6cc14c5f> – 
including as much detail as you can (with website, menu details and prices if 
possible) and you could win a £200 hotel voucher.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
from Hotels.com, allowing you to stay in more than 260,000 places worldwide. 
Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using the text tab.

You’re welcome to add a photo if you own the copyright to it – but it’s the 
text we’ll be judging!

Your tip should be around 100 words long. Terms and conditions
