Gertrude Bell was one of Britain’s most extraordinary women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/08/top-10-inspiring-female-travel-adventurers>
 – an explorer in the late 19th and early 20th century, a great linguist, an 
archaeologist, a writer, a mountaineer ... Between the first and second world 
wars she was better known than Lawrence of Arabia, yet today few people are 
aware of her. She’s best known for her travels in Syria and Iraq – but she 
travelled extensively in Turkey, too, and I’ve been following in her footsteps 
there.

 Pat Yale is writing a book about Gertrude Bell’s travels in Turkey 
I stumbled upon Gertrude by chance – I saw an entry she’d written in a 
prominent Ottoman archaeologist’s guestbook at an exhibition in Istanbul. It 
inspired me to read her diaries and letters, which I found at Newcastle 
University. It turned out she’d travelled the length and breadth of Turkey. I 
got a map and marked everything I could identify and set off to retrace her 
journey.

Ephesus was almost as popular at the end of the 19th century as it is now. I 
followed Gertrude up on to the walls that run around the site – nobody goes 
there but you get a bird’s eye view. Do it with caution, the first part is 
straightforward, but stop where the walls have fallen down. I didn’t and had to 
phone to be rescued!

I’ll never forget visiting Şanlıurfa, (also known as Urfa) in the south-east, 
during Ramadan. Only more adventurous travellers go there today. It was July 
and 47C: everyone was fasting and life came to a halt. I visited a mosque 
Gertrude had been to which had a stream running through it. Boys were swimming 
at one end, men with trouser legs rolled up were sitting at the other end – 
probably a scene played out for centuries. One of the problems I’ve faced 
researching my book on Bell’s travels is that a lot of places in eastern and 
south-eastern Turkey are off-limits at the moment.

Gertrude wrote a book about churches and monasteries in the Tur Abdin region, 
in the south-east. It’s still full of incredible Syrian Orthodox churches, most 
of them newly restored. It’s hilly and very pretty; it reminds me of the 
Cotswolds. In a perfect world it would be a place for eco-tourism, but it’s 
blighted by the nearby conflicts so few people go there. Gertrude was astounded 
that nobody knew anything about the churches – and nothing has really changed.

Istanbul <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/series/istanbul-city-guide> is an 
incredible city, bustling and chaotic. Like Gertrude, I stayed at the Pera 
Palace 
<https://www.jumeirah.com/en/hotels-resorts/istanbul/pera-palace-hotel-jumeirah/>
, a historic hotel that has been running in the same spot since it opened in 
1892. It belongs to the Jumeirah group now and has been newly restored and is 
very beautiful. I went to buy Turkish delight atHaci Bekir 
<http://www.hacibekir.com/>, a shop she went to near Sirkeci station 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/sep/28/top-10-train-station-restaurants-europe-berlin-paris-amsterdam>
. Staff there told me Gertrude would have bought rose water flavour, the 
fashion back then. This was a magical moment for me.

TE Lawrence was one of the archaeologists at Karkamış, a site that spans the 
border with Syria, and Gertrude visited him there. It’s mostly off limits, but 
I went to the dig hut where a group of archaeologists were staying last year. 
Incredibly, the Italians were still working there, even though Isis was only a 
mile away. Although the British were excavating here between 1911-1914, the 
site was abandoned because of the war, so archaeologists are now discovering 
things for the second time. I saw things TE Lawrence had dug up himself – 
there’s a good chance he’d have shown them to Gertrude when she visited.

Where Gertrude travelled was often dictated by trains – and when the railway 
line ran out she would ride huge distances on horseback. To avoid the heat of 
summer she would travel earlier in the year when mud was a huge problem. Her 
diaries are filled with descriptions of horrendous mud – she describes seeing a 
camel with only its head and hump showing because it had been sucked into the 
mud. In that sense travel has got a whole lot easier – Turkey has an incredible 
network of good roads and trains.

Turkey is huge and has a seemingly limitless number of forgotten historical 
places. There are still many I have not visited, even though I’ve been writing 
about the country for 25 years. People are generally very welcoming – I’ve had 
some wonderful taxi drivers who have been as excited as I was to discover new 
places. In some areas there are so few tourists that I was as much of a 
curiosity as Gertrude must have been.

I live in a cave house in Göreme, Cappadocia. It’s an amazing place known for 
its “fairy chimney” landscape. When I first came here in 1998, most people 
lived in caves – but now they’ve all been turned into boutique hotels. Life has 
changed so much with the money made from running cave hotels and selling 
hot-air balloon rides, every morning in summer we have about 100 balloons 
taking off. People live in modern houses and have washing machines and 
dishwashers; their old way of life has vanished forever.

One challenge I’ve still to face is climbing Mount Hasan, one of the inactive 
volcanoes on the edge of Cappadocia. It’s 3,000 metres, so a proper mountain – 
Gertrude did it, but then she had climbed in the Alps and was an experienced 
mountaineer. I’m not sure I’ll succeed, but I’m willing to give it a go.
