Often portrayed as the strait-laced, industrious counterpart to hedonistic 
Berlin, Munich tends to steer clear of the limelight. Save for its annual 
six-million-person beer binge on Theresienwiese open space for Oktoberfest, the 
Bavarian capital’s reputation abroad remains one of luxury, livability and 
lederhosen.

Behind the staid and steady veneer, however, lies a thriving younger culture, 
an embarrassment of world-class museums and galleries, and burgeoning art, 
student and after-hours scenes.

All this in an eminently green city, laced with 750 miles of tree-lined bike 
paths and the winding banks of the Isar river – perfect for picnicking or 
swimming. Winter, though, is an atmospheric time to visit, with pretty 
Christmas markets to explore and cosy beer halls to warm up in.

WHAT TO SEE
 Mittelaltermarkt is a cross between market and medieval fair 
Christmas markets 

Weihnachtsmärkte, or Christmas markets, are all but inescapable in every major 
German city. They can be crass, commercial affairs decked out in blaring neon, 
but many of Munich’s are of a different sort, with evergreen boughs, fairy 
lights and a genuine sense of holiday cheer. Veer away from the 
Christkindlmarkt on Marienplatz, which packs in more than three million 
visitors a year, and head toAlpenwahn <http://www.alpen-wahn.de/> 
(Viktualienmarkt 15, daily 2pm-11pm, 19 November-1 January, closed 24-25 
December) at Viktualienmarkt, where you can browse the wares while snacking on 
chilli-laced currywurst and drinking red or white mulled wine. In a courtyard 
just off of Odeonsplatz,Weihnachtsdorf in der Residenz 
<http://dasweihnachtsdorf.de/> (daily 11am-9pm, 23 November-22 December) is the 
city’s newest market, where live bands or choirs often perform and the scent of 
caramelised almonds perfumes the air. On the whimsical side, theMittelaltermarkt
 
<http://www.mittelaltermarkt-muenchen.de/mittelaltermarkt_html/seiten/start_de.html>
 (Wittelsbacherplatz, Brienner Strasse 6-10, open daily 11am-8pm, 26 November- 
23 December) hovers somewhere between traditional market and medieval fair, 
with steamingDrachenblut (dragon’s blood) served in goblets and roast suckling 
pig inflammkuchen (pizza-like flatbread with crème fraîche, bacon and onions).

Culture and art

Munich has more than 80 museums for culture hounds, including Museum Brandhorst
 <http://www.museum-brandhorst.de/> (Theresienstrasse 35a, admission €7), with 
more than 1,000 works spanning classical avant-garde to American pop. The
Lenbachhaus <http://www.lenbachhaus.de/?L=1> (Luisenstrasse 33, admission €10) 
has a Norman Foster-designed wing housing expressionist pieces. Equally 
impressive are thetrio of municipal galleries <http://www.pinakothek.de/> – the 
Alte and Neue Pinakothek andthe Pinakothek <http://www.pinakothek.de/en/home> 
der Moderne (day pass to all three €12). Don’t miss theMunich Documentation 
Centre <http://www.ns-dokumentationszentrum-muenchen.de/centre> for the history 
of National Socialism: it’s a stark white, €28.2m modernist structure that 
opened its doors in May on the former site of the Nazi headquarters. The centre 
chronicles the rise of the party, as well as Bavaria’s role in it, in 
unflinching detail (entrance €5).

WHERE TO EAT

Burger & Lobster Bank


Housed in a former bank – and not connected with the international surf and 
turf chain – this is the city’s buzziest restaurant. It is decorated with 
gleaming safety boxes and other swanky touches from its former tenant, with 
formidable filet steaks (€22.50) and blistered, frico-sprinkledpimientos de 
padrón cosying up to the sous-vide Canadian lobster (€29.50). Burgers run the 
gamut from 24-hour slow-cooked pork belly to a ramen bun, but I stick to The 
Classic One, which comes on a brioche so buttery it all but liquefies on the 
tongue. Both the kitchen and bar go on until the wee hours, a rarity in Munich. 
Live DJs and an expansive cocktail list, littered with house infusions – think 
vodka with bacon, or Maker’s Mark with roasted walnuts – fuel weekend parties 
in the courtyard.

Tian

If Munich conjures up visions of poodle-sized pork knuckles, this newcomer is 
a stylish, meat-free alternative. Every brilliantly hued dab and squiggle is 
composed of seasonal produce, much of it local, and the tasting menus are 
indulgent rather than restrictive. Try dishes like the lush appetiser of 
mozzarella and artichokes with mint, basil-sponge cake and lemon zest-perfumed 
gel (€15), or a main of porcini gnocchi (€16). Chef Christoph Mezger trained at 
Tian’s Michelin-starred sister restaurant in Vienna.

Wirtshaus Hohenwart

Genuine Bavarian restaurants are increasingly scarce, which is why this one is 
both a throwback and a revelation. The 1896 building was gutted and refurbished 
to its rustic glory last year. Original furnishings, including a vintage 
bowling lane, were kept wherever possible, while newer additions – such as the 
looping recording in the restrooms of comedian Gerhard Polt, who filmedMan 
Spricht Deutsch <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIR9ebcZfdY> here – add a wry 
edge. Save for a few concessions to modern tastes – a tartare here, a salad 
with chanterelles there – the menu excels at the classics. Order fish from 
nearbyStarnberger See lake 
<http://www.bayregio-starnberger-see.de/starnberger-see-english.php> or the 
regal veal schnitzel, cloaked in butter-fried breadcrumbs.
• Gietlstrasse 15, +49 89 6939 7575, hohenwart.net <http://hohenwart.net/> 

Spezlwirtschaft

It may be located in a space dating back to 1264, but there’s nothing stodgy 
or stuffy about Spezlwirtschaft and its spin on the regional cuisine. Subtle 
twists, such as kohlrabi schnitzel or spinachknödel (dumplings), freshen up the 
menu, while the hip-hop club downstairs draws a lively crowd on weekends. But 
the beats can’t upstage the German grandmother-worthy portions, or the staples, 
such as gooeykäsespätzle (like macaroni with cheese, €9.80) in a miniature 
skillet, with a crown of fried onions.

Prowl the food markets

Any trip to the city would be lacking without an afternoon perusing the 
charcuterie, foraged mushrooms and artisan breads at Viktualienmarkt in the 
city centre. Munich’s most famous market is a people-watching extravaganza 
ideal for both scouting edible souvenirs and sipping aradler (beer with 
lemonade). Local foodies mourned the recent loss of Schrannenhalle, a 
glass-enclosed former granary next to the outdoor market, but are already 
looking forward to the Eataly destined to take its place early next year.

WHERE TO DRINK

Visit the beer gardens – even in winter
 Augustiner-Keller beer garden. Photograph: Alamy 
Beer is still consumed in Munich outside Oktoberfest, albeit with slightly 
less gusto. On sunny days, Müncheners pass the time in the city’s beer gardens, 
and when the weather turns foul, they carry on in the indoor restaurants and 
beer cellars they are usually attached to.

Augustiner-Keller <http://www.augustinerkeller.de/home/> (Arnulfstrasse 52) 
has been pouring foaming ales from immense wooden barrels since 1812 and 
remains one of the most popular. For a less rowdy atmosphere,Park Café 
<http://www.parkcafe089.de/> (Sophienstrasse 7) in the Old Botanical Garden has 
a shady courtyard and a restaurant serving gut-busting renditions of German 
dishes. In the English Gardens, theChinesischer Turm <http://chinaturm.de/> 
(Englischer Garten 3) hosts bands beneath the wooden pagoda in summer. Come now 
for glühwein ladled from copper kettles at the most festive Christmas market in 
town (daily noon-8.30pm, 27 November-23 December).


Les Fleurs du Mal

Charles Schumann has opened a cocktail bar above his main eponymous 
establishment, a spare room with a lone table carved from a walnut tree. The 
furnishings may be minimalist, but the cocktail menu features impressive 
selections of more than 150 types of whiskies, and absinthes, cognacs and rare 
spirits aplenty.

<http://schumanns.de/en/schumanns-les-fleurs-du-mal.html>

Theresa Bar

Step into the courtyard, past the industrial-sleek Theresa Grill, where 
waiters in plain white T-shirts serve 35-day dry-aged hunks of Bavarian beef, 
to this newer watering hole. Velvet and crystal adorn the room, and pretty 
people whisper to one another over corpse revivers and cherry mint juleps.

Jaded Monkey

Bill Fehn presides over the slickest of speakeasies, not far from Karlsplatz. 
No one will sneer at your “usual” order, but with house creations including the 
monkey’s gimlet – Monkey 47 gin, lime, house-made lavender syrup and rosemary 
liqueur – you’re better off trusting the wizards behind the bar.

<http://jadedmonkey.de/>

Goldene Bar

On fine autumn days, join the throngs sipping Lillet aperitifs on the pleasant 
terrace at Goldene Bar, behind Haus der Kunst. When the weather turns chilly, 
scurry indoors for a steaming mug of rum with coconut water and homemade spice 
butter. The gilded interior, with its antique crystal chandelier and original 
1930s cartographic murals, references the darker days of the building, when it 
served as a propaganda piece for the Third Reich.

Mixed Munich Arts

This towering techno temple which opened last year rivals any in Berlin. But 
the thundering bass isn’t the only draw: the venue opened last year in an 
abandoned power plant, and its cavernous concrete halls also feature classical 
concerts, art exhibitions, street-food fests and fine dining.
• Katharina-von-Bora-Strasse 8A, mixedmunicharts.de 
<http://mixedmunicharts.de/club.html>

Zephyr

Sparsely decorated and perpetually cramped, Zephyr keeps the fanfare squarely 
on the drinks, which are served with elaborate garnishes – such as coffee beans 
and charred cinnamon sticks. A Renaissance still life’s worth of fresh 
ingredients and an unfailingly meticulous staff make this a must.

WHERE TO STAY


Hotel Lux

A dizzying ascent up Hotel Lux’s handsome spiral staircase takes guests to the 
individually designed suites. Accommodation is on the small side, but the 
thoughtfully chosen works of art and dead-central location more than make up 
for it. If you’re feeling flush, head to the street-level bar and press the 
bell labelled “Ring for Champagne” for two glasses of bubbly.

Louis Hotel

At the Louis, tastefully understated interiors, in timber and stone, hide 
behind the hotel’s baroque facade. Head to Emiko on the roof terrace in summer 
months for sashimi and one of the best views in the city. For winter evenings,
Chocolaterie Beluga <http://chocolateriebeluga.de/>, by the entrance, offers 30 
different types of gourmet hot chocolate.

Hotel Laimer Hof


Located near the grand old Nymphenburg Palace 
<http://www.laimerhof.de/destination/nymphenburg/schloss-nymphenburg/#height_457>

<http://www.hirschgarten.com/beer-garden-munich-the-biggest-beer-garden-in-muenchen-and-bavaria-koeniglicher-hirschgarten-munich.html>
, this charming small hotel, run by husband and wife team Sebastian and 
Alexandra Rösch, as quiet rooms off the main drag. Although the refurbished 
1890 structure lacks some of the comforts of newer, flashier hotels, it’s hard 
to quibble with a welcome this warm.

The Flushing Meadows Hotel & Bar

What if you gave a bunch of creative types – a hip-hop musician, a painter, a 
DJ – the chance to design their dream room? That’s exactly what happened with 
the 11 loft studios on the third floor of this converted post office, which 
opened last year as quirky-cool Flushing Meadows. Austrian actressBirgit 
Minichmayr <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591352/> included a selection of her 
favourite films, while pro surferQuirin Rohleder 
<http://surfersmag.de/tag/quirin-rohleder#zbt45dm1cU6wuXb1.97> insisted on a 
board and a giant hammock. In the evenings, sip craft cocktails in the rooftop 
lounge.
