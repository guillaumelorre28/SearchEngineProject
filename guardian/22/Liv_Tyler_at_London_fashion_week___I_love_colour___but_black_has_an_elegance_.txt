Liv Tyler is on her second capsule collection with Belstaff for spring/summer 
2017. She was atLondon fashion week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-fashion-week> on Sunday to showcase 
it but made time to have a chat with us first. Here is what we learned.

She’s a big fan of capes

“I love capes,” she says. “So we made a cape.” Indeed. Said design shows she 
is a cape pro: it has a lovely cut, pulled in at the back with a sweet button 
at the neck. Enough to convince even the biggest of cape sceptics.

She is from rock ’n’ roll stock

The collection is partly inspired by the Rolling Stones and features 
Belstaff’s signature bikers with a feminine silhouette. “I grew up with rock 
’n’ roll, leather pants and everything, so I was almost allergic to it,” she 
says. “This collection allowed me to embrace my inner rock child.”

Black is (probably) her favourite colour

Tyler was in all black for her Belstaff gig – a pussy-bow blouse, pleated 
skirt and high pumps. With those raven tresses and translucent skin, she’s 
basically an advertisement for the gothiest shade of the palette. “I love 
colour,” she says “but black has an elegance.” It features heavily in her 
Belstaff collection: a floral print on a black bomber is a highlight.

Stealing Beauty influenced her style more than any other of her films

The actor remembers graduating high school and flying to Italy the next to 
star in the 1996 Bernardo Bertolucci film. She wore custom-made Armani, and 
dresses created just for her by the costume designer. A floral one inspired 
this season’s Belstaff collection and features on the moodboard.

Tyler has an archive of clothes to envy

It includes that dress from Stealing Beauty, several Ghost bias-cut dresses, 
two made for her by Alexander McQueen, and some thrift finds. “I have clothes 
that weren’t vintage but now they are because they’re from the 90s,” she says. 
Tyler says she enjoyed the decade – currently a favourite of fashion – because 
“there was a nice freedom pre-social-media, people could let their freak flag 
fly more”.

Those ears in Lord of the Rings were custom-made prosthetics

Tyler’s role in the trilogy as elf Arwen Undomiel saw her in hair and makeup 
for up to three hours. That was nothing on the hobbits. “They had much longer,” 
reveals Tyler “because of their feet.”
