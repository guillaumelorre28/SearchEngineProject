1. The 50 best beaches in the world

Beaches are good for many things, and not just lazing on, as it happens. Which 
is why this comprehensive selection doesn’t take the shore and simple route; 
instead it divides the list into categories: wow factor; wild and remote; best 
for families; best in the UK; best for backpackers; action and adventure 
beaches – and even city beaches.

Whether you’re seeking solitude or a party, shallow waters or pounding surf, 
find the perfect beach in our pick of 50, from Greece to the Galapagos, the 
Highlands to Hawaii.

Go with the flow or swim against the tide? Sometimes picking the destination 
that’s not-quite-so-well travelled can bring holiday happiness. This roundup 
said “meh” to Madrid and put the spotlight on cities including Wrocław, 
Tallinn, Graz, Valletta … and Girona.

Girona: An hour’s drive from the beautiful coastline of Costa Brava. Should 
you wish to combine a trip with some beach time, Girona offers visitors a 
serving of Catalan culture without the swarms of tourists that descend on 
Barcelona during peak season.

straightforward of culinary creations, the search for pizza perfection is 
hotter than a wood-fired oven in … well, hotter than a wood-fired oven. This 
article was almost as well commented on as it was read and came close to 
“topping” our 2016 list. Ouch!

Living the dream. Said in irony by many of us, but something of a travel motto 
– especially for those eager to ditch the day job, wave farewell to the commute 
and head out (not necessarily on the highway, but looking for adventure, 
certainly) into the wide world. You can read how the Meek family did just this 
– and then take a spin through the comments the article garnered, where much 
debate raged.

The Meek family swapped mortgage, work and school for a year of adventures 
around the UK – their home: a caravan, their classroom: the great outdoors.

 article, that we needed to put together a new list based on their 
recommendations. All the passion and enthusiasm for sharing what made their 
favourite such a, well, favourite, was encouraging to see – and more places 
were still being submitted in the comments section too!

Barnard Castle received an enthusiastic endorsement from reader ID6912820: 
“Absolutely lovely town on the river Tees with excellent food places and 
independent shops.” The town is dominated by the ruined Norman castle which 
gave it its name, but culturally the jewel in the crown has to be the Bowes 
Museum, a French-style chateau which houses an extraordinary collection of fine 
and decorative art, including works by El Greco, Goya and Canaletto.

Ann Morgan spent a year reading a book from every country in the world … and 
then we asked her to pick 10 of her favourites; that’s right, just 10 – out of 
196. Tough gig. The resulting list fired the imagination for trips to places 
including Peru, Angola and Switzerland.

In 2012, I embarked on an eccentric project. Having realised how anglocentric 
my reading was, I decided to try to read a novel, short story collection or 
memoir from every UN-recognised country, plus former UN member Taiwan (then 196 
nations in all), in a calendar year. I set up a blog and asked the world’s book 
lovers to help me. Pretty soon suggestions – and even books, manuscripts and 
unpublished translations – were flooding in from around the planet.

Not content with merely rounding up great UK walks, this stompingly good list 
by writers Oliver Balch and Adam McCulloch took into account distance, terrain 
and ability levels. The walks ranged from two miles up to 630 miles and took in 
the best of the UK’s wonderful countryside. Now, put your best foot forward and 
follow their lead.

Burns Trail, Ayrshire. 
Starting out along a combination of country roads and track, the route takes 
you around the grounds of Newark Castle before climbing upwards into the 
Carrick hills. On a clear day, the Firth of Clyde looks resplendent from here, 
basking “gaily in the sunny beam”.

In terms of travelling, one of the saddest aspects of 2016 was the way 
conflict and political instability meant certain destinations became subject to 
travel restrictions or warnings, or simply saw tourist numbers dwindle. Amelia 
Gentleman’s beautiful piece on Jordan was incredibly popular and heavily 
commented on, in a mostly positive way – but three weeks after its publication 
Jordan witnesseda violent attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/19/canadian-tourist-killed-in-jordan-attack-named-linda-vatcher>
.

After a while these repeated soothing asides [about safety] became rather 
disconcerting. I hadn’t expected to find Jordan anything other than peaceful, 
but since the bottom has fallen out of the tourism industry because of the 
conflict in neighbouring Syria, most people you meet have an urge to emphasise 
how risk-free a trip here is.

Its idyllic Mediterranean setting and climate, the fine beaches and the 
sumptuous food ensure Sardinia place at travel’s top table. Writer Liz 
Boulter’s evocative and detailed portrait painted a vivid picture of a 
destination with timeless appeal. Don’t read it before lunch, or approaching 
dinner. Actually, do.

Lists of the island’s best beaches run into the hundreds, and there are many 
more unnamed coves and wedges of white, silver or golden sand around its 
1,000km-plus of coastline, peninsulas and islands. There are wild beaches for 
those prepared to tote their own supplies, but most have a shack selling 
drinks, ice-creams and snacks.

 Corsica Studios, London 
London’s long-awaited night tube could be seen as a gift to the capital’s 
clubbers – or just those not overly fond of the night bus home. As several 
lines started a non-stop weekend service we asked the cream of London’s club 
scene to point us to the party.

“Corsica Studios in Elephant and Castle has to be the best club in London: it 
showcases world-class artists in two (sometimes three) contrasting rooms on an 
incredible Funktion-One sound system. It’s the only place I’ve kept going to 
for all the time I’ve lived here.”
DEBONAIR is a DJ and hosts a bi-weekly show on NTS Radio.

 Paddleboarding, Belize 
Sticking to the brief that if you are going to go on a big trip make sure it’s 
a grand adventure, this selection of active getaways featured tackling high 
peaks in Mongolia, exploring the Tapajos river in Brazil, island hopping in 
Indonesia and paddleboarding – from inn to inn – in Belize. Deep breath now.

The island-rich coast of Belize is home to one of the first guided 
lodge-to-lodge stand-up paddleboarding trips in the world. Guests paddle 
through the South Water Caye Marine Reserve, exploring mangrove channels and 
reefs, watching out for stingrays, manatees and pelicans. Evenings are spent at 
small, family-run inns, where the day ends with snorkelling and watching the 
sun set from a hammock.

Some travel articles sound a warning, and are an opportunity to shout about 
failings that need to be addressed. Novelist Deepti Kapoor lamented that “the 
beautiful, laid-back Goa of old is disappearing amid pollution, 
over-development and fears over personal safety”.

My husband and I moved to north Goa eight years ago, though I first visited 
with my family 30 years ago, when I was four; we drove down from Bombay in the 
car, my brother seeing his first nudist on the beach, his mind blown. This time 
we came so I could study yoga, and we realised there was no reason to leave. 
Goa was beautiful, laid-back yet exciting, a meeting place for the world. Sure, 
there were problems. But the beaches! The restaurants! The music, and the 
people!

The outgoing year was a big one for the great outdoors in the US, with the 
National Park Service celebrating its 100th anniversary. Having already looked 
atwhere to stay in the 10 most popular national parks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/25/10-best-places-to-stay-us-national-parks>
, this article was a chance to shine an environmentally sensitive spotlight on 
a selection of parks that might lose out, in the attention stakes, to bigger or 
grander locations.

Black Canyon of the Gunnison national park, Colorado. 
This is not the deepest canyon in North America but it is the steepest, with 
the Gunnison river falling more than 10 metres per mile as it plunges through 
this narrow national park in south-west Colorado (in comparison, the Colorado 
river drops an average of 2.3 metres per mile through the Grand Canyon).
