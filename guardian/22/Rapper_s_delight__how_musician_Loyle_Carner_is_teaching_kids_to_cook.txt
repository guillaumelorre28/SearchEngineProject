To the wider world he is becoming known as Loyle Carner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/22/loyle-carner-review-garage-london>
, a brilliant young rapper. But in a test kitchen near London’s Old Street he 
is plain old Ben, a lively 21-year-old showing six teenagers with ADHD, and one 
with anxiety, how to make pasta with pesto. It’s one of the hottest days of the 
year, and the fans whirring in each corner are not an optional extra.

Ben rushes from station to station, chopping herbs, grating parmesan and 
smashing garlic. Along with slick knife skills that belie long years of 
practice, he has the easy enthusiasm of a born teacher and his charges are 
absorbed in their tasks. One of his students, Eric, offers up his bowl of green 
paste for Ben to taste. “That’s sick,” says Ben approvingly. Both of them break 
out in broad grins.

“We had warnings from some of the parents that their kids might do this or 
that,” Ben tells me later. “But they’ve been brilliant. There has been no 
talking back, no aggression. Everyone is happy and learning.”

This is day two of Chilli Con Carner, a new initiative Ben is working on with 
theGoma Collective <https://www.gomacollective.com/>, a social enterprise 
focusing on creative projects. Ingredients have been provided by Borough 
Market, with support in the kitchen by catering company Get Stuffed. Ben has 
always known cooking could be therapeutic for those with ADHD, because he grew 
up with the condition himself.

“I was energetic and annoying and my mum would sometimes struggle to keep me 
in check,” he says. “But I loved making dinner. By the time I was six or seven 
I got to the point where I could cook on my own. The first thing I made was a 
sweet chilli squid. I was fascinated by squid: I’d gut it, slice it up and 
marinate it. But I had so many cultures bouncing around inside me – I’m half 
Guyanese but I had friends from Somalia, Morocco, Japan.”

Hospitality runs deep in the family – his maternal grandparents ran a 
restaurant on Skye. His mother is a special-needs teacher, and saw that, in the 
kitchen, her son could focus his spare energies while also providing tasty 
family meals.

“Often you hear kids with ADHD talk in terms of what they can’t do, but 
there’s lots of things they can do,” Ben says. “As my old teacher used to say: 
you shouldn’t judge a fish by how it can climb a wall.”

Kids with ADHD can do lots of things. You shouldn't judge a fish by how it 
climbs a wall

Ben looks so at home in the kitchen that it is easy to forget he is also one 
of Britain’s most hotly tipped young musicians, nominated for the BBC’s Sound 
of 2016 and halfway through a string of high-profile festival performances. 
Songs like “Ain’t Nothing Changed” – a languid, jazzy paen to his London 
upbringing – are winning plaudits and ever-bigger crowds. He is unfailingly 
modest and polite – he runs up and down four flights of stairs seven times to 
fetch his pupils in person for interview – but in his good looks and easy 
charisma there is obvious star power.

While studying at the Brit school in Croydon – alma mater of Amy Winehouse and 
Adele, among countless others – he thought about going to catering college but 
accepted a drama scholarship to university. His time there was cut short in 
2013 by the death of his beloved stepfather. He moved back home to support his 
mother and stepbrother, and would cook the evening meal.

He found his first intake of pupils through contacts of his mother’s and by 
putting up a notice at his old school. With some reluctance he advertised on 
his own social media, because he wanted kids with ADHD rather thanLoyle Carner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/loyle-carner> fans. The course lasts a week, 
with the students learning a different dish each day before serving a meal to 
their parents at the end of the week. Ben’s plan is that this is the first of 
many.

“The worry is that people think I’m just doing this for publicity, which is 
why I wanted to get it up and running – and hopefully able to stand on its own 
– before I get busy touring. I don’t want it to look like I’m some washed-up 
guy trying to stay relevant.

“I have no idea if I’m even going to be a rapper in six months’ time. I could 
tank. I can’t get away from music because I love it and it’s going well, but if 
it wasn’t for music I would be doing this. Working with these kids I feel 
unlike I ever have before. Writing is a release. You don’t have to think about 
anything else while you’re doing it. It just flows through you. It’s like 
cooking.”
