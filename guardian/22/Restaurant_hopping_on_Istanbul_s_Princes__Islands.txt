Whenever we're in need of a vacation but can't afford the airfare, we take a 
ferry to Princes' Islands, a lovely archipelago just off Istanbul's Asian 
shore. For the price of just a few lira, we're transported to a small slice of 
traffic-free paradise where, if we manage to get away from the crowds and 
explore some of the islands' quiet back streets, we feel as if we've found our 
way back to the late 19th century and an Istanbul that no longer exists on the 
mainland.

We're especially fond of the islands in springtime, when their Judas, mimosa 
and wild plum trees are starting to bloom and a walk along one of their 
tranquil trails serves as the perfect cure for the lingering effects of the 
Istanbul winter blues. Of course, a good meal is essential any time of the 
year, and we've been lucky enough to find a few spots on the islands that are 
worthy destinations in and of themselves. For those planning a visit to the 
Princes' Islands, here are some suggestions:

On Burgazada: Kalpazankaya Restaurant

Burgazada is the smallest and least visited of the Princes' Islands. The 
island has few easily accessible beaches and picnic spots, but what it does 
have is a laid-back atmosphere and several charming waterfront restaurants and 
cafes in the harbour. Better yet, Burgaz is home to Kalpazankaya, an 
out-of-the-way, open-airmeyhane (traditional bar/restaurant) that will quickly 
help you forget about the crowded mass of humanity left behind on the ferry.

Getting to Kalpazankaya is easy: take the road that leads to the right when 
leaving the ferry terminal and continue walking along that road for about 30 
minutes until it comes to an end. In front of you, sitting in splendid 
isolation on a hillside overlooking the blue waters of the Marmara Sea and a 
small pebble beach below, is the restaurant, a collection of vine-shaded 
terraces with rickety wooden tables and chairs.

The meze tray holds all the classics, plus a few surprises, such as a ceviche 
made with sea bass tossed in what seemed like a mustard vinaigrette …

On Heybeliada: Heyamola Ada Lokantasi
 Heyamola Ada Lokantasi 
While the Princes' Islands make for a great escape from the city, it's been 
hard to think of them as a culinary destination. Until now. The 
new-offshore-kid-in-town Heyamola Ada Lokanatasi is a perfect storm of inspired 
food, chill ambience, and small-label Turkish wines, all at ridiculously low 
prices. Heyamola is reason in and of itself to plan a day trip to the islands, 
and if you are already organising your island adventure, this place is a 
compelling argument for ditching the ferry at Heybeli Island, often overlooked 
in favour of the more popular Buyukada.

In every way that matters, it's a great spot to spend an extended afternoon 
that will easily melt into evening and beyond …

On Buyukada: Club Mavi

Considering that you're on an island, you probably want to eat somewhere with 
a view of the sea. Most visitors to Buyukada end up getting lured to the row of 
busy fish restaurants found just beside the island's ferry terminal. All have 
seaside terraces with a view of Istanbul's rapidly developing Asian shore (and 
of the occasional piece of urban flotsam and jetsam that drifts by) and 
similar, predictable menus with decently made but uninspiring food.

A more pleasant (but not cheap) island experience, though, can be had by 
hailing one of Buyukada's horse carriages and asking the driver to take you to 
Club Mavi, a restaurant and hotel located inside a rambling old house on the 
island's undeveloped backside. The ride – past many of the island's grandest 
mansions and through a scented pine forest – is part of the fun. And while the 
restaurant has a menu of fairly typical, though well made, meze and grill 
items, it more than makes up for the lack of any culinary pizzazz with its 
stunning location: up on a bluff that overlooks a nearby island and the open 
sea …

Also on Buyukada: SofrAda Restoran

One of the questions that we frequently ask ourselves during visits to 
Buyukada is just where do the locals eat? The seaside fish restaurants are too 
pricey, while even the "budget" places away from the sea are clearly aimed at 
the tourist trade.

We recently found the answer to our question in the form of SofrAda Restoran, 
a homey version of anesnaf lokanta (tradesmen's restaurant), located on a small 
side street near the aromatic lot where the horse carriages are parked while 
their drivers wait for rides.

Run by an islander who clearly knows what she's doing, the restaurant features 
a large daily menu of prepared dishes, freshly made with a loving touch …
