Electra, Hedda, Medea, Mother Courage and now the mother of Jesus himself – 
Fiona Shaw <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/fiona-shaw> has played some of 
theatre’s greatest, and most tragic, female roles. But the Irish actor, born 
into a Catholic family in 1950s County Cork, wasn’t always known for her 
seriousness.

As she wrote recently in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/29/fiona-shaw-electra-northern-ireland-tragedy>
, Fiona made her name as a series of wise-cracking Shakespearean heroines 
during the 80s: “I associated acting with entertainment, with being able to 
turn a line on a sixpence and make people laugh.”


A regular at both the Royal Shakespeare Company 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rsc> and the National Theatre where she 
makes 18th- and 19th-century comedies sizzle again, she also has a surprisingly 
varied screen career, ranging from Three Men and a Little Lady to My Left Foot 
and, of course, her recurring role as Petunia Dursley in the Harry Potter 
franchise.

Currently appearing in Colm Tóibín’s The Testament of Mary at the Barbican – 
Michael Billington gave five stars to her"extraordinary" many-sided performance

Yes, I advise training, you can turn from a stooped library smelling 
tweed-skirt wearing philosophy undergraduate into the hawkish swan that I was 
at 21. And the best piece of advice I've been given is "think on the line" - 
which means don't analyse but allow what you're saying to completely be of you 
and from you. And little lightbulbs will go off in your mind.

I loved Trueblood. Especially as I was rung up in my dressing room and just 
asked: would I like to spend six months in Hollywood. The writers are some of 
the best in the world. And so it was a great privilege to spend the time 
fighting vampires and driving home at dawn next to the Pacific ocean, doolally

Lady Gay was quite hard because I had to laugh so I would practice like mad 
laughing behind the scenes, trying to make myself hysterical so I could surf on 
her laughter as I entered. My entrance in Mother Courage was hard because I had 
to sing coming up from the ground with the band playing underneath me. I could 
barely hear them with the explosions but it felt very exciting. But my most 
difficult entrance was as Medea where I had to walk calmly behind the glass and 
very gently say "Good afternoon, Ladies" when I had just been a screaming 
banshee in the basement. I always felt that the essence of the evening depended 
on how well I did that first line.

I noticed during The Testament of Mary you interacted with a few objects on 
stage that were not directly related to the performance (the pot of honey for 
example)- was this a technique for emotional recall? If so is generally the way 
you approach a role, via personalisation and substitution?

In fact all of the objects in The Testament of Mary are connected to the new 
testament. I used to have milk with the honey but I gave that up. You will 
notice that the objects tend to be domestic but their significance is that they 
are in reply to many Renaissance paintings where you see these items and the 
use of them during the evening slowly builds up the famous banality of torture 
and ordinariness. We use coins, dice, water, cloth, a ladder, a sponge, and 
Jerusalem artichokes as a pun.

Voices change with age. But the pleasure of being an experiences actor is that 
you begin to associate speaking with thinking loudly. If you are concentrated, 
and your imagination is fully engaged with what you are saying, it is 
remarkable how quiet you can be, but how you know not only the listener's ear 
can hear it, but ideally their mind too. I've always been interested in the 
mutual hypnotism of acting. If the actor's hear is racing due to a thought, 
engaged members of the audience's hearts also race.

Hi! For a few months now I'd been thinking of performing richard ii with an 
all female cast and then weirdly, googled to to see if anybody had done it 
before (i wasn't expecting them to) and your production came up? What was it 
like as a woman to perform richard ii? I love reading the play it is my fave 
and I would just LOVE to play and direct a play like richard and I was curious 
as how you found it, interpreting a very kingly role in the male dominated 
world of Richard? I would really have loved to have seen you in it! I was 
gutted I couldn't find any DVDS!

Great minds think alike even if there's 15 years in the interim. There were 
many reasons for playing Richard II and, of course, we had a mainly male cast. 
But Richard is a highly poetical almost musical construction and therefore is 
spared the realism of more robust writing, which we thought allowed access. The 
play is pure poetry, entirely in verse, and so it holds a big idea very well.

Even though you seem to be quite at ease socially, are there times that you

I actually like Aunt Petunia a lot - she's a rather limited person and clearly 
the less glamorous sister. That's never a nice place to be in the family. But 
if you don't like Aunt Petunia you should look up Harry Melling, who played the 
horrible Dudley Dursley - Harry in real life is a tall lissome handsome 
beautiful young man. So don't believe all you see.

Also, I'm curious. In the Barbican

As for my northern accent, I did use it in New York for the voice of the 
evangelist but in my mind was an actor called Stephen Kennedy who would have 
played this man had he appeared in the play.

Fiona,
You played so many different women.
Can you say what's your favourite role up till now?
And is 'the stage' your favourite place?
It seems to me your roles are very often enormously emotional
and "heavy". 
You are so full off passion and your enthusiasm is there every time.
I want to thank you,I think you are amazing.

I would say what I try to do is to keep the heaviness out, and play everyone 
however extreme the story as someone you might know. Our connection to tragedy 
for me is through the humour that everyone uses in life to protect themselves 
from the growling tiger outside.

Have you ever thought of doing some sort of sideline in lecturing/after-dinner 
speaking? You are an incredible performer, but also *such* a talented, 
fascinating and inspirational speaker. Things like NT platforms are lovely, but 
obviously only come around when there’s a play on. The APAP talk you gave in 
New York was wonderful. Or more documentaries/presenting! The British Face was 
fabulous.

I'm thrilled to say that the Rape of Lucretia has been invited to the Deutsche 
Opera in Berlin in November. And it will play again the following summer at 
Glyndebourne. I was very proud of my team on this. Meanwhile I'm planning 
various ones.

I like opera because it's like wrangling with a giant beast all of whose 
tentacles are huge talents so everyone you look – the singers, the orchestra, 
the design – you are being asked to hold and make sense of those elements and 
in the end, like all great theatre, it is the size of the emotional truth at 
the centre of it that's being released. I feel very small like the Wizard of 
Oz, not least at the Metropolitan Opera last year, with a chorus of 90 and 
everyone singing and speaking Russian.

I think Machinal, directed by Stephen Daldry, had much more life in it by the 
time it was discovered. It had to come off at theNational Theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/national-theatre> and there was no theatre 
big enough to welcome it's phenomenal mechanical set. It was a story of a tiny 
person who was inarticulate being overwhelmed by city life and the selfish 
immorality of her boss and the law.

In life, I'm the most unpainseeking person. I have no neurotic interest in 
pain. But all dancers stretch daily in order to realign their thought and their 
feeling. So after lazy bouts of my not doing anything like that, I find that 
during the rehearsal for a play and the immediate preparation beforehand, 
stretching and speaking helps. The lines that are to do with the extreme 
emotion focus themselves rather immediately and it feels truer than inventing 
narratives.

Hello Fiona! Are you spiritual at all? And what is your favourite quote or 
motto to follow? P.S I'm coming to Testament of Mary Thursday evening! Best 
Wishes x

I suppose we are all spiritual: the moment you acknowledge it, a world inside 
your mind, and access it, you are in the territory of something other than the 
physical world. The metaphysical world is where you play with notions of god 
and it's very hard to undo that world if you've been brought up with from 
childhood. The world of morality is connected to this area and none of us are 
free from that.

Forgive me if I go now I have to have lunch with my mother who is seeing the 
show tonight .. and then get to the theatre
Thank you all for these illuminating questions . Some are best left unanswered 
as they might ground the experience for others!
 Best 
 Fiona Shaw
