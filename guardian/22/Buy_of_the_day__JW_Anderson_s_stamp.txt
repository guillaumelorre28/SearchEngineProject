In contrast to big production fashion campaigns, JW Anderson’s for SS16 was a 
lesson in delicate minimalism. Featuring one single postage stamp image, shot 
in a 1960s Nova magazine style by Jamie Hawkesworth (Miu Miu), it existed as a 
simple form in a sea of complicated visual messages. Well now Anderson has hit 
peak “object d’art” and turned the piece into an actual stamp. It’s being sold 
as a set of 10 costing £15 each and is available from itsofficial website
