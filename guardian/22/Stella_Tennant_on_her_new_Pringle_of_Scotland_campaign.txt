Stella Tennant was in town on Sunday to celebrate Pringle of Scotland’s new 
campaign, in which she stars along with actor Luke Treadaway and artist David 
Shrigley. Like a beautiful giraffe with Mitford eyes, wearing argyle skater 
shoes and boyish trousers, we grabbed five minutes with her to talk knitwear, 
Scotland and what she wants from a photographer.

“We were meant to shoot this in the Isle of Skye but I think that would have 
been quite hard. Ive been there and it’s magical but rough terrain. Instead we 
did it in a studio in London. Albert Watson, the photographer, was a pleasure 
to work with. He’s old school and very particular. I like a photographer who 
knows what he wants. There was genuine cross over with the subjects - I know 
David Shrigley through friends in Glasgow, for example - and I grew up in 
Hawick where Pringle was founded. It all felt very cosy. I probably wore 
Pringle when I was younger, bought from local charity shops. I moved back to 
Scotland 12 years ago, from New York and I live in the Borders. I’m used to the 
lack of sunshine now. I occasionally come to London and I’m here to celebrate 
this. I’m not doing anything else. This is my London fashion week.”
