 between his residences while he was at work has resigned from cabinet.

The corrections minister, Steve Herbert, admitted to using his ministerial car 
to ferry his dogs Patch and Ted between his homes some 120km apart.

“I have tendered my resignation to premier [Daniel] Andrews,” Hebert said in a 
statement on Wednesday. “[And] I will not be nominating for, or contesting the 
2018 state election.”

Herbert had his driver transport the dogs  in his parliamentary car from 
Melbourne to the house in Trentham, 97km north-west of Melbourne. Herbert was 
not in the car while the Jack Russell terriers were transported.

Herbert had issued an apology, saying he had come to realise the use of his 
ministerial car to transport the dogs “does not meet community expectations”.

Andrew initially stood by Herbert, saying he would not be sacked and had 
made “an error in judgment”.

The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, had called for Herbert to be sacked.
