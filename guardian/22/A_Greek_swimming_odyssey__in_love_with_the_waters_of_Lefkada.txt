I’m a keen swimmer, but have watched the rising popularity of wild swimming – 
in rivers, lakes and sea – with bemusement, mainly because to me, deep, cold 
water is plain scary. Then I came acrossThe Big Blue 
<http://thebigblueswim.com/>, a holiday firm offering swim trips in Lefkada, 
Greece. Clear,warm blue seas held a different appeal altogether.

So I found myself travelling to the Ionian Sea to see whether I could be 
converted. My fellow 11 swimmers and I were based atIlios Club Hotel & Villas 
<http://iliosclub.com/> in the fishing village of Yemi, and each day, after 
breakfast, we’d meet swim guide Mia on the nearby jetty and she would take us 
out in a rigid inflatable to The Big Blue’s boat, Mowgli, a 15-metre mahogany 
motor yacht.

The group’s ages ranged from 23 to 70, and I don’t think any of us had 
completed the six-week training programme sent to us beforehand, which was good 
news for me. Even so, in the first ride out in Mowgli, there was a lot of talk 
among the guys about “times” and who was going to be fastest. I tried not to 
listen. Having two older brothers has made me competitive, but I didn’t want to 
race around the islands: I wanted to take my time and enjoy my surroundings.

We were split into three groups, by ability, and I found that I enjoyed the 
boat rides almost as much as the swims. Motoring slowly out of the clear waters 
of Vlicho Bay with a backdrop of islands made a welcome change to manic London 
life.

 Dock of the bay … clear water and the Mowgli motor yacht, Lefkada 
Swimming in British lakes and rivers had its heyday in the 1930s, but postwar 
municipal pools and concerns about pollution saw its popularity wane. So why 
has it now become one of the fastest-growing sports in the UK?

Kate Rew <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/series/kate-rew-wild-swim>, 
founder of the Outdoor Swimming Society, says: “Swimming in the wild appeals to 
people because of its simplicity. In our first year, we had 300 members; now, 
10 years on, we have 26,000.”

Lisa Stansbie <http://thebigblueswim.com/team/lisa_stansbie.php>, co-founder 
of The Big Blue, agrees: “I think the notion of reconnecting with the ‘wild’ is 
a great antidote to city dwelling.”

Each day we would chug out to a beautiful island and, in groups, swim around 
the coast or to another island. Mornings usually saw a longer swim – about 3km. 
After that we’d have lunch and a taverna break, before boarding Mowgli for the 
next swim, usually 2km.

I was beginning to understand what the fuss was about. The surroundings were 
gorgeous, and I could see why Lisa and partnerMichael Koumbouzis 
<http://thebigblueswim.com/team/mihalis_koumbouzis.php> had chosen this area. 
“Michael wanted to set something up in his homeland,” Lisa says, “and encourage 
others to enjoy the land and seascapes of Greece.”

 Swimmers aboard the Mowgli 
Lefkada, with its light winds, calm seas, rich sea life and stunning 
coastline, seemed perfect. Among the highlights was a swim to the cave of 
Papanikolis on Meganisi island, said to have been a hideaway for a Greek navy 
submarine during the second world war. We swam right into the cave’s mouth, on 
to a small shingle beach.

Another highlight was a long (5km) swim on the sixth day. We’d been building 
up for this all week and there was a definite air of apprehension as we set off 
for the island of Kastos. We needn’t have worried. Mia recommended a drinks 
break every 25 minutes – which would work out to be about every kilometre. This 
was a great idea, and despite having to tread water while Stavros, my group’s 
guide, threw down bottles of water, juice or mouthwash (to help combat the 
taste of salt water), it did feel like a break.

The coast of Kastos is rugged, its tall white cliffs beautiful to gaze at as 
we swam amid shoals of fish. We spotted a starfish and managed to avoid a 
jellyfish – although one swimmer from one of the other groups didn’t. Almost 
two hours later we reached a deserted bay on the north of the island. Job done!

By the end of the week we’d swum 25km, visited 12 islands and gained a real 
sense of accomplishment. And I’m not terrified of deep water any more.


• Big Blue (thebigblueswim.com <http://thebigblueswim.com/the-big-swim.php>) 
one-week trips to Lefkada cost £760pp, including B&B accommodation and drinks 
and snacks on swims. The final standard swim break of 2016 is from 11-18 Sept.
