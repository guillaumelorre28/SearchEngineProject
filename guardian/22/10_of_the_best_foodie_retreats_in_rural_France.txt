Manoir de Troezel Vras, Brittany

Strawberries, squash, lemon verbena and lettuce come from Françoise Maynier’s 
immaculately kept gardens just inland from Brittany’s Pink Granite Coast. She 
also keeps a couple of donkeys, three cats and six hens who overlook the 
sculptures and ancient rose bushes in the five gardens, separate cottage and 
ponds. The manor has four rooms and an apartment, all done out in Breton 
stripes and nautical chic. The table d’hôtes set dinner, which Françoise 
prepares herself, usually involves fish and seafood, such as thick slabs of 
cod, prawns and crab. As the local fishermen don’t go out on Sundays, a typical 
Monday evening meal might be melon and mint soup, then chicken in cider 
followed by roast peach with gingerbread. Françoise also does an exceptionalfar 
breton, a custard-based sponge cake with prunes.

Chef Jean-Paul Bossée and his wife Isabelle opened their maison d’hôtes in 
Willgottheim, 20km north-east of Strasbourg, in 2010 – having already created a 
restaurant on their ground floor. In fine weather, guests eat outside in an 
open-sided, beamed barn, and in winter, they sit in a dining room in front of 
an open fire. Isabelle describes her husband’s creations as “refined, 
authentic, simple haute cuisine”. All products are sourced the local 
Kochersberg region, and emerge from the kitchen with inventive élan: blue ling 
and smoked salmon with Elodie potatoes, herbs and horseradish cream to start, 
followed by veal filet mignon withpleurotes (oyster mushrooms) d’Alsace, and 
for dessert, chocolate mousse or peach melba “revisited”. Jean-Paul even makes
spätzles (egg noodles) for the children’s menu.

 The vaulted dining room at Le Manoir de la Rivière 
Isabelle and Gérard Leharivel have been running their guesthouse in Calvados 
for 32 years. Isabelle buys fish direct from the boats as they arrive at 
Grandcamp port, while Gérard tends his vegetable garden and discusses Brexit 
with British guests over breakfast. On the table is homemade bread, fruit from 
their orchard and rhubarb and blackcurrant compote. Dinner, served in the 
vaulted medieval dining room, might be a fish stew, ham cooked in cider, orange 
segments in fennel and a splash of the local Calvados apple brandy in the 
sauce. Isabelle reserves herandouilles (chitterlings sausage) for French 
clients: “The English aren’t so keen!” The house has three bedrooms and two 
gîtes for rent near where William the Conqueror set sail.

 The kitchen garden 
Owner Stéphane Vandeville talks lovingly about what he has prepared for 
tonight’s meal: a tomato confit with crumble made from pine nuts, rosemary, 
parmesan and local goat’s cheese, followed by a chicken soufflé, cheeseboard 
and poached peach with lemon verbena and sherbet. His five-bedroom guesthouse 
is majestic but it’s the garden with its 88 wood-framed squares of organic 
fruits and vegetables that is the most inspiring feature. Each 1.2-metre square 
is filled with a mix of herbs and rare-variety vegetables, “The squares are 
that size so you can reach the middle without stepping on the soil,” says 
Stéphane. “We have nine varieties in each square and use rotation techniques to 
develop healthy produce.” The fruits of that knowledge – tomatoes planted with 
basil to protect them from insects – arrive on the plates that evening.

While St Victor is the perfect base for visiting the chateaux of the Loire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/21/loire-valley-france-where-stay-eat-drink>
, the prospect of a riverside picnic under the 400-year-old oak tree makes it 
hard to leave the manor’s garden. The area is known for its fish and fruit, and 
both are combined to create intriguing dishes. If you take one of the gîtes, 
owner Marie Grandclément prepares a welcome basket of local produce including 
potato cakes, smoked fish, and macaroons. Guests can sip rosé from Anjou and 
the best of nearby Sancerre, Pouilly and Reuilly while gazing out across the 
grounds, stroll alongside the Anglin river or spend the afternoon playing the 
grand piano in the library. Marie bought the manor house more than 30 years ago 
after falling in love with it and has restored it gradually to ivy-clad, 
slate-roofed and turreted splendour.

Having run a veggie restaurant in Penarth, Wales, for eight years, David and 
Lorraine Tomlinson moved their family to the hamlet of Chambon, in 
Poitou-Charentes, in 2003 and converted a rambling old farmhouse into one of 
France’s few vegetarian guesthouses. The cowsheds are now two apartments. “The 
French see us as something different, although they tend to be vegetarian for 
health rather than environmental reasons,” says David, who prepares the food 
and runs the cooking school. The basics – courgettes, potatoes, garlic and 
onions – come from their garden, the rest comes from La Rochelle’s organic 
shops and a nearby farmers’ cooperative. A typical meal might include ginger 
squash salad with steamed bok choi, edamame beans, crispy weed, wonton and 
orange soy dressing followed by carrot and feta rösti stacks, poached egg and 
tarragon hollandaise and, to finish, a custard tart with baked cognac figs. 
David also caters for vegans and those on raw-food diets.

Ideally placed for a visit to the antiques markets of L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue and 
the “perched villages” of the Luberon, Nina and Thierry Crovara’s Provencalmas 
is the epitome of rural Provence. The couple met at hotel school in Switzerland 
and Thierry later trained under Anton Mosimann at the Dorchester in London. The 
meals Thierry cooks depend on what catches his eye at the market each day. 
Often appearing in pink braces over a pink shirt, he chats to guests before 
disappearing into the kitchen to prepare dishes such as red snapper and basil, 
Mediterranean meatballs, fried courgette flowers, rabbit with garlic and thyme 
or sea bass with ratatouille. Their cat, Rokey, spends most of the day sunning 
himself on the terrace, where two huge trees acts as giant parasols for outdoor 
meals. The mas is in the heart of peach, melon and honey country, so buffet 
breakfasts are delicious and there is always a fridge full of drinks beside the 
pool. The couple also run cooking courses in March and October.

rolling green Basque Country really does live up to its pastoral name, with 
seats covered in sheepskin, a leg of lamb slow-roasting in front of the fire 
and sheep’s cheese on the menu. Hosts Sabine and Didier Meyer’s other gourmet 
specialities include beef rib with hot béarnaise sauce, cream of cèpe soup, 
wild boar, venison, wood pigeon and home-cured ham. He uses the local red-hot 
Espelette peppers to spice up his gazpacho and pork terrine, as well aspipérade 
(spicy scrambled eggs and thickgarbure (cabbage soup). Didier describes his 
cuisine as “hearty, authentic, countryside cooking” with large joints and big

and a salt-water pool for early-evening dips.

Jean-Pierre Caggini-Fournau is Basque and looks after the main courses while 
Tania – who is Italian – makes the ice-creams, sorbets and desserts. In a 
region known for its foie gras, duck and sweet wines, the couple always serve a 
typical Périgord meal for guests on their first night. “If they stay longer, we 
branch out a bit,” says Jean-Pierre. Foie gras with mango in a bittersweet 
sauce is followed by Dordogne duckling or guinea fowl and brie with truffles. 
Jean-Pierre offers classes in preparingfoie gras orenchaud (pork confit), and 
fishing trips, while painter Tania hosts exhibitions and art workshops. Chiara, 
their eight-year-old dog, accompanies guests on truffle hunting weekends and 
has already sniffed out seven kilos of truffles this year. Rooms in the 
thick-walled, 18th-century manor are decorated in a “countryside baroque” style 
and each has a private terrace – or leads directly into the garden. Breakfast 
jams and juices are made with fruit from the property’s orchard.
