Non-believers in the padded jacket, this season’s coat of coats, should look 
to Topshop’s creative director, Kate Phelan, for help if they’re still on the 
fence over whether to get one. It represents “a new sense of heightened reality 
happening in fashion – an evolution from normcore”, she said at the shows. The 
high-low of coats, a mix of basic and glamour and symbolic of the way fashion 
has embraced practicality (see sportswear, the rise of flats and luxe trainers).
As reported here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/26/dont-wait-for-winter-padded-jacket-now-looks-for-autumn>
, padded coats, successors to the original Puffa jacket, are this season’s 
must-have. And why not? Practical. Waterproof, sometimes, and no longer the 
preserve of Millets (although you could do worse than getting something serious 
from North Face). From Balenciaga to Raf Simons, it is the coat to wear this 
season. Here are four types to find which one works for you.

 Balenciaga’s off-the-shoulder padded jacket. 
The faux-fur couture coat

Half the trick is in the styling with this one. Off-the-shoulder, like you 
would with a fur coat, and hung over your arms. SeeBalenciaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga> under the tenure of Demna 
Gavsalia, whose red, cropped jacket was the breakout star of the autumn 
catwalks. Topshop’s version, which comes ready-off-shoulder, feels like a mite 
too committed (draping should only be an option) but it’s cheap and works with 
anything high-necked. View it as winter’s answer to the Bardot top.

The norms’ padded coat

AKA the insider’s choice. The fashion crowd are fans of Moncler jackets in the 
New York blizzards at the January shows, and while the tone feels a little 
exchange-student, if you lose the belted waist it automatically shifts it into 
grownup territory. The key here is pops of colour at either end (hair and boot, 
frayed hem and lipstick), which suggest there is something more interesting 
below. There are also, generally, cheaper versions floating around at Millets, 
Blacks and Uniqlo, ideal if your mind isn’t yet made up.

The over-oversized coat

Oversized is another major trend this season. Too long sleeves. Too long hems. 
XXL when you’re not. The good news is that this isn’t exclusive to Vetements, 
who coined the concept for the millennial age. Raf Simons oversized his entire 
menswear collection and Rihanna woreit

. Some (The Mail) argued that she went for something this big in summer as a 
way ofself-protection

 (she had been previously booed for lip-syncing. They suggested her coat was a 
PR wall).

The duvet

An actual eiderdown appeared at the Alexander McQueen show. Floral, cream, 
embroidered, the model wrapped it round her shoulders and walked down the 
catwalk like she had been woken up by a fire alarm. Bit much, perhaps: Stella 
McCartney’s caramel version which was more duvet-inspired than anything else. 
These are oversized, cocooned, but are more about comfort than comedy. Puffa 
has some which are cropped and open in weird places (under the arm) but 
affordable and nicelyNasa-ish
