Actually the thing I'm interested in is teaching. Both my parents are teachers 
of some sort and I think it's really important that young actors have somebody 
to talk to who's in the business. I've done a bit of work with young actors 
through a charity and I'm very proud of all that they've achieved. There's a 
lot of nonsense spoken about the industry so it's nice to be able to talk about 
that and dispel some of the nonsense. Actually I get as much out of it as they 
do.

Emperor and Galilean at the National Theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre>. It was a huge part in a play that 
lasted nearly four hours. It was physically and mentally draining and there 
weren't many gags in it. But I met incredible people and friends for life in 
it. And I'm grateful for it even though I had to turn up for the Saturday 
matinee at 10.30am. I was like Bambi by the end of it.

Laughing, people being kind and tolerant, non judgemental. People who listen. 
Listening to people. Eating. Drinking. Kissing. The usual stuff. Life, I think, 
should be as simple as possible.

No, the only thing I regret is doing too much talking about the work, rather 
than just doing the work. I love meeting the fans and the audiences but I do 
find it difficult doing interviews some times. But there's a certain degree of 
choice that an actor has when it comes to publicity and that's a comforting 
thought. I don't think the most successful actors are necessarily the most 
famous actors.

Given that some of your more well known characters have been villains, are you 
ever concerned about being type cast as ‘the baddie’?

That's a good question. I've played a lot of not necessarily villains, but 
antagonists lately. So I really have made a conscious effort to do more diverse 
work of late because the pleasure of acting for me is to do lots of varying 
work. I wouldn't want the projects that make the most money to be the ones that 
define me. But every actor has different moments in his career. When I first 
started out I really wanted to play a baddie because I have a sweet little 
innocent face (!) but people wouldn't see me as that. And now my challenge is 
the opposite. It's all fun, anyway.

I don't have a favourite role, but I'll name some of them. Alex in Sea Wall. 
Gethin in Pride. Casimir in Aristocrats. I've just done a movie called Handsome 
Devil in Dublin. It's a new comedy by John Butler, who I worked with on the 
Stag. He's a great friend and a great writer. And I love doing comedy and 
improvisation. It's a gorgeous film and I'm very excited about that. I'm also 
enjoying the genesis of this new character in The Dazzle. I feel very lucky to 
have played lots of really really different parts.

Actually the thing I'm interested in is teaching. Both my parents are teachers 
of some sort and I think it's really important that young actors have somebody 
to talk to who's in the business. I've done a bit of work with young actors 
through a charity and I'm very proud of all that they've achieved. There's a 
lot of nonsense spoken about the industry so it's nice to be able to talk about 
that and dispel some of the nonsense. Actually I get as much out of it as they 
do.

Emperor and Galilean at the National Theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre>. It was a huge part in a play that 
lasted nearly four hours. It was physically and mentally draining and there 
weren't many gags in it. But I met incredible people and friends for life in 
it. And I'm grateful for it even though I had to turn up for the Saturday 
matinee at 10.30am. I was like Bambi by the end of it.

Laughing, people being kind and tolerant, non judgemental. People who listen. 
Listening to people. Eating. Drinking. Kissing. The usual stuff. Life, I think, 
should be as simple as possible.

No, the only thing I regret is doing too much talking about the work, rather 
than just doing the work. I love meeting the fans and the audiences but I do 
find it difficult doing interviews some times. But there's a certain degree of 
choice that an actor has when it comes to publicity and that's a comforting 
thought. I don't think the most successful actors are necessarily the most 
famous actors.

Given that some of your more well known characters have been villains, are you 
ever concerned about being type cast as ‘the baddie’?

That's a good question. I've played a lot of not necessarily villains, but 
antagonists lately. So I really have made a conscious effort to do more diverse 
work of late because the pleasure of acting for me is to do lots of varying 
work. I wouldn't want the projects that make the most money to be the ones that 
define me. But every actor has different moments in his career. When I first 
started out I really wanted to play a baddie because I have a sweet little 
innocent face (!) but people wouldn't see me as that. And now my challenge is 
the opposite. It's all fun, anyway.

I don't have a favourite role, but I'll name some of them. Alex in Sea Wall. 
Gethin in Pride. Casimir in Aristocrats. I've just done a movie called Handsome 
Devil in Dublin. It's a new comedy by John Butler, who I worked with on the 
Stag. He's a great friend and a great writer. And I love doing comedy and 
improvisation. It's a gorgeous film and I'm very excited about that. I'm also 
enjoying the genesis of this new character in The Dazzle. I feel very lucky to 
have played lots of really really different parts.
