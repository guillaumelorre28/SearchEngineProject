Fremantle council has decided to move its traditional Australia Day events to 
28 January because of cultural sensitivities.

“We thought it was time to acknowledge it wasn’t a day of celebration for 
everybody and it was an opportunity for us to come up with a different format 
on a different day that could be truly inclusive,” mayor Brad Pettitttold the 
West Australian

 on Friday.

Pettitt said the council said it had heard “loud and clear” from local 
Aboriginal elders that it wasn’t a day to celebrate.

But former West Australian of the Year Robert Isaacs told the paper he had not 
heard of any complaints from his Aboriginal community.

“It’s not in line with community attitudes,” he said. “I strongly condemn them 
for this whole thing ... Australia Day isAustralia Day

In August the council voted to cancel its traditional fireworks display

 on 26 January.

The council will hold citizenship ceremonies at the One Day in Fremantle 
event, two days after the rest of the country.

Pettitt said the council had no wish to interfere with other celebrations on 
26 January

“We were never trying to say to people they couldn’t do anything or shouldn’t 
do anything on Australia Day,” he said.

“That’s for other people to judge. We’re simply offering what I think is a 
really good alternative.”
