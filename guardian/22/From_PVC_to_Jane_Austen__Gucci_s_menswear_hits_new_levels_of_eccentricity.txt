It might have been Gucci’s last ever dedicated menswear show, but it was 
business as usual on the Milan catwalk for the much lauded creative director, 
Alessandro Michele. As of September, theGucci 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> menswear collection will be shown 
alongside the brand’s womenswear on one catwalk, but anyone expecting a change 
in direction to mark the occasion was wrong. This show maintained the eclectic 
Michele theme – or, as he would have it backstage, it continued to be in his 
language.

The Gucci language is easy to distinguish, but it is almost impossible to 
decipher the meaning within. This conundrum is made all the more difficult by 
the designer’s capacity to enthuse without contextualising. Backstage between 
photographs with Jared Leto and superfan bloggers, the designer explained that 
this collection was very much about travel. Although he hates travel. Which, it 
seemed at least, meant that this was about mind-travel – or dreams. Or 
something. A quote from TS Eliot on the show notes almost shed more light: “We 
shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to 
arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.”

Deciphering literature and language is all very well, but looking at the Gucci 
clothes is too much of a visual feast to try too hard at that. Michele’s design 
eccentricity is off the scale. Just 18 months ago, the fashion industry 
applauded his debut collection, which put gender fluidity, and men in pussy-bow 
blouses, at the heart of the fashion conversation. How tame that now seems, 
when this show contains such wild wardrobe diversity as shoes in the shape of 
fish, PVC sou’westers, lace tights worn underneath knee socks, decorative 
wallpaper and style references ranging from Donald Duck and Jane Austen to the 
15th-century princes in the tower.

From Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band back to Marco Polo, pea-green frock 
coats to studded jelly shoes, this was a psychedelic dream unfettered by 
anything as pragmatic as the bottom line. Nor need it be. The warm hug between 
Gucci’s CEO, Marco Bizzarri, and the bejewelled Michele after the show said it 
all. Team Gucci are happy. Sales are up 11.5%, the forecasts are ambitious, the 
plan is working. Those looking to see how Michele and Bizzarri plan to serve 
their customers who want more formal clothes, beyond the scope of Donald Duck 
and choral-scholar chic, will have to wait a while longer to find out.
