Kilic Ali Pasa Hamami
The stunning 1580s hamam by Mimar Sinan, architect to Suleiman the 
Magnificent, has been raised from dereliction. Men and women, instead of having 
different areas, have different visiting times, which has helped to preserve 
the integrity of the building. After your cleansing and revitalising session, 
you emerge renewed into the beautiful public space, to drink sherbet, or apple 
tea.
• From £28 a session, women 8am-4pm, men 4.30pm-11.30pm, +90 212 393 8001, 
kilicalipasahamami.com <http://kilicalipasahamami.com/reservation-form/>

Chora church
Although Istanbul is laden with Byzantine monuments, this small church in the 
Fatih district is the most exquisite, with its mosaics and frescoes depicting 
the lives of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The church has been rebuilt many times 
and restoration is still under way. The frescoes date from the final period of 
Byzantine painting, in the 14th century.
• Open daily 9am-5pm (7pm in summer), £4pp, choramuseum.com <http:>

Vintage shopping in Çukurcuma
The winding streets of Çukurcuma, in the European Quarter – particularly Faik 
Paşa and Çukurcuma Caddesi – are also known asyabancı köy (foreigner village), 
because they are beloved of fashionable foreigners. (Çukurcuma is also the home 
ofThe Museum of Innocence <http://www.masumiyetmuzesi.org/?Language=ENG>, based 
on Nobel prize-winner Orhan Pamuk’s 2008novel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/10/museum-innocence-orhan-pamuk>.) 
Bijou stores and antiques shops sell everything from old postcards to antique 
glasses.

SALT Galata
Housed in the Ottoman Bank (built in 1892), in the heart of the cultural 
quarter of Galata, the not-for-profit SALT Galata is a contemporary art 
gallery, workshop space and location for great talks, screenings and 
programmes. There are also SALT galleries in Beyoğlu and Ankara.

 Naif, Istanbul 
With tables and chairs spilling out on to the street and a Mediterranean vibe, 
Naif is a cosy, whitewashed restaurant brightened with colourful ceramics and 
flowers. The food is light-touch, mainly organic and great for sharing, from 
tabbouleh with pomegranate sauce tokeskek – wheat cooked with lamb and 
chickpeas in spicy sauce (about £4).

imaginable Istanbulite from every walk of life, here to eat chocolate, 
chestnut, hazelnut or orange baklava, traditional flan or Turkish delight. The 
square baklava with pistachios, made with 30 layers of pastry, is particularly 
recommended.

wall cafeev yemekleri – home cooking. It’s like a Turkish Ottolenghi 
<http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/>: fresh, top-class ingredients prepared to a 
daily-changing menu, including smoked meats, cheeses, pies and stuffed vines.

Where to drink

Ferahfeza 
Ferahfeza colonises the vast top floor of a modern block in Karaköy, which 
enjoys views of theGalata Tower <http://www.galatatower.net/> out the back and 
of theSultanahmet district <http://www.bluemosque.co/> at the front. It’s an 
upmarket Mediterranean seafood restaurant, but also an excellent place for a 
civilised cocktail, best enjoyed from the small, Galata-facing terrace.

Gaspar 
Münferit’s little sister livens up a quiet backstreet in Karaköy. Its moody, 
dark interiors, created by layered panels of wood, are the work of Istanbul 
design studio Autoban. Two floors of a lounge bar-cum-restaurant-cum-club have 
been carved out of a handsome neo-classical building, which was once a printing 
press. House music predominates.

Münferit 
The modern take on the meyhane – the traditional Turkish tavern, scene of 
wild, raki-fuelled dancing and music – has caught on in recent years. Münferit 
is the most famous, though it’s equally renowned for its meze. It comes into 
its exuberant own after dinner, when the music ramps up (though you can still 
order black couscous with calamari).

There are countless clubs and bars along the Bosphorus. Among the glitziest – 
and worth a drink for the skyline views, even if the showy side of Istanbul is 
not your bag – is this celebrity haunt, with several bars, restaurants and 
dance floors.
