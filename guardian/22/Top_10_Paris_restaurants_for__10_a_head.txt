‘No kebabs, no sandwiches - that’s our rule. Apart from that, if it’s good 
we’ll consider it.” Romain Passelande and Thomas Le Gourrierec are talking 
about their website,Les Petites Tables <https://www.lespetitestables.com/>, a 
guide to finding a good lunch (and sometimes dinner) in Paris for under €10. At 
one time, says Romain, you’d look to a brasserie for good basic food; now, 
brasseries just do rubbishy croque-monsieurs and frozen stuff. But as their 
quality declined, other places, from bistronomie joints to veggie cafes and 
ethnic restaurants, filled the gap.

 Les Petites Tables founders Romain Passelande and Thomas Le Gourrierec 
Tracking them down requires inside knowledge, though, which is why in early 
2015 Romain left his ad agency job and set up the site with food critic Thomas. 
It has proved massively popular, attracting over 700,000 unique users – and not 
just among their target 25-35 age group. Groups of pensioners now do the rounds 
of Les Petites Tables restaurants, and the pair had a heartwarming letter from 
a train driver on the Métro who said he and his wife had stopped eating out - 
couldn’t afford it - but subscribed to their weekly newsletter and are going 
out again. Food bloggers as marriage savers – whatever next?

Thomas and Romain are experimenting with a few higher-end meals – always with 
the emphasis on value, such as four courses of fancier food for €23 – and 
events with DJs and cheffy finger food, but are wary of moving too far from 
their original premise.

It’s August when I meet Romain and Thomas at Le Bichat (see below), a 
family-run organiccantine near Canal Saint Martin, and Paris is quiet, with 
most of its inhabitants decamped to the Med or Brittany. Picking 10 from their 
database of 70-plus restaurants is probably as hard for these two as choosing a 
favourite child, but here is their selection of “little tables”.

Spicy rice and veg, 10th arrondissement

Smelling of spices and stock, Le Bichat is a low-key cafe opened last year by 
actor and activistAugustin Legrand <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1109880/> and 
run by his family. There are tempting salads and soups, but the big idea here 
is thebol (from €8), a bowl of seasoned rice served with generous helpings of 
organic veg sourced from small farms within 100km, plus a choice of topping – 
vegan, egg, fish, pork or chicken. Bottles of house tamarind or ginger dressing 
are passed between the tables. Wash it all down with unsweetened homemade 
ginger lemonade (€2), or drink water and save the euros for homemade cake or 
chocolate pudding. There’s also organic wine (from €3 a glass).

Celebrity chef and author Pierre Sang, known for Asian-accented haute cuisine 
(menus from €35), makes a meal to compete with McDonald’s on price. Each 
lunchtime, Monday-Thursday, he offers 40 portions of bibimbap, the national 
dish of his native South Korea, for €7 a pop. A raw egg tops a spicy bowl of 
(depending on the day) three kinds of rice, tender beef or salmon, baby 
carrots, mushrooms, kimchi, artichokes and tiny meat or fish dumplings, plus 
fiery chilli sauce. Get there early (between noon and 12.30pm, otherwise it’s 
all gone) and enjoy a cheap lunch with the sleek surroundings and charming 
service you’d get at, well, five times the cost.

The chi-chi Saint-Germain district is good for celeb spotting but bad for 
bagging a cheap meal, except atLe Petit Olivier, where owner Laurent presides 
in shorts and T-shirt. There’s tap water in old whisky bottles, offbeat art on 
distressed walls and a €10 menu (lunch and dinner) comprising a plat du jour 
(choice of three) and dessert. The plat might be cod with rouille, rice and 
bouillabaisse sauce, or roast pork on herby pasta. Afterwards, help yourself 
from five shelves of homemade desserts:oeufs à la neige (meringue on creme 
anglaise) with fruit, tiramisu, crumble or chocolate mousse.

La Péniche Antipode is a big barge, berthed in the Bassin. Owned by the 
Abricadabra theatre company, it is a venue for plays, comedy and live music, 
but there’s cooking talent on display, too, made with artisanal and fairly 
traded ingredients. A satisfying meal of homemade soup, then something 
delicious on toast (spinach with chickpeas, garlic and paprika, say, or goat’s 
cheese with artichokes, pine nuts, honey and coriander) costs just €7. Add a 
salad for €2 or, still within the €10 limit, dessert for €3. The tables are on 
deck, with separate smoking area; covers and heaters keep it toasty.

Rue Sainte-Anne, near the Palais Royal, is Paris’s Little Tokyo, but just off 
it isAce Bento, a Korean interloper. Lining up at the counter, diners choose 
five tempting side/appetiser dishes from an array that includes sautéed garlic 
stalks, marinated papaya, seaweed, potato salad, lotus root or peanuts in soy 
sauce – and add a main such as crispy chicken, breaded fish or prawn fritters. 
The staff dollop on a generous portion of steamed rice, add a cup of miso soup 
and a fruit salad for dessert, and send you on your way – to a bench at a plain 
blond-wood table – happy and, at lunchtime at least, just €10 poorer.

At Nossa, a Portuguese chicken roastery near the Sorbonne, the skin of grilled 
spatchcocked birds is as crisp as, well, a crisp, the flesh tasty and yielding, 
and sauces come in whisky, curry or “secret recipe” varieties. There are chips 
if you must, but garlicky baby potatoes, rice, green beans or salad make better 
companions. At weekday lunchtimes, €10 buys a quarter of a chicken and a side 
dish, all served in a little wooden crate, plus either a starter, drink (wine 
or beer) or apastel de nata (custard tart) for dessert. There are little green 
tables with folding chairs on the pavement outside, for sunny days.

Shiny metal tables at Street Bangkok, crammed together beneath walls decorated 
with Thai street art, already evoke steamy nights on Bangkok’s Yaowarat Road… 
and then you taste the food. Chef Ja, formerly of theMandarin Oriental 
<http://www.mandarinoriental.com/bangkok/> in the Thai capital, opened this 
place barely a year ago and is particularly hot (in more than one sense) on 
spankingly fresh salads. Green papaya, beef, pork sausage and crispy rice 
versions, served in cardboard trays, are liberally strewn with equally perky 
mint, Thai basil and coriander. Three salads with rice and a soft drink cost 
€10 at lunchtime (drink costs extra at night). Even the muzak is specially 
mixed by Thai DJs.

A million miles from the average creperie, La Pointe du Grouin is an 
industrial-chic Breton bistro near Gare du Nord. It requires diners to pay in 
its own currency, the “grouin” – changing euros (one for one) at a machine on 
the wall – which is a bit of a faff, but the friendly staff and loud, crazy 
atmosphere compensate. Specialities include breaded pig snout and sausage 
galette, but 10 grouins are well spent on a starter of whole artichoke with 
vinaigrette, then abara bihan: this slightly breaks the no-sandwich rule, being 
a home-baked roll, but it’s filled with tasty cured herring, creme fraiche, 
tapenade and salad. That leaves four grouins for a slice of cinnamon-scented 
apple tart. Ouf!

Paris’s Asian arrondissement is home to Le Vin qui Danse, a very 
French-feeling bar/restaurant, with carefully chosen wines and a great-value 
€10 starter-and-main-course offer lunchtime and evening. The building is an old 
convent, with beams and exposed stone, and young owners Tony and Lucie source 
ingredients daily from the huge Rungis market a few kilometres away. A recent 
starter of lightly cooked salmon with sesame and tomato coulis came on a rather 
cliched slate, but was followed by gorgeous ravioli in creamy rocket pesto. Big 
eaters may find portions on the light side, except on Wednesdays, when they do 
their special burger, with the bun replaced by a pair of potato galettes.
