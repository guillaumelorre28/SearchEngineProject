 above all else, the arrival of this ambitious, slow-burn drama was a

, adapting the loosely autobiographical play by Tarell Alvin McCraney, avoids 
drowning the deprived Miami setting in grimy stereotypes and dazzles viewers 
with unconventional, often poetic stylistic choices that never distract from 
the heartfelt narrative and flawless ensemble cast.

Naturalistic performances by newcomer Trevante Rhodes, along with the House of 
Cards and Luke Cage breakout Mahershala Ali and 007 alumni Naomie Harris were

It might initially be remembered for its groundbreaking diversity, but it is 
Moonlight’s heart-swelling humanity that lingers. It’s a film that gently 
argues for empathy, compassion, love and acceptance – a message that affects us 
all, regardless of sexuality or race. No other film in 2016 understood people 
quite as much asMoonlight <https://www.theguardian.com/film/moonlight> did.
