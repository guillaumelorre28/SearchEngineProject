Vanoise national park, Rhône-Alpes

The first (1963) and largest of France’s mainland national parks, the Vanoise 
is in the French Alps, becoming the Gran Paradiso national park once it’s over 
the Italian border. Hundreds of trails crisscross the mountainsides where 
semi-tame marmots come up for a sniff of your picnic and where edelweiss pokes 
out among the bluey trumpets ofgentiana acaulis on the slopes. Lynx, wolves, 
chamois and ibex descend once the ice has melted in the spring. Surrounded by 
prestigious ski-resorts,Courchevel

 andVal-d’Isère 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/feb/13/france-val-disere-ski-tips-locals>
 the park offers a grand spectacle of glaciers and mountain lakes, perfect for 
mountain biking and trekking in the summer and cross-country skiing in the 
winter.

Imagine something the size of a pot of jam, covered in dark brown fur with 
webbed rear feet and a long nose. Unfortunately, the Pyrenean desman only come 
out at night to feed on river shellfish and insects, but there are other, 
easier to spot, rare animals in this national park. Pyrenean frogs, mink, even 
bears inhabit the landscape. Golden eagles and bearded vultures soar above the

Two of the highlights of the Mercantour are manmade: the bestiary-inspired 
frescoes of the local 15th-century chapels are only slightly less terrifying 
than the 36,000 prehistoric carvings in the park’sVallée des Merveilles 
<http://www.tendemerveilles.com/>. Mercantour has a central, heavily protected 
core of 685 sq km where visitors are only allowed to walk and a bigger, 
peripheral area of 28 mountain villages, where it is possible to go biking and 
hang-gliding. Alpine rock formations and a Mediterranean climate have combined 
to produce impressive gorges as well as being home to wild boar, rock 
ptarmigans, nutcracker birds and the recently reintroducedbearded vulture

The Calanques, south-east of Marseille, only became a national park in 2012 
and just a sixth of its total surface is on land, the majority being a 
protected marine area. The clifftop walks towards the calanques (coves) of 
Sormiou and Morgiou are exhilarating as long as you haven’t drunk too much 
pastis. Many of the calanques are only accessible by boat. Alternating 
limestone and sandstone give a strange cragginess to the coast which houses 
leaf-toed geckos, ocellated lizards and 13 species of bat. Out to sea, 
bottlenose dolphins, loggerhead sea turtles and fin whales can be seen in the 
waters off Cassis.

In the summer Brittany’s only regional natural park is a bustle of 
day-trippers, crabbers and seaweed gatherers. Moors, marshes, granite tors and 
three tiny islands are included in the park, where rocky outcrops, mudflats and 
reed beds provide excellent birdwatching. The islands are part of a Unesco 
biosphere reserve but can be reached by ferry in the intriguingly-named Baie du 
Stiff. The Crozon peninsula, looking like a dragon’s head thrusting into the 
sea, is perfect for a windy walk and has a spectacular megalithic site of 
standing stones at its end, the 87 menhirs of theLagatjar alignment 
<http://www.crozon-bretagne.com/tourisme/decouverte/camaret/alignements-lagatjar.php>

A hundred years before it was declared a national park, Robert Louis Stevenson 
passed through this often-forbidding landscape on his donkey, Modestine. His 
route is now known as the Stevenson Trail (officially theGrande Randonnée 70 
<http://www.gr70-stevenson.com/>), though mountain bikes have replaced donkeys 
as the most popular form of transport. With chestnut forests, fields of 
boulders and rugged paths, the park has an unpredictable, almost chaotic feel, 
a sense heightened by large numbers of sheep and cattle. The Cévennes was the 
centre of the Camisard revolts at the start of the 18th century where a lot of 
blood was spilled – Stevenson felt the emotion in the landscape as he tried to 
make sense of the Protestant uprising. Head to Florac for thepark information
