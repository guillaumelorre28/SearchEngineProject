This season on Marc Jacobs’s catwalk, models’ hair was soaked with product and 
fastened messily with mismatched clips. Somewhere between “No time to dry my 
hair, I was meant to be at that meeting five minutes ago – OK now it’s six” and 
“We haven’t had hot water for a week, screw it, I’ll make a feature of the 
filth”, this could be the hairdo of the summer. Drenched in serum or lightly 
mussed with wax: a bit of texture hides a multitude of sins.
