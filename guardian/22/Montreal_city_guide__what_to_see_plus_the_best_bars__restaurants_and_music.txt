Montreal doubled for Brooklyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/brooklyn-observer-film-review-saoirse-ronan>
 in John Crowley’s eponymous 2015 film, has been dubbedthe next Seattle 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/01/09/m-for-montreal-2012_n_2442442.html>, 
and last year became the new “city that never sleeps” when Mayor Denis Coderre 
extended retail opening hours in the downtown district to 24 hours a day, 365 
days a year.

Not that high living is anything new for the city on an island in the St 
Lawrence river. During prohibition, Montreal (a convenient train ride from New 
York) was known as the place where the drink flows and anything goes, and it 
has been living up to that reputation ever since. It has more than 100 
festivals through the summer – many of them free – and chic new hotels such as 
theALT Hotel <http://www.althotels.com/en/montreal/> (doubles from £100 room 
only) and downtownRenaissance 
<http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/yulmd-renaissance-montreal-downtown-hotel/>
 (doubles from £155 room only). Add in two new low-cost flights from London 
Gatwick –WestJet <http://www.westjet.com/> launched two weeks ago (from £145 
one-way) andWow Air  <http://wowair.com/> launches this week (from £99 one-way) 
– and Montreal may soon become the latest North American city break.

 The chic new Alt Hotel 
I didn’t have to look far to discover Montreal’s party spirit. Old Montreal, 
the city’s historic district, is where most tourists end up. It has goodmuseums 
<http://museesmontreal.org/en>, the cobblestoned, 17th-century Rue St-Paul and 
the impressive 200-year-old Notre Dame basilica (seefitzandfollwell.co 
<http://fitzandfollwell.co/> for guided tours of Old Montreal from £41pp). 
Across the harbour, the Biodome (£10.50 adult, £5.40 child) houses an excellent 
recreation of the four major ecosystems of the Americas: from the rainforest of 
the south to the polar tips of the north.

The Latin Quarter has good restaurants and fun bars, such as the 1920s-style 
speakeasyEn Cachette <http://www.encachette.ca/final/>. Venues such as La Sala 
Rossa <http://lasalarosa.com/> and the Fairmount Theatre 
<http://theatrefairmount.ca/> host live music every night of the week. And for 
outdoor fun, there are 217 miles of cycle paths, hundreds of parks (including 
Mount Royal, with views across the city), the nine-mile Lachine Canal for 
kayaking and canoeing, and one of the world’s best standing river waves – 
surfers can ride this continuous wave on the St Lawrence river all day, without 
moving an inch.

All of which is great, but it’s not where the real action is. The new spirit 
of Montreal lies on the periphery, in former industrial districts such as Mile 
End, Saint-Henri and Little Burgundy, where vibrant artist communities are 
shooting up like flowers from the pavement.

 Alternative tours by Spade & Palacio 
To explore them, I took a different kind of tour. Rather than traditional 
sights and histories, Danny Pavlopoulos, co-founder of Spade & Palacio, offers 
a look around his home turf, the Plateau district, just north of downtown (
spadeandpalacio.com <http://spadeandpalacio.com/>, from £47pp including food 
and drink tastings). We had pastries in his localCafé Le Dépanneur 
<http://www.ledepanneurcafe.com/> (206 Rue Bernard Ouest), which is also 
Montreal band Arcade Fire’s coffee-stop of choice. We swung by his favourite 
brewpub, the Dieu du Ciel for a glass of Péché Mortel (deadly sin), a thick 
coffee-infused stout (my favourite, though, was the very hoppy Babylone IPA at 
Montreal’s first microbrewery,Le Cheval Blanc <http://lechevalblanc.ca/>) and 
tried the unofficial favourite food of Quebec province,poutine. This is cheesy 
chips and gravy, but somehow infinitely more delicious:Patati Patata 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Patati-Patata/152005481506456> (4177 Boulevard 
Saint-Laurent) is the locals’ favourite.

Danny also showed me where to buy the best threads (Clark St Mercantile 
<https://www.facebook.com/ClarkStreetMercantile/>, which is big on independent 
brands, including its own clothing line); the best place for sundowners (
Alexandraplatz Bar <http://www.alexandraplatzbar.com/>, a pop-up drinking den 
in a former warehouse in the Mile-Ex district); and the best summer parties (
Piknic Electronik <http://piknicelectronik.com/en/>, for outdoor DJ sets on Ile 
Sainte-Hélène every summer Sunday, tickets from about £7). People hugged him on 
the streets, and I met his friends.

Later, I headed south to Little Burgundy. Along with neighbouring Griffintown, 
this former working class district is like the city’s Mile End district was 10 
years ago: arty but still edgy. It’s swiftly becoming the foodie capital of 
Montreal, too. Famous spots likeJoe Beef and Liverpool House 
<http://joebeef.ca/>, sister restaurants on Rue Notre Dame Ouest, have become 
synonymous with this city’s no-nonsense, high-quality food – the lobster 
spaghetti (£26) and oysters from its seafood bar come highly recommended. But 
there are also new treats, such as experimentalLe Fantome 
<https://www.facebook.com/restofantome/> (1832 Rue William), known for peanut 
butter and jam sandwiches with foie gras, and hip cafe-cum-bakeryLa Bête à Pain 
<http://www.labeteapain.com/>, which has just opened a branch on Rue Young a 
little way north in Griffintown.

 La Bête à Pain 
There are excellent cultural spaces too. Warehouse-style galleries such as 
Arsenal <http://www.arsenalmontreal.com/en/>and Division Gallery 
<http://www.galeriedivision.com/>, both on Rue William, are smaller than the 
main museums downtown but more challenging – until 3 July, for example, an 
interactive, virtual- and augmented-reality exhibition called Automata examines 
the impact of artificial intelligence on art and culture.

Montreal is an in-between land. It is a city of two tongues, two minds and two 
ways of life. French is the official language, but half the city speaks 
English. It’s like the confluence of two rivers: some of the waters blend 
together, but others may never mix. That creates a clash.

“Living in Montreal is like dating someone with borderline personality 
disorder,” says Russ Cooper, a local guitarist. The French influence is 
everywhere: bars look more like brasseries, chip shops offer hand-cutfrites and 
the patisseries rival Paris – including one that’s so good it’s called the 
G-spot (Point G <http://boutiquepointg.com/>) known for its macaroons. But 
there are also things that France would never condone: fine dining restaurants 
with tattooed waiters, microbrewed beer that trumpsappellation controlée wine, 
gastronomy that is experimental and fresh.

And that’s what makes Montreal special. Differences generate new ideas. 
Montreal now has the world’s second-highest proportion of people employed in 
creative industries (after London). The National Film Board of Canada has 
become a world leader in virtual reality and interactive films, picking up six 
Webby Awards for innovation this year. Montreal is also the third-largest 
centre in the world for video game production and fourth-largest for visual 
effects.

Arts centres such as downtown’s PHI offer constant streams of pioneering 
creative content, from boundary-pushing theatre and music to digital art 
installations, ground-breaking cinema and more. And the more creative the city 
becomes, the more creative people come here. There is a palpable sense of 
ingenuity and imagination on the streets.

And there’s plenty to do, too. This summer sees the Mural Festival 
<http://16.muralfestival.com/> of street art (9-19 June), a Circus Arts Festival
 <https://montrealcompletementcirque.com/en/> (7-17 July), the Montreal 
International Fireworks Competition 
<http://montreal-fireworks.com/schedule.html> (2-30 July), as well as events 
for comic books, kites, folk music, rock’n’roll and reggae. Montreal now has 
the biggest comedy festival in the world –Just for Laughs 
<http://www.hahaha.com/> (13-31 July), this year hosting Jimmy Carr and Russell 
Howard from the UK, often in small, intimate venues – not to mentionthe world’s 
largest jazz festival <http://www.montrealjazzfest.com/default-en.aspx> (June 
29-July 9).

More than one local I met said their only complaint was that they felt guilty 
for having a night in.

 Printemps Numerique Photograph: Martine Doyon 
Electronic arts are thriving, too. I visited during Montreal’s Digital Spring 
<http://printempsnumerique.info/en/>, a city wide celebration of arts numeriques
 (until 21 June) and in one night explored a gallery of first world war 
photographs displayed in virtual reality beside endless rows of gravestones, 
and ended up on my back in a 360-degree acid-trip-inspired planetarium show at 
a cool technological arts bar and event space calledS.A.T <http://ix.sat.qc.ca/>
. Things like that tend to happen here.

Early summer is the best time to come. In winter, temperatures drop to 
skin-burning degrees and people hibernate like bears. (Although there are 
exceptions: “Dancing in a one piece fluorescent ski suit in -35C is pretty 
special,” one local told me.) Summer is the release. Bars and restaurants take 
over the streets, music rings from every corner, flowers bloom and colour 
floods the city. It’s like the final bell of the summer term, when all the kids 
run out to play.

 Le Mal Nécessaire, a pineapple-themed bar in Chinatown 
And play I did. My last night started in a pineapple-themed bar in Chinatown, 
Le Mal Nécessaire <http://www.lemalnecessaire.com/>, then I moved on to watch 
award-winning Canadian comic Heidi Foss and sidestepped to Little Italy and a 
new, retro pinball machine joint calledNorth Star 
<http://www.northstarpinball.com/english/#pinball>. I should have ended the 
evening listening to Seb Black perform at Emery Street Studios, but somehow, 
four giant bowling-pin-sized beers later, ended up with my head nearly in a 
plate of poutine atPatati Patata 
<http://www.midnightpoutine.ca/food/2007/03/patati_patata_petite_patate_tant_pis_pour_toi/>
. And that was just an “ordinary” Friday night out.

Montreal’s not the new Brooklyn or the new Seattle. It’s not France, Great 
Britain or America. It’s not even really Canada. It’s its own thing, an island 
city. On Place d’Armes, in Old Montreal, a pair of sculptures depict a French 
woman holding a poodle and a British man holding a pug. The humans are turning 
away from each other, but the poodle and the pug just want to play. Perhaps, 
more than anything, they encapsulate the spirit of this city.

Because whatever clashes and harmonies this city creates, what matters most is 
that right now, the winter is over, the sun is out, there’s music playing – and 
Montreal is up for a good time.
