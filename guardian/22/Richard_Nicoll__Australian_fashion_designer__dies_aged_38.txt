Nicoll was part of a generation of designers, along with Jonathan Saunders and 
Christopher Kane, who combined creativity and commercialism to put London 
Fashion Week back on the radar of the international fashion industry. Studying 
under esteemed professorLouise Wilson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/may/20/louise-wilson> on the Central 
Saint Martins MA, his entire graduate collection was bought by Dolce & Gabbana 
in 2002. He won several awards over his career, including the prestigious Andam 
Prize in 2008. He also worked on several ranges for high street brands, 
including Fred Perry and Topshop, and was creative director at Italian brand 
Cerruti from 2009 to 2011.
