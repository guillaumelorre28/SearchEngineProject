Paris fashion week <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/paris-fashion-week> is 
almost over, bringing catwalk season to a close four weeks after the circus 
rolled into New York. And here’s what it boils down to: soon, you will want to 
wear a pink dress.

Wait. A dress? A pink dress? Is this the same fashion industry that’s been 
banging the drum for tracksuit bottoms and gender fluidity for the past two 
years? Indeed. More of which in a moment. But first, a little more about the 
pink dress.

At Balenciaga on Sunday morning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/02/demna-gvasalia-reinvigorates-balenciaga-with-strategic-disrespect>
, in a hangar-sized venue on the Périphérique divided into corridor-shaped 
catwalks by plain white curtains, the way beds are on a hospital ward, it was a 
watermelon-pink dress, which swung loose from turtleneck to knee, long sleeves 
almost meeting duck-egg blue gloves, the skirt slashed to one hip.At Céline 
<https://www.ft.com/content/5957e7e2-88af-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731>, where the 
catwalk meandered around disorienting curves of two-way glass, which caused one 
model to completely lose her bearings halfway through the show, the shade was 
flamingo and the drapes sunrayed out from the breastbone, a dress overlaid with 
a cape – half superhero, half twinset.At Valentino 
<https://www.ft.com/content/12d43eb2-8957-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731>, under the 
frescoes and chandeliers of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild, it was knee-length 
(again), high at the neck, draped, a cape-dress hybrid, this time in the 
classic Paris fashion week shade ofSchiaparelli pink 
<http://www.vogue.com/869055/elsa-schiaparellis-enduring-influence-on-beauty/>. 
At Givenchy <https://www.ft.com/content/f8c109cc-8958-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731>, 
that evening, in the gardens of the Natural History Museum it was 
ballet-slipper pink, high-necked, with silk fringing and sweeping long sleeves. 
The next dayat Hermès 
<https://www.ft.com/content/2c222102-8986-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731>, it was 
fuchsia, in parachute-silk, cut on the bias for soft movement.

What on earth is going on? With hindsight, Rihanna nailed it a week ago, when 
she took her bow after herFenty x Puma collection 
<http://uk.puma.com/uk/en/collections/explore/puma-by-rihanna> – in a 
floor-length pink coat dress and three strings of pearls – and described the 
look as “what Marie Antoinette would wear to go to the gym.” Athleisure has 
come to dominate fashion not just because people go to the gym more, but 
because fashion reflects the psychological weather out there. The rise in 
status of sport as referenced in what we wear reflects how our new value system 
prizes action, “making stuff happen”, over the old standards of propriety, 
formality, and expertise. This isn’t only about action in the literal physical 
exercise sense – it connects to theVogue-versus-the-bloggers debate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/03/reason-vogue-declared-war-fashion-bloggers-susie-bubble-fashion-shows>
, which is the old world versus the new, the upstarts getting in the faces 
(literally, at the shows) of the establishment. Fashion week is a bit like a 
ouija board: someone’s probably pushing the glass, but the exercise ends up 
being revealing anyway.

this being a particularly female moment at Paris fashion week. Even beforeKim 
Kardashian’s ordeal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/kim-kardashian-west-gunpoint-robbery-manhunt-paris>
, the Paris fashion week headlines were about women alone, from Rihanna 
channelling the lonely figure of Marie Antoinette to the debut of Maria Grazia 
Chiuri, the first woman to designChristian Dior 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/30/maria-grazia-chiuri-christian-dior-debut-feminist-message-paris-fashion-week>
. Grazia Chiuri’s influence has been pervasive this week, not just in her 
slogan feminism at Dior but in that her rise to prominence has put the 
Valentino look with which she made her name at the forefront of everyone’s 
mind. The Valentino look revolves around narrow-shouldered, slim-sleeved 
dresses with an essential quality, which Chiuri calls “grace”. Grace, she says, 
is “like elegance, but more subtle.”

Pink dresses are part of the new world order in that they don’t obey 
traditional rules. They are not cocktail dresses, or party dresses, or power 
dresses, or any of the established department-store categories. But while they 
are dresses for striding out, they are not for the gym. And rather than being 
futuristic, they are loaded with historical references, from Guinevere to Marie 
Antoinette to Elsa Schiaparelli.

Just at the moment when it seemed that fashion might be entirely subsumed into 
the athleisure industry, the pink dress is fashion week’s declaration of 
independence. It is fashion flying its very own colours from the flagpole. 
Which is excellent news as far as I am concerned, because there are only so 
many bra tops you need to see, even on Gigi Hadid. And if I ever do feel the 
need to see a procession of expensive running leggings I can always go and 
watch my local half marathon. I’ll be the one wearing the pink dress.
