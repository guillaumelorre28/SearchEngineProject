High-shine lips are not for everyone. They are sticky, they are messy, they 
are impossible to eat with, and they leave snail-like smears on every glass. 
But who isn’t attracted to shiny things? There is something infinitely 
appealing about a shiny summer lip, as seen here at Givenchy, where they gothed 
it up in direct contravention of the fun and flowery seasonal make-up rules.
