There aren’t many fashion designers with whom a conversation about Star Wars 
would veer fromLive & Kicking <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_%26_Kicking> 
to a declaration that “boredom is the new electric”, but Jonathan Anderson has 
never been one for convention.

As creative director of his own label, JW Anderson, and of Spanish luxury 
brand Loewe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/03/jw-anderson-loewe-interview>, 
Anderson is one of the most influential forces in contemporary fashion. He is 
famed for producing designs that may look unsettlingly avant garde at first – 
think men in blouses and women cloaked in androgynous tunics – but are later 
widely adopted by the industry.

For autumn/winter 2015, Anderson did high-gloss, brightly hued 1980s brash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/22/jw-anderson-looks-to-the-1980s-suburban-disco-for-inspiration>
 while his peers were still mining the sepia-toned 70s for inspiration; 
inevitably, the outlook for spring/summer 2016 is heavy on the lurex. Right 
now, the 31-year-old affectionately known as J-Dubs says he is thinking about 
“the normality of people; the normality of textures” and “the idea of boredom” 
in his work. “Something that is part of society, that feels as though it was 
always there,” he says – hence the “boredom is the new electric” edict. He 
delivers these opaque, Yoda-like proclamations with a smile, perhaps knowing 
that some poor trend forecaster will soon be devoting hours to decoding them.

Anderson’s latest project is a collaboration with Star Wars. Several London 
labels, including Preen and Nasir Mazhar, have created T-shirts and sweatshirts 
inspired by the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens film. The tops will be 
sold from Thursday at Selfridges in London, while catwalk lookswill be 
auctioned on 26 November in aid of Great Ormond Street children’s hospital

Anderson’s T-shirt and sweatshirt are tie-dyed, which, he says, “looks kind of 
like the universe”, with patches of graphics from the film. He says the images 
remind him “of those amazing bedspreads you get as a child.”

Anderson grew up on a farm in Northern Ireland and remembers Star Wars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> as “go-to escapism films”, which he 
watched alongside classic 90s daytime TV fare (Live & Kicking and Roland Rat), 
as well as playing with his brother “building tree houses and making clubs for 
two people”.

Like many designers of his generation, Anderson does not remember a time 
before Star Wars existed. He says it has become “so ingrained in culture that 
it’s as if Star Wars is real. If we ever go futuristic in a collection, there 
is always a Star Wars reference, even if it’s not actually on the mood board.”

“What I really love in the costumes of the film is that they take 
hyper-futuristic approaches and then you have this incredible, medieval 
organic-ness,” he says. “It is incredibly difficult to create garments that are 
iconic or robots that are iconic,” he continues, “to create costumes that look 
like a non-moment – a non-decade, if that makes sense – costumes that do not 
date. You look at the costumes and believe that you already know what they feel 
like, even though they are completely new. They do not feel fake, which 
actually makes the whole thing quite uncanny.”

As for the best-dressed characters? The J-Dubs seal of fashion approval goes 
to the Stormtroopers’ modular, monochrome uniforms, but he also has a lot of 
time for C-3PO (“I like that you can see the landscape reflecting in 
someone,”), Han Solo (those knee-high boots, he laughs, are “quite 
directional”) and, of course, the white robes of Princess Leia (“I think of her 
like a futuristic version of Elizabeth I; it’s very baptism”).

There is a lot of resonance with his own work, which is also about creating a 
believable character each season, because “we are living in a period of time 
which is kind of post-fashion, where you are looking to the past and 
reinterpreting it for now”. And so the industry will continue to take 
inspiration from Star Wars, he believes, because “ultimately, everyone’s dream 
is to create something so iconic”.
