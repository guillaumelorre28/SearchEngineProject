Amazon has made convenience king, offering shopping from your workplace, 
armchair, or even while commuting with a single click and delivery to your 
door, perhaps within the hour. Now it is triallinga queue-less, cashier-less 
grocery store 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/amazon-go-store-seattle-checkouts-account>
. Sensors will track which items customers pick up and bill their account as 
they walk out. The benefit to those in a rush is obvious – but it means another 
lost opportunity for social contact, in the queue with fellow shoppers, with 
cashiers or the staff overseeing erratic self-checkouts. Such connections, 
fleeting as they are, can be life-saving for the chronically lonely and good 
for others too, reminding us that polite interaction matters as much as getting 
what we want this second. About a million older people go a monthwithout 
speaking to a friend, neighbour or relative 
<http://www.ageuk.org.uk/get-involved/campaign/loneliness-campaign/>, and 
loneliness is linked to mental andphysical health problems

a broader social and economic strain. Researchers at the University of 
Hertfordshire this month suggestedintroducing checkout “slow lanes”

approach may make better business sense by appealing to our impatience, but it 
comes at a human cost.
