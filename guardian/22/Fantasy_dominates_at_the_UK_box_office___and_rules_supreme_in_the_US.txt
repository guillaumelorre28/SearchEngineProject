Only two of the 20 best-performing films in the US in 2016 was a “real world” 
story, compared with four in the UK.

Jason Bourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/jason-bourne-review-matt-damon-back-in-fun-but-forgettable-action-revamp>
, Paul Greengrass’s triumphant return for Matt Damon’s amnesiac spy, came in at 
No 12 in the North American year-end charts, amid a sea of superhero movies, 
sci-fi space yarns and family films. At No 20, Dwayne Johnson/Kevin Hart comedy
Central Intelligence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/central-intelligence-review-dwayne-johnson-kevin-hart>
 also sounded a battle cry for semi-realism.

Finding Dory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres>
 was the top film of 2016 in the US, taking $486m domestically, followed by
Captain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>
 ($408m) andRogue One: A Star Wars Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-review-felicity-jones-gareth-edwards>
, which has so far taken $396m after a fortnight on release.

The remainder of the top 20 are comic book adaptations such as Deadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero>
,Doctor Strange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/24/doctor-strange-review-benedict-cumberbatch-marvel-eyepoppingly-freaky-extravaganza>
 andSuicide Squad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/02/suicide-squad-review-dc-comics-will-smith-margot-robbie-jared-leto>
, children’s fare such asThe Secret Life of Pets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/secret-life-pets-film-review-family-animation-new-york>
 andTrolls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/11/trolls-review-anna-kendrick-a-candy-coloured-return-for-the-famed-ugly-lovable-creatures>
, and franchise expansions includingStar Trek Beyond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/15/star-trek-beyond-review-zachary-quinto-spock-anton-yelchin>
,X-Men: Apocalypse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/x-men-apocalypse-review-marvel-jennifer-lawrence-oscar-isaac>
 and Harry Potter spin-offFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/13/fantastic-beasts-review-jk-rowling-eddie-redmayne-harry-potter>
.

Original properties proved strong in animation, with Moana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/moana-review-disney-polynesian-adventure>
, The Secret Life of Pets,Zootopia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/zootropolis-review-elegance-wit-and-first-rate-animation>
 andSing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/sing-review-scarlett-johansson-toronto-film-festival-matthew-mcconaughey>
 all faring well despite a lack of prior brand awareness. A number of titles 
perceived at the time of release to have underperformed also made the cut, 
including the latest Star Trek movie and Paul Feig’s female reboot of
Ghostbusters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/14/ghostbusters-review-very-funny-action-comedy-spectacular>
.

The UK’s equivalent chart suggested audiences there had slightly more 
preference for stories set within the bounds of reality, withBridget Jones’s 
Baby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation>
,The Girl on the Train 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/03/the-girl-on-the-train-review-emily-blunt-paula-hawkins>
 andThe Revenant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/the-revenant-review-gut-churningly-brutal-beautiful-storytelling>
 joining Jason Bourne in the top 20 (Central Intelligence came in at No 36). 
The best-performing film in the UK wasThe Jungle Book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review>; Finding 
Dory came in third, after Bridget Jones’s Baby.
