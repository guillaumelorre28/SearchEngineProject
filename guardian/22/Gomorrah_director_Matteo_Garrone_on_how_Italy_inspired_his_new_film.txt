In Italy, we have many wonderful castles. My location manager spent eight 
months travelling from the north to the south to find the most amazing ones to 
use as locations for Tale of Tales.

The film is a sort of homage to the silent movies, like those made by Georges 
Méliès. So we wanted to find places that looked believable but could almost 
have been built in the studio. The Gole dell’Alcantara in Sicily – where the 
king in one of the stories goes into the water to fight a sea monster – was one 
of these places. We liked it because it was real but could have been created by 
the set designer.

The plot is made up of three stories and for The Flea, it was important to 
find an isolated castle, to emphasise the loneliness of the princess whom the 
king is trying to marry off, so we chose Castel Del Montein Puglia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/04/puglia-guide-italy-hotels-bari-brindisi-foggia-salento>
 – an octagonal fortress on a hill and surrounded by little else. For The Two 
Old Women (about a sex addict king and two sisters, one of whom he courts), we 
needed a place with the castle above the little town where the two old ladies 
live. We chose Caetani castle, which looms above the town of Sermoneta in Lazio.

The locations themselves are characters, in a way. They give insight into the 
people and the conflicts of the movie – and sometimes they inspired ideas that 
became part of the script. When I saw the maze at Donnafugata Castle, a 
palatial 14th-century castlein Sicily 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/29/sicily-aeolian-islands-italy-houses-hotels-villas>
, I felt it was very important to use it in a scene in The Queen – one that was 
central to the drama. This is how the idea came to have the queen chasing her 
son in the maze, who then escapes with his doppelganger.

My favourite location was the Gole dell’Alcantara, on our first day of filming
, I remember being really surprised by the atmosphere there. It was completely 
wild and very magic in a way.

 ‘I was bowled over by an ancient forest with moss-covered boulders.’ 
In Italy, there are a lot of places that have been abandoned – but that makes 
them more interesting. Sometimes they are much more beautiful because they’ve 
been left just as they were centuries ago.

It was incredible to be on the top of the Castel del Monte in Puglia. It’s one 
of the most famous castles in the world and I used it for the scene of the 
fight between the king and the princess. We didn’t have any safety measures and 
she was running across the top, trying to jump down. It was the most difficult 
and dangerous scene to shoot.

When I first went to see the Bosco del Sasseto, in Lazio, I was completely 
bowled over by its beauty. It’s an ancient forest with moss-covered boulders 
below the Castello di Torre Alfina. When you are inside, the atmosphere is 
unbelievable and it’s a place that few people visit. That’s the beauty of 
Italy; in another country, these woods and park would already have gadgets and 
places to buy souvenirs, but here you can just go and look around. No one will 
bother you.


Shooting the film really brought home to me how many beautiful places there 
are in Italy – some of which are hidden away. This can be a good thing as it 
protects them from companies and individuals who want to set up businesses. 
It’s so rich, our country, you will always be surprised by something.

I’m not a very good traveller but I really like the south of Italy. I’ve spent 
three or four summers in Salento, close to Gallipoli; it’s a wonderful place, 
still not too touristy or full of hotels being built. It’s still pure.


I could live in Capo Miseno one day. It’s near Naples, it’s very old and next 
to the sea, a magic place.
