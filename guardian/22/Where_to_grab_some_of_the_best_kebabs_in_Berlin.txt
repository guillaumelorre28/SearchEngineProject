From street food feasts serving ramen burgers and pulled pork sandwiches to 
farm-to-table restaurants opening every month, Berlin’s culinary scene is 
rapidly improving. But for a long time, the city’s main claim to fame was the 
invention of the doner kebab by Turkish immigrantKadir Nurman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/oct/28/kadir-nurman-invent-doner-kebab>
 in the 1970s. It was Nurman who first had the idea of stuffing roasted meat 
and salad into a pitta to provide busy Berliners with an on-the-go snack, 
although there are plenty who dispute its origins, arguing that the sandwich 
had been eaten in the Middle East long before Berlin claimed it as its own.

Whatever its beginnings, Berlin is sticking to its story and on 16 July 
celebrates the history of the kebab with a street food festival in Kreuzberg. 
Gathering newcomers and established kebab makers in one place,Kebabistan 
<http://berlinfoodstories.com/2016/06/30/kebabistan-2/> is organised by, among 
others, Kavita Meelu whose name is synonymous with Berlin’s burgeoning food 
scene.

After establishing the internationally known Street Food Thursday at 
Markthalle Neun in 2013, Meelu’s latest adventure explores topics such as food 
heritage, German identity and cultural exchange through food.

I asked Meelu about her favourite places to enjoy a perfectly grilled kebab in 
Berlin:

For more than 20 years, Adana Grillhaus has been serving large plates loaded 
with tender chargrilled meat and accompanied by a plethora of meze. The 40-seat 
restaurant is located amid the hustle and bustle of Kreuzberg, often referred 
to as Little Istanbul, thanks to its long-established Turkish community. If 
you’re lucky, you can get a seat next to the open kitchen, watching the grill 
masters preparing the meat the traditional Adana way: minced meat of lamb, 
under one year old, mixed with tail fat.

Located just off Kottbusser Tor station in Kreuzberg since the early 1990s, 
this small food stand specialises in kofte, freshly grilled meatballs made of 
minced lamb meat. Konak Grill serves its kofte stuffed in sandwiches with fresh 
herbs including mint, rocket, parsley.

Fes – Turkish BBQ

Opened last year, this restaurant next to Hasenheide park is already a 
crowd-pleaser. What distinguishes the newcomer from the established kebab 
makers is the contemporary twist of using table electric grills instead of 
charcoal. This way, everyone can gather around and grill their own meat. 
According to Meelu, the meat quality is among the best you can get in kebab 
places across the city.

Tucked away on a small side street next to Kottbusser Tor in Kreuzberg, Doyum 
is known for its tasty meat cooked in the style of the grillmasters from the 
city of Gaziantep in southern Turkey. Additionally, the flat bread is baked 
in-house and always served fresh. A must-try from the menu is the shish kebab, 
the small cubes of lamb meat served on roasted aubergine purée. “Don’t forget 
to order a side oflahmacun, stone-baked flat bread smothered in a very thin 
layer of minced lamb, tomato and spices,” says Meelu.

El Reda

Focusing on Lebanese and Iranian specialities, this place in the Moabit 
district, which is the only recommendation outside of Kreuzberg, is an 
institution and a must on the kebab map in Berlin, according to Meelu. Owner 
Hassan Khreis and his team offer a Persian version of the kebab calledkubideh, 
which Meelu describes as, “a plate of perfectly grilled minced lamb kebabs, 
served with fluffy saffron rice, grilled tomato and a plate of Persian herbs 
and raw onion”.
