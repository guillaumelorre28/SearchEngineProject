we’re grownups. If youbelieve the Mail 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3049446/Is-BOWL-CUT-90s-mushroom-hairdo-staging-unlikely-comeback-thanks-Robert-Pattinson.html>
, there’s been a significant uptick in the number of men heading to the barbers 
and asking for a ’do more readily associated with that spotty kid who stuck 
Wotsits up his nose at lunchtime than it is with 21st-century hipsterism.

Meanwhile, the man bun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/oct/16/man-buns-hair-trend-jake-gyllenhaal>
 continues to bestride the pop-cultural universe, filtering down into ordinary 
life sufficiently that this week a focus group conducted (in sober mood and 
with forensic precision, one presumes) by a mobile gaming site has deemed them 
the worst trend of the year. Look around you, in fact, and it seems like a 
pretty diabolical moment for men’s barnets across the board. Here is some 
important analysis of the worst examples of the moment.

I can’t really get my head round this one, which makes sense, since actually 
this is one that gets round your head. It’s Robert Pattinson’s fault, or 
possibly FKA twigs’, for the brilliantly literal version he got shortly after 
they started going out, removing every last wisp from below the colander line. 
(Except that weird little square he kept on the back, of course, which I always 
thought looked like where you would charge him up.) The only note of comfort: 
it is just possible that the hairdresser who exuberantly informed the Mail of 
this phenomenon is having us on a bit, sincethe picture provided 
<http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/21/20/27CE16B700000578-0-image-m-28_1429645838521.jpg>
 of customers queuing round the block features several men whose hair is 
already too short to protrude once they stick a bowl on their bonce. If you’re 
ever tempted, repeat to yourself: soup and salads. It’s for soup and salads.

Fiercely though I wish to ridicule the man bun, I know, at heart, that this is 
mostly the product of envy. Whatever that focus group says, every woman I speak 
to seems to fancy a man with a bun – but try it in the office and your career 
will be unfairly derailed as everyone starts to associate you inextricably with 
Oliver Proudlock from Made In Chelsea. Proudlock aside, if you’re not a 
professional footballer or a boybandist, you should probably leave this to the 
experts. You’re not virile enough. Sorry.

3. The undercut bob

Show me a man with a good word to say about the undercut bob and I will show 
you a man who works for Jamie Oliver. Equal parts boyband, buzzcut and 
Brylcreem,as Hannah Marriott astutely pointed out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/30/jamie-olivers-new-hair-aka-the-undercut-bob>
, there’s a lot to unpack here: Oliver’s do has a lineage in football,being as 
it is a cousin of your classic Giroud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/apr/12/footballers-hair-scott-parker-tim-dowling>
 and your Beckhamesque middle-aged man quiff. Giroud’s has a certain matinee 
idol charm, but the others are horrendous – particularly Oliver’s, which looks 
as if he’s put his mullet on upside down.

This one I’ve definitely noticed in reality, as well as in pictures of Jared 
Leto looking a bit sinister 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/06/jared-leto-dyes-his-hair-blond-stylewatch>
: male peroxide jobs are ever more common, reminding us all of the fascinating 
fact that “blond” is one of the only English adjectives to take a gender 
suffix! Ourown Oscar Rickett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/29/do-gentlemen-prefer-being-blond>
 gave it a whirl, and I think he looks quite cool. You wouldn’t want it to 
catch on too widely, though, or our cities will take on an unfortunate 
undercurrent of fascist menace.

This is, if nothing else, a long-term economic haircut, and loathe though I am 
to admit it, a vast improvement on the UK Chancellor’s previous looks (even if 
he feels the need tofrequently hide it with a hard hat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/nov/18/osbornes-other-hat-anniversaries-jargon>
). Of all these styles it’s also the one most likely to be widely mimicked, 
ticking off as it does most men’s primary hair goals of making you seem sharp, 
effective and less bald with what looks like minimal maintenance. Of course, by 
the same token, it also makes you look like a 24-carat Buller bastard, 
ruthlessly efficient as you smash up a restaurant. So probably not one to go 
for if you mind whether anyone likes you.
