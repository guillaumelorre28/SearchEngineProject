Belgium’s Gianni Meersman claimed victory in the second stage of the Vuelta a 
España <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/vuelta-a-espana> on Sunday, with 
Poland’s Michal Kwiatkowski assuming the overall race lead.

Britain’s Peter Kennaugh conceded the red jersey to his Team Sky team-mate 
Kwiatkowski after a 160.8km stage, where Etixx-Quick-Step’s Meersman won out 
courtesy of a 200m late sprint to the line.

Chris Froome’s bid to win two grand tours in the same calendar year remains on 
track though, with the Team Sky rider sitting fourth in the overall standings.

Germany’s Michael Schwarzmann finished second, with Denmark’s Magnus Cort 
Nielsen in third and Kwiatkowski’s fourth sufficient for the overall race lead 
to change hands.

Direct Energy’s Ryan Anderson suffered a heavy fall midway through the stage 
but was able to return to the race.

Monday’s 176.4km third stage will feature the climb to the Mirador de Ezaro.
