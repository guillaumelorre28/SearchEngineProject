During the protracted Ciccone-Ritchie custody battle a strange thing revealed 
itself: Rocco Ritchie was a style icon. Now, when we say “style icon”, we don’t 
mean in the classic sense like, say, Steve McQueen or David Bowie. No, we mean 
it in a slightly left-of-centre kind of way. At the time of The Troubles, 
Ritchie Jr would appear in various paparazzi shots beaming in a full-on rainbow 
spectrum of skater clothes looking somewhere between “good” and “so bad it’s 
good”.

There he was in a white hoodie under a two-tone lime/grey fleece from The 
North Face, in aubergine-coloured skater trousers with a lilac Palace fleece or 
dressed in wide-legged cut-off jeans with a black Palace top zipped up to his 
chin. In fact, theathleisure

 label Palace, loved by hipsters and celebrities is a big part of Rocco’s look.

Palace, like Alexander Wang, love a good riff on pop culture

, so it seems appropriate that Rocco would begin his modelling career by 
fronting the campaign for Wang’s nine-piece capsule collection collaboration 
with Adidas. Here, the Wang-ian touch is the Adidas crescent turned upside 
down. The image above of a non-beaming Rocco (eyes closed, sun on his face) 
wearing the insignia on a black tracksuit and clutching a bin bag (verynow

) feels on point with his adolescently awkward brand.
