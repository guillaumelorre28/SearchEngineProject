1. Lady Gaga threw shade on Kendall Jenner 

Lady Gaga <https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga> walked, wearing a 
black wool coat with green furry sleeves, a lime pussy-bow blouse and enormo 
platform boots. In the running order, she was listed as “Stephanie” (her real 
name is Stefani). Only Gaga can star in the most outre show of fashion week and 
make it look like the most normal outfit you have seen her in for ages, right? 
Kendall walked too, in an oversized suit with a stand-up feather collar – but 
Gaga stole the show, because the mood was very dark-fairytale and she is, after 
all, queen of the Monsters.

2. Marc Jacobs and Anna Wintour wore matching Hillary T-shirts

So cute! Anna wore the white one that you can buy for $45. Marc wore a dark 
version, which we guess he got made up specially to match the mood of the show. 
Anna styled hers with a classic Anna necklace and a tweed skirt; Marc wore his 
with a suit.

3. Wednesday Addams is the new Margot Tenenbaum: discuss

Her spirit is everywhere this week, from Harper Beckham’s plaits to here, 
where Jacobs named her as one of his inspirations. When Christina Ricci came to 
give him a backstage hug after the show, Jacobs told the photographers that 
Christina-as-Wednesday was “the message”.

4. It was an epic show, but it wasn’t fun-fun, like last season. 

September’s show was all showgirls and Broadway razzmatazz. This show was in 
the Park Avenue Armory, made into a cerebral, zen space with a circular catwalk 
laid with floorboards painted white. The soundtrack was an arrhythmic series of 
chimes, inspired by the Japanese artist Keiji Haino, who is known for his use 
of “ma” – the “haunted spaces between notes”. So, you know, not exactly a 
kitchen disco.

5. This was the dark side of last season’s New York City story

“We wanted to continue the kind of New York fairytale we started telling last 
season, but in a different kind of manner,” said Jacobs backstage, when I 
basically dragged him out of a hug with Emily Ratajkowski to talk inspo with 
me, like you do. “We turned it all to greys – we were kind of inspired by all 
the beautiful women we see walking around the city who wear only black and 
grey. We were thinking about creatures of fashion, and fallen angels – everyone 
from Lydia in Beetlejuice [Winona!] to Cinderella.” The embroidery featured 
ballerinas, crows, mice and caged birds.

6. The shoes were INSANELY high

“I started the whole collection with an oversized sweater, and that led to an 
oversized jacket. And once the clothes got so big, the shoe needed to be 
fantastical, too. Everything became fictionalised and blown out of proportion,” 
says Jacobs.

7. A lot of New York fashion week is just clothes, but this was FASHION

Parts were reminiscent of McQueen: the towering platforms that gave the models 
an ungainly stomp; the bleached eyebrows; the hair plastered to the skull in 
kiss curls and then tufting into mullet-fluff at neck level. (Effective on the 
catwalk. Not necessarily a date night look, I’ll be honest.) The front half of 
an opulent fur coat merged with the back half of a masculine tweed overcoat, as 
if Martin Margiela had restyled Margot Tenenbaum. But there were foxy red 
carpet dresses in there, too: and an impressive head count of front-row thesps, 
from Zosia Mamet to Maggie Gyllenhaal.
