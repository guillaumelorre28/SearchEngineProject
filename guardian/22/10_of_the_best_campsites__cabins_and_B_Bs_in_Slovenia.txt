HISTORIC TOWNS AND VILLAGES

Gostilna Repnik, Kamnik

Two kilometres outside the medieval town of Kamnik, just north of Ljubljana, 
thisgostilna (inn) has nine beautiful rooms, finished in natural wood and raw 
concrete. The rooms extend a playful nod to Slovenia’s natural and man-made 
heritage, so feature, for example, a log-built headboard or a mini climbing 
wall. The restaurant – whose chef, Primož, is also the owner – is a similarly 
classy affair, aping a hunter’s lodge and serving dishes such as 
pepper-encrusted tenderloin medallions. There are extensive gardens and 
orchards, alongside stables where kids can ride ponies. Should you be inclined 
to venture beyond the inn, there are easy strolls around Kamnik. For something 
more energetic, head for the high plateau (up to 1,666 metres) of Velika 
Planina – 5km up the Kamniška Bistrica Valley and then a five-minute whizz in a 
cable car – where the broad pastures are spotted with shepherds’ huts.

The pretty, stone-built village of Slap, some 35km from the Italian border, is 
home to this subterranean guesthouse with 10 bedrooms under extensive gardens, 
each one named after a herb (for example basil and lavender) and painted in 
lime green, buttercup yellow and lilac. They are refreshingly clutter-free, 
with little by way of cupboards or chairs (hangers are provided), and no TVs 
(there’s Wi-Fi and mobile reception, though). Skylights ensure you’re not 
starved of natural light, and the temperature is a constant 17C. Breakfast, 
taken above ground, includes freshly picked fruit and veg from the garden, and 
homemade breads, jams and cheeses.

In Slovenia’s oldest and prettiest town, in the country’s little-visited 
eastern region, this happy-go-lucky bed and breakfast has seven rooms painted 
in bold colours. Among the odd, spotty-painted cupboard or brightly patterned 
bedspread, there are custom-made upholstered chairs, as well as miniature 
radios and table games. Muzikafe is also Ptuj’s cultural hub: its suntrap 
terrace and retro-styled lounge are both perfect for a mid-morning coffee or an 
early evening beer, and its handsome brick-vaulted cellar hosts art 
exhibitions, literary evenings and concerts by some of the country’s most 
talented musicians. This place will charm your socks off, as will the town 
itself.

Northern Slovenia is rarely visited, which is a shame as these largely unknown 
mountain wilds have some truly memorable scenery, in particular forested 
valleys scattered with remote farmsteads. One such tourist farm is Koroš, 
Slovenia’s first dedicated bike hotel, which has been welcoming cyclists for 
more than 20 years. Accommodation is in 10 simple rooms, each with superlative 
mountain views. Bike tours (from €30) are offered as a matter of course, on the 
farm’s single trail park and on numerous tracks of varying difficulty 
throughout the mountains. Guests refuel on superb home-cooked food likejota 
(bean and sauerkraut soup), with ingredients from the garden. Bike hire is €25 
a day.

This small eco village of five log cabins sits among lush pine forests on the 
slopes of Pohorje, 15km from Maribor, Slovenia’s second city. Constructed from 
local spruce timber and insulated with wool, each sleeps four – two downstairs 
and two upstairs. Among the many sustainable initiatives are renewable energy 
sources, rainwater collection, a permaculture garden, and a small apiary. The 
neighbouring slopes offer some of Slovenia’s best skiing, and in summer there 
are superb hikes in the immediate surrounds.

In the isolated hamlet of Gorjuše, high above Lake Bohinj on the edge of the 
thickly forested Pokljuka plateau, this inviting homestead offers six 
rooms-cum-apartments, each named for a local trade, such askmecki (farmer) and 
tesarski(carpenter). Sleeping between two and six, they are furnished in 
natural woods, with ornamental carved and hand-painted beds, traditional 
fireplaces and kitchens. Jaka, the owner, encourages guests – and especially 
children – to participate in whatever farming activities may be going on, be it 
grass cutting, haymaking or preparing birch bundles. He’s also an accomplished 
cook, and, for a little extra (€15), will dish up a platter of cold cut trout 
followed by grilled lamb chops before you retire to your lodging.

Pliskovica’s main building – a 400-year-old barn that’s a protected cultural 
monument – is in classic Karst style, with white stone walls, slate roof, and a 
flower-decked veranda running its entire length. The six dorms come in a range 
of sizes, from four to 14 beds, all with shared facilities, and there’s a 
communal kitchen. The pretty, tree-filled patio invites guests to kick back 
with a glass of aromatic teran wine, which complements perfectly the local 
air-driedpršut ham. There are also camping pitches.

Under the formidable Nanos plateau in the Vipava Valley, this campsite offers 
10 underground wooden bunker rooms (Hobbit holes) with nothing more than a bed 
(with sheets and a duvet) and an electric light, that can just sleep two, if 
they’re very good friends. Although there are no dining or cooking facilities 
on site, there is relative comfort in the shape of a modern shower block, with 
separate sections for men and women, laundry facilities, a pool and a play 
area. Lijak is especially popular with paragliders lured here by the bora, a 
merciless northeasterly wind.

A wreath of jagged grey peaks towering over a milky blue river provides the 
backdrop for this eco-adventure resort. If you don’t fancy slumming it under 
canvas, the site offers cosy lean-tos (a tent enclosed in a wooden structure) 
with a deluxe version enhanced with wooden tables and chairs, a terrace and 
hammock. The many thrilling pursuits on offer take place mostly on the Soča 
river; rafting is the default activity, but there’s also canyoning or 
hydrospeed. A good local company isBovec Rafting Team

Among southern Slovenia’s myriad beautiful lakes – the most famous of which is 
the disappearing Cerknica Lake, so called because the waters intermittently 
drain into subterranean reservoirs – is the chummy sounding Lake Bloke and this 
rather fine campsite. It also has six basically furnished but snug wooden 
cabins sleeping two or three. There are activities aplenty, not least swimming 
in the lake and hiking. This is brown bear country, so if you fancy a chance 
encounter with one of these magnificent beasts – though not too close, 
obviously – guided brown bear-watching tours are available through 
organisations, including the Mlakar Inn (slovenianbears.com 
<http://slovenianbears.com/>).
