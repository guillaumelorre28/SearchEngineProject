Calvin Klein has announced that Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli will be 
leaving the company. As creative directors of womenswear and menswear 
respectively, the two men are making way for what the company describes as a 
way to “unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision” with more 
details to be announced “in due course”.

Fashion insiders will be putting their money on Raf Simons becoming Calvin 
Klein’s new creative director.Since leaving his role designing womenswear at 
Christian Dior in October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/22/raf-simons-to-leave-as-creative-director-at-dior>
, there have been rumours that the designer will be joining the US brand.

Costa and Zucchelli joined Calvin Klein in 2003 – and are widely thought to 
have been handpicked by Klein himself, as he took a backseat after selling his 
label to Phillips-Van Heusen for $700m (£486m) in the same year. Their work has 
been largely Klein approved: tasteful, simple and minimal from Costa;streety, 
slick and body-conscious from Zucchelli

In a statement, CEO Steve Shiffman described the unifying move as “the 
beginning of another significant chapter in Calvin Klein’s brand legacy”. It is 
part of a wider plan that saw the firm bring the underwear and jeans businesses 
back into the group in 2013, with the aim of building it into a $10bn global 
powerhouse.

Should the rumours be true, Simons would be a good fit. This aesthetic – a mix 
of slick minimalism and cool cult references – works for Calvin Klein, a label 
that has played with both of these qualities since it was founded in 1968. The 
enormity of the brand provides new territory, however. If Dior involved 
ready-to-wear, couture, cosmetics and accessories, Calvin Klein boasts around 
25 product categories, from underwear to jeans and fragrances. Simons, who has 
been vocal about leaving Dior to achieve a betterwork-life balance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/01/fashion-world-pressure-top-designers>
, would arguably be busier than ever.
