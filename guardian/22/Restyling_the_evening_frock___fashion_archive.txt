Evening frocks reserve to themselves the privilege of making innovations which 
need have neither rhyme nor reason. In a night, almost, they may become long or 
short; their waists may shuttle; their backs may disappear; their fronts may 
suggest a sore throat. They may have a great deal of stuff or hardly any.

One point which does stand out, however, among the evening dresses of the last 
five years is the extra garment - the coat which has made evenings tolerable to 
old ladies, the wrap or cape or scarf which has added interest to evening dress 
and qualified lowness in general.

Lowness indeed has ceased to be the chief feature of the recent evening dress. 
The Irene Dana evening frock of chiffon with large red and yellow flowers has 
an almost Greek top, the long open sleeves suggesting capes or draperies. The 
fit of the hips keeps the key of the moment, as does the sudden rush of 
fullness from the knees. This dress is modelled more or less on the lines of 
the natural figure, from which this designer is clever enough not to depart. 
Thus it keeps the right proportions and looks natural as well as slim.

Line in general has not altered much during recent months. Change has taken 
place rather in accessories. Innumerable evening frocks retain the proceed to 
play variations upon it. A sheath of black satin, for instance, which readies 
to the ground but has no train, has long tulle sleeves, starting almost from 
the shoulder straps. It is lent background by means of a narrow tulle cape, 
which hangs down, but not over the shoulders, almost to the ground.

There is the sheath which is lent a tailor-made appearance by means of a seam 
all down the front, and with a bodice rising in two points, as it were, to meet 
shoulder straps which are not there. Instead, the bodice is supported by means 
of whalebone. These strapless or sleeveless dresses are by their nature 
generally sheaths. They allow sometimes of tulle scarves or capes, or little 
wings on the back.
