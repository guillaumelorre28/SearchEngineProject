Flooding <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/flooding> was also expected 
in other parts of the Fitzroy River catchment as well as in the interior and 
west and north Kimberley districts, including Prince Regent River, Isdell 
River, Lennard river, Cape Leveque coast, Pentecost river, Drysdale river and 
King Edward river catchments.

The DFES said water would be fast flowing and levels would rise quickly so 
residents should watch water levels, be ready to evacuate and have relocation 
and emergency kits ready.

It warned residents to steer clear of floodwaters and avoid storm drains and 
pipes, ditches and ravines and not to drive into water of unknown depth and 
current.

Roads closed include the Gibb River Road from Blina turnoff to Great Northern 
Highway, the Cape Leveque Road and the Great Northern Highway between Fitzroy 
Crossing and Halls Creek.

The Bureau of Meteorology said ex-tropical Cyclone Yvette weakened rapidly 
while crossing the west Kimberley coast on Sunday morning and a monsoon was 
active over the west Kimberley, with heavy rainfall possible.

It said a tropical low was over eastern parts of the interior and would track 
south-east and cross into SouthAustralia
