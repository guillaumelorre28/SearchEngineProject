Can we just take a minute to appreciate the Isles of Scilly police force’s 
Facebook page <https://www.facebook.com/IslesofScillyPolice?ref=ts&fref=ts>?


It’s garnered quite the following, with more than 14,000 likes to date – a 
huge accomplishment when you bear in mind the Scilly Isles have a population of 
2,200. They drew a fair bit of internet love on Thursday morning after Sergeant 
Colin Taylor wrote a job advertisement for a police constable:
A unique opportunity.

officers were left puzzled by a fried egg left at the scene of a shed burglary.

Describing themselves “like Heartbeat but less frenetic”, there is nothing not

Could this be the new Top Gear?

In fact, Deputy Chief Constable Mowgli (retired) may be our favourite:

Their descriptions of crimes are second to none:
Don’t try and steal a giant anchor while Colin’s around.

Such is their popularity, they were recently given an official Facebook 
verified tick.

Basically, everyone can stop trying now: Isles of Scilly police have won 
Facebook. We salute you.

(and can we have an interview with Mowgli please)

UPDATE: BuzzFeed went and found some Scilly Vines

 and they’re just as delightful.
