In the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, there are fears of a huge rise in 
maternal deaths in Haiti.Karen McVeigh speaks to a midwife at St Antoine 
hospital in Jérémie, Grand’Anse – one of the country’s worst-hit towns – who 
tells ofdelivering babies by torchlight as she stood knee-deep in water 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/25/midwife-haiti-hurricane-matthew-delivering-babies-knee-deep-in-floodwater>
, while the hurricane ripped through the south-west tip of the country.

The widespread devastation has also triggered fears of a fresh cholera 
outbreak; this comes at a time when the UN’s human rights special rapporteur 
has spoken out against the organisation’s actions over the epidemic that 
followed Haiti’s 2010 earthquake. AsBen Quinn reports, in a scathing evaluation 
at the UN general assembly, Philip Alston condemned as“a disgrace” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/25/united-nations-expert-special-rapporteur-calls-actions-over-haiti-cholera-outbreak-2010-a-disgrace>
 the United Nations’ refusal to accept responsibility for the devastating 
cluster of cases that claimed more than 9,000 lives, after the deadly bacterium 
was brought into the country by peacekeepers relocated from Nepal.

What you said

On the opinion piece by Dean Peacock and Emily Nagisa Keehn Justice is long 
overdue for the widows of South African mineworkers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/25/justice-long-overdue-widows-south-african-mineworkers-ruling-silicosis-gold>
, thetowncrier said: 

To spend your working life in a mine searching for small pieces of metal is 
one thing. But to die for the ‘privilege’ is something else entirely. Remember 
who got rich from this business and who actually made it work. Those who end up 
in the bowels of the earth inhaling dust and noxious gases were not rewarded 
for the ‘wealth’ they created.
