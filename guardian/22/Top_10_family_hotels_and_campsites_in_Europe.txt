Casa Tomaren, Lanzarote, Canary Islands


Lanzarote is a brilliant destination for young kids, with attractions aplenty 
and funky towns set into beautiful deserty scenery that will satisfy parents’ 
lust for the exotic, all within a four-hour flight. It’s easy to drive around 
exploring otherworldly landscapes, epic beaches, seawater swimming pools, the 
volcanicTimanfaya national park <http://www.discoverlanzarote.com/timanfaya.asp>
, César Manrique’s incredible Bond villain homes and his underground caves 
development Jameos del Agua, with cafe, gardens, pools and auditorium. And 
there are dozens of easy places to eat – early. One fab place to stay is Casa 
Tomaren, handily in the centre of the island, consisting of eight villas around 
a tropical sunken garden with pool and astro turf. The big buffet breakfasts 
feature cakes, eggs to order and particularly delicious croissants. Its grounds 
have plenty to interest toddlers – buddha statues, roaming cats and cacti – and 
massages and yoga are available. The only hitch is the lack of baths, which may 
cause tears if your tot is a shower-refusenik.

This could be the perfect retreat for stressed parents who need spoiling. For 
a start, it’s in lovely Greece, but there’s no need to endure a ferry journey, 
as it’s on the mainland, with low-cost flights to Thessaloniki, 80 minutes 
away. With a juice bar beside the (heated) pool, open-air spa, calm beach, 
treehouses, hammocks, playground, restaurants or meals on demand, and secret 
coves to explore by boat, it makes for a super-relaxed break.

In the heart of Lussac-les-Châteaux, and not far from Poitiers and the 
Futuroscope <http://en.futuroscope.com/> theme park, Les Orangeries is a 
relaxed, country-style hotel that’s great for families. Cots and high chairs 
are supplied, there’s a lovely swimming pool (with floats and pool toys) and 
it’s very tolerant at mealtimes – the restaurant is quite chi-chi, but there 
are often all-generational groups of French families dining. The beautiful 
gardens offer lots of space for children to run around, hammocks to swing on, a 
pétanque pitch and a covered area (open at the sides) with vintage French toys 
and modern rocking horses. Ask for a room at the back so you’re away from the 
road. The owner will conduct tours of the vast vegetable gardens and she’s 
lovely with children (letting them pick raspberries to eat, for example).
• Doubles from €85, breakfast extra, suite (sleeps 5) from €165,

For a back-to-nature feel, family-run Casa Vicentina near Odeceixe beach in 
the Algarve is perfect. Built with ecological materials, it’s in a protected 
park area on a natural lake next to the swimming pool and the vast grounds are 
full of cork and pine groves. The feel is rustic and laid-back: there’s lots of 
space and a playground with swings and slides. Breakfast is a plentiful buffet 
– and bikes are supplied free of charge so you can pop to the beach or cafes 
and restaurants. Accommodation is in brightly decorated rooms or larger suites 
complete with kitchenette.

Older kids will love the fairytale landscape of Cappadocia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/apr/10/cappadocia-rock-churches-caves-turkey>
 and the excitement of staying in acave hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/apr/10/cappadocia-rock-churches-caves-turkey>
. Carved out of the rock, the Fairy Chimney Inn used to be part of a cave 
monastery. Its rooms are beautiful and homely, with traditional decor and the 
odd nod to the modern world (there’s Wi-Fi and underfloor heating). Its owned 
by Gülcan and Andus, a chef and an anthropologist, so you’re guaranteed good 
food and great local insight. All rooms have terraces or courtyards overlooking 
the extraordinary landscape and there’s great horse riding, hot springs and 
hiking on the doorstep.

The futuristic geodomes at Otro Mundo, a campsite in the Andalucía 
countryside, offer an outdoors experience with a comfy place to curl up at 
night (with solar-heated showers and proper beds). In the heart of the Sierra 
del Segura, it’s a great place for kids, with plenty to do – besides the large 
natural pool there are guided walks to discover cave paintings, photography 
courses, yoga and movie nights with films projected on to a stone wall. The two 
domes sit in their own plots with room for extra tents, but there’s a big 
communal kitchen, too, and group meals.

Casa San Gabriel is a small hilltop farmstead where three self-catering 
cottages (sleeping between two and six) share a swimming pool, playground and 
barbecue. There’s added excitement for young guests in the family of alpacas 
kept on site. Plus points for parents include the short journey from Perugia 
airport (25 minutes), the view to Assisi (a 30-minute drive away), the chance 
to sample the house wine and olive oil, and weekly pizza nights. There are 
several water, wildlife and activity parks nearby, and slightly further afield a

In the centre of Vigncastrisi, a tiny village 2km inland from the Salento 
coast, the delights of Palazzo Guglielmo are well hidden from the passer-by, 
behind an austere facade with a huge double wooden doors. Step over the 
threshold though and you are transported into an elegant, lush oasis with small 
pool, winding paths lined with fruit trees and a small outdoor play area. 
Breakfasts are a highlight – at least three different types of fresh cake as 
well as more usual fare – and the manager Mauro is very helpful and a mine of 
information. There are about 10 rooms but the suites are better for families – 
they’re huge and you can self-cater. Vigncastrisi itself is an authentic slice 
of southern Italian life that makes little concession to tourism and is all the 
more interesting for it. At night young and old congregate around the kiosk 
next to the hotel, where you can sit back with a €3 Aperol spitz while the kids 
play table football. There’s a great pizza place a few doors down – take away 
and bring it back to your spot by the kiosk – and several affordable, family 
restaurants in the village. In summer outdoor events: film screenings, theatre 
and the Festa dell’Orecchietta (first week of August) where the entire village 
comes out to enjoy the festivities. The coast here is gorgeous though beaches 
are mainly rocky, and the white-washed town of Otranto is about a 30-minute 
drive away.

 Loulou, the owner of Hotel Liotopi. Photograph: Kevin Rushby 
In a lovely sandy bay, right beside the promontory where Aristotle was born 
2,400 years ago, sits the small town of Olymbiada and the Hotel Liotopi. It’s 
not one of those places that offers all kinds of child diversions – clubs, 
toys, pools and so on – simply a charming, laid-back, classic family hotel. 
Owner Loulou is the grand presence, always appearing from the kitchen at 
opportune moments bearing a plate of delicious cakes or some local delicacy. 
Outside, beyond the garden, is the beach. You could sit on the terrace of 
Liotopi’s sister hotel, the Germany, run by Loulou’s brother Dmitri, and be a 
few feet from the children playing in the sea. Older kids can go off and 
explore the woods behind, or the rocky headland where Aristotle’s grave is said 
to be lost. The home-cooked food, incidentally, is superb.
