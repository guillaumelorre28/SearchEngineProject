Hot Clube de Portugal, Lisbon

Europe’s westernmost capital city has one of Europe’s oldest jazz clubs: Hot 
Clube, founded in 1948, has hosted legends such as Count Basie, Dizzy 
Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan and Dexter Gordon. And on 22 and 24 February this 
140-capacity club will host another elder statesman of jazz: 89-year-oldLou 
Donaldson <http://loudonaldson.com/>, a soulful alto sax player influenced by 
Charlie Parker. So … old, old, old. Not so. Jazz reinvents itself and so has 
Hot Clube – literally, after its original premises went up in smoke in 2009. 
Happily, it reopened three years later two doors away thanks to the support of 
Lisbon residents and businesses and the work of the association that founded it.

Its new interior style is minimalist and modern and the only heat being 
generated now is by the soloists up on its stage. Just a short walk from the 
Bairro Alto, central Lisbon, and attracting a mixed crowd of young musos, 
students, and tourists, the good times roll in this intimate space, which also 
has a terrace at the rear for a quick gasp of air. Whoever’s on – and watch out 
for Portuguese tyros such as Andre Fernandes (guitar) and Mario Laginha (piano) 
– the vibe is “This is good, we’d better listen.”

Jazz spread like wildfire in Europe in the early 1920s and Poland joined the 
swing explosion with enthusiasm, merging it with its own fiddle-based 
traditions. But the second world war put paid to all the fun. After the war, 
amid Stalin’s repression, jazz came to symbolise freedom and resistance, so in 
many ways has a greater resonance here than in the UK, say. Nowadays such is 
the audience for the genre that top US jazz acts often play several dates in 
the country. There is boundless local and national talent, such as pianistPaweł 
Kaczmarczyk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lm3dSicJpk>, who’s appearing at 
the club on 6 February, who have risen to the top at clubs such as Harris and
U-Muniaka <https://www.facebook.com/umuniaka/> in Kraków. These are small 
places (both about 70 capacity) in near-1,000-year-old brick cellars with bars 
in adjacent rooms. Harris is on the hugely atmospheric Market Square and lays 
on mainstream jazz, funk and blues, good food (international mains from £3) and 
a boisterous vibe. On many nights it’s free of charge.
• Admission €5 (€10 for name international acts), mid-week jam sessions free 
entry, beer from €2.50, booking advised at weekends, 28 Market Square, +12 421

Germany’s capital isn’t short of live music venues covering every conceivable 
genre. Its best known jazz clubs are theA Trane <http://www.a-trane.de/> and 
Zig Zag <http://www.zigzag-jazzclub.berlin/#about-marquee>, where more 
established artists feature. Less well known, and much smaller (50 capacity), 
is Donau115 in the lively Neukölln district. The club’s programme covers 
top-quality straight-ahead post-bop jazz to – in the words of part-owner Chad 
Matheny – “experimental Zappa-influenced atonal intellectual weirdos” plus the 
occasional “noisy, scrappy acoustic pop act”. So it’s not always jazz as you 
might know it. The club is based on the ground floor of a building that was 
bombed in the war; the above floors were torn down and rebuilt but the room 
Donau is in survived. With Moscow Mules at €5 and often wildly original music 
the operative word here has to bewunderbar.

Denmark’s capital has several clubs helping it maintain its reputation as a 
jazz haven; a status it gained in the 1960s, when homegrown world class stars 
such as bassist Niels Henning Ørsted Pedersen emerged. Soon, US stars like 
Coleman Hawkins, Dexter Gordon and Ben Webster became Copenhagen residents – 
black musicians worn down by their treatment at home and intrigued by the 
warmth shown to them by Scandi audiences. Jazzhus Montmartre, a non-profit 
venue supported by the government, attracts nordic greats and star 
international names, like the UK’sLiane Carroll 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WbOQcSokAY>. 
 Upcoming gigs at Montmartre include vocalist Sinne Eeg with her quartet 
The focus is on music in the centre of the jazz genre; avant garde and 
funk/rock is out of bounds here. It’s in a handsome yellow-painted building 
with large windows in the city centre. Nearby, in beautiful Nyhavn, is another 
excellent venue, the harboursideStandard Jazz Club 
<http://thestandardjazzclub.com/>, run by renowned pianist Niels Lan Doky and 
Noma co-owner Claus Meyer. The emphasis is on great food as well as jazz; 
prices are a bit steeper than Montmartre (€38, students €26) but the programme 
and the setting are outstanding.

The Verdict, Brighton

Jazz in the UK is alive and kicking beyond hallowed Ronnie Scott’s 
<http://www.ronniescotts.co.uk/>, which is often sold out and can be expensive. 
Visitors to London should head for places such as theVortex 
<http://www.vortexjazz.co.uk/>, Jazz Cafe <http://thejazzcafelondon.com/>, the 
606 <http://www.606club.co.uk/> and Streatham’s best-kept secret, the Hideaway 
<http://www.hideawaylive.co.uk/>. But the capital hasn’t got a monopoly on 
quality: two streets back from Brighton’s pier, the Verdict is not in the buzzy 
Lanes area but in the rather more austere company of the law courts (hence the 
name). However, under the direction of the enthusiastic Andy Lavender, the only 
pleading heard here is for encores. Its purpose-built basement, adorned with 
original photographs of jazz legends, seats just 60 and brims with atmosphere. 
Upstairs there’s a cafe that screens the performances. Adventurous programming 
and great acoustics are pulling in the finest UK players – people such as 
saxophonistMark Lockheart <http://marklockheart.co.uk/>, pianist Liam Noble, 
plus international names such as Portuguese guitaristVitor Pereira 
<http://vitorpereira.net/projects/> – and attracting jazz lovers from across 
the generations.

The city is identified strongly with the classical masters – Haydn, Mozart, 
Strauss – and might once have looked down its imperial nose at the likes of 
Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington. But times change and they’ve got the hang of 
syncopation and making music without the dots in central Europe these days. 
This modern club – with the ambience of a state-of-the-art mini concert hall, 
and room for 350 – has been designed to present top players to maximum 
advantage.

Few jazz clubs can claim to have had a US president perform, but Reduta 
proudly lists Bill Clinton alongside stellar names such as Wynton Marsalis, 
Cecil Taylor and Ronnie Scott among its alumni. Interesting to learn, too, that 
this club, just off Wenceslas Square, opened in 1957 at a time when 
Czechoslovakia wasn’t exactly enjoying the warm creative breeze of a liberal 
renaissance. But a commitment to jazz every night of the week (kicking off at 
around 9.30pm) and a wide programming policy with big bands, tributes to the 
legends, dixieland, latin and fusion, have ensured that tourists and locals 
alike have stoked up a buzzing atmosphere. It’s a decent size (capacity 100) 
and has a genuine jazz club vibe and good acoustics. The bar serves pilsner 
straight from a “saxophone” pump.

Jazz <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> in France is not a US import. 
There have always been plenty of indigenous sounds, such as the “gypsy jazz” 
manouche of Django Reinhardt in the 1930s, and bal-musette, with its accordion 
and violin base blended with cross-Atlantic forms. But US musos have always 
loved Paris. In fact Miles Davis jammed at this family-owned club, created in 
1983 by Michele and Jean-Marc Portet. Its two rooms each have a very different 
feel: Sunside looks like a 1950s New York while Sunset’s styling is reminiscent 
of the Paris metro.

<http://www.ducdeslombards.com/>, of similarly high renown. Considering their 
prime central locations close to Notre Dame it might be wise to book. If you 
want to dance, a short walk across the river is the cellar clubCaveau de La

The rather staid streets of Cologne’s Ehrenfeld district have become trendier 
over the years, so much so that this friendly 25-year-old club is flourishing, 
with an adventurous programme of local and international players (including 
many Brits) of impeccable credentials. Owner Hans Martin-Müller is actually a 
classical flautist with a long history of orchestral playing but his love of 
jazz, and the camaraderie of musicians, courses through this intimate space at 
the top of a nondescript residential block. It’s a lounge-in-an-attic, a place 
where audience and musicians readily mix and might even buy each other drinks. 
The jazz is modern, often purely improvisational, attracting a young, 
open-minded crowd.

Spain is passionate about all music, not just the type that involves strumming 
guitars implausibly rapidly against a backdrop of clacking castanets. Respect 
for top-quality musicianship is instinctive, and audiences are enthusiastic. 
Central has been putting on live jazz and blues since 1982 in a 19th-century 
building that previously housed a beautiful shop selling paintings, glass, 
mirrors and frames. It’s easy to imagine this, given the club’s high ceiling 
and elegant Iberian decor. Its location on Plaza del Angel puts the venue at 
the heart of the city, amid pedestrianised streets, bars, restaurants and 
shops. Musically, the focus is on mainstream and gypsy jazz with a good mix of
