While much of Australia’s wealth historically has come from the land – either 
above it or below - our vast, dry continent is famously a nation of urban 
dwellers ringing the fringe.


Our cities and larger towns house 90% of the population, mainly on the coast, 
with the state and territory capitals taking up three in five of us at the last 
census.

As economies and technologies change, the growth of cities is set to continue, 
both here and around the world, placing pressures on resources and 
infrastructure and creating a challenge to maintain sustainable living within 
our built-up urban environments.

The populations of Sydney and Melbourne are both set to be approaching 8 
million by 2050 – a growth of about a third – with Perth and Brisbane 
experiencing similar rates of expansion, according to ABS data.

In Sydney, there is already a large scale infrastructure project underway to 
help cope with the expected million extra people set to add to the population 
over the coming decade.

The state government project, branded “Tomorrow’s Sydney”, has this month 
given Sydneysiders a taste of things to come with changing bus timetables and 
routes to accommodate construction on the city’s next light rail project for 
the CBD.

But more solutions will be needed for the future for sustainable food 
production and efficient use of energy – to name just two areas of importance 
for the wellbeing of city populations.

The rise of the “megacity” – those with a population of more than 10 million – 
has been rapid – going from just two global megacities in 1950 (New York, 12.3m 
and Tokyo, 11.3m) to 24 today.

The biggest growth in the past two decades has come from the rapid 
urbanisation of populations in India and China, in places like Beijing and 
Shanghai, Mumbai and Delhi.

By 2030 the UN projects there will be 40 megacities on the planet and while 
this critical mass has the potential for opportunity, the growth will have to 
be managed.

One vision for the future being proposed is that the city of the future will 
be a connected one, with the many different elements that make them up 
“talking” to each other.

Safety and security and adequate access to healthcare and community amenity 
are all top of the agenda for city planners worldwide, with innovative programs 
likePhilips CityTouch <https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/296607083;123639560;l>
 already underway in major centres like Los Angeles, London and Buenos Aires.

CityTouch is a wireless system of connected lighting that lets administrators 
manage the city’s lighting plan online in real time, letting them dim or 
brighten streets by taking control down to a single LED.

Smart lighting systems

power by adjusting to local conditions and public need in real time.

City officials, like LA mayor Eric Garcetti, are hoping to rejuvenate the 
streets and improve public safety and local culture through using systems like 
this, which offer a real change in mood and accessibility.

There are the sustainability benefits to be had as the lights are adjusted 
according to different conditions and public need. Lights can be dimmed during 
a full moon for instance or brightened for crowd safety during major events or 
for emergency crews at traffic accidents.


The same system is having a small start here in Australia with the City of 
Okaparinga, a local government area on the southern fringe of Adelaide, 
trialling the smart lighting system.


Lucas Jordaan, from Philips Lighting, says the program, which started in April 
this year, has retrofitted 29 radio modules, all with their own GPS, to the 
existing lights at the LGA’s O’Sullivan Beach.

Jordaan says the system brings immediate energy and maintenance savings for 
the council – whenever a light goes out an alert is sent via text so repairs 
can be targeted and scheduled.

“Because it is a connected system it can immediately identify a problem,” he 
says. “You don’t have to have people driving around determining where there is 
a lighting failure.”

Future developments will see the modules equipped with individual sensors 
which can make decisions to adjust the lights on their own in much the same way 
that a laptop or phone display automatically adjusts to the ambient light.

 See how the CityTouch smart lighting system has been working in Rotterdam in 
the Netherlands. 
“Every single light will make a decision,” Jordaan says, adding that the next 
step is motion detection. “This is physically a camera – it analyses what’s 
happening. It brings the lights up as a car drives by – fades up – it brings up 
the lights gradually.”

For pedestrians it will mean lighting that comes up as you approach while it 
dims down behind you. The cameras will also be able to gain data about what is 
happening around the poles – checking for parking availability, air quality and 
for security or retail activity.

The system hopes to reduce the carbon footprint and also light pollution in 
cities of the future.

Meanwhile, LED light is also being used to provide a local and sustainable way 
to grow food in spaces indoors for urban populations.

Technical supervisor Tony Bundock from Powerplants Australia, distributors of 
Philips horticulture lighting, says he expects it will not be long before 
customers will be able to buy fresh produce, like lettuce, grown using special 
“light recipes” in rooms at the back of city supermarkets.

“It’s working out what the best light for the plant is – like you would feed a 
plant the right fertiliser,” Bundock says. “The lights have a pink or purple 
colour and the reason for this is they are a very specific wavelength.

“We are ultimately giving the plants the best possible outcome by exposing 
them to a particular spectrum of light.”

The system means plants are able to get better light in winter for a more 
regular level of production and are grown stronger for a higher yield.

“Ultimately for the growers that’s going to translate into a financial 
figure,” Bundock says.

 Indoor city farming using special light recipes to optimise growth is one way 
to feed urban populations. 
“The potential for urban farming is also you can convert any building you 
like. It takes away some of the parameters of traditional farming and is 
opening it up quite dramatically. It can be done on a small scale or a large 
scale and is the next step where we can take growing.”

One next step is being done by Australia’s Antarctic Division, which is 
preparing to use this same sort of lighting system to grow food in containers 
in that inhospitable environment.

“There’s nothing stopping you from growing it in a space station,” Bundock 
says.

Other advantages are increased biosecurity and improved control over pests, he 
says.

But for all the advances, city farming will not mean a world where plants are 
on a growth cycle 24/7.

“Like all of us the plants need a break and a rest. They need a dark period to 
activate some of their biological responses.”

For consumers, though, it will mean potentially fresher food grown locally in 
urban farms rather than being trucked in and kept in storage.

With the UN predicting the world’s population to grow by 2.5 billion by 2050 
and 70% living in cities, solutions like this will only become more important.
