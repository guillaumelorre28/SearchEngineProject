down into a valley backed by the Kamnik–Savinja Alps, this cabin in Slovenia is 
as romantic as they come. The two-bedroom house can sleep up to five and is in 
a small village in the quiet valley of Zgornje Jezersko. If you tire of hiking 
the surrounding countryside or having a barbecue with a mountain view and want 
to make the most of some of Slovenia’s classic sites, the cabin is only an 
hour’s drive from the capital Ljubljana orpostcard-pretty Lake Bled

A family home, featuring minimalist design, and surrounded by eight acres of 
pine forest, this contemporary lodge in Aragon is in a mountainous area near 
two rivers. This means there are opportunities for wild swimming, such as at 
the Balneario de Font Calda – a limestone gorge with deep natural pools. The 
local wine offers another way to relax and the house is close to the “Cathedral 
of Wine”,Pinell de Brai <http://www.pagosdehibera.com/>, a brick temple 
dedicated to the drink. The house itself is an architectural treat: a spacious, 
glass-fronted domed decorated with contemporary furniture, full of light, with 
large glass panes that let you gaze over the treetops, whether you’re having a 
meal in the cool dining room, or lazing in bed. The three-bedroom, 
three-bathroom cabin, which runs on solar energy, can comfortably accommodate 
eight.

it is also an all-year-round bolthole. In the lesser-known French resort ofLe 
Grand-Bornand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/oct/21/secret-ski-resorts-experts>,

ground floor with a small kitchen, bathroom and terrace, which could still 
house a family comfortably.

With its left-field design, the Ufogel cabin in the Austrian Alps is a 
one-of-a-kind mountain hideaway. Built from glass, metal and larch wood, the 
architecture is by Peter Jungmann and it provides a surprisingly spacious place 
to stay. It can sleep up to five and has a dining table that can seat even 
more. It is in the east Tirolian village of Nussdorf, and the cabin’s name is a 
portmanteau based on the fact it looks like a cross between a UFO and a vogel: 
the German word for bird.
