(SPOILER ALERT):

Hi Joshua,

Spoiler! Were you not a little tempted to reunite Connie and Paul?

Do you have a problem with poets?

And (hope not too personal a question) do you actually floss?

Thanks!

I love poets as long as they don't get in my way. If they get in my way, I 
kill them.

I floss nightly. Honestly. I find it an enormous pain in the balls, but I do 
it every single night.

Kantartrenitzc <http://discussion.gutools.co.uk/moderation/users/10984543/> 
asks about the philosophical nature of the novel:

Hey Joshua, I loved reading your novel. It took me two days to complete 
reading and began reading twice after my first go. I see the novel To Rise 
Again at a Decent Hour a philosophical and full of symbolic gestures, and rich 
metaphors. I want to ask how do you see it as philosophical (I mean, do you 
agree) and before beginning To Rise Again at a Decent Hour and after completing 
it, did you feel certain sense of sigh, or relief when capturing and 
reproducing human identity in more subtle, rare and beautiful images.

You're slacking, Kantartrenitzc. You could have read it at least half-a-dozen 
times by now.

You have a lot of consonants in your name.

I do see it as philosophical, I guess. I have a philosophy degree. I continue 
to read philosophy. Inevitably it sort of finds its way in. The trouble is, in 
writing fiction, it's more about expressing the problem, whereas in philosophy 
it's about articulating an answer. They're often at odds, and don't commonly 
make good bedfellows.

I gave my hygienist a copy. She didn't have much to say. But that's okay, 
because she's really one of the world's great hygienist. Hello, Danielle. Thank 
you.

Can I just say, Mari, that I really don't like the picture of me that comes up 
with every reply? I look sorta greasy & unshaved. It's disgraceful.

I've read The Narrow Road to the Deep North. That's a winner in my book. Maybe 
not the winning book. That should be ... well, this is getting awkward.

It means a hell of a lot to me. Maybe not specifically because I'm an 
American, but for all possible reasons. The writers who've been nominated in 
the past have are the best. It's an incredible thing.

Hi Joshua,

Spoiler! Were you not a little tempted to reunite Connie and Paul?

Do you have a problem with poets?

And (hope not too personal a question) do you actually floss?

Thanks!

I love poets as long as they don't get in my way. If they get in my way, I 
kill them.

I floss nightly. Honestly. I find it an enormous pain in the balls, but I do 
it every single night.
 
Kantartrenitzc <http://discussion.gutools.co.uk/moderation/users/10984543/> 
asks about the philosophical nature of the novel:

Hey Joshua, I loved reading your novel. It took me two days to complete 
reading and began reading twice after my first go. I see the novel To Rise 
Again at a Decent Hour a philosophical and full of symbolic gestures, and rich 
metaphors. I want to ask how do you see it as philosophical (I mean, do you 
agree) and before beginning To Rise Again at a Decent Hour and after completing 
it, did you feel certain sense of sigh, or relief when capturing and 
reproducing human identity in more subtle, rare and beautiful images.

You're slacking, Kantartrenitzc. You could have read it at least half-a-dozen 
times by now.

You have a lot of consonants in your name.

I do see it as philosophical, I guess. I have a philosophy degree. I continue 
to read philosophy. Inevitably it sort of finds its way in. The trouble is, in 
writing fiction, it's more about expressing the problem, whereas in philosophy 
it's about articulating an answer. They're often at odds, and don't commonly 
make good bedfellows.
