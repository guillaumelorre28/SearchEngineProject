It’s been a big week for rhinestones: first Dolly Parton joined Instagram 
<https://www.instagram.com/dollyparton/>, now Harry Styles has taken the Nudie 
Cohn <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/feb/28/popandrock.gramparsons> 
aesthetic to primetime TV, wearing a highly decorative ensemble that would not 
have looked out of place inGram Parsons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/gramparsons>’ wardrobe.

Styles never seems to be more than five metres away from a piece of elaborate 
clothing these days, having become so enamoured withnew-era Gucci under 
Alessandro Michele 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/25/milan-fashion-week-guccis-smart-revamp-ensures-brains-restore-fawn>
 that he is permanently swathed in the brand’s fancy fabric.

A fortnight ago, Twitter decided that a floral white-and-grey ensemble he wore 
to the American Music awards made him look exactly likeIkea’s Alvine Kvist 
bedspread 
<http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/11/sleeping-with-harry-styles-just-got-easier.html>
 (and they had a point). His X Factor final look –number 38 from Gucci’s 
autumn/winter 2015 catwalk, to be precise 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2015-ready-to-wear/gucci/slideshow/collection#38>
 – has drawn comparisons with a pair ofcaravan curtains

Actually, in fashion terms, Styles is bang on trend – and not just because 
Gucci is easily the most in-demand label of the moment. By sticking to suits in 
the Nudie Cohn ilk, he is making quite a statement. To be clear, no rhinestones 
were actually harmed in the making of Styles’ suit – but its cut, swirl and 
pattern are pure rocker-cowboy.

After all, Cohn was “the man who made cowboys love rhinestones 
<http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/meet-the-man-who-made-cowboys-love-rhinestones/>
”, dressing Johnny Cash, John Lennon andElvis Presley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/elvispresley> in gold lamé. He created what 
Jon Ronson described as “the Sistine Chapel ceiling of cowboy attire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/feb/28/popandrock.gramparsons>” – Gram 
Parsons’ suit of drug references, religious iconography and naked women, worn 
on the cover ofThe Gilded Palace of Sin 
<http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0000/014/MI0000014522.jpg?partner=allrovi.com>
. If this is an early sign of Styles’ bid to become “the rock one” post-One 
Direction, whileZayn Malik owns R&B 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/zayn-malik>, he couldn’t be dropping any 
more pertinent hints.
