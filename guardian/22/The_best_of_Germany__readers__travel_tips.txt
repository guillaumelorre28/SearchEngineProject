Winning tip: Idyllic camping in the Black Forest


Last summer, while travelling around Germany by car, we discovered a real 
hidden gem – Camping Zur Mühle, near Wolfach in the Black Forest. Our tent was 
perched high on a hill, with views of grazing deer to accompany the fresh bread 
delivered each morning. Stunning forest walks straight from the tent and a 
short drive to Triberg for gushing waterfalls and the original Black Forest 
gateau. Perfection.

Bayerisch Eisenstein’s railway station straddles the border with the Czech 
Republic, with a ticket office in each country. Trains now run between Munich 
and Prague but the line was disconnected during the cold war, when barbed wire 
and watchtowers took its place. Nato listening posts lie dormant now, high on 
the 1,500-metre Großer Arber mountain, near a small memorial to the Sudeten 
Germans. The town sits next to the Bavarian forest, and adjoining the Bohemian 
forest, which together constitute one of the greatest areas of protected nature 
in Europe, including the largest area of wilderness between the Atlantic and 
the Urals. Nature, history, fabulous public transport and the chance to walk 
across national borders: they are all here. Just remember to bring a German 
phrasebook as English-speaking visitors are few and far between.

 Becketts Kopf bar 
Becketts Kopf is the coolest bar I’ve been in. It looks like the set of a 
David Lynch film – low lit, moody and decorated with red velvet drapes. A 
massive picture of Samuel Beckett adorns one wall. The cocktails are strong and 
made to be savoured, exactly as they should be. Plus, with the menu written in 
German only, it was fun not knowing what I was getting.

Trier, in Rhineland-Palatinate, is Germany’s oldest town and dotted with Roman 
arches and churches. Stroll across a stone bridge over the Moselle river and 
down to an amphitheatre where the ancient Bread and Games festival takes place 
in September, featuring music, dancing and splendidly illuminated contests. 
Local wine and beer is drunk in cafes in the pretty town square full of 
timbered framed houses. Stay at thebeautifully located youth hostel

One of the highlights of any München trip would be a train ride out to 
Herrsching, 40km to south-west. A short walk up to the Andechs Kloster 
monastery is a brilliant experience. Here, with views of the Alps on a clear 
day, you can enjoy Bavarian food and plenty of the monks’ brew, which combines 
Benedictine brewing traditions with the latest techniques. You can also visit 
beautiful Ammersee lake while there.

Germans love the variety and scenic trails of the spectacular Saxon 
Switzerland national park near Dresden. It’s a lose-yourself, multi-coloured 
surreal landscape of pristine white limestone peaks, lush verdant meadows, 
dense woodland and crystal clear streams centred around the rushing, twisting 
path of the Elbe river. Entry is free and there are 400km of signposted tracks 
for all abilities and energy levels.

From 23 September to 9 October 2016, visit the amazing Cannstatter Volksfest 
in Stuttgart. It is one of the biggest funfairs in Europe and a perfect family 
holiday experience. Get there for the first Sunday of the festival to witness 
the Volksfest parade with horse-drawn brewery wagons, and loads of traditional 
costumes, bands and people just having fun. This is the real Germany, loud and 
proud and unashamedly German. The atmosphere is amazing, the food is incredible 
and the beer is superb.

 Neuschwanstein castle. Photograph: Alamy 
King Ludwig II’s fairytale castles (Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau) in 
Fussen will leave you with magical memories. I spent the day on a guided tour 
of the castles’ opulent interiors learning about King Ludwig’s fascinating 
life, then rounded the evening off with a concert at the Musical Theatre. This 
is on the beautiful Lake Forggensee, with a spectacular view of the castle 
across the water. Neuschwanstein was the setting for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang 
and was also in the Great Escape. An almost perfect day was only slightly 
marred when I ordered what ought to have been a vegetarian pea soup, in a 
restaurant below the castles, to find it came with two large sausages plonked 
in it.

In the depths of the Grunewald forest on the outskirts of Berlin (where wild 
boar are often seen) is an abandoned cold war relic turned street art haven. At 
the end of the second world war, 12 million cubic metres of war rubble was 
dumped on top of a Nazi military college. This formed the tallest hill in 
Berlin known as Teufelsberg (Devil’s mountain). Perched on top of this mountain 
is an abandoned US National Security Agency spy station amid abundant street 
art on the crumbling walls and canvas radomes. Climb the imposing 80-metre 
domed towers for the best views of the Berlin skyline. Several companies offer 
tours.

 Naumburg Cathedral. Photograph: Alamy 
Visit the vineyards around the confluence of the Saale and Unstrut rivers, 
straddling Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. This little-known gem of east Germany 
is heaving with history, beautiful rolling landscapes and excellent wines. 
Among the highlights are Naumburg, with its Romanesque cathedral, an important 
stop on the Anhalt/Thurinigian Romanesque road. Take a small detour to 
Schulpforta, Germany’s oldest boarding school (in a 12th-century Cistercian 
monastery), whose gothic cloisters witnessed the education of Nietzsche, 
Leopold von Ranke and Möbius. Don’t forget to take in the fruits of Europe’s 
most northerly wine region – any localweingut (vineyard) will be delighted to 
let you sample as many wines as you can handle, with Weingut Heft offering a 
fine view across the valley. The final bonus of a holiday in east Germany is 
the cost – prices for accommodation and restaurants are closer to those in 
Poland than in western Germany.
