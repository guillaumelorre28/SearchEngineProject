“Craig Green” has become the cliched answer to the question: “What is 
brilliant inBritish menswear right now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/06/craig-green-diy-masculinity-spring-summer-2015>
”. Cliched largely because it’s true. His padded judo-inspired tops with 
cropped trousers and flowing straps have become cult items on the menswear 
front row – for both male and female fashion fans. As recognition of his female 
fanbase, Green put women on his catwalk, too. For a designer who regularly 
shows whimsical structures on his catwalk, this was a seamless, commercially 
minded move that felt more respectful than cynical. So what do those breast 
portholes with the scarf flowing through mean? “The breasts? We were looking at 
symbols of power,” explains Green. Boudicca would have loved it.
