Distance 32 miles/51km
Total climbing 2,546ft/776m
Moderate. Mostly on traffic-free former railway path with a loop on hilly lanes
Start/finish Okehampton
The 11-mile Granite Way 
<http://www.visitdartmoor.co.uk/things-to-do/the-granite-way-cycle-route-p250623>
 from Okehampton to Lydford is a spectacular rails-to-trails cycleway that 
passes within three miles of High Willhays, the highest point in Dartmoor and 
the highest place in England south of the Peak District. There are fine views 
not least from its magnificent Victorian viaducts. This ride adds to the 
pleasures of the Granite Way with a loop of lovely (and hilly) lanes taking in 
Brent Tor, one of western Dartmoor’s most iconic landmarks. A mile out of 
Okehampton is the Meldon Viaduct, a gently curved, tottering Victorian lattice 
of wrought and cast iron 150ft above the West Okement river. A few miles on is 
Lake Viaduct with its stately granite arches. The rail trail ends at Lydford, a 
pretty Dartmoor village that was an important seat of power in Saxon and Norman 
times. Its castle and fortifications are free to explore whileLydford Gorge 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lydford-gorge>, which has a 30m-high 
waterfall, is free for National Trust members. It’s a steady climb up to Brent 
Tor, an extinct volcano topped by a 14th-century chapel. A descent through 
Chillaton leads to a bridge over the river Lyd. The last big climb is onto 
Galford Down, from where there are fine views to Dartmoor’s highest tors. The 
return journey follows the Granite Way back to Okehampton.

Distance 28 miles/45km
Total climbing 2,152ft/656m
Moderate to challenging, includes a section on a good gravel path
Start/finish Newton Abbot
This ride makes use of the Stover Trail 
<http://www.exploredevon.info/activities/cycle/stover-trail/>, a new, largely 
traffic-free cycling and walking route between Newton Abbot and Bovey Tracey 
along the route of the old canal and tramway – built to carry china clay dug 
from the Teign valley and granite quarried from Dartmoor. Bovey Tracey is a 
pretty town on the edge of Dartmoor and is the home of theDevon Guild of 
Craftsmen <http://www.crafts.org.uk/>, an acclaimed showcase for contemporary 
craft and design in an enormous Victorian watermill. From here the route is 
uphill on National Cycle Route 272 to Ilsington, then across to Haytor Vale. In 
September this year theTour of Britain returns to Haytor 
<http://www.tourofbritain.co.uk/news/14384.php#.VxdZCzYrJyo> with a finish at 
the foot of the famous rocks. Rather than following the main road to 
Widdecombe, the ride continues on a back road across Haytor Down to Manaton. To 
begin there are views across the Teign valley to the coast before plunging into 
dark, enchanting woodland. After crossing the river Bovey it’s a steep climb 
and then a long descent into Lustleigh in the Wrey valley. There are plans for 
a cycle track up the valley to Moretonhampstead, following the old railway 
line, but for now it’s lanes most of the way, picking up the trail a couple of 
miles upstream of Bovey Tracey, for a welcome flat route all the way back to 
Newton Abbot that retraces the route from earlier in the day.


Pub stop The Cleave, Lustleigh (01647 277223, thecleavelustleigh.uk.com 
<http://www.thecleavelustleigh.uk.com/>), is a thatched village pub with garden 
and good-quality local food.

Distance 24 miles/38km

Easy to moderate. Cycle paths, country lanes, including one section on an 
unsurfaced cycle path
Start/finish Exeter
The Exe Estuary Trail 
<http://www.exploredevon.info/activities/cycle/exe-estuary-trail/> between 
Exeter and Exmouth opened in 2015 and is rightly extremely popular, but there’s 
also excellent riding to be had by following the river Exe upstream, through 
the aptly named Hidden Valley. This route is mostly on quiet lanes through 
small villages with a couple of short, sharp hills thrown in. The route crosses 
the Exe at Thorverton where there’s been a bridge since 1307. East of the Exe 
the route crosses the floodplain to Netherexe and over the mainline of the 
Great Western Railway. The 16th-centurychapel of Columbjohn 
<https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/killerton/trails/columbjohn-walk> sits beside 
the river Culm and there are good paddling spots nearby. From here the route 
makes a loop of the landscaped grounds ofKillerton Park 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/killerton>, once the country seat of the 
powerful Acland family and now one of the National Trust’s largest estates. The 
cycle route includes unsurfaced sections but it’s well worth it, especially in 
late spring for the shimmering displays of bluebells. It’s then along some very 
quiet, narrow farm lanes to Redhayes bridge, the stunning £3.75m 
cycling-and-walking bridge across the M5. After a short distance along the 
narrow, tall-hedged Hollow Lane you reappear into Exeter and can follow the 
well-signposted E3 cycle route along backstreets into the city centre.

Distance 40 miles/65km
Total climbing 3,740ft/1,140m
Challenging. Country lanes, includes some tough hills
Start/finish Barnstaple
When it comes to hills, Exmoor lanes take a very direct approach: no gentle 
traverses to ease the gradient, just straight up, sometimes as steep as 25%. 
But once you are on top the views can be spectacular and so it’s worth trying 
to maintain altitude for as long as possible. This challenging ride does 
exactly that by taking in one of the best ridge roads in the West Country, if 
not all Britain. Starting at sea level in Barnstaple, it’s an undulating climb 
on the farm lanes ofNational Cycle Route 3 
<http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-3> to Bratton Fleming. Things 
soon get serious with a tough climb onto Shoulsbarrow Common, beneath the 
ramparts of an iron-age hill fort. Having gained the ridge half of Exmoor much 
of mid-Devon is laid out before you in a glorious tapestry. The next six miles 
is an unforgettable ride on the roof of north Devon and to top it all there’s a 
pub just by the turn for the thrilling descent into North Molton. The last big 
climb up Brayley Hill will more than warm the legs up before the ride rejoins 
the route from earlier in the day for the descent to Barnstaple.

Pub stop The Sportsman’s Inn (01643 831109, sportsmansinn.co.uk 
<http://www.sportsmansinn.co.uk/>) is a traditional country pub high up on 
Exmoor.

 The town of Totnes. Photograph: Alamy 
Distance 19 miles/31km
Total climbing 2,079ft/634m
Moderate. Quiet country lanes, fairly hilly, includes two sections on 
unsurfaced paths
Start/finish Totnes
The crumpled topography of the South Hams makes for cycling that’s rarely easy 
going but always rewarding, with a new vista over every hill and narrow, 
hedge-lined lanes alive with flowers, birds and insects. From Totnes,National 
Cycle Route 2 <http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-2> is a partially 
traffic-free route along the river Dart into the grounds ofDartington Hall 
<https://www.dartington.org/>. Soon enough it’s into the lanes, along a fine 
ridge road with huge views on either side. Daffodils line the verges around 
Rattery and the lambs should be audible from behind the hedgerows. This is a 
landscape defined by farming, and not just crops and livestock: a large solar 
energy farm near Diptford has raised eyebrows with a local MP describing the 
fields filled with shimmering photovoltaic panels as an “industrialised desert 
<http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Minister-pledges-new-solar-farm-guidelines/story-19511879-detail/story.html>
”. Still, it’s an impressive sight and a glimpse into a techno-pastoral future. 
The next section follows the valley of the river Harbourne along a beautiful 
lane that bursts with wildflowers before a typically steep Devon climb up to 
Ashprington. There are more great views of the river Dart on Cycle Route 2 
through the grounds ofSharpham House <http://www.sharphamtrust.org/> and back 
beside the river to Totnes. The cycle path is unsurfaced but generally good, 
though it can get muddy after heavy rain. There is a lanes alternative but it’s 
not quite so scenic.
