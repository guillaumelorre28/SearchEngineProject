Chidyamakondo high school, near Masvingo in southern Zimbabwe 
<http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/zimbabwe>, has won the national girls’ 
football championships three years in a row. But that cherished record – and 
far, far more – is now at risk.

“Students are fainting, struggling to concentrate in lessons, dropping out of 
school … we’re having to shorten our assemblies and cut back on sport,” says 
headteacher Morrison Musorowegomo.

“Some of our players would rather leave the school and get married, or they 
will simply stay in the villages because they have no food.”

Southern Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> is suffering the 
consequences of perhaps the worst drought in 35 years, and pupils at 
Chidyamakondo are bearing the brunt of it. Four of the football team’s best 
players have stopped coming to school because they need to help their families 
find food. The dropout rate fluctuates but is currently averaging 10%.

The problem, though, does not stop here. In March, the World Food Programme 
warned thatalmost 16 million people were already food insecure in southern 
Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/16/drought-high-temperatures-el-nino-36m-people-africa-hunger>
. Last week, this figure was raised to 31.6 millionby the Southern Africa Food 
and Nutrition Security Working Group 
<https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Documents/OCHA_ElNino_Overview_13Apr2016.pdf>
 (pdf). One of the strongest El Niño weather events ever recorded is partly to 
blame: the UN has warned that its severity has “overwhelmed” many countries. It 
has caused severe droughts and floods in southern Africa, andhunger crises 
elsewhere

At Chidyamakondo, an otherwise thriving school with immaculate grounds, the 
devastating effects of the drought are all too clear. “It’s very difficult to 
teach hungry children,” says Musorowegomo.

“In classes the [attention] span is very small, and you find the kids run to 
the tap to get water. It’s not that they are thirsty – no, they are hungry, 
they want to have something in their tummies, so their learning has been 
greatly affected by drought.

“The majority of these kids go hungry the whole day. If at all, they are going 
to get a meal at night – they will be very lucky to do so.” He points to a
marula tree <http://www.krugerpark.co.za/africa_marula.html> that has become an 
unofficial canteen.

“You would find our kids gathered around that tree eating the fruits. That is 
their lunch. The situation is really bad.”

The pressures of hunger tend to affect girls and boys differently. Girls 
become vulnerable to being coerced into sex for food or cash.

“Boys, they go for gold panning, and some will skip the border to South Africa 
<http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/africa>,” says Musorowegomo.

Nineteen-year-old Prudence Zurumba plays in the football team. Currently 
studying literature, history and divinity A-levels, she wants to be a lawyer – 
if her parents can find the funds to get her through university. Things, she 
says, are “very difficult” both on and off the pitch.

“If a pupil comes to school hungry, they won’t have that power to do the 
session and maybe some of them would have to be sent back home,” she says. 
“Even if we are the champions we face difficulties to achieve that.”

Bernard Hadzirabwi, the administrator for Chivi, the district in which the 
school lies, says the impact of the drought in the community is widespread.

“People have not been able to plant. There is virtually nothing in most of the 
fields. As far as the food security situation is concerned, in the district, we 
can talk of between 33% and 40% affected as of March, and that percentage is 
expected to rise … because we really received very little rainfall.”

Chivi is also dealing with a shortage of drinking water. “We have very little 
surface water so people for domestic use and their livestock rely on borehole 
water. Out of the little rains we’ve received, the water tables have gone 
further down, so most boreholes are no longer yielding any water.”

Pastures are visibly poor, riverbeds are dry and livestock run down. Goats and 
especially cattle are one of the core means of surviving here.

“Some people have been trying to have supplementary livestock feeding but it’s 
now really very difficult for them to buy food plus livestock feed. Now the 
livestock is dying and people cannot dispose of their livestock to buy food,” 
says Hadzirabwi.

 Opposition MP Juliana Lunguzi. Photograph: Henry Makiwa/World Vision UK 
In Malawi, vulnerable to a noxious combination of drought and flooding, there 
is little time to waste. President Mutharika appealed last week for1.2m tonnes 
of maize 
<http://www.malawianwatchdog.com/2016/04/13/malawi-pres-peter-mutharika-declares-state-of-national-disaster/>
, saying some people would need aid for all of this year and into 2017.

Agriculture is critical to the country, making up a third of the economy and 
providing livelihoods for 80% of the16.7 million 
<http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/malawi> population.


Juliana Lunguzi, from the Malawi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/malawi> 
Congress opposition party and member of parliament for Dedza East, illustrates 
the scale of the catastrophe.

“In two villages, where kids were left at home, where the mother went to look 
for food, they ended up eating some plants and they died,” she says. “They ate 
that something because there was no food. I’m just reporting [it] as it is, the 
extent of the hunger. It’s a disaster.”

UK 
Annie Namakhwa, 36, is a single mother of four living in Neno district. Her 
home is surrounded by wilting crops and she is struggling to feed her children.

“Last year the floods affected the maize so severely, you can see over that 
side my house collapsed with the floods. We were camping at the school until I 
was able to come up with the new structure.”

In the past, says Namakhwa, no matter how bad things got, neighbours would 
rally around those most in need.

“Now even that neighbour is also hungry and we are all facing the same 
challenge.”

With her four goats already gone to pay for her elder daughter’s education, 
Namakhwa is running out of contingencies and adopting more desperate measures.

“I was registered in the food aid programme but we don’t know when we’ll be 
receiving the next food ration. Sometimes it’s been about going into the 
garden, even just into the bush, to look for any vegetables. As long as we have 
salt, that’s been what’s been turning out to be food.”

Thabani Maphosa, partnership leader for Food Assistance within World Vision, 
warns that time is running out: “I think we have a challenge of staying power, 
both from the communities’ perspective sometimes and from the donors’ as well.”

Beyond the immediate vulnerability, the longer term impacts are worrying, too.

Before this latest crisis, according to Virginia Kachigunda, deputy director 
for school health and nutrition, Malawi had begun to make small improvements to 
its significant stunting levels –nearly half of all children under five are 
stunted <http://www.unicef.org/malawi/children.html>. The associated cognitive 
impairments and socio-economic consequences threaten to blight further 
generations.

“People should be reached with support, because people should eat. Food is a 
human rights issue,” says Kachigunda. “We are really at a point where we need 
support. This is a situation which will eventually recycle poverty in these 
families. It’s a serious problem.”

Fombe is a particularly beautiful region further along the Shire River valley, 
between Chikwawa and the Majete national park, which sufferedthe brunt of last 
year’s flooding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/30/malawi-floods-grim-legacy-death-destruction-devastation>
 and where fertile soil has been washed away leaving a cover of sand. Here, 
communities show the broth they are living off, made of unripe watermelons.
