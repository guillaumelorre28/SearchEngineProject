Renate <http://www.renate.cc> is one of my favourite clubs. It’s an old 
mansion in the Berlin district of Friedrichshain, with baroque fireplaces, 
mirrored ceilings and a massive garden. Now it’s a club with lots of rooms and 
different DJs and bars, though it really does feel like a house party. We went 
there a few times when recording our second album, War Room Stories, in the 
city. It’s a lot like Pikes hotel in Ibiza, except the music is more all over 
the place, which is fairly normal for Berlin.

It’s amazing what a varied experience you can have – we chilled in the 
gardens, found a maze in the cellar that you can get stuck in for hours, then 
discovered a tiny, weird little room playing minimal techno, and eventually 
went into the main room where the music was insanely loud and people were 
dancing like absolute nutters.

The following day we cycled to the studio and the place was still going. They 
start on Friday night, and only turn the music off Monday lunchtime.

One night I lost my phone somewhere in the club. Amazingly, the next day my 
band members received a text from my phone, saying “Hey, we found your friend’s 
phone and handed it in to the owners. Go and pick it up!”. I think that sums up 
the warmth of the place and the people, but also explains how very “Berlin” 
Renate is.
