On stage, Laurie appeared to take aim at President-elect Donald Trump as he 
joked that he was collecting the award from the Hollywood Foreign Press 
Association at the “last ever Golden Globes”.

“I don’t mean to be gloomy,” he said. “It’s just it has ‘Hollywood’, ‘foreign’ 
and ‘press’ in the title. To some Republicans even the word ‘association’ is 
slightly sketchy.

“I accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere.”

Stockport-born Foy

tribute to the Queen. “I really wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for some 
extraordinary women, one is Queen Elizabeth II,” she said on stage.

John Lithgow as Sir Winston Church and Matt Smith as the Duke of Edinburgh, was 
also named best television drama series.

Aaron Taylor Johnson took the number of British awards to six with his 
surprise win for best supporting actor in a movie for his portrayal of a 
psychopathic drifter in Tom Ford’s Nocturnal Animals.

The British actor, 26, dedicated his gong to his wife, film-maker Sam 
Taylor-Johnson, 49, who he described as his “soul mate”. “I want to thank my 
wife for being there with me and supporting me,” he said on stage. “Thank you 
for putting up with me. Jesus, I was not very pleasant in this role.”

La La Land continued its seemingly unstoppable charge toward the Oscars with a 
record-breaking night.It won seven award 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/08/golden-globes-2017-la-la-land-moonlight-meryl-streep>
s including best acting awards for Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone and best 
director for Damien Chazelle, but Moonlight – which had been snubbed throughout 
the evening – took home best picture drama.

But the standout moment of the evening came away from the awards action. Meryl 
Streep’s searing critique of Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/08/meryl-streep-golden-globes-speech-donald-trump>
’s imitation and treatment of the disabled New York Times journalistSerge 
Kovaleski 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-mock-new-york-times-reporter-disability>
 was a sobering moment which brought a stunned silence to the usually 
boisterous Globes.
