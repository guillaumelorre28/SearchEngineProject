An interview with Jerry Lewis, the comedian best known for his collaborations 
with Dean Martin, has become the Hollywood Reporter’smost-watched video 
<https://twitter.com/janicemin/status/811613316380430336> ever, three days 
after it was first posted.

The Reporter prides itself on its access to A-listers, with its round-table 
discussions between awards season contenders pushed particularly hard as 
multimedia content. The Lewis interview, however, effortlessly trounced them 
all, taking more than 1.2m page views in a single day.

Lewis was interviewed by the trade magazine in Las Vegas, as part of a special 
edition <http://features.hollywoodreporter.com/creative-until-you-die/> 
focusing on performers still working in their 10th decade.

Throughout the encounter, Lewis is aggressively monosyllabic and contemptuous. 
He refuses to acknowledge that there are any differences between working now 
and in the past, and even between 1947 Vegas and the city in 2016, and will not 
repeat any anecdotes or speak about forthcoming projects. He mimics the laugh 
of the interviewer, Andy Lewis, and is actively rude as the audience is wrapped 
up.

His attitude, said the interviewer, was ascribable to irritation at a photo 
shoot which had preceded filming.

“He looked angry,” said Lewis. “I already knew Lewis’s reputation for being 
difficult and acerbic … And he’s a well-known control freak.

“Throughout the photo shoot, [he] complained about the amount of equipment in 
the house, the number of assistants and how the shots were set up. By the time 
we sat down for the interview about an hour later, Lewis had worked up a full 
head of steam, and it seemed like he was punishing THR by doing the interview 
but being as uncooperative as possible.”


Fellow comedians included Jerry Seinfeld and Josh Gad have backed up the 
90-year-old on social media.

The level of disillusioned anger, dismissal, and flat out 90 year old disgust 
on display is heroic.https://t.co/yivF03ZhsP <https://t.co/yivF03ZhsP>

And Sarah Palin also expressed empathy with Lewis.

Sums up how I feel when I sit down for an interview. I'm jealous of Jerry!
