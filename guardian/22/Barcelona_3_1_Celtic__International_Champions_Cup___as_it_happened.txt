Well that was half a football game, half a bunch of people running around

Cheers for reading, you doughty lot. See you soon.

89 mins: Well as a spectacle, this second half has basically been pointless.

while they ran around to get their fitness up a bit.

79 mins: Cifti does well to win the ball fairly high up the pitch and slips it 
to Dembele, but the young lad doesn’t quite get the ball out of his feet to 
either shoot or play Cifti, racing down the left side of the box, back in.

74 mins: It’s a fine production line that Barca have here, but it’s also a bit 
weird. They’re basically cranking out loads of different versions of the same 
player: small, mobile, technically splendid, can pass the arse off the thing. 
Do you think when their mums come to pick them up they sometimes take the wrong 
one home?

67 mins: Most of the Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>

65 mins: Camara, one of the few players who started the game and is still

misidentified as Gordon a few minutes ago. Sorry.

Sub time! The second half is imminent and Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are making some seven changes, 
among them Tom Rogic for Scott Brown and Moussa Dembele for Leigh Griffiths, 
the young striker just signed from Fulham. Rather absurdly, the lino is 
introducing all of them one-by-one, showing the numbers too the crowd. Just, 
y’know, get on with it, yeah?

Here’s the Celtic team for the second half:
Celtic Football Club (@celticfc) 
CELTIC v @FCBarcelona <https://twitter.com/FCBarcelona> second-half: Fasan;

A sub for Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> too, with 
Sergi Samper replacing that blonde lad they’ve got up front. Messi can take a 
rest for the remainder of the afternoon.

Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are 3-1 ahead which 
reflects the gulf in class, but perhaps doesn’t reflect the balance of play 
particularly well. Celtic have largely held their own rather well, pressing 
high and not letting this makeshift Barca defence take their time over anything.

45 mins: Messi almost plays a perfect through-ball to Luis Suarez, but it’s 
smuggled behind for a corner. Denis Suarez swings it over, it’s headed clear 
and that should probably be that for the half.

43 mins: No wonder Barca have invested in their defence this summer: Mathieu 
continues his lumbering buffoon act by almost falling over the ball, giving 
Roberts a chance to break towards goal in space. Alas, he’s so left-footed that 
rather than running into the room out right, he cuts back inside and tries to 
play in Griffiths, but to be fair to the old boy Mathieu stomps back and gets a 
toe on it, denying theCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
forward.

GOAL! Celtic 1-3 Barcelona (Munir 40)

Lovely goal. Messi plays an effortless long pass from right to left out to 
Camara, who slips in Suarez towards the byline and he cuts back to the edge of 
the six-yard box, where Munir is waiting to stick the ball into an empty net.

close  
Well that was half a football game, half a bunch of people running around 
slightly pointlessly. But that’s pre-season friendlies for you, and nobody 
expected to learn a damn thing. Still, even at about quarter pace, this Barca 
lot are bloody good.

Cheers for reading, you doughty lot. See you soon. 
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. 
 
90 mins: Half chance for Christie, latching onto a pass from Rogic but his 
shot is cleared, then rebounds off him and goes out for a goal-kick.
 
89 mins: Well as a spectacle, this second half has basically been pointless. 
Not that this is a surprise, or that either team should have done anything 
else, but they might as well have just told everyone to go home at the break 
while they ran around to get their fitness up a bit.
 
87 mins: The closest we’ve had to a goal in a while - Alfaro gets down the 
right, slides in a low cross where a phalanx of identical Barca infants are 
waiting at the far post, but newCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> signing Kristoffer Ajer is there 
to clear the thing from danger.
 
84 mins: The bandy-legged Mujica jinks towards goal and shoots from range, but 
that wasn’t troubling anything but the ballboys behind the goal.
 
82 mins: Armstrong wins the ball well in midfield and slips it to Rogic, 
running toward the edge of the box and he takes a shot, but drags his 
left-footed effort wide.
 
80 mins: Free-kick around 25 out for Cifti, just to the left of centre, but he 
whips it over the wall and...well over.
 
79 mins: Cifti does well to win the ball fairly high up the pitch and slips it 
to Dembele, but the young lad doesn’t quite get the ball out of his feet to 
either shoot or play Cifti, racing down the left side of the box, back in.
 
77 mins: Three more changes for Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, as they introduce three more 
Stepford children to replace the others, while Celtic replace Izaguirre with 
Darnell Fisher. 47,000 in attendance. Impressive.
 
75 mins: Half-chance for Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>, 
in a rare foray into enemy territory, as Armstrong takes a swing at the ball 
but his shot is straight at the keeper.
 
74 mins: It’s a fine production line that Barca have here, but it’s also a bit 
weird. They’re basically cranking out loads of different versions of the same 
player: small, mobile, technically splendid, can pass the arse off the thing. 
Do you think when their mums come to pick them up they sometimes take the wrong 
one home?
 
72 mins: It’s just a possession exercise for Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> now, as they ferry the ball up 
and down the right flank seemingly just to amuse themselves. It’s Barca v some 
semi-mobile green and white cones.
 
70 mins: Munir clips the ball down the line for Alena, it finds its way back 
to him and he shoots, left-footed from the inside left channel, but it flies 
well wide and over.
 
67 mins: Most of the Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>
 team now look like a school XI, but they’re still keeping the ball jealously. 
It’s almost as if they’re all told a specific style of play from a young age, 
eh?
 
65 mins: Camara, one of the few players who started the game and is still 
plugging away out there, tries to chip Faran from about 45 yards out, on the 
left, but it fades away and goes wide of the post.
 
64 mins: Thank you, social media...
Celtic Football Club (@celticfc) 
63 - Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> subs: ON - Ralston, 
McCart and Christie. OFF - Janko, Ambrose and Forrest. [1-3]

<https://twitter.com/celticfc/status/759455614158401536>  
63 mins: And now three more for Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>. Apologies for not listing them 
all, but it is getting slightly stupid. Forrest and Ambrose are of.
 
61 mins: ...for Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> 
make six changes, one of which is to remove Luis Suarez on the hour mark.
 
60 mins: Chance for Barca, as Denis Suarez finds his namesake on the left side 
of the box, but his left-footed shot is dragged well, well wide of the post. 
And that’ll be his last action of the game...
 
59 mins: Cifti shows some nifty footwork to get down the left and towards the 
byline, but his clipped cross into the middle is headed clear.
 
57 mins: Chance for Denis Suarez, as Barca break healthily down the right, but 
while he strikes his effort truly, it’s straight at the keeper Fasan. Who I 
misidentified as Gordon a few minutes ago. Sorry.
 
56 mins: Not that it was an enormously high-octane encounter before, but the 
pace has been notably slower since the break.
 
54 mins: Another chance for Barca, as the Suarezs exchange passes inside the 
Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> penalty area, but in the 
end Luis is crowded out and Izaguirre hoofs the thing clear.
 
52 mins: Forrest, having switched flanks to now play on the right, cuts inside 
and shifts the ball back to Rogic on the edge of the area, but he drags his 
shot wide of the post.
 
50 mins: Munir breaks towards goal, through the middle with Luis Suarez to his 
right, but he instead goes for the shot, it hits Janko on the back and is 
easily saved by Gordon.
 
48 mins: Cifti has another chance to shoot after some neat work around the 
edge of the Barca box, but he tries to beat one man too many and has to turn 
back, taking the sting out of the attack rather.
 
46 mins: And we’re away. Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
nearly pull one back straight away, as Izaguirre crosses for Dembele, he lays 
it back and Nadir Cifti shoots, but just wide of the post.
 
Sub time! The second half is imminent and Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are making some seven changes, 
among them Tom Rogic for Scott Brown and Moussa Dembele for Leigh Griffiths, 
the young striker just signed from Fulham. Rather absurdly, the lino is 
introducing all of them one-by-one, showing the numbers too the crowd. Just, 
y’know, get on with it, yeah?

Here’s the Celtic team for the second half:
Celtic Football Club (@celticfc) 
CELTIC v @FCBarcelona <https://twitter.com/FCBarcelona> second-half: Fasan; 
Izaguirre, Ambrose, Ajer, Janko; Allan, Rogic, Armstrong, Forrest; Ciftci, 
Dembele.

<https://twitter.com/celticfc/status/759451066605895680> 
A sub for Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> too, with 
Sergi Samper replacing that blonde lad they’ve got up front. Messi can take a 
rest for the remainder of the afternoon.

(Although that was a pretty honking miskick. Still - ZLATAN!)
 
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are 3-1 ahead which 
reflects the gulf in class, but perhaps doesn’t reflect the balance of play 
particularly well. Celtic have largely held their own rather well, pressing 
high and not letting this makeshift Barca defence take their time over anything.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins: Messi almost plays a perfect through-ball to Luis Suarez, but it’s 
smuggled behind for a corner. Denis Suarez swings it over, it’s headed clear 
and that should probably be that for the half.
 
43 mins: No wonder Barca have invested in their defence this summer: Mathieu 
continues his lumbering buffoon act by almost falling over the ball, giving 
Roberts a chance to break towards goal in space. Alas, he’s so left-footed that 
rather than running into the room out right, he cuts back inside and tries to 
play in Griffiths, but to be fair to the old boy Mathieu stomps back and gets a 
toe on it, denying theCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
forward.
 
Lovely goal. Messi plays an effortless long pass from right to left out to 
Camara, who slips in Suarez towards the byline and he cuts back to the edge of 
the six-yard box, where Munir is waiting to stick the ball into an empty net.
