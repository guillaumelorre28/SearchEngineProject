For more than two centuries, the Paris neighbourhood of Bercy was dedicated to 
wine and filled with warehouses andguinguettes 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinguette> where Parisians partied at weekends. 
Most of these were razed in the 1980s and 90s to make way for office blocks and 
a park, one of thegrands projets of former president François Mitterrand. But 
it’s here, in rare surviving 19th-century warehouses, that one of the city’s 
most charming secrets is hidden.

The Musée des Arts Forains <http://www.arts-forains.com/> has one of the 
world’s most extensive collections of 19th- and early-20th-century fairground 
attractions and music hall paraphernalia. Its founder, former actor and antique 
collector Jean-Paul Favand, calls it a living museum, because you don’t just 
get to marvel at the picture-book carousels, carnival cutouts and halls of 
distorting mirrors - you get to try them out, too. Most of the year it’s a 
hassle to get in – you have to book in advance as part of a large group (adult 
€10, child 4-11 €8) – but over Christmas the museum opens every day for a 
fortnight of retro escapism.

Highlights include a bicycle-powered merry-go-round constructed in Britain in 
1897, one of only two left in the world. While you pedal clockwise, noisily 
building up to speeds of 60kmph that are as thrilling (and unnerving) now as 
they would have been in the pre-car era, the Belgian-made roof, painted with 
cycling scenes, gaily turns the other way (continental carousels have always 
gone anti-clockwise).

Much of the museum’s charm comes from its eccentric mise-en-scène: eminent 
waxwork Victorians such as Emile Zola or Louis Pasteur live out their 
retirement from theMusée Grévin <http://www.grevin-paris.com/en> in spangly 
outfits from the Folies Bergère; a carved wooden elephant suspended from a 
hot-air balloon (in reality the roof of a carousel) dominates another room. In 
the cobbled yard outside, chandeliers hang among tree branches, gilt carved 
arms holding torches extend from trunks and a horse’s backside emerges from a 
wall. Wherever you wander, thick velvet curtains, a valance encrusted with 
glass mercury beads, gilded stucco and elaborate carvings recreate the luxe 
atmosphere of 19th-century people’s palaces.

A fitting conclusion to a visit this year is the Magic Mirror, an itinerant 
Belgian dance hall built in 1920, which was transported by train, packed into 
15 goods wagons. It has a circular dancefloor and intimate booths around its 
outer circumference, with thousands of mirrors adorning every surface. The 
parties within were key social events in towns visited: an opportunity to flirt 
and let your hair down - the mirrors lending glamour while facilitating the 
discreet eyeing-up of “talent”. This year’s visits will end here with a 
30-minute surprise performance, which could involve tap dancing, mime artists 
or eccentric musicians.

“Laughter and parties didn’t have a museum, yet there are plenty of museums 
dedicated to war,” says Favand of the museum he founded 20 years ago. In 
redressing this balance, he has created an exhilarating celebration of shared 
joie-de-vivre. This year’sMerveilleux Noël du Musée des Arts Forains 
<http://www.arts-forains.com/index_anglais.php?pages_anglais=fdm2015> opened on 
20 December and runs until 3 January, including Christmas Day and New Year’s 
Day. Up to six visits a day are planned, each lasting around two hours and 
including mechanised performances, son-et-lumière shows, opportunities to try 
out many of the attractions and a live performance in the Magic Mirror Tent. 
Reservations are essential, and can be made by phone (+33 1 43 40 16 22) or

MORE RETRO CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR ACTIVITIES IN PARIS

Eiffel Tower ice-skating

It’s hard to beat an open-air ice-skating rink 57 metres above Paris – on the 
first floor of the Eiffel Tower (until 31 January, skate hire free). The rink’s 
relatively small size (190 square metres) is more than made up for by its 
exhilarating setting. For the best view of the tower itself, head to the rink 
and Christmas fair at theTrocadéro 
<http://www.evous.fr/Trocadero-on-Ice-Le-village-de,1142457.html>. Make sure 
you’re there after dark, on the hour, when the tower is suddenly lit up by 
thousands of sparkling light bulbs.
• Open daily until 31 January, 10.30am-10.30pm. The rink is free but staircase 
access to the tower’s first floor, where the rink is located, costs €7, €5 
(12-25-year-olds) or €3 (under-12s). Lift access costs €11, €8.50 (12-24s) or 
€4 (4-11s). Wearing gloves on the rink is mandatory, toureiffelparis

 Galerie Vivienne. Photograph: Alamy 
More than 150 covered arcades were constructed in Paris during the 19th 
century, precursors to the department store. About 20 remain, mostly in the 
1st, 2nd and 9th arrondissements. For a morning exploring (and finding) these 
privately owned streets filled with secondhand book and antique shops, theatres 
and cafes – many of them protected – you will need a suitably detailed map. For
belle époque grandeur, go to the Galerie Vivienne 
<http://www.galerie-vivienne.com/>, on Rue Vivienne in the 2nd arrondissement. 
For dining stay in the 2nd and visit Passage des Panoramas: opened in 1800 and 
inspired by oriental souks, it’s where old-fashioned bistros jostle with 
award-winning recent arrivals, such as the Philippe Starck-designedCaffé Stern 
<http://www.caffestern.fr/>, in a listed former engraver’s shop.
• Galerie Vivienne: entrances on rue des Petits-Champs, rue de la Banque and 
rue Vivienne in the 2nd arrondissement. Passage des Panoramas: main entrance, 
11, boulevard Montmartre.

In Passage Jouffroy opposite the Musée Grévin waxwork museum is a toyshop 
dedicated to dolls’ houses that has been stopping visitors in their tracks 
since 1972. You could leave here hundreds of euros lighter, with a fancy French 
bourgeois villa complete with Louis XIV-style armchairs and electrically wired 
chandeliers, or relatively unscathed, with perhaps the handpicked elements for 
a miniature teddy bears’ picnic, including the inch-high teddy bears 
themselves. Excellent for last-minute stocking fillers.

There’s no shortage of fancy belle époque restaurants in Paris but most come 
with a price tag to match their listed interiors. Le Bouillon Chartier, on the 
other hand, has been providing cheap, unpretentious French food to students and 
theatregoers since 1896. With its double-height ceiling, tall mirrors and 
formally dressed waiters who scribble the bill onto the paper tablecloths, this 
is a rough-and-ready time capsule from the impressionist era. However, you also 
need to expect queues and to share a table.

The world’s oldest wooden circus – built in 1851 – is the place where Jules 
Léotard invented the flying trapeze and also the location for the 1955 
Hollywood film Trapeze, featuring Burt Lancaster and Gina Lollobrigida. And, 
it’s also whereRichard Avedon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/02/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1>
 took his famous photo of regal model Dovima communing with elephants. 
Associated with the Bouglione family since 1907, the Cirque d’Hiver continues 
to offer everything associated with a traditional circus – including trapeze 
artists, gorgeous acrobats and clowns (warning: France still allows animal 
shows) – only with extra helpings of Parisian panache. Shows throughout the 
holidays, including Christmas. The current production, Rire, will run until 6 
March 2016.

It’s hard to pick one attraction out of this complex of botanical gardens, 
natural history museums and zoo near the Gare d’Austerlitz, but if you really 
want to feel like you’ve stepped into a time machine, go to the Galeries 
d’Anatomie Comparée et Paléontologie where the displays of animal skeletons, 
including those of giant whales and dinosaurs, seem untouched since the Great 
Exhibition of 1900. The Grande Galerie d’Evolution presents a marvellous array 
of stuffed animals in a vast, theatrically lit central atrium. In the botanical 
gardens outside, kids will appreciate a carousel featuring extinct creatures 
and the Ménagerie, one of the oldest zoos in Europe, housed in quaint 
19th-century follies.
