Red alert – the robots are coming closer, and they’re coming for us, the old 
people

. I used to think the worst that could happen to me would be life in a care 
home, but this is an even scarier option – life alone with laminate floors and 
a bossy robot (robots need smooth surfaces). I thought we were safe from robot 
“carers” – that they only had them in Japan or Singapore, but now they’re 
planning to have them in Kensington and Hertfordshire.

MiRo <https://www.eaglemoss.com/en-us/technology/miro-the-biomimetic-robot/>, 
by Sebastian Conran Associates, is a “biomimetic companion robot” dog that will 
transmit news of any problems to a hub, remind us to take our medicine, and of 
our visitors’ names. What visitors? If you had any, you wouldn’t need a robot.

Try thinking yourselves into our possible future lives, robot-inventors. Do 
you not see the horror? No human voice or touch, a blank, whiteRoBear

 (from Japan), lifting you from bed to wheelchair, a legless, furless dog robot 
monitoring your every move. Can the RoBear wipe your bum? Can the MiRo dog lick 
your hand?

 Biomimetic companion dog, MiRo. 
No. They are machines. And it is frightening to be handled by a machine. My 
very elderly mother had to be pulled out of bed, dangled in the air and lowered 
on to the commode by a hoist, like a sack of potatoes. She screamed with 
fright, even with me, her human daughter, working the ghastly thing and 
reassuring her. Imagine no human presence, for days or weeks. Just robots, 
omnidirectional cameras and sensors, linked to hubs, linked to a live person 
somewhere.

And who is going to pay for all this equipment, and these adapted or 
purpose-built homes? Our generous social services? Or are they only for 
the wealthy? Couldn’t they afford to hire a live person instead? What about 
trying that excellent idea from the Netherlands instead, wherestudents live 
rent-free, and care for their elderly neighbours a few hours a week?

“Any elderly human with half a brain left will realise that robots don’t give 
a shit about them,” says Fielding. Crudely put, but true. With robots in 
charge, the elderly will realise that humans don’t give a toss either.
