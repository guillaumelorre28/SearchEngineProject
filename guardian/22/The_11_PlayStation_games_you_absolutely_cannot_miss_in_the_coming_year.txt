Sony re-announced the Last Guardian, the highly anticipated third game from 
the creator of acclaimed adventure games Ico and Shadow of Colossus, which puts 
you in control of a young boy exploring a ruin with the help of a giant 
bird/dog thing.

Five years ago Sony unveiled the game at E3 for the PS3, now the company is 
promising it will finally be available to play on the PS4 next year.

Director of the series, Fumito Ueda, will still head up the game despite no 
longer working for Sony.

 The procedurally generated space exploration game promises endless worlds to 
warp between, find new life and blow up stuff. Photograph: No Man's Sky 
Epic space exploration game No Man’s Sky from British developer Hello Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> was shown off, including 
battles, some identification of alien species and a good bit of destroying the 
environment – everything you’d want from a Star Trek-like experience to boldly 
go where no one has been before.

The main selling point of the game is the sheer scale: endless procedurally 
generated star systems waiting for players to warp between and start exploring, 
all created by a 10-person indie developer based in Guildford.

Fallout 4 isn’t the only post-apocalyptic world waiting for PS4 gamers. A

Zero Dawn presents a new world growing out of a destroyed old one where 
machines sit at the top of the food chain. The game features a female

Sony’s highly anticipated adventure game series will have its fourth and 
supposedly final outing this year. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End will feed fans 
more of the same with brawling, shooting, climbing and racing through city 
streets. Indiana Jones by any other name.

The latest game from Little Big Planet-creator Media Molecule is another grand 
build-your-own game. This time it’s less about small fabric worlds and more 
about creating things in a dream-like world.

Pretty much anything can be created within the game environment including art, 
games, films and music, apparently.

Do you like camping? A weird story line? Then Campo Santo’s Firewatch could be 
for you. You play a man who takes a job as a forest lookout after his personal 
life has crumbled, with his only contact a female co-worker over radio when 
strange things start happening in the wilderness.

PS4 and PS Vita called World of Final Fantasy was also unveiled for 2016, 
featuring a collection of cutesy versions of classic Final Fantasy characters. 
What they’ll be doing wasn’t really revealed.
