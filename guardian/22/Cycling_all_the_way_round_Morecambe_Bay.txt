I have made stops on bike rides for many reasons – to admire a view, or to 
have a tantrum, a dip or an emergency sausage roll. But this was the first time 
I’d taken a break for a meditation session. I had originally intended to visit 
Conishead Priory near Ulverston for a restorative slice of victoria sponge: 
this startling gothic-revival country house is home to theWorld Peace Cafe 
<http://nkt-kmc-manjushri.org/world-peace-cafe-in-the-conservatory>, which does 
fabulous and remarkably cheap homemade cake. Then I noticed a sign advertising 
twice-daily free meditation classes and thought I might as well give one a 
whirl. When in Cumbria …

There can’t be many ancient priories with a Buddhist temple in the back 
garden. But in the 1980s, a bunch of peace-loving monks rescued the dilapidated 
Conishead and turned it into a college for Buddhist studies.

I felt a bit uncomfortable wandering around the temple in my cycling shorts 
and not exactly box-fresh socks but no one batted an eyelid. And I was tickled 
to see the very modern offerings left at the shrines: boxes of Twinings tea, 
cereal bars and a tin of Celebrations.

At 12.30pm a gong sounded and a softly spoken Antipodean skinhead rounded up a 
handful of us for 15 minutes of silent contemplation. I had to fight the desire 
to lie down for a nap on the cosy cushions (note to future visitors: if a 
cushion has a red cloth on it, it’s reserved for ordained nuns and monks only).
 The Buddhist temple at Conishead Priory 
I made this inner peace pitstop while I was riding the new Morecambe Bay 
cycleway <http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/the-bay-cycle-way>, which 
launched in June. It’s an 81-mile route that runs from Glasson Dock, five miles 
south of Lancaster, all the way around the huge bay to Barrow-in-Furness. 
Sustrans, which designed and signposted the spectacular ride, suggests tackling 
it over four days, taking a liberal number of stops to enjoy some of the finest 
food in the north of England. It’s much quieter, and easier, than cycling in 
the heart of the Lake District.

The first time I tackled the new cycleway, I cheated and took the train from 
Arnside to Grange-over-Sands to cut off a corner of the sands. Having now also 
ridden the long way around, I’d advise anyone in a hurry to take that shortcut 
– with the usual warning about train companies’ bone-headed attitudes towards 
bicycles (you can’t book bikes on this route, so you have to take your chances 
and hope a peloton hasn’t boarded before you). The best bits of the cycleway 
lie south and west of here, and you’ll save yourself a not particularly 
memorable 15 miles of meandering through mozzy-plagued salt marsh.

 Aynsome Manor Hotel, Cartmel 
I cheated because I was going to be late for dinner at Aynsome Manor 
<http://www.aynsomemanorhotel.co.uk/>, a charming country house hotel just 
outside Cartmel. Less well-known and a little rougher round the edges than the 
more famousL’Enclume <http://www.lenclume.co.uk/> nearby, this family-run hotel 
does seriously delicious food with old-fashioned but incredibly attentive 
service. I began with seared king scallops topped with crispy Lakeland pancetta 
and then grilled fillet of black sea bream with a Chardonnay and onuga (herring 
roe) cream sauce.

I made the mistake of refilling my boots with a full English breakfast the 
next morning. A mistake because the biggest hill on the route is from Cartmel 
to the Bigland Hall Estate. It’s hardly a monster – a climb of about 145 metres 
– and much easier if tackled from the Cartmel side (there’s a 23.3% – section 
if you come the other way), but a trial with a bellyful of eggs and bacon 
nonetheless.

Despite the hills, it’s advisable to take panniers – to fill with goodies from 
places like the Sticky Toffee Pudding factory in Flookburgh andFurness Fish 
<http://www.morecambebayshrimps.com/>, supplier of Morecambe Bay potted 
shrimps, in Grange-over-Sands. On the way back I weighed myself down a with 
hunk of cheddar fromCartmel Cheeses <http://www.cartmelcheeses.co.uk/> and 
three bottles of beer fromUnsworth Yard Brewery 
<http://www.unsworthsyardbrewery.co.uk/>, also in Cartmel.

Beer lovers are well catered for on the route. I bumped into an old teacher in 
Silverdale (hi Mr Alker!), who insisted I call in to theSnug Micropub 
<http://thesnugmicropub.blogspot.co.uk/> at Carnforth station, better- known as 
thefilming location for Brief Encounter <http://www.carnforthstation.co.uk/>. 
This convivial bar is so tiny I couldn’t help but strike up conversations with 
fellow drinkers, one of whom had brought in some cider from his holidays that 
the landlord seemed happy for him to pass around.

A mile or two north, at the foot of Warton Crag, is Old School Brewery 
<http://www.oldschoolbrewery.co.uk/>, which on the second Friday of the month 
opens as a pub (house-brewed ales £2.50 a pint). When passing through 
Lancaster, theSun Hotel <http://www.thesunhotelandbar.co.uk/> and the canalside 
Waterwitch <http://www.thewaterwitch.co.uk/> are decent.

 The Midland Hotel, Morecambe. Alamy Photograph: Alamy 
For those riding the route from Barrow (a good idea given the prevailing sea 
breezes), the restored art decoMidland Hotel in Morecambe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/07/morecambe-revival-deco-midland-hotel>
 makes a classy stop-off, particularly for afternoon tea. I stayed the night, 
which was a real treat for a Morecambe lass who spent her teenage years 
knocking about on the prom as the Midland grew ever more dilapidated.

Most of the route is on smooth country lanes, with the exception of a section 
of towpath between Hest Bank and Carnforth on the Morecambe side, the estuary 
towpath from Glasson to Lancaster and a mile or so of gravel between 
Haverthwaite and Greenodd. Grinning and bearing the gravel is preferable to the 
fast and scary A590.

 The Morecambe Bay cycleway near Levens, Cumbria. Photograph: /Sustrans 
The nicest bit is probably the stretch between Ulverston and 
Grange-over-Sands. Time hasn’t been kind to Barrow, but the stretch from 
Conishead Priory via Gleaston Watermill is worth exploring — theWatermill has a 
great licensed cafe <http://www.watermill.co.uk/> plus a converted pig sty 
dubbed “The Poshest Pig Let in Cumbria” 
<http://www.watermill.co.uk/lile_piglet/lile_pig_let.htm>. It is perfect for 
couples seeking a peaceful retreat, and a fitting overnight stay for a route 
combining peace and gluttony.
