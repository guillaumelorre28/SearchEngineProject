My name is Margot Tenenbaum but I’m not the Margot you’ve been reading about 
in glossy magazines this autumn/winter – the “coolest muse of the season”, 
according tofashion critics

, as played by Gwyneth Paltrow in the 2001 Wes Anderson movie The Royal 
Tenenbaums.


I don’t wear fur coats or smudge kohl around my eyes. In fact, I don’t wear 
make up at all at the moment. I’m more of a casual jeans and cardigan kind of 
girl. I work at a school in New York, as a guidance counsellor, so it’s 
perfectly acceptable for me to wear jeans with a sweater and a pair of black 
boots to work; my style is relaxed and comfortable.

I met Wes Anderson <https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson> through my 
brother – we always say in my family that if you’re friends with one of us your 
friends with all of us. He was writing his first movie at the time, Bottle 
Rocket. Later he came up with a character based jokingly, loosely, on my 
brother, whose nickname was Baumer. That morphed into a movie named after the 
whole family. We never quite believed that any studio would let him name it 
‘The Royal Tenenbaums’, but of course they did.

The Tenenbaums couldn’t be further from my family. We’re Jewish and from the 
South of the US, which sets us apart in a huge way, and we are very close knit 
and gregarious. We’re are in no way as weird and eccentric as the Tenenbaums. 
We definitely don’t have sex with each other.

There’s no huge connection between Margot and I either, other from the name 
and one detail that he borrowed from me: the fact that I used to secretly smoke 
cigarettes. But Wes made her into what he wanted her to be, he didn’t mould her 
around me. I’m not saying I’m not nuts, but I’m nuts in a different way!

I realised that the Margot Tenenbaum character was living a life outside the 
film the Halloween after it was released – so many people were dressed up as 
her. There were others dressed as the brothers in tracksuits, too, but it soon 
became apparent that Margot was the character who was sticking in the fashion 
world. And rather than petering off, it just never seems to die down.

At least once a week there is some kind of reaction, usually from someone you 
wouldn’t expect – I get a package delivery or I’m paying for something in a 
store – and I’ll be told “I love that name” or “I love that movie” or “Wes 
Anderson is my favourite director.” No one is ever rude; it’s always really 
positive. Sometimes I’ll tell them I know Wes, other times I’ll say it’s a 
coincidence and I haven’t seen the movie – it depends how much of a hurry I’m 
in.

This year there has been even more hype again; I don’t read fashion magazines 
but a lot of people have sent me articles about Margot Tenenbaum inspiring 
designers. It’s having such a moment that there’seven a bar in Atlanta that has 
just opened 
<http://atlantarestaurants.blog.ajc.com/2015/09/28/bar-margot-opens-at-four-seasons-atlanta/>
, named after her; an old friend on Facebook posted it; that’s the thing about 
having a famous name; it does allow you to talk to people and connect with 
strangers.

 The real life Margot Tenenbaum. Photograph: Margot Tenenbaum 
It feels nice to read that “Margot Tenenbaum is the coolest muse in fashion 
right now,” but I wouldn’t buy the Margot Tenenbaum look. I’ve seen it in shops 
but I’m 49 – it’s not like I’m 25-years-old and trying out new looks; I’ve 
defined my own version of my style.

While Margot may be wildly fashionable now, I don’t think she’ll be suddenly 
out of fashion in a season or two – she has been a fashion reference for 14 
years now; it seems to me that it will hold, particularly as it is linked to a 
movie people love. And it’s not so controversial a look, really; it’s more a 
coat, a hairdo, a cigarette and an attitude.
