Deborah Orr (Why can’t TV make new plays for today? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deborah-orr>, 14 January) correctly points 
out that British playwrights are tackling many of the major social issues today 
in the theatre instead of using the more democratic medium of television. She 
laments the loss of Play for Today, saying it “fostered such talents as Mike 
Leigh, Alan Bleasdale, Dennis Potter and Jack Rosenthal (though this was the 
70s, so no women.)” There was at least one – me. I wrote a play for that series 
which was directed by the late Alan Clarke. It was calledNina 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0675266/>, based on the lives of two Russian 
dissidents, and it starred Eleanor Bron and Jack Shepherd.

• Over the 14 years (1970-84) that Play for Today ran, at least 21 female 
dramatists (including Julia Jones, Beryl Bainbridge, Caryl Churchill and Paula 
Milne) had plays produced for it. Play for Today also employed four female 
producers (Irene Shubik, Ann Scott, Margaret Matheson and June Roberts) and 
four female directors (including Moira Armstrong and Jane Howell). Women’s 
contributions to British television drama have been comparatively neglected and 
forgotten in cultural history.
