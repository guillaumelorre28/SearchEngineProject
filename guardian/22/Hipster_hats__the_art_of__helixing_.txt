There are myriad ways to wear a beanie if you’re a man, which is most 
unfortunate. It’s not man’s fault, though – rather, it’s the fault of the men 
who wear them. And just asRussell Branding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/russell-brand> fobbed us off with the idea 
of “pillowcasing

” (like pillowcasing, just with shorter hair), we have Harry Styles to thank 
for “helixing”, the new beanie standard.

Helixing is the counterintuitive practice of wearing a beanie towards the back 
of your crown, so as to expose the helix – or outer rim – of your ears.Styles

original helixer. It’s a scrambled logic that leaves your head hot and your 
ears cold, still it’s here and it’s mass, so let’s dig deep as towhy.

It’s worth mentioning that fashion is not always rooted in pragmatism. But, 
like non-prescription spectacles and most heeled shoes, there are some trends 
that positively mock utility and helixing is one. Unsurprisingly, Urban 
Dictionary, the entry point for hipster antipathy, describes it asHipster Hat 
<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hipster+hat>, arguing that many 
men are prepared to get earache from the elements because warmth isso 
mainstream.

Sam Wolfson is a journalist and hat fan who has been wearing his beanie like 
this for years. It’s nothing to do with being able to hear, he says. Rather, it 
sets you apart from basic beanie wearers: “It’s like the difference between 
like sticking a hat on a little kid for a boxing day walk so that he stays 
toasty, and wearing a beanie in a trendy-first-year-at-St-Martins way. Earsin 
is, like, too John Lewis catalogue, you know?” Chilvers agrees: “The pulled 
over the ears look definitely has the tendency to look a bit teen angst.”

Helixing requires a shallow beanie (Lyle & Scott 
<http://www.lyleandscott.com/lyle-&-scott-beanie-hat/shoes-&-accessories/fcp-product/2419>
 does a thin, stretchy version that works well) or a fisherman beanie (ribbed, 
a bit smaller). Alternatively, you can fashion a regular beanie into one of the 
above by rolling the rim up. Fashion is divided on the amount of rolls – the 
blogosphere goes for double-rolling, whereas Chilvers recommends three rolls: 
“Beanie science – another groundbreaking turn from menswear.”

Obviously, with all hat-related trends, its success hangs on head shape, 
hairstyle “and in this particular incidence,” continues Chilvers, “ear shape”. 
There are two hair camps: long-haired wearers, such as Kurt Cobain, whose “hair 
generally looked good anchored down, ears in, hair poking out at the bottom” 
and those with “slightly shorter but still messy hair [see Harry Styles], for 
whom the ears out option looks infinitely neater and more grown up.” Something 
for everyone, then.


On one hand, we should be grateful for helixing. The more beanies there are in 
existence, the fewer flat caps. Think about it.
