It’s a question as old as art itself: “Yeah, but is it art?”

Type it into Google and get 1.26 billion results. It lends itself to book 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/But-Is-It-Art-Introduction/dp/0192853678> titles, 
television series <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIa-NtGV-ZM> and 
conversations between white walls, whetted by prosecco.



It’s a question asked of a shark in formaldehyde

This question, the distant cousin of “my kid could have done that”, has 
quietly endured.



The decibel levels rise, however, when it comes to appropriation 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/appropriation>. 
Appropriation is the practice of artists taking already existing objects and 
using them, with little alteration, in their own works. The objects could be 
functional, everyday objects, or elements of other art pieces; commercial 
advertising material, newspaper cuttings or street debris. Anything, really.

It’s interesting, though, that some appropriation in art is seen as acceptable 
in the public consciousness, some not.Warhol 
<http://revolverwarholgallery.com/andy-warhol-art-appropriation/>: of course. 
Sampling at the birth of hip-hop – well, sure. Found object art like Duchamp’s
Fountain <http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-fountain-t07573>? Hmm.

Richard Prince and the art of ‘rephotographing’

Richard Prince <http://www.richardprince.com/> is a New York-based artist 
famous for appropriation. His work relies heavily on the work of others. Not 
all of his pieces or projects are appropriated, but his most famous pieces owe 
their existence to the technique.

Take, for instance, Prince’s “rephotographing” of Marlboro cigarette 
advertisements 
<http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--I2Dg4Qe084/TVgRgWeZRUI/AAAAAAAAEq8/XyANlMsL1yE/s640/Picture+2.png>
, specifically those featuring theMarlboro Man 
<http://www.designmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/joshstanley_richardprince_cowboy.jpg>
 (originally shot bySam Abell 
<http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photographers/photographer-sam-abell/>
). The series, entitled – and some might say, appropriately – Cowboys, began in 
the 1980s. A more recent piece from the series (2000) sold for more than $3m 
(£1.9m) at a 2014Sotheby’s auction 
<http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/contemporary-art-evening-sale-n09141/lot.3.html>
.

There’s a rather brilliant PDN interview 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um74DKYlta8>, in 2008, with Abell, who speaks 
about Prince’s appropriation of his photographs. At the beginning of the 
interview, Abell states: “I’m not angry, of course”. He then speaks for three 
minutes, getting angrier and angrier.

I’m not particularly amused … it’s obviously plagiarism, and I was taught by 
my parents the sin of that … it seems to be breaking the golden rule … he has 
to live with that.”

 Photographer Sam Abell talks about his Marlboro Man works being appropriated 
by Richard Prince. 
Abell’s Marlboro photographs are not the only pictures to be repurposed by 
Prince. In 2014, Prince settled athree-year-long copyright case 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cariou_v._Prince> with the photographer Patrick 
Cariou after the former used Cariou’s Yes, Rasta, abook 
<http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Rasta-Perry-Henzell/dp/1576870731> on the 
rastafarian community, as part of hisCanal Zone 
<http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/richard-prince--may-08-2014> series. He’s 
also been known to hand out copies ofA Catcher in the Rye 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/02/100-best-novels-catcher-in-the-rye-jd-salinger-holden-caulfield>
 with hisown name on the cover 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/04/richard-princes-latest-act-of-appropriation-the-catcher-in-the-rye/>
.

Now, Prince is back in the spotlight. His current exhibition – New Portraits 
<http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/richard-prince--september-19-2014> – 
opened in June at the Gagosian gallery in London, having debuted in New York in 
2014.

The portraits, however, are not new to everyone – and certainly not new to 
their subjects.

This is because Prince’s New Portraits series comprises entirely of the 
Instagram <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram> photos of others. 
The only element of alteration comes in the form of bizarre, esoteric, lewd, 
emoji-annotated comments made beneath the pictures by Prince.

in the eye with a sharp stick 
<http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/better-than-a-poke-in-the-eye-with-a-sharp-stick>
”.

As collaborations go, if Jay-Z and Beyonce

together of the best of hip-hop and R&B, andScorsese, Nicholson and DiCaprio 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auYbpnEwBBg> a filmmaking supergroup, then 
Richard Prince and the internet are an appropriation dream team.

So it is that one of the oldest questions (“but is it art?”) collides with one 
of the most pressing, current global debates: that of online privacy and 
ownership in the digital age.

‘Did you need permission?’

Prince isn’t just a visual or conceptual artist: he’s also a writer. He’s a 
good writer.

On his blog, and reprinted in Love 
<http://thelovemagazine.co.uk/article/1155/richard-prince-new-portraits> 
magazine, he has published anessay 
<http://thelovemagazine.co.uk/article/1155/richard-prince-new-portraits> about 
the genesis of New Portraits and how he discovered technology, and the way in 
which it has informed, and become a part of, his work.

I asked my daughter about Tumblr. Are those your photos? Where did you get 
that one? Did you need permission? How did you get that kind of crop?

“You can delete them? Really? What about these ‘followers’. Who are they? Are 
they people you know? What if you don’t want to share? How many of your friends 
have Tumblrs?”

Later, he writes: “This past spring, and half the summer, the iPhone became my 
studio. I signed up for Instagram. I pushed things aside. I made room. It was 
easy. I ignoredTumblr <http://guardian.tumblr.com/>, and Facebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> had never interested me. But 
Instagram <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram> ...”

Prince, who is active on Twitter <https://twitter.com/RichardPrince4> and has 
over 15,000 followers, explains that his first social media project consisted 
of “portraits” of his family – via tweets.

I called the photo/texts tweets I was posting The Family. I posted photos of 
my extended family … mother, brother, sister, nieces, cousins, uncles, aunts, 
in-laws, step-children …


But the subjects of New Portraits are not members of Prince’s family, nor are 
they his friends.

For the most part, the people whose images he has appropriated are strangers: 
cool, creative 20-somethings, artfully or sexually posed (the majority of them 
women), with the odd celebrity addition (again, most of them women –Kate Moss 
<https://news.artnet.com/wp-content/news-upload/2014/10/richard-prince-instagram-klaus-biesenbach.jpg>
,Sky Ferreira 
<http://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2014/may/29/take-a-look-at-richard-princes-latest-instagram-art/>
,Pamela Anderson <http://www.phaidon.com/resource/prince-anderson-620x416.jpg>, 
Taylor Swift <https://twitter.com/RichardPrince4/status/613422220203937792>, 
Lara Stone 
<https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/11311484_355690941308894_207698360_n.jpg>
).

Thus, quite apart from the debate around authenticity and process (yeah, but 
is it art?), is the query: wait, what? You just took people’s photographs 
without their permission, blew them up, exhibited them and then made a lot of 
money?

Almost all of the people I spoke to whose pictures Prince had used had not 
been contacted by the artist – either to notify them of his intentions, or to 
ask them for permission.

The first they heard about it was when friends got in touch having seen the 
pictures, or when other Instagram users began to tag them in photos they had 
taken at his exhibition.

This, from Jan Gatewood, otherwise known as Young Duckits 
<https://instagram.com/youngduckits/?hl=en>, is pretty typical:

Someone tagged me in a photo Richard Prince posted of me on his Instagram and 
said ‘you made it’.

I was confused because I was unaware of who he was. I noticed he had a pretty 
good amount of followers so I tweeted about what happened, and some friends 
further informed me of who he is and what he does. He did not get in touch with 
me and ask me for permission.

Furthermore, the subjects I spoke to also said Prince had yet to contact them 
after the fact. (Princedid tweet 
<https://twitter.com/RichardPrince4/status/604632664591765506>, however, that 
one subject, Nitecore, had asked him for her print, and he had given it to her).
Richard Prince (@RichardPrince4) 
Gave New Portrait to Nitecore for free. Why? Because she asked. The rest of U 
Jr. Minds? F*ckU & the horseU rode inOnpic.twitter.com/gXuGDSpstx

<https://twitter.com/RichardPrince4/status/604632664591765506> 
Were these people not angry? Like, really angry?

Gatewood is honest about the fact he sees Prince using his picture as a 
positive because it means more exposure for him – the California-based 
21-year-old works in the424 apparel store 
<http://shop.fourtwofouronfairfax.com/>, but he also paints, skates and makes 
music. But he does add that a small part of him thinks the whole thing is 
“ridiculous”.

Sita Abellan <https://twitter.com/richardprince4/status/551031046347956224>, 
who is 22 and from the south of Spain, has just moved to Tokyo to further a 
modelling and DJ-ing career. Abellan had heard of Prince before, and was 
familiar with his work.

“He’s a really cool artist, I like him very much”, she writes. “I feel special 
that an artist like him used my picture to make his project. But I can 
understand that people feel upset if he did not ask for permission”.

It’s a view echoed by Karley Sciortino 
<http://uk.businessinsider.com/instagrammers-from-richard-princes-photos-didnt-take-the-original-pictures-2015-5>
, a sex columnist for Vogue, who has previously called her inclusion in the 
exhibition “an honour 
<http://uk.businessinsider.com/instagrammers-from-richard-princes-photos-didnt-take-the-original-pictures-2015-5>
”.

So it’s fine, right? As Prince would have it 
<http://thelovemagazine.co.uk/article/1155/richard-prince-new-portraits> – his 
apparent artisticraison d’etre – “what’s yours is mine.”

That could also work as the motto of the internet. When we talk about the 
internet, we talk about sharing. Sharing our photographs, our thoughts, links 
to articles we find interesting, games we enjoy playing. And the internet is as 
much about sharing others’ content as it is our own.

Much of what we mean by the internet is about appropriation, recontextualising 
and simply copying

Much of what we mean by the internet is about appropriation, recontextualising 
and simply copying. Round and round we go.

Retweeting, regramming, reblogging, re-everything. In particular, Tumblr and 
Pinterest <https://uk.pinterest.com/theguardian/> are sites specifically geared 
towards the sharing and collating of found content. The online, social 
equivalent ofDuchamp’s readymade art 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_object>, or objet trouvé.

Either content is source credited and acknowledged – or it isn’t.

You can put a watermark across an image, but crop tools exist (as Prince 
cropped out the Marlboro logo on his Cowboy rephotographs). Missed a gig? No 
problem, search a hashtag, screen shot, change the contrast a little, and 
present the photo as your own. Steal a joke from Twitter, sans h/t (hat tip).

Why shouldn’t Prince be allowed to do what all of us do, all day, every day? 
It’s not illegal (is it?), and anyway, women have been wearing trousers in 
Paris for decades, which wasagainst the law until 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/feb/04/legal-women-wear-trousers-paris>
, right? There might as well not be a law. This is the way things are. What’s 
yours is mine.

People own their photos – Instagram

There’s only one real answer at the moment to the question of whether Prince’s 
New Portraits violates copyright law orrights of publicity 
<https://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Right_of_Publicity>, and it’s this: 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Until an action is brought against the artist, all we can do is speculate. I 
contacted Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, to make sure its users 
retained ownership of the photographs they upload. The answer:

People on Instagram own their photos. On Instagram, if someone feels that 
their copyright has been violated, they can report it to us and we will take 
appropriate action. Off Instagram, content owners can enforce their legal 
rights.

The spokesperson added that if a user felt their content was being 
appropriated in such a way that might violate copyright law, then it should be 
reported to itshelp centre <https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838/>.

Instagram’s – rather daunting – advice on reporting content that could breach 
copyright law isas follows 
<https://help.instagram.com/277982542336146?ref=related>:

Submitting a claim of copyright infringement is a serious matter with legal 
consequences. Before you report a claim of copyright infringement to us, you 
may want to reach out to the person posting the content. You may be able to 
resolve the issue simply by bringing it to their attention without contacting 
Instagram at all.

If you’re not sure whether the content you’re reporting is infringing your 
legal rights, you may want to seek legal guidance. Keep in mind that submitting 
intentionally misleading reports of infringement may be punishable under the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) 
<http://www.ala.org/advocacy/copyright/dmca> in the United States or similar 
laws in other countries.”

And, of course, that’s a whole other issue. Different countries have different 
copyright laws, and internet traffic passes through many servers in different 
countries. In the case of US copyright law, Prince would probably be fighting 
to defend his work using something called thefair use doctrine 
<http://copyright.gov/fair-use/> under Section 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act 
<http://copyright.gov/title17/92appa.pdf> (as he did during his previous court 
battle with Cariou 
<http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/landmark-copyright-lawsuit-cariou-v-prince-is-settled/>
).

Section 107 seems to allow for appropriation. In layman’s terms, while Section 
106 <https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/copyright.act.chapt1b.html> of the 
Copyright Act is all: this is your work, ain’t nobody gonna steal this. We got 
your back.Section 107 <http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html> is a bit 
like: no, wait, this guy maybe can, if he can prove that it’s, like, fair for 
him to do so.

Prince could argue under fair use that his work is not derivative because it 
is “transformative <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(law)>”.

In this specific instance, Prince not only added his own opaque comments under 
individuals’ pictures before he took screen shots, but also reportedprevious 
comments as spam 
<http://thelovemagazine.co.uk/article/1155/richard-prince-new-portraits>, 
ensuring they disappeared (when viewed on his own account), pushing his own 
comments to the top – thereby arguably altering the original work. (He writes 
about this hackhere 
<http://thelovemagazine.co.uk/article/1155/richard-prince-new-portraits>.)

He might also say that he has changed the very nature of the original 
photographs by re-contextualising them and framing them in an artistic, 
analogue setting and fuelling debate.

Of course, copyright law was basically invented so that people could protect 
their ability to make money from their original creations. So it follows that 
one of the most importantfour tenets 
<http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/> of US copyright 
law is the element of commercial gain.

I don’t know about you, but I would regard $100,000 per image (£64,000) as 
quite a bit of commercial gain.

I could have done with some of the money, to be honest

This is a recurring theme when speaking to the Instagrammers who have had 
their pictures lifted: well, sure, I could have done with some of the money, to 
be honest.

Apart from the smattering of celebrities, many of Prince’s subjects are 
aspiring or career-beginning models, actors, artists, students, in their teens 
and early-20s, working at clothing stores as in Duckits’ case, or bars, while 
finding their feet.

Selena Mooney <https://www.linkedin.com/pub/selena-mooney/b/b07/331>, more 
commonly known as Missy Suicide, is slightly different. She is the co-founder 
and co-owner of the successful pin-up site,SuicideGirls 
<https://suicidegirls.com/>. 

But, as she puts it: “It is shocking to think that people are paying $90,000 
for anything other than a house.”

Though one might argue that this is more a criticism of the art market itself, 
Mooney decided to hit back in an inventive, clever way aftermany images 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/27/suicide-girls-richard-prince-copying-instagram>
 of SuicideGirls models were used by Prince.

Thinking that it would be “more fun than spending my days in court”, Mooney 
teamed up with publisherEyes on Walls <http://www.eyesonwalls.com/> and decided 
to rephotograph Prince’s rephotographs of her photographs (I need to lie down), 
andsold the prints 
<https://suicidegirls.com/members/missy/blog/2837632/tuesday/> for just $90 
(“99.9% off the original price”), donating all proceeds to adigital rights

This, ironically, could lead to charges of Mooney breaching Prince’s copyright 
by appropriating his idea. As chief executive officer ofMoz <https://moz.com/>, 
Sarah Bird,puts it 
<https://moz.com/blog/whats-fair-about-fair-use-defending-a-copyright-infringement-claim>
, an idea cannot be copyrighted, but the expression of an idea can be. Prince’s 
response?

“Missy Suicide is smart.”

‘It’s such a violation’

It is Mooney who has been the most vocal campaigner against New Portraits, and 
touched upon the element that a lot of people find most troubling: that of an 
older, white man (#CheckYourPrivilege 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/CheckYourPrivilege?src=hash>) making money from 
pictures, mostly self-portraits, of young women in various states of undress. 
Live on,male gaze

.

SuicideGirls <http://suicidegirls.com/> was established in 2001, back in the 
days when the internet came packaged with a CD-Rom. ItsInstagram account 
<https://instagram.com/suicidegirls/> now has 3.5 million followers.



The website was set up to allow women – especially those not conforming to 
mainstream beauty standards – to take back their sexual agency.



In Mooney’s own words: 

SuicideGirls is about celebrating how the model feels sexiest about herself, 
how she wants to be presented to the world and how she curates her own image, 
so to have a guy [Prince] grab the images and claim them as his own, especially 
to such hefty profits, is such a violation.

It’s not a great look for Prince. He’s a friend and peer of Terry Richardson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/17/terry-richardson-new-york-magazine-model>
 – the photographer made famous for snapping naked women andallegedly 
pressurising them into sexual favours 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/17/terry-richardson-new-york-magazine-model>
 (and most recently seen in adocumentary about Amy Winehouse 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvmFr_OCLgU>, encouraging the singer, dressed 
in just bra and pants, to run a shard of mirror glass across her stomach).

Prince also counts Jeff Koons <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/koons> 
as a friend – the artist ofgiant-balloon-dog fame 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/jan/13/jeff-koons-balloon-dog-copyright>
, who also made aseries of photographs 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/arts/design/14koons.html?_r=0> depicting him 
mid-coitus with his then porn star wife.

Comments Prince has posted under pictures of women, include 
<https://res.cloudinary.com/ssenseweb/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto/v1433948574/editorial/IMG_2262.jpg>
: “Enjoyed the ride again. Let’s do it again some time. Richard.”
 Amanda Bodell’s self portrait, which was used by Richard Prince in his New 
Portraits exhibition. 
So far, so sleazy. But so what? When photorealist artist Panayiotis Lamprou 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/17/panayiotis-lamprou-portrait-wife-photography>
 photographed his wife, naked from the waist down with her legs open, her 
pubeless vagina pointed at camera, he wasn’t chastised or branded a perv – the 
picture wasnominated for a prestigious prize 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/17/panayiotis-lamprou-portrait-wife-photography>
 and displayed in theNational Portrait Gallery <http://www.npg.org.uk/>. 

Double standards, is the argument. How come sometimes nudity is deemed OK 
(high art), sometime it isn’t (porn), and who gets to make that distinction?

Richardson shooting a naked Miley Cyrus 
<http://static.idolator.com/uploads/2013/10/03/mc8-600x800.jpg> is 
exploitative, but Rembrandt and Schiele’s portraits? That’s art. Round and 
round we go. Until we end up with Rupert Murdoch’s The Sun re-publishing a 
Vogue nude spread of Keira Knightley in defence of Page 3.

It’s a debate that won’t be put to bed anytime soon. Lamprou is different, we 
might say. He sought permission. It’s not, as Mooney terms Prince’s work, “a 
violation”.

Meanwhile, SuicideGirls has its own detractors. The site has come under 
criticism for being co-founded and owned by Suicide’s male partner, Sean Suhl, 
and Mooney’s role has been questioned.

Though, as she correctly points out, the majority of her staff are women 
<https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/37hzrn/>, and it’s unlikely such 
scrutiny would have been applied at all if she were not its female figurehead. 
The website has also endureddisputes with models and photographers 
<http://www.blueblood.net/2008/06/suicidegirls-vs-lithium-picnic-lawsuit-settled/>
 (since resolved).

The criticism people level, though, is that SuicideGirls is just another 
internet porn site, nothing to do with empowerment. It’s just women taking 
their clothes off. Again. Why is it different if they happen to have a septum 
piercing?

Or, as a woman I shared a cigarette with one night while writing this piece, 
said:

“They say it’s for themselves, to feel good. But why would you put it online 
then?”

Because everything is online.

Richard Prince v ‘digital natives’

If it’s not online, did it really happen? Schrödinger’s internet cat.

Fear of missing out may have existed pre-internet, but it didn’t become a 
cultural and societal phenomenon with its own acronym (Fomo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/17/hephzibah-anderson-fomo-new-acronym>
) before Instagram filters were added to festivals and Facebook statuses about 
the beauty of Bora Bora.

I never used to know that while watching Cruel Intentions 
<http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cruel_intentions/> in a darkened Oxford flat 
for the 50th time you were out partying on the Upper East Side for real. I 
didn’t realise my ex was getting married until Facebook told me I hadn’t been 
invited.

Many of Prince’s subjects, however, are – to use a phrase which should have 
been strangled by an ethernet cable at birth –digital natives. They always knew 
about the wedding.

Digital natives don’t make room for digital – it is how they live

It ages Prince when he admits to thinking Tumblr was spelt “tumbler”, and 
writes about how he “pushed things aside” and “made room” for Instagram. 
Digital natives don’t make room for digital – it is how they live. This is the 
way things are.

Amanda Bodell <https://instagram.com/amandaabodell/?hl=en>, a 22-year-old 
model from Sandviken, Sweden, and another subject of Prince’s, puts it rather 
brilliantly in an email to me:

“I get that a 65-year old thinks that a hashtag is something you smoke.”

Most of those featured in New Portraits, including Bodell, live the internet, 
and are active on a number of different social media platforms. Most of them 
have a greater number of Instagram followers than days I have been alive (I’m 
25).

Don’t they ever worry about putting themselves so entirely out there?





Bodell, who has been blogging since she was 16, says that she has a separate 
private Instagram account just for family and friends, but apart from that, all 
of her online accounts are public.

“I’m almost always online, except for about 2 to 3 times a month I delete all 
my social medias for a day or two, it’s like a meditation thing.”

The one person featured in Prince’s exhibition I contact who says Prince did 
ask for permission to use her image is AustralianJen Schmitz 
<http://jnschmtz.tumblr.com/>.

When I try to seek Schmitz out on Instagram, it becomes apparent she has 
deleted her account. HerTumblr <http://jnschmtz.tumblr.com/> is still active 
though, and when I view it, somebody has already asked why she got rid of her 
Instagram.

“Because people started treated me like an animal in a zoo, online or in real 
life”.

I follow up – via Tumblr, asking about Prince, and get an equivocal response: 

“[Prince] asked if he could use my photo and I agreed, I don’t really feel any 
type of way in regards to the use of my photo.

“When I said people were treating me like an animal in a zoo, I meant that 
people stopped treating me like a human being with feelings – like people 
thought they were entitled to an opinion about my life when they’d never met 
me.”

Schmitz’s Tumblr <http://jnschmtz.tumblr.com/>, along with the social media 
accounts of Abellan, Duckits and Bodell, is popular because it is interesting. 
Their presence is widely felt and followed because it is a good presence.

Duckits tells me he “naturally gravitated” towards social outlets because he 
always loved learning and talking to people.

“I grew up in the suburbs of Colorado so I loved being able to feel somewhat 
close to the things we didn’t really have access to.”

His online presence grew after positive reactions to a series his punk band 
posted toYouTube <https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian?hl=en-GB&gl=GB>. 
Duckits’ accounts, along with the others, are full of carefully collated art, 
and poetry and fashion and music. Most of it, I might add, almost certainly 
reproduced without permission.

An image on Schmitz’s Tumblr, for instance, is brazenly lifted straight from a 
stock photo site with the watermark still stretched across it, with no attempts 
to remove it. This, in its own way, is a perfect microcosm of the internet.

Everybody I speak with agrees that while it’s bad form to try to pass 
something off as one’s own, it’s unrealistic for it to be feasible to ask every 
single person for permission when using their image on a personal Tumblr or 
website.

It is, as Bodell tells me, a “very complex issue. Of course it’s a problem if 
people’s photos or artwork are being stolen and used for mass production and 
such without any credits given. But at the same time, without sharing, the 
internet wouldn’t exist.”

I’ve never been to a show and been so unmoved


This being the Gagosian, I have the door opened for me by a security guard 
dressed as slickly as anUberLux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/18/uber-worst-company-silicon-valley>
 driver, rather than the polo shirts you might find at theTate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tatebritain>.

The London offering is smaller than Prince’s 2014 New York showing, which 
featured 37 portraits. This is just as well, as the room is tiny. The New 
Portraits exhibition is held in theDavies Street space 
<http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/richard-prince--june-12-2015>, around the 
corner from Claridge’s hotel, in moneyed Mayfair. Home to people who can afford 
to spend $100,000 on art, I guess.

The portraits are ink-jet printed and reproduced on six-foot canvases. I 
suppose I should have expected this – iPhone screenshots blown up to such a 
size – but the quality is awful. The text of the comments in particular is so 
blurry it feels like I’m looking through contact lenses clouded by having slept 
in them.

Most of the subjects’ portraits are unremarkable, but then, why wouldn’t they 
be? They were never intended for a high-end gallery show. Some, however, are 
witty, playful. Others banal, or smack of the poseur.

I spot Duckits’ picture. Abellan is there, too. Her picture, a bathroom-mirror 
selfie, she thinks she took when she was at home sick. She wrote to me that she 
has had a lot of shit for it on Instagram, people being rude about it “because 
I don’t have breasts. I’m ok with it though, cos I found it funny to confuse 
people about my sex”.

Bodell is also there. And the SuicideGirls. There are other subjects. A prince 
<https://instagram.com/mansoorbinmohammed/?hl=en> from the United Arab 
Emirates, celebrities, some young guys in Snapbacks, two women scissoring.

I ask the security guard whether he likes the exhibition. He gives me a look 
which manages to combine: a)what, this crap? b) utter indifference c) concern 
for his job. At this point, given that I’m the only person in the gallery, a 
young man wearing Buddy Holly glasses, a member of staff, asks if he can help.

He’s more enthusiastic about New Portraits. He may be professionally obliged 
to be –Larry Gagosian <https://www.gagosian.com/about/about-larry-gagosian> has 
a longstanding relationship with Prince and represents him – but he also seems 
genuine. He talks about what it all means: appropriation, age of internet etc. 
Sure, sure, I say.

But I can’t help thinking that I’ve never, ever been to a show and been so 
unmoved. So underwhelmed. Sowhat’s-the-point? And this is coming from a bonafide
Abramovich <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic> fan, a 
lover ofEmin <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin>, and someone who 
actually thinks Koons can be quite beautiful.

I got nothing. The pictures themselves are not particularly interesting and 
Prince’s commentary is just irritating, like the guy on the train who refuses 
to stop making rubbish jokes, while simultaneously looking down your top.

Art as genius trolling

The New Yorker’s Peter Schjeldahl said his response 
<http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/richard-princes-instagrams> to 
New Portraits was a “wish to be dead”. And art criticJerry Saltz 
<http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/richard-prince-instagram-pervert-troll-genius.html>
, in defending Prince,admitted 
<http://www.highsnobiety.com/2015/06/03/richard-prince-instagram-art/> that the 
artist was guilty of “genius trolling”. He is. Just last week he tweeted a 
screen grab of a Google image search when someone asked him about his process.

When I asked him for comment for this piece he tweeted the following to me:
Richard Prince (@RichardPrince4) 
@ladyhaja <https://twitter.com/ladyhaja> Dear Hannah: I'm feeling slow. I 
found some 714's in a sock draw and bly me if I don't feel drippy. I figured it 
out didn't I?

<https://twitter.com/RichardPrince4/status/610903946341670912> 
He does, however, seem to have elaborated on his thoughts in a series of 
tweets on the exhibition, mostly mocking the charge of appropriation.

ArtNet published a review with the rather succinct title: Richard Prince Sucks 
<https://news.artnet.com/art-world/richard-prince-sucks-136358>. “Prince is 
painfully removed from the youth culture in which he’s participating, which 
only extenuates the project’s problems,” it stated. But what really are the 
problems at the project’s core?

Is it that Prince took the photos of strangers and used them without their 
permission (even though many of his subjects re-post and re-blog images they 
also do not own)?

Or is it that a majority of the images are of women, wearing few clothes, and 
these were reused without their knowledge?

Or is this a David and Goliath issue, all about an imbalance of power? That a 
multi-millionaire artist can take stuff belonging to kids making their way in 
the world, and convert it into cold, hard, cash?

Another subject of Prince’s, 19-year-old student Anna Collins, told Business 
Insider 
<http://uk.businessinsider.com/instagrammers-from-richard-princes-photos-didnt-take-the-original-pictures-2015-5>
: “I just think about how I’m a working student in school, I’m extremely broke, 
and here is a middle-aged white man making a huge profit off of my image. Kind 
of makes me sick. I could use that money for my tuition.”Further, she didn’t 
even take the picture of herself lounging around with her boyfriend, she said. 
Her sister did.

And to the question: yeah, but is it art? We can’t deny that Prince has added 
to the debate around online privacy, appropriation and internet freedom.



He’s asking us to explore ourselves, and our choices and the way we present to 
society. That’s part of what art should do, right?

One wants to say the question of whether Prince’s New Portraits is art is 
easily answered:of course. 

And then you remember: yeah, but he’s literally just taken screen shots of 
photos of 20-year-olds in pools and added random comments alongside the wink 
emoji.

My kid could have done that.
