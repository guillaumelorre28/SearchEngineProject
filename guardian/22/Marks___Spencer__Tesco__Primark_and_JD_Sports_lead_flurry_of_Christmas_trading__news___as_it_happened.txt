Online electricals retailer AO World has dampened the mood, despite decent 
sales growth over Christmas.

AO says that it is cautious about trading conditions, due to

“the uncertain UK economic outlook, currency impacts on supplier pricing and 
the possible effect on consumer demand”

On the upside, total revenues in the three months to December 31 were up 12.3% 
year-on-year. But that may not be enough to cheer investors.

CEO John Roberts says:

Looking ahead we have three months left of the current financial year and are 
mindful of the uncertain economic outlook. However, we remain confident that 
our market leading proposition will continue to drive customers to experience 
the AO Way and enter the New Year excited by the opportunities ahead.”

JD Sports has also reported strong sales and expects to beat City forecasts 
for profits in the current year.

It said the like-for-like growth of about 10% achieved in the first half had 
continued in the second half of its financial year to 7 January.

JD now expects that headline profit before tax and one-off items for the 
current financial year will exceed analysts’ expectations of £200m by up to 15%.

Peter Cowgill, executive chairman, said:

“Whilst we acknowledge that it would be unreasonable to expect like for like 
sales growth to be maintained at recent levels for a fifth consecutive year, we 
are confident that both domestically and internationally, our unique and often 
exclusive sports fashion premium brand offer provides a solid foundation for 
future development.”

The trading update did not mention the firm’s investigation into conditions at 
its Kingsway warehouse near Rochdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/jd-sports-warehouse-channel-4-kingsway-rochdale>
 after a Channel 4 documentary found workers claiming it was “worse than a 
prison”.

City veteran David Buik reckons JD have outperformed Sports Direct.

Primark has a 'good' Christmas

Associated British Foods, the firm behind the Primark chain, says that trading 
across its business was “good” in the last 16 weeks.


However, we don’t have any like-for-like figures for Primark.

Total sales at Primark were up 11% year-on-year in ‘constant currency terms’, 
or a chunky 22% in actual currency terms (thanks to the fall in sterling).

ABF says:

The UK performed well. Like-for-like sales for the period were good and market 
share increased reflecting the strength of our consumer offering. Like-for-like 
sales for the group were held back by declines, albeit smaller than last year, 
in Germany and the Netherlands, the latter particularly affected by the rapid 
increase in selling space.
Seamus Conwell (@SeamusConwell) 
Primark numbers smash it again. +11% over Christmas, 22% if you take weaker 
Sterling. Plan to open over 1mn sq ft in current financial year

Debenhams: Christmas sales up 5%

Onto Debenhams <https://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams>...and it’s 
also beaten forecasts as customers clamoured for beauty products and gifts.

My colleague Julia Kollewe has taken a look, and reports:

Debenhams has reported better than expected Christmas trading. Like-for-like 
sales grew 5% in the seven weeks to 7 January and were up 1.7% at constant 
exchange rates.

Over the 18 weeks to 7 January, group like-for-like sales at constant exchange 
rates edged up 0.5%, with UK sales stronger, at 1% growth.

Analysts had expected a 1% drop in underlying sales.

The retailer said beauty and gift sales grew strongly to take the non-clothing 
sales mix to 57%. It has cut back on promotions overall but said it had a 
successful Black Friday.

Tesco: 3rd successful Christmas in a row

Tesco has also posted a decent-looking performance over Christmas, with a 0.7% 
rise in like-for-like sales in the UK - driven by sales of toys and clothes.

That’s despite not repeating last year’s loyalty card promotion which it said 
had hit performance by 0.8%.

Here’s the details:

 * Food like-for-like sales up 1.3%, with significant market outperformance in 
fresh food

 * Impact of minus 0.8% on total UK like-for-like sales from not repeating 
Clubcard ‘Boost’ promotion, leading to lower general merchandise sales

 * Strong performance in clothing and toys, with sales up 4.3% and 8.5% 
respectively

CEO Dave Lewis says this is Tesco’s third successful Christmas in a row

We are very encouraged by the sustained strong progress that we are making 
across the Group. In the UK, we saw our eighth consecutive quarter of volume 
growth and delivered a third successful Christmas. Our fresh food ranges proved 
particularly popular, outperforming the market with great quality, innovative 
new products and even more affordable prices. Internationally, we have 
continued to focus on improving our offer for customers in challenging market 
conditions.

We are well-placed against the plans we shared in October to become more 
competitive for customers, simpler for colleagues, and an even better partner 
for our suppliers, whilst creating long-term value for our shareholders.

I would like to thank all of our colleagues for everything they have done to 
serve our customers brilliantly over this very busy period.”

 are a boost to Marks & Spencer’s new CEO, Steve Rowe, who recently announced a 
turnaround plan for the business centered on its food business.

Rowe says:

“I am pleased with the customer response we have seen to the changes we are 
making in line with our plan for the business. I would like to thank the whole 
team for their hard work over this busy period.

“In Clothing & Home, better ranges, better availability and better prices 
helped to improve our performance in a difficult marketplace. We also continued 
to substantially reduce discounting, including over Black Friday.

 “Our Food business continues to grow market share with customers recognising 
our product as special and different. Our Simply Food store pipeline remains 
strong.”

Rowe warms, though, that consumer confidence remains “uncertain” in 2017.

Marks & Spencer beats forecasts

Marks & Spencer has beaten City forecasts, with sales growth across its food, 
clothing and homeware operations.

The high-street chain grew its like-for-like sales in the UK by 1.3%, led by a 
2.3% jump in clothes and homeware.

That’s a welcome return to form for M&S, after years of underperformance in 
this area.

Can it be true M&S... clothing and home lfl +2.3%

Food sales also did well, up 0.6% in a like-for-like basis (stripping out new 
stores).

The agenda: Masses of Christmas trading news
 You wait ages for a Christmas trading statement, and then 12 come at once. 
Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the 
financial markets, the eurozone and business.

They’re calling it Retail Super Thursday in the City.

No fewer than 12 of Britain’s shopping groups are reporting their financial 
results for the Christmas period this morning, giving a crucial insight into 
the UK economy.

The list includes several big names -- Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Debenhams, 
along withJD Sports, SuperGroup, Mothercare, Associated British Foods (the 
owner of Primark),Moss Bros, ASOS, Booker Group, Dunelm, and AO.com.
Mike van Dulken (@Accendo_Mike) 
A huge number of retailers updating markets tomorrow: AO., ASC, ABF, BDEV, 
DEB, DNLM, MCLS, MKS, MTC, MOSB, SGP, TSCO

Veteran analyst Nick Bubb sighs:

 “Super Thursday” is a nightmare for retail analysts with about a dozen 
Christmas trading announcements all coming out at once at 7am.

But it’s worth it, guys, to find out how Britain’s high street and e-commerce 
sector fared during the first festive period since the Brexit vote.

Also coming up....

There’s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from a report on German 
GDP in 2016 at 9am, eurozone industrial production figures at 10am, and the 
weekly US jobless report at 1.30pm.

Plus, traders will be watching to see if the FTSE 100 can extend its run of 
record highs....

Online electricals retailer AO World has dampened the mood, despite decent 
sales growth over Christmas.

AO says that it is cautious about trading conditions, due to

“the uncertain UK economic outlook, currency impacts on supplier pricing and 
the possible effect on consumer demand”

On the upside, total revenues in the three months to December 31 were up 12.3% 
year-on-year. But that may not be enough to cheer investors.

CEO John Roberts says:

Looking ahead we have three months left of the current financial year and are 
mindful of the uncertain economic outlook. However, we remain confident that 
our market leading proposition will continue to drive customers to experience 
the AO Way and enter the New Year excited by the opportunities ahead.”

JD Sports has also reported strong sales and expects to beat City forecasts 
for profits in the current year.

It said the like-for-like growth of about 10% achieved in the first half had 
continued in the second half of its financial year to 7 January.

JD now expects that headline profit before tax and one-off items for the 
current financial year will exceed analysts’ expectations of £200m by up to 15%.

Peter Cowgill, executive chairman, said:

“Whilst we acknowledge that it would be unreasonable to expect like for like 
sales growth to be maintained at recent levels for a fifth consecutive year, we 
are confident that both domestically and internationally, our unique and often 
exclusive sports fashion premium brand offer provides a solid foundation for 
future development.”

The trading update did not mention the firm’s investigation into conditions at 
its Kingsway warehouse near Rochdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/jd-sports-warehouse-channel-4-kingsway-rochdale>
 after a Channel 4 documentary found workers claiming it was “worse than a 
prison”.

City veteran David Buik reckons JD have outperformed Sports Direct.

Associated British Foods, the firm behind the Primark chain, says that trading 
across its business was “good” in the last 16 weeks.


However, we don’t have any like-for-like figures for Primark.

Total sales at Primark were up 11% year-on-year in ‘constant currency terms’, 
or a chunky 22% in actual currency terms (thanks to the fall in sterling).

ABF says:

The UK performed well. Like-for-like sales for the period were good and market 
share increased reflecting the strength of our consumer offering. Like-for-like 
sales for the group were held back by declines, albeit smaller than last year, 
in Germany and the Netherlands, the latter particularly affected by the rapid 
increase in selling space.

Onto Debenhams <https://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams>...and it’s 
also beaten forecasts as customers clamoured for beauty products and gifts.

My colleague Julia Kollewe has taken a look, and reports:

Debenhams has reported better than expected Christmas trading. Like-for-like 
sales grew 5% in the seven weeks to 7 January and were up 1.7% at constant 
exchange rates.

Over the 18 weeks to 7 January, group like-for-like sales at constant exchange 
rates edged up 0.5%, with UK sales stronger, at 1% growth.

Analysts had expected a 1% drop in underlying sales.

The retailer said beauty and gift sales grew strongly to take the non-clothing 
sales mix to 57%. It has cut back on promotions overall but said it had a 
successful Black Friday.
 
Tesco has also posted a decent-looking performance over Christmas, with a 0.7% 
rise in like-for-like sales in the UK - driven by sales of toys and clothes.

That’s despite not repeating last year’s loyalty card promotion which it said 
had hit performance by 0.8%.

Here’s the details:

 * Food like-for-like sales up 1.3%, with significant market outperformance in 
fresh food

 * Impact of minus 0.8% on total UK like-for-like sales from not repeating 
Clubcard ‘Boost’ promotion, leading to lower general merchandise sales

 * Strong performance in clothing and toys, with sales up 4.3% and 8.5% 
respectively

CEO Dave Lewis says this is Tesco’s third successful Christmas in a row

We are very encouraged by the sustained strong progress that we are making 
across the Group. In the UK, we saw our eighth consecutive quarter of volume 
growth and delivered a third successful Christmas. Our fresh food ranges proved 
particularly popular, outperforming the market with great quality, innovative 
new products and even more affordable prices. Internationally, we have 
continued to focus on improving our offer for customers in challenging market 
conditions.

We are well-placed against the plans we shared in October to become more 
competitive for customers, simpler for colleagues, and an even better partner 
for our suppliers, whilst creating long-term value for our shareholders.

I would like to thank all of our colleagues for everything they have done to 
serve our customers brilliantly over this very busy period.”
 
Today’s results 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/12/marks-spencer-tesco-debenhams-primark-jd-sports-flurry-christmas-trading-business-live?page=with:block-58772c3de4b0f10ba20b74c6#block-58772c3de4b0f10ba20b74c6>
 are a boost to Marks & Spencer’s new CEO, Steve Rowe, who recently announced a 
turnaround plan for the business centered on its food business.

Rowe says:

“I am pleased with the customer response we have seen to the changes we are 
making in line with our plan for the business. I would like to thank the whole 
team for their hard work over this busy period.

“In Clothing & Home, better ranges, better availability and better prices 
helped to improve our performance in a difficult marketplace. We also continued 
to substantially reduce discounting, including over Black Friday.

 “Our Food business continues to grow market share with customers recognising 
our product as special and different. Our Simply Food store pipeline remains 
strong.”

Rowe warms, though, that consumer confidence remains “uncertain” in 2017.
 
Marks & Spencer has beaten City forecasts, with sales growth across its food, 
clothing and homeware operations.

The high-street chain grew its like-for-like sales in the UK by 1.3%, led by a 
2.3% jump in clothes and homeware.

That’s a welcome return to form for M&S, after years of underperformance in 
this area.

stores).

along withJD Sports, SuperGroup, Mothercare, Associated British Foods (the 
owner of Primark),Moss Bros, ASOS, Booker Group, Dunelm, and AO.com.

Veteran analyst Nick Bubb sighs:

 “Super Thursday” is a nightmare for retail analysts with about a dozen 
Christmas trading announcements all coming out at once at 7am.

But it’s worth it, guys, to find out how Britain’s high street and e-commerce 
sector fared during the first festive period since the Brexit vote.

Also coming up....

There’s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from a report on German 
GDP in 2016 at 9am, eurozone industrial production figures at 10am, and the 
weekly US jobless report at 1.30pm.

Plus, traders will be watching to see if the FTSE 100 can extend its run of 
record highs....
