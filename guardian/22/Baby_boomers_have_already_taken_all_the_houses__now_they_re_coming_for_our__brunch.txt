It used to be so easy. You’d live with your parents until you were 
30-something (and had settled into a hybrid and weird housemate-style 
relationship), you’d drink instant coffee instead of takeaway lattes, you have 
tins of homebrand tuna for lunch – eaten at your desk. Your colleagues knew not 
to ask you when collecting money for a going-away present or for charity.

You were saving for a deposit on a house – socking it away cent by cent, 
dollar by miserable dollar.

Once in a while you’d clip a Groupon for a $15 steakhouse meal. Entertainment 
was the TV, at home, where you’d watch The Block and feel a sense of investment 
in the plotline that sometimes scared you.


Brunch was for wimps who lacked the discipline to save money and the strength 
to smash their own avocado. Your life was generally joyless – but like a 
penitent you were deferring pleasure for a higher good. Your fever dreams 
involved sparsely attended auctions and deceased estates. Refreshing the 
browser on realestate.com.au became more exciting than watching porn.

But somewhere along the line real estate became to living what porn is to sex. 
The houses unattainable to Normals, auctions as entertainment, the whole thing 
an absurd fantasy accessible only to the super rich – or those who already had 
a leg up and the equity to negatively gear.

So it is galling to read the demographer Bernard Salt in the Australian at the 
weekend saying thatif millennials just stopped going to “hipster cafes”

 and eating avo on toast – they too could buy a house.

Salt writes: “I have seen young people order smashed avocado with crumbled 
feta on five-grain toasted bread at $22 a pop and more. I can afford to eat 
this for lunch because I am middle aged and have raised my family. But how can 
young people afford to eat like this? Shouldn’t they be economising by eating 
at home? How often are they eating out? Twenty-two dollars several times a week 
could go towards a deposit on a house.”

Hey, Salt – your maths is wrong! Houses prices in Sydney have surged beyond 
the price increases of smashed avo with feta on sourdough. The median house 
price is $1m. You would now have to save $200,000 to put down a 20% deposit on 
something not great, somewhere not grand.

Forgoing avo on toast for brunch once a week and you’ll save for your deposit 
in ... 175 years! That’s 9,100 $22 smashed avocados on toast. With feta. And 
maybe some chilli flakes.

Last weekend a one-bedroom house (one bedroom – try raising a family in that!) 
sold in Sydney’s Camperdown for $1,230,000, up from $688,500 in 2013.

So what do you do when you can’t afford to buy somewhere to live? Well, you 
decide to live.


You get Ubers, you travel, you buy a good phone, you get a laptop, you go for 
brunch (many of these things – particularly travel and electronic goods have 
fallen in price, while house prices have accelerated way beyond income growth).

Brunch is the opiate of the masses. We are not going out for brunch instead of 
buying houses: we are brunching because we cannot afford to buy houses.

And oh how we brunch!

We watch the brunch market as carefully as the baby boomers watch property – 
what’s the hot suburb to brunch in? What area has not yet been gentrified by 
wealthy brunchers and its possible to get authentic Israeli baked eggs for a 
tenner? What brunch place has just had a write-up in Broadsheet? We’ll queue up 
for it and Instagram it and use it as a social signifier in the way that people 
once used their houses as a mark of social status.

Brunch is all we’ve got, Bernard! Don’t take it away from us.

When I interviewed Nick Shelton, the founder of the foodie website and 
newspaper Broadsheet last year, he said that research it commissioned has shown 
that young people (who treat Broadsheet as their bible) will eat out about nine 
times a week.

Brunch has become a lifestyle – fetishised as much as the property market (the 
New York Times calls it the brunch industrial complex). But the price point of 
entry is much lower than property – you have to take what you can get.

This is depressing, not because it stops young people from saving for houses, 
but because time in restaurants or lingering for hours over brunch means less 
time for the necessary activism or political action against the offensively 
unequal society we are now living in.

We’re rolling out of cafes, too jacked up on the third latte, groaning from 
the pulled pork mascarpone pancake stack, to meaningfully fight the man on 
income inequality, negative gearing and unaffordable housing. But, boy, we need 
to.

As I write this I am eating brunch (baked eggs with olives, yum – $16) in a 
suburb with million-dollar houses. I will never be able to afford to buy a 
house in Bondi, but I can afford to brunch here – and that $16 for those eggs 
is the toll I pay to linger here, just for a little while.

We should be angry about this. We want houses. Instead we get brunch. And then 
the baby boomers with houses try to take away our brunch.
