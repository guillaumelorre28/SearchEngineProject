Nudging the French border is Spain’s joint oldest national park (created in 
1918 with Picos de Europa, see below) but also one of the least well known. The 
3,355m Monte Perdido (Lost Mountain) looms over dramatic glacial valleys up to 
3km deep. In its 156 sq km you’ll find hikes for every level, including paths 
along natural ledges in the limestone just a metre wide. Most popular hikes 
begin at Pradera de Ordesa including the Circo de Cotatuero, a six-hour circuit 
to a thunderingwaterfall 
<http://www.topwalks.net/images/faja_racon/cascada_de_cotatuero.htm> (there’s 
also a shorter walk <http://www.topwalks.net/en/ordesa/faja_racon.htm>). There’s
exhilarating rafting 
<http://www.guiasdetorla.com/rafting-en-el-rio-ara-de-clase-v-unico-en-espana/> 
(€52pp) just a few kilometres south of the park in Torla which has a 
comprehensive visitors’ information centre.
Stay Refugio Luicen Briet (dorm bed from €11, doubles from €42 room-only, 
lucienbriet.com <http://lucienbriet.com/>) is a comfortable refuge-style hostel 
in Torla. For the real deal try the Refugio Góriz mountain hut (€16.80 
room-only,goriz.es <http://goriz.es/index.php/en>) in the heart of the park

This vast park, Spain’s largest, stretches over 850 sq km south from Granada 
to the gorgeous valleys of the Alpujarras, with more than 20 peaks over 3,000 
metres. The hiking is spectacular; just pick your altitude to suit the time of 
year. I’ve got a soft spot for the Thursday market at Órgiva – locals selling 
big knickers, hippies selling tie-died stuff – and the trails around the Taha 
villages, including lovely Mecina Fondales.Nevadensis 
<http://www.nevadensis.com/> in Pampaneira arranges a huge range of activities, 
such as mountain-biking, or saddle up withSierra Trails 
<http://spain-horse-riding.com/> (five days from €550pp) in Bubión. There’s 
skiing from late November until late April but conditions can be unreliable.
Stay Hotel de Mecina Fondales (doubles from €88 room-only, hoteldemecina.com

The least-visited of all the parks is also one of the most appealing. You’re 
only allowed to land on one island in the archipelago, Cabrera itself, but it’s 
an unspoilt delight, particularly the castle, which guards the entrance to the 
harbour. Most visitors are just here for the day and spend it on the beach or 
following walking trails. Guided walks and kayak trips are also available. Some 
visitors never get further than the island’s only bar, which is propped up from 
first thing by the police officers stationed here. Boats withMar Cabrera 
<http://www.marcabrera.com/> from Colònia de Sant Jordi on Mallorca take about 
30 minutes and cost around €40 return.
Stay The only accommodation is an ex-army barracks that has been converted 
into a 12-room hotel (cvcabrera.es <http://cvcabrera.es/albergue-de-cabrera/>,

There is water everywhere in this wild Pyrenean landscape. There are hundreds 
of lakes, fed by myriad streams tumbling over waterfalls as they pass through 
valleys of pine and fir forests, below peaks that reach more than 3,000 metres. 
Visitors stand a good chance of spotting some of the abundant wildlife, such as 
golden eagles and the Pyrenean chamois, a small antelope. It makes for a park 
that’s absolutely wonderful for hiking, from easy family strolls to testing 
multi-day treks into the mountains. Cross-country skiing’s possible in winter. 
Visitor centres are in the villages of Boí and Espot.
Stay Refuges should be booked in advance in summer (from around €17pp, 
lacentralderefugis.com <http://lacentralderefugis.com/>), or stay just outside 
the park in the beautiful Vall de Boí – Hotel el Rantiner is in the lovely 
village of Taüll (doubles from €75 B&B,hotelelrantiner.com

Is there life on Mars? Who knows, but there’s certainly plenty of evidence of 
tourist lifeforms on this little piece of Martian landscape. Volcanic eruptions 
in the 17th and 18th centuries created an extraordinary park of volcanic cones 
and lava flows covering around 50 sq km. It’s still a hot zone – temperatures 
just a few metres below the surface reach 600C and a bucket of water thrown 
into a hole in the ground produces a satisfying geyser of steam. The entrance 
fee (€9 adult, €4.50 child) includes a coach tour round the park.Guided walks 
<https://www.reservasparquesnacionales.es/real/parquesnac/usu/html/detalle-actividad-oapn.aspx?ii=6ENG&cen=6&act=5>

Jurassic Park could have been filmed here – it feels like a lost world. 
Erosion of a mountain has created a giant bowl up to 10km across with cliffs 
rising up to 2km from the floor of the caldera. Waterfalls explode out of these 
cliffs and streams run through forests of Canary Island pine. It’s wonderful 
walking country. The El Paso visitor centre just south of the park has maps and 
issues permits for camping in the park if you’ve not reserved online (see 
below). Minimal light pollution explains theRoque de los Muchachos Observatory

Everybody’s favourite park was created, like Ordesa, in 1918. It straddles 
three regions of Spain but is actually just 40km across. There’s no room here 
to do justice to its amazing variety. It’s deservedly popular so let me pick an 
area that’s a little less-visited. The southern flanks of the Picos de Europa 
has some of the park’s prettiest villages, including Posada de Valdeón which 
has a national park office and makes a fine base for walks. The Rio Cares goes 
through the village and its stunning gorge starts nearby. The stretch up to 
Cain is not quite as busy in summer as the northern section.
Stay Pensión Begoña (doubles from €30 room-only, +34 987 740516, no website) 
in Posada de Valdeón is affordable and has a restaurant serving up filling

One for animal lovers; there are more than 200 species in this central western 
park, including the rare Spanish lynx. But it’s the bird population, including 
that really gets twitchers reaching for their binoculars. The 181 sq km park is 
home to vultures, eagles and owls, plus western Europe’s only breeding 
population of black storks. The hiking’s not shabby either – follow 
colour-coded routes from the park’s only village, Villarreal de San Carlos, 
where the visitor centre is, to some great birdwatching spots including the 
hunk of rock that is theSalto del Gitano

 and the ruin ofCastillo de Monfragüe

, or just enjoy the scenery; a couple of rivers carving through dramatic cliffs 
make for some splendid views.
Stay Simple Casa Rural Al-Mofrag (doubles from €55 room-only, 
casaruralalmofrag.com <http://casaruralalmofrag.com/>) is right in the centre 
of the park and has a pool
