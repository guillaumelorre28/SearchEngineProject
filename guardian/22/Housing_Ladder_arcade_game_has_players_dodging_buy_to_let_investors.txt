Britain’s housing crisis has been turned into a spoof arcade game where 
players have to dodge second-home owners and foreign investors to “buy a house 
or die trying”.

The Housing <https://www.theguardian.com/society/housing> Ladder slot machine, 
by the Suffolk-based cartoonist and inventor Tim Hunkin, uses treadmill steps 
on an actual ladder to move an automated figure towards the prize of a house 
encrusted in fake diamonds.


If players take a step when a housing villain appears, the automated climber 
slides to the bottom. Villains include a developer clasping a mobile phone, and 
a buy-to-let landlord with a tenancy agreement.

The game has three skill levels depending on resources: hard for no savings, 
quite easy for “bank of mummy and daddy” and “easy peasy” for offshore funds. 
And there’s an age gauge that signals “game over” if you don’t reach the house 
by the time you are 80.

 How to play The Housing Ladder 
The Housing Ladder will be unveiled at Hunkin’s London alternative arcade, 
Novelty Automation, on Thursday.

It will eventually be installed at his Under the Pier show 
<http://www.underthepier.com/10_current_machines.htm> in Southwold on the 
Suffolk coast where Hunkin says it was “battle hardened” this summer to “iron 
out problems”. Other games on the pier include his “whack a banker game” and a 
mobility masterclass where players try to cross a motorway using a zimmer frame.

The pier also includes Hunkin’s scatological water clock 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyJV5nc6yX8> where metal figures spit and 
urinate at each other every 15 minutes.

Hunkin’s latest game takes a swipe at affluent incomers who have priced locals 
out of the Suffolk housing market. One of the baddies in the game is a 
second-home owner clasping a “I love Southwold” bag.

He said The Housing Ladder was inspired by the plight of young people trying 
to find a home in London. “I employ several part-timers to man Novelty 
Automation and their tales of trying to find somewhere to live are crazy. They 
have to move out of London because of it,” he told the Guardian.

“I don’t think political art has an enormous effect, but in the short term it 
is satisfying to reinforce people’s disrespect of the villains.”

Hunkin’s grandchildren tested prototypes of the machine.

 Testing out the prototypes. 
In a blog post about the project 
<http://www.timhunkin.com/a217_making-the-housing-ladder.htm> he said: “The 
press is curiously quiet about second homes, maybe because so many journalists 
own one.”

He added: “Large developments are supposed to include a proportion of 
‘affordable’ homes. Not only are the ‘affordable’ homes still unaffordable, but 
developers frequently mange to reduce the proportion on appeal.

“Entire London squares are now dark at night because no one lives there. 
London property has become a magnet for money laundering.”

Speaking to the Guardian he added: “It is in the tradition of popular art. As 
a cartoonist it is important that people get the joke. I’m not trying to be 
subtle. London has a wonderful tradition of popular entertainment going back to 
the 1600s, and it’s all got a bit corporate.

“I love all that Hogarth stuff. If the 18th-century cartoonists were alive now 
they might be doing something a bit like Novelty Automation. That’s what I 
aspire to. It is very rich territory, I don’t know why more people don’t 
explore it.”


Hunkin rose to prominence in the 1980s in the television series the Secret 
Life of Machines for Channel 4 in which he explained the workings of household 
appliances with animations.

Hunkin’s London arcade, which has been running for more than two years, is 
funded from the proceeds of customers paying to play the satirical slot 
machines.

He said: “Its an amusement arcade to entertain people, it just about breaks 
even. You put tokens in to make the machines work, and the tokens cost one or 
two pounds each. But its expensive having a place in central London.”

He gave a preview of future attractions: “I’m making a machine about phone 
obsession at the moment called iZombie, and I’ve got an idea about Airbnb as 
well, and immigration. There is so much potential out there.”
