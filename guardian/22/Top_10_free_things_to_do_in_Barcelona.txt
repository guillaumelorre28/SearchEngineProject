Modernist architecture

Barcelona is the birthplace and cradle of Catalan modernism from the late-19th 
and early-20th-century, and modernist architecture can be seen all over the 
city. Its main exponent was Antoni Gaudí, designer ofPark Güell  
<http://www.parkguell.cat> - the jewel in Barcelona's modernist crown. The city 
recently introduced a €7 entry fee for the park, but you can still see some of 
his masterpieces from the outside: Casa Batlló and La Pedrera are both 
spectacular examples. Check out theModernism Route 
<http://www.rutadelmodernisme.com/default.aspx?idioma=en&contenido=body_rutamodernisme_01en.htm>
 website for details on where to find buildings not just by Gaudí but also by 
other key modernis t architects, such as Lluís Domènech i Montaner (who 
designed thePalau de la Música Catalana 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau_de_la_M%C3%BAsica_Catalana>) and Josep Puig 
i Cadafalch.

The good thing about this upwardly rising city is that neighbourhoods to the 
north offer several locations to take in breathtaking views. The Carmel 
Bunkers, at the top of the Turó de la Rovira hill, are a free open space. They 
were built as anti-aircraft bunkers during the Civil War in 1937, and 
afterwards the ruins became shacks, which were removed for the Olympics in 
1992. Now part of the city's Museum of History 
<http://barcelona.de/en/barcelona-museum-city-history.html>, they are a free 
open space with panoramic views. TheCarretera de les Aigües 
<http://360runningbarcelona.com/map-of-running-tours-in-barcelona/barcelona-de-les-aigues-running-tou/>
 is a 10km trail along the side of Tibidabo, the mountain on the north-western 
edge of the city. Packed with runners, cyclists and wanderers at weekends, it 
offers spectacular views and, conveniently, is in Serra de Collserola natural 
park.

Some of the best museums in Barcelona have free entry every Sunday after 3pm: 
thePicasso Museum  <http://www.museupicasso.bcn.cat/en/>is the go-to place for 
his early works; theMuseum of History of Barcelona 
<http://www.museuhistoria.bcn.cat/en> is essential for history suckers – 
especially if you’re into Roman ruins and want to check out the city's 4,000 
square metres of archeological digs, as well as medieval landmarks and 
fascinating insights into Catalonia’s history;CCCB <http://www.cccb.org/en/> is 
good for innovative contemporary exhibitions; or there's the newBorn Cultural 
Centre <http://elborncentrecultural.bcn.cat/en>, a 19th-century market with a 
cast-iron structure beneath which are the ruins of the 18th-century city before 
it was destroyed in a siege in 1714. Also free on first Sundays is theNational 
Museum of Art of Catalonia <http://museunacional.cat/en> for medieval and 
modernist art.

Strolling around the old city, and especially the Gothic quarter – next to the 
popular La Rambla – is a great way to get a feel for the town. Every corner is 
full of history and, from the old Jewish quarter, el Call, to the secluded 
medieval alleyways that define the neighbourhood, you’ll find charming little 
squares, streets or patios in many buildings that are open to the public, such 
as thehistorical archive <http://w110.bcn.cat/portal/site/ArxiuHistoric> of the 
city or the RomanTemple of Augustus 
<http://www.museuhistoria.bcn.cat/en/node/648>. Squares not to miss are Plaça 
del Rei and Plaça Sant Felip Neri, a hauntingly silent spot with an emblematic 
fountain and church, in the walls of which can be seen the scars of heavy 
bombing from the Spanish civil war.

The crammed beaches of Barcelona can be anything but relaxing in the summer 
months – hence the locals’ preference for quieter nearby seaside resorts like
Sitges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/23/sitges-catalonia-family-holiday-spain>
 (a short train ride away) or, to the north, the spectacular Costa Brava. 
However, the city’s beaches are great for an urgent dip. The popular 
Barceloneta and Sant Sebastià beaches have a curious mix of locals and 
tourists, and both are next to theold fisherman’s quarter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/mar/16/barcelona-barceloneta-bars-restaurants-spain>
, which is worth exploring for its cafes and bars. On the other side of the 
Olympic Port, it's a bit quieter and there's a nudist section in Mar Bella.

Barcelona has the perfect weather for watching outdoor movies and, not

Among the free offerings is the Cinema Lliure, which shows independent films on 
Sant Sebastià beach on Thursday and Sunday evenings. The Centre of Contemporary 
Culture of Barcelona (CCCB) programmes its own festival,Gandules 
<http://www.cccb.org/en/marc-gandules-40665>, showing short films and 
documentaries for free in its courtyard. And, for a free and intimate taste of 
local music, go to the gardens of the University of Barcelona on selected July 
evenings.

The church of Santa Maria del Mar, built in the 14th century, deserves an 
article in its own right as one of the most beautiful Gothic cathedrals ever 
built. While Barcelona's cathedral was the centre of the old city, this church 
became the main building of what was then the new part of the city, next to the 
sea, in which a nucleus of merchants and shipowners settled. The speed at which 
the new church was built – 55 years - was an incredible feat at a time when 
most churches took longer than a century to construct, and makes it a rare 
example of pure Gothic architecture. Do visit the cathedral as well, but the 
unique harmony and elegance of this church's interior will take your breath 
away.

If there is one thing Barcelona lacks, especially compared with British 
cities, it’s parks. The population density is quite high, and people live 
mostly in apartment buildings. However, both the coast and the mountains are 
around the corner (including the Pyrenees, a couple of hours away), so the 
city's main green space, Parc de la Ciutadella, is more than adequate. It's on 
the site of an old military citadel – hence, the name – and has a lake and zoo, 
and houses the Catalan Parliament. Head to the Montjuïc hill for a mix of 
nature, great views and culture – you'll find the theNational Museum of Art  
<http://www.museunacional.cat/ca?lan=001>and the Joan Miró Foundation 
<http://www.fundaciomiro-bcn.org/>, as well as Olympic landmarks and a castle.

One of the best local experiences is a neighbourhood festival, and they're 
mostly held at the end of the summer. Barcelona's own festival, La Mercè – the 
name of the city's patron saint – takes place in late September and comprises 
more than 600 events, including gigs all over the city and all kinds of 
cultural attractions, from the typicalcastells (human towers) to correfocs 
(fire-running), fireworks, and processions ofgegants (massive papier-mâché 
figures hollowed out and carried by local organisations). The Gràcia 
neighbourhood throws the most spectacular street parties, and runs a 
competition for the best-decorated street, with outlandish themes ranging from 
urban forests to outer space.

Food plays a big part in Catalan culture, and there's no better way to get a 
taste of local cuisine than exploring the city's markets. La Boqueria, Europe's 
biggest food market, in the middle of La Rambla, is the most famous – and 
crowded – but both its food stalls and its architecture make it unmissable (if 
you can, go in the morning). Santa Caterina is also worth a visit thanks to its 
colourful undulating structure and its food. The former has several tapas bars, 
and the latter includes a restaurant – perfect for tasting the market's produce.
