A question: how is it that we seem to get a new screen version of Hamlet once 
a decade or so, yetMacbeth (Studiocanal, 15) has remained largely untouched 
since Roman Polanski’shefty 1971 version 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysd5gwHfG1w>? If it wasn’t already the most 
wildly cinematic of all Shakespeare plays, Justin Kurzel’s stripped-back, 
blood-caked and fire-breathing new version is certainly out to prove the point. 
Some have complained that it loses too many words, yet in their place are 
vivid, scorched-in images: snow and sparks, heaving bodies in tangled states of 
violence, skies that bleed in saturated scarlet.

I honestly can’t remember which passages are missing. Kurzel finds such an 
intuitive visual language for the Scottish play that I heard them in my head 
anyway – if not quite as rivetingly delivered as they are byMichael Fassbender 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender> and, as a most sensually 
persuasive Lady M,Marion Cotillard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/marion-cotillard>. Both performances boast a 
kind of lean modern classicism; there’s no strained updating of either 
character, but each has been conceived and concentrated for the intimacy of the 
camera, not the echo of the stage.

Kurzel’s approach could hardly be bolder, but I’d still pay good money to see 
Canadian director Denis Villeneuve take on a Shakespearean tragedy. He 
practically directs the climactic reckoning of Mexican cartel thrillerSicario 
(Lionsgate, 15) like one, albeit with a far terser cast of characters.

 Watch the trailer for Sicario. 
Like Villeneuve’s strappingly silly Prisoners 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/guy-lodge-on-dvds-and-downloads+prisoners>
, it’s a film I recall chiefly for its astonishing visual and sonic textures. 
Its black-opal cinematography and raging, reverberating score have both been
deservedly Oscar nominated 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/oscars-2016-full-list-of-nominations-awards-movies>
. Beneath its glittering tar surfaces, however, there’s a somewhat chiding 
moral irony to this story of an FBI agent (Emily Blunt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/emily-blunt>) drafted into a task force of 
uncertain allegiance to bring down a major druglord. The film even makes a smug 
virtue of short-changing its heroine: Blunt is phased out of the narrative just 
as her character is stymied at every turn by misogynist male authorities. It’s 
up to the viewer to decide on the merits of that mirroring.

 Watch the trailer for The Walk. 
Also masking a less than illuminating story framework with startlingly 
advanced technique isThe Walk (Sony, PG), Robert Zemeckis’s narrative account of
Philippe Petit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/20/philippe-petit-twin-towers-tightrope>
’s landmark tightrope crossing between New York’s former twin towers – a film 
that, coming seven years after James Marsh’s Oscar-winning Petit docMan on Wire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/man-on-wire>, is hard pressed to avoid 
seeming superficial and superfluous by comparison. Vertiginous visual effects 
wizardry makes the film a triumph of physical sensation, though even its 
stomach-rearranging spectacle takes a tumble on a 2D television format.

Woody Allen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/woodyallen>’s Irrational Man 
(Warner, 12), on the other hand, feels just as vindictively small on DVD as it 
did in cinemas. Kant-inspired only in the manner of a student zealously taking 
a highlighter to his text, this greyish noir proves as listlessly academic as
Joaquin Phoenix <https://www.theguardian.com/film/joaquin-phoenix>’s 
protagonist – a disaffected philosophy professor prone to contemplating, as a 
number of Allen’s men have been known to do, the perfect murder. Solely 
enlivened byParker Posey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/14/parker-posey-woody-allen-irrational-man>
 as an aggressively amorous colleague, it at least occupies the stranger corner 
of Allen’s lower tier.

 Watch the trailer for Life. 
Anton Corbijn <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/anton-corbijn>’s Life 
(Entertainment One, 15) takes a rueful, elegiac approach to the often bland 
terrain of Hollywood icon portraiture. Viewed twice over through a 
photographer’s eyes – Corbijn’s first, then those of celebrated showbiz snapper 
Dennis Stock, played on screen byRobert Pattinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/robert-pattinson> – it’s a James Dean study 
that doesn’t look behind the iconography but into it, considering the tension 
between Dean’s constructed and distracted selves, both given inspired life by 
the remarkable Dane DeHaan.

Corbijn’s film deserved more patient consideration last year from critics and 
audiences, as didMiss You Already (Entertainment One, 12), a tear-stained 
terminal disease drama that is stoutly, unfashionably honest in its embrace of 
melodrama and emotional candour, however ugly the ensuing cry. As the 
soon-to-be-separated best friends at its centre,Toni Collette 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/toni-collette-five-best-moments> 
andDrew Barrymore <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/drew-barrymore> gift the 
film with a rare, sustained flash of human connection. The same, to more 
sweetly shuffling emotional ends, can be said for the direct-to-DVD French 
miniatureDans la cour (Studiocanal, 15), starring the appealingly odd match of 
Catherine Deneuve <https://www.theguardian.com/film/catherinedeneuve> and 
Gustave Kervern as two emotionally singed, socially opposed inhabitants of the 
same Parisian apartment block, each of whom finds an improbably sympathetic ear 
in the other.

 ‘Ravishing impression of place’: Nozipho Nkelemba and Zenzo Ngqobe in The 
Forgotten Kingdom. Photograph: Allstar/Black Kettle Films 
To close, a release limited to digital platforms. Hailed as the first feature 
film to emerge from the landlocked southern African state of Lesotho, Andrew 
Mudge’sThe Forgotten Kingdom 
<https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-forgotten-kingdom/id888191970> is less 
novel than that claim might suggest. A traditionally structured personal 
odyssey, it follows young Atang (the disarming Zenzo Ngqobe) on a quest to 
return his father’s ashes to their rolling native land. But its ravishing 
impression of place nestles in the memory, as does its ambitious union of 
magical and social realism – much of the latter concerning the country’s 
ongoing Aids crisis. No landmark in itself, then, but the growing regularity of 
new African releases on streaming outlets is heartening.
