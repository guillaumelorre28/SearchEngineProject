Once the city’s abattoir, awarded an architectural prize in 1906, the 
S’Escorxador cultural centre had various reincarnations before its central 
building opened in June last year as the Mercado Gastronómico San Juan, Palma’s 
first gourmet food market. The £2m renovation of the 110-year-old dusky-pink 
building is stunning, from the high, beamed ceilings to the patterned tiles on 
the floors. But the real attraction is not the interior design, of course; it’s 
the food.

 The century-old building has been extensively renovated. 
Open 365 days a year, the market claims to serve 260 dishes and 361 wines 
through its 20 different vendors. It’s an assault course of temptations. When I 
visited, stallholders on one side were whipping upfideuá, a variation on paella 
made with noodles, and on the other there was a ready-made banquet of 
Basque-stylepintxos.

Some of the stalls were good without being fancy, such as the fresh fish 
counter by the entrance, where we pointed to our preferred creature in the 
chiller, then said whether we wanted it fried or grilled. But others served 
dishes worthy of high-end restaurants. The tasting platter (€5 for four) from 
the croqueta stall was my undisputed highlight. Crisp on the outside, smooth as 
fondant inside, they oozed molten cheese, creamy cod, or puréed spinach with 
pine nuts.

“You might want dessert,” said my lcoal friend – who lives close by and knows 
the market’s secret corners – as we finished the last of thecalamares and 
padrón peppers. No matter how full they are, no one with a sweet tooth could 
resist the adjoining patisserie. Styled like a separate tea room, it had glass 
cabinets packed with bite-size meringues, macaroons, fruit tarts and 
multicoloured eclairs.

Be warned: if you or someone you travel with has a habit of posting pictures 
of food porn on social media, you could be here some time. San Juan is an 
Instagrammer’s orgy.
