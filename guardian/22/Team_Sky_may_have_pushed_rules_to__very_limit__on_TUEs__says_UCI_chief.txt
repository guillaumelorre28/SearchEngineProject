Team Sky <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky> may have pushed rules 
“to the very limit” over Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUE), the International 
Cycling Union president, Brian Cookson, has said amid an investigation by the 
UK anti-doping agency into British Cycling.

Team Sky and the former Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins have been in the 
spotlight over his use of TUEs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/dave-brailsford-defends-bradley-wiggins-tue>
, which allow athletes to take banned substances for verified medical needs and 
are signed off by sports federations.

Ukad has not shared many details but it has been reported the investigation 
also concerned the alleged delivery of a medical package to team Sky in June 
2011 after the Critérium du Dauphiné and before that year’s Tour.

“We shouldn’t be surprised when elite sports teams push to the very limit of 
the rules. Perhaps that’s what happened here, but the rules appear to have been 
abided by,” Cookson said at the road world championships in Doha.

Data leaked last month by the Russian-based Fancy Bears hacking site claimed 
Wiggins had been given permission to have legal injections of the banned drug 
triamcinolone to treat breathing difficulties before the 2011 and 2012 Tour de 
France and 2013 Tour of Italy.

On each occasion the TUE was approved by British authorities and cycling’s 
governing body, the UCI, and there is no suggestion Wiggins broke any rule.

“The issue of the substances issued to Wiggins appears to have been within the 
rules,” Cookson said. “But I think there is an argument to be had about whether 
TUEs for that kind of substance are valid.”
