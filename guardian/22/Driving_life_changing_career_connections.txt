When Heidi Holmes first met Lucy Lloyd at age 14, they were both two country 
girls competing for a scholarship place at an inner Melbourne secondary school.

While they immediately hit it off, little did they know that two decades on 
they would be working together on a startup business for mentoring valued at 
over $2 million after the first capital raise.

“We were having a conversation over a wine about how we had personally been 
frustrated finding and connecting with a mentor,” Holmes recalls today of the 
initial spark. “We thought we could solve this issue in a digital context.”

Says Lloyd: “We believe the right connection can change your life.” 

From this catch-up between old friends in 2013 came Mentorloop, an online 
portal aimed at changing the way big business runs its mentoring programs.

We believe the right connection can change your life."

The software solution uses a machine learning “matching” algorithm that aims 
to widen the talent base and improve on traditional relationships relying on 
existing personal networks.

“It’s about changing how people view mentors and helping organisations 
implement company-wide mentoring rather than having a siloed approach,” Holmes 
says.

“We want to make mentoring more accessible for more people. We think modern 
mentoring can play out in a number of different formats - across departments, 
hierarchies, locations - even across different companies.”

Lloyd says the algorithm evolved from a “profile form” like a dating site to 
become something more sophisticated, using predictive analytics to assess how 
the relationship is progressing.

“We quickly realised that once the administrative burden is out of the way 
then measuring quality is what organisations are looking for and having the 
real time analytics to do it,” she says.

“We are tracking quality in the mentoring relationship and using the algorithm 
to predict future quality. We are collecting data to make sure we know what 
good mentoring is.”

Despite being friends and going to school together for four years, the pair 
come to their business from different career paths.

It’s the second startup for Holmes, who developed and sold an online jobs 
business for mature age workers called Adage after completing a tax cadetship 
and working with KPMG for almost a decade.

Lloyd, meanwhile, entered the then-fledgling digital space via agencies in 
London and Melbourne in the mid-2000s after starting her career in project 
management in the public service.

The pair began working on Mentorloop in earnest in 2015 while part of the NAB 
Village community in Melbourne’s Bourke St, mingling with its mix of 
professionals, primary producers, not-for-profits and small business operators.

“It was a great space for us to meet,” Holmes says. “It really made you feel 
like you were working on a business not a lifestyle.

“We found it was not only a great working environment but the assets and 
resources enabled us to elevate the position we were in.”

For Lloyd it was an opportunity to listen and learn from others involved in 
their own startup journey as she worked with Holmes on creating a minimum 
viable product to take to market.

“When I moved back to Melbourne in 2009 the digital industry was comparatively 
fragmented,” she says. “I wish I could have found someone then to tell me where 
to focus if you wanted to progress but it was really hard to navigate that 
scene.

“The best advice we’ve had is from startups at the same level or a couple of 
months ahead of us.”

After recently concluding the initial $300,000 raise with a range of private 
investors, including StartupAUS director Glenn Smith, Mentorloop can count 
among clients Melbourne Water, IOOF, Monash University and the West Australian 
Government.

As part of its operational philosophy and design, the company has also been 
accredited with B Corp certification for its sustainable practices as Holmes 
and Lloyd aim to grow a profitable business that creates a positive impact on 
the world.

“I believe we are solving a global problem and not doing it just for one per 
cent of the population,” Holmes says. “Our tagline is ‘making mentoring 
mainstream’. We believe this can elevate people in their lives and their career 
and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning.”

Both women, now in their 30s, come from the land in Victoria and also credit 
seeing their parents working in small business and managing budgets as an 
ongoing inspiration.

Holmes says: “There was always the intention I wanted to work for myself. Now 
we are at a point where we can bring the mentoring concept to life.

“We want to make it available to any individual who wants to improve 
themselves and remove what were formerly barriers. We are creating and enabling 
these life-changing relationships.”

NAB’s Executive General Manager Business Direct and Small Business Leigh 
O’Neill says helping business customers like Holmes and Lloyd achieve their 
dreams is a big part of what makes the job so rewarding.

“It takes hard work and determination to turn ideas into successful ventures, 
and I see this repeatedly in our business customers,” O’Neill says. “For Heidi 
and Lucy, their passion and drive is infectious and as a bank, we want to be 
absolutely part of their journey.

“Mentoring exposes both the mentor and the mentee to new experiences, ideas 
and approaches, and I often hear from our business customers how important this 
relationship can be in building a successful business.

“It is admirable that Heidi and Lucy saw a gap in the accessibility of 
mentoring and came up with this innovative, digital solution. We are proud to 
support them as their business model evolves and grows.”

“NAB’s Village community opened in February 2014 as a place open for all 
business customers to work, learn and connect with each other as the Mentorloop 
founders have demonstrated so well,” she adds.

Mentorloop’s start-up business journey and key insights and challenges around
