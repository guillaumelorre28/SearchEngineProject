Tourists have yet to really discover this place that’s close to the centre of 
Porto. Ceramic artistJoaquim Pombal <http://joaquimpombal.blogspot.co.uk/> has 
turned an old fruit market into a studio with beautiful gardens. He makes 
traditional hand-painted blue-and-white Portuguese tiles, larger pieces and 
ceramic murals. People can visit and see him at work: you just need to call in 
advance. You can even join a workshop (two hours €35pp for six, €75pp private) 
and have a go yourself.
 Avocado-stuffed endives and quinoa at Pomar do Pomba 
I discovered it about 10 years ago when I was looking to set up an organic 
farm and was surprised by how green and peaceful it is there. A lot of produce 
is grown in the gardens and Joaquim’s wife, Anabela, is a raw food expert. Book 
a week in advance and they’ll make you a lunch of home-grown produce: things 
such as avocado-stuffed endives with quinoa (€35pp). It’s five minutes’ drive 
from the centre, or 15 by subway to Araújo, and shows a really different side 
of the city.
