Alexa Chung <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung> will launch a 
fashion line called Alexachung in May 2017. In a statement, the 32-year-old – 
with typical kook – commented: “With this first collection, I aim not only to 
delight your eyeballs but to furnish your wardrobe with all of your soon-to-be 
favourite pieces.”


The truth is, she’s probably on to something. Chung has, arguably, become one 
of the biggest influencers on what young women wear over the past decade. Her 
own line follows a series of collaborations with other brands including 
Madewell and Eyeko, drawing on her own personal style. After AG Jeans last 
year, Chung curated an Archive collection forMarks & Spencer in April 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/13/the-alexa-effect-behind-the-scenes-at-the-launch-of-archivebyalexa>
. Using her taste – retro chic filtered with an arched eyebrow – she took the 
wholesome staples from M&S over the years and made them appealing again for 
millennials. After a career as a model and TV presenter, Chung has found a 
niche mining her personal style and selling it back as new product. She is 
committed to this new venture: with six staff members recruited and stockists 
including Selfridges and matchesfashion.com on board.

Based on those collabs and staples in the Chung wardrobe, here are six things 
we predict you’ll be lusting after come in May next year.

time again. Don’t believe us? Have a look atthis link

own wardrobe as well as other members of the hotpant tribe.

The piecrust in Chung’s M&S collection was the breakout star, and no wonder. 
She’s a master of wearing a frill without looking like a)Margaret Thatcher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/03/no-style-icon-but-an-image-maker-why-margaret-thatcher-was-the-wrong-fit-for-the-va>
 or b)Prince George in a royal portrait 
<http://www.trbimg.com/img-55aebcdd/turbine/la-et-mg-prince-george-turns-2-birthday-portrait-mario-testino-20150721>
. She’s likely to use these skills for her own line. Expect piecrusts and other 
ironic thrift store items to abound.

This is a Chung festival staple and, with Chung watched like a hawk come June 
andGlastonbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/24/glastonbury-2016-athleisure-replaces-flower-crowns-and-vintage>
, it’s a no brainer. Worn this year with PVC trousers and Hunters, expect the 
design to be oversized with big pockets. All the better for contrasting with a 
slim silhouette from the waist down.

Sure, Chung had a hand in the ballet flat craze 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/apr/17/ballet-pumps-so-over> of the 
midnoughties. But there’s also the loafer – she has moved from the classic 
Russell & Bromley style to the fur-lined backlessGucci 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> ones (the fashion insider shoe of 
choice) in the past couple of years. Her own design will probably fall on the 
preppy side of the line – a penny loafer perhaps.

Maybe obvious but, when you’re a celebrity trying their hand at designing, 
obvious is your way in. Dungarees are such a Chung staple that they’re almost a 
cliche – a dictionary definition of Chung style. And that is exactly why she 
should include a pair in this collection.

 The cardigan, given that Chung spin. Photograph: John Parra/WireImage 
Chung has always used her resemblance to a young Jean Shrimpton as a 
counterpoint to wearing really boring clothes – the implication being if you 
look like that, you can wear dowdy and make it look cool. The cardigan – 
mohair, bobbly, long, grey – is the classic way to do this. There will have to 
be one here – and you’ll want it, whatever your own resemblance to Shrimpton 
might be.
