Nintendo’s next console looks like it may just be the Nintendo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo> console we’ve all been 
waiting for – at least since the Wii U was consigned to being the dustiest 
thing on our shelves. Eccentric, interesting, boasting widespread industry 
support and with a focus on portability that plays to Nintendo’s considerable 
strengths (Game Boy, DS, 3DS ...), the Switch is the veteran company’s attempt 
to reinvent gaming. Again.

Some of the biggest reveals from the Nintendo Direct broadcast included: the 
re-introduction of cartridge games, similar to those used in the 3DS; the fact 
thatBethesda’s Skyrim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/12/bethesda-teases-high-speed-multiplayer-quake-champions>
 remaster will be coming to the system, which is huge; and the removable side 
controls that can be slotted into a larger controller or used on their own as 
tiny little handheld gadgets that look like they may well cramp up podgier 
fingers in a few short minutes. They’re called Joy-Cons, a controversial naming 
decision which reminds some of the old Namco Jogcon pads and others of a 
euphemism for injuring yourself during sex.

While Wii U drew a handful of third-party triple A titles – including Watch 
Dogs <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/07/watch-dogs-review> and 
Assassin’s Creed III 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/oct/31/assassins-creed-3-review>
 – due to the machine’s limited processing power compared to the Xbox One and 
the PS4, those games were delayed, scaled down or just forgotten about, as fans 
opted for the consoles that have been home to those games for years.

Now, however, we’re seeing Skyrim on a Nintendo console. This would have been 
almost unimaginable five years ago. It’s hard to decide what the most important 
part of this is: Nintendo branching out into huge third-party franchises? 
Bethesda reaching out to Nintendo, forming what could be a lucrative future 
partnership? The graphical capability on the Switch finally matching Sony and 
Microsoft’s consoles? Being able to play Skyrim on the go? Seeing Nintendo 
finally realise how to market itself in a smart way? Or, perhaps, it’s all of 
the above. Whatever, it’s an incredibly exciting time to be a Nintendo fan.

The Switch trailer focused on the console’s portability above all, showcasing 
the different combinations of controller. There are the Joy-Cons, then the 
Joy-Con Grip, which turns two controllers into a larger more conventional pad, 
(that also somewhat resembles a goofy dog), and most importantly, the 
screen-plus-Joy-Cons format that allows for ultimate portability.

Some are already worried that the constant swapping and changing of the 
console’s detachable bits might lead to breakages, and though Nintendo consoles 
have never been as low-quality as, say, the DualShock 4’s disintegrating 
analogue pads, it’s a valid concern.

Tiny ass Nintendo Switch controllers...might be a prob. 

Also hope Nintendo did durability testing with all that swapping

<https://twitter.com/raywongy/status/789109896419667968> 
The trailer also showed the wide variety of locations you will be able to play 
in, suggesting that the Switch-screen-plus-Joy-Cons can be used without mains 
power or the internet. There were games being played in a park, on a plane, in 
the toilet – all very important locations.

There’s no price point on the Switch yet, but given Nintendo’s history with 
hardware launches (it has often cut back on costs by using cheaper components 
and materials than its competitors), it’s likely to come in at around the £300 
mark. The processor is a custom version ofNvidia’s Tegra processor 
<https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/10/20/nintendo-switch/>, usually found in 
smartphones and tablets. It’s not as powerful as the Xbox One or PS4, but 
Nintendo’s priorities have never been geared towards graphical capabilities, 
concentrating instead on form-factor, and innovative interfaces – the Wii 
Remote being the classic example.

On the negative side: custom-built hardware is a pain for developers to master 
and support: this may limit the machine’s role in major multi-platform release 
schedules and could also put many smaller studios off.
Ben Cousins (@BenjaminCousins) 
Who else is excited about developing for a low resolution Tegra tablet with 
stick on controls and physical media? Hell yeah!
 <https://twitter.com/BenjaminCousins/status/789153408813072384> October 20, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/BenjaminCousins/status/789153408813072384> 
However, the fact that this is a custom-built version of the Tegra means it’s 
at least optimised for this new machine, meaning – in theory – that developers 
will be able to garner greater performance from the chipset more easily. More 
importantly, using smartphone/tablet-orientated tech should mean increased 
battery life.

The tricky thing, and the thing we don’t know much about yet, is whether the 
Switch will have a strong enough launch lineup of games. This was one of the 
aspects that let the Wii U down – although games likeZombi U  
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/30/zombiu-review-wiiu>and 
Nintendoland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/01/nintendo-land-review> were 
excellent, they weren’t enough to drive consumers to the shops.

However, after the Wii U’s weak launch, it’s looking likely that Nintendo will 
bolster the launch of the Switch with two of its largest franchises 
<http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pok-mon-mario-and-zelda-headline-nx-dream-line-up/0170678>
, Zelda and Mario, and those are two games we’ve already seen glimpses of in 
the trailer. The next Zelda, as we already know, isBreath of the Wild 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/16/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-hands-on-preview>
 – which seems like an attempt at courting and combining the communities behind
Monster Hunter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/monster-hunter-generations-review-nintendo-capcom>
, Skyrim and the survival game genre.

The new 3D Mario is more of an unknown quantity, given the scant few seconds 
of footage teased in the trailer, but it looks like no Mario game we’ve seen 
before. It has the glorious lighting and vivid colours of Mario Kart 8 and the 
more recentColor Splash, 
<https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii-U/Paper-Mario-Color-Splash-1090845.html> 
and the 3D platforming open-world look ofSuper Mario Galaxy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/may/27/super-mario-galaxy-2-game-review>
 andSuper Mario 3D World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/19/super-mario-3d-world-review>
. Some have even pointed out that there are rings. Now, where have we seen 
rings before …?
Chris Schilling (@schillingc) 
Two things about that snippet of Mario Switch footage:
1. Triple-jump is back!
2. Rings. Sonic-like rings, in fact.

How will the new console fare for indies, though? Nintendo is notably 
lacklustre at supporting the independent game scene, whereas Sony and Microsoft 
both have initiatives to do so. Though it looks like the hardware will be 
off-putting to many, some smaller studios – mostly those that Nintendo has 
worked with in the past – are stepping up to the challenge.Image & Form

Despite patchy support, the Wii U 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/wii-u> did host an array of exciting 
indie titles that could have been hits had they enjoyed a larger install base 
to market to. Games like Teslagrad, Scram Kitty, Affordable Space Adventures 
and Swords & Soldiers II were all very strong, and deserved greater 
acknowledgement than they received. Perhaps the Switch will be a more stable 
home.


Nintendo’s focus, though, seems to be on the market that spans handheld and 
home consoles, and games like Skyrim and Breath of the Wild that have the space 
(and the budget) to stretch out far and wide. From the trailer, it looks like 
the target demographic is 20-somethings with unreasonably large living rooms 
and a desire to take their games on the go.

It’s an interesting move for a company that so often tries to play on the 
nostalgia of its older fans – but Nintendo has been attempting to break into 
that younger market for a while, with their varying levels of success in mobile 
games and toys-to-life.

There’s a lot we don’t know about the Switch just yet – but it does look like 
Nintendo has learned from the mistakes of therather disastrous Wii U 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/30/nintendo-cuts-sales-forecast-wii-u>
. That machine’s GamePad promised a degree of portable gaming, but the unit 
relied on its proximity to the host machine. Switch offers the freedom of a 
contained handheld unit with the performance and living room appeal of a 
console. It will be interesting to see if it will have the array of streaming 
video apps that we’ve become accustomed to from modern machines. We also don’t 
know if it’s a touchscreen or not.

Nintendo says it will reveal more information before the March launch. After 
the indifference that has haunted theWii 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/wii> U, the fact that the Switch 
generated as much hype and interest as the Red Dead Redemption 2 trailer 
suggests that this is a whole different proposition. Right now, the important 
thing isn’t that there are questions to be answered, it’s that people want to 
ask them.
