The former army chief David Morrison has defended himself against calls for 
his resignation as Australian of the Year for his failure to champion war 
veterans.

An online petition signed by 1300 people is calling for the former army chief 
to resign for what it says is his failure to support returned soldiers.

The petition also calls for Gen Morrison to relinquish the retired title of 
General for not using hisAustralia Day

champion the cause of physically and mentally disabled ADF personnel”.

Gen Morrison said he had always supported veterans and would continue to do so 
as Australian of the Year.

“As the grandson and son of veterans and a veteran myself, I care deeply about 
issues affecting the veteran community,” he said on Saturday morning.

The Walking Wounded founder and ex-serviceman Brian Freeman has also come out 
in support of Gen Morrison.

But the Defence Force Welfare Association’s David Jamieson has told the ABC 
Gen Morrison has long been a divisive figure in the defence community.

Jamieson called for him to “show active support for the causes that the 
veterans have taken up for their welfare and the welfare of their families”.
