Google and Facebook <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> will 
take more than 70% of all money spent on display advertising online in the UK 
by 2020, according to a report suggesting the firms will soon have an effective 
duopoly spanning the Atlantic.

The two companies already account for about three-quarters of the £18.4bn 
display ad market in the US, and 53% of the £4bn currently spent in the UK.

That growing dominance has put pressure on publishers such as newspapers, most 
of which have found it difficult to make money from large online audiences as 
print sales and advertising have fallen rapidly.Google 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> also dominates search 
advertising, which has largely replaced the classified ads which previously 
generated significant revenue for newspapers.

According to the report by OC&C Strategy Consultants, Facebook and Google will 
grow a combined 24% each year to 2020, taking a 71% share of the total ad 
market worth £4.1bn, more than the total value of display advertising in the UK 
today.

OC&C partner Fergus Jarvis said publishers had been worried about the impact 
of Facebook and Google for some time, but the scale of the threat was “quite 
concerning”. He said: “The scale and speed is really a call to action for media 
companies. By the time [Facebook and Google] get to 70% of the online ad 
market, that doesn’t leave a lot of space left elsewhere.”

The ability of Facebook and Google to hoover up money spent on ads is 
primarily due to people spending more time on smartphones. In the US the two 
firms have taken 85% of all new digital ad spending, the bulk of which is on 
mobile devices. “A lot of usage is going in that direction,” said Jarvis. “We 
are now at a pivot point where the average UK adult is spending more time 
looking at mobile content than TV. We assume that that trend will continue.”

Though the forecast suggests the two firms will dominate the future of display 
advertising based on current trends, there has been some pushback from 
advertisers concerned about their power. In particular, Facebook’s recent 
string of admissions that it had been providing inaccurate measurements for 
many of its ads, in some cases over estimating how much they were viewed by as 
much as 80%, has led tocalls for greater transparency

.

At the time, Sir Martin Sorrell, head of the world’s largest advertising 
group, WPP, said it was a “clear example that referee and player can’t be the 
same person and that marking your own homework doesn’t work”.

However, Jarvis later said Facebook was tackling the problem effectively. He 
said: “There’s quite a lot of sniping around that particular Facebook story. 
It’s not simple how you measure impact. Facebook are responding to some of the 
concerns. It’s a foolish man who bets against Facebook being able to handle 
those complaints.”
