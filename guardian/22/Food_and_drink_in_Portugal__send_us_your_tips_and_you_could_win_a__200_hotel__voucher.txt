Whatever part of Portugal you’ve visited, you probably have good memories of 
the food and drink. We want to hear about the fresh seafood at beach cafes, 
restaurants serving local specialities, and great bars in cities like Porto and 
Lisbon. Send us a tip – remembering to tell us why the place is so special – 
and you could win a £200 hotel voucher. Contribute viaGuardianWitness 
<https://witness.guardian.co.uk/>.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
fromHotels.com <http://www.hotels.com/>, allowing you stay in over 260,000 
places worldwide. Submit your tips by clicking on the blue button and using the 
text tab. Try and include as much detail as possible (location, any website 
addresses, prices etc) and feel free to add a photo if you own the copyright to 
it –but it’s the text we’ll be judging! 


Your tip should be around 100 words long. Terms and conditions
