Marcel Kittel and André Greipel have condemned the use of therapeutic use 
exemptions in cycling, with the former suggesting those who suffer from “bad 
asthma” should compete in the Paralympics.

Kittel, the 28-year-old Etixx-Quick-Step rider, told Süddeutsche Zeitung 
<http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/radsport-kittel-ueber-wiggins-deswegen-haben-wir-die-paralympics-eingefuehrt-1.3205241>
 that those with severe cases of the respiratory condition should not compete 
in “elite sport”.

“When someone has bad asthma then he has nothing in elite sport to do,” Kittel 
said. “That’s why we introduced the Paralympics, so that the one-legged 
[athletes] had a chance to measure themselves against others.”

Greipel, meanwhile, has said that the leak of documents by Fancy Bears last 
month, showing Sir Bradley Wiggins and Team Sky had obtained permission on 
three occasions to use the banned corticosteroid triamcinolone, explained why 
the British teamare not part of the MPCC

Crédible).

“If you are ill then you’re not riding in any races,” Greipel said. “That’s 
why we’re in the MPCC. And now we know why Sky weren’t.”

Wiggins had applied for three TUEs to have injections of the triamcinolone 
immediately before major races

. The 2012 Tour de France winner has admitted he understands why the injections 
would be considered unethical but he did not break any doping rules.
