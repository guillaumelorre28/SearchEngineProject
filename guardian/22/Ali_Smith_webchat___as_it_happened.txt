I love your writing. Question: what’s with death and ghosts? The dead mum, the 
ghost of the painter, the dead girl in Hotel World... do you find they have a 
special voice?


This is random but one time I walked by the second hand bookstore in Balham I 
saw a fly and thought of one of your short stories. And the next time I walked 
the bookstore was sadly selling all its stock and closing.

The thing about bookstores is that people will always love them, I think. When 
one closes, with any luck, somewhere else, someone else is taking a chance on 
opening a bookstore.

Maybe someone could write a story about the ghost of a bookshop. Imagine the 
voices. Imagine the cacophony. Imagine the strange harmony.

EmilyBooks <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/2600697> asks:

I love your comments on the Guardian podcast about adolescents being wide open 
to the world, not yet fixed. It reminds me of Philip Pullman’s daemons and the 
moment at which they stop changing form... But I wondered also what you thought 
of Penelope Fitzgerald’s novels? She too has some wonderful children as key 
figures in otherwise very adult narratives.

I'm a Fitzgerald fan. For anyone who hasn't read At Freddy's, you have a great 
joy ahead of you. Her best novel about adolescents, I think, along with The 
Blue Flower. Thank you Emily.

Can you describe why you have such an affinity for trees in your writing?

I think it's because when you hold a book you're also holding a tree in one 
form or another, and that direct connection lets me know how important books 
are in the world. Pages are called leaves, a spine of a book comes from the 
spine of the animal whose skin was used in the first books as covers; 
everything about books refers us back to the physical world. Not that ebook 
readers aren't useful for those of us whose eyes are getting worse with age. 
But the reading of a book - a physical book - lets us know how time is passing, 
and how we are passing time, in something more than percentage numbers.

Oh easy! You'll know this one. Lewis Grassic Gibbon, A Scots Quair. It went 
into me like goodness when I was in my teens, a work whose rhythms are heart 
rhythms, whose politics remakes the novel, and whose originality still sustains 
me every time I read it.

When I first suggested it to my editor (I had to check it would be technically 
possible), it immediately enthused all three people I spoke to. They responded 
with incredible warmth and I was very surprised. So when I got the go-ahead I 
had some of that warmth as accompaniment, and that welcoming openness has 
characterised people's response to this book. I'm still surprised and 
incredibly glad. People seem really to take to the dimensional aspect - the 
notion that no story travels alone, that there's always at least one 
accompanying story, without which you're only getting half.

Hello leonzos. My advice would be: stop trying to write metaphysical stories 
and instead, just write a story. That way any metaphysics will kick in on its 
own terms. There is no secret you know - it's a straightforward contract 
between writer and thing written - the only real concern for anyone writing a 
story is the story itself.

When writing from the perspective of a modern teenager (like George in How to

right? From what I have seen (and remember from when I was that age) kids talk 
differently among themselves than they do to adults.

It's probably the closest thing resembling research I ever do (except for this 
last book, which took more traditional research) - listen to speech patterns. 
They're everywhere, on the train, in the street, in the shops, on TV, wherever 
you are. And yes, everyone's speech pattern changes depending on where and to 
whom they're talking. Ears open. Literally. (which is the word said about sixty 
times in five minutes by a group of teenagers sitting further up the train from 
me on my way here).

The thing about bookstores is that people will always love them, I think. When 
one closes, with any luck, somewhere else, someone else is taking a chance on 
opening a bookstore.

Maybe someone could write a story about the ghost of a bookshop. Imagine the 
voices. Imagine the cacophony. Imagine the strange harmony.

I think it's because when you hold a book you're also holding a tree in one 
form or another, and that direct connection lets me know how important books 
are in the world. Pages are called leaves, a spine of a book comes from the 
spine of the animal whose skin was used in the first books as covers; 
everything about books refers us back to the physical world. Not that ebook 
readers aren't useful for those of us whose eyes are getting worse with age. 
But the reading of a book - a physical book - lets us know how time is passing, 
and how we are passing time, in something more than percentage numbers.

I love your blethering North of Scotland style, you are the only person who 
writes like I speak.

Also ‘Look upon the world with love’ is my favourite quote from your stories.

Which book do you wish more people knew about?

Oh easy! You'll know this one. Lewis Grassic Gibbon, A Scots Quair. It went 
into me like goodness when I was in my teens, a work whose rhythms are heart 
rhythms, whose politics remakes the novel, and whose originality still sustains 
me every time I read it.

The strangest thing I've ever done is probably this webchat.

Were you ever afraid that the alternating seconds of the novel would be taken 
as a gimmick, and people wouldn’t get it? How have you found the reactions so 
far?

When I first suggested it to my editor (I had to check it would be technically 
possible), it immediately enthused all three people I spoke to. They responded 
with incredible warmth and I was very surprised. So when I got the go-ahead I 
had some of that warmth as accompaniment, and that welcoming openness has 
characterised people's response to this book. I'm still surprised and 
incredibly glad. People seem really to take to the dimensional aspect - the 
notion that no story travels alone, that there's always at least one 
accompanying story, without which you're only getting half.

I’ve been trying to write metafictional stories but something is missing. It 
can easily come across as literary masturbation or self involved showiness. Is 
the secret humour, lightness, being quick on your feet?

Do you ever worry that you exhaust your readers or put too much demand upon 
them?

Hello leonzos. My advice would be: stop trying to write metaphysical stories 
and instead, just write a story. That way any metaphysics will kick in on its 
own terms. There is no secret you know - it's a straightforward contract 
between writer and thing written - the only real concern for anyone writing a 
story is the story itself.

When writing from the perspective of a modern teenager (like George in How to 
be Both) how worried are you about getting their patterns of speech and slang 
right? From what I have seen (and remember from when I was that age) kids talk 
differently among themselves than they do to adults.

It's probably the closest thing resembling research I ever do (except for this 
last book, which took more traditional research) - listen to speech patterns. 
They're everywhere, on the train, in the street, in the shops, on TV, wherever 
you are. And yes, everyone's speech pattern changes depending on where and to 
whom they're talking. Ears open. Literally. (which is the word said about sixty 
times in five minutes by a group of teenagers sitting further up the train from 
me on my way here).
