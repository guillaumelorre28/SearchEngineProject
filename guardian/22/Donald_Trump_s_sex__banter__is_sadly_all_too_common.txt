I can’t stand Donald Trump but I can stand hypocrisy even less. Are we 
seriously pretending that the way Trump spoke about women (Apology for sex

powerful, entitled men, whatever their politics? When I was at university I 
walked out of a dinner party full of public schoolboys who had spent the entire 
evening discussing the breasts of our fellow undergraduates. The other girls 
didn’t seem to mind, but I did and I still do. Women – walk out. Men – grow up.

• Could we please have an end to the endless pictures of models with very grim 
looks on their faces (Vuitton twists a classic to blend fashion with a slice of 
commerce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/05/louis-vuitton-luxury-goes-futuristic-at-paris-fashion-week>
, 6 October)? The models and clothes would look so much more appealing with a 
pleasant face, or even a smile, instead of the sour zombie glares.
