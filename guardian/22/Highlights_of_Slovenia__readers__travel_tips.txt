Winning tip: President Tito’s Tearoom, Lake Bled

As you walk round Lake Bled, past Villa Bled, a little sign saying “Tearoom” 
points upwards through the trees. It gives no indication of the wow factor this 
tearoom commands. Once used by President Tito, it recently reopened with the 
original furniture and photos. Have a cup of coffee on the patio with its 
stunning floor mosaics of wild animals, while you look out over the lake 
towards the church, and the castle beyond. It is a treasure of pure elegance, 
the prices are ridiculously reasonable and the coffee just gorgeous!

We came across this park – in the north of the country near the Austrian 
border – by accident, and thought it the most beautiful spot in the country, 
with just a few homes amid mountains and the greenest green you’ve ever seen. 
Spend a few days cycling, doing walks to the waterfall, or hanging out with 
your new neighbours who, we found, were more than happy to share their homemade 
whisky and spit-roasted pig. Stay atLenar Tourist Farm <http://www.lenar.si/en/>
 (doubles €70 B&B) and soak it all in from a hammock. The small park fee (€7 
for a car) is worth it when it’s this good.

The scenic train journey from Jesenice to Nova Gorica on the Bohinj railway 
<http://www.bohinj.si/en/about_bohinj/learn_about_bohinj/cultural_attractions/history_railway_tourism>
 takes you from the north to the Italian border in the east. In fact, the 
Slovenian-Italian border runs through Nova Gorica station car park! You pass 
through dramatic mountain scenery and follow the brilliantly turquoise Sava 
river, before crossing the 220-metre-long stone bridge at Solkan. Nova Gorica 
itself has an international border down the middle, dividing the former 
communist part of town in modern-day Slovenia from its more picturesque part, 
Gorizia in Italy.

If you go to Postojna to see the amazing caves, don’t miss Predjama Castle 
<http://www.slovenia.info/en/grad/Predjama-Castle.htm?grad=654&lng=2>, a 
fortress built into a cave mouth 10km away.Erazem passage 
<http://www.slovenia.info/en/jamarstvo/Cave-trip-Erazem-passage.htm?jamarstvo=4516&lng=2>
 is a precipitous gap in the cave used as a hiding place when enemies attacked. 
If you’re brave (and don’t get claustrophobic) you can climb the slippery 
rocks, but the less intrepid can walk around the cave inside the castle and 
enjoy the eeriness.

GP Trojane restaurant

East of Ljubljana, the GP Trojane restaurant and shop is renowned for Trojane 
krof, a large jam doughnut that every Slovenian enjoys. It also serves many 
traditional dishes. To eat like a Slovenian, I recommend soup withrezanci 
(noodles, €2.50), and some of the many local sausages on offer (€8-10) at this 
beautiful place in the Sava hills.

Kobarid is a charming little town in the stunning Julian Alps. The area has 
plenty to offer to adrenaline junkies and history buffs alike. Hisa Franko is a 
superb gourmet restaurant, and I still dream about it months later. All the 
dishes use seasonal ingredients which are locally sourced. Delicate flavours 
are combined in a magical way and dishes are accompanied by excellent Slovenian 
wines.

When you’ve done Lake Bled, don’t leave without catching the bus to 
Radovljica. A charming, quiet, laid-back town with a stunning medieval square 
and easy bus and train connections to Ljubljana, it also boasts a number of 
bizarre but brilliant museums, including the chance to discover the secret 
history of Slovenian apiculture at theBeekeeping Centre

 Božidar Jakac Art Museum 
With its centre on a small island, the town of Kostanjevica na Krki is perfect 
for enjoying a coffee by the river Krka, or paddling around on a boat. Just 
nearby is Božidar Jakac Art Museum, in a former monastery dating from the 13th 
century and surrounded by the oak sculptures of the Forma Viva Sculpture Park.

Slovenia’s a land of castles, lakes and spine-tingling caves, so it seems 
fitting that it has a one-room museum dedicated to the ultimate fairytale 
foodstuff: gingerbread. Between Ljubljana and Bled is Radovlijca, where you’ll 
find (in the Old Town) Gostilna Lectar, a guesthouse-cum-restaurant-cum-shop 
with a downstairs secret. For €1.5, you descend the stairs for an introduction 
to the history of this confection, made here since 1766. It is now sold in a 
multitude of shapes – hearts mostly but also cars, houses, rabbits and chickens 
– and painstakingly iced in bright, bold colours (including your chosen gift 
message). Our “souvenirs” certainly didn’t last long.

In the far north-west of Slovenia is a quiet pretty town called Bovec. It lies 
in a valley surrounded by mighty mountains and can be reached by a drive along 
the beautiful river Soca. It stood in for Narnia in the Prince Caspian film. 
Bovec attracts adrenalin junkies from around Europe but also offers less 
challenging pursuits. Start the day with excellent cheeseborek and apple 
strudel from the bakery. Then feast on the activities available locally. Try 
rafting, kayaking or, even more exhilarating, hydrospeeding. Want a go at 
canyoning? Walking? There are plenty of opportunities.
