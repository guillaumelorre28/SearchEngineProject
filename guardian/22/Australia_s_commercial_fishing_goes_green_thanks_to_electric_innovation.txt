South Australian blue swimmer crab fisherman Dennis Holder is a long way from 
home.

After helping to develop and lead the local industry for more than 30 years, 
Holder is in the Arctic Circle on a Norwegian vessel testing the sort of green 
technology he says could transform Australia’s aging commercial fishing fleet.

“My ultimate aim is to put an electric boat in the water for fishing,” he says 
from the other side of the world. “I would suggest I can reduce the diesel and 
carbon footprint by up to 80 per cent.”

Holder and his wife Karen operate the largest commercial blue swimmer crab 
fishing business in Australia. From Largs North, next to Port Adelaide, they 
handle about 250-tonnes a year, selling to top restaurants and markets around 
the country. And now they are aiming to lead the sustainability drive.

I would suggest I can reduce the diesel and carbon footprint by up to 80 per 
cent.

After an initial apprenticeship as a motor mechanic, Holder – an admitted “rev 
head” – says he has always been interested in tinkering with engines and 
finding innovative solutions through technology.


And today, that means being progressive and creating a better environment for 
his crew, his crabs and for the planet.

Holder says the existing Australian commercial fishing fleet is more than 30 
years old and current working conditions are not attracting the next generation.

“We’ve got old, smelly boats that are noisy,” he says. “We are really 
struggling to bring on the next generation – we want young people to come 
fishing but you have to change. A lot of people don’t believe we are 
sustainable. We have to take ownership of that.”

Holder has already replaced his three smaller boats with the purpose-built 24m 
Silver Spectre, an aluminium vessel whose size and efficiencies have meant 
cutting the carbon footprint of the business by 50% and reducing fishing time 
to improve work-life balance.

Since launching Silver Spectre in 2010, Holder has been able to catch his full 
quota in just 320 days – down from around 1200 – while still employing the same 
number of crew.

The state-of-the-art fishing equipment has also reduced the bycatch of 
juveniles by 92%, while an onboard “super chiller” can take the crabs to zero 
degrees within 30 minutes to retain their freshness.

His current project is being supported by Nuffield Australian Farming 
Scholarships, an annual program that gives local farmers the opportunity to 
travel abroad to gain experience in global agriculture techniques and 
management skills and then bring this knowledge home.

Inspired by rides in a Tesla and on an electric pushbike, Holder successfully 
applied for the program by outlining his vision for an electric boat to be used 
for Australian commercial fishing.

He started his first official research trip in January this year, attending an 
electric and hybrid technologies marine conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
He has since met experts across the globe as he works on ways to make his 
vision a reality.

As part of his travels he discovered a boat builder in Norway who has made 
what Holder believes is the first fully electric commercial fishing boat in the 
world – the very one he is currently examining.

Holder’s own prototype is for a 28m catamaran that runs electric motors on 
each side providing enough battery power to get through a typical 10 to 11 hour 
work day. The design also includes 200sqm of solar panels on the roof as well 
as a diesel generator.

“There’s no doubt it will be expensive to build,” he says. “Leading edge 
technology is always expensive. But a silent emissions free workday is the 
dream. Whether that’s achievable and how much it costs is to be advised.

“But what I’ve done in the past six years has been amazing, and the next step 
will be massive as well. I have always been an industry leader and progressive. 
It has been part of my passion since I became involved in the industry in 1986.”

Holder has to produce a full report for Nuffield by September next year, which 
means having the theoretical boat down on paper as well as doing the 
cost/benefit analysis for the industry.

He aims to have his own business carbon neutral within the next five years 
through technology or offset schemes, and believes hybrid electric technology 
is going to become “fairly widespread” in Australia over the next decade.

His advice for the next generation of fishermen and farmers is to look at 
getting a degree in electrical engineering or computers to accommodate advances 
on the land and on our oceans.

“We are too small to be a commodity so we have to specialise and do the best 
we can,” he says. “It’s just getting into that headspace and working out how to 
do it. An electric boat is going to be a massive thing to do that.”

He is also developing a processing plant in Largs North that will produce 
premium crabmeat product. He hopes taking the industry in greener direction 
will make it more appealing to customers increasingly interested in the 
provenance of food.

NAB’s Head of Agribusiness SA and WA, Matt O’Dea, says the bank is delighted 
to support Holder in all his business and environmental endeavours.

“At NAB, we’re incredibly proud to back businesses that are leaders in their 
field. Dennis and Karen operate both a successful fishing business and are 
pioneers in sustainability.”

NAB is Australia’s largest agribusiness bank with teams of professionals on 
the ground helping customers invest in innovative products and solutions.

“It’s been great to watch the business keep growing and the courageous ideas 
that Dennis has to create a more sustainable industry.

“We’re really pleased to be there for Dennis and his team along the journey,” 
O’Dea adds.

Holder returns to Australia in July after this latest trip to Tromso in 
northern Norway, taking the electric boat out through the fjords and fishing 
for cod.

And he’s looking forward to again tasting his home recipe of crab pasta with 
fresh meat, white wine, ginger, chili, salt and pepper and a bit of baby 
spinach mixed through.
