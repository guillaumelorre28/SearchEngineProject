Anyone who’s just pulled an all-nighter might start to feel a little wonky 
right now, but comfort can come from knowing you’re totally fashion. One look 
emerging atLondon Collections Men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-collections-men> is what we have 
dubbed: ‘party face’. Think that glow - aka a thin film of sweat - that comes 
from spending all night dancing at a rave, as seen at Lou Dalton. Or the 
unapologetically sweaty hair at Rory Parnell-Mooney. Arguably the most 
mood-appropriate ‘party face’ hair style came at Christopher Shannon, who 
referenced Marbella in his show notes. Models had visible foam smooshed into 
their hair, as if they had just emerged, blinking into the Spanish light, from 
a foam party. And if that isn’t a good excuse for an all-nighter, we don’t know 
what is.
