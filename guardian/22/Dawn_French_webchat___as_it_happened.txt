OK, looks like we're finished, so please remember to read my book, According 
to Yes (out tomorrow), and feel free to come and see me in 30 Million Minutes 
(Vaudeville Theatre, from 11 November), but only if you want to enjoy 
yourself...

Apologies for those I didn't get a chance to answer - nothing personal, it's 
just I don't like you! No seriously, I'm off, I have an appointment with The 
One Show. Cheerio!

Difficult. All I know is that when Jennifer and I started out there were 
hardly any other women. In a way, this was to our advantage. Now, thankfully, 
there are many more, including Jennifer's own daughter, so it's clear that many 
more young women are regarding it as a potential career. Hooray! But it's still 
not enough. C'mon girls, step up to stand up!

I agree with you, that Geraldine Granger should be a bishop at the very least. 
What a good idea! As for my thought for the day, I would focus on this: a poem 
I read last year by Jane Hershfield:

I moved my chair into sun 
I sat in the sun 
The way hunger is moved when called fasting

What a potent little poem. I have taken it to mean that you CAN change your 
mindset about anything in your life, so that would be it.

I wanted to say that I very much enjoyed Dear Fatty, and I thought Liza 
Tarbuck did a fantastic job of the audio book. I also wanted to thank you for 
your clothing line, it made me feel a little better about myself.

If it isn’t too personal I wondered if you would mind sharing how long it took 
you to come to the decision to adopt Billy? My husband and I are struggling 
with infertility at the moment and adoption is starting to pop into our 
consciousness.

So glad you enjoyed Dear Fatty. You're right, Liza did a great job of the 
audiobook. I asked her to read it for me because some parts of the book were 
too painful for me to read aloud. So I'm eternally grateful to her for handling 
it all so sensitively. Liza is in my top 5 women in the world.

Also glad that you liked the clothes from 1647, which is my clothing line with 
my partner Helen Teague. I can't believe it's still hard to find a good pair of 
trousers if you're a bit bigger than a size 0, it's so bafflingly stupid. We 
decided to make the trousers a bit bigger so that curvy girls can get dressed 
and get on with their lives.

I wouldn't call present day comedy poor, just different. Believe me, there was 
plenty of bad comedy around when we were younger as well. The good thing is 
that the cream always rises to the top. I wonder who will be the keepers from 
this present crop... Personally I love Josie Long, Jayde Adams, Birthday 
Girls...

Difficult. All I know is that when Jennifer and I started out there were 
hardly any other women. In a way, this was to our advantage. Now, thankfully, 
there are many more, including Jennifer's own daughter, so it's clear that many 
more young women are regarding it as a potential career. Hooray! But it's still 
not enough. C'mon girls, step up to stand up!

I agree with you, that Geraldine Granger should be a bishop at the very least. 
What a good idea! As for my thought for the day, I would focus on this: a poem 
I read last year by Jane Hershfield:

I moved my chair into sun 
I sat in the sun 
The way hunger is moved when called fasting

What a potent little poem. I have taken it to mean that you CAN change your 
mindset about anything in your life, so that would be it.

I wanted to say that I very much enjoyed Dear Fatty, and I thought Liza

your clothing line, it made me feel a little better about myself.

If it isn’t too personal I wondered if you would mind sharing how long it took 
you to come to the decision to adopt Billy? My husband and I are struggling

So glad you enjoyed Dear Fatty. You're right, Liza did a great job of the 
audiobook. I asked her to read it for me because some parts of the book were 
too painful for me to read aloud. So I'm eternally grateful to her for handling 
it all so sensitively. Liza is in my top 5 women in the world.

Also glad that you liked the clothes from 1647, which is my clothing line with 
my partner Helen Teague. I can't believe it's still hard to find a good pair of 
trousers if you're a bit bigger than a size 0, it's so bafflingly stupid. We 
decided to make the trousers a bit bigger so that curvy girls can get dressed 
and get on with their lives.

Jennifer and yourself were on some of the funniest series on TV at the time – 
why is it that comedy now is so poor in comparison - what is missing?

I remember really Laughing Out Loud eg sex with a television – “begging for 
it” – classic.

Please don’t say it’s me getting old – the other members of the forum will do 
that for you.

I wouldn't call present day comedy poor, just different. Believe me, there was 
plenty of bad comedy around when we were younger as well. The good thing is 
that the cream always rises to the top. I wonder who will be the keepers from 
this present crop... Personally I love Josie Long, Jayde Adams, Birthday 
Girls...
