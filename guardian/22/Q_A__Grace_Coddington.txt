What is your greatest fear? 
Having people over for dinner.

What is your earliest memory?
The first time I saw snow, when I was five. I was incredibly excited and crept 
out with my sister in our nightdresses and bare feet. I got sick the next day 
and was in trouble.

Which living person do you most admire?
All the people I work with, people like Anna Wintour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/anna-wintour> and Bruce Weber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/06/photography-bruce-weber-best-shot>

What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
I am a bit of a coward and easily panicked, which annoys me.

What is the trait you most deplore in others?
Loudness and pushiness.

What was your most embarrassing moment?
I went to photograph Prince Charles with Norman Parkinson – we did his 
official portrait for his investiture as the Prince of Wales. I completely

Probably a photograph.

What is your most treasured possession?
A scrapbook made for me by Bruce Weber when we did a shoot in the early 80s

.

What or who is the greatest love of your life?
Certainly all my cats.

What makes you unhappy?
I get a huge amount of junk mail from animal charities, because I send them 
money. The tragic photographs and stories make me very sad.

What do you most dislike about your appearance?
My hump. I stoop and don’t have a nice straight back.

Who would play you in the film of your life?
I am trying to put together a movie based on my memoir. Julianne Moore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliannemoore> would be good, and her 
daughter could play me as a young woman.

What is your most unappealing habit?
I am methodically slow, which drives some people crazy.

What did you want to be when you were growing up? 
A rock star, but I am tone deaf and really shy, so it was a fantasy.

Is it better to give or to receive?
I want to say it’s better to give, but I have trouble deciding what to give, 
so that becomes a stress.

What do you owe your parents?
They taught me discipline.

What was the best kiss of your life?
My first kiss when I was 14, with a boy who was staying in the hotel my 
parents ran. My knees went wobbly and he had to grab me before I fell.

What is the worst job you’ve done?
I was a really bad au pair. I don’t think I’m very good with children.

What is the closest you’ve come to death?
I was in a crash in London in the 1960s. My boyfriend drove through a red 
light and crashed into a van. My head struck the driving mirror. I had a lot of 
surgery.

What has been your biggest disappointment?
That one doesn’t stay agile all your life.
