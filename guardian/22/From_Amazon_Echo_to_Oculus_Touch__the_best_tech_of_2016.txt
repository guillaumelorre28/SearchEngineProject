2016 may have been a bad year for most things, but it was actually a pretty 
good year for technology, with plenty of new products and services released 
that were worth the digital ink used to describe them.

Price: from £20 per month

Traditional broadcast TV services have stagnated over the past couple of 
years, while over-the-top services such as Amazon Video, Netflix and the BBC’s 
iPlayer led the way. Sky’s Qdragged broadcast TV kicking and screaming into the 
21st century 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/sky-q-review-broadcast-satellite-pay-tv>
 with a modern interface, fast box and service that put time and place shifting 
at the heart of it.

It records, it downloads, it supports 4K and can spit video around your house 
via Q Mini boxes or the Q app on smartphones and tablets using your home 
network. Sky Q was pretty expensive at launch, but now is available from £20 
per month.

Bluetooth headphones are almost mainstream. From Beats and Bose to old school 
brands such as Sennheiser and Marshall, almost every manufacturer has a set. But
2016 was the year that truly wireless earbuds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-bragi-jabra-elite-earin-motorola>
 – no wires connecting them at all – became a thing.

Many tried and failed to produce wireless earbuds, but they weren’t capable of 
maintaining a stable connection between your ears because pushing the 
low-energy Bluetooth signal through your head when there’s any interference in 
the air is difficult.

Apple had to delay its AirPods, but at the end of 2016 Jabra’s Elite Sport and 
Bragi’s the Headphone proved it could be done. You’ll still have to pay early 
adopter prices, but they do what they say on the tin.

2016 was the year of virtual reality. From HTC’s Vive to Google’s Daydream, 
there was a headset to suit almost any budget. But it was the release of 
Oculus’ Touch controllers that really made VR an experience worth having.

The revolutionary hand controllers did more than just track the motions of 
your hands and give you buttons to squeeze. They actually tracked the position 
of your fingers on the controllers – you can point, grab, squeeze, give the 
thumbs up and pull a trigger with ease. The natural import of your hands into 
the virtual world is simply brilliant, even if you still need a £1,000 PC to 
run it.

We’d had curved screened smartphones before, but the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 
showed just why they were good 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow>
. With a stunning 5.5in curved-edge screen, Samsung made a phablet in the body 
of a standard smartphone. It made a large-screen experience in a 
non-hand-stretching size with an excellent camera, waterproofing, expandable 
storage and all-day battery life to boot.

Price: £150/£50

Voice assistants have been around in the form of Apple’s Siri and Google’s 
voice search since 2011. But it wasAmazon’s Echo speaker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/amazon-echo-review-the-best-combined-speaker-and-voice-assistant-in-the-uk>
 andEcho Dot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/amazon-echo-dot-review> 
that brought voice control into the British home.

For answering questions, reading the news, playing music and being an everyday 
assistant with timers, alarms, alerts and even being a calculator when you’re 
elbow deep in a DIY project, Alexa can do it all and amazingly can hear you 
above the racket of daily life.

But it was Alexa’s smarthome integration that really made the Internet of 
Things a reality, connecting and controlling disparate devices using voice 
commands. Want the lights on? Just ask. Maybe set the heating to a few degrees 
warmer? Yep. With the right equipment, it can even turn your TV over to the 
right channel and turn it all off when you head to bed.

Commuting sucks, but noise-cancelling headphones that block out the drone of 
your train, bus or aeroplane can make it a little more bearable. After years of 
avoiding wireless, Bose finally brought its world-leading noise-cancelling 
technology to Bluetooth headphones in the QC35s.

With an unrivalled ability to block out the world in a comfortable and 
sophisticated-looking frame, theQC35s are simply marvellous

It costs a pretty penny, but it’ll get on with the chores cleaning your home 
more effectively than any other robot while you’re out living rather than home 
vacuuming.

With a real leather battery case that detaches to leave a svelte screen with 
buttons, which gets out of the way to let the book shine on the front-lit 
screen, the Oasis is the e-reader to top all e-readers. A luxury in the digital

The Internet of Things is a mess of different smart devices that refuse to 
talk to each other.Samsung’s SmartThings Hub 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/samsung-smartthings-hub-review-internet-of-things>
 acts as the bridge between brands, connecting your Z-Wave, Zigbee and Wi-Fi 
devices into one big happy family.

Some devices are supported natively, but it is the large developer community 
working tirelessly to hack together ways to connect stubborn devices that 
really makes SmartThings. If you’re comfortable getting your hands a little 
dirty on the backend - with some pretty extensive instructions - then the Hub 
can join everything up and bring your house under control.
