They are works that have travelled through the centuries to form a priceless 
collection. So how do you make sure they can travel safely across the other 
side of the world to Australia?


This is a question Art Gallery of NSW head of exhibitions Charlotte Davy has 
faced more than once and admits she sleeps with the phone by her bed while 
every piece is in transit.

“The key is to minimise risk,” Davy says.

The Greats: masterpieces from the National Galleries of Scotland has been 
three years in the preparation and features more than 70 paintings and drawings 
from some of the biggest names in art history.

Da Vinci, Botticelli, Titian, Rembrandt, Monet, Gauguin, Cezanne and more are 
all here, letting visitors immerse themselves in a tour from the Renaissance to 
Post-Impressionism.

Taking custody of such treasures is something Davy takes extremely seriously: 
“How I deal with that professionally is to say that I would do this no matter 
if it was a culturally significant handkerchief that belonged to Captain Cook 
or it was a very valuable painting.

“But then there’s another part of me which is the personal impact of dealing 
with it – you do analyse everything and I’m on call 24/7 when the shipments are 
occurring.

“I’ve got the phone by my bed. I’m very aware of what’s happening in the 
world, I’m very tuned into it. You have to be when are dealing with the most 
precious of objects moving through a fairly unregulated world.”

Davy says the first part of minimising the risk is to split the collection – 
in this case into a number of shipments

The works are packed at about 50% humidity and 20 to 21C, with these 
conditions needing to be maintained for what is generally a three-day trip.

To control the environment and hold the paintings in place the works are 
housed in individually moulded load-bearing foam. They are further buffered by 
high-quality foil and air-sealed inside a wooden box.

On arrival in Sydney the Art Gallery of NSW and customs work together to get 
the works straight to the gallery in trucks with customised suspension to avoid 
vibrations.

“Once the paintings are in transit they come straight to the Gallery,” Davy 
says. “It’s a very streamlined scenario to ensure the safe arrival of the 
works, ready for exhibition.

The next phase becomes how to best display the works to the public so the 
experience can be an intimate one for viewers but one that doesn’t put the 
works at risk.

The answer? 

“Glazing,” says Davy. “The quality of glazing on artworks has changed so much 
in the last 15 years – now, most members of the public can’t see that there is 
glass over them.

“That’s really helped in terms of feeling you can really look at the paintings 
and I can rest easy knowing the glaze protects them.’

The security and barrier systems have also been skillfully incorporated into 
the exhibition design to be as effective as possible.

Davy hopes seeing the works of so many artistic greats up close will prompt 
visitors to seek out more on their travels rather than settling for seeing them 
online or in print.

“I looked at the Monet (Poplars on the Epte, 1891) in reproduction for two 
years and then went to San Francisco and saw the exhibition and it just took my 
breath away. I couldn’t believe how much light there was in that painting. When 
we unpacked it here the light was still there – it was just so inherent in the 
paint.”

She says the same magic happened while unpacking Da Vinci’s Studies of a dog’s 
paw (c1480-85): “When I saw the Leonardo drawing, it tripped me into a 
different level of imagination. I love that sense of the physicality. There’s 
that interesting connection that you feel by having the real thing in front of 
you.”

While the rarity of the works is something special – there are less than 40 
Vermeers in the world for instance – Davy says each work in the collection is a 
quality example of the great masters.

An unexpected joy was the intimacy revealed by the composition of the group of 
three women in Sir Joshua Reynolds’s The Ladies Waldegrave (1780-81), she says.

“The painting is so dynamic. When you are in front of it, and can appreciate 
it as an object, it is something else. It’s not only about the intimacy of 
experience, it’s about the quality that you are looking at and it’s pretty hard 
to get away from.”
