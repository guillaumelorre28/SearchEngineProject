The conversation is in process. And the result ultimately is up to Fox.

shanghaisputnik <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14449061> asks:

I saw Streetcar at the Young Vic in July and later how they chose to present 
it live-to-tape when shown in cinemas via NT Live, so I feel now I’ve seen 
three unique iterations of this production. I assumed the decision to go with a 
wide static frame and the long takes to compliment and keep you in the tone of 
the live theatre experience. But can you talk a bit about your directorial 
choices after reading O’Hagan’s script in terms of picking your deliberate 
filmic moments in The Departure? I mean the choreography within that wide 
static frame (i.e. -- staging yourself quite far from camera for the 1st scene, 
only CU is cop lighting your cig, doing all the catcalling balcony stuff o.s, 
etc.)

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/47315627> 
The choreography kind of came before the script. In that I knew what I wanted 
to take place in each of the scenes, as in: she comes in from a funeral, she 
drinks, she changes, there are soldiers that call to her. And I knew from the 
beginning I wanted it to be locked off, and that it would dissolve into an 
almost identical frame in another location and then it would start with a john, 
and a policeman would enter. And so knowing that, on the day, and with a static 
frame, it was a matter of how to make it interesting enough with entrances and 
exits.

But I still don't know whether it stands alone as a piece, and I'm not really 
concerned with that. Someone might ask why isGillian Anderson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gillian-anderson> walking around in her 
underwear? It's specific, and yet could be a study of a lonely drunken woman. 
I'm ok with whatever the interpretation ends up being, because it was a means 
to an end for me, and I feel like I satisfied that for myself and the remit for 
the Young Vic. And what people make of it beyond that is none of my business 
and I have no control over it.

For me it feels like I'm honouring the depth and the history and the backstory 
of the character. And so it feels in a way like a celebration, just in that 
we're interested enough in her to be curious about where she's from. She's 
complicated, and recognisable enough that we care. She's so much more than that 
of course, but I don't feel like it takes away or abuses or is disrespectful.

Either Italian or French, I think. Romance language are so beautiful, and 
sexy. But also my daughter speaks French, and it's a harder language than I'll 
ever be able to learn. The fact that the French continue to go to school to 
speak French is a bit daunting!

Now that you’re directing, how would you describe your directing style?

I wouldn't necessarily say that this is indicative of my style. The Departure 
is a study of a particular period of time. And it's theatrical on purpose, and 
I don't think that I would choose to direct something so theatrically that 
wasn't related to a piece of theatre. It was a conscious decision to do a 
locked-off camera, and while I appreciate that as a device, it has a time and 
place. I would hope that my style of directing would conform to the style of 
the piece I was shooting.

I've been adapting a screenplay for about 15 years and will direct it at some 
point. Ironically it will similarly stylised to this piece! So not a good 
example of how this is not my style... but it asks for that, it calls for that. 
It's more of an arthouse film.

How did you feel seeing Blanche for yourself when you directed The Departed? 
After a summer of being her on stage what was it like looking? Was she as you 
expected her to be from your inside perspective?

The strangest thing was actually to watch the NT Live film of the play. 
Working Title did a screening and I got to invite friends who hadn't seen the 
play, and it wasn't until the ball was already rolling, that I thought oh my 
God what am I doing? Being in the same room as friends watching it for the 
first time? And then once I got past that, it was the sitting in the chair 
watching the film start... I was almost sick. I nearly bolted from the room.

But what was fascinating about that was getting to see what all the other 
actors were doing on stage while I/Blanche was caught up in her own 
self-obsession or behind a shower curtain. There were close ups too, so I got 
to see the emotional journey the other actors took in detail, and that was 
wonderful to see. They were all so good!

Not at the moment, but I'd love to do comedy. I'd love to do a comedy with 
Jason Bateman, or to do a comedy with David O Russell. Madcap and dark, a black 
comedy.

"There seems to be an upswing of negative perception about feminism"

Einsteinstwinparadox <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14461748> asks:

I wanted to tell you that you were my role model as a young girl in the 90s 
and still are now as I approach 30. I know many countless others have also been 
inspired and moved by you over they years; “The Scully Effect” and your 
influence on women is often spoken about, but I was curious what you would hope 
to be the most lasting impression you leave on young women. Popular culture and 
history will likely point to characters like Scully and Stella, but what would 
YOU most like to be remembered for as a feminist figure?

There seems to be an upswing of negative perception about feminism. And on the 
one hand, it's our own fault. And I guess I'd like to be a part of a movement 
towards it not being a dirty word or having negative connotations or being 
taboo. Can we talk about what's not working, without blame, can we focus on 
moving forward?

So I'd like to be a part of that conversation. I know that there was something 
called the Scully Effect in scientific journals - there was an influx of girls 
into sciences during the X Files. And so I guess I was part of a movement 
towards girls embracing their brains, and wanting to explore their potential 
and what they were capable of beyond what they'd previously been told they'd 
been capable of.

I just got an image of doing a timelapse prequel for Miss Havisham. From the 
moment she is left at the altar, to when we find her in our adaptation of the 
story. A timelapse photo of her wandering around the house, the disintegration 
of her, the house, and her mind, might be interesting.

Actually, Tennessee Williams makes me feel this way, and I've only properly 
become obsessed with him since doing the play, and reading Lehr's remarkable 
biography on Williams. I had read interviews with him before, but never any of 
his letters and really not much of his poetry, and I'm stunned at how poetic he 
was in his simple speech, his casual correspondence. Such a beautiful mind.

There’s an inflatable boy who goes to an inflatable school, where everything

One day the boy gets into trouble, for bringing a pin to school. The Principal 
says “You’ve let me down, you’ve let yourself down, you’ve let the whole school 
down.” LOL

Your turn Gillian :)

You’re not like that schoolboy with a pin, you are an INFLATOR! Thank you.

I guess what I discovered was that I pretty much identified with every aspect 
of her. In one way or another. And as much as I might think I am not vain or 
delusional, but I am all those things. And I am also Stella Gibson's things, 
and my individual things, and people are really complicated and multifaceted, 
and we like to put ourselves and others into boxes. We are all much more 
interesting that we give ourselves credit for - and worthy of compassion 
because of it.

I saw Streetcar at the Young Vic in July and later how they chose to present 
it live-to-tape when shown in cinemas via NT Live, so I feel now I’ve seen 
three unique iterations of this production. I assumed the decision to go with a 
wide static frame and the long takes to compliment and keep you in the tone of 
the live theatre experience. But can you talk a bit about your directorial 
choices after reading O’Hagan’s script in terms of picking your deliberate 
filmic moments in The Departure? I mean the choreography within that wide 
static frame (i.e. -- staging yourself quite far from camera for the 1st scene, 
only CU is cop lighting your cig, doing all the catcalling balcony stuff o.s, 
etc.)

The choreography kind of came before the script. In that I knew what I wanted 
to take place in each of the scenes, as in: she comes in from a funeral, she 
drinks, she changes, there are soldiers that call to her. And I knew from the 
beginning I wanted it to be locked off, and that it would dissolve into an 
almost identical frame in another location and then it would start with a john, 
and a policeman would enter. And so knowing that, on the day, and with a static 
frame, it was a matter of how to make it interesting enough with entrances and 
exits.

But I still don't know whether it stands alone as a piece, and I'm not really 
concerned with that. Someone might ask why isGillian Anderson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gillian-anderson> walking around in her 
underwear? It's specific, and yet could be a study of a lonely drunken woman. 
I'm ok with whatever the interpretation ends up being, because it was a means 
to an end for me, and I feel like I satisfied that for myself and the remit for 
the Young Vic. And what people make of it beyond that is none of my business 
and I have no control over it.

For me it feels like I'm honouring the depth and the history and the backstory 
of the character. And so it feels in a way like a celebration, just in that 
we're interested enough in her to be curious about where she's from. She's 
complicated, and recognisable enough that we care. She's so much more than that 
of course, but I don't feel like it takes away or abuses or is disrespectful.

Either Italian or French, I think. Romance language are so beautiful, and 
sexy. But also my daughter speaks French, and it's a harder language than I'll 
ever be able to learn. The fact that the French continue to go to school to 
speak French is a bit daunting!

I wouldn't necessarily say that this is indicative of my style. The Departure 
is a study of a particular period of time. And it's theatrical on purpose, and 
I don't think that I would choose to direct something so theatrically that 
wasn't related to a piece of theatre. It was a conscious decision to do a 
locked-off camera, and while I appreciate that as a device, it has a time and 
place. I would hope that my style of directing would conform to the style of 
the piece I was shooting.

I've been adapting a screenplay for about 15 years and will direct it at some 
point. Ironically it will similarly stylised to this piece! So not a good 
example of how this is not my style... but it asks for that, it calls for that. 
It's more of an arthouse film.

The strangest thing was actually to watch the NT Live film of the play. 
Working Title did a screening and I got to invite friends who hadn't seen the 
play, and it wasn't until the ball was already rolling, that I thought oh my 
God what am I doing? Being in the same room as friends watching it for the 
first time? And then once I got past that, it was the sitting in the chair 
watching the film start... I was almost sick. I nearly bolted from the room.

But what was fascinating about that was getting to see what all the other 
actors were doing on stage while I/Blanche was caught up in her own 
self-obsession or behind a shower curtain. There were close ups too, so I got 
to see the emotional journey the other actors took in detail, and that was 
wonderful to see. They were all so good!

Not at the moment, but I'd love to do comedy. I'd love to do a comedy with 
Jason Bateman, or to do a comedy with David O Russell. Madcap and dark, a black

I wanted to tell you that you were my role model as a young girl in the 90s 
and still are now as I approach 30. I know many countless others have also been 
inspired and moved by you over they years; “The Scully Effect” and your 
influence on women is often spoken about, but I was curious what you would hope 
to be the most lasting impression you leave on young women. Popular culture and 
history will likely point to characters like Scully and Stella, but what would 
YOU most like to be remembered for as a feminist figure?

There seems to be an upswing of negative perception about feminism. And on the 
one hand, it's our own fault. And I guess I'd like to be a part of a movement 
towards it not being a dirty word or having negative connotations or being 
taboo. Can we talk about what's not working, without blame, can we focus on 
moving forward?

So I'd like to be a part of that conversation. I know that there was something 
called the Scully Effect in scientific journals - there was an influx of girls 
into sciences during the X Files. And so I guess I was part of a movement 
towards girls embracing their brains, and wanting to explore their potential 
and what they were capable of beyond what they'd previously been told they'd 
been capable of.

I just got an image of doing a timelapse prequel for Miss Havisham. From the 
moment she is left at the altar, to when we find her in our adaptation of the 
story. A timelapse photo of her wandering around the house, the disintegration 
of her, the house, and her mind, might be interesting.

Actually, Tennessee Williams makes me feel this way, and I've only properly 
become obsessed with him since doing the play, and reading Lehr's remarkable 
biography on Williams. I had read interviews with him before, but never any of 
his letters and really not much of his poetry, and I'm stunned at how poetic he 
was in his simple speech, his casual correspondence. Such a beautiful mind.
