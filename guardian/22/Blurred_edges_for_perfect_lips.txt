There is nothing fashion won’t “ombré”. In the past, the ombré lip 
(popularised by drag queens – a true sign of glamour) worked to make you look 
poutier. The new direction – a blurring of the edges – is grungier, cooler, a 
little bit hungover. Experiment by dabbing concealer around your lip-line, then 
tap on a fresh pop of colour right in the middle.
