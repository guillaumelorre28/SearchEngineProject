Star of the year

Cristiano Ronaldo – won a fourth Ballon d’Or, launched a range of CR7 blankets 
<http://eliteteam.com/collections/shop-cr7>, tossed a microphone into a lake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/22/cristiano-ronaldo-throws-television-reporters-microphone-into-lake>
, inspired atantrum meme <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhYacqkCh4w>, and 
hosted the era’s defining football press conference, with the press banned from 
asking questions. He denied it was his idea to have all the questions posed by 
a Uefa media officer instead: “I decide nothing.” He also appeared to spit out 
a magic fully-formed Euro 2016 TV graphic during Portugal’s quarter-final. 
Flawless.

Manager of the year

Claudio Ranieri, taking the edge off 2016. “Hey, man, dilly-ding, dilly-dong. 
Come on!” Former Ranieri player Gianfranco Zola revealed the phrase was tried 
and tested. “He’s always said dilly-ding, dilly-dong. He’s a colourful guy. 
When I first heard it I knew what he meant. He told me it so many times.”

Modern footballer of the year

Plenty of contenders, but two Villa men share the title: club captain Gabby 
Agbonlahor, relegated on a nitrous oxide legal high two years after extending 
his Villa deal because: “I still get that same buzz pulling on the Villa 
shirt”, and team-mateJoleon Lescott, who livened up last season’s grim run-in 
by tweeting aphotograph of a sports car 
<https://twitter.com/JoleonLescott/status/698916338148995072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
 after a 6-0 defeat and telling the press how going down was a real “weight off 
the shoulders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/16/joleon-lescott-aston-villa-relief-relegation>
”. He left on a free in August.

• Also standing his ground: Turkey midfielder Ozan Tufan – upset with media 
criticism during the Euros after he wascaught on camera doing his hair 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH1kmfQrbCY> as Croatia’s Luka Modric shaped 
up to score in front of him. “I don’t get how a single moment in which I do my 
hair is deemed a mistake. It damages my confidence.”

Best Olympic moment

Capturing the mood: Nikki Hamblin and Abbey D’Agostino helping each other 
finish Rio’s 5,000mafter colliding mid-race 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCVlRFWOjgE>. Hamblin: “When I went down it 
was like: ‘What’s happening? Why am I on the ground?’ And suddenly there’s this 
hand on my shoulder. That girl is the Olympic spirit, right there.”

Story of the summer

Syrian teen Yusra Mardini winning her heat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/yusra-mardini-100m-butterfly-heat-win-refugee-olympic-team-rio-2016>
 in the 100m butterfly for the Refugee Team in Rio, a year after surviving the 
capsize of a six-man dinghy carrying 20 refugees towards Lesbos. “This is 
really cool … there are a lot of stories about me now and a lot of people who 
want to take my picture: it’s helping to spread our message. This does not stop 
here … This is not the end.”

Most off-message

1) US women’s football star Hope Solo, reflecting on their Rio quarter-final 
defeat to Sweden: “We played a courageous game … but we also played a bunch of 
cowards. The best team did not win, I strongly, firmly believe that. They won’t 
make it far.” They made the final.
And 2) The millionaire golfers delivering their pre-Games reasons for not 
going to Rio. Rory McIlroy: “Though the risk of infection from the Zika virus 
is considered low, it is a risk nonetheless.” Dustin Johnson: “My concerns 
about the Zika virus cannot be ignored.” Jason Day: “The sole reason for my 
decision is the potential risk to future members of our family.” And Vijay 
Singh: “I would like to play the Olympics, but the Zika virus, you know … all 
that crap.”

Best change of direction

Came from Sepp Blatter’s replacement at Fifa, Gianni Infantino – calling his 
new pay deal proof of its emerging anti-greed culture. Infantino said his 
modest contract – £1.15m basic plus bonuses, car, house, £1,542-a-month 
expenses and funding for one-off costs such as £1,100 for a tuxedo and £660 on 
flowers – “reflects more than any word can reflect my strong will to end recent 
behaviour”.

Former Fifa man of the year

Most relaxed as the FBI took a grip: former Concacaf head Jeffrey Webb, who 
hosted aHarlem Renaissance-themed blackjack party 
<https://www.caymancompass.com/2016/02/09/webb-parties-amid-fifa-fallout/> in 
February while under house arrest at the Georgia mansion he bought with fraud 
money. Webb, set for sentencing next May, took the Concacaf presidency in 2012 
pledging to draw a line under the organisation’s “shameful” Jack Warner era: “
We must move the clouds, and let the sunshine in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/06/said-and-done-fifa-concacaf-arrests-jeffrey-webb>
.”

Interview of the year


Gary and Paul O’Donovan, live on RTÉ in August 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RndEXwu0NvA> after winning Ireland’s first 
rowing gold – discussing the craic, Nutella, peeing in cups, how to row (“close 
your eyes and pull like a dog”), and how sad they felt to be in Rio because 
they were missing the Rio-themed parties back in Skibbereen. Last month they 
were named RTÉ Sport Team of the Year, starred in a new documentaryPull Like a 
Dog, were interviewed for Graham Norton’s New Year’s Eve BBC1 show, and named 
as Britain’s most Googled Irish-related search term in the whole of 2016. Gary: 
“It’s funny the way it’s worked out.”

Best commentary moments

Iceland’s Euro 2016 coverage, and this from Ireland’s Cathal Dennehy and Ronan 
Duggan, live streaming April’s Irish Universities Athletics Association women’s 
4 x 400m dramatic relay final <https://youtu.be/BVhjAXEyjMI?t=2m15s> as an 
outsider charged “from the depths of hell” to victory. Dennehy admitted later 
he’d achieved a pitch “somewhere between a dog whistle and a squealing pig … We 
all lost our minds.”

Worst commentary moments

1) Canada’s Olympic broadcaster CBC apologising in August after their swimming 
commentator called the whole men’s 200m individual medley mistaking Michael 
Phelps for Ryan Lochte; and2) John Virgo, confident he was off-air during 
BBC1’s live coverage of Mark Selby and Marco Fu’s epic contest at snooker’s 
World Championship in April: “I wanted to watch a bit of racing this afternoon 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqM17G_Ms10>. I’ll be lucky to watch some 
fuckingMatch of the Day.” Spokesman: “He’s embarrassed and apologetic.”

Pundit of the year

The clip that never grows old <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ7rXwLBapg>. 
Sky’sSteve McClaren in June, with his in-play analysis of England’s response to 
Iceland’s equaliser: “It’s been the perfect response from England. You just 
think: ‘No problem, start again, keep dominating, keep getting pressure on the 
Iceland back four’ – the only thing that they have got is the big boy up front 
Sigurdsson, who really … Sigthorsson … Oh, ohhh …”

Most professional attitude

Sam Allardyce – negotiating the £400,000 top-up that ended his 67-day England 
reign. He promisedundercover reporters 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/26/exclusive-how-sam-allardyce-tried-to-make-as-much-money-as-possi/>
 he’d deliver their pretend clients “keynote speaking, that’s what I’d do, I’m 
a keynote speaker” plus “value for money … not just the keynote speech but also 
in the bar after. I don’t come in like a lot of them, bang, you’re off. Do you 
know what I mean? I’m going to stand at the bar. Have a few social drinks.”

Best protest

Charlton and Coventry fans, staging a joint protest in October against both 
clubs’ boards byhurling hundreds of plastic pigs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/charlton-coventry-pigs-owner-protest-valley>
 at the pitch.@CAFCofficial, 3.02pm: “Play is stopped. Pigs on pitch.” 3.03pm: 
“(Not real ones)”.

Social media awards

• Best live tweeting: 
1) Danny Willett’s brother Pete, watching the Masters in April with tweets 
including: “Speechless.I once punched that kid in the head 
<https://twitter.com/p_j_willett/status/719303314018578433> for hurting my pet 
rat. Now look;” and: “I’ve shared a bath with a Masters winner.” His Ryder Cup 
online preview in September – which branded US fans “pudgy, unwashed cretins” 
and a “baying mob of imbeciles” –didn’t go down so well 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/37500790>. 
2) @hastingsufc, staying professional against the odds in October: “Apologies 
for lack of updates / I’ve been stung by a wasp. Even game, no significant 
chances.”
3) And Iceland’s @rvkgrapevine, giving a minute-by-minute appraisal of keeper 
Hannes Halldorsson’s summer performance against Portugal. “Ódinn’s breath 
propelled our heroic goalie to swat away that weak-ass header” and: “GOALIE 
LIKE THE CLIFF FACE AT DYRHOLAEY THE ONLY THING THAT WILL DESTROY HIM IS 
CENTURIES OF COASTAL EROSION.”

• Most sincere tweet: Sunderland’s Victor Anichebe, copying and pasting too 
much of what his PR team sent him after October’s defeat to West Ham –
@VictorAnichebe:“Can you tweet something like: Unbelievable support yesterday 
and great effort by the lads! Hard result to take! But we go again!”

• Most confused: Californian Facebook user Petra Fyde, asking her friends and 
family in June: “At the risk of sounding stupid… Why are a bunch of strange men 
in my fb inbox saying WILL GRIGGS ON FIRE, YOUR DEFENSE IS PETRA FYDE?????? 
What the hell is going on?”

• And the most well-crafted pledge: @Joey7Barton, 24 May: “To be a Ranger 
<https://twitter.com/joey7barton/status/735110574594523136?lang=en> is to sense 
the sacred trust of upholding all that such a name means in this shrine of 
football.”15 Sep: “I apologise unreservedly

Best put-down

Andy Murray in August, asked by John Inverdale: “You’re the first person to 
ever win two Olympic tennis golds, that’s an extraordinary feat, isn’t it?” 
Murray: “I think Venus and Serena have won about four each.”@jk_rowling: 
<https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/765129586489327618> “Murray just 
reminded John Inverdale that women are people too.”

Best analysis

Among the footballers reacting to Brexit in June: 
• @PetrCech: “It looks like the biggest decision in the history of this 
country was made based on a fake campaign and lies.”
• Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini: “The main concern is an eventual domino effect. I 
don’t think the simple UK exit can change the equilibrium of the whole European 
economy, aside from the heartburn everyone’s feeling. I think the discontent 
shouldn’t lead to disintegration.”
• Jermaine Pennant @pennant83: “Now we are not in Europe what’s going to 
happen with the next euros 2018???”
• And Nolito: “What is Brexit? I think it’s a dance. I may be wrong.”

Wisest words

25 Nov: England coach Eddie Jones, hailing wing Elliot Daly in the buildup 
 to their game against Argentina: “He does things you don’t coach.” 
26 Nov: Daly sent off after five minutes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/26/england-argentina-autumn-internationals-match-report>
.

Sharpest PR

Rio 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rio-2016> spokesperson Mario 
Andrada – explaining why organisers couldn’t be expected to just fix the green 
water in the swimming pool overnight: “Chemistry is not an exact science.”

Best customer service

Back in August England’s slow over-rate against Pakistan prompted spectator 
Alexis Fuller to tweet: “I want 10% of my money back. Wouldn’t go to football 
and find it ended after 80mins.”Alex Hales tweeted back: “ok DM me your bank 
details” – then transferred £4.10.

Miss of the year

Italy’s Simone Zaza – tiptoeing his way to stardom 
<https://twitter.com/CecileVous/status/749987392707256320> from the spot 
against Germany at the Euros – the summer’s single biggest non-Ronaldo meme.
Among the remixes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWGUyFpKMJo&feature=youtu.be>
: Zaza as a seagull stamping for worms, Zaza doing Olympic dressage, and Zaza 
in a queue for the toilet. Zaza: “Unfortunately the ball went too high. It will 
be with me for the rest of my life.”

Single worst moment of 2016

Setting the tone for Trump, Brexit, Farage and everything that followed – 
Germany coachJoachim Löw’s distressing televised in-trouser scratch and sniff 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hajqD_ylV0> routine in mid-June. “I’m sorry 
for it. When you are full of adrenaline, things happen that you don’t perceive. 
I will try to behave differently in the future.”

President of the year

Palermo’s 74-year-old owner Maurizio Zamparini went into 2016 looking to put 
his “coach-eater” image to bed. Here’s how it unfolded:

10 Jan: Zamparini denies he’s already feeling twitchy about his new coach 
Davide Ballardini. “I will not sack him, even though I could.” 
11 Jan: Sacks him and hires Guillermo Barros Schelotto. 
11 Feb: Discovers Schelotto doesn’t have his badges and hires Giovanni Bosi 
instead.
15 Feb: Sacks Bosi and rehires Giuseppe Iachini, who he sacked in November. 
8 Mar: Calls Iachini “an idiot who has gone mad” and replaces him with Walter 
Novellino. 
12 Apr: Sacks Novellino, rehires Ballardini. “People say I’ve gone mad, but 
I’m the victim here.”
6 Sep: Hires Roberto de Zerbi after Ballardini resigns two games into the 
season.
28 Nov: Denies that he already has his doubts about De Zerbi. “I will keep 
him. That is my decision.”
30 Nov: Sacks De Zerbi for being “pitiful” and hires Eugenio Corini to see out 
a difficult year. “Why Corini?There wasn’t much on the market 
<http://www.football-italia.net/95093/zamparini-%E2%80%98i-had-no-choice%E2%80%99>
.”

Most English moment

In April West Indies needed an unlikely 19 from the final over to win the 
World T20 and England’sBen Stokes was the man with the ball in his hand to 
close out the result. Four balls and four Carlos Brathwaite sixes later, it was 
over. “I send Ben commiserations,” said Brathwaite. “He’s an absolute legend.”

Most unexpected hero

Marcus “Willbomb” Willis, world No775 when he stunned Wimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/27/wimbledon-2016-marcus-willis-victory-first-round-ricardas-berankis>
 and, almost, Roger Federer – sticking it to trolls who dubbed him Cartman due 
to his big bones. His Wimbledon run ended with a cheque for £30,000. “It’s the 
biggest payday I’ve ever had. I can pay off a couple of credit cards now.”

Chant of the year

“Huh <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZbMV6JvL6E>!” by Iceland. Also worth a 
mention: tactics-mindedCarlisle fans with a Peter Andre-themed message to 
manager Keith Curle: “Woah-oh-oh-oh, Mysterious Curle, I wanna play 3-5-2.”

Best falling down

2016’s best football tumbles: Brazilian players Marcelo Cordeiro and Rossi 
pretending to have been headbutted by each other 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmzUnlSC9pg> in October (Cordeiro: “That’s 
just life. That’s the game we’re in”); Toulouse coachPascal Dupraz feeling 
upset in November by criticism of his reaction to apaper plane brushing his head
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aNqrdPp388>: “All these critics, they’re so 
brave”; andLouis van Gaal’s Miranda Hart pratfall 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBmVLpzFhtY> in February, as he made a serious 
point.

spotted in Marbella in Mayspinning on the spot

Alan Pardew, marking Palace’s FA Cup final goal by throwing dad shapes

of them were sacked within months.

Michail Antonio’s horizontal-running grass-dance 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mlJwV9KrWQ> in February after scoring for 
West Ham. “I saw The Simpsons Movie the other day. I think I pulled it off.”

France in July, only to be flattened when a fan’s beltpunctured an inflatable 
Vittel advertising arch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/08/adam-yates-britain-tour-de-france-inflatable-marker>

Skiing star Lindsey Vonn, ambassador for Head skis and bindings, reacted to a 
ski detaching mid-race in February byposting a video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w75llwIy-4g> of herself destroying her Head 
bindings with a hammer. After talks with her agent she clarified: “This was in 
no way, shape or form a reflection on the performance of the Head skis and 
bindings. I believe in Head.”

Most distracted 

French fencer Enzo Lefort – going into the Rio Games declaring: “I’ve given 
everything to get here. It’s important not to be distracted” – then being booed 
by the crowd after hisphone fell out of his pocket 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2Z34hk1uco> mid-bout.

Best comeback

Andy Townsend, back on ITV for the summer: “That’s as blatant a penalty as 
you’ll ever see. Was it definitely in the box? I don’t know.”

Worst luck

Australian rugby league star Jarryd Hayne, cutting short his presentation to 
200 school pupils on the dangers of the internet when his screen started 
flashing up porn. Organisers said the images “did not come from Jarryd’s 
device”; Hayne: “It was awkward. Wow.”

Biggest last laugh

Heather Watson – picking up the second largest fine in Wimbledon history, 
£9,040, for racket smashing – £1,500 more than Viktor Troicki’s fine for 
ranting against “the worst ever umpire in the world”. She came out ahead, 
though: winning £50,000 for her mixed doubles victory.

Lowest blow

Spare a thought for Serb rowers Milos Vasic and Nenad Bedik, who arrived in 
Rio feeling good after four years of dawn training – and sank after 1,250m.

Biggest attention seekers
