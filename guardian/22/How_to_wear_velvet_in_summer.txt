“Florals for spring? Groundbreaking.” 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8h2qnRBzR0> So said Miranda Priestly in The 
Devil Wears Prada and a thousand gifs. The same might be said for velvet for 
winter – just one stroke of the soft, piled fabric and you’re at a fireside, 
glass of red wine in hand. Or that’s where I am, in my velvet daydream.

But perhaps due to the seasonless nature of fashion now, or just because some 
people are really, really impatient – and impervious to overheating – I might 
have to get used to velvet and Pimm’s. The fabric has been getting quite a lot 
of play this summer, even though it is a bigtrend for autumn

 – seen at brands ranging from Vetements to Stella McCartney.

It also has a very proper old-school-gala feel to it – Lady Gaga wore it to 
Tony Bennett’s 90th birthday bash last week. It’s also romantic – Alicia 
Vikander wore a loose velvet dress while out with Michael Fassbender, andTaylor 
Swift 
<http://www.etonline.com/fashion/194487_taylor_swift_sports_a_sexy_velvet_lbd_for_date_night_with_tom_hiddleston/>
 held hands with Tom Hiddlestone while wearing black velvet co-ords with, you 
guessed it, a strip of midriff. Velvet in summer by Swift – it worked. We don’t 
make the rules, Swift and her squad do. Velvet in summer is now a thing. It 
might even be groundbreaking.
