The first full show from the New York brand brings us womenswear, a skate ramp 
and all kinds of awesomeness. Here are five things we learned from Coach’s 
menswear spring/summer 2016 show.

The sliders
 Furry and camo: sliders at Coach Imogen Fox Photograph: Imogen Fox 
Coach designer Stuart Vevers is a key player in the world of sliders. Last 
summer’s deliciously orthopaedic versions were eclipsed this season by chunky 
sliders covered in loud acid-tinged print with a shearling strap. These may be 
an early contender for the shoe of Spring summer 2016, people. A really, really 
nice bit of fluff.

Mixed in with the men were a few well-chosen female models, including Binx 
Walton. The show was more about girls wearing boys’ clothes rather than 
womenswear sprinkled in with men’s. Backstage, Vevers said he was inspired by 
girls he knew, wearing men’s clothes and it “looking really cool.” It’s all 
about effortlessness, in other words – something we can all get behind.

 Zebra print-lined hoods at Coach Im Photograph: Imogen Fox 
Animal prints, lawn chair patterns, bright line green and pink appeared on the 
catwalk, sometimes in the same outfit and layered up in a way that worked for 
our post-seasonal world. A highlight was the back view of parkas, which were 
lined with a faux zebra fur fabric. Vevers said he wanted to do “pieces, you 
know, but I’m trying to do something different with them so they could only 
come from Coach.” Mission accomplished.

 Kennedy-meets-counterculture on the Coach catwalk Photograph: Imogen Fox 
Vevers also said he wanted to mix up the “old money Kennedy thing, with 
counterculture” which has to be one of the best fashion combinations in recent 
years. He also said the Coach man needs to “have some slouch”, which we like. 
To get the look, you’ll need a boxy shirt with a Stan Rizzo-approved look, 
teamed with an oversized mac and skate shorts.

 The Skateramp set at Coach Photograph: Imogen Fox 
The 1990s appeared in the set too, which was made up of a series of wooden 
veneer skate ramps. They were decorated with the requisite stickers that anyone 
who (mis)spent their youth doing ollys - or watching others do ollys - would 
understand. Add a frow that includedLondon Collections Men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-collections-men> regulars like 
Tinae Tempah and Lewis Hamilton, along with models Dree Hemingway and Sam 
Rollinson, and the view on and off the catwalk was good stuff.
