that the best we can. The fans are really passionate … they expect accuracy and 
historical detail.”

present day, would avoid superpowers and magical elements. “A lot of the stuff 
in the game is parkour,” he explained. “Blades attached to his wrists. It’s 
about getting in close to the target, close quarters fighting.”

Fassbender reunites for Assassin’s Creed with Justin Kurzel, director of this 
year’s acclaimed adaptation Macbeth

and Brendan Gleeson.
