Winning tip: Çıralı, Antalya

Nestled in a valley, overlooked by the ruins of Olympos (Tahtalı Dağı), lies 
one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. Çıralı is so special due 
to its two-mile sweeping beach which remains undeveloped thanks to the 
loggerhead turtles that nest on the sands each year. At one end of the beach 
lies the town of Ancient Olympos, while at the other is the natural phenomenon 
of the constantly burning Chimaera flames. The tiny hamlet is full of charm, 
with each impressive garden full of pomegranate and citrus trees. Stay in one 
of the simple pensions: favourites are Hotel Villa Monte and Anatolia Resort.

Only accessible by boat, Kelebek Vadisi (Butterfly Valley), close to Fethiye, 
feels like a south-east Asian paradise beach. It has remained undeveloped, with 
just a few wooden buildings and a campsite dotting the lush valley. The 
stunning walk to a waterfall and the gorgeous beach make a popular day trip 
from Fethiye for TL10 (£2.50) return, but if you want to escape the crowds and 
totally switch off, this is your place. Camping and basic huts with restaurant 
and bar available on the beach.

You won’t find many sunbathers on Gokova beach, but it’s a great place to 
picnic and watch the kitesurfers making the most of the windy conditions. 
Around the cove is sandy Akyaka beach, which has sun beds and parasols and is 
surrounded by restaurants, as well as the Azmak river, which is great for a 
boat tour. Along the coast is pebbly Cinar beach, where you can hire a lounger 
and cool off in the calm sea. There’s a snack bar for lunch and beers. A boat 
trip to Cleopatra Island is a must, if only to jump off into the serene and 
secluded coves.

Surrounded by a pine forest, opposite St Nicholas island, Gemiler beach is 
quieter than the touristy beaches of Ölüdeniz. Take a minibus from Fethiye to 
Kayakoy that is marked Gemiler and bring a picnic and a mat to sit on (although 
you can rent loungers and umbrellas). As the sun sets, take a boat across to 
the island, climb to the top of the hill past the ruins of ancient churches, 
and witness a stunning sunset, dotted with paragliders.

Founded by a son of Apollo (really!), Patara is a laid-back village full of 
restaurants and hotels between Fethiye and Kas. The 18km beach is just 
stunning; it feels like you have the whole place to yourself. The sea is warm, 
shallow, and swimmable. If you visit at the right time of year, you’ll see 
newly-hatched turtles scrambling down to the sea. There are extensive, 
well-preserved ruins of the Greek and Roman settlements that once thrived here. 
Patara is one of the few remaining relaxed, tourist-free, unspoilt places in 
Mediterranean Turkey.

Kabak valley, near Fethiye

 Photograph: connect10/GuardianWitness 
If you can face the taxi ride along the jaw-dropping heights of the mountains 
along the coast, the picturesque Kabak village is well worth a visit. There are 
several small scale places to stay in this secluded cove, all offering 
eco-friendly accommodation and prices include homemade breakfast and dinner. My 
favourite place to stay is Shambala, which is perched above the sea with 
magnificent views and only a five-minute walk to the beach. If you are more of 
an active soul, you can always do the day hike to the waterfall, or 
alternatively do some hiking along the famous Lycian Way.

Iztuzu beach near Dalyan is an idyllic stretch of over two miles of sandy 
beach. From Dalyan town, take thedolmus from the Minibus Co-operative. The bus 
trip has stunning views of Sulungar lake and the Dalyan delta. A slightly 
longer journey - but well worth a trip - is on the public boat goes from the 
riverside in Dalyan. It chugs past the rock tombs and the ancient site of 
Caunos, through the reed beds of river delta. Well worth £2.50 for the return 
trip. I like to take the boat mid-morning, walk the length of the beach and 
stop at the green wooden café for tea and toast before returning to Dalyan on 
the bus.

The drive to Eğirdir is stunning in itself, as you round the bend to see a 
majestic view of the lake. But the tiny peninsula that reaches out into the 
centre houses some beautiful pensions lining tiny pebble bays with some of the 
clearest water I’ve ever seen. Not a “beach” per se, but if you want something 
different, to relax on a lounger with a chai and enjoy the mountainous 
backdrop, Lake Eğirdir is truly stunning.

Trendy young Turks and windsurfers make the vibe around Alacati’s beach on the 
Çeşme peninsula super-chic. The sea breezes keep the temperatures pleasant even 
in mid-summer and the pristine white sands of are perfect for chilling on. Sip 
exotic cocktails when the sun sets at Nars Cafe, or explore the cobbled streets 
and flower-adorned stone houses of the pretty village. Friendly owner Celal 
welcomes guests to the cool courtyard of his Bey Evi Hotel with plates of pitta 
bread and local cheese, washed down with homemade limoncello. Shades almost 
obligatory.

Secluded from Bodrum’s party reputation, Yalikavak, an unassuming fishing 
town, is a refuge of relaxation, casual meandering and slow-paced socialising. 
There’s a blend of high-end restaurants and clubs with small-scale local fish 
restaurants. I would recommend Sofi’s Restaurant for a water-edge traditional 
meal (choose your fish from a freshly caught selection). The hilly landscape of 
the town exemplifies the beautiful sunsets and morning views with Turkish 
coffee.
