We’d all rather ride in warm and dry weather but sometimes that isn’t an 
option. Don’t let bad weather put you off, though – with the right kit, 
attitude and skills and you can stay safe and still enjoy your ride.

There’s no such thing as bad weather …

‘There’s no such thing as bad weather just the wrong kit’ may be a well-worn 
cliche – but with a good waterproof jacket, neoprene overshoes and gloves your 
wet-weather ride will be a lot less uncomfortable.

Breathability is key, otherwise your sweat will just mean you get wet from the 
inside rather than the outside. If it rains hard for a long time you are going 
to get wet anyway, but having the right kit will at least stop you from getting 
too cold.

To be waterproof, jackets need to have taped seams. While a fully taped, fully 
waterproof jacket is a good option in really bad weather, a lightweight jacket 
which stuffs in a back pocket will stop you getting caught short in a shower – 
and you can easily stow it away if the sun comes out.

What lurks beneath?

Don’t ride through puddles or standing water. You won’t be able to see how 
deep the water is until it’s too late – it might just be a shallow puddle, or 
it could be a wheel-breaking pothole. Steer clear.

Slippery when wet

Avoid manhole covers, painted lines and the tell-tale rainbow of oily residue 
on the road. If you can’t avoid them, try to steer straight and don’t turn or 
brake until you’re through.

On guard

Mudguards will not only help protect you from the elements – stopping water 
spraying over your feet and up your back – a rear guard will also protect the 
person riding behind you. Some club rides insist participants fit guards in wet 
weather. If you’re unsure, ask the mechanic in your local cycle shop which 
mudguards will fit your bike.

Think thicker, flatter tyres

Tyres are your only point of contact with the road. Wider tyres should offer 
more grip, so if you ride a road bike, for example, consider swapping your 23c 
tyres for wider 25c or 28c rubber. Think of reducing your tyre pressure too: 
anything from 10 to 20psi lower than usual should offer greater contact with 
the road and so traction – although you might also be more at risk of a 
puncture, and fixing a flat in the pouring rain is no fun at all.

Easy does it

Conventional rim bike brakes are much less effective in the wet (although disc 
brakes are not as badly affected) so you need to give yourself much more time 
to slow down or stop. Test your brakes at the start of the ride. Obviously, 
take extra care on tight corners which you might zip around on a warm, dry day. 
And be aware that it’s not just water that reduces grip – grit washed into the 
road, especially quiet country lanes, can catch you out too.

Light up

Rain, overcast skies and steamy windows all reduce motorists’ vision, so it’s 
a good idea to ride with lights in wet weather. A flashing rear light on your 
seatpost is inexpensive and effective. Think reflective and bright clothing too 
– you can never be too visible.

Post-ride

Clean the grit off your chain after a wet ride and reapply oil to help your 
chain last longer. After that it’s time for a hot shower, a change into dry 
clothes and a your treat of choice – you deserve it …
