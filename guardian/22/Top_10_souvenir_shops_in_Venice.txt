Oi Va Voi Studio


On a narrow canal in a colourful corner of the Castello quarter, alongside one 
of the last boats in Venice selling fruit and vegetables, charismatic Ukranian 
artist and photographer Roman Tcherpak presides over an eccentric 
workshop/gallery where visitors can buy his intriguing handmade postcards and 
prints or sign up for a hands-on one-hour course to learn “Monotypo Venexiano”, 
his unique method of printing which he claims anyone can then practise back at 
home. The ancient red-brick studio is often filled with a lively crowd of 
bohemian would-be artists, with the flamboyant Roman holding court, explaining 
what he calls the technique of “printing digital by hand”.

The riotously colourful designs in the Banco Lotto 10 boutique are all 
designed and hand-sewn by the female inmates of Venice’s prison on the island 
of Giudecca as part of a successful retraining programme. Silks, velvet and 
tapestries are donated by the likes of Fortuny and Bevilacqua, and made into 
elegant dresses, jackets and handbags. Right opposite isBragora 
<http://www.bragora.it/>, a funky design store that stocks products from the 
Malefatte brand, also produced in the prison, plus recycled Freitag-inspired 
bags and T-shirts emblazoned with a distinctive Spritz logo.

If you only visit one shop in Venice, make it Luigi Frizzo’s magical bookshop. 
Hidden away in what has been dubbed “Corte Senza Nome” –no name square – Acqua 
Alta is like no other bookshop in the world. The first sight that greets 
visitors is a 10-metre-long gondola filled to the brim with books, surrounded 
by a labyrinth of rooms teeming with thousands of new and used tomes. Be sure 
to explore right to the canal at the back, where you can walk up a surreal 
staircase of battered books. There are copies of just about every book ever 
written on Venice, sections devoted to art and photography, and a popular 
erotic corner. There are always crowds of curious visitors welcomed by Signor 
Frizzo, an exuberant character followed around by his many cats.

Shopping for kids is never easy in Venice, so a stop-off at this colourful 
atelier can make a welcome break from dragging youngsters round the sights. 
Florence Faval runs a publishing company producing playful handmade books for 
children that pull out like an accordion. The Dromadaire is her art studio, a 
boutique and a space where she runs workshops to teach kids how to make their 
own books using collage, woodblock printing and painting. She also sells 
posters, cards, dolls and children’s maps. Right opposite isFabricharte 
<https://fabricharte.org/>, another artisan gem where young bookbinder Andrea 
Andreatta restores antique books and makes beautiful personalised notebooks and 
diaries.

Italy is famous for its shoe designers, but be prepared for the unexpected 
when visiting the atelier/boutique of master shoemaker Giovanna Zanella. 
Inspired by Venice’s rich traditions and decadent carnivals, Giovanna 
handcrafts made-to-measure shoes that succeed in combining originality with 
comfort. Using a weird and wonderful palette of exotic leather, velvets and 
plastic, she creates vivid, surreal boots, moccasins, sandals and slippers.

 Gilberto Penzo, Venice 
Gilberto Penzo comes from a family of boat builders in the lagoon port of 
Chioggia, but 35 years ago he transformed his skills to the intricate craft of 
model-making, opening a workshop and showroom not far from the Rialto bridge. 
Here replicas of not just gondolas but the elegantsandolo, the traditional, 
flat-bottomed Venetian rowing boat, and the iconic vaporetto, or waterbus, that 
chugs along the Grand Canal, are on display. The store also stocks Gilberto’s 
books on Venetian boats, colourful posters, stirring seafaring ex-votos that he 
paints himself, and a whole host of do-it-yourself kits to make wooden gondolas 
at home – a far better souvenir than the fake Murano glass models on sale 
everywhere.

 Paropamiso, Venice 
The Frezzeria, running right into Piazza San Marco, is Venice’s busiest 
shopping street, lined with glitzy boutiques and souvenir stores. Many visitors 
walk straight past Paropamiso, an Aladdin’s cave filled with thousands of 
ancient “Venetian pearls”. These are actually exquisite pieces of Murano glass 
that have been used in trading around the world since the time of Marco Polo. 
The owner, Michel Paciello, travels the globe from China and Pakistan to Mali 
and Nigeria buying up these rare “pearls”. On his voyages, he also picks up 
surprising antiques and objets, so his minuscule store is like an exotic 
oriental bazaar. Michel also practises the Venetian craft ofimpirar (bead 
threading), transforming vintage or modern beads into necklaces. Although 
collectors can pay huge sums for certain pearls, the store caters for all 
budgets.

 Alessandra, Venice 
All of a sudden, enticing vintage fashion boutiques are popping up all over 
Venice, offering everything from Gucci scarves, Prada handbags and Ferragamo 
stilettos to retro Murano glass, antique lace from Burano and period jewellery. 
Alessandra de Rossi and her partner Giuseppe Panella have opened the latest 
store, right opposite one of Venice’s most popular osterie,Antica Adelaide 
<https://www.facebook.com/Osteria-Antica-Adelaide-318363594859553/> - shoppers 
invariably pop in afterwards for a spritz or glass of wine. Alessandra explains 
that they chose an English-language name to make it easier for visitors, as 
they wouldn’t survive on local custom alone. Their store also has a recycled 
section for kids as well as books, vinyls and lamps.

John Ruskin famously described Venice as the City of Stones, and there is 
still a huge lack of green spaces here today. An exception is the verdant Viale 
Garibaldi, which connects the shops and bars of Via Garibaldi to the entrance 
to the more official Giardini, currently hosting the national pavilions of the
Biennale of Architecture <http://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/>, but for 
which there is an hefty entrance fee. One of the grand Liberty villas at the 
end of the Viale hosts something rather different: the association of Venetian 
ceramic potters – the Bochaleri. From 10am-8pm every Thursday to Sunday, 
members set up stands in the villa’s gardens and salons exhibiting their 
jewellery, hand-painted porcelain pots, wine jugs, jars and vases. There are 
also regular workshops and demonstrations. Right opposite, don’t miss La Serra, 
an ornate 19th-century greenhouse converted into a casual restaurant and wine 
bar.

Piero Dri calls himself Il Forcolaio Matto, the mad oar-maker, and that is 
probably what his parents thought when he abandoned studying astronomy at 
university to devote himself to the ancient Venetian craft of sculpting, 
carving and whittling blocks of wood into the swirling form of theforcola, the 
crucial rowlock, the fulcrum for a gondolier’s oar. Fortunately, the city is 
enjoying a rowing renaissance, so Piero has a steady supply of orders from 
Venetians keen to rediscover the traditional gondolier-style of rowing. His 
tiny carpentry workshop is hidden away in a backstreet behind the sumptuous Ca 
d’Oro palace, and there are plenty of forcola-inspired souvenirs on sale for 
travellers to take home: a sculpture of a forcola mounted on a pedestal, his 
own designer forcola lamp, earrings and necklaces, key rings and wooden 
utensils for the kitchen.
