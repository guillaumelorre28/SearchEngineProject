Take me there: Greenwich peninsula

Why go?

Fifteen years ago the idea that this stretch of riverside wasteland could ever 
become a new cultural hub for London would have seemed, at best, wildly 
optimistic. But since then, the blighted Millennium Dome has been reborn as the 
02, one of the world’s most popular concert venues, and an ambitious 
regeneration project has seen new housing, hotels, restaurants and public 
gardens springing up in this once-neglected corner of the capital.

What to do

The Emirates Air Line cable car whisks passengers from the Royal Docks high 
above the Thames and into the heart of the peninsula (emiratesairline.co.uk 
<http://www.emiratesairline.co.uk/>). Dizzying views can also be had from Up at 
The O2, a guided walk across the canopy of the venue’s iconic dome (theo2.co.uk 
<http://www.theo2.co.uk/>). Next month sees the opening of the Peninsula Garden 
– a new green space with its own kitchen garden, orchard, beehives and 
smokehouse, and an amphitheatre hosting music, cinema and outdoor theatre. A 
fête will be held on 10 May to mark the garden’s opening (urbanvillagefete.co.uk
 <http://urbanvillagefete.co.uk/>). Take in a contemporary art exhibition at 
Now Gallery (nowgallery.co.uk <http://nowgallery.co.uk/>) or some “immersive 
theatre” at the Jetty, a temporary performance space on a disused Thames coal 
jetty (thejettygreenwich.co.uk <http://thejettygreenwich.co.uk/>).

Where to eat

Craft London is a collaboration between chef Stevie Parle and designer Tom 
Dixon (craft-london.co.uk <http://craft-london.co.uk/>). The café has opened 
and the restaurant, cocktail bar and food shop launch later this month, with 
meat cured on-site and home-made bread.

Where to stay

The Pilot Inn is a little slice of “old Greenwich” – a Georgian pub with 
colourful, quirky bedrooms and a seasonal menu (doubles from £120,
pilotgreenwich.co.uk <http://pilotgreenwich.co.uk/>).

Insider tip

Liam Nelson of Craft London recommends arriving by river bus (
thamesclippers.com <http://www.thamesclippers.com/>). “You get a great view of 
the Antony Gormley Quantum Cloud sculpture rising from the river. The sense of 
light and space here is unlike anywhere else in the city.”
