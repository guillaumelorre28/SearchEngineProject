The doorbell, like the landline, is increasingly on its way out. Being in a 
specific place at a certain time is just not how digital nomads roll. In the 
past few years, US companies such asSkyBell <http://www.skybell.com> and 
DoorBird <http://www.doorbird.com> have offered solutions to the problem of 
having to be home occasionally by developing doorbells that connect to your 
smartphone, so you can converse with the deliveryman, passing pal or burglar, 
whether in or out. The UK’s newly launchedDing 
<https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dingproducts/ding-a-beautifully-simple-smart-doorbell>
, though, is one of the first to do it with a design finish that doesn’t scream 
“home security paranoiac with own laser trip wires”.

 Ding doorbell. 
Avril O’Neil and John Nussey, the husband-and-wife team behind this 
comfortingly doughy brass button connected to a soothingly rounded cloth 
speaker, have raised double their original funding round onKickstarter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/kickstarter>, with two weeks still to 
go.

After a century of frankly glacial progress, it seems the way we answer the 
door is finally changing. Here are some other recent innovations.

 Chui doorbell. 
Chui is a facial-recognition system that works with smart locks to 
automatically grant entry to those with the right face. While thepromotional 
material <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANME4UCc9gI> is swish, it’s not quite 
out of its testing phase yet. Given that even those ePassport gates still rely 
on a man in a booth manually checking the camera image, that wait may be some 
time.

 Pebble doggie doorbell. 
The Internet Of Dogs has been a long time coming, but with Pebble Smart, 
canines can finally join us in our maddening new wired world. It’s a pad dogs 
press with their nose in order to activate a series of chimes that can be heard 
in the house. A doorbell, basically. It’s a doorbell for dogs.

Ornamental doorbell: Bottoms Up 
<https://www.allmodern.com/Droog-Bottoms-Up-Doorbell-by-Peter-van-der-Jagt-for-Droog-3100-DRO1063.html>

Designer Peter van der Jagt recognised the deep shame most of us feel around 
having a little box with a magnetic coil to tell us when people are at the 
door, and decided to do something about it. His Bottoms Up is a pair of wine 
glasses with a small mechanical hammer between them, which can be placed on a 
coffee table as an objet d’art. When someone buzzes, it responds with a cool, 
crisp, crystal “ding”.
