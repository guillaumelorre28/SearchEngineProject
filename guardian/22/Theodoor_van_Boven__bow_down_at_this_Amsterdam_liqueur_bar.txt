Dam Square can be incredibly busy but this place, just around the corner, is 
on a quiet little alley called Pijlsteegv. It’s been around since 1679 but it’s 
not a museum. They make liqueur there, so there’s a lot of craftmanship 
involved. The distillery is open in the day and the cafe opens in the evening, 
and you can sit inside or out. It’s a cosy old-fashioned place I wouldn’t go 
there in a group, only on my own or with a friend. Whenever I have visitors I 
take them, and whenever I ride past on my bike I see people from the 
neighbourhood.

It specialises in traditional Dutch liqueurs and jenevers, or Dutch gin, and 
you have to drink them without using your hands. They make you bow down and sip 
them from the bar – that’s their thing. There’s such a variety of flavours, 
you’d get very drunk if you tried them all, so you have to be careful!
