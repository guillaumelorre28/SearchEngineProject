LG unveiled its own competitor to Amazon Echo and Google 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Home on Wednesday – a home 
assistant that can play music and tell you the weather but also order your 
vacuum cleaner to start cleaning the house and turn on your oven.

The Hub Robot <http://ces2017.lgnewsroom.com/photo/lg-robot/>, which LG said 
will go on sale in 2017, was shown for the first time in Las Vegas ahead of the 
Consumer Electronics Show, which opens to the public on Thursday.

The device – a little white machine that has two glowing blue “eyes” on the 
front – appears to be a direct competitor toAmazon Echo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/amazon-echo-dot-review> and 
Google Home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/google-home-launch-amazon-echo-voice-recognition-uk-living-rooms>
.

Introducing the Hub Robot, David VanderWaal, vice-president of marketing, home 
appliances & consumer atLG <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/lg>, 
described it as “your intelligent home assistant”.

It can also play music, tell you the about the weather and traffic – all 
things thatAmazon <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon> Echo and 
Google Home can do.

The difference, the company argues, is the extra things Hub Robot will be able 
to do.

“It can pre-heat your oven,” VanderWaal said, and “initiate your robot vacuum 
cleaner when you leave the house”. It will also be able to turn on your washing 
machine and interact with your refrigerator.

One problem LG might have with the Hub Robot is that for it to do those things 
you would also need to own an oven, robot vacuum cleaner, washing machine and 
refrigerator that are all connected to Wi-Fi. LG sells all of these things, but 
it seems that to get the most out of the Hub Robot you will also need to spend 
thousands of dollars upgrading your home appliances.

If you are unable or unwilling to do that, it doesn’t seem the Hub Robot will 
do much more than its rivals – apart from have a little face.

Still, Taryn Brucia, LG’s director of public relations, told the Guardian that 
the Hub Robot “will compete” with Echo and Google Home.

“But we are working with our partners to see how we might synchronize to work 
with each other.”

Brucia would not give a release date but said the Hub Robot will be released 
in some countries this year.

“Fun. Life’s good,” she said, neatly referencing LG’s slogan 
<http://www.lg.com/global/about-lg/brand-identity>. “We like to be playful.”

Artificial intelligence is one of the main themes of CES this year. On Tuesday 
Faraday Future, a fledgling electric car company,unveiled a car 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/04/faraday-future-takes-on-tesla-with-ff-91-the-electric-car-that-can-learn>
 that will learn its driver’s preferences, while Honda will be presenting cars 
that can “artificially generate their own emotions”.

One thing that has not been discussed at the conference so far – at least not 
publicly – is the vulnerability of these artificially intelligent devices to 
hacking. At the Infosecurity Europe conference in May,industry experts and 
academics warned 
<http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2460752/internet-of-things-shoddy-security-and-iot-hackers-are-putting-human-lives-at-risk>
 that the security of the internet of things – physical devices that connect to 
and operate through the internet – was being ignored because of the relative 
unimportance of those devices to date.

“We have a whole industry that is being ignored by the virtue of unimportance, 
but all of a sudden may find itself extremely [open] to attacks,”the Inquirer 
reported 
<http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2460752/internet-of-things-shoddy-security-and-iot-hackers-are-putting-human-lives-at-risk>
 James Lyne, global head of security research at Sophos, as saying.

The message was that as the internet of things expands to include vehicles and 
important personal data – bank account details, or behavioural habits, for 
example– there is a need for these artificially intelligent devices to become 
more secure.

Another problem is the issue of privacy. In December, police in Arizona seized 
an Amazon Echo device, believing itmay have recorded information that could 
help solve an murder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/28/amazon-refuses-to-let-police-access-suspects-echo-recordings>
.

Law enforcement also issued a warrant to Amazon to hand over data that may 
have been captured by the device. The Seattle-based tech company, however, is 
refusing to provide the police with the information they requested.
