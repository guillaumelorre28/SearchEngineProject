There are certain attributes the ambassadors for London Collections: Men must 
possess. First, they need a fanbase. Second, they need style. Third and fourth 
are above average cheekbones and an extensive sock wardrobe (the front row 
photograph – with a line of brightly coloured socks just showing under tailored 
trousers – is of utmost importance). This season’s newest ambassador, Lewis 
Hamilton – a vision in Puma sportswear and Graff diamond earrings – certainly 
fits the bill. He joinsDavid Gandy

<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/04/hu-bing-british-menswears-newest-ambassador>
 on the roster promoting the four-day event, which starts today. Here he talks 
about finding confidence through fashion.

When did your interest in fashion begin?
Growing up, we never had any money and what money we did have went to racing 
so, for a long time, we lived with very little. In my teens, we got sponsorship 
from Hugo Boss, No and Fear, so for the first time ever we could afford to buy 
nice clothes. The first time I got a custom-made suit was when I made it to F1 
– I went to Burberry. There’s nothing like putting on a clean, pressed suit, a 
crisp shirt and a nice watch to make it pop.

How would you define London style?
I grew up in Stevenage so, ever since I was a kid, we’d come down into London. 
Travelling through different areas you realise that in each pocket people have 
their own distinctive style and it’s this mix that probably defines it. I 
definitely think that in London people aren’t scared to express themselves.

You’ve been looking particularly dapper recently – what was the thinking 
behind your new look?
My lifestyle has changed a lot over the last decade and I guess my style has 
in part been influenced by those changes. You might describe it as streamlined 
style – I know what I like and I feel more confident about wearing it. I’ve 
spent a lot of my professional life trying to fit in and prove that I can do my 
job. This feeling of uncertainty has slowly faded as I’ve been able to prove 
myself. Reaching this point is really a great feeling – it’s as if the fortress 
can come down and I can just enjoy being myself. It’s this feeling that has 
probably influenced my style.

You look great in a baseball cap. Do you go for a straight or curved peak?
It’s my understanding that baseball caps were originally all flat – it’s just 
that they hadn’t yet been broken in. Maybe it’s residual from my 20s, but I 
still prefer it flat – admittedly that has a more youthful look to it.

Who is your style icon?
I don’t know if I have a style icon, but my friend [Balmain creative director] 
Olivier Rousteing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/20/kardashian-couture-balmain-buzz-olivier-rousteing-fashion-social-media-star>
 is a pretty sharp dresser, yet he always looks comfortable, too.

Why was it important for you to work with LCM?
I’ve had the fortune to travel all over the world, but there’s really no city 
as good at supporting and promoting its emerging talent as London. I’ve always 
had an interest in fashion and am friends with a lot of people who work in the 
industry, so I have known about London Collections: Men for some time. It’s 
exciting to see the way [menswear] has exploded. It’s going to be amazing to be 
able to have access to the inner workings of the industry.

Which designers are you most looking forward to seeing?
There are the big names like Burberry, McQueen, Coach and Topman, and it’s 
great that, alongside the famous brands, there will be shows by Craig Green, JW 
Anderson and countless other designers you may not have heard of if you don’t 
follow fashion, but whose work is changing the face of menswear.

Crucial question: as a racing driver, what’s your strategy for dealing with 
helmet hair?
Cut it short or just roll with it. After driving, I have to say I don’t really 
think about my hair too much.
