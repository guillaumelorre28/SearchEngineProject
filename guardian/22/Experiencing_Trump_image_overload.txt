The news section of the Guardian on 14 January contained four pictures of the 
US president-elect (pages 6, 26, 28 and 41), not to mention the political 
cartoon rendering on page 29. It seems to me this is helping to create an icon. 
As I admire and appreciate the excellence of the Guardian, I wonder how you 
determine when enough is enough, or in this case, too much.

• Surely if NHS hospitals didn’t have to pay business rates (Rates pain for 
hospitals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/11/nhs-hospitals-in-england-face-322m-tax-bill-increase-from-april>
, 12 January) the problem of NHS funding would almost be solved. Or perhaps 
they should declare themselves a charity, as private hospitals do, and ask for 
an 80% rebate. I suggest the Guardian starts a petition to stop this anomaly.

• I have a question for your anonymous correspondent (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/15/gps-working-longer-hours-wont-ease-the-pressure-on-the-nhs>
, 16 January). If the job of a GP is the cushy number, why do so few medical 
graduates want to make a career in that branch of the NHS?

• I remember from my childhood 65 years ago that my mother had a Weetabix 
butter spreader (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/15/make-tourists-pay-for-london-museums>
, 16 January) which I believe she had inherited after my grandfather died. It 
was a short knife with a rounded bulbous blade end which was cross-hatched 
(presumably to aid the spread of hard butter on crumbly Weetabix) and bore the 
legend “Weetabix Spreader”.

• I used to note that, during interviews, politicians began their answers with 
“clearly”, while scientists began with “so” (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/15/make-tourists-pay-for-london-museums>
, 16 January). “Clearly” has all but disappeared, while “so” is widespread. 
Evidence that we have stopped listening to politicians?

• I would suggest a fourth cause of finger cuts that need hospital treatment (
Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/13/avocado-emergency-nearly-cost-my-finger>
, 14 January) and that is the one after the ceremony of the corned beef tin and 
the key.
