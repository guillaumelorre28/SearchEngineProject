We’ve had the tear-jerking tales of Monty the penguin, a bear and a hare and a 
man on the moon, but this yearJohn Lewis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis> is pinning its hopes for a 
bumper Christmas on Buster the boxer, a comedy bouncing dog.

Buster is the star turn in the department store’s festive ad campaign, which 
has become a much anticipated annual media moment in recent years.

The dog’s buddies in the advert, which cost £1m to make in a west London 
studio, include a two foxes, a badger and a hedgehog. The department store will 
spend a total of £6m on the campaign.

The action is set to a cover version of Randy Crawford’s One Day I’ll Fly 
Away, sung by Blythe Pepino of British band Vaults, and the two-minute film 
tells the story of a girl called Bridget who loves to bounce.

Bridget’s dad struggles to set up a trampoline in the garden ready to surprise 
her onChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> morning. 
But only Buster witnesses the garden wildlife trying it out the night before. 
When the girl, played by a six-year-old London actor called Summer, runs into 
the garden to try out her present, Buster beats her to it, showing off his best 
moves on the trampoline.

The ad, with the strapline “Gifts that everyone will love”, is a return to 
gentle comedy after last year’ssentimental story of a lonely old man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/06/john-lewis-christmas-advert-age-uk>
 stuck on the moon.

Craig Inglis, customer director at John Lewis, said: “2016 has certainly been 
quite a year, so we hope our advert will make people smile. It really embraces 
a sense of fun and magic, reminding everyone what it feels to give the perfect 
gift at Christmas.”

Student’s fake John Lewis Christmas advert is runaway hit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2016/nov/06/fake-john-lewis-christmas-advert-student-video>
The retailer’s ads have inspired dozens of parodies, including a version of 
last year’s Man on the Moon ad by the discount grocer Aldi. This year a fake 
John Lewis admade by an A-level student 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/06/festive-fake-viewers-fooled-by-students-john-lewis-christmas-ad>
 has been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube. In recent years 
John Lewis has vied with Sainsbury’s for the most viewed advert, with both 
garnering more than 23m views on YouTube last year.


Once again the adverts have a charitable link. The Wildlife Trusts will get 
10% of sales of cuddly toy versions of the animals as John Lewis aims to offset 
some of the increasing hype around the advert, which is seen as the start of 
the festive season by many British shoppers.

Inglis said: “Each year we work with a charity which fits our ad, and we hope 
this year’s campaign will encourage more children to discover a love of British 
wildlife and encourage support of the Wildlife Trusts.”


The ad was shot on a set built at London’s Black Island Studios and was 
directed by Dougal Wilson, who was responsible for three previous John Lewis 
Christmas adverts including 2011’s The Long Wait, 2012’s The Journey, and 
2014’s Monty’s Christmas.

Buster is played by a dog called Biff, although some of his best moves have 
been created on computer. The CGI has been produced by the same team that 
created Monty the Penguin for the 2014 ad campaign. The wild animals are 
entirely animated.

As in previous years, the ad has been previewed with a series of teasers 
shared on Twitter and Facebook.

For the first time, John Lewis will launch its ad via Sky, going live at 8am 
on Thursday on the satellite operator’s homepage as well as on the retailer’s 
social media channels and website.

It will launch on terrestrial TV at 9.15pm on Thursday evening, during the ITV 
drama Paranoid, and will run again during The X Factor on Saturday. Sky will 
also host a “making of” film and content about British wildlife presented by 
Patrick Aryee.

The retailer will employ a host of innovative social media tools to help 
encourage sharing and interaction as the battle for hearts and minds in the 
run-up to the biggest shopping period of the year becomes increasingly digital.

These include a tie-up with Snapchat, which will allow UK users of the 
messaging app to use a Buster lens on Thursday, so they can snap portraits with 
comedy dog ears and nose. After that, the filter will pop up when Snapchat is 
used in a John Lewis store.


Until Sunday 13 November, customers will be able to use special Twitter 
stickers that pop up when they use the hashtag #bouncebounce to personalise 
their photos with Buster and the other animals.

Visitors to John Lewis’s Oxford Street store will be able to try a virtual 
reality version of the trampoline, where they can bounce alongside the animals 
using Oculus Rift goggles.

John Lewis says its Christmas ad campaigns over the past four years, which 
have included two star-crossed snowmen, have fuelled an average 16% lift in 
festive sales. The number of festive shoppers in John Lewis stores has climbed 
more than 50% from 926,000 to 1.4 million in 2013-15.
