When a 20-year-old hacker broke into US vice-presidential candidate Sarah 
Palin’s Yahoo email account during the 2008 presidential campaign, it didn’t 
take a great deal of computer expertise.

“The hacker simply used the password reset prompt and answered the secret 
questions,” says Dr Nalin Gamagedara Arachchilage, a lecturer in cyber security 
at the Australian Centre for Cyber Security, part of the University of New 
South Wales, based at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.

“He reset her password using her date of birth, zip code and information about 
where she met her spouse. Answers to these questions were accessible with a 
quick Google search.”

Palin was a victim of her fame. But you don’t have to be the governor of 
Alaska for your sensitive personal information to be easily accessed by the 
wrong people. Two out of three Australians have social media accounts, through 
which many of us are guilty of oversharing. And how many of us read privacy 
policies before entering our personal information on a website?

We’re not as safe as we think.

Growing concern

Cybercrime costs Australians more than $1 billion a year, according to the 
Federal Government’s Cyber Security Strategy (CSS), which aims to bolster the 
nation’s cyber defences at government, business and individual levels.

Cybercriminals are aggressive, persistent and constantly improving their 
skills, the CSS says.

Common “intrusion vectors” include websites that download viruses, infected 
USB drives, unsecured wireless hotspots and weak passwords.

And we’ve all received the scam emails. They may be blatant – a Nigerian 
government minister offering to transfer $3 million to your account for 
safekeeping would send most alarm bells ringing – or they might be more subtle.

Why are people susceptible to these attacks? Because they’re human.
Dr Arachchilage 
Phishing is an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate organisation, such as a 
bank, in an attempt to get information such as your username and password. 
Spearphishing is more targeted: the email subject is based on your personal 
information, and may appear to be from an organisation you actually do deal 
with.

Enter information on a fake site and you may find your bank account raided. 
Click on the wrong link and you may find your computer infected with malware 
that spies on you and gathers sensitive information, or locks files and demands 
a ransom to have them unlocked again.

It’s a virtual jungle out there.

The internet of stings

Computer engineers fighting to protect us from harm have their work cut out 
for them.

Our reliance on the internet is growing. Eight out of 10 Australians access 
the internet every day and the typical household is expected to have 24 devices 
connected online by 2019.

As we become increasingly connected to the Internet of Things (everyday 
appliances connected to the internet), there will be even more personal data 
stored in the cloud. Everywhere we go, and in everything we do, we will leave a 
trail of “digital exhaust” (from our blood pressure to our daily schedules), 
and cyber criminals will have more ways to get to it, according to the McAfee 
Labs 2016 Threats Predictions report.

“If we keep our stuff in the cloud and access it from a phone, tablet, kiosk, 
automobile or watch (all of which run different operating systems and different 
applications), we have substantially broadened the attack surface,” the report 
says.

Whereas the home computer has previously been the main focal point of attack, 
smartphones and tablets – as the collection points for a multitude of devices, 
all connected to the cloud – are now likely to be targeted more often.

“We know that phones have vulnerabilities that have not been targeted because 
attackers do not yet have the right financial motivation,” the report says.

“With the increasing use of smartphones and tablets as collection points, we 
expect them to be aggressively targeted during the next five years for the data 
they store or the data that passes through them.”

If it weren’t for the humans…

While the battle to make cyberspace safe rages on, one key vulnerability 
continues to give the bad guys the upper hand.

“Why are people susceptible to these attacks?” asks Dr Arachchilage. “Because 
they’re human.

“Humans are the weakest link in information security. If we could eliminate 
the end user from the system we would be able to make the system secure.”

It turns out that we’re not very good at protecting ourselves. We don’t read 
privacy policies, we use four-digit PINs for our phones instead of touch ID 
linked to a complex password (“It is easy to break into a four-digit PIN,” says 
Dr Arachchilage), and we’re vulnerable to social engineering. In other words, 
we can be scammed.

Personal financial loss is one possibility. Criminals gaining access to our 
employers’ networks through us is another. Loss of reputation is a third 
possibility, as victims of the 2015 Ashley Maddison hack discovered.

The Government’s Stay Smart Online <https://www.staysmartonline.gov.au> 
website has lots of information about online safety and alerts about current 
scams. Here are a few of their safety tips:

Mobile devices

 * Turn on security features

 * Install reputable security software

 * Turn your Bluetooth off when you’re not using it

 * Use encrypted wi-fi networks that require a password and ensure your device 
does not automatically connect to new wi-fi networks

 * Check app permissions. Consider whether you want apps to have access to 
your information 
Computers

 * Set and use strong passwords

 * Back up your data

 * Be wary of emails even though they may appear to come from a legitimate 
source

 * Set your anti-virus and anti-spyware software to scan every incoming and 
outgoing email and attachment automatically

 * Regularly update software 
Social media

 * Read and understand social networking privacy settings

 * Protect your accounts with strong passwords

 * Consider turning off geolocation features in social networking apps

 * Never access social networking by clicking a link in an email or other 
website

 * Never click on suspicious links, even if they are from your friends, as 
their social media account may have been hacked
