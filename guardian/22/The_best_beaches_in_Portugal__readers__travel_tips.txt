Winning tip: Praia da Adraga, Sintra, near Lisbon

It's worth making the 12km journey from Sintra to mainland Europe's most 
westerly sands to see the Atlantic breakers rolling in over Adraga beach. It is 
great for surfing and watching sunsets – which are even better viewed while 
sampling fresh clams in white wine at nearbyAzenhas do Mar 
<http://www.azenhasdomar.com/#/home>, a sheltered restaurant that's built into 
the cliffs.

Miramar, Porto
A lovely, somewhat isolated beach with golden sand about seven miles south of 
Porto. You are almost guaranteed to have huge swathes of the beach to yourself, 
even in the height of summer. On a rock at the water's edge, there is a little 
white chapel,Capela do Senhor da Pedra

, which is celebrated in a festival every June.

Praia do Cabedelo, Minho
A fantastic beach with soft sand that stretches for miles. It is easily 
reached from Viana do Castelo by a short hop on a small ferry. It is a lovely 
area and the town itself is a real delight. Good train links make Viana easy to 
reach, with plenty of shops to stock up on picnic supplies before getting the 
ferry.

Praia de Mira, Figueira da Foz
It is easy to see why this place appeals across the board: there's a beach on 
one side, a lagoon on the other, beach cafes and upmarket dining. There are 
paddle boats, bike hire and pine trails for the active and a seemingly infinite 
stretch of sand for those who want nothing more than to sunbathe.

Praia do Guincho
Guincho beach, on Portugal's Estoril coast, 5km from the town of Cascais, was 
used in the opening sequence of the Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. 
It's easy to see why the movie makers choose it: it's a heady cocktail of 
golden sands, mystical orange rock, white-tipped foamy waves and deep blue 
skies. Perfect for surfing, walking – or watching sunsets or dramatic storms 
late at night.

Troia peninsula, Setúbal
Instead of heading to the crowded beaches of Cascais and Estoril from Lisbon, 
venture south to Setúbal and catch the catamaran to the stunning peninsula of 
Troia. With 18km of sandy beaches you can easily spend a relaxing day with a 
picnic without the hordes of people, or even attempt to see some dolphins from 
one of its boat trips.

Praia da Rocha, Lagos
If you'd like to find a less busy beach in Portugal, aim for Praia da Rocha in 
Portimão, eastern Lagos. This has a stunning stretch of beach and there are 
some amazing caves to explore, too. If you have the kids on board, try visiting 
thePortimão Museum <http://www.museudeportimao.pt/en/Default.aspx> in the 
morning and head to the caves and a swim at Praia da Rocha in the afternoon.

Altura
Away from the more commercial, built-up areas of the western Algarve is 
Altura, a quiet town a few kilometres from the Spanish border. This wonderful, 
family-friendly beach plays host to all sorts of water sports in summer. If you 
fancy some city action, glorious Seville is a 90-minute drive away across the 
border.

Praia do Castelo 
Castelo beach is hidden among the striking cliffs of the Algarve. Fortunately, 
many tourists never make it beyond the long white beaches of Albufeira, leaving 
this tiny cove to more adventurous travellers and locals. Its is small, 
especially at high tide, but has reasonably priced food and drink. Be prepared 
for a chilly entrance though, as the sea is still very brisk until August.

Praia da Oura, Albufeira
The setting of the Oura beach is as perfect as any traveller could wish: its 
soft, golden sands look out to beautiful blue waves. Have lunch at one of the 
simple local restaurants on the promenade that look down on it.
