When it was announced earlier this year that Alessandro Michele would be

 last January. Bathing these holy cloisters in shades of eye-popping light felt 
a bit like a Dolly Parton Christmas Special – but also very 2016. Later in the 
year Gucci’s campaign for FW16 featured a group of geek-luxe hipsters gadding 
about in aparty bus

Neon has also been all over the US Open, with players such as Serena Williams 
(pink fluorescent sleeves), Juan Martin del Potro (bright yellow Karate Kid 
headband) and Ryan Harrison (basically looking like a zesty highlighter pen).

The rise of neon echoes the maximalism trend that The Cut 
<http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/02/trends-maximalist-toolbox.html> cited as “a 
big bona-fide shift in fashion” led by Michele, and that lies in stark contrast 
to the clean lines and sharp cuts of minimalismthat have been a fashion staple 
post Celine and Phoebe Philo. It can be seen in everything fromLisa Frank hair 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BI7TsnFAIjC/> on Instagram to Ugo Rondinone’s 
seven magic mountainsinstallation <http://sevenmagicmountains.com/>. But on a 
high street level, it’s more about the combination of the two trends, mixing 
clean lines with an element of maximalism. This can be seen most clearly in the 
wayathleisure has moved on: it’s not about wearing straight sportswear but 
mixing it up with a more utilitarian elements. In terms of neon, it’s where a 
straight utility look mixes with a club kid aesthetic.
