In 2008, Stefano Callegari invented the trapizzino at 00100, his 
pizza-by-the-slice joint in Rome’s Testaccio district. The name is a play on 
words, combiningtramezzino (a triangular sandwich) and pizza. Unlike a calzone 
orpanzerotto, the bread for a trapizzino is baked separately, then stuffed with 
a filling to order. Callegari’s innovation featured thick, triangular pieces of 
baked dough sliced open and filled with traditional Roman mains such as braised 
oxtail, tripe in tomato sauce, and chicken with peppers. It wasn’t 
revolutionary by global standards, but it was novel for Rome. And because it 
was rooted in traditional flavours and transformed main dishes into quick, 
portable, affordable snacks, the trapizzino was an immediate hit.

Soon it eclipsed 00100’s pizza slices in popularity, and Callegari began 
travelling around Italy showcasing his invention. But it wasn’t until recently 
that the trapizzino had a shop of its own. The appropriately named Trapizzino 
opened in Piazzale di Ponte Milvio in northern Rome last December.

Shortly afterwards, 00100 was closed and a second Trapizzino duly opened in 
its place. Numerous fillings sit in containers on a counter around the open 
kitchen. Classic Roman dishes are still available, but they have been joined by 
others such as the southern Italy-inspiredburrata and anchovy filling and 
zighinì, a spicy Eritrean stew, a nod to Rome’s East African immigrants and a 
sign that Rome’s palate is slowly starting to try new flavours – and not just 
new formats like the trapizzino.
