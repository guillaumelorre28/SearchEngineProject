The starting point for Pieter’s AW16 menswear collection was a photograph from 
1979 of Brian Ridley and Lyle Heeter by Robert Mapplethorpe. It’s a double 
portrait in a homely living room, of two men side by side, in leather and 
chains. One wears a cap, the other… well, his hair is fabulous. Pieter’s models 
were each styled in variations on the ultimate quiff, soft and relaxed at the 
front, slick as hell at the back. Prep with mousse and blast dry, working your 
wax through with a wide-toothed comb. Finish with chains.
