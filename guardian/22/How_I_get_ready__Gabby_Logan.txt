I exercise five days a week and I love it, so I’ll always make sure I get some 
in before a night out. It could be anything from circuits with my trainer or a 
bike ride, to yoga. It doesn’t matter, I always feel better for it. It gives 
my skin a glow and everything feels fresher.

If I’ve got a big week ahead, where I have to wear certain outfits for shows, 
red carpet events or dinners, I will plan everything on the Sunday. I have it 
all ready on the hanging rail in my dressing room so I’m not dithering and 
wasting time. It helps to be organised. The same applies when I go to big 
events such as the Olympics or world championships. If I have 20 shows every 
day for 20 days, I have to be on it. It’s not as if, when I get to Azerbaijan 
or Kiev, I can just nip out to the nearest Zara.

The key is to be decisive. I’m the opposite to my mum, who will ask “This bag 
or this bag?” and there will be one extra chain in the handle. I’ve swung the 
pendulum the other way and I think, “Right, yep, this is it, I’m going for it.” 
However, having two 10-year-old children means I have an occasional wobble as 
I walk down the stairs when they go, “Oh, I didn’t realise you were going to 
wearthat.” My son is very aware. If he sees any chest he will say, “That’s a 
chesty dress.” He once followed up with, “Is Dad going with you to this event?” 
to which I replied, “Yes”, and he said “Good.” It wasn’t even chesty and I am a 
34B – I don’t have anything!
