The Eixample is all about elegant living and is where modernism really took 
off at the turn of the 20th century. Every millionaire wanting to keep up with 
the Jordis commissioned Antoni Gaudí and others to build them a home here. This 
apartment block was once the home of painter Josep Maria Sert, a friend of 
Salvador Dalí and best-known for murals at New York’s Waldforf-Astoria. Calm, 
pale-grey decor is the style here now in the spacious, high-ceilinged rooms. 
There are seven bedrooms and a lovely breakfast room overlooking one of 
Eixample’s trademark wide avenues.

It’s not hard to find this new hotel – just follow your nose (and the queues). 
The best bread in Barcelona comes out of the ovens of theBaluard  
<http://baluardbarceloneta.com/>bakery in Barceloneta and it has teamed up with 
this fast-expanding chain of great-value, stylish hotels to open here, in the 
heart of the city. The 74 rooms are simply decorated. Not big, but big enough. 
And, hey, you’ll be spending all your time at the ground-floor cafe watching 
the breads and pastries being made, and then wolfing them down. I’m betting the 
people at Praktik know how to have a good time – they have just opened 
wine-themedPraktik Vinoteca <http://www.hotelpraktikvinoteca.com/> a few 
minutes away.

The Eixample was planned in the 19th century as a green and healthy antidote 
to the dark and fetid alleys of the old town. Greedy developers screwed with 
the plans but you get a sense of them at this guesthouse, which is in a block 
of streets with a wonderful open space at its heart. There are 11 rooms and 
four apartments, with original hand-painted glass wall tiles and Dutch and 
German furniture from the 1960s and 1970s. You’ll find top tips about the area 
on the very 21st-century smart TVs. Cora, the Dutch manager, has a real passion 
for design.

A friend recommended a hostel called Urbany BCN Go, but I can’t describe it 
because the guy at the front desk was extraordinarily rude and wouldn’t even 
let me have a look around. He did me a favour though, because I walked out, 
crossed Gran Via and discovered TOC hostel. The entrance, with a huge, light 
atrium, is more five-star hotel than hostel. The reception staff are lovely and 
there’s a great communal area with Apple computers, giant screen and bar. 
There’s also a pool and deck with loungers. Dorms are cleverly designed for a 
degree of privacy, and rooms with double and bunks are a steal for families.

Casa Bella Gracia, Gràcia

Gràcia, a village swallowed up by the city, makes a great base for a stay in 
Barcelona: away from the tourist crowds, it retains a sense of community (give 
or take the odd foreign hipster). You’ll find this hotel, once a carpenter’s 
workshop, down one of its many little streets. There are 12 rooms, neatly 
designed, with beautiful tiled floors and modernist posters. There’s a pretty 
roof terrace for a DIY breakfast coffee or sundowner. The owner, Jaume, is a 
fascinating bloke. He sends out an email full of suggestions about the area a 
week before guests arrive. One of my favourite Barcelona restaurants,La Singular
 <http://lasingular-barcelona.com/>, is a minute or two away.

Designed as a 1930s tailor’s workshop (obviously!), this small hostel is 
charming from its owner, who used to be in the fashion business, and her 
daughter, who doles out top-notch tips on restaurants, to its decor – old 
sewing machines, beautiful textiles and antique corsets in frames. The dorms 
are basic and old-school, but the prices are very good for this part of town. 
There’s a roof terrace and free walking, cycling and photography tours.

This part of town has never really had much in the way of interesting places 
to stay. I always recommendHotel del Mar <http://www.hoteldelmarbarcelona.com/>
, which does the job for €70 or so but things are changing in the area.The 
Serras <http://www.hoteltheserrasbarcelona.com/> is new, but you’ll be lucky to 
pay less than €200, and Soho House is launching its first Spanish outpost here 
next year. The H10 chain of hotels is owned by a Catalan family and spreading 
across Europe. They always have great locations and affordable rooms. This new 
hotel has fabulous views across the harbour from the rooms and roof terrace 
(with pool). Breakfast looks amazing but is €19 – save your money and walk to 
nearby Barceloneta market for apa amb tomàquet (toast with tomato) and coffee 
for a few euros.

Chic&basic does what it says on the box with its hotels and apartments. Its 
latest venture is in one of Barcelona’s most, er, characterful barrios. People 
have been talking up the Raval district, just off the Ramblas, for years but it 
can still feel a bit seedy in parts and that’s what makes it interesting. There 
are 10 apartments here, each with lounge (and sofabed), double bedroom and 
kitchen – perfect for a couple with young kids who want to be in the centre of 
town for a few days and save a little by eating in occasionally. Don’t worry 
about that dodgy bloke pushing a shopping trolley past your window – he’s after 
scrap metal, not your mobile phone ...

We Boutique Hotel, Arc de Triomf

The Italian owners of this tiny boutique hotel in a modernist apartment block, 
right next to Ciutadella park, have used lots of retro furniture and 
half-stripped timber but it’s not too cool for school. There are only six 
rooms, each with intricate tiled floors and simple furnishings. Pay a few more 
euros and you get a room with floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony. It’s on 
the edge of the Born district, with its vast choice of bars and restaurants.

“It means Young and Urban,” explained the receptionist. The two Bs are not 
explained, but don’t let the name put you off this spanking new hotel in the 
Born. There are 56 rooms in this former textile factory, in an area once 
devoted to all things clothing (bra and knicker shops still dominate the 
street). It’s all a bit corporate, but at least it tries with witty little 
signs (“Only for authorised personnel, and Bill Murray”, says the sign on one 
door) and rich fabrics and wallpapers. And all will be forgiven once you get to 
the roof, where there’s a plunge pool, loungers and mesmerizing views over the 
Born and beyond.
