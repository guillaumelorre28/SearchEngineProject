It’s hard to think of a time when Vetements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vetements> was an insider brand and not 
the most talked-about label of the last few years. But such is the unrelenting 
pace of the fashion cycle – and moreover, Vetements’s place within that cycle – 
that the Parisian brand is set to relaunch its debut collection, already 
considered to be a cult classic.

Vetements is the Parisian label run by a group of semi-anonymous designers 
headed up by the GeorgianDemna Gvasalia 
<http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/balenciaga-demna-gvasalia-c-v-r.html>. Its 
debut 36-piece collection was shown to an inner-circle industry group and was, 
on first sight, a baffling confection: jeans with stepped hems; hoodies with 
too-long sleeves; trenchcoats with exaggerated proportions; trashed boots with 
lighters for heels. TheNew York Times <http://www.nytimes.com/section/fashion> 
called it “fashion with an aggressive street bent” and rightly so. This was a 
collection of everyday pieces mutated in a bid to put a subversive spin on the 
ordinary.

Widely considered to be anti-establishment fashion loved by the establishment, 
Gvasalia’s label was so widely lauded that soon after Vetements launched, that 
he was given artistic directorship of Balenciaga, one of the most famous luxury 
labels in the industry. The designer however takes some umbrage with the way
Vetements <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vetements> is still seen as an 
outsider: “It’s easy to label it ‘anti’ because it seemed to be slightly 
outside of the system,” he explains. “But we are in the system. We are a part 
of it. We play the game, we just play it by our own rules.”

Vogue e-site, Style.com <https://www.style.com/>, has worked with the label to 
relaunch the autumn/winter collection, which will be available online from 30 
September.
