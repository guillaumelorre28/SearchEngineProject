As with wine, the “terroir” a coffee is grown in – that is, the soil, 
topography and climate – has a strong effect on its taste. Coffee grows best 
near the equator, in warm, humid climates. Of the two main types of coffee, 
arabicas thrive at altitudes of 1,000 to 2,000 metres; robustas at between 100 
and 800 metres.

Key growing regions include Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Kenya, 
India and Ethiopia. Nespresso coffee experts travel the world in search of the 
finest beans to blend together into its 24 different Grands Crus, sourced from 
small coffee producers who are then supported and given expert advice through 
the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality™ Program.

One such farmer is Jaime Elias Eraso, whose land in Nariño, south-western 
Colombia, benefits from abundant sunshine at high altitudes, ideal rainfall, 
and rich volcanic soil. “Thanks to the increase in income paid for the 
sustainable quality of our green coffee,” he says, “we have been able to do 
things like fix up our house, and I bought another plot for growing coffee.”

It starts with a cherry

The fruit on a coffee tree starts off as a green cherry, turning to a vibrant 
red when ripe. It’s vital to identify the right moment. “The quality of coffee 
can be completely destroyed if it is harvested before it is ripe or when it is 
overripe,” says Alexis Rodriguez, green coffee quality and development manager 
for Nespresso.

The coffee cherries used in the Nespresso Grands Crus are mostly harvested by 
hand, with pickers using their skill and expertise to determine the readiness 
and quality of each cherry. Even when machines are used, the harvest is 
filtered for imperfections and cherries are graded accordingly.

Enter the bean

Nestled inside each red cherry are two green beans – they only turn brown when 
roasted. Three different methods are used to extract them.

If coffee is processed using the “dry method”, it’s referred to as “unwashed” 
coffee. In this quick, easy and inexpensive method, cherries are simply dried 
on large surfaces in the fresh air for three weeks to a month.

The second method, favoured by Nespresso, is the “wet method”. This involves 
removing the seed and washing off any residual fruit flesh before drying and 
milling the beans. This takes more time and investment, but intensifies 
aromatic flavours and reduces any bitterness.

The “semi-dry method” is the third option: if this hybrid of the wet and dry 
methods is performed correctly, it can maintain the balance between the 
coffee’s body and acidity.

On the move

After green coffee has been processed, it typically has a long journey to a 
production centre. In the case of Nespresso beans, they are taken to, 
Switzerland, after being shipped to Europe by boat via the most expedient 
shipping routes, to protect the quality of the fresh harvest.

There, a rigorous round of quality control begins, with every 60kg bag of 
coffee tested for conformity of physical and sensorial properties, the degree 
of humidity and the quality of coffee beans delivered. The experts at Nespresso 
take a sample from each sack to roast and taste – a final assurance of quality.

The “alchemy” of roasting, blending and grinding

Blending coffees from different regions and roasting them to develop their 
full potential is a crucial stage in the bean-to-cup process. Green coffee is 
selected for characteristics including aroma, finesse and lasting aftertaste, 
then skilfully combined with beans from a different origin for complementary 
aromas and extra body.

The best coffee producers, such as Nespresso, use a complex, time-consuming 
and skilled process known as “split-roasting”. This is where each component in 
the blend is roasted at different temperatures and for different durations 
before being blended, in order to bring each one to perfection. To take just 
one example, in the Bukeela ka Ethiopia blend, wild and musky beans from 
western Ethiopia are roasted darker and shorter to add body, then blended with 
beans from the southern Sidama region that have been roasted longer and 
lighter, to bring out their floral, bergamot notes.

The grind completes this stage of the process. After roasting, the coffee 
beans are transferred to an airtight silo, preserving their aroma, before being 
placed in a grinder that reduces the beans to a powder. Each grind is 
accurately calculated to perfectly suit the blend of origins and produce 
top-quality coffee.

Sealed-in freshness

The final stage of the journey is to your cup. Once roasted, beans can rapidly 
lose their freshness and flavour. Nespresso came up with an elegant solution to 
this problem when it began 30 years ago: its hermetically sealed aluminium 
capsules protect the Grand Cru coffees from light, air and humidity, so the 
coffee arrives in your cup as fresh as when it was ground. The clever capsule 
shape ensures an even flow of water through the ground coffee during 
extraction, and each one has an instantly recognisable signature colour, so you 
can choose your favourite blend at a glance.

A sustainable future

Nespresso aims to increase its collection capacity for used aluminium capsules 
to 100% wherever the company does business, and to source 100% of its aluminium 
capsule material in line with the world conservation union’s new Aluminium 
Stewardship Initiative standards.

By 2016, more than 70,000 farmers across 11 countries have joined Nespressos 
AAA Sustainable Quality™ Program, representing more than 80% of the company’s 
total coffee supply. With support from long-term partners Rainforest Alliance 
and Fairtrade, Nespresso has a target of sourcing 100% of its permanent Grand 
Cru range through the program by 2020, and expanding the scheme in Ethiopia, 
Kenya and South Sudan.
