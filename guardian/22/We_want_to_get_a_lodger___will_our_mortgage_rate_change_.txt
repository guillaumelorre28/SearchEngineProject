Q I am about to buy a property with my partner and have agreed and signed the 
offer on a fixed-rate mortgage.

We are buying a two-bedroom flat and want to rent one of the bedrooms out. 
When do we have to notify our lender, and will the mortgage rate change?IP

A You should check with your mortgage lender before you take in a lodger to 
make sure that you would not breaching the terms of the mortgage you have 
applied for. Assuming that your lender doesn’t mind you having a lodger – as is 
the case with most lenders – it is unlikely there will be any change to your 
mortgage rate.


If you were to move out of your flat and let the whole of it to a paying 
tenant, you would need to get a “consent to let” or convert to a buy-to-let 
mortgage and pay a higher rate of interest. But simply taking in a lodger while 
still living in the flat does not require a change to the mortgage rate you pay.

Taking in a lodger can, however, affect your buildings and contents insurance, 
so you need to check with your insurers. Assuming your flat is a leasehold 
property, you should also check that the lease doesn’t prohibit you from having 
a lodger.


Finally, if you plan to charge your lodger more than £7,500 a year (£625 a 
month), you must also inform HM Revenue & Customs.Since 6 April 2016, under its 
rent-a-room scheme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/14/lodger-allowance-rent-spare-room-tax-free-sum>
, the first £7,500 of rent you from a lodger is tax-free (up from £4,250 in 
previous tax years) but you would have to pay tax on any rent over the £7,500 
limit. If you each get half the rental income, you each get a tax-free amount 
of £3,750.
