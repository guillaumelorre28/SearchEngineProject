In 2012, I embarked on an eccentric project. Having realised how anglocentric 
my reading was, I decided to try to read a novel, short story collection or 
memoir from every UN-recognised country, plus former UN member Taiwan (then 196 
nations in all), in a calendar year.

I set up a blog, ayearofreadingtheworld.com 
<http://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/>, and asked the world’s book lovers to help 
me. Pretty soon suggestions – and even books, manuscripts and unpublished 
translations – were flooding in from around the planet.

My criteria for choosing the titles I read varied and developed throughout the 
year. Sometimes I opted for national favourites. At other times I picked 
wildcards that intrigued me because they seemed at odds with the society that 
had produced them, such as works by exiled writers. And there were narratives 
that challenged my preconceptions in a huge number of ways.

Not all the books I read were set in the countries in question, but many were 
evocative of the regions they describe. Since then I’ve continued to seek out 
books that transport me to a different place. Here are 10 of my favourites:

Bhutan

The Circle of Karma by Kunzang Choden 
Following a young woman on her quest for enlightenment, this novel takes 
readers on a tour of the Buddhist gompas of the Himalayas in Bhutan and 
northern India, revealing marvels along the way. Seeing the religious sites 
through the eyes of a believer is a powerful experience, as are the 
descriptions of the majestic landscape and desperate living conditions the 
protagonist encounters. It is also the first book by a female Bhutanese author 
to be published outside Bhutan.

Beauty on Earth by Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz,  translated from the French by 
Michelle Bailat-Jones
The early-20th-century Swiss writer Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz uses a visual 
artist’s sensibility to capture life on the shores of a central European lake 
in this tale of a young Cuban immigrant’s arrival in a rural community. Small 
details are rendered with fine brushwork: “a ladder of sunshine … descended 
from a hole in the sky,” a leaf “wrinkled up … like a duck’s foot”. The result 
is a mesmeric picture, from which we can step back in the final pages to 
appreciate the full effect.

Angola

Our Musseque by José Luandino Vieira, translated from the Portuguese by Robin 
Patterson 
The shanty towns in Luanda, the capital of Angola, in the 1940s and 1950s, 
come are vividly depicted in this idiosyncratic novel published more than 40 
years after the author wrote it, in prison. Prostitutes, shopkeepers, children 
and drunks jostle and collide, giving conflicting accounts of their experiences 
as the civil war approaches, a conflict that will change their lives for good. 
Funny, shocking and moving, it makes you nostalgic for a place you have never 
been.

African Delights by Siphiwo Mahala
Roving between South Africa’s townships and the country’s wealthier districts, 
this irreverent, bold and engrossing collection of interlinked stories captures 
the complexities, contradictions and tensions of the country in the late 20th 
century. The sharp contrasts in the settings highlight the injustices woven 
into the society, while the humour and winning audacity of many of the 
disadvantaged characters make the cruelty of the insults they have to live with 
all the more telling. At times you feel as though you are sitting at their 
kitchen tables listening to their stories.

Myanmar

Smile as they Bow by Nu Nu Yi, translated from the Burmese by Alfred Birnbaum 
and Thi Thi Aye
A spirit festival in a small Burmese village is the backdrop to this absorbing 
novel, one of the few books from Myanmar to have been translated into English. 
Nu Nu Yi’s sensual descriptions of the hustle and bustle of the event – to 
which people from all walks of life flock to pay dancers to perform as a way of 
atoning for their misdeeds and drawing down blessings – are a joy to read. The 
colourful setting is second only to the vitality of the central character, 
Daisy Bond, a foul-mouthed transgender spirit dancer with a talent for 
deception.

The Wandering Falcon by Jamil Ahmad
Some descriptions can be as breathtaking as the landscapes they depict, and 
Pakistani author Jamil Ahmad’s certainly fits into that category. As the novel 
follows his nomadic protagonist, Tor Baz, the wild and treacherous hill country 
around the borders of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan unfolds in all its harsh 
beauty. Reading the book can feel like picking your way over its mountain 
crags, or standing on the plains watching pursuers approach through the clouds 
of dust whipped up by the region’s 120-day winds.

The Ladies are Upstairs by Merle Collins 
Psychogeography has a significant role to play in this lively collection of 
short stories, in which colonial history haunts the landscape of present-day 
Grenada. Eerie encounters on lonely roads and the pomp of the architecture of 
centuries past combine to present a richer and more engrossing picture of the 
“Island of Spice” than tourist brochures could ever do. Through it all runs a 
powerful sense of community, warmth and humanity.

Equatorial Guinea

By Night the Mountain Burns by Juan Tomás Ávila Laurel, translated from the 
Spanish by Jethro Soutar
The tiny isle of Annobón, a province of Equatorial Guinea, bursts from the 
page in this glorious novel. Packed with details about island life: from how 
you make a canoe out of a tree trunk and the practicalities of cutting dates 
off palm trees, to the songs and superstitions that bind the society together. 
The book bubbles with interest, while its narrative is based on the region’s 
oral traditions. As a result it melds the familiar with the strange to draw us 
into the landscape and community of the island. This is only the second novel 
from Equatorial Guinea to be translated into English, so it is a rare and 
precious window on a little-known part of the globe.

UK/Wales

Martha Jack and Shanco by Caryl Lewis, translated from the Welsh by Gwen Davies
The west Wales landscape is a key player in this haunting novel about three 
ageing siblings who have spent their lives on their parents’ farm. Lewis writes 
in such a way that the harsh cold and comfortlessness of the place seem to seep 
out of the pages to hold you in their grip, even as flashes of natural beauty 
burst from the text. It is a stark reminder that you don’t have to travel far 
from home to find yourself in a different world.

Death in the Andes by Mario Vargas Llosa, translated from the Spanish by Edith 
Grossman
Peruvian Nobel prize-winner Mario Vargas Llosa’s chilling tale is of murder, 
terrorism and vengeful spirits in the mountains. At once menacing and 
beautiful, his landscape is as unpredictable as the bands of outlaws that roam 
through it, plaguing the imagination of Corporal Lituma and his junior officer, 
who are charged with investigating disappearances in the mining community 
around their post. Unsettling and memorable.
