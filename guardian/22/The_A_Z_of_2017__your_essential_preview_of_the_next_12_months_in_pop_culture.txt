It’s a good year for big-name directors

The next 12 months promises the return of some directorial big names. Steven 
Soderbergh, who claimed he had retired from filmmaking, makes a surprise 
reversal with NASCAR heist movie Logan Lucky, while another Steven, Spielberg, 
looks to banish memories of box-office flop The BFG with the more 
serious-minded The Kidnapping Of Edgaro Mortara. Kathryn Bigelow has been quiet 
since 2012’s Zero Dark Thirty, but is back in 2017 with an untiled movie about 
the 1967 Detroit riots that features, among others, John Boyega, while Darren 
Aronofsky swaps biblical epics for psychological thrillers with the Jennifer 
Lawrence-starring Mother. And if that weren’t enough there’s also: Last Flag 
Flying, Richard Linklater’s spiritual sequel to 70s comedy The Last Detail; 
Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk; Sofia Coppola’s civil war drama The Beguiled; 
Alexander “Nebraska” Payne doing comedy sci-fi with Downsizing and an untitled 
Paul Thomas Anderson effort about 50s fashion that reunites the director with 
chief milkshake-drinker Daniel Day Lewis.GM

CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM
Accept no imitations! Larry David’s sitcom is finally back

It’s more than five years since the last Curb Your Enthusiasm. Five years 
since HBO’s choral sting was followed by those umpy-pumpy Michelini strains. 
Five years since Susie Essman last screamed anyone out of her house. They have 
been a long five years indeed. Thankfully, a new series is due at some point 
next year. And it can’t come a moment too soon. We now live in a world of 
half-hearted Curb imitators, all labouring under the delusion that Curb was 
nothing but floridly improvised swearwords. How wrong they were. Only Curb Your 
Enthusiasm has those same tight, Seinfeld-ian plots that explode together in 
the final minutes. Only Curb Your Enthusiasm can distinguish between “celebrity 
cameo” and “good celebrity cameo”. Only Curb Your Enthusiasm has the nerve to 
let JB Smoove go off at full-tilt as often as he wants. And only Curb Your 
Enthusiasm can bring out the best in Larry David. After his limp Woody Allen 
movie, his underpowered HBO film and the Broadway show most of us never got to 
see, a new series of Curb will give us the dose of undiluted, misanthropic, 
misunderstood David we’ve all been craving. Hurry back, Larry.SH

Stone Roses – 10 of the best

Some feared it would never happen. Others feared it would. And now, it seems 
that it finally is. A third Stone Roses album will be released in 2017. Almost 
certainly. We nervously await further developments. It’s fair to say that the 
Roses aren’t the most reliable bunch but, happily, other comebacks look just as 
exciting and much more concrete. Magnificently moody goth Glaswegians Jesus And 
Mary Chain (pictured) even have a name and a date (Damage And Joy, 24 March) 
for their first new album in 18 years. Stephin Merritt’s wry pop stylists 
Magnetic Fields have already released five tracks from their sprawling, 
self-descriptive 50 Song Memoir (out 3 March). Arcade Fire are being rather 
more vague, suggesting a late-spring release for their followup to Reflektor. 
And there’s LCD Soundsystem, who cancelled a tour last year to crack on with 
their new opus, the first since 2010’s This Is Happening. Their ecstatic 
comeback shows bode well.PH

EPISODE VIII
Five reasons why the new Star Wars will top The Force Awakens

1 Isle be back: the still-untitled Episode VIII (out 15 Dec) apparently picks 
up where we left off (with Rey and Luke on Jedi Craggy Island), just like the 
pulp serials that inspired George Lucas in the first place.

2 The original gangster of cute robotics R2-D2 is recharged and ready to kick 
BB-8 to the kerb.

3 There are new cast additions include Oscar-hefting oddball Benicio del Toro 
and David Lynch favourite Laura Dern…

4 … plus there are rumours of a Tom Hardy cameo.

5 Finally, after JJ Abrams so thoroughly rehashed (sorry, “lovingly homaged”) 
the
 original films, new director Rian Johnson has no option but to take audiences 
somewhere new.GV

Fabric: a nightclub that thrived by taking dance music seriously

FABRIC
The return of London’s best-loved club signals a brighter future for the 
nation’s nightlife

Clubbers – in fact, anyone with a woke eye on how council decisions can affect 
nightlife and, by extension, culture at large – fist-bumped the air in November 
when Fabric announced its reopening. After a lengthy court appeal and 
widespread #SaveOurCulture campaign, in which even ex-Spice Girl Mel C sported 
one of its T-shirts, the London venue will open once again on 6 January.

Fabric’s sudden closure following two drug-related deaths last September 
sparked concerns for UK nightlife up and down the country. But its return – 
with secret guests on Friday and a “friends and family” party on 7 January 
featuring their usual DJ residents – waves a triumphant flag for the future.

There are other sizeable venues contributing to this sense of victory (even if 
few are actually calling themselves “clubs”). In Newcastle upon Tyne, Boiler 
Shop has been recently renovated and turned into a multi-arts space, with 
parties from pop giants Guilty Pleasures and more. In London’s Canada Water, an 
“experimental, multi-purpose cultural destination” is due to open on 4 
February. Printworks, from the promoters behind Festival No 6 and Snowbombing, 
will cram club nights, gigs, probably even a small village into its eye-popping 
16 acres

But while two clubs does not a new heyday make – and opening one is a risky 
business these days – the Fabric campaign proved that the appetite for 
forward-thinking nightlife has not dried up or fallen prey to, say, more 
Instagrammable experiences. If the kids want to dance, really there’s no 
stopping them.KH

GORILLAS 
We’re going ape for the year’s most unlikely trend

You’d think 2016 – the year Harambe chest-pounded his way into the great 
banana grove in the sky – would become known as the Year of the Gorilla. But 
brace yourself, because over the next 12 months we’re getting a new Gorillaz 
album, a pair of cinematic blockbusters in Kong: Skull Island and War For The 
Planet Of The Apes, and a new Idris Elba-starring political drama Guerrilla. 
Which, there’s no denying it, sounds like “gorilla”. We’d say “that’s a lot of 
monkey business” were it not an unforgivable misuse of biological nomenclature. 
The apes are taking over. There’s no esc-ape. YOU MANIACS! GOD DAMN YOU ALL TO 
HELL!!!LH

HAMILTON
A guide to getting tickets to the biggest show around

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway phenomenon Hamilton opens at London’s Victoria 
Palace Theatre, SW1, in November. Tickets go on sale on 30 January and, well, 
there is next to no chance that you’re going to get one. That isn’t to say you 
shouldn’t try. Not wanting to waste your shot, your best bet is to get a 
desktop computer, a laptop, an iPad, a landline phone and two mobiles, and 
hammer the ticketing site as soon as tickets go on sale. It’ll take you hours, 
and bring you to the edge of despair, but it might just be worth it. Failing 
that, why not try a scalping site, morally dubious as that is? Secondary 
ticketing site Stubhub has tickets for the current Broadway production priced 
at £500 each. And that’s for a version that’s been running for almost two 
years. However, this is the perfect option for anyone who’s both 
catastrophically wealthy and very slightly evil. Any other tactics? Of course! 
I guarantee you that, 15 years from now, one of your yet-unborn nieces and 
nephews will co-star in a painfully middling school production of Hamilton that 
you can watch for next to nothing. There, problem solved.SH

I LOVE DICK
That made you look: now, here are 2017’s best US TV comedies 

If you’re expecting frat boy larks from that title, think again: instead Jill 
Solloway’s I Love Dick is an adaptation of Chris Kraus’s satirical novel about 
love and relationships in academic life. After a successful pilot, the series, 
which stars Kevin Bacon (pictured) and Kathryn Hahn, is coming to Amazon, where 
a new season of Solloway’s excellent Transparent will also be appearing. After 
wowing us with its tales of relationships, racial politics and rigatoni, Aziz 
Ansari’s marvellous Master Of None comes back for a second run on Netflix, 
where you’ll also find a TV adaptation of satirical college comedy Dear White 
People and Drew Barrymore’s dark California sitcom Santa Clarita Diet. Two fine 
2016 debuts return for second series in 2017: Donald Glover’s woozy Atlanta and 
Issa Rae’s whip-smart Insecure. Finally, after six series and an endless number 
of thinkpieces, Lena Dunham’s Girls will call it a day after a one last season 
in February.GM

Eight standups bringing the funny in the next 12 months

Last seen delivering a brilliant monologue on the first post-election Saturday 
Night Live, Dave Chappelle will return with no less than three Netflix specials 
in 2017, his first filmed standup shows in 12 years. IRL dates for the diary 
include Whoopi Goldberg, performing her first ever UK standup gig at the London 
Palladium (W1, 11 Feb). British standups with star power also hit the road: 
Ricky Gervais’s Humanity tour begins in Feb; Jack Whitehall swaps Hollywood for 
Sunderland; and Rob Brydon returns to the stage for the first time in eight 
years. If you like your heavyweights more cerebral than commercial, Sara 
Pascoe, Bridget Christie and Stewart Lee will all grace venues across the UK

THE KARDASHIANS
Kim, Khloé, Kourtney et al lead the year in reality TV

If you’ve been given the cold-shoulder, take heart because Khloe Kardashian is 
here to whip your butt so hard the object of your desire will rue the day they 
ever let it go. “Let’s turn the haters into motivators,” vows the steely 
workout mistress of Revenge Body With Khloé Kardashian (starts 15 Jan, E!). 
She’s backed by the muscle of celebrity trainers Harley Pasternak and Gunnar 
Peterson to push civilians to look Hollywood hot. That’s just one of the usual 
gaggle of Kardashian-themed reality series this year. Rumours are rife that 
Khloe’s BFF Malika Haqq could be entering Celebrity Big Brother (Tue, 9pm, 
Channel 5). Also on the reality radar: Gary Barlow brings his fist of pure 
emotion to Let It Shine, in which he and Dannii Minogue search for the cast of 
a Take That musical. That launches on BBC1 on 7 Jan, when it will take on ITV’s 
newly acquired The Voice in the quest
 for Saturday night supremacy. HV

LORDE
Auckland’s finest heads up 2017’s most anticipated albums

It’s natural to celebrate turning 20 with a hyperbolic social media post. But 
using that to tease an album is probably a first. Lorde’s November Facebook 
address got 49,000 likes while still giving nothing away. All we know is that 
she’s been exchanging studio knob pics with Fun’s Jack Antonoff. Also in 2017 
we should hear Jay Z’s response to Lemonade; someone who may have an insight is 
electronic artist Sampha, who follows up work on Solange’s album with his debut 
(3 Feb). The xx’s psychodramas are more oblique but at least they’re clear 
about when their record drops (13 Jan); St Vincent promises a “sea change” with 
a new album out in spring; while Haim say they’ll get back to their roots with 
theirs, out in summer. Also keping it vague are Dirty Projectors, whose idea of 
teasing a release is to post a vid of Dave Longstreth’s head in a wind tunnel. 
Colour us intrigued.MH

MOTHERLAND
A family farce heads up the next 12 months in British comedy

From Flowers to Fleabag, 2016’s comedies were notable for their melancholy, 
but next year will see a swath of more joyful new Britcoms hit the small 
screen. Sharon Horgan and Graham Linehan’s school run-based farce Motherland 
(pictured above), which piloted on BBC2 in September, returns for a series, 
while more middle-aged mayhem comes courtesy of Mitchell and Webb, who are 
rookie pub owners in new C4 sitcom Back. Brydon and Coogan tour Spain in what 
is sure to be a transcendent third series of The Trip, while Horgan and Rob 
Delaney will be having another Catastrophe. There’s plenty of youthful folly, 
too: Jamie Demetriou’s magnificently strange estate agent Stath graduates from 
E4 Blap to full series; old pals Tim Key and Tom Basden team up for gap-year 
caper Foreign Bodies (pictured below, C4); and the Inbetweeners-shaped sad-lad 
comedy hole gets filled by the show’s co-creator Damon Beesley’s new 1983-set 
BBC2 comedy White Gold, starring Joe Thomas, James Buckley and Gossip Girl’s Ed 
Westwick as used-car salesmen. Famous faces also grace Sky’s Sick Note: Rupert 
Grint plays a compulsive liar alongside Don Johnson and Nick Frost; while in 
high-concept C4 comedy Loaded, four friends hit the big time when their gaming 
business sells for millions.RA

NEVER-ENDING SEQUELS
Expect to see plenty of repeat offenders in the year ahead

Unless they’re voting for self-destuctive political upheaval, people fear 
change. We like what we know. That’s why seven of the top 10 highest-grossing 
films of all time are sequels. So it comes as no OMG that 2017 is another year 
comprising an exhausting barrage of follow-ups: there’s Jurassic World 2; the 
eighth entry in The Fast And The Furious; a new Pirates Of The Caribbean; 
Michael Bay inflicts another Transformers on us all; the world waits with 
not-so-bated breath for a new Saw; Huge Action (AKA Hugh Jackman) plays stabby 
X Men lambchop enthusiast Logan one last time; Guardians Of The Galaxy gets a 
Vol 2; Brad Pitt battles the zombie hordes in World War Z 2; and Keanu goes on 
another daft revenge mission in John Wick 2. Oh, plus a new Kingsman; Cars 3; 
Despicable Me 3; Fifty Shades Darker, and... look, we’re out of room. But trust 
us, there are a lot of sequels. Lots. Like, LOADS.LH

From La La Land to Moonlight, 2017’s awards field looks competitive... and so 
does 2018’s!

The best picture race at this year’s Academy Awards (26 Feb) might just be the 
tightest in years. Showbiz musical La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma 
Stone, is the bookies’ fave. It’s in UK cinemas from 13 Jan, but faces 
competition in the form of devastating drama Manchester By The Sea (13 Jan) 
starring Casey Affleck, and gay African-American love story Moonlight (24 Feb), 
not to mention new Scorsese film Silence (out New Year’s Day) and the affecting 
Denzel Washington directed/starring drama Fences (17 Feb). On the acting front, 
Gosling, Washington and Affleck are all fancied for the best actor gong, and 
Stone, Natalie Portman (for Kennedy biopic Jackie, out 20 Jan) and Annette 
Benning (for wry dramedy 20th Century Women, out 10 Feb) look set to battle it 
out for best actress.GM

PODCASTS
We’re all ears as podcasting prepares for a big 2017

The podcast came of age in 2016 ... but where will it go from here? “I think 
there’ll be more efforts to expand beyond a podcast alone, to support it with 
different multimedia experiences,” says Helen Zaltzman of Answer Me This! and 
The Allusionist. Plus, expect to see existing shows remade for TV: horror 
series Lore, social-commentary comedy Throwing Shade, podcast-themed podcast 
StartUp and, of course, Serial are among those that have been optioned by 
programme-makers. Speaking of which, Serial could well be watercooler-worthy 
once again. Host Sarah Koenig (pictured) was recently spotted at a murder 
trial, fuelling speculation that the show will return to its cold-case roots.HJD

QUALITY BRITISH DRAMA
From No Offence to Top Of The Lake, there’s lots to look forward to from our 
side of the pond

BBC1 gets its first punch in early: Taboo hoves into view next week (7 Jan), 
with Tom Hardy as an adventurer who returns from Africa to London in 1814 to 
take on the East India Trading Company. Steven “Peaky Blinders” Knight is the 
co-creator, with Jonathan Pryce, Mark Gatiss and Oona Chaplin in the cast. 
Looks meaty, but will its Saturday night slot work? Plenty more dark epics this 
year: the Beeb’s SS-GB sees 007 writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade dramatise 
Len Deighton’s alternative-history novel, with Sam Riley as a cop in Nazi-run 
1940s London; Helen McCrory is a crusading lawyer whose investigation of an 
East Anglian murder uncovers an international conspiracy in Fearless (ITV). Big 
series with big writers slated for new series include Paul Abbott’s No Offence 
(pictured, C4), Jed Mercurio’s Line Of Duty (BBC2), Peter Bowker’s The A Word 
(BBC1) and Mike Bartlett’s Doctor Foster (BBC1). Bartlett is currently 
unstoppable, with future-monarchy play King Charles III (BBC2) and his episode 
in Steven Moffat’s last run of Doctor Who (BBC1) also incoming. Jane Tennison 
prequel Prime Suspect 1973 is on its way to ITV, despite Lynda La Plante taking 
her name off the credits; JK Rowling sounds far happier with The Cuckoo’s 
Calling (BBC1), based on her book written as Robert Galbraith. Promising shows 
all, but can anything beat the return of Jane Campion’s uncategorisable Top Of 
The Lake (BBC2) – now with added Gwendoline Christie and a wild-grey-haired 
Nicole Kidman?JS

R&B
From Drake to the Weeknd, it’s set to dominate again in 2017

Sure, 2016 might have been Trump’s year, but try telling that to Drake. Or 
Beyoncé. Or Rihanna. Musically, last year, US R&B had more force than a Star 
Wars sequel. This year, those artists will continue to slay, with Drake 
bringing his sad rap steeze to arenas around UK from 25 Jan, rivalled by the 
Weeknd (pictured) – who, like an inverse Samson, has grown in strength since he 
cut off those rank tarantula dreads – and will be doing much the same in March. 
Live this month there’s also mannequin-challenge meme-makers Rae Sremmurd, 
starting at Shepherds Bush Empire, as well as the hope that Ri-Ri will be

STRANGER THINGS
...leads our round-up of the best US drama to watch in 2017

It was the TV smash of 2016. Now Netflix is hoping to recreate lightning in a 
bottle with season two of Stranger Things. New characters and new mysteries 
have been promised. Also returning next year is hit anthology series American 
Crime Story, this time swapping OJ Simpson for Hurricane Katrina. Fargo’s back, 
too, jumping from 1979 to 2010 for its third season. Its showrunner Noah Hawley 
is also in charge of bizarro X Men spin-off Legion. Also busy is Orange Is The 
New Black top dog Jenji Kohan, who is handling both season five of that show 
and the debut of female wrestling comedy-drama G.L.O.W.. Some literary works 
are getting the TV treatment next year: Neil Gaiman’s fantasy novel American 
Gods; cyberpunk opus Altered Carbon; and Margaret Atwood’s dystopian work The 
Handmaid’s Tale.
 Most intriguing of all is The Deuce, David “The Wire” Simon’s account of the 
NYC porn industry, starring James Franco.GM

T2 TRAINSPOTTING 
Choose life, choose a 2017 sequel to Danny Boyle’s cult classic

T2: Trainspotting is due in cinemas on 27 January. Nobody has seen it yet, but 
here are five things that will definitely happen:

1 Someone will embark upon a diatribe against the gentrification of Edinburgh 
city centre.

2 A Hatchimal (Google it, non-parents) will crawl across the ceiling.

3 There will definitely be a scene where Renton overdoses on heroin in front 
of a YouTube unboxing video.

4 Begbie, when offered edamame beans by a waitress in Wagamama, will scream 
with anguish and stab her to death.

5 Ewan Bremner, AKA Spud, will be the best thing in it again. SH

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
Three TV mysteries we’d like to see resolved soon

What happened to Agent Cooper? 
With Twin Peaks coming back, we should get an answer as to what became of Kyle 
MacLachlan’s coffee-sipping agent (pictured, right), last seen possessed by the 
monstrous Killer Bob.

Will Gendry make a comeback?
Robert Baratheon’s only surviving child (pictured, left) was last seen fleeing 
via boat back in season three of Game Of Thrones. He’s got a solid claim to the 
Iron Throne, so surely has a role to play. Will he pop up in season seven?

Where is Westworld? 
HBO’s robot drama gave us lots of answers in its first season, but we still 
don’t know where its cowboy theme park is located? Outer space? In virtual 
reality? Or have they just repurposed Alton Towers?GM

VALKYRIEN

WELLIES
You’re gonna need them: next year’s festival lineups are worth braving the mud 
and rain for

As genres merge and listeners’ tastes become more diverse, festival 
organisers, whose events are no longer guided by tribalistic 
indie/dance/pop/metal parameters find themselves competing for the same pool of 
artists. Thanks to an abundance of major-league album releases in 2016, and 
some genuine coups by bookers, however, an imaginative summer season is on the 
horizon. Two notoriously mysterious figures make their debuts in London’s 
Victoria Park, E3, in June and July respectively: Aphex Twin will headline 
Field Day’s specially made venue, The Barn – a gigantic hangar-like 
construction that boasts a state-of-the-art sound system and lighting – to the 
delight of techno purists, industrial obsessives and ambient nerds. A month 
later, Frank Ocean faces the challenge of reinterpreting the complexity and 
intimacy of his acclaimed album Blonde for the swaying masses at Lovebox. 
Radiohead meanwhile, return to Glastonbury for their first Pyramid stage set 
since 2003, a time so distant their fellow main stage headliners then included 
Moby. Arcade Fire stage their grand return in 2017 with appearances at both 
Isle of Wight and Barcelona’s Primavera Sound, the latter of which so far 
outstrips all UK lineups: both Aphex Twin and Ocean will perform, as well as 
Grace Jones, the xx, Bon Iver, Slayer, Solange and Van Morrison. A banquet of 
sounds for all ages and attitudes, although admittedly, not one at which 
wellies are necessary.HG

 Console wars. 
XBOX SCORPIO 
The new king of consoles leads the year in gaming

Due towards the end of 2017, Xbox Scorpio will be the world’s most powerful 
games console, usurping reigning powerhouse, PlayStation 4 Pro. Nintendo, by 
contrast, is refusing to get involved in all this tech-spec willy-waving. 
Instead, its upcoming Switch console’s selling point is that it lets you both 
play games on your TV at home, and use it as a portable device to play wherever 
you like. It will also host the magnificent-looking The Legend of Zelda: Breath 
Of The Wild, an adventure that promises to blend open-world exploration with 
the franchise’s perfect puzzles and familiar foes. For those with VR headsets, 
Star Trek: Bridge Crew puts you and a group of strangers in charge of the USS 
Aegis, with your co-operation essential to surviving encounters with the 
Klingons. And harking back to the golden age of 3D platform games, Yooka-Laylee 
is the colourful, Kickstarter-funded spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie, the 
best non-Mario platformer ever made.NG

YOUNG TALENT
From grime to socially conscious punk, the future is bright

Another year, another bevy of fresh-faced acts whose names you’ll be dropping 
for the next 12 months. Jorja Smith (pictured) adds classical flourishes to her 
Walsall-bred future-thinking R&B, while Londoners the Big Moon and Brighton’s 
Black Honey do alt-rock that will have you partying like it’s 1995. Elsewhere, 
Nadia Rose’s no-nonsense Croydon-inspired bars and AJ Tracey and Dave’s 
respective grime and rap prowess are the perfect accompaniment to those fresh 
Nikes that Santa gave you. Elsewhere, for stripped-back, Pharrell-endorsed 
electropop, look no further than Maryland’s Maggie Rogers, who’s set to release 
her debut EP in February. If that’s somehow not enough, then socially conscious 
Manchester punkers Cabbage, the 1975-approved synth-popper the Japanese House, 
and Lil Yachty, the post-ironic Atlanta rapper of distinctive red barnet, are 
some further names to keep an eye – and an ear – on.HJD

ZZZZ… 
Hopefully we’ll see less of the following in 2017

1 Surprise album drops 
Fine if you’re a megastar; a waste when you’re C Duncan.

2 The X Factor 
Ratings are through the floor and we can’t remember the last five winners. Off 
you pop, Cowell.

3 Hygge 
Sticking on a pair of socks and listening to Laura Marling is not a “state of 
mind”.

4 Kids’ TV reboots 
The tykes have spoken: they like DangerMouse, they’re less into the returns of 
Thunderbirds and Zig & Zag.

5 Cinematic universes 
 Exec-speak for “massive cash-ins”. Zack Snyder can leave the planet, too.

6 Stranger Things’ Barb 
She had about five lines and then she got eaten: stop treating her like she 
was Tony Soprano. GM & MH
