The Golden Globes <https://www.theguardian.com/film/golden-globes> are here 
once again, and with it the futility of trying to figure out who’s going to 
win. Beyond the difficulty and short timespan of all awards forecasting (we’re 
all about to find out who won anyway!), the Hollywood Foreign Press Association 
(HFPA) often zigs exactly when you expect them to zag – Jon Hamm won an award 
in his last year of eligibility after being repeatedly stiffed for Mad Men, 
while Mozart in the Jungle of all things swooped in to take most of 
Transparent’s comedy awards.

Golden Globes 2017: La La Land leads pack with seven nominations

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/12/golden-globes-2017-la-la-land-leads-pack-with-seven-nominations>
This year, there are a few strong contenders, ranging from the one-and-done 
(the excellent FX miniseries The People v OJ Simpson, a bizarre and likely 
singular year of nominations for The Americans) to mainstays like Game of 
Thrones and Transparent to new shows in fresh under the wire, like Westworld, 
Atlanta and This is Us. Single shows rarely run the table in the TV categories, 
and even in the easier to predict acting categories there aren’t many genuine 
stars looking for easy awards gold, so 2017 might be an almost impossible year 
to nail your Golden Globes pool. Anyway, time for some guesses!

Where the best drama Emmy often recognizes more stately, dialogue-heavy dramas 
(ie Mad Men), the Golden Globes generally acknowledge excellence in murder as 
part of their criteria – Homeland, Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire. So British 
royalty drama The Crown and sappy freshman insurgent This is Us are likely out. 
That means Westworld or Stranger Things, both shows that have built a healthy 
amount of buzz on the back of monster and/or robot action. Of those two, 
Stranger Things is the one with the more solid head of steam – it might have 
significant problems, but the prospect of a 1980s pastiche without much in the 
vein of original ideas winning the best drama Golden Globe is so weird and 
frustrating that there’s no way it’s not going to happen. It’s a shame that
Stranger Things <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stranger-things> is 
the show benefiting from that way, since perpetually nominated Game of Thrones 
is coming off its best season in years, finally paying off several seasons of 
character and plot development as it sets up for its bloody endgame. In this 
assembled field, Game of Thrones genuinely does deserve the statue.

Will win: Stranger Things
Should win: Game of Thrones

This is just a bizarre category – Mozart in the Jungle, a show that, somehow, 
won a year after the beginning of the awards deluge for Amazon’s higher 
profile, more dramatic, more relevant Transparent. Between those, Transparent 
seems much more likely to pull out a repeat win (giving a “best comedy” award 
to Mozart in the Jungle is like waking up in bed next to a last-minute Tinder 
date you barely remember meeting), but it’s still not the most deserving 
candidate. Of the nominees, Donald Glover’s Atlanta is by far the most formally 
innovative, and the one that does the most to open new possibilities for the 
form. (Also, unlike many prestige comedies, it has jokes.)

Will win: Transparent

This is a tricky category. In theory, The Night Manager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-night-manager> is exactly the 
sort of show that could, and most likely will, pull out a Golden Globes victory 
– a John Le Carré adaptation featuring some capital-A acting from Hugh Laurie, 
Tom Hiddleston and Olivia Colman. But American Crime has been nominated in the 
past, and The Night Of has John Turturro, Riz Ahmed, and enough of an 
awards-hungry patina that it could pull out an upset. Still, none of these are 
the best thing going in the category. The People v OJ Simpson has the whole 
package: the show’s cast includes several genuine movie stars (including the 
acting nominated John Travolta), a critical perspective on relevant questions 
about media spectacle, race and the criminal justice system, and, best of all, 
it’s genuinely gripping and one of the best TV shows of the last year. There’s 
a chance the HFPA will recoil at all of the Emmys love The People v OJ got, but 
that’s the only thing stopping it from more than justified gold.

Will win: The Night Manager
Should win: The People v OJ Simpson

Unlike the dramatic acting categories, this Golden Globe rarely goes to an 
established person. Instead, it’s a one-time attempted coronation (Tina Fey was 
the last person to repeat win the category), which means past winners Rachel 
Bloom and Gina Rodriguez, who have already gotten the benefit of Globes buzz, 
are likely out of the running. It also seems like HFPA has almost perversely 
set itself up to avoid giving the award to Julia Louis-Dreyfus, perhaps as a 
way of thumbing its nose at her inhuman dominance of the category at the Emmys. 
So, while Tracee Ellis Ross’ prodigious gifts as Rainbow Johnson on Blackish (a 
role that asks her to run the full gamut from put-upon sitcom mom to 
hypercompetent doctor to lost and adrift mixed-race woman) is an admirable long 
shot worth rooting for, Issa Rae will almost certainly win for Insecure.

Will win: Issa Rae
Should win: Tracee Ellis Ross

The HFPA loves rewarding name-brand actors working on shows that are somewhat 
less prestigious – Geena Davis won for the short-lived series Commander in 
Chief –which means this is almost certainly Winona Ryder’s award to lose. (If 
there’s a spoiler on those terms, it’s Evan Rachel Wood on Westworld, which may 
be a bit too recent for the Globes.) It’s too bad that Ryder is going to win. 
She’s a great actor, but the writing on Stranger Things doesn’t actually give 
her all that much to do other than play the aggrieved mother (her best scene 
partner is a tangle of Christmas lights). And Keri Russell, somehow nominated 
for the first time, deserves all of the acting awards in existence (and some 
that aren’t) for her thrilling, emotional, terrifying performance as Elizabeth 
Jennings on The Americans.

Will win: Winona Ryder

This category is often an acknowledgment of the star power of whoever decided 
to appear in a miniseries or TV movie that year (Lady Gaga won last year!) But 
there are a few possibilities in 2017, none of which quite make the cut for an 
obvious winner. There’s Kerry Washington, who has been nominated for both Emmys 
and Golden Globes for Scandal but never won–nominated for playing Anita Hill in 
HBO’s Confirmation. There’s Charlotte Rampling, who could conceivably get the 
nod for appearing in London Spy. And there’s award show bait Sarah Paulson, who 
deserves to win every award, not just the acting ones, and whose performance as 
Marcia Clark might have been the highlight of The People v OJ Simpson, a 
miniseries full of stellar acting. But I’m calling it: the winner is Felicity 
Huffman, for American Crime. Though she was nominated last year, Huffman plays 
a different character on this season of American Crime, and might not suffer 
from her familiarity with the voters. (She also won a Globe for her role in 
Transamerica, so.)

This category has followed best comedy for the past two years, as Jeffrey 
Tambor and then Gael Garcia Bernal took home trophies – and in years before 
that, the award has frequently gone to goofy performances in slightly 
less-acclaimed comedies. (Think Jim Parsons on The Big Bang Theory or, 
inexplicably, Don Cheadle on House of Lies.) Is it too much to hope, then, that 
Bernal and Tambor will lose out to the delightful Anthony Anderson for his work 
on Blackish? Blackish might be a broader series than Transparent, and Anderson 
doesn’t have the star power of fellow nominee Nick Nolte, but his good-natured 
turn as a sitcom dad earnestly and seriously navigating race in America is more 
than deserving of the award. There’s no immediately appealing newcomer who 
fulfills most of the HFPA’s criteria for past winners, but this is an acting 
category where established stars frequently win (Alec Baldwin has several 
trophies from 30 Rock), and Graves airs on Epix, a weird enough outlier that it 
might actually be attractive to the Globes. Nolte seems like a likely winner, 
but we Anthony Anderson fanboys can dream.

Will win: Nick Nolte

Last year, Jon Hamm belatedly won this award for his years as Don Draper on 
Mad Men, but this year’s only long-running nominee is Liev Schreiber – and 
while these predictions strive for accuracy, they will not take into 
consideration the possibility that Ray Donovan could possibly win any awards. 
So instead, the closest thing to Hamm in this field is Bob Odenkirk, overdue 
awards recognition after pulling off the remarkable feat of successfully 
porting the comic relief character of Saul Goodman into a drama. On Better Call 
Saul, the genuinely morally complex, conniving, winning Jimmy McGill has become 
a more compelling protagonist than Walter White ever was.

There’s also a chance Rami Malek will win again for Mr Robot, but the show’s 
second season gave him far less to do, and an award would likely be a belated 
indication that the voters have watched the first season. Instead, the real 
dark horse candidate, and the one who really should win, is Matthew Rhys. 
Odenkirk is deserving of this award, too, but he’ll likely have a few more 
chances to win (and a genuine shot at some Emmys). As Philip Jennings, Rhys has 
to play every single tone The Americans covers, from goofy 1980s suburban 
comedy to spy thriller to marital drama to existential, ideological conflict 
and conspiracy, and moves between them seamlessly. The Americans only has two 
seasons left, and who knows whether or not the HFPA or the Academy will deign 
to nominate them for anything.

Will win: Bob Odenkirk
Should win: Matthew Rhys

The award in this category is going to go to the biggest star: Bryan Cranston 
playing Lyndon Baines Johnson. Nothing screams “Golden Globe” like 
“award-winning actor on niche TV series turned movie star playing a conflicted 
president”, so it feels pretty safe to make this prediction. Sorry John 
Turturro, sorry Riz Ahmed, looks like The Night Of is going to get shut out 
here. Sorry Tom Hiddleston, your relationship with Taylor Swift in conjunction 
with your starring role in The Night Manager didn’t get you the role of James 
Bond, and it isn’t going to get you this Golden Globe. Most importantly, sorry 
Courtney B Vance – you played Johnnie Cochran as a conflicted figure, 
simultaneously a huckster and a committed activist without coming down firmly 
on either side. Courtney, your performance was remarkable, and I’m sorry, but 
it’s still Cranston.

Will win: Bryan Cranston
Should win: Courtney B Vance

The supporting categories are all about standing out (especially since all 
series, miniseries, and TV movies are lumped in together) – so who’s making the 
biggest splash? There are a couple of plausible picks (in particular, Mandy 
Moore could win as a nod of recognition to This is Us), but it seems most 
likely that Thandie Newton will win for playing Maeve, a madam and a robot on 
Westworld – a role that became increasingly prominent and central as the show 
went on, which might play well with the voters. That’s bad news for Lena 
Headey, who, after years playing Cersei Lannister on Game of Thrones, finally 
got the chance to cut loose and do some serious scenery-chewing. The season 
after she had to walk naked around King’s Landing, Cersei found herself a 
zombie knight enforcer, got to literally wear Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 
outfit, and become the evil queen she was always destined to be. It’s been too 
long for any of the actors on Thrones to win awards until the last year they’re 
eligible, but this would’ve been Headey’s year.

Will win: Thandie Newton
Should win: Lena Headey

Playing by last year’s rules, where Christian Slater won in the Globes’ 
primary acknowledgment of Mr Robot, this one is likely going to go to Hugh 
Laurie for The Night Manager – they’re similarly established TV stars making 
slightly off-brand appearances. (Slater likely won’t be repeating.) On the 
other hand, there are two nominees from The People v OJ Simpson, and at least 
one of them has more than a fighting shot, assuming the HFPA doesn’t totally 
shut the miniseries out. More than likely, this would be John Travolta, whose 
arch, drippy performance as Robert Shapiro somehow flew under the radar amidst 
all of the praise the show received, but Sterling K Brown’s understated, 
tightly wound Chris Darden somehow managed to become a romantic hero in a show 
that adamantly refused to have any – he more than deserved his Emmy, and he’d 
deserve this award too.

Will win: Hugh Laurie 
Should win: Sterling K Brown
