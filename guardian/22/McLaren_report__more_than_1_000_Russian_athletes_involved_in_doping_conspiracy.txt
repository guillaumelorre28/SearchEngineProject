That’s all from the press conference in London. Here are the main points from 
part two of the McLaren report into doping in sport:

• More than 1,000 Russian athletes across 30 sports were involved in or 
benefitted from “an institutional conspiracy” of doping. The cover-up, which 
dates back to at least 2011, evolved into a sophisticated doping programme on 
“an unprecedented scale”

• Among a variety of techniques which went to staggering lengths, Russian 
officials added salt and Nescafé coffee granules to urine samples to make them 
match dirty samples and trick testers

• Vitaly Mutko, then-Russian minister for sport and now the deputy prime 
minister, is implicated via his department’s involvement, but there is no 
“direct evidence” that he knew of the doping programme. Vladimir Putin is not 
mentioned in the report

• The corruption at London 2012 will probably never be fully established but 
many Russian athletes who competed in the Games were part of the doping 
programme

• Prof Richard McLaren appeals for major organisations in sport and 
anti-doping to collaborate and “end the in-fighting”

Statement from the International Association of Athletics Federations

The IAAF agrees with Prof. McLaren that it is time that this manipulation 
stops and with this aim has been working in close cooperation with Prof. 
McLaren’s team and WADA and continues to do so. Based on the individual 
athletes that Prof. McLaren’s team have shared with us, over half (53%) of the 
elite athletes have already been sanctioned or are currently undergoing 
disciplinary proceedings. We will follow up on the rest as soon as the evidence 
from the IP’s investigation is made available to us via WADA.

The IAAF has a history of comprehensive testing and a strong retesting 
strategy with samples stored back to 2007. This has allowed us, using 
information shared by the McLaren team, to pursue an even more specific, 
intelligence-based retesting programme. Russian samples from IAAF World 
Championships up to and including Moscow 2013 have been, or are in the process 
of being, reanalysed. At this stage three further samples from Osaka 2007 have 
been reported as Adverse Analytical Findings and results from Daegu 2011 are 
due next week.

In total in 2016, 35 Russian athletes have been sanctioned or charged with an 
ADRV by the IAAF (not counting the meldonium cases).

IAAF President Sebastian Coe commented: “The IAAF has been at the forefront of 
anti-doping since 1928 when we were the first international federation to 
prohibit doping in sport. We will continue to test intelligently, retest 
smartly, work collaboratively and seek swift justice. The independent Athletics 
Integrity Unit launching in April 2017 will give us, and clean athletes the 
world over, the strongest platform possible to deliver this.”

McLaren’s final comments defend, to some degree, London 2012’s supposedly 
high-tech doping laboratory. “I don’t think that London didn’t test properly. 
What’s happened is that the ability to test certain substances has been 
refined, and that’s what has shown up in the retesting.”

The final question is a passionate plea for McLaren to offer some hope for 
fans’ faith in sport. “A number of people have been deceived – competitors and 
fans have been cheated – but I don’t think that what’s going on here is going 
on around the world.”

McLaren is asked about doping in football, of which more than 30 instances 
have been referenced in the report. He gives little detail, saying that 
decisions will have to be made by those football organisations who have sent 
the evidence.

International Paralympic Committee statement

The full findings of the report are unprecedented and astonishing. They strike 
right at the heart of the integrity and ethics of sport.

We wholeheartedly agree with Professor McLaren that the best course of action 
is to work together to fix the broken and compromised anti-doping system in 
Russia.

The recently appointed IPC Taskforce looks forward to working closely with our 
member the Russian Paralympic Committee to do just that.

Evidence has been distributed to Wada, McLaren says, and it is not up to him 
to make sporting decisions – like whether medals may be taken away from Russian 
athletes involved.

McLaren is asked about Vitaly Mutko, who was the head of Russia’s ministry for 
sport between 2008 and October 2016, when he was promoted to deputy prime 
minister. Mutko has been implicated in the scandal by the report and McLaren 
says he is not surprised that the politician has not taken responsibility for 
the doping programme. However, he clarifies that there is no “direct evidence” 
that Mutko knew about the doping programme. McLaren has met with Mutko, he 
says, who denied any knowledge of corruption.

McLaren says: “The Russian Olympic team corrupted the London Games on an 
unprecedented scale.” He does not believe the full extent of the cover-up will 
ever be known. “The picture is clear, but it is not complete. We’ve only had 
access to a small fraction of the evidence possible to examine.”

pressure to punish Russia. Out of 2017 Pyeongchang winter Games?

McLaren describes the cover-up of Russian doping as “an institutional 
conspiracy”. 

He adds: “Athletes who participated with Russian officials ... for the 
purposes of manipulating doping controls were acting not individually but 
within an organised infrastructure.”

Part one

The original report, published on 18 July 2016, revealed made a number of 
damning revelations. Of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, it uncovered: “The 
Sochi Laboratory operated a unique sample-swapping methodology to enable doped 
Russian athletes to compete at the Games.” The investigation found that tainted 
samples from Russian athletes were passed through a ‘mouse hole’ inside the 
Sochi laboratory to Russian security service personnel and anti-doping staff.

That’s all from the press conference in London. Here are the main points from 
part two of the McLaren report into doping in sport:

• More than 1,000 Russian athletes across 30 sports were involved in or 
benefitted from “an institutional conspiracy” of doping. The cover-up, which 
dates back to at least 2011, evolved into a sophisticated doping programme on 
“an unprecedented scale”

• Among a variety of techniques which went to staggering lengths, Russian 
officials added salt and Nescafé coffee granules to urine samples to make them 
match dirty samples and trick testers

• Vitaly Mutko, then-Russian minister for sport and now the deputy prime 
minister, is implicated via his department’s involvement, but there is no 
“direct evidence” that he knew of the doping programme. Vladimir Putin is not 
mentioned in the report

• The corruption at London 2012 will probably never be fully established but 
many Russian athletes who competed in the Games were part of the doping 
programme

• Prof Richard McLaren appeals for major organisations in sport and 
anti-doping to collaborate and “end the in-fighting”

And you can read Sean Ingle’s story here:

More than 1,000 Russian athletes benefited from state-sponsored doping
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/09/more-than-1000-russian-athletes-benefitted-from-state-sponsored-doping> 
The IAAF agrees with Prof. McLaren that it is time that this manipulation 
stops and with this aim has been working in close cooperation with Prof. 
McLaren’s team and WADA and continues to do so. Based on the individual 
athletes that Prof. McLaren’s team have shared with us, over half (53%) of the 
elite athletes have already been sanctioned or are currently undergoing 
disciplinary proceedings. We will follow up on the rest as soon as the evidence 
from the IP’s investigation is made available to us via WADA.

The IAAF has a history of comprehensive testing and a strong retesting 
strategy with samples stored back to 2007. This has allowed us, using 
information shared by the McLaren team, to pursue an even more specific, 
intelligence-based retesting programme. Russian samples from IAAF World 
Championships up to and including Moscow 2013 have been, or are in the process 
of being, reanalysed. At this stage three further samples from Osaka 2007 have 
been reported as Adverse Analytical Findings and results from Daegu 2011 are 
due next week.

In total in 2016, 35 Russian athletes have been sanctioned or charged with an 
ADRV by the IAAF (not counting the meldonium cases).

IAAF President Sebastian Coe commented: “The IAAF has been at the forefront of 
anti-doping since 1928 when we were the first international federation to 
prohibit doping in sport. We will continue to test intelligently, retest 
smartly, work collaboratively and seek swift justice. The independent Athletics 
Integrity Unit launching in April 2017 will give us, and clean athletes the 
world over, the strongest platform possible to deliver this.”
 
McLaren’s final comments defend, to some degree, London 2012’s supposedly 
high-tech doping laboratory. “I don’t think that London didn’t test properly. 
What’s happened is that the ability to test certain substances has been 
refined, and that’s what has shown up in the retesting.”
 
The final question is a passionate plea for McLaren to offer some hope for 
fans’ faith in sport. “A number of people have been deceived – competitors and 
fans have been cheated – but I don’t think that what’s going on here is going 
on around the world.”
 
McLaren is asked about doping in football, of which more than 30 instances 
have been referenced in the report. He gives little detail, saying that 
decisions will have to be made by those football organisations who have sent 
the evidence.
 
The full findings of the report are unprecedented and astonishing. They strike 
right at the heart of the integrity and ethics of sport.

We wholeheartedly agree with Professor McLaren that the best course of action 
is to work together to fix the broken and compromised anti-doping system in 
Russia.

The recently appointed IPC Taskforce looks forward to working closely with our 
member the Russian Paralympic Committee to do just that.
 
Our own Sean Ingle asks whether the 1,000+ names of Russian athletes involved 
will be revealed. “It has not been put in the public domain. That will be up to 
sports federations who have received the information.” McLaren adds that he has 
not examined other countries’ actions, butWada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wada> are making enquiries. McLaren says it 
was not his task to investigate anywhere beyond Russia.
 
McLaren says he has no opinion regarding the Fifa World Cup, which Russia is 
due to host in 2018.
 
Evidence has been distributed to Wada, McLaren says, and it is not up to him 
to make sporting decisions – like whether medals may be taken away from Russian 
athletes involved.
 
McLaren is asked about Vitaly Mutko, who was the head of Russia’s ministry for 
sport between 2008 and October 2016, when he was promoted to deputy prime 
minister. Mutko has been implicated in the scandal by the report and McLaren 
says he is not surprised that the politician has not taken responsibility for 
the doping programme. However, he clarifies that there is no “direct evidence” 
that Mutko knew about the doping programme. McLaren has met with Mutko, he 
says, who denied any knowledge of corruption.
 Russia backed doping on ‘unprecedented scale’, says second McLaren report – 
video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/dec/09/russian-state-sponsored-doping-unprecedented-scale-mclaren-second-report-video> 
McLaren is asked if Russia should be banned from future major events. “It’s 
not for me to decide if they should compete at the next Olympics,” he responds.
 
McLaren is wrapping up his statement and will take some questions. First he 
gives a call for the various bodies involved to “move forward together” and end 
the “in-fighting”.
 
Prof Richard McLaren: “It is impossible to know how far back the conspiracy 
goes. Sports fans and spectators have been deceived. It’s time that stops. Yes, 
stops.”
 
The lengths Russian officials went to to manipulate samples and hide their 
extraordinary doping programme are staggering.
Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
Obviously we're becoming inured to all this but scale of Russian cheating and 
cover up still pretty jaw dropping.
 <https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/807189117566152704> December 9, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/owen_g/status/807189117566152704>  
Retesting urine samples previously covered up by Russian officials found among 
many discoveries: “Two female hockey players’ samples contained male DNA ... 
and eight Sochi samples revealed salt content not physically possible in a 
healthy human.”
 
McLaren is detailing the extraordinary lengths Russian officials went to to 
hide or manipulate urine samples. He says they used salt and “Nescafé coffee 
granules” to trick testers.
 
McLaren says: “The Russian Olympic team corrupted the London Games on an 
unprecedented scale.” He does not believe the full extent of the cover-up will 
ever be known. “The picture is clear, but it is not complete. We’ve only had 
access to a small fraction of the evidence possible to examine.”
 
The report directly implicates Vitaly Mutko, who was promoted by Vladimir 
Putin to Russian deputy prime minister in October. Putin is not mentioned in 
the report.

allowed [participating Russian athletes] to compete while doping. Well-known

Roan is referring to the 2018 Winter Olympics – from which Russia could be now 
be banned.
 
McLaren: “This process [of state-sponsored doping] evolved and was refined at 
London 2012, the summer University Games at 2013, the Moscow IAAF World 
Championships in 2013 and of course Sochi 2014.”
 
McLaren describes the cover-up of Russian doping as “an institutional 
conspiracy”. 

He adds: “Athletes who participated with Russian officials ... for the 
purposes of manipulating doping controls were acting not individually but 
within an organised infrastructure.”
 
Prof Richard McLaren: “We are now able to confirm the findings of the first 
report: a cover up that dates back to at least 2011 and continued after the 
Sochi Winter Olympics games. A cover up that has evolved ... and operated on an 
unprecedented scale.”
 
More than 1,000 Russian athletes across 30 sports – including football – were 
involved in or benefitted from state-sponsored doping between 2011 and 2015, it 
has been revealed.

Part one

The original report, published on 18 July 2016, revealed made a number of 
damning revelations. Of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, it uncovered: “The 
Sochi Laboratory operated a unique sample-swapping methodology to enable doped 
Russian athletes to compete at the Games.” The investigation found that tainted 
samples from Russian athletes were passed through a ‘mouse hole’ inside the 
Sochi laboratory to Russian security service personnel and anti-doping staff.
