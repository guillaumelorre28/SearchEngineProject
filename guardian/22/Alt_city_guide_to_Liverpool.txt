For decades, Liverpool has experimented with every international trend, using 
each one in a cool, discriminating way to create distinctively Liverpudlian 
art. Think of the Beat-influenced poets of the 1960s or the psychedelic music 
lineage that links Echo & the Bunnymen to the Coral to the annual Psych Fest. 
Moreover, for all its pride in its edgy art galleries (Fact 
<http://www.fact.co.uk/>, Open Eye <http://openeye.org.uk/>, Bluecoat 
<http://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/>), the city has retained its working-class 
sensibility. Camp & Furnace, arguably Liverpool’s hippest venue, still shows 
televised football – that does not happen in other cities.

Given how economically straitened it has been, DIY culture is strong in 
Liverpool. The art world bubbles with grassroots activity, such as exhibition 
space the Trophy Room or feminist zineQueen of the Track 
<http://queenofthetrackzine.tumblr.com/>. Musically, the city is in rude, 
self-perpetuating health. It has not just the bands (Minnetonka 
<https://www.facebook.com/minnetonka2/>, Strange Collective 
<https://www.facebook.com/strangecollective/>, Ohmns 
<https://www.facebook.com/ohmnsuk>, the Floormen 
<https://www.facebook.com/TheFloormen/>), but the infrastructure, too: niche 
labels (Blak Hand, Hail Hail), record shops (Probe, Dig Vinyl), independent 
promoters (Evol, Harvest Sun). On the clubbing front, look out for electronic 
music nights fromMein Nacht <https://www.facebook.com/meinenacht.tv/>, Abandon

.

“Liverpool’s the perfect oasis of risk-takers and supporters, and it’s 
thriving,” says David Williams, co-creator ofindependent-liverpool.co.uk 
<http://independent-liverpool.co.uk/> – although, some caveat that enthusiasm 
with a warning. Where once cheap space was plentiful in the run-down city 
centre (Bold Street 
<http://www.visitliverpool.com/things-to-do/shopping/bold-street-p16794> is an 
unusual enclave of independent businesses), Liverpool is changing. Money and 
developers are pouring in and leftfield venues Mello Mello and theKazimier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/08/liverpool-venue-the-kazimier-to-close-its-doors-in-2016>
 have been lost. Abandon Silence promoter Andrew Hill fears for theBaltic 
Triangle <http://www.baltictriangle.co.uk/>, a gritty industrial zone now home 
to many ad hoc bars and creative late-night warehouse spaces. “Six years ago, 
there was nothing here,” he says. “Now it’s a sea of cranes and high-rises.”

The North Docks, where the Kazimier has re-emerged as art-rave space the 
Invisible Wind Factory <https://www.facebook.com/invisiblewindfactory/>, (its 
neighbours include venuesDrop the Dumbulls 
<https://www.facebook.com/DropTheDumbulls/> and North Shore Troubadour 
<https://www.facebook.com/NorthShoreTroubadour/>), is where creatives are 
moving to escape rising property prices and residential noise restrictions. The 
author Kevin Sampson is enjoying this colonisation of areas outside the 
sometimes lairy city centre. “You can put a mini-crawl together around the 
Baltic Triangle,” he promises, “without ever encountering a comedy penis.”

Created by the team behind the old Kazimier club (bulldozed for apartments, 
sadly), IWF is a cavernous warehouse rave/gig venue where the work of its 
in-house art collective – which creates spectacular theatrical productions such 
as its recentOmphalos – informs the whole experience. “It’s an immersive 
cocoon, one constantly changing in terms of visual aspects and art 
installations,” says Evol promoter Steve Miller, who has IWF shows imminent with
Fucked Up and Peaches. IWF is busy by day, too. It houses artists’ studios, a 
café and electronics, metal and woodworking units used by artist-makers across 
Liverpool.

Camp & Furnace

A key venue in the Baltic Triangle’s transformation into a hub of creativity 
and late-night larks, this bar-restaurant and vast events space (along the 
lines of a hipster Alpine lodge with a warehouse attached) rattles through a 
bewildering array of events each week. From off-the-wall bingo nights via 
bassbin-busting club events to the new audio-visual dining extravaganza 
Nightgarden, which will launch on 14 October with guest chefMary-Ellen McTague 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mary-ellen-mctague>. Nearby, keep an eye 
on the similarly unpredictable Constellations (constellations-liv.com

Maguire’s Pizza Bar

No prizes for guessing what Maguire’s majors in but its back room is also a 
gig space. “It’s the embodiment of ‘no frills’, the perfect sweatbox for a 
noisy garage rock party,” says Christopher Torpey, editor of music mag Bido 
Lito! “And, yes, the pizza is ace.”

EBGBS

Heebie Jeebies (Heebies to its regulars) is a boozy late bar and courtyard, 
where the sounds range from acoustic acts to pumping house. Its basement 
gig/club space (home of indie institution Liquidation), has recently been given 
a makeover as EBGBS in neon, graffiti and rock ‘n’ roll cocktails. It looks, 
says Steve Miller, “like it did in 2003 when I was doing gigs there with Weird 
War and Fat Truckers”.

Many liken Kitchen Street to the Kazimier. Similarly, it is an ever-evolving 
venue with a dedicated underground music policy. Forthcoming visitors include 
industrial techno dons Perc & Truss and Vancouver house classicists Pender 
Street Steppers. “It’s a really good, 250-capacity warehouse space, which 
they’ve built organically,” says Andrew Hill.

DRINK

Dead Crafty
 Dead Crafty, Liverpool. 
Liverpool’s vibrant craft beer scene takes in both traditional pubs (see the 
nearby Ship & Mitre) and hip bars such as this 20-tap extravaganza. From 
obscure sharing bottles to local ales (Ad Hop, Mad Hatter) all beer life is 
here. “It’s run by two enthusiasts who spent years making brewery connections, 
so they’d have good stuff on – like Cloudwater beers on release day,” says Paul 
Sieffert, co-founder of Liverpool Craft Beer Co.

Kazimier Garden

The Kazimier has gone but its ramshackle beer garden remains as a glorious 
two-fingers to bland gentrification. Expect interesting, off-beam DJ events, 
good craft beers, top BBQ and lots of mulled drinks in winter. “You’d never 
know it’s there, it looks completely abandoned and, once you’re in, you feel 
like you’re part of something special,” says David Williams.

23 Club

Located in the dark, spartan basement of the Clove Hitch restaurant, 23 
specialises in three modern obsessions: bourbon, burgers, craft beer. Its 19 
cask/keg lines showcase the best of British (Magic Rock, Tiny Rebel, Kernel et 
al), while its extensive bottle stock goes all-out internationally. Come, 
drink, geek out.

Berry & Rye
 Berry & Rye, Liverpool. 
Hidden behind an empty shop front, this “speakeasy” is genuinely difficult to 
find (“Even now you see people knocking on the wrong door or asking, ‘are you 
sure it’s here?’,” says Williams), while its dimly lit interior intensifies the 
feeling that this is a bolthole from the raucousness outside. Williams: “The 
drinks are some of the best you’ll have. I’ve ordered them all around the world 
but there’s nothing quite like Berry & Rye’s Old Fashioned.”

Black Lodge 
 Black Lodge, Liverpool. 
A collaborative project from founders of Liverpool Craft Beer Co, 23 Club and 
Camp & Furnace, this new experimental brewery-tap is something special. A 
Baltic Triangle warehouse space, it is open Thursday to Sunday with the Lodge’s 
out-there, highly limited brews (salt-licked gose beers; traditional Finnish 
sahti etc.), adding intrigue to its 13-tap selection.

FOOD

Ital Fresh

That Rastafarianism has its own vegan tradition (adherents follow an “ital” 
diet) may have passed you by, but Ital Fresh’s unusually vibrant street food is 
not to be missed. Try the smoothly hot, satisfyingly savoury jerk mushrooms 
with garlic-thyme kale and remarkably creamy quinoa. Food is available on 
Tuesday and Wednesday lunchtimes and until late on Thursdays at 61 New Bird 
Street, another quirky Baltic Triangle warehouse gaff.
• Dishes £4-£7.50. 61 New Bird Street, italfreshHQ.com 
<http://www.italfreshhq.com/>

Roja Pinchos

A little corner of the Basque Country on Berry Street, this simple restaurant 
(decked out in chipboard with a stark red and white colour scheme) serves 
creditable pinchos, the elaborate skewered snacks. Thechistorra (punchy, tiny 
chorizo) with fried quail egg and aioli, or the lomo pork, heady with a grilled 
BBQ tang, are recommended.
• Pinchos £1.50-£3.50. Berry Street, 0151 378 9563, rojapinchos.co.uk 
<http://rojapinchos.co.uk/>

Buyers’ Club
 Buyer’s Club, Liverpool 
Upstairs, a 300-capacity gig space (where you’ll find local bands, foodbank 
fundraisers, record fairs) retains a little of the spirit of the Picket, the 
trades union-backed venue that used to occupy this building. Downstairs, 
however, across a surprisingly slick bar and restaurant, it is chef Dan Heffy’s 
small plates (marinated, salt-crusted beef with chickpea purée, yoghurt, herb 
oil) that are forging the Buyers’ Club’s reputation. “It’s got a great 
selection of ales, whiskies and the now-obligatory posh gins,” says Kevin 
Sampson. “The food is very good.”
• Plates £6-£9. 24 Hardman Street, 0151 709 2400, buyers-club.co.uk

Etsu
 Etsu, Liverpool. 
Tucked into the unpromising concrete and glass edifice of Beetham Plaza, Etsu 
serves Japanese food which sings with clean, true flavours. The lunchtime bento 
boxes are good value (excellent pickles and sauces) while the wider menu runs 
the gamut from crowd-pleasers like panko-crumbed tonkatsu pork to specials such 
as a boiled shrimp shredded daikon salad with sesame, miso and avocado sauce.

Essentially in its drinks (serious, Iberian-style G&Ts, Aperol spritz, etc) 
and itsOttolenghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes>-ish 
small plates, Maray is channelling the best fashionable food trends. “It’s 
incredible,” coos Williams. “You’ll see three or four ingredients on the plate 
and think, ‘how on earth will that be nice?’. I had one the other day – green 
beans, tahini, strawberries, feta, almonds – it was one of the most amazing 
things I’ve ever eaten.”

CULTURE

The Royal Standard
 Royal Standard, Liverpool. 
For a decade, artist-led The Royal Standard has been the whetstone on which 
the young blades of Liverpool’s art scene have sharpened their cutting edge. A 
labyrinth of cheap studio, exhibition and project space for cohabitees such as 
Cactus (cactusgallery.co.uk <http://cactusgallery.co.uk/>) and Muesli (
muesliprojects.co.uk <http://muesliprojects.co.uk/>), this is where 
experimental art flourishes. Currently on an industrial estate north of the 
city centre, TRS is about to move to a new art hub in the oldCains Brewery 
<http://www.cains.co.uk/> (occupied by the Liverpool Biennal until 16 October, 
biennial.com <http://www.biennial.com/>). “It’ll be really exciting to see how 
this changes the organisation,” says Lauren Velvick, programme co-ordinator at
the Bluecoat <http://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/>, which is currently showing 
Dennis McNulty’s Homo Gestalt.

Crown Building Studios

This former magistrate’s court is a hive of innovative cultural activity. It 
includes the politically charged arthouse Small Cinema (
liverpoolsmallcinema.org.uk <http://liverpoolsmallcinema.org.uk/>) and the 
Crown Building Studios’ gallery, which exhibits new art from recent graduates 
(during exhibitions, Sat/Sun, midday-4pm). Next door, A Particular Act (

performance in an art setting.

News From Nowhere

For almost 40 years, the bookshop News From Nowhere (a non-profit co-op) has 
been keeping Liverpool informed politically. It also sells amusing lefty mugs 
and T-shirts as light relief from all that Chomsky. “It’s not just a bookshop 
but an evergreen source of info and ideas for political and cultural events in 
the city,” says Sampson. The building also houses theNext To Nowhere 
<http://www.liverpoolsocialcentre.org/> social centre, which hosts punk gigs 
and, on Saturdays, a vegan café.

The Serving Library

From record covers to Ouija boards, the Serving Library is a collection of 
objects that have inspired philosophical essays published over many years in 
print and online. Eighty of its pieces are now displayed in this 
curiosity-shop-archive (open irregularly or by appointment). “There have been 
some really interesting, low-key talks hosted there,” says Velvick, who, for 
more in marginal art activity, recommends galleries A Small View, which, he 
says, is “like entering a time-warp” (asmallview.co.uk 
<http://asmallview.co.uk/>) and the Trophy Room (thetrophyroom.org 
<http://www.thetrophyroom.org/>).

Homotopia

“There’s an interesting crossover between the LGBT/queer and art scenes in 
Liverpool,” says Velvick, which peaks during November’s Homotopia, an annual 
arts festival. This year’s programme encompasses everything from the Walker 
Gallery exhibition Transformation: One Man’s Cross-Dressing Wardrobe to, at the 
Unity Theatre, an evening of caustic, political cabaret with the incendiary
