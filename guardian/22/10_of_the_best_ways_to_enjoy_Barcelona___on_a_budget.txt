Take in the view

Barcelona street life is irresistible, but sometimes you want to rise above 
the crowds. A ride in thecable car across the harbour is great but expensive 
<http://www.telefericodebarcelona.com/en> (single ticket €11). You’ll get an 
even better view from the cocktail bar at the top of the waterfrontW hotel 
<http://www.w-barcelona.com/>. You do not even need to have a (pricey) drink, 
but the people-watching makes it worth it. I think the best view in Barcelona 
is also probably its least well known.El Turó de la Rovira 
<http://museuhistoria.bcn.cat/en/node/662> (free) is a civil war gun 
emplacement on a hill near Park Güell and once you’ve recovered from the climb 
you can look out across the city to the sea, up the coast towards France and 
back to the Pyrenees. The rooftop tour of the beautiful church ofSanta Maria 
del Mar <http://www.santamariadelmarbarcelona.org/home/> costs €8 but gives you 
a fascinating insight into its construction and a unique view across the 
rooftops of the tightly packed streets of the Born district.

Vermuts musicals
 Gran Bodega Saltó, ‘the grandaddy of vermuts musicals’ 
Catalan vermut, a fortified wine spiced with herbs, is vermouth’s 
down-and-dirty cousin. It fell out of fashion 50 years ago but is now making a 
remarkable comeback and vermuterías are some of the city’s trendiest drinking 
spots (even the Adrià brothers of El Bullí fame have opened one:Bodega 1900 
<http://en.bcn50.org/>). Vermut was traditionally drunk after mass and before a 
late Sunday lunch but it took the revival to add that extra ingredient for a 
supremely relaxed weekend afternoon - free live music, and so vermuts musicals 
were invented. You’ll find them all over town on Sundays – and often Saturdays 
– but the district of Poble Sec, a 10-minute walk from the Ramblas, with its 
mix of old-fashioned drinking holes and fashionable hangouts should see you 
right.

Gran Bodega Saltó <http://bodegasalto.net/> is the grandaddy of vermuts 
musicals. The crowd watching the acoustic performers often spills out from its 
kitsch interior on to the street. Free, but a donation of a bottle of olive oil 
for a charity helping the poor locally is requested – there’s a supermarket 
nearby. Try also vermut and DJs atOlivia Vermutería 
<https://www.facebook.com/Olivia.Vermuteria> and Bar Rufián 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bar-Rufi%C3%A1n/615875588556483>. Poble Sec’s 
raucous festival runs from 18-26 July if you need another excuse to visit the 
barrio.

 At the Ús Barcelona event a whole street is transformed by artists over a 
weekend in May 
The still-gritty Raval district, just off the Ramblas, is the colourful hub of 
the city’s urban culture. Any available surface is fair game for anything from 
stickers to stencils and flyers to murals. You’ll find plenty of examples just 
by wandering the streets or join a tour such as the highly-ratedBarcelona 
Street Style Tour <http://barcelonastreetstyletour.com/> (free, donation 
requested). Sunday is a good day to explore because shop shutters, the canvas 
for many an enthusiastic artist, are down. The former industrial barrio of 
Poblenou, just beyond Port Olímpic, is another hotspot. Its innumerable 
warehouses are fast being turned into fashionable lofts but there are still 
lots of unloved buildings to go at. For the last couple of years it’s been the 
setting forÚs Barcelona <http://usbarcelona.com/> (see a video of the 2015 
event atvimeo.com <https://vimeo.com/132342495>), where a whole street, 
including parked cars, is transformed by artists over a weekend in May. Food 
vans, DJs and bands add to the fun.

 the newly opened Teatro hostel 
New five-star hotels pop up in Barcelona with alarming regularity. But there 
are still plenty of great choices even if you’re not Pippa Middleton. The 
Praktik chain of hotels is fab. Simple, affordable rooms in wonderful 
locations, with a bit of glamour thrown in. Its latest,Praktik Vinoteca 
<http://www.hotelpraktikvinoteca.com/> (doubles from €79, room-only), has a 
reception hall lined with thousands of bottles of wine, all for sale. Free 
tastings are held on the pretty terrace and bodega tours are organised. It’s in 
the Eixample area, minutes from the posh shops on Passeig de Gràcia and some of 
Gaudí’s most famous buildings. Newly openedTeatro hostel 
<http://teatrohostel.com/> in Poble-sec (dorm beds from €13) is good fun. It’s 
stuffed full of theatrical props and fabrics, the dorms are comfortable and the 
highly-experienced owner really knows how to look after travellers.

Open-air cinema is a summer tradition in the city. The screenings on Montjuïc 
hill <http://salamontjuic.org/es/> (until 7 August, tickets from €6), in the 
shadow of the castle, are now in their 13th year. The programme is always a 
crowd-pleaser and this year includes The Big Lebowski, Reservoir Dogs and 
Moulin Rouge (all subtitled into Spanish). But you don’t have to schlep all the 
way up the hill to get your film fix this year.Cinema Lliure a la Platja 
<http://www.cinemalliure.com/> is on the beach, runs until 16 August and is 
free. Its programme is more eclectic but looks fascinating. Foreign films are 
subtitled into Spanish; Spanish films have English subtitles. If you don’t want 
sand in your popcorn, then films fromMecal <http://mecalbcn.org/?lang=en> – the 
International Festival of Short Films and Animation of Barcelona – will be 
screened outdoors all summer atPoble Espanyol

 Encants market is in a fabulous, new semi-enclosed building. Photograph: Alamy 
The stunning new Museu del Disseny <http://www.museudeldisseny.cat/en> (€5) 
puts on one site several museums that had been spread across the city. A whole 
floor is devoted to its fashion collection, giving you an idea of what the 
Kardashians of the 18th and 19th centuries would have been wearing. You’ll also 
find floors of examples of textiles, decorative arts, product design and 
graphic art. The city council is pouring investment into this part of town, 
Glòries. One of Barcelona’s most interesting, eclectic and downright bizarre 
markets,Encants <http://encantsbcn.com/en> (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday 
9am-8pm), is in a fabulous, new semi-enclosed building. Browse stalls selling 
everything from antique mirrors and obscure garden tools to boxes of vinyl 
records and fake-fur jackets under a spectacular giant copper-coloured 
reflective roof. There’s a tempting set of food stands on the top floor where 
you can sit and wonder what to do with that stuffed bear you’ve just bought.

 Ciutadella park. Photograph: Alamy 
Barcelona’s not a city of big parks: blame the medieval walls that kept people 
crammed together, and then developers in the 19th century who screwed with the 
open areas planned for the new town, the Eixample. So grab a bit of space when 
you can. Ciutadella park, just beyond the Born district, has plenty of grass, 
shade, spectacular fountains and some prime examples of modernisme buildings. A 
little known green, yellow, orange, pink and red gem is theParc de Cervantes 
<http://www.barcelonaturisme.com/wv3/%20en/page/526/.html> rose garden (free) 
in Pedralbes, which has nearly 250 varieties and lots of quiet corners for 
lounging.Parc de Laberint 
<http://www.barcelonaturisme.com/wv3/en/page/547/parc-del-laberint.html> 
(free), once the estate of an aristo, is the city’s oldest garden, with 
waterfalls, streams, canals and ponds. But the clue to its big appeal lies in 
its name: a beautiful maze of two-metre-high hedges. Can you find “love”, a 
statue of Cupid, at its heart?

Royale with queso
 Sagàs 
Food trends sweep through Barcelona faster than a pickpocket down the Ramblas. 
And often they’re just as welcome. Burgers are big, very big but not in a 
“supersize me” sort of way. I likeSagàs <http://www.sagaspagesosicuiners.com/> 
on the edge of the Born. It has a more seriously foodie place (Els Casals 
<http://elscasals.cat/>) towards the Pyrenees but here it’s kept simple and 
delicious, using the meat produced there. A burger’s about €8 but worth every 
penny.Bacoa <http://www.bacoa.es/en/> is a small chain dedicated to all things 
griddled and stuck between pieces of bread. Kiosko (Avenida del Marquès de 
l’Argentera) in the Born is my favourite – expect to pay about €6.Timesburg 
<http://www.timesburg.com/en/> (burger around €6) in Poblenou is as trendy as 
its postcode but worth the trek. For more good-value food, that’s a bit more 
traditional, read my recent guide to menús del día

 Nova Icària beach. Photograph: Marco Cristofori/Alamy 
Famously, the Barcelonins only discovered the beach after the 1992 Olympics, 
but long days on the platja are now an essential part of summer. It pays to 
choose your bit of beach with care. As with most of Catalan life there’s a 
strict, unspoken system – try jumping the queue at the chicken and rabbit stand 
in the market to test this. So, each stretch of sand has its own character: the 
beach in the shadow of the W hotel has an unofficial nudist area; Barceloneta 
is always noisy and crowded, with the young (taking selfies) and the old 
(playing dominoes); Mar Bella is popular with gays and lesbians, and has an 
official nudist part; families like the slightly less busy Nova Icària. There’s 
a massive choice of beach bars and restaurants all along here, too.

 Barcelona metro. Photograph: Juergen Stumpe/Getty Images/LOOK 
Tourists can’t use the city’s community bike scheme (cycle hire firms threw a 
wobbly at the threat to their profits) and haring around on a Segway scaring 
grannies and small dogs won’t win you any friends. Thankfully Barcelona’s 
public transport system puts many a city to shame. A single ticket costs €2.15 
but only aguiri (foreigner) does that. A T10 ticket costs €9.95 and gets you 10 
journeys on the metro, bus, tram and local train within zone 1 (pretty much 
anywhere 99% of tourists would venture). Do the math! It can be shared by 
different people, lasts up to a year and can be picked up at metro stations. It 
is also available at the airport train station making the journey into town 
(stops at Sants and Passeig de Gràcia stations) an absolute steal (a single 
ticket is €4.10). The T10 can be used on more than one type of transport and 
all count as a single journey as long as your journey is less than 75 minutes. 
So you can hop across town by tube, bus and tram for less than a euro.
