There are three of us in my marriage: me, Dave and a Canyon Ultimate CF SLX. 
As bikes go, it’s a fine specimen, but it has been monopolising my husband’s 
downtime for years. And joining him – or them – is not an option. I might 
manage a cycling trip to the Netherlands or the Somerset Levels, but Dave is 
drawn to pro-cycling terrain: insanely steep climbs and buttock-clenching 
descents. He does Geneva-to-Nice-in-a-week kind of cycling, followed by long 
conversations about gradients, power outputs and lactate thresholds. I love a 
good mountain myself, but I prefer to look at them – as part of a more 
sybaritic holiday, with sightseeing and occasional walks. So, we have arrived 
at a compromise: he packs inner tubes, heart-rate monitors and a ton of Lycra 
bib shorts; I take walking boots, sun cream and a pile of good books. The 
Canyon Ultimate comes along for the ride. And we head for hillside hotels that 
somehow manage to suit us all.

Only five miles from the centre of Granada, this classy little hotel sits in 
tumbling gardens tucked into a vertiginous hillside, with dreamy views across 
the Monachil valley and the slopes of the Sierra Nevada national park. While 
cyclists explore the local hairpin bends (including a punishing 11-mile climb 
to a ski resort at the top of the Sierra Nevada), there’s a pool to lounge by, 
under a fig tree on the lawn, or in a deckchair on the terrace outside the 
glass-cube rooms. It’s worth wandering to Monachil (the steep walk back is 
almost as challenging as cycling up a mountain) before watching the sunset, 
over an Andalusian dinner on the hotel terrace.

Among almond and olive trees in the Xalo valley, half an hour from the coast, 
this chilledcasa rural is home to Nicky Scott (she is, indeed, Scottish) and 
her Valenciano partner, Pep. A keen cyclist, Pep is happy to escort cyclists up 
the Coll de Rates, one of the many passes that zig-zag up the Marina Alta 
mountains on local routes familiar to Vuelta a Espana pros. There are mountain 
views from the pool, chickens in the kitchen garden or Xaló’s market square to 
explore. Aside from six boutique rooms, the hotel also offers spa treatments in 
a garden gazebo and live music and tapas nights on the terrace.

In tiny Petroio, this hotel, named after a Tuscan saint, has 11 charming rooms 
(named after Renaissance artists) with hilly views and faux medieval decor 
(wrought iron, damasks and hand-painted frescoes). There’s lots to do: Siena is 
half an hour away, Petroio itself is a gem (the former capital of terracotta, 
it has a pottery museum and one bar), and the hotel’s restaurant is sublime 
(homemade pigeon ravioli served on the vine-clad terrace with a bottle of 
Montepulciano’s finest). There are occasional cookery classes and wine tours. 
For the cyclist, the roads around Petroio are empty and occasionally 
challenging, including the route to Monte Amiata, a 27km climb above Tuscany’s 
Val d’Orcia.

The rooms are nothing to shout about, but this farmhouse hotel has lush, 
flowery gardens, a small but decent pool and superb views of Mont Ventoux. The 
“Giant of Provence” is one of the most feared and celebrated Tour de France 
climbs (it begins stage 12 of this year’s tour, on 14 July). However, Ventoux 
is the only mountain for miles, so there are some easy-to-moderate pedalling 
routes – around vineyard villages, cherry orchards and fields of lavender. The 
foot of Ventoux is 10 miles away; the town of Bedoin two miles (walkable), and 
there are a couple of excellent restaurants just across the road from La 
Garance. On fine days you can breakfast in the garden – with all the other 
cyclists.

The Pyrenean peaks are visible from this campsite-trailer park – a collection 
of vintage American caravans in a field with a solar-powered shower-block, a 
wrecked red Routemaster bus, Lucy’s Diner and the Apollo Lounge (an Airstream 
under a silver awning). While the cyclists set off for the said mountains, the 
less active can relax in an original 1960s sun lounger, or stare at sheep, or 
chill in a 1968 Streamadelic Overlander, admiring the fairy lights and the 
groovy night-club decor. Medieval Carcassonne is close by. Lovely Mirepoix even 
closer. This year’s Tour de France will be whizzing through both towns on July 
12 and 13.

It’s hard to think of a prettier house or a more charming host 
(Marie-Christine offers the warmest of welcomes on arrival). There are four 
gorgeous rooms, with lavish bathrooms and views of the Alps, a large sunny 
garden to hang out in, and a great location on the edge of old Embrun – close 
to the Alpine routes used by the Tour de France and the Haute Route Alps 
(Embrun to Nice is another classic ride). Aside from cycling, the town is a 
gateway to the Écrins national park (the largest in France) and the manmade 
Serre Ponçon lake (with boats, beaches and viewpoints). Wake up to birdsong, 
baking and home-made jam.

The majority of the island’s hardcore cycling routes are in the north (home 
ground for Tour de France sprinter Mark Cavendish), but a good compromise for a 
mix of cycling and non-cycling types is on seaside Port Erin at its southern 
tip and this luxe Manx guesthouse. The glassy circular lounge, the neon lights 
and the Astro-turfed decks are a wee bit Austin Powers, but the rooms are super 
comfortable, with amazing views across the bay – plus there’s a glitzy indoor 
pool and home-cooked meals on request. It’s an hour’s walk along the Raad ny 
Foillan (the island’s coast path) to the Calf sound, and a 30-minute walk to 
Port St Mary (for the steam railway to Douglas).

This is a mini country house hotel of medieval origin (ancient timbers, 
latched doors, flagstones, wonky walls distempered in various shades of Farrow 
& Ball). It has a highly regarded restaurant, rose-scented gardens, a cobbled 
courtyard and converted linhay stable, which offers fair-weather dining and an 
outhouse with space for wet bikes and muddy boots. In the room, there’s a 
complimentary mini bar and views of wooded hills across the A39 between 
Minehead and Porlock. Open the gate and access Allerford’s ancient pack-horse 
bridge and a footpath that follows the river Aller to the Somerset coast. It’s 
less than two miles from the foot of Porlock hill and three miles from the 
Porlock Weir toll road – two tortuously steep Exmoor climbs which attract 
cyclists training for the Alps (average gradient 5.5% for 4.1 miles, I am told).

Weather permitting (not for nothing do they call this “the misty isle”), Skye 
is
cycling heaven, not just in the Cuillin mountains but pretty much everywhere. A
favourite is the Trotternish peninsula, a north-west loop of high, undulating
roads that meander up the coast from Portree to Uig, via the Old Man of Storr,
Lealt waterfall and the rocky cliffs and pinnacles of the Quiraing. Within 
hiking
distance of unspoilt Trotternish beaches, Glenview has three cosy, king-size
rooms with a mountain backdrop, interesting decor (knitting, vintage, white-
wash, dangling tea-cup art), and the Skye Pie Café (refuel on homemade crab or
mutton pie). Just up the hill, the new Eyrie <http://www.r-escape.co.uk/> 
(£165 a night, minimum three nights) offers self-catering in a contemporary 
highland cottage with two woody “pods” and spectacular views across Skye’s off 
islands to Scotland’s mountainous west coast.
