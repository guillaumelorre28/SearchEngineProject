If the Olympic movement is having a hard time of it, consider the year the 
host city is having. In the build-up to the 2016 Games, Brazil is sinking under 
a tickertape parade of bad news. Given stories of polluted water, gang and 
police violence, an economy in free fall, the Zika virus, fear of terror 
attacks and a president impeached, worries over unfinished infrastructure for 
the Games almost pale into insignificance.
The Rio de Janeiro area

Lovely Rio, it’s easy to imagine, might just think twice given the chance to 
bid for the Olympics again. And yet, despite everything, the metropolis remains 
arguably the most beautiful city in the Americas, if not the world: whatever 
might happen in the sporting arenas, the Olympics has never had a backdrop as 
stunning as this.

And despite all their worries, most cariocas, as Rio’s residents are known, 
are proud of their amazing city. As they prepare to welcome half a million 
visitors to the Games, we asked five insiders to talk us through the best of 
their tropical seaside home.

São Paulo has more options than Rio in terms of cuisine, but we outshine them 
when it comes to avant garde, contemporary local food. As well as Lasai, we have
Olympe <http://olympe.com.br/en/>, owned by the chef who pioneered the fusion 
of Brazilian and French cuisines;Roberta Sudbrack 
<http://robertasudbrack.com.br/>, with a bistro feel and sophisticated, 
eight-course tasting menu. AlsoOro <http://www.ororestaurante.com.br/>, which 
reopened in Leblon recently, is extremely creative.

We’re closed on Sundays and Mondays, so those are the nights we can get out to 
eat. For special occasions, we love Olympe; but we often go toAzumi 
<https://pt-br.facebook.com/pages/Azumi/102409009846569> (on Facebook), a 
Japanese restaurant in Copacabana. The broths, the udon and the soba there are 
great (£12-21).

 Bar Urca looks out over Guanabara Bay. 
Bar Urca <http://www.barurca.com.br/> is a Rio classic – highly recommended 
for visitors. The food isn’t the greatest, but you go there for the ambience – 
to meet friends and drink beer sitting on the wall outside, looking out over 
Guanabara Bay.

There’s a restaurant in Centro, the old commercial heart of Rio, where I don’t 
go as often as I’d like, but that I love –Escondidinho 
<https://www.facebook.com/escondidinhobeco> (on Facebook). My dad used to go 
when he was young, I go there sometimes, and probably my son will go too. It’s 
a traditional lunchtime restaurant going since the 1940s and known for its beef 
ribs in broth, with fried cassava and watercress (£32, serves two or more). The 
meat starts to fall off the bone before you’ve even picked up your knife and 
fork.

We have a culture of botecos, classic neighbourhood bars where you grab a beer 
and a snack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/feb/10/best-bars-rio-de-janeiro> – say 
apastel (a small meat or cheese pie) or a coxinha (chicken-and-cassava 
fritter). There’s a great one in Praça da Bandeira (in north Rio, very near the 
Maracanã stadium, which will stage the Games’ opening ceremony) calledAconchego 
Carioca <https://www.facebook.com/aconchego.carioca> that does all our national 
dishes and snacks very well indeed.

 Aconchego Carioca in Praça da Bandeira 
A more rustic, classic boteco is Bar da Gema 
<https://www.facebook.com/bardagema> in Andaraí. They do fried polenta with 
oxtail stew on top (£10), and you eat it with your hands. It’s amazing. They 
also servepastel de feijão gordo (£1.50), little pies filled with feijoada – 
black-bean stew, our national dish. They are so good I could eat about 10 of 
them.

Brazil isn’t so strong on street food, but the Saturday morning farmers’ 
market in Jardim Botânico, on Rua Frei Leandro, opposite Olympe restaurant, 
does a greattapioca, a kind of cassava pancake. It serves up a version with 
cheese, tomato, onions and oregano, using a cheese calledqueijo minas meia-cura,
which melts perfectly when it hits the griddle.

Musically, Rio is incredibly rich – it’s often music that gets people out at 
night. Monday is outdoor samba night atPedra do Sal 
<https://rodadesambadapedradosal.blogspot.co.uk/>, in Largo João da Baiana, 10 
minutes’ walk from the newMuseum of Tomorrow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/museum-of-tomorrow-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-sustainability>
 (which is definitely worth a visit). Musicians go straight there to play after 
they get off work, from about 7pm. They play old-school, very traditional 
samba. Take a taxi if you don’t know this area.

And on Wednesday nights at Praça Tiradentes there’s a jazz scene in the middle 
of the square, just people hanging out and playing and listening to jazz. It’s 
free. They just turn up and start playing, and if you get there at about 9pm, 
it’s generally in full swing. Cariocas are experts at making something happen 
out of nothing.

Praça São Salvador in Laranjeiras is another one: on Friday nights, the square 
gets packed with hundreds of people getting together in the open air, and guys 
selling beer from ice boxes. Everyone loves it.

Mixing <http://www.mixxing.com.br/> is a kind of speakeasy in Rio Comprido, 
between Centro and Tijuca. During the day it’s a school of mixology, but on 
certain nights it transforms into a bar. You’d never guess it was there from 
the outside – you go through a garage, up some stairs and along a corridor and 
there it is.

Traditionally, Rio has always been about caipirinhas and chope (light draft 
beer) but there’s a growing cocktail culture. The challenge for Rio bartenders 
is to convince cariocas to go for drier, more complex drinks – as they tend to 
veer towards sweetness.Bar D’Hotel 
<http://www.allsuites.hoteismarina.com.br/gastronomia/bar-d-h-a-tel.htm>, 
inside Marina All-Suites, has one of the best drinks menus in Rio; another is 
the newBar Astor <http://www.barastor.com.br/> inside the Astor hotel, on the 
Ipanema seafront. They’ve brought high-level São Paulo-style mixology to Rio, 
which I love.

The new Atlântico Rio de Janeiro 
<https://www.facebook.com/Atlantico-Rio-de-Janeiro-1502113423417458/> in Barra 
da Tijuca is one of the most Rio-spirited bars I can think of, though its owner 
isn’t even Brazilian. Tato Giovannoni came from Buenos Aires, where he owns the 
bar Floreria Atlántico, and just did something different – created a really 
good beach bar with amazing cocktails and fresh seafood.

He makes a dry martini with a tincture of sea salt, right there on the beach, 
and serves oysters at about £1 each. They’re also doing a pop-up bar during the 
Olympics, atClubhouse Rio <http://clubhouserio.com/>.

For me, the best saideira (nightcap) is at Galeto Sat’s 
<https://www.facebook.com/Galeto-Sats-327446854014619/> , open till late in 
Copacabana. Lots of bartenders and chefs go there after work for beer and 
grilled chicken. It’s a tiny, old-fashioned joint where people spill on to the 
pavement. My order is a shot of good cachaça and a plate of grilled chicken 
hearts.

A place I love to take visitors is Instituto Moreira Salles 
<http://www.ims.com.br/ims/>. It’s a wonderful example of modernist Brazilian 
architecture, with gardens byRoberto Burle Marx 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Burle_Marx> and a beautiful panel by 
Cândido Portinari <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candido_Portinari>, facing the 
pond. It was once the home of a very wealthy family, but today it’s a cultural 
institution with an impeccable programme – they hold great exhibitions, plus 
there’s a photo collection, a music collection and a photography magazine.

Parque Lage <http://eavparquelage.rj.gov.br/> is always good – another very 
beautiful place, home to the EAV School of Visual Arts, with an interesting 
gallery in the former stables, called Galeria das Cavalariças.

There is a great area around Praça XV, with art galleries, cinema and theatre 
in theCentro Cultural Banco do Brasil

worth seeing.

Centro has another cultural hub now: Porto Maravilha

MAR Museum of Art <http://museudeartedorio.org.br/en> and the Museum of Tomorrow
 <http://www.museudoamanha.org.br/en>. Close to that but less well-known is 
Cais do Valongo <http://portomaravilha.com.br/historical_and_archeological>, 
the archaeological site of Rio’s former shipping wharf, where hundreds of 
thousands of the slaves brought to Brazil came ashore. There’s also theGaleria 
dos Pretos Novos <http://www.pretosnovos.com.br/galeria.html>, an art gallery, 
and part of a memorial complex on the site of an ancient slave cemetery.

Pedra do Sal <http://portomaravilha.com.br/historical_and_archeological> is 
another historic site in the area, where there was once aquilombo, a community 
of former slaves and their descendants. It’s just behind the MAR, and a very 
interesting place to visit.

Rio is full of quiet spots from which to observe the city’s curves, the 
contours of the hills and the green vegetation against the ocean. There are 
lovely parks, such asParque Lage  <http://eavparquelage.rj.gov.br/> and the 
Jardim Botânico <http://www.jbrj.gov.br/>, and even the gigantic tropical 
rainforest,Floresta da Tijuca <http://www.parquedatijuca.com.br/> invades the 
city limits. Or just being in the sea is a peaceful experience.

If you only go to one beach, I’d recommend Ipanema, at Posto 10 (postos are 
the beaches demarcation points and come every kilometre). It’s one of the 
safest parts of the beach, and it attracts a lot of young, cool people. There’s 
a good place just across the road for lunch calledBalada Mix 
<http://www.baladamixrestaurante.com.br/>, with great sandwiches and juices, 
including açai. Arpoador, a headland between Copacabana and Ipanema, is special 
too – you have to see it at sunset, when people climb on to the rocks to look 
right down Ipanema beach to the sun setting behind the Dois Irmãos peaks.

I also like the long beaches to the west: at Barra da Tijuca and also Praia da 
Joatinga, where the water is a beautiful green colour and there are no crowds. 
To reach it, you follow a steep trail down on to the sand. Some of Rio’s very 
best beaches are even further west, on the very edge of the city, likePraia do 
Secreto and Prainha.

Because of all the mountains dotted around, Rio must have the most spectacular 
views of any city 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2014/jul/13/top-10-views-in-rio-de-janeiro-in-pictures>
 in the world. My all-time favourite view is fromMirante Dona Marta. It’s 
breathtaking – you can see Sugarloaf Mountain below, with the sea all around 
it, the boats in Botafogo harbour and all the way across Guanabara Bay to 
Niterói. And in the other direction you can see Christ the Redeemer close up. 
You can take a taxi there direct from Botafogo, or via the Jardim Botânico 
neighbourhood, throughParque Nacional da Tijuca 
<http://www.parquedatijuca.com.br/>, stopping at Vista Chinesa for another 
amazing view. Lots of athletes and cyclists train up there, but it’s very 
steep, only for the super-fit.

 ‘Rio must have the most spectacular views of any city in the world’. This view 
is of Sao Conrado beach and the Rocinha favela. Photograph: Alamy 
This unique topography means you can also hike and climb within the city. Of 
Rio’s best-known hikes,Dois Irmãos is light to moderate, about 45 minutes’ 
climb from the top of Vidigal favela (which is safe to visit). You can take a 
van to the foot of the trail, or a motorbike taxi. Or insideParque Nacional da 
Tijuc <http://www.parquedatijuca.com.br/>a, Pedra Bonita is a nice, easy walk, 
about 40-45 minutes. It’s steep, but if you take it slowly, it’s fine, and the 
view are similar to those from the top of Pedra da Gávea, which is a far harder 
climb.

One of my favourite, lesser-known trails is the Trilha do Morro da Babilônia. 
It’s really easy – only 30 or 40 minutes – and has great views of Praia 
Vermelha beach and Pão de Açucar. You start at Ladeira Ary Barroso in Leme, and 
walk up into Chapéu Mangueira favela. Guides fromCoop Babilônia 
<http://coopbabilonia.blogspot.co.uk/>, a residents’ cooperative, will take you 
up the trail for about £14. It’s best to go early in the day, and make sure to 
be out of the community before evening.

Close by is a lovely, easy 20-minute walk to Leme Fort, which very few 
cariocas know about. You start from Praça Almirante Júlio de Noronha, at the 
tip of Leme, pay R$4 to go in the fort, and then walk up a trail thick with 
birds, plants and butterflies – it’s a glorious place.

Historically, cariocas escaped the summer heat in mountain towns such as 
Petrópolis (briefly the capital of Brazil), Teresópolis and Araras.Petrópolis, 
about an hour from Rio by road, is an interesting, historic town, with an
Imperial Museum <http://www.museuimperial.gov.br/> and some lovely waterfalls.

The island of Ilha Grande is 100km from Rio, plus a boat trip, but really has 
to be seen. It has spectacular beaches, and lots of dense, unspoiled Atlantic 
forest. No cars are allowed on the island. It’s a real paradise, although it 
was once a hellish prison island where political prisoners were held.

But there are lots of good excursions closer to Rio – across Guanabara Bay to 
Niterói is Oscar Niemeyer’sMAC contemporary art museum 
<http://www.culturaniteroi.com.br/macniteroi/>, with magnificent views back to 
Rio, and some great restaurants close by.

My top recommendation, though, is to head out past Barra da Tijuca and the 
Olympic Park towards Guaratiba, to visitSítio Burle Marx 
<http://sitioburlemarx.blogspot.co.uk/>, where the famous landscape artist 
lived and worked.

Rio’s landscape is dotted with his works – he landscaped the square in front 
of Santos Dumont airport, the gardens of the Modern Art Museum and Flamengo 
Park. He also designed the famous pavement tiles for Copacabana and Ipanema 
promenades.

Sítio Burle Marx is a lovely series of gardens, with a small museum and his 
painting studio, now used for occasional exhibitions. It was a laboratory for 
Burle Marx, a place to cultivate plants, and to experiment. It goes from sea 
level to a height of about 300 metres. You have to make an appointment to visit 
(+21 2410 1412;visitas.srbm@iphan.gov.br <mailto:visitas.srbm@iphan.gov.br>), 
and it’s one to two hours’ drive, depending on traffic. You can get there 
faster via the tunnel, but the scenic route along the coast, past miles of
restinga – the sandy coastal shrubland – passes a number of beautiful beaches: 
Praia da Macumba, Praia do Secreto and the nudist Praia do Abricó.

Close to the Sítio, there’s a fantastic restaurant, Bira de Guaratiba 
<http://www.restaurantedobira.com.br/>, specialising in African-influenced 
seafood dishes from the state of Bahia. It’s not cheap, but the food is 
fantastic, the portions serve three or four people (or order a half portion) 
and the sea views are stunning.

Also on the way is the Museu Casa do Pontal 
<http://www.museucasadopontal.com.br/>, which has a huge collection of 
vernacular Brazilian art, and which runs interesting contemporary exhibitions 
alongside.
