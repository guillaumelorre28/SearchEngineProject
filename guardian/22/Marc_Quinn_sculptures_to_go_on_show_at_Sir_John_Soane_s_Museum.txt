Marc Quinn, who famously made a yoga-themed gold statue of Kate Moss, is to 
show 10 new sculptures at theSir John Soane’s Museum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/16/sir-john-soane-private-apartments-obsessive-eccentric-brilliance-architect-morbid-passions>
 in the first display by a contemporary artist created specially for the venue.

The artist said he scoured the museum in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> – which is bursting with Roman 
sculptures, Hogarth paintings, an alabaster sarcophagus and the Georgian tomb 
of a dog, among many other items – to find enough space for his lifesize 
sculptures.

Quinn, whose works include a self-portrait using 10 pints of frozen blood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/16/blood-art-history-marc-quinn-johnny-depp>
, said: “When I first had the idea, it wasn’t a question of whether I could 
make them, but whether it would be physically possible to find room for them.”

The sculptures, to be installed in the spring, are based on casts made from 
the body of his partner, Jenny Bastet, while he embraces her. Each required the 
couple to stand for almost two hours covered in tight, dental rubber coating, 
before the moulds were peeled off to be cast in eggshell-thin fibreglass.

They will all be fragmentary: one clasping arm, a torso with one leg, a 
heavily veined hand, instantly recalling the myriad fragments of antique 
sculpture scattered through the museum.

Quinn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/03/marc-quinn-interview-q-and-a>
 said: “Fragments can have such a powerful impact, [they have] so much locked 
up in them, somehow embodying the whole object but often with an even stronger 
emotional impact.”

The exhibition, called Drawn from Life, will mark the most significant 
contemporary art installation in the museum, and the launch of a new programme 
inviting artists to the crowded rooms in the former home of the revered 
Georgian architect who gave it its name.

Bruce Boucher, the museum’s director, said: “We’ve been looking inward for the 
last seven years, working on this major project in the history of the building, 
reinstating and opening up spaces that haven’t been seen for almost 200 years. 
Now is the time to look outward – and to cross boundaries, as Soane himself 
did. All the art in this house wasn’t old [when he bought it]. He befriended 
artists and bought contemporary art.”

When Boucher arrived this year, his director of development, Anh Nguyen, had a 
guilty admission: she had already virtually signed off the Quinn project, based 
on a dinner party conversation. “It just seemed such a perfect fit for the 
museum,” she said. Fortunately Boucher agreed: “It was immediately clear to me 
that we were travelling on the same road.”

Sir John Soane’s Museum: ‘A crazy labyrinth of art, architecture and history’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2011/sep/08/sir-john-soanes-museum>
Quinn – whose best-known works include a sculpture of the artist Alison 
Lapper, first exhibited on Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/sep/18/art> – said the 
sculptures were a work of joy and a celebration of his three-year relationship 
with Bastet.

Asked what she thought of the project, he said: “She loved the idea. She’s a 
dancer, so she’s used to holding a pose for long periods – though she did faint 
twice.”
