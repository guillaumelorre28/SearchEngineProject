Airlie Beach and the Whitsunday Islands

It’s easy to spend an entire holiday exploring the Whitsunday archipelago’s 74 
jungle-clad islands. The jet-set flocks to ritzy Hamilton Island (owned by wine 
baron and sailing enthusiast Bob Oatley) but nature lovers can delve into 
uninhabited isles fringed with coral reefs and perfect beaches. Fly to Hamilton 
Island’s Great Barrier Reef Airport or Whitsunday Coast Airport, a 20-minute 
drive from Airlie Beach.

Airlie Waterfront B&B

Airlie Beach, gateway to the Whitsundays, attracts visitors eager to wallow in 
tropical pleasures without paying the hefty price of an island resort stay. 
Between day trips to the reef and islands, unwind at the town’s manmade lagoon, 
200 metres from Airlie Waterfront B&B. Lounge on a deckchair in the B&B’s 
garden and survey the dramatic rainforest-meets-reef coastline. The 
double-storey property is all modern geometric lines with a deep veranda up top 
to catch the sea breeze.

Palm Bay Resort
Sunrise or sunset? Catch both at Palm Bay Resort, which sprawls over the neck 
of Long Island (travel there by water taxi from Shute Harbour near Airlie 
Beach). The 23 suites and Balinese-style villas, with hammocks strung out 
front, provide a great getaway. Unusually for an island resort, this is 
self-catering so some planning is required to source provisions. Meals are 
cooked in a communal kitchen. In 2015 the resort added a cocktail bar that 
shakes a mean Long Island iced tea.

to Whitehaven Beach with Airlie Beach-based Mantaray Charters for a visit so 
leisurely there’s time to climb Hill Inlet for an elevated view over the

Whitehaven Beach 
<http://www.tourismwhitsundays.com.au/destinations/whitehaven-beach/> on 
Whitsunday Island – the group’s largest island – has become a must-see

different, sail over for a day trip (including morning tea and lunch) on the

Townsville and nearby islands

Townsville, Australia’s largest tropical city, is more business than pleasure 
but it’s the perfect gateway to a handful of reef islands. Magnetic Island 
(Maggie to the locals) lies just offshore; think of it as a far-flung 
Townsville suburb. Spend a day or two exploring Townsville’s attractions, which 
include a hugeaquarium <http://www.reefhq.com.au/> and an unlikely pink-granite 
hill overlooking the city.

Stay

Rambutan
Rambutan, in Townsville’s nightlife area, bills itself as Australia’s first 
“glam-packers’” resort. The low-rise property, which opened in 2015, turns the 
concept of a backpackers’ hostel on its head with a stylish rooftop bar and 
pool, air-con and en suite for each room, and a restaurant serving 
American-style food (think barbeuce pit meats and southern fried chicken). 
Accommodation ranges from undercover van sites to mixed and single-sex dorms, 
private rooms and a four-bedroom villa.

Guests are given a mini-tour of the island – and perhaps a glimpse of a 
resident koala – when Magnetic Island B&B’s owners fetch them from the ferry. 
The B&B is at Horseshoe Bay at the island’s northern end. Most of Maggie, which 
has 23 secluded beaches and bays, is national park. Spend days rambling along 
bush tracks to lookouts and picking a favourite swimming spot before returning 
to relax around the pool.

Adrenalin Dive
Experienced divers can explore the wreck of the Yongala, a passenger steamer 
that sank during a 1911 cyclone. Lying 15 metres underwater, the ship is one of 
the world’s best wreck dives. It attracts sharks, manta rays, turtles, sea 
snakes, giant trevally and schools of tropical fish. During winter, divers may 
see humpback whales. Adrenaline Dive also takes snorkellers and divers to 
Lodestone Reef – popular with parrotfish, angelfish and clownfish.

Hike Castle Hill
Central Australia has Uluru but Townsville has its own unmissable monolith in 
the shape of Castle Hill – a pink-granite landmark that looms 286 metres above 
the city. Despite the heat and humidity and the fact there’s a perfectly 
serviceable road, people persist in taking the hard way to the summit. There 
are more than a dozen marked and unmarked trails to the lookout – offering 
views over the city and Magnetic Island.

Cairns and beyond

Cairns is the northernmost point of Australian tourism’s “golden triangle” 
(Sydney and Uluru are the other two). While the city’s fortunes have waxed and 
waned over the years, it’s now on an upward trajectory following major 
investment in several developments.

What’s better than leaping into a waterhole deep in the middle of a 
rainforest? Try pairing that experience with stories from the local Kuku 
Yalanji people. The Dreamtime Gorge Walk at Mossman Gorge, 77km north of 
Cairns, begins with a smoking ceremony to ward off bad spirits. Learn about 
bush foods, traditional plant uses and how to make ochre paint before finishing 
the 1.5-hour tour with tea and damper (soda bread).
