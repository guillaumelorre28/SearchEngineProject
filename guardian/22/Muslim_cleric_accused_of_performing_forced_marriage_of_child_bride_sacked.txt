He was later sacked after an internal investigation and a new imam appointed, 
the statement said.

“Mr Omerdic is no longer the imam of the Noble Park mosque and has no role 
with the society,” it said. “Further, Mr Omerdic’s marriage celebrant licence 
has been revoked.”

A second man, who cannot be identified, is charged with sexually assaulting 
his child bride between 30 September and 1 October last year. A DVD of the 
ceremony being conducted at a mosque may form part of the evidence,Melbourne

.

Omerdic is on bail while the other man has been remanded into custody until 
the case resumes on 3 February.

The Board of Imams Victoria has issued a statement against forced and child 
marriages.

It said imams were advised to meet both the bride and groom in person before 
the marriage ceremony to ensure they were of marriageable age and both 
consented.

“Underage marriages are illegal in Australia,” the statement said. “As 
Australian Muslims we are required to observe and respect the laws of 
Australia.”
