Troubled computer games firm Gameplay yesterday shed 70 of its 80 staff. The 
company has not yet found a buyer for its remaining technology business.

The London-based firm said in May it was looking for buyers because it was 
running out of cash fast.

Mark Bernstein, chief executive refused to say how much cash the firm had in 
the bank, but said it was in early stage talks with a number of parties. It is 
thought that shareholders BSkyB and BT are interested.

"A small central team is being retained whilst the company considers 
conditional and indicative offers for the remaining elements of its business," 
said a spokesman for the firm.

Shares in the company, which have collapsed in spectacular fashion, slumped 
18.75% to 3.25p.

Last year the stock changed hands for almost £11, and the company was named 
the Alternative Investment Market's "new company of the year".

Gameplay said in May it would quit the retail games market. By then its UK 
boxed games business had already been bought by management for £1 and its 
Swedish arm was sold for 7p.
