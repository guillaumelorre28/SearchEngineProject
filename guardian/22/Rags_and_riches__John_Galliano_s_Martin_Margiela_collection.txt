world’s wealth as the poorer half

twisted kind of economic sense.

John Galliano’s Maison Margiela Artisanal collection, however, is less easy to 
explain. It is an official haute couture catwalk show, held in an imposing 
gallery of the Hotel des Invalides to a tinkly, Parisian cafe-society 
soundtrack. As with the other shows, the prices are kept discreet, presumably 
lest word of them should spark a revolution. And yet these are definitively not 
clothes designed to appeal to the super rich, being as much about rags as they 
are about riches.

The philosophy of the house founded by Martin Margiela is about unpicking and 
exposing how fashion works, rather than using it to brandish wealth and power.

“The humble gesture of tearing paper” was the starting point for this show, 
which started with white skirt suits, each of which had a section torn out and 
replaced with a different texture: paper, first, then lame velvet. There was an 
idea here about how a garment takes on the personality and the meaning of the 
textile it is made of.

Next came contrasts in how fabrics are treated and finished, and how that 
affects how we read them. So there was neat, close-pleated triple georgette one 
minute, followed by exquisite jacquard with raw, violently ripped edges, 
followed by leather hole-punched into delicate mesh. An exquisite dress was 
draped down the front of a model’s body, cinched with a belt and leaving her 
legs bare at the back: a ballgown, worn as a worker’s apron. (“Decorative 
surfaces migrate across utilitarian elements”, according to the show notes.)

Even the faces of the models were fractured. A glossy stencil of a red lipped 
mouth appeared on one model’s throat, and over another’s eye. The models’ 
actual mouths, meanwhile, were painted blue or black. Long hair was threaded 
with feathers and gemstones until it glinted like a magpie’s nest. It was 
original, strange, and surprisingly beautiful.

The strangest part of all? The sales figures. Revenues at Maison Margiela have 
increased by 30% in the past year, since the arrival ofJohn Galliano 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/john-galliano>. Renzo Rosso, owner of 
Diesel as well as Margiela and the man who gave Galliano the job, says that the 
couture collection is now the engine of growth at the company, defining the 
image of the house and setting the agenda for other collections. Plans for 
handbags and a new perfume are in process, CEO Giovanni Pungetti told 
Womenswear Daily recently.
