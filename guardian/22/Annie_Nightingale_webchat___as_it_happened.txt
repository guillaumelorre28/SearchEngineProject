Ooh thank you so much! I should really produce a setlist. I'll try to put it 
on my Facebook fan page - I hate that word 'fan' but hope you will forgive. I 
was playing a lot of trap and bass, and was really worried whether it would go 
well, but thank you Thomas for being there. I'd never played this music at 
Glastonbury before - but they seemed to love it.

"The battle is to keep the BBC going"

Let's keep the BBC going shall we? The battle is to keep the BBC going. Of 
course I would love to, but there are greater issues right now I think, to 
ensure the future of the BBC. People often ask me why such a small country as 
ours has such a worldwide influence in terms of how our music is perceived. 
Surely the fact that we have radio stations such asRadio 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-1>, 1Xtra, 6Music, to nurture new 
music, has had helped this process ever since the Beatles gave us worldwide 
recognition. Without stations nurturing and playing new music, that culture 
could disappear very quickly. That really worries me.

"Everyone remembers the Damned on the Old Grey Whistle Test...they really did

What do you remember most about The Damned’s appearance on The Old Grey 
Whistle Test in 1979? Classic TV in my opinion.

Everyone remembers the Damned on the Old Grey Whistle Test. They were pulling 
faces behind me as I introduced them and I was aware of this. Then they really 
did smash the studio up. But there was something very darkly comic about all of 
that - the camera came to me at one point and I made some comment about the 
ghost of Keith Moon because the Who owned that part of Shepperton Studios where 
that edition of the Old Grey Whistle Test was being broadcast from.

I've got one answer for you: on Power by Kanye West he sampled King Crimson's 
21st Century Schizoid Man, which to me was the best progressive rock tracks 
ever.

To me there's only two kinds of music: good and bad. And I hope I wouldn't 
play anything bad. I know that's subjective, but I do try to bring the best I 
can to the listener. You can't define it... lazy, unoriginal, crass, banal.

"When I started at Radio 1, the other DJs were too busy squabbling among

ID6654445 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2566313> asks: 

I read that you had to fight to get onto the radio because Radio 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-1> DJs were supposed to be ‘husband 
substitutes’. How did the other DJs treat you when you started out? And were 
you ever a ‘wife substitute’?

What a great question! I've never thought of myself like a 'wife substitute', 
ever. The answer would probably be no. I do remember early on, having thanked a 
female listener for sending me a jar of homemade jam or something, the engineer 
said back through the talkback, "oh, we'll be having knitting patterns next." 
So not very wifey!

The other DJs, they were too busy squabbling among themselves to notice me. 
Johnnie Walker was always very supportive of me though.

Could you describe the creative process behind putting your name on a CD of

Yes! I absolutely take your point. I've actually spent seven months, seven 
days a week, working on this to refine and define the tracks that I think will 
work best. It's a labour of love really. But I'd like to feel that you could 
put this triple CD on perhaps at the beginning of a car journey, a train 
journey, and that you'll end up somewhere that might be a pleasant surprise. 
I've added tracks in that are not greatest hits, but sometimes more interesting 
tunes, some that have been completely forgotten about - Footsteps Following Me 
by Frances Nero. The Moonflowers - Get Higher (Get Dubber mix). The Mitchell 
Brothers with Sway - Harvey Nicks, which is something signed to The Streets' 
label, and I hope will put a smile on everyone's faces at the end of the album. 
There was a lot more to this compilation than either of the two I've done 
before.

I don't lament the way music is consumed today. Why should the digital age be 
ruination? It seems that the more platforms there are to listen to the huge 
volumes of music being made, the more people seem to need curators, maybe on 
radio shows where a lot of time has been put into finding great stuff. The deal 
with me and the listener is that I will spend all my time finding the best 
music I can, and putting it together so that if you haven't got all that time 
to do so, my show might be somewhere you can visit. Sometimes it's what you 
don't play that I think people appreciate - I try to never play anything that I 
don't feel 100% deserves airtime, and I do try and help the up and coming 
artists. That to me is the whole point of this job.

Ooh thank you so much! I should really produce a setlist. I'll try to put it 
on my Facebook fan page - I hate that word 'fan' but hope you will forgive. I 
was playing a lot of trap and bass, and was really worried whether it would go

Let's keep the BBC going shall we? The battle is to keep the BBC going. Of 
course I would love to, but there are greater issues right now I think, to 
ensure the future of the BBC. People often ask me why such a small country as 
ours has such a worldwide influence in terms of how our music is perceived. 
Surely the fact that we have radio stations such asRadio 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-1>, 1Xtra, 6Music, to nurture new 
music, has had helped this process ever since the Beatles gave us worldwide 
recognition. Without stations nurturing and playing new music, that culture 
could disappear very quickly. That really worries me.

Everyone remembers the Damned on the Old Grey Whistle Test. They were pulling 
faces behind me as I introduced them and I was aware of this. Then they really 
did smash the studio up. But there was something very darkly comic about all of 
that - the camera came to me at one point and I made some comment about the 
ghost of Keith Moon because the Who owned that part of Shepperton Studios where 
that edition of the Old Grey Whistle Test was being broadcast from.

I've got one answer for you: on Power by Kanye West he sampled King Crimson's

To me there's only two kinds of music: good and bad. And I hope I wouldn't 
play anything bad. I know that's subjective, but I do try to bring the best I 
can to the listener. You can't define it... lazy, unoriginal, crass, banal.

I read that you had to fight to get onto the radio because Radio 1

you ever a ‘wife substitute’?

What a great question! I've never thought of myself like a 'wife substitute', 
ever. The answer would probably be no. I do remember early on, having thanked a 
female listener for sending me a jar of homemade jam or something, the engineer 
said back through the talkback, "oh, we'll be having knitting patterns next." 
So not very wifey!

The other DJs, they were too busy squabbling among themselves to notice me. 
Johnnie Walker was always very supportive of me though.

Yes! I absolutely take your point. I've actually spent seven months, seven 
days a week, working on this to refine and define the tracks that I think will 
work best. It's a labour of love really. But I'd like to feel that you could 
put this triple CD on perhaps at the beginning of a car journey, a train 
journey, and that you'll end up somewhere that might be a pleasant surprise. 
I've added tracks in that are not greatest hits, but sometimes more interesting 
tunes, some that have been completely forgotten about - Footsteps Following Me 
by Frances Nero. The Moonflowers - Get Higher (Get Dubber mix). The Mitchell 
Brothers with Sway - Harvey Nicks, which is something signed to The Streets' 
label, and I hope will put a smile on everyone's faces at the end of the album. 
There was a lot more to this compilation than either of the two I've done 
before.
