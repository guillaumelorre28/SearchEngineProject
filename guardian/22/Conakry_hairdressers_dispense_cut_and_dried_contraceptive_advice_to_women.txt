Fatoumatah Bah is cornered. Sitting in front of a tinsel-ringed mirror in 
Miskaa Salon, her head is bent forward, two women at work braiding twists into 
her hair. She will be stuck in the chair for at least three hours.

It is a good moment to pounce. Fatoumatah Kamara, 20, an apprentice 
hairdresser in a matching skirt and blouse and glinting cherry earrings, sidles 
up to Bah. She starts to make conversation.

At first, it is the usual hairdresser chatter. What rain we’ve been having, 
eh? Where are you from? What are you up to this weekend? This is the 
20-year-old accountancy student’s second visit to the salon in Guinea’s 
capital, Conakry.

Soon Kamara’s questions become more personal. Does Bah have a husband? A 
boyfriend? Then she goes in for the kill. Does she know there are ways of 
avoiding getting pregnant?

With every manicure, pedicure and hairdo at the Miskaa Salon, clients receive 
a free treatment: a great deal of contraceptive advice.

Contraception and family planning around the world – interactive

Five salons across Conakry have been dispensing family planning advice since 
2012, and they have been so successful that the project – the brainchild of
Jhpiego <https://www.jhpiego.org/>, a health organisation associated with Johns 
Hopkins University in the US – is about to be extended to salons in Guinea’s 
seven major cities.

In Guinea, which has one of the lowest rates of modern contraceptive use in 
the world, women have an average of five children. According toUN figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive>
, in 2015 only 7.5% of married or cohabiting women use some form of 
contraception.

A lot of effort has gone into teaching women in rural Guinea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea> about family planning, but not so 
much in urban areas. A salon is an excellent place to reach them, so long as it 
is the right kind of salon.

“It’s better to go where they do braids because that’s what women 
traditionally want,” says Yolande Hyjazi, Jhpiego’s director in Guinea. “A 
woman who’s straightening or washing her hair has more money and more access to 
information.”

Across town from Miskaa, Jumelle Coiffure is trying to turn around clients as 
fast as possible, largely because the room is impossibly cramped. Jumelle is 
owned by 32-year-old twins Tata Sylla, wearing a short black and bright green 
wig, and her sister Mbalia, with long, heavy braids.

“There were a lot of young women getting pregnant around here when they didn’t 
want to, with lots of kids running after them, and I thought it would be good 
to teach them how to avoid that. Even my apprentices were getting pregnant,” 
says Mbalia, making up Aminata Kouma’s face just inside the salon door. 
Outside, a dozen girls huddle under the dripping overhang of the salon’s tin 
roof, filing fingernails and tugging at each other’s hair.

Kouma, 35, says she first heard about family planning at Jumelle.

“I never knew about this before coming here – they taught me how,” she said. 
“I got the injection, and since then I’ve been able to control the number of 
children I have. I already have four and I don’t want any more. My husband 
can’t afford it, school fees are so high. There’s too much suffering here. I’m 
a housemaid, but I’m out of work.”

Each salon has an army of apprentices, some of whom have worked in them for 
years, to cope with the intensity of the work and the number of clients. 
Jhpiego deliberately chose very popular salons to reach as many people as 
possible, and trained some of their apprentices as community health workers, to 
explain how to use exclusive breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy, talk about 
implants, sell pills and write referrals. They earn half the sale price for any 
pills and condoms they sell.

The trial started in 2013, but everything had to stop for the Ebola outbreak. 
Like all health organisations, Jhpiego had to turn its efforts to fighting 
Ebola. In any case, women were not going to the salon.

It is now back in full swing, though, and tailors’ shops are the next target. 
“There are women that wait around all day for their dresses, trying them on,” 
Hyjazi said. “People are being social, hanging around. But in the tailors’ 
shops we also have a lot of young men. Reaching men is important.”

The idea is that clients of both establishments will talk to their friends, 
and word will spread.

At Miskaa, a large wedding party is getting ready.

Apprentice hairdressers cluster around each client, carefully painting on 
long, black eyebrows, blow-drying hair straight, and making minute adjustments 
to towering, shiny headwraps.

Kamara, pointing at her laminated booklet, has just finished explaining how to 
use a string of beads to track fertility. But it isn’t new to Bah.

“I go on Google, I go on YouTube, I find information,” she says. “But not 
everybody is a student like me.”

She knew about condoms and pills, but not the other methods Kamara talks 
about. Young people have far more access to information than previous 
generations, and sex is slowly becoming something that is more talked about.

Traditionally, a Guinean woman would space out her children by leaving her 
husband and going back to her mother’s house for a few years, every time she 
had a baby.

“Now no one is using abstinence, so everyone is using contraceptives, but no 
one is talking about it,” Hyjazi says. “Many people think that if a women is 
using contraceptives, it’s because she has another partner. There’s not a lot 
of open communication – even between a husband and wife using them. Many women 
will use the pill without telling their husbands.”

One thing is unlikely to change, though, and according to Hyjazi, it is 
skewing the statistics, because people doing surveys do not always do them in 
private. “If a woman is asked if she’s using contraceptives and her mother or 
mother-in-law is there, she’ll never say yes.”

The wedding party is almost ready. Kamara looks over each woman carefully 
before opening the door for them. In a few hours, they have become more 
glamorous and, thanks to Kamara, more contraceptive-savvy.

“I like making women beautiful – that’s why I work here,” says Kamara, already 
looking around for her next quarry.
