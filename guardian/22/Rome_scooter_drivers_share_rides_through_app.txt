Waiting for a bus in Rome can sometimes feel like being stuck in a Samuel 
Beckett play, as a stream of scooters whizzes through each scene.

Now a smartphone app has been launched to match scooter drivers with people 
wanting to hitch a ride, aimed at helping locals avoid the city’snotoriously 
inefficient public transport

 and giving tourists a cheap way of seeing the sights.

Oliver Page, an American who grew up in Rome, got the idea for the app after a 
particularly long wait at a bus stop. Scooterino launched last week and has so 
far had 1,000 downloads, while Page and his two business partners continue to 
interview scooter owners – including city bus drivers – to get them online.

All journeys are charged at a fixed rate of €3 (£2.20), paid for through the 
app, and Scooterino will soon be adapted for foreign phone networks and the 
tourist crowd.


In its infancy the service operates during four-hour morning and evening slots 
and the availability of drivers is low, with just four available at one peak 
weekend time.


The app has inevitably been likened to Uber

which has encountered legal problems in Italy. In May a court in Milanshut down 
the UberPop app

, ruling that it created unfair competition and operated as an illegal taxi 
service.


Aware that similar problems could face Scooterino, Page described it as 
“fundamentally different” to Uber and a way for drivers to share their scooter 
expenses rather than make a profit.


“The culture here is so against new things, it’s so backwards and stifles 
innovation. I’m crossing my fingers that we can build up momentum before they 
start,” Page said of any potential legal challenges.
