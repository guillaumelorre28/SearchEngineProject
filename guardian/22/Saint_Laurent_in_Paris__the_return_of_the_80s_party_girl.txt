Since 2012, when designer Hedi Slimane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/hedi-slimane> began his reboot of the 
Saint Laurent brand, the label has been closely linked with music. Whether that 
be the young indie bands which populated the front row of his shows to the 
chagrin of uptight fashion editors banished to the rows behind them, or the 
designs themselves which are frequently dosed with gig culture – Glastonbury 
wellies and Courtney Love tiaras were a feature of his last show in Paris. 
Advocates of the brand are often those whoplay music for a living 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2016/feb/11/justin-bieber-glitter-and-velvet-saint-laurent-makes-its-la-debut>
, from Justin Bieber to Keith Richards.

So it was significant that at the Saint Laurent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/saint-laurent> show in Paris on Monday 
evening – the second part of the brand’s fall collection which began in 
blockbuster gig fashion in LA last month – that there was no catwalk music at 
all. Instead, the soundtrack was simply the voice of Benedicte de Ginestous 
announcing the arrival of each of the outfits. “Numero un ... number one,” she 
declared in a tone at once overly dramatic but also compelling. The 
significance of this device was not lost on the audience seated on personalised 
chairs in marble-heavy salons – de Ginestous announced the numbers of each look 
for Yves Saint Laurent’s couture shows between 1977 and 2002.

If the catwalk bingo calling device and the mannered opera chairs paid homage 
to the house’s history, the clothes themselves were nine parts Slimane, to one 
part Yves Saint Laurent. Each of the 42 looks echoed one dominant idea – that 
of a fierce late 1980s party girl – with the odd nod to the label’s original 
hallmarks thrown in. The take-home image was that of a 
cocktail-minidress-wearing woman with slicked-back hair, heavy lipstick, sheer 
tights, a wide belt and an overly dramatic shoulder detail. Picture a woman 
dancing in aRoxy Music video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpA_5a0miWk> and 
you get the starting point. Make her dress shorter, shinier, and razor cut to a 
millimetre of her breathing capacity, slot in the odd sequinned catsuit, biker 
jacket and puffball skirt and you have the full picture. The designer himself 
called the look a reference to classical editorial style, with slicked-back 
hair and red lips of a zillionHelmut Newton

Before the show began, guests were gossiping about the rumours that this will 
be Slimane’s last show for the brand, with designer Anthony Vaccarello hotly 
tipped to succeed him. But by the end of the show, the audience were wondering 
whether they had in fact seen the first couture show under Slimane. The brand 
announced that for this show it had reinstated the couture ateliers inParis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris> and Angiers – a plan Slimane has had 
for the house since taking the helm. He has also said that the reason he 
initially dropped the Yves from the branding was to eventually make some 
bandwidth and branding space for a reinstated couture line at some point. 
Moreover, this collection took place in a restored 17th-century mansion – 
L’hotel de Senecterre in Saint German which it is calling its new “couture 
house”. At the end of the show, it wasn’t clear whether the is was actually the 
end of the Slimane era, or simply the start of Slimane’s second act for Saint 
Laurent. The latter seems the more likely.
