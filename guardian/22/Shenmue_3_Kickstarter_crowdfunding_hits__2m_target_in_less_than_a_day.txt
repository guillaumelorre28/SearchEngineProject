“If we do not reach our funding goal, Shenmue 3 will not go forward,” wrote 
veteran games developer Yu Suzuki, as he launched aKickstarter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/kickstarter> crowdfunding campaign to 
make a new game in his pioneering open-world series.

Less than 24 hours later, the game is most certainly going forward, as Suzuki 
sailed past what now looks like a conservative fundraising goal of $2m. At the 
time of writing,Shenmue 3 has generated nearly $2.2m of pledges on Kickstarter

Announced at E3 <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/e3>, the new game will 
be released for PC and PlayStation 4, following on from Shenmue – released 
exclusively for Sega’s Dreamcast console in 1999 – and Shenmue II, which 
followed for Dreamcast and later Microsoft’s Xbox.

Those games won critical acclaim for impressive graphics and free-roaming 
gameplay that was well ahead of its time. “Shenmue 3 will have familiar 
elements from its predecessors and new fight mechanics to achieve a new level 
of interactive storytelling,” promised Suzuki in his crowdfunding pitch.

“Our ambition is to deliver a Shenmue experience that will draw in newcomers 
to the series and reward diehard fans with its deep story and rich gameplay.”

Suzuki said that fans of the first two games have regularly asked him to make 
a third, including encouraging him to use Kickstarter to crowdfund the new 
game, to ensure it happens.

“If Shenmue 3 was going to get made, I wanted to make it with the fans. 
Through Kickstarter, I knew that could happen,” he wrote. “Together, with 
Shenmue fans everywhere, I knew we could build the game that the series 
deserves.”

This being Kickstarter, there are now some stretch goals to reach, if pledges 
continue pouring in. $2.5m will spark a pair of cinematic shorts based on the 
first two Shenmue games, then subtitles in various languages; a “rapport” and 
skill-tree system; and at $4m some new mini-games.

Suzuki has not ruled out releasing Shenmue 3 for other platforms. “Currently 
we are planning development only for PC (Windows) and PS4. Other platforms have 
not been decided yet,” he wrote, while confirming that original publisher Sega 
has granted a licence to use the name Shenmue.

With a month to go in the crowdfunding campaign, Shenmue 3 has a shot at 
becoming the most-funded game in Kickstarter history – a title currently held by
Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night 
<https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night>, 
which raised $5.5m by the end of its campaign in mid-June 2015.

It is not the most crowdfunded game of all time, however. That would be Star 
Citizen, an ambitious space-epic thatraised $2.1m on Kickstarter in 2012 
<https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen> but has gone on to 
raise $84.1m through its own website
