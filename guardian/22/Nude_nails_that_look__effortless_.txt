“Effortless”. This is what we’re calling the nude nail now. It’s the 2016 
alternative to the French manicure. It’s similar in that it’s meant to look as 
if you are totally together, but without the white tip – surely the least 
effective way of pretending you have clean nails. This look says you’re in 
control, but too busy for fripperies like “colour”. Make any nude work with 
your skintone by experimenting with coats. One layer for the whitest skin, then 
go heavier from there. See, effortless.
