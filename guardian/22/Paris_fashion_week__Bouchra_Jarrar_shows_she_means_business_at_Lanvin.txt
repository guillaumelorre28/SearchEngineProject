Bouchra Jarrar’s first show for Lanvin at Paris fashion week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/paris-fashion-week> kicked off at noon on 
Wednesday, under bright lights at the Hôtel de Ville. This represents a shift 
for the French fashion house. Under the direction of Alber Elbaz for 14 years, 
Lanvin was always an evening show often soundtracked with disco. The time and 
place announced a new mood and the clothes in the collection were like night 
and day, too.


The first look was an ivory jacket worn over a satin shirt dress. This was 
followed by a chiffon kilt, pyjama suiting in pinstripes, floaty floral gowns 
and embellished vests. Most looks came with jewelled flowers pinned somewhere, 
and embellishment was everywhere.


These were clothes that fit into women’s lives – or the lifestyles of women 
who can afford luxury fashion, anyway. Nothing was even slightly avant garde: 
classic glamour was the general theme. A lot of the designs looked ready for 
the corporate balls of its wealthy customers, a white satin ruched gown, an 
asymmetric ivory dress with black sash, a black satin dress cut to skim the 
body, sandals with diamanté chain-mail cuff.

Some pieces had an off-duty feel, such as a loose embellished top with 
oversized cardigan and flat sandals, a biker jacket or tailored trousers. 
Critics might grumble about the lack of Elbaz-like runway razzle-dazzle, but 
real life has reachedLanvin <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/lanvin> in the 
hands of Jarrar.

Jarrar, dressed in a chic satin shirt and black trousers, answered questions 
backstage through a translator. While hugging her son, she said she found the 
legacy of Jeanne Lanvin – who founded the house in 1889, originally designing 
clothes for her daughter Marguerite – very inspiring.


“It was effortless to find the connection,” she said. “I wanted to mix the 
intellectual with the creative.” And the romantic, Jarrar was asked? “Tous jours
,” came the reply. Jarrar was named artistic director of the house in March. 
“Her timeless style is in keeping with the style and the values of our 
company,” said chief executive Michèle Huiban.

The 45-year-old designer worked as the studio director under Nicolas 
Ghesquiere at Balenciaga and in the couture department of Christian Lacroix. 
She launched her own brand in 2010 and joined the couture schedule in 2013. Her 
designs quickly gained a cult following of women who liked the clean lines of 
minimalism at the top end of luxury.


Paris fashion week: chic is out and cool is in

Elbaz left Lanvin in October of 2015. His louche designs and comedic 
personality – complete with signature bow tie and spectacles – stood for Lanvin 
during his reign. He was much liked in fashion and at his HQ, with the Lanvin 
team protesting his departure. He has since described his exit as “his 
tragedy”. It is widely believed that Elbaz was pushed out of Lanvin by the 
house’s financiers, led by majority shareholder Shaw-Lan Wang who bought Lanvin 
in 2001, and originally recruited Elbaz.


Profits have certainly declined in recent years, from £10.25m in 2012 to £2.5m 
in 2014. In that context, Jarrar’s collection makes a lot of sense.

If Lanvin was about commerce, other shows on Wednesday were at the more 
artistic end of fashion.

Maison Margiela, under the direction of John Galliano, was a mash-up of 
sportswear and classic French staples. Trench coats were reworked as dresses 
and models in brightly coloured headgear wore outfits featuring wetsuits, 
boxing boots, camping gear and tweed suiting. It was an eclectic mix or, as the 
show notes said, a collection with “intrinsic strangeness”.

Dries Van Noten’s show is always a favourite of the arty-inclined fashion 
crowd. Huge photogenic bouquets of flowers frozen in ice, made by artist Makoto 
Azuma, dotted the catwalk. The show delivered clothes that would fit in at the 
crowds at London’s Frieze art fair. There were jet-beaded dresses and coats, 
chrysanthemum prints and wide coats with graphic prints akin to a De Kooning 
painting. A finale to an a capella of Madonna’s song Frozen was a fitting 
oddity that ensured Van Noten’s place in the art camp.
