It’s almost pitch black as I freewheel down the hill, a warm breeze in my 
hair. It’s 2am and I’m cycling around the streets of Mumbai. Those who have 
visited India’s largest city might question my sanity, but I’ve joined a new 
cycling tour for visitors who want to see another side of the metropolis. Its 
starts at midnight and ends as the sun rises.

By day, Mumbai – one of the world’s most populated cities, with more than 20 
million inhabitants – rages like a beast unharnessed. The chaos, with giant 
open-air laundries alongside designer shops, street markets and Bollywood 
cinemas, is all-engulfing. But as I step out into the night from my hotel in 
the touristy Colaba district, the streets are almost deserted, the usual 
bumper-to-bumper traffic vanished.

Night cycling is the latest offering from Reality Tours, a company known for 
slum visits. Winner of last year’sWTTC Tourism For Tomorrow Community Award 
<http://www.wttc.org/tourism-for-tomorrow-awards/winners-and-finalists-2016/winners-and-finalists-2015/>
, it aims to raise awareness of the realities of slum life and show tourists 
how to visit one responsibly. It gives 80% of its profit back to sister NGO 
Reality Gives, mostly for the benefit of people in Dharavi – the slum they 
visit, which is said to be one of the world’s biggest.

Our trip takes in all the city’s main sights. We begin at the Gateway of 
India, Mumbai’s best-recognised landmark. Without the daytime queues of 
tourists and touts, the illuminated grand arch stands in peace.

Opposite is the Taj Mahal Palace, India’s most famous hotel, made infamous by 
the 2008 terror attacks. By day imposing white-uniformed, turbaned doormen 
welcome guests, but at this hour only the security guards sitting in an 
armoured vehicle (a permanent fixture since the attacks) are awake.

We munch snacks on the white steps sweeping up to the Greco-Roman-style 
Asiatic Society Library, which is regularly used as a location in Bollywood 
films. Next is the grand Chhatrapati Shivaji railway station (formerly Victoria 
Terminus), built in 1887 and featuring gothic arches, pencil-point turrets and 
animal faces carved into the stone. By day, waves of commuters flow through 
here, piling on and off packed commuter trains.

We sail through Zaveri Bazaar, the city’s main jewellery market. “Here men 
sweep the streets each morning searching for leftover gold,” Suraj says.

Yet it’s the shrouds of blankets lining the streets that are staggering – 
cocooned bodies are everywhere, some under mosquito nets, others inside 
makeshift tents taken down each morning. With few street lights, the scantily 
lit buildings take on a raw, almost ethereal, beauty.

Along palm tree-lined Marine Drive – nicknamed the Queen’s Necklace because 
the lights resemble a string of pearls – the art deco buildings remind me of 
Miami. Plastic collectors are out and about as we jump off our bikes and walk 
by the Arabian Sea, buying chai from sellers on bicycles.

 Rest stop at Marin Drive 
Then it’s an uphill puff, past a man riding a bike laden with giant urns of 
milk. We stop at Banganga Tank, a large pool of holy water by a temple which, 
supposedly, has a healing underground spring. “Hindus believe this water comes 
from the Ganges,” Suraj says. A couple of people are bathing in the moonlight.

Close by, the city’s Hanging Gardens are shrouded in thick foliage. “Here in 
the Tower of Silence, Parsees (followers of the Zoroastrian faith) lay their 
dead to protect the elements from being polluted by burial or cremation,” Suraj 
tells us. Instead – until recently at least – bodies were eaten by vultures in 
a centuries-old tradition, though this has been stopped because of a shortage 
of the birds.

House prices around here are as steep as the hill we’re cycling up. Outside 
the towering 27 stories of the Antilia building, said to be the world’s most 
expensive private property, are hordes of armed guards. “It cost over a billion 
dollars to build,” Suraj exclaims.

 Banganga Tank, an ancient holy spring surrounded by Hindu temples 
Excess moves into asceticism as we wander into the rainbow-coloured Jain 
temple, where a few worshippers, dressed in white robes, are already hard at 
prayer. They have white scarves are tied around their mouths. “Jains believe 
you can’t kill anything, not even insects, so they wear these to avoid 
accidentally breathing them in,” says Suraj.

Then it’s past the Haji Ali Dargah mosque, which stands on an islet in the 
sea. On the promenade opposite, people are jogging and exercising before the 
day hots up. As we approach our final stop, Worli Fort, a priest is waving 
smoke over statues of gods and drums bang. It’s the morningpuja in a nearby 
temple. We sit high up on the ramparts looking down on the fishing community 
below.

Syrupy yellow light is filtering between skyscrapers of the Worli district as 
we cycle back through narrow lanes, where women are making flower garlands and 
children are hurrying to school. The city is waking up again.
