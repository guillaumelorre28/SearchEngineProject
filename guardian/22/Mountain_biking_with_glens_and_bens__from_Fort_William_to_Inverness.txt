Down in Fort William, under a vault of blue sky and the Ben Nevis massif all 
snow-covered, I stand by my bike next to the sea loch and my guide, Tim 
Francis, from Wilderness Scotland. This is the start of the 117km-Great Glen 
Way that will take us east all the way to Inverness.

There is a constant stream of people, all on two feet, not two wheels, despite 
the fact that this path is also designed for bikes. Why are they here? “Because 
it leads on from theWest Highland Way <http://www.west-highland-way.co.uk/>, 
which we did last year,” says a group of five men from Leeds. “Because of the 
Loch Ness monster,” says a French lady, laughing. “Because it’s flat,” says a 
man from Cambridge. Tim raises a sceptical eyebrow for my benefit. “Not 
exactly,” he whispers.

 Wilderness Scotland guide Tim Francis on the shore of Loch Linnhe 
And me? I’m here to test it out as a long-distance mountain bike route since, 
with some recent upgrades and new sections, it is proving hugely popular – 
24,573 people completed the trail in 2014, according to Scottish government 
figures. But then, Britain has more than 1,600long-distance paths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/23/british-walks-uk-family-long-distance-paths-trails>
, and most are overgrown and unloved. What makes this route such a success?

I’m not a mountain biker and I need a gentle introduction to the art. The 
previous evening I’d gone with Tim to the Witch’s trail, the site of the World 
Mountain Bike downhill championship. There I discovered that riding a 
full-suspension bike with fat tyres is nothing like a road bike. On a road 
bike, 117km disappears with relative ease. On steep hills, you stand and pedal 
harder. If there is gravel, you avoid it. Now I can’t avoid the gravel and on 
hills when I stand to pedal harder, the rear wheel slips and I fall off. This 
could be a long two days.

 On the Witch’s trail near Fort William with Ben Nevis behind 
The first couple of hours are easy enough. Tim and I slip through Fort William 
and along the shores of Loch Linnhe, where I’d spotted a sea otter the night 
before, then take a broad towpath alongside the Caledonian canal. At Gairlochy, 
we cross the canal before joining a soft pine-needle trail that swings down to 
the shores of Loch Lochy, one of the lakes that Thomas Telford used to sneak 
his waterway across Scotland. Away to our right, the views of Ben Nevis are 
magnificent and banks of primroses line the route. At Laggan Locks, we eat 
lunch onThe Eagle <http://eaglebargeinn.weebly.com/>, a barge-cum-cafe.

 Crossing the bridge at Invermoriston 
After lunch, we tackle the first tricky climb out of Invergarry and I manage 
to keep my seat, leaning forward. “Blow on the wheel!” Tim shouts. I’m almost 
kissing it, wishing I hadn’t had that second Tunnock’s teacake. But the climb 
relents and we are soon swooping down to Bridge of Oich, then along the canal 
into Fort Augustus. Day One is complete. It’s been 59km and, to my surprise, 
512 metres of climbing. We stay at theLovat Hotel <https://www.thelovat.com/>, 
which I’d recommend for its beer menu alone. Tim watches me drinking: “It can 
be steep tomorrow.”

I order haggis and steak for dinner. Next morning, I have haggis for 
breakfast. The local butcher,Macdougall 
<http://enjoylochness.com/activities/d-j-macdougall-butcher>, has an 
irresistible secret recipe. When I get back on my bike, the suspension groans.

 The ancient Caledonian forest forms part of the route 
Almost immediately, the route rears up to lungbuster steepness. Pine cones 
speckle the track like discarded sausages and my haggis turbo fails to kick in. 
I walk.

I order haggis for dinner. Next morning, I have haggis for breakfast. When I 
get back on my bike, the suspension groans

Despite this start, I am soon revelling in the day: the golden shafts of 
sunlight on the mossy atolls of the forest floor, the long swathes of 
primroses, and the flicker of light on a running deer’s back. I’m getting 
better at balancing my weight on the climbs: keeping my backside back but chest 
forward and low.

Before the descent into Drumnadrochit, we pause at Grotaig pottery and cafe, a 
great spot for a break. This area feels increasingly alternative and quirky. We 
meet a couple driving two calves along the path. “Their mothers rejected them, 
so now they’re part of the family.” And there is a lovely trackside, 
self-service cafe in a hobbity shelter with home-made cakes in baskets.

I’m starting to hope that we might spot a wild haggis, the creature is 
rumoured to live here. If you don’t believe, there is one – appropriately 
stuffed – in Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Museum.

 The Caledonian Canal at Neptunes Staircase locks near Fort William 
After Drumnadrochit, we climb higher into a forest that was once home to wolf, 
bear, moose and lynx, but now all that remains are some glorious remnants of 
the Caledonian forest, actually a fairly open woodland of gnarled Scots pines.

Just as we hit what feels like the remotest, wildest section, we start to see 
hand-painted signs: Bovril, hot coffee, fresh eggs, and we cycle into Sandra 
Dee’s eccentric cafe, miles from utilities such as piped water and electricity. 
There is camping, too, but after a short break we press on and roll downhill, 
finally, into Inverness and our finish point under the skirts of Flora 
MacDonald, the bronze statue that is outside Inverness Castle. Day Two was 64km 
plus 1,300 metres climbed.

 Journey’s end … Inverness Castle and the statue of Flora MacDonald 
So what does make a great long-distance path? I would say variety of landscape 
with some panoramic highlights – and those views only come with climbs. Then 
the kind of people you meet – although some might prefer the solitary pleasures 
of those forgotten paths. And finally, of course, the quality of the food and 
drink, particularly the haggis. The Great Glen Way passes all the tests.
