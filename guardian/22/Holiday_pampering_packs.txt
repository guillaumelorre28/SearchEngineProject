The point of a travel set is not simply to ensure you can wash the sand out of 
your hair after an afternoon napping under the new Safran Foer. No. It is to 
complete the illusion that a holiday is a truly relaxing treat – to add a 
spa-like mystique to your lacklustre Airbnb shower. That means oils, lotions, 
serums and shampoo far posher than you could usually afford. With the right 
conditioner, your holidaywill feel like more than just a new Wi-Fi code.
