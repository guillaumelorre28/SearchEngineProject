Sabalibougou district school is set back from the main road, a block away from 
the right bank of the river Niger in Bamako. Next door is the daily sheep 
market. The broad open area between the school and the road, which appears at 
first the perfect area for a boisterous game of football, is in fact land 
recently cleared of informal housing. The local authority has plans to develop 
here.

The immaculate schoolyard hosts 4,500 pupils from years one to nine, all on 
one site. The set-up is typical for state schools in urban areas. InMali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mali>, as in France, public school students 
wear what they like or have; the students who pass by in uniform are heading to 
private schools.

It costs 1,500 central African francs ($2.50; £1.67) a year to study at 
Sabalibougou, but there are still parents who cannot muster the fee. Private 
schools in the city can charge anything from $1,200 to $8,000 a year.

Students stay in their block from grades one to six, the first “cycle”, before 
moving up a section for grades seven to nine. Beyond that, some leave the 
school system while others head for the upper school, or “lycée”.

 A student washes his hands outside section “F” in Sabalibougou district 
school, Bamako 
The milieu is distinctive, but the challenges facing the school, its students 
and its staff – lack of funding, overstretched facilities, large classes, a 
dearth of teacher training, children failing to progress to secondary education 
in sufficient numbers – reflect a pattern discernible across many developing 
regions.

The school monitors absences carefully. There are many reasons that prevent 
students coming to school here, but money is part of the story.


Adama Issa Diarra is the director of school “F”, one of the eight sections 
within the compound.

“Sometimes we notice that some students don’t come to school, mainly due to 
the fact that many families are still poor. Sometimes some students don’t even 
eat before coming here and parents feel ill at ease. When it comes to paying 
school fees – because we have to collect the fees – we tell parents, ‘If you 
don’t pay, we’ll be obliged to ask your kids to remain at home’. Some parents, 
because they don’t have money, just decide that their kids won’t come until 
they get some money.”

 School director Adama Issa Diarra says non-attendance is often down to tight 
household finances 
The school gives parents the option to pay step by step. Even then, some are 
not able to meet the deadline. But money is not the only factor that prevents 
all local children from enrolling, says Diarra.

“Unfortunately, there are still some families who don’t accept sending the 
kids to these kind[s] of public schools. Some want to send their kids to 
Islamic schools, which are very different from our system. Some just don’t want 
to send their kids to school because they help them in the farms, or they use 
their kids for other things to get money..”

In a packed ninth-grade classroom, some of the school’s oldest students 
squeeze on to benches. Exercise books are open, and the teacher has written the 
aim of the lesson on the blackboard: today it is “récitation”. The first two 
students, both girls, rather shyly deliver their accounts to the class of 
nearly 100. But then the form’s star steps forward to make his case with gusto.

 A ninth grade student delivers a sparkling presentation 
About 70-80% of the children who start school in Sabalibougou complete the 
basic level. From there, only half go on to secondary school. Diarra says this 
is down to the challenge of passing the last class. “Many kids have to take the 
classes many times and finally, at a given time – when they’ve taken it two or 
three times – you’re obliged to send them out. So unfortunately it’s [only] 
about 50% who succeed.”

 Space is at a premium in ninth grade classrooms 
Looking around the school, there is little sign of a gender gap for those 
successfully completing basic education. Secondary level graduation is a 
different matter, however.

“Unfortunately, many girls don’t succeed in finishing their secondary school,” 
says Diarra. “We have two main issues. The first is that they get married 
early, or too early. The second one is unwanted pregnancies; when these occur, 
most of the girls have to stop school.”

It’s break time now. As students pour out into the courtyard, two children 
share their plans for the future.

Fanta Bamba, 14, says she likes school very much and particularly enjoys 
learning English. “I would like to continue my studies. I’m very lucky because 
my family allows me, as a girl, to continue. So I will make the most of this 
opportunity to finish my studies.”

Fanta has yet to decide what she wants to do when she leaves school. “It’s not 
very clear in my mind, but I would like to get a very good job where I can have 
enough money and have a good life and also help my parents.”

Her friend, Bourama Fomba, 13, would like to go on to lycée after finishing. 
He has given careful consideration to what comes next. “When I finish my 
studies, I would like to find a good job in an office, or even to become a 
minister – why not?”

But such aspirations are a challenge to nurture when there are 80 pupils in 
Bourama’s class, and 82 in Fanta’s.

 Fanta Bamba, 14, right, says her favourite subject is English. Bourama Fomba, 
13, is a Manchester City fan and keen football player 
Diarra ponders the biggest difficulties facing the country’s teachers. “We 
have a few key challenges: we have a large number of students per class, [and] 
sometimes when teachers have too many students in their class the quality of 
the teaching will decrease.”

He would like to see more opportunities for teacher training, especially 
continuing professional development. Teachers also lack resources to deliver 
some lessons, says Diarra: “Sometimes teachers don’t have enough – or 
appropriate – materials … it’s very, very difficult.”

As director, Diarra supports other staff.

“We try to assist the teachers in the class, sometimes we even give them 
model, simple classes as we teach and make them observe and learn from that 
observation.”

But with large classes and relatively limited resources, motivation is a key 
issue, says Diarra.


“This is the problem, the system is not really improving because sometimes 
there is a lack of training for teachers and sometimes the training is not very 
adapted to the situation and there is a lack of teaching materials, so it’s 
very difficult for teachers even to apply what they’ve been learning.”

 Ninth grade students at Sabalibougou district school 
Unsurprisingly, only a minority of school F pupils will make it to university. 
Those who do will study alongside students who have come up through the private 
school system.

“It’s very sad to say,” says Diarra, “but poor families tend to send their 
kids to public schools and, of course, rich families prefer to send their 
children to private schools, where maybe it’s better organised and with more 
possibilities, more materials and so on.”

Bourama, though, remains upbeat. “If I have a chance to talk to people in the 
world, I would like them to understand that here in Mali it’s not very easy but 
students are serious [hard-working]. We are really doing our best to move 
forward, because we are aware what an opportunity – for both boys and girls – 
going to school represents.”
