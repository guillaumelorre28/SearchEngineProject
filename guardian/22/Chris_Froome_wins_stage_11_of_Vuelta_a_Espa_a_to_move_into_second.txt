The Colombian Quintana, who also races for Movistar, retained the lead, 54 
seconds ahead of Froome while Valverde is 1min 5 sec adrift.

Froome, bronze medallist in the time trial at the Olympics in Rio, was 
delighted to have won the stage, conquering the same peak that he also won in 
the 2011 Vuelta, where he finished second.

The 31-year-old, who is looking to clinch a Tour and Vuelta double, told 
Spanish TVE: “I had special memories from 2011. It’s an incredible feeling. 
Quintana is really strong at the moment. He has the leader’s jersey. I’m just 
trying to do as much as I can day by day. Obviously I can get closer to him.

“After the season I’ve had, it’s a bit tough at the moment so I want to thank 
my team mates and my family for the support.”

Following Tuesday’s rest day, the 168.6km stage, which started in Colunga, 
began at a high pace, with the average speed in the opening two hours at 
46.6kph.

“Froome was faster than I was at the end,” Quintana told TVE. “I keep thinking 
he is very strong and we will have to be careful because we have difficult 
stages ahead.”

Thursday’s stage is a 193.2km ride from Los Corrales de Buelna to Bilbao. The 
race finishes on 11 September in Madrid.
