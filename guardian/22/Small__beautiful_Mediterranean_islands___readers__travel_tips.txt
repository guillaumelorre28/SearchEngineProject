Winning tip: Walking on Sifnos, Greece


Sifnos, in the Cyclades, provides a mix of beautiful beaches with a few cafes, 
restaurants and bars. There are great hiking trails that will lead you to 
remote, quiet beaches; and delightful hilltop villages with independent 
boutiques and tavernas. Thehiking trails <http://www.sifnostrails.com/> of over 
100km are well signposted and maintained by the authorities with a website that 
provides details of each trail (difficulty level, point of interest, distance 
and more) and detailed, downloadable GPS maps. We particularly likedtrail 4 
<http://www.sifnostrails.com/portfolio-items/trail-4/>, a loop that offers 
great panoramic views, solitude, and two beaches to ourselves at Fikyada. For a 
sundowner and dinner, head to Apollonia and don’t miss the bakeries that offer 
traditional Greek pastries and baked goods.Melopita, a cheese pie with honey, 
is a must. I stayed atVilla Antoniadis <http://www.villa-antoniadis.gr/en/> 
(from €50 a night) at Platis Gialos: it’s a B&B five minutes’ walk inland from 
the beach. It has a large pool and friendly owners, who serve delicious and 
indulging breakfasts.

Astypalaia, Greece

 Traditional house at Κalderimi ‘hotel’ 
This butterfly-shaped island in the Dodecanese is the true arthropod of the 
Mediterranean. Three minutes away from Livadi beach isKalderimi “hotel” 
<http://www.kalderimi.gr/> – actually a group of traditionally built houses 
(doubles from £50 a night B&B) with a clear view of 13th-century Guerini 
Castle’s Venetian splendour. While staying on this isolated island, we felt 
truly at peace with the world. Among the island’s attractions are itscaves 
<http://www.kalderimi.gr/en/sight/caves>, with fantastic formations of 
stalactities and stalagmites. Caves have always been a part of Greek mythology 
and Astypalaia has some glorious examples.

On the trail of Leonard Cohen, Hydra, Greece

<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/21/my-lunch-with-marianne-ihlen-leonard-cohen-muse>
 – with some ingenuity and just a little local help we managed to find the 
house he bought back in the 1960s. Later that day the mature lady sitting at 
the table next to ours at a taverna told us that she had known Cohen – but in 
what capacity we never quite found out!Hydra, which is just off the 
Peloponnese, is a one-hour trip from Piraeus

 byHellenic Seaways Flying Dolphin 
<https://hellenicseaways.gr/en/routes/view/30> (from about €50 return). It has 
no motorised vehicles and a harbourside to die for. Boat trips will take you to 
idyllic beaches.

Bozcaada, Turkey

This island in the north-eastern Aegean is an intriguing meld of Greek and 
Turkish culture. The town centre boasts a mosque and Ottoman architecture as 
well as a church and whitewashed cottages. Beaches are crowd-free; eating out 
is amazing value and locals are welcoming. Cycle through a landscape of olive 
groves and vineyards, stopping to sample the excellentlocal wines 
<http://www.bozcaada.info/wine>. Or head for Bozcaada Castle with its wonderful 
view of the coast. In the evening, make your way to the Polente Feneri 
(lighthouse) with a picnic from the market: bread, thyme-scented honey, 
rose-petal and tomato jam, and drink in the sublime sunset.
 The island is 30 minutes by boat

Salina, Italy

 The village of Santa Marina, Salina. Photograph: Alamy 
Lipari is probably the most popular of the Aeolian islands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jul/31/aeolian-islands-cookery-holidays-jeremy-head>
, but Salina is the one for me – it seems to be the closest to how the islands 
were before commercialisation took hold. If going for the day and sailing from, 
say, Milazzo, alight from the ferry at Rinella and take the small bus across 
the island to Santa Marina Salina. The journey takes a while, with a long(ish) 
stop on the outskirts of Malfa, but it really gives you a flavour of the island 
– it’s the setting for many scenes in the 1994 film Il Postino.

Solitude and prehistoric art, Levanzo, Italy

 Photograph: Alamy 
The Egadi islands, off north-west Sicily, are less known than the Aeolian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jul/31/aeolian-islands-cookery-holidays-jeremy-head>
 and are still home to the old fisherman lifestyle of the region. Levanzo, 10 
minutes by hydrofoil from the larger Favignana, is ideal for those seeking 
peace and quiet and the opportunity to lose themselves amid wild and fragrant 
nature. It has only one village, the attractive Cala Dogana, and a scattering 
of stony beaches with crystal clear water. One of the island’s draws isLa 
Grotta del Genovese <http://www.grottadelgenovese.it/ENG/index.htm>, a cave – 
only discovered in 1949 – with graffiti and rock paintings up to 12,000 years 
old, which is accessible on foot, by boat and 4WD (2-hour tours, booking only).

Porquerolles, France

 Photograph: Alamy 
A great island for cyclists and walkers is Porquerolles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/07/20-undiscovered-island-gems>, 
off the coast of Provence. No cars are allowed on this, the largest and 
liveliest of the Iles d’Hyères, but it can be explored by a series of paths 
across its steep southern reaches, passing plenty of secluded bathing places. 
Ferries to the island run fromHyères 
<http://www.hyeres-tourism.co.uk/en-hyeres/porquerolles/shuttle-boats> (€19 
return, 15 mins) and Toulon.

A day out on Formentera, Spain

 Photograph: Alamy 
Take the morning ferry from Ibiza over to the small, flat island of 
Formentera. It takes up to an hour and there are several companies operating 
lots of ferries (tryAquabus <http://www.aquabusferryboats.com/en> from about 
€19 return). Upon arrival, hire bicycles from the port, or take your driving 
licence to get mopeds. Whiz around the island between the salt flats, before 
stopping for lunch atTiburon <http://tiburon-formentera.com/> (Playa Cavall 
d’en Borás), which is right on the beach. Take a dip in the clear waters and 
get a natural fish-pedicure for free … have a snooze on the beach before 
cycling the mile or so back to get the evening ferry, admiring the sunset as 
you speed back over to Ibiza. A perfect day out.

Vis, Croatia

 Komiza town on Vis. Photograph: Alamy 
The furthest inhabited island from the Croatian mainland is easy to reach 
(ferry from Split), but feels a world away. The fishing town of Komiža seems to 
exist in a time warp. Fishermen still fish, and it’s got a nice, 
slightly-rough-around-the-edges feel. There are cute little houses, a string of 
sheltered pebbly beaches, fresh seafood and the best gelato this side of Italy. 
The best accommodation options are the fishermen’s houses right on the harbour, 
which are very reasonably priced (but be prepared for some retro furnishings). 
The best spot in the Med by a mile.

Korčula, Croatia

 Lumbarda bay, Korcula. Photograph: Alamy 
This island, served by ferries from several mainland towns, and the islands of 
Hvar and Mljet <http://www.korculainfo.com/ferries/>, is held by many to be the 
birthplace of Marco Polo. A museum in Korčula Town celebrates the adventurer’s 
travels in China by admitting Chinese visitors free of charge. A steep ascent 
to the top of what is said to be his family home’s tower repaid us with a 
bird’s eye view over the narrow streets and alleyways of the town. Taking a 
short bus journey to Lumbarda, a little village east of the town, we swam and 
sunbathed on the nearby quiet sandy beaches. The Greeks planted the first 
vineyards in this area over 2,000 years ago, so we ended the day with a glass 
or two of grk, the excellent local white wine.
