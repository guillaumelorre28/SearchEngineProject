The mobile game sensation Pokémon Go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go> has altered the lives of 
the more than 20 million people who’ve downloaded it over the past week, but it 
has also affected the thousands of businesses that find themselves situated 
near one of the game’s many hotspots – both for good and ill.

In tech-crazed San Francisco – where a scheduled Pokémon Go crawl 
<https://www.facebook.com/events/1779733858973460/> is expected to draw nearly 
6,000 players next week – local business owners couldn’t help noticing throngs 
of people in front of their establishments, huddled around their phones tossing 
Pokéballs around.

“I did my research,” said Rich, an imposing figure with a bullet-shaped head 
who minds the door at The Gold Club, a gentleman’s bar in the city’s south of 
market district. “They got 7 million more people signed up this week than last. 
The kids come by, they’re like 20 or 25, they just collect their points and 
move on. But I can see them bringing their dads along to come in for a drink.”

Diana Roman, an employee of Cafe Germain Creperies, just down the road from 
the Gold Club, thinks it would be a great idea to put a Pokémon character in 
front of her business to draw more customers. “Can you do that? Really? That 
would be awesome. I just started playing,” she said. “I’m on Level 4,” her 
colleague Priscilla Rico boasted.

The game works through a smartphone’s camera overlaying some 250 Pokémon 
characters into real-world settings. Players capture these creatures by 
throwing Pokéballs at them, which they collect at various interesting places 
such as historic landmarks or graffiti walls. Players slowly “level up” during 
the game until they reach the status of Pokémon trainer, where they can take a 
passel of captured creatures to a Pokégym (do keep up)and teach them how to 
fight. And they can also purchase objects to use inside the game, which is how 
Nintendo and its partners are making a reported $1.6m per day from the free 
download.

Pokémon Go is not the first augmented reality (AR) game to use real-world 
locations as its playing field. Its predecessor,Ingress 
<https://www.ingress.com/>, was created by the same company, former Google 
subsidiaryNiantic <https://www.nianticlabs.com/>. Pokémon Go and Ingress share 
the same user-generated location database, only in Ingress the hotspots are 
called “portals”, and there are no cute fuzzy Pokémon creatures to capture.

A handful of companies have purchased “sponsored locations” in Ingress, paying 
Niantic a few pennies for every player drawn to the site. In an interview with 
theFinancial Times 
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/75942b12-48ba-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c.html#ixzz4EQpO2FTW>
, CEO John Hanke said Niantic plans to pursue the same strategy with Pokémon 
Go, which is significantly more popular. He said companies will be able to pay 
to be featured in the virtual game because it will drive foot traffic.

Lewis Ward, IDC’s research director for gaming, doesn’t expect Niantic to roll 
out sponsored locations forPokémon Go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go> any time soon. For the 
short term, he says, Niantic will concentrate on upgrading its infrastructure 
to handle the unexpected demand on its servers – which has caused some outages 
– as well as adding more locations, more things to buy in the app and new 
content.

“This is by far the most successful AR game ever,” says Ward. “It’s spawning 
changes in behavior and opening up new possibilities for revenue that have 
never been tangible before. I’m sure companies not on Niantic’s map will want 
to opt in, while some who don’t want people snooping around their place of 
business may want to opt out.”

He also expects to see a rush of AR apps attempting to duplicate Pokémon Go’s 
surprising success. In the meantime, enterprising Pokémon-savvy businesses are 
finding their own workarounds.

The only problem is they’re taking all of the parking from real customers
Maria Kambatta, Beach Chalet restaurant 
L’inizio Pizza Bar in Queens, New York, increased its walk-in business by 75% 
– andmade national headlines 
<https://nypost.com/2016/07/12/pokemania-runs-wild-through-city-causing-crime-accidents/>
 in the process – by taking advantage of its location next to a Pokéstop. 
Restaurant manager Sean Benedetti purchased so-called “lure modules” (costing 
80 cents to $1 a piece) inside the game and set them outside the restaurant. 
Each module lasts for 30 minutes, attracting creatures to them – as well as 
players who wish to capture them.

But not every small business owner is ready to embrace his or her inner 
Pokémon trainer. Maria Kambatta is a concierge at Beach Chalet, a restaurant 
and brewery in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park. The restaurant has become a 
popular Pokéstop, with at least 250 people a day stopping by solely for the 
game over the last week.


“We’re not complaining,” she said. “The only problem is they’re taking all of 
the parking from real customers ... and now our customers are saying they have 
to go quite a distance to find parking. It’s unusual. It’s absolutely because 
of Pokémon.” The huge crowds weren’t helping business, Kambatta added, because 
the Pokémon fans aren’t dining in. “They come in looking at their phones ... 
They just go in and out.”

Giulio Tempesta is the proprietor of Umbria, an Italian restaurant in central 
San Francisco. He almost spits when the topic of Pokémon Go is brought up. 
“About a dozen people came by asking about it today,” he says. “I got 250 
people in here for lunch, you think I have time to be interrupted by a bunch of 
kids asking me stupid questions? I think it’s time we got back to the concept 
of communicating with each other face to face, the way our parents did.”

Umbria’s bartender Ally Ramos – maybe a generation or two younger than 
Tempesta – thinks Pokémon Go is a great way to get kids to leave the house, 
meet up and talk to each other. She’s planning to create a special drink named 
after one of the Pokémon characters.
