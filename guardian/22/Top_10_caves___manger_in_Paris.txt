Caves à Manger – wine bars with a difference – are popping up all over Paris 
at the moment, offering the combination of a stunning selection of reasonably 
priced wines that are usually organic, biodynamic or “natural” low-sulphite, 
accompanied by French-style deli snacks. These new-generation wine shops have a 
special licence that allows drinking on the premises only if customers order 
something to eat. The deal is that wines display their takeaway price, usually 
starting at €8-€9 a bottle, then adroit de bouchon (corkage) of €4-€8 is added 
for serving along with at least one of the tempting list of sharing plates on 
offer:planches of charcuterie and cheese, or more gourmet dishes such as 
grilled octopus with aubergine. Here’s our pick of 10 great caves across the 
city, plus a tip on which wine to order from eachcaviste.

Wine lovers are spoiled for choice in the Marais district, from Versant Vins 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Versant-Vins/286736374687607> in the buzzing 
Marché des Enfants Rouges to newcomers such asMonsieur Henri 
<https://www.facebook.com/monsieurhenri>, already crowded every night. But it 
is difficult to find a better spot than friendly Le Barav, which still has the 
feel of a neighbourhood hangout rather than the latestbourgeois bohème (bobo) 
flavour of the week. At first, Barav looks like a classic bistrot as, apart 
from a host of tapas-style plates, it does a range of main dishes such as duck 
shepherds pie or grilled sausage with lentils. A dozen wines by the glass can 
be chosen from the blackboard but if you ask for a bottle you’ll realise this 
is a unique cave à manger as the waitress asks you to go next door and choose 
from one of the 300 vintages stocked in its cellar. The friendly caviste, Stan, 
gives helpful advice, and you take your bottle back to the table for the 
waitress to open.

Although it is right by the Boulevard Saint-Germain and the iconic Institut du 
Monde Arabe <http://www.imarabe.org/>, the 5e Cru is very much an 
under-the-radar address. This chameleon cave à manger attracts a loyal 
collection of colourful Rive Gauche locals at lunchtime, drawn as much by the 
changingplat du jour that owner/chef/sommelier Jean de Rotalier serves for just 
€10, as his stellar list of 250 organic wines. Then at night, a trendier, 
wine-fanatic crowd converges from all over Paris, along with a smattering of 
curious tourists. Jean does no cooked food in the evening, but there is still a 
long list of sharing plates like mackerel marinated in Sancerre, scallop 
rillettes, and duck breast with foie gras. There are always 10-12 wines 
available by the glass, starting at €4

The Quincave may be one of the few wine cellars that does not serve by the 
glass, but with bottles starting at €9 and a plate ofsaucisson from Ardèche, 
Cantal cheese or rustic terrine costing €5, it is no surprise that this cosy 
locale is packed most nights. Customers perch on bar stools made from barrel 
staves and garrulous owner Fred Belkamp is a mine of information as he has 
personally tracked down most of the makers of the couple of hundred wines he 
stocks. Fred is a pioneer caviste, opening 12 years ago in this lively Left 
Bank street near legendary Montparnasse brasserie La Coupole. Squeezed between 
the wine are bottles of craft beer, olive oil, artisan vinegar, rum, sake and 
potent fruit brandies. And don’t be surprised to see clients disappearing 
through a side door behind the bar counter – they are just heading for the 
outdoor loo at the back of the courtyard.

Pratz is one of the newer caves à manger. It is in the fashionable Sopi (south 
of Pigalle) neighbourhood. Owner Thomas Babot offers an inspired selection of 
biodynamic or natural wines and creates delicious tapas in an open kitchen. 
Apart from plates of chorizo, serrano ham, and mozzarella and burrata, he has a 
daily selection of gourmet sandwiches stuffed with the likes of truffle-scented 
ham, melted provolone and sun-dried tomatoes. His 100-strong selection of wines 
begins at €8.90 a bottle, while half-a-dozen by the glass are priced from 
€4-€7. Babot has also had the clever idea of offering asac apéro, a chic cotton 
picnic bag of cheese and charcuterie, half a baguette, a bottle of wine and 
plastic glasses, all for €19.

Rue Sainte-Marthe and its cobbled square are a goldmine of cheap-and-cheerful 
bohemian restaurants and now La Cave à Michel is one of the hottest new 
addresses for wine and food lovers. It is a joint venture between chef Romain 
Tischenko and caviste Fabrice Mansouri. Tischenko shot to fame when he won 
France’s Masterchef and with the winnings opened his own restaurant, Le 
Galopin, in Place Sainte-Marthe. Last year he joined forces with Mansouri and, 
during the day, La Cave à Michel operates as a normal wine shop, but from 
6.30pm Tischenko comes over from Le Galopin to spend the evening cooking 
gourmet tapas in a minuscule kitchen at the end of the classic zinc bar. The 
narrow, standing-room only joint buzzes at night, with Mansouri at one end 
explaining some of the 300 wines it stocks while, at the other end, Tischenko 
cooks up a storm with dishes such as Galician octopus grilled with organic 
aubergine, Basque peppers stuffed with yoghurt and tarragon, and a fresh, tangy 
mix of tomatoes, peaches and coriander.

La Buvette

Everything in this enchanting tiny bar is minimalist but perfect, from the 
small 50-odd list of surprising wines to the half-a-dozen delicate sharing 
plates, handwritten on a mirror, often including broad beans and lemon zest, 
fresh goat’s cheese with black garlic and cherries, and marinated baby octopus 
with saffron. La Buvette used to be the local cheese shop, and owner Camille 
Fourmont has left the 19th-century decor intact, and runs the whole show all 
alone behind a simple wooden bar. She learned her trade as sommelier in the 
designer Mama Shelter hotel and restaurant Le Dauphin, owned by cult chef Inaki 
Aizpitarte. Although La Buvette is at the quiet end of hip Rue Saint-Maur, 
Camille already has a serious following, so be prepared to brave the crowds who 
cram in here most nights – with no reservations possible. By the glass, there 
is a choice of six reds and six whites, priced from €5-€6.50, and while the 
cheapest bottle of wine is €12, there is nothing more than €55, as she is 
determined not to stock really expensive vintages.

Le Siffleur de Ballons

Not far from foodies’ favourite Marché d’Aligre <http://marchedaligre.free.fr/>
, Le Siffleur is an offshoot of one of Paris’s classic bistrots,L’Ebauchoir 
<http://www.lebauchoir.com/>, which is right across the street. The creative 
snacks served at Le Siffleur are overseen by L’Ebauchoir’s chef, Thomas Dufour, 
and it is difficult to resist tasty plates of potatoes smothered with melted 
reblochon cheese, organic Beluga lentils drizzled with truffle oil on a bed of 
rocket, and an unforgettablegâteau de riz grand-mère, like no rice pudding you 
have tasted. Then there are some 400 wines to choose from, many with great 
names like Rue de la Soif, French Wine is Not Dead and Tout Bu or Not Tout Bu. 
Fortunately, the bar is run by two young helpful sommeliers, Tristan and Fred, 
who also propose 13 interchanging bottles by the glass, from €3.50 for a sharp, 
fresh Muscadet to €9 for an elegant champagne.

For the moment, Lulu is very much an insiders’ address, in a quiet street off 
the bustling Place de Clichy. But turn up even on a Monday night and you’ll 
find this romantic locale – originally an art-deco pharmacy – packed out. 
Created by the double act of talented chef Fabrice Mellado and wine fanatic 
Guillaume Blanchot, this is a rare cave à manger that does not charge corkage. 
Nine wines are sold by the glass orpichet. Blanchot says: “All of our 150 
vintages can be bought to take away at 20%-40% less than their price on the 
wine list.” In a minuscule kitchen, Mellado prepares surprising dishes like 
beef grilled with strawberries and onions or white asparagus with succulent 
pig’s cheek in a prune and orange sauce. Guests are welcome from 5pm each 
evening until midnight, and this is a rare Parisian address that stays open 
seven days a week.

En Vrac is a cave à manger with a difference, boasting 10 shiny steel vats 
balancing on tree stumps where high-quality organic, zero-sulphite wine is sold 
to take away – bring your own container or the bar staff will fill one of the 
retrolimonade bottles. The brainchild of Thierry Poincin, who has a second 
outlet in Pigalle, En Vrac also has a varied wine selection of 150bottles, and 
locals crowd round a vast wooden counter laden with crusty loaves and long 
saucissons. It’s in a corner of Montmartre rarely visited by tourists, and 
there is a heartyplat du jour for €10.50, homemade soups and salads, plus a 
brilliant Parisian classic: a jambon-beurre sandwich with crunchy gherkins. A 
deli corner stocks everything from gourmet tins of Portuguese sardines and 
mussels to La Parisienne craft ale and huge jars filled with rum, whisky and 
vodka marinating aromatic herbs and fruits. It also runs wine appreciation 
courses and guidance on making your own wine – something that has been pretty 
much heresy in France until now.

Rue de Bagnolet is like a hidden village in the far-flung 20th arrondissement, 
and there are a couple of great neighbourhood bars near Au Bon Vingt,Le Piston 
Pelican <http://pistonpelican.com/> and Le Bar de la Réunion, which are well 
worth a visit. Agnès Baracco is a guru ofvins naturels, and sommeliers from all 
over the city pop in to check out her latest discoveries. At the latest count 
she stocks over 360 natural wines in her tiny shop and customers have to 
squeeze in between the piles of cases she is always unpacking. This is a 
one-woman show, so during the day Agnès operates a simple wine boutique, but 
from 6pm-9pm it becomes an animated cave à manger, where she prepares generous 
plates of cheeses and charcuterie and gives informal wine tasting lessons. Only 
one red and one white are offered by the glass, but the corkage is so low that 
most people crack open a bottle.
• Corkage €4. 52 rue de Bagnolet, 75020, +33 1 43 56 94 55, no website
Wine pick: Coup de Coeur, gewurztraminer/riesling from Alsace, €12
