Head-to-toe sequins are a no-brainer for rising stars on the red carpet, but 
here the Danish Girl actor does shimmers in a haute way – all 1970s car 
upholstery colours andJosef Albers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/18/adventures-of-the-black-square-review-whitechapel-abstract-art-that-aimed-to-change-the-world>
-style squares by Louis Vuitton. It is pretty, yes, but very high fashion – a 
combination that puts Vikander in pole position for this season’s style Oscar.

The 2016 red carpet is looking a bit less blah …

Julianne Moore’s chartreuse dress has been described, variously, as “puke” and 
“gorgeous” by the charming fashion critics of the internet this weekend, which 
is about as divisive as a frock gets. The dress is the most challenging shape 
and colour fromGivenchy’s most recent couture collection 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2016-couture/givenchy/slideshow/collection#9>
 and would always have represented a bit of a risk. All in all, the red carpet 
looked a lot less princessy this weekend – and given that these dresses are 
being worn by some of the most powerful women in Hollywood, individuality over 
bridesmaid-chic must be good news.

Are we reaching a perfection backlash?

 Eccentric … Lori Petty, actor, director and screenwriter. Photograph: Alberto

Well, no, obviously, but a few brave souls are lifting their heads above the 
parapet. Like Lori Petty. Does anyone else look at her loopy ensemble – 
part-candyfloss, part-Gatecrasher <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatecrasher> 
club kid circa 1996 – and feel a warm sense of nostalgia for a more innocent 
time, when not everyone had a stylist and the idea thatBjork might wear a swan 
to the Oscars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/22/the-best-oscars-dresses-ever>, 
and lay an egg on the carpet, was possible? More eccentricity, please.

Idris Elba is unimpeachable

 Matchmaker … Idris Elba hyper-coordinates. Photograph: Dan MacMedan/WireImage 
The lesson here? Like off-duty models or Cate Blanchett, don’t take style tips 
fromIdris Elba <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/idris-elba>. He looks 
brilliant in everything – dapper and adorable here, despite the menacing levels 
of matchy-matchiness, pairing his trousers to his waistcoat to his tieto his 
actual shoes.

Indeed, shoes remain tricky

 Vertiginous … Brie Larson. Photograph: Gregg DeGuire/WireImage 
This dress comes straight from Versace’s most recent couture show – which was 
athleisure-themed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/24/donatella-versace-haute-couture-at-paris-fashion-week>
, hence the climbing-rope ties – but we need to talk about the shoes. They are 
platforms, and perilously high platforms, at that. Larson was far from the only 
star wobbling around in towering shoes of the kind Victoria Beckham lived in 
before her fashion transformation. This underlines the fact that no matter what 
happens in the rest of fashion, stylists will squeeze actors’ feet into shoes 
solely designed to make their legs look longer, regardless of trends or 
wobbles. In other words, even afterthe great Cannes flat-shoe revolt of 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes>
, red-carpet progress has not really reached ground level.

Yellow is the new black

So many mega red-carpet dresses are the colour of canaries and daffodils. See 
Lea Seydoux atlast year’s Baftas in Prada

 and Michelle Williams in Vera Wang in 2006 (a frock so famousit has its own 
Wikipedia page 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_Vera_Wang_dress_of_Michelle_Williams>). 
Now Game of Thrones star Hannah Murray’s super-simple slip dress can join the 
canon.

It’s easier for men

 Physics-teacher chic … Michael Shannon. Photograph: Jason Merritt/Getty Images 
Michael Shannon <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-shannon> 
demonstrates what men need to do on the red carpet to stand out: grab a blazer 
in a colour that reminds you of your secondary school physics teacher. Put it 
on. That’s it. You’re done. Sigh.
