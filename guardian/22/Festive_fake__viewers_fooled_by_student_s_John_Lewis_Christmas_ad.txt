It has become one of the most eagerly awaited moments of the festive calendar, 
sparking weeks of Christmas-themed marketing that tugs on the heartstrings and 
prises open the wallets of millions of Britons.

But annual excitement about the John Lewis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis> Christmas ad was given a false 
start this weekend when hundreds of thousands of people were fooled into 
watching a teenager’s A-level coursework masquerading as the retailer’s 2016 
short film.

The clip, which was just over a minute long, had all the elements of the 
beloved annual tear-jerker: lonely snow man, heart-tugging music, a calendar 
marking the days tillChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>, and subtle hint that true 
happiness can come only through buying and delivering gifts.

Viewed more 375,000 times on YouTube by Sunday evening, the advert was 
produced by Nick Jablonka, an A-level media student, who had studied the 
mini-movies for his coursework.

“It was a very rushed piece, I’ve left it till the last month to do it … 
Creating a short film is a lot of work especially when it’s CGI. I was 
responsible for things outside of my comfort zone like character animation and 
lighting,” he said.

His work is already beating some of this year’s genuine Christmas ads. This 
year’s House of Fraser version, with music by Laura Mvula, had clocked up fewer 
than a third as many views on YouTube. Many of his viewers suggested thatJohn 
Lewis <https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis> should recruit him.

Last year’s genuine campaign – the lonely man on the moon, following the 2014 
penguin and the 2013 double act of the bear and the hare – took nearly 12 
months and £1m to make, with another £6m spent buying advertising slots.

The student’s parody follows a similar theme to previous ads, featuring a 
lonely snowman reminiscing about times with a snowwoman love interest, before 
being reunited. It features Follow You Follow Me by Vapor feat. Adaline as the 
score.

This year’s official John Lewis ad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/05/christmas-tv-ads-john-lewis> 
is expected to launch on Thursday 10 November and is said to have cost £7m.



 Aldi, which made a parody of the Man in the Moon ad last year and was then 
caught out overstating the price of the John Lewis telescope compared with its 
version, is believed to be behind a mysterious campaign for Kevin the Carrot 
popping up on social media. Kevin tweeted on Monday: “Orange is the new ‘Man on 
the Moon’.”

Jablonka hasn’t revealed his production costs, but UK companies are believed 
to be spending a record £5.6bn this year, with Burberry’s ad particularly 
ambitious, running to three minutes, directed by Oscar winner Asif Kapadia, and 
with stars including Sienna Miller, Dominic West and Lily James.

The big stores and companies hope to pull in a quarter of their entire annual 
profits over the Christmas period. Jablonka’s ad also proved profitable: “As 
far as I remember I think it got full marks.”
