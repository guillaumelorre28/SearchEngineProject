Police on Saturday confirmed they are searching a home on Challenger Road in 
Madora Bay.


It is understood the home belongs to the parents of Kewdale man Bradley Robert 
Edwards, who was this week charged with murdering Jane Rimmer in 1996 and Ciara 
Glennon in 1997.


Edwards is also accused of abducting a 17-year-old girl in February 1995 as 
she walked through Rowe Park in Claremont, and indecently assaulting an 
18-year-old woman during a break-in at a Huntingdale home in February 1988.

He was remanded in custody to appear in Stirling Gardens magistrates court on 
11 January.

No charges were laid in connection to the disappearance and suspected murder 
of 18-year-old Sarah Spiers, who disappeared from Claremont in the early hours 
of 27 January 1996.
