Winning tip: City of Spies walking tour

During the second world war, neutral Lisbon was a hotbed of espionage. The 
City of Spies guided walking tour shines a spotlight on that shadowy past, 
bringing some colourful characters, including the “real” James Bond, to life. 
In the Teatro Politeama, on “Lisbon’s Broadway”, performer Josephine Baker 
regularly smuggled messages for the allies in her bra. From a nearby coffee 
shop, a chicken farmer turned double agent called Garbo filed fake reports to 
the Nazis; while in the Avenida Palace Hotel a concealed door led directly into 
Rossio railway station, so that furtive figures carrying vital intelligence, 
could avoid the waiting secret police at its main entrance. We were fascinated.

For just €2.75, take the ferry from Lisbon’s Cais do Sodré railway station 
across the Tagus river, to the town of Cacilhas. It’s a quick ride, but it 
takes you from the city to a small village, with terraces full of restaurants, 
old stone buildings with chipped blue and whiteazulejo tiles and stunning views 
of Lisbon’s seven hills. Once in Cacilhas, take the quick walk to the Cristo 
Rei statue, pose for a selfie by the famous 25 de Abril bridge, visit the 
neighbouring town of Almada, or grab a table atRestaurante Ponto Final 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Restaurante-Ponto-Final/143312162407998>, and 
enjoy some afternoon wine by the river.

 Rooftop terrace at Park Bar 
Park Bar is a rooftop bar in a secret spot on top of a car park in the Bairro 
Alto. On entering the car park there is no signposting to the bar so we had to 
resort to sign language with the attendant to be sure we were in the right 
place. The dingy stairwell opens out to a decked garden terrace with a 
chilled-out vibe, comfy seating, a great wine list and a view to die for. The 
perfect spot for a sundowner or three.

Restô do Chapitô is a bar, restaurant and a state-funded school for circus 
performers, but most importantly it has one of the best views in Lisbon, 
overlooking Alfama (the oldest district of Lisbon), the river and the bridge. 
The food is great, the vibe is relaxed and the staff are laid-back but 
efficient. I come here every time I visit Lisbon as it epitomises the city for 
me.

We stumbled into the jungly paradise of Estufa Fria and Estufa Quente (hot and 
cool plant houses) inParque Eduardo VII 
<http://www.golisbon.com/sight-seeing/edward-park.html>, the city’s central 
park, on a misty autumn morning. We walked wide-eyed through the towering ferns 
and banana trees, taking meandering pathways across streams, eventually 
encountering a mysterious door into a deserted quarry full of towering cacti. 
No city sounds could be heard. We expected to see a unicorn but none appeared. 
Maybe you’ll have more luck.

 Restaurante O Gaiteiro 
Our first meal in Lisbon was at Restaurante O Gaiteiro, and it really got us 
off to a great start. After navigating our way through the narrow, cobbled 
streets we stumbled across it, just in time for lunch. It servedmariscada, 
mixed seafood rice, with prawns, squid and cod. It must use an extremely rich 
seafood stock as the dish was packed with flavour. We shared a huge platter 
between two for €8 and washed it down with a carafe of red for €1.50. No 
frills, just a fantastic dish and friendly atmosphere.

 Museu Do Aljube 
For a unique insight into modern Portugal, visit the Museu Do Aljube (Museum 
of Resistance and Liberation), close to the imposing Sé Cathedral. This new, 
free museum in a former prison uses the space, including the cells, to trace 
the period of the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal and its colonies. It is 
sobering and moving, and by the end you will be pleased to reach the delightful 
cafe on the top floor, with excellent views of the city and harbour.

 Roll with it … the public toilets at Terreiro do Paco Square, Lisbon, Portugal.
I can’t verify the designers’ claim that this is “the sexiest WC on Earth” but 
the public loos on Terreiro do Paco Square are certainly like no other I’ve 
encountered. Once I’d paid my 50 cents to the resident “toilet fairy” I could 
choose the colour of loo paper I wanted from a rainbow selection in the “foyer” 
that looks like a modern art installation. The giant communal wash basin is 
bright yellow and toilet-roll shaped. There’s even an attached gift shop, 
selling … you’ve guessed. Opening hours are 10am to 8pm, so a call of nature 
outside those times could be an “inconvenience”.

 Fado performers at the Povo venue 
You should experience fado when in Lisbon and you should experience it at 
Povo. Up-and-coming fado singers are given a short residency and perform every 
night producing a CD at the end. It’s an up-close, intimate venue where you can 
see the emotion in the singers’ faces and feel it in their beautiful voice. On 
top of that, the staff are friendly, thepesticos (snacks) are amazing and the 
wine wonderful. There is no entry fee and you can reserve a table in advance, 
but sitting up at the end of the bar gives a great view.

With so many bars to choose from, where do you start? This one might be a good 
place, or should that be plaice? It is in a former fishing tackle shop, and 
this small bar has kept all the fishing paraphernalia and stocked up on tins of 
fish. The menu is limited – its fish, canned or tinned, or try the dried slices 
of tuna, a real revelation. To the west of the city centre and below the Bairro 
Alto, this isn’t the usual tourist trap, but well worth searching out.
