Commonwealth 
<https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/commonwealth-by-ann-patchett-9781408880395> by 
Ann Patchett

This is the seventh novel by Patchett, who won the Orange Prize and the 
PEN/Faulkner Award forBel Canto. It follows the intertwined lives of two 
American families over five decades, from the rather scandalous formation of 
their connection at a christening party in the early 1960s, onwards into the 
new millennium. While it is a family saga, it is much more than that. 
Patchett’s quiet, deft insights – about family, siblings, relationships and 
life – and her ability to let the characters’ actions speak for themselves, 
make this novel a gripping and compelling tale. Sarah Churchwell,reviewing 
Commonwealth for The Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/16/commonwealth-by-ann-patchett-review>
, writes: “The novel is alive with provocative insights that sum up entire 
relationships.”

Romance

The Atomic Weight of Love 
<https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/the-atomic-weight-of-love-by-elizabeth-j-church-9780008209308>
 by Elizabeth J. Church

The tightly woven debut novel of Elizabeth J. Church takes readers from the 
World War II years in Chicago to the dry heat of the New Mexico canyons in the 
1970s, following protagonist Meridian Wallace. Wallace is a young scientist 
enrolled to study ornithology at the University of Chicago. There she falls in 
love with one of her professors, and while the relationship flourishes, her 
professional ambitions are stymied by the claustrophobic expectations of her 
time. By the 1970s, with anti-war protests in full swing across the country, 
Wallace undergoes a metamorphosis through a relationship with a young Vietnam 
War veteran and the growing possibilities of the women’s movement.

Small Great Things 
<https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/small-great-things-by-jodi-picoult-9781760110499>
 by Jodi Picoult

Debuting at No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, Picoult’s latest 
offering once again uses her ability to spin a gripping yarn into a timely 
exploration of the big issues. Labour and delivery nurse Ruth Jefferson is told 
that the white supremacist parents of a newborn baby do not want Jefferson, an 
African American, to touch their baby. But when the infant requires urgent 
medical attention and Ruth is the only staff member in the nursery, she 
intervenes. The baby dies and Ruth ends up in court, charged with a serious 
crime. The novel follows Ruth’s battle and her developing relationship with her 
white public defender Kennedy McQuarrie, and the ways in which the case leads 
them to question everything they have ever thought about race, privilege, 
prejudice, justice and compassion.

The Good People 
<https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/the-good-people-by-hannah-kent-9781743534908> 
by Hannah Kent

Fans of this Australian author’s award-winning debut, Burial Rites, have been 
eagerly awaiting her second novel, and early reviews ofThe Good People indicate 
that it lives up to their high expectations. Set in a rural village in 1820s 
Ireland, it tells the story of Nóra Leahy, a woman who has been left in the 
sole care of her young grandson following the death of her husband and 
daughter. Leahy’s grandson cannot walk or talk, and Leahy fears this will raise 
the superstitions of the people in her village. Once again, Kent’s meticulous 
attention to detail and elegant prose captivates.

Goodwood 
<https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/goodwood-by-holly-throsby-9781760293734> by 
Holly Throsby

Singer-songwriter Holly Throsby makes her literary debut with Goodwood, a 
mystery set in the fictional NSW country town of Goodwood. It’s the sort of 
town where everybody knows each other’s business, but nothing of much note ever 
happens. Until Rosie White, 18, goes missing. A week later the local butcher, 
Bart McDonald, disappears too, seemingly vanished into thin air. Suddenly the 
whole town and its close-knit community are thrown into turmoil. This novel is 
another string to Throsby’s already crowded bow, which includes four solo 
albums, a children’s album and ARIA nominations for best female artist, best 
children’s album and as one third of the band Seeker Lover Keeper, in which she 
performs with Sarah Blasko and Sally Seltmann.

prime. That’s what Jane Harper has given us…”

Memoir

Working Class Boy 
<https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/working-class-boy-by-jimmy-barnes-9781460752135>
 by Jimmy Barnes

Rock legend Jimmy Barnes says writing this memoir made him sad for two 
reasons: because of the things he remembered; and because of the things he 
couldn’t remember. From his earliest days as a wee bairn in Scotland to finding 
solace in drugs, sex and alcohol as a teen in North Adelaide in the 60s and 
70s, Barnes’s family life was plagued by poverty, violence and fear. Barnesy, 
who came to fame as the gravel-voiced frontman of Aussie rock band Cold Chisel, 
says it was a childhood he thought was normal until he realised that it wasn’t. 
This book finishes with Jimmy joining Cold Chisel. Stay tuned for a sequel, due 
out around 2018, documenting his public years.

Born to Run 
<https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/born-to-run-by-bruce-springsteen-9781471157790>
 by Bruce Springsteen

Something about a performance at the 2009 Super Bowl’s half-time show by 
Springsteen and the E-Street Band prompted the now 60-something Boss to sit 
down and start writing. More than 500 pages later, he came up for air and the 
result is this generous, energetic and sometimes dark journey through the 
legendary American rocker’s life, musical career and struggle with 
depression.Never one to do things by halves – his shows are usually epic and at 
least 3-4 hours long – with this book Springsteen promises to satisfy fans and 
newcomers alike.

Resilient

by Mitchell Johnson

Left-arm fast bowler Johnson was a champion tennis player as a shy 
17-year-old. But then cricketing legend Dennis Lillee saw his potential as a 
cricketer. By 2008, Johnson had become a household name and the most feared 
bowler in the world. But his rapid rise quickly turned to downfall when, in 
2011, he was jeered out of the game by the Barmy Army and sporting media. This 
book tracks his amazing determination and resilience to overcome injury and 
self-doubt, and turn things around to reclaim his place as one of the greats of 
Australian cricket.

The Midnight Gang 
<https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/the-midnight-gang-by-david-walliams-9780008188573>
 by David Walliams

Children are not meant to be up out of bed and on the hunt for adventure at 
midnight – especially not when they are hospital patients. And when they are 
patients in a hospital as out-of-the-ordinary as this one, anything can happen. 
Walliams, who has been compared to a modern-day Roald Dahl, weaves his 
grotesque brand of humour yet again with this Christmas tale with a difference. 
As in his other books, the delightfully outlandish tale is underpinned by a 
story that has a heart-warming message at its core. A crowd-pleaser for the 
young and the young at heart.


Wormwood Mire 
<https://www.dymocks.com.au/book/wormwood-mire-a-stella-montgomery-intrigue-by-judith-rossell-9780733333019>
 by Judith Rossell

Rossell’s 2014 tale of intrigue, Withering-By-Sea, was a runaway success and 
fans have been champing at the bit for the sequel.Wormwood Mire sees heroine, 
orphan Stella Montgomery, sent away by her horrid and furious Aunts to live in 
the old family home with a couple of odd and oddly named cousins (Strideforth 
and Hortense) and their governess. But all is not as it seems… something 
sinister is lurking in the lake at the bottom of the overgrown garden, and it’s 
up to Stella to work out what. Rossell’s prose is enthralling and her beautiful 
illustrations are the icing on the cake.
