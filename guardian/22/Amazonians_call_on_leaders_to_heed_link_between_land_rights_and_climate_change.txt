The land rights of indigenous people in the Amazon must be recognised if their 
countries’ commitments on reducing deforestation and lowering or capping carbon 
emissions are to be realised, according to native leaders from the nine South 
American countries across which the rainforest spreads.

Nearly 300 representatives of the forest’s several million inhabitants 
gathered in Lima last week to demand that their governments heed evidence of 
their ability to conserve the forest and thus protect their way of life.

“We are the ones who are protecting the forest from being destroyed, so if the 
government doesn’t respect our rights we’re going to see huge levels of 
deforestation,” said Maximiliano Correa, from the Coordination of the 
Indigenous Organisations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB).

At the gathering, which was held a week before the Paris climate agreement 
came into force <http://unfccc.int/2860.php> on Friday, indigenous leaders from 
Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela said their governments were ignoring their land 
rights, which are legally enshrined in theConsultation with Indigenous Peoples 
Law <http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/indigenous-tribal/lang--en/index.htm> 
(guaranteed in the International Labour Organisation’sConvention 169 
<http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312314:NO>
).

Correa, an indigenous Tucano from Brazil’s northern Amazonas state, said: “The 
irony for us is that the [Michel] Temer government, which has just ratified the 
Paris agreement, is entirely against recognition of the rights of indigenous 
peoples to their lands.”

He added that congressional amendments in Brazil were reversing 20 years of 
progress on indigenous rights.

Of the nine countries that are home to part of the Amazon rainforest, five 
have ratified theParis climate change agreement 
<https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htm>
. Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname and Venezuela have not.

Tuntiak Katan, of the confederation of indigenous nationalities of Ecuador (
Confeniae <http://confeniae.net/>), said the state “legally steals and usurps 
our territory declaring resource extraction a national priority”.

In 2008, Ecuador became the first country in the world to legally recognise 
the rights of nature. Yet it has justbegun drilling in Yasuní national park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/26/oil-drilling-underway-beneath-ecuadors-yasuni-national-park>
, a UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation biosphere reserve that 
houses two semi-nomadic groups of Waorani indigenous people.

In Venezuela, indigenous people make up 2% of the population, said José Díaz 
Mirabal of the Organización Regional de Pueblos Indígenas de Amazonas. He said 
land titling was “paralysed” due to state interest in mineral deposits in their 
territory. Unchecked alluvial gold mining was also destroying parts of their 
ancestral land he added.

A report by the World Resources Institute 
<http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/Climate_Benefits_Tenure_Costs.pdf> 
(pdf) provides evidence that investing in secure land rights for indigenous 
peoples in the Amazon is one of the most cost-effective ways of tackling 
climate change.

Helen Ding, an environmental economist and lead author of the report, said: 
“Securing land rights for indigenous communities in the Amazon truly would have 
a global impact.

“In terms of global carbon mitigation, there are billions of dollars to be 
gained from slowing deforestation and sequestering carbon in indigenous 
forests.”

Analysing Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia between 2000 and 2012, the report found 
average deforestation rates inside tenured indigenous forest were two to three 
times lower than outside. Yet globally indigenous communities only have secure 
tenure for 10% of their lands.

Despite this evidence, the report points out only 21 of 197 national emissions 
reduction commitments included indigenous rights and community-based land 
tenure. Of those countries, just one – Bolivia – belongs to the nine-strong 
Amazon group.

“There’s a missed opportunity. By protecting existing indigenous lands 
[countries] are actually contributing to those commitments,” said Ding.

During the drafting of the Paris accord, recognition of indigenous rights was 
relegated 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/08/paris-climate-talks-small-farmers-rich-setting-agenda>
 from the text – where it would have been legally binding and enforceable – to 
a non-binding preamble that was merely aspirational.

As negotiations took place in December, native groups from across the world 
staged apaddle down the Seine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2015/dec/07/indigenous-activists-take-to-seine-river-to-protest-axing-of-rights-from-paris-climate-pact>
 to highlight their call for indigenous rights to be included in the UN climate 
pact.

Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur for indigenous peoples, 
called for the text to be changed.

“What indigenous peoples want from this agreement is to be included in efforts 
to combat climate change,” she said. “To many indigenous peoples, the forests 
are the basis for their subsistence, culture, and livelihoods.

“As they implement the Paris agreement, countries should consider and respect 
our contributions to protecting the planet, rather than use it as yet another 
excuse to trample over our rights.”

Despite the shortfalls in the Paris accord, most indigenous leaders back its 
ratification. Roberto Espinoza, a lawyer forAidesep <http://www.aidesep.org.pe/>
, Peru’s inter-ethnic association for the development of the Peruvian 
Rainforest, believes it has raised the international profile of native 
Amazonians as climate defenders.

“Until a few years ago, nobody wanted to know about land titling for 
indigenous peoples in Peru. Now they do. That’s because the indigenous struggle 
has been linked to the climate issue,” he said.

Peru, home to the second largest area of Amazon rainforest after Brazil, 
pledged to reduce its deforestation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/05/cop20-peru-indigenous-people-combat-climate-change>
 to zero by 2021 prior to the COP 20, which was hosted in Lima in 2014.

That international commitment put pressure on the Peruvian state to title 
indigenous land, Espinoza said. About 2,000 indigenous communities now have 
land titles, with a further 1,377 awaiting formal recognition, he added.
