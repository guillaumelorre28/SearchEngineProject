Summary

So it took a while but Brailsford finally gave us some clarity about what was 
in the package that was delivered to Bradley Wiggins at the Dauphiné in 2011 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/19/mystery-package-fluimucil-dave-brailsford-cycling>
. Questions will inevitably be asked as to why Team Sky and British Cycling 
went to such lengths to deliver such a trivial-seeming medication (fluimucil) 
and why something that it is advised should not be used to treat an asthma 
sufferer was used to treat an asthma sufferer. The details around this will be 
revealed by Ukad and we may know more then. It needs to be confirmed, through 
invoices, whether what Brailsford has been told by Dr Freeman is in fact true. 
One thing is certain, that British Cycling and Team Sky have been tainted by 
this farrago and that their sporting operations would appear to be run in a 
more haphazard manner than you may think from such successful teams. Brailsford 
was as adamant as ever that Team Sky are clean, though. We will have a news 
take on the inquiry up shortly.

Why has this ended up in front of a select committee meeting, Brailsford is 
asked. Doesn’t this reflect badly on the management atTeam Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky>. “There are lessons to be learned. 
I have handled this situation very badly. We’ve a fantastic reputation and our 
team don’t deserve to have this shadow cast over them and it pains me. But we 
have reviewed all our policies and how we use TUEs in the future and how do we 
gain and provide transparency while protecting competitive advantage. We invite 
anybody to come and examine us and scrutinise us.” And that is the end of that. 
Brailsford leaves.

Brailsford is told that it looks like he is trying to cover something up, 
given that Fluimucil is such an innocuous medicine. He agrees that he hasn’t 
handled things well. “There was no question of a cover-up,” he says and [in 
articles in the Daily Mail] there have been conflicting reports about what 
happened around the package and he shouldn’t have tried to give “a running 
commentary.”

Nicholson pushes the point on the concern about the amount of influence 
doctors have in determining what medication riders need and how coaches and 
team managers can police this if they don’t always know what they are being 
prescribed.“If you have doctors who are willing to break the rules. If anyone 
steps the wrong side of the rules then they deserve everything they’re going to 
get,” says Brailsford. He says he has confidence in his doctors.

Brailsford says there are time when coaches do know what is being administered 
by doctors to riders, and there are times when they don’t. Doctors will share 
that information if they deem it necessary. “The discretion of doctors is very 
good and they will share information on a need to know basis.”

Should the process around administering drugs be toughened up a bit? Nicholson 
says he found it surprising that Sutton did not know what was in the package 
even though he arranged it? Brailsford does not look quite so confident as he 
did earlier. Brailsford says Dr Freeman authorised the package to be delivered, 
Sutton arranged it, and the physiotherapist Phil Burt packaged it up. Then it 
was taken by Simon Cope to France.

John Nicholson says he believes Fluimucil is not licensed in the UK yet. Is 
there any evidence of what was in the package? “I have third-party information. 
I can only relate what I was told [by Dr Freeman]. He told me it was 
Fluimucil.” Was anything else in this package? “I hope not.” So Brailsford 
never saw the contents of the package himself.

I’m told Fluimucil costs eight euros in France. Why was it flown all this way? 
“I understand where your questioning is coming from. It’s not unusual for stuff 
to be flown around.”

Brailsford says he had no concerns about Wiggins’s TUEs given he hadn’t 
required them in the past and feels there was no crossing of the lines. He 
refers to the medical team’s advice again. It’s down to them, he says.“There 
has to be a medical need.”

What were Brailsford’s feelings about the appointment of Geert Leinders? “It 
wasn’t my greatest decision. I hold my hands up. He went through our processes 
and once we found out he had a past we took appropriate action.”

Did he play any part in these TUEs? “No,” says Brailsford.

On the subject of Wiggins’s TUEs Brailsford says: “It’s done on a case by case 
basis. Depending on the condition of the diagnosis, the granting body may 
require further information.”

He’s asked if Team Sky <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky> would have 
had to pay an independent adviser to give advice on whether Wiggins would have 
needed a TUE … Brailsford says he isn’t sure but he imagines that would be the 
case.

Paul Farrelly MP asks about the package again. “Presumably British Cycling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-cycling> would have been invoiced 
for a package then …”Brailsford says that an agreement was in place that 
allowed for cross-funding and a re-charging policy.

Does a documentary paper-trail exist? “It should be there,” says Brailsford. 
“Ukad have all the invoices for our medical supplies. My understanding is that 
there is product code on each item.” He agrees that cross-checking of that 
product (Fluimucil) should be the end of it.

Would you have ever had a conversation with a medical member in which you 
would ask them not to prescribe anything that may have a performance-enhancing 
side-effect? “The medical team do not need any reining in or any advice of that 
sense. They are absolutely trustworthy and have the health of the athletes at 
their heart. They know where the lines are.”

Do you think Wiggins’s records should be made available to Ukad so this all 
tallies with Ukad’s investigation?“They have been,” says Brailsford. “If 
Bradley had taken something he shouldn’t have he was tested shortly afterward 
and that would have created an analytical finding.”
Martyn Ziegler (@martynziegler) 
Still lack of clarity here, Brailsford says delivery was to restock Freeman's 
supplies. Sutton says Freeman administered contents to Wiggins

Collins asks why such effort was made in getting a drug that was easy to come 
by flown out to France?“The sole purpose of Simon Cope’s visit wasn’t to bring 
this product. He was on his way anyway and brought it down with him. He has his 
own stores in Manchester so brought it with him.”
Sean Ingle (@seaningle) 
Collins asks why not ask the race doctor for a decongestant? Brailsford 
replies: "It wasn't convoluted, it was the easiest possible way."

A decongestant, Fluimucil, was in the package

Collins moves on to the package. Has Dr Freeman told you what was in the 
package? “Dr Freeman told me it was Fluimucil, a decongestant you put in a 
nebuliser. I couldn’t see any anti-doping rule violation.”

Are you aware that Wiggins was prescribed a corticosteroid out of competition? 
“I wouldn’t be aware of that. That would be a breech of medical-client

Were corticosteroids used by Wiggins out of competition? “Not that I was aware 
of.” It’s a question of “use and abuse” and some riders may have used them out 
of competition if it was required after a crash or an injury. But that would 
not be “in any way shape or form an abuse.”

Do you question the medical staff as to whether Wiggins, for example, needed a 
strong medicine such a triamcinolone? “We have confidence in the medical team 
with regards to Bradley’s first TUE – it wasn’t just a doctor on his own that 
decided that. He wrote a letter of recommendation that I’m sure you’re aware 
of” and then the process is begun all the way up to Wada who decide whether it 
can be administered.

Collins: “With regard to TUEs, what’s the process of a team agreeing that an 
application is going to be made for a TUE?”It’s very much driven by the medical 
team, a team doctor. The rider has a condition. The doctor assessing it, forms 
a diagnosis and then looks at the criteria you have to hit to be given a TUE”, 
such as if the condition will harm their medical condition. the TUE is there to 
bring the athlete back to their “baseline” of health, he says.

Sutton is asked if he would like to comment and apologise for his conduct 
relating to comments made about Jess Varnish that were deemed to be 
“inappropriate and discriminatory language” …Sutton looks a bit surprised. 
“Apologise?” he asks. “In 10 years I had not had one complaint against me until 
one athlete was dropped from the Olympic team. She’s entitled to have her say 
and I can have my say but I’ll leave it up to the legal team.”

Did Dr Freeman say Brad’s been sorted, Sutton is asked by Collins? Was your 
assumption that he was referring to a treatment for a problem that he was 
suffering in the last few days of the Dauphiné [in 2011]? “He sorted him out 
with the illness he had at that moment. It could have been his allergies had 
flared up in the past few days.”

I am astounded that you would suggest we have not done it by the book.”

Why was Sutton not aware of what was in the package when he authorised it? 
Sutton says he simply “arranged” for something to be delivered but did not know 
what it was.

You keep saying things are clean at Team Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky> but this issue has caused a lot of 
controversy. Why did you not think to ask what was in the package? There was no 
evidence to suggest anything would be wrong, he says because nothing in the 
past suggested anything delivered would cause controversy.
Sean Ingle (@seaningle) 
Ian Lucas MP: You arranged for package to be delivered but you didn't know 
what was in it?" Sutton. "Exactly" Lucas: "Why did they ask you?"

Sutton is asked if it is not odd that he was never made aware of what the TUE 
was because if Andy Murray was given a TUE Ivan Lendl, his coach, would want to 
know what it was? “It was my job to get Wiggins fit and healthy … given the 
nature of the team and the way it has been set up the doctors would adhere to 
policy.” Sutton nods his head when asked if it is true that he didn’t think to 
ask about what Wiggins’s TUE was.

Was Sutton ever concerned about Team Sky hiring Dr Geert Leinders,who was 
banned for life last year for multiple doping violations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/22/geert-leinders-life-ban-team-sky-doctor>
 while at Rabobank between 1996 and 2009.“As soon as Team Sky were made aware 
of this, his contract was terminated.”

Back to the package, could British Cycling have done more to clear this up? 
“The package hasn’t got anything to do with British Cycling. The package was a 
Team Sky delivery. I don’t thinkBritish Cycling

What can British Cycling <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-cycling> 
do to clear up this mess?“There’s an ongoing investigation. The powers that be 
need to come out and tell you what was in the package. I’m saddened where this 
has got to. We created this thing to give young riders the chance to go out and 
compete cleanly.”

Sutton: “There’s a lot of people that are jealous, there are lot of people who 
are bitter [of our success].”

Interesting that Sutton knew exactly what medication was flown out to Hong 
Kong earlier this year but didn't know what he authorised in 2011

Compared to other sports why does cycling attract so much doping controversy? 
“We’re policed more than any other sport in the world.”

Do you think it’s over policed? “No, no, we name and shame. We should be 
applauded for that,” says Sutton.

Sutton is thanked for making it clear that it wasn’t just pedals in the 
package. He is then asked howTeam Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky> improved dramatically from 2010 
onwards. “We started working at altitude, we got a great new coach [Tim 
Kerrison],” he says. The approach changed and we got better he continues. They 
better understood what was required and learned so much in the first year that 
we knew where we came up short. I could tell you to the day when we realised 
what we needed to do. When watching Wiggins drop away in 2010 Sutton says he 
told Brailsford: “We need to train more in the red zone at altitude. Tim 
Kerrison then set up the training camp in Tenerife.”

So it took a while but Brailsford finally gave us some clarity about what was 
in the package that was delivered to Bradley Wiggins at the Dauphiné in 2011 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/19/mystery-package-fluimucil-dave-brailsford-cycling>
. Questions will inevitably be asked as to why Team Sky and British Cycling 
went to such lengths to deliver such a trivial-seeming medication (fluimucil) 
and why something that it is advised should not be used to treat an asthma 
sufferer was used to treat an asthma sufferer. The details around this will be 
revealed by Ukad and we may know more then. It needs to be confirmed, through 
invoices, whether what Brailsford has been told by Dr Freeman is in fact true. 
One thing is certain, that British Cycling and Team Sky have been tainted by 
this farrago and that their sporting operations would appear to be run in a 
more haphazard manner than you may think from such successful teams. Brailsford 
was as adamant as ever that Team Sky are clean, though. We will have a news 
take on the inquiry up shortly.
 
Why has this ended up in front of a select committee meeting, Brailsford is 
asked. Doesn’t this reflect badly on the management atTeam Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky>. “There are lessons to be learned. 
I have handled this situation very badly. We’ve a fantastic reputation and our 
team don’t deserve to have this shadow cast over them and it pains me. But we 
have reviewed all our policies and how we use TUEs in the future and how do we 
gain and provide transparency while protecting competitive advantage. We invite 
anybody to come and examine us and scrutinise us.” And that is the end of that. 
Brailsford leaves.
 
Brailsford is told that it looks like he is trying to cover something up, 
given that Fluimucil is such an innocuous medicine. He agrees that he hasn’t 
handled things well. “There was no question of a cover-up,” he says and [in 
articles in the Daily Mail] there have been conflicting reports about what 
happened around the package and he shouldn’t have tried to give “a running 
commentary.”

"I relayed running commentary, it wasn't a cover-up, it was what I was being

Nicholson pushes the point on the concern about the amount of influence 
doctors have in determining what medication riders need and how coaches and 
team managers can police this if they don’t always know what they are being 
prescribed.“If you have doctors who are willing to break the rules. If anyone 
steps the wrong side of the rules then they deserve everything they’re going to 
get,” says Brailsford. He says he has confidence in his doctors.
 
Here’s our first take on the revelation of what was in the package. 

Mystery package contained Fluimucil, Brailsford tells select committee

Well, this is interesting. Fluimucil is not recommended to be used if you have 
asthma.
Matt Lawton (@Matt_Lawton_DM)

2016 <https://twitter.com/Matt_Lawton_DM/status/810849012735770628>  
Brailsford says there are time when coaches do know what is being administered 
by doctors to riders, and there are times when they don’t. Doctors will share 
that information if they deem it necessary. “The discretion of doctors is very 
good and they will share information on a need to know basis.”
 
Should the process around administering drugs be toughened up a bit? Nicholson 
says he found it surprising that Sutton did not know what was in the package 
even though he arranged it? Brailsford does not look quite so confident as he 
did earlier. Brailsford says Dr Freeman authorised the package to be delivered, 
Sutton arranged it, and the physiotherapist Phil Burt packaged it up. Then it 
was taken by Simon Cope to France.
 
John Nicholson says he believes Fluimucil is not licensed in the UK yet. Is 
there any evidence of what was in the package? “I have third-party information. 
I can only relate what I was told [by Dr Freeman]. He told me it was 
Fluimucil.” Was anything else in this package? “I hope not.” So Brailsford 
never saw the contents of the package himself.

I’m told Fluimucil costs eight euros in France. Why was it flown all this way? 
“I understand where your questioning is coming from. It’s not unusual for stuff 
to be flown around.”
 
Brailsford says he had no concerns about Wiggins’s TUEs given he hadn’t 
required them in the past and feels there was no crossing of the lines. He 
refers to the medical team’s advice again. It’s down to them, he says.“There 
has to be a medical need.”
 
What were Brailsford’s feelings about the appointment of Geert Leinders? “It 
wasn’t my greatest decision. I hold my hands up. He went through our processes 
and once we found out he had a past we took appropriate action.”

Did he play any part in these TUEs? “No,” says Brailsford. 
 
On the subject of Wiggins’s TUEs Brailsford says: “It’s done on a case by case 
basis. Depending on the condition of the diagnosis, the granting body may 
require further information.”

He’s asked if Team Sky <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky> would have 
had to pay an independent adviser to give advice on whether Wiggins would have 
needed a TUE … Brailsford says he isn’t sure but he imagines that would be the 
case.
 
Paul Farrelly MP asks about the package again. “Presumably British Cycling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-cycling> would have been invoiced 
for a package then …”Brailsford says that an agreement was in place that 
allowed for cross-funding and a re-charging policy.

Does a documentary paper-trail exist? “It should be there,” says Brailsford. 
“Ukad have all the invoices for our medical supplies. My understanding is that 
there is product code on each item.” He agrees that cross-checking of that 
product (Fluimucil) should be the end of it.
 
Brailsford says that Wiggins won every major race in 2012 so TUE before Tour 
de France didn’t make a big difference.
 
Would you have ever had a conversation with a medical member in which you 
would ask them not to prescribe anything that may have a performance-enhancing 
side-effect? “The medical team do not need any reining in or any advice of that 
sense. They are absolutely trustworthy and have the health of the athletes at 
their heart. They know where the lines are.”
 
Here’s what Fluimucil is, in case you’re interested. 
<https://pharmacybook.net/acetylcysteine-fluimucil/>
 
Do you think Wiggins’s records should be made available to Ukad so this all 
tallies with Ukad’s investigation?“They have been,” says Brailsford. “If 
Bradley had taken something he shouldn’t have he was tested shortly afterward 
and that would have created an analytical finding.”
Martyn Ziegler (@martynziegler) 
Still lack of clarity here, Brailsford says delivery was to restock Freeman's 
supplies. Sutton says Freeman administered contents to Wiggins
 <https://twitter.com/martynziegler/status/810843642822881281> December 19, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/martynziegler/status/810843642822881281>  
Collins asks why such effort was made in getting a drug that was easy to come 
by flown out to France?“The sole purpose of Simon Cope’s visit wasn’t to bring 
this product. He was on his way anyway and brought it down with him. He has his 
own stores in Manchester so brought it with him.”
Sean Ingle (@seaningle) 
Collins asks why not ask the race doctor for a decongestant? Brailsford 
replies: "It wasn't convoluted, it was the easiest possible way."
 <https://twitter.com/seaningle/status/810842054964236288> December 19, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/seaningle/status/810842054964236288>  
Collins moves on to the package. Has Dr Freeman told you what was in the 
package? “Dr Freeman told me it was Fluimucil, a decongestant you put in a 
nebuliser. I couldn’t see any anti-doping rule violation.”
Sean Ingle (@seaningle) 
Finally, some clarity: David Brailsford says Dr Freeman told him that 
Fluimucil was in the package
 <https://twitter.com/seaningle/status/810841094191775745> December 19, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/seaningle/status/810841094191775745>  
Are you aware that Wiggins was prescribed a corticosteroid out of competition? 
“I wouldn’t be aware of that. That would be a breech of medical-client 
confidentiality.”
 
Would you be aware if the line is being crossed? “You can’t exist in Team Sky 
orBritish Cycling <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-cycling> without 
knowing what the standards are. We race clean. Everybody is aware of that. We 
have a very clear structure and culture.”
Sean Ingle (@seaningle) 
Dave Brailsford insists that Team Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky> has a "very clear structure and 
culture" about doping, to ensure "everything is done by the book"
 <https://twitter.com/seaningle/status/810838713303437312> December 19, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/seaningle/status/810838713303437312>  
Were corticosteroids used by Wiggins out of competition? “Not that I was aware 
of.” It’s a question of “use and abuse” and some riders may have used them out 
of competition if it was required after a crash or an injury. But that would 
not be “in any way shape or form an abuse.”
 
Do you question the medical staff as to whether Wiggins, for example, needed a 
strong medicine such a triamcinolone? “We have confidence in the medical team 
with regards to Bradley’s first TUE – it wasn’t just a doctor on his own that 
decided that. He wrote a letter of recommendation that I’m sure you’re aware 
of” and then the process is begun all the way up to Wada who decide whether it 
can be administered.
 
Brailsford: “The granting of a TUE is becoming much more of a challenge 
because of the possible stigma that is being attached to the process now.”
 
Collins: “With regard to TUEs, what’s the process of a team agreeing that an 
application is going to be made for a TUE?”It’s very much driven by the medical 
team, a team doctor. The rider has a condition. The doctor assessing it, forms 
a diagnosis and then looks at the criteria you have to hit to be given a TUE”, 
such as if the condition will harm their medical condition. the TUE is there to 
bring the athlete back to their “baseline” of health, he says.
 
Brailsford: “Just to be clear, we were given information on Friday of 
non-disclosure [on info relating to Ukad investigation] but now I am aware the 
situation has changed.”
 
Dave Brailsford enters the room …
 
Sutton is asked if he would like to comment and apologise for his conduct 
relating to comments made about Jess Varnish that were deemed to be 
“inappropriate and discriminatory language” …Sutton looks a bit surprised. 
“Apologise?” he asks. “In 10 years I had not had one complaint against me until 
one athlete was dropped from the Olympic team. She’s entitled to have her say 
and I can have my say but I’ll leave it up to the legal team.”
 
Did Dr Freeman say Brad’s been sorted, Sutton is asked by Collins? Was your 
assumption that he was referring to a treatment for a problem that he was 
suffering in the last few days of the Dauphiné [in 2011]? “He sorted him out 
with the illness he had at that moment. It could have been his allergies had 
flared up in the past few days.”
 
No one will tell us what was in the package? Sutton says he is upset by the 
questioning of Team Sky’s integrity.

I am astounded that you would suggest we have not done it by the book.” 
 
Why was Sutton not aware of what was in the package when he authorised it? 
Sutton says he simply “arranged” for something to be delivered but did not know 
what it was.

You keep saying things are clean at Team Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky> but this issue has caused a lot of 
controversy. Why did you not think to ask what was in the package? There was no 
evidence to suggest anything would be wrong, he says because nothing in the 
past suggested anything delivered would cause controversy.

Ian Lucas MP: You arranged for package to be delivered but you didn't know 
what was in it?" Sutton. "Exactly" Lucas: "Why did they ask you?"

Sutton: "Because I was the guy you came to if you wanted things done. This was 
not an uncommon occurrence. I never asked what was in it"

Sutton is asked if it is not odd that he was never made aware of what the TUE 
was because if Andy Murray was given a TUE Ivan Lendl, his coach, would want to 
know what it was? “It was my job to get Wiggins fit and healthy … given the 
nature of the team and the way it has been set up the doctors would adhere to 
policy.” Sutton nods his head when asked if it is true that he didn’t think to 
ask about what Wiggins’s TUE was.
 
Was Sutton ever concerned about Team Sky hiring Dr Geert Leinders,who was 
banned for life last year for multiple doping violations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/22/geert-leinders-life-ban-team-sky-doctor>
 while at Rabobank between 1996 and 2009.“As soon as Team Sky were made aware 
of this, his contract was terminated.”
 
Back to the package, could British Cycling have done more to clear this up? 
“The package hasn’t got anything to do with British Cycling. The package was a 
Team Sky delivery. I don’t thinkBritish Cycling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-cycling> should be penalised.”
 
What can British Cycling <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/british-cycling> 
do to clear up this mess?“There’s an ongoing investigation. The powers that be 
need to come out and tell you what was in the package. I’m saddened where this 
has got to. We created this thing to give young riders the chance to go out and 
compete cleanly.”
 
Sutton: “There’s a lot of people that are jealous, there are lot of people who 
are bitter [of our success].”

Interesting that Sutton knew exactly what medication was flown out to Hong 
Kong earlier this year but didn't know what he authorised in 2011

Compared to other sports why does cycling attract so much doping controversy? 
“We’re policed more than any other sport in the world.”

Do you think it’s over policed? “No, no, we name and shame. We should be 
applauded for that,” says Sutton.
 
Sutton is thanked for making it clear that it wasn’t just pedals in the 
package. He is then asked howTeam Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky> improved dramatically from 2010 
onwards. “We started working at altitude, we got a great new coach [Tim 
Kerrison],” he says. The approach changed and we got better he continues. They 
better understood what was required and learned so much in the first year that 
we knew where we came up short. I could tell you to the day when we realised 
what we needed to do. When watching Wiggins drop away in 2010 Sutton says he 
told Brailsford: “We need to train more in the red zone at altitude. Tim 
Kerrison then set up the training camp in Tenerife.”
