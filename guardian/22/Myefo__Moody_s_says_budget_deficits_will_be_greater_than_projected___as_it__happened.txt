Today, six days before Christmas, the government delivered its midyear 
economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) budget update.

It showed a worsening deficit, by almost $11bn over four years, and debt is 
expected to peak in 2018-19 – one year later than expected.


But the treasurer confirmed he still plans to deliver a surplus by 2020-21. 
Given three previous treasurers have promised surpluses, he did add that the 
numbers were projections.

Tony Abbott’s nanny childcare pilot program has been cut and, as confirmed 
earlier, his Green Army employment program, saving $224m.

The Asset Recycling Fund has also been abandoned and savings of $154m have 
been booked for not going ahead with the same sex marriage plebiscite.

The government also expects to save $2.1bn over four years in the welfare 
fraud prevention crackdown, as promised in the pre-election budget.

But there is more money to increase politicians’ staffers across the 
parliament ($35.8m) and more money for a third staffed electorate office in 
very large electorates.

The three main credit agencies said the Myefo would not change their thinking 
much either way. They continued to assess the Australian position. S&P remains 
pessimistic but no immediate change, Moody’s expects bigger deficits than the 
government had projected.

All in all, the gentle downward trend continues. Scott Morrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison> kept talking about 
requiring partners in parliament to play ball. Chris Bowen said he had already 
supported some government savings but Labor would not support unfair changes. 
Bowen described the projected surplus as “wafer thin” and it would blow over in 
a strong breeze.

So that is it for me. Thanks to the brains trust: Greg Jericho, Katharine 
Murphy and others.

Thanks for your company. Have a great Christmas break and here’s to coming 
back refreshed in the new year.

Good afternoon.

Richard Di Natale, Greens leader:

There is one message in this Myefo for everyday Australians: unless you’re a 
big corporation or Liberal party donor, you don’t matter.

Malcolm Turnbull’s plan to hand out tax cuts to the wealthiest Australians 
while wage growth remains stagnant is a slap in the face to ordinary 
Australians doing it tough.

There is nothing in the Turnbull government’s economic program that addresses 
the major risks to the economy from the housing bubble or that eases the 
growing gap between the rich and everyone else.

Standard & Poors: We remain pessimistic ... but no immediate effect on ratings

An statement from S&P Global:

Global Ratings said today that the Australian government’s midyear budget 
update has no immediate effect on the credit rating or outlook on the 
commonwealth ofAustralia 
<https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/entityPage.do?sp_mid=76075&sp_rid=2138306&entityId=100187&elqTrackId=d7e0a04d7cb144aabfb8356ff2e0002e&elq=9e426f78a1db4c649f148fb1302d5509&elqaid=76075&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=>
 (unsolicited ratings AAA/Negative/A-1+).

The government’s worsening forecast fiscal position, as outlined in its latest 
budget projections earlier today, further pressures the rating.

We remain pessimistic about the government’s ability to close existing budget 
deficits and return a balanced budget by the year ending 30 June 2021.

Over the coming months, we will continue to monitor the government’s 
willingness and ability to enact new budget savings or revenue measures to 
reduce fiscal deficits materially over the next few years.

The Business Council of Australia’s Jennifer Westacott says Myefo underlines 
that Australia can continue to muddle along and “sleepwalk into lower living 
standards” or seize the opportunity to deliver a stronger budget.

Why?

The MYEFO update makes it clear we must intensify efforts to meet the twin 
budget objectives of reducing the rate of growth in spending and accelerating 
economic growth. This means continuing to redesign major spending programs to 
improve the quality of spending, cut waste and deliver better value for 
taxpayer dollars. At the same time, we must better equip the economy to support 
jobs and prosperity.

Politicians must move on from the phony, dead-end argument that supporting 
growth comes at the cost of fairness.Growth and fairness go hand in hand 
because growth creates economic opportunity.

Only economic growth can create jobs, higher wages and the revenue to pay for 
the health, education and welfare services Australians value.

And only economic growth can ensure this country becomes more capable each 
year of caring for all of its citizens, no matter what their circumstances.

We can no longer afford to ignore or be complacent about this reality.”

Today, six days before Christmas, the government delivered its midyear 
economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) budget update.

It showed a worsening deficit, by almost $11bn over four years, and debt is 
expected to peak in 2018-19 – one year later than expected.


But the treasurer confirmed he still plans to deliver a surplus by 2020-21. 
Given three previous treasurers have promised surpluses, he did add that the 
numbers were projections.

Tony Abbott’s nanny childcare pilot program has been cut and, as confirmed 
earlier, his Green Army employment program, saving $224m.

The Asset Recycling Fund has also been abandoned and savings of $154m have 
been booked for not going ahead with the same sex marriage plebiscite.

The government also expects to save $2.1bn over four years in the welfare 
fraud prevention crackdown, as promised in the pre-election budget.

But there is more money to increase politicians’ staffers across the 
parliament ($35.8m) and more money for a third staffed electorate office in 
very large electorates.

The three main credit agencies said the Myefo would not change their thinking 
much either way. They continued to assess the Australian position. S&P remains 
pessimistic but no immediate change, Moody’s expects bigger deficits than the 
government had projected.

All in all, the gentle downward trend continues. Scott Morrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison> kept talking about 
requiring partners in parliament to play ball. Chris Bowen said he had already 
supported some government savings but Labor would not support unfair changes. 
Bowen described the projected surplus as “wafer thin” and it would blow over in 
a strong breeze.

So that is it for me. Thanks to the brains trust: Greg Jericho, Katharine 
Murphy and others.

Thanks for your company. Have a great Christmas break and here’s to coming 
back refreshed in the new year.

Good afternoon.

Richard Di Natale, Greens leader:

There is one message in this Myefo for everyday Australians: unless you’re a 
big corporation or Liberal party donor, you don’t matter.

Malcolm Turnbull’s plan to hand out tax cuts to the wealthiest Australians 
while wage growth remains stagnant is a slap in the face to ordinary 
Australians doing it tough.

There is nothing in the Turnbull government’s economic program that addresses 
the major risks to the economy from the housing bubble or that eases the 
growing gap between the rich and everyone else.
 
An statement from S&P Global:

Global Ratings said today that the Australian government’s midyear budget 
update has no immediate effect on the credit rating or outlook on the 
commonwealth ofAustralia 
<https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/entityPage.do?sp_mid=76075&sp_rid=2138306&entityId=100187&elqTrackId=d7e0a04d7cb144aabfb8356ff2e0002e&elq=9e426f78a1db4c649f148fb1302d5509&elqaid=76075&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=>
 (unsolicited ratings AAA/Negative/A-1+).

The government’s worsening forecast fiscal position, as outlined in its latest 
budget projections earlier today, further pressures the rating.

We remain pessimistic about the government’s ability to close existing budget 
deficits and return a balanced budget by the year ending 30 June 2021.

Over the coming months, we will continue to monitor the government’s 
willingness and ability to enact new budget savings or revenue measures to 
reduce fiscal deficits materially over the next few years.

The Business Council of Australia’s Jennifer Westacott says Myefo underlines 
that Australia can continue to muddle along and “sleepwalk into lower living 
standards” or seize the opportunity to deliver a stronger budget.

Why?

The MYEFO update makes it clear we must intensify efforts to meet the twin 
budget objectives of reducing the rate of growth in spending and accelerating 
economic growth. This means continuing to redesign major spending programs to 
improve the quality of spending, cut waste and deliver better value for 
taxpayer dollars. At the same time, we must better equip the economy to support 
jobs and prosperity.

Politicians must move on from the phony, dead-end argument that supporting 
growth comes at the cost of fairness.Growth and fairness go hand in hand 
because growth creates economic opportunity.

Only economic growth can create jobs, higher wages and the revenue to pay for 
the health, education and welfare services Australians value.

And only economic growth can ensure this country becomes more capable each 
year of caring for all of its citizens, no matter what their circumstances.

We can no longer afford to ignore or be complacent about this reality.”
