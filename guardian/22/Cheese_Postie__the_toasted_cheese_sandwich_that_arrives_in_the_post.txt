Name: Cheese <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cheese> Postie.

Age: Just born.

Appearance: Lovely and crisp on the outside, soft and unctuous in the middle.

Is this something you eat? Definitely! It’s a toasted cheese sandwich that 
arrives in the post <http://www.gadgette.com/2015/06/29/cheese-posties-review/>!

Won’t that be a little cold? Ah, but you toast it yourself, you see.

So it’s a sandwich that arrives in the post? Not quite. You have to butter the 
bread, spread the sauce, arrange the cheese, put the whole thing in a 
toaster-proof bag … but otherwise they’ve done everything! All for just £3.99 a 
week!

 Mmm … the constituent parts of a Cheese Postie. Photograph: PR company handout 
Won’t the bits go manky? “The cheeses we are using are OK to be out of the 
fridge for up to four days and the bread is a really good quality that stays 
fresher for longer than your average loaf,” says one of the co-founders, Dave 
Rotheroe.

He’s a chef, is he? Not exactly. Technically, the word for what he does is “IT 
contractor”.

Right. And the other co-founder? That will be Dan Jennings. He works in 
logistics. The two men have devised about 100 different combinations of bread, 
cheese and condiments.

To recap then: I get day-old ingredients for a needlessly unusual cheese 
sandwich designed by two blokes, and at a much higher price than I’d normally 
pay. I can’t eat the sandwich when I like, or make another if I’m still hungry. 
I just have to wait until the post arrives. That’s a good summary, yes. Want to 
invest?

I’ll pass. That’s a pity. Because Cheese Postie is going places. Rotheroe and 
Jennings sought £2,000 for it onthe crowdfunding platform Kickstarter 
<https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lickmydip/cheese-posties/description>, 
and ended up being swamped with £3,809 from eager customer-investors. The first 
packages will leave the factory in late August or early September.

Well I never. There is actually quite a big market for postal food and drink, 
remember.Graze.com <https://www.graze.com/uk/> is doing well with its 
needlessly expensive snacks, while the needlessly expensive craft beer service
Beer52 was startup of the year in 2014 
<http://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/knowledge/articles/2014/12/startups-awards-winners/>
. Rotheroe has already crowdfunded a chilli-sauce-by-post business calledLick 
My Dip <http://www.lickmydip.com>.

Both eurgh and ow. You forgot kerching.

Do say: Credit where it’s fondue.

Don’t say: I’ll brielieve it when I see it.
