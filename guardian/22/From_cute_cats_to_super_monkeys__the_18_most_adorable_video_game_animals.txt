It’s a question that has bothered gamers – and pet lovers – for many years. 
Exactly what is the cutest animal ever to appear in video game form? Certainly 
pixellated critters have been a staple protagonist for game designers since 
Donkey Kong first stamped his way up the building in Nintendo’s 1981 arcade 
classic.

Since then, as in the world of animated movies, there have been many hundreds 
of anthropomorphised heroes – with designers relying heavily on our instinctual 
protective love of small animals with gigantic eyes.

Here then, are the 18 cutest examples in video game history. Feel free to add 
your own favourites in the comments.

18. Ecco the Dolphin

realistic simulation Photograph: Sega 
Gaming’s most beloved time-travelling cetacean was a superstar on the Sega 
Mega-Drive console, where his trippy underwater adventures contrasted with the 
urban brawlers that dominated the era. Ecco could sing to his friends and do 
backflips out of the water, providing an experience that was surprisingly 
calmingand authentic – apart from that whole thing about him discovering 
Atlantis and foiling an extraterrestrial invasion plot.

17. Diddy Kong (Donkey Kong Country)

He’s a cheeky spider monkey in a Nintendo cap – what’s not to love? Originally 
conceived as an updated version of Donkey Kong Jr,Nintendo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo> wasn’t pleased with how much 
Donkey Kong Country developer Rare had changed the original 1982 character so 
asked for it to be renamed. Of course, Rare went with Diddy Kong. Why wouldn’t 
they? A legend was born.

16. Epona (Legend of Zelda)

The creators of Zelda could have made Link’s trustworthy companion little more 
than an equine vehicle, a game mechanic to get you from A to B in a speedier 
fashion. Instead Epona is introduced to us in Ocarina of Time with a lovingly 
crafted tale of longing, connection and reunion. Also, you summon her with a 
really beautiful lullaby. If only there was a “Press X to feed sugar cubes” 
command.

15. Dogmeat (Fallout series)

 Dogmeat – your faithful and slightly murderous companion in Fallout 4 
Photograph: Bethesda 
You first meet this trusty canine companion after his owner is beaten to death 
by thugs in the original Fallout. For some reason, he distrusts everyone, but 
if you show him kindness (or dress like his former owner – dogs aren’t fussy) 
he will become your own loveable, yet savage, attack dog. In Fallout 4, you can 
put a bandana and goggles on him, JUST LIKE A REAL DOG.

 Fable II: “Go on boy, see what you can dig up! Go on! ... Ewww, put it back!” 
Photograph: Microsoft/Lionhead 
Another dog? Yes, shut up! Fable II’s “Dog” – well, mine was called “Pig” and 
yours was probably called “Bastard” or “Buttface”, knowing you – was a 
wonderful comrade on your dangerous journey through Albion.Spoiler alert: At 
the end of the game you could choose to resurrect thousands of fallen warriors 
– or your dead dog. We all chose the same ending, right? The world could burn 
for all I cared, as long as Pig was by my side, digging up condoms (actually a 
feature in the game) and barking at treasure.

 Portal weighted companion cube. So cute Photograph: Valve 
Is this technically a critter? No? Do we care? Not really. This lovable 
resident of the Apature Lab has been taken by canny merchandisers and turned 
into plushes, cookie jars, keyrings... and pants, which is totally bizarre for 
a thing that is just a large box. No one feels this way about the crates in 
Zelda or Crash Bandicoot, do they? Well, those don’t have big, lovely hearts on 
them, of course. The Weighted Companion Cube, on the other hand, is iconic – 
and, continually destroyed by evil computer GlaDOS, it’s a great joke about 
emotional attachment in video games.

OK, everyone remembers Pa Rappa the Rappa, Sony’s paper-thin rapping hero from 
the originalPlayStation <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/playstation> 
era. However, we have too many dogs in this list, so let’s hear it for Lammy, 
the anxious lamb guitarist who stars in the excellent sequel. Once again 
designer Masaya Matsuura and artist Rodney Alan Greenblat combined to fill 
their game with kooky characters and bizarre rhythm action challenges, but 
nothing outshone Lammy, with her red hair, on-point 1990s fashions and tendency 
to panic.

 Amaterasu the god, who comes to Earth in the form of a super cute wolf, as any 
sensible deity would Photograph: Capcom 
Proof that a game protagonist doesn’t have to be a grizzled, gruff dude with a 
beard to be compelling, Amaterasu is the fluffiest incarnation of a god that 
this industry has ever imagined. The game’s beautiful aesthetic, designed to 
resemble Japanese ink illustration, manages to convey both the serious godlike 
persona of Amaterasu and the playful nature of the wolf body she inhabits. 
Bonus points for her even-cuter baby wolflet, Chibiterasu, in the DS-only 
sequel Okamiden.

 Missile – the best name you can possibly give to a supernatural Pomeranian 
Photograph: Capcom 
Do ghosts have pets? That is the question that haunts Capcom’s supernatural 
adventure, in which the player takes control of a spectre trying to save living 
people. Missile starts off as just another dog – a very loud, slightly annoying 
Pomeranian that really wants to help, but ends up being shot. Pretty dark 
stuff, but then he comes back as a ghost and helps you out in your quest to do 
supernatural good deeds. Missile also turns up in Ace Attorney, but he’s not 
dead in that game, so not quite as cute. This is why all ghosts should have 
pets.

Photograph: Square Enix 
Ah, the lovely Chocobo. Not quite a chicken, not quite a horse, would probably 
taste delicious but that’s a bit weird and let’s not go there. You won’t find a 
bird this accommodating in real life, willing to carry your overburdened butt 
into battle and back, as well as being used for races, breeding and inventory 
management. But they’re socute. Especially the fat ones, which can store extra 
stuff inside their big, yellow bellies. Just don’t ask how, it’s probably gross.

The. Best. Animal Crossing. Villager. Hands. Down. Ever. Marshal is a grumpy 
but adorable little squirrel-dude who’s a total gentleman, and if it were 
possible and not weird to date Animal Crossing characters, he’d be a smash hit 
on Tinder. He’s also surprisingly flirty for a character in a sweet, childlike 
game, always telling you that you look nice and turning up to your house 
unexpectedly … Obviously if this was real life we’d get a restraining order, 
but in Animal Crossing, we love this smug, squirrel-faced Lothario.

Miyamoto’s least favourite racer. Miyamoto, you monster.

Normally, cats have mood swings and ignore you and scratch you. Even if 
they’re generally nice cats, they are arseholes. The cats in cat collecting 
game Neko Atsume don’t pretend to love you – they’re blatantly just here for 
the food. But still, they’re so cute, when they’re sitting inside a cardboard 
train or staring right at you while wearing a tiny cat-sized cowboy hat. Even 
Tubbs, unanimously agreed upon to be the Worst Cat because he eats all the 
food, is cute. He just wants to be your friend (so he can eat all your food).

veteran video game company couldn’t have known what a simian mega hit it had on 
its hands. The lead character, AiAi, is the game’s charming focus, with his 
cow’s lick hair, giant ears and evident joy at navigating a series of perilous 
platform worlds in a giant hamster ball.

Sonic is not cute. He’s too cool and spiky, and standing there tapping your 
foot and occasionally making a thumbs-up gesture, is not cute, it’s obnoxious. 
Tails, though,is cute, with his wide eyes, yellowy fur and ability to hover in 
the air like a foxy helicopter.

Sure, Kirby’s cute. But Waddle Dees, the inhabitants of Nintendo’s Dream Land 
platformers, are another dimension of cute. Kirby has a mouth and a solid 
personality; a Waddle Dee is mouthless and voiceless and his main personality 
trait seems to be “sometimes has an umbrella”. Occasionally, the Waddle Dees 
work for series antagonist King Dedede, but usually they waddle around the 
overworld being gorgeous. Kirby has probably inhaled hundreds of them 
throughout his adventures, and that’s why Kirby, although cute, is also the 
worst.

Sure, it’s easy making a cute monkey, but a cute dinosaur? That’s more of a 
challenge. And its a challenge that Taito designer Fukio Mitsuji was up to in 
1986 when he created Bubble Bobble, the inventive platforming game featuring 
two prehistoric monsters with unlikely bubble-blowing capabilities. So beloved 
where these rotund reptilians that the game spawned a vast range of sequels and 
spin-offs, including the brilliant Puzzle Bobble series.

When Pokemon Yellow introduced Pikachu as an overworld companion, the gaming 
universe changed forever. In previous role-playing adventures, you travelled 
alone or with other hardy warriors. In Pokemon, however, you had a tubby yellow 
plush toy toddling after you, occasionally offering helpful insights in the 
form of cute facial expressions. Pikachu actually starts off sort of loathing 
you, but by the end, he’s all smiles and yells of “PIKAAAAA”. That’s how 
friendship works in real-life, right? Right?

Anyway, out of the hundreds of Pokemon candidates for gaming’s cutest animal – 
and despite the doe-eyed presence of Jigglypuff and Squirtle – it had to be 
‘chu.
