Perfect skin is a myth. Perfect skin, the kind that glows, shining in a way 
that makes you think not of sweat and panic but of hundreds of years of good 
breeding, and three litres of water a day, comes from a series of bottles, 
which you will find below. These are tricks. They “blur” (under your make-up), 
they conceal, making you look as glowy as the models at Thakoon. And, puffed on 
with a massive brush over your face before you leave the house, they blend and 
they pretend.
