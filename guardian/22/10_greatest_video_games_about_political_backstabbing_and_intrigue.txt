Video games are often criticised for their outlandish story lines, but 
considering what’s been happening in British politics this week, they now seem 
like a perfectly sensible place to learn about the world.

So if you’ve not yet had your fill of plot twists, back-stabs and last minute 
turn arounds, here are gaming’s greatest power struggles.

Ubisoft’s historical hitman games always mix the stalk and stab action with a 
rich, twisty-turny plot, and this one is especially sneaky, pitching the 
Borgias against the Medici clan in renaissance Italy. ButAssassin’s Creed II 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/nov/17/assassins-creed-2-game-review>
 goes one better than featuring Machiavellian politics – it actual features 
Machiavelli himself, cropping up as a useful ally amid the picturesque 
slaughter.

 Civilization VI. Photograph: 2K Games 
Sure, you can play Sid Meier’s globe-spanning strategy sims as a noble leader 
and tactician, but it’s much more fun to be a duplicitous psychopath, endlessly 
toying with foreign rulers. Nothing beats letting them think you’re an ally who 
really, honestly does take that peace treaty seriously ... before driving your 
tanks through their cities and nuking the capital.

 Crusader Kings II. Photograph: Paradox 
While Civilization is all about guiding a whole nation to political or 
military glory, this Medieval strategy sim is about maintaining a single 
bloodline, whatever the cost – and that’s as likely to involve strategically 
beneficial marriages and gruesome assassinations as it is victory on the 
battlefield. It’s a cynical, clandestine view of power and motivation that 
seems pretty suitable for our current political climate.

Positech’s complex trio of political sims put you in charge of a modern 
democratic country as you seek to control everything from the economy to the 
crime rate, while manipulating voters. If you fancy role-playing as Boris 
Johnson, simply install the game, load it up then immediately leave so that 
someone else has to do it.

GTA has always played with the familiar gangster movie themes of betrayal and 
ambition, but Vice City has the greatest cast of crime clans, corrupt 
politicians and power hungry henchmen the series has ever produced. Right in 
the middle of it all is Tommy Vercetti, stirring up trouble (ie insane 
hyper-violence) between the rival Forelli and Vance families. They were 
probably all at Eton together.

It may look like a standard fantasy-themed hack ’em up, but Shadow of Mordor 
adds a clever “Nemesis” system, allowing players to manipulate the hierarchy of 
the evil orc army by either killing or possessing key generals. Enemies also 
bear long grudges against the player, which only come to light during battle – 
or two days into a leadership election campaign.

<http://kotaku.com/why-you-should-play-suikoden-ii-one-of-the-best-rpgs-e-1668857424>
 as Game of Thrones meets Pokemon – a sprawling tale of warring states, in 
which the player starts out as a lowly knight with a nice castle but no allies. 
Like Corbyn, you find yourself having to quickly build a new regime of loyal 
warriors. Unlike Corbyn you can recruit from over 100 willing candidates.

The classic cyberpunk strategy shooter is set in a world where warring 
corporations have replaced elected governments and where the population is 
controlled via small devices that utterly manipulate each user’s understanding 
of the world and render them docile and compliant. Apparently, this was science 
fiction in 1993.

An ironic take on the grand strategy genre, Tropico gives players control of a 
remote island state where electoral fraud, covert nuclear testing and other 
corruptions are enthusiastically encouraged. With its violently factional 
populace and bizarre insular policies, it could easily be re-skinned as a 
Brexit training sim.

 Witcher 2. Photograph: CD Projekt Red 
The second title in CD Projekt Red’s monster hunting fantasy adventure has an 
overtly political narrative, taking place amid the chaotic power vacuum 
following the murder of a king. White-haired beast killer Geralt must navigate 
this viper’s nest of conspirators, murderers and would-be rulers, as vast 
armies prepare to clash over the whims of mad men. In short: more treachery, 
sex and violence than a Tory party conference.
