Nicholas was working on Channel Nine’s coverage of the Australia v Pakistan 
Test at the Melbourne cricket ground on both days, but was not on air at the 
time.

Channel Nine issued a short statement on Thursday morning, confirming Nicholas 
would take leave to focus on his health.

“Mark is taking leave to resolve his health issues,” a spokeswoman said. “He 
wants to thank everyone again for their kind wishes and continued support.”

The former England A captain was stretchered out of Channel Nine’s 
broadcasting facilities after lunch on Monday, and rushed to hospital. He was 
discharged from hospital later that night, and was said to be in good spirits.

He wanted to return to work on Tuesday, but Channel Nine told him to take a 
day of rest.

Nicholas returned to Channel Nine’s coverage on Wednesday, the third day of 
the test, but became ill again during the final session. He was taken by 
ambulance to Epworth hospital, again suffering abdominal pains.

The third and final Test of the series begins in Sydney next week.
