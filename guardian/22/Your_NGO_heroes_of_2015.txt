Fikr Shalltoot, director of programmes in Gaza, Medical Aid for Palestinians 
<http://www.map-uk.org/>


“I’d love to nominate Fikr because she led our Gaza team with incredible 
courage and humanity during MAP’s emergency aid response to the attacks on Gaza 
last year.” From Al Maghazi refugee camp and a nurse by training, Shalltoot’s 
team was one of the first medical organisations to respond to the 2014 Gaza 
crisis, providing more medical supplies to hospitals than any other NGO. “In 
the face of eight years of blockades and closures of Gaza and the stalled 
reconstruction, Fikr has continued to show inspirational leadership and has 
been a powerful voice for Palestinians in Gaza.” Nominated by Rohan Talbot, 
campaigns and media officer, Map

Mohamed Adow, climate adviser, Christian Aid <http://www.christianaid.org.uk/>

Mohamed hails from Kenya but works here in the UK. He has been the climate 
adviser at ChristianAid <https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/aid> 
for more than five years and also acts as the global chair for the Climate 
Action Network (CAN International), the coordinating umbrella body of all NGO 
climate advocacy around the world. “With the historic victory of the Paris 
climate agreement, he is a worthy hero this year in particular,” says Tom Viita 
who nominated him.

“The thing that impresses me most about Mohamed is his humility. Within the 
UNFCCC negotiations, Mohamed knew everybody. He is on first name terms with 
every developing country negotiator, has great expertise in complex policy 
issues, and can navigate through the most arcane negotiations among 195 
countries with fluency. Despite these attributes, Mohamed is definitely not “an 
ego” – he always talks of “we” not “me”, and likes to emphasise that he does 
not speak “for Christian Aid” but for the world’s poorest people. He never 
boasts, and he lets his successes stay behind the scenes. That wins him 
respect, makes him an excellent negotiator, and ensures that NGOs and 
governments trust him.”Nominated by Tom Viita, senior UK political advisor,

Platform Photograph: Laura Keenan/Mercy Corps 
 “More than 15,000 mobilisers and community campaigners made the Mercy 
Corps-led ECAP project a success. Young people, chiefs, religious leaders, 
women’s leaders, teachers and many more worked tirelessly; going door to door, 
doing ‘palava hut’ discussions, leading community theatre sessions, going on 
the local radio – all talking to people in their communities about Ebola, and 
how this devastating virus could be prevented. Community engagement was widely 
credited for turning the tide of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and for building 
acceptance of the preventive measures, especially on some of the more 
challenging issues such as safe burials. They were motivated, effective, and 
showed that Ebola could be beaten – definitely our heroes.”Amy Fairbairn, 
fundraising communications and media manager, Mercy Corps

hardest.’ Photograph: Global Communities Liberia 
“George Woryonwon of Global Communities Liberia has been for decades – and 
remains today – dedicated to helping the people of Liberia. During the Ebola 
crisis, he trained and managed several burial and disinfection teams and worked 
with communities to help build trust and understand the threat posed by Ebola. 
His work earned him InterAction’s 2015 Humanitarian Award.

At a frightening time when people were fleeing and many in the international 
community were paralysed by uncertainty and fear, George was on the front lines 
working with the communities that were hit hardest. His dedication to his work 
and the people of his country are an ideal for everyone in the NGO community to 
aspire to.”Amy Levey, senior communications officers, Global Communities
