Take me there: Comporta, Portugal


Why go?
Comporta is the beach retreat of choice for Lisbon’s fashion and media set, 
who decamp here at weekends to hang out in chichi fisherman’s cottages just an 
hour’s drive from the city. Think of it as a Portuguese Whitstable, only with 
vast sandy beaches instead of small pebbly ones, sun-bleached seafood shacks 
instead of wind-battered ice cream vans, pink flamingos instead of seagulls and 
Brazilian models instead of… OK, so it’s nothing like Whitstable. A lack of 
accommodation has kept Comporta under the radar, but that’s changing, with the 
arrival last year of a gorgeous new hotel and rumours of a five-star Aman 
Resort on the horizon.

What to do
There’s nothing to do and that’s the point of Comporta. Life revolves around 
the beach – pootling from sun lounger to seafood restaurant is about as active 
as it gets. But if you insist, you can learn to surf (surfincomporta.com 
<http://www.surfincomporta.com/>), or hire a canoe in the Sado Estuary nature 
reserve 
<https://www.visitportugal.com/en/NR/exeres/E2223FC4-6F19-4A6F-A7E4-F9DD279685A9>
, which is home to dolphins, flamingos and nesting storks.

Where to stay
Sublime Comporta is a cosseting new country retreat on a 17-acre estate, which 
has 14 minimalist bedrooms – each with polished concrete floors, white linen, 
bamboo furniture and a private terrace – and an infinity pool (from £139 per 
night;sublimecomporta.pt <http://sublimecomporta.pt/hotel-overview.html>).

Where to eat
Dine on clams, salt cod and squid-ink rice while gazing across the dunes to 
the Atlantic at the ever-popular Sal on Prego beach (restaurantesal.pt 
<http://www.restaurantesal.pt/>).

Insider tip 
Jason Martin, a British artist who works in Comporta and is creating 
a vineyard and garden, recommends horse riding on the beach with José Ribeiro (
cavalosnaareia.com <http://www.cavalosnaareia.com/cavalosnaareia/>). “The horse 
riding here is phenomenal. You can ride through the rice fields which sit 
behind the dunes and then on to these Atlantic beaches which are completely 
deserted. It’s an amazing way to engage with the landscape.”
