It’s 10am and a selection of Australian alpha nerds are emerging from their 
tents in a former campground outside Ballan in country Victoria. They’re here 
forBuzzConf <https://buzzconf.io/>, a high-technology and futurism conference 
by day and music festival by night.

Geeks have always loved their outdoor music festivals and in 2015, two 
Melbourne-based developers Rick Giner and Ben Dechrai kicked off BuzzConf with 
a lineup of top-tier tech speakers and local music talent.

Time to tap into technology

It’s a wide brief – there’s everything from augmented reality and biotech to 
space travel. There are plenty of on-site soldering irons and a fleet of 3D 
printers. There’s also a beer tent stocked with local craft brews and a live 
act playing each night.

This is a conference designed with inclusivity in mind: of 11 speakers, six 
are women – almost unheard-of in the notoriously male tech industry.

Dr Leila Alem, an industry leader in virtual and augmented reality, is here to 
reveal her inside knowledge on bringing the ideas that drive Pokémon Go and 
Snapchat flower crowns to the workplace. A Pilbara mining worker fixes 
machinery with remote visual instructions from an expert in Perth. Cows are 
kitted out with Fitbit-style Silent Herdsman wearable health monitors. A 
brain-monitoring SmartCap detects when a driver is getting sleepy and wakes 
them up.

Another session offers a new perspective on how we pay for our media. Nic 
Hodges, head of commercial innovation for News Corp Australia, wants to harness 
new blockchain technology (used in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency) as a way of 
allowing people to pay for their media as they consume it: a cent or 10 here, a 
chunk of an article, picture, slice of an episode or chapter of a book there. 
It’s a hot-button issue, with newspapers struggling, grandmothers asking 
grandkids to pirate TV shows for them, and media producers finding their 
content with someone else’s watermark on it (and someone else’s advertising in 
the sidebar).

In the workshop tent, people are introduced to the new ESP8266 chips: a tiny 
programmable Wi-Fi-enabled microprocessor, a tenth of the price of comparable 
Arduino or Raspberry Pi boards (a Chinese innovation that was quietly released 
without any English documentation to knock down the price of consumer 
electronics).

These gadgets are cheap enough to allow you to add anything you like to the 
“internet of things”. Want your toaster to text you when breakfast’s ready? Get 
soldering.

The keynote speech is on space. Developer and public speaker Paul Fenwick 
wants to solve the world’s problems and, when in doubt, solve them with space 
travel. Mining one single asteroid could provide humanity with a wealth of rare 
minerals. Putting our solar panels in space could ramp their efficiency orders 
of magnitude.

And if you can solve a problem with space, why wouldn’t you? Space is cool. 
Everyone loves space. Even more than they love using a specially-developed 
website to honk the horn of the Tesla S series that’s parked outside the tent.

games Photograph: BuzzConf 2016 
Families are encouraged to attend, with free entry for children at an 
otherwise pricey event. The kids play with endearing anthropomorphic, 
pod-shaped Dash and Dot robots, building games with BitsBox and bushwhacking 
zombies in a Minecraft treasure hunt. At the end, they present their games to 
popular acclaim. (You can try outSkulls <https://bitsbox.com/run.html?81e5c> by 
Keiran Taylor, age six.)

It’s hard to tell if anyone’s going to leave an event like BuzzConf with a 
genuine take-home bag of inspiration, creativity and connection, but they’re 
definitely going to leave with that happy exhaustion and yearning for a shower 
that comes after a great outdoor festival.

And if they’ve managed to build a hat with a BuzzConf badge that wiggles every 
time someone tweets the #buzzconf hashtag ... well, that’s just gravy, really.
