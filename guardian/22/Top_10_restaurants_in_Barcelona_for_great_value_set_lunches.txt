Everyone loves tapas but sometimes you can’t face another plate of patatas 
bravas. Forget standing in a crowded bar trying to avoid being stabbed in the 
eye by a tourist wielding a cocktail stick loaded with chorizo: it’s time for a 
proper meal, with chairs, and tables. But restaurants in a place such as 
Barcelona can empty your wallet quickly; the answer is a menú del día, the 
ubiquitous set lunch. The best offer good value and quality and they’ll see you 
through to the evening and back on the tapas trail.

All menús here include three courses, a drink and bread unless stated

La Polpa, Eixample

A wander up Passeig de Gràcia is pretty much a must-do, whether you’re gawping 
at Gaudí buildings or heading for the shops. But the Eixample is proper moneyed 
Barcelona. The shops, the people, and the restaurants are expensive. That’s why 
La Polpa, a couple of blocks off the Passeig, is such a find. It’s got linen 
napkins, smartly dressed staff and a patina of posh, but the menú is still only 
€10.30. That really is astonishingly good value for this part of town. The food 
is modern and expertly turned out. A standout was an exceptionally tasty loin 
of tuna in teriyaki sauce. Even the house wine, a muscat, was a cut above the 
usual menú offerings.

The Raval, just off the Ramblas, is, despite everyone’s best efforts to talk 
it up, still rough and ready in parts. Carrer de l’Hospital, all phone shops 
and dive bars, is fascinating and when you want a break you can duck into the 
courtyard of the 15th-century Hospital de la Santa Creu. It’s a lovely quiet 
space and there’s a little open-air restaurant, El Jardi, which puts out great 
food from its tiny kitchen. It’s not fancy stuff but delicious. I had a thick 
leek and potato soup packed with flavour and a hearty lentil and sausage 
casserole. Handily, this place ticks another spot off the Gaudí trail: the old 
hospital is where the architect died after being knocked down by a tram in 1926.

Walk north from l’Hospital and Raval gets more salubrious and positively 
trendy. There will probably be plenty of time here to watch the world go by 
because this vegetarian restaurant is very popular and at the busiest times 
diners have to wait for a table. The staff are rushed off their feet but still 
stay friendly and the decor – bare brick walls and tartan upholstery – doesn’t 
try too hard. For €13 you get to choose from a starter of soup or salad, mains 
(divided into cereals, rice, vegetable or pasta) and a fruit salad to finish. 
Drinks, bread and fancier deserts are extra. It’s all wholesome stuff but far 
from worthy.

are packed with interesting, independent shops and new places to eat and drink 
open at a bewilderingly pace. BeautifulSanta Maria del Mar church 
<http://www.santamariadelmarbarcelona.org/home/> is the heart of the barrio and 
Petra restaurant is tucked away on a lane on its flank. Behind its 
stained-glass windows lie tiled walls (don’t worry, it’s not as cliched as it 
sounds: the chandeliers are made of spoons and knives) and a dozen or so 
tables. I had pumpkin gnocchi, spicy chicken in a moscatel sauce andcrema 
catalana with baked apple. All good. Cheery chef and co-owner Joan Pluvinet 
somehow finds time to work the tables.

NAP, Born

Ah, pizza, the go-to food for all weary tourists. But Barcelona (and Pisa, 
Rome, Naples and more) has committed its fair share of crimes against this 
simple dish. That probably explains why NAP (the owners are from Naples) is 
such a success: it takes pizza back to its delicious basics. The list of pizzas 
is refreshingly short, just a dozen; €7.50 gets youbruschetta to start, a 
margherita and a soft drink. Fancier pizzas are a few euros more.Tiramisu, 
panna cotta and cheesecake add another €3 or so. No piped music and fishing 
nets here, just a simple, clean design. There is also a new, very popular 
branch in Barceloneta, near the beach.

Poble Sec, a few minutes from Raval and in the shadow of Montjuïc hill, is a 
bit off most tourists’ itineraries but its quiet streets, pretty squares and 
friendly locals make it worth the detour. It’s being billed as the “new Born” 
but thankfully has some way to go yet. The standout spot for tapas is tiny

 (Carrer del Poeta Cabanyes, 25, +34 934 423 142) but a friend took me to Luki, 
in the corner of Plaça del Sortidor. The decor is exuberant, but in a good way. 
The aubergine ravioli were fantastic, followed by slices of rolled chicken in a 
brandy sauce. For once, I skipped desert, except for a spoon or two of my 
friend’s chocolate tart.

OK, you’re trapped in the old town, tapas to the left, touts to the right. 
There’s no escape – time to go old school at the “House of Spoons”. It claims 
to be the oldest restaurant in Barcelona and the menú doesn’t feel like it has 
changed in a couple of hundred years. It’s always packed with Spanish families, 
gossipingabuelas and tourists. And they all look like they are having a very 
good time. Individual dishes are such good value (goose with apples is lovely, 
filling and only €9.50) that they almost make the €17.50 menú look expensive, 
but three courses give plenty of time to enjoy the atmosphere. The fish soup is 
not too heavy, which was a good job because I followed it with pig’s trotter 
cooked in cava and the inevitablecrema catalana.

Tourists stream to the beach along Passeig de Joan de Borbó, the main drag of 
the old fishermen’s quarter of Barceloneta. The unfortunate ones get hooked in 
by one of the many desperately poor restaurants here. The only good one I knew 
wasSuquet de l’Almirall <http://www.suquetdelalmirall.com/>, but it’s 
expensive. Thankfully, a friend introduced me to La Mar Salada a few doors 
along. Take a table in the sunlit white interior or sit outside and 
people-watch. I had cream of artichoke soup, topped with a poached egg, my 
friend spinach and mushroom cannelloni in almond sauce. Then we had 
langoustines sautéed with vegetables and served in a lime sauce and confit of 
duck with oranges and turnips. Desserts – carrot cake with Greek yoghurt, and 
white chocolate cake with a strawberry centre, were absolutely wonderful. The 
same family own nearbyCan Ros <http://www.canros.cat/>, which is more 
traditional and a few euros cheaper.

La Singular, Gràcia

EatWith: how to find a supper club around the world

<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jun/21/eatwith-barcelona-supper-club-scene>
There are many bars and restaurants to choose from in Gràcia’s charming 
streets but you’ll struggle to do better than here. Gràcia was a village until 
the city gobbled it up in the 19th century but the barrio retains a sense of 
community. La Singular fits in perfectly: it only has 10 tables and is a cosy 
locals’ favourite. It’s been going for years but still feels fresh and 
innovative. The food is classic Catalan with a bit of a twist. The €10 menú 
lists, for example, a salad of baby lettuce hearts in anchovy sauce, veal with 
endives, red peppers and brie, and mousse ofmató (a Catalan soft white cheese) 
with a fruit coulis.

El Clandestino, Sarrià

Sarrià is another village subsumed by the city, but it pretends that never 
happened. Little old ladies wander around with little dogs in their handbags 
and people greet each other on the street. It’s one of the city’s most 
desirable districts and there are lots of great, but expensive, places to eat. 
I wanted to recommendVivanda <http://www.vivanda.cat/?lang=en> on Carrer Major 
de Sarrià but it doesn’t have a menú to make it affordable, andTram-Tram 
<http://tram-tram.com/cat/home.php>, also on Carrer Major de Sarrià, has just 
put its menú up to €28. Never mind, El Clandestino in the heart of the barrio 
is very good and very sensibly priced. Unusually, there are half a dozen 
choices for each course. Nothing too fancy, but very well done – I’ll be trying 
to cook their beans with clams at home. Butt cheek of cow was delicious – and 
sounds better in Spanish. And if you’re still hungry and ready to get back to 
tapas, Barcelona’s best patatas bravas are served just round the corner at Bar 
Tomás (Carrer Major de Sarrià, 49).
