As I wander down a dark, narrow street in Gràcia, one of Barcelona's northern 
neighbourhoods, I am not sure that I'm in the right place. Then I spot a 
strange scene that assures me I haven't taken a wrong turn. Through a 
townhouse's wide glass doors, I spy six expectant-looking people sitting around 
a long table, while a man at the back is carefully arranging a row of plates on 
a makeshift bar.

"Is this EatWith?" I ask tentatively, but I already know the answer.

Dining in unusual places with people that you've never met is what Eatwith.com 
<http://www.eatwith.com/> was invented for. The website is an online directory 
ofsupper clubs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/11/five-best-supper-clubs-do-something>
: anyone can apply to be a host, in their home or a venue of their  choice, and 
anyone who pays a small fee can attend. Founded in Tel Aviv, the site has had 
an incredible first year, expanding to feature 20 countries, including the US, 
Japan, Brazil and Italy. But it's in Barcelona, the official launch city, that 
it is the most active, with an astonishing 200 hosts. And so this is where I 
come to give it a trial run.

Earlier, after logging in and browsing the options on the website, I'd found 
myself drawn to the idea of a chocolate-themed night. Although most events take 
place in people's dining rooms, this one proves slightly different. The ground 
floor of the house has been transformed into an events space byMiquel 
<http://www.eatwith.com/#!/host/1560>, a thirtysomething, self-taught artisan 
chocolatier. Whitewashed walls cocoon an interior that's almost empty, bar a 
few well-sourced pieces of vintage furniture – an old fridge here, a hefty 
chest of drawers there.

The online description was a little vague ("It's just creativity and 
madness!"), so I'm not sure what to expect. What I get is a remarkably 
imaginative, multi-course tasting menu. First: a smooth chocolate fondant, 
covered in a lightly whipped carrot mousse. Next: tender ravioli, filled with 
lentils and chocolate, in a miso broth. It's weird but it works. Both dishes 
are perfectly executed, attractively presented and surprisingly moreish. And 
the meal costs me just £13 – about the same as a tour of the Sagrada Família.
 Miquel hosting an EatWith evening. 
Miquel says EatWith – which takes 15% of what each guest pays – is serving him 
well as he tries to build up his business of making and, he hopes, exporting 
chocolates. "People ask why I don't just get customers off the streets," he 
says, "but I like the flexibility. I like the characteristics of the people it 
brings. This is not a shop. I am not looking to compete with normal 
chocolatiers."

Although EatWith originally set out to target tourists, the biggest uptake in 
locations all over the world has come from locals. My fellow diners all live in 
Barcelona, despite originating from places as far-flung as Mexico, Sweden, 
Canada, France and Italy. Two of them are EatWith hosts themselves: outgoing 
Andrea, the Italian, hosts pizza parties in his back garden, and Monica, a 
firecracker from Mexico City, holds Mexican/Syrian food nights, to reflect her 
own mixed heritage.

Underpinning the site is an idea that everyone should have some sort of USP – 
be that the cuisine, the theme or the setting. To keep standards up, EatWith 
approves all its hosts, and those wanting to gain an additional "verified" 
badge can also be visited by an inspector, who will check their menu, venue and 
interpersonal skills. Some would say supper clubs should be more of an 
underground network, operating without a middleman but at least this site is 
taking responsibility, and offering its hosts support and, in some places, 
informal training.
 Xabi preparing food for his dinner party 
Over the course of my weekend, I try two other EatWith dinners to get an idea 
of the variety on offer. One night I find myself in a fully open-plan apartment 
belonging toXabi <http://www.eatwith.com/#!/host/149>, a professional chef who 
has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants. He was runningsupper clubs and 
cookery classes <http://club-santarita.com/> before EatWith but the site has 
given him a wider reach. He serves a six-course menu (£43pp including wine), 
ably assisted by a grandmotherly type called Àngels, who squeezes my arm as she 
sets down every dish: potato ravioli with truffle mayonnaise andrusiñol (a 
local mushroom), andsuquet (Catalan fish stew) with fennel confit.

My final meal is with a young couple, Vanessa and Renato 
<http://www.eatwith.com/#!/host/3005>, who offer a night of traditional Catalan 
food in their one-bedroom apartment in the city centre. Here, we dig into 
deliciousesqueixada de bacallà (salt cod with tomatoes, onions, olives and 
vinegar) andfideuà, a Catalonian paella made with noodles. Before all this we 
try drinking wine out of aporró – those traditional glass carafes with a spout 
you hold above your mouth, moving your arm further and further away as your 
pour. It's an ice-breaker with a difference and I last about three seconds 
before dribbling down my front.

Vanessa and Renato's dinner is also unlike the others because they join us to 
eat, rather than just serving the food. We sit surrounded by their books and 
travel photos and, as there are just two other guests (both Barcelona 
residents), it feels like I've popped round to a friend's house for dinner.

I'm not sure how the evenings pan out in other countries but here the sobremesa
 (after-dinner conversation) at each event lasts for hours, and I wonder if I 
have just lucked out with particularly fine company. However, the early days of 
a peer-to-peer site are often the glory days, so if you're considering it, 
now's the time to try EatWith. It's no more of a gamble than any restaurant – 
and could be far more entertaining.
