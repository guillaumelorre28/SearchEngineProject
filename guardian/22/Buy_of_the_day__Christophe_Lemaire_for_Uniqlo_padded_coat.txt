We wouldn’t dare compare this jacket to the Stella McCartney feather-free 
wadded one, all burnt toffee in colour and mega in proportion, but they do form 
the crux of the whole anti-style, difficult-colour padded jacket thing that’s 
happening right now. They are just at different price points, and the Uniqlo 
one is a little more like a quilt. It’s from their new range designed under 
Christophe Lemaire, the former artistic director of womenswear at Hermès, who 
has taken over as artistic director at Uniqlo Paris’s R&D centre where his new 
collection – U – is about basics and simplicity, and looking like a Parisian 
for not much money. What a coup for Uniqlo and what a coat for us.
