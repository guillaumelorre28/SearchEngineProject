Developers of virtual reality games are pulling their support for Oculus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/oculus> after the involvement of its 
co-founder Palmer Luckey in a pro-Trump and anti-Clinton group was revealed.

Luckey, who works at Facebook after it bought the VR company, revealed himself 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-rift-vr-palmer-luckey-trump-shitposts>
 to be the secret financial backer behind the Nimble America group which is 
dedicated to turning the tide of the US election through “meme magic” and 
“shitposting” - creating images, gifs and other propaganda with pro-Trump 
captions.

Following Luckey’s admission, games developers large and small have publicly 
condemned the Oculus co-founder.

High profile developer Insomniac Games, whose games include the long running 
Ratchet and Clank series, Resistance and Spyro, and who is in the process of 
developing three games exclusively for the Oculus Rift, issued the statement: 
“InsomniacGames <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> condemns all 
forms of hate speech. While everyone has a right to express his or her 
political opinion, the behaviour and sentiments reported do not reflect the 
values of our company. We are also confident that this behaviour and sentiment 
does not reflect the values of the many Oculus employees we work with on a 
daily basis.”

Some developers were so appalled at Luckey’s actions that they pulled their 
support for Oculus, instead limiting their game releases to competitors 
including the Valve-backed HTC Vive and the Sony PlayStation VR.

Scruta Games <http://scruta.net/>, developer of Computer Janitor VR, 
Transporter Room 3 and Closer than Infinity said it would cancel Oculus support 
until Luckey stood down.

Until @PalmerLuckey <https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey> steps down from his 
position at@oculus <https://twitter.com/oculus>, we will be cancelling Oculus 
support for our games.

It’s not about “politics”, it’s about the face of a company financially 
backing racist trolls. He is free to vote for whoever he pleases.

Tomorrow Today Labs, developers of Newton VR, Subject 107 and an unannounced 
HTC Vive game said it would not support the Oculus Touch “as long as [Luckey] 
is employed there”.

Hey @oculus <https://twitter.com/oculus>, @PalmerLuckey 
<https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey>'s actions are unacceptable. NewtonVR will 
not be supporting the Oculus Touch as long as he is employed there.

Developer of Fez, Panoramical and Superhypercube, Polytron Corporation and 
Kokoromi said <http://pastebin.com/Vq71ELkn>: “In a political climate as 
fragile and horrifying as this one, we cannot tacitly endorse these actions by 
supporting Luckey or his platform. In light of this, we will not be pursuing 
Oculus support for our upcoming VR release, Superhypercube.”

Since Luckey’s admission, he has attempted to backtrack, saying 
<https://www.facebook.com/palmer.luckey/posts/10209141115659366>: “I am deeply 
sorry that my actions are negatively impacting the perception of Oculus and its 
partners. I am committed to the principles of fair play and equal treatment.”

Brendan Iribe, co-founder and chief executive of Oculus VR, said 
<https://www.facebook.com/brendaniribe/posts/10154545503818749?pnref=story>: 
“Everyone at Oculus is free to support the issues or causes that matter to 
them, whether or not we agree with those views. It is important to remember 
that Palmer acted independently in a personal capacity, and was in no way 
representing the company.”

However, the author Mark Sumner perhaps summed up the feeling of many best, 
tweeting that despite backing Oculus’s Kickstater campaign and developing 
non-gaming tools for the system, he would no longer support the platform.

Oculus is FAR from the only product on the VR market. And it can just gather 
dust from now on.
