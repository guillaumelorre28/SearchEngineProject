12.31pm: Reaction, and Oswald departs

Hearing what he initially thought to be a firecracker, secret service agent 
Clinton Hill sees the president recoil from the first shot. He runs from the 
follow-up car, but when he reaches the limousine the second shot hits the 
president, and the agent leaps aboard too late.

Patrolman Marrion Baker confronts Oswald in the depository cafeteria, but the 
building superintendent vouches for him. Oswald walks seven blocks, boards a 
city bus, and eventually gets into a cab at the bus depot.

1.15pm: Officer Tippit killed

Police officer JD Tippit pulls up to Oswald in his car, after having heard of 
a suspect matching his description. After briefly speaking through an open 
window, Tippit stepped out of his car and was shot three times in the chest and 
once in the temple. Twelve people witnessed a man fleeing the scene, and six 
later identified Oswald in police lineups.

1pm: Parkland hospital

Doctors are unable to save the president, who arrived ‘moribund’. One says:

rites and the first lady reportedly held her husband’s hand and placed one of 
her rings onto his finger.

1pm: Oswald's flight

Oswald walks back to his rooming house, changes his jacket there for one more 
lightly colored, and heads back into the street.

1.22pm: On the sixth floor

Police find a rifle behind a stack of books in the room from which the

Dallas police’s parafin tests confirm that Oswald recently fired a gun. 
Oswald’s wife later confirms that the rifle found in the depository belongs to 
her husband.

2.20pm: Air Force One

The hearse carrying the president arrives at Air Force One, with the first 
lady sitting next to the bronze coffin.

2.30pm: Questioning

Interrogated for almost 12 hours, Oswald denies throughout that he had 
anything to do with either murder. Confronted with photos of himself holding a 
rifle and pistol, Oswald "sneered, saying that they were fake photographs … 
[taken] by the police, that they had superimposed upon the photographs a rifle 
and revolver." He eventually stops answering all questions.

Kennedy makes funeral plans and Johnson speaks with advisers. Mrs Kennedy 
replies to Lady Bird Johnson’s suggestion to change out of her blood-stained 
dress by saying “Oh no, that’s all right. I want them to see what they have 
done to Jack.”
