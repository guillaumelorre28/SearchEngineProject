Hedi Slimane has announced he is leaving Saint Laurent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/saint-laurent> after four years as 
creative director.

According to WWD 
<http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/hedi-slimane-exit-saint-laurent-10401083/>
, his contract with the legendary fashion house expired yesterday.

Kering, the group that owns the fashion house, said in a statement that 
Slimane’s exit has ended a “four-year mission, which has led to a complete 
repositioning of the brand”. With his history of popularising the skinny jean, 
indie rock look at Dior Homme, Slimane brought this aesthetic to Saint Laurent, 
giving a contemporary edge to the label.

It is believed Slimane knew he was leaving the label and used his last two 
shows as farewells. The first goodbye, his lavish autumn/winter 20016 show in 
Los Angeles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2016/feb/11/justin-bieber-glitter-and-velvet-saint-laurent-makes-its-la-debut>
, was staged at the Hollywood Palladium and seemed to pay tribue to LA’s 
legendary music scene. It featured a frow that included Justin Bieber, Lady 
Gaga and featured a rare appearance by Slimane himself, who walked during the 
show dressed like a Romantic poet.

In stark contrast, his Paris fashion week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/08/saint-laurent-in-paris-the-return-of-the-80s-party-girl>
 show last month featured no music at all, but had a thematic music video 
aesthetic – a Roxy Music model muse. His final act was masterful: Cara 
Delevingne’s much acclaimed new adverts for the label, seen as a “return to 
modelling” after an acting hiatus.

Slimane’s successor is rumoured to be Anthony Vaccarello, said to be starting 
his new role on 1 May.
