Emma Stone is being lined up for her Broadway debut in a production of Cabaret 
<http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/emma-stone-in-talks-to-join-cabaret-cast>
, following negotiations announced by the Roundabout Theater Company in New 
York.

The actor has become known for confident, varied work in everything from 
action blockbusters (The Amazing Spider-Man) to broad comedy (Superbad) and 
heavyweight drama (The Help). She’ll next appear on screen in Magic in the 
Moonlight, a 1920s-set film from Woody Allen which is much anticipated 
following the success of his Blue Valentine.

In Cabaret, Stone will take the lead role of Sally Bowles, which is currently 
being played byMichelle Williams

potentially take on the role last year but scheduling difficulties meant she 
had to pass. The rest of the cast, including Alan Cumming as the MC, will 
remain the same.

Stone is expected to take over from Williams in early November, with the 
production running through until early January. It’s not the only 
Broadway-focused project she’s associated with – her forthcoming film Birdman, 
directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and co-starring Ed Norton, concerns a 
washed-up actor heading toBroadway <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/broadway> 
to bolster his reputation.
