The 100th Giro d’Italia will honour many of its past heroes and be a cultural 
and historic celebration of Italy, organisers said at the route announcement on 
Tuesday.

The 3,572-kilometre race over 21 days starts in Sardinia, for the third time, 
on 5 May next year with two further stages on the island. The first rest day is 
followed by two stages in Sicily before moving to mainland Italy.

The Giro finishes in Milan, for a 76th time, on 28 May. The concluding stage 
is a 28km time-trial from Monza racetrack which finishes in front of Milan 
Cathedral, meaning the recipient of the pink jersey could be determined at the 
final moment.

The last week is set to be a gruelling effort through the mountains and the 
total individual time-trial distance of 67.2km piqued the interest of Team 
Sky’s Chris Froome. Froomeposted a message on Twitter suggesting he was keen on 
the Giro <https://twitter.com/chrisfroome/status/790613671999397888>, but last 
week at the Tour de France route announcement insisted that his quest for a 
fourth yellow jersey was his overwhelming priority.

There are landmarks significant for riders past and present such as Fausto 
Coppi, Marco Pantani and Vincenzo Nibali which will be observed along the way. 
There are also six sprint stages.
