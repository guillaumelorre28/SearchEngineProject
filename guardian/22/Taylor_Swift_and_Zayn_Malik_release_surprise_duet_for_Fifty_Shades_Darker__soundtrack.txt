Taylor Swift and former One Direction member Zayn Malik have redeemed 2016 for 
their fans, releasing a surprise new song together for the soundtrack toFifty 
Shades Darker <https://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-darker>.

I Don’t Wanna Live Forever unexpectedly appeared in the US iTunes Store 
<https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/i-dont-wanna-live-forever/id1184694375> just 
before midnight Friday US eastern time. iTunes described it as “two of pop’s 
brightest stars [teaming up] for a passionate duet”.

The song, the first to be released from the soundtrack for the upcoming Fifty 
Shades Darker film, is a suitably smokey mid-tempo number that sees Malik and 
Swift swapping verses.

Malik takes the chorus in trademark falsetto: “I don’t want to live forever, 
‘cause I don’t want to be living in pain/I don’t want to fit wherever, I just 
want to keep calling your name/’Til you come back home.”

Swift shared news of the single with her 82.2 million Twitter followers, with 
only the obtuse comment: “Z | T | 50”.

It had been retweeted nearly 15,000 times in an hour.

While Malik was similarly restrained in his post 
<https://twitter.com/zaynmalik/status/807078575912480770>, the pair’s fanbase 
was anything but.

“Zayn and Taylor” and #idontwanttoliveforever were trending on Twitter as the 
two stars’ combined following of over 100 million fans reacted to the 
unforeseen collaboration with liberal application of caps lock.

Some connected the collaboration with Malik’s girlfriend, model Gigi Hadid – a 
high-profile member of Swift’s “squad”.

The song was #1 on the US iTunes chart within an hour of its release. “Well 
that escalated quickly,” commentedSwift on Instagram 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BNyQF9oBWf9/?taken-by=taylorswift>.

Malik posted a Polaroid of the pair

Swift’s cats.

Jack Antonoff, who collaborated with Swift on some tracks on her 
record-breaking 1989, tweeted that the song “came together very quickly”.

He wrote I Don’t Wanna Live Forever with Swift and Sam Dew, a hip-hop 
songwriter best known for the hook to the 2013 track by Wale, LoveHate Thing.

Antonoff recorded Swift and produced the track at his home. Malik sent his 
contribution from Los Angeles.

“We did it in a week basically. I’ve never had something come out that quick,” 
Antonoff said.

I Don’t Wanna Live Forever is available to buy from the US iTunes store for 
US$1.29. It is not known when it will be available in other territories.

It is the first new music Swift has released in 2016, though the star featured 
prominently in headlines due to herhigh-profile breakup with Calvin Harris

Despite an absence of new music, she was the highest-paid musician

 in 2016, earning $60m more than One Direction – the boy band Malik left last 
year.

In March, Malik released his debut album, Mind of Mine, to positive reviews 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/25/zayn-malik-mind-of-mine-review-assured-rebrand>
, and published hisautobiography at the age of 23
