Tom Hiddleston, star of High-Rise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/17/high-rise-review-tom-hiddleston-ben-wheatley-jb-ballard>
 andThe Night Manager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/the-night-manager-episode-by-episode>
, has apologised for his poorly received speech at the Golden Globe awards on 
Sunday.

Hiddleston had won the award for best actor in a miniseries or TV movie for 
the John le Carré adaptation The Night Manager and seemingly tried the 
audience’s patience with a convoluted tribute to the work ofMédecins Sans 
Frontières <https://www.theguardian.com/world/medecins-sans-frontieres> in 
South Sudan.

However, the reaction on social media was largely negative. It was suggested 
that Hiddleston’s reference to an encounter he had with doctors and nurses in 
South Sudan who had binge-watched The Night Manager was a classic example of 
the “humblebrag”. As a result,he posted an apology on Facebook on Monday 
<https://www.facebook.com/twhiddleston/posts/1300077066702742>, saying he was 
“very nervous” and his words “just came out wrong”.

The full text ran: “I just wanted to say … I completely agree that my speech 
at theGolden Globes <https://www.theguardian.com/film/golden-globes> last night 
was inelegantly expressed. In truth, I was very nervous, and my words just came 
out wrong. Sincerely, my only intention was to salute the incredible bravery 
and courage of the men and women who work so tirelessly for UNICEF UK, Doctors 
Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and World Food Programme, and 
the children of South Sudan, who continue to find hope and joy in the most 
difficult conditions. I apologise that my nerves got the better of me.”
