A’DAM Toren

The landmark tower, Toren Overhoeks, will reopen in early May as A’DAM Toren – 
Amsterdam Dance And Music. The former home of Shell, the 22-storey waterfront 
tower will have clubs, bars, cafes, a revolving restaurant, a 360-degree 
observation deck, offices and a 110-room hotel, Sir Adam, run by the people 
behind luxury boutique hotelSir Albert <http://www.siralberthotel.com/>, also 
in Amsterdam. The trio at the helm of A’DAM Toren – Sander Groet, Duncan 
Stutterheim and Hans Brouwer – are well known in the Dutch music and events 
scene and a host of companies in the creative industry have signed up for the 
office space. Expect a few quirks: a giant swing hanging from the top-floor 
observation deck, clubs on both the top and bottom floors, graffiti in the car 
park and the two-floor “Loft”, with seven-metre-high windows, a bar and DJ 
booth, which promises to be the hippest hotel suite in the city.

Named after the river IJ (which is pronounced “eye”), the EYE Film Museum 
changed the Amsterdam Noord waterfront when it opened in 2012, directly across 
the water from Centraal Station. Inside the iconic white building – almost a 
sculpture in itself, which looks different from every viewpoint – you’ll find a 
selection of film screenings and exhibitions. There are four cinemas, and as 
well as new releases, the archive has more than 37,000 titles. Browse in the 
shop for film-themed gifts (such as Francis Ford Coppola wine and Daniel Craig 
masks) and finish your visit with coffee or cocktails on the terrace while 
taking in the river views.

Arriving at the NDSM wharf by ferry, you’ll notice an abandoned submarine, the 
floatingBotel boat-hotel <http://www.amstelbotel.nl/>, an old lightship and 
some tall ships tied up. Walk around the old shipyard and you’ll find old trams 
(now lived in), a crane which is now the three-roomFaralda Hotel 
<http://faralda.com/>, shipping containers with a restaurant and others which 
are student accommodation. In the distance, the Kranspoor office building looks 
like a giant piece of Meccano. The desolate-seeming shipyard is actually 
bubbling with creativity – the area is home to MTV and Red Bull and inside one 
NDSM hangar you’ll find Kunststad (Art City), with studios for 200 artists and 
designers. As well as Pllek and IJ-Kantine restaurants (see below), the giant 
transparentNoorderlicht cafe <http://www.noorderlichtcafe.nl/> has outdoor DJs 
and live music in summer.

If it just looks like a stack of rusting shipping containers piled haphazardly 
at the edge of a shipyard, it’s because that’s exactly what Pllek is – from the 
front. Walk through a container and the space opens out into a large square 
room, with shipping container walls and a glass-front, set right on the river. 
Furniture is made from recycled materials and salvaged maritime objects and 
floors are bare concrete, but it’s the river views that really catch the eye. 
Visitors come over on the ferry for long weekend lunches; the cool kids arrive 
at night for the DJs, when the seating is cleared away. The outdoor seating and 
beach area fills up quickly in good weather and of course, there is yoga on a 
Sunday.

The latest incarnation of Clink hostels (founded in London by two Irish 
backpacking sisters), ClinkNoord is in an old Shell building, which still has 
an industrial vibe. As with much of Noord, creativity is the theme and there is 
studio and gallery space, a cafe, a nightclub, plus programmes for established 
visiting artists, bands and writers (paint, play or write and stay for free) 
which means guests are often treated to a free gig or exhibition. On the 
practical side, nice touches include free Wi-Fi throughout, power sockets and a 
locker for each bed, bike storage and en suite dorms.

A former factory that once made ships’ engines and kitchen equipment, this 
waterside industrial space on the river IJ is now home to the Stork fish and 
seafood restaurant. It’s not easy to make a 1,100-squre-metre hangar feel cosy 
but this has been achieved with just the right furnishings, lamps, plants, 
screens and boat sails suspended from the ceiling. However, it’s the seafood 
menu that’s the star: daily specials and fresh catches often include sea bream, 
sea bass and brill. There’s a platter with North Sea crab, snow crab, mussels, 
clams, smoked salmon and mackerel rillette, or try a serving of oysters or the 
North Sea sole.

Named after a 1960s song, Hotel de Goudfazant is a place to eat rather than 
rest your head as it doesn’t have guestrooms. While its neighbour Stork has 
managed to soften the industrial feel, at Goudfazant it makes the most of the 
stark, factory setting. Don’t be surprised to be seated on an old office chair, 
with a retro sports car parked near your table (the space was once a garage) 
and spot a bicycle rack (usually full) next to the wine cooler. The reasonably 
priced food is French in theme, with lots of seafood (oysters, crab, monkfish 
and salt cod are regulars) and don’t miss the cheeseboard to finish.

If you’re exploring Amsterdam Noord by bike, check out Nieuwendammerdijk, a 
beautiful, long and narrow street of historic wooden Dutch houses, some dating 
back to the 1500s. Number 202-204 is where the wealthy De Vries-Lentsh 
shipbuilding family lived – the house is caled De Halve Maen (the half moon) 
after the Dutch East India Company ship that took the first Dutch settlers to 
New York in 1609. Some of the houses have clock faces and crested facades, like 
numbers 301 to 309 which were captains’ houses in the 1700s. The neo-classic 
houses at numbers 300-308 were home to famous doctor Johan Georg Metzger in the 
1800s – he was given the land by princess Sophia of Sweden in gratitude for 
treatment.

The former workers canteen for Shell between 1941 and 2011 (when the company 
occupied the entire Overhoeks area), the Tolhuistuin (tollhouse garden) is now 
a thriving event and restaurant space – the first floor of the pavilion is home 
to the large cafe-restaurant THT (cards only, no cash) and the small park 
behind the building is a popular spot in summer. There’s also a gallery, 
concert hall, dance studios and regular events. Take the audio tour to learn 
more about the area – such as the gallows where prisoners were hanged in view 
of the river in the 1600s. You can either rent an audio device or download the 
tour via app.

Drop into this large bright brasserie on the river IJ, right on the NDSM 
waterfront, for breakfast, lunch, dinner or drinks on the riverside terrace. 
The huge space is dominated by massive windows to the front and back, giving it 
a transparent, bright feel, and colourful furniture contrasts with the large 
grey industrial pipes overhead. The lunch menu includes salad, soup, 
sandwiches, steak and sea bass, while the dinner menu might include duck with 
rocket stew, baked sole with salad or beetroot risotto. It’s also right beside 
the NDSM ferry so popping over just for lunch is do-able.
