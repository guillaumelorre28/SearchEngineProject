They are suspected to have been smuggled or illegally shipped in from China 
through Lagos port, a senior customs official in Nigeria’s commercial hub told 
AFP.

The 50kg bags, branded “Best Tomato Rice”, had no date of manufacture and were 
intercepted Monday in the Ikeja area of the sprawling city, the official said 
on condition of anonymity.

“We have done a preliminary analysis of the plastic rice. After boiling, it 
was sticky and only God knows what would have happened if people consumed it,” 
Ikeja area customs controller Mohammed Haruna was quoted as saying.

Nigeria has banned rice imports as it seeks to boost local production.

Haruna said the plastic rice was to be sold ahead of Christmas and New Year 
festivities, with the price for the popular Nigerian staple hitting the roof 
because of galloping inflation.

A 50kg bag now sells for around 20,000 naira (US$63), more than double the 
price in December last year.

Nigeria’s inflation stood at 18.5% in November, its 13th consecutive monthly 
rise, driven by higher food prices.

The customs service has sent the fake rice to the National Agency for Food and 
Drug Administration and Control for further analysis.
