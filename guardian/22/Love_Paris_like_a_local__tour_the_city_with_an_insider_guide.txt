Georges, a retired French gendarmerie general, is waiting outside the metro 
station in the Parisian district of Le Sentier, eager to show off the finer – 
and less refined – points of an area he knows “like his pocket”, as the local 
expression goes.

Le Sentier is a curious mix of shabby and chic that stretches from the grand 
boulevards of Napoleon III’s architect Baron Haussmann to the aristocratic 
Palais Royal, via the colourful and notorious Saint Denis district, with its 
prostitutes and rag trade sweatshops.

“How long have we got?” Georges asks. I assume that there is not much I don’t 
know about an area I’ve lived near for almost 15 years, and reply: “Long 
enough.” Three hours later, and Georges is still showing me places on my 
doorstep I never knew existed.

 Glorious food … Le Grand Véfour, cradle of French restaurant gastronomy.

Georges is part of Cariboo, a website that aims to be the Airbnb of tailored 
tours with private guides. The idea, developed by Bertrand Bazin, 23, a 
graduate of one of France’s elite business schools, along with three friends, 
could hardly be simpler: take a city dweller who is passionate about their home 
and introduce them to visitors looking for insider knowledge. Since it started 
last July, the company has not stopped growing, despite last November’s 
terrorist attacks. From a base of 30 Cariboos in Paris, the company now has 
around 500 people worldwide in 100 destinations, from France, Spain and the UK, 
to India, Brazil and Mexico.

Georges’ tour is an eclectic mix of historical detail, little-known facts, 
quirky places (like the button and ribbon shop with stock from the 19th 
century, in rue Choiseul) and souvenir buying opportunities.

His advice to visitors is simple: look up. He points out the characteristics 
of Haussmann’s famous boulevards: the long avenues of ashlar-stone buildings 
between five and seven stories high, each subtly different – the more spacious 
apartments with ornate wrought-iron balconies on the second floorétage noble, 
with flats becoming more modest with each floor, up to the rooftop garrets.

He knows where to find the little-known passages, the many statues and 
carvings influenced by Greek mythology, or those that reflect the proprietor’s 
trade or interests. Of the 150 or so covered passages that existed in Paris 
before Haussmann redesigned the city in the mid-19th century only 20 remain, 
among them the grandGalerie Vivienne <http://www.galerie-vivienne.com/> (named 
a gallery not a passage, due to its proximity to the aristocratic Palais Royal) 
and the Prado and Brady passages in the less well-to-do 10th arrondissement, 
which is rough around the edges but increasingly trendy. (Passage Brady is 
known for its curry houses.)

Georges points out Le Chabanais 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/26/le-chabanais-restaurant-review-jay-rayner>
, the famous former brothel frequented by Toulouse Lautrec, Guy de Maupassant 
and the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, whose private room bore the royal 
coat of arms and had a large copper bathtub (bought by Salvador Dalí in 1951 
when the place closed down) and a “love seat”. Le Chabanais was also popular 
with the occupying German forces during the second world war.

Where there were prostitutes and courtesans, there were princes and the 
monarch’s court. At the Palais Royal we gaze wistfully into the window of the
Grand Véfour <http://www.grand-vefour.com/en/> – the celebrated cradle of 
French restaurant gastronomy, opened in the mid-18th century – at the €315 menu 
plaisir and dining salle where French literary giants Colette and Jean Cocteau 
entertained the Parisian beau monde. It was in the Palais Royal gardens that 
Napoleon Bonaparte lost his virginity to a prostitute, Georges reliably informs 
me.

This is the sort of detail, Bazin says, that visitors love. “Today, people are 
looking for far more than museums, culture and restaurants from a city visit, 
but they may be too timid or not have the opportunity to meet local people. So 
we are doing the introductions. Our guides are passionate about their city and 
are not just doing this for money.”

So far, one-third of customers to the French site are foreign visitors, 
one-third are French nationals and the remaining third are locals wishing to 
rediscover their arrondissement.

“This is for people who really want to see the city through the eyes of a 
local person who knows it,” Bazin says.

Over lunch at a Mauritian restaurant that I didn’t know existed (although it 
is yards from my doorstep), Georges admits he speaks a little Russian and that 
at the height of the cold war, as a young man in the French intelligence 
service, he spent time in Moscow. I say it makes him sound like a French James 
Bond. He smiles enigmatically.
