&samhoud places street food

Steps from Centraal station, the original &samhoud places has two Michelin 
stars thanks to Heston Blumenthal-esque molecular maestro Moshik Roth. Now, a 
more affordable sister venue has opened below, with the Israeli chef still at 
the reins. High-quality plates to share ape global street snacks: the 
delectable Sam (€13) – chicken, oyster and kimchi in a lettuce wrap – is 
Korean-inspired, while the Tomeato (€9.50) is a US-style burger in which the 
yummy “mince” is actually, miraculously, tomato concentrate.

Holland’s first “food waste” restaurant, Instock serves a daily changing, 
three-course menu for €20, making inventive use of supermarket leftovers 
“rescued” that morning. Open until 2 November, it is the result of four retail 
industry workers’ dismay at society’s profligacy. “We wanted to show that lots 
of produce that shops throw away is perfectly fine,” says Freke van Nimwegen. 
With two full rooms – part of an old gas factory fringing the stately 
Westerpark – and a packed patio each night, they seem to be succeeding.

Pllek is reached by a ferry across the IJ (bay), which takes you to 
Amsterdam-Noord – the city’s upcoming area. This playground of abandoned 
shipyards is now filling with creative types, and its patron saint is Pllek, a 
bar-restaurant assembled from scratch two years ago. Inside are cushy sofas and 
a disco ball; outside there are reclaimed petrol containers, cushioned decking, 
picnic tables, ivy-lined scaffold pipes and a sandy terrace leading to the IJ, 
in which visitors can swim. Yoga classes are common, as are exhibitions. Amid 
all the fun, chef Dimitri Mulder serves organic food all day: the pan-fried 
mullet with samphire (€18.50) is especially nice and fresh.

If the north of Amsterdam is upcoming, the east has already arrived. Baut, a 
pop-up bar-restaurant occupying old newspaper offices, typifies the revived 
area. Michelle van der Vliet, founder of Amsterdam food blogStory 154 
<http://story154.com/>, has tactical advice: “Arrive early and head skyward: 
OpBaut, a grassy first-floor suntrap, has just opened. After cocktails, descend 
to a dining room of mis-matched furniture, fairy lights and international 
sharing plates (from €8.50), and splash out on the chef’s four-course surprise 
menu (€44.50) to get all the best dishes.” Do this soon, though: Baut will 
close after New Year’s Eve 2014.

Next door to Baut, in a former printing warehouse, Trouw is a temporary 
restaurant, club, record label and gallery all rolled into one. The 
Mediterranean food is reason enough to visit: generous, funky dishes emerging 
from an island kitchen into a long, low-roofed room of pot plants and 
industrial piping. Order the extensive vegetable tasting menu (€22.50) for 
maximum delight, and hope that the eggplant, feta and pomegranate salad is in 
season. Like its neighbour, Trouw shuts for good on 31 December 2014.

Canvas

Canvas occupies the seventh floor of more former periodical offices, opposite 
Trouw and Baut. In June, the edgy newVolkshotel <https://www.volkshotel.nl/> 
opened inside the building and Canvas, bolstered by a new chef, upped its 
restaurant game. Visitors can now chew on Kloosterbig piglets (€8.50) or 
sherry-cooked catfishes (€15.50) as Amsterdam’s trendiest party animals begin 
to glide by. Arrive early to nab a seat on the balcony, and the city’s most 
Instagrammable vistas.

BAK

Initially, BAK was a nomadic pop-up operation, materialising in various spots 
across the city to rave reviews. But last year, its three creators decided that 
their concept – Dutch-produced food, cooked to high standards at low prices – 
merited a permanent home. They chose a third-floor, loft-like spot in the Old 
Harbour, with attractive views of houseboats below. Daring and unusual, the 
menu changes weekly, and costs €34.50 for four full courses (dinner is four 
courses only, single dishes at lunch from €8).

All the best treasure requires a good old hunt. The gastrobar’s location –on 
snoozy Java Island in the eastern docklands – and its nondescript frontage 
aren’t initially promising but a local-secret gem awaits inside. The range of 
minimal, beautifully presented, ambitious and scrumptious small plates is 
headlined by sea bass with avocado aioli and, for dessert, a rose parfait 
bearing traces of limoncello (dishes from €9.50). You can sit either inside, 
watching boats drift by, or on the sunny rear patio.

Another temporary joint, Henk sits by the Prinsengracht canal, 10 minutes’ 
walk fromAnne Frank’s House <http://www.annefrank.org/en/Museum/>. It’s run by 
three beautiful, well-dressed sisters and serves a three-course menu made with 
seasonal veg and local meats for €33. Story 154’s Michelle is a fan: “The large 
terrace borders a busy bridge, making it the perfect place to sit and watch 
Amsterdam go by,” she says. You don’t have to leave after dinner, either: just 
head downstairs to Henk’s special G&T bar.”

Refreshed each week, Restaurant As’s menu is seasonal, locally sourced and 
intensely flavourful. Four courses for €52 might seem steep-ish but it’s 
actually a bargain: every item here is delicious, right down to the homemade
focaccia. The venue – a brutalist former chapel in well-to-do south Amsterdam – 
scores it extra points. If the sun’s out, ask to sit at one of the long tables 
in the garden, under the pergola and cherry trees.
