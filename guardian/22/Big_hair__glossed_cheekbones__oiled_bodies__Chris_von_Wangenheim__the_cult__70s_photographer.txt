To discuss 70s New York these days is to talk of an era wrapped up in a 
mythology of hedonistic glamour, soundtracked by Chic, dressed by Halston, 
peopled by the likes ofBianca Jagger, Andy Warhol and Grace Jones on the 
dancefloor of Studio 54

 and, more than likely, snapped by Chris von Wangenheim.

 The glamorous world of Von Wangenheim comes with the accessories of the 
super-rich – such as a helicopter, in shadow in this image, featuring Gia 
Carangi for Vogue in 1979. Photograph: Chris Von Wangenheim/Gloss book 
While the German-born Von Wangenheim is far from as well-known as his 
contemporaries Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin and David Bailey are now, his work 
contains all the glossed cheekbones, big hair and oiled bodies that the era is 
renowned for.

He captured the likes of Marie Helvin and Gia Carangi, both in moody black and 
white shots and amped-up colour, often naked. His less X-rated work appeared in 
the pages of Vogue and advertising for Valentino. Some of his images, such as 
those of a doberman chewing Lisa Taylor’s arm or Patti Hansen running from a 
burning car, have the requisite controversy to garner a buzz.

 With all the romance of a Robert Doisneau photograph, Von Wangenheim adds his 
element of subversion by making these dancers two men. Still a pretty big deal 
in the 70s. Photograph: Chris Von Wangenheim/Gloss book 
Von Wangenheim’s relative obscurity now may be explained by his untimely death 
in a car accident in 1981, at the age of 39, and the fact that his work hasn’t 
quite chimed with the zeitgeist since then. However, the fuzzy high-gloss 
Instagram-friendly aesthetic is exactly right for fashion at the moment, with 
the 70s on mood boards once again, and nightlife in focus. This is in contrast 
with the past five years when covered-up, practical minimalism made office 
hours the chicest time zone.

 Horses were the thing to have in 70s New York – as Bianca Jagger famously 
demonstrated. In this 1975 image, Von Wangenheim adds two models in underwear,

Jacobs, always a fan of rediscovering a cult New York reference and a Studio 
54 regular as a teen, has taken Von Wangenheim’s aesthetic to heart with a 
much-discussed,completely over the top dress code 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2015/aug/26/marc-jacobs-party-dress-code-new-york-fashion-week-studio-54>
. Von Wangenheim would no doubt approve. Nearly 35 years after his death, the 
kind of glossy glamour that comes with a grrrrr is back in fashion.

Correction: An earlier version of this article said that the model in the 
photograph (and also mentioned in the piece) who has a dog’s jaw round her arm 
was Christie Brinkley. It is Lisa Taylor
