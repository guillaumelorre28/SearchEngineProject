.

The much-anticipated film marks the return of director Kenneth Lonergan, whose 
sparse but highly acclaimed directorial record comprises 2000’s You Can Count 
on Me and2011’s Margaret 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/01/margaret-film-review>, which was 
glowingly reviewed, but sunk by delays and lawsuits. Manchester-by-the-Sea 
features Casey Affleck as a handyman mired in depression who becomes his 
nephew’s guardian. Michelle Williams also stars.

Manchester-by-the-Sea has attracted mixed reviews, with the Hollywood Reporter 
calling it 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/manchester-by-sea-sundance-review-858707>
 “a wrenching family tragedy ... dramatised with the depth of a high-quality 
American stage piece”, whilethe Guardian described it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/manchester-by-the-sea-review-kenneth-lonergans-morose-echo-of-margaret>
 as “a study of family dysfunction ... held back by the fact it’s all filtered 
through Affleck’s withdrawn lead”.

This represents the first major deal of Sundance 2016, although a statement of 
intent from Amazon’s rival Netflix was posted before the festival began whenit 
bought road comedy The Fundamentals of Caring 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-paul-rudds-fundamentals-caring-856188>
, starring Paul Rudd, for just under $7m.
