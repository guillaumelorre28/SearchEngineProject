Bicycle hire in Dalyan is great value at around 10TL (£2.50) for the day. But 
where should visitors go? Thefamous Iztuzu beach

 is only nine miles away but with a monster hill to climb in 35C. And visiting 
the Lycian ruins at Kaunos means hauling your bike onto a small rowing boat to 
cross the Dalyan river: not much fun.

The tiny Yaliçapkini (Kingfisher) restaurant, two miles from the tequila bars 
and fake football-shirt shops of downtown Dalyan, and set among giant reeds, is 
the answer. Follow the “scenic route” and the sound of traffic and voices 
recedes as you enter pomegranate and lemon orchards dotted with beehives. After 
15 minutes’ cycling the orchards give way to marsh and reedbeds. The only 
sounds are the breeze in the reeds and alarmed terrapins flopping into the 
water as you pass. Storks, kingfishers, herons are abundant, as are turtles, 
water snakes (I saw three), wild flowers and butterflies.

The family-run thatched restaurant is at one with the landscape and offers a 
friendly welcome to overheated cyclists. The menu is simple but delightful: 
local sea bream (£6), calamari, prawns and crab (just £3) with salads in a 
pomegranate/olive oil dressing alongside superb meze. Take in the natural bliss 
around you then slowly pedal back to Dalyan, with a slightly smug smile on your 
face.
