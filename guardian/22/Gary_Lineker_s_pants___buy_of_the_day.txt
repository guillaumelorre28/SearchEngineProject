Gary Lineker stayed good to his word and, in a studio filled with reverie and 
innuendo, presented the first segment oflast weekend’s Match of the Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/gary-lineker-says-pledge-to-appear-in-his-pants-depends-if-the-studio-is-cosy>
,as he promised he would if Leicester City won the Premier League title in 2015 
<https://twitter.com/garylineker/status/676520648097865728?lang=en-gb> in his 
underwear.

 But were they pants? Or shorts, possibly? No one was certain. The reaction on 
Twitter started out confused, then snowballed into browbeating, surprise and 
fury as some argued that he was not in his underwear at all.

The storm was, in fact moot because Lineker was wearing boxers. A pair of 
rather crisp pair boxers bySunspel <http://www.sunspel.com/uk/>, the company 
that first introduced the underwear to the UK after the second world war. 
Sunspel boxers also appeared in the Levi’slaunderette 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q56M5OZS1A8> advert in the mid-80s, and were 
recently seen on Daniel Craig in Casino Royale. Lineker’s pair cost £30 and 
were embroidered with a Leicester City badge by Hand and Lock, a British 
company that specialises in military regalia.

The pants were British, laden with history, well-fitted and white. His styling 
was simple and unerring. Lineker kept his promise while providing a great, 
shareable image.

As for which hat Paddy Ashdown will eat 
<http://www.nytimes.com/live/uk-elections-2015/former-liberal-democrat-leader-promises-to-eat-his-hat-on-live-tv-if-exit-poll-is-right/>
, all bets are still off.
