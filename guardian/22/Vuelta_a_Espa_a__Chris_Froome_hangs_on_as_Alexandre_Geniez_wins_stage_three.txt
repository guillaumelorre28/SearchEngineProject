Alexandre Geniez won stage three of the Vuelta a España 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/vuelta-a-espana> as Team Sky handed over the 
race leader’s red jersey to the Spaniard Rubén Fernández of Movistar.

The Frenchman Geniez, racing for FDJ, took victory atop the brutal Mirador de 
Ézaro as the sole survivor of the day’s breakaway while the general 
classification battle began in earnest behind.

Sky had held the red jersey after each of the opening two stages, first 
through Peter Kennaugh andthen Michal Kwiatkowski

, but Fernández’s second place, 21 seconds behind Geniez, was enough for him to 
take red in his debut Vuelta.

Chris Froome looked to have been dropped on the final climb – only 1.8km long 
but at brutal gradients, averaging 13.8% – but theTour de France winner

 gradually worked his way back, finishing fourth behind Movistar’s Alejandro 
Valverde and ahead of Orica-BikeExchange’s Esteban Chaves, all 5sec behind 
Fernández.

That means Fernández now leads overall by seven seconds from Valverde, with 
Froome third, 11sec down. Chaves is fourth, 17sec down alongside Movistar’s 
Nairo Quintana in fifth. Kennaugh, the leader after the opening stage, is 
seventh, 47 seconds off the pace.

This challenging 176.4km stage from Marin to Dumbría put several early 
challenges in the riders’ path and took its toll as Giant-Alpecin’s Warren 
Barguil abandoned while Astana’s Miguel Ángel López lost several minutes in a 
crash.

There were also big losers on the final climb as Tinkoff’s Alberto Contador 
finished 54 seconds down and Lotto-NL Jumbo’s Steven Kruijswijk rolled home 
more than two minutes after Geniez.
