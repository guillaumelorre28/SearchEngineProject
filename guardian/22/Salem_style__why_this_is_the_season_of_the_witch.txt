 The US cover of Emma Cline’s The Girls. 
Could we be that we’re in the season of the witch without knowing about it? 
The Autumn Winter shows referenced The Crucible and the trials in Salem, with 
catwalks featuring capes (Prada, Giorgio Armani), neck collars (Osman), floaty 
Massachusetts channelling gowns (JW Anderson, Alexander McQueen) and bonnets 
(Maison Margiela and Christopher Kane). Meanwhile, the choker proving to be the 
go-to goth accessory of choice, amongst the Insta It Girls (Gigi Hadid,Kendall 
Jenner <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kendall-jenner>, Zoe Kravitz) and 
on the high street.


Culture is riffing on alt.#squad vibes too. Emma Cline’s novel The Girls (a 
story inspired by the Charles Manson murders with a collegiate female “family” 
at its heart) is one of the most talked-about books of the year. Films such as 
the Harry Potter prequelFantastic Beasts,

 and a new season ofScream Queens <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFULttiHuSU> 
all deal with malevolent femininity.


The mass hysteria at the centre of Arthur Miller’s play (which was an allegory 
for McCarthyism) feels apt for 2016, with its endlesspolitical

 ruptures. Theresa May has been painted aswitch-like

Hillary Clinton with the Salem narrative. She said that Clinton had been 
“forged in The Crucible of all these battles and all this coverage she has 
hated, and she thinks turned her into this caricature”.


The idea of “caricature” is what the witchy aesthetic is about, distilling 
femaleness down into opposites. It’s a high-fashion update of goth, with its 
incorporation of Victorian fashion and the tension between bold, dark colours, 
delicate fabrication, malevolence and timidity. Standing in opposition to the 
unfussy silhouettes of athleisure, it retains a certain otherworldly mystique 
and is all the more interesting for it.
