On the cover: Cara Delevingne, who has featured on three out of the past four 
British Vogue September issues. Cara is “shawling” – wearing off-the-shoulder – 
a Balenciaga anorak (£1,615).

Weight: 1.22kg.

Your autumn-winter look: Tweed meets velvet meets military. Think “Victoriana 
space princess who’s a little into S&M”. Bear in mind that “heavy officer coats 
styled over silky negligees, gold lamé dresses and belted waists salute a 
wartime sweetheart from days gone by”.

Key styling tip: Wear a waterproof grandly off the shoulder. (See: Cara on the 
cover.) “Head to the waterproof and windproof section of Millets ...

How you wear it: unzipped to the sternum, falling off your shoulders.”

Tracksuit-trouser count: Adidas Originals £45 side-stripe tracksuit bottoms 
appear no fewer than five times. Vetements’ £580 version, once.

Celebrity quote: Cara Delevingne: “Having been with both men and women,I know 
that women are amazing and complicated and confusing and you never know where 
you stand and it constantly keeps you on your toes. Men are easier to figure 
out.”

Soundbite: “Chickpea meringue might look brown but it tastes just as good as 
the real thing.”

Cheap trick: For the Christopher Kane catwalk look, you can buy a three-pack 
of clear rain bonnets for £6 from Amazon.

Scene-stealer: Get Off My Dick T-shirt, sadly uncredited.

What to eat for breakfast: The OMG Syringe Shot mini-boost of flaxseed oil, 
cannabis oil and grapefruit, from vegan restaurant Farmacy, £5.

mid-Eighties teenager, represented by me).”

 Porter, with Edita Vilkeviciute. 
On the cover: Model Edita Vilkeviciute in Prada coat, shawled with a kitten 
clutched to her breast.

Weight: 85g.

Your autumn-winter look: Super-luxe decadent aristo-groupie bohemianFor 
instance, velvet boots: “Nothing says exuberance like footwear in a fabric long 
association with nobility and after-dark glamour”.

Key styling tip: Make like cover star Edita and wear all your clothes – from a 
Burberry coat to a Dior dress – unbuttoned to reveal a shoulder. “The oversized 
overcoat will be your go-to piece this fall thanks to its 1980s proportions.”

Tracksuit-trouser count: Barely in evidence. Instead, designer Haider 
Ackermann sings the praises of tight trousers and high heels. “Standing 
straight – there is a real strength to that.”

Celebrity quote: Winona Ryder on films: “Movies are all big franchise 
superhero things. And I’m 44 – I don’t think anyone wants to put a cape on me 
and chuck me out of the window!I don’t know how good my bone density is.”

Soundbite: “When I practise my ballet steps, I motivate myself by always 
looking up, as if to the second balcony, where I imagine Nureyev to be sitting.”

Cheap trick: Take a tip from the Bruce Weber shoot and use kids’ plastic toy 
cars, the kind that live in backyards, as props. Much cheaper than sports cars.

Scene-stealer: A dead heat between the cover kitten and a rug, made from the 
skin of Marchesa Luisa Casati’s pet cheetah, which features prominently in a 
shoot featuring her descendants.

What to eat for breakfast: Take a tip from Amanda Lear, who recalls summers 
with her soulmate Salvador Dalí in the 70s: “Breakfast would be served to me in 
bed by the maid, Rosa (who was always dressed in pink), with a hand-written 
note from Dali saying what the plan for the day was, and a little gift [such 
as] a sprig of jasmine or a scarab beetle.”

bear hug with a side of spank – painful!”

catwalk.

the CGM interview (and is trailed on the cover).
