At 82, sole owner of the megabrand that bears his name and with personal 
wealth estimated around £5bn, Giorgio Armani is still celebrating his own 
creation myth.

The collection shown at his Milan headquarters on Friday will be on sale next 
summer, and many of Armani’s global customers live in regions where summer is 
very hot indeed.

But with the exception of a few diaphanous dresses, the focus remained on the 
unstructured tailoring on which Armani made his fortune. As a concession to the 
season, trousers were swapped for slim bermuda shorts or neat, sarong-wrapped 
skirts finishing just above the knee.

Navy jackets were swapped for – well, navy jackets, but in sheer fabrics, 
edged with sequins to catch the sun. The few pieces of menswear dotted through 
the show stayed true to the timeless aesthetic of the Italian man at leisure: 
simple shirts in expensive fabrics, trousers hemmed with soft precision exactly 
at the ankle bone, sockless slip on shoes.

opportunity to reinforce his position as a name synonymous withMilan fashion

Armani is staging a photographic exhibition, Emotions of the Athletic Body, 
which features portraits of David Beckham, Rafael Nadal and other sportsmen and 
women who have appeared in Armani campaigns.

On 26 September, he will host a show by the Chinese label Ricostru at his 
imposing purpose-built catwalk theatre, as part of his initiative to support 
emerging designers. “The future of the system depends on new generations, and I 
am happy to be able to contribute,” Armani told Womenswear Daily when he 
launched the scheme in 2014.
