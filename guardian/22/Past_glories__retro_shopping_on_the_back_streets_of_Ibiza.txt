With its wide seafront promenade, pretty marina, and many galleries, boutiques 
and authentic restaurants, Santa Eulalia, Ibiza’s third-largest resort, is less 
raucous than some of the party island’s other holiday hotspots. And on a quiet 
back street behind the main tourist hub, there’s an unexpected shopping find 
too:Vintage Icons and Echoes 
<https://www.facebook.com/Vintage-Icons-Echoes-1597631300477270/>, which is 
crammed with retro artefacts and designer gear.

Every inch of the 1,000 sq ft space is stuffed with bargains, from corsets to 
genuine ringmaster’s coats, 1950s cocktail dresses to 1920s nightgowns. You 
might find a Vivienne Westwood number or end-of-the-line Prada shoes at a 
fraction of the original price. There are wigs, hats, jewellery, magazines and 
kitsch ornaments. The decor’s a little bit bonkers, with Action Man toys flying 
from the ceiling and a yeti made from seven goatskins.

British owner Elaine Walsh used to run the five-storey Afflecks Palace market 
in Manchester, until issues with the lease forced her to give it up – so she 
moved lock, stock and barrel to Ibiza last year.

“It’s just a fun shop. It’s not meant to be serious, and I wanted it to be 
affordable,” says Elaine. So far, so good – it’s been a hit with locals and 
curious tourists, who often come across it by chance. “People find it amusing 
and there’s always something new. I’m constantly introducing and removing 
pieces – it’s a bit like gardening!”

After browsing for a while, head to tree-lined Calle San Jaime to celebrate 
your purchases with a sangría in the sunshine outside one of the many bars. My 
kind of shopping.
