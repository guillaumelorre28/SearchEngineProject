London Collections Men, the capital’s men’s fashion week, played out this 
weekend against a very British backdrop: the Queen’s birthday celebrations and 
the first England match of Euro 2016. Among the editors in the front row, 
however, sartorial patriotism was noticeably absent. Instead, Vêtements – the 
Parisian streetwear label notorious for putting a T-shirt with the DHL logo on 
the catwalk – was the buzz brand.

Founded by Georgian-born designer Demna Gvasalia as a collective in 2014, 
Vêtements has become the last word in cool by doing away with hackneyed 
concepts of Parisian chic. Borrowing from street culture, branding and the 
deconstruction pioneered by designers in the 1990s, it regularly puts on shows 
in distinctly inelegant venues – including a Chinese restaurant – with friends 
of the designers as models. Some pieces are deliberately unisex and the hoodies 
– oversized and often with the kinds of visual gags that play well on social 
media – are theit item in London for this week.

Editors, bloggers and designers wore them, and one participant was spotted 
wearing a fleece actually from logistics company DHL. Sweatshirts with gothic 
script on the sleeves were popular, and Luke Day, editor ofGQ Style, wore a 
design with the logo of sportswear brand Champion reworked to say Vêtements. He 
says there’s an insider exclusivity that those in the know – and on the front 
row – will understand, even if passersby see just another hoodie with a logo.

“The branded items have a very ironic pop-culture feel but are expensive,” 
said Day. ‘That makes them exclusive and covetable. They’re clothes for 
Instagram.”

Even when the labels didn’t say Vêtements, the influence was there. Where once 
the suits and pocket squares of traditional British tailoring dominated, now 
the mood was streety casual, with hoodies, trainers and tracksuit trousers by 
labels including Stüssy and Palace.

“There’s a perception that Vêtements is more real,” said Rob Nowill of fashion 
website style.com. “Men are tired of suits: they don’t feel modern. There’s not 
such a line between streetwear and fashion now.”

Nick Grimshaw, the radio DJ and London Collections ambassador, wore a hoodie 
for House of Holland’s presentation on Friday, and even model Oliver Cheshire – 
known for his suited and booted style – had a sporty look. He wore a cream 
knitted hooded top yesterday.

“Fashion has become more functional. I feel like I can wear something like 
this to a show now,” he said. “It’s also there in the City. Friends of mine who 
used to wear suits to work are now about to wear more relaxed clothes.”

London menswear designers could be credited with starting the trend Gvasalia 
and Vêtements have crystallised. British design duo Agi & Sam featured bomber 
jackets in their collection, while models at Nasir Mazhar showed tracksuits and 
cargo pants as part of a street-style-influenced look. Christopher Raeburn’s 
collaboration with German accessories brand MCM had an outdoorsy influence, 
with hooded ponchos and macs in dazzle print.

The men’s shows continue, with JW Anderson and Grace Wales Bonner highlights 
on the schedule.
