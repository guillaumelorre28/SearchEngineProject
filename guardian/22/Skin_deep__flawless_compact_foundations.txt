If we agree that foundation is getting better and better, the worry is that in 
10 years’ time everybody will look completely flawless and there will be no 
record on our faces of any of the scars and spots of lives well lived. It’s a 
real concern, especially as cushion compact foundation goes mainstream. Think 
BB cream that you pad on with a little sponge – very light, very easy to apply, 
very transportable, and very, very good.
