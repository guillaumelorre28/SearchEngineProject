Movistar’s Quintana and Tinkoff’s Alberto Contador were among a large group 
who broke away from the peloton early in the 118.5km stage, from Sabiñanigo to 
a summit finish on the Aramón Formigal in Sallent de Gállego.

Each had two team-mates in the breakaway while Froome was left to lead the 
chasing pack with little support from his Team Sky colleagues, aside from David 
López. The leading group pulled two minutes clear climbing the Alto de Petralba 
and kept pushing, Team Dimension Data’s Omar Fraile taking the three climbing 
points on offer there and five more on the Alto de Cotefablo.

Contador took two intermediate sprint points but it was Quintana who surged 
away along with Brambilla with 1.5km to go. Brambilla won the stage by three 
seconds but Quintana, crucially, finished 2min 37sec ahead of Froome to take 
his overall lead over the second-placed Briton to 3:37. Esteban Chaves (Orica 
Bike-Exchange) lies third, a further 20 seconds back, with Contador fourth and 
Chaves’ British team-mate Simon Yates fifth.
