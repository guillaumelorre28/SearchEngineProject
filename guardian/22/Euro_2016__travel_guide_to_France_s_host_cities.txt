Paris/Saint-Denis

Ireland v Sweden, 13 June
Northern Ireland v Germany, 21 June 

At a glance Paris is a lot more than its endless list of must-see sights. This 
is still a city of neighbourhoods, almost villages, and to get a real feel for 
local life explore just one –Pigalle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/28/paris-city-guide-day-in-south-pigalle>
 or Montmartre, Bastille or theMarais 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/mar/11/paris-marais-shopping> – and 
discover street markets, corner bistros and the Parisians themselves, who are a 
lot friendlier these days than the old, grumpy cliche.

Eat Le Bouillon Chartier <http://www.bouillon-chartier.com/en/> (9th 
arrondissement) has been open since 1896, serving seven days a week from 
11.30am till midnight. Expect a long queue outside the belle époque Chartier, 
as they don’t take reservations and prices are unbeatable. Don’t expect gourmet 
cooking but classic French comfort cuisine – confit de canard, choucroute – 
with mains from €8.50.Les Racines 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Les-Racines/152166088151358> (6th arr) is an 
unassuming Latin Quarter bistro, where genial chef Jean-François Debert cooks 
splendid heritage dishes that are fast disappearing elsewhere – juicy 
Montbéliard sausages with lentils, succulent kidneys smothered with Dijon 
mustard, and brandade de morue, a creamy cod and potato gratin (plat du jour 
€14). Le Berbère (62 rue Crozatier, 12th arr), by the buzzing Aligre market, is 
perfect to try out a North African couscous (from €12) or tagine. Guests are 
welcomed as if they were family. In Saint-Denis,L’Emaillerie 
<http://www.lemaillerie.com/> is a bustling neighbourhood brasserie that caters 
for groups of fans going to the Stade de France. Dishes range from simple 
entrecôte steak and frites to modern French cuisine such as burger of tuna and 
foie gras with apple compote.

Drink At Bar du Marché 
<https://www.facebook.com/Bar-du-March%C3%A9-137703866292348/> (11th arr), two 
minutes from the Bastille, Hakim, the lively barman at this new venue, serves 
craft beers and organic wines, while chef Xavier cooks up delicious Basque 
tapas. The mythical Left Bank barLe Piano Vache <http://www.lepianovache.fr/#!/>
 (5th arr) is always packed with students, its walls plastered with thousands 
of yellowing posters. Expect rock’n’roll music and cheap drinks. An ancient, 
19th-century cabaret,Aux Folies Belleville 
<http://www.aux-folies-belleville.fr/> (20th arr) is the perfect chill-out bar 
in the heart of Belleville’s seething Chinatown. Funky retro decor and wine at 
€3 a glass.

If you see one thing Avoid long queues outside mega-museums like the Louvre 
and discover one of the city’s many small museums. Hidden away in the 
backstreets of Pigalle is theMusée Gustave Moreau <http://musee-moreau.fr/>, a 
sumptuous mansion and studio displaying hundreds of striking paintings by this 
Symbolist master. If heading to the the Stade du France, the must-see in 
Saint-Denis is thebasilica cathedral Saint-Denis 
<http://uk.tourisme93.com/basilica/>, a stone’s throw from the fanzone – it’s a 
gothic masterpiece 
<http://uk.tourisme93.com/basilica/high-gothic-architecture.html> and 
necropolis of the kings and queens of France 
<http://uk.tourisme93.com/basilica/map-of-the-tombs-saint-denis-basilica.html>.

 Marseille’s Fort St Jean and (on the left) the new Museum of Mediterranean 
Culture 
At a glance Since Marseille’s reign as European Capital of Culture in 2013, it 
has been shedding its rough-diamond image. Trendy bars and boutiques have 
sprung up all over the city, and the redesigned quayside has brought some 
spectacular architecture to France’s oldest city.


Eat Waiters dressed as sailors serve delicious bouillabaisse, the city’s 
famous fish stew, atChez Michel <http://www.restaurant-michel-13.fr/>, Zinedine 
Zidane’s favourite old haunt. Try the sauteed baby squid atLa Boite-à-Sardine 
<http://www.laboiteasardine.com/>, a quirky fishmonger-restaurant with walls 
covered in gleaming sardine tins and buoys dangling from the ceiling. 
Otherwise, the most spectacular seafood platters (and pizzas) are at the 
slightly scruffyChez Jeannot <http://www.pizzeriachezjeannot.com/> in the 
colourful Vallon des Auffes cove. Next door isViaghji di Fonfon 
<http://www.viaghjidifonfon.com/fr-FR/home>, a tapas and snack bar which is 
great for a sunset drink.

 La Ruche 
Drink Sophisticated beer cellar Fietje <http://www.fietje.fr/> has opened 
Fietje2 in the trendy Saint-Victor district, complete with neon-lit benches on 
the terrace and hundreds of beers to try. On the same street isLa Ruche 
<http://www.laruche-marseille.fr/>, a buzzing cocktail and wine bar near the 
port, open until 2am.

If you see one thing Make it the Château d’If <http://www.chateau-if.fr/en/>, 
Marseille’s 16th-century prison island and the dramatic escape setting for 
Alexandre Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo.

 Bordeaux’s recently opened Cité du Vin – AKA the Guggenheim of wine. 
Photograph: Ugo Amez/Sipa/Rex 
At a glance The recently opened Cité du Vin <http://www.laciteduvin.com/en> – 
AKA the Guggenheim of wine – is the latest €81 million jewel in Bordeaux mayor 
Alain Juppé’s 20-year masterplan to reinvent the south-western city that once 
came with a fusty reputation. In the past 20 years, handsome lime-stoned 
buildings have been polished and restored, the riverfront has been turned into 
an esplanade, the pedestrianised city centre is buzzing with cafes, and a sleek 
tram system sweeps residents and visitors – whose numbers have leapt from 2 to 
6 million in the past five years – across 40km of the city and its suburbs.


Eat Belle Campagne <http://www.belle-campagne.fr/> is a two-storey cantine and 
upstairs restaurant in the buzzy St Pierre district of the old town. It has a 
vintage vibe – hardwood floors, exposed brick, zinc bar – and specialises in 
local seasonal produce, such asporc noir Gascon. There’s finger food at the bar 
(frites fried in duck fat with aïoli, €4.50) and a full menu upstairs (blonde 
Aquitaine beef steaks from €7 per 100g). For fish cooked simply and superbly, 
there’sLe Petit Commerce 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/LE-PETIT-COMMERCE/151929008218963>, also in St 
Pierre, which has an exhaustive choice of seafood on its daily blackboard. In
Marché du Capucins <http://marchedescapucins.com/>, you can slake your thirst 
and slurp down oysters at any number of stalls while enjoying the theatre of 
the day’s commerce.

 Belle Campagne, a cantine in the old town 
Drink Le Point Rouge <http://pointrouge-bdx.com/> wine bar and cocktail lounge 
opened in December in a formerly disused chateau in the developing Quai de 
Bacalan district not far from Gare St Jean. The discreet sign and bell at the 
entrance hint at a speakeasy, but inside it is a cavernous warehouse with stone 
arches, vaulted ceilings and concrete floors. The USP is the staggering choice 
on the wine menu: 1,200 by the bottle and 40 by the glass, as well as more than 
100 cocktails.

If you see one thing It would be rude not to visit the Cité du Vin, after all 
the time and money spent to position Bordeaux as the world capital of wine. But 
not far away in the redeveloped Bassin à Flots dockland area is the astonishing
La Base Sous-Marine 
<https://www.facebook.com/Base-sous-marine-de-Bordeaux-210002272397844/>, a 
brutish building that was a former U-boat bunker that now serves as an 
exhibition space for photography, festivals and performing art events.

south. It is also home to France’snational sports museum 
<http://www.museedusport.fr/>.

Eat The narrow streets of the old town are the best place to find the local 
specialitiessocca (chickpea pancake) and pissaladière (sweet onion and olive 
tart). For a seafront salade niçoise, eat atDi Più <http://www.dipiu.fr/> on

Jacobs/Alamy 
At a glance This former coalmining town <http://www.tourism-lenslievin.co.uk/>
, a short drive south-east of Calais, is widely believed to have the strongest 
footballing culture in France, so expect a good atmosphere at the 38,000-seater 
Stade Bollaert-Delelis.

Eat Tuck in to the local Flemish cuisine in one of the area’s taverns, or 
estaminets. A local favourite is Le Pain de la Bouche 
<http://lepaindelabouche.fr/index_uk.html>, which serves hearty meat and potato 
dishes. The restaurant at theLensotel 
<http://www.lensotel.com/restaurant-bar-lens.php> shouldn’t be missed. There 
are a number of sophisticated dishes, such as foie gras and lobster with 
saffron sauce, on the reasonably priced menu (three courses from €20.50).

Drink This is beer country, so settle down in the traditional pub just a few 
minutes’ drive from the centre at theAl’ Fosse 7 <http://www.alfosse7.fr/>. 
Closer to the action, theCubana Bar <http://cubanabar.fr/en/> serves a good 
selection of beers.


If you see one thing Lens boasts the architectural wonder that is the 
Louvre-Lens <http://www.louvre.fr/en/louvre-lens-0>, the outpost of the famous 
Paris museum. It has an excellent selection of works on loan from the parent 
gallery, and the on-siteAtelier de Marc Meurin 
<http://www.atelierdemarcmeurin.fr/> restaurant serves Michelin-star cuisine 
(menus from €32).

In its headlong, seemingly unstoppable rush to modernise, notably via the 
economic and architectural regeneration of La Confluence, at the southern end 
of its Presqu’ile district, Lyon remains a city dedicated to the French art of 
good living, be that in food or nightlife.

Drink In summer, Lyon’s youth gathers along the Rhone to drink on the numerous 
barges that line its banks.Star Ferry beer garden 
<https://www.facebook.com/TheStarferry> is the most sought-after spot, with its 
tasty burgers and beers from all over the world. Another favourite destination 
is the fashionable slopes of the Croix-Rousse neighbourhood, jammed with bars 
and music venues. The most recent is La Grooverie 
<https://www.facebook.com/lagrooverie/>, dedicated to black music in both its 
acts and its retro, soulful decor. But the socially and ethnically mixed La 
Guillotiere district is the city’s nightlife hub.Livestation DIY 
<http://livestationdiy.com/> is a gay- and electronic-friendly bar, whose 
Berlin vibe and themed nights would not be out of place in a sitcom.

 A typical Lyonnais bouchon restaurant in old Lyon. Photograph: Alicia Canter 
for the Guardian 
Eat For several years now the only way to eat for Lyon foodies has been 
bistronomie – high-end cuisine served in informal surroundings at affordable 
prices. Japanese chef Katsumi Ishida is the pioneer and undisputed master in 
this field. His restaurantEn mets fais ce qu’il te plaît  
<https://www.facebook.com/EnMetsFaisCeQuilTePlait/> (a pretty untranslatable 
pun) opened in 1999. Traditional Lyonnais food – the kind served in the city’s
bouchons –is kept alive in institutions such as Café Comptoir Abel 
<http://cafecomptoirabel.com/> in the middle-class Ainay district, serving 
quenelles, andouillette sausages and other specialities under 300-year-old 
beams. In the old town, thecafe on the top floor of the Gadagne museum 
<http://www.gadagne.musees.lyon.fr/index.php/building_en/Building/Cafe-Gadagne> 
(which until 4 September has an enthralling exhibition about the sociology of 
football) has a pretty, peaceful garden ideal for brunch.

If you see one thing Unless its status as a landmark has been usurped by the 
Musée des Confluences, the Fourvière hill is still emblematic of the city. Its 
19th-century basilica is Lyon’s answer to Paris’s Sacré-Coeur, complete with 
view. And the Roman amphitheatre at little way down the hill is well-enough 
preserved to host one of the region’s most important music festivals, theNuits 
de Fourvière <http://www.nuitsdefourviere.com/>: headlining this year are 
Radiohead, PJ Harvey, Tame Impala and the Pixies.

 Victor Hugo Market 
At a glance “La Ville Rose” is the heart of south-west France’s rugby country, 
but for football fans there is much to appreciate. The Place du Capitole is one 
of the liveliest squares in France, and there’s also the shady towpath of the
Canal du Midi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/13/canal-du-midi-under-threat> to 
stroll along.

Eat Toulouse is the gastronomic capital of the region, and even the rugby 
stadium has a Michelin-starred chef 
<http://www.stadetoulousain.fr/la-brasserie-du-stade-toulousain> serving up the 
half-time grub in his brasserie. Head to the rue des Blanchers for a huddle of 
great restaurants: try the shredded lamb shank confit atDu Plaisir à la Toque 
<http://www.duplaisiralatoque.fr/> (€26 for two courses), or cram in for lunch 
at one of the five restaurants on the first floor of theVictor Hugo market 
<http://www.marche-victor-hugo.fr/> – most offer a three-course meal for around 
€25, and L’Impérial does an excellentcassoulet Toulousain.

<https://www.facebook.com/Pub-Saint-Pierre-152297064822351/> beside the Garonne

At a glance Lille <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/lille> began reinventing 
itself when it was European Capital of Culture in 2004, and has never looked 
back. The old medieval town centre, Vieux Lille, boasts ornate guild houses and 
renaissance palaces, but there are also cutting-edge art venues like the 
Tripostal andMaison Folie Wazemmes <http://maisonsfolie.lille.fr/>. Above all, 
the welcoming Lillois have a deserved reputation for enjoying themselves, which 
visitors quickly discover in the city’s numerous bistros and pubs.


Eat In a backstreet behind the train station, A La Renaissance (29 place des 
Reignaux) is a raucouscantine serving Lillois cuisine, such as delicious pavé 
de rumsteak topped with a tangy Maroilles cheese sauce and a mountain of frites 
for €13. Bistros here are traditionally known asestaminets, and at the redbrick 
Chez La Vieille <http://estaminetlille.fr/chezlavieille/> little has changed – 
from the regional dishes to the cosy decor– since it opened a century ago. 
There’s a large selection of ales, and don’t miss the €13carbonnades flamandes, 
a rich beef and beer casserole.

 Les 3 Brasseurs 
Drink Walk out of the Eurostar station and there are half a dozen tempting 
pubs to choose from.Les 3 Brasseurs 
<http://www.les3brasseurs.com/restaurant-brasserie/455-Lille.aspx> is actually 
a microbrewery with most of the beers made on the premises, and they serve 
tasty pub grub, like the specialityLe Welsh

cheese melted with brown ale.La Capsule 
<https://www.facebook.com/La-Capsule-120976054751869/> specialises in artisan 
and abbey-brewed beers, plus a wide selection of whiskies and the local Flemish 
firewater,genievre, brewed from juniper berries, which is like gin but drunk 
neat. As Lille has become more fashionable, there are now cocktail and wine 
bars to choose from, too. The tinyChez Paulette 
<https://www.facebook.com/chezpaulettelille/> combines a wide choice of wines 
with classic cocktails, while a plate of foie gras can be had for €10.
