Museum pass: Istanbul Müzekart

Planning some serious sightseeing? The Istanbul Museum Pass 
<http://www.muzekart.com/en/museum-pass/about_27.html> allows free entrance to 
a dozen of the city’s top sites, including theTopkapı Palace 
<http://topkapisarayi.gov.tr/en> and the Hagia Sophia 
<http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en>, plus discounts on a selection of other 
museums, shops, restaurants and activities. It costs a wallet-friendly 85 lira 
(£20 at current, favourable, rates) for three days or 115 lire (£27) for five 
days. Even better, passholders can jump the queues, too. Insider tip: although 
you can purchase your Müzekart from any of the participating museums, save 
yourself precious time by doing so at one of the quieter venues, such as the
Istanbul Archaeological Museums <http://www.istanbularkeoloji.gov.tr/main_page>.

Plenty of visitors to this sprawling city opt for a Bosphorus boat tour. These 
scenic cruises chug along the straits, taking in highlights such as the 
15th-century Rumeli Hisarı fort and the pretty waterside village of Arnavutköy. 
These are not pricey (from £3 for a90-minute ride <http://www.turyol.com/en/>), 
but penny pinchers can simply hop aboard one of the hundreds of commuter 
ferries (ido.com.tr <http://www.ido.com.tr/en>) that zip back and forth across 
this teeming waterway every day. For about 35p, you can travel between Europe 
and Asia, glass ofçay (tea, around 20p) in hand, while admiring those same 
sights, as well as a skyline splashed with the Galata Tower, the Blue Mosque 
and the Princes’ Islands.

 Hush hostel, Kadiköy 
The suburb of Karaköy is now so painfully hip that many locals instead hop on 
a direct ferry to Kadıköy, just across the water. This Asian neighbourhood’s 
most historic quarter, Yeldeğirmeni, is studded with frescoed French villas and 
Italianate apartments. For boutique teashops and vegan cafes, wander down the 
main boulevard, Iskele Sokak. Action is centred around the Yeldeğirmeni Art 
Center, formerly the French-built Notre Dame du Rosaire church. Catch a film 
screening, workshop or exhibition here, or in theDesign Atelier Kadıköy 
<http://takortak.org/> building around the block. Yeldeğirmeni’s most eccentric 
attraction is theDon Kişot (Quixote) Occupied Building 
<https://www.facebook.com/donkisotsosyalmerkezi> on Duatepe Sokak. This social 
squat hosts alternative Saturday meetings with seed swaps and food workshops. 
Our favourite fashionable hostel,Hush <http://www.hushhostelistanbul.com/>, 
with dorm beds from £10, is just round the corner.

 Istanbul On Bike offers several tours of the city 
Pedalling around Istanbul’s bustling streets isn’t the most obvious way to get 
to know this booming metropolis. But Istanbul’s increasingly popular cycling 
tours can be an unexpected delight. AtIstanbul On Bike 
<http://www.istanbulonbike.com/>, Dario and team offer half a dozen tours that 
pedal past the Sultanahmet neighbourhood’s highlights (including the Grand 
Bazaar), edge along the Golden Horn waterfront or meander through Kadıköy. For 
something more challenging, book a 45km loop along both Istanbul’s European and 
Asian Bosphorus shores, taking in the picturesque suburb of Ortaköy and the 
Bosphorus Bridge. Three-hour tours start at €45pp, based on four participants, 
and include bike rental, helmets, drinks and snacks.

Turkish delights has rarely been cheaper. For books, the recently opened Ferman 
Sahaf (Kemeraltı Caddesi 21) stocks vintage Istanbul architectural tomes and

abounds:Mixerarts <http://mixerarts.com/> (Karabaş Caddesi 27) is a

most successful works go on public sale. For snazzy homewares, tryKağıthane

shelf space.

 Fever pitch … Beşiktaş in action. Photograph: Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images 
Football fans in Istanbul are so vociferous that when Beşiktaş played local 
rivals Fenerbahçe a decade ago, the decibel level clocked 132, the equivalent 
of a plane taking off. Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray, the third club of Istanbul’s 
big three, aim to top this season’s Turkish Süper Lig with respective new 
signings Lukas Podolski and Robin van Persie. Watching a live game is raucous, 
boisterous yet overwhelmingly friendly. Things have become safer since the 
recent introduction of the Passolig identity card system. Foreigners must 
register online (in English, atpasso.com.tr/en 
<https://www.passo.com.tr/en/common/test/find-match-tickets.aspx>) before 
purchasing match tickets. Even better, all three clubs are set to welcome 
Europe’s top teams this year. Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe play in the Champions 
League, and Beşiktaş hosts Europa League clubs in a sparkling new stadium 
opposite the Dolmabahçe Palace – former home to the Ottoman sultans.

If you’ve spent your day sightseeing in Istanbul’s bustling Sultanahmet, it’s 
hard to imagine losing the crowds in this city of 14 million people. Yet 
Istanbul is scattered with choice green spaces, each ideal for a picnic or 
simply a quiet breather. Escape to the Beşiktaş neighbourhood’s Yıldız Park, 
formerly royal hunting grounds serving the Dolmabahçe Palace opposite. Today 
the park is crisscrossed by sun-dappled footpaths leading to ornate 
19th-century pavilions. Across the Bosphorus in Üsküdar, the serene Haydarpaşa 
cemetery is a lesson in British military history, with the graves of 
Commonwealth soldiers who fought in the Crimea and the first and second world 
wars. The former imperial retreat of Gülhane Park is great for a leafy respite 
in downtown Sultanahmet.

The once-grand suburb of Balat was home to Istanbul’s Greek and Jewish 
populations, and ancient places of worship such as theChora  
<http://kariye.muze.gov.tr/> church and Ahrida synagogue remain. An EU-funded 
project saw about 100 of Balat’s dilapidated townhouses restored to their 
original glory, and the neighbourhood’s brightly coloured, bougainvillea-strewn 
buildings now house cafes including live Arabesque music spot Derviş Baba 
(Kürkçü Çeşmesi Caddesi 79) and female-run Café Vodina (Vodina Caddesi 41). 
Vodina Caddesi is a multi-hued Portobello Road of antiques stores and 
haberdashers, plus ancient sights including the 15th-century Tahtaminare hamam 
(no 95), and the hidden Metochion of Jerusalem Orthodox Church (the shop owner 
at no 48 holds the key).

Turkey’s historical hamams – steamy, swathed in marble and famed for their 
no-holds-barred scrub-downs – are on most Istanbul visitors’ to-do lists. But 
in recent years, prices at downtown bathhouses have skyrocketed. Budget 
travellers are advised to head to the 17th-centuryÇinili hamam 
<http://cinilihamam.com/eng/default.asp?p=homepage> in the Asian suburb of 
Üsküdar instead. For around £9 you’ll be lathered, pummelled and swaddled 
alongside local bathers. For visitors short on time, meticulously renovated
Kılıç Ali Paşa hamam <http://kilicalipasahamami.com/> – in hip Karaköy offers a 
reasonably priced yet luxuriously bubbly wash and massage for around £35.

The crumbling walls that encircle European Istanbul from the Golden Horn to 
the Sea of Marmara were built in 413AD – just in time to protect the city from 
Attila the Hun. Discover a cross-section of local history by hiking the five 
miles alongside and atop the 96 defensive towers. Start in the south at the 
seven-towered castle of Yedikule. In 1889, the first direct Orient Express from 
Paris rattled through a hole in the city walls just north of here. Walk on to 
find allotments on top of the moat that once ringed the ramparts. From the high 
point of the splendid Mihrimah Sultan mosque, descend to the Palace of the 
Porphyrogenitus – once an emperors’ crash pad, later a Jewish poorhouse, a tile 
factory and a brothel.
