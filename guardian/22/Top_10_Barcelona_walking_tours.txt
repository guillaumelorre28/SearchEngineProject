The DIY tour

A guided walk is the quick and easy way to learn lots about a place but at 
€10-€20pp the cost can soon rack up, particularly for a family. Guiding 
yourself keeps the price down and lets you choose your own pace. The Ruta del 
Modernisme winds through the city linking more than 100 examples of Catalonia’s 
famed take on art nouveau. You could be cheap and read descriptions of 
buildings from the ruta’s rather clunky website, but the accompanying guidebook 
is only €12 and gets you a discounted entry to many sights. All the biggies, 
such as Gaudí’s Sagrada Família and the Palau de la Música Catalana by Lluís 
Domènech i Montaner are on the ruta but you can search out the work of 
lesser-known architects,such as my favourite, Josep Maria Jujol

As in many other cities, a new type of tour has taken off in Barcelona in the 
last few years. Tours are “free” – you just give your guide what you think is a 
fair tip at the end. Simple. But are they any good? I tried half a dozen tours 
of the Gothic Quarter and soon felt like Phil Connors in Groundhog Day. Most of 
the tours were average and one was spectacularly bad – it took us nearly an 
hour to actually get to the Gothic Quarter and, no, I don’t want to buy a 
ticket for your tapas tour and, no, George Orwell wasn’t shot in Barcelona. But 
I’d heartily recommend a couple. I expected to take against Sandemans New 
Europe because it’s a bit of a corporate behemoth but my guide, Leon, was 
brilliant. I also loved the passion of Laura from Travel Bound.
• Tips average around €10-€15pp, 2-3 hours, Sandemans (newbarcelona-tours.com

You can’t fail to notice the city’s obsession with the spray can; every metal 
shop shutter in the Raval, just off the Ramblas, seems to be covered in 
designs. But I hadn’t seen anything until I walked the barrio with Dominic, who 
spent his teenage years leaving his mark on commuter trains in Sydney. He 
taught me about tagging, throw-ups and stencilling, and showed me the work of 
famous street artists such as El Gordo (fat guys with square faces on tiles) 
and BCN Cans (cans sprayed with a letter then stuck together to spell out 
messages such as “Tonight the streets are ours”). A squad of city workers armed 
with paint brushes polices the streets to wipe out graffiti but they’re 
fighting a losing battle.

 A market stopoff on Barcelona Eat Local’s morning walking tour. 
The food scene in the district of Poble Sec at the foot of Montjuic hill is 
hotter than a guindilla pepper. I have some favourite places, such asMano Rota 
<http://www.manorota.com/>, but put myself into the hands of the experts to 
discover more. Barcelona Eat Local’s tour, unusually, started in the morning 
but that did mean we got to sample greatbacallà (salt cod) in the market and 
visit a wine shop owned by a cava producer for a glass at noon before patatas 
bravas (probably the best I’ve ever had) and jamón in a very trad restaurant, 
and then Ferran Adrià’s favourite lunch stop – the king of molecular gastronomy 
apparently loves old-school offal. The Barcelona Taste tour is in the evening 
and we ate spectacularly well, from anchovies in a modern tapas bar to octopus 
in an Argentinian-run joint and Szechuan fish in a place that epitomises Poble 
Sec right now. These tours are undoubtedly expensive but they include all food 
and drink and are a world away in quality from the €15 old town tapas tours.

 Runner Bean’s Kids and Family tour 
Dragons, giants, pooing peasants – and sweets. What’s not for a child to like 
on Runner Bean’s Kids and Family tour? I borrowed four, aged four-12, and we 
set off with guide Ann-Marie. She enthralled the kids with thegrisly story 
behind the Catalan flag <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senyera> illustrated 
with her own drawings. There were games, puzzles and jokes as we wandered the 
Gothic Quarter learning a bit of history. The children loved the tale of how 
Saint George (Catalonia’s patron saint) slayed the dragon and saved the 
princess and visiting the workshop where giant figures are made for the city’s 
many festivals. They were a bit uncertain about singing Ann-Marie’s version of 
the Catalan song aboutthe Christmas log that poos turrón (nougat) 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti%C3%B3_de_Nadal> and looked appalled when she 
pulled outa figurine of a caganer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caganer>. Who 
can blame them? The tour finished at a shop making artisan candy. Sweet.

A group of young architects are behind Barcelona Architecture Walks and I 
signed up for their Barcelona and the Future City stroll. Plaça de les Glòries 
Catalanes was to be the new centre of Barcelona in its 19th-century expansion 
but it ended up little more than a vast, unlovely traffic junction. The square 
is now a building site as the city authorities try to rescue this space. Guide 
Jordi explained some of the theories of urban planning – keeping within a 
beginner’s comprehension/boredom level – before we walked by some of the new 
buildings here, such asEncants market <http://encantsbcn.com/en> and the Design 
Museum, the Museu del Disseny de Barcelona 
<http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museudeldisseny/en>. A fascinating glimpse 
into an architect’s world and the challenges of imagining a city’s future.

I always pick up my camera with a heavy heart, imagining that it stops me from 
just seeing stuff. That’s probably why my photographs are so terrible, and why 
Fran from Foto Ruta Barcelona had his work cut out. Our small group met in the 
Born and Fran explained a few basics: light, perspective, the rule of thirds 
(about composition) and encouraged us to experiment. I didn’t lie on the 
pavement like one of the group to get a pug’s view of street life but I did 
snap away at shapes, colours and details. Days later I still found myself 
looking at familiar streets in a new way. We compared photographs at the end 
and mine were by far the worst – but, gulp, here’s one (above).

 Tourists on a Hidden City Tours trip. 
There are reckoned to be at least 3,000 people living on the city’s streets 
but they can be almost invisible to tourists. Hidden City Tours was set up by a 
Brit to employ, as guides, people who have been on the streets. Former taxi 
driver Jaume led me on the new Street Life tour amid the Raval, taking me 
through an average day in the life of a homeless person, from where to sleep (a 
park in summer, a bank’s cashpoint lobby in winter) and how to keep clean 
(library washrooms) to how to make money (blowing giant soap bubbles) and where 
to eat (for example, one of Barcelona’s poshest hotels delivers a giant free 
paella each Thursday to soup kitchenEl Chiringuito de Dios 
<http://elchiringuitodedios.org/>. Jaume is now off the streets and back 
working as a driver as well as guiding.

 Montjuïc hill. Photograph: Alamy 
Montjuïc hill has always offered a splash of green in this densely packed 
city. Biologist Mónica is charming and passionate and took me on a fascinating 
nature tour of this hulk of rock. It moved from descriptions of flora and fauna 
– such as how the uniform weight of the seeds of carob trees, found on 
Montjuïc, are the basis for the carat – to explanations of how nature has 
affected the look of Barcelona. For example, we stopped at an oleander shrub 
and Mónica showed how Antoni Gaudí used the unusual structure of a stalk as the 
model for the columns of the Sagrada Família. She also found time to bring in 
social history, explaining how the hill was once covered in shanty towns, 
housing a fifth of the city’s population in the 1960s. Mónica’s partner Nick

I stooped through a little door in a dark, narrow street behind the cathedral 
and back to the fourth century. This is the only remaining synagogue in what 
was once a thriving Jewish community, which lasted from Roman times to the 15th 
century. More than 10% of the city’s 40,000 population in the 14th century was 
Jewish, all squeezed into a few streets. Jon, from New Jersey, walked us round 
their barrio, explaining how Jews played a key role in the life of the city; 
the doctors, lawyers and fixers of their time. The Catalan kings loved the 
taxes they paid and protected them – until they let the Inquisition have its 
fun. Jews were expunged from history; street names were Christianised and 
headstones from the Jewish cemetery were ripped up and used in new buildings – 
you can still see them on a wall near the cathedral.
