Labor has referred Centrelink’s automated debt recovery failures to the 
auditor general, while highlighting the case of a cancer survivor told to repay 
$4,500 he claimed while recovering from chemotherapy.

Labor MP Linda Burney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/28/call-to-suspend-centrelink-system-after-single-mother-receives-24000-debt-notice>
 wrote to the Australian National Audit Office on Thursday, urging it to 
investigate, citing significant public concern. “The number of complaints to my 
office and my colleagues’ offices has been overwhelming,” she wrote.

Burney said the budget implications of the program – designed to save the 
government $4bn over the forward estimates – were significant.

She asked auditor-general Grant Hehir to investigate how the government 
managed the risks associated with automating its debt recovery program, the 
savings it has delivered to date and the efficiency of budget allocations made 
for the program in the next two years.

“The acting minister says they’ve saved $300m but senior public servants 
contradict him – it is time for an independent audit,” Burney said in a media 
statement.

“Every week that the government refuses to fix this problem another 4,000 
honest people receive letters which wrongly suggest they’ve been dishonest – 
that isn’t just unfair, it’s plain nasty,” she said.

Labor’s Anthony Albanese appeared in Sydney on Friday to urge the government 
to acknowledge its debt recovery system was operating “in an incompetent and a 
callous way”.

Albanese was flanked by Tony Barber, a cancer survivor who Centrelink 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/centrelink> issued with a $4,500 
debt from 2010.

Barber had been recovering from chemotherapy at the time he claimed welfare – 
the first and only time he has received benefits – before recovering and 
returning to work in early 2011.

“This is an extraordinarily callous government, who when I saw [social 
services minister Christian] Porter being dismissive of the circumstances of 
individual vulnerable Australians, it made me sick to the stomach,” Albanese 
said.

He said the Coalition’s “slash and burn” approach to the public service had 
weakened Centrelink, forcing Australians to spend hours on the phone, and 
unable to have their issue handled in the agency’s offices.

Deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said he made no apologies for making 
sure those who were overpaid welfare were forced to pay it back.


Joyce told the ABC that the complaint rate, which is not the number of debts 
being disputed, remained very low, at 0.16%.

“So what we have is the process of making sure that your taxes, that you pay, 
and I pay, and all your listeners pay, are well spent on those who need it,” he 
said.

Australian information and privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, also issued 
a statement on Friday, saying his office was in contact with the Department of 
Human Services.

He said no formal investigation had been opened, but that his office worked 
closely with the department and other government agencies “to ensure they 
understand their privacy obligations and adopt best practice when undertaking 
data-matching activities”.


“We also undertake assessments (formerly termed audits) of DHS’s data-matching 
activities to ensure that the personal information collected through these 
processes continues to be managed in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988.”

The system has also been described as a breach of Australia’s human rights 
obligations.

Australian Lawyers for Human Rights issued a statement on Friday calling for 
the compliance system to be suspended, saying the attacks on welfare recipients 
were “wrong at so many legal levels that it’s hard to know where to begin”.

“At the most basic level, no entity should be issuing legal demands for money 
unless they are absolutely certain the money is owed and can substantiate this 
in court,” ALHR president president Benedict Coyne said.

“It is for the creditor to prove any debt. It is also up to the creditor to 
ensure the alleged debtor receives the repayment demand,” Coyne said.

“The whole procedure is quite unethical and a complete abuse of legal process.”

The automated compliance system, which began in July, now faces scrutiny from 
at least three outside agencies. TheCommonwealth ombudsman was asked to 
investigate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/21/ombudsman-asked-to-investigate-if-centrelink-wrongly-pursuing-welfare-debts>
 last month, and has since responded to independent Andrew Wilkie, telling him 
the office was “aware of the issues raised and are currently seeking further 
information from Centrelink”.


Albanese said he was sympathetic to the public servants who were having to 
turn away vulnerable people asking for help.

“This is a government that likes to talk about people in politics being 
engaged in scare campaigns,” he said.

“Well, let me tell you – they are scaring the life out of vulnerable 
Australians who have received these letters, who have received debts that they 
don’t actually owe.”

The system relies on a crude process of data-matching between fortnightly 
income records held by Centrelink and the Australian taxation office.


Where discrepancies previously would have been reviewed by staff, the system 
now automatically sends letters to Australians, demanding they prove they were 
entitled to claim benefits that can be up to six years old.

Many people have reported not receiving the letters or other communication 
from Centrelink, first hearing about the debt when they are contacted by a 
private debt collection firm.

Others have simply paid the debt without question.
