Cath Kidston, the fashion brand famous for its floral patterns, is set for 
significant expansion in Asia after it was taken over by a Hong Kong-based 
investment firm.

Baring Private Equity Asia has bought out TA Associates, a US private equity 
company, to take control of Cath Kidston. The new owners have appointed William 
Flanz, the former boss of Gucci, as chairman of Cath Kidston and have 
identified Asia as a key market for the brand.

Baring first invested in Cath Kidston two years ago when it acquired a 40% 
stake in a deal that valued that company at around £250m

. The new deal, which involves Baring buying TA’s 40% stake, is understood to 
value Cath Kidston at significantly more than £250m, although the price has not 
been disclosed.

Cath Kidston founded the eponymous business with its first store in Holland 
Park, London, in 1993. It hasbecome renowned for its bags, accessories and 
clothing

 in a range of floral designs.

Kidston still owns approximately 11% of the business, although she stepped 
down as creative director in 2014. The management team owns the remaining 9% of 
the brand.

The company now has 226 shops, with 70% outside the UK. It has 133 shops in 
Asia already and will open in India later this year.

Last week it launched a collaboration with Disney that involves a collection 
of products based on Winnie the Pooh. Cath Kidston said the new products led to 
its biggest ever day of full-price sales online, with 58 mugs sold every hour 
on the day of launch and a 500% increase in online sales in Korea.

Kenny Wilson, chief executive of Cath Kidston, said: “We are entering a really 
exciting new stage under a single owner. Baring Asia’s decision to increase its 
shareholding is a fantastic endorsement of the potential of the Cath Kidston 
brand and I would like to welcome Bill Flanz.

“This year has been our most successful start to the year, proving the 
strength of our product and the continued and growing appeal of the brand to 
existing and new customers. As well as expanding internationally, we continue 
to innovate as demonstrated by our new collaboration with Disney, which lands 
in stores this month. We are very excited about the future.”
