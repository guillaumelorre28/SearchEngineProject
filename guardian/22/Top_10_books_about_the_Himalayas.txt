People like to travel to the Himalayas and write about what they have seen and 
experienced (and make it up if the reality has been a little disappointing). 
For my book White Mountain: Real and Imagined Journeys in the Himalayas, I read 
hundreds of books – some skimmed, some pored over and reread several times. 
After a while, I was pretty sick of reading about the Himalayas. This has worn 
off – kind of – but below are those I would go back and read again.


1. Seven Years in Tibet by Heinrich Harrer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/09/guardianobituaries.johngittings>
This is such a strange book, even if, on the surface it presents a kind of 
attractive peasant naivety. It tells of Harrer’s escape from a British PoW camp 
in India near the end of the second world war. (He knew Germany had lost, so 
escaping was an existential choice rather than a practical one.) He went over 
the Himalayas and into Tibet, which was very much a closed country at the time. 
The adventures and indignities that Harrer suffers makes his book great 
reading, and it just gets better and better when he meets the current Dalai 
Lama, then a teenager, and becomes his teacher.

2. Tales of the Dervishes by Idries Shah 
<http://rsaa.org.uk/blog/2014/12/30/robert-twigger-50-years-after-idries-shahs-the-sufis/>
Shah, of Afghan descent, was born in Simla in the Himalayas and travelled 
extensively in Afghan, Pakistan and Indian mountain regions, collecting tales 
and stories, most notably the jokes of Mulla Nasrudin. His purpose was not only 
folkloric or academic; Shah sought to extract the living truths often 
encapsulated in traditional tales, and Tales of the Dervishes provides a good 
selection of such stories about Himalayan people.

3. The Confessions of Aleister Crowley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/20/news.poetry>
Despite his deplorable behaviour, Crowley is significant as one of the 
pioneers of Himalayan climbing. He was also, oddly enough, vigorously opposed 
to British colonialism and modern in his appreciation of the spiritual 
traditions of native people. The routes he essayed up K2 and Kanchenjunga 
proved to be the final routes chosen in the successful ascent of those 
mountains. Crowley never got to the top of either, although he made it to 
around 25,000ft – a creditable performance for someone climbing in 1902 in 
tweeds and nailed boots. But beware, he was apt to fib – his claim that he 
invented crampons is not to be believed.

4. Lost Horizon by  <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lost-horizon-293257.html>
James Hilton <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lost-horizon-293257.html>
The must-read novel for any visitor to the Himalayas that yarns about the 
fabled kingdom of Shangri-La. Hugh Conway, our protagonist and a first world 
war veteran, hears of a place where people do not age and he’s off. Inspired, 
to some extent, by the writing of explorer Joseph Rock, Hilton manages the 
tricky task of writing about peace and contentment without losing a narrative 
edge.

5. Everest: Kangshung Face by Stephen Venables
One of the most outstanding high-altitude climbers in the world, Venables shot 
to fame with his first ascent of Everest by the Kangshung face in 1988 without 
supplementary oxygen. Everyone on the commercial climbs up Everest now take the 
much easier south-west and north-east routes, and all of them use oxygen. Even 
Reinhold Messner, who made the first oxygen-less ascent of Everest in 1978, 
used a route that had been climbed before. The Bravo Two Zero school of 
writing, which has infected all adventure sports, is not apparent here. 
Venables – bespectacled, learned, self-effacing, madly daring – is the poster 
boy of all who believe climbing is more than just brute force and pitons.

6. Lost in the Himalayas by James Scott
With inadequate gear, no food and a poor plan, Scott ended up lost in the 
Nepalese Himalayas in winter for 43 days, until the efforts of his sister and 
several Buddhist monks enabled him to be found. Taking courage from the fact 
thatIRA member Bobby Sands lived for more than 60 days 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/05/bobby-sands-1981-hunger-strikes>
 without food on a hunger strike, Scott drinks melted snow water and comes to 
many revelations about life and death. A moving and inspiring book.

7. Nanda Devi by Hugh Thompson
A fascinating account of a journey to the forbidden peak of Nanda Devi. Hugh 
Thompson combines this travel narrative with information about the strange 
events that have occurred on the peak, including a nuclear-powered transmitter 
lost there by the CIA, the strange death of climber Willi Unsoeld’s daughter 
(prophetically named Nanda Devi Unsoeld), and the early attempts to crack the 
impregnable “citadel” by the legendary climbers Eric Shipton and Bill Tilman.

8. Plant Hunting on the Edge of the World by F Kingdon-Ward
Frank Kingdon Ward was the great plant hunter of the eastern Himalayas. In 
appalling conditions of rain and leech-filled jungle mud, he set about 
collecting thousands of plants that have now been successfully grown around the 
world. He met my grandfather, an army engineer, in Nagaland on the 
Burmese-Indian border. “Good man,” my grandfather said. “Knows his onions.” 
(That was the highest praise he gave.)

9. Red Shambhala by Andrei Znamenski
An engrossing historical read about how Himalayan-inspired mysticism 
penetrated to the highest levels of Stalin’s oppressive secret police. The 
story begins in the whacky days after the revolution where every idea was 
entertained – at least for a while – by the new communist government. The 
attempts to convert Tibet into a Buddhist-communist stronghold make for 
salutary and intriguing reading.

10. Himalaya by Michael Palin 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/himalaya-7.html>
I don’t give much time to celebrity writing, but Palin’s is different. This is 
a really interesting and rather offbeat account of the travels that went into 
the filming of his TV series. He covers a lot of ground – physically and also 
in the books and references he manages to cram in. Still very enjoyable 12 
years after it was first published.
