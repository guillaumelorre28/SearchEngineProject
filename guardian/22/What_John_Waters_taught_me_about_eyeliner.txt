Divine shaved back her hairline in order to have more room for make-up. If 
that’s not a handbook for living, then Christ, I don’t know what is.

I read about Pink Flamingos before I saw it – even in the 1990s, a film where 
the star literally eats shit was difficult to track down. I’d been introduced 
to John Waters’ films through a video of Hairspray, one of his first 
“mainstream” successes, a film about a fat white girl who defeats racism by 
dancing at it, a film that inspired my sister, four at the time, to ask my 
grandma if she wanted to “get naked and smoke”. In Hairspray, and Pink 
Flamingos before it, I found more than just excitement and politics and a right 
laugh – I found my glamour.

Every morning, Waters carefully shapes his moustache with Maybelline Velvet 
Black kohl; alongside Divine, the supporting actor in all his work is the 
eyeliner. Next month, the BFI celebrates “50 years of filth” with a Waters 
retrospective, including his 1968 short Eat Your Makeup, which has never been 
screened in the UK before. The story of a nanny who forces girls to model 
themselves to death after making them gorge on make-up, it was a precursor to 
my very favourite film, Female Trouble (1974), where they mainline liquid 
eyeliner as if it’s the best drug in the world. Which, I’ve learned, it sort of 
is.

Since I first watched a Waters film, black eyeliner has been code for 
something a bit bad, a bit rude. For a glamour that is not pretty, but instead 
is big and brash and smells of smoke. Like Divine, my make-up heroes (Cher, the 
Ronettes) share that sense of parodying femininity. The eyeliner is TOO black. 
The hair is too big. Rather than seductive or sweet, the beauty is 
intimidating. Almost monstrous. This, I think, is what make-up should be for. 
Not for prettifying, but for playing around. With fashion, with gender.

 John Waters Photograph: HANDOUT 
By casting an obese drag queen to play his beehived bombshells, Waters told us 
something about how we perform as women. There are no “natural” looks in 
Waters’ films – his are worlds of excess and campery, and crime and hair dye. 
Through his films, where men play women playing teenage girls, he taught me how 
to paint on the person you wanted to be, and for that I’ll love him forever.
