It was 15 years ago this week that Microsoft 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft> launched its first foray 
into the console business. Arriving in the US on 15 November 2001, the original 
Xbox was designed to compete directly against Sony’s all-consuming PlayStation 
2. Offering a powerful graphics processor as well as a built-in hard drive and 
a dedicated online gaming service, it was basically a gaming PC wrestled into 
the chassis of games machine – thereby setting the architectural trend that 
would dominate the industry going forward.

Next came the Xbox 360, the dominant online multiplayer console of its era, 
introducing the idea of achievements and a gamer score mechanic that encouraged 
players to get the absolute most out of every title they purchased. And now 
we’re in theXbox One <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox-one> era, the 
industrial and architectural design decisions of that original machine still 
guiding Microsoft’s approach to console development – albeit in a much more 
powerful form.

For this list we’ve concentrated on Xbox exclusives, or games that were 
better, earlier or more acclaimed on Xbox. Naturally, there are scandalous 
omissions and oversights – but that’s where you come in, right? Tell us your 
own personalXbox <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox> favourites in 
the comments section.

Arguably, Lionhead reached its creative peak with the second title in this 
idiosyncratic role-playing adventure series. A beautiful environment, richly 
drawn characters and exciting story came together perfectly with a quaint 
sideline in romance, relationships and offbeat humour, making this a distinctly 
British rendering of the genre.

Directed by Casey Hudson who would go on to lead development on Mass Effect, 
this role-playing adventure, set thousands of years before the events of the 
Star Wars movies, really built the foundations of Bioware’s approach to game 
design. An unforgettable fusion of narrative, character, combat, dialogue and, 
of course, a pretty good movie license.

Featuring a failed Art Deco utopia, bizarre diving suit-clad monsters and a 
story that twisted and looped around the player’s assumptions, Bioshock 
introduced a new kind of action adventure game, loaded with meaning, style and 
adult themes. One of the most important – and widely discussed – narrative 
games ever devised.

While the opening title in Bioware’s acclaimed interactive space opera 
introduced the characters and scenario that millions would come to love, it was 
the second adventure that cemented the cast, structure and design. An 
astonishingly assured blend of genres, experiences and disparate narrative 
forces into one cogent and moving experience.

The story of macho space warriors and their chainsaw guns really hit its 
destructive stride in this second instalment. Marcus Fenix and co are forced to 
take the battle to the Locust underworld, leading to brilliant set-piece 
battles, wonderfully apocalyptic settings (EpicGames 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> famously referred to its art 
style as ‘destroyed beauty’) and expert use of the game’s cover-focused combat 
system. Multiplayer was re-engineered too, to include the hugely influential 
Horde mode.

 Halo: Combat Evolved (Anniversary Edition) Photograph: Microsoft 
Although GoldenEye was the first game to successfully bring the dynamics of 
the first-person shooter to games machines, Halo turned the whole concept of 
the console shooter into a distinct and credible artform. Excellent controls, 
brilliant structure, an array of weapons, smart enemies, a cogent, engrossing 
universe, Bungie’s game was revolutionary. And of course, it is the game that 
even now is most synonymous with Xbox – the attitude, aims and technology of 
the console series are all illustrated right here in this science fiction epic. 
Halo is Xbox and Xbox is Halo.
