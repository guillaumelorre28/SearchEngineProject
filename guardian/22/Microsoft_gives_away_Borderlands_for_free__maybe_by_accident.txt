Microsoft <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft> is giving away 
two of the best games of the last console generation for free, possibly by 
mistake.

Borderlands: The Handsome Collection, which contains Borderlands 2 and 
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, is free for the Xbox One right now, and userscan 
add the games to their library on Microsoft’s website 
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-unlock-bundle/bvrk77xxgbwb>
.

All wonderful and very generous, but it might not actually be deliberate. 
Although Microsoft does regularly give away games for free, it normally 
requires recipients to be members ofXbox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox> Live Gold. Sony does similar, 
giving free games away to members of its competing Playstation Plus service. 
But Borderlands is available to non-members too.

Also, Microsoft hasn’t actually said anything about the games, which is weird 
if it’s a promotion because promotions are normally, well, promoting something.

If you do download the game, Microsoft might even take it away from you, just 
like it did back in June when another mistake gave away free copies of Fallout 
4. Then again, that was a fairly new, AAA game, rather than an older port; and 
even then, users were given $10 store credit for free.

So why not grab Borderlands? The worst thing that will happen is you won’t 
have Borderlands in a bit.

Microsoft has not replied to a request for comment.
