1 I never wanted to become a fashion designer, but I was always different from 
the other kids. At school everyone would wear black cardigans that came to 
their waists; mine hit my ankles. There was always an air of flamboyance to 
what I wore.

2 The 80s were the glory days of fashion. I wish I'd been a designer then: 
Dynasty, Joan Collins, shoulder pads, Gianni Versace. Women were curvaceous – 
all hips, tits, thighs and heels – reeking of perfume and wearing loads of 
make-up.

3 Never wear something unless you feel comfortable in it. If you feel 
uncomfortable, you will look it. There's no need to try too hard, especially as 
you get older. One can enjoy fashion, but you have to face that you can't be a 
trend setter.

4 I love Marilyn Monroe. She was a dangerous, outrageous character. She wore 
conical bras before anyone else. She was an uber-sexy blonde bombshell. 
Liberace is another icon of mine: the colours! The campness! The crystals!

5 Fashionwise I'd give anything a go – whether I'd pull it off is a different 
matter. I'd never wear a thong on the beach. I suspect I'm a bit past it for 
that.
