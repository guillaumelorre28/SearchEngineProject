The author of the Man Repeller <http://www.manrepeller.com/> blog is the Lena 
Dunham of the streetstyle world. The voice of her generation, as expressed in 
just the right boyfriend jean and perfectly mussed hair. With her minimal 
makeup and goofy faces, Medine puts style before vanity. (It should be pointed 
out that this is relatively easy to do when, like her, you are naturally 
gorgeous.)

Kris Jenner

The Vito Corleone de nos jours was our favourite new power player on the Paris 
front row. At Balmain she complemented Kim Kardashian’s ivory dress with a 
tuxedo worthy of James Bond; at Givenchy she was all ostrich feathers and 
crimson lipstick. By the final day, in fishnets and a statement No 5 handbag, 
she was shoulder-robing like a pro at Chanel.

Jony Ive

The first viewing of the Apple watch outside of Cupertino turned into a major 
love-in between the man who pretty much designed 21st-century developed-world 
urban life (Ive), and the costume-designers of that world (Wintour, Lagerfeld, 
Alaia). Ive defied the geek-chic stereotype by looking elegant in a pale blue 
shirt and toning suit, for a launch breakfast* at Colette boutique. (*Espressos 
on a tray. This is PFW after all.)

Neneh Cherry

Leave it to the coolest woman in the world ever (fact) to show the rest of 
those front-row amateurs how to rock a blanket this autumn. (With black 
trousers, and white trainers. Super cosy on the early morning Eurostar from 
London, which Neneh and her 18-year-old daughter Mabel caught to catch Stella’s 
10am show.)

Nicolas Ghesquière

It’s official: the jean jacket is back. Vuitton designer Ghesquière ditched 
his trademark show-day navy-blue crewneck sweater for a faded jean jacket this 
season. (Designers do not wear what they wear on show-day by accident. See:
Phoebe Philo in her Kate Bush tour T-shirt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/sep/28/phoebe-philo-unveils-warm-and-immensely-likeable-celine-collection-paris-fashion-week>
.) The boxy, flat-collared jacket is a key new-era Vuitton silhouette – in 
cracked patent leather, or some such Parisian fanciness – but this look is 
where it starts.

The style editor of German Harper’s Bazaar was this season’s insider 
girl-crush. She’s got a personalised Burberry blanket with her initials 
(natch), which she wears with DM boots. She has the ultimate perfect 
wavy-straight hair and can carry off Nike calf-length sport socks with a 
midi-skirt. Respect.

Virginie Mouzat

Mouzat is a fashion editor straight out of a Jackie Collins novel. A leonine 
tawny blonde with fabulous legs and a shoe collection you would happily chew 
off an arm for, she used to be the fashion editor of Le Monde and is now at 
Vanity Fair. She cites Philip Roth and Milan Kundera as influences and sees 
fashion as “a way of taking a position in the world”.

Michelle Williams

A #Firstworldproblem it may be, but it is actually quite difficult to go to 
the catwalk show of a house you are contracted to, wearing a new-season outfit 
that they have decided you will wear, and not look like a vacuous dolly.
Michelle Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michelle-williams>, who 
stars in Louis Vuitton’s current ads, gets kudos for making new-season Vuitton 
look like favourite clothes she packed in her wardrobe. Extra points for the 
messy bun, which is Kate Moss-perfect.

Miroslava Duma

In a scene where 5ft 11in pencil-thin blondes are two a penny, Duma is hard to 
miss: she is a tiny 5ft – and, this season, heavily pregnant. (The day 
Duma-and-bump wore Dries Van Noten purple zig-zagged coat will go down in 
maternity style history.) Duma is a force to be reckoned with – the daughter of 
a Russian oil magnate and senator, she is one of the prime fixers on the Moscow 
fashion scene – but she looks like a tinymatryoshka, with her hair in an 
old-fashioned centre-parted bun and a butter-wouldn’t-melt expression.

Geraldine Saglio

Do they put powdered-chic in the watercooler at French Vogue? The latest from 
the stable that brought you Carine Roitfeld and Emanuelle Alt is Geraldine 
Saglio. How do they get their hair to look simultaneously blow-dried and 
sumptuous, and late-night good-time-girl stringy? How do they do that thing 
where they roll a hem on a black jean and make it look as elegant as couture? 
We are none the wiser, but we continue to watch very closely.
