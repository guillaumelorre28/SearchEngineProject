The 11am catwalk show in the Tuileries on Wednesday was, in theory, a display 
of next spring’s ready-to-wear womenswear collection for the Parisian house of 
Margiela. In reality, the entwined stories ofJohn Galliano 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/john-galliano> and Paris fashion long ago 
moved beyond such mere technicalities.

Ready-to-wear womenswear is, anyway, a term that could be only very loosely 
applied to skirts wrapped in clingfilm, jackets made from sofa stuffing, and 
fishnet bodystockings; especially when many of the models on the catwalk are 
men.

Had he taken a job at a more pedestrian fashion house, the rehabilitated 
Galliano

 might have had to simply buckle down and make dresses. But Martin Margiela’s 
own work at the label he founded was as much a commentary on the fashion 
industry as a cog in its wheel.

From the very beginning of his career, Margiela was interested in challenging 
lazy assumptions around luxury, and questioning the wastefulness of fashion. 
This gives Galliano, now at the helm of Maison Margiela, a licence to be 
controversial – all within the safe space of a design studio, of course.


To attend one of Galliano’s catwalk shows for Maison Margiela can feel a 
little like being a caseworker keeping tabs on the designer’s return to 
normality and health. (The white lab coats worn as a longstanding house 
tradition by all Margiela employees only add to the illusion.) Viewed from that 
perspective, the signs were mostly positive.

The mood was more relaxed than at any of Galliano’s previous shows for 
Margiela, and the first one at which one could clearly recognise the 
high-spirited glamour that once made Galliano’s Dior such gleeful romps.

finish.’ Photograph: Rex Shutterstock 
The first outfit was a cartoonish version of a ladylike Parisian aesthetic, 
with a beautifully cut, luxurious white coat accompanied by a large white 
handbag, the model made up with silvered mascara streaks on her cheeks. A 
gorgeous, pistachio dress hung Christmas-tree dense with sparkling 3D 
embroidery was a delight. Kimono jackets and Obi belts recalled the iconic 
Madame Butterfly aesthetic of Galliano’s glory days at Dior.

The explanatory notes given out at catwalk shows often talk a good conceptual 
game, but one which is not fulfilled by the actual clothes. Here, though, the 
avowed ambition to “confront the demure tropes of femininity” was followed 
through with the casting, which picked up where July’s haute couture show left 
off by putting some of the clothes on men. This was all the more arresting in 
this collection, where the silk gowns and fishnet tights were so self-evidently 
feminine.

Galliano is courting controversy here, and asking questions of his audience. 
Is it more or less shocking to see a very thin model topless, wearing just a 
skirt, if the bony bare chest belongs to a man? Does a dainty, self-evidently 
expensive white handbag still look like a status symbol if it is roped to a 
model’s back like a child’s rucksack? No answers were offered. The show notes 
finished on a cryptic note: “Lo-fi, sci-fi, with a hi-fi finish.”

Dries Van Noten, by way of contrast, offered a straightforward take on spring 
fashion – in theory, at least. Backstage after the show, he described the 
clothes as “for a flamboyant lady, who dresses up, who flirts”.

Van Noten, ever self-effacing, made his clothes sound less interesting and 
original than they really were. Fabrics were exquisite, and colours put 
together with an original eye that turned two gaudy shades into an elegant 
combination. And while the look on his catwalk is at times extreme, the 
individual pieces sit at the outer edges of, but undoubtedly within, a 
real-life comfort zone.

Cropped wide trousers are rapidly becoming mainstream, while loud print 
blouses layered beneath coats are a next-season staple. The show was 
accompanied by a string quartet, which Van Noten said reflected the look he was 
aiming for: “sophisticated and raw at the same time”.
