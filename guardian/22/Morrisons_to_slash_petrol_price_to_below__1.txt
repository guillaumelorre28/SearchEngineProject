Morrisons <https://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons> is cutting the 
price of petrol to below £1 a litre for the first time since the Brexit vote, 
escalating a pre-Christmas price war among Britain’s biggest supermarkets.

From Monday, Morrisons <https://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons> 
customers spending more than £50 in stores will be able to fill their cars with 
unleaded petrol for 99.9p a litre, a 10p cut compared with Sunday.

Diesel drivers buying their groceries at Morrisons will also receive a 10p a 
litre cut, paying just over £1.

Roger Fogg, services director at the Bradford-based chain, said the price 
reduction was designed to help customers in the run-up to Christmas, including 
those shopping on Black Friday. The offer is available until 3 December.

“With Christmas around the corner, our customers tell us they very much 
welcome our help in reducing the cost of their fuel,” Fogg said. “That’s why we 
are turning the clock back to the start of this year when petrol prices were 
typically below £1 a litre.”

It is the third time in a week Morrisons has cut fuel prices. Last week the 
supermarket – along with Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s –cut fuel prices by up 3p a 
litre, bringing relief to drivers after several months of price hikes

. The price cuts took petrol down to 110.7p a litre, and diesel to 112.7p.

Fuel prices have risen in the months after the Brexit vote prompted a sharp 
drop in the value of the pound

.

Government figures showed that average fuel prices

 had reached their highest level since July last year, to 116.6p a litre for 
petrol and 119p a litre for diesel.
