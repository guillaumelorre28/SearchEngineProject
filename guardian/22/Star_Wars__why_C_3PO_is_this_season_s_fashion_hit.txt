C-3PO is on the cover of the latest issue of style magazine Love, and, like 
all the best male models, he is deploying his signature look: wide eyes, square 
jaw and cheekbones as contoured as a Kardashian. Though the image was styled by 
the magazine’s editor Katie Grand – a Jedi master of the fashion industry – 
there is no need for clothes. Instead, this is a celebration of the protocol 
droid’s innate high-shine style. The only accessory – a dog the exact shade of 
this season’s Gucci handbag – is the stylist’s own.

Star Wars’ glossiest robot is having a bit of a moment in fashion right now. 
He’salso on the cover of US GQ 
<http://www.gq.com/gallery/amy-schumer-photos-star-wars-trainwreck>, working 
those preternatural angles with Amy Schumer. The comedian is resplendent in 
blond plaits and a Princess Leia bikini and assiduously sucks C-3PO’s index 
finger. Inside the magazine, the mood gets even more Terry Richardson: there’s 
a three-in-a-bed scene with R2D2 and a lightsaber blow job (“Lucasfilm & Disney 
did not approve, participate or condone this inappropriate use of our characters
 
<http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/19/entertainment/amy-schumer-star-wars-gq-disney/>
,” the studio tweeted afterwards).

With its monastic robes and tone-on-tone tunics, the Star Wars trilogy 
(obviously we are talking about episodes IV to VI) is a perennial fashion 
fascination. Louis Vuitton creative director Nicolas Ghesquière – one of the 
most influential designers working today –is a particular fan 
<http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/04/nicolas-ghesquire-is-a-star-wars-nerd.html>. 
While at Balenciaga he created Star Wars-inspired jumpers, sweeping Darth 
Vader-style headgear and high-shine gold leggings that were pure Tatooine 
humanoid.His bedroom fireplace is decorated with a white plastic Star Wars 
helmet <http://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/2011/03/nicolas_ghesquiere-2/>; when 
he joined Instagram, the first image he posted was of a Stormtrooper.

For autumn/winter 2014, the force was strong with Rodarte, where floor-length 
dresses were printed with pictures of Threepio, Yoda and Luke Skywalker. The 
same season, Preen turned to the dark side, plastering tops and tunics with 
menacing Darth Vader headshots while a squad of monochrome-clad Stormtroopers 
took selfies with models and editors backstage.

Even when designers do not express their love for Star Wars explicitly, the 
influence is there. The Princess Leia effect is mainly seen in hair – not the 
absurd earmuff buns, but the plait headband worn in The Empire Strikes Back, 
which isvery Keash braid bar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/apr/13/the-rise-of-the-in-store-braiding-bar>
. Her oversized floor-length polo neck tunic dress is very now, too, andwould 
have looked perfect at Solange Knowles’s Givenchy campaign of a wedding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/nov/17/-sp-solange-knowles-ties-knot-million-hipster-wedding-blogs-swoon>
.

Elsewhere, the flowing ghetto goth robes of Rick Owens feel like an ode to 
Obi-wan Kenobi.Kanye West’s collection for Adidas 
<http://www.style.com/slideshows/fashion-shows/fall-2015-ready-to-wear/kanye-west-adidas-originals/collection/15>
 – all dusty-coloured, awkwardly fitting utility wear – was one-part Yoda to 
two-parts Prada. The fuzzy oversized furs of The Row are a clear nod to 
Chewbacca;nothing from this season’s Céline collection 
<http://www.style.com/slideshows/fashion-shows/fall-2015-ready-to-wear/celine/collection/11>
 – the oversized, sand-coloured tunics – would look out of place in the 
debauched environs of the Mos Eisley Cantina. Is it too much to suggest Darth 
Vader’s precise helmet and blacked-out eyes are quite Anna Wintour? In any 
case, the evil overlord has a brilliant way with monochrome.

Though you may not look at Jabba the Hutt’s dangerous curves and immediately 
think of fashion, it’s hardly a surprise thatStar Wars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> fascinates the industry. For one 
thing, many of today’s top creative directors are children of the late 70s and 
early 80s – so this is the haute couture equivalent of playing with 
Stormtroopers in your bedroom. Not only is it incredibly visually rich – even 
the weapons look like Tracy Emin sculptures – but its costumes are packed with 
historical references, from samurai robes to Nazi guard’s uniforms, that 
amplify its musings on good and evil. Most designers would kill to create 
collections so imbued with meaning.
