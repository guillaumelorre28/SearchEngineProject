Walking, according <http://www.flashartonline.com/article/helen-marten/> to 
Helen Marten, is nothing short of an erotic experience, “like unfolding a love 
letter; you’re stepping in and out of intimacies, the secret bits, the dirty 
parts”.

For the sculptor, who this week won the highest accolade in contemporary art – 
theTurner prize <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/turnerprize> – at the 
age of just 31, even the wares of a plumbing shop verge on the ecclesiastical.

Since she graduated from Oxford’s Ruskin school of art in 2008, the momentum 
behind Marten has been remarkable. Her labyrinthine works, connecting odd 
objects in single sculptures, reveal the reverence she has for the material 
world, and show that – in the words of the Guardian art critic Adrian Searle – 
she “thinks differently from 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/05/helen-marten-an-artist-who-thinks-differently-from-the-rest-of-us>
 the rest of us”.

This year has seen Marten rapidly elevated into the uppermost echelons of the 
art world. Following a solo show at London’s Serpentine gallery, she proceeded 
to win theinaugural Hepworth prize for sculpture 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/17/helen-marten-wins-hepworth-prize-for-sculpture>
 in November, topping it all off with the Turner prize.

Yet Marten has used the awards podium to express her disdain for the 
overprivileged, “hermetic bubble” of the industry that has just spent the year 
embracing her. Accepting the Hepworth prize, she said she felt “frankly a 
little embarrassed about it all”.

“Everyone in this room is operating in this world that is so fucking 
privileged,” shetold the audience gathered at the Tate for the Turner prize 
ceremony on Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/05/helen-marten-wins-turner-prize-2016-securing-second-big-award-in-a-month>
. “We’re afforded so much optimism and education and time to do these things, 
and this is not the global consensus.”

She has said she will split the £30,000 Hepworth prize and the £25,000 Turner 
winnings with her fellow nominees.

“There should never be a hierarchy presented in the cultural sector which says 
‘I privilege this thing over another’ because that’s not what we’re doing … 
Without sounding cynical, I really hope it [the Turner prize] won’t change my 
life and that things will continue as they are.”

Born in Macclesfield in 1985, the smaller of twin sisters, Marten was part of 
an erudite household filled with conversation and intellectual debate. Her 
father was a pharmaceuticals industry chemist and her mother was a biologist 
with a degree in psychology and a PhD in the semiotics of racism. Three years 
of her childhood were spent living in Pennsylvania before she came back to the 
UK and attended the independent King’s school in Macclesfield.

After completing an art foundation course at Central Saint Martins, Marten was 
accepted into Oxford’s Ruskin school of art, where her tutor was the 
influential artist and curatorRichard Wentworth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/11/richard-wentworth-sculptor-portrait-artist>
 – a key champion of her work after she graduated.

Wentworth remembers Marten as being part of an “energy field at Ruskin at that 
time”.

“I remember her being unbelievably hardworking,” he said. “I might sometimes 
leave very late and there she would still be, doing something nuts but getting 
away with it. Making a mould where I would go: ‘You’ll never get that off.’ And 
then I’d be on the motorway and get a text from her saying: ‘It’s out!’”

Wentworth included Marten in a group show at the Lisson Gallery in 2009 and 
wrote a piece for the Observer in 2010 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/17/marten-moth-paterson-veno-artists>
 touting her as an artist to watch. He added: “It’s very easy to support 
somebody like that. It’s not to do with working hard, it’s about being driven 
and resourceful.”

Marten herself acknowledges how deeply entrenched she is in making art. “I 
care so much that sometimes it’s really crippling,” she said recently.

The photographer Charlie Engman, who was studying at Ruskin alongside Marten, 
recalls her working so hard during her final show that she was taken to 
hospital for exhaustion.

“I do remember she would work herself very hard,” said Engman. “She was very 
driven and always seemed very clear in what she wanted to achieve and how she 
wanted to achieve it. And it’s impressive, there is a very clear through line 
between what she was making as a student and what I know of her work now.”

Having returned to Macclesfield to make work in her parents’ garage, Marten 
had her first solo show just two years after she graduated, when she was 
invited to exhibit in Naples by a gallerist who had seen her work online. Other 
international shows followed, from the Kunsthalle in Zurich to the Palais de 
Tokyo in Paris and finally her first exhibition in a UK public gallery in 2012 
at the Chisenhale.

It was this show, titled Plank Salad, that caught the attention of the art 
world.

Polly Staple, the director of the Chisenhale gallery, worked with Marten on 
the show. She said she had been struck from the off by how ambitious and 
confident Marten’s work was for such a young artist.

“I remember she came into the gallery, this tiny blond pixie, and even though 
she was nervous she was so articulate in how she was able to talk about her 
work. She had this confidence and there was already a deftness in the way she 
could handle material.”

While her work may have the initial appearance of being a hyperactive 
collection of objects and forms, coming together in a cascade of chaos, 
everything is in fact precisely made and mapped out, sometimes three or four 
months in advance. Every object is then handmade – Marten works with 
ceramicists, metalworkers, carpenters and embroiderers to create the strange 
components that form her art.

Her starting point, however, is nearly always books – a nod to her first love 
at school, English literature. Staple recalls Marten’s first studio being 
divided in two, one half workbenches and machinery and the other a library.

“Helen has a way with colliding images and language in her conversation just 
as she does in the work,” said Staple. “She has a really good sense of humour 
and a kind of playfulness and an idea of the absurd. Her very quick 
intelligence means she’s able to hold in play many different materials, forms 
and ideas, which is very skilful. It just draws you into these rabbit holes of 
detail.”

Staple said she had spoken to Marten since she had won the Turner prize but 
the pair had hardly discussed it. “The thing about Helen is she’s totally 
committed to the work,” said Staple. “Other artists ask why she’s so successful 
and it’s because she works really fucking hard. It’s non-stop and it’s not 
easy. The work doesn’t rest.”

Simon Wallis, the director of the Hepworth Wakefield, who judged both the 
Hepworth and Turner prizes, said the panels on both had been struck by “the 
amount of control that she is able to bring to bear on a vast array of 
material”.

The poetry of Marten’s work reminded him of Emily Dickinson, he said, adding: 
“It’s a lot of small, fragmented erotic experiences that are somehow stitched 
and held together, right on the edge of falling apart – and then it doesn’t.”

The emotionally provocative nature of Marten’s work is needed in art now more 
than ever, he said.

“Helen’s work is the emotional response to the age we are all living through, 
full of frustration and anger and disappointment,” he said. “You feel 
overwhelmed and yet you can be sucked in, seduced and be fascinated by those 
details – all at the same time.”

Helen Marten’s CV

Born Helen Elizabeth Marten, in 1985 in Macclesfield


Career Graduated from Ruskin school of art in 2008 and had her first solo show 
at a gallery in Naples in 2010. She exhibited work in Paris, New York and 
Berlin before her first London show in 2012. Marten’s work was then included in 
both the 2013 and 2015 Venice Biennales and she had a solo show at the 
Serpentine Sackler in 2016


High point She was awarded the inaugural Hepworth prize for sculpture and then 
the Turner prize within the space of two months, at the age of just 31

Low point Worked so hard at Ruskin during her final degree show that she 
burned herself out with exhaustion

What she says “I often worry that artists can get into this hilarious kind of 
masturbatory practice … I mean, how it can be mean-spirited or 
self-congratulatory if all the hooks, all the one-liners, the loops, are a 
contented pat on the back: hermetic”

What they say “I hate the idea of artists as rising stars, because they all 
too often turn into next year’s burnt-out asteroids. But imagine what Marten 
might do with an asteroid. Rarely have I been so struck” – Adrian Searle
