There’s no such thing as business as usual anymore. Technology is advancing at 
an ever-accelerating pace, throwing rulebooks out of windows with abandon as it 
disrupts markets left, right and centre. No business can afford to stand still.

Neither can businesses tackle the age of disruption on their own. With 
established organisations providing strengths such as expertise and established 
systems, and newer entities coming to the table with bright ideas and the 
ability to move quickly, collaboration has become the name of the game.

Old companies are teaming up with start-ups, giants are forming alliances with 
minnows, and companies are reaching out across disciplines to tap into what the 
other has to offer.

“Every sensible CEO realises they have to collaborate if they are going to 
thrive into the future,” says Professor David Wilkinson, Deputy Vice-Chancellor 
(Corporate Engagement and Advancement) at Macquarie University.


Here are three examples of alliances, and platforms for collaboration, that 
are taking disruption by the horns and running with it.

Macquarie Park Innovation District

“Everybody knows what a business park is: it’s a big piece of land with lots 
of businesses in it, all working within their own walls,” Professor Wilkinson 
says. “What we’re doing is working to create a true innovation district, which 
requires extensive collaboration and networking.”

Macquarie Park is already home to almost 400 businesses, a teaching hospital, 
a university and more than 85,000 employees and students. In a partnership 
between Macquarie University and several big names in business - Optus, Johnson 
& Johnson, Abbott, KonicaMinolta, NAB and AMP Capital - the business park is 
being transformed into the Macquarie Park Innovation District, a place where 
collaboration and innovation will be part of the fabric.

Rather than working in isolation, researchers, entrepreneurs and established 
businesses will come together through initiatives such as hackathons, flexible 
start-up spaces, incubator programs, educational programs and link-ups with 
international innovation districts.

“Many of these companies are very conscious of being disrupted externally and 
are working hard on internal entrepreneurship and how they can build out their 
business to grow and develop in the future,” Professor Wilkinson says. “They 
know collaboration is essential.”

But you need to do more than just make collaboration possible, Professor 
Wilkinson says. You need to make it happen.

“You can’t just expect people to seek each other out. I’ve travelled all over 
the world to look at the best places that do this is and it’s very clear that 
it works really well where you have deliberate, organised programming of 
collaborative activity.

“It creates conversations, poses problems, brings groups together to try to 
solve problems, and all sorts of interesting things happen.”

Stone & Chalk and CUA

Fintech - technology for the financial services industry - is a big deal. 
Which may explain why the Sydney-based not-for-profit fintech start-up hub, 
Stone & Chalk, has 23 corporate partners (including Optus, Westpac and 
Woolworths). In its first 12 months the startups at Stone & Chalk independently 
raised more than $100 million in direct investments.

“There is something magical about seeing the massive impact that new ideas 
from small start-ups can have to big companies, and seeing how big companies 
can unlock success for start-ups,” says Stone & Chalk CEO Alex Scandurra

“Large organisations have a wealth of assets, including geographic footprint, 
customer base, data and internal expertise. And start-ups have creativity, 
innovation, and incredible speed.

“This is not a battle between big and small, but rather a question of how can 
we bring together the best of big and small here in Australia to disrupt 
markets overseas.

“This is what collaboration is really about, it’s about our future economic 
and social survival.”

One of Stone & Chalk’s corporate partners, Credit Union Australia (CUA), has 
already seen the benefits of their collaboration, says Melissa Witheriff, 
Senior Manager, Digital Service Solutions & Innovation for CUA.“We’re using the 
start-up community as a vehicle to access more innovative thinking,” Witheriff 
says. “We’ve already implemented one solution through Stone & Chalk.

“The momentum in fintech is extraordinary. I can’t believe what an exciting 
space it is to be in. Start-ups have forced us to lift our game in terms of 
providing enhanced products and services for our members. It’s good for the 
financial industry and the country.”

Sendle and Virgin Velocity

While Stone & Chalk and the Macquarie Park Innovation District provide 
platforms for collaboration, a partnership between Sendle and Virgin Velocity 
is an example of how two very different companies can simply get together of 
their own accord to form a mutually beneficial alliance.

When small business owners send a package through the parcel delivery service, 
Sendle, they not only save time and money compared to doing the same thing 
through Australia Post, Sendle says, but they can sleep easy in the knowledge 
that the delivery has been carbon offset.

Since February this year Sendle customers have also earned Virgin Velocity 
frequent flyer points. The partnership between the two companies is based on 
shared values, says Jeroen van Son, General Manager, Commercial Partnerships, 
Business Development & Financial Services, Velocity Frequent Flyer.

“Both Sendle and Velocity are customer-centric businesses,” van Son says. 
“Velocity Frequent Flyer is proud to support innovative businesses who 
challenge the status quo.”

For Sendle founder and CEO James Chin Moody, partnerships with larger 
organisations are an important part of his business. As well as its Velocity 
collaboration, Sendle has teamed up with the NRMA and NAB, whose small business 
customers get discounts on Sendle services.

“This is definitely the new mode of operating,” Chin Moody says, “where 
companies come together to create value for their customers.”

Chin Moody hopes Sendle’s relationship with Velocity will evolve.

“One of our greatest advantages is we’re a software company doing logistics, 
as opposed to a logistics company coming to terms with software. We’ve had 
conversations with Velocity and we’re sharing knowledge about everything from 
application programming interfaces to what sort of services we could offer in 
the future.”

Despite the differences between the two companies, the relationship has been 
smooth, Chin Moody says.

“Velocity is a lot bigger than us. We try to ensure we can give them what they 
need and they give us what we need. So far that experience has been really 
positive. The Virgin culture is very can-do. It’s similar to our culture, and 
at the end of the day that’s what you look for in a partnership.”

Making time for change

Collaborations aren’t always plain sailing, Professor Wilkinson says.


“If a company buys a start-up or collaborates with a smaller company, the 
culture is very different, the business practices are very different, the speed 
at which they can move might be very different,” he says.

“A cultural mismatch is one of the challenges, and actively managing the 
interface between two organisations, that’s where the work needs to be done.”

However, in this age of disruption, dedicating time to establish and nurture 
collaborations is likely to be worth the effort, Professor Wilkinson says.

“It’s about changing entrenched behaviour and habits. Everybody’s busy, 
everybody’s got a schedule, there’s business as usual to be addressed. But you 
have to build into your schedule the space and time to do this. That’s the 
challenge.”
