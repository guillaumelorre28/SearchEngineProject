Raf Simons has been named as the chief creative officer of Calvin Klein. This 
appointment was widely expected in fashion, followingthe announcement in June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/19/all-change-at-calvin-klein> 
that Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli, women’s and menswear creative 
directors respectively, would be leaving the brand. Simons – who left Christian 
Dior in October - will work across both men’s and womenswear for Calvin Klein.

The announcement was made on social media – with a black and white image of 
Simons appearing onInstagram 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BIm9-Hahz1g/?taken-by=calvinklein&hl=en> on 
Tuesday afternoon. The caption said he would be “chief creative officer of the 
brand, effective immediately” with his first collection for Calvin Klein for 
autumn/winter 2017, to be shown in September in New York. It looks like Simons 
will be very much in an overseeing role, to be supported by Pieter Mulier, his 
studio manager at Dior, who will now be creative director at Calvin Klein.

The brand’s statement stressed that Simons would manage a wider strategy “to 
unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision’’. It now comprises 
around 25 product categories, with underwear and jeans brought back into the 
business in 2013. Steve Shiffman, CEO of Calvin Klein, was keen to emphasise 
the designer’s role of looking at the big picture, and to bring comparisons 
between Simons and Klein himself. “Not since Mr Klein, himself, was at the 
company has it been led by one creative visionary, and I am confident that this 
decision will drive the Calvin Klein brand and have a significant impact on its 
future,” he said. “Under his direction, Calvin Klein will further solidify its 
position as a leading global lifestyle brand.”

Simons’ workload will increase accordingly. This is the element that may 
surprise industry insiders. Simons, when leaving Dior, expresseda yearning for 
a better work-life balance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/01/fashion-world-pressure-top-designers>
. In a statement, he said his decision was “based entirely and equally on my 
desire to focus on other interests in my life, including my own brand, and the 
passions that drive me outside my work”. His own line is likely to continue (it 
did during his tenure at Dior) but those passions may take a hit with this new 
gig. The stewardship of a truly global brand – showing in New York, and based 
in Amsterdam with ambitions to reach worth of $10bn – was clearly a hard offer 
to pass up.

Simons’ combination of futurism, heritage, arty cool and sleek, elegant lines 
make him a natural fit for Calvin Klein – one that has been greeted with 
excitement by fashion insiders. Similar territory is part of the Calvin Klein 
DNA, especially during its 90s heyday, when shift dresses designed by Klein 
were worn by former employee Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and adverts for perfume 
like Obsession featuring a nakedKate Moss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss>, scandalised the general 
public. Other ads, with Mark Wahlberg and Moss wearing the underpants with 
branding on the waistband in 1991, are now infamous.

The label was founded by Klein in 1968. His was the first designer brand to 
make jeans. Launching in 1978, the company had sold $70m (£48.6m) worth of 
women’s jeans a year later. Klein sold his company to Phillips-Van Heusen 
(which owns Tommy Hilfiger) for $400m (around £300m) in cash, and more in 
stocks and royalties over the 15 years following the deal. Costa and Zucchelli, 
handpicked by Klein, have held the creative reins since.

Dior announced in July that Valentino’s Maria Grazia Chiuri would be Simon’s 
replacement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/07/maria-grazia-chiuri-exits-valentino>
. This was after speculation that designers, including Sarah Burton of 
Alexander McQueen and Christopher Kane, were up for the role. Chiuri will be 
the first woman to design for Dior in its 59 years. Judging by her work with 
co-designer Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino, where she has been creative 
director since 2008, she would bring a different, more romantic view to the 
house.
