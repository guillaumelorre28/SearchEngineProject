Robert Rauschenberg 
Tate Modern, London

It is the season of goodwill, and the great American artist Robert 
Rauschenberg was generous in every sense, from the richness of his works to his 
engaged involvement in politics and philanthropy. He also happened to be a 
genius. In the 1950s, Rauschenberg took painting off the wall to create 
free-flowing assemblages of stuff that exist between art and life and tell an 
epic history of the US. In the 1960s, he mourned JFK and celebrated the space 
race in eerie, whitewashed silkscreen collages. Whatever he did, he did it with 
a big, bold imagination that should make this a top art present to yourself.

Beyond Caravaggio
National Gallery, London

There are Christmas cards galore in this rich and absorbing journey through 
17th-century art, made under the influence of the incendiary genius 
Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. The glowing candlelit paintings of 
Caravaggio’s Dutch followers are particularly heartwarming. Orazio 
Gentileschi’s Rest On the Flight Into Egypt is a lovely relocation of the 
Christmas story to the Italian countryside, while fleshy, all-too-human angels 
flit through the show. Best of all are the works of Caravaggio himself, which 
startle, shock and scintillate the soul. Whatever your beliefs, this is one 
Christmas mass you should attend. Gloria in excelsis.

Joan Eardley
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh

This humane postwar artist portrayed Glasgow street children in paintings that 
combine tough accuracy with a lyrical warmth. She got close to the children and 
painted their lives with raw honesty. As well as the kids of Glasgow’s Townhead 
area, she also loved to paint in the fishing village of Catterline near 
Aberdeen, where she owned a basic cottage until her death in 1963 at the age of 
just 42. Eardley’s art spans the urban and rural faces of Scotland and is a 
powerful, unvarnished history of both.

Andy Warhol
The Whitworth, Manchester

Very few modern artists have taken a big interest in Christmas, but Andy 
Warhol loved to draw Christmas cards and give gifts. He was also a closet 
Christian who worked secretly in soup kitchens. This, then, is a good time of 
year to see works by Warhol from the superb Artist Rooms national collection. 
His bleak and cool facade is no longer fooling anyone. Warhol was a standup 
guy, a moral artist hiding behind the glitter of the Factory to observe and 
record the beauty and sadness of modern life. The NYPD choir are singing I’ll 
Be Your Mirror while Andy serves the soup.

Angela Harding
Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield

As winter chills and clarifies the landscape, it’s a good time to walk the 
hills of Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Along with its permanent collection of works 
by Henry Moore, James Turrell and more, it has an exhibition over Christmas of 
rustic art by Angela Harding that glories in the passing seasons of the British 
countryside. Hares leap, foxes hunt and birds hide in the hedges in Harding’s 
block prints, which give nature a robustly drawn, iconic intensity. Her images 
preserve a British tradition of natural emblems that evokes Georgian engraver 
and naturalist Thomas Bewick.
