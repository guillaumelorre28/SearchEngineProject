That’s about all from me, and from this year’s Tour de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance>. There have been numerous 
stage winners, cult heroes, unsung superstars, but only one outright winner.

Chris Froome <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> has taken a 
third Tour, another achieved through the phenomenal strength of his team, but 
crowned with individual moments of drama and determination, demonstrating a 
will to win that runs as deep as Team Sky’s resources.

Froome has run up mountains, bled through his yellow jersey, borrowed bikes 
and gone for broke to squeeze every second out of the road to Paris. His place 
in the pantheon of Tour legends, and Britain’s all-time greatest athletes, is 
assured.

Thanks for joining me today, for following our coverage throughout July, and 
for all your emails and tweets that have propelled us along many a gruelling 
stage. Let’s do it all again next year.Au revoir!

Chris Froome takes to the podium and is zipped into the yellow jersey he’s 
worn since 9th July, and is joined by second-placed Romain Bardet and Nairo 
Quintana, who finishes third.

Froome’s speech thanks his team – “I wouldn’t be standing here if it wasn’t 
for your commitment and sacrifice. This is a special team” and dedicates the 
victory to his baby son, Kellen. He also takes time to again pay tribute to the 
victims of Nice, in a speech that goes beyond the usual post-race platitudes.

Froome says tragedies like Nice “put sport into perspective, but show how 
important the values of sport are.” He concludes “vive le Tour, et vive la 
France”.

The presentations are under way on the Champs-Élysées. Adam Yates has won the 
white jersey – and he’ll be eligible to defend it next year. Rafal Majka takes 
the polka-dot jersey, and fellow Tinkoff man Peter Sagan bags his fifth green 
jersey in a row, as well as the ‘super combative’ award. Exceptional athletes, 
all of them.

Chris Froome <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> will be heading 
to Rio next month, but has already confirmed that he’ll take part in next 
weekend’s RideLondon event on home soil. Nicolas Portal, the impossibly 
youthful Team Sky director, has just hinted thatFroome could take part in the 
Vuelta a España, which begins on 20th August. Try and keep him off that bike...

Geraint Thomas, always good for a soundbite or two, is interviewed on ITV: 

“The strength of the team has been phenomenal. We had five climbers, all of us 
has led races individually, to support Froomey. No egos, committing to each 
other … and it all paid off.”

Asked about complaints over Team Sky’s domination, he adds “if they pay me to 
entertain, I’ll entertain. They pay me to win.”

Here’s something from William Fotheringham on why Chris Froome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> and Team Sky deserve respect, 
even if they occasionally fail to quicken the pulse:

Chris Froome deserves respect for Tour de France victory that puts him among 
greats | William Fotheringham

Here’s André Greipel on his stage win today:

“I cannot describe it. I’m just super proud how it worked out, and how the 
team believed in me. The team kept trying, trying, trying even though it wasn’t 
working. Once we hit the front, we were one guy too short, but I chose the 
wheel of Kristoff, which was the best place to be.”

CHRIS FROOME WINS THE 2016 TOUR DE FRANCE!
 Overall leader and yellow jersey, Chris Froome, crosses the finish line with 
his team-mates to win the race. Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images 
A second title in succession, and a third overall for the mighty Chris Froome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome>, who crosses the line 
alongside his Team Sky lieutenants. A Tour victory that was often dominant, 
occasionally dramatic, and overall, entirely deserved.

André Greipel wins stage 21 on the Champs Élysées!

A second win in Paris for Greipel, and he maintains his record of winning at 
least one stage in every Tour. The German beat Kristoff with raw power, and 
although Sagan made a late burst, it was a fraction too late.
 Andre Greipel, right, beats Peter Sagan to win the final stage in Paris.

One lap to go! Chris Froome <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> 
is still looking relaxed, as Lutsenko and van Avermaet are reeled in. A sprint 
finish, but who will it be? In true Eurosport style, I’ll name everyone with a 
half-decent chance before making my prediction. Sagan? Kittel? Greipel? 
Kristoff?Coquard.

Kittel is still 40 seconds adrift, riding in the slipstreams of several team 
cars to get back in touch. His Etixx team-mates are slowing down, so he should 
make it back. Despite winning a stage, Kittel has had a disappointing Tour – as 
has this man:
 Nairo Quintana, not Barry. Facebook

Marcel Kittel is in trouble, suffering a mechanical and getting left behind by 
the peloton. He gets a spare bike, but doesn’t like the replacement wheel, 
lobbing it down the cobbles. Now then, Marcel.

In other bad news for Etixx QuickStep, Tony Martin had to pull out because of 
an injured knee; he came home last yesterday, and struggled through pain today.

This group are holding onto a 19-second lead, but there’s a long old way to go 
– 40km, and six circuits, to be precise. Some surprising news – Etixx rider 
Tony Martin has pulled out during today’s stage. No word on whether it’s an 
injury, or he had a plane to catch to Rio.

Here are some more Tour highlights, this time from Paul Gallagher:

Best team: Sky, obviously. But if not them then Dimension Data. Four wins for 
Mark Cavendish, but a massive victory for Steve Cummings also (which netted him 
a last minute Rio Olympics call up after he was outrageously overlooked...). 
Most disappointing team: Cannondale, by far.

Riders of note: Julian Alaphilippe for his youthful tenacity, Adam Yates for 
putting up with some unfair jury decisions but still almost making the podium, 
and Rafal Majka with his impressively combative performance to take a 
stranglehold on the polka dots. And Wout Poels, the riderChris Froome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> owes so much to this time 
around.

Rider of note for a different reason: Bora-Argon 18 rider Shane Archbold who 
finished Stage 17 after crashing at 67 km/hr and breaking his pelvis. The New 
Zealander’s words when asked if he could go on? “Give me the f***king bike.” A 
brave subplot in a Tour full of them - the TdF website hasn’t even listed him 
as a withdrawal.

Team Sky allow Joaquin Rodriguez, the climbing legend retiring after the Tour 
to lead the pack onto the Champs-Élysées. Froome can’t help but smile as he’s 
greeted by the crowds, who have certainly warmed to him this year.

Team Sky take up the reins in the peloton as the race skirts the Arc de 
Triomphe for the first time. The riders head back along the Seine, before 
dropping onto the final circuit, which they will navigate eight times.

“Just finishing the Tour is a major accomplishment in my book” says Jeannine 
Fleegle. “Look at how many others have not. I marvel at all the finishers, not 
just the ones on the podium. Bravo Sam Bennett!”

Indeed, you’ll find plenty of names at the foot of the GC who have played a 
big part – Dimension Data’s Bernie Eisel, Team Sky stalwart Ian Stannard, and 
sprinters Dan McLay and Marcel Kittel.

Interesting move from André Greipel, who appears to have switched bikes, 
climbing aboard a model better suited for the cobbled finish. The Gorilla 
hasn’t won a stage this year – he’s won a stage in every Tour he’s taken part 
in previously. The pack are now passing through the Bois de Boulogne, before 
crossing into the city centre.

Another old stager, Direct Energie’s Sylvain Chavanel, is enjoying a turn at 
the front of the pack as the crowds swell on the way into central Paris.

We won’t see any breakaways today, but once again, they’ve provided a whole 
host of Tour highlights. L’Equipe have worked out the men who covered the most 
kilometres clear of the pack, and they are:Rafal Majka, Thomas de Gendt and 
Jarlinson Pantano. No real surprises there.

France, up in the northwestern suburbs, heading towards the Bois de Boulogne. 
There’s been an electrifying forty-man breakaway the pack are still glued 
together.

With 80km to go, we crest the final climb of the year – the entirely pointless 
Cat 4 hill, Côte de l’Ermitage. Roman Kreuziger takes the point on offer.

“I would appreciate a mention for Haimar Zubeldia of Trek Segafredo” asks 
Richard Searle. “This is his 15thTour de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> at the age of 39 and he has 
consistently ridden well, but barely gets a mention. Chapeau Haimar”

The Basque rider is the quintessential under-the-radar Tour hero – he’s going 
to finish 24th this year, but has made the top 10 five times, coming fourth in 
2007, despite never winning a stage.

On unsung heroes, Mark Wilkinson nominates “Michael Morkov, firstly for 
battling through eight days with some horrible injuries after Stage 1 crash. 
But also, after struggling to the summit of Col d’Aspin with the broom wagon 
right behind him, still finding time to hand water bottle to young fan stood 
next to me decked out in full Katusha kit. Class act.”

The gallant Morkov was the first rider to retire from this year’s race, which 
was a new record – and we’ll see a record number of finishers in Paris this 
year.

We’re passing through the village of Montlignon, approaching the suburbs of 
Paris. A few Tinkoff riders are freewheeling out in front, gurning at the 
cameras. This is such a weird way to end the race; like having a mandatory 
kickabout in Gorky Park after the next World Cup final.

Re: weirdest moments of the Tour, how about this? And just how well would Adam 
Yates have done, if he’d had any luck whatsoever?

A nice pick from Matt Cast for unsung hero of 2016:

Another unsung hero is Mikaël Chérel, Bardet’s teammate who bravely attacked 
first on that treacherous descent on Friday. Bardet then picked up his wheel 
and Cherel’s work was a big factor in Bardet’s stage win and 2nd place overall.

I’d like to put forward Sam Bennett, the Irish rider set to ‘win’ this year’s 
lanterne rouge, the last man in the general classification. It’s an award 
nobody wants, but Bennett, a sprinter who suffered painful injurieson the first 
day, should take huge pride in finishing the race.

95km to go, and still a good 40km before we hit the Champs-Élysées. Movistar 
may have fallen short in the GC but will take the team victory. It’s their 
second in a row, the first team to defend their crown since 2006. Perhaps cold 
comfort for the team that were once Banesto, on the day Chris Froome becomes 
the first man since Miguel Indurain to defend the yellow jersey (yes, yes

Around 100km to go, with Froome enjoying a glass of champagne. Don’t mix your 
drinks, Chris. A couple more of your excellent highlights – keep them coming.
Paul Treloar (@PaulieTandoori) 
@niallmcveigh <https://twitter.com/niallmcveigh> that descent from Froome set 
the scene for me, proper heart-in-mouth stuff. And Cav's renaissance for four 
wins was lovely.

Here’s Katherine Pearson:

While Froome and his team were masterful, the excitement came from the 
sprinters, with elation, heartbreak and tactics on display. Of course I’ve long 
thought there should be another name for cyclists who spend over hours on a 
bike at high cadences, only to then “sprint” at even greater speeds to take the 
stage itself.

If the GC race was a little lukewarm, there have been some phenomenal sprint 
battles, with two photo finishes early on. It makes Cavendish’s comeback to 
take four wins all the more impressive, but it would be nice to see Bryan 
Coquard and Alex Kristoff, two sprinters who have done little wrong all Tour, 
take the stage today.

Christian Prudhomme drops the starting flag for the final time this year, and 
thelast stage is officially on! This leads to a further 2.5% surge in intensity.

More highlights, from Martin Alderton:

Joint gold medals: Jarlinson Pantano for showing us you can enjoy this race 
and Julian Alaphilippe for showing us how much winning a stage of this would 
actually mean to him.

Celebration of the year: Cav’s four fingers. Need I say more.

Man of the year: Dan Martin. Didn’t know when to give up. And he gave it a go, 
unlike some I could mention.

Team of the year: I would have said Astana but Aru’s legs let them down. So 
it’s got to be Sky, an impressive, if slightly dull, control of the race.

Sagan-Froome breakaway:

over, then glancing over again as he realised it was Froome who had gone with 
him.

If you haven’t seen it, please enjoy below:

Zack Gomperts-Michelson also nominates that moment, plus “two superb examples 
of time triallists breaking this year, one from Cummins and one from Tom 
Dumoulin. Both made powerful moves away from their groups and simply crushed 
the spirit of their chasers with consistent power. Awesome”

We’re back on tarmac on the way out of Chantilly, leading to a 2% increase in 
intensity. Team Sky have flash new kits for the day, with yellow stripes and 
handlebars, and are riding along, chests puffed out, at the back with Froome. 
They’re posing for photos in a line, arm-in-arm, and for a team that have just 
dominated a Grand Tour, find it surprisingly difficult.

Meanwhile in Paris, La Course finished on the Champs-Élysées earlier today, 
with Australia’s Chloe Hosking winning in a sprint finish after a flurry of 
late crashes.

Some more of your highlights, starting with Mark Turner:

Gold medal: Froome. He won, triple champion, don’t overlook the champ. 

Silver medal: Cav. The Merckx record in real danger is a modern sporting 
miracle.

Bronze medal: Yates. Very impressive breakthrough year, Nairo has two years 
max to get his tour before this name starts to dominate cycling.

Honourable mention to Bauke Mollema.

Only gripe this year, not enough hilltop arrivées. Nairo probably agrees.

Agree with all of that – and this from Rees Arnott-Davies:

First on the list has to be Jarlinson Pantano. He’s ridden out of his skin, 
cut an attractive figure off the front, and generally done everything humanly 
possible to fight for wins.
 Jarlinson Pantano and Julian Alaphilippe – two of this year’s cult heroes.

The top three on the GC are now riding together, with Romain Bardet and Nairo 
Quintana offering Froome a congratulatory handshake. Here’s a few of your 2016 
highlights:

but the highlight will be of Froome running up Ventoux. How could it not be? 
Madness.

The race has begun in Chantilly, albeit in an early, neutralised phase around 
the Chateau de Chantilly. These cobbled roads hosted the start of the 
Paris-Roubaix race for 10 years, between 1966 and 1976. Jersey winnersFroome, 
Peter Sagan, Rafal Majka and Adam Yates ride out in front.

An interesting development that has an impact on cycling, if not today’s race. 
The IOC have opted against a blanket ban for Russian athletes, leaving it to 
each sport’s governing body to make a decision on whether Russians can compete 
at the Olympics:

Earlier, UCI president Brian Cookson was speaking to Sky Sports, and seemed to 
suggest that he was not in favour of a blanket ban affecting athletes in sports 
not connected to the ongoing scandal; it’ll be interesting to see what action 
the UCI takes. There is only one Russian rider in this year’s Tour; Katusha’s 
Ilnur Zakarin, who won stage 17.

On what promises to be a pretty quiet race day, I’d like your nominations for 
2016 Tour heroes. Some might say Mark Cavendish, Peter Sagan... William 
Fotheringham would say Thomas, Pouls, Landa.Stannard.

So, today’s stage is a short hop from Chantilly, last seen hosting England’s 
Euro 2016 heroes, into the centre of Paris, before nine turns around the 
Champs-Élysées and a big old bunch sprint to bring the curtain down on this 
year’s Tour.

Preamble

Hello. The 2016 Tour may not have been an all-time classic, but it’s been 
gripping from the get-go, throwing constant curveballs at those who would dare 
to call it predictable. From Mark Cavendish’s resurgence toAdam Yates’s 
emergence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/24/cycling-club-modern-hero-adam-yates>
, via cross winds andchaos on Mont Ventoux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/14/chris-froome-mont-ventoux-tour-de-france-2016>
, this year has reminded us to always expect the unexpected.

Chris Froome will win a third Tour de France today, surrounded by a team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/23/team-sky-tour-de-france-dominance-chris-froome>
 whose dominance may disappoint the casual viewer. Yet it’s Froome who embodies 
that maxim more than anyone this year, carving out an unassailable lead in a 
series of dramatic vignettes:breaking away on a descent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/09/chris-froome-higher-gear-yellow-jersey-tour-de-france>
, borrowing bikes, running up hills, andsprinting with Peter Sagan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/13/peter-sagan-wins-tour-de-france-stage-11-chris-froome-break>
.

All of which brings us to today, where Froome, over four minutes clear of 
Romain Bardet in the general classification, will not face a contest for the 
title, rolling into Paris with a glass of champagne in his hand. It’s a Tour 
tradition, but still feels like a dull denouement after the twists and turns of 
what may be sport’s finest stand-alone race.

There will be a burst of intensity 500m from home, as the remaining sprinters 
battle to cycling’s most prestigious finish line. Until then, your nominations 
for highlights of the 2016 Tour, and what would make a more fitting conclusion, 
are more than welcome.

close  
That’s about all from me, and from this year’s Tour de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance>. There have been numerous 
stage winners, cult heroes, unsung superstars, but only one outright winner.

Chris Froome <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> has taken a 
third Tour, another achieved through the phenomenal strength of his team, but 
crowned with individual moments of drama and determination, demonstrating a 
will to win that runs as deep as Team Sky’s resources.

Froome has run up mountains, bled through his yellow jersey, borrowed bikes 
and gone for broke to squeeze every second out of the road to Paris. His place 
in the pantheon of Tour legends, and Britain’s all-time greatest athletes, is 
assured.

Thanks for joining me today, for following our coverage throughout July, and 
for all your emails and tweets that have propelled us along many a gruelling 
stage. Let’s do it all again next year.Au revoir!
 
Chris Froome takes to the podium and is zipped into the yellow jersey he’s 
worn since 9th July, and is joined by second-placed Romain Bardet and Nairo 
Quintana, who finishes third.

Froome’s speech thanks his team – “I wouldn’t be standing here if it wasn’t 
for your commitment and sacrifice. This is a special team” and dedicates the 
victory to his baby son, Kellen. He also takes time to again pay tribute to the 
victims of Nice, in a speech that goes beyond the usual post-race platitudes.

Froome says tragedies like Nice “put sport into perspective, but show how 
important the values of sport are.” He concludes “vive le Tour, et vive la 
France”.
 
The presentations are under way on the Champs-Élysées. Adam Yates has won the 
white jersey – and he’ll be eligible to defend it next year. Rafal Majka takes 
the polka-dot jersey, and fellow Tinkoff man Peter Sagan bags his fifth green 
jersey in a row, as well as the ‘super combative’ award. Exceptional athletes, 
all of them.

Chris Froome <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> will be heading 
to Rio next month, but has already confirmed that he’ll take part in next 
weekend’s RideLondon event on home soil. Nicolas Portal, the impossibly 
youthful Team Sky director, has just hinted thatFroome could take part in the 
Vuelta a España, which begins on 20th August. Try and keep him off that bike...

Geraint Thomas, always good for a soundbite or two, is interviewed on ITV: 

“The strength of the team has been phenomenal. We had five climbers, all of us 
has led races individually, to support Froomey. No egos, committing to each 
other … and it all paid off.”

Asked about complaints over Team Sky’s domination, he adds “if they pay me to 
entertain, I’ll entertain. They pay me to win.”

Here’s something from William Fotheringham on why Chris Froome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> and Team Sky deserve respect, 
even if they occasionally fail to quicken the pulse:

Here’s André Greipel on his stage win today:

“I cannot describe it. I’m just super proud how it worked out, and how the 
team believed in me. The team kept trying, trying, trying even though it wasn’t 
working. Once we hit the front, we were one guy too short, but I chose the 
wheel of Kristoff, which was the best place to be.”

Froome joins Greg LeMond, Philippe Thys and Louison Bobet on a hat-trick of 
Tour de France <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> wins, and is 
two wins behind the quartet of legends together on five victories: Jacques 
Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain. Who would bet 
against him making it four next year?

Here’s our André Greipel-fast race report:

A second title in succession, and a third overall for the mighty Chris Froome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome>, who crosses the line 
alongside his Team Sky lieutenants. A Tour victory that was often dominant, 
occasionally dramatic, and overall, entirely deserved.
 
A second win in Paris for Greipel, and he maintains his record of winning at 
least one stage in every Tour. The German beat Kristoff with raw power, and 
although Sagan made a late burst, it was a fraction too late.
 Andre Greipel, right, beats Peter Sagan to win the final stage in Paris.

500m: Lotto are running out of numbers, Kristoff is in contention, and Greipel 
has to hang onto his wheel, with Sagan in pursuit...
 
1km to go: Lotto-Soudal appear to have paced this right, after a Tour of false 
starts for André Greipel... but Sagan, Kittel and Boasson Hagen are all in 
range...
 
2km to go: Lotto-Soudal, Cannondale and Cofidis are all well placed as they 
enter the tunnel, with the peloton shredded by that burst of pace...
 
An IAM rider goes down, but picks himself up, with no other riders affected. 
The pace is really ratcheting up, and there’s another crash! Gaps are opening 
up – and Bryan Coquard has taken a tumble! There goes my prediction...
 
5km to go! The peloton are stretched on the uphill stretch of the 
Champs-Élysées, approaching the Arc de Triomphe. Vincenzo Nibali attempts a 
late surge, but the sprint trains at the front aren’t having a bar of it.
 
One lap to go! Chris Froome <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> 
is still looking relaxed, as Lutsenko and van Avermaet are reeled in. A sprint 
finish, but who will it be? In true Eurosport style, I’ll name everyone with a 
half-decent chance before making my prediction. Sagan? Kittel? Greipel? 
Kristoff?Coquard.
 
Bryan Coquard’s Direct Énergie team are controlling the pace of the peloton, 
with Lotto-Soudal conspicuous by their absence. Kittel is very much back in 
contenetion, as Van Avermaet and Lutsenko work together to open up a small gap 
with10km to go...

Two more laps to go, and the breakaway is swallowed up. Astana’s Alexey 
Lutsenko and former yellow jersey winner Greg van Avermaet move clear, bumping 
over cobbles while the smart men in the peloton ride in the gutter.
 
With 15km to go, Teklahaimanot moves ahead of Gougeard, Craddock, Roy, Barta,

Dan Martin, who was dropped after suffering a mechanical problem. Not a great 
day for Etixx QuickStep.

There are crashes, and then there are crashes; Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, aka 
the Tashkent Express, won three green jerseys and two Champs-Élysées finishes, 
but perhaps his most famous moment is this 1991 collision with an outsized 
promotional Coke can:
 
“Let’s do one last name the breakaway before this glorious irrelevance is over 
for another year” says Paul Griffin. Why not, Paul.
“Craddock, Teklehaimanot, Roy, Barta, Costa, Feillu: the roll call at the 
beginning of Trumpton, for Moldovan audiences.”
 
The breakaway, still just 20 seconds ahead, are down to six after Burghardt 
has problems with his gears and is forced to drop back:Gougeard, Craddock, 
Teklehaimanot, Roy, Barta, Costa, Feillu.
 
Kittel is still 40 seconds adrift, riding in the slipstreams of several team 
cars to get back in touch. His Etixx team-mates are slowing down, so he should 
make it back. Despite winning a stage, Kittel has had a disappointing Tour – as 
has this man:
 Nairo Quintana, not Barry.  
Marcel Kittel is in trouble, suffering a mechanical and getting left behind by 
the peloton. He gets a spare bike, but doesn’t like the replacement wheel, 
lobbing it down the cobbles. Now then, Marcel.

In other bad news for Etixx QuickStep, Tony Martin had to pull out because of 
an injured knee; he came home last yesterday, and struggled through pain today.
 
Burghardt takes maximum points at the final intermediate sprint, officially 
ending the points competition. Peter Sagan was sewn into the green jersey about 
two weeks ago.
 
This group are holding onto a 19-second lead, but there’s a long old way to go 
– 40km, and six circuits, to be precise. Some surprising news – Etixx rider 
Tony Martin has pulled out during today’s stage. No word on whether it’s an 
injury, or he had a plane to catch to Rio.
 
Here’s Shane ‘Give Me The Effing Bike’ Archbold with Bora-Argon team-mate and 
lanterne rouge Sam Bennett. The bromance is strong with these two.
 
Here are some more Tour highlights, this time from Paul Gallagher:

Best team: Sky, obviously. But if not them then Dimension Data. Four wins for 
Mark Cavendish, but a massive victory for Steve Cummings also (which netted him 
a last minute Rio Olympics call up after he was outrageously overlooked...). 
Most disappointing team: Cannondale, by far.

Riders of note: Julian Alaphilippe for his youthful tenacity, Adam Yates for 
putting up with some unfair jury decisions but still almost making the podium, 
and Rafal Majka with his impressively combative performance to take a 
stranglehold on the polka dots. And Wout Poels, the riderChris Froome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> owes so much to this time 
around.

Rider of note for a different reason: Bora-Argon 18 rider Shane Archbold who 
finished Stage 17 after crashing at 67 km/hr and breaking his pelvis. The New 
Zealander’s words when asked if he could go on? “Give me the f***king bike.” A 
brave subplot in a Tour full of them - the TdF website hasn’t even listed him 
as a withdrawal.
 
We have a breakaway! Eight riders took advantage of the slow-paced bonhomie to 
carve out a gap of 20 seconds. They are:

Alexis Gougeard (AG2R-La Mondiale), Lawson Craddock (Cannondale-Drapac), 
Markus Burghardt (BMC), Daniel Teklehaimanot (DiData), Jérémy Roy (FDJ), Jan 
Barta (Bora), Rui Costa (Lampre-Merida) and Brice Feillu (Fortuneo-VitalConcept)
 
Team Sky allow Joaquin Rodriguez, the climbing legend retiring after the Tour 
to lead the pack onto the Champs-Élysées. Froome can’t help but smile as he’s 
greeted by the crowds, who have certainly warmed to him this year.

Benoit Tessier/Reuters 
Team Sky take up the reins in the peloton as the race skirts the Arc de 
Triomphe for the first time. The riders head back along the Seine, before 
dropping onto the final circuit, which they will navigate eight times.

“Just finishing the Tour is a major accomplishment in my book” says Jeannine 
Fleegle. “Look at how many others have not. I marvel at all the finishers, not 
just the ones on the podium. Bravo Sam Bennett!”

Indeed, you’ll find plenty of names at the foot of the GC who have played a 
big part – Dimension Data’s Bernie Eisel, Team Sky stalwart Ian Stannard, and 
sprinters Dan McLay and Marcel Kittel.
 
Interesting move from André Greipel, who appears to have switched bikes, 
climbing aboard a model better suited for the cobbled finish. The Gorilla 
hasn’t won a stage this year – he’s won a stage in every Tour he’s taken part 
in previously. The pack are now passing through the Bois de Boulogne, before 
crossing into the city centre.

Another old stager, Direct Energie’s Sylvain Chavanel, is enjoying a turn at 
the front of the pack as the crowds swell on the way into central Paris.

We won’t see any breakaways today, but once again, they’ve provided a whole 
host of Tour highlights. L’Equipe have worked out the men who covered the most 
kilometres clear of the pack, and they are:Rafal Majka, Thomas de Gendt and 
Jarlinson Pantano. No real surprises there.
 
The riders cross the Seine for the first time, over the Pont d’Argenteuil, a 
bridge made famous by Claude Monet. We’re not a million miles from the Stade de 
France, up in the northwestern suburbs, heading towards the Bois de Boulogne. 
There’s been an electrifying forty-man breakaway the pack are still glued 
together.
 
With 80km to go, we crest the final climb of the year – the entirely pointless 
Cat 4 hill, Côte de l’Ermitage. Roman Kreuziger takes the point on offer.

“I would appreciate a mention for Haimar Zubeldia of Trek Segafredo” asks 
Richard Searle. “This is his 15thTour de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> at the age of 39 and he has 
consistently ridden well, but barely gets a mention. Chapeau Haimar”

The Basque rider is the quintessential under-the-radar Tour hero – he’s going 
to finish 24th this year, but has made the top 10 five times, coming fourth in 
2007, despite never winning a stage.
 
On unsung heroes, Mark Wilkinson nominates “Michael Morkov, firstly for 
battling through eight days with some horrible injuries after Stage 1 crash. 
But also, after struggling to the summit of Col d’Aspin with the broom wagon 
right behind him, still finding time to hand water bottle to young fan stood 
next to me decked out in full Katusha kit. Class act.”

The gallant Morkov was the first rider to retire from this year’s race, which 
was a new record – and we’ll see a record number of finishers in Paris this 
year.

We’re passing through the village of Montlignon, approaching the suburbs of 
Paris. A few Tinkoff riders are freewheeling out in front, gurning at the 
cameras. This is such a weird way to end the race; like having a mandatory 
kickabout in Gorky Park after the next World Cup final.

Re: weirdest moments of the Tour, how about this? And just how well would Adam 
Yates have done, if he’d had any luck whatsoever?

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/08/adam-yates-britain-tour-de-france-inflatable-marker> 
A nice pick from Matt Cast for unsung hero of 2016:

Another unsung hero is Mikaël Chérel, Bardet’s teammate who bravely attacked 
first on that treacherous descent on Friday. Bardet then picked up his wheel 
and Cherel’s work was a big factor in Bardet’s stage win and 2nd place overall.

I’d like to put forward Sam Bennett, the Irish rider set to ‘win’ this year’s 
lanterne rouge, the last man in the general classification. It’s an award 
nobody wants, but Bennett, a sprinter who suffered painful injurieson the first 
day, should take huge pride in finishing the race.
 
95km to go, and still a good 40km before we hit the Champs-Élysées. Movistar 
may have fallen short in the GC but will take the team victory. It’s their 
second in a row, the first team to defend their crown since 2006. Perhaps cold 
comfort for the team that were once Banesto, on the day Chris Froome becomes 
the first man since Miguel Indurain to defend the yellow jersey (yes, yes

drinks, Chris. A couple more of your excellent highlights – keep them coming.
Paul Treloar (@PaulieTandoori) 
@niallmcveigh <https://twitter.com/niallmcveigh> that descent from Froome set 
the scene for me, proper heart-in-mouth stuff. And Cav's renaissance for four 
wins was lovely.

<https://twitter.com/PaulieTandoori/status/757223415010959365> 
Here’s Katherine Pearson:

While Froome and his team were masterful, the excitement came from the 
sprinters, with elation, heartbreak and tactics on display. Of course I’ve long 
thought there should be another name for cyclists who spend over hours on a 
bike at high cadences, only to then “sprint” at even greater speeds to take the 
stage itself.

If the GC race was a little lukewarm, there have been some phenomenal sprint 
battles, with two photo finishes early on. It makes Cavendish’s comeback to 
take four wins all the more impressive, but it would be nice to see Bryan 
Coquard and Alex Kristoff, two sprinters who have done little wrong all Tour, 
take the stage today.
 
Christian Prudhomme drops the starting flag for the final time this year, and 
thelast stage is officially on! This leads to a further 2.5% surge in intensity.

More highlights, from Martin Alderton:

Joint gold medals: Jarlinson Pantano for showing us you can enjoy this race 
and Julian Alaphilippe for showing us how much winning a stage of this would 
actually mean to him.

Celebration of the year: Cav’s four fingers. Need I say more.

Man of the year: Dan Martin. Didn’t know when to give up. And he gave it a go, 
unlike some I could mention.

Team of the year: I would have said Astana but Aru’s legs let them down. So 
it’s got to be Sky, an impressive, if slightly dull, control of the race.
 
A couple of shouts in your Tour highlights for stage 11, and that brilliant 
Sagan-Froome breakaway:

Zack Gomperts-Michelson also nominates that moment, plus “two superb examples 
of time triallists breaking this year, one from Cummins and one from Tom 
Dumoulin. Both made powerful moves away from their groups and simply crushed 
the spirit of their chasers with consistent power. Awesome”
 
Froome goes to the Team Sky boot and collects not champagne, but a round of

We’re back on tarmac on the way out of Chantilly, leading to a 2% increase in 
intensity. Team Sky have flash new kits for the day, with yellow stripes and 
handlebars, and are riding along, chests puffed out, at the back with Froome. 
They’re posing for photos in a line, arm-in-arm, and for a team that have just 
dominated a Grand Tour, find it surprisingly difficult.

Meanwhile in Paris, La Course finished on the Champs-Élysées earlier today, 
with Australia’s Chloe Hosking winning in a sprint finish after a flurry of 
late crashes.

Some more of your highlights, starting with Mark Turner:

Gold medal: Froome. He won, triple champion, don’t overlook the champ. 

Silver medal: Cav. The Merckx record in real danger is a modern sporting 
miracle.

Bronze medal: Yates. Very impressive breakthrough year, Nairo has two years 
max to get his tour before this name starts to dominate cycling.

Honourable mention to Bauke Mollema.

Only gripe this year, not enough hilltop arrivées. Nairo probably agrees.

Agree with all of that – and this from Rees Arnott-Davies:

First on the list has to be Jarlinson Pantano. He’s ridden out of his skin, 
cut an attractive figure off the front, and generally done everything humanly 
possible to fight for wins.

The top three on the GC are now riding together, with Romain Bardet and Nairo 
Quintana offering Froome a congratulatory handshake. Here’s a few of your 2016 
highlights:

but the highlight will be of Froome running up Ventoux. How could it not be? 
Madness.

The race has begun in Chantilly, albeit in an early, neutralised phase around 
the Chateau de Chantilly. These cobbled roads hosted the start of the 
Paris-Roubaix race for 10 years, between 1966 and 1976. Jersey winnersFroome, 
Peter Sagan, Rafal Majka and Adam Yates ride out in front.

An interesting development that has an impact on cycling, if not today’s race. 
The IOC have opted against a blanket ban for Russian athletes, leaving it to 
each sport’s governing body to make a decision on whether Russians can compete 
at the Olympics:

Earlier, UCI president Brian Cookson was speaking to Sky Sports, and seemed to 
suggest that he was not in favour of a blanket ban affecting athletes in sports 
not connected to the ongoing scandal; it’ll be interesting to see what action 
the UCI takes. There is only one Russian rider in this year’s Tour; Katusha’s 
Ilnur Zakarin, who won stage 17.
 
On what promises to be a pretty quiet race day, I’d like your nominations for 
2016 Tour heroes. Some might say Mark Cavendish, Peter Sagan... William 
Fotheringham would say Thomas, Pouls, Landa.Stannard.

So, today’s stage is a short hop from Chantilly, last seen hosting England’s 
Euro 2016 heroes, into the centre of Paris, before nine turns around the 
Champs-Élysées and a big old bunch sprint to bring the curtain down on this 
year’s Tour.

Hello. The 2016 Tour may not have been an all-time classic, but it’s been 
gripping from the get-go, throwing constant curveballs at those who would dare 
to call it predictable. From Mark Cavendish’s resurgence toAdam Yates’s 
emergence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/24/cycling-club-modern-hero-adam-yates>
, via cross winds andchaos on Mont Ventoux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/14/chris-froome-mont-ventoux-tour-de-france-2016>
, this year has reminded us to always expect the unexpected.

Chris Froome will win a third Tour de France today, surrounded by a team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/23/team-sky-tour-de-france-dominance-chris-froome>
 whose dominance may disappoint the casual viewer. Yet it’s Froome who embodies 
that maxim more than anyone this year, carving out an unassailable lead in a 
series of dramatic vignettes:breaking away on a descent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/09/chris-froome-higher-gear-yellow-jersey-tour-de-france>
, borrowing bikes, running up hills, andsprinting with Peter Sagan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/13/peter-sagan-wins-tour-de-france-stage-11-chris-froome-break>
.

All of which brings us to today, where Froome, over four minutes clear of 
Romain Bardet in the general classification, will not face a contest for the 
title, rolling into Paris with a glass of champagne in his hand. It’s a Tour 
tradition, but still feels like a dull denouement after the twists and turns of 
what may be sport’s finest stand-alone race.

There will be a burst of intensity 500m from home, as the remaining sprinters 
battle to cycling’s most prestigious finish line. Until then, your nominations 
for highlights of the 2016 Tour, and what would make a more fitting conclusion, 
are more than welcome.
