Belts and boobs. No, not a Stereophonics B-side, but two problem areas for 
fashion. First, belts. The past couple of seasons have seen designers insist on 
anything but conventional buckling, most notably the paper-bag style (Margaret 
Howell) and the rope belt (Gosha Rubchinskiy). Boobs, meanwhile, continued to 
be celebrated and going bra-less is having a moment in Kardashian-Jenner world. 
Donatella Versace has tried to fix things by creating the boob belt, which she 
showed at her Versus show. Worn as part of a futuristic-looking outfit (bodycon 
trousers, tight jacket with exaggerated sleeves), the look was very Mad Max 
Fury Road and suggested a way to re-house any chunky 80s-style belts.PE

The geometric Anya Hindmarch show was an Olympically precise dance of tightly 
choreographed winding and unwinding that resembled a synchronised swimming 
event. The models wore elegantly placed rolls of thick, white bandage tape 
around their head and neck. Some wore oversize sunglasses and the overall 
effect was that of a wannabe Hollywood starlet unveiling her new appearance 
after some career-altering face work. We’re calling it “Hervé Légering for the 
head”.PE

“Lampshading” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/09/over-the-knee-boots-set-to-be-the-shoe-of-the-decade>
 may be all the rage now (making your silhouette big at the top and smaller at 
the bottom) but next season it will be all about literally looking like a 
lampshade from the 70s. Mary Katrantzou’s pear-shaped silhouettes featured 
psychedelic prints mixed with ancient-Greek vase imagery. Add some circular 
perspex beading and you’ve got something you might fit with a 60 watt bulb at 
Timothy Leary’s Etsy store. Multi-tiered dresses (very Ikea lampshade) featured 
at Erdem, Henry Holland and Ryan LO, suggesting inspiration is now to be taken 
directly from your desk.PE

 Flower power: the Preen show at LFW S/S 2017. Photograph: Estrop/Getty Images 
Street casting and Instafame has meant that the catwalk has moved away from 
the conventional ideas of beauty into something more global. Some designers 
have even pushed that idea further, with traditionally “ugly” tropes morphing 
into something else. At Christopher Kane, he styled his models with wet-look 
mullets, and the overall effect was Frida Kahlo meets the Bloomsbury set. At 
Gareth Pugh’s dramatic and ominous show, models had liquorice strips of black 
lipstick and hair that was in between a crow and Medusa. Equally disturbing 
were the beauty elements of the occult-inspired Preen show: models wore dry 
pressed flowers on their lips (very Kate Bush), while sporting girlish plaits 
and Pentagram earrings.PE

 Rave on: Molly Goddard, LFW September 2016. Photograph: Ben A Pruchnie/Getty

When one of the stalwarts of London fashion week – Gareth Pugh – soundtracks 
his finale to Faithless’s hitInsomnia 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8JEm4d6Wu4> you know something is up. Perhaps 
in response to the closure of Fabric, fashion is pulling an all-nighter and 
going out dancing. Pugh’s collection was partly inspired by the exploits of 
tyrannical child emperor Eliogabalo (of course it was), but it also played with 
the black-and-white graphics associated with chaos theory so loved by rave 
flyers. Also on the playlist was The Prodigy, which soundtracked AV Robertson’s 
show.Molly Goddard 
<http://www.disneyrollergirl.net/molly-goddard-ss17-nick-waplington/>, 
meanwhile, turned her show into a catwalk rave, with models dancing. Of course, 
this being fashion and not Shoom, there was far less gurning.LC

 Hats on: models wear creations by Erdem at London Fashion Week, S/S 2017.

Hats in fashion don’t always have to mean outlandish creations worthy of 
Ascot. Sometimes, a bit of DIY mixed with anarchic dress-up goes a long way. See
Marta Jakubowski 
<http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/gallery/22722/16/marta-jakubowski-ss17>, 
who re-worked coloured net into bags worn over heads, or face masks that looked 
like the ones worn by bank robbers at Gareth Pugh.Christopher Kane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/christopher-kane> had distressed leather 
hats by Stephen Jones, while Erdem’s were a bit like the one worn by Robinson 
Crusoe, though probably not made of the scraps found on a fictional desert 
island. The takeaway? SS17 is a very selfie-friendly season.LC

Goth is enjoying something of a moment right now – largely thanks to Vetements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vetements> designer Demna Gvasalia and his 
penchant for an old Sisters of Mercy T-shirt, and the use of gothic script on 
hoodies.Preen 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-ready-to-wear/preen-by-thornton-bregazzi/slideshow/collection#37>
 took this to the next level with its collection, which featured a whole lot of 
black, stompy boots and lace. There was also that goth favourite – the 
pentagram – with flowers as a print on pretty chiffon frilly dresses and soft 
bikers. Forget Insta-models. Emily the Strange, Wednesday Addams and Elvira are 
the cool girl’s style icons this season, with Aleister Crowley and Wilkie 
Collins the required reading.LC

The death knoll of the skinny jean 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jan/09/skinny-jeans-fashion-trend-refuses-to-die>
 is forever being sounded – with little effect. But, judging by the fashion 
editors at London fashion week, there is certainly a solid contender for the 
skinny’s replacement. Enter the kick flare – basically skinny jeans with a 
little bounce out from the knee, typically worn cropped at the ankle with raw 
hems. ThinkUma Thurman in Pulp Fiction 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6XZwHAqjxA>, rather than anyone in the 70s. 
The kick flare has been getting play on the catwalk as well as the front row, 
at Marques’ Almeida,Erdem
