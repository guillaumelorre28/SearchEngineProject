Rain is not forecast in Chicago until tomorrow, but the tears were pouring 
down from the first family, the crowd and many across the country during Barack 
Obama’s emotional final presidential speech in Chicago on Tuesday evening.

Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> only had to 
say the word “Michelle” to have the crowd on its feet, giving the first lady a 
standing ovation.

Malia Obama, sitting next to her mother, started crying as her father paid a 
heartfelt tribute to her mother, the 18-year-old choking back tears and wiping 
her face.

“You took on a role you didn’t ask for and made it your own with grace and 
grit and style and good humor,” Obama said.

Then the president dabbed at his eyes with a white handkerchief. “You made the 
White House a place that belongs to everybody. And a new generation sets its 
sights higher because it has you as a role model,” he said.

It is rare for Obama to cry publicly – past moments include when he spoke 
about the Sandy Hook massacre, remembered his grandmother and after the death 
of Beau Biden. But the tears on stage from the first family on an emotional 
night echoed those of many in the US who are deeply fearful and concerned for 
the incoming Trump administration.

Crying, but feeling very thankful for Obama. Now, I feel like we're all being 
sent to a really mean summer camp.#ObamaFarewell

Obama also addressed his daughters, Malia and Sasha (the younger daughter did 
not attend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/11/where-is-sasha-obama-twitter-goes-nuts-over-missing-member-family>
 the speech).

“You have become two amazing young women, smart and beautiful, but more 
importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion. You wore the burden of 
years in the spotlight so easily,” he said. “Of all that I’ve done in my life, 
I’m most proud to be your dad.”

Cue more tears from Malia. Michelle remained composed but became a little 
watery-eyed after the speech ended. Vice-president Joe Biden joined others in 
the crowd crying during and after Obama’s final speech.
