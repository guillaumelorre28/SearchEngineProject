In February of this year, the A-Listers looked in a left-field direction for 
their fashion inspiration: Walt Disney. Dresses worn by Brie Larson, Saoirse 
Ronan and Alicia Vikander all channelled Disney cartoons: Beauty and the Beast, 
The Little Mermaid and Cinderella.

As it turned out, these references were prescient. In the following months, 
fashion embraced Disney in a big way. In April, Kenzo announced itsJungle 
Book-inspired line

, featuring typically brightly rendered close-ups of Shere Khan. While in 
Milan, Gucci’s Alessandro Michele debuted a short-sleeved sweater top in geek 
chic pastels featuring Donald Duck repeated in Warhol, screen-print style.

But where does this demand come from? While it’s true that our obsession with 
repurposing elements from our childhood is ever evident; from our love affair 
withvintage clothes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/18/vintagewear-takes-over-the-catwalk-with-help-from-amal-clooney-and-alexa-chung>
 and Hollywood’s obsession withremakes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters> to gif-filled listicles. But 
the line between adult infantilisation and dreamy nostalgia is a fine one. It’s 
an issue that swirls around many of our personal fashion decisions (“Am I too 
old for pigtails?”, “Should I stop wearing a leather jacket now I’m 40?”). When 
fashion labels embrace this imagery, it legitimises the indulgence of our 
childish side, but does it make it cool? WhenKate Moss 
<http://www.upscalehype.com/2011/03/kate-moss-in-balmain-spring-2010-motocross-tail-leather-jacket/>
 or Azealia Banks in the212  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Jv9fNPjgk>video 
wore vintage Mickey Mouse apparel it definitely did, arguably because the 
vintage element gave the image post-modern nous. In a similar way, Gucci’s 
throwback sweater succeeds because it is tongue-in-cheek, funny and doesn’t 
attempt to contemporise a symbol that has become part of the pop-culture 
furniture.
