In a statement on Wednesday he said he had been at court to file violence 
restraining orders against two men, one of whom allegedly made death threats 
against him, when he was allegedly “ambushed and knocked to the ground from 
behind”.

He alleges the man responsible was claiming to serve the papers on behalf of 
one of the subjects of the restraining order. His wife and two children watched 
the incident unfold.

“Yesterday ... has added further unwarranted strain on the family,” the 
statement said. The senator will address media in Perth later on Wednesday.

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/pauline-hanson> told the Seven 
Network she was not impressed with the incident and distanced herself from 
Fels. “It was nothing to do with One Nation, it was a civil matter,” she said.

 Hanson said no candidates for One Nation had been endorsed yet because the 
party is still in the process of registering to contest the Western Australian 
state election.
