Pokémon Go <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go> is getting 
bigger. Six months after its release, the game is getting its first major 
tranche of new pokémon, with fan favourites from the second generation of games 
including Pichu and Togepi joining the roster.

The pokémon, originally introduced in Pokemon Gold and Silver for the Game Boy 
Color, won’t be immediately accessible on the game map like typical creatures 
in the game. Instead, they will begin to hatch out of eggs from Tuesday, 
according to Pokémon Go developer Niantic Labs.

As well as Togepi and Pichu, Niantic says “select others” have been added to 
the game, and that this selection is just “the first of more Pokemon coming … 
over the next few months”.

Togepi and Pichu aren’t the first new pokémon to be added to the game. That 
honour goes to Ditto,introduced in late November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/24/pokemon-go-ditto> with an 
interesting gimmick (players catch the amorphous blob by accident, as it is 
always disguised as another pokémon). The pair are, however, the first pokémon 
in the game from beyond the original 150 pokémon.

Not every pokémon from the first games, Red and Blue, has made it in to 
Pokémon Go, either. The four “legendary” Pokémon from those games, Zapdos, 
Articuno, Moltres and Mewtwo, are still impossible for players to catch.

In a Christmas event, a Pikachu wearing a Santa’s hat will also be available 
to catch.
