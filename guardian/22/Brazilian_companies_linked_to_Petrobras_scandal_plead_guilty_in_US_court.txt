Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht SA and affiliated petrochemical company 
Braskem SA have pleaded guilty in a US court to violating American foreign 
bribery laws as part of a more than $3bn deal resolving a sweeping corruption 
probe of Brazil’s state oil company.

 The companies entered their pleas in federal court in Brooklyn in the major 
corruption case stemming from a wide-ranging probe into their role in a scheme 
involving political kickbacks at Brazil’s Petrobras.

 The cumulative penalties were negotiated as part of a global settlement with 
US, Brazilian and Swiss authorities.

They are the first guilty pleas in the United States following an 
investigation in Brazil dubbed “Operation Car Wash” into corruption at 
Petrobras, which has led to dozens of arrests and political upheaval inBrazil

The deal with Odebrecht, Latin America’s biggest engineering firm, is for 
6.9bn reais, more than $2bn, a source told Reuters this week, and is part of an 
agreement with Brazilian prosecutors.

 Under the global settlement deal, Braskem jointly owned by Odebrecht and 
Petrobras, has agreed to a global deal of $632m, assistant US attorney 
Alixandra Smith said in court. Of that sum, the US gets 15%, Switzerland gets 
15% and Brazil gets 70%, prosecutors said.

 Both companies agreed to cooperate with authorities, implement compliance 
improvements and become subject to oversight by an external monitor.

 It is one of the largest corruption cases on record. The total fines and 
penalties paid out by the companies exceed a 2008 agreement in which German 
engineering company Siemens paid $1.6bn to US and European authorities for 
paying bribes to win government contracts.
