At the moment it's standup paddleboarding. Partly because it involves standing 
up which is something I've perfected over the years and because it involves a 
bit of balance and physical exertion and there's the right amount of exercise 
alongside a zen-like meditative quality where you appear to be walking on 
water. you have a better field of view than in a kayak. You feel a sense of 
freedom, you have to focus, you have to balance, but there's something about 
propelling yourself on the water... I hear an evolutionary echo of our former 
selves. This is a simple and basic way of getting around. Last year I was in 
southern Tasmania in a place called Melaleuca and there were these Aboriginal 
bark canoes which they would stand on and paddle. These were the first standup 
paddleboards! This is why it feels such a natural thing to do.

Which is more important – pigeons or ham?

Pigeons. Because they may not be here forever. And ham will be. For example, 
the passenger pigeon is a case in point. Everyone thought it would be here 
forever because there were so many of them, there were literally billions. As 
recently as 1866 an eyewitness report saw a flock a mile wide, 14 miles long 
and it took 14 hours for it to fly past. When you see a proliferation like that 
you can't imagine they'll be gone, ever. They were hunted indiscriminately, 
there was no thought as to whether the population might diminish. The tragedy 
was that in 1913, there was one left. Called Martha, in Cincinnati zoo. She 
died in captivity. And that was the end for passenger pigeons. Who would have 
thought it in 1866?

How long does it take you to write a show? Are you structured about it? With a 
pen or out loud?

It probably takes about a year. And that includes writing and trying material 
out in small venues. The actual creative process takes less time, a few months, 
but the winnowing out of the material that doesn't get used takes a lot longer. 
I tend to write in different ways, I used to think it was good to record your 
voice, and if you had an idea, just record it, and then I did it on my phone 
and there was lots of these little random mumbled ideas I was speaking in a 
public place, embarrassed, and they didn't make any sense. So now I always have 
a laptop so I don't lose bits of paper, and write material on a pad with a pen, 
then transfer it to the computer so the dog doesn't have it. On screen you can 
arrange it a bit better and improve it. But there's no easy way, you have to 
say it out loud. Even funny ideas that look good on paper morph into something 
else when you speak them to an audience. Those are variables that have 
unexpected benefits or sometimes don't work at all. It's a long, labour 
intensive process and it doesn't end. It's one long... my life's work, really.

At the moment it's standup paddleboarding. Partly because it involves standing 
up which is something I've perfected over the years and because it involves a 
bit of balance and physical exertion and there's the right amount of exercise 
alongside a zen-like meditative quality where you appear to be walking on 
water. you have a better field of view than in a kayak. You feel a sense of 
freedom, you have to focus, you have to balance, but there's something about 
propelling yourself on the water... I hear an evolutionary echo of our former 
selves. This is a simple and basic way of getting around. Last year I was in 
southern Tasmania in a place called Melaleuca and there were these Aboriginal 
bark canoes which they would stand on and paddle. These were the first standup 
paddleboards! This is why it feels such a natural thing to do.

Pigeons. Because they may not be here forever. And ham will be. For example, 
the passenger pigeon is a case in point. Everyone thought it would be here 
forever because there were so many of them, there were literally billions. As 
recently as 1866 an eyewitness report saw a flock a mile wide, 14 miles long 
and it took 14 hours for it to fly past. When you see a proliferation like that 
you can't imagine they'll be gone, ever. They were hunted indiscriminately, 
there was no thought as to whether the population might diminish. The tragedy 
was that in 1913, there was one left. Called Martha, in Cincinnati zoo. She 
died in captivity. And that was the end for passenger pigeons. Who would have 
thought it in 1866?

It probably takes about a year. And that includes writing and trying material 
out in small venues. The actual creative process takes less time, a few months, 
but the winnowing out of the material that doesn't get used takes a lot longer. 
I tend to write in different ways, I used to think it was good to record your 
voice, and if you had an idea, just record it, and then I did it on my phone 
and there was lots of these little random mumbled ideas I was speaking in a 
public place, embarrassed, and they didn't make any sense. So now I always have 
a laptop so I don't lose bits of paper, and write material on a pad with a pen, 
then transfer it to the computer so the dog doesn't have it. On screen you can 
arrange it a bit better and improve it. But there's no easy way, you have to 
say it out loud. Even funny ideas that look good on paper morph into something 
else when you speak them to an audience. Those are variables that have 
unexpected benefits or sometimes don't work at all. It's a long, labour 
intensive process and it doesn't end. It's one long... my life's work, really.
