So, it was a trouble-free day for Chris Froome in the end, with his closest 
rivals deciding to consolidate their podium spots rather than the attack the 
man in yellow. The spills of yesterday’s stage were avoided, Team Sky 
controlling a tentative peloton over four climbs and slippery descents.

The race was, in truth, won before today, and in far more testing 
circumstances – Froome has experienced his fair share of drama on the road 
here, and will cross the line in Paris a worthy winner.

I’ll leave you with our race report. Thanks for joining me. Bye!

Chris Froome has all but won the 2016 Tour de France

Froome crosses the line on stage 20, cheered by the crowd. There is a final 
procession to Paris to come, but he has sealed a third Tour title in four 
years. Who could argue he doesn’t deserve it?

Alaphilippe comes back in fourth, with Rodriguez and Kreuziger following him 
home. Both will make marginal gains in the general classification for their 
efforts today. Kelderman, his legs grazed, comes in later than expected. He 
clearly took a tumble, although the cameras missed it.

Jon Izaguirre wins stage 20!

The Movistar rider caught the leading group late, took on Jarlinson Pantano 
and Vincenzo Nibali on a brutal descent, and wins by 20 seconds. Bravo. Pantano 
is second, a disappointed Nibali third.

Izaguirre is into the final 2km, as the road levels out, still out of 
Pantano’s sight. There’s a kick up in the final kilometre, but he looks to have 
this won...

Bardet is descending smoothly, as expected, but is not willing to take any 
chances, and risk throwing away second in pursuit of first. Froome is almost 
there...

Izaguirre has descended flawlessly so far, and has just 4km to go, but he’s 
not entirely sure where Pantano is. The Colombian has raced beyond Nibali, but 
has ten seconds to make up on the leader. So far, there has been not a single 
crash or collision on this testing descent – in sharp contrast to yesterday.

Rodriguez is being reeled in by the yellow jersey group, who are cautiously 
making their way down the descent, taking those wide, slippery corners very 
gingerly indeed.

More watch-through-your-fingers stuff early in the descent, with Pantano 
inches from toppling off the side of the road, and Nibali edging far too close 
to a wall in an effort to open a gap. Jon Izaguirre, not expected to match the 
other two on the descent, is cruising at 73km/h, and has opened a gap.

The peloton, led by Geraint Thomas all the way up that final climb, have 
reached the summit. No attacks ever materialised from rivals who decided to 
settle for podium places. At the front, the three leaders are still stuck 
together, Izaguirre dictating the pace, while Wilco Kelderman has leapfrogged 
Alaphilippe to move into fourth place.

downhill racing in the rain to separate them, with Alaphilippe still just about 
in striking distance.

Romain Bardet and Quintana, is being dominated by Froome’s Team Sky colleagues, 
who crank up the pace, cutting the gap to the leaders to just over three

Nibali, exhaustion written all over his face, moves to within 1km of the 
summit. Movistar’s Izaguirre looks fresher, while Pantano is, of course, still 
clinging on as the three men regroup. They will tackle the descent to Morzine 
together. This should be fun...

The three become four, as Movistar’s Ion Izaguirre, a quiet presence in the 
breakaway all day, catches the struggling Pantano and Alaphilippe. Izaguirre 
tries to launch himself beyond both; Pantano goes with him, Alaphilippe cannot,

Pantano and Alaphilippe have engaged in macho head games for much of this 
climb, allowing Nibali to catch them – and the Italian has now eked out a 50m 
lead, with 2.5km to the summit. They need to work together, while Rodriguez has 
caught up with team-mate Zakarin, and could launch himself into the final GC 
top ten.

Team Sky are finding one more burst of power up this final climb, cutting the 
gap to the leaders down to 3min 30sec, with Quintana still just behind Froome, 
not able to make a move, and running out of time. Nibali has joined Pantano and 
Alaphilippe, and these three are set for a breathtaking downhill race to the 
line...

Mollema is caught by the yellow jersey group, while Joaquim Rodriguez, the 
climber set to retire this year, is making a late break from the pack. At the 
front, Nibali is in Pantano’s sights – but the Colombian will not be beaten, 
and bursts clear to rejoin Alaphilippe! Those two regroup, with Nibali still in 
range, as the descent to the line looms ever closer.

As Brailsford mentioned, Sky’s Henao is well placed to drop back from the 
counterattacking group, giving Froome a timely boost near the top of the 
mountain. The two leaders continue to drive up this relentless climb, with 5km 
to go, all at a gradient of more than 9%. Alaphilippe looks remarkably fresh, 
and carves out a gap over Pantano.

Alaphilippe, who so nearly won the second stage, fancies his chances on the 
second-last day, bursting clear of Pantano – but the Colombian doesn’t give up 
easily, and hauls himself back. Nibali is moving faster than both leaders, 
while Kreuziger appears to have run out of steam.

Thomas continues to control things at the front of the peloton, with Bardet, 
Quintana and Adam Yates focusing on maintaining their current position on this 
tricky climb.

Still 6km for the leading pair until they crest the final climb, and Vincenzo 
Nibali is making a move. The peloton have cut the gap to the other 
counter-attackers, including Kreuziger, whose podium bid looks to be falling

Quite the comeback from Bauke Mollema, who has rejoined the front of the 
peloton, and raced off the front! The Dutchman is too far back in the GC to 
worry Froome, but Team Sky have now taken up the reins at the front.

At the front, Pantano has a historical edge over his rival – Colombians have 
an impressive record at Morzine. Luis Herrera and Fabio Parra have won Tour 
stages here, and Nairo Quintana has won a Dauphine stage in this corner of the 
Alps.

@niallmcveigh <https://twitter.com/niallmcveigh> Only in their final chess 
championship match did Pantano manage to beat Alaphilippe, thanks to his 
devious Joux Plane gambit.

Fabio Aru’s faint hopes of a podium place look to be over – the Astana rider 
has blown up early on the slopes of the final climb, with his team-mates 
dropping back to help him out. Daryl Impey is setting a fair old whip at the 
front for Orica, with Geraint Thomas and Chris Froome tucked in behind him. 
Quintana is still lurking behind Froome... it’s now or never, Nairo...

The final climb

Pantano and Alaphilippe, now 1min 50sec ahead of the chasing group, and 5min 
40sec clear of the peloton, are negotiating, the Col de Joux Plane, the final 
climb of today. It’s hors categorie, 12km at an eye-watering 8.5% average. And 
the descent, steep, winding and uneven all the way to the finish line, is even 
worse.

On Froome, who suffered that crash yesterday: “He’s a bit sore, but I don’t 
think it’s affected him in any way. He’s an incredible guy, such a fighter, and 
it would take something drastic to stop him now.”

Froome has just 23km of admittedly steep, slippery road to go. The stage 
tomorrow will be a procession; barring accidents, he will win the 2016Tour de 
France <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> at the finish line 
today.

Kreuziger’s leap into second in the overall standings plays into the hands of 
the man above him, Chris Froome. His team-mates are having to do very little 
work in the peloton, with AG2R and Orica now pushing to preserve Bardet and 
Yates’ podium chances.

David Millar suggests that Astana may have been bluffing, controlling the 
peloton supposedly to help Fabio Aru, but actually allowing the leaders, 
including Vincenzo Nibali, to open up a decent gap. Orica BikeExchange have 
realised that Yates’ podium place is under serious threat, and try to get the 
yellow jersey group moving again.

Chris Froome and the riders around him took that descent with entirely 
appropriate care, and are now seven minutes behind Pantano and Alaphilippe, 
riding through driving rain. That also puts Roman Kreuziger back up to second 
in the GC, still 3min 42secs behind Froome but looking good to bump Nairo 
Quintana off the podium.

The leading pair have a 40 second advantage over a group of seven riders: 
Kreuziger, Henao, Nibali, Kelderman, de Gendt, Izaguirre and Rui Costa. The 
peloton, who have reached the bottom of the descent safely, are six minutes 
further back. We’re in the town of Taninges, where you’ll find the last of the 
flat roads and mild weather before we begin the final climb, and things start 
to get pretty serious.

Pantano, one of this year’s stars, has found his line to cruise past de Gendt 
and into the lead. Rolland, taking the descent gingerly after yesterday’s 
crash, has drifted out of touch. Pantano is caught by Alaphilippe, the pair 
racing away from the others at breathtaking speed.

The peloton pass over the climb, with Froome not troubled by a single 
challenge to his supremacy. Perhaps it was the pace set by Astana; perhaps 
those in podium spots are focused only on hanging onto them. One more climb, 
one brutal descent, and Froome will have won theTour de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> for a third time.

The leading men are over the summit and heading down the descent, racing round 
sweeping, shiny corners at high speed. I can hardly watch. Kreuziger and 
Alaphilippe are keen on catching up with de Gendt, while this will suit master 
descender, Vincenzo Nibali.

De Gendt is blowing hard, but will reach the third peak of the day in the 
lead. The rain is falling again, and the descent could be more eventful than 
the climb. The Lotto-Soudal man leads by 25 seconds from Rui Costa and Pierre 
Rolland.

Another Team Sky rider has fallen off the pace – Vasili Kiryienka, who joins 
Landa and Luke Rowe in losing touch. As Gary Naylor points out, it’s surely now 
or never for a GC contender to attack Froome – but it’s not happening yet:
Gary Naylor (@garynaylor999) 
Surely one of the GC guys has to attack now @niallmcveigh 
<https://twitter.com/niallmcveigh> If Froome has only one Team Sky rider for 
the final climb, he might be vulnerable?

The climb has sapped the legs of many in the leading group, not least 
Gourgeard, who has been overtaken by the relentless Thomas de Gendt as the 
counter-attackers absorb the seven men at the front. As the climb flattens 
briefly, Rui Costa makes a move to catch de Gendt, who is threatening to pull 
away. He’s joined by Cannondale’s Pierre Rolland.

5km to go until the leaders crest the Col de la Ramaz, with Thomas de Gendt 
aiming to bridge the gap and create a larger group, which might suit Kreuziger, 
who has dropped to eighth in the virtual GC. Gougeard has forced a ten-second 
gap at the front, while in the peloton, AG2R up the pace, andBauke Mollema, 
second until yesterday’s closing stages, is dropped. He’s likely to fall even 
further down the standings.

Nibali ups the pace as the gradient increases, with Gougeard sticking with him 
but others, including Kreuziger, wondering if it’s worth the effort. Gougeard, 
sensing apathy among his co-leaders, makes a break for it alone!

The peloton, driven forward by Astana, are beginning to hoover up the 
stragglers from that early breakaway, including Michael Matthews. Plenty of 
riders falling away from the peloton, but Chris Froome still entirely 
comfortable, the finish and a third title now within 60km.

@niallmcveigh <https://twitter.com/niallmcveigh> This hasn't been a vintage 
year for many. Froome deserves victory after stellar ride; Pinot's Thrilling 
Heroics didn't appear.

This front group are a little lost without Sagan’s reassuring recklessness – 
all looking around, hoping someone else will take up the reins. Gougeard has 
rejoined the leaders, who have 40 seconds on the chasing pack, with the peloton 
still five minutes behind.

refusing to work with Kreuziger, has dropped back with a puncture, and is is

Costa – an Electric Six. There’s an up-to-date reference for you.

The group of chasers, comprising 18 riders and led by Wilco Kelderman and

Slightly farcical scenes in the peloton, as a quartet of Astana riders try to 
attack at the bottom of the climb – and Team Sky let them go, with Fabio Aru 
still in the pack. They’re left ten feet in front of the peloton with nowhere 
to go, looking over their shoulders sheepishly. At the back, a gruppetto has 
formed, with several riders unable to hack the pace of the peloton.

Sagan still towing his seven co-leaders at a dramatic pace, even on the lower 
slopes of the third climb. After a brief plateau at Messy, things could get, 
well, messy, with 8km of increasingly steep, exposed roads, with mountain-side 
switchbacks reaching 15% gradient in places.

Pierre Rolland, who took a big fall yesterday and has struggled to get settled 
into today’s breakaway, gets a clear hand sling from his team car. Orica, who 
suggested Adam Yates’ penalty was unfair as slings are so commonplace, will be 
watching that with interest.

The race is at the halfway stage, in a valley between the second and third 
climbs, 75km from the start, just over 70km from the finish. The only thing 
bothering Chris Froome at the moment is whether or not to hang onto his anorak, 
but the biggest tests are yet to come.

Up the road, Sagan is still ruthlessly shedding riders, with Pantano and Rui 
Costa dropped briefly, but able to work together and rejoin the leading group.

So, it was a trouble-free day for Chris Froome in the end, with his closest 
rivals deciding to consolidate their podium spots rather than the attack the 
man in yellow. The spills of yesterday’s stage were avoided, Team Sky 
controlling a tentative peloton over four climbs and slippery descents.

The race was, in truth, won before today, and in far more testing 
circumstances – Froome has experienced his fair share of drama on the road 
here, and will cross the line in Paris a worthy winner.

I’ll leave you with our race report. Thanks for joining me. Bye!

Froome crosses the line on stage 20, cheered by the crowd. There is a final 
procession to Paris to come, but he has sealed a third Tour title in four 
years. Who could argue he doesn’t deserve it?

Bardet, Dan Martin and Quintana make a late break to gain a few seconds in the 
overall standings, and here comes Chris Froome...
 
Further back, the road is flattening out in front of Chris Froome, and while 
he won’t be the official winner until tomorrow, he is seconds from his third
Tour de France <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> victory...
 
Alaphilippe comes back in fourth, with Rodriguez and Kreuziger following him 
home. Both will make marginal gains in the general classification for their 
efforts today. Kelderman, his legs grazed, comes in later than expected. He 
clearly took a tumble, although the cameras missed it.
 
The Movistar rider caught the leading group late, took on Jarlinson Pantano 
and Vincenzo Nibali on a brutal descent, and wins by 20 seconds. Bravo. Pantano 
is second, a disappointed Nibali third.

Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images  
Izaguirre is into the final 2km, as the road levels out, still out of 
Pantano’s sight. There’s a kick up in the final kilometre, but he looks to have 
this won...
 
Bardet is descending smoothly, as expected, but is not willing to take any 
chances, and risk throwing away second in pursuit of first. Froome is almost 
there...
 
Izaguirre has descended flawlessly so far, and has just 4km to go, but he’s 
not entirely sure where Pantano is. The Colombian has raced beyond Nibali, but 
has ten seconds to make up on the leader. So far, there has been not a single 
crash or collision on this testing descent – in sharp contrast to yesterday.
 
Rodriguez is being reeled in by the yellow jersey group, who are cautiously 
making their way down the descent, taking those wide, slippery corners very 
gingerly indeed.
 
More watch-through-your-fingers stuff early in the descent, with Pantano 
inches from toppling off the side of the road, and Nibali edging far too close 
to a wall in an effort to open a gap. Jon Izaguirre, not expected to match the 
other two on the descent, is cruising at 73km/h, and has opened a gap.
 
The peloton, led by Geraint Thomas all the way up that final climb, have 
reached the summit. No attacks ever materialised from rivals who decided to 
settle for podium places. At the front, the three leaders are still stuck 
together, Izaguirre dictating the pace, while Wilco Kelderman has leapfrogged 
Alaphilippe to move into fourth place.
 
Pantano, Nibali and Izaguirre reach the summit together. There’s 11.5km of 
downhill racing in the rain to separate them, with Alaphilippe still just about 
in striking distance.
 
The group of GC favourites, which still contains Richie Porte, Adam Yates, 
Romain Bardet and Quintana, is being dominated by Froome’s Team Sky colleagues, 
who crank up the pace, cutting the gap to the leaders to just over three 
minutes.
 
Nibali, exhaustion written all over his face, moves to within 1km of the 
summit. Movistar’s Izaguirre looks fresher, while Pantano is, of course, still 
clinging on as the three men regroup. They will tackle the descent to Morzine 
together. This should be fun...
 
Henao rejoins the peloton, where Pouls, Nieve and Thomas are still defending 
Froome. Just a handful of kilometres to go, and the pack are becalmed. Only 
something drastic on the descent can stop Froome now.
 
The three become four, as Movistar’s Ion Izaguirre, a quiet presence in the 
breakaway all day, catches the struggling Pantano and Alaphilippe. Izaguirre 
tries to launch himself beyond both; Pantano goes with him, Alaphilippe cannot, 
and is cut adrift.
 
Pantano and Alaphilippe have engaged in macho head games for much of this 
climb, allowing Nibali to catch them – and the Italian has now eked out a 50m 
lead, with 2.5km to the summit. They need to work together, while Rodriguez has 
caught up with team-mate Zakarin, and could launch himself into the final GC 
top ten.

Team Sky are finding one more burst of power up this final climb, cutting the 
gap to the leaders down to 3min 30sec, with Quintana still just behind Froome, 
not able to make a move, and running out of time. Nibali has joined Pantano and 
Alaphilippe, and these three are set for a breathtaking downhill race to the 
line...
 
Mollema is caught by the yellow jersey group, while Joaquim Rodriguez, the 
climber set to retire this year, is making a late break from the pack. At the 
front, Nibali is in Pantano’s sights – but the Colombian will not be beaten, 
and bursts clear to rejoin Alaphilippe! Those two regroup, with Nibali still in 
range, as the descent to the line looms ever closer.
 
As Brailsford mentioned, Sky’s Henao is well placed to drop back from the 
counterattacking group, giving Froome a timely boost near the top of the 
mountain. The two leaders continue to drive up this relentless climb, with 5km 
to go, all at a gradient of more than 9%. Alaphilippe looks remarkably fresh, 
and carves out a gap over Pantano.
 
Alaphilippe, who so nearly won the second stage, fancies his chances on the 
second-last day, bursting clear of Pantano – but the Colombian doesn’t give up 
easily, and hauls himself back. Nibali is moving faster than both leaders, 
while Kreuziger appears to have run out of steam.

Thomas continues to control things at the front of the peloton, with Bardet, 
Quintana and Adam Yates focusing on maintaining their current position on this 
tricky climb.
 
Still 6km for the leading pair until they crest the final climb, and Vincenzo 
Nibali is making a move. The peloton have cut the gap to the other 
counter-attackers, including Kreuziger, whose podium bid looks to be falling 
short.
 
Quite the comeback from Bauke Mollema, who has rejoined the front of the 
peloton, and raced off the front! The Dutchman is too far back in the GC to 
worry Froome, but Team Sky have now taken up the reins at the front.

At the front, Pantano has a historical edge over his rival – Colombians have 
an impressive record at Morzine. Luis Herrera and Fabio Parra have won Tour 
stages here, and Nairo Quintana has won a Dauphine stage in this corner of the 
Alps.

championship match did Pantano manage to beat Alaphilippe, thanks to his 
devious Joux Plane gambit.

Fabio Aru’s faint hopes of a podium place look to be over – the Astana rider 
has blown up early on the slopes of the final climb, with his team-mates 
dropping back to help him out. Daryl Impey is setting a fair old whip at the 
front for Orica, with Geraint Thomas and Chris Froome tucked in behind him. 
Quintana is still lurking behind Froome... it’s now or never, Nairo...
 
Ilnur Zakarin and Pierre Rolland, great climbers but dodgy descenders, have 
managed to rejoin the chasing group at the foot of the Joux Plane. There are 
nine riders in pursuit of Pantano and Alaphilippe:Kreuziger, Henao, Rolland, 
Zakarin, Nibali, Kelderman, de Gendt, Izaguirre and Rui Costa.
 
Peter Sagan has been named the 2016 Tour’s ‘super combative’ – an award for 
the most aggressive rider of the whole race. He beat Thomas de Gendt in the 
vote, with Jarlinson Pantano third.
 
Pantano and Alaphilippe, now 1min 50sec ahead of the chasing group, and 5min 
40sec clear of the peloton, are negotiating, the Col de Joux Plane, the final 
climb of today. It’s hors categorie, 12km at an eye-watering 8.5% average. And 
the descent, steep, winding and uneven all the way to the finish line, is even 
worse.
 
Team Sky head honcho Dave Brailsford is being interviewed on ITV:

“It’s tense isn’t it? The other teams are getting nervous about the podium 
places. Once we get to the foot of the Joux Plane we’ll feel more comfortable.”

On Froome, who suffered that crash yesterday: “He’s a bit sore, but I don’t 
think it’s affected him in any way. He’s an incredible guy, such a fighter, and 
it would take something drastic to stop him now.”

Froome has just 23km of admittedly steep, slippery road to go. The stage 
tomorrow will be a procession; barring accidents, he will win the 2016Tour de 
France <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> at the finish line 
today.
 
Kreuziger’s leap into second in the overall standings plays into the hands of 
the man above him, Chris Froome. His team-mates are having to do very little 
work in the peloton, with AG2R and Orica now pushing to preserve Bardet and 
Yates’ podium chances.
 
David Millar suggests that Astana may have been bluffing, controlling the 
peloton supposedly to help Fabio Aru, but actually allowing the leaders, 
including Vincenzo Nibali, to open up a decent gap. Orica BikeExchange have 
realised that Yates’ podium place is under serious threat, and try to get the 
yellow jersey group moving again.
 
Chris Froome and the riders around him took that descent with entirely 
appropriate care, and are now seven minutes behind Pantano and Alaphilippe, 
riding through driving rain. That also puts Roman Kreuziger back up to second 
in the GC, still 3min 42secs behind Froome but looking good to bump Nairo 
Quintana off the podium.
 
The leading pair have a 40 second advantage over a group of seven riders: 
Kreuziger, Henao, Nibali, Kelderman, de Gendt, Izaguirre and Rui Costa. The 
peloton, who have reached the bottom of the descent safely, are six minutes 
further back. We’re in the town of Taninges, where you’ll find the last of the 
flat roads and mild weather before we begin the final climb, and things start 
to get pretty serious.
 
Name the breakaway! “Pantano/Alaphilippe: Special Ops duo dispatched by NATO 
to steal the Colonel’s secret recipe, as well as Coca-Cola’s secret formula. 
Both attempts failed” says Ashton Greene.
 
Pantano, one of this year’s stars, has found his line to cruise past de Gendt 
and into the lead. Rolland, taking the descent gingerly after yesterday’s 
crash, has drifted out of touch. Pantano is caught by Alaphilippe, the pair 
racing away from the others at breathtaking speed.
 
The peloton pass over the climb, with Froome not troubled by a single 
challenge to his supremacy. Perhaps it was the pace set by Astana; perhaps 
those in podium spots are focused only on hanging onto them. One more climb, 
one brutal descent, and Froome will have won theTour de France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance> for a third time.
 
The leading men are over the summit and heading down the descent, racing round 
sweeping, shiny corners at high speed. I can hardly watch. Kreuziger and 
Alaphilippe are keen on catching up with de Gendt, while this will suit master 
descender, Vincenzo Nibali.
 
De Gendt is blowing hard, but will reach the third peak of the day in the 
lead. The rain is falling again, and the descent could be more eventful than 
the climb. The Lotto-Soudal man leads by 25 seconds from Rui Costa and Pierre 
Rolland.
 
Another Team Sky rider has fallen off the pace – Vasili Kiryienka, who joins 
Landa and Luke Rowe in losing touch. As Gary Naylor points out, it’s surely now 
or never for a GC contender to attack Froome – but it’s not happening yet:
Gary Naylor (@garynaylor999) 
Surely one of the GC guys has to attack now @niallmcveigh 
<https://twitter.com/niallmcveigh> If Froome has only one Team Sky rider for 
the final climb, he might be vulnerable?

<https://twitter.com/garynaylor999/status/756844846074195969>  
The climb has sapped the legs of many in the leading group, not least 
Gourgeard, who has been overtaken by the relentless Thomas de Gendt as the 
counter-attackers absorb the seven men at the front. As the climb flattens 
briefly, Rui Costa makes a move to catch de Gendt, who is threatening to pull 
away. He’s joined by Cannondale’s Pierre Rolland.
 
Other men dropped by the peloton including Sky’s Mikel Landa, French champion 
Arthur Vichot, and two riders who have been pedalling backwards since joining 
that early breakaway – Tony Gallopin and Daniel Teklehaimanot.
 
5km to go until the leaders crest the Col de la Ramaz, with Thomas de Gendt 
aiming to bridge the gap and create a larger group, which might suit Kreuziger, 
who has dropped to eighth in the virtual GC. Gougeard has forced a ten-second 
gap at the front, while in the peloton, AG2R up the pace, andBauke Mollema, 
second until yesterday’s closing stages, is dropped. He’s likely to fall even 
further down the standings.
 
Nibali ups the pace as the gradient increases, with Gougeard sticking with him 
but others, including Kreuziger, wondering if it’s worth the effort. Gougeard, 
sensing apathy among his co-leaders, makes a break for it alone!
 
The peloton, driven forward by Astana, are beginning to hoover up the 
stragglers from that early breakaway, including Michael Matthews. Plenty of 
riders falling away from the peloton, but Chris Froome still entirely 
comfortable, the finish and a third title now within 60km.

@niallmcveigh <https://twitter.com/niallmcveigh> This hasn't been a vintage 
year for many. Froome deserves victory after stellar ride; Pinot's Thrilling 
Heroics didn't appear.

This front group are a little lost without Sagan’s reassuring recklessness – 
all looking around, hoping someone else will take up the reins. Gougeard has 
rejoined the leaders, who have 40 seconds on the chasing pack, with the peloton 
still five minutes behind.
 
Alexis Gougeard, already showing loyalty to team-mate Romain Bardet by 
refusing to work with Kreuziger, has dropped back with a puncture, and is is 
fighting to rejoinKreuziger, Pantano, Nibali, Alaphilippe, Izaguirre and Rui 
Costa – an Electric Six. There’s an up-to-date reference for you.
 
The group of chasers, comprising 18 riders and led by Wilco Kelderman and 
Warren Barguil, are making ground on the leaders. Sagan has finally blown up 
after 80km of flat-out effort; selfless stuff to help Kreuziger, as it may hurt 
his chances of winning the final stage tomorrow.
 
Slightly farcical scenes in the peloton, as a quartet of Astana riders try to 
attack at the bottom of the climb – and Team Sky let them go, with Fabio Aru 
still in the pack. They’re left ten feet in front of the peloton with nowhere 
to go, looking over their shoulders sheepishly. At the back, a gruppetto has 
formed, with several riders unable to hack the pace of the peloton.
 
Sagan still towing his seven co-leaders at a dramatic pace, even on the lower 
slopes of the third climb. After a brief plateau at Messy, things could get, 
well, messy, with 8km of increasingly steep, exposed roads, with mountain-side 
switchbacks reaching 15% gradient in places.
 
Pierre Rolland, who took a big fall yesterday and has struggled to get settled 
into today’s breakaway, gets a clear hand sling from his team car. Orica, who 
suggested Adam Yates’ penalty was unfair as slings are so commonplace, will be 
watching that with interest.
 
Absolutely throwing it down as the leaders cross the Arve river, and begin the 
day’s third climb – the Col de la Ramaz, a Category 1, 14km affair.

The race is at the halfway stage, in a valley between the second and third 
climbs, 75km from the start, just over 70km from the finish. The only thing 
bothering Chris Froome at the moment is whether or not to hang onto his anorak, 
but the biggest tests are yet to come.

Up the road, Sagan is still ruthlessly shedding riders, with Pantano and Rui 
Costa dropped briefly, but able to work together and rejoin the leading group.
