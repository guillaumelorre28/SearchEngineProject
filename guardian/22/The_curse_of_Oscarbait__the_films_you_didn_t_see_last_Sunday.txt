As we predict the possible winners of next year’s Academy Awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/24/oscars-2016-and-next-years-awards-will-go-to->
, it’s worth remembering, to quote an Oscar-winning script, that sometimes it 
is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can 
imagine. Or something.

Which means that this time last year, no one had even heard of Still Alice, a 
film that eventually won Julianne Moore the Oscar for best actress. But other, 
more high-profile bets didn’t quite hit the mark. Here are the films that, last 
year, we all thought would be contenders.

Trash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/29/trash-review-kids-adventure-daldry>

Stephen Daldry <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/stephen-daldry> started 
out on one hell of a roll after securing three best director Oscar nominations 
for his first three films (Billy Elliot, The Hours and The Reader), and while 
his next, the overly sentimental Sandra Bullock-starrer Extremely Loud and 
Incredibly Close, might have underwhelmed, it still received a nod for best 
picture. Given his pedigree, it seemed like a Richard Curtis-scripted, Slumdog 
Millionaire-esque drama about Brazilian street kids, but with a supporting turn 
from Oscar nominee Rooney Mara, would be a shoo-in. It even took the top prize 
at the Rome film festival, where it opened. But it wasn’t pushed by the studio 
as the contender it once seemed; without awards buzz, crashed and burned last 
month at the UK box office. It’s still without a confirmed release date in the 
US.

After The Artist arrived from nowhere to win five Oscars, director Michel 
Hazanavicius <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michel-hazanavicius> made an 
understandable next move: he reteamed with its breakout star, his wife Bérénice 
Bejo, recruited multiple Oscar nominee Annette Bening, and cast them in a film 
set in a war zone. Even with all that effort, The Search proved to be a wild 
goose chase. In fact, it was rubbished by many critics when it premiered at 
last year’s Cannes. The response even led Hazanavicius to shave 17 minutes off 
the film and present a new, “angrier” version at Toronto. But still, the film 
refused to show the Oscar potential it once promised, and while some 
territories have now seen a proper release, it’s yet to be shown in the UK or 
US.

Strictly speaking, Unbroken is an Oscar-nominated film. It picked up three 
technical nominations, including best cinematography for Roger Deakins, but 
given the hype, it’s not quite what we all expected. It seemed like an easy win 
on paper, with a tale of overcoming adversity that combined sports and war 
genres, but second-time directorAngelina Jolie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/angelinajolie> didn’t know quite what to do 
with it all. Even a script rewrite from the Coens couldn’t help matters, and 
the result was an overly formulaic piece of Oscarbait that didn’t reach the 
highs it ambitiously set out towards. Her next film as director, which sees her 
starring with the Bra of Brangelina, aims to be part of next year’s race.

Given Tim Burton’s fall from grace, it’s perhaps no surprise that this didn’t 
quite catch on in the way that we originally thought it might. It’s easy to see 
why it seemed like such a great opportunity, with a leading duo of two-time 
Oscar winnerChristoph Waltz <https://www.theguardian.com/film/christoph-waltz> 
and multiple nominee Amy Adams, a fascinatingly strange true story, and a 
kitsch 60s setting that would play to Burton’s strengths. While it might have 
led to better reviews than Dark Shadows and Alice in Wonderland combined, the 
response wasn’t quite good enough, and neither star was in the race for an 
Oscar. It was also a box-office dud, and to no one’s astonishment Burton’s next 
film will see him return to the mind-numbing 3D madness of an Alice sequel.

It’s been a patchy few years for Nicole Kidman, with low points aplenty from a 
role in trashy Nicolas Cage thriller Trespass, to playing Jennifer Aniston’s 
nemesis in the Adam Sandler comedy Just Go With It. But neither received quite 
as much scorn as her performance in last year’s much-ridiculed Cannes opener 
where she played an extremely dull and pampered version of Grace Kelly. The 
film, originally viewed by Harvey Weinstein as awards gold, was soon tainted by 
a feud between him and the director, as well as by its future status as a 
bad-movie-night mainstay. It was laughed out of UK cinemas last summer, while 
Weinstein haspromised that the US will get to see a “writer’s cut” 
<http://deadline.com/2015/01/harvey-weinstein-the-imitation-game-oscar-bad-mouthing-sony-hack-quentin-tarantino-1201358304/>
, which will come as a glorious treat to anyone who’s already seen and heard 
the existing one.

Bar her, admittedly well-cast, turn in Sam Raimi’s otherwise disappointing Oz 
the Great and Powerful 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/07/oz-the-great-and-powerful-review>
, Michelle Williams picks her work wisely, choosing to showcase her talents in 
smaller projects – a strategy that’s led to three Oscar nominations. It seemed 
as if a lead inwartime romance Suite Française 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview2> 
would net her another, with the director of The Duchess at the helm, but the 
shoot finished in September 2013, and there was no qualifying run for this 
year’s ceremony. It’s set to hit UK cinemas in March – not usually a great 
sign, but the same could have been said for last year’s The Grand Budapest 
Hotel, which won four Oscars last week. So the jury’s still out on this one, 
taking their suite time.
