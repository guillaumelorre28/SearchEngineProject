Police say the children were distressed but uninjured. Their 44-year-old

Temperatures in parts of western Sydney topped 40C

 on Wednesday.

Police have reminded parents that on a typical summer day, the temperature 
inside a car, even with the windows rolled down a little, can quickly rise 
above 50C.

Even on a relatively mild day, the temperature inside a car can get above 40C 
and, at those temperatures, children are at great risk of heatstroke, which can 
lead to a high fever, dehydration, seizures, stroke and death.
