Duncan, an economist, has served in posts at the west African central bank and 
as finance minister, and is among Ouattara’s closest long-time collaborators. 
He resigned as prime minister on Monday.

“This is a person of experience, a great servant of the state, who has 
demonstrated his exceptional personal and professional qualities in all the 
high functions he has occupied,” Ouattara said in a speech to lawmakers.

In Duncan, Ouattara – himself an economist and former senior International 
Monetary Fund official – has chosen a vice-president largely in his own image.

The post of vice-president was included in a new constitution enacted in 
November <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37834595> to help ensure a 
smooth succession of power in the event the sitting president dies or is 
incapacitated while in office. It has also been seen by many in Ivory Coast as 
a vehicle to allow Ouattara to groom a successor for when he finishes his 
second and final term in 2020.

Duncan dissolved the government on Monday, a move that had been expected after 
last month’s election but which was delayed by two days by an army mutiny.
