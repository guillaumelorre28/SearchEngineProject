‘When you put (a hoodie) on, with the hood … the whole thing moves up. It 
gives you that attitude.” Those are the words ofDemna Gvasalia 
<http://www.vogue.com/13357449/balenciaga-artistic-director-vetements-demna-gvasalia/>
, the Vetements and Balenciaga designer, explaining the current appeal of the 
hoodie earlier this month. The hoodie,he told the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/fashion/balenciagas-demna-gvasalia.html?_r=0>
, is “a very complex garment”.

Gvasalia’s adoption of “that attitude” has raised interests and eyebrows. As 
an unofficial sequel to thealpha, oversized black piece worn by Kanye West and 
Rihanna 
<http://www.vogue.com/13298406/rihanna-kanye-west-vetements-celebrity-street-style/>
, the hoodies that Vetements debuted at Paris fashion week were playfully 
nihilistic. There was a cherry-red one bearing the legend: “MAY THE BRIDGES I 
BURN LIGHT THE WAY 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/vetements/slideshow/collection#25>
”, and the aubergine bomber hoodie that featured the ghoulish message “Drink 
from me And live forever 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/vetements/slideshow/collection#32>
”, which unintentionally recalled the climatic scene in Zoolander 2. Both were 
worn with the hoods very much up.

everybody wears a hoodie. “Having a hoodie in a fashion range now is the norm,” 
says Claudine Rousseau, who teaches fashion sportswear design at the London 
College of Fashion. “It’s like having jeans in your range.”

It is, you’d imagine, what the New York label Champion 
<http://www.hanes.com/champion> dreamed of when it created the hoodie in the 
early 1930s as a piece of sports and utility wear. When the brand began selling 
them, they did well with students and labourers, before they started being worn 
by members of the upper class on both sides of the Atlantic.

“For decades and decades, the hoodie had a reputation of being worn by sporty, 
preppy people and British Peerages,” saysAlison Kinney, author of Hood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/10/hood-by-alison-kinney-review>. 
She adds that a few years ago Vogue published a photograph from the early 60s of
Princess Diana as a toddler wearing a black hoodie

Hood by Alison Kinney review – power, anonymity … what do hoods symbolise?

By the 70s, the meaning of the hoodie was morphing into what we associate it 
with today. On the silver screen, icons including Rocky Balboa and Obi-Wan 
Kenobi were wearing them victoriously and transformatively, while back on the 
home front they had become everyday wear. “That’s when the switchover 
happened,” says Rousseau. “It went from being an item of sportswear to being 
worn as an item of normal clothing and, ultimately, a part of the working-class 
uniform.”

The new visual identity (Adidas hoodie, joggers and a pair of Reeboks) 
appeared without reference to sport. “By the early 80s no one was sweating in 
their hoodies, they were wearing them in the daytime around the house.”

It was also the beginning of the demonisation of the garment. Things 
crescendoed in the noughties, when “hoodie” became a pejorative term. With Tony 
Blair pushing his agenda against binge-drinking youths, the garment evoked “the 
culture of disrespect”. Bluewater shopping centre in Kent banned them in May 
2005, while some police forcesimplemented a stop and search policy over 
teenagers who wore them 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/4365542.stm>. “Hoodies” 
(spelt with a horrified capital H), we were being told, were now a marauding 
youth tribe intent on destroying the essential fabric of our society.

“Most teenage robbers dress in a similar way,” explained Detective Inspector 
Alan Postawa to the BBC in October of that same year,after a police crackdown 
on “Hoodies” in Luton 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/4365542.stm>. “So 
targeting these types of clothes may prevent offences as well as detect them. 
It is disturbing that many criminals do wear this type of clothing, but our 
first responsibility is to protect the public.” Kinney says: “Suddenly, the 
hoodie had all these traits: dangerous, pathological and criminal.” A year 
later, David Cameron gave what became known as the“hug a hoodie” speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jul/09/conservatives.ukcrime>, 
intended to encourage more understanding of why young people turn to crime.

In the context of the #Blacklivesmatter movement, the hoodie became heavily 
symbolic. Jeff Raines, of the Million Hoodies Movement for Justice, says: “The 
hoodie has been a symbol of black and brown communities’ presumed guilt and 
criminality in white America. The Million Hoodies Movement for Justice was 
founded in the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death, who was murdered because someone 
thought he looked ‘suspicious’ in his hoodie. Our communities should not have 
to change how they dress in order to not be shot and killed.”

In the UK, at least, the hoodie’s symbolism has shifted from the criminal 
towards something more prosaic that even members of the Royal Family (Prince 
Harry and the Queen, who has been photographedwearing one behind the wheel 
<http://images.christianpost.com/full/55059/queen-elizabeth-ii.png?w=262>) 
wear. While on the catwalk, as the Vetements show proves, it remains a garment 
of individualism, authenticity and IDGAF attitude.
