Clothing and homeware retailer Next has cut its guidance for annual sales for 
the second time in less than two months 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/24/next-warns-of-toughest-trading-since-financial-crisis-and-cuts-sales-forecast>
 after a disappointing first quarter of the year.

Cold, damp weather in March and April

 reduced demand for clothing over the past six weeks, Next said. Though sales 
have improved in the past few days as weather has improved, the company said 
demand for clothes could stay weak.

In the three months to 2 May, Next’s total sales fell by 0.2% and full-price 
sales dropped 0.9%, at the low end of full-year sales guidance of -1% to +4%.

As a result, Next cut its annual guidance for full-price sales to between 
-3.5% and +3.5%. It slashed its previous guidance in March when Lord Wolfson, 
the company’s chief executive,predicted this year would be the most difficult 
since the financial crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/24/next-warns-of-toughest-trading-since-financial-crisis-and-cuts-sales-forecast>
.

The company said it was “unlikely but possible” that sales would deteriorate 
further and the poor performance of the last six weeks could indicate a weaker 
underlying demand for clothing and potentially a wider consumer slowdown.

Wolfson said: “It’s unquestionably a combination of the weather and the 
economy. It’s difficult to know how much of either it is but the fact that 
sales are so weather dependent - on warm days sales go up significantly - is an 
indicator of the economy as people are only buying when they need to.”

He said wider economic indicators, such as real earnings and manufacturing 
output also suggested the UK could be headed for another recession.

Next <https://www.theguardian.com/business/next> stunned the City in late 
March when it slashed sales forecasts for the year and predicted tough trading 
caused by the slowing economy and falling consumer confidence. Wolfson, a keen 
observer of consumer trends, said this year “may well feel like walking up the 
down escalator”.


Since Wolfson’s warning, other fashion retailers have reported difficult 
trading amid concernsabout the health of the high street

 and consumer confidence. Primarkreported its first fall in half-year sales for

 andDebenhams has said conditions are difficult.

Next said it reduced its forecasts again this week after erratic sales figures 
over six weeks and that business had picked up significantly as warmer spring 
weather arrived. The company gives clearer guidance than most big companies and 
a scheduled trading statement arrived at the end of a particularly weak period.

Wolfson that there was clearly a shift in consumer spending away from clothing 
towards other priorities such as eating out, housing and cars but he didn’t 
think the shift was permanent or that we hadreached “peak stuff”, as some 
commentators have suggested

.

“I think that’s an easy conclusion to draw whenever there is a slowdown but 
these things go in cycles,” said Wolfson.

“Because fashion is a crowd activity, if you get a long period where the 
weather is not appropriate to buying new clothes and you don’t see other people 
wearing new clothes you are less likely to buy them yourself. It’s very 
unlikely it’s permanent.”




Some analysts have argued that Wolfson, a Tory peer, has used the economy and 
the weather to cover for Next’s own problems, including the declining 
performance of its directory catalogue business and under investment in mobile 
technology - the fastest growing sales route. Wolfson admitted in March that 
the company had work to do to overhaul its products and systems.


On Wednesday, Wolfson said that sales at Next were likely to have been 
affected by a number of factors beyond the weather including a slight increase 
in discounting across the high street over Easter. The chain does not offer 
discounts in its stores except at the end of July and after Christmas.

Wolfson said Next had gained from relaunching its mobile website in March and 
improving product availability for the Directory in recent weeks.

James McGregor, a parner at consultancy Retail Remedy, said: “It was 
inevitable that the weather would feature in some way in Next’s trading update 
and we have not been disappointed.


“If Next have been challenged by the unseasonal weather this season, then we 
can assume that the majority of fashion retailers are really suffering. Ever 
cautious, we are not surprised to hear Lord Wolfson warn of difficult trading 
ahead.”


Next shares, which have lost almost a third of their value this year, rose 
2.4% in early trading.
