Hintze is an Australian-born, London-based businessman who runs the CQS group 
of companies. In 2014 the billionaire hedge fund manager gavethe Conservatives 
their single biggest donation for six years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/15/hedge-fund-conservatives-donation-michael-hintze-funding>
 – a £1.5m gift.

Just before the 2013 federal election, Hintze donated $75,000 to the 
Australian Liberal party

.

In 2014, he was appointed by the then treasurer, Joe Hockey, to the advisory 
panel for the government’s financial system inquiry

the speech Abbott gave to the CQS investor forum wasposted to his website

.

While at the Tory conference, Abbott sat on a panel sponsored by the Spectator 
with the UK government’s Brexit minister, David Davis. The former prime 
minister’s spokesman said Abbott “talked up Britain’s prospects after its 
departure from the European Union”.

Abbott produced a diary while on the UK trip that referred to his events in 
New York and London. They included a seminar on tensions between China and the 
US andan address in London to the UK-Australia chamber of commerce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/03/tony-abbott-says-australia-should-strike-shotgun-trade-deal-with-post-brexit-uk>
 on “a fast track Britain-Australia free-trade agreement”.

The diary gave some blunt advice to Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> and the trade 
minister, Steve Ciobo, declaring the trade agreement was the “one thing that 
you must drive that could permanently improve Anglo-Australian relations”. To 
Ciobo, Abbott said: “Don’t let officials bamboozle you with detail and with 
alternatives, just get this done!”

The update to Abbott’s pecuniary interest register comes as one of his 
longtime confidantes, Catherine McGregor,wrote a column in News Corp papers 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/opinion-why-tony-will-be-back-and-wont-be-saying-hasta-la-vista/news-story/b92d2ee0c30ae6a51e0e1d03e8c6a1e6>
 urging Turnbull to return Abbott to cabinet and give him responsibility for 
Indigenous affairs to heal the bad blood between the pair.

McGregor said Abbott was fully aware she was going to write the column.

Tensions between Abbott and Turnbull spilled over into a rebuke on the floor 
of the House of Representatives

 during the last parliamentary sitting week in Canberra.

Abbott was publicly taken to task by Turnbull, and directly contradicted by 
the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, and the justice minister, Michael 
Keenan, after a fortnight of provocative interventions on gun control and party 
reform in New South Wales, which were clearly intended to wrongfoot Turnbull.

Australia's political donations must be capped to fix 'broken' system, expert

After the confrontation in the last sitting week the Spectator Australia 
published an article headlined <http://spectator.com.au/2016/10/beyond-abbott/>
: “Time to start looking beyond Abbott.”

The piece by Terry Barnes said Abbott’s “prospects of leadership redemption 
have been damaged by last week, and many of his supporters are left 
disappointed and perplexed by what erupted from nowhere”.

Abbott’s recent behaviour has not won plaudits from his colleagues, even from 
conservative supporters, and some MPs see the McGregor column as an effort by 
Abbott to bargain for some kind of truce.

The prime minister meanwhile was asked during a radio interview in Adelaide 
whether he was concerned about becoming “Abbott lite”.

The context for the question was the whether the government was trying to 
appease the One Nation party through its latest policy that would ban boat 
arrivals from ever coming to Australia.

Turnbull said he knew the interviewer was “trying to get a rise out of me”.

“I’m focused on ensuring that we maintain what we have today: a most generous 
refugee program, the foundation of which is the integrity and security of our 
borders,” the prime minister said.
