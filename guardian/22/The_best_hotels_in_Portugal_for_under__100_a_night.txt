“Design” in the title of a hotel usually gives me the willies, but the cool 
Internacional Design Hotel is just about the right side of chilly – apart, that 
is, from the Lego bread baskets … It’s tremendous value considering the 
downtown location and upscale amenities on offer, and the hotel’s Bastardo 
restaurant and bar is a bona fide local hip hangout.

In the heart of this charming old town – once Portugal’s second city, near the 
border with Spain –Casa Melo Alvim is an early 16th-century mansion restored 
with delicacy (and entirely without frou-frou) in stone and clean wood. As well 
as 20 bedrooms there are a couple of loft-style apartments. Breakfast only, but 
there’s a small late bar. The train station is but a step away, the cathedral a 
short walk and Viana’s beaches are five minutes by water taxi.

Two metro stops from Porto’s centre, Castelo Santa Catarina is a crenellated 
Gothic palace set in its own mature gardens. What it lacks in polish and elan, 
it more than makes up for with bags of sincere and eccentric charm. Stay in the 
castle rooms to experience the fullcastelo effect. Owner João Brás offers a 
wealth of local tips that steer you far away from the downtown tourist crowds.

The Miss O’po guesthouse comprises three studios and two two-bed apartments, 
all done in concrete and steel, and with wit and warmth. Each room has a fine 
sound system, too. Downstairs is one of Porto’s coolest restaurants, plus a 
small exhibition and performance space. Co-owner Ana Luandina publishes the
Concrete Observer <http://www.missopo.com/en/content/concrete-observer> for her 
guests, a pamphlet of useful and unusual Porto ephemera.

Once the love nest of Inês de Castro – the 14th-century Portuguese queen who 
was crowned after her death – and later rebuilt in 18th century, former palace
Quinta das Lágrimas is now a small luxury hotel with 12 hectares of private 
botanical gardens in this fine university city. The Pedro e Inês restaurant has 
fine dining pretensions but casual prices plus a 600 bin wine list, with many 
bottles from the neighbouring Dão and Bairrada denominations.

Books, books and more books! They line every wall and are all yours to read at 
The Literary Man. Cosy up with one in front of the fire, retire to your 
eco-chic ex-nun’s cell, have a massage, eat seriously good local ingredients 
grilled over a Japanese kamado. And if all this isn’t enough, Óbidos (60 miles 
north of Lisbon) is Portugal’s chocolate capital.

Hotel Arribas is bang on the beach and has a huge sea-water pool. There’s a 
cheery terrace restaurant (average meal price €15pp including wine), a poolside 
coffee shop and a pleasing pastel colour scheme throughout. Honest, clean, 
friendly, very affordable and uncomplicated, this place is great for a family 
beach holiday and within 20 minutes of the Disney-esque fantasy palaces and 
museums at Sintra (by tram and bus). Lisbon is 40 minutes from Sintra by train 
(€2.15 one way).

Estoril is a smart beach resort 28 minutes by train from Lisbon. Famous for 
its casino, its wide, clean beaches make a sand-and-city break easily 
achievable.Hotel Londres is newly refurbished in beach-bright colours and 
remains absurdly good value. There’s a pool and gardens and it’s only a 
four-minute saunter to the beach and metro stop. Breakfasts only, but mere 
moments to local restaurants –Di Casa <http://www.dicasa.pt/> is an excellent, 
reasonable Italian.

The Costa Vicentina, in south-west Portugal, has some of Europe’s best surf, 
its emptiest beaches and finest walking.Herdade do Touril is a 365-hectare farm 
two minutes’ drive from the usually empty Praia de Tonel and is 4km from 
sleepy, surfy Zambujeira. There’s a mixture of farmhouse-style double and 
family rooms (these with kitchenettes) and small houses. All have private 
terraces.

, into a welcoming B&B that serves the breakfasts of champions and convivial 
three-course country dinners (€15 including wine and coffee). The hotel’s name 
means The Lost Lobster. There are no lobsters in Montesinho, or anywhere near

Casa De Pomarchão is a 15th-century baronial home that was enlarged in 1775 in 
the curly, knobbly Pombaline style. There are seven rooms and apartments, all 
furnished in the classic north Portuguese fashion – think lots of dark polished 
wood. There’s a private chapel, a swimming pool in the old well-fed cistern, 
and breakfasts featuring home-baked cakes. It’s a 30-minute saunter to 
gracious, riverside Ponte de Lima, reputedly Portugal’s oldest village.

Bouça d’Arques is a 300-year-old manor house surrounded by vineyards that’s 
been enlarged with a few bold, tasteful architectural additions in iron, glass 
and concrete. On the estate there are seven sweet letting houses, all but one 
with private terraces. There’s a chlorine-free eco-pool, and breakfasts (with 
very beautiful homemade jams, local cheeses and farm-cured meats) are delivered 
to your house. Bouça d’Arques is close to Viana do Castelo, and on the edge of 
a magical small forest. The beaches of Afife, Carreço and Pâço are 15 minutes’ 
drive away.

A crenellated, isolated mini-manor house full of atmosphere and antiques, Casa 
Levada is now run as a B&B by Maria and Luis Mota, he the great nephew of poet 
Teixeira de Pascoaes, who used to summer here. They’re a charming couple who 
often join guests for meals and conversation (dinner supplement €20 including 
wine). Forty miles inland from Porto, the hotel features massive stone lintels, 
wooden shutters, polished wood floors and painted and panelled wooden ceilings. 
It’s toasty warm thanks to a roaring fire in winter, and naturally cool 
throughout in summer. This is a great base from which to explore the Douro.

The Solar Egas Moniz calls itself a “charming hotel”. Charming hotel? Yes, 
actually. Chic but not twee, the hotel is 30 minutes from Porto, close to the 
grandly be-churched town of Penafiel. Egas Moniz was tutor to Portugal’s first 
king, and the hotel runs tutored wine tastings in the wonderfulenoteca where 
substantialpetiscos (snacks) like bacalhão gratin are served to soak up the 
glasses you forget to spit. The emphasis is on wellbeing and wine – for many of 
us, the same thing.

Nature expert Frank McClintock came here in 1987, fell in love with the place 
and its peace, and builtQuinta do Barranco da Estrada, a charming nine-room 
hideout, 45 miles north of Portimão. He’s a leadingbirdwatching guide 
<http://www.birdinginportugal.com/> but this is also a wonderful place for 
non-twitchers. Borrow canoes, a dinghy or stand-up paddleboards from the 
floating jetty, or hang out in the sauna or the gardens. Lunch is €15, dinner 
€22.50 plus drinks.

New in 2015, Vinha do Gaiao is an organic agriturismo on the southern slopes 
of the Serra de Monchique, within easy striking distance of the western 
Algarve’s beaches and sights. Six chic doubles, all but one with room for an 
extra bed, are tacked onto an old farmstead. Design is sensitive, modern and 
minimal, and most rooms have distant sea views. The quinta runs courses in 
pastry baking, organic farming andmacramé (making clothes using knotting 
instead of knitting). The spa at eccentric Portmerion-like Termas de Monchique 
(€20 for as long as you like in the pool, sauna and steam, including a mad 
15-minute hydro-massage) is a 10-minute drive away.
