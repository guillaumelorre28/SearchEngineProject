All hail the jazz-brow. Bored of trying to Delevingne your brows? The A/W 
catwalks were full of alternatives, my current favourite being Giambattista 
Valli’s finely pencilled curve, with the added pizzazz of a sparkly swoosh 
underneath, to show that despite the careful pencilling, you still have a wild 
side.
