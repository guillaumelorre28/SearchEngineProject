There was a time when the things a man wore under his outer clothing were 
white, shapeless, and woolly. Their sole purpose was to keep him warm. They 
were unseen and therefore their appearance was subordinate to their practical 
application.


Things have changed. The formerly blanched counters of the underwear 
departments are a blaze of colours and patterns. Mundane nouns like combs and 
underpants have given way to briefs, shorts, and, yes, slips – French slips, 
mini-slips, and see-through slips. A slip is apparently not something nice 
ladies wear any more, it is a handful of nylon cut into the smallest bikini 
that a man’s anatomy will allow and stretched round his hips like a “G” string.

The reason for the flowering of men’s undergarments is difficult to arrive at. 
There is the theory that current moral climate increases the possibility that 
his underwear is likely to be seen by a more varied range of acquaintances, and 
his ego demands that if he should be so lucky, paisley pants and a two-tone 
vest add a touch of class to the adventure.

A more plausible reason is that our comfortable, flapping underpants have been 
let down by foreigners. Those damned froggies have invaded the hosiery 
departments with neatly boxed fripperies whose brevity is compensated for by 
butch brand names like Hom and Eminence. So if you can’t beat ‘em join ‘em: the 
men’s underwear counters of Marks and Spencer and British Home Stores are now 
the most colourful parts of the shops and countless back street makers-up are 
churning out those coloured singlets that every disco dandy is wearing.

Twelve years ago Terry Shaw and Alan Deeks started up a company called Mark 
Christian. Their speciality was novelty underwear which then, even for Soho, 
was catering for a small and rather peculiar market. Now their machine rooms 
are throbbing as machinists sew like mad to keep up with orders from such 
places as Japan, America, and the Persian Gulf. They are undercutting the 
French manufacturers by almost half and their only problem is the shortage of 
materials, which in view of the size of their garments is surprising.

At home the market has grown considerably since the men’s undies couturier 
became acceptable to suburbia. It seems that wives buy the most unsuitable 
creations for their husbands in much the same way as husbands buy frothy 
negligees for them at Christmas. Office managers get presents from the typing 
pool with slogans and motifs printed on them that are more suitable for the 
rugby dressing room.

A hosiery shop is the Strand which carries a large stock of the more startling 
designs is now finding that they are selling to a wide cross-section of 
“ordinary” men. So if the boss is one those who frown when you wear a red tie, 
you can secretly defy his conservatism by wearing the latest see-through 
mini-slip.
