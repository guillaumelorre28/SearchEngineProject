Your editorial on national anthems (5 January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-national-anthems-patriotism-cannot-be-enforced>
) reminds me of imprisoned conscientious objectors in 1916. In the face of 
taunts that they were unpatriotic, they promoted a vision of a nation based 
on equity and internationalism. One wrote on the wall of his cell in Richmond 
Castle, “Let the nations see that men should brothers be” – lines from an 
official verse of the national anthem, written by William Hickson in 1836. 
Hickson wrote other verses, too. My favourite ends: “May peace her sway extend, 
Foe be transformed to friend, And Britain’s power depend on war no more.” What 
a difference it would make to the national psyche if every time we sang the 
national anthem we sang “May Britain’s power depend on war no more”.
