Scorsese is in repentance mode with this austere, spiritual drama. Two 
Portuguese missionaries (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) are smuggled into 
17th-century Japan, where Christians are violently persecuted, in search of a 
padre who’s apparently gone native. What follows is an earnest study of faiths 
– in crisis and in conflict. Non-believers may tire of its longueurs, but it’s 
a film of depth and devotion.Out on Sun

The prospect of fresh Star Wars characters, locations and hardware is all many 
punters need. But despite the retrograde male domination (Felicity Jones 
excepted), this spinoff is pacy, action-packed, and rendered with a conviction 
that most effects movies lack.

The bestselling video game becomes a Matrix-like epic, throwing Michael 
Fassbender between high-tech prison movie and Spanish Inquisition swashbuckler. 
The complex mythology takes some explaining (it’s all to do with a secret 
Assassins v Templars war), but the action scenes are exhilarating, with rooftop 
and horseback chases that look agreeably non-digital.Out on Sun

This oddball French comedy contains hints of both Robert Bresson and Wes 
Anderson in its deadpan story of a young man seeking the identity of his 
father. Drawing on a range of cultural references, not least the Bible, it’s 
sophisticated without being pretentious.

It’s not going to win any awards, but this Meet The Parents-style bromance is 
funny enough to pass muster. James Franco was possibly the only option for the 
part of an overbearing zillionaire dude, whose proposal to Bryan Cranston’s 
daughter is not exactly welcomed.
