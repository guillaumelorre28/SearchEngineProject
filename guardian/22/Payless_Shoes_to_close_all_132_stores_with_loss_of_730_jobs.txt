Payless Shoes is expected to close all of its 132 stores in February after the 
administrators were unable to find a buyer for the retailer.

Administrator Ferrier Hodgson says about 730 staff will be affected and that 
employee entitlements are expected to be paid in full, although some jobs could 
still be saved if the business can be broken up and sold piecemeal.

“While we received a number of expressions of interest from various parties, 
there were no acceptable offers for the business as a whole,” administrator Jim 
Sarantinos said in a statement.

“We would particularly like to thank the Payless Shoes employees for their 
support during the administration process.”

Australia’s first Payless Shoes store opened its doors in Sydney in 1980. In 
2013 the retail chain was bought by US-based Payless ShoeSource, which saved it 
from administration.
