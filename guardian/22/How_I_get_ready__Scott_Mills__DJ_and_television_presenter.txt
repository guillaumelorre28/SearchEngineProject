When I DJ at student gigs, I start getting ready in the car. My tour manager 
picks me up and drives me wherever I need to be. They can be quite long 
journeys so he plays mellow music like Magic FM. Half an hour before we arrive 
he switches to Radio 1; because it is usually a Friday or Saturday night, they 
will be playing pumping dance music. That’s when I know it’s time to get ready.

I bring a man bag with me in which I have my clothes, hair wax, hair spray, 
aftershave and a mirror. I will change out of my jogging bottoms into a fresh 
pair of jeans, a nice shirt and a new pair of socks (I can’t do a gig without 
new socks). When I arrive, I brush my teeth and I am ready to go.

I like to be tanned because I think everyone looks better with a tan. If I 
don’t have one, I will spray it on. Garnier do something called Face Mist which 
is good but don’t go too crazy with it. I’ve done that – it doesn’t work 
straight away so I used practically a whole can, to my cost later on that 
evening when I was getting darker by the minute. I make sure my teeth look good 
as I think they are really important. You can tell a lot about someone by their 
teeth. It is the second thing I notice after shoes. I am not a shoe snob but if 
your shoes are scruffy on a night out I think it says a lot.

after an interview and he was the best person I ever smelt. He told me he was 
wearing an aftershave called Creed and I was straight on it. It’s expensive but 
two sprays of that and you feel like a million dollars.
