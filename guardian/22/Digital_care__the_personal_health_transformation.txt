A century ago Australians counted infectious diseases like pneumonia, 
influenza and tuberculosis among our common killers.


Today, with improved sanitation, housing and vaccination we have one of the 
highest life expectancies in the world. But it is this same ageing population 
which means the biggest health challenges we face are increasingly 
lifestyle-related chronic diseases that have economists tipping medical costs 
to keep rising by billions every year.

Running alongside this demographic shift, however, is an explosion in 
connected technologies – known collectively as the “Internet of Things” – which 
is letting us take greater control over our personal health and help to ease 
the burden of an ever-stretched system.

It is a world generating millions of data points where sophisticated 
algorithms are enabling everything from more accurate diagnoses for cancers to 
predicting when a recovering patient at home is at risk of falling.

“We can actually see changes in the way people are sitting down, standing up, 
and moving about in their chairs,” Philips Personal Health Solutions CEO 
Caroline Clarke says. “By interpreting this data in the right way, we can see 
30 days in advance if someone’s health is deteriorating and is going to be in 
need for emergency transportation to the hospital.

“Prevention is one of the key trends we are seeing and that’s why we we’ve 
developed personal health programs to help address these issues.”


Clarke, who recently launched the company’s personal health programs, an 
integrated suite of digital health wearables and secure cloud-based personal 
motivation and coaching programs, says Australia is at a “tipping point” when 
it comes to managing our health.

She cites a recent report by Deloitte Australia on the healthcare outlook for 
the nation which projects our healthcare spend to hit $186.3 billion by 2018, 
up from $172 billion in 2013. But Clarke is confident the merging of 
professional and consumer healthcare spaces through connected technology will 
bridge the gap and help us live healthier for longer.

“We see that people are increasingly engaged in their personal health and want 
solutions that empower them to stay healthy and prevent illness,” she says.

“We will collect and combine the data coming from your personal health 
measurement devices with clinical data coming from EMRs (electronic medical 
records) and are combining this with advanced analytics. This will help build 
new, innovative patient-centric and collaborative models of health management 
and predictive care.”

The wearable devices include a wristwatch to monitor heart rates and oxygen 
levels as well as recording lifestyle factors like how you are eating, sleeping 
and how active you are. The data is then sent via Bluetooth to a smartphone app 
which offers personal lifestyle coaching programs specially developed with 
clinicians and psychologists.

Other monitoring programs help patients move out of the hospital to recover at 
home faster after medical procedures.

The Deloitte Australia report has identified technologies like these as one 
way to improve lives for patients and also ease the unsustainable burden on the 
healthcare system, particularly at pressure points like hospital admissions.

Report contributing author and Deloitte Australia health information 
technology lead Alan Eckstein says healthcare still lags behind other 
industries in embracing the digital age, with fax machines still being used to 
integrate acute facilities with primary care.

“Thankfully in the last couple of years we have seen a lot more interest in 
investment in information technology,” Eckstein says. “The big focus over the 
last five years has been increasingly connecting the islands of data that exist 
across the health sector.

“We are following the path of our colleagues in the US where this information 
has been increasingly connected and it now allows us to unlock the real value 
in that data. I predict as we move towards the more data-focused activity we 
will see a lot more excitement in this space.”

Eckstein says these changes are being driven by increased consumer awareness 
of personalised care and also a generational shift in the medical community, 
with younger doctors more ready to embrace connected solutions.

“The emergence of the health consumer basically means that the old ways are 
not sustainable and won’t be tolerated,” he says. “I’ve spent a lot of time in 
hospitals and we’ve seen the younger doctors are a lot more excited and engaged 
with these sorts of developments.”

At a consumer level, he suggests healthcare can learn from other industries, 
like aviation, in using the digital revolution to enable customers take 
personal charge of more services.

“That linkage of providers is something we can learn from. Why not be able to 
schedule your own healthcare appointments, or look at the results of your tests 
from at home as well? Or complete the pre-admission paperwork before you go for 
a procedure from within your GP’s office via the web?”

Caroline Clarke says this philosophy is at the heart of Philips personal 
health programs to make the data points meaningful to the consumer and the 
clinician.
Wearables 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/a-healthier-brighter-future/ep7/wearables.html>
She says the real-time information is stored in a highly secure environment 
and is entirely owned by the individual but may be shared with their doctor to 
be combined with other digital health information.

And while these medically-certified devices can be used by anyone as a 
motivational tool to improve personal health, the wearables and coaching 
programs are “very much aimed at people who have high-risk profiles”.

“They have potentially hypertension, high cholesterol – key risk factors for 
example for cardiac disease. There is a genuine real need for them to make 
changes in their lifestyle to prevent an incident.”

With obesity a key risk factor for a range of chronic conditions in Australia 
Philips has also partnered with Weight Watchers with consumer products to help 
encourage healthier ways to prepare food.

Weight Watchers Australasia marketing and commercial business director Tony 
Karras says the “points system” allocated for different meals and cooking 
methods gives members clear, measurable goals and the opportunity to make 
healthier choices.

“We give them what a well-balanced diet looks like if you are on a weight loss 
journey,” Karras says. “A product like an air fryer, which uses substantially 
less oil, has an advantage to them over traditional cooking methods so it just 
gives them more options.”

The company also uses apps as a clear way of tracking progress and a 
motivational tool, he says.

While the trend towards taking greater charge of our personal health seems to 
be snowballing, in the same way we have embraced tech like mobile phones and 
tablets, for Alan Eckstein this is only the beginning.

“What I’m particularly excited by is the integration of research and clinical 
care,” he says. “And the application of analytics tools leveraging granular 
data – often including genomic data – to improve healthcare delivery. That is a 
very timely application of big data.”

Eckstein says cognitive computing platforms are also helping to augment human 
intelligence from diagnosis to predicting outcomes in the ICU before a 
procedure.

“Cognitive computing is one of those gut-feel things – we know it’s going to 
be big but we just have to work out exactly what it’s going to do in health. 
There are some amazing applications already within the oncology space in the US 
where we see cognitive platforms now being embedded to support decision-making.

“This is all now stuff. The impediment is not the technology or the data. The 
impediment is still the competition for funding or for investment in 
technology. But we are seeing a shift – that reality is shifting as people work 
out there are opportunities through innovation.”

Clarke adds: “It’s a really exciting space to be in. I think there’s nothing 
more rewarding than being able to get up in the morning and come to work to 
know that you are making a difference to the world and to populations and 
improving the lives of millions of people. Technology and digital health will 
enable many, many more people around the world to have access to healthcare.”
