The employment tribunal judges who ruled that the Uber drivers are not 
self-employed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status>
and should be paid the “national living wage” were scathing in their assessment 
of the company. Among the most unequivocal sections of the judgment were the 
following:

Any organisation ... resorting in its documentation to fictions, twisted 
language and even brand new terminology, merits, we think, a degree of 
scepticism.

The notion that Uber <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber> in London 
is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common ‘platform’ is to our 
minds faintly ridiculous.

Ms Bertram [Uber’s regional general manager for the UK] spoke of Uber 
assisting the drivers to “grow” their businesses, but no driver is in a 
position to do anything of the kind, unless growing his business simply means 
spending more hours at the wheel.

Reflecting on the [Uber] case, and on the grimly loyal evidence of Ms Bertram 
in particular, we cannot help being reminded of Queen Gertrude’s most 
celebrated line: ‘The lady doth protest too much, methinks’.

The absurdity of these propositions [Uber’s arguments on the contract between 
drivers and passengers] speaks for itself.

We are satisfied that the the supposed driver/passenger contract is a pure 
fiction which bears no relation to the real dealings and relationships between 
the parties.

It is not real to regard Uber as working ‘for’ the drivers ... the only 
sensible interpretation is that the relationship is the other way around.
