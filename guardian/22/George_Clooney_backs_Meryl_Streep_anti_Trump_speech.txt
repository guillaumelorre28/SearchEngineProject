<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/09/donald-trump-calls-meryl-streep-over-rated-golden-globes-twitter>
 to describe Streep as overrated after she used her platform at the Golden 
Globes to condemn his imitation of a disabled reporter and accuse him of 
spreading hate and violence.

“Aren’t you supposed to be running the country?” said Clooney in response. “I 
didn’t vote for him, I don’t support him, I don’t think he’s the right choice.

“At this moment in our lives we have to hope that he doesn’t destroy 
everything. The reality is you have to hope he will do a decent job because if 
the United States fails, really terrible things happen, so you have to hope 
that he can.”

But he added: “I don’t see any signs of it.”

Clooney suggested that after a lucky run of previous presidents including 
Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt and Kennedy, America had got “a little unlucky 
with Bush” and that “I think we’re going to be a little unlucky now.”

Clooney was speaking at a reception for a Netflix 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix> documentary, The White Helmets, 
which follows the lives of the rescue volunteers in Syria. The actor recently 
acquired the rights to make a fiction film based on the documentary, but said 
it was still in very early stages.

Clooney said the film would be done in Arabic with English subtitles and that 
he intended to involve “as many Syrian people and [as much] Syrian talent as we 
can”.

Clooney said that bringing public attention to the bravery of people such as 
the White Helmets was one good way he could use his public platform.

“The only reason that people who are well known should be involved in these 
kinds of things is when no one knows about them,” he said.

“I can’t change policy but I can make things louder. The filmmakers, they are 
the brave ones, they are the ones who are doing all the work and are the 
heroes. So if I can help them out at all so people know about it, then that’s a 
good use of celebrity I think.”
