Susanna Rustin’s article on Winifred Holtby (Scenes from provincial life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/14/winifred-holtby-author-south-riding-feminist-campaigner>
, Review, 14 January) was excellent, except that it mentioned only two 
dramatisations of Holtby’s novel South Riding – the 1938 film and the BBC’s 
2011 adaptation. Good though these were, there must be many people like myself, 
born and brought up in the area, who feel that both were outshone by Yorkshire 
TV’s 1974 serial. It was adapted from the novel by Stan Barstow and superbly 
acted by a cast including Dorothy Tutin, Nigel Davenport, Hermione Baddeley and 
Clive Swift. Much of it was filmed locally, and it captured the atmosphere of 
the area and the essence of the East Riding characters brilliantly. It can 
still be watched with pleasure and it deserved to be mentioned.
