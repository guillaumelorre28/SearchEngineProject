‘What the world needs is more aspirational lifestyle brands,” said no one at 
any point in the last six months. This is why a return to activewear with a 
function – more “ath” than “leisure” – is something to be noted. You can just 
mess about in it, but Outdoor Voices (a New York brand which launches in the UK 
on Wednesday) advises wearing it for stuff such as badminton and playing 
frisbee. It also looks nice, with lots of sharp silhouettes, understated 
colours and two-tone shading in grey, pink and beige. It’s sort of Yeezy-wear 
without the price tag and without the queueing. The hooded tops, in particular 
– called “Catch Me If You Can” hoodies – are even quite Vetements. There, we 
said it.
