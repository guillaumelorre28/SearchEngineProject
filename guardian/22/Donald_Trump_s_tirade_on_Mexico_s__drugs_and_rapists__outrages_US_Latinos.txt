Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has been 
labelled an “extremely silly man” by America’s largest Latino civil rights 
organisation after claiming that Mexico is sending “rapists” to the US.

While Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> such as 
Jeb Bush are going out of their way to attract the increasingly important 
Hispanic vote in 2016 – Bush delivered some of his launch speech in Spanish – 
Trump appeared to be heading in a different direction with his campaign launch 
on Tuesday.

“[Mexico] are sending people that have lots of problems, and they are bringing 
those problems to us. They are bringing drugs, and bringing crime, and their 
rapists,” the business mogul said.

Such claims were “absurd”, said Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for the National 
Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organisation.

“This is a man who has a pathological need for attention,” said Navarrete. “I 
look at him as a two-year-old who will say a naughty word to get their parents’ 
attention. That’s what he’s doing.”

Trump has toyed with running for president since the 1980s. He has said he was 
considering a bid during almost every election cycle since 2000. Tuesday’s 
event at Trump Tower represents the first time he has fully outlined his 
policies and political beliefs.

He aimed specific ire at Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico>, 
claiming he would build a “great, great wall” on the Mexican-American border, 
and accusing the country of sending “not the right people” to the US.

“The US has become a dumping ground for everyone else’s problems,” he said.

Navarrete said the claim that Mexicans seeking work in America were rapists 
was “offensive”.

“This is an exceedingly silly man, who has no idea what he’s talking about,” 
she said.

 A brief history of Donald Trump’s presidential aspirations – video 
Navarrete said although Trump’s statements had “no basis in fact”, they fitted 
in with a perception of the party he sought to represent.

“Part of the reason why Latinos are so alienated from the Republican party 
these days is there’s a sense that there are people who actually believe [what 
Trump said],” she said.

“I’m hoping that the saner, more rational people in the Republican party can 
put a stop to this kind of thing, and say: ‘No, we’re going to be constructive, 
we’re not going to needlessly and consciously alienate the fastest-growing 
group of voters in this country.”
