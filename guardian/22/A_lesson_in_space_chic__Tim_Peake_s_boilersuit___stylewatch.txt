Forget the Christmas onesie – it’s Tim Peake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/tim-peake> for the fashion all-in-one win 
this month. The British astronaut may have had little to do with his choice of 
boilersuit but his chirpy wave says that he knows he’s nailed it on the 
wardrobe front. Well, that’s the way Stylewatch is interpreting this landmark 
moment in UK space history anyway. In the spirit of seasonal goodwill, allow us 
to impose our sartorial agenda on the situation.

First, that’s a really “now” blue, Tim. Less safe than navy, classier than 
pastel, it’s practically cerulean blue – the blue du jour. Second, those 
patches. Who cares what they represent? They’re a clear shout out to JW 
Anderson’s designs with their space-obsessed-teenager vibes. Third? Top Gun. 
It’s a fashion reference point that few of us can get past.

Space chic is having an alpha moment on the catwalk at the moment, mainly 
because Louis Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquière is really into it. Research 
shows that Peake’s suit is practically the workwear reprisal ofexit 4
