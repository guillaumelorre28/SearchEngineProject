Richie Porte’s hopes of winning an Olympic medal in Rio were dashed in a 
downhill crash in the men’s road race that left the Australian cyclist in 
hospital nursing a broken scapula.

Porte, who arrived in Brazil as a strong medal hope after finishing fifth in 
the recent Tour de France, crashed on the second of three descents from the 
steep Vista Chinese climb, injuring his right shoulder.

“We were away with a small group on the descent and on one of the corners I 
came around and there was a guy on the road who crashed and I had nowhere to 
go,” Porte told the Australian Olympic Committee. “It was fortunate a tree 
stopped me from going over the side.

“I’m bruised and battered and sore and I’m disappointed but lucky I’m not 
worse off. I hit it with a fair bit of speed and it’s really disappointing 
because the guys were good all day looking after me and then for this to 
happen, it hurts.”

The blow also puts him out of the time trial, leaving just Rohan Dennis – who 
pulled out of Saturday’s race – to fly the flag for Australia in the one 
remaining men’s road cycling event.

Porte was well placed with less than 40km left in the brutal 237.5km race, 
sitting in the main peloton as it chased a leading group of five riders, 
despite his chain twice falling off earlier.


No Australians featured among the top finishers, with Belgian Greg van 
Avermaet claiming the gold.

Simon Clarke, who was called into the Australian squad at the last minute 
after Simon Gerrans broke his collarbone, came in 25th.

The time trial takes place on Wednesday.
