Winning tip: La Vallée des Saints, Carnoët

This is a hill in central Brittany, topped with a tree-crowned motte, and all 
around are three- and four-metre granite statues of Breton saints. There are 
currently 63, individually carved on site by a team of sculptors. Come 
September there will be 80. The founders plan, eventually, to erect 1,000. It’s 
magical, like witnessing the beginnings of Easter Island.

 The Paon lighthouse, Ile de Bréhat. Photograph: Alamy 
The Ile de Bréhat lies just a mile off Brittany’s north coast, reached by 
ferry from Paimpol. This car-free island has sub-tropical plants growing in 
profusion and miles of rugged coast to explore. You may meet a circus of 
puffins as you hike to the lighthouse with views of the Breton mainland. For an 
overnight stay, there’s a fine municipal campsite and some charmingchambres 
d’hotes, and the reward is magical: the setting sun turns the pink granite 
rocks an even deeper shade of rose.

Unexpected discoveries often prove the most rewarding, and so it was when we 
stayed at this charming B&B in the fishing port of Cancale, 10 miles east of 
Saint-Malo. The house takes its name from its friendly and attentive owner, who 
serves a delicious breakfast in your room while you look across the bay towards 
the medieval towers of Mont Saint-Michel.

Walk past Cancale’s seafront restaurants selling expensive fruits de mer and 
buy oysters at the small market on the quay for around 50 cents each. Sit on 
the sea wall with a plateful and half a lemon, and afterwards throw your shells 
on to the beach to join the thousands already there – perfect!

 Canal d’Ille et Rance near Dinan. Photograph: Alamy 
The towpaths on Brittany’s 600km of canals are part of the Voies Vertes (Green 
Ways) network, and cycling or walking them is a delight. Lock houses and 
bridges are festooned with flowers; kingfishers and otters abound. Our 
favourite is the Canal d’Ille et Rance. Medieval Dinan and Léhon are close by 
and there is the livelyJazz aux Ecluses  
<http://www.jazzauxecluses.fr/jazzauxecluses.fr/Bienvenue.html>festival every 
September at the Hédé Bazouges flight of 11 locks. A a houseboat is a good 
alternative to a gîte or tent.

My son and I spent a week on this beautiful and unspoilt island last year and 
saw it all on hired bicycles. We stayed at the hotelLa Désirade 
<http://www.hotel-la-desirade.com/en>, where the food was exquisite, but too 
extravagant for every evening, so we also enjoyed a few galettes and beers at 
the nearby crêpérie. No wonder artists such as Claude Monet and Sarah Bernhardt 
flocked here and some decided to stay. The light, space and natural beauty are 
irresistible.

 Is it a church, or a bar? Bisected room in the Erik Satie Museum, Honfleur. 
Photograph: Alamy 
A wonderful example of how museums can bring their subjects to life. This is 
an enjoyable interactive tribute to the composer. One room is bisected by a 
trail of “wine”, spilt from a chalice. Step on one side and church music plays, 
illustrating his religious bent; step to the other, and you are surrounded by 
the sounds of a boisterous cafe. The whole museum is full of secret drawers and 
strange machines, and is a compelling way of spending a couple of hours.

Le Logis du Roc, Granville

Driving round the 15th-century ramparts of Granville, the satnav tells you to 
go over the narrow eastern drawbridge. “Surely we can’t fit through there?” But 
we do, and find ourselves in a maze of tiny 18th-century houses, with Le Logis 
du Roc B&B in the middle. It’s a narrow, sloping house, full of objects 
collected by owners Eric and Natalie on their travels to West Africa, 
Australia, Indonesia and India. Eric is a professional skipper and 
entertainingly talks of his adventures, while we shared whisky in his living 
room and watched their TV. We were also welcomed into the tiny bar next door – 
honorary Welsh guests for the Wales/Portugal, Euro quarter-final.

The cliff top path from Etretat to Fécamp via Yport (where you can stop for a 
bowl of mussels and a glass of cider) is an amazingly beautiful walk. In June 
there were wild flowers to enjoy, fields of flax just coming into bloom, 
gardens full of roses, bird song, and views. French footpaths are very 
well-maintained and signposted, so you can’t get lost and there are buses for 
your return journey. The whole walk is 17km, but can be shortened.
The walk is on the GR21 from Le Havre: gr-infos.com

In 1974 I went to study at Caen University and my memories of that time are of 
brown and white timbered farmhouses, orchards filled with apple blossom and the 
taste of fresh baguettes eaten with pont l’évêque cheese and washed down with 
calvados. I discovered the coast and the D-Day landing beaches, and joined in 
with the 30th anniversary celebrations on 6 June 1974, dancing the night away. 
William the Conqueror’sbirthplace at Falaise 
<http://www.chateau-guillaume-leconquerant.fr/index_uk.php> is worth a visit, 
as is his final resting place in L’Abbaye aux Hommes in Caen, but for a corner 
of tranquillity head south of Caen to Clécy in La Suisse Normande, to walk, 
kayak and climb the high rocks in the beautiful Orne valley.
