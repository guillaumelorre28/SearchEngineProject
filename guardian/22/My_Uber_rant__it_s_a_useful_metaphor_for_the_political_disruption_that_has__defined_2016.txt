In early 2015 I went to hear David Plouffe, one of the more celebrated 
purveyors of Obama fairy-dust, speak of his fine deeds and excellent adventures 
in political strategy.

It was a much-hyped, well-attended affair, but it soon became apparent Plouffe 
wasn’t there to talk about his prowess as head of Obama’s winning campaign in 
2008; rather he was in town proselytising his new boss, the then fledglingUber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber> car-sharing service.

Plouffe talked a massive game. Uber was the economic game-changer. It could 
drop into any city on earth and create 20,000 new jobs! Now! Jobs just like 
that! And the great part? You could work whenever you want for as long or as 
little as you want.

The crowd of earnest lefties sucked it all in as I got more and more angry – 
and not just because we had been dragged in under false pretences.

As someone who had worked with unions for more than two decades I saw 
something more sinister in his pitch. It was clear to me that these were not 
real jobs, they were simply tasks provided for a floating fee.

Uber was not the cool new idea Plouffe threw out. It was actually a pretty 
crappy old idea – undermining (or “disrupting” as the cool kids say) an 
existing industry by bypassing the network of regulations governing safety, 
licensing and workplace rights.

As Uber has grown I have watched more people I know become believers in the 
app, convinced it is a better service for them, delivering a far superior user 
experience. And who am I to say otherwise? I have refused to be seduced as a 
matter of political principle.

But I talk to cabbies whose life savings were invested in a set of plates 
whose value is now in free fall and drivers who haunt empty streets and openly 
contemplate packing it in.

The Uber-ites rationalise that the taxi business is crooked and Uber is just 
breaking the racket, and maybe they have a point there too.

But my frustration is they are making short-term choices with no long-term 
thoughts for the implications of their actions, which will inevitably lead to 
the destruction of the taxi industry and those who have relied on it as drivers 
and passengers.

The point of my Uber rant? It seems to me a useful metaphor for the political 
disruption that has defined politics in 2016 - the year that saw the slow drift 
away from major parties became a tidal wave of populism.

In Britain the Brexit was approved despite the two major parties uniting to 
support the remain vote with a ragtag of nationalist populists carried the 
argument.


In the United States, Donald Trump effectively Uber-ed his way into the White 
House by first disrupting the Republicans and then the Democrats and now the 
rest of the world.

And in Australia, the rise of independents and minor parties became a major 
phenomenon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/04/five-things-we-learned-from-the-2016-australian-election>
, with more than one third of voters turning their backs on the major parties, 
creating a complex web of blocks and personalities controlling a hung Senate.

If that’s not enough disruption, conservative forces are beginning to beat the 
drum for a breakaway rightwing party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/cory-bernardi-establishes-rightwing-movement-australian-conservatives>
, potentially unifying the rising One Nation with the increasingly emboldened 
right of Cory Bernardi, George Christensen and Tony Abbott.

And as this week’s Essential Report shows, such a party would have a 
formidable beachhead from day one:
If a new conservative party was formed and included people like Tony Abbott, 
how likely would you be to vote for them? 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1xn3A-HxtqZf2M6Jprlfz7U5njz4XZvKs0WUiA6moJvU>
Note that an even split of Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> voters say they would be 
likely and unlikely to vote for a New Right; while 25% of people currently 
voting for independents, One Nation and the Nick Xenophon Team would also be on 
board.

Labor has been facing a similar challenge to its left flank for the past three 
or four election cycles; exposed in its higher-income, educated inner cities to 
the Greens.

The cyclical debate on the left on whether there should be confrontation or 
coalition ebbs and flows, but progressive voters seem much more comfortable in 
shifting between the two.

Separate questions in this week’s report <http://www.essentialvision.com.au> 
show the electorate has no real clarity about where either of these parties is 
heading right now.

Indeed, as the below questions illustrate, more than 40% of voters say they 
are less likely to stick to one party than they were in the past, with an equal 
number saying they are more likely to vote for an independent or a minor party:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statements about voting? 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1O1B7T9njzRCpOxqvIFCiftzAQ7_WpkVSCod6NJAjMko>
On one reading, this is a positive sign; people are thinking more about their 
votes and less likely to stick to their ideological herd.

Like the taxi industry, it is fair to argue the major parties need a 
disruption, if only to punish them for their apparent complacency and lack of 
ambition for the nation.

But I think the events of this year show that fading loyalty to our 
established political parties can have negative consequences as well.

Like Uber, we are in an era where voters are more willing than ever to hitch a 
ride with the individual who tells them what they want to hear in the moment, 
and bugger the broader consequences.

Whether they are an eco-warrior or a straight-talking Tasmanian, a mining 
mogul or a human headline, the individual has become the compelling political 
storyline.

A politics of the individual is a politics of outrageous statements, confected 
outrage, a contest to see who can rail against the system the loudest. It’s 
compelling to make a noise from the outside – but it’s also easier than working 
inside a system of checks and balances and consequences.

I fear we could be losing something more profound with the decline of 
political parties that exist as member-based institutions, with real processes 
and real rules that create real platforms for running a real society – not an 
abstraction built on rhetoric and prejudice.

It is these processes that have been an effective bulwark against the cult of 
personality that elevates an individual to a sole political trader which 
history has shown invariably, if not inevitably, becomes hostile to the 
institutions that protect our values.

Maybe I’m the dinosaur here, standing on the corner and trying to hail a cab 
in a world where anyone else uses a cool new app; but I look at Uber and 
politics and 2016 and wonder if more disruption is really what the world needs 
now.
