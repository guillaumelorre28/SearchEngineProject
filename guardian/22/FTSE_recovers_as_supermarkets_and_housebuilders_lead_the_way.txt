 fromMorrisons has pushed its shares up 13.6p to 165.9p. Meanwhile Sainsbury, 
6.7p better at 250p was lifted by news of a good performance over Christmas, 
according to Kantar Worldpanel figures.Tesco shares also rose, up 9.15p to 
154.6p.

Housebuilders made gains in the wake of Taylor Wimpey’s update 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/11/taylor-wimpey-discount-homes-first-time-buyers>
 on Monday, as Jefferies issued a positive note. Analyst Anthony Codling said:

We start the year with a high level of conviction that the price of the UK 
housebuilders shares will outperform the overall UK stock market during 2016. A 
structural shortage of supply coupled with a very pro-homeownership Government 
and rising wages, provides fertile ground for share price growth, in our view. 
Cash generation is also high and highly visible and, in our view, dividend 
streams also underpin valuations...

We have sufficient confidence to increase our price targets by an average of 
18%, we believe that scarcity of supply of homes, mortgages and potential bank 
rate rises will favour the Help to Buy assisted new build market and raise the 
prospects of upgrades during 2016.

So Taylor Wimpey has added 3.7p to 198.6p, Barratt Development is 17p better 
at 611.5p andBerkeley Group is up 157p to £36.95.

Overall the FTSE 100 has added 63.08 points to 5934.91, despite weaker UK 
manufacturing figures.

Elsewhere British Airways owner International Airlines Group has climbed 17p 
to 606.5p amid the falling oil price, which should reduce its fuel costs. 
Barclays has also issued a positive note:

We reiterate overweight on IAG, with target price 750p. Having raised its 
midcycle margin and cashflow targets at the November capital markets day, and 
paid its first dividend in December, IAG continues to make excellent progress 
towards sustainable profitability, with clear scope for further cost savings. 
In 2016, the company will receive a major boost from lower fuel and, with capex 
guidance recently lowered, we think special dividends could be within sight.

Debenhams has jumped nearly 18% to 77.8p following a forecast-beating 1.9% 
rise in like for like sales in the 19 weeks to January 9.

But recruitment firm Michael Page is down 36.2p to 410.4p after it reported a 
0.5% fall in fourth quarter profits, with tough trading conditions in the UK 
and Asia. RivalHays has fallen 6.8p to 123.1p.

Greggs has dropped 97p to £11.28 after it left its full year forecast 
unchanged after fourth quarter sales growth slowed to 2.3%. Canaccord Genuity 
said:

Greggs’ interim management statement revealed trading had been tough in the 
fourth quarter as business flagged after a strong October, and as a 
consequence, results should be in line with expectations. We are top-of-range, 
so we are trimming our earnings per share forecasts by 1% to 55.3p for 2015 and 
by 3% to 58.4p for 2016.

We have shaved our target price by 25p [to £13.25] to reflect the downgrades 
but we retain our buy recommendation, as we believe there’s still plenty of 
momentum within the business.

Looking forward, there is still plenty to do. Greggs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/greggs> is only in the second year of a 
five-year plan to transform itself from a high street retailer to a bakery 
food-on-the-go operator.
