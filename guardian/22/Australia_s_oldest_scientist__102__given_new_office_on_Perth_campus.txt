A 102-year-old Perth <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/perth-news> 
man who is also Australia’s oldest scientist will get to keep an office on 
campus after Edith Cowan University reversed a decision that would have forced 
him to work from home.

Dr David Goodall was told in August that he had been deemed a health risk due 
to him taking about 90 minutes and four to five public transport changes to 
travel to the university’s northern suburban Joondalup campus.

The news gained international attention and debate about the treatment and 
value of older workers.

The university has now agreed to give him an office at its Mount Lawley 
campus, reducing his travel time.

Goodall’s career in ecology spans 70 years, and he is an honorary research 
associate in the centre of ecosystem management.

The university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Steve Chapman, said Goodall’s new 
location was next to the campus support office, ensuring colleagues would be 
present throughout the day if Goodall needed assistance.

“I am pleased we have found a solution that will ensure David can continue to 
be based at ECU,” he said. “ECU is seeking to renew David’s honorary 
appointment this month as planned.”
