‘Stop! You can’t go any further!”

We were on our way to a small temple overlooking the lake at Ulpotha when 
Suzi, the manager, came rushing up, looking flustered. “The elephants are 
closer now. It’s not safe.”

It was April, harvest time, and the smell of freshly threshed rice stored in 
giant clay pots was like catnip to the wild elephant population. A group of 
them had roamed into the expansive grounds of Ulpotha village, giving Suzi the 
jitters and sending a wave of excitement through the guests. We’d heard the 
elephants, and we’d seen the pink paper lanterns set in the paddy fields at 
night to ward them off; they were tantalisingly close, but none of us had 
actually seen one.

 An evening tai chi class led by Gingi Lee at Ulpotha. 
Ulpotha is an exceptionally beautiful yoga retreat in central Sri Lanka. As 
the elephant incident suggests, retreat is the operative word. A four-hour 
drive from Colombo and a mile from the nearest road, Ulpotha’s 11 mud huts are 
scattered across 22 acres of forest, home to macaque and langur monkeys, and 
all sorts of reptiles, birds and insects. The site is circled by mountains 
where monks still live in remote temples and caves. At the heart of the estate 
is an ancienttanque (reservoir) built more than 1,000 years ago and fed by 
spring water.

The land was bought in 1994 by two friends – Viren Perera and Giles Scott, who 
liked the idea of a jungle hideaway for parties – and became a yoga retreat by 
chance, when Giles met a teacher at a party and invited him to host a holiday 
among the newly built huts. Twenty years on it’s talked about in revered tones 
by yogis as one of the most extraordinary yoga destinations in the world.

Ulpotha is more expensive than some yoga retreats, but the effects are more 
pronounced. I spent most of the week in a semi-trance. Daily yoga and tai chi 
sessions withGingi Lee 
<http://www.theshalalondon.com/staff/id/100000001/Gingi-Lee>, a visiting 
ashtanga teacher, helped, as did the soupy heat, but these alone didn’t explain 
the profound feeling of calm that descended on me from day one. Apart from its 
remote setting, what distinguishes Ulpotha is the way it’s run – by a committee 
of six villagers, who make all the decisions about finances, hiring and firing, 
and replenishing supplies.

“There is a sense of great pride and belonging among the staff,” Suzi told me, 
which seems borne out by the length of time they’ve spent here. Nirosha, the 
accountant, and Agit, who’s involved in the day-to-day management, including 
the elephant watch, have both worked there for over 20 years. Forty-five locals 
live on site. The result is that Ulpotha is nothing like a hotel: it’s a small 
community, where visitors are very well looked after.

It’s also disconnected. Free from the glare of screens, beeping of devices and 
whirr of electricity, I became acutely aware of other sounds: from the frog 
choir as I lay in bed, with nothing but a mosquito net between me and the 
night, to the constant thwack of coconuts being opened (they get through 22,000 
a year) and the slap of clothes being washed against the stone steps of the 
lake.

The only time I felt slightly anxious in the week was climbing the wooden 
ladder to the treehouse, where I spent a night alone, 40ft above ground. In the 
morning I avoided looking down and instead admired the view of the lake, where 
a solitary swimmer made ripples in the still surface, and the doctor was taking 
his daily walk.

Dr Srilal Mudunkothge has worked at Ulpotha for 12 years, prescribing 
Ayurvedic treatments from a mud hut adorned with his qualifications. Some 
guests sign up for the full two-week detoxification programme; I opted for 
“just” a massage, a long ritual that involved being rubbed in a paste of 
turmeric, gooseberry and honey, steamed in a giant wicker basket and rubbed in 
oils. Needless to say it was deeply relaxing, although as the doctor told me, 
just being at Ulpotha is therapeutic – even if you don’t do yoga, like one 
repeat guest who’s been coming for years and has never been to a class. The 
fees paid by guests fund a clinic offering free treatments to locals, although 
the doctor’s reputation draws people from miles around; some travel all night 
to be first in the queue.

While guests on Ayurvedic programmes headed off for treatments after morning 
yoga, the rest of us were drawn to the lake, to lie in the raft-like hammocks 
or float in its warm, silky water among white petals, as yellow butterflies 
danced overhead and kingfishers andbrahminy kites 
<http://indianbirds.thedynamicnature.com/2015/05/brahminy-kite-haliastur-indus.html>
 swooped. There were times when this sensory overload was almost too much – 
nature throwing the whole “look at me” shebang at us.

Dinner roused me from my stupor. It was communal, the food served in clay pots 
laid out on rush floor mats in theambalama, the open-sided dining area. The 
lack of fridges – dismissed by one founder as a means of “keeping unfresh food” 
– means everything is made from scratch, and it’s fantastic: a selection of 
vegetarian curries, salads, red rice grown in the surrounding fields,sambol 
<http://www.mysrilankanrecipe.com/coconut-sambol/> and juices – watermelon, 
tamarind and lime, apple, hibiscus flower and custard apple.

Much as it’s hard to leave the nurturing confines of Ulpotha, all 20 guests 
signed up for a trip to Dambulla or Sigiriya, two of Sri Lanka’s most iconic 
sites. But Ulpotha is in an area of rarely visited archaeological sites and 
temples, so I decided to explore the more immediate vicinity. Ras Vehera is a 
40ft-high standing Buddha, much less well known than its slightly taller cousin 
Aukana, probably because it is unfinished. A group of elderly Sri Lankan women 
arrived as we were leaving but in nine years Suzi has never seen a foreign 
tourist there.

 The reclining buddha at little-visited Nagala. 
We also visited Arankele 
<http://www.archaeology.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87%3Aarankele&catid=51%3Asites&Itemid=99&lang=en>
, a forest hermitage dating to the 10th century BC, where a stone bath stands 
in the ruins of an ancient ayurvedic hospital and a mile-long meditation path 
wends through the jungle. Macaque monkeys with their old-man faces andKim 
Jong-un <https://www.theguardian.com/world/kim-jong-un> hairstyle stared at us 
from the trees, turning their faces every time I got my camera out. Nagala is 
another off-the-beaten track site not far from Ulpotha, with a temple overseen 
by a monk who is also an Ayurvedic doctor. In temperatures nudging 40C, I 
climbed stone steps to a rocky ledge where a 50ft-long reclining Buddha painted 
in vivid red robe and saffron yellow face. Given the growing popularity of Sri 
Lanka these ancient treasures will no doubt start to get the attention they 
deserve, but for now it’s perfectly possible to have them to yourself.

Most of the villagers at Ulpotha are Buddhists, but shamanism is still an 
integral part of life in rural Sri Lanka. One evening we were invited to the 
renovated manor house, where a shaman was offering the first rice harvest to 
the local gods. Men in white sarongs and white T-shirts were gathered around an 
altar covered in coconut flowers and tools for harvesting; incense, chanting 
and drumming filled the air, drifting into the night. Perhaps the noise kept 
the elephants at bay. We never saw them.
