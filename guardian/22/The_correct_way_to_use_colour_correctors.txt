On first look, colour correctors are threatening, dangerous things. With them 
comes the very real possibility of stepping out with purple polka dots on your 
chin and a carefully shaded lemon-coloured nose. The trick is to go gentle. 
Pale green to conceal redness, orange to balance greenish shadows, and peach to 
cover bruisy blues, all followed by your foundation. The correct way to colour 
correct? Carefully.
