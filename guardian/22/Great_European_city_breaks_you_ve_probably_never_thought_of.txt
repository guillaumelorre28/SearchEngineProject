Kotor, Montenegro

The Montenegrin coast feels very different from neighbouring Croatia: it’s 
more Russian-influenced and beauty spots can be thick with jetskis, large black 
4x4s, and beach bling. But Kotor, served by Tivat airport, is a gorgeous spot 
on a huge fjord-like sea inlet. For a good panorama, climb up to the castle, 
built by the Venetians (again), who ruled for almost four centuries and left an 
old town that is a Unesco world heritage site of labyrinthine lanes and 
piazzas, the 12th-century St Tryphon cathedral and city walls. There are 
pleasant boat trips and villages nearby. For food,Galion 
<https://www.facebook.com/Restaurant-Galion-544319725610046/> is an upmarket 
local favourite by the water, walking distance fromHotel Villa Duomo 
<http://www.villaduomo.com/> (doubles from €110 B&B) in the old town.

 Plovdiv’s Roman marble amphitheatre. Photograph: Alamy 
The name doesn’t help: I can hear David Jason sneering, “Oh Rodney, you total 
Plovdiv.” And there’s the assumption that all Bulgarian cities must be decrepit 
Soviet-era concrete monsters. Either way, on a warm evening, sipping a crisp 
local wine in a delightful open-air cafe in a quaint cobbled street near the 
amphitheatre, I hear no foreign voices, only Bulgarian. It has to be said that 
on lists of European destination gems, the non-appearance of this 
central-southern Bulgarian city must rank as the most egregious. It should be a 
top-ranking, must-go, bucket-list stalwart. And what is more, almost every 
empire in history thought so, too.

Plovdiv has been Greek, Goth, Hun, Viking, crusader and Ottoman, among others. 
It was 4,000 years old when the Romans got here, slapping a gorgeous 
amphitheatre in a prime location, plus an aqueduct, an odeon and a stadium 
which now, by dint of some remarkable engineering, does a semi-subterranean 
cameo appearance in the city’s main shopping thoroughfare. More recently the 
voluptuous 19th-century merchant’s houses have made fine museums (check out the
Ethnographic <http://www.ethnograph.info/front/index.php?lng=en>and the 
Regional History <http://historymuseumplovdiv.org/front/index.php?lng=en%3E> 
museums). But the real joy is the easygoing charm of the place and the 
idiosyncracies: street art, curious cats, laughter from high windows and 
snatches of music. There is also a gem of a boutique hotel, theHebros 
<http://www.hebros-hotel.com/> (doubles from €99 B&B), and several fine 
restaurants, including local favourite Grazhdanski Klubb (Stoyan Chalukov 1), 
next to Vazrazdane Gallery. The temptation to stay and dawdle around the 
twisting narrow streets will be enormous, but the Rhodope mountains within easy 
reach for day hikes and monastery visits.

The food is sublime, the wine irresistible. I am, I freely admit, a total 
Plovdiv.

Northern Croatia is a bit of an undiscovered gem, and Pula is the gateway to 
great coastal scenery and fine hill villages. The town is still dominated by 
its massive Roman amphitheatre, one of the best-preserved monuments of the 
ancient world. It’s capable of seating 23,000 and played by some big names.

Sadly the Roman tradition of sprinkling the audience with perfumed water from 
the four towers, all of which are still standing, is not continued. There are 
several other Roman monuments, but the real joy is the nearby Kamenjak 
peninsula, with lovely villages inland and clear blue waters along the rocky 
coast. The village of Banjole has a family-run taverna that’s worth checking 
out (Konoba Batelina, call +385 52 573 767 to book). Pula has a big tradition 
of music festivals: it will be packed this weekend for the Outlook festival. A 
good accommodation option isHotel Omir <http://www.hotel-omir.com/> (doubles

You might think you know a Baltic summer when you see one – we have those in 
Britain, don’t we? Palanga tells another story: a six-mile-long sandy beach 
covered in sun-soaking flesh in summer and delightful to visit in autumn too. 
Like Marbella? No. This is a decidedly central European location, so there’s a 
wonderful mixture of flavours from home-spun kitsch to party bling, with some 
wooden houses and fresh forest berries thrown in. The town itself is fun – grab 
that Vladimir Putin mask for the beach party. Don’t expect haute cuisine: the 
local speciality iscepelinai, a stuffed potato dumpling the size of a zeppelin.

 Lake Ohrid. Photograph: Alamy 
There is nowhere quite like Ohrid. The town is on a huge lake of the same 
name, with over 200 endemic species of plant, fish and water creature. It’s 
visited in winter by birds such as Dalmatian pelicans and various types of 
eagle. Surrounded by hills, it feels sublimely relaxed and gentle. In summer 
the locals splash about in rowing boats, swim and sunbathe. The charming old 
town, on the eastern shore, has piazzas, narrow winding lanes, a theatre built 
in 200BC, numerous churches and several hotels in the old houses:Villa St Sofija
 <http://www.vilasofija.com.mk/> (doubles from £28) is near the beach and 
centre. The town is dominated by the massive Samuel’s Fortress – named for the 
Bulgarian king who ruled in the 10th century. Just out of town is Galicica 
national park, one of Europe’s most biodiverse. For informal beachside eating, 
try Letna Bavča Kaneo (Kočo Racin 43) near Sveti Jovan church.

The soaraway success of low-cost airline Norwegian has opened up a lot of new 
routes into the country, arguably none more interesting than this town in prime 
fjord country about 260 miles north of Bergen. Not only is the location great – 
on a narrow peninsula – but the town has renowned art nouveau architecture 
having burned to the ground in 1904 then rebuilt in the fashionable style of 
the times. Aficionados will want to visit themuseum 
<http://www.jugendstilsenteret.no/home> ; others will just want to wander.

The town is home to Norway’s biggest fishing fleet so expect plenty to look 
at, plus endless opportunities to sample seafood, especially the local 
favourite, dried salt cod. XL Diner <http://www.xldiner.no/> on the waterfront 
is the restaurant of choice for many locals. There’s affordable accommodation

 ‘Chania’s food is legendary in Greece’. Photograph: Steve Outram/Getty Images 
It’s hardly undiscovered, but certainly underrated, particularly in winter 
when it’s mainly just locals and students. Pretty Chania has a fabulous old 
harbour built by the Venetians, who bought the city in the 13th century for 100 
pieces of silver. They left deep marks on the architecture, culture and 
cuisine: Chania’s food is legendary in Greece and there are heaps of tavernas 
and restaurants to try.

The waterfront is the tourist favourite, but head into the narrow back streets 
for more authentic experiences: trytsigariasto, a slow-cooked lamb stew, and 
keftedakia(meatballs). Thalasino Ageri <http://www.thalasino-ageri.gr/english/>
, a mile or so up the coast, is known for its seafood, and the nearby village 
of Kalives has a large number of good tavernas, too. Handy for beach and 
centre, family-runHotel Danaos  <http://www.danaoshotel.gr/>has simple white 
rooms, some with sea view (doubles from €50 B&B). Within reach for day trips is 
theSamaria Gorge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/13/top-10-canyons-gorges-europe-walking-hiking-trips>
 – there are plenty of tours, but it can be done independently: bus to Omalos, 
walk the gorge, ferry from Agia Roumeli to Sfakia, then bus back to Chania.

A European capital still under the tourist radar, big ticket sites are not 
really Pristina’s style – Bill Clinton’s statue is rated as a top attraction – 
but the ethnographic museum is definitely worth a visit for a taste of Kosovar 
culture.


There are some lovely narrow streets and traditional Turkic neighbourhoods to 
explore but this city is more about the exuberance and energy of a brand new 
country finding its feet. Coffee is great – Pristina claims the best macchiato 
in the world – and the cuisine is heavily Albanian-influenced. But with a big 
UN and EU presence, there are, inevitably, some swish bars, restaurants, and 
nightclubs. TryLiburnia  <https://www.facebook.com/Liburnia> for traditional 
food in an old Turkish house. For accommodation, Hostel Han (dorm beds from

Fun, vibrant, colourful Tirana? Surely a city that spent almost 50 years 
plunged in a grim isolationism more severe than Pyongyang must be dour and 
depressing. But it’s not. Tirana burst from its commie cocoon in 1992 all guns 
blazing and is now a chaotic good-natured riot. Ottoman, Italian, Islamic, 
Stalinist and capitalist influences are all thrown together in an architectural 
pot luck, spiced up after the millennium when many apartment blocks were 
painted in bright colours. As a result the city can resemble a box of liquorice 
allsorts casually scattered at the feet of forested Mount Datji (good for 
hiking). The heart of the nightlife isBllocku (the Block), an area formerly 
reserved for high-ranking party officials, now a fast-changing and ebullient 
enclave of restaurants and bars. This conveniently allows a bit of 
communist-nostalgia sightseeing to be combined with local food and drink: the 
coffee is excellent and don’t miss the street specials, stuffed filobyrek and 
kebab-likesouvlak. And few will want to miss a traditional breakfast of paçe 
koke, sheep’s head soup. An excellent local cafe is E7E (2 Rruga Jul 
Varibobba), and for budget accommodation, tryTirana Backpackers

Olbia usually gets forgotten by people rushing from its airport to the Costa 
Smeralda. What these visitors are missing is a fascinating historic centre with 
a pleasant laid-back atmosphere and some great cafes and restaurants. The one 
must-see is the museum on the site of the old harbour where an entire Roman 
fleet sank. It is being excavated and has a collection of ships’ remains and 
artefacts, plus relics of other cultures and an exposé of Nazi war crimes in 
the area. Watch out for the idiosyncratic opening hours and don’t miss the view 
from the roof.

Otherwise this is a town for strolling and eating. The side streets off Corso 
Umberto are the place to find authentic local cuisine likezuppa gallurese which 
is not a soup but a sloppy lasagne-like dish of layers of bread and cheese in 
tasty broth. It’s also worth the eight-mile trek north of town for the “typical 
Sardinian dinner” atAgriturismo Agrisole 
<http://www.agriturismo-agrisole.com/inglese/>, which also has rooms (doubles 
from €60 B&B).
