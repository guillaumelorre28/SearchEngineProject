Hickey has remained in Brazil after being arrested on suspicion of alleged 
illegal ticket touting – a charge dating back to the summer’s Olympics in Rio.

The 71-year-old has denied any wrongdoing and has stood down from his role as 
president of the Olympic Council of Ireland while the investigation takes place.

He will return home because of what ANOC described as a heart condition, with 
the bail payment meaning Hickey will be given back his confiscated passport.

ANOC said the bail payment is a loan for which it expects to be reimbursed.

“The decision was unanimously approved by ANOC president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad 
Al-Sabah and all ANOC vice-presidents via a postal vote on 20 November 2016,” a 
statement from ANOC read.

“The payment was made as a temporary loan so that Patrick Hickey could meet 
his bail requirements and return to Ireland where he can receive medical 
treatment for a heart condition. The terms of the temporary loan make it clear 
that it must be repaid to ANOC in full.

For legal reasons all other terms and conditions surrounding this bail payment 
will remain confidential.”
