For two years there have been a group of builders working on a site at the end 
of my road. Day after day they turn up in dungarees and bare torsos, or on 
cooler days, navy blue boiler suits. They are a cheery, good looking lot but 
until this summer I would not have called them fashionable.

Now, should the spirit and the bank balance take them, they could scrape the 
grime from their finger nails, attach a limpid blonde to the left arm and join 
the meleé on the steps of Merton’s of Mayfair, or some similarly “in” place and 
scarcely be noticed.

Scarcely, but the difference is that they have not donned the creations of 
Marshall Lester, Jeff Cooper, Fiorucci or any other trendy names; their casual 
gear is for real and will doubtless continue to do good service long after the
fashionable outbreak of dungarees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/14/dungarees-jumpsuits-workwear-fashion-archive>
, track suits, cat suits and all-in-ones have been discarded in favour of the 
next commercial gimmick.

Leisurewear, as these garments are known, have become the fashion catchword of 
the seventies: an easy, undefined title which covers an eclectic assortment of 
clothes for unspecified occasion, and isn’t the stalwart of an ailing rag trade 
industry. When the steady fare of clothes for office, parties, evenings out 
with the new lover or running the home do not pull in the customers in 
sufficient bulk, hey presto, we get a new leisurewear trend.

Commercialism, then, is the mother of invention, but at least it has given us 
a practical, enjoyable look this time. There are plenty of standard blue denim 
jump suits and dungarees to be had in such shops as Jean Machine, Jean Junction 
and other denim specialist stores. But for this page I have taken a selection 
of the usual designs which would cause an orchestra of whistles on any building 
site.

Miss Mouse has designed blue and white check dungarees with a nipped in 
elasticated waist; Strawberry Studio, too, go for the sexy fifties look with 
their candy stripe body hugging suit; my favourite is Marshall Lester’s 
crumpled cotton sexy dungarees with cutaway bodice and well cut bottom half; 
Fiorucci, the stylish Italian firm, have a variety of dungarees and we 
photographed a chopped off pair with bib.

But what’s the use of leisurewear if you don’t know the fashionable way to be 
leisurely? If James and Bob, the two young Americans we met in Holland Park are 
anything to go by, skateboarding is what you do in your trendy gear. This crazy 
sport which consists of balancing on a very expensive board fitted with 
precision wheels, and then zooming hither and thither, has, I am told, swept 
California and is about to take us by storm.

Not if London’s park keepers have anything to do with it. They have already 
chased James and Bob from Hampstead Heath and Regent’s Park, and the boys are 
off in search of a different form of leisure – surfing in Penzance.
