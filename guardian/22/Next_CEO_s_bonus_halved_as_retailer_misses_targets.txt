Next’s chief executive, Lord Wolfson, had his bonus halved last year as tough 
high street trading conditions caught up with the retail juggernaut.

 The Tory peer still earned a cash and shares package worth £4.8m, but 
collected an annual cash bonus of £503,000 compared with £1.1m the year before, 
after the retailer missed targets linked to profits and earnings per share. He 
also banked shares worth £3.1m on top of his £751,000 salary.Profits at the 
high street giant rose 5% to £821.3m in the year to January

.

“The challenging trading conditions encountered during the year and the 
reduction in the rate of growth of profit before tax and in earnings per share 
in 2015-16 as compared with the previous year are reflected in an annual bonus 
which is significantly less than that earned in 2014-15,” said Caroline 
Goodall, who chairs theNext <https://www.theguardian.com/business/next> 
remuneration committee.

In 2014 Wolfson actually earned £6.2m, but that figure was reduced to £4.7m 
due to the company’s policy of capping the value of share-based payouts at 
£2.5m. That policy has now been dropped after it axed a lucrative 
share-matching bonus scheme two years ago.

Wolfson had promised to share his bonuses

 with staff if the company could not find the extra cash needed to fund an 
improved 5% shop-floor pay rise through sales or productivity gains. It had 
originally budgeted for a 2% rise. The company said that in the end there had 
been no funding shortfall so no sacrifice was required on Wolfson’s part.

The executive directors were awarded a 2% pay rise in February, an increase 
that boosted Wolfson’s salary to £766,000.
