Most people still see a picture of Africa where children are malnourished, 
families are living on less than a dollar a day, disease-ravaged people – all 
dire situations that need assistance. Let’s stop and reflect on what

developing solutions to address problems, rather than painting the same cliched 
images. These are what create stereotypes, as Chimamanda [Ngozi Adichie] said 
in the “Danger of the single story <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg>
