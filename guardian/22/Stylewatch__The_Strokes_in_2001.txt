The excitement of the Strokes <https://www.theguardian.com/music/strokes> was 
how their taut, pop song take on the Velvet Underground sat in opposition to 
their style, which wasn’t all skinny black jeans and Converse. Their aesthetic 
of secondhand pieces styled in an unstyled way, is an unsaid mantra of many 
menswear collections fromAlessandro Michele

’s new Gucci to Maison Margiela.

They followed the Spice Girls <https://www.theguardian.com/music/spicegirls>’ 
template of being a charismatic quintet, whose individual styles all added to 
the bigger picture. Faded denim jackets, granddad trousers, Oxfam blazers and 
lots of earth tones, hair (a mix of Weller mod, unkempt cartoon curls and 
post-mullet androgyny) that was diametrically opposite to “done” and yet 
informed future generations of boybands (hi,Harry Styles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/harry-styles>). Spin magazine described them 
as “part Bowery Boys, part CK One hotties” and that was it, a perfect, 
prescient meshing of high fashion and storied, East Village thrift. Their 
influence on how a generation of teenage boys would dress and interact with 
fashion was massive.
