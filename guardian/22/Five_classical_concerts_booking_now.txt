2 The Snow Maiden

Opera North’s winter season is all about fairy stories. New productions of 
Hansel And Gretel and La Cenerentola come later, but kicking it off is 
Rimsky-Korsakov’s sumptuous Russian folk tale. Aoife Miskelly heads the cast as 
the girl whose heart is made of ice.

3 Le Vin Herbé

Alongside two Puccini revivals in the Welsh National Opera’s spring season, a 
real rarity. Frank Martin’s take on the legend of Tristan And Isolde is a 
chamber opera, worlds away from Wagner’s famous version. With James Southall 
conducting, Polly Graham stages this intimate three-hander. Tom Randle is 
Tristan and Jurgita Adamonytė is Iseult.

Millennium Centre, Cardiff, 16 Feb; touring to 25 Apr

The Belief And Beyond Belief festival provides a chance to hear Vladimir 
Jurowski conduct one of the 60s’ most celebrated scores. Krzysztof Penderecki’s 
choral work cemented his place among the avant garde.
