Culture for the canny 

With an art scene as vibrant as Berlin’s, it’s no wonder Chinese artist Ai 
Weiwei <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei> has decided to set 
up shop inOctober as professor at the Universität der Künste 
<http://conversations.e-flux.com/t/ai-weiwei-to-teach-at-berlins-udk-in-october/2239>

<http://art.daimler.com/en/sammlung-2/daimler-contemporary/> or Akademie der 
Künste <http://www.adk.de/en/academy/academy/> (exhibitions free Tuesdays

<http://www.visitberlin.de/en/spot/museum-island> are, alas, no more, a €24 pass

With food trucks hawking everything from arepas to arancini, diners can spin 
the culinary globe without breaking the bank.Markthalle IX 
<http://markthalleneun.de/?lang=en> still runs Street Food Thursdays and has 
added a popularBreakfast Market 
<https://www.facebook.com/events/438367943017016/>, which serves a pretty loose 
interpretation of breakfast until 6pm every third Sunday of the month with no 
cover charge. Offerings range from congee to avocado toasts to Indian snacks 
and barbecue sandwiches and eggs benedict. There are also breakfast cocktails. 
In the heavily graffitied Raw Gelände complex, theNeue Heimat Village Market 
<http://neueheimat.com/> on Sunday sells everything from whisky-glazed ribs to 
Mexicanpaletas, all accompanied by live music. Newest on the scene is Street 
Food auf Achse <http://streetfoodaufachse.de/> at Kulturbrauerei.

The roving Bite Club <http://biteclub.de/>, often spotted by the Hoppetosse on 
the Spree, has a block party vibe and offerings includingJolesch’s 
<http://jolesch.de/> superb schnitzel and Pignut BBQ’s  <http://pignut.de/>
pulled pork. Hipsters don’t have a monopoly on streetside edibles, though. Join 
the city’s Turkish community at the twice-weeklyMaybachufer Market 
<https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.tuerkenmarkt.de/&prev=search>
 for crisp falafel or south-east Asian expats in the summertime at Thai Park, 
in Charlottenburg’s Preussenpark. This has authenticsom tam (green papaya 
salad) and satay for a steal. And for the original Berliner street food, skip 
the queues at touristy Mustafa’s and grab a doner kebab with avocado sauce, 
chicken and veggies fromNur Gemüse Kebap 
<http://nurgemuesekebap.de/index.php/english/nur-gallery.html> for €2.80. Find

 Understand Berlin’s various subcultures on an alternative tour. Photograph: 
Reuters/Corbis 
For a deeper understanding of the city’s convoluted history and subcultures, 
head to Alexanderplatz at 11am forAlternative Berlin’s 
<http://alternativeberlin.com/> free three-hour tour. Itineraries vary, but 
could include anything from a trip to an artists’ squat to a daytime rave. If 
you’re willing to shell out a modest €18, you will get a four-hour tour 
showcasing works by more than 50 street artists, plus the chance to make your 
own graffiti. For a more conventional free walkabout,New Berlin 
<http://www.newberlintours.com/> covers the basics – from the former SS 
headquarters to the Brandenburg Gate. Meanwhile, the three-hour Bowie Berlin 
Walk (€14) fromBerlin Music Tours 
<http://musictours-berlin.com/bowie-berlin-walk> is a reasonably priced way to 
delve into the Thin White Duke’s Berlin Trilogy period, though die-hards may 
want to cough up the extra dough to visit the storiedHansa Studios 
<http://www.hansastudios.de/english/>, where he recorded Low and Heroes. 
Alternatively, make your own tour with the TimeTraveler 
<http://timetraveler.berlin/> app, which shows footage of the past superimposed 
over historical attractions.

Why pay for concerts when you can see the renowned Berlin Philharmonic for 
free every Tuesday at 1pm 
<http://www.berliner-philharmoniker.de/en/concerts/lunch-concerts/>? Space is 
limited to 1,500, so get there on the early side. For more variety, join the 
masses in the Tiergarten for the 10-weekKonzertsommer 
<http://konzertsommer-berlin.de/> series featuring everything from Swedish folk 
to reggae. After the season ends, go toKreuzberg’s Bierhaus Urban 
<http://bierhaus-urban.com/> (Thursdays) for blues, or to A-Trane 
<http://a-trane.de/> (Mondays), Kunstfabrik Schlot 
<http://kunstfabrik-schlot.de/> (Mondays, Thursdays and Sundays), and Café Tasso
 <http://cafe-tasso.de/> for jazz jam sessions. If under 30 you should scoop up 
theClassicCard <http://classiccard.de/en_EN/home> (€15), which entitles holders 
to ballet and opera seats for €10 or concert tickets for €8.

 An amazing inside view of the Reichstag dome. Photograph: Daniel Kalker/Corbis 
Don’t make the same mistake as 1.2 million visitors every year and shell out 
€13-plus for a ride up theFernsehturm <https://www.tv-turm.de/en/>. A trip up 
the Norman Foster-designedReichstag 
<http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/visits/kuppel/kupp/245686> dome affords an 
equally spectacular panorama for absolutely zilch. The athletically inclined 
may prefer to hike their way to the top ofTeufelsberg 
<http://berliner-teufelsberg.com/web/en>, the eerie, abandoned site of a former 
NSA station. A one-hour tour (€7) will take you to the art house, a colourful 
collection of graffiti, and provide the perfect vantage point for that coveted 
snapshot.

Budget accommodations 
 Circus Hostel 
Being frugal doesn’t necessarily mean slumming it. Just steps from the U-bahn 
at Rosenthaler Platz, theCircus Hostel  <http://www.circus-berlin.de/hostel/>
(dorms from €23), with a new microbrewery, remains the stuff of flashpacker 
dreams. ButGrand Hostel Berlin  <http://www.grandhostel-berlin.de/>(dorms from 
€19) goes the extra mile with free German lessons and beer tastings, a cosy 
library bar and canalside seating in its 1870s Kreuzberg building.

Just a year old, Wallyard Concept Hostel 
<http://wallyard.de/?page_id=20272#homeslider> (dorms from €13) has the soul of 
a designer boutique. Equally stylish isOne80° Hostel <http://one80hostels.com/> 
(dorms from €9), where the Wi-Fi is free and Alexanderplatz is around the 
corner. If you’re a musician, you and your crew can snag a stay in exchange for 
a performance. Read about Berlin’s latest hipster hang outhere

 Vabali spa 
Though not exactly known for its balmy weather, Berlin does its best to 
replicate the beaches and islands of kinder climes. The new Balinese spaVabali  
<http://www.vabali.de/en/>is a bit of a splurge, but a pass (€31) entitles 
guests to a full day of pampering in 10 different saunas and free use of the 
five-acre gardens. Also Indonesian inspired is Deck5 
<http://freiluftrebellen.de/en/>, a rooftop bar with palm trees resembling an 
oasis and perched incongruously on top of a mall (though the drinks aren’t 
cheap). For beach-style clubbing, head toMetaxa <http://metaxa-beach.de/> for 
pop, the newRampe <http://rampe.club/> for underground sounds, or Strandbar 
Mitte <http://www.monbijou-theater.de/strandbar-tanz.html> for salsa, swing and 
tango classes (from €5). Best of all on a lazy Sunday afternoon isYaam 
<http://www.yaam.de/>, the African cultural centre that migrated to the 
riverside site of the old Magdalena club last year. Revellers and families 
alike can nosh on west African snacks, play beach volleyball or kick back to 
reggae. Read about Berlin’s best outdoor swimming spotshere

 Café am Neuen See 
In 2014, locals campaigned long and hard to save Tempelhofer Feld, the 
sprawling former airport, and with good reason – on sunny days the space is 
full of impromptu barbecues, kiteboarders and the occasional taiko drummer. 
Join any of the above or wander the whimsically decoratedAllmende-Kontor

Dozens of public festivals and events mean the Berlin calendar is crammed all 
year. Over for this year are: May Day (May 1, 2016), Kreuzberg’s 
anti-establishment carnival;Fête de la Musique 
<http://www.fetedelamusique.de/en/> (June 21, 2016), where live musical 
performances span the streets; and the ultra-flamboyant parades ofChristopher 
Street Day <http://csd-berlin.de/> and Karneval der Kulturen 
<http://karneval-berlin.de/en> (May 22-25, 2016). But visitors can still check 
out indie art withProject Space Festival Berlin 
<http://www.visitberlin.de/en/event/08-31-2015/project-space-festival-berlin-2015>
 (until the end of August), where 30 venues throughout the city put on a free 
24-hour event of their choosing. After 14 years of neglect, Berlin’s abandoned 
amusement park is open to the public again forKulturspreepark 
<http://kulturspreepark.de/> (tickets from €8, until September 20), a series of 
theatre and musical performances. It’s one of the few chances visitors have to 
(legally) explore the spectacularly dilapidated grounds, which are normally
verboten. In autumn, the 10th annual Festival of Lights 
<http://festival-of-lights.de/en/> will see historic buildings illuminated in 
neon (October 9-18).
