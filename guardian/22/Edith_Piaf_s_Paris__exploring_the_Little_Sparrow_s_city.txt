Rue de Belleville

As the legend goes, Edith Piaf was born in a doorway at 72 rue de Belleville 
in the 20th arrondissement on 19 December 1915, the daughter of a busker and a 
cafe singer. Above the cracked marble doorstep is a plaque that says her voice 
would go on to touch the world, which is pretty much what happened. But first 
she sang at a tiny cafe down the street,Aux Folies 
<http://www.aux-folies-belleville.fr/>, an art-deco relic with cubist mosaics, 
swirls of neon lettering above its zinc counter, and iron pillars plastered 
with handbills for shows dating back to the 1920s.

She sang here when she was young and poor, in between performing as a street 
musician with her father. In her day this was a gritty neighbourhood and it 
hasn’t changed much, with a shabby market by the metro station and blocks of 
peeling townhouses; this is the real, old Paris, the world she sang about, with 
its desperate cast of thieves and tramps and lovers. Growing up here was what 
gave her songs their sting.

If there’s one place in Paris to hear the kind of chanson that Piaf sang, it’s 
this simple club where Piaf appeared while in her 20s. It’s in a cobbled lane 
in Montmartre, and in those days she lived across the street with a pimp who 
later tried to shoot her. The Lapin is atmospheric: a two-room cabin from the 
1860s where generations of artists and ne’er-do-wells have caroused, from the 
impressionists onwards. Paintings dark with age line the walls, and the 
audience sits on rough benches drinking thimbles of pruneau brandy. Admission 
for a show costs €28, including one drink, and around 10pm the singing starts. 
There’ll be comic songs on the piano, ballads roared by patron Yves Mathieu, 
and, if you’re lucky, a dark-eyed siren singing of her broken heart. But it’s 
the accordion player who really takes you back, to Paris in the 1930s – 
gaslight in the alleys, hope on the horizon.

In the years of Piaf’s fame (from 1935 onwards), this was the classic 
brasserie for celebrities, its art deco hall host to everyone from Pablo 
Picasso to Jean-Paul Sartre. The stories of their exploits fill eight pages on 
its website. Piaf sang in the ballroom in the basement, among pillars carved to 
look like palm trees. Today it’s an elegant spot for lunch among tables stacked 
with silver trays of seafood on ice. It was refurbished in 2008, to the horror 
of many older Parisians, but the vibe is as glamorous as ever, with its 
stained-glass ceiling and mural-covered walls. The set menus are a steal (three 
courses from €31).

The tiny flat where she once lived is now the only museum devoted to Piaf. 
It’s run by Bernard Marchois, a fan who met her in 1958 and can talk at length 
about her life. Among exhibits in the two-room display are her famous little 
black dress and the boxing gloves of her greatest love, the prize-fighter 
Marcel Cerdan, whose death in a plane crash in 1949 plunged her into a lost 
decade of drink and drugs. She had written the ecstatic Hymne à l’Amour for 
him, and insisted on singing it on stage the night after hearing of his death: 
she got as far as the chorus before fainting.

In 1963, 100,000 people followed Piaf’s coffin to her grave, stopping the 
traffic right across the city. By then she had become an icon of the place, an 
authentic voice whose life matched her songs of heartbreak and courage. Fellow 
singer Marlene Dietrich called Piaf “the soul of Paris”. Fans still gather at 
her grave in the celebrity-studded Père Lachaise cemetery. It’s a simple black 
slab of marble, with a vase of fresh flowers and a line from a song at the 
foot: “God reunites those who love each other.” After paying your respects, 
revive your spirits is the nearby Bar de la Place Edith Piaf, whose walls are 
covered with black-and-white photos of the diva at her best. In the square 
outside is a statue of her in full song, arms stretched above her head – though 
whether in rapture or despair it’s impossible to tell.
