Keep the kids happy: public parks and picnics

When the unrelenting sunshine at archeological sites and the absence of 
air-conditioning in museums is too much for kids and parents alike, go to one 
of the city’s public parks where umbrella pines provide shade, fresh fountains 
abound and vast lawns are ripe for lounging. Stock up on picnic provisions at 
one of the city’s markets, such as Mercato Trionfale (Via Andrea Doria), or 
Mercato di Testaccio (Via Galvani) and retreat to Villa Doria Pamphili (Via di 
San Pancrazio), a former noble estate above Trastevere that covers 450 acres. 
For an archeology-focused outing, the Parco degli Aquedotti (Via Lemonia 256) 
and Parco della Caffarella (Via della Caffarella) host ruins in their free 
public pastures.

A museum alternative: privately run archeological sites

Tickets to state-operated museums and archeological sites often come with a 
steep price tag but visitors can find more affordable admission at privately 
run venues. A visit tothe temple ruins beneath the Church of San Nicola in 
Carcere <http://www.sotterraneidiroma.it/> costs €2-€3, paid to the guardian 
seated near the church entrance. A few streets away from the Colosseum, theCase 
Romane del Celio <http://basilicasanclemente.com/eng/> rests above an ancient 
residential quarter; the full ticket price is €8. Just steps from the crowds at 
the Trevi fountain, €3 buys access to theVicus Caprarius 
<http://www.archeodomani.com/>, two first-century buildings and a medieval 
complex, all of which is narrated by terrific signage.

Photograph: Alamy 
For the price of a €1.50 bus ticket, visitors can reach the peripheral 
districts ofTor Marancia <http://www.bigcitylife.it/> and Trullo where street 
art has been used to revitalise neighbourhoods and stimulate community ties. In 
both zones, internationally renowned street artists have collaborated to paint 
whole city-block facades with geometric and figurative murals. Closer to the 
centre of town, the Ostiense, Garbatella and Testaccio districts, all 
accessible by the Metro B, have become palates for local street artists. 
Likewise, Tor Pignattara, Pigneto and Centocelle, all east of the centre, are 
awash with the colours of murals and posters.

Rome may not have a reputation as a modern city but that doesn’t mean there 
aren’t pockets of contemporary architecture to be found. The Flaminio district, 
which is just outside the third-century Aurelian Walls, is rife with stunning 
20th- and 21st-century architecture. Hop on the No 2 tram at Piazzale Flaminio 
(the standard ticket, valid for 100 minutes, costs €1.50) and ride north for 
seven stops to the Tiziano/Apollodoro stop. Just 200 yards away,Zaha Hadid’s 
MAXXI house <http://www.fondazionemaxxi.it/en/>’s Rome’s collection of 
21st-century art. The collection itself has an entry fee but lounging around 
the manicured grounds in the shade of the angular concrete structure is free. A 
few streets west, Luigi Nervi’s Palazzetto dello Sport andRenzo Piano’s 
Auditorium <http://www.rpbw.com/project/95/auditorium-del-parco/> are gorgeous 
examples of contemporary architecture and both are surrounded by public spaces 
perfect for appreciating the buildings free of charge.

Rome’s 125 city-run food markets are fantastic destinations for an immersion 
in what’s fresh, seasonal and authentic. Until recently, they sold mainly raw 
materials, but since opening in a new space in 2012, the Testaccio 
neighbourhood’s market has begun selling prepared foods to eat in or take away. 
Numerous stalls, many of which are along the Via Beniamino Franklin side of the 
market, cater to market vendors and students from the adjacent university.Mordi 
e Vai <http://www.mordievai.it/>, which is owned by a former butcher, 
specialises in simmered meat and offal sandwiches, whileDess’Art 
<http://www.dessart.it/DessArt/Dessart.html> does Sicilian specialities such as 
panelle (chickpea fritter) sandwiches, arancini (fried rice balls) and cannoli. 
Nearby,Da Artenio <http://www.daartenio.it/> sells pizzas, roasted vegetables 
and other baked goods to take away.

which they were meant to hang – rather than an out-of-context museum setting.
