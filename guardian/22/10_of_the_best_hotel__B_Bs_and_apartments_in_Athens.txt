The Zillers

In July 2016, Athens cathedral emerged gleaming from its dusty shroud of 
scaffolding after 17 years. A landmark building dating from 1895 overlooking 
the cathedral has also had a dramatic makeover. Formerly the grubby Magna 
Grecia hotel, it has been renamed after the original architect, Ernst Ziller, 
the German master of Athenian neoclassicism. In the rooftop restaurant, bearded 
bartenders knock up mind-blowing cocktails while you admire show-stopping views 
of the Parthenon. Breakfast will be served here when the 10 bedrooms downstairs 
open in autumn 2016. A sensitive restoration lets the original features sing: 
soaring ceilings with delicate plasterwork, grey-green walls, and giant beds 
backed by carved wooden screens.

Downtown Athens is full of crumbling neoclassical gems ripe for restoration. 
Three young Athenians with a passion for vintage have converted this two-storey 
townhouse into a hostel brimming with retro charm. Everything feels like home, 
from the vinyl collection in the chintzy living room to the antique china in 
the pink kitchen. Four bedrooms and three dorms share two immaculate bathrooms. 
Guests hang out with their hosts in the flower-filled courtyard, a shady oasis 
with a swinging sofa and patterned tiles. It’s on a quiet, pedestrian street in 
Exarchia, an edgy neighbourhood known for its street art and political 
protests, but also full of excellent tavernas, art deco architecture, and 
vintage shops.

 Inn Athens 
In between the National Gardens <http://www.athensguide.com/gardens.html> and 
the old town of Plaka, the grand Rallis Arcade was once the residence of former 
Greek prime minister Georgios Rallis. Built to house refugees from Asia Minor 
in the 1920s, it’s now a sleek 22-room hotel. Interiors are surprisingly 
modern: exposed concrete in the lobby, smoky glass shower cubicles and bespoke 
metal beds in the black-and-white bedrooms. All rooms have vast windows 
overlooking the open-air atrium; with its trees and built-in sofas, it’s a 
lovely spot for a sunny breakfast of scrambled eggs and sesame bagels. Handily, 
it’s next door to By the Glass, which sells an exciting selection of Greek 
wines. Central, quiet, and good value.

A converted townhouse in Plaka, Athens’ prettiest and oldest neighbourhood, 
this “micro-boutique hotel” has just four suites. Each room reflects the 
eclectic style of Greek-Irish architect-turned-innkeeper John Consolas - a 
mash-up of family heirlooms, flea market finds, and contemporary art. Guests 
have the run of the ground floor, including a cosy library with a gramophone, 
well-stocked kitchen-diner (help yourself to fabulous home-made cakes), and a 
shady courtyard for alfresco breakfast or takeaways. Those who book the whole 
house could throw a party on the roof terrace, usually reserved for residents 
of the Harry Belafonte suite. If there’s no room at the inn, check out John’s 
latest venture,JJ Hospitality <http://www.jjhospitality.net/>, a selection of 
short-stay apartments in Athens and beyond.

For a cheaper stay, this stylish hostel is classier than many five-star hotels 
in Athens. Spread across a pair of 19th-century townhouses, accommodation runs 
from eight-bed dorms with bespoke wooden bunks to deluxe doubles with 
mid-century dressing tables andbalconies. There’s a sociable vibe in the 
communal living room, a fancy-dress photo booth, and a secluded roof terrace 
for sunbathing or stargazing. Wholesome, homemade breakfast is served in 
Zampanó, the owners’ Mediterranean restaurant (discounts for residents), a 
popular spot for Sunday brunch. A new annex of family-friendly apartments with 
kitchenettes opens in September 2016.

views, there are plenty of options for large families or gangs of friends. 
Individually styled and expertly managed, every place feels like a home, with 
plant-filled terraces or balconies, colourful artwork, and funky modern 
furniture. This is your best bet if you want affordable chic in Plaka, the 
historic heart of Athens.

 Live in Athens, Greece 
In 2012, four friends (three of them unemployed) in Athens decided to set up a 
business offering travellers affordable lodgings – more personal than a hotel, 
more private than airbnb. They took a punt on an empty building in Thissio, an 
under-the-radar neighbourhood below the Parthenon. At first they did everything 
themselves, from painting the walls to cleaning the loos. Now they have 11 
distinctive apartments (two in Thissio, nine in lively Psirri) and 10 staff. 
Guests are welcomed with homemade cake and stacks of insider tips. Other 
friends of theirs have opened a cafe at one of the properties, serving all-day 
breakfasts and light lunches. They’ve called itSpiti Mas 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Spiti-Mas/294853560590957> (Our Home). The 
business has taken off, but it’s still about giving visitors a genuine welcome.

Sophisticated yet understated, peaceful but central, Mets is where you’d want 
to live if you were Athenian. These seven apartments overlook the marble 
stadium where the first modern Olympics were staged (the running track is open 
from 7.30am and 9am). Well-known Greek poets, actors and film directors have 
all lived in this 1930s house, now owned by furniture designer Yannis 
Zachariadis. Interiors are a mishmash of old and new: Thonet chairs, metal 
butterfly lights, art nouveau armoires, and matt black bathrooms. Some rooms 
overlook a little garden, with a chair under the lemon tree. Kitchenettes are 
stocked with fresh fruit, coffee, tea and olive oil from the Zachariadis 
family’s estate. The free laundry service is a bonus for families.

Abandoned for decades, this 100-year-old hotel was revived in 2015. Behind the 
vast, unmarked door, the mismatched, faux-antique interiors don’t quite live up 
to the glorious peach-and-ochre façade. Fourteen bedrooms pay cheesy tribute to 
Greek legends such as Maria Callas and Melina Mercouri. But if you want to hit 
the town, the buzzy location on Ayia Irini Square couldn’t be better. Once home 
to flower sellers, the square is now rammed with people sipping flat whites and 
Negronis, or tucking into souvlaki from Kostas’ little kiosk (a landmark in its 
own right). There’s no lobby or restaurant, but guests can choose from two 
local cafes for breakfast. It’s perfect for people watching, and a short stroll 
to all the major monuments.

First impressions are confusing at this urban bolthole in upmarket Kolonaki. 
Instead of a lobby, you enter through a furniture showroom; the hotel is owned 
by Coco-Mat, purveyor of all-natural mattresses to some of the world’s best 
hotels. Upstairs are 42 elegant bedrooms, dressed in pale linens, blonde wood 
and cool marble, ranging from Sleep Tight snugs to open-plan lofts with 
Acropolis views. Naturally, the four-layer beds with a 12-pillow menu are 
supremely comfortable. A variety of Greek treats is served all day in the 
sky-lit basement, and there’s a rooftop honesty bar with vistas across the 
tangled skyline. Guests can borrow wooden bicycles to explore the lively 
neighbourhood, but be warned: it’s hilly. Coco-Mat Athens’ sister hotel,Nafsika 
<http://nafsika.coco-mat-hotels.com/>, in the leafy suburb of Kifissia, is 
better suited to cycling.
