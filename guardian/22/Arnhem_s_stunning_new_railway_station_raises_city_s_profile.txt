The Dutch city of Arnhem is not a name that springs to mind when thinking of 
Europe’s major transport hubs. But with its sleek new railway station now in 
place, the city is poised to become a crucial transport link between the 
economic centres of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.

The culmination of nearly two decades of work 
<http://www.railway-news.com/railway-industry-news/netherlands-transfer-terminal-at-arnhem-central-station-opens>
 and €37.5m of funding, Arnhem Central station is a soaring modernist structure 
made of undulating glass, exposed concrete and steel. By 2020, as many as 
110,000 passengers a day may pass through its airy halls. Though not the 
largest in Europe – more than 140,000 pass through London’s King’s Cross 
station on an average weekday – the station stands out for the visual and 
technical innovations in its design. It elevates its immediate surroundings, 
giving the area a much-needed focal point through which everyone passes.

“People asked, ‘Why did it take so long?’ The answer is it was a big, 
difficult puzzle,” says Ben van Berkel, founder and principal architect of 
Amsterdam-based UNStudio, which designed the station. Over the course of 
extensive urban studies, the original station plan morphed into a far more 
ambitious transportation hub containing two bus stations, offices, and parking 
for roughly 1,000 cars and 4,500 bicycles.

In the process, the team employed shipbuilding techniques and the expertise of 
engineering firm Arup to keep the sinuous roof aloft with few visible supports. 
The result is a vast, open space filled with natural light where the floor, 
ceiling and walkways seem to melt effortlessly into each other.

“We wanted to get back to this notion of celebrating travelling,” says van 
Berkel. “And because all the parties involved were so excited about it, we 
didn’t have to compromise on the design.”

The arrival of the station invites travellers, who might previously have 
bypassed the city, to stop for a day and take in the picturesque cafe-lined 
streets of Arnhem, Gelderland’s capital on the lower Rhine.

Military history buffs will want to pause by the John Frost Bridge, the site 
of the crucial second world war battle depicted in the film A Bridge Too Far, 
while families should head for the nearbyHoge Veluwe national park 
<https://www.hogeveluwe.nl/en>, a sprawling nature preserve and the site of the 
impressiveKröller-Müller Museum <http://krollermuller.nl/visit> (open Tue-Sun 
10am-5pm, combination park and museum ticket €17.60), with one of the largest 
sculpture gardens on the continent and works by Van Gogh, Picasso and Monet.

The city also boasts a respectable modern art showcase, Museum Arnhem 
<http://museumarnhem.nl/ENG> (open Tue-Sun 11am-5pm, €10), as well as the 
century-old NetherlandsOpen Air Museum <http://www.openairmuseum.nl/> (opening 
hours vary, €12-€16), with interactive exhibits on Dutch history and culture.

That the area’s profile will rise from the influx of international visitors is 
all but inevitable. For the residents of Arnhem though, the project’s value 
manifests on a much smaller, more personal scale.

“People came to me and said that they are proud to show it to their friends 
and family,” van Berkel says. “That it’s nice to pick up people here and to say 
goodbye to them.”
