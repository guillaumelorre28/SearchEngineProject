Winning Tip: Taverna at the end of the world, Samos


Reached along a 3.5km coastal dirt track carved out of the cliff, Kohili 
taverna <http://kohili.com/> – with a sign that declares itself “at the end of 
the world” – is perched above a small pebble beach on the south-west tip of 
Samos, surrounded by lemon and olive terraces, and with nothing to see but 
scrub and sea. We arrived late in the day on bikes and the owner kindly agreed 
to us pitching our tent on the beach after a hearty meal.

Jeep safari in Rhodes

Explore the hilly interior and deserted west coast of the island by Jeep with 
Bumpy Rhodes Safaris <http://www.bumpy-rhodes.com/>, who will take you on an 
off-beat and off-road trip around the island in one of their rugged vehicles 
(from €40). You are picked up at various spots on the coast (including most 
hotels in the north and east of the island) and will head inland for an 
olive-pickers’ lunch at a mountain cabin.

Cooking holidays in Crete are a great way to experience the island. Personable

from the garden – communicated their passion for food, wine and local life. The

 Start your 10km walk at the very pretty orthodox cathedral in Fira and head 
off along the cliffs towards Oia. The crowds thin after a while, leaving only 
you and serious walkers to be rewarded with stunning views from the caldera. In 
the mountains you’ll pass a small, isolated church in theCycladean style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/12/greek-island-holiday-guide-the-cyclades>
