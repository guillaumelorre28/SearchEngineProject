As anybody who has visited Ireland knows, it’s easy to spend a lot of money in 
both the Republic and the North. There’s no shortage of expensive five-star 
hotels, often in landmark castles, grand country houses or big city blocks but 
finding more modest places to stay that are also interesting, individual and 
independent is a harder task; but it is possible. Here is our pick of stylishly 
good value accommodation, most around or below the €100-€150 B&B mark, that 
will stretch your euros and pounds just that little bit further.

 The exterior of Kelly’s Hotel in Dublin; Hogan’s Bar is on street level 
If you’re looking for somewhere chic and central to stay this “urban boutique 
hotel” on the corner of South Great George’s Street and Fade Street is the 
place to go. It’s in a warren of corridors and rooms above popular hangout
Hogan’s Bar <https://www.facebook.com/HogansBarDublin/?rf=193607443983352> and 
French brasseriel’Gueuleton <http://lgueuleton.com/> (where Kelly’s continental 
breakfasts are served), and next to the still just about hip and happeningBar 
With No Name <http://www.dublintown.ie/business/the-bar-with-no-name>. The 
hotel has 16 design-led bedrooms, mostly small and stylishly minimal. There’s 
even a small (again) residents’ bar. Not the quietest place to stay, especially 
at 1.30am on a Sunday, but fun and funky all the same.

If you’re prepared to pay that little bit more in the capital, but get quite a 
lot more in return, this boutique B&B, in a mews, behind a creeper-covered wall 
a five-minute walk from St Stephen’s Green, is hard to beat. There are 21 
luxurious bedrooms over two contrasting buildings: a classic Georgian 
townhouse; and, opposite, a modernist mews-house, with a groovy 1970s interior, 
designed by, and the first home of, a man who was one of Ireland’s leading 
architects:Sam Stephenson 
<http://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-bold-and-controversial-architect-who-left-his-mark-on-dublin-1.1028028>
. A beautiful private garden links the two houses and there are hearty organic 
breakfasts, too. A relaxed and hospitable haven in the middle of a modern city.

Dublin: Ariel House

With 37 rooms, across three grand adjoining red-brick Victorian houses (and a 
modern garden wing), Ariel House is more like a small professionally run hotel 
than a large family-owned B&B. It’s also tucked away, in the shadow of the 
Aviva stadium, around 2km (a seven-minuteDart train 
<http://www.irishrail.ie/about-us/dart-commuter> ride to Landsdowne Road), from 
the city centre – in the genteel southside Dublin 4 suburb of Ballsbridge. Yet 
the warmth of its welcome, the charm of its opulent rooms and period features 
and the quality of its celebrated breakfasts (and complimentary afternoon cakes 
and scones) make this a great place to stay.

 Knockree Hostel 
The sixth-century monastic settlement of Glendalough, with its 30-metre-high 
round tower and granite arched gateway, is one of Ireland’s most impressive and 
important historical sites. Just a few minutes walk away, off the steep-sided 
road to the Upper Lake, is theGlendalough International Hostel 
<http://anoige.ie/hostels/our-hostel-guide/glendalough-international-hostel/> 
(dorm beds from €16pp, doubles from €50, breakfast €5, +353 1 830 4555), in a 
chalet-style lodge, once known as Swiss Cottage. Thirty kilometres to the north 
(and just to the south of Dublin), also on the famedWicklow Way walking route 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/may/09/wicklow-way-walking-dublin-ireland>
, is the newer, purpose-builtKnockree Youth Hostel 
<http://anoige.ie/hostels/our-hostel-guide/knockree-youth-hostel/> (dorm bed 
€20pp, doubles from €60, breakfast €5, +353 1 830 4555) handy for trips to 
handsomePowerscourt House and Gardens <http://powerscourt.com/>. Catering 
primarily for youth and student groups, in dorms, the hostels have just two 
private double rooms each (though there are more family rooms) – so plan ahead.

Kilkenny is a friendly city, with such attractions as medieval Kilkenny Castle

<http://www.stcanicescathedral.ie/>, with its 100ft 9th-century round tower, 
and the fineNational Craft Gallery <http://www.nationalcraftgallery.ie/>. Since 
it opened in 2000, Zuni has made its name primarily as a fine, bustling, city 
centre, “modern European” restaurant, spearheaded by star chef Maria Raftery – 
but it has always offered rooms upstairs, in a 1902 building that originally 
housed the city’s first theatre. The 13 well-priced bedrooms are clean, bright 
and simple in design, enhanced by a palette of rich and rusty browns.

Part of an expanding local setup that includes a restaurant, cookery school 
and wine bar, this 14-room B&B – in two 19th-century townhouses near the 
harbour, and run by acclaimed chef Paul Flynn and his wife Máire – is the best 
place to stay in the pretty coastal town ofDungarvan 
<http://www.dungarvantourism.com/welcome/web>. Bedrooms are comfortable and 
(mostly) spacious, with louvred shutters and a restrained colour palette of 
warm and muted natural shades. Guests stroll around the corner to the smart and 
light-filled restaurant, once a leather warehouse, for breakfasts of homemade 
breads and pastries – and, of course, a gourmet “full Irish”.

A charming and informal country house, built in 1728, and near the scenic 
Blackwater valley, this has six elegant bedrooms costing upwards of €198 a 
night B&B. A cheaper option, however, between May and September, is to check in 
to one of the 11 simple bell-tents (or the single, more sturdy, timber-lined 
“glamping arc”) that are set up – behind the croquet lawn and mighty copper 
beech tree – in one of the estate’s mature gardens. Tents have raised timber 
beds, coir carpets and tea-light chandeliers; on arrival, you are given a 
welcome box containing essentials such as matches and head-lamps – and, better 
still, homemade chocolate cookies and local apple juice. A heated washhouse is 
nearby, and glampers get full use of the rooms in the main house, where 
communal breakfasts are served, until noon.

Strictly speaking, you can only book into these two smart rooms above Denis 
Cotter’s famedCafe Paradiso <http://www.cafeparadiso.ie/about/denis-cotter> 
restaurant in Cork city as part of a dinner, B&B package for two. But if you’re 
going to stop over in the vibrant and rebellious “real capital of Ireland”, why 
would you not visit a relaxed and friendly bistro that many consider to be the 
finest vegetarian restaurant in Britain, or Ireland, and even beyond? Both 
double bedrooms have good-size beds, as well as a sofa, CD player/iPod dock, 
mini-fridge, coffee machine and organic bathroom products; the room at the 
front is larger and less red, though potentially more noisy. In-room 
“picnic-style” breakfasts are generous and equally high-quality: a box of 
pastries, plus bread, fruit, granola, yogurt and local farmhouse cheeses.

The 45-minute ferry ride out to Cape Clear, the most southerly inhabited 
island off Ireland’s coast, is one of the country’s great journeys. Passing 
through treacherous tidal waters, you reach a small island remarkable for its 
isolation, beauty, wild weather, spoken Irish, and annual storytelling 
festival. There are no supermarkets, secondary schools, doctors or gardai – 
and, until fairly recently, nowhere much to stay. Launched in 2009 as the first 
glamp site in Ireland, and perched on a clifftop overlooking the south harbour, 
Chléire Haven is a small, well-run eco-campsite with eight Mongolian yurts: 
tall, spacious, round tents that can sleep up to six. They are furnished with 
raised wooden floors, good beds, small kitchens and even wood-burning stoves; 
six have front decks. Lighting is solar-powered, as are the showers.

The historic market town of Kenmare is a perfect stopover on the famed Ring of 
Kerry, if only for the quality of its many bars and restaurants. While there is 
no shortage of guesthouses in the town, your best bet, during May to September 
at least, is to journey 5km out west to the luxury camping at Dromquinna Manor. 
Owned and run by the team behind Kenmare’s five-star Park Hotel, the woodland 
site is in a spectacular setting beside Kenmare Bay. There are high-quality 
king-size “wilderness beds” and showers are nearby. A continental breakfast is 
delivered in the morning and the 40-acre estate has its own shop and waterside 
bistro.

Galway is a compact, historic, vibrant, youthful and cultural seaside city. 
But where to stay? The “luxury city centre boutique” House Hotel may be a 
little too garishly pink, bright and blatant for some but its location in the 
city’s buzzing Latin Quarter, just five minutes from Eyre Square, and its 
good-value room rates, make it a great choice. Some of the 40 rooms are on the 
small side, but most have comfortable king-size beds, as well as Orla Kiely 
toiletries and “rainforest” showers. The hotel also has a good bistro and a 
popular cocktail bar featuring DJs and live music at the weekend.

 The Quay House has won awards for its breakfasts. 
This is a wonderfully restored and elegantly individual Georgian harbourside 
townhouse in the 19th-century market town of Clifden. While not exactly 
minimalist, the 14 period bedrooms are decorated with warmth, charm and 
originality – with lots of rich fabrics, quaint details and original antiques 
and artworks – by owners with a fine eye. Most bedrooms look out over the water 
and fishing boats; all have large bathrooms with tubs and showers. 
Award-winning breakfasts, which include oysters, kedgeree, devilled kidneys and 
homemade brown bread, are served in a bright conservatory. Nearby is the 11km 
circularSky Road <http://www.galway.net/galwayguide/visit/connemara/drives/>, 
so named because it affords big blue views of the strikingly indented Galway 
coastline, and the barren, beautiful Connemara moorlands.

A Victorian building near Ballina, once partly used as cold store for wild 
salmon, with striking modern stone, timber and glass extensions. This is a 
restful quayside retreat owned and run by the husband and wife team behind the 
equally secluded and well-regardedWineport Lodge <http://www.wineport.ie/>, 
near Athlone. The 32 light and spacious bedrooms have underfloor heating, 
goose-down duvets and Voya Irish organic seaweed toiletries. Most have long 
views over the Moy river estuary to the wildlife and woodlands beyond. Other 
highlights include a fine collection of modern Irish art, and complimentary 
access to the hotel spa, with its outdoor cedar barrel sauna and two riverside 
hot tubs.

Donegal: Bruckless House

There are grander Georgian country houses to stop off at in splendid Donegal; 
Rathmullan House <http://www.rathmullanhouse.com/>, on Lough Swilly, for one. 
But the 18th-century Bruckless House, 20km west of Donegal town, more than 
delivers in terms of value, history and tranquillity. The Virginia creeper-clad 
house is in 18 acres of parkland and mature gardens that stretch down to the 
Atlantic shoreline. Bruckless has just one double, one twin, and two single 
rooms, and there is communal dining at the homemade and estate-sourced 
breakfast – so be prepared to be social. Connemara ponies are bred on the 
grounds, and the sea cliffs atSlieve League 
<http://www.ireland.com/en-gb/articles/waw-slieve-league-cliffs/>, some of the 
highest in Europe (and three times higher than the far more visited Cliffs of 
Moher), are just half an hour or so away by car.

Belfast’s first and still best-value boutique hotel is in the Grade I-listed 
Yorkshire House, a former linen warehouse built in 1862. Recently refurbished 
throughout, Ten Square could not be more central to the city: it’s right behind 
City Hall, overlooking Donegall Square and Linenhall Street. The 23 bedrooms 
are boldly designed – in a very royal blue, crushed velvet sort of way – and 
have “super-king-size beds”. A fine full Ulster fry breakfast (with both soda 
and potato bread) is served in the hotel’s restaurant,Jospers Steakhouse 
<http://www.tensquare.co.uk/Jospers/> – a buzzing and popular city spot, along 
with the Linen Bar, especially at weekends.
