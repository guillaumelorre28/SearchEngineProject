That’s it from Guardian Australia’s live blog, but we’ve just launched a 
gallery showcasing how the nation marked the occasion, from parades to 
parklands, to protests around the country.

The predictions of the Tepid 100 <http://thetepid100.tumblr.com/countdown>– a 
project by university student Ed Pitt, who parsed over 2000 ballots that were 
shared on Instagram after voting opened on January 7 – have ended up 
tantalisingly close to the real thing. Of his top six, five ended up in the 
#5-1 spots on the Hottest 100.

But instead of the top spot going to Kendrick Lamar’s ‘King Kunta’ – which 
would have made him the first artist of colour to lead a song to #1 of the 
Hottest 100 – it went to Australian rock band the Rubens, for their track 
Hoops. Their website has already crashed.

Lamar’s King Kunta came in at #2 instead.

And here are #5-3, with Tame Impala sliding two more songs under the wire:

Triple J have now reached the top ten of Australia’s favourite songs, at least 
according to the not-entirely-representative sample who vote in their annual 
poll.

So far, out of 95 songs, 51 have been Australian with ten other countriese 
been represented. Courtney Barnett has had the most songs, with four, and 
Drake’s Hotline Bling has been responsible for the most self-conscious tweets.

We’re now at that curly point of Triple J’s Hottest 100 countdown; the part 
where the real outrage begins.

The top 20 is the sweet spot for the pop/alternative crossover, which upsets 
half the listeners who wanted it to come in higher and the other half who can’t 
believe it got that far at all.

Only thing you can count on? Both parties will publicly refuse to ever listen 
again.

Thousands attend Invasion Day protests

We’ve had numbers come in for the protests across the country for Australia Day
 <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-day>. Organisers in a 
number of cities are saying it is the highest turn outs they have had in years.

In Sydney about 1,000 marched from the Block in Redfern to town hall, 

I don’t mind Australia Day but they can have it on January 1... Because it is 
the day of what I call `the killing times’,” Ken Canning, from the Indigenous 
Social Justice Association, told AAP.

Hundreds of people marched on to Melbourne’s parliament while about 500 people 
protested at Tasmania’s parliament in Hobart.

In Brisbane hundreds chanted “always was, always will be, Aboriginal land,” as 
they marched through the CBD to Musgrave Park in South Brisbane.

The number of people marching in the Northern Territory, Perth and Canberra is 
expected to take the total number of protesters to more than 3,000 aross the 
country.

In their first official charity partnership, Triple J have teamed up with the 
Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience <https://aimementoring.com/> (AIME) 
for this year’s Hottest 100. AIME is a mentoring program which aims to help 
more Indigenous Australians finish high school; 93% of Indigenous students in 
the AIME program completed Year 12, they say, compared to the overall 
Indigenous rate of 59%.
The station are selling T-shirts 
<http://shop.aimementoring.com/collections/hottest-100> and encouraging 
donations on-air andonline <https://aimedonations.raisely.com/>, and calling on 
those hosting Hottest 100 gatherings to take gold coin donations for the cause.

So that’s nice. Also nice? Vallis Alps, a young duo (half Australian, half 
American) who put out their first EP last year – clocking up ten million plays 
before they’d played a live show – have debuted on the Hottest 100 at #27, and 
are probably losing their minds right now.

Check out this Pozible campaign to get cameleers like Monga Khan recognised.

The person behind the campaign <http://www.pozible.com/project/203532>, Peter 
Drew, writes; 

“Help me stick up 1000 of these posters across Australia. The man in this 
poster is Monga Khan who lived and worked in Australia as a Cameleer. He was 
one of thousands of people who applied for exemptions to the White Australia 
Policy.

Cameleers were granted exemptions because their work was essential to the 
Australian economy. For 70 years they played a crucial role... I’d like to 
celebrate their contribution to Australia.”

Kendrick Lamar has entered the Hottest 100 poll with his track Alright, from 
his critically acclaimed third album To Pimp a Butterfly.

This song, Triple J reminds us, has been an unofficial anthem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/29/rap-racism-race-issues-america-black-protest-anthem-kendrick-lamar-janelle-monae-asap-rocky-prince>
 of the #blacklivesmatter movement; the album it came from was described inthe 
Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/29/rap-racism-race-issues-america-black-protest-anthem-kendrick-lamar-janelle-monae-asap-rocky-prince>
 as “a visceral outpouring of this pain, which, in some cases, provided the 
language in which to fight back.”


This won’t be the last we’ll hear from Lamar today. He’s a favourite for the 
top ten, according to boththe bookies 
<http://www.sportsbet.com.au/betting/music/triple-j-hottest-100> and the number 
crunchers 
<http://completepatrick.com/2015/11/24/ultimate-form-guide-for-the-2015-triple-j-hottest-100/>
; meanwhile, university student Ed Pitt’s project theTepid 100 
<http://thetepid100.tumblr.com/countdown>, which compiled the 2,064 ballots 
that were shared on Instagram from the moment voting began on January 7, 
predicts King Kunta will win.

 If it does, Lamar will be the first black American to hit the top spot.


In a surprise twist for those who get surprised by this kind of thing, 
Florence + the Machine’s big song of 2015, Ship to Wreck, featured a few spots 
lower than Delilah; Delilah also beat out Florence’s two-time Grammy-nominated 
track What Kind of Man, which came in at #70.

Hello from Melbourne, Melissa Davey with you here.

I’ll start with news from an important Australian sporting contest.

From AAP: 


What do Crawline Hanson, Ita Buttroach and Alfred Hitcocky have in common?
They have all enjoyed celebrity status on Australia Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-day> by crawling into the 
hall of fame for one of Brisbane’s most dinky di institutions.
The Story Bridge Hotel cockroach races celebrated 35 years on Tuesday and 
Don’t Blush Baby was the first across the line in a win far less controversial 
than cricket star Chris Gayle’s post-match interview.
Maybe that’s because the cocky’s buyer, Irishman Mark Alcorn, had warned him 
to be wary of the girls.
“I said, look you know, don’t be distracted with all the bar girls, all the 
draught ... it’s a big occasion for you but you just stay focused, stick to the 
plan, you got this,” Mr Alcorn said after the win.
It was the first of 14 races at the Kangaroo Point establishment, which had 
thousands of Aussie Day revellers visit throughout the afternoon.

Cockroach MC Damian Burke said the event had grown in popularity since 
originating as a way to settle some river rivalry many years ago.
“It started in 1982 when someone in Bulimba thought the cockroaches there were 
faster than the ones at Kangaroo Point,” he told AAP.
“So we thought we have to have a race to sort this out. Kangaroo Point was the 
clear winner.”
At the start of each race, a container full of marked cockroaches are spilled 
onto a mat with the first to crawl out of the circle declared the winner.
Patrons can buy a cocky to enter into the races, with some 560 of the crawlies 
kept in containers at the back of the stewards’ tent.
They are sourced from a university laboratory, and while some are recaptured, 
where the rest end up is anyone’s guess.
But it’s all for a good cause.
“As the years have gone by we’ve raised over $500,000 for charities,” Mr Burke 
said.

That’s it from Guardian Australia’s live blog, but we’ve just launched a 
gallery showcasing how the nation marked the occasion, from parades to 
parklands, to protests around the country.

Head here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2016/jan/26/australia-day-2016-a-nation-celebrates-and-mourns-in-pictures>
 to view our pick of the bunch.

The predictions of the Tepid 100 <http://thetepid100.tumblr.com/countdown>– a 
project by university student Ed Pitt, who parsed over 2000 ballots that were 
shared on Instagram after voting opened on January 7 – have ended up 
tantalisingly close to the real thing. Of his top six, five ended up in the 
#5-1 spots on the Hottest 100.

But instead of the top spot going to Kendrick Lamar’s ‘King Kunta’ – which 
would have made him the first artist of colour to lead a song to #1 of the 
Hottest 100 – it went to Australian rock band the Rubens, for their track 
Hoops. Their website has already crashed.

Lamar’s King Kunta came in at #2 instead.

And here are #5-3, with Tame Impala sliding two more songs under the wire:

3. Lean On (Ft MØ/DJ Snake) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqeW9_5kURI> by

5. Let it Happen <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odeHP8N4LKc> by Tame Impala 
 
Triple J have now reached the top ten of Australia’s favourite songs, at least 
according to the not-entirely-representative sample who vote in their annual 
poll.

So far, out of 95 songs, 51 have been Australian with ten other countriese 
been represented. Courtney Barnett has had the most songs, with four, and 
Drake’s Hotline Bling has been responsible for the most self-conscious tweets.

We’re now at that curly point of Triple J’s Hottest 100 countdown; the part 
where the real outrage begins.

The top 20 is the sweet spot for the pop/alternative crossover, which upsets 
half the listeners who wanted it to come in higher and the other half who can’t 
believe it got that far at all.

Only thing you can count on? Both parties will publicly refuse to ever listen 
again.

We’ve had numbers come in for the protests across the country for Australia Day
 <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-day>. Organisers in a 
number of cities are saying it is the highest turn outs they have had in years.

In Sydney about 1,000 marched from the Block in Redfern to town hall, 

I don’t mind Australia Day but they can have it on January 1... Because it is 
the day of what I call `the killing times’,” Ken Canning, from the Indigenous 
Social Justice Association, told AAP.

Hundreds of people marched on to Melbourne’s parliament while about 500 people 
protested at Tasmania’s parliament in Hobart.

In Brisbane hundreds chanted “always was, always will be, Aboriginal land,” as 
they marched through the CBD to Musgrave Park in South Brisbane.

The number of people marching in the Northern Territory, Perth and Canberra is 
expected to take the total number of protesters to more than 3,000 aross the 
country.

 
In their first official charity partnership, Triple J have teamed up with the 
Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience <https://aimementoring.com/> (AIME) 
for this year’s Hottest 100. AIME is a mentoring program which aims to help 
more Indigenous Australians finish high school; 93% of Indigenous students in 
the AIME program completed Year 12, they say, compared to the overall 
Indigenous rate of 59%.
The station are selling T-shirts 
<http://shop.aimementoring.com/collections/hottest-100> and encouraging 
donations on-air andonline <https://aimedonations.raisely.com/>, and calling on 
those hosting Hottest 100 gatherings to take gold coin donations for the cause.

So that’s nice. Also nice? Vallis Alps, a young duo (half Australian, half 
American) who put out their first EP last year – clocking up ten million plays 
before they’d played a live show – have debuted on the Hottest 100 at #27, and 
are probably losing their minds right now.

Check out this Pozible campaign to get cameleers like Monga Khan recognised.

The person behind the campaign <http://www.pozible.com/project/203532>, Peter 
Drew, writes; 

“Help me stick up 1000 of these posters across Australia. The man in this 
poster is Monga Khan who lived and worked in Australia as a Cameleer. He was 
one of thousands of people who applied for exemptions to the White Australia 
Policy.

Cameleers were granted exemptions because their work was essential to the 
Australian economy. For 70 years they played a crucial role... I’d like to 
celebrate their contribution to Australia.”

Kendrick Lamar has entered the Hottest 100 poll with his track Alright, from 
his critically acclaimed third album To Pimp a Butterfly.

This song, Triple J reminds us, has been an unofficial anthem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/29/rap-racism-race-issues-america-black-protest-anthem-kendrick-lamar-janelle-monae-asap-rocky-prince>
 of the #blacklivesmatter movement; the album it came from was described inthe 
Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/29/rap-racism-race-issues-america-black-protest-anthem-kendrick-lamar-janelle-monae-asap-rocky-prince>
 as “a visceral outpouring of this pain, which, in some cases, provided the 
language in which to fight back.”


This won’t be the last we’ll hear from Lamar today. He’s a favourite for the 
top ten, according to boththe bookies 
<http://www.sportsbet.com.au/betting/music/triple-j-hottest-100> and the number 
crunchers 
<http://completepatrick.com/2015/11/24/ultimate-form-guide-for-the-2015-triple-j-hottest-100/>
; meanwhile, university student Ed Pitt’s project theTepid 100 
<http://thetepid100.tumblr.com/countdown>, which compiled the 2,064 ballots 
that were shared on Instagram from the moment voting began on January 7, 
predicts King Kunta will win.

 If it does, Lamar will be the first black American to hit the top spot.


In a surprise twist for those who get surprised by this kind of thing, 
Florence + the Machine’s big song of 2015, Ship to Wreck, featured a few spots 
lower than Delilah; Delilah also beat out Florence’s two-time Grammy-nominated 
track What Kind of Man, which came in at #70.

Hello from Melbourne, Melissa Davey with you here.

I’ll start with news from an important Australian sporting contest.

From AAP: 


What do Crawline Hanson, Ita Buttroach and Alfred Hitcocky have in common?
They have all enjoyed celebrity status on Australia Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-day> by crawling into the 
hall of fame for one of Brisbane’s most dinky di institutions.
The Story Bridge Hotel cockroach races celebrated 35 years on Tuesday and 
Don’t Blush Baby was the first across the line in a win far less controversial 
than cricket star Chris Gayle’s post-match interview.
Maybe that’s because the cocky’s buyer, Irishman Mark Alcorn, had warned him 
to be wary of the girls.
“I said, look you know, don’t be distracted with all the bar girls, all the 
draught ... it’s a big occasion for you but you just stay focused, stick to the 
plan, you got this,” Mr Alcorn said after the win.
It was the first of 14 races at the Kangaroo Point establishment, which had 
thousands of Aussie Day revellers visit throughout the afternoon.

Cockroach MC Damian Burke said the event had grown in popularity since 
originating as a way to settle some river rivalry many years ago.
“It started in 1982 when someone in Bulimba thought the cockroaches there were 
faster than the ones at Kangaroo Point,” he told AAP.
“So we thought we have to have a race to sort this out. Kangaroo Point was the 
clear winner.”
At the start of each race, a container full of marked cockroaches are spilled 
onto a mat with the first to crawl out of the circle declared the winner.
Patrons can buy a cocky to enter into the races, with some 560 of the crawlies 
kept in containers at the back of the stewards’ tent.
They are sourced from a university laboratory, and while some are recaptured, 
where the rest end up is anyone’s guess.
But it’s all for a good cause.
“As the years have gone by we’ve raised over $500,000 for charities,” Mr Burke 
said.
 
That’s it from me for today, I’ll leave you in the capable hands of Melissa 
Davey in Melbourne. Below are some great pictures from Sydney’s Yabun Festival.
