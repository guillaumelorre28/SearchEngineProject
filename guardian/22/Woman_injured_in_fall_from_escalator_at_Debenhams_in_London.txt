The woman, who was in her early 20s according to onlookers, is being treated 
in hospital after the incident on Sunday afternoon.

It is thought she landed on a large advertising sign in the basement level of 
the store. Police said her injuries were not life-threatening.

Last year a man died after falling from the escalators in the same store. 

Lorena Aliaga, 28, who was shopping in the store at the time, said: “I was in 
the fourth floor chatting next to the cashiers. Suddenly we heard people 
screaming and running and the supervisor said: ‘Oh no, not again.’


“I just ran into the stairs and saw the girl laid on the basement floor with a 
few people around. I could tell she was alive as I saw her moving her legs by 
herself. Her body was facing up and her legs sideways. She was young, in her 
20s. People were shocked so we decided to get out of there. It was horrible.”

A Metropolitan police spokeswoman said: “We were called at 15.24hrs on Sunday 
27 September toDebenhams <https://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams>, 
Oxford Street, to reports of a woman fallen from an escalator.

“Police, London air ambulance and London ambulance service attended. The woman 
was taken to a central London hospital suffering from serious injuries. She is 
currently still detained in a serious but stable condition. The incident is not 
being treated as suspicious. Inquiries are ongoing.”

A Debenhams spokeswoman said: “Yesterday an incident involving a customer took 
place in our Oxford Street store. Paramedics were called to attend the scene 
immediately. The customer has been transferred to hospital for treatment and is 
accompanied by a store manager.

“Debenhams is working with the relevant authorities to conduct a full 
investigation into the matter,” she said.
