Straighteners have evolved. Just in time for poker-straight hair – hair that 
is glass-like in its shine, polished and sleek – to come back into fashion. 
Rather than iron your hair into submission, these 2016 tools steam it, or have 
a lower heat setting than earlier models, with most brands adding little tricks 
(such as treatment cartridges for coloured hair) to protect and moisturise, too.
