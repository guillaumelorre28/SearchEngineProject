This was meant to be Vogue’s year. The British version of the magazine turned 
100, resulting in, among other celebratory goings-on, an exhibition at London’s 
National Portrait Gallery,Vogue 100: A Century of Style 
<http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/vogue/exhibition.php>, telling the story of one 
of the world’s most influential magazines. But a turn of events, and the social 
media reaction, threw a stiletto at the brand’s well-manicured public 
appearance and demonstrated very publicly an insurgency that is under way next 
to the catwalk.

During a round-table discussion about Milan fashion week, editors on Vogue’s 
American edition gave their views on style bloggers, and it was damning. 
Questioning the street-style business model of wearing paid-for brand 
placements, they used descriptors like “desperate” and said it “herald(ed) the 
death of style”. In response, style blogger Susie Bubble tweeted: “The fashion 
establishment don’t want their circles enlarged and for the ivory tower to 
remain just that. Towering and impenetrable.”

The incident highlighted how the ground beneath the establishment’s feet has 
shifted this season.See-now-buy-now

 and genderless catwalks have reflected economic and social shifts towards a 
younger mindset, while Bubble’s point about enlarging circles could equally 
read as a comment on what’s been happening on the front row (the “Frow”) in 
this summer’s global fashion shows.

Traditionally the place where old Hollywood glamour mixed with fashion 
journalism, the Frow has shifted its allegiances, actively courting a younger 
and more social media-savvy crowd. Dolce & Gabbana’s Milan fashion week show 
was an extreme example of this. It saw the fashion house fly in a range of 
millennial celebrities, such as Cameron Dallas, Lily-Rose Depp, Lucky Blue 
Smith and Rafferty Law, to sit in pride of place. The Frow resembled a 
particularly large group selfie, where mainstream media journalists were 
relegated to the second row.

Meanwhile, the kitschy, high-energy presentation featured street dancers, 
model Hailey Baldwin and a pre-show soundtrack of Justin Bieber, pointed 
attempts to capture not just hearts and minds but the smartphone’s lens too. As 
the show came to a close, exiting fashionistas, such as Anna Wintour, were met 
by swarms of pre-pubescent girls screaming not for her but for the heart-throbs 
they follow on Vine or Instagram. It was Beatlemania for Generation Z.

Backstage before the show, Stefano Gabbana admitted that the label was trying 
to appeal to a younger market. “We looked at the millennials [for 
inspiration],” he said. “Everyone wants to be young.”

The appeal to fashion labels is clear: a Frow full of social media-savvy 
celebs creates publicity and generates sales. “Vloggers, Viners and Instagram 
celebs almost exist for endorsements,” says Malcolm Mackenzie, editor ofWe Love 
Pop magazine. “They don’t have a day job, like shooting a movie, to get in the 
way of self-promotion, because self-promotionis their day job.”

But arranging the seating plan of the Frow can be a tricky jigsaw to solve. 
“My feeling is that it’s always a balance – you want heavy-hitter celebrities, 
but the editors are just as vital with huge followings, too,” says Mandi 
Lennard, fashion PR and consultant. “It’s a delicate balance, as you don’t want 
to make an editor feel neglected.”

But perhaps editors just need to adapt to the times: 2016 has seen the fashion 
industry focus on young celebrities who fit the Hailey Baldwin template: 
heritage names with large social media followings. “Stars like Dallas have a 
direct line to millions of fans who avidly watch everything they do, so it’s a 
no-brainer for business to want in on the action,” says Mackenzie. Things can 
only get younger.
