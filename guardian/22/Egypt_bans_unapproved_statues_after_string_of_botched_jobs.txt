In response to a series of questionable statues that have sprung up in Egypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt>, the prime minister has banned all 
public artworks not approved by the ministry of culture.

Sherif Ismail issued the decree <http://onaeg.com/?p=2718986> after a 
controversial statue was unveiled in the eastern city of Sohag.

Depicting a martyred soldier embracing his mother, the sculpture was met with 
anger last week, with many people suggesting that itportrayed sexual harassment

.

Sohag’s governor has since ordered an investigation and said the provincial 
government should have been consulted before the work, which cost 250,000 
Egyptian pounds (£21,150), was built. It has since undergone “modifications”, 
according to reports.

Last year, a statue in the north-east town of Samalut attracted public scorn 
for its ill-conceived depiction of theEgyptian queen Nefertiti 
<http://www.madamasr.com/sections/culture/big-ups-big-downs-year%E2%80%99s-z-arts-phenomena-egypt>
, which quicklyearned the nickname “Frankenstein” 
<http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/07/travel/nefertiti-statue-egypt/>. 

The interpretation was so provocative that Samalut authorities decided to tear 
it down in July 2015 following widespread ridicule on social media.

One Twitter user, @mazenalsarhan, wrote: “I believe in the pharaonic curse and 
I hope it casts its spells on all of those who were involved and agreed on 
distorting the beauty of all beauties #nefertiti.”

Another memorably lacklustre statue was that of Col Urābī Pasha, the leader of 
Egypt’s armed resistance movement against British forces in the late 1800s, 
which was erected in the Nile delta region of Sharqia.

Also widely mocked, the work depicts a green likeness of Urābī riding a 
cartoonish white horse. Last month, municipal authorities in the village of 
Hurriyet Razna, the colonel’s birthplace,ordered the repainting

 of the statue.

Privately owned news outlet Youm7 has reported 
<http://www.youm7.com/story/2016/8/21/%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%B2-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%82-%D8%AA%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A8/2851863>
 that local authorities could impose penalties on the statue’s builders and 
will move “to restore [the square in which it is located to] its aesthetic 
appearance”.

Elsewhere, along the Cairo-Ismailia desert highway, a sculpture of a bronze 
male athlete flexing his biceps was recently painted brown, with white paint 
used for his hair and swimsuit.

Egyptian social media was quickly filled with derision about the botched paint 
job, with some users suggesting that it looked like an ageing manwearing white 
pants

An unusual statue commemorating the composer and singer Mohamed Abdel Wahab 
<http://www.madamasr.com/tags/mohamed-abdel-wahab> in his birthplace of Bab 
al-Shareya was also criticised for more closely resembling theformer president 
Hosni Mubarak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/feb/01/hosni-mubarak-egypt-president-political-career>
.

The fibreglass statue was later damaged after falling off its base 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQZDqUyq9mw> in 2014, apparently after several 
pro-government banners were tied around its neck.
