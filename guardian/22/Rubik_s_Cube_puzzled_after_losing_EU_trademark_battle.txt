It’s the familiar multicoloured 3D brainteaser that has challenged puzzle 
enthusiasts for more than 40 years and is still the world’s bestselling toy of 
all time.

But on Thursday – after a 10-year legal tussle – Rubik’s Cube 
<https://uk.rubiks.com/> lost a key trademark battle after the European court 
of justice (ECJ) said its shape was not sufficient to grant it protection from 
copycat versions.

The eponymous puzzle, invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and architect 
Prof Ernő Rubik, is popular among young and old, with more than 350m cubes sold 
worldwide.

UK company Seven Towers, which oversees Rubik’s Cube intellectual property 
rights, registered the shape as a three-dimensional EU trademark with the 
European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in April 1999.

But the court ruled that the EU trademark representing the shape of the 
Rubik’s Cube <https://uk.rubiks.com/> was invalid. The ruling has ramifications 
for the game’s various licensed manufacturers, includingJohn Adams in the UK

face competition from mass-produced, cheaper imitations.

In May, a judge said the shape did not qualify for trademark protection. The 
case was brought by the German firm SimbaToys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/toys>, which had challenged the 
trademark protection in 2006, claiming the cube’s rotating capability should be 
protected by a patent, not a trademark.

The European court of justice ruled: “In examining whether registration ought 
to be refused on the ground that shape involved a technical solution, EUIPO and 
the general court should also have taken into account non-visible functional 
elements represented by that shape, such as its rotating capability.”

The Rubik’s Cube is made up of turning miniature cubes. It was initially known 
as the Magic Cube and sold from a Budapest toy shop but was renamed in 1980 and 
launched worldwide.

According to NPD Group, the global information company, the Rubik’s Cube 
becamethe third bestselling game or puzzle in the UK this year, after thePie

David Kremer, president of Rubik’s Brand in the UK, said: “We are disappointed 
by today’s decision by the ECJ. While the Rubik Brand is fortunate in having 
other trademarks, copyright, passing off and unfair competition protection to 
rely on which will continue to ensure its exclusivity, this judgment sets a 
damaging precedent for companies wishing to innovate and create strong brands 
and distinctive marks within the EU, and is not what European lawmakers 
intended when they legislated for 3D trademarks. We are baffled that the court 
finds functionality or a technical solution implicit in the trademark.”

Alex Brodie, a partner with international lawyers Gowling WLG, said:“Simba 
Toys have been successful, after 10 years of legal wrangling, in getting rid of 
Rubik’s 3D cube trademark. This judgment underlines the law that trademark 
registrations should not be used to obtain an eternal monopoly on technical 
solutions or functional characteristics of products – that protection is 
something that may be covered by other rights such as patent law – protection 
that has a limited life unlike trademarks. A great impact is likely to be on 
the toy and game industry who will be considering their portfolio of 3D 
trademark registrations to assess how viable those registrations are.”

The case is the latest in a series of high-profile failures to secure 
trademark protection for unusual and distinctive shapes.After a lengthy legal 
tussle, Nestlé was unable to trademark its four-finger chocolate bar KitKat in 
the UK, after a high court ruling inJanuary.
