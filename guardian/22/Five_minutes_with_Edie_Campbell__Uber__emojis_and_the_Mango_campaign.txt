Daughter of architect Sophie Hicks (a regular on the Tatler List 
<http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list/h/sophie-hicks>), Campbell has the 
blue-blood looks of someone who grew up between Notting Hill and 
Northamptonshire: big, round blue eyes, rangy limbs and a kind of great sullen, 
stompy expression best accessorised by the countryside.

And the countryside plays a big part in Campbell’s latest job – in the 
autumn/winter campaign for Mango. The campaign features Campbell and fellow 
modelNatalie Westling 
<https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/natalie-westling-is-the-face-of-a-generation>
 striding forth in the mountains of Northern Spain in some very nice winter 
clothing, with moss and rocks as a backdrop. When Campbell isn’t walking the 
runway or aesthetically improving the landscape around the Lago del Valle, 
she’s a normal twentysomething girl. Here’s what she thinks about some normal 
twentysomething girl things.

What’s your favourite cocktail?
A Bloody Mary in winter and an Aperol Spritz in summer.

What are the best and worst things about your job?I like the travel, I like 
the informal atmosphere, I like the intensity of it, I like the people I work 
with. The worst part is the uncertainty.

What is your most-used emoji?
The kissy face because I’m a generous and loving person, obviously!

What is your Uber rating? 
I don’t think it’s very good, because I always get impatient and cancel cars 
if they’re taking too long. Oh, I just checked – it’s 4.2. I don’t think that’s 
very good, is it?
