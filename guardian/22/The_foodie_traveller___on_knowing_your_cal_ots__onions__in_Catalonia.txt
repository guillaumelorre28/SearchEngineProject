The Catalans don’t have a reputation as the most fun-loving bunch. The rest of 
Spain would probably describe them as hardworking and businesslike, but also 
tight and uptight. Their detractors have clearly never been to acalçotada, a 
barbecue meal unique to the area and devoted to a variety of giant spring 
onion. Groups of friends and family dissolve into giggles and laughter as they 
gather round tables set out in courtyards, put on silly paper bibs and get down 
and dirty with acalçot.

First, the fire-blackened outer layer of the onion is pulled away to reveal a 
juicy white core. Then the tip is dipped intoromesco (nut and red pepper) sauce 
and the dripping calçot is lowered into the mouth in one go. You repeat this 
two or three dozen times. Do it badly and your face, hands and neck end up a 
black and red mess. Do it well and, er, it’s about the same.

There are mounds of grilled meat to follow, washed down with red wine from a 
porró, a traditional glass pitcher. Drinking from one is almost impossible 
unless you learn it as a baby. In unskilled hands it spouts wine everywhere 
except the mouth. Cue more laughter.

The town of Valls, near Tarragona, is calçot central. Tens of thousands are 
wolfed down during an annual festival (25 January in 2015,festadelacalsotada.com
 <http://www.festadelacalsotada.com/>) devoted to the slippery scallion. Lots 
of restaurants in the Catalan countryside also do a good calçotada. The season 
runs from December to April. Try, for example,Sol Ric on the edge of Tarragona 
<http://restaurantesolric.es/> (calcotada €32). City dwellers have developed a 
taste, too –El Glop <http://tavernaelglop.com/> (€26) in Barcelona’s Gràcia 
district is a good bet.
