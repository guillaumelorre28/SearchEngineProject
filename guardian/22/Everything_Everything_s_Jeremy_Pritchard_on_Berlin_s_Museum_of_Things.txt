I got interested in German social history because I‘m a massive fan of the band
Kraftwerk <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kraftwerk>. Their whole metier was 
postwar Germany rewriting the script: a generation trying to reclaim some of 
its national characteristics. The Museum der Dinge is a great place to 
contemplate this history. It’s literally the Museum of Things and offers a walk 
through the consumer aspirations of the 20th century.

It is charmingly unprofessional, so unlike the V&A. Here you have mundane 
everyday objects but presented in contexts that make you think about them 
differently. You can wander through and choose a thread to follow: yellow 
things, say, or things from a certain period, or that perform a certain 
function.

There’s a constant juxtaposition of the dowdiness of DDR products and the 
technological goods produced in the west. One art deco television would take up 
a whole room. It looks like a space rocket. The shop is really nice as well. I 
bought a poster print of the whole of Das Kapital by Karl Marx in tiny, tiny 
German text.
