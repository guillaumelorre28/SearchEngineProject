Unless you have been under a rock, you’ll know padded jackets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/23/padded-down-how-should-you-wear-this-season-jacket>
 are a thing for autumn – and they are arguably even more of a thing when 
designed by Marc Newson, the man who has made everything from chairs to cars to 
toasters look far less everyday than they actually are, and caused wrists to 
vibrate with theApplewatch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/apr/28/apple-watch-jess-cartner-morley-phone>
. His take on the padded jacket, then, is actually called an overshirt, a word 
that we’re really into because it implies a whole new category of clothing to 
get excited about. This down overshirt, designed byNewson for G-Star 
<https://www.g-star.com/en_gb/product/men/marc-newson/61.162.D02589.8580.6330>, 
comes with the pleasing Michelin man-style folds of the traditional padded 
jacket but mixes them with the collar and cuffs of a shirt. The result? A 
typically Newson twist on a classic that’s neither shirt or jacket, and is 
therefore very useful in a country where the weather changes by the second. It 
also allows you to use the word “overshirt” with legitimacy. Forget usefulness 
and anything to do with trends – that fact alone makes it a worthy purchase 
this autumn.
