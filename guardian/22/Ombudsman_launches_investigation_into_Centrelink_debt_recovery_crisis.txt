The ombudsman has launched a broad, self-initiated investigation into the 
Centrelink automated debt recovery scandal, as the Labor leader,Bill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten>, demanded the 
automated system be suspended.

“This farce has to end,” Shorten told Fairfax Media 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/centrelink-debt-recovery-drive-has-caused-summer-from-hell-bill-shorten-says-20170108-gtns33.html>
. “This stuff-up has delivered a summer from hell for thousands of people who 
have done absolutely nothing wrong.”

Both the independent, Andrew Wilkie, and Senator Nick Xenophon had referred 
the debt recovery system to the commonwealth ombudsman’s office 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/21/ombudsman-asked-to-investigate-if-centrelink-wrongly-pursuing-welfare-debts>
before Christmas, amidmounting complaints that it was sending incorrect debt 
notices on a large scale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/29/government-confident-in-centrelink-debt-compliance-system-despite-reported-errors>
.

But the deputy ombudsman, Richard Glenn, told Guardian Australia on Monday the 
office had decided to launch an investigation of its own accord, describing it 
as an “issue of significant interest to this office”.

 “I can certainly say the ombudsman has approved an own-motion investigation 
into the matter,” Glenn said.

“That is self-initiated, this one will be self-initiated because we have a 
number of complaints and there is significant public controversy about the 
issue. So it is an inquiry into the issue at large, rather than into a specific 
complaint,” he said.

“Certainly there’s enough information from complaints we’ve received and … 
it’s an issue of significant interest to this office, and we’ll be pursuing it.”

The ombudsman’s investigation will focus on problems with the automated 
data-matching process being used to compareCentrelink 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/centrelink> and tax office records, 
the quality of Centrelink’s communication with its customers and the management 
of the subsequent process.

“It’s a big program, it’s a big item to have a look at. We don’t really have a 
handle on how long it’s going to take to do it,” Glenn said. “Really we need to 
get our heads around how the technology works, and what the responses are to 
the technology.

“It’s going to take some resources to do the job, we have some available, 
we’re certainly able to pull resources from across the agency to do it, so it 
shouldn’t be a major impact on us.”

Glenn said the decision to remove human oversight of the data-matching process 
would be “certainly one of the issues we will look at”.

“Clearly there have been some differences in the program compared to the way 
it’s worked in the past, both in volume and the way the technology works.


“It’s quite clear that there’s an issue surrounding how the program works 
because of the sort of the complaints that we’re seeing.”

He said the Department of Human Services had so far been cooperative and 
accommodating to the ombudsman’s office.

The ombudsman’s powers are limited. It can make only recommendations, and is 
not able to compel change. But Glenn said the office could report publicly.

Wilkie welcomed the decision, saying it would be of some comfort to many of 
the individuals affected.

He described it as a “victory for common sense and appropriate oversight of 
government policy”.

“My office continues to receive a large number of complaints from the 
community from people who are being wrongly accused of owing Centrelink money 
or at least finding it near on impossible to substantiate their income going 
back as far as 2010,” Wilkie said.


“The scale of this problem is beyond doubt, not least because Centrelink 
itself has admitted knowingly sending out as many as 4,000 incorrect debt 
notices a week.”

victory for common sense and appropriate oversight of government policy.


The system could also face the scrutiny of the auditor general, following a 
referral from Labor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/06/centrelinks-debt-recovery-failures-referred-to-auditor-general-by-labor>
, and the information and privacy commissioner, who has been in contact with 
the department.
