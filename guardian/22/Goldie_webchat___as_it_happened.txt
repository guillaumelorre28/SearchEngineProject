Really appreciate the fact we're here after all this time. Yes, people get too 
deep with questions - I'm just a kid from the Midlands having a fucking laugh. 
I'm just blessed guys. I'll try very much not to give Derrick May the finger 
again.

I have a postcode on my window, it states: I have learned so much from my 
mistakes in life, I'd like to make a few more.

There are some differing and often strong opinions on the emergence of 
‘dubstep’, ‘dark step’ and everything in between - through the drum & bass 
scene all the way to pop music in the charts.

Do you think the sometimes negative opinions on the popularisation of emerging 
genres such as dubstep are justified, or should audiences and producers simply 
accept and embrace any new trend emerging from their scene?

Simply accept and embrace, but when a genre runs too far ahead without having 
the many years of its precious mastering years underneath it, it can be 
somewhat undermined by the gravitas or running before one can walk. It reminds 
me of the Family Guy sketch where Peter falls and hurts his knees.

IC3 in goal. Frostie, Dbridge on the wing. Mampi Swift midfield. J Majik in 
goal too, so he can get the ball in his face. Paul Jubei in defence. Bryan Gee 
right back. Strikers: Dillinja and Calibre. And Burial serving ice cream. SP:MC 
polishing shoes in the boot room.

That story you tell, in that documentary, about giving the finger to Derrick 
May as you left him to listen to inner City Life in your car, wasn’t that a 
little bit juvenile?

What is your opinion now on May and his influence on UK dance culture?

Of course it was. As me and Derrick are very close friends, and we speak all 
the time about this - do you not have a laugh with your mates, or have done 
over the years? Get a grip, you need to go out more. Too deep for my liking son.

Hi Sir Goldie! I’m a Street Art Photographer and a DJ, knowing your background 
with Graffiti and DJing, would you ever claim a space on a wall somewhere in 
London and produce an artwork of your own? Would your Artwork be as an alias

still get goosebumps when you’re behind the decks??

Yeah would love to! I've always wanted a space that I could fuck around with. 
Me and Tats crew did one a couple of years back, in Sidmouth Road. Always up 
for a wall if someone's got on. Just got back from Thailand where we hit a 
couple of walls really hard - painting out there illegally is like the 80s. No 
brainer. If you've got a spot let me know.

To the hilt. To the point where I just bollocked my label manager Antony about 
a typo error. Every day my friend, I get involved in shaping this label. And to 
be fair Antony is a phenomenal label manager who thinks how I think about how 
we should move forward. Currently we have Dom and Roland's album in the 
workings, AI's album is complete and is phenomenal, Mikal is complete also. We 
have a great schedule for the next 18 months, and I'm happy to say that like 
everything we had to reinvent it - it suffered for a few years. And now it's 
back on all cylinders, and I'm completely made up with the artistic quality of 
work we have at the moment. So yes, the answer is: I'm all over it like a rash.

DON'T FUCKING START ME OFF. I'm fed up of local authorities using the graffiti 
moniker which they hounded so badly in the 80s to come and cover up their 
building sites of unfinished business within the city. The least you could do, 
as I've always offered, is to fund the basic necessity of providing paint for 
some of these young artists, which will gladly brighten up your environment. 
This isn't a question of whether or not graffiti is illegal or not - from the 
moment you put graffiti inside the Moca gallery in LA, it's accepted. It's as 
much a part of our culture as a cup of tea.

We need to change the way that urban music and graffiti is accepted in this 
country. Why isn't yoga and parkour being taught in schools? The local 
authority is extremely out of touch with what the arts actually is, let alone 
protect it. I find it sad that there are many artists that have come through 
the hard slog of 30 years and learned the hard way with street culture alike 
that have experienced far more than academics - that could engage in their 
community with the help of the local authority who are still working out what 
to do, whilst there youth culture is imploding and slipping through their very 
fat fingers. Very simple in the UK: handball courts, parkour, music schools. 
Handball courts - you can play anything, you can paint them. Like Sidmouth Road 
- a grey area, local writers do it for themselves. This is something that 
should be built for us.

"When in Rome, eat lions." That was by a guy called J Pender. David Bowie's 
quote which was: "always blow the dust off the block of marble, the sculpture 
lies beneath." And another great quote I swear by is: do you slee? No, I'll 
sleep when I'm dead. One more, it's my own: "People always ask me about the 
future? There is none, what we do today creates tomorrow."

Stephen Fry once recommended me a book which stuck with me: Sum, by David 
Eagleton. Another fantastic book is the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying. John 
Niven, Kill Your Friends. How Yoga Works by Christie McNally, a fictional book. 
Fuzz One, a graffiti book about a kid in the train yards of New York.

How does visual art influence your sound? – Albert of Realist Radio

I'm Dorian motherfucking Grey of breakbeat. He has a portrait hidden away, an 
ugly grotesque self portrait, however, I don't have one. What I have is a 
landscape picture, a surround landscape picture. Yes at times an ugly 
background, but beautiful nonetheless. I take all of my visual journey into my 
music regardless, always have done. I think if an artist gets to a point where 
you can play enough of your music, and paint and be creative, one then becomes 
its own paradox. I could throw a breakbeat into a harmonizer and it becomes its 
own music - the paintings will begat more paintings, more sound. Painting and 
music are very much the same.

People always ask me, I really want to do something on the label. I don't know 
what to do. It's not actually that hard? If you want to make something - go to 
an experience you have, and write what you want to achieve. Programming, 
engineering, these are things you can explore, but that's the difference - if 
you explore yourself as a character. No-one can judge individuality; if you 
produce something to sound like someone else, you're second best. Originality 
breeds contempt - you have to be contemptible, push the envelope. Being 
creative is not about being in front of the computer screen, like this fucking 
guy here who's tying so fucking fast his fingers are bleeding [namely me - Ed] 
it's about interaction, being open with one's idea, getting a notebook, writing 
ideas down. What's a vocal example? What do I want the drums to sound like? 90% 
of music is about not being shy of your inhibitions.

If you had to pick one of Reece’s Pulp Fiction, Dillinja’s Angels Fell or 
Source Direct’s Made Up Sound as Metalheadz’ finest moment, which would it be 
and why?

I'll play devil's advocate. There's only one record on the label that I'm not 
happy with, and I'm never going to tell you. There's one on the label, and one 
of my own making as well. Angels Fell has to be it though. Driving to his house 
from Brixton, and Carl will always quote Ghosts as being a big influence for 
him. Angels Fell has a special place in my heart and always will do - he was 
changing into a profound artist, but his sound had been the same for so long. 
He is the king of bass, no contest. But the moniker Metalheadz means you can 
shape an artist and get the best out of them - and that EP is one of the 
greatest ever made. Angels Fell allowed me to sculpt an EP into finite detail: 
Blade Runner, only I've seen what I've seen with me eyes. It was about a 
vision, trailblazing, and that gave this EP such a B-boy aspect, of taking 
things out. This was a thing for me: the b-boy attitude.

For the record, one of the things to understand as far as this culture is 
concerned... between Dillinja and Calibre, everyone else is in the middle. 
You've got two polarities of music, in terms of what drum'n'bass can be and how 
widespread. I always felt Timeless was the orbit - everything floats in the 
orbit of Timeless, and everything else, myself included, floats in the middle 
of that.

There are some differing and often strong opinions on the emergence of 
‘dubstep’, ‘dark step’ and everything in between - through the drum & bass 
scene all the way to pop music in the charts.

Do you think the sometimes negative opinions on the popularisation of emerging 
genres such as dubstep are justified, or should audiences and producers simply 
accept and embrace any new trend emerging from their scene?

Simply accept and embrace, but when a genre runs too far ahead without having 
the many years of its precious mastering years underneath it, it can be 
somewhat undermined by the gravitas or running before one can walk. It reminds 
me of the Family Guy sketch where Peter falls and hurts his knees.

Of course it was. As me and Derrick are very close friends, and we speak all

over the years? Get a grip, you need to go out more. Too deep for my liking son.

To the hilt. To the point where I just bollocked my label manager Antony about 
a typo error. Every day my friend, I get involved in shaping this label. And to 
be fair Antony is a phenomenal label manager who thinks how I think about how 
we should move forward. Currently we have Dom and Roland's album in the 
workings, AI's album is complete and is phenomenal, Mikal is complete also. We 
have a great schedule for the next 18 months, and I'm happy to say that like 
everything we had to reinvent it - it suffered for a few years. And now it's 
back on all cylinders, and I'm completely made up with the artistic quality of 
work we have at the moment. So yes, the answer is: I'm all over it like a rash.

DON'T FUCKING START ME OFF. I'm fed up of local authorities using the graffiti 
moniker which they hounded so badly in the 80s to come and cover up their 
building sites of unfinished business within the city. The least you could do, 
as I've always offered, is to fund the basic necessity of providing paint for 
some of these young artists, which will gladly brighten up your environment. 
This isn't a question of whether or not graffiti is illegal or not - from the 
moment you put graffiti inside the Moca gallery in LA, it's accepted. It's as 
much a part of our culture as a cup of tea.

We need to change the way that urban music and graffiti is accepted in this 
country. Why isn't yoga and parkour being taught in schools? The local 
authority is extremely out of touch with what the arts actually is, let alone 
protect it. I find it sad that there are many artists that have come through 
the hard slog of 30 years and learned the hard way with street culture alike 
that have experienced far more than academics - that could engage in their 
community with the help of the local authority who are still working out what 
to do, whilst there youth culture is imploding and slipping through their very 
fat fingers. Very simple in the UK: handball courts, parkour, music schools. 
Handball courts - you can play anything, you can paint them. Like Sidmouth Road 
- a grey area, local writers do it for themselves. This is something that 
should be built for us.

How does visual art influence your sound? – Albert of Realist Radio

I'm Dorian motherfucking Grey of breakbeat. He has a portrait hidden away, an 
ugly grotesque self portrait, however, I don't have one. What I have is a 
landscape picture, a surround landscape picture. Yes at times an ugly 
background, but beautiful nonetheless. I take all of my visual journey into my 
music regardless, always have done. I think if an artist gets to a point where 
you can play enough of your music, and paint and be creative, one then becomes 
its own paradox. I could throw a breakbeat into a harmonizer and it becomes its 
own music - the paintings will begat more paintings, more sound. Painting and 
music are very much the same.

People always ask me, I really want to do something on the label. I don't know 
what to do. It's not actually that hard? If you want to make something - go to 
an experience you have, and write what you want to achieve. Programming, 
engineering, these are things you can explore, but that's the difference - if 
you explore yourself as a character. No-one can judge individuality; if you 
produce something to sound like someone else, you're second best. Originality 
breeds contempt - you have to be contemptible, push the envelope. Being 
creative is not about being in front of the computer screen, like this fucking 
guy here who's tying so fucking fast his fingers are bleeding [namely me - Ed] 
it's about interaction, being open with one's idea, getting a notebook, writing 
ideas down. What's a vocal example? What do I want the drums to sound like? 90% 
of music is about not being shy of your inhibitions.

I'll play devil's advocate. There's only one record on the label that I'm not 
happy with, and I'm never going to tell you. There's one on the label, and one 
of my own making as well. Angels Fell has to be it though. Driving to his house 
from Brixton, and Carl will always quote Ghosts as being a big influence for 
him. Angels Fell has a special place in my heart and always will do - he was 
changing into a profound artist, but his sound had been the same for so long. 
He is the king of bass, no contest. But the moniker Metalheadz means you can 
shape an artist and get the best out of them - and that EP is one of the 
greatest ever made. Angels Fell allowed me to sculpt an EP into finite detail: 
Blade Runner, only I've seen what I've seen with me eyes. It was about a 
vision, trailblazing, and that gave this EP such a B-boy aspect, of taking 
things out. This was a thing for me: the b-boy attitude.

For the record, one of the things to understand as far as this culture is 
concerned... between Dillinja and Calibre, everyone else is in the middle. 
You've got two polarities of music, in terms of what drum'n'bass can be and how 
widespread. I always felt Timeless was the orbit - everything floats in the 
orbit of Timeless, and everything else, myself included, floats in the middle 
of that.
