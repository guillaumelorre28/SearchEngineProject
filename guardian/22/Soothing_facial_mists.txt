There was a time when we scoffed at the idea of spending real cash on a spray 
can of water. We were so innocent then. Today, every brand worth its salt has 
brought out a facial mist – “vitamin-infused”, “make-up setting”, “tanning”, 
“radiance restoring”… While I have no doubt they perform all these magical 
tricks, their real skill is sitting on your desk to calm you down after a 
sweaty rush to work. A priceless task, if you ask me.
