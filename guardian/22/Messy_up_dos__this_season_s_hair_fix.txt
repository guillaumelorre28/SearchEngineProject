“It’s the way a very real woman would do her hair,” said Guido, Redken’s 
creative director, at the SS16 catwalk shows. Of course, the pretend women can 
learn. For this season’s mussed up-do (varieties included windswept twists, 
ratted braids, unravelling buns and ponytail flips) just add products for 
texture and grip. To replicate the looks at Lanvin and Ferretti, dress with a 
pretty bow or clip.
