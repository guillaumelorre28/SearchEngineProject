What influenced your decision to pick Italian pop songs in general, and the 
specific songs on the album? Did you speak any Italian prior to recording them?

Also there’s a Scottish beer named after you:

I fell in love with an Italian record producer. He surrounded me with Italian 
music. I've always loved Mina, and the more I researched her, the more in love 
with her I became. The song Non Credre was the first one I tackled, and it was 
as much her performance of the song, as seen on YouTube, as the song itself 
that led me to take up this challenge.

These feminine icons, both Mina and Patty Pravo, seem to be hugely modern in 
their performances, which are full of wit. I cannot overstate their influence 
on me at this point in my career.

And I used to drink Guinness, because I was told it was good for you. I 
recently found out the opposite is true. Silly me.

Hello Roisin, can you tell us more about the different visual characters you 
created forHairless Toys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/07/roisin-murphy-hairless-toys-review>
? Who are these women and what’s their stories?

I do love to play in the visual side of all this. I thought I would be a 
visual artist when I was growing up, so I'm always up for a bit of 
experimentation.

On Hairless Toys, I've tried to create an ambiguous character to go with an 
ambiguous record. She's anything but rock'n'roll – she's so not rock'n'roll 
that, in a twisted way, she's kind of radical. She's like someone from my 
memory, almost like my mother, and she's lost in some space-time between the 
1960s and the late 80s.

She, like me, has been away in her own world for quite some time and as she 
enters the fray, she's seen as an oddball outsider. In no way is she trying to 
be a teenager or "youth": my work is no longer about youth culture in any way, 
as I am a realist.

Angie is quite a lady.

Hello Little Rose, in not 1 but 2 of your videos you are featured doing things 
on the lavatory, which suggests that this much ignored and ignored location has 
some special significance in the World Of Róisín Murphy. Would you care to

Often, I try to make videos that are not like videos: anything other than look 
like a pop video! So, the videos become more cinematic, less 
all-singing-and-dancing, and more psychological and dramatic. This, for some 
reason, has led me to the toilet. Perhaps it's short-form for intimacy.

What’s your favourite song that never made it onto an album? What will happen 
to the two tracks you have performed live but have yet to release –Demon Lover

I can't tell you what's going to happen to those songs: maybe one day they 
will reach the light of day, but for now I have 25 other songs I need to worry 
about as I wrote a mountain of tracks with Eddie Stevens last year and only 
eight made it to Hairless Toys.

For sure, there's another album there and maybe an EP.

Fish and Chips in paper or Michelin star restaurants?

I'll tell you what, it's hard to get a good fish and chips these days, and the 
cod is nearly gone! So, it's quite a delicacy nowadays. I was brought up around 
a fish and chips shop – or a chipper, we call it in Ireland – and my nana ran 
it.

But Michelin star restaurants? I certainly will give it a go.

I always try to lace my work with just a teensy-weensy bit of humour. It's 
rather like putting a sprig of feathery stuff in a flower arrangement: I 
believe humour is a great balancer.

I am very attracted to funny people – I'd go so far as to say I find it hard 
to trust unfunny people. When I think about writers with humour, I immediately 
think of Brendan Behan.

"Perhaps there is some depth missing from the current [feminist] conversation"

MarkStormRon <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14965746> asks:

Where do you stand in relation to the feminist movement in its modern 
incarnation, and what if anything would you change about it?

June 2015 2:40pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/53104672> 
I come from a generation of women who were slightly perturbed by the feminist 
movement as it stood in the 1980s, with its residual humourless-ness and lack 
of subtlety concerning female possibilities. In short, feminism seemed fine on 
the one hand, but it also seemed to take the fun (the fantasy) out of being a 
girl.

So when, in the late 1980s, I came across the word of Cindy Sherman, I felt 
relief. Here was an artist who reclaimed all the role-playing and ambiguity 
associated with femininity, and created beautiful art with it. She controlled 
every aspect of her images, so therefore was unquestionably a feminist.

And yet … now it's very difficult to gauge the true meaning of feminism. For 
sure we're seeing a lot of it about – it's so hot right now! – but perhaps 
there is some depth missing from the current conversation.

On motherhood: "'Double life' is how I feel at the moment"

Mark Fergusson <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12811098> asks:

songs do they like the best? Keep on!

Interesting you use the phrase "double life" as that is how I feel at the 
moment. Over the summer, artists go out at the weekends to festivals and during 
the week we are at home. So yes, it feels very much like a double life right 
now.

My kids saw me perform for the first time a few weeks ago, when I sang at a 
rave for young children – a kiddie rave. But they have never seen my full show. 
Perhaps they'll come to one of the more sedate, middle-class festivals (of 
which there are now many).

My daughter and son are fascinated by the costumes, and hats and masks and 
many fabulous items that are coming into my house at an almost alarming rate. 
How this will all affect them in the long run, nobody knows.

I'm not sure I mostly write about things. I suppose I'm drawn to the senses – 
I very much will use any method at my disposal in order to write. Sometimes I 
collect ideas in journals, things people say, things that come to me in my 
sleep, etc. Sometimes I record ideas into my phone.

I also make lots of scrapbooks with cuttings from newspapers and magazines. 
Sometimes I can be inspired by a whole article, other times just one word or a 
phrase. I've written songs about films I've just watched, I've written about 
how I feel personally and I've written about imagined stories and imagined 
characters.

In fact, the more ways to write a song, the better – as far as I'm concerned. 
I don't want to look at that blank page for too long.

But, it's always revealing, no matter how I approach any kind of creativity. I 
reveal something of myself in the end. In fact, it reveals something of myselfto
 myself in the end.

"If someone expects me to conform to anything, then they're not really my fan

Do you feel a sense of entitlement in music fans, in terms of them demanding 
that the artist produce exactly what they want and expect?

… Well. I do tell my fans to expect the unexpected from me at every 
opportunity, and many of them are very understanding of this tendency of mine. 
You do get the occasional "why doesn't she make straight dance-pop music?" but 
I do that as well!

I think I'm lucky with my fanbase. I can't believe so many of them have waited 
for so long for an album from me. If someone expects me to conform to anything, 
then they're not really my fan at all.

Out of all the songs you’ve written, which are you the most proud of?

I write different kinds of songs: sometimes I set my goal at making people 
dance. For songs like Jealousy and Simulation I come from a purist point of 
view, and it requires immense discipline for me to write like that, as I can 
have a tendency to over-intellectualise.

But when I do achieve this purity, it makes me very proud. On the other hand, 
I'm very proud of the songs on Hairless Toys as I had to follow some pretty 
complex song structures and write in a way that was very poetic. And so, for 
different reasons, I'm proud of that side of what I do, too.

It's well-known that I didn't put a certain song on my last record 
Overpowered. It was a decent song called Off & On, written with Cathy Dennis 
and Calvin Harris.

On paper, this should have been pure pop gold but in the end, it didn't quite 
come up to standard.

Post your questions for Roisin Murphy

Róisín Murphy made her entrance on to the pop stage in 1999, fronting the 
group Moloko, breaking into the charts with a sunkissed house remix of their 
track Sing It Back.

She later went solo, co-producing her 2005 debut album Ruby Blue with 
experimental musicianMatthew Herbert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/may/28/herbert-the-shakes-exclusive-album-stream>
, and following it with the dark electropop of 2007’s Overpowered.

She eased out of the spotlight after becoming a mother, but 2015 sees her back 
in a flurry of activity: earlier this year she released Mi Senti, an EP of 
covers of classic Italian pop songs, and earlier this month she released the 
albumHairless Toys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/07/roisin-murphy-hairless-toys-review>
, inspired by the 80s ball scene in New York. Murphy reanimates its world of 
outcast beauty with lounge ballads and strutting disco.

She’s joining us to answer your questions in a live webchat from 2pm on Monday 
1 June – post yours in the comments below, and she’ll answer as many as 
possible.

What influenced your decision to pick Italian pop songs in general, and the 
specific songs on the album? Did you speak any Italian prior to recording them?

Also there’s a Scottish beer named after you:

I fell in love with an Italian record producer. He surrounded me with Italian 
music. I've always loved Mina, and the more I researched her, the more in love 
with her I became. The song Non Credre was the first one I tackled, and it was 
as much her performance of the song, as seen on YouTube, as the song itself 
that led me to take up this challenge.

These feminine icons, both Mina and Patty Pravo, seem to be hugely modern in 
their performances, which are full of wit. I cannot overstate their influence 
on me at this point in my career.

And I used to drink Guinness, because I was told it was good for you. I 
recently found out the opposite is true. Silly me.

I do love to play in the visual side of all this. I thought I would be a 
visual artist when I was growing up, so I'm always up for a bit of 
experimentation.

On Hairless Toys, I've tried to create an ambiguous character to go with an 
ambiguous record. She's anything but rock'n'roll – she's so not rock'n'roll 
that, in a twisted way, she's kind of radical. She's like someone from my 
memory, almost like my mother, and she's lost in some space-time between the 
1960s and the late 80s.

She, like me, has been away in her own world for quite some time and as she 
enters the fray, she's seen as an oddball outsider. In no way is she trying to 
be a teenager or "youth": my work is no longer about youth culture in any way, 
as I am a realist.

Angie is quite a lady.

Often, I try to make videos that are not like videos: anything other than look 
like a pop video! So, the videos become more cinematic, less 
all-singing-and-dancing, and more psychological and dramatic. This, for some 
reason, has led me to the toilet. Perhaps it's short-form for intimacy.

I can't tell you what's going to happen to those songs: maybe one day they 
will reach the light of day, but for now I have 25 other songs I need to worry 
about as I wrote a mountain of tracks with Eddie Stevens last year and only 
eight made it to Hairless Toys.

For sure, there's another album there and maybe an EP.

I'll tell you what, it's hard to get a good fish and chips these days, and the 
cod is nearly gone! So, it's quite a delicacy nowadays. I was brought up around 
a fish and chips shop – or a chipper, we call it in Ireland – and my nana ran 
it.

But Michelin star restaurants? I certainly will give it a go.

I always try to lace my work with just a teensy-weensy bit of humour. It's 
rather like putting a sprig of feathery stuff in a flower arrangement: I 
believe humour is a great balancer.

I am very attracted to funny people – I'd go so far as to say I find it hard 
to trust unfunny people. When I think about writers with humour, I immediately 
think of Brendan Behan.

Where do you stand in relation to the feminist movement in its modern 
incarnation, and what if anything would you change about it?

June 2015 2:40pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/53104672> 
I come from a generation of women who were slightly perturbed by the feminist 
movement as it stood in the 1980s, with its residual humourless-ness and lack 
of subtlety concerning female possibilities. In short, feminism seemed fine on 
the one hand, but it also seemed to take the fun (the fantasy) out of being a 
girl.

So when, in the late 1980s, I came across the word of Cindy Sherman, I felt 
relief. Here was an artist who reclaimed all the role-playing and ambiguity 
associated with femininity, and created beautiful art with it. She controlled 
every aspect of her images, so therefore was unquestionably a feminist.

And yet … now it's very difficult to gauge the true meaning of feminism. For 
sure we're seeing a lot of it about – it's so hot right now! – but perhaps 
there is some depth missing from the current conversation.

Interesting you use the phrase "double life" as that is how I feel at the 
moment. Over the summer, artists go out at the weekends to festivals and during 
the week we are at home. So yes, it feels very much like a double life right 
now.

My kids saw me perform for the first time a few weeks ago, when I sang at a 
rave for young children – a kiddie rave. But they have never seen my full show. 
Perhaps they'll come to one of the more sedate, middle-class festivals (of 
which there are now many).

My daughter and son are fascinated by the costumes, and hats and masks and 
many fabulous items that are coming into my house at an almost alarming rate. 
How this will all affect them in the long run, nobody knows.

I'm not sure I mostly write about things. I suppose I'm drawn to the senses – 
I very much will use any method at my disposal in order to write. Sometimes I 
collect ideas in journals, things people say, things that come to me in my 
sleep, etc. Sometimes I record ideas into my phone.

I also make lots of scrapbooks with cuttings from newspapers and magazines. 
Sometimes I can be inspired by a whole article, other times just one word or a 
phrase. I've written songs about films I've just watched, I've written about 
how I feel personally and I've written about imagined stories and imagined 
characters.

In fact, the more ways to write a song, the better – as far as I'm concerned. 
I don't want to look at that blank page for too long.

But, it's always revealing, no matter how I approach any kind of creativity. I 
reveal something of myself in the end. In fact, it reveals something of myselfto
 myself in the end.

… Well. I do tell my fans to expect the unexpected from me at every 
opportunity, and many of them are very understanding of this tendency of mine. 
You do get the occasional "why doesn't she make straight dance-pop music?" but 
I do that as well!

I think I'm lucky with my fanbase. I can't believe so many of them have waited 
for so long for an album from me. If someone expects me to conform to anything, 
then they're not really my fan at all.

I write different kinds of songs: sometimes I set my goal at making people 
dance. For songs like Jealousy and Simulation I come from a purist point of 
view, and it requires immense discipline for me to write like that, as I can 
have a tendency to over-intellectualise.

But when I do achieve this purity, it makes me very proud. On the other hand, 
I'm very proud of the songs on Hairless Toys as I had to follow some pretty 
complex song structures and write in a way that was very poetic. And so, for 
different reasons, I'm proud of that side of what I do, too.

It's well-known that I didn't put a certain song on my last record 
Overpowered. It was a decent song called Off & On, written with Cathy Dennis 
and Calvin Harris.

On paper, this should have been pure pop gold but in the end, it didn't quite 
come up to standard.

Hi, I'm here at the Guardian, and I will endeavour to answer your questions 
truthfully.

So let’s get cracking.
 
Róisín Murphy made her entrance on to the pop stage in 1999, fronting the 
group Moloko, breaking into the charts with a sunkissed house remix of their 
track Sing It Back.

She later went solo, co-producing her 2005 debut album Ruby Blue with 
experimental musicianMatthew Herbert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/may/28/herbert-the-shakes-exclusive-album-stream>
, and following it with the dark electropop of 2007’s Overpowered.

She eased out of the spotlight after becoming a mother, but 2015 sees her back 
in a flurry of activity: earlier this year she released Mi Senti, an EP of 
covers of classic Italian pop songs, and earlier this month she released the 
albumHairless Toys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/07/roisin-murphy-hairless-toys-review>
, inspired by the 80s ball scene in New York. Murphy reanimates its world of 
outcast beauty with lounge ballads and strutting disco.

She’s joining us to answer your questions in a live webchat from 2pm on Monday 
1 June – post yours in the comments below, and she’ll answer as many as 
possible.
