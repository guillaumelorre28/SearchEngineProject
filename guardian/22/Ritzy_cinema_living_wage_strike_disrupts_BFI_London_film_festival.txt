Cinema workers have brought extra drama to the London film festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/londonfilmfestival> with protests on the red 
carpet and the closure of one venue in a battle for better pay.

The Ritzy in Brixton, south London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>, 
which was due to host two festival screenings on Friday, was closed as workers 
went on strike. Protests were also planned outside the premieres of La La Land, 
a new musical featuring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, at the Odeon in Leicester 
Square, and The Levelling, a film about the Somerset floods, at Picturehouse 
Central in Piccadilly.

“There is a real problem with low pay in the film industry and we are going to 
take that to events where film directors and industry people are so they know 
those working to show their films are on poverty wages,” said Kelly Rogers, a 
bartender at the Ritzy and a representative for Bectu, which organised the 
strike.

The union called on the British Film Institute (BFI), organisers of the London 
film festival, to sever links with the Ritzy’s owner, Cineworld, until it meets 
their demands.

Workers at the Hackney Picturehouse in east London, which is also a festival 
venue, have voted to join the strike protest next weekend while staff at 
Picturehouse’s Central cinema, on Shaftesbury Avenue, and other venues in 
Clapham, south London, and Crouch End, north London, have also started to get 
involved with Bectu.

Workers at the Ritzy say Picturehouse reneged on a promise to work towards 
payment of the independently calculated London living wage of £9.40 an hour.


Rogers said cinema staff, most of whom are on zero-hours contracts, were paid 
£9.10 an hour which was not enough to live on in the capital. At the Ritzy, 
workers get regular shifts although these are not guaranteed by their contracts.

Staff who have worked less than a year do not get company sick pay. Longer 
term employees only get sick pay if they have been off work for eight days. 
Rogers said workers wanted sick pay for all workers from the first day they 
were off ill.

Rogers said: “We have chosen to demand the London living wage because that’s 
what we need to live in London. £9.10 isn’t enough and many struggle to make 
their rent. If you are off work for a few days with flu then you can’t make 
your rent that month and you have to borrow from family and friends.”

Ritzy workers went on strike two years ago in a bid to secure the London 
living wage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/30/brixton-ritzy-climbs-down-over-redundancies>
 but instead won a stepped 26% pay rise, which was less than they demanded.

Protests were called off in 2014 after the company agreed to study its 
business model and work towards paying the living wage, but Rogers said 
Picturehouse had not fulfilled its promise and had refused to discuss pay rises 
at a meeting earlier this year.

The appeal of the boutique chains has been tarnished by rows over the use of 
zero-hours contracts and low pay. Film fans have criticised poor pay and 
conditions when they are paying £13 or more to watch a film.

After protests, the Curzon chain agreed to pay the living wage two years ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/29/curzon-cinema-chain-london-living-wage>
. The Everyman chainrecently pledged to move hundreds of staff off zero-hours 
contracts by the end of next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/everyman-cinema-chain-is-next-to-drop-zero-hours-contracts>
, although it does not pay the living wage.

The strike has enjoyed high-profile support, including from the Brixton-based 
writer Will Self, who in 2014 said he would boycott Picturehouse Cinemas over 
the dispute. Last month, at the UK premiere of his new film, I, Daniel Blake, 
in Liverpool, director Ken Loach called the strikers heroic.

“Picturehouse is owned by Cineworld which is a big multinational corporation,” 
he said. “They make fortunes. The idea that they pay starvation wages because 
they can get people who are desperate for work is absolutely shocking. Victory 
to the Ritzy strikers.”

A spokesperson for Picturehouse Cinemas said: “A three-year agreement with 
Bectu signed in July 2014 set staff pay rates at the Ritzy, not including 
benefits, at £9.10 from 2 September 2016 after three phased increases. We are 
therefore disappointed by the decision of a minority of staff at the Ritzy who 
voted for strike action on Friday 7 October.

“Our staff are hugely important to us, we pay fair wages and have a wide range 
of benefits within a good working environment. Increases in pay for front of 
house people in Picturehouse Cinemas have far outstripped inflation over the 
last three years.”
