Why go?
Wizz Air <https://wizzair.com/en-GB/FlightSearch> recently launched the first 
direct flights between the UK and Ohrid, opening up this beautiful corner of 
the Balkans to British travellers. Macedonia’s second city offers an appealing 
mix of Ottoman architecture and Byzantine churches, but the real draw is its 
sublime lakeside setting. Tranquil Lake Ohrid is ringed by mountains, 
attractive villages and beaches which come alive in summer with local people 
sunbathing and swimming in the crystal-clear waters. A balmy, Mediterranean 
climate and some of the lowest prices in Europe make this a viable alternative 
to the Italian lakes.

What to do
Take a water taxi across the lake to visit the Monastery of St Naum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jan/30/macedonia-kapka-kassabova-lake-ohrid>
, situated on a rocky headland with spectacular views. On the way you can stop 
off at theBay of Bones Museum 
<http://www.balkansgeotourism.travel/content/museum-on-water-bay-of-the-bones-ohrid-macedonia/see35AD9CB707C8912C4>
, a recreation of a neolithic settlement built on stilts over the water. The 
number of churches in Ohrid has earned it the nickname “the Macedonian 
Jerusalem”: the 13th-century church ofSveti Jovan 
<http://www.exploringmacedonia.com/church-st-jovan-kaneo.nspx> on the cliffs at 
Kaneo is a popular spot for watching the sun set. On sunny days join the 
sunbathers at the Kadmo, Cuba Libre or Bella Vista beach clubs, where you can 
hire sun loungers or enjoy a waterside cocktail.

Where to stay
The Hotel Villa Sveta Sofija has a great location in Ohrid’s old town and just 
five guest rooms in an Ottoman-era mansion decorated with handmade rugs, wooden 
carvings and Murano-glass chandeliers (doubles from £50,vilasofija.com.mk 
<http://www.vilasofija.com.mk/>).

Where to eat
Balkan specialities such as sarma (stuffed cabbage leaves) and fresh lake 
trout are on the menu at the great-value waterside restaurant, Dalga (Kosta 
Abrash 3, +389 46 255 999).

Insider tip
Ellie Marr of Regent Holidays (regent-holidays.co.uk 
<http://www.regent-holidays.co.uk/>), which can tailor-make holidays to 
Macedonia, recommends an excursion to theGalicica National Park 
<http://www.galicica.org.mk/>: “There are lots of hiking trails through the 
hills and some pretty villages you can stop off at.”

 Les Piaules hostel, in Paris’s hip Bellville neighbourhood. 
Away: Paris in the autumn Paris has no shortage of hostels, but most of them 
could be anywhere. Three young Parisian entrepreneurs hope to change that at 
Les Piaules, a new hostel in an Art Deco building in the hip Belleville 
neighbourhood. It will showcase French food and drink and offer views of the 
Eiffel Tower from some of the bedrooms. The hostel opens in September with bunk 
beds from €30 a night (lespiaules.com <http://www.lespiaules.com/>).
