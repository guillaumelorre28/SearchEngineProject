The re-release of Blue Velvet <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hImPHv7sh14> 
this week serves as a reminder of how stylish it was – perhaps a strange notion 
for a film in which Dennis Hopper wearing a gas mask is it’s most enduring, 
see-it-when-you-close-your-eyes image. But, as with all the best David Lynch 
productions, it’s the tension between a best-face-forward American glamour and 
a dark, stay-with-you horror that makes it so compelling, even 30 years after 
it was first screened. The opening shot of a white picket fence, blue sky and 
bed of roses is followed by the camera burying under the flowerbed to find an 
ear crawling with ants: the two sides of American suburbia for all to see.

Isabella Rossellini’s blue velvet floorlength gown, red lipstick and big hair 
is the most iconic look of the film, of course, worthy of a costume party, or
Lana Del Rey video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwCitgDib-g>. At home in 
her claustrophobic flat, she’s a fantasy femme fatale, whether in bed with Kyle 
MacLachlan’s super-square Jeffrey Beaumont or abused by Dennis Hopper’s 
terrifying Frank. Transformed to a nightclub singer, in sequinned strappyslip 
dress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/07/the-big-reveal-deconstructing-the-slip-dress>
, she’s another image of seduction. This dangerous, 40s-style glamour contrasts 
starkly with the strictly-daytime-hours, 50s wholesomeness of Beaumont.

Blue Velvet introduced two frequent Lynch collaborators – MacLachlan and Laura 
Dern, who plays Sandy, the daughter of the detective out to discover who the 
ear belongs to. Both exist in a kind of Norman Rockwell painting – one of 
diners, old-fashioned fire trucks and aforementioned picket fences. They have 
the look to match – pretty floral dresses and ponytails for Dern, and khakis 
and freshly parted hair for MacLachlan. Expect more of the same in the new 
series ofTwin Peaks  
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jul/28/-sp-twin-peaks-coolest-characters-david-lynch>
planned for next year.

Clothes spell out the dark and light in Blue Velvet – and how one can’t exist 
without the other. Lynch’s costume designer, Patricia Norris, who died last 
year, was responsible for this contrast, and they worked closely together. “On 
Blue Velvet, we collaborated on the sets and things like that,” said Lynch. 
“We’d talk about colour, where things were going and what was happening, the 
feeling and the mood.” It all combines to make Blue Velvet’s look – beguiling, 
horrible, beautiful and haunting – feel completely unique, even now. As 
Beaumont says, it’s a strange world, with strange style. Time to get lost in it 
all over again.
