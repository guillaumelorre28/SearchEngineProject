When Virginia Woolf <https://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf> wrote 
the fantastical biographical novel Orlando, she broke all the rules of time and 
gender. The protagonist lives for four centuries but ages just 36 years; 
halfway through, with no explanation, he switches from being a man to a woman.

Orlando was Christopher Bailey’s starting point for Burberry’s show, a link 
more fundamental than the way in which this season’s Cavalry women’s jacket 
recalls the handsome boy-prince costumes worn by Tilda Swinton in the 1992 film.

The show was staged in the husk of Foyles bookshop, with a copy of Orlando on 
every seat. At the champagne reception before the show, Cara Delevingne was 
being snapchatted metres away from a workbench at which craftswomen 
demonstrated the traditional passementerie arts of tassel making: the present 
and past of fashion, cheek by jowl.

“What I love about Orlando is that nothing is specific to one time or one 
gender,” said designer Christopher Bailey after the show. “It is a book about 
emotion and beauty, which is what I feel fashion is about.”
The downside of a high-concept fashion week event is that the clothes 
themselves inevitably feel like walk ons, rather than the main event. There was 
a fashion message, in the blurring of male and female style: the trenchcoat, 
after all, is genderless, a point that was underscored by a collection that 
went big on velvet blazers, wide trousers, piped silk pyjama shirts, and other 
gender-fluid pieces. Long sheer lace skirts were worn over silk, Bermuda-length 
bloomers.

A catwalk show with the purpose of selling trenchcoats can never exist on the 
same cultural plane as a a masterpiece of experimental fiction. But in the very 
different world of global luxury retail,Burberry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/burberrygroup> is attempting something 
like a commercial version of Woolf’s genteel iconoclasm.

The September show, as this was called, broke with the arcane structures of 
fashion week. Instead of showing clothes six months before they go on sale and 
segregating womenswear from menswear in different fashion weeks, these clothes 
for both men and women were on sale immediately. Jettisoning the pedantic 
labels of AW16 and SS17 – the internal filing system of fashion are no more 
compelling to the outside world than any other industry’s office admin – these 
clothes were “seasonless”. A sharply tailored jacket and a silk shirt are 
covetable at any time of year, after all.

Orlando is most closely associated with gender fluidity, and the new coed 
concept is the most eye catching element of the changes currently happening at 
fashion week. But the dissolution of the traditional fashion timetable is just 
as revolutionary.

According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, stream of consciousness is a 
narrative technique in which “to represent the full richness, speed, and 
subtlety of the mind at work, the writer incorporates snatches of incoherent 
thought, ungrammatical constructions, and free associations of ideas, images 
and words”. This technique, which Woolf used in Orlando, also serves as a fair 
description of the way in which ideas and trends are disseminated from fashion 
shows in the age of social media.

This collection was on sale online at the same time it was on the catwalk; 
some key names, including British Fashion Council chairman Natalie Massenet and 
pop star Taylor Swift, had been photographed wearing the clothes some days 
before the show took place. The tight reins of long-lead fashion are on the way 
out, and a new era of stream-of-consciousness fashion is beginning.

Elsewhere, Christopher Kane’s tenth anniversary show celebrated iconoclasm of 
a different kind, reminding the audience how he can take the most unpromising 
looks – here, plastic Crocs and pencil skirts in “road kill fur” – and turn 
them into want-it-now fashion. “For my very first collection, I made pieces out 
of stockings that I bought on Ridley Road market”, he said after the show.

“I have always been able to make anything out of nothing. Those dresses are 
like holy relics to us now. We get them out and look at them every season.”

Roksanda stands in serene contrast to Kane’s gleeful bad taste. Her label 
combines a boldness with colour – Elastoplast pink with brick red, in this 
instance – with a cool eye and an unerring taste level. It is this instinct for 
the true north of chic which has evolved her label from a niche brand for art 
collectors and wealthy gallerists into a go-to name for A-list soft-power 
dressers including Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama.

The penultimate day of London fashion week took a darker turn at Erdem, and a 
collection conceived when the designer read about the story ofJean Kerr, 
lady-in-waiting to the consort of Charles I 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/21/400-year-old-dress-found-in-shipwreck-sheds-light-on-plot-to-pawn-crown-jewels>
 and sometime spy for the King of Spain, whose wardrobe was lost at sea during 
a daring mission to pawn the crown jewels to raise money for the royalists on 
the eve of the English civil war.

This elaborate backstory gave Erdem a character for the season (a society 
woman whose elegant dress conceals a daredevil character) and a stage set (a 
very picturesque, sympathetically lit shipwreck). The resulting dresses had a 
kind of broken-hearted-romantic-heroine chic.

This is London fashion week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-fashion-week>, home of original 
fashion thinking – so why go to the party looking like everyone else?
