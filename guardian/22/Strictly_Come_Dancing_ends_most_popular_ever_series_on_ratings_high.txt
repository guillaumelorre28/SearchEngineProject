The 2015 Strictly final was watched by an average of 11 million viewers and a 
peak of 11.9 million, although it was split into two episodes airing in one 
night: the final and the separate results show.


The growth of Strictly’s overnight figures for the final could be due in part 
to its main rival The X Factor’s absence from the schedule as the ITV programme 
ended last weekend.


Oduba, a BBC sports presenter, was crowned champion of the dance show after 
fending off competition from the actor Danny Mac and former singer Louise 
Redknapp.


The final episode also saw Len Goodman bow out of the show after serving as 
head judge since it began over a decade ago.


Strictly’s success in the ratings caps a memorable year for the BBC, which has 
seenbumper audiences for shows including The Great British Bake Off
