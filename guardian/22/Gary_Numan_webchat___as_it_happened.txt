Thank you. And thank you to everyone who took the time to ask questions. It's 
very much appreciated. I'm really enjoying being back in England, and very much 
looking forward to seeing everyone on Friday at the Royal Festival Hall. Bye.

Omnisphere by a company called Spectrasonics is my favourite. Omnisphere 2 is 
being released next month and is stunning.

As Convergence is a Festival of Electronica will you be going back to basics 
for Friday’s gig?

Electronica is not nostalgia. I wouldn't do it if it was nostalgia. The set 
will be a mix of songs from my entire catalogue, and there will be things from 
the late 70s right up to things from Splinter. I'm allowed 90 minutes, and I 
hope to fill it with songs from most areas of my career.

I remember when you crashed your plane in the village where I lived at the

your music or just your laundry bill?

Just to point out, I didn't crash it. It was being flown by a commercial 
pilot. But I did own it. It made no difference whatsoever to my outlook on 
life, or my laundry bill. I was flying again two days later. I consider it to 
be a very exciting and interesting experience having survived it, much like 
being a popstar.

I'm not an American citizen. I'm still British with a British passport. I am 
what they call a permanent resident. Or a legal alien. Which I really like. 
There is an option to become a citizen after you've been living in America for 
a few years, which does give you certain advantages, but I doubt I would do 
that. Although I'm sure my children will.

I saw a fantastic T-shirt that said: I was born with nothing, and I still have 
most of it left. That pretty much sums up life for me.

I still do work with musicians in the studio, but I never worked with a full 
band. Everything was recorded sequentially, one person at a time. But I love 
technology. My entire career has been based upon using cutting edge technology 
and always will be. I came into music more through a love of technology than a 
love of music, in many ways. And I've never lost that.

"I secretly enjoyed the fact that when I did Tops of the Pops, nobody knew I

Elvis Chomsky <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14537164> asks: 

Why the quotation marks in ‘Are Friends “Electric”?’ Was it and Down In The 
Park about gay sex?
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14642597> Guardian contributor
GaryNuman1  <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14642597> 18 March

First of all, Down in the Park is not about gay sex, of which I have no 
experience whatsoever.

The quotation marks are actually around the wrong word. And the "Friends" in 
the song are robots. They are robots with a clone human skin, and can supply a 
wide variety of services from plumbing to prostitution. They were from a 
science fiction story I was writing, and they were called Friends as a slang 
term because you didn't know what they were for when they arrived at your door, 
or your neighbour's door. Your neighbours had no idea what service they were 
supplying. It was the equivalent of getting porn in a brown envelope.

I always secretly enjoyed the fact that when I did it on Top of the Pops, 
nobody knew I was singing about a robot prostitute. Which would surely have got 
the song banned.

English biscuits, hopefully. I've never actually requested anything! Except

You’ve got a big and vocal following on social media - Twitter, Facebook &

posts and comments and do you ever want to respond?

Very rarely. When Splinter was released, I started to interact for the first 
time ever on Twitter, and within a week, negative things started to come. Fans 
started to get angry, supporting me, and it just became unpleasant. So I pulled 
out straight away, and won't go back. The problem with the internet and social 
media is that it's given everyone a voice, but it seems that some people don't 
know what to do with it. They use it as an outlet for every negative thought 
they have. And I find it utterly depressing.

I recently went onto a forum, for example, to find out about an electric car 
for one of my children. There was a YouTube video. Within four comments it had 
degenerated into a foulmouthed slanging match from parents arguing about the 
best and worst electric car for children, it was unbelievably pathetic. That 
seems to be quite typical.

I was five in 1980 and your music has been with me my whole life, I don’t 
think there has been a day that I’ve not listened to you, but I can honestly 
say that Splinter is by far the best album you have ever done, it’s just 
stunning. How does it feel that this far into your career, you are producing 
your best work?

Initially the reaction to the album just made me feel a huge sense of relief. 
It had taken me a long time to make, I was incredibly nervous about how people 
would react to it. But their reaction was so positive, so incredible actually, 
that I actually looked at the album myself again. When it was first released I 
was listening to it with the ears of a nervous, almost frightened man, and it 
wasn't until the reaction started to come in that I was able to listen to it in 
a more confident way. It's not been 18 months I think since it came out, and I 
now consider it one of the best albums I've ever made. And to have made it so 
deep into the career at a time when most artists that have been around this 
long have blanded out, I feel very proud of it.

The pressure now is to do it again. Which is what most of 2015 will be devoted 
to. I have no plans for it whatsoever - I'm going to go to the studio when I 
get back from this gig, and just see what happens. I have no pre-arranged 
intention or direction for it. There'll be a new producer if I use one at all. 
It's an absolutely blank page at the moment. It may not even be industrial.

"I don't really listen to music at all...I never have it on in the house or

PeterFox79 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11179247> asks:

Do you listen to music for pleasure? If so, what acts are you currently 
listening to?
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14642597> Guardian contributor
GaryNuman1  <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14642597> 18 March

I don't really listen to music at all. I listen to music when I'm working on 
it, writing it, touring it. I do go to gigs as often as possible but never 
listen to the radio, I never have music on in the house or car, in fact I 
bought all my children iPods so that when they listen to music in the car I 
don't have to hear it. So my exposure to new music comes mainly from gigs, and 
going to see bands.

The only new bands I've seen recently that I really liked have been bands that 
I've toured with: Roman Remains, Big Black Delta. In the UK we toured with a 
band called Officers who were great, The Losers on the last tour were great. 
But that's it! Slightly embarrassed about that. But my kind of exposure is 
limited.

We've already had many discussions about God thanks to the various things 
discussed and taught at school. If they ask me what I think I tell them 
honestly: that I don't believe, and I consider the whole thing ridiculous. But 
if they choose to and it makes them happy, then I'm ok with it.

Absolutely not. It seems to me that everyone's experience is unique and is 
unlikely to be relevant to every other person on the spectrum. I have had the 
opportunity to be able to channel my Asperger's into something creative and 
something that has been the most important aspect of my entire life. Those 
experiences may not be relevant in any way to other people with Asperger's. I 
would feel very uncomfortable setting myself up as any kind of role model or 
spokesperson on the autism spectrum, especially when I'm not even officially 
diagnosed.

What are the reasons please, that in recent times you have dumped your two 
synth players and replaced them with the MacBook? Your gigs lack a huge dynamic 
now. Shame as not long ago, your gigs were an ‘experience’, not just a gig.

First of all, I've gone from two synth players to one. To make up for that I 
now play keyboards myself on stage for many songs, which I thought fans would 
enjoy. And as for the MacBook, that simply replaced the DAT player I used for 
20 years before it because the MacBook was more reliable. I would be surprised 
if anyone left Hammersmith in November thinking the show lacked dynamics. But 
each to their own.

Thank you. And thank you to everyone who took the time to ask questions. It's 
very much appreciated. I'm really enjoying being back in England, and very much 
looking forward to seeing everyone on Friday at the Royal Festival Hall. Bye.

Electronica is not nostalgia. I wouldn't do it if it was nostalgia. The set 
will be a mix of songs from my entire catalogue, and there will be things from 
the late 70s right up to things from Splinter. I'm allowed 90 minutes, and I 
hope to fill it with songs from most areas of my career.

Just to point out, I didn't crash it. It was being flown by a commercial 
pilot. But I did own it. It made no difference whatsoever to my outlook on 
life, or my laundry bill. I was flying again two days later. I consider it to 
be a very exciting and interesting experience having survived it, much like 
being a popstar.

I'm not an American citizen. I'm still British with a British passport. I am 
what they call a permanent resident. Or a legal alien. Which I really like. 
There is an option to become a citizen after you've been living in America for 
a few years, which does give you certain advantages, but I doubt I would do 
that. Although I'm sure my children will.

I still do work with musicians in the studio, but I never worked with a full 
band. Everything was recorded sequentially, one person at a time. But I love 
technology. My entire career has been based upon using cutting edge technology 
and always will be. I came into music more through a love of technology than a 
love of music, in many ways. And I've never lost that.

First of all, Down in the Park is not about gay sex, of which I have no 
experience whatsoever.

The quotation marks are actually around the wrong word. And the "Friends" in 
the song are robots. They are robots with a clone human skin, and can supply a 
wide variety of services from plumbing to prostitution. They were from a 
science fiction story I was writing, and they were called Friends as a slang 
term because you didn't know what they were for when they arrived at your door, 
or your neighbour's door. Your neighbours had no idea what service they were 
supplying. It was the equivalent of getting porn in a brown envelope.

I always secretly enjoyed the fact that when I did it on Top of the Pops, 
nobody knew I was singing about a robot prostitute. Which would surely have got 
the song banned.

Very rarely. When Splinter was released, I started to interact for the first 
time ever on Twitter, and within a week, negative things started to come. Fans 
started to get angry, supporting me, and it just became unpleasant. So I pulled 
out straight away, and won't go back. The problem with the internet and social 
media is that it's given everyone a voice, but it seems that some people don't 
know what to do with it. They use it as an outlet for every negative thought 
they have. And I find it utterly depressing.

I recently went onto a forum, for example, to find out about an electric car 
for one of my children. There was a YouTube video. Within four comments it had 
degenerated into a foulmouthed slanging match from parents arguing about the 
best and worst electric car for children, it was unbelievably pathetic. That 
seems to be quite typical.

Initially the reaction to the album just made me feel a huge sense of relief. 
It had taken me a long time to make, I was incredibly nervous about how people 
would react to it. But their reaction was so positive, so incredible actually, 
that I actually looked at the album myself again. When it was first released I 
was listening to it with the ears of a nervous, almost frightened man, and it 
wasn't until the reaction started to come in that I was able to listen to it in 
a more confident way. It's not been 18 months I think since it came out, and I 
now consider it one of the best albums I've ever made. And to have made it so 
deep into the career at a time when most artists that have been around this 
long have blanded out, I feel very proud of it.

The pressure now is to do it again. Which is what most of 2015 will be devoted 
to. I have no plans for it whatsoever - I'm going to go to the studio when I 
get back from this gig, and just see what happens. I have no pre-arranged 
intention or direction for it. There'll be a new producer if I use one at all. 
It's an absolutely blank page at the moment. It may not even be industrial.

I don't really listen to music at all. I listen to music when I'm working on 
it, writing it, touring it. I do go to gigs as often as possible but never 
listen to the radio, I never have music on in the house or car, in fact I 
bought all my children iPods so that when they listen to music in the car I 
don't have to hear it. So my exposure to new music comes mainly from gigs, and 
going to see bands.

The only new bands I've seen recently that I really liked have been bands that 
I've toured with: Roman Remains, Big Black Delta. In the UK we toured with a 
band called Officers who were great, The Losers on the last tour were great. 
But that's it! Slightly embarrassed about that. But my kind of exposure is 
limited.

Absolutely not. It seems to me that everyone's experience is unique and is 
unlikely to be relevant to every other person on the spectrum. I have had the 
opportunity to be able to channel my Asperger's into something creative and 
something that has been the most important aspect of my entire life. Those 
experiences may not be relevant in any way to other people with Asperger's. I 
would feel very uncomfortable setting myself up as any kind of role model or 
spokesperson on the autism spectrum, especially when I'm not even officially 
diagnosed.

First of all, I've gone from two synth players to one. To make up for that I 
now play keyboards myself on stage for many songs, which I thought fans would 
enjoy. And as for the MacBook, that simply replaced the DAT player I used for 
20 years before it because the MacBook was more reliable. I would be surprised 
if anyone left Hammersmith in November thinking the show lacked dynamics. But 
each to their own.
