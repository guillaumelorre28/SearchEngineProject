Michelle Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michelle-williams> is in 
early talks to take on the role of rock icon Janis Joplin in a new biopic 
directed by Sean Durkin, the director of Martha Marcy May Marlene.

The film, titled Janis, is based the singer’s sister Laura Joplin’s book Love, 
Janis, which uses the singer’s letters to track her life from the coffee house 
roots of her career through to Woodstock, when she struggled with alcohol and 
drug addiction to cope with her sudden celebrity.

She died in 1970 aged 27 from a heroin overdose; a fourth album was released 
posthumously. Key hits included Piece of My Heart, Me and Bobby McGee, Get It 
While You Can, Move Over and Cry Baby.

Williams’s next role is in another musical film called The Greatest Showman

actress nomination for her role alongside Casey Affleck in Kenneth Lonergan’s
Manchester By the Sea
