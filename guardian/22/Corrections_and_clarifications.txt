• An article about the death of John Berger said the 1972 television series 
Ways of Seeing was based on Berger’s book of the same name. In fact the show 
came first; the book was based on Berger’s television scripts (John Berger, 
visionary art critic and Booker prize winner, dies aged 90 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-art-critic-and-author-dies-aged-90>
, 3 January, page 3).

• Several readers noticed that the tree in a picture accompanying an article (
Resistant British trees offer hope in ash dieback fight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/26/british-ash-trees-may-resist-dieback-disease-research-reveals>
, 27 December, page 13) did not look like an ash. The tree trunk in the 
photograph did belong to an ash, but the branches filling the foreground were 
from a different tree.

• A report (Backlash over plan to allow bison shooting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/polish-pm-urged-to-block-bison-hunting-plan>
, 3 January, page 18) said environmental authorities in Poland had allowed the 
hunting of a bison herd because it was threatened with TV. Tuberculosis that 
should have been.
