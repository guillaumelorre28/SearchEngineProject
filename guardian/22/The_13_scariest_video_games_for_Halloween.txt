If you’ve already had your Halloween party this weekend and were planning a 
quiet night in front of the TV, hiding from trick or treaters, we’ve got 
another idea for you.

All of the following horror titles are easily available for download on 
console orPC <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pc>, so by early this 
evening you could be scaring the bejesus out of yourself, looking for ghosts in 
an abandoned castle, or running into a poorly lit bathroom to escape a clown 
doll.

Yes gentle reader, here are 13 of our favourite (readily available) horror 
titles. You may want to leave the hall light on tonight.

 Monster-filled London … Zombi. Photograph: Ubisoft 
One of the least likely Wii U launch titles was the underrated rogue-like 
undead apocalypse adventure ZombiU – which Ubisoft later updated for PS4 and
Xbox One <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox-one>. Players have to 
make their way through a monster-filled London searching for weapons and food. 
Every time you die, you re-spawn in a different character and have to locate 
the body of your old self to reclaim your stuff. But of course, they won’t stay 
dead for long ...

 Eerie and ever-changing … Layers of Fear. Photograph: Bloober Team 
Bloober Team’s Layers of Fear 
<http://store.steampowered.com/app/391720/?snr=1_7_15__13> sees the player, a 
painter, returning to his studio in a sprawling Victorian mansion after some 
time away. Desperate to finish his masterpiece, he must approach the easel in 
every chapter to confront horrific personal tragedy, and the terrors that await 
him in his own home. It’s an eerie and ever-changing environment rife with 
unsettling art, coupled with a handful of jarring jump scares.

 Creepily characterful … Oxenfree. 
Inadvertently opening up an otherworldly rift to The Other Side that uses you 
and your friends as puppets for revenge just after graduation sure is a kicker. 
Night School Studio’sOxenfree <http://store.steampowered.com/app/388880/> 
follows Alex and her friends trying to solve layers of mysteries across an 
abandoned island in the Pacific Northwest. The terrors of teenage drama and 
personal grief go hand in hand with genuine jumps and an unsettling environment 
in this creepily characterful game.

4. Slender: The Eight Pages (PC/Mac)
 Cult classic … Slender: The Eight Pages. Photograph: Parsec Productions 
A cult classic from the 2012 heyday of the Slenderman craze, born out of an 
internet forum post and spiralling like a nightmarish killer clown meme into 
popular culture. This survival horror game is short and sweet, and sees you 
stalked through the woods by a featureless figure as you search for scraps of 
paper. The later PC and console follow-up, Slender: The Arrival, expanded on 
the theme admirably.

 You’ll never eat pizza again … Emily Wants to Play. 
You’re a pizza delivery guy who’s been lured into a creepy house and now 
there’s only one way out: to spend the night playing “games” with a ghostly 
girl named Emily and her distinctly unfriendly dolls. It’s a classic haunted 
house set-up with jump scares liberally littered about like demonic throw 
cushions.

 Terrifying … Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Photograph: Frictional Games 
Widely considered one of the most terrifying horror games of all time, Amnesia 
has the player gingerly exploring a monstrous gothic castle, searching for its 
lowest floors where an evil baron awaits. Darkness leads to insanity so you 
have to constantly seek out light sources, while also avoiding the creeping 
monsters. There are no weapons, so hiding and praying is your only hope. 
Developer FrictionalGames <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> 
followed this masterpiece with Soma (also worth a look tonight) which transfers 
the same sense of terror to an abandoned space station.

 Tormenting … Until Dawn. Photograph: Supermassive Games 
A group of hormonal teenagers find themselves in a remote cabin where they are 
tormented by a psychopathic killer – who must be one of them. Alternating 
between a cast of eight characters, the game offers hundreds of different 
scenarios based on significant choices, actions, and who you manage not to kill 
off. There are a few jump scares, a requisite Indian burial ground or two, and 
teens running off to have sex in ramshackle sheds. What’s scarier than that?

 The opposite of hygge … Anatomy. Photograph: Kitty Horrorshow 
“What happens to a house when it is left alone?” This question lurks behind 
one of the most unsettling and genuinely terrifying games on this list. Kitty 
Horrorshow’s Anatomy uses found cassette tapes across a suburban home and a 
masterful slow burn of tension (despite its short playtime) to achieve the kind 
of scares that make your own house feel like a malevolent presence. Looking for 
the opposite of hygge? You’ve found it.

 Creepy triumph … Resident Evil: Beginning Hour. 
Not actually a game, just a free downloadable demo for the next title in 
Capcom’s Resident Evil series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-games-capcom>
, Beginning Hour is, nevertheless, a creepy triumph. You play an unnamed man 
trapped in a dilapidated house, looking for ways out – what you find is a video 
cassette of a paranormal investigation programme filmed at the very same 
location. So where are the TV crew? And why do ghostly figures keep appearing 
everywhere? And did I just hear... HOLY CRAP WHAT WAS THAT?!

 King of the jump scare … Five Nights At Freddy’s. Photograph: Scott Cawthon 
A behemoth and a franchise in its own right at this point, Five Nights at 
Freddy’s <http://store.steampowered.com/app/319510/?snr=1_7_15__13> from Scott 
Cawthon is the king of the jump scare. The claustrophobic immobilisation of 
being chained to a security desk of CCTV screens coupled with the modern terror 
of dying batteries and animatronic childhood mascots is a feat to simply 
survive – let alone survive without screaming. Five Nights at Freddy’s is a 
short play – if you can handle it.

 Agonisingly tense … Outlast. 
It’s the old story: investigative journalist meets ruined psychiatric hospital 
overrun by homicidal patients. But developer Red Barrels handles the familiar 
set-up perfectly, crafting a taut almost agonisingly tense survival adventure 
out of its nightmarish wards and dank, rusted operating theatres. Once again, 
the emphasis is on evasion, which in this case means hiding under a bed until 
the bad man goes away. Good luck sleeping tonight.

 Monochromatic dystopia … Inside. Photograph: Playdead Games 
Playdead’s 2016 follow-up to their 2010 critical hit Limbo, is a sidescrolling 
puzzle platformer with a dreary relentlessness. Silent, except for a few 
atmospheric noises (dogs barking, a car starting, a gunshot), Inside follows a 
small boy through a monochromatic dystopia. The player must solve puzzles, 
which range from simple lever pulling to more grotesque displays of body horror 
– each made even more unsettling by its banality. Inside chills without kitsch, 
and does not apologise for it.

 Alan Wake Photograph: Remedy Entertainment 
Currently available for a knockdown price on Steam, Alan Wake follows a horror 
writer to the Pacific Northwest, America’s spookiest corner, to combat writer’s 
block. When his wife goes missing, he must both find her and finish his novel 
while being bombarded by nightmarish shadows, ghosts and ghouls. Taking a page 
out of Twin Peaks, The X-Files, and Stephen King, Alan Wake pays homage to 
classic kitsch horror, while also serving up its own blend of psychological 
terror.
