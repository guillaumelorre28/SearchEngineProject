Mark Lewis, who just missed out on the top job at John Lewis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis>, will become the new chief 
executive of the price comparison site Moneysupermarket.

Lewis, currently retail director at the department store group, will take over 
from Peter Plumb as CEO of Moneysupermarket, a FTSE 250 company, by 4 May next 
year.

, one of the UK’s most respected retail brands. She will take over from Andy 
Street in January, joining the handful of female executives in retail, an 
industry that employs mainly women.

Street told told staff in a memo: “Although this is very sad news for John 
Lewis, I am sure we will all want to congratulate Mark on this appointment. He 
let me know a little while ago that, however much he has enjoyed the 
partnership, his long-term ambitions take him back to his natural world of 
digital disruption.”

Lewis joined the department store group in early 2013 as online director. Two 
years later, he was put in charge of running both shop and online operations. 
He previously served as chief executive of the courier firm CollectPlus and 
before that worked for eBay. He holds a master’s degree in mathematics from the 
University of Cambridge and an MBA from the French business school Insead.

Moneysupermarket was founded by Simon Nixon

 in 1999 at the height of the dotcom boom. Nixon, who dropped out of his 
accountancy degree because it was “too boring”, floated the business on the 
stock market in 2007.
