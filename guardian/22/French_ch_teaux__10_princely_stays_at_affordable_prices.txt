Château de la Côte 
<https://www.sawdays.co.uk/france/aquitaine/dordogne/chateau-de-la-cote#!>, nr 
Périgueux, Dordogne

This spectacular 15th-century château has been owned and run by the same 
family since the last century. Travel past golden sunflower fields and it 
emerges through a forested hilltop. The interior pile oozes grandeur with 
original stone walls, wood panelling, a suit of armour in the hall, and huge 
fireplaces. Bedrooms are old-fashioned but impressive with antiques and 
numerous four-posters to choose from. Breakfast can be taken in the “tower 
room” or on the front lawn. There’s also a pool, children’s play area and a 
secret arbour within the 20 acres of grounds.

This tranquil manoir lies in a private park in the village of 
Fresnoy-en-Gohelle. It was built in 1928 to replace a chateau destroyed in the 
first world war, and the Vimy War Memorial is close by. Light pours in through 
art deco windows and interiors have been enhanced by the owner’s modern taste. 
Sofas face a log-burner in the monumental hall, bedrooms are immaculate (satin 
sheets, electric shutters, smart antiques), and wonderful breakfasts are served 
at a table set with porcelain. Also on offer are a sauna, a gym, and 
simple-but-elegant dinners in each first-floor bedroom.

Etoges, used as a stopover by French kings on journeys east, is a moated 
17th-century château: you pass through the wrought-iron gates then over the 
footbridge to a little island fortress. The grounds have fountains, lawns and 
ponds. It is, indeed, fit for a king, from the rooms with their delicate 
fabrics and linen to the elegant meals with home-grown veg. Opulent bedrooms 
glow with antiques and fresh flowers. The restaurant, in the orangery, has a 
fireplace – and if you fancy breakfast in bed, staff will bring it to your 
lace-covered table.

This château, in the village of La Fermeté, dates back to the Middle Ages and 
has an intriguing history: the Queen of Poland, Marie-Casimire, lived here at 
the tail end of the 17th century. It was enlarged in the 19th century, with 
vast rooms and palatial stables that even have marble-panelled walls, and the 
corridors heave with antlers and stag heads. Cavernous bedrooms are en-suite 
and furnished with unusual antiques; breakfast is taken in the oak-panelled 
dining room with views of the park. Head out to explore the woodlands and river 
contained within the seven kilometres of walls.

The Marquis de Sade’s father and uncle were born in this château in an 
appealing little town at the foot of Mont Ventoux. Though the infamous Marquis 
preferred Paris, he often stayed at Mazan, organising France’s first theatre 
festival here in 1772. These days, it is a family hotel and Frédéric, who 
speaks good English, runs it while his mother takes care of the décor. There 
are frondy palms and secluded spots in the garden and a beautiful terrace for 
dinner; the chef has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants and is keen to win 
his own.

After three years of renovations, the hotel now runs like clockwork. The 
building, athree-storey house with a turret at each end, lords it over five 
hectares of landscaped parkland, with dining terraces, boules pitch and 
infinity pool. For the doers there are cookery lessons, wine tastings and 
electric-bike rentals. Uncluttered bedrooms are full of lofty splendour and 
furnished in classic French style. But dinner is the highlight here – beautiful 
food accompanied by heavenly views. Themenu-de-midi is great value.

If you’re on the trail of local hero Toulouse-Lautrec, then this pretty 
country estate will be right up your street. Set in seven hectares of garden 
and vineyard, the château’s traditional exterior gives no hint of what awaits. 
Inside, art is everywhere: in the flagged entrance hall and the striking red 
room, where breakfast is served, is an ever-changing backdrop of modern 
paintings. The big bedrooms meld old-fashioned comfort with contemporary 
touches, and the château’s verdant grounds are no less impressive – 300 roses 
bloom in the formal garden, and there’s a pool, woodland to explore and a 
pathway that leads to a private jetty on the Tarn.

This château is surrounded by acres of parkland with pool, and inside is 
equally splendid. A sleek modern decor illuminates fine stone work and medieval 
beams, there’s a games room, a grand piano and, beneath the great carved 
fireplace, a breakfast table. In summer, you can tuck into croissants, hams and 
jams by the moat beneath the willow.Spend the day in old Lyon

This château is surrounded by organic olive groves and orchards, which supply 
the fruits for homemade jams, there are benches under vast trees, and a pool 
with loungers and parasols. Inside is a hallway flooded with light, a wide 
stone stairway to galleries above, off which are terracotta and parquet-floored 
salons. The dining room opens up to a balustraded front terrace, glassed-in for 
autumn and spring and open in summer, where buffet breakfasts are taken, and 
there’s a library and a music room, a billiard room and a scarlet salon with a 
fire that can be lit on cooler nights.

This elegant house was built just before the French Revolution, with towers 
added in the early 20th century. It has 18 hectares of park, a pool, rolling 
lawns and ancient trees. Chestnut trees line the approach, a river runs through 
the grounds, there are lakes and woods for ramblers, farm animals – and even 
dromedaries in summer. Several bedrooms have windows on three sides and all are 
spacious. Breakfast comes with a selection of teas in a pretty panelled room or 
on the terrace; dinner is at separate tables.
