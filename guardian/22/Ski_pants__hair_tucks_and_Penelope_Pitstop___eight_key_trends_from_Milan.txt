Bauhaus stripes 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/max-mara/slideshow/collection#24>

Anni Albers was the master of the stripe at the Bauhaus, and her tapestries of 
disparate, busy designs might haveinspired the collections of Fendi, Marni and 
Max Mara 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/26/maxmara-shows-a-collection-thats-hot-on-detail-and-of-course-camel-coats.>
. Clashing stripes are a neat trick – one that worked for wall hangings in the 
1920s as well as it does on a cardie nearly 100 years later.

Sometimes a trend makes its way from the front row to the catwalk. This is the 
case with the hair tuck, practised by fashion editors who also brought you such 
style memes asshoulder robing

andfrayed jeans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/13/how-to-fray-jeans-like-pro-five-point-plan>
. On the catwalk at Missoni and Marni, think of it as a See Now, Do Now trend. 
Or side-swipe the catwalk completely and go for the next frow trend:sweeping

At Armani on Monday, the show notes declared that velvet was the 
“protagonist”, no less, of the collection. There was certainly a lot of it, and 
other designers in Milan were into it, too. See a velvet trouser suit at 
Bottega Veneta, devoré at Marni andflowered at Prada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/25/prada-thinks-differently-at-milan-fashion-week-with-commentary-on-glamour>
. Whether it’s the protagonist of your wardrobe next season, or just a 
supporting character, it’s definitely part of the cast.

Off-piste ski pants 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/versace/slideshow/collection#9>

The kind of item usually reserved for PE teachers in the 80s, the ski pant – 
with its stirrup under the foot – had an unlikely turn on the Milan catwalk, at 
both Versace and Marni. Make sure to wear yours with heels, where the stirrup 
can be fully seen. Add a crop top à la Versace for the full 80s I-do-aerobics 
look.

World Book Day is on Thursday, and dressing as your favourite fictional 
character is no longer just for children. There was a whole lot of make-believe 
in the air in Milan. Gucci had a bit of Penelope Pitstop and some Snow White, 
whileDolce & Gabbana’s collection 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/28/dolce-gabbana-dresses-fit-for-disney-approved-princesses>
 was inspired by princesses including Cinderella and Aurora from Sleeping 
Beauty. Rummaging in the dressing-up box is now for grown-ups, too.

Knitted together 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/jil-sander/slideshow/collection#19>

We’ve had co-ords in fashion for a while – pyjamas, matching skirts and tops. 
The newest take is to make both pieces knitted, as seen at Bottega Veneta, Jil 
Sander and Dolce & Gabbana. The effect has something of the 60s about it – Jean 
Shrimpton photographed by David Bailey. At Jil Sander, adding metallic brought 
the idea up to date.

 Bottega Veneta show, Milan fashion week. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock 
Last season was all about the slipdress. This time, the underwear-as-outerwear 
thing has moved on to corsets. These, like those slipdresses, aren’t to be worn 
in a come-hither manner. Instead, they were over dresses at Prada, and a bit 
old-fashioned when in wool at Bottega Veneta. Interesting is the new sexy.

Tighten up 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/gucci/slideshow/collection#58>

While these are the autumn/winter shows, a whole season can go by 
hosiery-free. Not this time. Models on the Prada catwalk wore thick herringbone 
tights. This, to Prada nerds, harked back to the 90s, and the brand’s geek-chic 
collection.Gucci’s coloured tights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/24/guccis-glamorously-nerdish-aesthetic-returns-with-a-twist>
 were more 70s Twiggy, but equally successful.
