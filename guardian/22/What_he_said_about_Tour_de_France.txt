Channel 4's chief executive, Michael Jackson, said he had no regrets about 
dumping Tour de France cycling after 15 years, despite protests from up to 1m 
fans.

In an online chat today with MediaGuardian.co.uk, he said the station simply 
had to "move on" and tempt viewers with other sports such as cricket.

"Channel 4 has always broadcast a range of sports, but the fact is that if we 
are to innovate we have to move on," said Mr Jackson.

"So just as the channel started with American sport, particularly American 
football - which worked particularly well when football was in its 80s doldrums 
- but then moved on, so the same is true for the Tour de France.

"We've added cricket to the mix, pretty successfully, and next year we start 
our coverage of the World Rally Championship to which we hope to bring the same 
sense of innovation and commitment.

"I do recognise there are many Tour de France viewers who are losing out but 
we felt we were going to be messing them around this summer because of the 
clashes between the tour and the Ashes. "We are looking to find another 
broadcaster to take it on," he said.

When asked "if innovation is about 'moving on' why don't you dump Brookside?", 
theChannel 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> boss replied: "We're 
still covering minority sports such as windsurfing, snowboarding, Formula 
Three, and in December the World Extreme Games. To answer your point about 
Brookside, I think you can 'move on' within a soap, introducing new characters 
and storylines."
