There are lots of things Spike Trotman is good at: drawing, telling stories, 
curating a collection of sex-positive erotic comics directed at women and 
running a small business calledIron Circus Comics <http://ironcircus.com/>, 
which has become Chicago’s largest independent comics publisher.

The business may have made Trotman “internet-famous” as a producer of 
independent art, but her path to success is singular: she has never been able 
to follow the rules.

 Spike Trotman. 
Fifteen years ago, Trotman got into the prestigious School of the Art 
Institute of Chicago. At the time, it looked like a coup, but the school placed 
a condition on her admission: she first had to undergo an additional qualifying 
year. It was a bad sign.

Comics have had an odd trajectory as an art form in America: memorized like 
catechism by their fans, but not regarded by the high-minded as a proper art. 
Back in 2000, Trotman says the faculty were of this view, and things came to a 
head when her faculty adviser called her in for a meeting and more or less 
advised her to uglify her own work. There was too much detail, too much 
realism, they complained. Her pictures actually looked like something.

“She said, ‘You know what you need to do? Get a canvas and put it against the 
wall. Are you right-handed? OK. Take a broom handle and tie a paintbrush to 
[it], and put it in your left hand, and then put your back to the canvas. And 
paint that way!’” she recalls.

Trotman is a practical person; as she’s telling this story, her voice gets 
higher and higher to emphasize the absurdity of the instruction. And though she 
says she finished the year, from that moment she knew she wouldn’t go on into a 
master’s program; she just didn’t fit there.
 Templar, Arizona by Spike Trotman. 
Her taste was not likely to appeal to a commercial publisher, either. So she 
turned, instead, to what was then the wild, untested option: drawing a 
webcomic. At the time, in the early 2000s, the idea of a webcomic was seen as 
plain crazy.

The first work Trotman put online was a slice-of-life comic drawn in 
sepia-tone called Templar, Arizona.

People loved it. A Village Voice review described the plot 
<http://www.villagevoice.com/music/pulp-fictions-chris-onstads-achewood-dash-shaws-bodyworld-and-spikes-templar-arizona-6650024>
 as a comic following “the lives of young alternative newspaper columnist Ben 
Kowalski and some other residents of Templar, a post-apocalyptic city that 
blends ancient Rome and Egypt, Charles Dickens’s London, and the sexy, sporty 
metropolis of Maxim magazine”.


The concept is indeed amusing and bizarre in the best way possible, and one 
can see why a larger commercial publisher might have balked: it doesn’t exactly 
have clear heroes and villains, and Trotman’s sense of humor has a twisted edge 
to it. It displays what would become a hallmark of Trotman’s work, a world 
populated by all sorts of different bodies and types – an issue that she would 
tackle more directly with her smut collection, Smut Peddler.

Her work also pays attention to issues of money and class in a way you rarely 
see directly addressed in American art; another of her projects is a book called
Poorcraft 
<https://ironcircus.com/shop/books/11-poorcraft-the-funnybook-fundamentals-of-living-well-on-less-softcover.html>
, which in illustrated panels provides tips on how to survive on less, right 
down to recipes for household cleaners made out of cheap ingredients.

 An extract from Smut Peddler (2012). 
Trotman has always been very open about how she funded these ventures. At 
first, she simply published Templar on the web, on a domain she owned. She put 
up a “tip jar” link beside it, as well as a little thermometer, and told her 
readers that for every $200 she was able to raise, she’d update an additional 
time a week. She was surprised to see how rapidly people responded to her 
request.

At the time, Trotman says, spending money over the internet was scary. Many 
people thought internet villains would “instantly eat your credit card number 
and run off with it to Best Buy and get 15 big screens”. But readers were 
willing, in her case, to take the risk. It wasn’t a huge amount of money 
(Trotman had a spouse who supported her work), but it was starting to impress 
her.

When Kickstarter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/kickstarter> came 
around in 2009, it was a natural fit.

She set up a project to fund a print version of Templar, which ended up being 
funded well over what she had asked for. She decided here and there to use 
crowdfunding as a kind of angel investor for her work. With this model, Trotman 
says she now sells about $250,000 worth of comics a year. This year, she will 
publish four comics; she’s hoping to get that up to six.

And then there is Smut Peddler, one of her biggest successes.

Inspired by a prior collection of erotic comics, Trotman decided to create her 
own anthology of alternative pornography. She did so after noticing that many 
erotic comics were produced by straight men, for straight men. “People think 
there are no porno comics out there being made ‘for them’, and I wanted to 
prove that there are,” she says.

She called sympathetic friends and acquaintances to ask if they would be 
willing to draw for her. They were – in fact, “It was like they were 
springloaded. Like they had been waiting all their lives for someone to ask 
them to write dirty comics.”

The anthology she produced speaks to a cornucopia of sexual tastes. In some 
instances the settings are high fantasy (Trotman herself drew an erotic story 
based on the Annunciation of Christian theology – the moment where the 
archangel Gabriel tells the Virgin Mary she will give birth to Jesus); in 
others, simple scenarios are used (for example, a lesbian couple negotiates 
their BDSM agreement).

The anthology was instantly popular, and in response to her few detractors, 
Trotman says the demographics speak for themselves. “The readership of comics 
has exploded in the last few years. Comics is headed for definitely more than 
parity – majority women. All of the NYT bestselling comics and graphic novels 
out there are by women, and they’re being read by girls. It’s in the pipe.”

She is disdainful of what she rightly calls “the reactionary, open-mouthed 
shock in a lot of media, where women’s concerns are actually being given a 
place at the table”.

“I have been subjected to moving goalposts my entire career,” Trotman says 
with a laugh. “I could win the Nobel Prize next week, and they’d write a 
five-paragraph article on how I didn’t deserve it and it doesn’t count.”

So, as she’s always done, Trotman says she’s just going her own way. “I want 
my entire career in comics to be a metaphor for that moment in the Anaconda 
video when Nicki Minaj slaps Drake’s hand away from her butt, and walks away 
laughing,” Trotman said.
