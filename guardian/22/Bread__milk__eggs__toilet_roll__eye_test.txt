You can bank, buy a scooter and even get your groceries there - now Tesco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco> has set its sights on the market 
occupied by the high street opticians. It is the first supermarket to introduce 
sight-testing, posing a potential threat to a market still dominated by small 
independent practitioners.

 The service has been launched at a store in Peterborough to determine levels 
of interest before introducing it elsewhere. Judith Robinson, Tesco's customer 
planning manager for health care services, said research had shown that the 
supermarket chain's brand name was strong enough to give it credibility as an 
optician.

 'The optical market is now our main focus in healthcare. We are planning to 
expand the trial and are looking at a roll-out into larger stores across the 
country.'

 The initiative follows the introduction of a dispensing service into four 
Tesco stores two years ago which required customers to bring in their own 
prescriptions. Tesco hopes to undercut the high street with prices for finished 
glasses from £19.95 and frames by designers such as Hugo Boss at £99.95. The 
eye examination will cost £16.

 About 75 per cent of opticians still practise independently. The optical 
market is worth £1.7 billion and grew in value by 6 per cent in 1997.
