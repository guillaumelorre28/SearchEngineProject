Treasurer Joe Hockey <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/joe-hockey> 
has urged first home buyers to get “a good job that pays good money” if they 
want to enter the property market.

When asked at a press conference on Tuesday if residential property in 
Australia’s biggest city was out of the reach of many, Hockey said: “If housing 
were unaffordable inSydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>, 
no one would be buying it.”

“The starting point for first home buyers is to get a good job that pays good 
money,” he added.

The comments were slammed on social media, with many users criticising the 
treasurer for being simplistic and out of touch with the difficulties 
Generation Y faces in enter the property market.

Mr Hockey, next time you're in hospital getting seen to by a nurse, are you 
going to insist that s/he gets a job that pays good money?

Opposition leader Bill Shorten was scathing of the treasurer’s comments.

“What planet is Joe Hockey living on?” Shorten asked. “This isn’t just another 
Joe Hockey gaffe; this is proof he just doesn’t get the pressures families are 
facing.”

Joe Hockey must be the only person in Australia who doesn’t think housing 
affordability is an issue. As far as he’s concerned, if Joe Hockey’s doing OK 
then everyone else is too,” Shorten said.

“How are Australians supposed to find the ‘good jobs that pay more’ when 
unemployment is at its highest levels in more than a decade under his 
government?”

Greens leader Richard Di Natale labelled the treasurer’s comments “fantasy 
land stuff” from a man charged with the “nation’s purse strings”.

“That’s right out there, that sort of language, that’s let them eat cake sort 
of stuff,” Di Natale told reporters in Melbourne. “Go and get a job that pays 
more money? We are just going to magic these jobs up out of thin air?”

Hockey continued to deny that parts of Australia were experiencing a housing 
bubble, saying that housing affordability would become easier as supply 
increased.

“I say again in relation to what is reasonably expensive entry costs for first 
home buyers into housing in Australia, the best response is to build more 
housing,” he said, adding that there is a greater role for both state and local 
governments in accelerating the building process.

The comments come just days after the treasury secretary, John Fraser, warned 
that parts of Sydney and Melbourne areexperiencing a housing bubble 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/01/sydney-and-parts-of-melbourne-are-unequivocally-in-a-house-price-bubble>
, and the head of the financial systems inquiry, David Murray, said a sharp 
fall in property prices could be detrimental to the economy.


In August, Hockey came under fire for being out of touch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/aug/13/joe-hockey-defends-his-poor-people-dont-drive-very-far-comments>
 after suggesting Australia’s “poorest people either don’t have cars or 
actually don’t drive very far in many cases”.

The treasurer admitted on Tuesday that measures to restore integrity in 
foreign investment would not result in a drop in residential prices.

The Foreign Investment Review Board is investigating nearly 200 cases of 
suspected unlawful purchases of property. Foreign investors can buy new 
property in Australia, but must seek approval before purchasing existing 
residential property. Temporary residents who buy property must sell it when 
they leave the country.

“I am not suggesting this is going to represent thousands and thousands of 
homes. But what it is going to do is provide reassurance that people are 
complying with the law when they engage in the purchase of a property,” Hockey 
said. “We welcome foreign investment in new real estate because it adds to the 
stock.”

A new set penalties for foreign investors who buy existing stock will come 
into play from 1 December. The government wants members to dob in suspicious 
foreign property owners via a new telephone hotline. Concerned citizens can 
call the hotline on 1800 050 377.

But Hockey warned against racially profiling investors.

“They may look like foreign buyers, but they’re not,” he said, pointing to the 
fact that some Chinese families have been in Australia longer than his own 
family.
