The evacuation of east Aleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> has 
been completed, bringing to a close a key chapter in the Syrian rebellion 
against the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad.

About 4,000 rebel fighters and civilians left the city on Thursday, the last 
group remaining in the shrunken patch of territory still nominally held by the 
opposition in the city.

The Syrian army said it had retaken Aleppo entirely and brought “security and 
safety” back to the city.

The last evacuations bring the total number of people who have left east 
Aleppo in the last week to a little over 40,000. Their departure came about 
under a deal brokered by Turkey and Russia that teetered on the edge of 
collapse several times.

Tens of thousands of civilians had been facing the prospect of death in a 
final stand against Assad’s offensive, spearheaded by Iranian-backed militias, 
or of surrendering and facing imprisonment or forced “disappearances”. The 
militias have been accused of killing people as they rampaged through east 
Aleppo.

The residents had lived in great deprivation without functioning hospitals and 
with little electricity and water in freezing winter conditions.

After meeting a senior Iranian delegation, Assad said his battlefield 
successes were a “basic step on the road to ending terrorism in the whole of
Syria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> and creating the right 
circumstances for a solution to end the war”.

But a senior United Nations official warned that the thousands of evacuees 
could endure the same situation in their new place of refuge outside the city. 
Many have gone to the province of Idlib, which is under the control of Islamist 
rebels and is expected to be the next target of Assad’s campaign.

The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said an end to hostilities 
across Syria was vital if another battle like that for Aleppo was to be avoided.

“Many of them have gone to Idlib, which could be in theory the next Aleppo,” 
De Mistura said in Geneva.

The Assad regime now controls the whole of Aleppo more than four years after 
it was divided in a rebel offensive.

The loss of the former industrial capital is a major blow to the rebellion, 
which no longer has a strong presence in any of Syria’s major cities, 
relegating it to a rural insurgency dominated by the Islamist rebels still 
standing in Idlib.

Much of the eastern and northern parts of the country remain outside 
government control, and recent defeats in places such as Palmyra raise 
questions about the ability of Assad’s exhausted military and its militia 
allies to hold on to territory outside key cities.

But buoyed by its momentum, largely the result of unflinching support from its 
allies in Moscow and Tehran, the Assad regime will aim to push forward and 
capitalise on the opposition’s disarray.

The Aleppo campaign was marked with great brutality, particularly in the last 
few months when pro-government forces placed the eastern rebel-held districts 
under siege and pursued a relentless policy of aerial bombardment that deployed 
weapons such as bunker-buster bombs and phosphorus.

Prior to the evacuations, the last ceasefire broke down in October over the 
bombing of a humanitarian convoy, an act believed to have been carried out by 
the Russian or Syrian government.

On Thursday, the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, claimed the UN 
panel of inquiry into that attack had concluded it was carried out either by 
the Syrian or Russian air force, describing the incident as indefensible and 
one of the most appalling of the conflict.

The inquiry, often hampered by the Syrian government, found that the attack 
was conducted from the air, and said there had been no suggestion the attack 
was conducted by coalition aircraft, implying it was done by the Russians or 
Syrians.

The five-strong panel, which visited Syria, said it had no conclusive evidence 
as to whether the attack was an error or that those responsible knew the target 
was a joint UN-Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy. Ten people died in the incident 
and 22 people were injured.

At various points Russia or Syria had claimed the attack was conducted by 
ground forces, thus leaving open the possibility that rebel forces were 
responsible. But the inquiry found the attack was mounted from the air using 
multiple types of munitions deployed from more than one aircraft and aircraft 
type.

Johnson said: “I welcome the board of inquiry’s report, which found that the 
aid convoy was attacked from the air, making it clear that the strike was 
carried out by forces of either the Assad regime or Russia.

“This was one of the most appalling incidents of the conflict so far. Whether 
deliberate or accidental, this was an indefensible attack, with at least 10 
people killed and vital aid to vulnerable people destroyed.

“Over half a million Syrians are still in areas besieged by the regime – many 
have received no aid since June.”
