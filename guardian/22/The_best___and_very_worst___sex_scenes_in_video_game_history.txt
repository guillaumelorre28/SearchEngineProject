There has always been sex in video games. As shocking as this revelation may 
be to those who have only ever played Call of Duty, Fifa or Pokémon Go, it’s 
the truth.

As soon as developers were able to put animated pixels on a screen, they were 
trying to make those pixels do rude things. In the early 1980s, for example, a 
publisher named Mystique released a series of “erotic” games for the Atari 
2600, beginning with Burning Desire, in which you played a naked air rescue 
worker. From the very start, realism was important.

Later, we were treated to Sam Fox Strip Poker on the Commodore 64 and Night 
Trap on the Sega Mega Drive, a sort of fuzzy interactive B-movie that was 
deemed so shocking that it became the subject of a congressional hearing.

games Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian 
Since then, a library of games that portray sex and sexuality with something 
approaching good taste has emerged. But how many can we call erotically charged?


To find out, the Guardian games writers Kate Gray and Holly Nielsen spent a 
whole day re-playing and discussing video game sex scenes. In their pyjamas. 
Here are the transcripts of this ill-advised endeavour.

Sera’s scene, Dragon Age: Inquisition

Impulsive elfin archer Sera is a companion character in Bioware’s fantasy 
role-playing adventure. Pursue the relationship correctly and you’re rewarded 
with this scene...

Holly: Let’s be honest, sex in games is rarely super sexy sex. But 
occasionally it gets close.


Kate: It’s mostly moaning sounds and really solid bosoms. Unlike real life – 
am I right?

Holly: If I see one more fade to black then suddenly NAKED …

Kate: … you mean in games, of course?

Holly: …

Kate: Oh. OK. Let’s talk about Dragon Age.

Holly: Right, this is a personal favourite of mine. Often games fall into the 
whole “ooh, this is so passionate and thereforeserious” convention that we 
recognise from Hollywood movies, but Sera’s scene in Inquisition reminds us 
that sex can occasionally be silly and fun.

Kate: The best bit about this is how dorky it is. You get to see your 
character and Sera interacting in this really human way, in that they’re both 
making dumb jokes and being a bit awkward and then they end up screwing anyway. 
Although it’s stiffly animated, it shows the intimacy of a good friendship.

Holly: The fact your character shaves something rude into her pubes to make 
Sera laugh and you both end up giggling yourselves off the bed is adorable.

Kate: We’ve all been there. Once I tried to shave someone’s entire name into 
mine, but I ran out of space …

Holly: I’m sure Jonathan Augustus Maximilian Rufus Anderson would have been 
impressed you tried though.

Kate: OK, let’s move on.

Sims 2

EA’s life sim allows players to build a house then populate it with AI 
characters who can be “persuaded” to fall in love and make out with each other.

Kate: In Sims 2, all it takes to bone someone is to invite them to cuddle and 
it just goes from there – which isn’t necessarily realistic.

Holly: Sims has been the sexual frustration stress ball for many a pre-teen. 
It’s the first game a lot of people play that explicitly has a whole load of 
boning in it. More importantly it’s boning thatyou control. Well, you don’t 
control the mechanics of it – that all happens under the covers.

Kate: Or in a hot tub. Or a changing room. But yes, the weirdest thing about 
Sims sex is that you’re kind of the sex director. You created these people, and 
you have manipulated them into a sexy situation. And, nine times out of 10, in 
your head, those people just happen to be you and the person you’re crushing on 
in real-life. And then you watch them roll around under a thin sheet, and blush 
furiously, imagining that one of the lumps of polygons is you.

Holly: It’s all very quick as well. A jump under the sheets, a few literal 
pyrotechnics, and wham, bam, you’re done. Also, let’s not forget the creepy 
baby noise that plays when you conceive.

Kate: Imagine if that happened in reality. You’re enjoying a post-coital 
cuddle and then suddenly a green diamond appears above you and a little lullaby 
twinkle plays. As you lie in your own juices.

Holly: Yes, it’s truly... wait, what?!

Kate: One time I deleted the bed, because deleting Sims was the way to make 
them happy again (also horrific) – but there was a glitch and it didn’t 
actually delete the Sims – just the bed. All that was left on screen were two 
blobby conjoined naked humans writhing around in ecstasy. Or was it pain? 
Anyway, I never had sex again.

Fable 2

The critically acclaimed fantasy adventure from Lionhead is filled with 
salacious humour and focuses heavily on romance and relationships.

 “My dog has just dug up a condom, fancy a quickie?” 
Holly: The sex in Fable is in keeping with the general humour of the game. 
It’s all fade to black and “Ohhh, very saucy, my love” in a West Country accent.

Kate: I am prepared to believe this is an accurate representation of dating 
someone from the West Country.

Holly: Fable II is also a game in which there are condoms buried in the 
ground... That your dog digs up... And then you use them. Top marks for 
including prophylactics though.

Kate: You can also have group sex and romance people by farting at them until 
they love you.

Holly: This immediately feels like a good time to move on.

The Garrus romance scene, Mass Effect 2

In Bioware’s sci-fi adventure series, lead character Commander Shepard (who 
can be male or female) must save humanity from the evil Reaper force, while 
also romancing members of his/her crew, including the avian reptilian insectoid 
alien, Garrus Vakarian.

Kate: You start off in life being all like, “ugh, I would never want to have 
sex with a beetle”… and then you meet Garrus.

Holly: If you play Mass Effect and don’t fall in love with this insect/cat 
hybrid then I have no respect for you. I adore him.

Kate: I’m just not sure what the logistics of bumping uglies with aliens are. 
I mean, he could have an ovipositor or something. Do you just jam whatever he’s 
packing in whatever hole you can find and hope that it’s fun for everyone? What 
if he’s got a duck penis and it’s all weird like a corkscrew?

Holly: Bioware obviously had no idea either. Although you have a chat with the 
local doctor about the logistics when it comes to shagging the less directly 
anthropomorphic aliens, Bioware’s writers just kinda go, “errr I dunno. FADE TO 
BLACK”. But the awkwardness and the unknown are what makes this so endearing.

Kate: Honestly, I think all video games really struggle with the, uh, 
physicality of sex – whether the penis is alien or not. The whole “fade to 
black” thing is a way around it, because the games that don’t fade to black 
have all this … dry thrusting going on. And you just … part of you knows that 
everyone’s smooth like a Ken doll down there.

Holly: Whatever the fade to black conjures up in our seedy little brains is 
bound to be a hundred times better than what graphics technology can 
realistically render on screen. Especially in Mass Effect 2. Anyway, the appeal 
of this scene is in the way he brings wine and puts on music in an attempt to 
make things nice; it’s in his obvious nervousness and the way he eventually 
lets his guard down. Bravo Bioware, I’m cool with not seeing anything explicit 
if the run-up is as adorable as this. Which brings us nicely to …

The unicorn sex scene, The Witcher 3

The third title in the open-world fantasy adventure series follows monster 
killer Geralt of Rivia as he pulverises mega beasts and flirts with female 
allies Yennifer of Vengerberg and Triss Merrigold.

Holly: You can’t talk about sex scenes in games and not include the infamous 
Witcher 3 unicorn moment.

Kate: I’m a little bit in love with Yennefer. She’s got that Elizabeth Taylor 
violet eyes thing going on, she’s kind of mean but I love it. She’s got a great 
sense of humour and I think she matches up well with Geralt. Also I love Geralt 
and I want the best for him. Yennefer is the best.

Holly: I agree. I’m sorry Triss fans, but her voice is just too damn annoying.

Kate: So anyway, in this scene, you and Yen are necking on a chair or 
something and then she coyly looks to the side … and beckons you over to her 
life-size stuffed unicorn. There’s nothing hotter than fantastical taxidermy.

Holly: I love the implied history between the two of them. Geralt is just 
like, “oh for God’s sake, not the unicorn again”. In any long-term 
relationship, haven’t we all thought that?

Kate: But like with the Sera scene, there’s this sense of intimacy. That’s the 
key to effective video game sex: good writing, good characters.

Holly: This definitely isn’t their first naked unicorn rodeo, but that doesn’t 
make it any less hot. They obviously know each other, know what each other 
like, and can get to business despite the awkward positioning on the back of a 
mythological horse.

Kate: OK, it’s getting hot in here, so let’s cool off with some bad video game 
sex.

The Heavy Rain quick-time sex scene

In this brooding psychological horror game from Quantic Dreams, desperate 
father Ethan Mars must save his kidnapped son from a deranged murderer – with 
help from photojournalist Madison Paige. But it’s not all death, death, death...

Holly: I hate this scene so much. There is no room for quick-time events 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_time_event> in sex.

Kate: It kills the mood when there’s all this moaning and nudity and suddenly 
the game is going “Press X to take off shirt. R2 to circle nipple. Flick 
control stick upwards to initiate coital pleasure.”

Holly: The only way I’d ever be up for quick-time sex is if it got funny when 
you failed one. Like, if you miss a button prompt, Ethan prematurely ejaculates 
in his pants or Madison does a little fanny fart.

Kate: That’s a totally different kind of game, I think.

Holly: A game I’d rather play than Heavy Rain. Even ignoring the silly button 
presses the entire setup is stilted. That whole ‘sure, it’s an inappropriate 
moment but we just need to shag’ set-upcan work. But here, she asks if he’s OK 
and he’s like “I just killed a guy and my son’s probably been kidnapped by a 
serial killer – let’s do it”. The writing is so awkward and clunky.

Kate: It feels so gratuitous. Sure, sometimes people shag at weird times. 
Emotions run high, clothes come off, and before you know it, you’re bonking at 
a funeral. Ithappens. But with games, it can feel like the developer didn’t 
think their narrative was interesting or mature enough without a sex scene.Sex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sex> should be organic – and I don’t 
mean in a Whole Foods kind of way.

Far Cry 3: the sex and death ending

Ubisoft’s action blockbuster has player-character Jason Brody attempting to 
escape an island crawling with ruthless pirates, while also flirting with an 
indigenous tribe of sexy drug addicts.

Kate: So, when we decided to write this, we did a lot of – ahem – research. 
This mostly consisted of watching the relevant sex scenes in a busy-ish cafe 
and saying “Oh my” a lot. But we also looked up what other people liked in a 
video game sex scene, and this was one popped up over and over again. And, 
quite frankly, we’re a little baffled by that. We assume these ‘best video game 
sex’ lists are usually written by guys, but you have to be especially naive to 
think that good sex ends with bleeding out on a sacrificial altar.

Holly: It’s an odd one. I guess maybe because it’s kind of like very weird 
point-of-view porn. It’s all thrusting and grunting and the lady saying very 
ominous things about passing on your seed. Then she stabs you post-ejaculation. 
Although to be fair, she also calls you “perfection” so it’s swings and 
roundabouts.

Kate: We haven’t had any other first-person bone-’em-ups have we? I guess 
that’s what makes this one so, uh, hot?

Holly: If your kink is impregnating someone then being stabbed in the chest, 
then this game definitely ticks all your boxes.

Kate: That would make quite a marketing quote. 

Holly: Thank you. Anyway, I can’t deny that it’s certainly intense. 

Kate: It feels like an interesting piece of trickery by the developers - like 
a trap. If you let yourself be seduced, it pulls the rug from under your feet 
and goes “ahahaaaaa, sex is bad, you idiot!”

Holly: Yeah, it’s a potentially interesting way of taking agency out of the 
player’s hands, but it’s not going on my personal “sexiest sex” list.


Kate: I’ve seen that list. It’s filthy. I’m on it.

Sex and the ceiling in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood

The historical assassination adventure has hooded killer Ezio Auditore da 
Firenze traversing the crowded streets and rooftops of 16th century Rome, while 
occasionally taking a break to ‘fare l’amore’, as our Italian cousins put it.

Kate: So Ezio takes off all his clothes, tosses his hidden blade on the floor 
with a surprising amount of carelessness (“that’s a priceless antique you 
clumsy jerk”) and then climbs into the tub. Saucy. Then a lady comes in, I 
forget who she is, and you bonk. It’s … weirdly long.

Holly: Made even longer by loading screens, which is such a mood killer. Also, 
how is she riding him while still wearing pants? This seems to happen in quite 
a few games. Thrusting, grinding and moaning are all fine but heaven forbid we 
see actual genitalia. Although I suppose accurate wang modelling is not the 
best use of resources.

Kate: I think what was weird about this one was the total lack of 
communication. There’s no sense of intimacy or foreplay, it’s just: trousers 
off, sex, done. And then the roof explodes. I guess we’ve all been there.

Holly: I’m all for the lady taking charge, but Ezio seems to do very little. 
Come on, I know you’re tired from running along rooftops all day but at least 
go on top for a bit.

Kate: In The Witcher they actually mix up the positions. Ezio just starfishes 
his way through this one, and that’s so boring.

X-MAN – pixel sex apocalypse

much put the “Arrrrrgh” into Atari.

Holly: This one is … how do we put it? Ah yes, repulsive. X-Man has nothing to 
do with the Marvel series, but is instead a wildly offensive game released in 
1983 on the Atari 2600. You play as a horny guy who has to navigate to the 
centre of a maze without being emasculated by a pair of scissors – or a crab. 
If you make it, you have unconvincing doggy sex with some pixels.

Kate: It’s like Pac-Man, but with penetration. The box art has a woman 
squidging up her cleavage, which in typical Atari fashion has very little to do 
with what actually happens on screen. The woman in the game has nipples that 
flash on and off and she turns blue-green when she orgasms. It’s pretty hot. 
It’s not accurate, but it’s hot.

Holly: So basically, your reward for completing a rudimentary maze is to watch 
one set of pixels slowly penetrating another. It’s like a Freudian sex 
nightmare set in the 1982 Disney movie Tron.

Kate: And that’s why this is our favourite sex scene in video games.

Holly: Can I go home now? I feel weird.
