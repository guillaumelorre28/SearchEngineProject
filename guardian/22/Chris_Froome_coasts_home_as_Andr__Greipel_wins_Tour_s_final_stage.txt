André Greipel won the final stage of the Tour de France, holding off the 
late-charging world champion, Peter Sagan, in the traditional sprint on the 
Champs-Élysées after racing clear of Norway’s Alexander Kristoff on the run-in.

The French hope Bryan Coquard was denied the chance to go for victory as he 
was held up by a late mechanical failure.

Froome was met just after the finish line by his wife, Michelle, and son, 
Kellan, as the celebrations began in earnest. The Team Sky rider had been able 
to enjoy the traditional procession into Paris, sipping champagne and drinking 
from a bottle of beer, before the sprinters got their moment in the capital.

There were late dramas, with Etixx-QuickStep’s Marcel Kittel hit by a 
mechanical problem about 30km from the finish of this 113km stage from 
Chantilly and Coquard pulled over with a puncture with the finish line almost 
in sight.

Kristoff attacked first but Greipel, with his Lotto-Soudal lead-out train 
doing its job on the final approach, burst clear to make sure he did not leave 
this Tour empty-handed.

Froome becomes only the eighth man, not counting the disgraced Lance 
Armstrong, to win three or more Tours and will now have his sights set on the 
record of five jointly held by Jacques Anquetil, Miguel Indurain, Bernard 
Hinault and Eddy Merckx.

The 31-year-old had to all intents sealed victory by staying upright on 
Saturday’s 146km stage 20 from Megève to Morzine

 before Sunday’s largely processional stage.

With a four-minute advantage in his pocket he was able to sit up and enjoy the 
moment with his team-mates, conceding time in the final metres to leave him 
with a final winning margin of two minutes and 52 seconds over the Frenchman 
Romain Bardet.
