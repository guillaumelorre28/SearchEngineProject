Instagram model Lucky Blue Smith has announced that he is penning his first 
book 
<http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/551292/untitled-lucky-blue-smith-by-lucky-blue-smith>
, “charting his whirlwind journey”, which will include advice on “the pressures 
modern-day teens are facing”. Presumably he won’t be agony uncle-ing on how to 
best deal with the crushing disappointment that you aren’t born with a blue 
steel gaze and millions of Instagram followers.


The biggest question is, of course, what the tome will be called: Lucky Man? 
Blond Ambition?Blue (Da Be Dee) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9RePc>? 
Of course, we’re hoping for the latter. But he wouldn’t be the first 
model-turned-author.

the Guardian 
Grandaughter of Roald, Dahl became one of the first plus-size models in the 
middle of the heroin-chic 90s. She famously posed naked for an Yves Saint 
Laurent Opium advert, which was later banned. A second life as an author 
provided mixed results: Dahl’s debut,The Man with the Dancing Eyes 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Dancing-Eyes-Sophie-Dahl/dp/0747563721/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1467363136&sr=1-7&keywords=Sophie+Dahl>
, an illustrated short story possibly inspired by her relationship with Mick 
Jagger, was described as “whimsical” and “fairy-tale like”. Perhaps more 
presciently, her prose was summed up with the side-eyed epithet: “beautiful 
illustrations”. Ahem. She later reinvented herself as a celebrity chef.

Brand Campbell enjoyed a big year in 1994. Her debut novel, Swan 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Swan-Naomi-Campbell/dp/3802523237/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1467363320&sr=1-1&keywords=naomi+campbell+Swan>
, was released in a PR double-whammy alongside her album,Babywoman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/oct/03/naomi-campbell-baby-woman-re-reviewed-20-years-on>
. Written, she said, to get back at journalists who had got her wrong in the 
press, she called the tale a “cute story”. This meta narrative story involved a 
golden bowl of supermodels involved in all manner of Jackie Collins-ish 
plotting (murder, blackmail). Campbell recklessly admitted that she “just did 
not have the time to sit down and write a book”, which, at the time, was seen 
as a violation of some sort of moral code bestowed on all authors byMichiko 
Kakutani 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/01/dontmesswithmichikokakutan>
, instead of a standard element of celebrity memoiring. Campbell was on much 
steadier ground with her next literary endeavour,Naomi

, a coffee-table career retrospective.

Banks was the first black model to be on the cover of GQ. She was also the 
first model to write a young adult fantasy/sci-fi novel about a character 
called Tookie de la Creme (surely her Ru Paul’s Drag Race name?). Tookie wins a 
place at an elite boarding school,Modelland

, where she gets a chance to join the most elite supermodel team in the world, 
the Intoxibellas. “I am pretty certain this is literally the worst book I have 
ever read,” one Amazon reviewer said. To that reader we say: it’s the first in 
a trilogy of books.

 features a protagonist who is a thinly veiled version of herself. But though 
Jessica is a singer not an aspiring model trying to make it big, she is, like 
Clancy, from Liverpool. “I’m not saying I wrote it all myself,” the author 
announced in a spot of self-defeating pre-publicity.
