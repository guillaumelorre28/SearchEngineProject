“I want my kids to be educated. My daughter dreams of being a surgeon; I want 
her to get her degree so she can realise her dream,” says Alice Nekoye 
Waneloba, 49, taking a break from slashing weeds in the midday sun to prepare a 
meal in her living room, where she is surrounded by photographs of her 10 
children.

Sending children to university is a top priority for millions of Kenya’s 
subsistence farmers, but for decades they have been held back by slow economic 
development, which experts attribute to poor farming techniques, a lack of 
fertiliser and low-quality seeds.

Apart from running a handful of temporary programmes, such as providing 
mosquito nets and fertiliser subsidies, the Kenyan government has not 
prioritised policies aimed at spurring rural development.

 “I don’t feel the government has helped me. I want them to provide 
electricity and water to this area, but they have not done that,” says Elam 
Kangaya, a 43-year-old father of five.

His feelings are echoed by Jarius Wekesa, 42, who lives in neighbouring 
Miendo. “The government has not helped me. They should provide loans so I can 
buy more land - that would increase my profits,” he says. “I want my kids to 
take up any career they want. If they want to be doctors, traders, police 
officers, they can choose whichever career they want.”

In Miendo, a group of women gathered beneath a mango tree are discussing their 
loan repayments with a representative from One Acre Fund (OAF), a Kenya-based 
NGO partly funded by the Gates Foundation that provides fertiliser, seeds and 
solar lights to about 200,000 farmers in Burundi, Kenya, Tanzaniaand Rwanda.

The organisation, which also has trials in Ethiopia and Malawi, employs 823 
local staff in Kenya who check in with farmers every week and collect loan 
repayments. Those enrolled in OAF are split into groups of about a dozen; when 
one farmer cannot repay a loan, others in the group have to pick up the slack 
or face being cut off.

The meeting’s host, Topista Musombi, 40, says she borrowed 4,100 shillings 
(£30) from the organisation, which she used to buy fertiliser and an oil barrel 
of seeds. This has helped boost her farm’s output from about 270kg of maize 
last year to 810kg in this year’s harvest, she says.

Musombi also bought solar lights, which reduced her electricity bill and came 
in useful during the sporadic power outages.

 Elam Kangaya bought a motorcycle with the profits from his farm. 
“We have found that lending to farmers is most effective when we lend seed and 
fertiliser instead of cash. Providing assets to farmers ensures that the loan 
is utilised for the intended purpose, and overcomes the challenge of limited 
access to seed and fertiliser close to the homes of our clients,”says Stephanie 
Hanson 
<http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/News/Bridging-the-microfinance-gap-for-smallholder-farmers?ct=true>
, OAF’s senior vice-president of policy and partnerships.

The organisation aims to serve 1 million farmers by 2020, which would more 
than triple its current customer base.

“It’s absurdly simple to improve agricultural productivity,” says Andrew Youn, 
OAF’s co-founder <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN0vn_zUS6o>, explaining that 
offering loans in conjunction with seeds and fertiliser has allowed many 
farmers enrolled in the programme to produce more food.

One key factor behind sub-Saharan Africa’s poor agricultural output is a lack 
of fertiliser. African farmers apply merely13kg of fertiliser per arable hectare
 <http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.CON.FERT.ZS>, which Youn says is 
“insane”. Asian farmers use an average of 312kg of fertiliser per hectare and 
Europeans 148kg.

Sarah Wafula, 42, says that before she joined OAF, she harvested 400kg of 
maize from her half acre of land. Now, with new farming techniques and the 
right seeds, she has doubled her output to 800kg, she says.

By 2050, the world’s population is projected to reach 9.1 billion. Feeding 
this many people would mean increasing food production by 70% from 2007 levels, 
according to theFood and Agriculture Organisation 
<http://www.fao.org/economic/esa/publications/details/en/c/147899/> (FAO). 
“Production in developing countries would need to almost double,” according to 
the FAO.

While boosting the agricultural output of small-scale farmers could be a 
crucial tool in solving the impending food crisis, creating new sources of 
wealth is also a top priority, says Jakob Skoet, an economist at the FAO’s
Agricultural Development Economics division. 
<http://www.fao.org/economic/esa/esa-home/en/#.VLQBSWSsWDo>

“Income generation is just as important as the food supply – I think that’s 
very important to bring out in the overall discussion of the future of food 
security,” he says.

“These farmers can increase their income and they can increase their food 
production through farming, however it is just as important to ensure that they 
have other opportunities for income generation, so that they can afford to 
purchase food.”

 OAF sells solar lights to farmers. 
As well as providing seeds and fertiliser, OAF sells solar lights to farmers, 
reducing their dependence on Kenya’s sporadic power services, and livestock, 
which can help farmers afford large one-off purchases like medical treatment. 
The group is considering offering loans for school fees.

“We see ourselves as a sort of Amazon.com for farmers. We’re looking for any 
set of impact-producing products that we can provide,” says Kiette Tucker, the 
deputy director of OAF Kenya.

As Kangaya poses for photos with his motorcycle, which he purchased with new 
farming revenues, he says: “If my children are educated, they will be the ones 
to bring electricity here.”

 * This article has been amended to clarify the countries in which One Acre 
Fund works, make clear that the organisation is based in Kenya rather than the 
US, and correct the number of farmers served by the fund from 300,000 to 
200,000, and the quantity of maize harvested by Sarah Wafula.
