“I am still in shock,” says a sweat-drenched and breathless Sagan, and thanks 
“the biggest fans’ group here from Slovakia” who had come to support him. He 
praises Kolar’s work in the closing stages and gives a shout-out to the 
regulars from his local, before embracing his brother and fellow rider Juraj. 
Aww!

Looking at the replay, Cavendish just got slightly congested behind Matthews 
as he went left for the line, with Sagan going to his right and getting clear 
to edge home. Boonen takes bronze. You can’t really fault Cavendish’s ride, 
given the odds he was up against it following the problems his team encountered 
early in the race, but Sagan was masterful and proved his class again, to take 
his second world title.

4km to go. Terpstra breaks to the front! But Van Avarmaet goes with him. While 
Blyth staves off an attack on Cavendish from Boasson Hagen. Then Kolar of 
Slovakia takes over at the front.

Now Boasson Hagen comes to the front, ahead of his Norwegian team-mates, as 
Benatti peels away from the front too. Terpstra and Leezer of the Dutch team 
are still hanging in there as well.

7.5km to go. Naesen pulls away from the front, letting a straining, exerting 
Stuyven clear at the front, though he’s not pulling out altogether, and he 
carries on at the back of the pack. But Boonen effectively only has two 
team-mates left now. What a finish this promises to be – still too tough to call

It looks as if Boonen backs himself in a straight sprint, confident in his 
Belgian team-mates to set the scene. It’s still a big ask. Meanwhile, Cavendish 
is on the wheel of Sagan, waiting, calculating. 12km remaining – and still we 
wait for a big attack or break.

Cavendish and Blythe are still about halfway back in the front group, chatting 
away about their options, as they come to the bell. One lap to go, with Stuyven 
at the front, followed by Bennati and Naesen. This looks as if it’s going to be 
very close, and tense.

More on the crowds, or lack of. “There’s plenty of people here who want to 
watch the race,” writes Steven Cumming in Qatar, “the problem is the men’s race 
is on a Sunday which is the beginning of the working week in the Islamic world. 
UCI seem to be unable to budge the signature road event due to television 
rights one thinks.

“Saying that I was at the women’s race yesterday, and there was a conspicuous 
absence of local support, only western expats or travelling fans. The only 
sport out here that will get any engagement is motorsport or football (soccer). 
Qatar 2022 world cup will of course be rammed with international fans 
predominantly from established rich world footballing nations. Even the dead 
rubber matches of little significance will get attendances as the authorities 
will likely draft the local labour population.”

Meanwhile, the third group (the second chasing pack) are now flagged in en 
masse. 21km to go.

Viviani drops back for a tactical chinwag with his race car – an interesting 
move so close to the finish – but he’s still in contention, on Sagan’s wheel. 
the flat course giving little away in terms of offering clues over fatigue or 
tactics. 25km to go, and still no attacks, though they’re still pedalling at a 
fair old pace.

Keukelaire has worked himself to the bone, but it’s now taking its toll and he 
slips to the back, his shift done. Stuyven of Belgium goes to the front, Blythe 
and Cavendish still in the midst of it all, crossing the line with two laps to 
go in 12th and 13th respectively. Remarkably, a number of the initial breakaway 
group from many hours ago, including Roth, Dougall and Berharne, are still with 
the leaders now.

The absence of spectators at roadsides does lend a slightly strange atmosphere 
to everything, as a number of your emails have pointed out. Crossing sports, is 
this what we can expect at Qatar 2022? On the road, nothing much has changed 
for a while – are we heading for a straight-up sprint finish? We have 33km 
remaining.

Degenkolb calls it a day! He looks angry and dejected, as has been blatantly

Naesen just pulls off the front to let Keukelaire have another turn up the 
front. Belgium will be disappointed if they can’t manage a victory here, but 
while Cavendish is among them, he cannot be discounted. Just under 50km to go.

The lead group have been strung out for pretty much the entirety of the 100km 
or so they’ve been at the head of the race. It’s been intense – will tiredness 
take its toll? Angry John Degenkolb continues to have a go at the front of the 
first chasing pack, but they’re still just under two minutes behind.

So, with the gap at two minutes plus from the chasing group, where and when 
are the breakaways going to come from the leading group? Cavendish and Sagan 
both have to calculate how to deal with the team groups around them – from the 
strongly represented Belgium, Italy and Norway – and might even go against type 
and work together, as the less protected contenders. There are now four laps to 
go. Naesen of Belgium remains at the very front.

Keukelaire, who’s ridden excellently, comes to the front for the moment as the 
Belgian masterclass continues. Cavendish and Sagan remain tight next to each 
other. Some tomfoolery group in the chasing back as Degenkolb storms across the 
line between friendly ‘bantz’ and outright needle and squirts a bottle of water 
at the Belgian Debuscchere behind him. Fraught rush-hour-style road-rage stuff, 
this, and an official drives over to have a word.

The German riders Degenkolb and Griepel are raging against the dying of the 
light back in the chasing group – they’re more than two minutes behind now and 
don’t look like making up the ground they need, but they haven’t given up. Yet. 
70km to go.

With five laps to go there are three Belgians and three Italians at the very 
front (Naesen leading), with Boasson Hagen next, and Boonen and Cavendish just 
sitting back, poised. No major moves yet until the front-runners can be sure 
the chasing group’s out of the game.

Degankolb tries another break from the chasing group, which is two minutes 
behind now, but the German can’t force the issue due to the inevitable Belgian 
pressure. Blythe is safely back in the leading group, and his team-mate 
Cavendish is still very much in there, biding his time for the finish.

Bennati is back at the front of the lead group, with Cavendish about two 
thirds of the way down it. A bit of bother for his team-mate Blythe though – he 
has to stop to fix a puncture. Greipel meanwhile tries to lead another attack 
from the chasing group, but the Belgians are having none of it and stay with 
him. In the second group Scott Thwaites takes a tumble but is back on his bike 
soon enough.

Degankolb tries to lead one last break from the chasing pack, but the Belgians 
have been excellent among this group too and stay on his tail. Up at the front, 
Boonen is just sitting back as his muckers do the work at the very front but 
looks composed. Naesen is first over the line at the end of the first lap. And 
the gap is now 1:40 between the front and the chase group, who might just be 
effectively knocking it all on the head shortly.

Way back down the field, the riders in the fourth chasing group are flagged 
off the course. It’s a measure of how punishing this race has been that it’s a 
sizeable group indeed. Rowe, Thomas and Cummings are among them – a desperately 
disappointing end for those GB riders. At the front, the gap between the 
Belgium-dominated leading group and the main chasing one is stretched to 1:30. 
Though Viviani of Italy is at the very front at present.

without a team, he might get left alone. He's all about hooking the right wheel 
in the last 2kms

Switzerland’s Michael Schar is another in the fraying chasing group to say, 
‘what the hell? Why not have an attack’ and does so, but there’s little that’s 
concerted going on among that pack.

The Belgians and the Italians appear to have conferred on tactics, with 
Bennati slipping back into a domestique role, to ensure pressure is maintained 
on the chasing group, just to keep those fancied riders in the chasing group at 
arm’s length. 100km to go!

Bennati of Italy is first over the line at Intermediate 1, followed by Blythe, 
as they enter the circuit with seven laps to go. Haller attacks to move ahead 
of the chasing group, in which Britain’s Thwaites and Swift are hanging on in 
there. Caleb Ewan of Australia pulls out at the first crossing of that finish 
line.

Peter Sagan makes a mistake – but only in failing to grab some refreshment; 
he’s still very much in the mix, race-wise, as is Cavendish, while the 
Norwegian pair Boasson Hagen and Kristoff are riding well too. It’s been a 
rotten race for Germany mind, with no riders in the front group, and Greipel 
and Kittel marooned in the chasing pack. The Belgians are working well to shut 
down and contain Greipel at the head of that group too.

The Belgians lead a train at the front, with no real sign of the gap closing 
to the chasing pack – it’s still just over a minute. Now they’re on the 
seven-lap circuit Belgium can boss things from here, as they prove by just 
stepping up the pace a little to keep up that gap.

We’re back in more built-up territory now as the riders encounter at a couple 
of symbols of modern Qatar - a big stadium and a ring road. The leading group 
have an advantage of a minute and eight seconds over the next one. There’s 
123km to go. Boonen, Sagan and Cavendish in contention – Belgium in general in 
the box seat. Of the early breakaway group, the South African Dougall remains 
impressively up among the front-riders

Cavendish is riding well in the circumstances, it must be said, unfazed by the 
loss of team-mates (though Blythe is sticking to his task) and the dominance of 
the Belgians, who with six riders in the leading group continue to hold all the 
aces. A less than chuffed Kittel leads the second group, but it’ll be tough to 
make that ground now.

The chasing group, exposed and lacking team-assistance, look poorly placed to 
reel in the front runners now, especially against an unforgiving wind. Which 
means the riders in that early breakaway group, staying with the leaders, are 
still nicely positioned. For the British, Cavendish and Blythe are still on 
their own and likely to remain so.

The early breakaway group are caught, parting as Boonen leads the Belgian 
train right through the middle of them, with 144km to go. Sagan and Cavendish 
are still among the front group, as is Boasson-Hagen of Norway. It’s all gone a 
bit pear-shaped for Ireland’s Sam Bennett, who was riding strongly earlier but 
has now dropped right back, possibly suffering from a hand injury.

Tom Boonen has 22 stage wins in Qatar under his belt, and it is showing in 
both his and his team’s performance. Cavendish is still among them in the first 
chasing group, but shorn of all team-mates bar Rowe (unless the British riders 
in the second group can make serious ground), he faces a big uphill task now, 
though not literally, in the punishing, flat windswept desert. Scores on the 
doors now: 21 seconds from the leaders to group 1, who are a minute or so ahead 
of the second group.

Marcel Kittel is another expected contender who’s nowhere, straggling back in 
the peloton’s third group, as the race calms down a touch after the chaotic 
kerfuffling of a few kilometres back. Ramirez of Colombia and Lagkuti of 
Ukraine are the very front two in the race, but it’s almost game over for that 
first breakaway group, whose lead on the first group is now whittled down to 
under a minutes and a half.

Meanwhile Andre Greipel, quiet thus far, moves to the front of the second 
group in the peloton, but he’s some way off making his mark. The second group 
sits 40 seconds or so behind the first, who are closing on the leading group, 
which now has a lead of only two and a half minutes.

It’s all got very chaotic, including for the race organisers’ computer system, 
which is glitch-ridden and confusing the TV commentary team. There are only 
25-30 riders in this race now, with Blythe providing the assistance to 
Cavendish, but the Belgians remain compact and in control, while almost 
everyone else looks stressed and ragged.

Cavendish and Blythe are the only British riders together in that first group, 
in which Tom Boonen and Peter Sagan are now nicely placed. It’s going to be 
very tough for Cavendish now. More crash woe for Colombia, as Ramirez in the 
leading group skids off onto his backside as his front wheel appears to be 
lifted off the ground, suggesting the wind is getting up once more. 159km to go.

There are some actual spectators now – well, a couple of people with Spanish 
flags. In front of them they see a nasty little crash – the Australian 
Durbridge colliding with Mezgec of Slovenia and Gaviria of Colombia at the back 
of the second group in the peloton. The Belgian still in command at the front 
of the first group in the peloton, which is now under four minutes from the 
leaders.

All sorts going on now. The Belgians are pushing hard now at the head of the 
peloton, and it’s disrupted Britain’s strategy – Geraint Thomas and Luke Rowe 
have dropped right back, which will concern Cavendish. Sam Bennett, the Belgian 
born Irish rider, is battling gamely among the Belgians at the front of the 
peloton. Peter Sagan’s well in contention too – there’s 167km to go, and under 
five minutes separate the leading group from the rest. There are now two very 
distinct groups in the peloton.

We’re heading south again now, the road narrower, a tad more uneven looking, 
and taking its toll. The Netherlands’ Tom Dumoulin’s had to retreat for 
technical assistance, a possible flat tyre. The peloton is now properly 
fragmented and strung out, the British and Belgian riders still pushing 
strongly at its head. Caleb Ewan of Australia is struggling now, and has 
dropped right back. And there’s been a nasty little crash involving the 
American Marcotte, who’s one of three riders unseated.

The Belgian riders make a drive for the front of the peloton, but Britain’s 
Luke Rowe makes it to the very front of the pack as they make their first turn, 
Cavendish just behind him. The leading group are being reined in now, the gap 
down to 6:50. The first splits are beginning to emerge in the peloton, as the 
British team pile on the pressure. This is impressive stuff.

These are some of the straightest and flattest and frankly dullest roads 
you’ll see, but they’ll be turning soon, and the peleton has closed on the 
leading group to under eight minutes, with Corella of Mexico dropping back from 
it. The British team still look nicely placed at the front of the peloton.

A swirling sandstorm just misses the front of the peloton, in which the Dutch 
move up towards the front. The gap to the leading group is now just under nine 
minutes behind the leading group, but no significant movements as yet. 185km to 
go.

A little bit of jostling and jockeying in the peloton as they approach the 
turn back towards Doha, and the wind begins to pick up. Australia’s Renshaw and 
Ewan drop to the back for ice pack and cooling assistance before working their 
way wide on the left back into a congested pack. The absence of crowds or 
landmarks along the way lends a slightly odd atmosphere to proceedings. 190km 
to go.

Mid-amble

Morning everyone. Welcome to live coverage of the men’s world road race. 
Essential technical maintenance work meant Guardian Towers had to turn the 
internet off and turn it on again overnight, which means you join us mid-race, 
but with still just under 200km or so to go in the searing heat in Qatar.

So what’s happening? The early breakaway was led by Ramirez of Colombia, 
Morocco’s Anass Ait el Abdia, Sergiy Lagkuti of Ukraine, Ryan Roth of Canada, 
Eritrea’s Natnael Berhane, Nick Dougall of South Africa, and the Mexican Rene 
Corella. The lead group is about 10 minutes ahead of the peloton, at the head 
of whichMark Cavendish <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/markcavendish> is 
being assiduously looked after by Steve Cummings, and his GB team-mates.

It looks mercilessly scorching out there, as they head towards the turn. I 
feel parched and weary just watching it, and I’m in rainy London.

Peter Sagan beats Mark Cavendish to the line to win road race world title

Anyway, that’s all from me after a gruelling and ultimately compelling old 
race. Thanks for your company and correspondence and stay on the site for 
reports and reaction. Bye.

 
“I am still in shock,” says a sweat-drenched and breathless Sagan, and thanks 
“the biggest fans’ group here from Slovakia” who had come to support him. He 
praises Kolar’s work in the closing stages and gives a shout-out to the 
regulars from his local, before embracing his brother and fellow rider Juraj. 
Aww!
 
Looking at the replay, Cavendish just got slightly congested behind Matthews 
as he went left for the line, with Sagan going to his right and getting clear 
to edge home. Boonen takes bronze. You can’t really fault Cavendish’s ride, 
given the odds he was up against it following the problems his team encountered 
early in the race, but Sagan was masterful and proved his class again, to take 
his second world title.

Stunning finish. Leezer is hauled in, Blythe leads out Cavendish, but Sagan 
comes through and wins on the line, with Cavendish in second

Leezer of Holland attacks with 2.5 to go, opening up quite the gap. Has he got 
enough? Roelandts of Belgium pursues, with Boonen on his wheel. Suddenly 
Belgium are up against it
 
3km to go: Kolar leads from Terpstra. Cavendish is still on Sagan’s wheel in 
the centre of the group.
 
4km to go. Terpstra breaks to the front! But Van Avarmaet goes with him. While 
Blyth staves off an attack on Cavendish from Boasson Hagen. Then Kolar of 
Slovakia takes over at the front.
 
Now Boasson Hagen comes to the front, ahead of his Norwegian team-mates, as 
Benatti peels away from the front too. Terpstra and Leezer of the Dutch team 
are still hanging in there as well.
 
7.5km to go. Naesen pulls away from the front, letting a straining, exerting 
Stuyven clear at the front, though he’s not pulling out altogether, and he 
carries on at the back of the pack. But Boonen effectively only has two 
team-mates left now. What a finish this promises to be – still too tough to call
 
The Belgians continue to sit at the front, Cavendish and Blythe continue 
conferring at the back, Boonen will surely be readying himself …
 
It looks as if Boonen backs himself in a straight sprint, confident in his 
Belgian team-mates to set the scene. It’s still a big ask. Meanwhile, Cavendish 
is on the wheel of Sagan, waiting, calculating. 12km remaining – and still we 
wait for a big attack or break.
 
Cavendish and Blythe are still about halfway back in the front group, chatting 
away about their options, as they come to the bell. One lap to go, with Stuyven 
at the front, followed by Bennati and Naesen. This looks as if it’s going to be 
very close, and tense.

12 countries among the leading group: which one is going to win? #UCIDoha2016

More on the crowds, or lack of. “There’s plenty of people here who want to 
watch the race,” writes Steven Cumming in Qatar, “the problem is the men’s race 
is on a Sunday which is the beginning of the working week in the Islamic world. 
UCI seem to be unable to budge the signature road event due to television 
rights one thinks.

“Saying that I was at the women’s race yesterday, and there was a conspicuous 
absence of local support, only western expats or travelling fans. The only 
sport out here that will get any engagement is motorsport or football (soccer). 
Qatar 2022 world cup will of course be rammed with international fans 
predominantly from established rich world footballing nations. Even the dead 
rubber matches of little significance will get attendances as the authorities 
will likely draft the local labour population.”

Meanwhile, the third group (the second chasing pack) are now flagged in en 
masse. 21km to go.
 
Viviani drops back for a tactical chinwag with his race car – an interesting 
move so close to the finish – but he’s still in contention, on Sagan’s wheel. 
the flat course giving little away in terms of offering clues over fatigue or 
tactics. 25km to go, and still no attacks, though they’re still pedalling at a 
fair old pace.
 
Keukelaire has worked himself to the bone, but it’s now taking its toll and he 
slips to the back, his shift done. Stuyven of Belgium goes to the front, Blythe 
and Cavendish still in the midst of it all, crossing the line with two laps to 
go in 12th and 13th respectively. Remarkably, a number of the initial breakaway 
group from many hours ago, including Roth, Dougall and Berharne, are still with 
the leaders now.
 
The absence of spectators at roadsides does lend a slightly strange atmosphere 
to everything, as a number of your emails have pointed out. Crossing sports, is 
this what we can expect at Qatar 2022? On the road, nothing much has changed 
for a while – are we heading for a straight-up sprint finish? We have 33km 
remaining.
 
So, we have 37km remaining now, and challengers to the still-dominant Belgians 
include Viviani of Italy, Michael Matthews of Australia, Boasson Hagen and 
Kristoff of Norway, Slovakia’s Sagan and of course Cavendish.
 
Degenkolb calls it a day! He looks angry and dejected, as has been blatantly 
obvious for the past hour. Kittel has jacked it in too. The chasing group is 
now three minutes behind, and out of it.
 
Naesen just pulls off the front to let Keukelaire have another turn up the 
front. Belgium will be disappointed if they can’t manage a victory here, but 
while Cavendish is among them, he cannot be discounted. Just under 50km to go.
 
The lead group have been strung out for pretty much the entirety of the 100km 
or so they’ve been at the head of the race. It’s been intense – will tiredness 
take its toll? Angry John Degenkolb continues to have a go at the front of the 
first chasing pack, but they’re still just under two minutes behind.
 
So, with the gap at two minutes plus from the chasing group, where and when 
are the breakaways going to come from the leading group? Cavendish and Sagan 
both have to calculate how to deal with the team groups around them – from the 
strongly represented Belgium, Italy and Norway – and might even go against type 
and work together, as the less protected contenders. There are now four laps to 
go. Naesen of Belgium remains at the very front.
 
Keukelaire, who’s ridden excellently, comes to the front for the moment as the 
Belgian masterclass continues. Cavendish and Sagan remain tight next to each 
other. Some tomfoolery group in the chasing back as Degenkolb storms across the 
line between friendly ‘bantz’ and outright needle and squirts a bottle of water 
at the Belgian Debuscchere behind him. Fraught rush-hour-style road-rage stuff, 
this, and an official drives over to have a word.

John Degenkolb has lost it! #UCIDoha2016 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCIDoha2016?src=hash> - the most exciting thing 
that’s happened in this race
 <https://twitter.com/blogdroed/status/787627517016506368> October 16, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/blogdroed/status/787627517016506368>  
The German riders Degenkolb and Griepel are raging against the dying of the 
light back in the chasing group – they’re more than two minutes behind now and 
don’t look like making up the ground they need, but they haven’t given up. Yet. 
70km to go.
 
With five laps to go there are three Belgians and three Italians at the very 
front (Naesen leading), with Boasson Hagen next, and Boonen and Cavendish just 
sitting back, poised. No major moves yet until the front-runners can be sure 
the chasing group’s out of the game.
 
Degankolb tries another break from the chasing group, which is two minutes 
behind now, but the German can’t force the issue due to the inevitable Belgian 
pressure. Blythe is safely back in the leading group, and his team-mate 
Cavendish is still very much in there, biding his time for the finish.
 
Bennati is back at the front of the lead group, with Cavendish about two 
thirds of the way down it. A bit of bother for his team-mate Blythe though – he 
has to stop to fix a puncture. Greipel meanwhile tries to lead another attack 
from the chasing group, but the Belgians are having none of it and stay with 
him. In the second group Scott Thwaites takes a tumble but is back on his bike 
soon enough.
 
Degankolb tries to lead one last break from the chasing pack, but the Belgians 
have been excellent among this group too and stay on his tail. Up at the front, 
Boonen is just sitting back as his muckers do the work at the very front but 
looks composed. Naesen is first over the line at the end of the first lap. And 
the gap is now 1:40 between the front and the chase group, who might just be 
effectively knocking it all on the head shortly.
 
Way back down the field, the riders in the fourth chasing group are flagged 
off the course. It’s a measure of how punishing this race has been that it’s a 
sizeable group indeed. Rowe, Thomas and Cummings are among them – a desperately 
disappointing end for those GB riders. At the front, the gap between the 
Belgium-dominated leading group and the main chasing one is stretched to 1:30. 
Though Viviani of Italy is at the very front at present.

Switzerland’s Michael Schar is another in the fraying chasing group to say, 
‘what the hell? Why not have an attack’ and does so, but there’s little that’s 
concerted going on among that pack.
 
The Belgians and the Italians appear to have conferred on tactics, with 
Bennati slipping back into a domestique role, to ensure pressure is maintained 
on the chasing group, just to keep those fancied riders in the chasing group at 
arm’s length. 100km to go!
 
Bennati of Italy is first over the line at Intermediate 1, followed by Blythe, 
as they enter the circuit with seven laps to go. Haller attacks to move ahead 
of the chasing group, in which Britain’s Thwaites and Swift are hanging on in 
there. Caleb Ewan of Australia pulls out at the first crossing of that finish 
line.
 
Peter Sagan makes a mistake – but only in failing to grab some refreshment; 
he’s still very much in the mix, race-wise, as is Cavendish, while the 
Norwegian pair Boasson Hagen and Kristoff are riding well too. It’s been a 
rotten race for Germany mind, with no riders in the front group, and Greipel 
and Kittel marooned in the chasing pack. The Belgians are working well to shut 
down and contain Greipel at the head of that group too.
 
The Belgians lead a train at the front, with no real sign of the gap closing 
to the chasing pack – it’s still just over a minute. Now they’re on the 
seven-lap circuit Belgium can boss things from here, as they prove by just 
stepping up the pace a little to keep up that gap.
 
The leading group are now in The Pearl, approaching the finishing circuit. 
120km to go.
 
We’re back in more built-up territory now as the riders encounter at a couple 
of symbols of modern Qatar - a big stadium and a ring road. The leading group 
have an advantage of a minute and eight seconds over the next one. There’s 
123km to go. Boonen, Sagan and Cavendish in contention – Belgium in general in 
the box seat. Of the early breakaway group, the South African Dougall remains 
impressively up among the front-riders
 
Cavendish is riding well in the circumstances, it must be said, unfazed by the 
loss of team-mates (though Blythe is sticking to his task) and the dominance of 
the Belgians, who with six riders in the leading group continue to hold all the 
aces. A less than chuffed Kittel leads the second group, but it’ll be tough to 
make that ground now.
 
The chasing group, exposed and lacking team-assistance, look poorly placed to 
reel in the front runners now, especially against an unforgiving wind. Which 
means the riders in that early breakaway group, staying with the leaders, are 
still nicely positioned. For the British, Cavendish and Blythe are still on 
their own and likely to remain so.
 
The early breakaway group are caught, parting as Boonen leads the Belgian 
train right through the middle of them, with 144km to go. Sagan and Cavendish 
are still among the front group, as is Boasson-Hagen of Norway. It’s all gone a 
bit pear-shaped for Ireland’s Sam Bennett, who was riding strongly earlier but 
has now dropped right back, possibly suffering from a hand injury.

Tom Boonen has 22 stage wins in Qatar under his belt, and it is showing in 
both his and his team’s performance. Cavendish is still among them in the first 
chasing group, but shorn of all team-mates bar Rowe (unless the British riders 
in the second group can make serious ground), he faces a big uphill task now, 
though not literally, in the punishing, flat windswept desert. Scores on the 
doors now: 21 seconds from the leaders to group 1, who are a minute or so ahead 
of the second group.
 
Marcel Kittel is another expected contender who’s nowhere, straggling back in 
the peloton’s third group, as the race calms down a touch after the chaotic 
kerfuffling of a few kilometres back. Ramirez of Colombia and Lagkuti of 
Ukraine are the very front two in the race, but it’s almost game over for that 
first breakaway group, whose lead on the first group is now whittled down to 
under a minutes and a half.
 
Meanwhile Andre Greipel, quiet thus far, moves to the front of the second 
group in the peloton, but he’s some way off making his mark. The second group 
sits 40 seconds or so behind the first, who are closing on the leading group, 
which now has a lead of only two and a half minutes.
 
It’s all got very chaotic, including for the race organisers’ computer system, 
which is glitch-ridden and confusing the TV commentary team. There are only 
25-30 riders in this race now, with Blythe providing the assistance to 
Cavendish, but the Belgians remain compact and in control, while almost 
everyone else looks stressed and ragged.
 
Cavendish and Blythe are the only British riders together in that first group, 
in which Tom Boonen and Peter Sagan are now nicely placed. It’s going to be 
very tough for Cavendish now. More crash woe for Colombia, as Ramirez in the 
leading group skids off onto his backside as his front wheel appears to be 
lifted off the ground, suggesting the wind is getting up once more. 159km to go.
 
There are some actual spectators now – well, a couple of people with Spanish 
flags. In front of them they see a nasty little crash – the Australian 
Durbridge colliding with Mezgec of Slovenia and Gaviria of Colombia at the back 
of the second group in the peloton. The Belgian still in command at the front 
of the first group in the peloton, which is now under four minutes from the 
leaders.

All sorts going on now. The Belgians are pushing hard now at the head of the 
peloton, and it’s disrupted Britain’s strategy – Geraint Thomas and Luke Rowe 
have dropped right back, which will concern Cavendish. Sam Bennett, the Belgian 
born Irish rider, is battling gamely among the Belgians at the front of the 
peloton. Peter Sagan’s well in contention too – there’s 167km to go, and under 
five minutes separate the leading group from the rest. There are now two very 
distinct groups in the peloton.
 
We’re heading south again now, the road narrower, a tad more uneven looking, 
and taking its toll. The Netherlands’ Tom Dumoulin’s had to retreat for 
technical assistance, a possible flat tyre. The peloton is now properly 
fragmented and strung out, the British and Belgian riders still pushing 
strongly at its head. Caleb Ewan of Australia is struggling now, and has 
dropped right back. And there’s been a nasty little crash involving the 
American Marcotte, who’s one of three riders unseated.
 
The Belgian riders make a drive for the front of the peloton, but Britain’s 
Luke Rowe makes it to the very front of the pack as they make their first turn, 
Cavendish just behind him. The leading group are being reined in now, the gap 
down to 6:50. The first splits are beginning to emerge in the peloton, as the 
British team pile on the pressure. This is impressive stuff.
 
These are some of the straightest and flattest and frankly dullest roads 
you’ll see, but they’ll be turning soon, and the peleton has closed on the 
leading group to under eight minutes, with Corella of Mexico dropping back from 
it. The British team still look nicely placed at the front of the peloton.
 
A swirling sandstorm just misses the front of the peloton, in which the Dutch 
move up towards the front. The gap to the leading group is now just under nine 
minutes behind the leading group, but no significant movements as yet. 185km to 
go.
 
A little bit of jostling and jockeying in the peloton as they approach the 
turn back towards Doha, and the wind begins to pick up. Australia’s Renshaw and 
Ewan drop to the back for ice pack and cooling assistance before working their 
way wide on the left back into a congested pack. The absence of crowds or 
landmarks along the way lends a slightly odd atmosphere to proceedings. 190km 
to go.
 
Morning everyone. Welcome to live coverage of the men’s world road race. 
Essential technical maintenance work meant Guardian Towers had to turn the 
internet off and turn it on again overnight, which means you join us mid-race, 
but with still just under 200km or so to go in the searing heat in Qatar.

So what’s happening? The early breakaway was led by Ramirez of Colombia, 
Morocco’s Anass Ait el Abdia, Sergiy Lagkuti of Ukraine, Ryan Roth of Canada, 
Eritrea’s Natnael Berhane, Nick Dougall of South Africa, and the Mexican Rene 
Corella. The lead group is about 10 minutes ahead of the peloton, at the head 
of whichMark Cavendish <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/markcavendish> is 
being assiduously looked after by Steve Cummings, and his GB team-mates.

It looks mercilessly scorching out there, as they head towards the turn. I 
feel parched and weary just watching it, and I’m in rainy London.
