Take advantage of the water

Every summer the city creates “fake” beaches with huge plots of sand around 
the Seine and the Bassin de la Villette. Dubbed “Paris Plages 
<http://next.paris.fr/english/visit/flagship-events/paris-plages/rub_8208_stand_34146_port_18969>
”, this year it begins on 20 July and is open every day, free of charge, from 
9am to midnight. Activities (some of which you have to pay for) include 
volleyball, pedal boats, rowing, archery and street tennis. A similar idea is 
Les Berges de Seine, a stretch of the Left Bank between the bridges Pont 
Alexandre III and Pont du Carrousel that hosts a floating garden, outdoor bars, 
playgrounds, art installations and many free events, such as fitness classes 
and gardening workshops. To cool off, dive into one of Paris’s 39 public pools 
for a mere €3.
• Paris Plages, from 20 July-16 August, in front of the Hotel de Ville and on 
the Georges Pompidou expressway; from 20 July-23 August along the Bassin de la 
Villette. Les Berges de Seine covers the quay of the Left bank between bridges 
Pont Alexandre III and Pont du Carrousel

Eat and drink in Butte aux Cailles
 Chez Gladines 
The tight-knit community and colourful houses give a village feel to this 
southern neighbourhood in the 13th arrondissement. Home to many artists and a 
family-friendly haven for street art, Butte aux Cailles has many high-quality, 
but inexpensive, bars and restaurants. Dine on traditional French food at
l’Auberge de la Butte <http://www.aubergedelabutte.com/>, where €25 covers 
three courses. The legendaryChez Gladines <http://gladines-restaurant-paris.fr/>
 offers copious Basque dishes from €7-€10, but go before 7pm to avoid a long 
wait. Most bars along rue de la Butte aux Cailles are reasonably priced, such 
as the popular hangoutLe Diapason 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Diapason/422366761143509>, where glasses of 
wine are €4, pints are €5-€6 and cocktails are €6.50.

Finding souvenirs unique to Paris doesn’t have to be pricey: many tourists 
believe that theMarché aux puces de Saint-Ouen 
<http://www.marcheauxpuces-saintouen.com/1.aspx> is the headquarters of 
Parisian antiques but those in the know (and in the business) go to the Marché 
aux puces de la porte de Montreuil (on Avenue du Professeur André Lemierre) or
Vanves <http://pucesdevanves.typepad.com/> for art, furniture and vintage 
trinkets. Dealers often sell their goods cheaper at these two flea markets 
before raising the prices at Saint-Ouen. If strolling around the elite 
galleries of the Marais or Saint-Germain-des-Prés inspires you to invest in 
art, check out the squat59 Rivoli <http://www.59rivoli.org/main.html>, where 
artists work and sell their creations. Just walking up the spiral staircase 
covered with murals is a worthwhile experience.

rooms cost from €62 (it’s a bunk bed, though), while dorm-room berths start at

Paris can feel cramped and polluted during the summer. Seek refuge in either 
(or both!) of the two largest parks in Paris: theBois de Vincennes 
<http://www.paris.fr/jardins> is beautifully designed around a lake with a 
pseudo-Greek temple on one island and a Buddhist temple on another. The other 
park is theBois de Boulogne <http://www.paris.fr/jardins> and, at more than 
double the size of Central Park in Manhattan, it feels more like a forest. It 
has an adult fitness playground, two horse-racing tracks (Hippodrome de 
Longchamp

 andHippodrome d’Auteuil

Paris is not usually known for its sangria but 10 Bar <http://www.lebar10.com/>
 is famous with students and regulars of the 6th arrondissement for its €3 
drinks and (working) jukebox. After a few glasses, join the people who flock to 
Quai Saint-Bernard in the neighbouring 5th arrondissement to enjoy salsa, 
swing, tango, traditional French folk dances and more at theFestival des danses 
sur Seine 
<http://www.parisinfo.com/sortie-paris/83096/Festival-des-danses-sur-Seine-Quai-Saint-Bernard>
. Entry is free; you simply wander on to the quai on any night during July and 
August. If it’s raining, opt for live music atLe Truskel 
<http://www.truskel.com/>, an innocuous-looking bar, on Rue Feydeau, known for 
its free concerts starring musicians before they get famous; Pete Doherty, 
Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party and Metronomy all played here. A pint costs €6.

Seine 54, +33 1 46 33 35 36) makes fresh salads, soups and sandwiches (from 
€6.50) while opera music plays in the background. All its bread is made before 
your eyes in a brick oven. In the Marais, try theMarché des Enfants Rouges 
<http://marchedesenfantsrougesfr.com/> on Rue de Bretagne; it’s Paris’s oldest 
market, where delicacies from all over the world share space with French 
produce. The Moroccan stand boasts some of the best tagine in the city for 
about €10.50.

 Easy for you to say … the château at Sceaux. Photograph: Alamy 
If you can’t afford a journey to the south of France, the Parisian commuter 
rail, theRER <http://parisbytrain.com/paris-rer/>, travels to many towns that 
have great village vibes. The RER A goes from Paris’s central station Châtelet 
to the cobblestone streets ofSaint-Germain-en-Laye 
<http://www.saintgermainenlaye.eu/en/> in about 40 minutes, where a château 
with huge grounds and a vineyard await. A return ticket costs €8.70 and a visit 
to the château, now an archeology museum (Musée d’Archéologie nationale 
<http://musee-archeologienationale.fr/>), is €7. A €5.50 return, and a 
30-minute ride from Châtelet on the RER B heading south, will get you to 
Sceaux, where you’ll discover another château with guided visits for €6. Its 
grounds, theParc de Sceaux 
<http://domaine-de-sceaux.hauts-de-seine.net/informations-pratiques/acces-horaires-et-tarifs/>
, are free to visit and were designed by Le Nôtre, who was the landscaper of
