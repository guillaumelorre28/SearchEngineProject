FESTIVAL HIGHLIGHTS

There are over 5½ square miles of desert turned over as a blank canvas and 
filled with all manner of incredible art, weird and wonderful people to watch 
and events and workshops to try … There are far too many to list here but here 
are some of the stand-out festival sights.

Fancy a ride on a giant mechanical snail? How about a duck or unicorn? Just 
smile and ask if you can climb on board. “Art cars” are one of the most 
exciting parts of Burning Man. Hundreds of huge pimped-up vehicles roam the 
site, lights flashing, picking up strangers and taking them on a journey, often 
offering free drinks and a sound system. We went on a 3am trip to the loos and 
ended up dancing on a huge “Dancesaurus” bus and watching the sun come up as 
hundreds of revellers raised their hands up below. Another memorable art car 
was the giant polar bear, seemingly populated by dozens of off-duty models all 
dressed in white.

Of course, everyone at Burning Man is an individual, but dressing trends and 
tribes have developed over the years. The place has its own characters and 
lingo, which you soon pick up thanks to chatting and reading the festival’s 
daily newspaper. You can spot a “Sparkle pony” by her rainbow dreads, platforms 
and preening, while you will certainly have the dubious opportunity to see 
several “shirtcockers”, men who sport a shirt and nothing else. “Yoga bunnies” 
(often Californian) hang out in the main village, their impossibly toned and 
tanned bodies silently contorting into ever more impossible shapes.

Burning Man attracts a huge number of creative people who are willing to put 
months of work into temporary installations. Some can really take your breath 
away: not just because of the talent on show but also the commitment to 
constructions that will often only exist for a week. We saw everything from 
pirate ships to huge mechanical hyenas – this year Burners can feast their eyes 
on a camel train of giant tea pots and play on musical swings.Click here to see

Browsing through the doorstop-thick programme for Burning Man events in 
individual camps, you could be forgiven for mistaking it for an elaborate joke. 
Alongside all manner of meditation and yoga there’s spanking classes, orgies, 
group masturbation and naked foam parties, plus many events to support the 
tradition of Tutu Tuesday (embraced by both sexes) and the more recent Fishnet 
Friday. We gave the adult zone a wide berth but still found ourselves in “Ass 
Stamp Camp”, where free shots are cheerfully dispensed in return for a quick 
rubber stamp on the behind. That’s the only kind of branding you’ll see at 
Burning Man.

The crescendo of the week is, without doubt, the final Saturday’s Burn. For 
the duration of the event the Man himself looms over the site, a huge structure 
which takes a different form every year. Last year he was an alien on a huge 
wooden spaceship, adding to the already surreal atmosphere. Festival-goers 
gathered to watch the ceremonial burn as fireworks and flame throwers circled 
him. Many attendees attach a great deal of meaning to the festival’s climax: it 
supports the “leave no trace” mantra and has spiritual significance to some. 
Even as a mere spectacle, it’s absolutely breathtaking and a fitting finale for 
a strange, immense and unforgettable event.

This is the Nevada desert, so you will need sunscreen, a hat, loose clothing 
and as much crazy fancy dress as you can cram into your luggage – literally 
anything goes here, including no dress at all. Nights can be chillier so fake 
fur coats are a good bet. Take food, gallons of water, and goggles, which at 
least half the “Burners” wear – you will be glad of them in a dust storm. Think 
steampunk rather than scuba. Plus lip balm, moisturiser and so on. Many go 
make-up free by day but glam up at night – face paints for both sexes are 
common. Battery-operated torches/LED head torches, fairy lights and anything 
illuminated (although glowsticks are discouraged) are a must for safely getting 
around at night – with no street lamps and a lot of bicycles, you’ll want to 
cover your ride and/or yourself. Everyone carries a portable cup and brings 
plastic bowls/cutlery as nothing is disposable in this leave-no-trace city.

What not to pack

One thing you won’t need when you get to Burning Man is cash. One of the best 
things about this event is the lack of commercialism: no sponsorship, no 
branding, no trading stalls and no money changing hands, the one exception 
being coffee and tea in the central main village. Strangers will offer you 
alcohol (bring ID, this is America) and, if you are lucky, food. Don’t rely on 
the latter though. Your mobile phone will be useless to you here, but there is 
an emergency message board, so make sure your relatives have the details for 
that, and then … relax.

What to give away

There’s a common myth that Burning Man works on a bartering system. In fact, 
it’s a “gifting” culture. Last year I was wandering through the desert, 
wondering why I hadn’t packed anything to drink for the walk, and a nice man in 
a spacesuit appeared and gave me an ice-cold beer from his space pack. I was 
also “gifted” jewellery, bottle openers, cups … many specially crafted with the 
BM logo. One girl read me a cute hippy poem and gave it to me afterwards on a 
laminated card. Bring what you like, but leave your cynicism at the gate. 
Burning Man has a way of eradicating it if you don’t.

Stop off in Walmart or similar on the way and buy a cheap bike for under $100. 
Unless you intend to stay very local to your camp (which is a bit boring), this 
will be essential for getting around the huge site, which is over 5½ square 
miles in a 97,000-square-mile desert. Decorate it in a unique fashion, and make 
sure you lock it to prevent drunk revellers from helping themselves, which does 
happen occasionally. There are numerous charities who will take unused Burning 
Man bikes after the event, or you may find a friendly local who will make you 
an offer on the way home.

Burning Man is made up of thousands of colourful theme camps with residents 
who hold parties and give out freebies of their choice. Unless you have already 
registered with an official camp well in advance with very creative and 
organised pals, make sure you sign up to your regional Burning Man newsletter 
and keep an eye out for themed camps looking for residents. Most charge a 
reasonable fee to cover costs for food and water, and will expect you to pitch 
in and help out. Alternatively, you can go it alone, but the official camps 
tend to have better locations and atmosphere. Our RV gang joined a group of 
Scottish flame-throwers, who tied sheets to our roof and their van, which gave 
their tents underneath some shade. They threw a great English Garden Party 
which was well attended by passers-by.

The site is based on a supposedly simple navigational system that proves 
complicated to some, so make sure you study a map before you go, then you might 
just be able to find that Ashtanga yoga class/couples’ healing workshop/70s 
disco pants party you’ve spotted in the programme. Most groups of friends have 
a naturally-appointed leader who has got their head round this – lose them at 
your peril, but don’t sweat it too much. With the right attitude, strangers 
will take you in – though lone women should take the usual precautions.

You will get much more out of Burning Man if you are open to smiling at and 
speaking to strangers. With the best will in the world, this can become quite a 
challenge when you are over-heating, dehydrated and underslept, so try to look 
after yourself as much as possible and know when you need to take yourself off 
to a shady corner. The harsh, surreal environment can do funny things to the 
chirpiest person’s moods, and the best thing to do is to accept it. One minute 
Burning Man is the best place in the world, the next it can feel like the worst 
– but the best is always around the corner again.

The desert’s dry ground can play havoc with your feet. Brave sorts wear flip 
flops and generally obtain what is called “playa foot” (you don’t want to 
know). Your best bet is to cover your feet completely with trainers and make 
sure you have several pairs with you. Many people go for basketball boots but I 
found these took way too long to slip on and off (get your RV too muddy and you 
can kiss goodbye to your hefty deposit). Your challenge is to make your 
footwear look cool: Sparkle Ponies (see above) favour customised 
rainbow-coloured platform knee-high boots, but they do have to walk rather 
gingerly.

There are no bands! At least, not officially. Big names have been known to 
drop by for surprise gigs on their own dollar, and there are open-mic sessions 
in the main village. If you’re the kind of person who goes to a music festival 
more for the creative arty sideshows, you will be in heaven in Black Rock City, 
especially when the sun goes down and the weird and wonderful neon-lit 
constructions start beckoning. Sound systems and DJs are good and plentiful so 
you will never be short of somewhere to dance, whether it’s on top of a radio 
tower or in a pop-up chapel made of twigs.

Getting there

Most Burners fly into either Reno or San Francisco and hire an RV for a scenic 
drive to the event, often with an overnight stop over in Lake Tahoe or, less 
attractively, a Reno casino hotel. Sleeping in a tent at Burning Man can be 
even hotter than in a vehicle, so if you can afford the admittedly extortionate 
rates the RV companies charge, then go for it. They all charge extra for 
Burning Man – expect to pay over £2,000 for a six person RV. Bear in mind that 
an RV officially sleeping six may only sleep four in comfort. Avoid using air 
con and showers, though as Burning Man is a fiercely eco event.
