“It seems only natural to me to present my men’s and women’s collections 
together. It’s the way I see the world,” creative director Alessandro Michele 
said. “I believe it will give me the chance to move towards a different kind of 
approach to my storytelling.” Michele has been creative director since January 
2015 and has used models of both genders in his shows as well as the label’sad 
campaigns

As well as this move towards gender neutrality, Gucci 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> cited reasons of economic 
streamlining. “Moving to one show each season will significantly help to 
simplify many aspects of our business. Maintaining two separate, disconnected 
calendars has been a result of tradition rather than practicality,” said chief 
executive of the brand Marco Bizzarri. The first show of this kind is expected 
to take place at Gucci’s new headquarters in Via Mecenate, Milan, in 2017.

The move comes in the wake of Burberry, Tom Ford and Vetements moving towards 
a one show-per-season policy, and just a day afterAnthony Vaccarello 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/04/versus-anthony-vaccarello-move-versace-saint-laurent-fashion>
 was announced as the new creative director of Saint Laurent.
