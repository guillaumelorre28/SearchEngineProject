Having whisked egg whites to starch their habits, Portuguese nuns and monks 
employed the attendant surfeit of yolks to concoct rich, sugary conventual 
pastries. The highly fashionable flake-fest that is Portugal’s iconicpastel de 
nata was first baked some time before the 18th century at Jerónimos Monastery 
in Santa Maria de Belém (Bethlehem), just outside Lisbon. But swerve the 
wide-eyed, full-trousered tourists at the famousPastéis de Belém 
<http://www.pasteisdebelem.pt/> and feed your nata addiction at A Chique de 
Belém <http://achiquedebelem.pt/pt>, where the puffy massa folhada pastry in 
your pastel is melt-in-the-mouth buttery with a crisp, fragile, deeply-tanned 
skin, and a scorch-mottled top under which lies two bites of heavenly, sinfully 
suave custard. Those in the know, though, make the pilgrimage north towards the 
surfy seaside village of Nazaré. Nearby is pretty, sleepy Alcobaça, whose
Pasteleria Alcôa <http://www.pastelaria-alcoa.com/>’s pastries won first prize 
at this year’s all-Portugal pastel contest.
