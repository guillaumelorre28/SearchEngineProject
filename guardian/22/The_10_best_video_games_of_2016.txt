1 Uncharted 4 
(Naughty Dog; PlayStation 4)

In some ways, the fourth title in Naughty Dog’s wildly successful action 
adventure series looks like the archetypal join-the-dots sequel. We’re still 
following roguishNathan Drake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/07/nathan-drake-uncharted-4-naughty-dog>
 as he scours the planet for ancient artefacts. We’re still solving simple 
environmental puzzles and shooting the bad guys. And the script still plunders 
just about every cliche it can from the Indiana Jones films.

But that’s only part of the story. This wonderfully entertaining game is 
effectively about marriage – or, more accurately, the things we have to learn 
about ourselves to maintain long-term relationships. Nathan lies to his partner 
Elena and leans heavily on his friend Sully, but has to learn to be less 
selfish and irresponsible – a lesson made all the more urgent and poignant by 
the arrival of his troubled brother, Sam. That a big popcorn blockbuster is 
exploring these themes so engagingly and movingly is a testament to how this 
medium has matured over the last five years.

Meanwhile, we also get everything we want from a lavish big-budget game: 
astonishing visuals, imaginative locations and some truly thrilling set pieces 
– the Madagascan marketplace scene is a classic. Even if you don’t fall for the 
love story, you’ll fall for the well-paced, well-engineered action – and if the 
ending doesn’t get you right in the gut, you’re not human.Read the review

Sure, many players tired of this slight, stripped-down Pokémon adventure after 
the first glorious fortnight. But its brilliance lay in how it used augmented 
reality and location-based technology to captivate not just early-adopter 
geeks, but whole families. Wandering through towns and parks looking for

 Personal discovery … Firewatch. Photograph: Publicity image 
With beautiful visuals and a haunting story of personal discovery, Firewatch 
was one of the year’s most fascinating experimental titles. Lead character 
Henry has escaped a difficult life to watch for fires in the Wyoming 
wilderness, but while he’s investigating odd events in the woods, the real 
focus of the narrative is his relationship with radio operator Delilah. Using 
the conventions of an open-world adventure, developer Campo Santo produces 
something much more haunting, unusual and important.Read the review

 Thoughtful … Inside. Photograph: Playdead Games 
Danish developer Playdead attracted massive critical acclaim in 2010 for its 
moody, monochrome adventureLimbo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/01/limbo-xbla-microsoft-playdead-studios>
. This spiritual successor is, if anything, even more sombre and impressive, 
set in a dark, Orwellian dystopia where people are mere cogs in an unknowable 
machine – that is, until one small boy makes a dramatic bid for escape. 
Employing the mechanics of a 2D platformer, Inside is something much more 
profound, offering a thoughtful fable as well as a diverting challenge.Read the

 Gruesome … Dark Souls 3. Photograph: Namco Bandai 
Set in the same gloomy, hostile universe as its predecessors, the third title 
in FromSoftware’s uncompromising trilogy offers a new combat mechanic, a 
gruesome menagerie of enemies and a fresh, trap-laden environment to stumble, 
slay and suffer through. What still impresses about this series is the purity 
and steadfastness of its vision – in a world where big games now more or less 
handhold you through the entire campaign, Dark Souls 3 treats its players as 
equals, a considerable compliment.Read the review

 Compelling … Overwatch. Photograph: Alex Hern for the Guardian 
It’s been a long time since a new shooter came along and blew the whole market 
apart – but with its diverse characters, super-bright visuals and compelling 
cooperative tactics, that’s what Overwatch did. Blizzard’s interactive comic 
book movie completely re-engineers the concept of the team-based video game, 
requiring players to think about their roles, really learn their individual 
capabilities and then get stuck in for their compatriots. Some people played 
nothing else all year. Maybe they had the right idea.Read a review

Driving sims are a mainstay of the industry, but it’s rare they’re considered 
game-of-the-year contenders. The latest title in Microsoft’s Forza series is up 
there, however. Graphically, it may be one of the generation’s most impressive 
titles so far – capturing a variety of Australian landscapes with care and 
craft. But it’s the raw speed and excitement of the many trials, races and 
challenges that really impress. Who needs to watchThe Grand Tour
