Thank you for all your questions, serious and frivolous. Forgive me for not 
answering them all. This was rather like the kind of exam one has nightmares 
about: an infinite number of questions, some of them quite clearly 
unanswerable. As this is the Guardian, I have no doubt I have failed the exam.

In your opinion, what did Marx get wrong (or right) about the historical 
development of capitalism?

I used to say that I was a Marxist, except that I was on the side of the 
bourgeoisie. To be serious, Marx's big mistake in trying to marry Hegel to 
Ricardo was to believe in the inexorable polarisation of wealth distribution. 
He was sure the proletariat would just keep getting crushed and failed to 
foresee that capitalism would require workers also to be consumers. The idea of 
inexorable widening inequality continues to fascinate - hence the popularity of 
Thomas Piketty's equally wrong book.

'American-led intervention can be an effective way of ending war'

Chris2131 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12788711> asks:

Recent western intervention in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya has been 
unsuccessful. But Collier in ‘The Bottom Billion’ and Acemoglu & Robinson’s in 
‘Why Nations Fail’ indicate that the west needs to intervene in the failing 
states to free the powerless from the kleptocracies that rule them. Do you 
think the west just needs to get better at intervention (Operation Palliser 
worked in Sierra Leone), or abandon it and accept greater migration flows? Or 
some alternative?

Many people are making the mistake of thinking that because Iraq went wrong, 
all interventions are bound to go wrong. I think this was president Obama's 
view and explains his reluctance to intervene in Syria until it was much too 
late. But we know from the experience of the former Yugoslavia that 
American-led intervention can be an effective way of ending war. The recent 
French intervention in Mali was highly successful in preventing a jihadist 
takeover of that country. So we need to have a more nuanced view of the recent 
past.

'What we see now in the Middle East is that there is something worse than 
empire. That something is anarchy.'


Philip J Sparrow <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10671162> asks:

Regarding the Middle East, can you think of any examples throughout history 
whereby a foreign state has successfully imposed a form of government and rule 
of law on another state which has then been fully embraced? Can you force a 
population that doesn’t believe in freedom and democracy to be free and vote?

The Ottoman empire imposed its form of government and law on most of the 
Middle East for rather a long time. My point has been for some time now that 
the United States has the utmost difficulty in acting as an effective empire 
because its founding ideology is anti-imperial. What we see now in the Middle 
East is that there is something worse than empire. That something is anarchy. 
The complete breakdown of political structures is a reminder that the pursuit 
of freedom and democracy, noble though those ideals are, can end disastrously 
when circumstances are simply not propitious. That is the tragedy of the 
so-called Arab Spring.

‘What if’ history is often maligned, but can we truly grasp how important an

The answer is that we cannot. Those who disparage counterfactual or virtual 
history have failed to grasp a very essential point about the philosophy of 
history. Kissinger himself echoed Lewis Namier that what did not happen in 
history is as important as what did happen. At the point of decision a 
president or prime minister cannot know the future. Decisions are based on 
multiple possible futures. If all we look at is the decision that was taken and 
its proximate consequences we shall lose that sense of uncertainty that is so 
central to the human experience. Some historians imply counterfactuals. I think 
it is better to make them explicit.

I wish I could lead such a regimented life. I fit writing in around all the 
other things that I do: teaching, webchatting, playing with my youngest son... 
One of the things I have learned over the years is to be able to research and 
write in all and any circumstances, including in the back of a minivan with a 
film crew. In fact it may even help me to survive life's many challenges that I 
can be thinking about a book while standing in lines at airport security.

You really need to read this book about Kissinger before you express opinions 
like these. I certainly have never "shrugged my shoulders" about atrocities of 
any sort.

'Kissinger saw much more clearly than his critics on the left the cruelties of 
communism'

PoliticalUmpire <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2477263> asks:

Wasn’t the basic problem that Bob MacNamara, HK and others the same as the 
Marine Colonel in Full Metal Jacket - “we are fighting this war because inside 
every gook, there is an American, trying to get out”? Which, incidentally, was 
the view Blair had about Iraq and Afghanistan, and Cameron about Libya, and the 
liberal left have about mass immigration (which they assure us will present no 
issues whatever about integration/assimilation).

The interesting point about Kissinger was that when he went to Vietnam for the 
first time in 1965 he understood very quickly just what was going wrong. He 
certainly was not like Graham Greene's Quiet American. Kissinger was rather 
favourably impressed by the Vietnamese he met, though he realised there was 
something chronically wrong with the South Vietnamese political system. He 
reserved his most scathing criticism for the American military, particularly 
those at the top, who wholly misunderstood the nature of the war they were 
fighting. Kissinger saw much more clearly than his critics on the left the 
cruelties of communism, and was sincere in his desire to check the spread of 
communist rule, in Asia and elsewhere. But he did not imagine that it would be 
possible to turn countries like South Vietnam into miniature replicas of the 
United States.

I will leave aside the points you make here about Messrs Blair and Cameron, 
not to mention mass immigration.

My early assessment in May 2010 was that the Conservatives would suck the 
lifeblood out of the Liberal Democrats and leave them a desiccated carcass in 
the gutter. That proved to be correct.

My perfect Sunday would centre around a leisurely and rather bibulous lunch 
attended by my four children, my wife, my mother and at least three of my best 
friends. After the lunch I would go paddleboarding on a salt water pond. And 
after the paddle I would be transported magically to one of the world's great 
opera houses, to hear a performance of one of Verdi's operas. Alternatively I 
would be transported by the same magic to see Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur by 
at least three goals to nil.

I think both Obama and his predecessor approached foreign policy in general 
and the Middle East in particular with far too little historical knowledge. 
Putin's recent successes are not the worst consequence of their historical 
ignorance. Both Bush and Obama gravely underestimated the potential for 
sectarian conflict to escalate. Both underestimated the fragility of states 
like Iraq and Syria. There was a naive belief that if we toppled the dictators 
a brave new era of Middle Eastern democracy would begin.

I wish it could be possible to make history a far more central part of the 
education of western leaders. We need to work much harder as historians to 
challenge the dominance of subjects like economics, political science and law 
in elite education.

How many “research assistants’’ do you employ when writing your books?

A great mythology has sprung up that I have a small factory full of enslaved 
researchers. This may be because I am over-generous when I write the 
acknowledgements to my books. In the case of Kissinger, I had one full time 
researcher, Jason Rockett, whose job it was to gather the material from the 
many archives that had relevant source documents. I got quite a few 
undergraduates to help proof-read digitised documents to make sure that there 
were no errors in the database, but this was a part time assistance that was 
marginally more interesting than stacking supermarket shelves. By and large, I 
like to work with one trustworthy and experienced researcher. But the reading, 
thinking, interpretation and writing I do on my own. By the way, this is not 
because I dislike archives. The problem is that as a tenured professor, I am 
tied down with teaching and other responsibilities. Jason's job was to be in 
the archives while I was in the classroom.

The skill that is least well taught at schools today is essay writing. I would 
urge anyone studying A Level history to read some of the great historical 
essayists of the previous generation - for example, AJP Taylor and his arch 
enemy, Hugh Trevor-Roper. Even reading Taylor's old book reviews will help 
sharpen your writing style.

'The US is capable of reforming its dysfunctional political institutions and

hazh <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2502285> asks: 

How do you see the world within the next 50 years? Will it be a world 
dominated by a rising Chinese power over a weakening American one, can Europe 
become dominant power, or is the west now in terminal decline?

There is no such thing as the future, singular, only multiple futures. 
Historians are not clairvoyants so all I can offer you are some plausible 
scenarios. Although it is clear to me that the west and especially Europe have 
experienced and will likely continue to experience relative decline in economic 
and geopolitical terms, there is no guarantee that China will not stumble. The 
internal problems of the People's Republic are daunting. Meanwhile, as I argued 
in the The Great Degeneration, the United States is capable of reforming its 
currently dysfunctional political institutions and culture, and I would not be 
surprised to see a significant American revival within the next ten years, 
never mind the next fifty. The next president will have to work much more 
effectively with Congress to address the country's fiscal imbalances, tangle of 
regulation, chronic rule of lawyers, and erosion of civil society. We saw in 
the 1980s that strong presidential leadership can achieve great things. I hope 
we can see that once again.

I do not know which "critics" you are referring to. I think you may mean one 
reviewer who was cross that I did not cite his book. As for the accusation of 
hagiography, no-one who reads my book could possibly say that. The book is 
often critical, but above all, it aims to be an historically accurate account 
of Kissinger's early life based on tens of thousands of pages of documents from 
50 archives.

There is an unhealthy tendency to try to discredit my work as an historian by 
endlessly focusing on the much less important things that I have said or 
written on political issues. I suppose this is because it is easier to Google 
old journalism than to read long and carefully researched books. My simple 
advice is to read the books and base your judgement on them.

In light of the upcoming EU referendum I would like to ask about your position 
regarding British membership. You stated in your work on Civilisation that one 
of the deciding factors in the west’s rise was the competition and subsequent 
innovation fuelled by small, warring European states. Now that we find 
ourselves in the age of the monolith - with the rise of China, India and Brazil 
- where ideas and innovations cross the globe instantaneously, is it not time 
for the UK to recognise that its relevance and ability to compete in this 
coming age is dependent on being at the centre of another vast economic block, 
namely the EU?

Although I was a strong opponent of monetary union, I have never argued for 
Britain to withdraw from the EU itself. So I very much hope that the referendum 
will give a clear victory to In over Out. But this is not because I visualise a 
world of giant economic blocs. From my vantage point, the biggest success of 
British policy in Europe was to shift the EU away from protectionism and 
towards freer trade.

Thank you for all your questions, serious and frivolous. Forgive me for not 
answering them all. This was rather like the kind of exam one has nightmares 
about: an infinite number of questions, some of them quite clearly 
unanswerable. As this is the Guardian, I have no doubt I have failed the exam.

In your opinion, what did Marx get wrong (or right) about the historical

I used to say that I was a Marxist, except that I was on the side of the 
bourgeoisie. To be serious, Marx's big mistake in trying to marry Hegel to 
Ricardo was to believe in the inexorable polarisation of wealth distribution. 
He was sure the proletariat would just keep getting crushed and failed to 
foresee that capitalism would require workers also to be consumers. The idea of 
inexorable widening inequality continues to fascinate - hence the popularity of 
Thomas Piketty's equally wrong book.

Recent western intervention in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya has been 
unsuccessful. But Collier in ‘The Bottom Billion’ and Acemoglu & Robinson’s in 
‘Why Nations Fail’ indicate that the west needs to intervene in the failing 
states to free the powerless from the kleptocracies that rule them. Do you 
think the west just needs to get better at intervention (Operation Palliser 
worked in Sierra Leone), or abandon it and accept greater migration flows? Or 
some alternative?

Many people are making the mistake of thinking that because Iraq went wrong, 
all interventions are bound to go wrong. I think this was president Obama's 
view and explains his reluctance to intervene in Syria until it was much too 
late. But we know from the experience of the former Yugoslavia that 
American-led intervention can be an effective way of ending war. The recent 
French intervention in Mali was highly successful in preventing a jihadist 
takeover of that country. So we need to have a more nuanced view of the recent 
past.

Regarding the Middle East, can you think of any examples throughout history

The Ottoman empire imposed its form of government and law on most of the 
Middle East for rather a long time. My point has been for some time now that 
the United States has the utmost difficulty in acting as an effective empire 
because its founding ideology is anti-imperial. What we see now in the Middle 
East is that there is something worse than empire. That something is anarchy. 
The complete breakdown of political structures is a reminder that the pursuit 
of freedom and democracy, noble though those ideals are, can end disastrously 
when circumstances are simply not propitious. That is the tragedy of the 
so-called Arab Spring.

The answer is that we cannot. Those who disparage counterfactual or virtual 
history have failed to grasp a very essential point about the philosophy of 
history. Kissinger himself echoed Lewis Namier that what did not happen in 
history is as important as what did happen. At the point of decision a 
president or prime minister cannot know the future. Decisions are based on 
multiple possible futures. If all we look at is the decision that was taken and 
its proximate consequences we shall lose that sense of uncertainty that is so 
central to the human experience. Some historians imply counterfactuals. I think 
it is better to make them explicit.

One of the things I have learned over the years is to be able to research and

can be thinking about a book while standing in lines at airport security.

liberal left have about mass immigration (which they assure us will present no 
issues whatever about integration/assimilation).

The interesting point about Kissinger was that when he went to Vietnam for the 
first time in 1965 he understood very quickly just what was going wrong. He 
certainly was not like Graham Greene's Quiet American. Kissinger was rather 
favourably impressed by the Vietnamese he met, though he realised there was 
something chronically wrong with the South Vietnamese political system. He 
reserved his most scathing criticism for the American military, particularly 
those at the top, who wholly misunderstood the nature of the war they were 
fighting. Kissinger saw much more clearly than his critics on the left the 
cruelties of communism, and was sincere in his desire to check the spread of 
communist rule, in Asia and elsewhere. But he did not imagine that it would be 
possible to turn countries like South Vietnam into miniature replicas of the 
United States.

I will leave aside the points you make here about Messrs Blair and Cameron, 
not to mention mass immigration.

My perfect Sunday would centre around a leisurely and rather bibulous lunch 
attended by my four children, my wife, my mother and at least three of my best 
friends. After the lunch I would go paddleboarding on a salt water pond. And 
after the paddle I would be transported magically to one of the world's great

would be transported by the same magic to see Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur by 
at least three goals to nil.

I think both Obama and his predecessor approached foreign policy in general 
and the Middle East in particular with far too little historical knowledge. 
Putin's recent successes are not the worst consequence of their historical 
ignorance. Both Bush and Obama gravely underestimated the potential for 
sectarian conflict to escalate. Both underestimated the fragility of states 
like Iraq and Syria. There was a naive belief that if we toppled the dictators 
a brave new era of Middle Eastern democracy would begin.

I wish it could be possible to make history a far more central part of the 
education of western leaders. We need to work much harder as historians to 
challenge the dominance of subjects like economics, political science and law 
in elite education.

A great mythology has sprung up that I have a small factory full of enslaved 
researchers. This may be because I am over-generous when I write the 
acknowledgements to my books. In the case of Kissinger, I had one full time 
researcher, Jason Rockett, whose job it was to gather the material from the 
many archives that had relevant source documents. I got quite a few 
undergraduates to help proof-read digitised documents to make sure that there 
were no errors in the database, but this was a part time assistance that was 
marginally more interesting than stacking supermarket shelves. By and large, I 
like to work with one trustworthy and experienced researcher. But the reading, 
thinking, interpretation and writing I do on my own. By the way, this is not 
because I dislike archives. The problem is that as a tenured professor, I am 
tied down with teaching and other responsibilities. Jason's job was to be in 
the archives while I was in the classroom.

The skill that is least well taught at schools today is essay writing. I would

There is no such thing as the future, singular, only multiple futures. 
Historians are not clairvoyants so all I can offer you are some plausible 
scenarios. Although it is clear to me that the west and especially Europe have 
experienced and will likely continue to experience relative decline in economic 
and geopolitical terms, there is no guarantee that China will not stumble. The 
internal problems of the People's Republic are daunting. Meanwhile, as I argued 
in the The Great Degeneration, the United States is capable of reforming its 
currently dysfunctional political institutions and culture, and I would not be 
surprised to see a significant American revival within the next ten years, 
never mind the next fifty. The next president will have to work much more 
effectively with Congress to address the country's fiscal imbalances, tangle of 
regulation, chronic rule of lawyers, and erosion of civil society. We saw in 
the 1980s that strong presidential leadership can achieve great things. I hope 
we can see that once again.

I do not know which "critics" you are referring to. I think you may mean one 
reviewer who was cross that I did not cite his book. As for the accusation of 
hagiography, no-one who reads my book could possibly say that. The book is 
often critical, but above all, it aims to be an historically accurate account 
of Kissinger's early life based on tens of thousands of pages of documents from 
50 archives.

There is an unhealthy tendency to try to discredit my work as an historian by 
endlessly focusing on the much less important things that I have said or 
written on political issues. I suppose this is because it is easier to Google 
old journalism than to read long and carefully researched books. My simple

In light of the upcoming EU referendum I would like to ask about your position

of the deciding factors in the west’s rise was the competition and subsequent 
innovation fuelled by small, warring European states. Now that we find 
ourselves in the age of the monolith - with the rise of China, India and Brazil 
- where ideas and innovations cross the globe instantaneously, is it not time

namely the EU?

Although I was a strong opponent of monetary union, I have never argued for 
Britain to withdraw from the EU itself. So I very much hope that the referendum 
will give a clear victory to In over Out. But this is not because I visualise a 
world of giant economic blocs. From my vantage point, the biggest success of 
British policy in Europe was to shift the EU away from protectionism and 
towards freer trade.
