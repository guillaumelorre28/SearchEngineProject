When an attempted coup rocked Burundi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/burundi> last year, Jean Baptiste Bireha was 
one of the few journalists to report the news. The next night, members of the 
Imbonerakure, the feared militarised youth wing of Burundi’s ruling party, 
turned up at his house looking for him.


But Bireha was already gone. Tipped off by a government source, he was on the 
run. “I never slept in the house again,” Bireha said. “Every independent 
journalist was wanted after the coup.”

A week later, according to Bireha, he was walking with a friend in the 
capital, Bujumbura, when presidential guards opened fire. They injured Bireha 
and killed his friend, he says. Soon after, he fled across the border toRwanda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/rwanda> in disguise.

Many other journalists followed him to escape mounting violence and 
repression. To fill the news void, Bireha, who resettled in Kigali, banded 
together with other exiled journalists to formRadio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio> Inzamba – an online, independent 
radio station-in-exile distributing broadcasts to those back home through 
Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.

Using a network of informants to report and verify their stories, Inzamba 
sends vital information to those back in Burundi as well as bringing 
international attention to what some say are rising incidents of killings by 
police and intelligence agents.

The country has been in the grip of 18 months of ongoing political violence 
following a controversial bid by the president,Pierre Nkurunziza 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/burundi-pierre-nkurunziza-police-protest-crack-down>
, for a third term in office in contravention of the country’s constitution.

In the run-up to the contentious election, the failed coup attempt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/15/burundi-army-dead-radio-station-battle-coup-leaders-arrested>
 triggered an intense crackdown on independent media, with government forces 
destroying radio towers and storming TV studios.

Nkurunziza later won the election and journalists and activists suspected of 
sympathising with the opposition were immediately targeted as the regime sought 
to consolidate its power.

Thierry Vircoulon, the Central African project director at International 
Crisis Group, said the media landscape has been crushed: religious and 
commercial radios are the last non-government antennas standing.

“Mobile phones and social media maintain a link between many of Burundi’s 
constituent parts that appear steadily more remote and disconnected: the 
diaspora and the refugee camps, capital city and rural areas, Burundi and the 
rest of the world,” Vircoulon said.

Patrick Mitabaro, an Inzamba journalist and the former editor at Radio 
Isanganiro, remains defiant in the face of government censorship. “By shutting 
down independent radio stations, Nkurunziza thought he had been able to 
suppress the truth,” he said. “But in this modern era, with social media 
platforms all over, he got it wrong.”


Although the reach of outlets like Inzamba and fellow broadcaster SOS Burundi 
<https://twitter.com/sosmediasbdi?lang=en> is hard to measure, Francois 
Bizimana, an Inzamba journalist, says the station has “a big following within 
the government and army, because everyone wants to know what is happening, or 
who has been killed”.

Mercy, a student at the University of Bujumbura who did not reveal her full 
name, said her brother was arrested by the government and taken to military 
headquarters in September last year. For weeks, the family did not know where 
he was, or if he was alive, until Radio Inzamba released a report that he had 
been tortured to death in the office of national intelligence and his body 
dumped in a hospital.

“After visiting the hospital mortuary, we found the body and it was marked 
unknown, even though his killers knew him,” Mercy said.

The station has also reported widely on mass graves in Burundi, disclosing the 
precise locations and identities of people buried and those allegedly 
responsible for the killings.

‘We use codes’

The ruling party in Burundi views Inzamba radio as anti-government, backed and 
encouraged by Rwanda, which Nkurunziza accuses of training rebels that have 
vowed to overthrow him.


I have a WhatsApp group of 87 army officers who are waiting for our news. They 
delete it immediately after listening
Francois Bizimana 
Rwanda denies this, but it is no secret that its president, Paul Kagame, who 
is poised to run for a third term of his own 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/01/rwanda-paul-kagame-third-term-office-constitutional-changes>
, is critical of Nkurunziza. Regional observers say Kagame’s acceptance of 
critics of Burundi but not those of his own government underscores the delicate 
line that journalists in the region must walk.

People face jail if they are caught listening to Inzamba, Bizimana said. “For 
government officials or army, we use codes. I have a WhatsApp group of 87 army 
officers who are there waiting for our news 24 hours; they delete it 
immediately after listening. These are the same people who give us news and 
information – they are our supporters in the struggle.”

So while Bireha has found refuge in Rwanda, he is wary of his safety – he 
knows that Burundian security forces could come looking for him. He maintains a 
low profile, and says he does not go out to restaurants or bars.

Sitting at his laptop in Inzamba’s congested newsroom, Bireha scrolled through 
photos of those allegedly killed for opposing Nkurunziza. “I know many of these 
people killed,” he said. “Some were close friends. One day, hopefully, these 
people will get justice.”
