St George Beach, Naxos, Greece

Greece has no shortage of gorgeous beaches, but when it comes to accessible 
and child-friendly options, the Cyclades island of Naxos is hard to beat. One 
of the best bets for families can be found within a five-minute walk of Naxos 
Town (Chora). The warm, shallow waters of St George beach are perfect for 
paddling and snorkelling but there’s plenty to keep older children happy, too. 
At theFlisvos Sport Club <http://www.flisvos-sportclub.com/index.php>, you can 
sign up for windsurfing, wakeboarding or waterskiing, hire a mountain bike, or 
play a game of beach tennis or volleyball. The beach is lined with laid-back 
tavernas and beach clubs which hire out sun loungers.
• A week self-catering for two at Kalergis Studios, a stone’s throw from the 
beach, costs £667

Even in summer, the beaches of the rugged Crozon peninsula remain relatively 
quiet. In a sheltered bay, where the peninsula meets the mainland, is the 
seaside town of Morgat, with its crescent of pine-fringed sand. At low-tide, 
it’s a great spot for rock-pooling and, at high tide, the peninsula’s sea caves 
can be explored on a boat trip from the harbour (vedettes-sirenes.com 
<http://www.vedettes-sirenes.com/>). There are surf and dive schools, bikes and 
kayaks to hire, and sailboats to rent. Refuel at one of the many creperies on 
the harbour – Atao Aman (34 Boulevard de la Plage) serves savoury and sweet 
versions.

In the far west of the Algarve, the fishing village of Salema has somehow 
escaped the large-scale development that blights much of Portugal’s southern 
coast. Fishermen tend their nets on the sandy Blue Flag-certified beach, and 
dinosaur footprints can be found preserved in the limestone rocks. The gentle 
waves are perfect for a spot of boogie boarding under the watchful eye of the 
lifeguards on duty in the summer. There are sun loungers and umbrellas for 
hire, toilets and showers, and a good choice of restaurants and cafes.

Picture a beach holiday and Finland is not the first country that springs to 
mind, yet this Nordic country is home to one of the finest stretches of sand in 
northern Europe. Yyteri beach, near the city of Pori, is a 5km stretch of 
powder-soft sand backed by dunes and pine forests. In late summer, the shallow 
waters of the Baltic are surprisingly warm and the offshore breezes attract 
surfers from across Scandinavia. There are wetsuits, surf- and stand-up paddle 
boards for hire from the Yyteri Surf Centre (purjelautaliitto.fi 
<http://www.purjelautaliitto.fi/>). Facilities are low-key: a couple of coffee 
and ice-cream stalls, picnic tables, a children’s play area, toilets and not 
much else.

It’s not difficult to find a stunning beach on Sardinia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/02/holiday-guide-sardinias-best-beaches-restaurants-hotels>
, but finding one that caters for families on a modest budget is more of a 
challenge. Cala Gonone ticks all of the right boxes. White pebble-and-sand 
beaches, with sun loungers and parasols for rent, calm, turquoise waters for 
swimming and snorkelling, a long seafront promenade lined with low-key 
trattorias – and none of the bling that accompanies the glitzier Costa Smeralda 
to the north. When the charms of Cala Gonone’s two small but perfectly formed 
beaches pall, there are daily boat trips to the Bue Marino caves and more 
remote beaches, such asCala Luna <http://www.calagononecrociere.it/> and Cala 
Fuili <http://www.calagononecrociere.it/>, further south.

Just a short hop from the ferry port at Santander on Spain’s north coast, the 
genteel seaside town of Comillas is popular with Spanish families but largely 
overlooked by foreign tourists. The town has two fine beaches: Playa de 
Comillas, which has a sprinkling of cafes and a small fishing harbour, showers, 
ice-cream stalls and rock pools to explore; and the wilder Playa de Oyambre, 
backed by a beautiful nature reserve and the snow-capped Picos de Europa 
mountains.

Sandy beaches are outnumbered by pebbly ones in Croatia, but the car-free 
island of Lopud, a 40-minute ferry ride from Dubrovnik, is the exception. 
Locals ferry visitors in golf buggies from the port to Sunj beach, a 1km strip 
of sand sloping gently into limpid, shallow waters on the island’s south coast. 
There are two restaurants, both of which rent deck chairs and beach umbrellas, 
and a choice of activities from beach volleyball to tennis.

With its ochre sand and deep blue sea, Ramla Bay on Gozo is one of Malta’s 
most enticing spots. Facilities are minimal – toilets, showers, a couple of 
cafes, an ice-cream van, umbrellas and deck chairs, a statue of the Virgin Mary 
– but that’s all part of the charm. Don’t forget to bring your snorkelling 
gear; the sea life and water clarity are up there with the best in the Med.

Menorca has some of the most family-friendly beaches in the Med but they are 
often busy in July and August. To escape the crowds, head to Es Grau on the 
island’s quieter north-east coast. This horseshoe-shaped beach is a popular day 
trip for residents of the capital Mahon but the absence of any hotels has kept 
things pleasantly low-key. The tranquil bay with a natural, undeveloped 
backdrop, is like a vast, shallow paddling pool and you can hire kayaks and 
paddleboards from local operatorMenorca en Kayak <http://menorcaenkayak.com/>. 
From the beach it’s a short stroll into the village which has a handful of 
family-run restaurants and gift shops.
