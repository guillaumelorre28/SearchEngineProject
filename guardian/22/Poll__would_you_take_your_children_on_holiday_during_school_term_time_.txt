The ongoing issue over whether parents should be allowed to take their 
children on holiday during term time will come to a head on Monday evening when 
MPs debate the subject in Parliament.

The debate was triggered after a petition attracted more than 200,000 
signatures calling for the penalties – which were introduced in 2013 – to be 
scrapped and a term-time holiday allowance to be reinstated.
