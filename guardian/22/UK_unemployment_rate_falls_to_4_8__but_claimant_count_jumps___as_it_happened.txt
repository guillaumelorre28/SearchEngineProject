European markets edge lower

With Wall Street falling back after several days of rises, investors were 
pausing for breath a week after Donald Trump’s shock victory in the US election.

The mixed picture from the UK employment data - jobless rate down, claimant 
count up - added to the uncertainty. But the pound held firm against the euro 
although it edged lower against a resurgent dollar. The US currency was boosted 
by the growing belief that the Federal Reserve is almost certain to raise 
interest rates next month, as well as the continuing expectation of a Trump 
spending boom. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

The mood across most equity markets remains subdued, with modest losses being 
posted. Investors are evidently still cautious about the new [American] 
administration, with the steady drip of news relating to appointments and the 
like keeping the market in check. About the only thing still surging is the US 
dollar.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 43.02 points or 0.63% at 6749.72 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 0.66% to 10,663.87 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.78% at 4501.14 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 16,559.84 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 0.56% lower at 8638.5 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market added 2.44% to 592.26 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 73 points 
or 0.39%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Ahead of Italy’s referendum next month, there is some unwelcome analysis from 
S&P, which paints a fairly uninspiring picture of the prospects for the 
country’s economy. It said:

The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of 
GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&P Global Ratings economists in a report 
published today (“Only A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy 
<https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/showArticlePage.do?sp_mid=75191&sp_rid=2071633&object_id=9865022&rev_id=1&elqTrackId=73388d9285554dad95048fb0523f625b&elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&elqaid=75191&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=>
”).

“We don’t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak 
before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very 
depressed.Italy 
<https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/entityPage.do?sp_mid=75191&sp_rid=2071633&entityId=107135&elqTrackId=cd1e11bd9f4640f3ab243fd182183f9c&elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&elqaid=75191&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=>
 is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 
2000,” said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&P Global Ratings.

Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy’s 
real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other 
eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in 
the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area 
partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak.

The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential 
growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy’s major weakness, the 
report says. Competitiveness has suffered from a misalignment between 
stagnating productivity and rising wages, leading to a gradual appreciation of 
unit labor costs and of the real effective exchange rate. Labor market reform 
and attempts to address the high rate of nonperforming loans have yet to make 
significant progress in lifting growth.

“In the short term, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on the senate 
reform in early December is likely to weigh on the business climate, said Mr. 
Six. “Looking ahead, the slow improvement in the labor market will support a 
modest rise in household consumption, while we expect investment to pick up 
gradually, albeit remaining highly vulnerable to setbacks.”

Oil volatile after stocks reports and Russian comments

Oil prices continue to be volatile, coming under pressure after more evidence 
of growing stockpiles but then recovering.

After the American Petroleum Institute reported a higher than expected stock 
build

last week, comes a similar tale from the US Energy Information Administration.

The EIA said crude stocks rose by 5.27m barrels last week to 490.28m, compared 
to forecasts of a 1.5m increase.

Gasoline and distillate stocks - which were both forecast to fall - also rose.

But after falling further on these figures, crude recovered after Russia’s 
energy minister said he saw a big chance of Opec agreeing an output deal at its 
meeting at the end of the month.

So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $46.25 a barrel, is currently up 
0.6% at $47.17.

Germany's Schäuble dismisses Greek debt relief talk

US president Barack Obama might be pushing for debt relief for Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-earnings-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b#block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b>
, but unsurprisingly Germany disagrees (which should make Obama’s upcoming 
meeting with Angela Merkel interesting). Reutersreports 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-debt-germany-idUSKBN13B1L7>:

Germany on Wednesday opposed calls for debt relief for Greece after U.S. 
President Barack Obama offered support for such a mechanism for the 
recession-hit euro zone state during a trip to Athens.

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble said late on Tuesday granting Greece 
debt relief would do it a disservice.

“Whoever says ‘we will relieve your debts’ is doing Greece a disservice,” the 
finance ministry confirmed Schäuble as saying after the Passauer Neue Presse 
daily reported it.

Schäuble’s comments were not made directly in response to Obama, a finance 
ministry spokesman added.

Athens signed up to a third economic bailout package of up to 86 billion euros 
last year but wants long-term debt restructuring to exit its crisis.

Germany, which has long said there is no immediate need for debt relief for 
Greece as it would discourage much-needed structural reforms, said it noted the 
comments from Obama, who flies to Berlin later on Wednesday.

“We have noted that President Obama has pointed to the importance of debt 
relief. The euro group agreed in May on a timetable on exactly that subject .. 
regarding measures for the short term, and later in 2018 for mid-term 
measures,” said government spokesman Steffen Seibert at a news conference.

In May, euro zone governments offered Greece debt relief in 2018 but left key 
details to be decided later in a compromise between Germany’s tough stance and 
the International Monetary Fund’s call for decisions immediately.

A finance ministry spokesman said there was nothing new to say. “Our position 
is unchanged. Obama’s visit has not changed anything,” he said at the 
government news conference.

Wall Street opens lower

The prospect of higher US interest rates has brought an end to the rally which 
has seen leading US shares hit new heights.

After rising for seven straight trading sessions in the run up and aftermath 
of Donald Trump’s shock US presidential election victory, the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.3%. The S&P 500 opened down 
0.25% while Nasdaq was 0.4% lower.

Back with the UK, and the Bank of England’s Jon Cunliffe has said recent 
currency movements had made setting interest rates move difficult. Reuters
reports <http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-boe-cunliffe-idUSKBN13B1QX>:

Sterling’s sharp fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union has made 
it harder to set monetary policy, BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on 
Wednesday.

Cunliffe said he fully backed the central bank’s neutral stance regarding its 
next move in interest rates, as announced earlier this month, and its latest 
quarterly set of forecasts which see a modest slowdown next year.

The British economy probably still needed interest rates to be negative in 
‘real’ or inflation-adjusted terms, but the fall in sterling meant the BoE 
would not necessarily be able to stick to this, Cunliffe said in the text of a 
speech to be delivered at the University of Manchester.

On his final day in Greece, US president Barack Obama repeated his belief that 
debt relief was vital for the country. The Athens News Agency - Macedonian 
Press Agencyreports: 
<http://www.amna.gr/english/article/15933/Obamas-visit:-Greece-needs-debt-relief-because-people-need-hope--Obama-says>

Speaking at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation on Wednesday, U.S. President 
Barack Obama once again highlighted the need for Greece’s creditors to agree to 
debt relief, in accordance with the advice of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), noting that the country, and especially its young people, needed to see 
hope and a future.

 “The IMF has said that debt relief will be crucial to get Greece back to 
growth. They are right. It is important because if reforms here are to be 
sustained, people here need to see hope and they need to see progress.”

 Young people, in particular, needed to know there is a future, there is an 
education, and jobs that were worthy of their potential, he added.

Over in Europe, and the latest on the draft budgets put forward by member 
states. Reutersreports 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-budgets-idUSKBN13B19P>:

Italy and five other countries are at risk of breaking European Union budget 
discipline rules with their 2017 draft budgets, the European Commission said in 
a statement on Wednesday.

The five other countries are Belgium, Cyprus, Lithuania, Slovenia and Finland.

“The Draft Budgetary Plans of these Member States might result in a 
significant deviation from the adjustment paths toward the respective 
medium-term objective,” the Commission said.

The medium-term objective is a budget balanced in structural terms, which 
means excluding one-off spending and revenue and the effects of the business 
cycle.

Italy’s structural deficit, which excludes one-off items and economic cycle 
swings in income and spending, has been rising every year since 2014 and is to 
jump to 2.2 percent in 2017 from 1.6 percent in 2016 and then further to 2.4 
percent in 2018, according to Commission forecasts last week.

This goes clearly against EU rules which say that countries have to cut their 
structural deficit by at least 0.5 percent of GDP every year until they reach 
balance or surplus.

Italy says the higher structural deficit is due to extraordinary spending on 
migration and post-earthquake reconstruction. But the structural deficit 
indicator does not take into account such one-off items and the Commission 
called the explanation “not constructive”.

On Wednesday, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre 
Moscovici sounded more accommodating.

“The significant part of the deviation is due to the cost of the seismic 
activity in the country, very serious this year and to migration inflows,” 
Moscovici told a news conference.

“We will take that into account,” he said.

The pound’s renewed dip came after an early gain in the immediate aftermath of 
the UK unemployment figures. Chris Saint, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown 
Currency Service, said:

Sterling has drifted lower against the euro and US dollar during European 
trading hours this morning, finding itself back around the €1.16 and US$1.24 
levels by midday. There was some tentative support for the pound after today’s 
UK labour market figures, but the gains were short-lived...On the face of it 
the headline numbers suggest the jobs market has remained buoyant in the first 
few months since the EU referendum, although the data probably does little to 
alter the Bank of England’s future policy path at this stage as pay growth is 
still relatively contained.

The stronger dollar has helped send the oil price lower, after a surge in 
crude on Tuesday.

Talk of an informal meeting on Friday in Doha between oil producers to prepare 
plans for an output agreement later this month had sent crude soaring around 5% 
on Tuesday.

But the dollar strength, along with news from the American Petroleum Institute 
that US crude stocks jumped by 3.6m barrels last week rather than showing the 
expected 1.5m rise, has send crude slipping lower again.

Brent is down 1.13% at $46.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 1.2% 
lower at $45.23.

Dollar index hits 14 year high on rate expectations

The dollar continues to strengthen as the odds of a US interest rate rise next 
month continue to shorten.

Federal Reserve board member James Bullard is the latest to back an increase, 
saying that unless there are any major shocks, rates will be hiked. Given how 
the market has reacted to Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in the US election, 
it is hard to know what major shock would upset the market at this point.

But Bullard, who was in London as a UBS banking conference, added that a 
single rate rise might be enough to move monetary policy to a neutral setting.

So the dollar index - against a basket of currencies - has hit a 14 year high 
of 100.52, while the pound is down 0.17% to $1.2431.

Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said:

The strength in the dollar index does represent a risk for the emerging 
markets and it can also eat into corporate profit for the US firms. The current 
move is also massively backed by bets that the Fed is going to raise the 
interest rate and odds are standing at 94%. It is important to keep in mind 
that come in December, it is the tone of the Fed for the future trajectory of 
the interest rate hike which is going to impact the dollar.

Larry Elliott

And here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott’s take on the figures:

All things considered, the government will be happy with how the labour market 
performed in the first three months after the EU referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-falls-september-office-for-national-statistics>
.

Unemployment <https://www.theguardian.com/society/unemployment> has continued 
to fall and at 4.8% of the workforce is at its lowest level for 11 years. 
Employment has continued to rise and there are plenty of jobs to be had. 
Ministers would not have expected anything better than that in the turbulent 
post-Brexit weeks and would have feared a much worse outcome.

That said, the tone of next week’s autumn statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/autumn-statement-2016> will be that big 
challenges for the economy remain, and there are hints of possible trouble 
ahead from the latest labour market data from the Office for National 
Statistics.

UK unemployment falls to 11-year low <> Read more 

One warning sign is the 49,000 increase in the number of economically inactive 
people – those who have dropped out of the workforce – in the latest quarter. 
Another is the rise of almost 10,000 in the claimant count measure of 
unemployment in October.

Here’s our report on the UK jobs data. Phillip Inman writes:

Unemployment <https://www.theguardian.com/society/unemployment> dropped to its 
lowest level in 11 years in September in a further indication that Britain’s 
employers have largely shrugged off the June Brexit vote.

In the first health check of the labour market covering the three months since 
the referendum, official figures show the unemployment rate was 4.8%, the 
lowest since September 2005 and downfrom 4.9% in August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/19/uk-employment-rate-at-record-high-despite-brexit-vote>
 and 5.3% a year earlier.

Employment remained at a record high of 74.5% and annual wages rises, 
excluding bonuses, also nudged higher to 2.4% from 2.3% in August and 2.1% in 
July, according to theOffice for National Statistics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics>.

But the claimant count in October jumped by its highest number since May, and 
analysts warned that the rate at which employers were taking on new workers had 
slowed dramatically.

FSB: We need more support for self-employed

 * Britain’s army of self-employed workers has swelled by over 4.5% in the 
last 12 months, which is a concern given recent revelations about life in the 
Gig economy.

 * 

 * Today’s labour market report shows that the self-employment total jumped by 
213,000 in the last 12 months to 4.79 million, or 15.1% of all workers.

 * 

 * In contrast, the number of employees rose by 256,000 to 26.82 million.

 * These self-employed workers don’t enjoy the benefits of employed workers, 
such as sickness and holiday pay and the minimum wage -- as was highlighted by 
protests by Deliveroo drivers andthe successful court case brought by two Uber 
drivers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status>
.

 * And figures released last month show that self-employed people are actually 
receiving less than 15 years ago [their pay is not included in the earnings 
figures].
The government has asked Matthew Taylor, a former top advisor to Tony Blair, 
to investigate the whole issue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/i-tell-theresa-may-working-lives-review-modern-employment-zero-hours-flexibility>
. 
 * 

 * Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, says 
Britain simply hasn’t kept pace with the rise in self-employment. 
 * 

 * These figures are another signal that more needs to be done to support the 
self-employed, including on developing a clear legal definition of 
self-employment and on issues like access to mortgages and income protection, 
and addressing the discrepancies between the self-employed and employees in the 
social security system, such as on maternity pay. 
 * FSB is pleased with the announcement of the Taylor Review and we are 
looking forward to inputting into this.”

Over in parliament, Theresa May has hailed today’s unemployment figures, at 
Prime Minister’s Questions.

May argues:

The unemployment figures show the strength of the fundamental of our economy

The employment rate has never been higher, and the unemployment rate is at its 
lowest in a decade.

May also reminded the Commons that search giant Google has just announced it 
will create 3,000 new jobs, as it builds a new HQ in Kings Cross

With Wall Street falling back after several days of rises, investors were 
pausing for breath a week after Donald Trump’s shock victory in the US election.

The mixed picture from the UK employment data - jobless rate down, claimant 
count up - added to the uncertainty. But the pound held firm against the euro 
although it edged lower against a resurgent dollar. The US currency was boosted 
by the growing belief that the Federal Reserve is almost certain to raise 
interest rates next month, as well as the continuing expectation of a Trump 
spending boom. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

The mood across most equity markets remains subdued, with modest losses being 
posted. Investors are evidently still cautious about the new [American] 
administration, with the steady drip of news relating to appointments and the 
like keeping the market in check. About the only thing still surging is the US 
dollar.

The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 43.02 points or 0.63% at 6749.72 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 0.66% to 10,663.87 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.78% at 4501.14 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 16,559.84 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 0.56% lower at 8638.5 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market added 2.44% to 592.26 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 73 points 
or 0.39%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Ahead of Italy’s referendum next month, there is some unwelcome analysis from 
S&P, which paints a fairly uninspiring picture of the prospects for the 
country’s economy. It said:

The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of 
GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&P Global Ratings economists in a report 
published today (“Only A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy 
<https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/showArticlePage.do?sp_mid=75191&sp_rid=2071633&object_id=9865022&rev_id=1&elqTrackId=73388d9285554dad95048fb0523f625b&elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&elqaid=75191&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=>
”).

“We don’t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak 
before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very 
depressed.Italy 
<https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/entityPage.do?sp_mid=75191&sp_rid=2071633&entityId=107135&elqTrackId=cd1e11bd9f4640f3ab243fd182183f9c&elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&elqaid=75191&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=>
 is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 
2000,” said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&P Global Ratings.

Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy’s 
real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other 
eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in 
the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area 
partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak.

The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential 
growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy’s major weakness, the 
report says. Competitiveness has suffered from a misalignment between 
stagnating productivity and rising wages, leading to a gradual appreciation of 
unit labor costs and of the real effective exchange rate. Labor market reform 
and attempts to address the high rate of nonperforming loans have yet to make 
significant progress in lifting growth.

“In the short term, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on the senate 
reform in early December is likely to weigh on the business climate, said Mr. 
Six. “Looking ahead, the slow improvement in the labor market will support a 
modest rise in household consumption, while we expect investment to pick up 
gradually, albeit remaining highly vulnerable to setbacks.”
 
Oil prices continue to be volatile, coming under pressure after more evidence 
of growing stockpiles but then recovering.

After the American Petroleum Institute reported a higher than expected stock 
build 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-earnings-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-582c569ce4b06ac41294e2cf#block-582c569ce4b06ac41294e2cf>
last week, comes a similar tale from the US Energy Information Administration.

The EIA said crude stocks rose by 5.27m barrels last week to 490.28m, compared 
to forecasts of a 1.5m increase.

Gasoline and distillate stocks - which were both forecast to fall - also rose.

But after falling further on these figures, crude recovered after Russia’s 
energy minister said he saw a big chance of Opec agreeing an output deal at its 
meeting at the end of the month.

So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $46.25 a barrel, is currently up 
0.6% at $47.17.
 
US president Barack Obama might be pushing for debt relief for Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-earnings-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b#block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b>
, but unsurprisingly Germany disagrees (which should make Obama’s upcoming 
meeting with Angela Merkel interesting). Reutersreports 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-debt-germany-idUSKBN13B1L7>:

Germany on Wednesday opposed calls for debt relief for Greece after U.S. 
President Barack Obama offered support for such a mechanism for the 
recession-hit euro zone state during a trip to Athens.

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble said late on Tuesday granting Greece 
debt relief would do it a disservice.

“Whoever says ‘we will relieve your debts’ is doing Greece a disservice,” the 
finance ministry confirmed Schäuble as saying after the Passauer Neue Presse 
daily reported it.

Schäuble’s comments were not made directly in response to Obama, a finance 
ministry spokesman added.

Athens signed up to a third economic bailout package of up to 86 billion euros 
last year but wants long-term debt restructuring to exit its crisis.

Germany, which has long said there is no immediate need for debt relief for 
Greece as it would discourage much-needed structural reforms, said it noted the 
comments from Obama, who flies to Berlin later on Wednesday.

“We have noted that President Obama has pointed to the importance of debt 
relief. The euro group agreed in May on a timetable on exactly that subject .. 
regarding measures for the short term, and later in 2018 for mid-term 
measures,” said government spokesman Steffen Seibert at a news conference.

In May, euro zone governments offered Greece debt relief in 2018 but left key 
details to be decided later in a compromise between Germany’s tough stance and 
the International Monetary Fund’s call for decisions immediately.

A finance ministry spokesman said there was nothing new to say. “Our position 
is unchanged. Obama’s visit has not changed anything,” he said at the 
government news conference.
 
The prospect of higher US interest rates has brought an end to the rally which 
has seen leading US shares hit new heights.

After rising for seven straight trading sessions in the run up and aftermath 
of Donald Trump’s shock US presidential election victory, the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.3%. The S&P 500 opened down 
0.25% while Nasdaq was 0.4% lower.

Back with the UK, and the Bank of England’s Jon Cunliffe has said recent 
currency movements had made setting interest rates move difficult. Reuters
reports <http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-boe-cunliffe-idUSKBN13B1QX>:

Sterling’s sharp fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union has made 
it harder to set monetary policy, BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on 
Wednesday.

Cunliffe said he fully backed the central bank’s neutral stance regarding its 
next move in interest rates, as announced earlier this month, and its latest 
quarterly set of forecasts which see a modest slowdown next year.

The British economy probably still needed interest rates to be negative in 
‘real’ or inflation-adjusted terms, but the fall in sterling meant the BoE 
would not necessarily be able to stick to this, Cunliffe said in the text of a 
speech to be delivered at the University of Manchester.

It was unchanged in October compared to forecasts of a 0.2% increase. The

On his final day in Greece, US president Barack Obama repeated his belief that 
debt relief was vital for the country. The Athens News Agency - Macedonian 
Press Agencyreports: 
<http://www.amna.gr/english/article/15933/Obamas-visit:-Greece-needs-debt-relief-because-people-need-hope--Obama-says>

Speaking at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation on Wednesday, U.S. President 
Barack Obama once again highlighted the need for Greece’s creditors to agree to 
debt relief, in accordance with the advice of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), noting that the country, and especially its young people, needed to see 
hope and a future.

 “The IMF has said that debt relief will be crucial to get Greece back to 
growth. They are right. It is important because if reforms here are to be 
sustained, people here need to see hope and they need to see progress.”

 Young people, in particular, needed to know there is a future, there is an 
education, and jobs that were worthy of their potential, he added.

Over in Europe, and the latest on the draft budgets put forward by member 
states. Reutersreports 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-budgets-idUSKBN13B19P>:

Italy and five other countries are at risk of breaking European Union budget 
discipline rules with their 2017 draft budgets, the European Commission said in 
a statement on Wednesday.

The five other countries are Belgium, Cyprus, Lithuania, Slovenia and Finland.

“The Draft Budgetary Plans of these Member States might result in a 
significant deviation from the adjustment paths toward the respective 
medium-term objective,” the Commission said.

The medium-term objective is a budget balanced in structural terms, which 
means excluding one-off spending and revenue and the effects of the business 
cycle.

Italy’s structural deficit, which excludes one-off items and economic cycle 
swings in income and spending, has been rising every year since 2014 and is to 
jump to 2.2 percent in 2017 from 1.6 percent in 2016 and then further to 2.4 
percent in 2018, according to Commission forecasts last week.

This goes clearly against EU rules which say that countries have to cut their 
structural deficit by at least 0.5 percent of GDP every year until they reach 
balance or surplus.

Italy says the higher structural deficit is due to extraordinary spending on 
migration and post-earthquake reconstruction. But the structural deficit 
indicator does not take into account such one-off items and the Commission 
called the explanation “not constructive”.

On Wednesday, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre 
Moscovici sounded more accommodating.

“The significant part of the deviation is due to the cost of the seismic 
activity in the country, very serious this year and to migration inflows,” 
Moscovici told a news conference.

“We will take that into account,” he said.
 
The pound’s renewed dip came after an early gain in the immediate aftermath of 
the UK unemployment figures. Chris Saint, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown 
Currency Service, said:

Sterling has drifted lower against the euro and US dollar during European 
trading hours this morning, finding itself back around the €1.16 and US$1.24 
levels by midday. There was some tentative support for the pound after today’s 
UK labour market figures, but the gains were short-lived...On the face of it 
the headline numbers suggest the jobs market has remained buoyant in the first 
few months since the EU referendum, although the data probably does little to 
alter the Bank of England’s future policy path at this stage as pay growth is 
still relatively contained.
 
The stronger dollar has helped send the oil price lower, after a surge in 
crude on Tuesday.

Talk of an informal meeting on Friday in Doha between oil producers to prepare 
plans for an output agreement later this month had sent crude soaring around 5% 
on Tuesday.

But the dollar strength, along with news from the American Petroleum Institute 
that US crude stocks jumped by 3.6m barrels last week rather than showing the 
expected 1.5m rise, has send crude slipping lower again.

Brent is down 1.13% at $46.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 1.2% 
lower at $45.23.
 
The dollar continues to strengthen as the odds of a US interest rate rise next 
month continue to shorten.

Federal Reserve board member James Bullard is the latest to back an increase, 
saying that unless there are any major shocks, rates will be hiked. Given how 
the market has reacted to Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in the US election, 
it is hard to know what major shock would upset the market at this point.

But Bullard, who was in London as a UBS banking conference, added that a 
single rate rise might be enough to move monetary policy to a neutral setting.

So the dollar index - against a basket of currencies - has hit a 14 year high 
of 100.52, while the pound is down 0.17% to $1.2431.

Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said:

The strength in the dollar index does represent a risk for the emerging 
markets and it can also eat into corporate profit for the US firms. The current 
move is also massively backed by bets that the Fed is going to raise the 
interest rate and odds are standing at 94%. It is important to keep in mind 
that come in December, it is the tone of the Fed for the future trajectory of 
the interest rate hike which is going to impact the dollar.
 
And here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott’s take on the figures:

All things considered, the government will be happy with how the labour market 
performed in the first three months after the EU referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-falls-september-office-for-national-statistics>
.

Unemployment <https://www.theguardian.com/society/unemployment> has continued 
to fall and at 4.8% of the workforce is at its lowest level for 11 years. 
Employment has continued to rise and there are plenty of jobs to be had. 
Ministers would not have expected anything better than that in the turbulent 
post-Brexit weeks and would have feared a much worse outcome.

That said, the tone of next week’s autumn statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/autumn-statement-2016> will be that big 
challenges for the economy remain, and there are hints of possible trouble 
ahead from the latest labour market data from the Office for National 
Statistics.

One warning sign is the 49,000 increase in the number of economically inactive 
people – those who have dropped out of the workforce – in the latest quarter. 
Another is the rise of almost 10,000 in the claimant count measure of 
unemployment in October.

Here’s our report on the UK jobs data. Phillip Inman writes:

Unemployment <https://www.theguardian.com/society/unemployment> dropped to its 
lowest level in 11 years in September in a further indication that Britain’s 
employers have largely shrugged off the June Brexit vote.

In the first health check of the labour market covering the three months since 
the referendum, official figures show the unemployment rate was 4.8%, the 
lowest since September 2005 and downfrom 4.9% in August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/19/uk-employment-rate-at-record-high-despite-brexit-vote>
 and 5.3% a year earlier.

Employment remained at a record high of 74.5% and annual wages rises, 
excluding bonuses, also nudged higher to 2.4% from 2.3% in August and 2.1% in 
July, according to theOffice for National Statistics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics>.

But the claimant count in October jumped by its highest number since May, and 
analysts warned that the rate at which employers were taking on new workers had 
slowed dramatically.

Unemployment falls to 11-year low

<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-falls-september-office-for-national-statistics> 
 * Britain’s army of self-employed workers has swelled by over 4.5% in the 
last 12 months, which is a concern given recent revelations about life in the 
Gig economy.

 * 

 * Today’s labour market report shows that the self-employment total jumped by 
213,000 in the last 12 months to 4.79 million, or 15.1% of all workers.

 * 

 * In contrast, the number of employees rose by 256,000 to 26.82 million.

 * These self-employed workers don’t enjoy the benefits of employed workers, 
such as sickness and holiday pay and the minimum wage -- as was highlighted by 
protests by Deliveroo drivers andthe successful court case brought by two Uber 
drivers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status>
.

 * And figures released last month show that self-employed people are actually 
receiving less than 15 years ago [their pay is not included in the earnings 
figures].
The government has asked Matthew Taylor, a former top advisor to Tony Blair, 
to investigate the whole issue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/i-tell-theresa-may-working-lives-review-modern-employment-zero-hours-flexibility>
. 
 * 

 * Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, says 
Britain simply hasn’t kept pace with the rise in self-employment. 
 * 

 * These figures are another signal that more needs to be done to support the 
self-employed, including on developing a clear legal definition of 
self-employment and on issues like access to mortgages and income protection, 
and addressing the discrepancies between the self-employed and employees in the 
social security system, such as on maternity pay. 
 * FSB is pleased with the announcement of the Taylor Review and we are 
looking forward to inputting into this.”  
Over in parliament, Theresa May has hailed today’s unemployment figures, at 
Prime Minister’s Questions.

May argues:

The unemployment figures show the strength of the fundamental of our economy

The employment rate has never been higher, and the unemployment rate is at its 
lowest in a decade.

May also reminded the Commons that search giant Google has just announced it 
will create 3,000 new jobs, as it builds a new HQ in Kings Cross
