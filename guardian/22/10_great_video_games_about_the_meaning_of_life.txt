We don’t often look to video games when we’re feeling confused about life, the 
universe or anything else. This is traditionally a medium of escape, the place 
you come to forget about the world and blow stuff up for a few minutes.

But it’s not always that way. Since the beginning, games have also been a 
place to experiment with what it means to be human. When you think about it, 
it’s obvious: no other medium allows us to interact with and explore the 
possibilities of existence like games do.

So, here are 10 games that tell us a little about what life is – often in a 
very comforting way. Remember to add your own suggestions in the comments 
section!

Alter Ego (Apple II, C64, Spectrum, 1986)

Developed by psychologist Peter Favaro, this early simulation title gave the 
player control over a whole life from infancy to death, via a long series of 
multiple choice questions. More of a personality test than a game, it was 
revolutionary at the time. A version isnow available for smartphones 
<https://www.playalterego.com/>. 

Life lesson: every decision you make is meaningful – especially the ones about 
getting into cars with strangers.

Nintendo’s classic series involves moving into a small village populated by 
cute anthropomorphic animals and just … living. You collect stuff, do simple 
chores for your neighbours, and while away the seasons fishing and gardening. 
It is a game about the joy of community, about the rhythms that bind us to 
nature, and about comfort. A beautiful game to unwind with.

Life lesson: be nice to people and always keep an eye out for the money rock.

 Braid. Photograph: Jonathan Blow 
Jonathan Blow’s seminal indie platformer is ostensibly about a character named 
Tim who sets out to rescue a princess from a monster. But instead, this 
archetypal premise is paired with an ingenious rewind mechanic to explore the 
fallibility of memory and the subjective (sometimes even semi-delusional) way 
we see ourselves and our motivations. The puzzles are great too.

Life lesson: sometimes the princess that needs saving is you.

 Civilization V. Photograph: 2K Games 
Taking a macro view of human life, the Civilization series of strategy games 
has so much to say about what motivates us, and why things in the world work 
out the way they do. Although the key aim is guiding a tribe from the stone age 
to the space age, every decision you make needs to be weighed against the 
happiness of your people, who are effectively your captives. As Dostoyevsky 
said, you can judge a society by how well it treats its prisoners. It’s just 
that, in this case, youare the society.

Life lesson: all people want is to be happy – even if that means firing a 
nuclear missile at Gandhi.

 Journey. Photograph: Thatgamecompany 
Visually beautiful, soulful, almost elegiac in tone, Thatgamecompany’s 
wonderful short game about traveling across a barren land to reach a towering 
mountain is a simple metaphor about life. Famously, the game is cooperative via 
an online connection, but the person you play with remains a stranger 
throughout. You have to rely on each other’s goodwill, with only very 
rudimentary forms of communication. But through these tools, and the 
extraordinary soundtrack by Austin Wintory, amazing experiences are possible.

Life lesson: life is about the journey not the destination. Also, be good to 
people online.

 Life is Strange. Photograph: Dontnod Entertainment 
On the face of it, Life is Strange is episodic adventure about a young girl 
who discovers she has the power to travel in time. But what this coming-of-age 
story really deals with are big notions of responsibility, consequence, love 
and the idea that there are no fundamentally right decisions, just one’s that 
we can live with.

Life lesson: you can’t save everyone you meet.

The Novelist <http://www.thenovelistgame.com/> (PC, Mac, 2013)

Billed as “a game about life, family and the decisions we make”, The Novelist 
follows a family who rent a holiday home not realising it’s haunted – by you. 
The father is a frustrated writer, the mother a painter, and you have to decide 
how they reconcile their ambitions against caring for each other and their son. 
It is sad and sometimes almost desperate, but it says a lot about adulthood, 
responsibility and sacrifice.

Life lesson: if you care about people, you need to make sacrifices for them – 
especially if you live in a haunted beach house with an artist.

Passage <http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/> (PC, iOS, 2007)
 Passage. Photograph: Jason Rohrer 
Created by experimental game designer Jason Rohrer, Passage is a five-minute 
scrolling adventure game in which your character moves inexorably toward death. 
There are treasures to collect on the way, and you can marry another character, 
but this restricts your ability to pass through sections of the map – oh and 
they always die before you. It’s strangely affecting, and the way your avatar 
begins the adventure on the far left of the screen, with their whole future 
ahead of them, but then ends at the far right, with only a past, is very 
clever. If very depressing.

Life lesson: life is really short, treasure is largely meaningless and love 
can sometimes stop you from getting through small gaps.

 The Sims 4. Photograph: Electronic Arts 
Created by legendary game designer Will Wright, The Sims, through all its many 
incarnations, remains the ultimate life simulator, giving players intricate 
control over a house full of disparate and intelligent characters. Part 
strategy, part soap opera, and always full of surprises and pathos – The Sims 
is a fascinating intellectual, sociological and psychological experiment that 
also allows you to make people wet themselves in the kitchen.

Life lesson: every swimming pool needs a ladder.

 To The Moon. Photograph: Freebird Games 
Kan Gao’s thoughtful and meditative game looks like a standard 1990s 
role-playing adventure, but it is in fact, a treatise on love, yearning and 
regret. Set in a future where scientists are able to manipulate the memories of 
dying people in order to give them peace, your task is to give a dying man the 
experience of visiting the moon. Why he wants to go, and what it all means, is 
a story told backward as you reconstruct the story of his life. It is 
ridiculously moving, but it’s central message is proactive rather than sanguine.

Life lesson: if there’s something you want to do, do it. Do it right now.
