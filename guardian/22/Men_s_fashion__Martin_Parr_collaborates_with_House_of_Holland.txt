Photographer Martin Parr <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/martin-parr>
 is widely lauded as a chronicler of the most British of British society. His 
close-up shots of the British classes combine deadpan humour with arch-realism, 
creating an evocative image of national taste. He’s also fascinated by 
consumerism and subcultures, an appropriate backdrop for British designer Henry 
Holland’s first House of Holland menswear collection, which combines Holland’s 
sportswear-inspired looks with Teds, buffalo kids and ravers, as photographed 
by Parr. On paper it sounds a little hifalutin, but the images – slogan 
sweaters at regional bus stops, models in butcher shops, loads and loads of 
chips – are pretty fun. With a nod to Parr’s immediacy, Holland’s collection 
will also be available to buy on Monday instead of having to wait for months.
