Now the clock has struck two, my tampon is turning into a pumpkin. I gotta run.

With that farewell, Sinéad is heading off and our webchat must end.


A big thank you to everyone who submitted questions and a very big thank you 
to Sinéad herself, for coming in to the Guardian building and doing her best to 
answer all your questions.

In answer to your first question: Suck my dick, bitch. 

To your second: I don't like people saying I look good because I'm skinny. I 
don't like words like 'good' or 'bad' being associated with female weight.

You claimed in your interview with Tim Jonze at the weekend

 to have known ‘about other recent abuse scandals – from Jimmy Savile and Rolf 
Harris to the alleged child-abuse ring at the heart of the British government – 
before they were public knowledge.’ Why didn’t you inform the correct

What I meant was I had read all the newspaper articles about the British 
government's involvement in child abuse, which had been available online for 
some years.

I did not state that I knew about Jimmy Savile. I did not know.

I did not state that I knew about Rolf Harris. I stated that I wasn't 
surprised.

Now the clock has struck two, my tampon is turning into a pumpkin. I gotta run.

With that farewell, Sinéad is heading off and our webchat must end.


A big thank you to everyone who submitted questions and a very big thank you 
to Sinéad herself, for coming in to the Guardian building and doing her best to 
answer all your questions.

In answer to your first question: Suck my dick, bitch. 

To your second: I don't like people saying I look good because I'm skinny. I 
don't like words like 'good' or 'bad' being associated with female weight.

You claimed in your interview with Tim Jonze at the weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/27/sinead-o-connor-interview-i-deserve-to-be-a-priest>
 to have known ‘about other recent abuse scandals – from Jimmy Savile and Rolf 
Harris to the alleged child-abuse ring at the heart of the British government – 
before they were public knowledge.’ Why didn’t you inform the correct 
authorities?

What I meant was I had read all the newspaper articles about the British 
government's involvement in child abuse, which had been available online for 
some years.

I did not state that I knew about Jimmy Savile. I did not know.

I did not state that I knew about Rolf Harris. I stated that I wasn't 
surprised.

I don't think women should sit around waiting for permission. They should just 
get up and do it.
