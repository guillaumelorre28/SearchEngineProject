In 2013 David Cameron announced that he would seek a new settlement for 
Britain in a newly invigorated Europe. That vision was far from clear, not only 
to the other 27 but to very many of the British people (as 23 June eventually 
showed). So, in February last year, finding himself between a rock and a hard 
place, he returned with only a small handful of concessions.

Now Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay>, with an 
even vaguer vision for Britain (and none for the EU), finds herself stuck 
between not a rock but a mountain and a very hard place indeed. So when her 
wise and skilled officials tell her this truth, they are forced out. Does she 
think France and Germany and all the other partners will just roll over if we 
quit without an agreement? Do we want the continental EU itself to collapse? 
Everyone knows that what would follow would be a disaster. At no other time 
since the second world war have we been in greater need of seasoned diplomats.

Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/uk-ambassador-to-eu-quits-amid-brexit-row>
, 3 January) is just one more indicator of the really big mess we’re in.

• It is becoming increasing clear, following the resignation of the British 
ambassador to the EU, that the Brexiteers did not expect to win the referendum 
and have no clear objectives as to how to obtain the best deal for the UK. To 
obtain the best deal for the UK, Mrs May doesn’t need a Brexiteer in this post 
but someone like Sir Ivan who can give her clear objective advice. I would urge 
her to follow the example of Elizabeth I, who, on appointing as her chief 
minister Sir William Cecil, said of him: “This opinion I have of you: that 
whatever you know my personal opinion to be, you will give me advice that is 
best for the realm.”

• Another immensely qualified person loses their job for not being optimistic 
enough about Brexit. This as we enter 2017, the 200th anniversary of the birth 
ofGeorge Holyoake <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Holyoake>, the man who 
coined the word “jingoism”. How very apt. And how utterly depressing.

• Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation is a great boost to Britain’s negotiating 
position on leaving the EU. He clearly didn’t know which team he was playing 
for.
