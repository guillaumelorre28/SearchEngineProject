The Golden Ring is a popular destination for Russian tourists: the towns in 
the region are ancient, and many were important centres in medieval Russia. But 
this area, north-east of Moscow, has more to offer, such as traditional food, 
and nature straight from Russian fairytales. Many visitors buy package tours 
for the entire region, but it’s easy to visit the towns on day trips from the 
capital, especially if you’re not ready for a week-long tour. The journey times 
to most are a couple of hours by train from Moscow.

 A bedroom at the Cinema Club 
What to see The heritage of this place is vast: the Transfiguration monastery, 
founded in the 11th century, was a favourite of Ivan the Terrible and is now a 
museum. It is also part of the city’s largeMuseum Reserve 
<http://www.russianmuseums.info/M1855>. A walk along the banks of the Volga, 
the longest river in Europe, is as much a cultural activity as it is a hike. The
Governor’s house museum <http://artmuseum.yar.ru/default_en.aspx> has an 
excellent collection of the Yaroslavl school of icon painting and theMusic and 
Time Museum 
<https://www.viamichelin.co.uk/web/Tourist-Attraction/Jaroslavl-_-Music_and_Time_Museum-a5q4ftkj>

and clocks.

 (Revolutsionnaya Street), a restaurant themed after a Soviet film but

Club hotel.

tooth – a standard tour includes a tasting. The museum’s cafe, called Blinnaya 
Izba (Blini Hut), serves traditional Russian crepes,blini, with a variety of 
fillings and toppings. If you’re in the city for more than a day, consider a

and home to the Unesco-protected Church of the Intercession, on the banks of

 The Kremlin of Rostov Velikiy Photograph: Michael Runkel/Getty Images 
What to see Rostov Velikiy (don’t confuse it with Rostov-on-Don, a different 
town in a different part of Russia) is one of the oldest towns in Russia: its 
chronicles date to AD862. There’s a Kremlin fortress, four monasteries, 
countless ancient churches, and the large, peaceful Lake Nero, a perfect spot 
for contemplation. If you get too philosophical, don’t forget Rostov is also a 
foodie destination: head toLukova Sloboda 
<http://welcome-rostov.com/lukova-sloboda/#_=_>, a local museum and cafe 
exploring the onion traditions of the region, to try onion soup and onion buns, 
or buy a jar of onion jam as a souvenir. Next to it, on Dostoyevskogo Street, is
Schuchiy Dvor 
<https://www.tripadvisor.ru/Restaurant_Review-g811396-d8047061-Reviews-Shhuchiy_Dvor-Rostov_Yaroslavl_Oblast_Central_Russia.html>
, serving pike from the nearby lake; try it in a traditional soup calledukha, 
or in burger form with raspberry sauce.
