Locating the right expertise and the necessary funding is an important step in 
a startup’s journey. We’ve put together an expert guide to the winning 
strategies that will transform your business idea into an unfair advantage.

Understand your risks

Finding funding sources for startups can be daunting and time-consuming, but 
most investors are on the lookout for a few key markers.

“Investors don’t like to take multi-factor risk,” says Robert Wickham, 
regional vice president of innovation and digital transformation at business 
software leader Salesforce, who has worked with leading Australian startups to 
get them to market. “They want to know, firstly, is this a compelling 
opportunity, and secondly, is there the team in place to execute it. Any pitch 
to investors should talk to both.”

It sounds simple enough, but knowing your place in the market is something 
that people with a great idea can overlook, Wickham says from his time 
witnessing businesses starting out across several continents. He’s seen a lot 
of startups fail because they aren’t able to clarify the problem they’re trying 
to solve. “They either don’t know their buyer, or haven’t built their 
market-value proposition. Put simply: execution trumps a great idea,” he says.

Crafting the right collaborative environment is a foundation stone of 
execution. As Henry Ford once famously said, “coming together is a beginning; 
keeping together is progress; working together is success.”

Join the war on talent

“There is a global war on talent,” Robert Wickham says unequivocally, “and 
success equals attracting and retaining the best talent. Just as you design for 
customers, you have to design for employees.”

It sounds simple enough, but knowing your place in the market is something 
that people with a great idea can overlook

Successful startups merge a combination of what he calls ‘the three H’s’ – 
hipsters, hackers, and hustlers. Hipsters know their customers, have strong 
business empathy, and are all about product design. Hackers are what they call 
‘10xers’ in Silicon Valley: talented individuals who can supercharge your 
business outcomes tenfold. Hustlers are the all rounders, the ones who can hold 
it and weave it all together.

Yet pulling your ‘three h’s’ together is only half the battle, with retention 
of high-value workers in an employee’s marketplace equally as critical.

A large-scale Gallup poll last year on employee engagement showed that the 
modern workforce has sophisticated emotional needs when it comes to job 
satisfaction. Key findings included that employees want a strengths-based 
culture, management that has the talent to motivate and the desire to build 
genuine relationships, and a workplace that is invested in its employees as 
people.

The business landscape today is all about building brands that both employees 
and customers want to be associated with – not the other way around.

Build from the customer up

Success may have many parents, but Robert Wickham believes the key to 
unlocking your path to it lies in constructing a customer-centric organisation 
from day one. “What are the personas you are going after, and how do you go 
about it?” he asks.

Wickham believes that the best way to define personas – your target markets – 
is to create a minimum viable transaction rather than a minimum viable product. 
Traditionally, a minimum viable product has meant the smallest and fastest test 
case that you can build to learn the most about your customers. For Wickham, 
it’s about understanding the parameters for the transaction that will get 
potential customers over the line in the first place. Are you offering a 
service that people are actually willing to engage with before they even part 
with their money?

While you’re building up data with MVPs, customer segmentation, and market 
analysis, Wickham cautions that research is more just data. “There’s 
confirmation bias in play, so it takes shoe leather as well. The best ideas are 
from masses of ideas, and then finding the right group to test them on,” he 
says.

Ultimately, Wickham comes back to his belief that the execution is more 
important than the idea. “The great companies are generally the second mover in 
a market. They’ve understood the concept, moved faster, and know the market 
better,” he says. “Look at Facebook and Apple – they just made existing things 
better.”

Companies like Salesforce know a lot about startups – just seventeen years ago 
they were one themselves. Now, they’re the global leader in cloud-based CRM 
systems with clients ranging from family businesses to multinational giants.
