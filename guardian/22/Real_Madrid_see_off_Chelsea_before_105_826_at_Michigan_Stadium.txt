The attendance was less than 4,000 shy of the United States record attendance 
for a soccer match, set two years ago at the same stadium in Ann Arbor when 
109,318 watched Real Madrid and Manchester United square off.

The crowd turned up even though Real Madrid were without stars Karim Benzema, 
out with a hip ailment, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, who both have been 
given time off after Euro 2016.

Brazilian left back Marcelo picked up the slack for Real Madrid with goals in 
the 19th and 26th minutes, and set up Mariano in the 37th minute to put the 
Spanish side ahead 3-0.

Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> substitute Eden Hazard 
scored in the 80th minute and stoppage time to make it close.
