This is what I love about London fashion week: you can rely on this city to 
put the cat among the pigeons.

As Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet says 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/19/london-fashion-week-catwalk-shows-insta-gratification>
, we should be very proud that Burberry planted the British flag in the brave 
new worldof see-now-buy-now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/17/new-york-fashion-week-michael-kors-ready-to-wear-fall-2016-collection-designer>
. This is fashion, so change is always good, right? But, with all due respect 
to the newly appointed dame, Euripides also said that we should question 
everything. And that is exactly what London fashion week did.

At first glance, see-now-buy-now is straightforwardly progressive. As 
Burberry’s Christopher Bailey says, having expanded their audience from the 
hundreds of bums on seats to the virtual millions, catwalk shows now need to 
service that audience. Most people watching the shows are not buying for 
department stores with a year-long business plan in mind, they are buying for 
their own wardrobes and their mind is on what to wear on Saturday.

But is see-now-buy-now really a good thing for the consumer? It will give 
women more opportunities to buy the clothes they want as soon as they see them 
on the catwalk. But that is perhaps in the brands’ interest, not ours. Fashion 
design serves us best not when it gives us what we already know we want in 14 
new colours, but when it expresses something about what we want to wear that we 
hadn’t quite articulated. The subtle joy of the current system is that there is 
a six-month gap when the ideas articulated at fashion week exist only as ideas, 
before they are monetised into retail. Will the kind of fashion that looks 
peculiar at first glance, but stays with us and grows on us until it becomes a 
trend – the most interesting kind – survive in a see-now-buy-now world? The 
London catwalks made a strong case for fashion as ideas, rather than fashion as 
straight-to-retail.

The seven trends of London fashion week

1. Major coats

Shivering on the red carpet is so analogue. Everyone at fashion week is 
lusting after a coat, the bigger the better. As the audience streamed out of
Alexander McQueen <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexander-mcqueen> there 
were as many people lusting over the eiderdown coats as there were over the 
unicorn dress. Coats were the major story at Topshop Unique, always a strong 
sign that the high street will back them as fashion’s major autumn statement. 
(Money, it seems, is no object at Topshop Unique – those luxe caramel ponyskin 
coats ain’t gonna come cheap, Topshop label or no.) At Burberry, the neat 
trench was sidelined in favour of Withnail-scale greatcoats, and 
two-sizes-too-big peacoats.

2. The governess gown

 Governess gown: Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, London fashion week AW16.

Fashion isn’t always in thrall to the bright young things. Ageing gracefully 
is very autumn 2016. This week, the industry honoured the 90th birthday of 
front-row survivorJoan Burstein of Browns boutique 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/21/britians-100-leading-women>
, andHannah Weiland of Shrimps 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/mar/06/shrimps-faux-fur-coats-fashion>
 named her 91-year-old, leopard-print-wearing granny Esther as her ultimate 
muse. On the runway, the governess gown is the new party frock. It’s a bit 
Valentino, a bit Brontë. Look for a flat, square bodice (no decolletage, no 
waist-cinching), an ankle-skimming hemline and long sleeves, luxed-up with 
indulgent fabric and intriguing colours. The governess gown came in a gorgeous 
rich green velvet at Preen, and a dreamy patchwork of lace at Erdem.

3. Pieces of silver

Fashion-as-construction was a running motif of the week. “If you really want 
to create something different, you need to start with function and construction 
– not just change the decoration on top,” said new Mulberry designer Johnny 
Coca. You could tell designers were thinking about construction just by 
looking. Fancy rose gold has been banished and replaced by utilitarian silver 
hardware. Zips gave a cabbage-leaf curl to frilled skirts at JW Anderson, while 
the new Mulberry Bayswater can be taken apart with its press studs. Silver 
studs outlined the gorgeous curving lines of black tailoring at Antonio 
Berardi, while atChristopher Kane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/22/burberry-ready-modernise-fashion-without-delay>
, clothes and handbags were scattered with staples as a minimalist take on 
embellishment.

 Pink coat: Roksanda, London fashion week AW16. Photograph: WWD/Rex/Shutterstock
“On Wednesdays, we wear pink.” Actually, come autumn, we will wear it on 
Monday, Tuesday and every other day of the week, if London fashion week has 
anything to do with it. There was powder-pink quilted satin and rich raspberry 
laceat Alexander McQueen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/21/sarah-burton-brings-alexander-mcqueen-show-london>
, and a serene pink wool coat at Roksanda. Preen’s finger-licking sugar-pink 
cashmere – best of all, the sweater with a gathered seam along the shoulder 
line – was topped by a rich pink, ruched velvet gown. Pink’s unusually strong 
winter-season showing was rivalled only by oxblood, which was looking fine 
everywhere from Mulberry to Roksanda.

5. Highwater frocks

 High-necked cocktail lace dress: Mulberry, London fashion week AW16. 
Photograph: WWD/Rex/Shutterstock 
Your neckline should be just that next season: a line at your neck. Halfway up 
it, in fact. If you thought this season’s ubiquitous polo neck would get the 
chop for next autumn, think again. In fact, the polo neck is now dominating 
eveningwear as well as daywear, and all the fanciest frocks will soon have an 
above-the-collar collar.Mulberry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/21/its-handbags-accessory-labels-do-battle-at-london-fashion-week>
 gave us high-necked cocktail lace, while, at Topshop, a sheer raspberry dress 
was topped with a black pie-crust collar. At House of Holland, a red-and-black 
polo-neck sweater dress was pure 80s glam, while Emilia Wickstead paired a 
ribbed polo-neck sweater with a grand ballskirt, for next party season’s 
warmest (and coolest) dancefloor look.

 Venetian-blind office chic: JW Anderson, London fashion week AW16. Photograph:

Remember when the “bandage dressing”, school of Hervé Léger, was a thing? Next 
autumn, the ties that bind are loosened to give us venetian-blind chic. Think 
vertical ribbons of fabric, with space or sheer lace between them. The fashion 
industry’s beloved pleats, but gone peek-a-boo, in other words. The trend that 
began in New York, at Proenza Schouler, was picked up at London’s most 
fashion-forward labels. At JW Anderson, the venetian-blind look came in white 
for the full office-chic look, while, atChristopher Kane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/christopher-kane>, ribbons of black silk 
fluttered between ivory.

 Showgirl sequins: Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, London fashion week AW16. 
Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock 
This one’s for you if you were worried that sequins were a bit, you know, 
basic. Sequins next season are anything but. The way to wear sequins now is in 
a slightly tongue-in-cheek, Marc Jacobs showgirl way (see Preen’s louche tumble 
of sparkle under a cloud-fluff coat) or in a futuristic, sci-fi way (House of 
Holland revisited the sequin-polo-neck-as-cocktail underpinning, which Raf 
Simons did at Dior two years ago, and we are still not over). The most 
appealingly leftfield idea of all came from Christopher Bailey: a sequinned 
tracksuit top layered under a wool coat is an idea to steal from the boys on 
this season’s Burberry catwalk.
