The search for an easy red lip is an enduring quest. This summer, the answer 
is to lean towards a fresh ripe cherry, as seen at Oscar de la Renta, or 
Vivienne Westwood. Easy, youthful, bright. Whether it’s matte and careful, 
super glossy like an ice-cream topping, or a sheer balm, the aim is to appear 
as though you didn’t spend hours poring over blogs and magazines, as though 
your hand is not striped with a rainbow of reds, as though this lipstick just… 
found you.
