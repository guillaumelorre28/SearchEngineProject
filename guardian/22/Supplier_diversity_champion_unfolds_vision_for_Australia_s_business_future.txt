These are just some of the diverse family businesses Torres Strait Islander 
Leah Armstrong remembers growing up with among her people in the Queensland 
town of Mackay.

Today, as chair of the Federal Government-endorsed Supply Nation, Armstrong 
has taken her early passion for enterprise and used it to work with thousands 
of Indigenous businesses to tap into the mainstream Australian economy as 
suppliers of products and services.

“We are trying to change the mindset that Indigenous business is just about 
arts and culture,” she says. “There are Indigenous businesses in all spheres of 
industry.

I believe in economic development, and sustainability is key for the 
Indigenous community and individuals.

“Supplier diversity is about opening the doors for Indigenous business to give 
them the opportunity to win those tenders and contracts.”

Armstrong is the chair of Supply Nation, a team of specialists across 
Australia who work with businesses to embed diversity into their supply chains 
to help build a prosperous Indigenous business sector.

While she may not be exhibiting venomous snakes like her showman grandfather 
once did, Armstrong’s group represents a wide range of Indigenous business, 
from cutting edge multimedia to security and catering firms.

Growing up, Armstrong was inspired by her family’s activity in Mackay’s 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island groups, helping to offer housing, health 
and legal services to the local Indigenous community.

And so, after first starting work in her stepfather’s picture framing shop, 
she moved to Newcastle in 1991 to begin a new life in the community sector.

It was through her work with the Awabakal Newcastle Aboriginal Cooperative 
that the budding entrepreneur first identified her vision of creating 
sustainable Indigenous business as the “key to breaking the cycle of 
disadvantage”.

“Entrepreneurial development is something I’ve grown up around,” she says. “I 
believe in economic development, and sustainability is key for the Indigenous 
community and individuals.

“We saw the gap that needed to be filled was around sustainable employment and 
commercially viable business that would generate income. It was trying to break 
that cycle of welfare and government dependency.”

To this end, in 1992 Armstrong co-founded Yarnteen Ltd, a successful 
Indigenous business and social enterprise that she grew over two decades to 
operate ventures that include bulk warehousing, a car wash, a building company 
and a registered training organisation.

The idea for Indigenous supplier diversity was reported in the 2008 inquiry by 
The Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs’ that 
focused on the development of Indigenous enterprises in Australia.

Taking initial inspiration and advice from the successful supplier diversity 
movement in the US, Armstrong helped set up the Australian Indigenous Minority 
Supply Council in 2009, now trading as Supply Nation.

Supply Nation certifies Indigenous-owned businesses based on criteria that 
specify that at least 51% of the shareholders and the majority of the board as 
well as the corporate head need to be Indigenous.

Armstrong says Australia is fortunate that its major corporations understand 
the movement and are committed to it through Reconciliation Action Plans – 
evident in the work of Supply Nation member companies like National Australia 
Bank (NAB).

“NAB is a founding member of Supply Nation and they commit to a target for 
procurement from certified Indigenous suppliers,” she says. “NAB has a real 
ambition around shared value, to benefit both the company and the Indigenous 
business community.

“I believe the banking sector understands that there is a growing market out 
there to engage with and build relationships with - and NAB has been at the 
forefront of that.”

Armstrong says supplier diversity brings a greater range of ideas to the table 
to foster greater innovation, and helps grow the business customer base and 
Indigenous-employment as well.

“What gets me up in the morning are stories about Indigenous success,” she 
says. “When I hear about and see Indigenous business excelling I think we need 
to highlight more of this Indigenous success and achievement.

“It’s important to be aware of, and acknowledge, disadvantage - but that’s 
what always gets pushed out about Indigenous Australia. It’s important for our 
younger generations to break that mindset.”

Armstrong herself has been recognised with a number of major business 
leadership awards and holds several board positions, including with Career 
Trackers, a group which is opening up pathways for Indigenous university 
students to internships and jobs at places like NAB.

She is also a member of the Prime Minister’s Indigenous Advisory Council, 
chairs the Aboriginal Housing Office NSW and has held previous positions with 
Reconciliation Australia and Indigenous Business Australia.

She attributes her success to an open and honest approach in the way she goes 
about business, together with the humility she says is part of her cultural 
background.

With more than 12,000 Indigenous businesses nationally ranging from “mum and 
dad” operations to multi-million dollar ventures, Armstrong says the message 
for business is they should think more broadly about their procurement.

“There can be an Indigenous supplier for everything from pens and paper to 
telecommunications and solar energy,” she says. “There is potentially an 
Indigenous-owned business that can provide that service or product.”
