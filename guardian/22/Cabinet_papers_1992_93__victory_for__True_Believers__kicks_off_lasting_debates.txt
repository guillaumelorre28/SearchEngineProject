While Meat Loaf was singing “I would do anything for love but I won’t do 
that”, Australian voters were sending a similar message to cleanskin Liberal 
opposition leader John Hewson during the March election.

I would do anything for change, but I won’t do that.

Well before the 1993 election, Hewson, an economist, presented what was then a 
radical and detailed policy change in his Fightback! package. It included a 
goods and services tax, a Medicare co-payment and an end to the dole for the 
longer-term unemployed.

As [Britain] walked out on you and joined the Common Market, you were still 
looking for your MBEs and your knighthoods
Paul Keating, to John Howard and John Hewson 
By contrast, Paul Keating 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/paul-keating2>, a long-term 
treasurer who had been prime minister for less than 18 months, developed a 
political and economic plan that contained ironclad, L-A-W tax cuts. Three 
years before Pauline Hanson’s political career began, Keating dubbed his plan 
One Nation.

The contest in March 1993 became the True Believers’ election, when Keating 
surprised everyone, including his own cabinet, byincreasing his majority from 
eight to 13 seats 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/FedElect>
. Voters were to receive only half the L-A-W tax cuts – with the rest delivered 
via superannuation.

After a tough budget, the government slumped and began the long slide to the 
1996 Howard victory.

But the 1992-93 cabinet documents, released on 1 January by the National 
Archives, show a government still proposing economic change around industrial 
relations, women’s participation, childcare reform and superannuation, but also 
moving to substantial social change.

The documents only cover advice going into cabinet and not the discussions 
held within. (In the same years, cabinet agreed to close the notebooks of those 
conversations for 50 years.)

In many ways, the early 90s set up many of the debates that continue today, as 
government started to reach out to identifiable groups.

The Mabo native title issue was resolved with much political sweat and capital 
from Keating. The rights of the more marginalised came to the fore, with 
changes aimed at promoting women’s participation in the workforce, the lifting 
of the ban on gay and lesbian people in the defence forces and adding 
vilification as an offence to the Racial Discrimination Act.

Keating had announced in 1992 that there would be no more recommendations for 
British awards such as knights and dames. In the same year, cabinet agreed to 
change the oath of allegiance to “modernise the way citizens give expression to 
their commitment to Australia”, removing the reference to swearing allegiance 
to the Queen. The submission noted that the move was expected to be welcomed by 
many, although with strong criticism from anti-republican groups.


Keating began to prosecute a fierce brand of nationalism, accusing Hewson and 
John Howard <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/john-howard> of a 
cultural cringe and “tugging the forelock” to Britain after Hewson suggested 
the prime minister had never learned respect at school.

“I learned about self-respect and self-regard for Australia – not about some 
cultural cringe to a country which decided not to defend the Malayan peninsula, 
not to worry about Singapore and not to give us our troops back to keep 
ourselves free from Japanese domination,”Keating said in parliament 
<http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1992-02-27%2F0094%22>
.

“This was the country that you people wedded yourself to, and even as it 
walked out on you and joined the Common Market, you were still looking for your 
MBEs and your knighthoods, and all the rest of the regalia that comes with it.

“You would take Australia right back down the time tunnel to the cultural 
cringe where you have always come from.”

The following year, Keating appointed Malcolm Turnbull to head the republic 
advisory committee, to consider the various options open to Australia were it 
to decide to replace the Queen as head of state.

The committee 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp9899/99RP25>
 reported options but at the 1996 election Howard promised a people’s 
convention, which was held in 1998. He then took an option to a constitutional 
referendum, at which the republic was defeated.

Women <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> were receiving special 
attention in budget papers under the eye of Keating’s political adviser Anne 
Summers, who was brought in after polls showed the prime minister had low 
support among women.


Policies were assessed on how they would affect women and there was 
recognition in cabinet that “future growth in the economy will be highly 
dependent on women’s participation”. That started to drive education and 
childcare policies.

Cabinet removed the right to dismiss women on the grounds of family 
responsibility and approved a move to allow complaints of discrimination 
against women in the workplace to go to the sex discrimination commissioner.

Ministers also considered laws on racial vilification and violence in response 
to anational inquiry into racist violence 
<https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/document/publication/NIRV.pdf>
 and the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody.

The then attorney general, Michael Duffy, reported to cabinet that while 
racial violence in Australia was nowhere near the levels in Europe, there was 
no cause for complacency. While he recommended against creating specific laws 
for racial violence, he recommended laws for racial vilification would play a 
role in educating the community.


“By proscribing certain beliefs and acts as antisocial, warranting the 
imposition of legal sanctions for a breach of community standards in this 
regard, we would deny emphatically whatever legitimacy may have been afforded 
so far to racist views because of government inaction and community 
indifference,” Duffy wrote.

Echoing the concerns in the current debate over section 18C 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/08/government-to-launch-free-speech-inquiry-into-section-18c-of-the-racial-discrimination-act>
, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet supported the recommendations 
about vilification but warned against support of the creation of a criminal 
offence for “dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred”.

“The wording of the proposed offence will have to be very carefully considered 
to ensure that the restriction on freedom of speech, which it necessarily 
involves, only goes as far as necessary to achieve the desired aim,” the 
department advised.

The Racial Hatred Act 1994 
<http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill_em/rhb1994119/memo_0.html> passed 
the following year amid a public debate every bit as controversial as the 
current debate around 18C.

records, copies of key cabinet documents, including selected submissions and
