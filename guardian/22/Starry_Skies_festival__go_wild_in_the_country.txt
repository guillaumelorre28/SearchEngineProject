Before we left, George’s mum made me swear not to let our six-year-old-son out 
of my sight for the duration of the festival. Even as I was nodding in 
agreement I knew keep this promise would be almost impossible – but I didn’t 
reckon on breaking it quite so spectacularly or, as things turned out, so 
willingly.

Before I’d even finished putting our tent up on the festival site, George was 
making new friends with kids a few pitches down. Fifteen minutes later, he came 
and asked me, his face aglow with excitement, if he could go and explore the 
forest with Ravi and Jasper, his new mates – on their own!

The Starry Skies slogan, “where kids runs free”, may sound like bland 
marketing-speak, but it encapsulates perfectly the appeal of this small family 
festival on the Welsh-English border. When I went to check on George on the 
scramble nets in the woods 10 minutes later, his sense of freedom at doing 
something that he’d never done before was palpable.

The scale of the festival, just 250 families over three fields, means your 
kids are never that far away, and the central area feels more like a village 
green under canvas than a festival site. The main giant tipi, where most of the 
live music (local bands rather than big names) and kids’ disco happens, is 
surrounded by a dozen or more other tents and marquees, acting as everything 
from a kids’ cinema (a sanctuary when it rained) to the festival shop – where 
prices are no higher than your local corner shop. (There’s a refreshing lack of 
commercialisation all round – the beer tent had a good selection of hand-pulled 
ales and ciders for £4; a food van did wood-fired pizzas for a fiver.) From 
here our campsite was only a three-minute, lantern-lit stroll through the woods.

But though the site itself is compact, the hillside setting feels unbounded, 
thanks to the view of the Black Mountains seemingly afloat at the end of the 
field. It’s a gorgeous, idyllic backdrop for a festival.

Kids as young as five can explore this countryside on guided forest walks (no 
adults allowed) where they learn to build dens and light fires – but George was 
always too busy doing something else to go on one.

Clay model-making, farm tours, circus skills, water slides, storytelling, 
stargazing, tug-of-war and five-a-side football are some of the many free 
activities dotted around various tents, fields and forest clearings. Our 
favourite was the Woodland Tribe, where we baked our own bread by wrapping 
dough around a stick and holding it in a campfire, and kids can use hammers, 
saws, nails, wood, rope and their imagination to build whatever they wanted – 
mostly swords to fight each other with.

There are also extras you can pay for, like canoeing, and yoga for adults, but 
there were more than enough free activities to keep us occupied for four days. 
With more to actually do rather than to watch, Starry Skies feels more like an 
uber camping holiday than a festival – a fabulous site with loads of organised 
play and entertainment thrown in. In fact, there’s no reason why it couldn’t 
run for the whole school summer holidays, with different families coming and 
going each week. It’s an idea the organisers hope to realise in the future.

For me the best thing about it wasn’t all the organised fun, it was seeing the 
joy on George’s face at being able to run wild and unsupervised – a sense of 
freedom I took for granted at his age but, where we live at least, is now sadly 
missing. He still talks about his Starry Skies friends, and we’ve already 
bought our tickets for this year’s event. George says he’ll see you there, 
Jasper and Ravi.

lovely Pippingford Park this year, there are endless activities (baby 
bouldering, mud-hut building, archery), the music line-up’s lively (London

options (including glamping) complete the picture.

Combining mid-summer surf and an impressive line-up, this festival is lots of 
fun, particularly for older kids. Overlooking Croyde Bay and run by surfer 
brothers Shaun and Warren Latham, there’s everything from beach volleyball to 
circus-skill sessions, and pop-up cocktail bar and craft cider and ale tent for 
the grown-ups. There are big names (KT Tunstall, the Cuban Brothers and DJ 
Fresh) among this year’s artists. Camping’s not included, so book nearby. The 
Ruda Holiday Park (parkdeanholidays.co.uk 
<http://www.parkdeanholidays.co.uk/devon-holidays/ruda/ruda-holiday-park.htm>) 
has caravans sleeping six from £389.
