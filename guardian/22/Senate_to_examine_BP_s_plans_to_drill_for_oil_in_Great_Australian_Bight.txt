A Senate inquiry will investigate BP’s plans to drill for oil in the Great 
Australian Bight and examine how a spill could be dealt with.

The Wilderness Society South Australia director, Peter Owen, said BP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bp> should wait until after the inquiry 
had reported in May before it submitted its new application.

BP was responsible for the world’s biggest oil spill in 2010, at the Deepwater 
Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico. The Deepwater Horizon was drilling in 1,500 
metres of water 70km off the coast when it leaked. In the Great Australian 
Bight, BP plans to drill at depths of 2,200 metres, about 300km from its 
closest port.

The independent senator Nick Xenophon and the Greens senator Robert Simms 
instigated the inquiry, supported by Labor and the crossbenchers Glenn Lazarus 
and Jacqui Lambie.

“BP must be held to account for its shocking environmental record and poor 
community consultation,” Simms said. “BP’s initial submission to drill for oil 
off the Great Australian Bight was turned down by the regulator, NOPSEMA, and 
it is high time this issue was put under the microscope.”

 a spill from BP’s proposed oil wells could affect most of Australia’s southern 
coastline, shutting down fisheries and threatening wildlife including whales, 
seabirds and sea lions.
