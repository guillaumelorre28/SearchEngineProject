All prices are for food only

In recent years Spain’s culinary scene has created a number of true food 
heroes: fromFerran Adrià <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ferran-adria>
’s molecular magic at the famed elBulli (which closed in 2011) andJuan Mari and 
Elena Arzak’s incredible reinvention

of Basque specialities to Andoni Aduriz’sexquisite minimalism in the middle of 
the Basque countryside 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/18/mugaritz-spain-chef-andoni-luis-arduriz>
. Unfortunately, such high-end establishments are now too expensive for most 
us. So is there a way to enjoy Spain’s top cuisine at more affordable prices? 
Yes, as it happens, by tracking down the latest generation of chefs and getting 
a taste of their cooking before fame (or notoriety) takes them to the next 
level.

At the annual Madrid Fusión <http://www.madridfusion.net/index.php?lang=EN> 
convention, which takes place from 25-27 January, many of Spain’s best chefs 
(as well as invited Thai and Filipino chefs for 2016) hold cooking 
demonstrations, test new ideas and host workshops around a theme or ingredient 
in front of fellow professionals and the public. Ever since it started in 2003, 
it has played a major role in the blossoming of Spanish restaurants. One of 
several prestigious awards showcases six young talents who have been selected 
to compete for the title of Revelation Chef, 2016. Checking out their 
restaurants is a fine excuse for a gourmet journey across the peninsula, 
without breaking the bank.

This cool, small gastro-bar in the uptown Eixample district is where 
29-year-old Ana Merino has been wowing Barcelona’s foodies since 2013. Mont Bar 
is efficiently orchestrated by Merino’s husband, Iván Castro. As for the chef 
herself, Santander-born Merino’s experience of working with top Catalan chefs 
Carles Abellan and Carme Ruscalleda shows in her exciting, creative style. 
Although anchored in organic Mediterranean ingredients, the tight, seasonal 
menu has Asian twists, revisits traditional tapas such ascroquetas, and 
features inventive dishes like prawn cappuccino. Outstanding small plates range 
from cod fritters with quince aioli to chilled almond and coconut soup with 
mackerel and kumquat. The bar has 250 wines: try the excellent Pago de 
Capellanes’s crianza at €6.90 a glass. Small plates from €12, tapas €2-€7.

Famed for its wayward mercenary son, El Cid, and its gothic cathedral, Burgos 
is considered an ultra-traditional Castilian city. But on the culinary front 
it’s all change thanks to the current local upstart, 31-year-old Ricardo 
Termiño. He spearheaded a fresher approach in 2014, by breaking with food 
traditions in a conservative city, when he opened La Fábrica. The restaurant is 
a cool, sophisticated and minimalist place, with a seven-course 
seasonally-influenced tasting menu for €36, where you find blue fin tuna 
tataki, tender partridge and truffle ravioli, wagyu beef, hake with peppers, 
and lobster cannelloni. Budget-eaters can opt for the €16 four-course weekday 
menu, served as impeccably as the pricier version. A la carte is about €35-€40.

From Bilbao it takes just over an hour, driving through green Basque hills, to 
the remote valley of Carranza. Here lies Casa Garras, an unpretentious family 
restaurant in a tiny town, very different from the other Revelation 
contestants. Great tapas andraciones (€5-€8) are served at a large downstairs 
bar, but go upstairs to indulge in delicious, seasonal dishes from the pans of 
Txema Llamosas, the third generation of this food-obsessed family. You’ve come 
this far to eat at the table of a chef who has worked with both Adrià and 
Arzak, the two greats of Spain’s gastro-revolution. Push the boat out and order 
the 10-course, €62 tasting menu. If not, the €44 menu may feature a creamy cod 
salad with potato, poached onion, tomato and mayonnaise or a succulent local 
sirloin steak with wild mushroom foam.

Galicia is renowned for sumptuous seafood that almost leaps from the Atlantic 
onto the plate, something that local chef Alberto Lareo showcases at his 
restaurant, Manso, opened in 2013. But he is equally aware of the quality of 
Galician beef, of wild mushrooms and the wealth of organic vegetables grown in 
this lush, windswept region. Although trained in Santiago, Lareo gained 
experience working in France, which is evident in his meticulous presentation. 
Try the squid ink croquetas, grilled sea bass with saffron and clementine jus, 
or cabbage with egg yolk, truffle and almond cream. Manso may not be 
particularly trendy, nor in the medieval heart of Santiago, but that keeps the 
swarms of pilgrims at bay. It’s well worth seeking out for the great value €15 
lunch menu, or a €30-€40 dinner.

As all roads lead to Madrid, there has to be a representative from the Spanish 
capital and this one, opened only a year ago, is pretty funky. Award-winning 
30-year-old chef Javier Estévez, originally from Galicia, specialises in “fine 
offal” (beef, lamb or pork), which is served in this airy, industrial-style 
tavern of exposed brick walls and suspended bulbs in the well-heeled Salamanca 
district. Small plates (€8-€10) combine ingredients such as sweetbreads and 
chestnuts, baby pig’s tail, eel and cheese, or pig’s trotters, artichoke and 
crayfish. The menu also has modish Kilner jars (containing, for example, 
partridge and apple with sherry) if you want to bypass the offal, and desserts 
such as cheesecake with liquorice and beetroot. Budget on €25-€35 for dinner.

Traditionally, Valencia means paella – from the rice fields south of Spain’s 
dynamic third-largest city – but at Lienzo your rice is more likely to come as 
a duck and octopus risotto or envelop kid goat with black lime (Persian loomi). 
At this smart, modern restaurant the dishes invented by chef Maria José 
Martinez combine unexpected flavours and impressive technique with minute 
attention to detail. It’s not a surprise to learn that Martinez worked with 
three-Michelin-starred chef Quique Dacosta, at El Poblet, also in Valencia – a 
somewhat pricier stop-off. Lienzo’s self-styled “gastrotapas’ menu (€27) might 
include “crack” roast beef, black garlic and red onion caviar, or treat 
yourself to the chef’s menu (€55). Piglet with charred leeks and pak choi is 
just one highlight. A la carte it’s about €35-€40 (without wine), and the lunch 
menu just €19.
