It’s spirit that turns table wine into port, spirit that turns crisis into 
creativity and spirit that allows dignity to flourish among Porto’s glamorous 
dereliction. Here the Douro river pushes into the cold Atlantic and the city 
sits on one steep riverbank, with its thrusting towers and opulent city hall, 
its people defiant of austerity. The past defines much of Porto’s look, but her 
people have found a way to get on and look forward with hope and panache.

Stunning blue-tiled 14th-century churches and 19th-century palaces lie all but 
abandoned. There are Meccano bridges designed by Gustave Eiffel. Grand art deco 
theatres sail like pale liners over the city’s cobbled hills, and great modern 
buildings rise like phoenixes. There are green parks and shady silent squares, 
seaside and riverbank, wealth and poverty – and all in a walkable city.

The Baixa district is postcard Porto, rising from the riverbank – all pitched 
terracotta roofs and stucco painted in shades of mustard, Elastoplast and 
estuarine grey. At night it glows like honeycomb. Across the river is Vila Nova 
de Gaia, where 1950s signs on port lodges proclaim old English names – 
Cockburn’s, Graham’s and Croft.

And there’s the seaside. Empty surf beaches lie a few minutes from the city 
centre. South of Gaia, the fishing villages are salty and sweary; on the Porto 
side of the river, Foz do Douro is a posh suburb where the river meets the 
ocean and, further north, Matosinhos offers rock-cut swimming pools, sunsets 
and superb fish dinners.

Porto’s life and soul is on her hilly streets, in the many hipster bars and 
smoky cafes, in portions of tasty food and drinks that are huge and 
silly-cheap, in a pace of life where a gentle stroll is full speed ahead and a 
commitment to slow food makes meals lingering and rhythmic.

Getting around the city is a cinch: you stroll, or buy an Andante ticket (€15 
for 3 days,stcp.pt 
<http://www.stcp.pt/en/travel/tariffs/multimodal-andante-tickets/>) and jump on 
any bus, metro or train.

 Casa da Música. Photograph: Kevin Gould 
The Casa da Música <http://www.casadamusica.com/> concert hall (auditorium and 
backstage visits from €6, performance tickets around €15) is perhaps Dutch 
architect Rem Koolhaas’ best building. It’s four stops from Metro Trinidade 
station, a five-star stunner.

The 15th-century Igreja (church) de Santa Clara, on Largo 1 de Dezembro, is 
impressively ornate.Igreja de São Francisco on Rua Infante Don Henrique is 
gothic outside and Liberace-baroque within. And if so much ecclesiastical 
culture (and gilt!) is quite enough for one morning, chill out atHorto das 
Virtudes, the peaceful park below São António hospital.

Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art 
<http://serralves.pt/en/thinking/visit/guided-tours-in-portuguese-sign-language//museum/the-museum/>
 (€8.50) is Portugal’s most important modern art museum. The building, filled 
with light and shade, was designed by local architecture god Siza Vieira (he’s 
82 and still working). As well as exhibitions, there’s a cinema, a performance 
space and a huge, elegant park.

 (€5, €2.50 concessions, free first Sunday of every month) is a house on a

panelling.

The Military Museum 
<http://www.exercito.pt/sites/MusMilPORTO/Paginas/default.aspx> (€3.50) is

 Taberna do São Pedro in Afurada, a fishing village just west of Porto.

Vila Nova de Gaia, or simply Gaia, is on the south side of the Douro and home 
to the city’s famous port lodges. The best of the tasting tours is atGraham’s 
<http://www.grahams-port.com/visit-grahams-lodge/the-grahams-1890-lodge> (from 
€8, Rua Rei Ramiro 514, +351 223 776 484) and its in-lodgeVinum restaurant 
<http://www.grahams-port.com/visit-grahams-lodge/the-grahams-1890-lodge#slider/2>
 is very good, too.Niepoort <http://www.niepoort-vinhos.com/en/> (Rua Cândida 
dos Reis 598 +351 223 777 777) doesn’t do tourist tours but visits on request 
are sometimes possible if you ask nicely – the emphasis is on its excellent 
table wines as well as port.

An hour’s walk (or 10-minute cycle) along the riverside boardwalk towards the 
Atlantic is Afurada, an entirely authentic fishing village. Eat perfectly 
grilled fish and listen to the salty backchat atTaberna do São Pedro (Rua Costa 
Goodolfim 42, +351 220 993 883). There’s an ad hoc ferry service across to 
Porto, and regular buses, too.

 BASE at Passeio dos Clérigos. 
There’s great eating and drinking all over Porto. Starting east of Porto’s 
centre,Maus Hábitos <http://www.maushabitos.com/> (Rua Passos Manuel 178, 4th 
floor, +351 222 087 268), which means bad habits, is a hip space on the roof of 
an art deco car park. The restaurant serves brunches, lunches (€5 and up), 
dinners and great pizza, such as the Nan Goldin, which is topped with artisan 
smoked bacon and confit onions. There are regular exhibitions and talks, plus 
nightly DJs playing everything from shoegazers to jazz funk. A few doors away 
at number 137,Passos Manuel <http://passosmanuel.net/> (+351 222 058 351) is an 
art cinema and bar.

South on Muralha Fernandina (the eastern city wall above the Eiffel bridge) is 
community-runGuindalense Futebol Clube 
<https://www.facebook.com/GUINDALENSE-FUTEBOL-CLUBE-119607128123564/timeline/> 
(+351 222 034 426), a convivial, welcoming cafe-bar. Posh it’s not. But its 
terrace offers the city’s most jaw-dropping views, and beers and coffees cost 
around 50 cents a throw. Food is simple and sturdy: a full-onfrancesinha 
(Porto’s massive doorstep sandwich, layered with a pork, smoked sausage, bacon 
and a medium rare steak, topped with an egg and a thick overcoat of cheese), 
hot dog or burger is around €6. There are occasional fado music nights; book 
ahead for carnival nights and New Year’s Eve fireworks.

O Buraco 
<https://www.facebook.com/Restaurante-O-Buraco-161956973839602/timeline/> (Rua 
do Bolhão 95, +351 222 006 717) is fun, reliable and offers “food like grandma 
used to make”, such as frango pica no chão cabidela (chicken-and-rice stew with 
chicken blood). Her grandkids must have had huge appetites.
 Cantina 32 
South of São Bento railway station (with its stunning azulejo tile panels), 
Cantina 32 <http://www.cantina32.com/> (Rua das Flores 32, +351 222 039 069) is 
a friendly, attractive place with appealing options for vegetarians. A few 
doors downhill,Mercearia das Flores <http://www.merceariadasflores.com/> (Rua 
das Flores 110, +351 222 083 232) is a deli crammed with local products and 
wines whose kitchen produces very good brunches, salads and sandwiches.

On the roof of posh mini-mall Passeio dos Clérigos 
<http://passeiodosclerigos.pt/en/> is BASE <https://www.facebook.com/baseporto> 
(+351 910 076 920), Porto’s coolest hangout: open from 10am to 2am, it offers a 
full menu from the restaurant below, plus sunloungers, jute coffee beanbags 
beneath olive trees, beautiful people, fresh juices (€3), sushi (€11) and 
rocket-y sandwiches (from €6). It’s closed in cool or wet weather.

Don’t miss Miss’Opo <http://www.missopo.com/> (Rua das Caldeireros 100, +351 
222 082 179), a buzzy restaurant, exhibition space, guesthouse and shop. A meal 
of small plates likesalada bonita (pretty salad), grilled swordfish, umami 
mushrooms, good bread and sausage plus wine costs around €20 a head.

Beardy and hip, Café Candelabro <http://cafecandelabro.blogspot.co.uk/> (Rua 
da Conceição 3) is a bar with simple snacks plus a bookshop – specialising in 
offbeat cinema, photography, theatre and art – in one cool, small space. The 
barman has a heavy hand (cocktails from €4) and a DJ crouches in the corner 
most nights.

For fine dining at casual cost, Traça <http://www.restaurantetraca.com/> 
(Largo São Domingos 88, +351 222 081 065) serves slow food with an emphasis on 
game and old regional recipes. Dance your dinner off atPipa Velha 
<https://pt-br.facebook.com/pipavelha> (Rua das Oliveiras 75, +351 223 222 
780), which started the trend for cool downtown bars; it has excellent drinks, 
sturdy snacks and is open until 4am.

Towards the trendy area around Rua Miguel Bombarda, I love Casa de Ló 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Casa-de-L%C3%B3/170731029651860> (Travessa de 
Cedofeita 20A, +351 914 900 409), a former bakery reimagined as a bar and 
garden that puts on unplugged concerts and nightly DJ sets. Also recommended is 
Casa Santo António <https://www.facebook.com/tascagourmet> (Rua da Assunção 40, 
+351 938 704 632), a “gourmet tasca” with a friendly vibe and great regional 
ingredients – tryalheira, a smoked chicken or game sausage.

 Gelateria Sincelo 
In Foz, upscale-ish Bar Tolo 
<https://www.facebook.com/events/1400577096927151/> (Rua Senhora da Luz 185) 
offers everything frompetiscos (bar snacks) to full meals. Round the corner, 
Bite Me <https://www.facebook.com/letsbite> (Rua do Teatro 133) is a fine 
brunch spot above the Espaço 7 Trendstore.

For one of Portugal’s finest meals, head out to Restaurante Boa Nova 
<http://ruipaula.com/web/?lang=en> (Avenida da Liberdade +351 229 940 066) in 
Matosinhos, north of Foz. This rocktop beauty is a restored 1950s tea house 
built by local architect Alváro Siza Vieira, just up from the incredible 
swimming pools the architect cut into the raw rock. Delicious, modern food is 
served with élan in a sublimely poetic setting.

Porto is in love with ice-cream just now. The best is at Gelataria Sincelo 
<http://www.gelatariasincelo.com/> (Rua de Ceuta 54), which uses fresh 
ingredients from the nearby Bolhão market. Uncool, and to be avoided, is the 
famous Café Majestic; though campily pretty, it’s pricey and rammed with 
tourists and their selfie sticks. Equally, the Ribeira – riverside – district 
is prime tourist territory, a sort of pseudo-Porto.

Mercado do Bolhão, the colourful market that sells everything, has the best 
fruit and veg, plus excellent charcuteries and butchers, a couple of lunch 
spots (try Cafe D) and three tea towel sellers. The surrounding streets have 
plenty of delis, too.

A Vida Portuguesa <http://www.avidaportuguesa.com/> (Rua Galeria de Paris 20, 
1st floor) is a glamorous old department store that carries the best and most 
attractive Portuguese foods and handicrafts.

At Lobo Taste <https://www.facebook.com/Lobo-Taste-175769559115251/timeline/> 
(Largo de São Domingos 20), local star designer Paulo Lobo employs local 
artisans to groove up traditional designs for blankets, baskets and other 
desirable craftware.Coração Alecrim <https://www.facebook.com/coracaoalecrim> 
(Travessa de Cedofeita 28) sells pretty eco, indie and vintage clothes and 
homewares.Mercado 48 <http://mercado48.pt/> (Rua da Conceição 48) has vintage 
rosewood furniture, craft ceramics and nice knick-knacks. Fresh and exciting is 
Scar.ID <http://scar-id.com/en/> (Rua do Rosário 253), a treasure trove of 
young Portuguese jewellery, ceramics, furniture and clothing.

Livraria Lello <https://www.facebook.com/pages/Livraria-Lello/169878093074664> 
(Rua das Carmelitas 144k) is a bookshop in an incredible art nouveau building. 
Its interior is usually rammed with visitors snapping the amazing surroundings, 
so it now charges €3 to get in (redeemable against a purchase).
