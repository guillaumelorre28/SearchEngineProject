The estate agent Foxtons <https://www.theguardian.com/business/foxtons> is 
braced for weaker sales in the coming months as buyers become jittery in the 
face of mounting uncertainty over Britain’s future in Europe.

The London-focused agent said the possibility of Brexit in the run-up to the 
EU referendum <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> in June was 
expected to weigh on its first-half results.

Nic Budden, Foxtons’ chief executive, said: “We expect the first half of the 
year to be challenging with a reduced sales pipeline entering into the second 
quarter and the underlying short-term impact on transaction volumes from the 
uncertainty around the European referendum.”

Investors 'rushing to snap up homes before buy-to-let tax comes in'

Foxtons reported a strong first quarter with sales boosted as investors rushed 
to buy properties before the government imposed a new stamp duty surcharge on 
second homes

.

The company, known for its fleet of minis and cafe-style offices, reported a 
16.2% increase in revenue to £38.4m in the first quarter to 31 March.

The revenue rise was mainly driven by a 28.5% increase in property sales 
commissions as investors went ahead with their purchases before the new 
surcharge was introduced on 1 April.

Under the new rules, anyone buying a property for more than £40,000 to let or 
use as a holiday home will pay stamp duty on the purchase at a rate three 
percentage points higher than the standard rate.

“We have had a strong start to the year with a record first quarter driven by 
a number of sales transactions being brought forward before the introduction of 
the additional stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let properties,” Budden said.


However, because completions were brought forward to beat the stamp duty 
deadline, Foxtons said the sales pipeline for the second quarter was lower than 
it was a year ago.

Lettings revenue was flat in the first three months of the year, as tenants 
renewed existing contracts and entered into longer tenancy periods.

Revenue at Alexander Hall, Foxtons’ mortgage broker, increased 57.6% over the 
period.

Budden said the company was pressing ahead with expansion plans, as it 
increases market share in parts of outerLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>. Foxtons opened four new branches 
during the quarter, in Loughton, New Malden, Sutton and Fulham, taking its 
total to 62.

It plans to open three more branches in 2016, all outside central London’s 
zone 1.

Earlier this month Foxtons awarded Budden a pay rise of at least 19% after he 
stepped into the breach when his predecessor resigned for personal reasons.

Budden’s basic wage for this year will be £550,000, up from £461,250 in 2015, 
while his maximum bonus will rise from 125% of salary to a maximum of 150%.

Including bonuses and share incentive payments, Budden’s total pay packet 
could hit £2.3m for this year compared with the £856,000 he received last year.
