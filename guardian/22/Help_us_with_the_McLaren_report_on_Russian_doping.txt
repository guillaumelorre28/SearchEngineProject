A report by the respected Canadian law professor Richard McLaren on behalf of 
the World Anti-Doping Agency found evidence thatmore than 1,000 Russian 
athletes across over 30 sports – including football – were involved in or 
benefited from state-sponsored doping

 between 2011 and 2015.

He said the London 2012 Olympics were “corrupted on an unprecedented scale” by 
Russia’s government and sports authorities, who colluded to ensure the 
country’s athletes were able to take a cocktail of banned performance-enhancing 
drugs yet evade doping tests.

The second report from McLaren was published online
