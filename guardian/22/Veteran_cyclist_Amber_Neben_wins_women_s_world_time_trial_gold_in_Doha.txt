Summary

Well, that was as unpredictable as ever. Amber Neben, who at the age of four 
survived a bout of spinal meningitis which left her in a coma for three days 
and doctors fearing brain damage if she survived, has become a double world 
champion. It was a stunning performance and completes an incredible year for US 
women’s time trialling, after Kristin Armstrong’s gold in Rio. Ellen van Dijk 
came up just short yet again, but her epic battle with Neben was the highlight 
of the race. Katrin Garfoot found something in the final couple of kilometres 
to win bronze, and deny Annemiek van Vleuten a fairytale medal. Thanks for your 
time.

Neben speaks

A delighted but emotionally spent Amber Neben says: “It’s unbelievable. Was a 
long wait. I think I used more energy sitting there [waiting for the other 
riders to finish than i did on the bike. I was so nervous. It was so hard to 
watch. I feel for Ellen but am so excited for myself. The difference today was 
the mental perserverence. This one was more special because of everything that 
has happened between 2008 and now.”

Amber Neben wins gold

That’s it. Van der Breggen finishes a catastrophic ride two min 11sec behind 
the new world champion. What a ride from the American, who won this title eight 
years ago and was not thought to be among the contenders at the age of 41.

Final standings: 

1) Neben (US) 


2) Van Dijk (Neth) 

3) Garfoot (Aus)

Brennauer trails home in sixth

Neben is almost there. She can afford to smile now. Another of her potential 
rivals cannot match her time, and does not even make the medals. Brennauer will 
be disappointed with that

Garfoot moves into bronze medal position

Garfoot finishes strongly and takes third position, for now at least. She dug 
deep there in the late stages to go one better than her fourth in this race 
last year. Zabelinskaya fades into fourth, and Amialiusik has dropped out of 
the picture.

Garfoot and Zabelinskaya the remaining challengers

The four-rider threat to the gold medal seems to be down to two. Brennauer, 
like Van der Breggen, is struggling badly. Garfoot and Zabelinskaya are holding 
their form well, but nobody knows how much it is taking out of them to stay up 
with pace. Or how fast Neben went over the second half of the race.

Van der Breggen miles off the pace

Anna van der Breggen, supposedly the favourite for this race, is a huge 24 
seconds off the lead at the first time check. Is she suffering in the heat? We 
haven’t mentioned that for a while. It’s the action that’s reaching boiling 
point. Garfoot and Zabelinskaya are 10sec behind Neben, Brennauer a further 
3sec back. Neben looks comfortable at the finish right now, but further ahead 
the Belarusian Alena Amialiusik is on the move. Could she be a surprise medal 
threat?

Battle for medals

There are probably only four women who can deny Neben now, and they are taking 
to the track. The German-born Australia’s Katrin Garfoot won the Chrono 
Champenois, the dress rehearsal for this event, last month. The Russian Olga 
Zabelinskaya won silver in the Rio Olympic time trial, after returning from a 
doping ban. Germany’s Lisa Brennauer won the world title in 2014. And Anna van 
der Breggen of the Netherlands has probably been the most impressive female 
time triallist this season. They are all on the track now, their task; to 
disrupt the current top three:

1) Neben: 36:37.04


2) Van Dijk +6sec

3) Van Vleuten +25sec

Van Dijk moves into second after nearly falling

Van Dijk is hurting. She is rocking on the bike, shoulders weaving from side 
to side. She does not look comfortable and she nearly falls off. Has it cost 
her? Yes! She finishes 5.99sec off Neben. She’s in silver position, but that 
won’t please her. She wanted gold, and gave everything out there. But it wasn’t 
enough. Can Neben hold on for the title?

Van Dijk slips behind Neben’s pace again

This really is a see-saw tussle, potentially for gold. At the 2km to go mark 
Van Dijk and Neben are dead level. This is a very flat course but there is a 
bit of a drag up to the finish. Can she find that last drop of energy to pull 
her through at the top?

Hayley Simmonds making slow inroads

Britain’s Hayley Simmonds was seen as an outside contender for a medal before 
the race, but has struggled so far. She was 18th quickest at the first check 
and 13th at the second, but surely is too far off the pace to have a say in 
this. The current standings are:

1) Neben: 36:37.04


2) Van Vleuten +25sec

3) Worrack +1.11sec

Van Dijk on the charge

Van Dijk’s attempt to better Neben’s time is turing into an epic battle. The 
American went off very quickly and seemed to pay a little in the closing 
stages, and the latest unofficial split suggests the Dutch rider is 4sec inside 
the leader’s time. Van Dijk ended up in the gutter at the Rio 2016 time trial 
after the wind took her front wheel when she was going well. But she redeemed 
herself at the European road championships, where she won the individual time 
trial ahead of Van der Breggen and Rio bronze medallist Olga Zabelinskaya.

Mid-race recap

A few moments to take stock after three of the heavweights made their mark on 
the race. There are some suggestions that the wind was favourable for the trio 
and if that was the case then maybe those times will take some beating. That 
said there are some serious medal contenders and one of those, Ellen van Dijk, 
sped off from the start and looked to be threatening the lead. By the first 
official split she was six seconds off the pace though. Neben’s mark is getting 
better by the second.

Neben takes the lead from Van Vleuten

Worrack posts the fastest time but that is surpassed moments later by Van 
Vleuten, and then almost immediately surpassed again by Neben. Van Vleuten 
fiinshed strongly to lie second as things stand and can be pleased with her 
efforsts after Rio. but the story of the day so far is Amber Neben. The 
41-year-old American’s time is 25 sec better than her Dutch rival, and 1min 
11sec quicker than Worrack. Hannah Barnes is out of the medals now, another 
minute further back.

Could Neben be on course for gold?

Trixi Worrack is another whose form is difficult to measure because of a 
serious injury earlier this year. The German underwent emergency kidney surgery 
on her left kidney in Varese, Italy, after crashing during a Women’s WorldTour 
event in March but she is a fantastic time triallist. Unfortunately she is 
being blown away by the relentless Neben at the time check six kilometres from 
home: Neben leads by 30 sec from Van Vleuten and 53 from Worrack.

Amber Neben goes off like a train

The race is beginning to hot up now, metaphorically as well as literally, with 
some of the real medal contenders on the course. Trixi Worrack, the veteran 
German, posts a time five seconds quicker than Van Vleuten at the the first 
time check, but both are currently being put in the shade by Amber Neben, who 
is going even quicker and is leading at the first and second splits. Could the 
Neben at 41 do a Kristin Armstrong, who claimed the time trial gold in Rio at 
the age of 43? These Americans seem to be getting better with age.

Annemiek van Vleuten sets off

The rider who was so unlucky in the Rio Olympic road race has made the world 
championships and has set off like a house on fire. Immediately her average 
speed is above 50kph, almost five seconds faster than the current leader 
Barnes. Van Vleuten is an unknown quantity after the horror injuries she 
suffered only two months ago, but she has talent. If she can get on the podium 
this would be nothing short of miraculous, considering what happened to her on 
7 August ...

Where are all the fans?

The lack of support for the riders here in Doha is depressing really. As their 
bodies get hotter and hotter and the fatigue sets in the support of the fans 
can provide a vital adrenaline boost. But not today? Has there ever been a 
worse-attended world championships in a major sport?

Hannah Barnes takes the lead

The British rider looked to be struggling in the closing stages but found 
something in the last couple of kilometres to post the quickest time so far. 
Barnes’s mark of 39min 00.37sec is eight seconds better than that of the Dane 
Julie Leth, who didn’t look to be going particularly quickly but held her form 
well. Obviously the race is seeded so the big guns will all go later, but 
that’s an impressive run and a decent early barometer.

Yorkshire to host 2019 Road World Championships?

Somewhere they don’t often need to worry about the heat is Yorkshire, where it 
seems the 2019 road world championships might be heading. The good folk of 
Yorkshire, or those responsible for the bid at least, are confident they will 
be named hosts after the success of the 2014 Tour de France Grand Départ and 
two three-day stage races in the region. Read the full story here…

Britain's Hannah Barnes sets pace

The early riders are out on the course and Britain’s national road race 
champion Hannah Barnes is the most impressive of them. She led by eight seconds 
at the first split and has extended it to 15 by the second, without looking 
like she’s broken sweat. Could the 23-year-old be a contender?

Temperature check

So the temperature in Doha currently stands at …. a balmy 39C. This is not 
going to be pretty, and one by product of the searing heat, apart from the 
physical toll on the riders, is the lack of fans around the course. Supporters 
were conspicuous by their absence at the team time trial on Sunday, and the 
Pear Qatar resembles a ghost town once again. It’s simply too hot to leave the 
confines of the air conditioned five star hotels. Even the wind could burn the 
riders today. This doesn’t bode well for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Preamble

Those fancy Russian bears and their leaky data have cast cycling into a rather 
murky light recently. Therevelations of Bradley Wiggins’s TUEs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/bradley-wiggins-world-anti-doping-agency-hackers-russian-leak>
 have quite rightly given rise to ethical discussions about theuse of legal 
substances to maximise performance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/bradley-wiggins-doping-rules-fancy-bears-tues>
, but once again the sport is under the spotlight for the wrong reasons. Step 
forward Annemiek van Vleuten, who could lift everyone’s spirits with a 
fairytale win in today’s women’s individual time trial.

The dutch rider was on course for Olympic gold in the road race in Rio eight 
weeks ago when ahorrific crash on the final descent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/annemiek-van-vleuten-intensive-care-olympic-road-race>
 shattered her hopes of victory and almost cost her her life. Van Vleuten was 
rushed to hospital and spent time in intensive care, having suffered severe 
concussion and three cracks in her spine. A long period of recovery may have 
been expected, but Van Vleuten won the Lotto Belgium Tour a month after Rio, 
and now has her sights firmly set on Doha. The flat course in the road race 
means her best shot of gold may come in today’s time trial, the event in which 
she reclaimed her national title this year, but the competition is fierce.

Kristin Armstrong, who claimed the time trial gold in Rio at the age of 43, 
and the reigning world champion Linda Villumsen are not here, but Anna van der 
Breggen of the Netherlands is in ominous form. Van der Bruggen profited from 
Van Vleuten’s fall to win road race gold in Rio, and was second behind 
Villumsen in this event last year in Virginia. A third dutchwoman, Ellen van 
Dijk, also has a point to prove. Katrin Garfoot, the current Australian and 
Oceania time trial champion, is dangerous, while the Germans, Lisa Brennauer 
and Trixi Worrack, and Russia’s Olga Zabelinskaya have some pedigree. Great 
Britain’s Hayley Simmonds has been breaking all manner of national records 
recently. This could be very close.


All the talk so far in Doha has been about the searing heat, with riders 
losing control or being violently sick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/10/doha-road-world-championships-heat-anouska-koster>
 as temperatures rose close to 40C in Sunday’s team time trial. Today’s 28.9km 
route is made up of two loops on the Pearl Qatar, the artificial island on the 
east coast of Qatar, with three time checks on the way.

Well, that was as unpredictable as ever. Amber Neben, who at the age of four 
survived a bout of spinal meningitis which left her in a coma for three days 
and doctors fearing brain damage if she survived, has become a double world 
champion. It was a stunning performance and completes an incredible year for US 
women’s time trialling, after Kristin Armstrong’s gold in Rio. Ellen van Dijk 
came up just short yet again, but her epic battle with Neben was the highlight 
of the race. Katrin Garfoot found something in the final couple of kilometres 
to win bronze, and deny Annemiek van Vleuten a fairytale medal. Thanks for your 
time.

Amber Neben wins gold for USA in Doha road world championships time trial
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/11/amber-neben-gold-usa-doha-road-world-championships-time-trial> 
A delighted but emotionally spent Amber Neben says: “It’s unbelievable. Was a 
long wait. I think I used more energy sitting there [waiting for the other 
riders to finish than i did on the bike. I was so nervous. It was so hard to 
watch. I feel for Ellen but am so excited for myself. The difference today was 
the mental perserverence. This one was more special because of everything that 
has happened between 2008 and now.”
 
That’s it. Van der Breggen finishes a catastrophic ride two min 11sec behind 
the new world champion. What a ride from the American, who won this title eight 
years ago and was not thought to be among the contenders at the age of 41.

Final standings: 

1) Neben (US) 


2) Van Dijk (Neth) 

3) Garfoot (Aus) 
 
Neben is almost there. She can afford to smile now. Another of her potential 
rivals cannot match her time, and does not even make the medals. Brennauer will 
be disappointed with that
 
Garfoot finishes strongly and takes third position, for now at least. She dug 
deep there in the late stages to go one better than her fourth in this race 
last year. Zabelinskaya fades into fourth, and Amialiusik has dropped out of 
the picture.
 
The four-rider threat to the gold medal seems to be down to two. Brennauer, 
like Van der Breggen, is struggling badly. Garfoot and Zabelinskaya are holding 
their form well, but nobody knows how much it is taking out of them to stay up 
with pace. Or how fast Neben went over the second half of the race.
 
Anna van der Breggen, supposedly the favourite for this race, is a huge 24 
seconds off the lead at the first time check. Is she suffering in the heat? We 
haven’t mentioned that for a while. It’s the action that’s reaching boiling 
point. Garfoot and Zabelinskaya are 10sec behind Neben, Brennauer a further 
3sec back. Neben looks comfortable at the finish right now, but further ahead 
the Belarusian Alena Amialiusik is on the move. Could she be a surprise medal 
threat?
 
There are probably only four women who can deny Neben now, and they are taking 
to the track. The German-born Australia’s Katrin Garfoot won the Chrono 
Champenois, the dress rehearsal for this event, last month. The Russian Olga 
Zabelinskaya won silver in the Rio Olympic time trial, after returning from a 
doping ban. Germany’s Lisa Brennauer won the world title in 2014. And Anna van 
der Breggen of the Netherlands has probably been the most impressive female 
time triallist this season. They are all on the track now, their task; to 
disrupt the current top three:

1) Neben: 36:37.04


2) Van Dijk +6sec

3) Van Vleuten +25sec
 
Van Dijk is hurting. She is rocking on the bike, shoulders weaving from side 
to side. She does not look comfortable and she nearly falls off. Has it cost 
her? Yes! She finishes 5.99sec off Neben. She’s in silver position, but that 
won’t please her. She wanted gold, and gave everything out there. But it wasn’t 
enough. Can Neben hold on for the title?
 
This really is a see-saw tussle, potentially for gold. At the 2km to go mark 
Van Dijk and Neben are dead level. This is a very flat course but there is a 
bit of a drag up to the finish. Can she find that last drop of energy to pull 
her through at the top?
 
Britain’s Hayley Simmonds was seen as an outside contender for a medal before 
the race, but has struggled so far. She was 18th quickest at the first check 
and 13th at the second, but surely is too far off the pace to have a say in 
this. The current standings are:

1) Neben: 36:37.04


2) Van Vleuten +25sec

3) Worrack +1.11sec

Van Dijk’s attempt to better Neben’s time is turing into an epic battle. The 
American went off very quickly and seemed to pay a little in the closing 
stages, and the latest unofficial split suggests the Dutch rider is 4sec inside 
the leader’s time. Van Dijk ended up in the gutter at the Rio 2016 time trial 
after the wind took her front wheel when she was going well. But she redeemed 
herself at the European road championships, where she won the individual time 
trial ahead of Van der Breggen and Rio bronze medallist Olga Zabelinskaya.
 
A few moments to take stock after three of the heavweights made their mark on 
the race. There are some suggestions that the wind was favourable for the trio 
and if that was the case then maybe those times will take some beating. That 
said there are some serious medal contenders and one of those, Ellen van Dijk, 
sped off from the start and looked to be threatening the lead. By the first 
official split she was six seconds off the pace though. Neben’s mark is getting 
better by the second.
 
Worrack posts the fastest time but that is surpassed moments later by Van 
Vleuten, and then almost immediately surpassed again by Neben. Van Vleuten 
fiinshed strongly to lie second as things stand and can be pleased with her 
efforsts after Rio. but the story of the day so far is Amber Neben. The 
41-year-old American’s time is 25 sec better than her Dutch rival, and 1min 
11sec quicker than Worrack. Hannah Barnes is out of the medals now, another 
minute further back.

Trixi Worrack is another whose form is difficult to measure because of a 
serious injury earlier this year. The German underwent emergency kidney surgery 
on her left kidney in Varese, Italy, after crashing during a Women’s WorldTour 
event in March but she is a fantastic time triallist. Unfortunately she is 
being blown away by the relentless Neben at the time check six kilometres from 
home: Neben leads by 30 sec from Van Vleuten and 53 from Worrack.
 
The race is beginning to hot up now, metaphorically as well as literally, with 
some of the real medal contenders on the course. Trixi Worrack, the veteran 
German, posts a time five seconds quicker than Van Vleuten at the the first 
time check, but both are currently being put in the shade by Amber Neben, who 
is going even quicker and is leading at the first and second splits. Could the 
Neben at 41 do a Kristin Armstrong, who claimed the time trial gold in Rio at 
the age of 43? These Americans seem to be getting better with age.
 
The rider who was so unlucky in the Rio Olympic road race has made the world 
championships and has set off like a house on fire. Immediately her average 
speed is above 50kph, almost five seconds faster than the current leader 
Barnes. Van Vleuten is an unknown quantity after the horror injuries she 
suffered only two months ago, but she has talent. If she can get on the podium 
this would be nothing short of miraculous, considering what happened to her on 
7 August ...
 
The lack of support for the riders here in Doha is depressing really. As their 
bodies get hotter and hotter and the fatigue sets in the support of the fans 
can provide a vital adrenaline boost. But not today? Has there ever been a 
worse-attended world championships in a major sport?
 
The British rider looked to be struggling in the closing stages but found 
something in the last couple of kilometres to post the quickest time so far. 
Barnes’s mark of 39min 00.37sec is eight seconds better than that of the Dane 
Julie Leth, who didn’t look to be going particularly quickly but held her form 
well. Obviously the race is seeded so the big guns will all go later, but 
that’s an impressive run and a decent early barometer.

Somewhere they don’t often need to worry about the heat is Yorkshire, where it 
seems the 2019 road world championships might be heading. The good folk of 
Yorkshire, or those responsible for the bid at least, are confident they will 
be named hosts after the success of the 2014 Tour de France Grand Départ and 
two three-day stage races in the region. Read the full story here…

The early riders are out on the course and Britain’s national road race 
champion Hannah Barnes is the most impressive of them. She led by eight seconds 
at the first split and has extended it to 15 by the second, without looking 
like she’s broken sweat. Could the 23-year-old be a contender?
 
So the temperature in Doha currently stands at …. a balmy 39C. This is not 
going to be pretty, and one by product of the searing heat, apart from the 
physical toll on the riders, is the lack of fans around the course. Supporters 
were conspicuous by their absence at the team time trial on Sunday, and the 
Pear Qatar resembles a ghost town once again. It’s simply too hot to leave the 
confines of the air conditioned five star hotels. Even the wind could burn the 
riders today. This doesn’t bode well for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

 
Those fancy Russian bears and their leaky data have cast cycling into a rather 
murky light recently. Therevelations of Bradley Wiggins’s TUEs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/bradley-wiggins-world-anti-doping-agency-hackers-russian-leak>
 have quite rightly given rise to ethical discussions about theuse of legal 
substances to maximise performance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/bradley-wiggins-doping-rules-fancy-bears-tues>
, but once again the sport is under the spotlight for the wrong reasons. Step 
forward Annemiek van Vleuten, who could lift everyone’s spirits with a 
fairytale win in today’s women’s individual time trial.

The dutch rider was on course for Olympic gold in the road race in Rio eight 
weeks ago when ahorrific crash on the final descent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/annemiek-van-vleuten-intensive-care-olympic-road-race>
 shattered her hopes of victory and almost cost her her life. Van Vleuten was 
rushed to hospital and spent time in intensive care, having suffered severe 
concussion and three cracks in her spine. A long period of recovery may have 
been expected, but Van Vleuten won the Lotto Belgium Tour a month after Rio, 
and now has her sights firmly set on Doha. The flat course in the road race 
means her best shot of gold may come in today’s time trial, the event in which 
she reclaimed her national title this year, but the competition is fierce.

Kristin Armstrong, who claimed the time trial gold in Rio at the age of 43, 
and the reigning world champion Linda Villumsen are not here, but Anna van der 
Breggen of the Netherlands is in ominous form. Van der Bruggen profited from 
Van Vleuten’s fall to win road race gold in Rio, and was second behind 
Villumsen in this event last year in Virginia. A third dutchwoman, Ellen van 
Dijk, also has a point to prove. Katrin Garfoot, the current Australian and 
Oceania time trial champion, is dangerous, while the Germans, Lisa Brennauer 
and Trixi Worrack, and Russia’s Olga Zabelinskaya have some pedigree. Great 
Britain’s Hayley Simmonds has been breaking all manner of national records 
recently. This could be very close.


All the talk so far in Doha has been about the searing heat, with riders 
losing control or being violently sick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/10/doha-road-world-championships-heat-anouska-koster>
 as temperatures rose close to 40C in Sunday’s team time trial. Today’s 28.9km 
route is made up of two loops on the Pearl Qatar, the artificial island on the 
east coast of Qatar, with three time checks on the way.
