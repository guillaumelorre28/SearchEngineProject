Visitors to Barcelona will all sooner or later find themselves in Antoni 
Gaudí’s fairytale Park Güell, admiring the view of the city from one of the 
sinuous benches made up of fragments of coloured tiles. For many, the benches 
of Park Güell are the essence of Gaudí, but they are in fact the work of 
another artist and architect, Josep Maria Jujol.

“When tourists go to Parc Güell, what do they look at? They look at Jujol’s 
work,” says the architect’s son, also Josep Maria. “I mean, what they most rave 
about in Gaudí’s work is Jujol’s contribution.”

In his lifetime and since, both Jujol’s contribution to Gaudí’s work and the 
buildings he created himself, have often been overlooked. Now a new 
documentary, Jujol-Gaudí: Two Geniuses of Architecture (see the trailer at 
jujol-gaudi.com <http://www.jujol-gaudi.com/>, UK release date tbc) by the 
writer and filmmaker Luis Campo Vidal seeks to get Jujol the recognition he 
deserves.

“Jujol designed and built some of the most admired elements of Gaudí’s work,” 
says Campo Vidal. “He lived in his shadow but he was an architectural genius 
whom we can now discover.”

Jujol was 27 years younger than Gaudí and they met when the former was working 
on the Ateneu cultural centre in Barcelona. Gaudí invited Jujol to work with 
him on an apartment building commissioned by one of his wealthy clients, 
explaining that he planned to create a fabulous facade the like of which had 
never been seen.

The result was the multicoloured, reptilian sheen of the facade of Casa Batlló 
in the Passeig de Gràcia, one of Gaudí’s most-loved and most-visited creations. 
But the facade is almost entirely the work of Jujol.

“Jujol brought colour and life to Gaudí’s work,” says the Japanese architect 
Yuji Morieda, author of a book on Catalan modernism. Aside from Park Güell and 
Casa Batlló, Jujol was also responsible for the wrought-iron balconies on 
Gaudí’s Casa Milà (La Pedrera), the altar at Colonia Güell and the emblem on 
the Torre Bellesguard in Barcelona.

However, Jujol also worked on his own behalf and some of his finest work is a 
15-minute train ride south of Barcelona in the small town of Sant Joan Despí 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jun/03/jujol-architecture-tour-barcelona-catalonia-gaudi>
 (trains leave Plaça de Catalunya every 10 minutes), where he designed the 
Torre de la Creu, Can Negre and Can Camprubí mansions. Guided visits to the 
Torre de la Creu and Can Negre are held on the last Sunday of the month (to 
arrange a visit call +34 933 737 363).

He also designed the marvellous Casa Bofarull 
<http://www.casabofarull.com/eng/> in Els Pallaresos in rural Tarragona (Jujol 
and Gaudí were both from Tarragona) and the Teatro Metropol, a modernist 
masterpiece in Tarragona city, the Roman capital of Spain. The theatre is open 
to the public but visitors should call first (+34 977 229 930).

Actor John Malkovich has been a fan of Jujol ever since he stumbled on his 
Casa Planells in Barcelona (Avinguda Diagonal, 332). “I was rooted to the spot 
in front of the house without knowing why. Passersby asked me if I was feeling 
all right. ‘I guess so,’ I said.”

Malkovich comments in the film that Jujol “always creates new things through 
the simplest materials. It’s not work for the rich, commissioned by and for the 
rich, and for that reason it is more intense.”
