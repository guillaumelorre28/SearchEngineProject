Winning Tip: Scopello and the Zingaro coastal reserve, Sicily

Perched above the sea in north-west Sicily is the village of Scopello, little 
more than a few pretty lanes with abundant charm and a sparkling cove below, 
complete with rock stacks and invitingly clear water. The atmospheric old 
Tonnara (tuna fishery) adds character, and Scopello is a perfect base for 
spirit-lifting hikes through the nearby Zingaro coastal reserve: paths rise 
through untouched hills with wildflowers before dipping to pristine beaches 
otherwise only reachable by boat.

 This is a stretch of soft, sandy coast between Naples and Rome, backed by 
hills and with amazing sunsets from the beaches. Take a train from Naples or 
Rome to Fondi, from where it is a 15-minute bus ride to Sperlonga. Explore the 
sleepy streets of the old town, stroll down to the Grotto of Tiberius (a 
haunting, watery cave), try an ice-cream from a local gelateria and admire the 
view of Monte Circeo from the promenade.

Sidestep the beachfront tourist traps and head uphill to Gastronomia San 
Martino. It’s worth turning up early and getting a bottle of local wine while 
you wait for your excellent food, with adventurous twists on pasta and seafood 
served on paper plates, as there are only a few seats. For a quieter beach 
follow the road round the coast (to the left as you exit the train station) and 
through the tunnel.

 Scerne beach, Pineto. Photograph: Alamy 
The 5km stretch of sand and shingle beach from Pineto in the Teramo province 
of Abruzzo to Torre del Cerrano is a welcome escape from the crowds to be found 
packing the resorts of the Adriatic coastline. The area around the tower is a 
protected marine reserve and the pine woods that run parallel to the beach 
provide wonderful shelter from the sun. For a few weeks in summer, classical 
concerts are held in the tower’s landscaped gardens at sunrise: an 
unforgettable experience.

 The beach at Ostia. Photograph: Alamy 
Not many tourists know Rome has beaches just half an hour from the city centre 
– a welcome relief from sightseeing. The soft sand and warm waters of Lido 
d’Ostia can be easily reached by taking Metro line B to Piramide, then a little 
local train to Lido Ostia or Ostia Antica (included in the daily travelcard for 
less than €10). Go in spring or autumn and you’ll almost have the place to 
yourself.

Over an hour’s drive south of Salerno, running from Agropoli to Scario, the 
Cilento is blissfully difficult to get to. On the “shin” of Italy, in the 
country’s second-largest Italian national park, the Cilento is a Unesco world 
heritage site thanks partly to the preservation of ancient Roman footpaths. The 
coast of the Cilento is largely undeveloped and sometimes extremely rugged. The 
sea wins prizes for cleanliness and the wildest stretches are only accessible 
by boat. It is along these most secluded cliffs I found my favourite olive 
groves, overlooking the Mediterranean far below.

 Quaint towns such as Numana and Sirolo cling to the hillside, and the 
expansive beach at Mezzavalle di Portonovo is well worth the 15-minute trek 
when visiting the beautiful Conero peninsula. Last year we discovered a path to 
the rocks where fishermen’s caves are hewn into the cliff – most are abandoned 
but some have been reclaimed by boating aficionados. Scramble along the shore, 
chat with the locals and watch them dive from the rocks into the crystal-clear 
pools.

On a calm day you can hire a boat with an outboard motor from outside Marina 
Piccola in Sorrento. I found it really simple to drive but if you’re nervous 
you can hire a skipper. Head south until you see Capri, where you can dock and 
go on land, but sailing around Capri and Anacapri is a joy in itself. From 
there, head east towards Positano. There’s no better way to arrive.

The best way to travel from the north to Puglia (at the “heel” of Italy) is 
down the east coast by train. The track runs parallel to the coast for a whole 
six hours of incredible scenery. Start at Rimini or Ancona, grab a seat facing 
forwards and take a picnic of prosecco, prosciutto and other snacks for the 
trip!

 View of Positano from the Path of the Gods. Photograph: Alamy 
The Rifugio degli Dei (Refuge of the Gods) apartments on cliffs above the 
Amalfi Coast offers exceptional views of Positano and its bay. Around 280 steps 
lead to the apartments, so it’s not for the faint-hearted, but the rewards at 
the top are worth it. The family who run the business are warm and welcoming 
and breakfast includes homemade cakes, fresh fruit from the garden and coffee. 
For the brave, a further 1,000 steps take you up to the Cammino degli Dei (Path 
of the Gods), a cliffside walk with views across the coast that should have a 
place on any walker’s list. There is a beach just over the road with an outdoor 
bar that serves some of the best fresh fish in town.

and reach for the camera constantly. Walk around the charming historic centre, 
enjoy the views of the harbour and the sandy beach from the walls and let the 
waters of the Adriatic hypnotise you. Go for fish of the day or pasta with 
shellfish or sea urchin, but try to avoid the slightly overpriced restaurants 
on the promenade.

The pretty, pastel-coloured, clifftop villages on the Cinque Terre are best 
viewed from the sea. Park at La Spezia, take the train to Riomaggiore and hop 
on the little coastal boat towards Monterosso. It stops at Manarola, Corniglia 
and Vernazza, where you can to enjoy fresh seafood and crisp white wine at the 
Trattoria da Sandro. Climb to the start of the Blue Path (sentiero azzurro) to 
savour the iconic panoramic view of the town and harbour before continuing the 
two-mile hike westward. Cool down with a gelato on Monterosso’s crescent-shaped 
sandy beach, before returning to La Spezia by train.
