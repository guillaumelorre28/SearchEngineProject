Final score: MLS All-Stars 1-2 Arsenal

Arsenal win it at the death then, with a few tantalising glimpses of future 
attractions in the build up to that goal. They were given a good workout by the 
All-Stars and a couple of scares in what turned out to be a competitive game. 
Xhaka looked classy — causing problems from open play and set pieces with that 
sweet left foot. He looks like a good addition forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, but surely there’ll be more 
reinforcements to come. But only Arsene knows...

Thanks for your tweets and emails. Sorry I couldn’t use all of them. Good 
night.

90 mins +1: Dempsey slides a ball behind the defense down the right hand side 
for Nagbe to make a low cross. But he can’t pick out a blue shirt and danger is 
averted.

Into the last scheduled minute. And Monreal almost gives up the ball while 
trying to hold possession, but the ball deflects to safety and that will be 
that.

90 mins: Arsenal’s young players have been scampering forward with purpose 
since Wenger’s late substitutions, and that’s a nice reward for them. Time for 
the All-Stars to make one last attack?

There is, you know. Larin finds a postage stamp of space on a through ball 
into the box, but he’s just denied by Bellerin I think. We’ll have two minutes 
of time added on.

GOAL! MLS All-Stars 1-2 Arsenal (AKPOM!)

For the love of the game! it’s a simple tap-in for Akpom as their forwards 
flood the box and a low ball across goal created by a combination of Monreal 
and Willock gets him what should be the winning goal!

84 mins: The game will go to penalties if we don’t get a goal in the next 7 
minutes. I get paid the same either way if anyone’s wondering, though that has 
nothing to do with my desire to see another goal. I just love the game.

Corner to Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> which Xhaka 
will take. It’s a decent one too, to the edge of the 6 yard box, and Holding 
heads juuuust over. Great corner from Xhaka who’s shown some sweet touches.

82 mins: Zelalem involved in the build up around the All-Star box, as Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> push up to probe for an opening. 
Nothing yet, but they retain possession for a while.

But suddenly the All-Stars break as Larin runs off Chambers’ shoulder to power 
into the right side of the box. He runs out of angle but holds up the ball for 
the arriving Wondolowski, only for the San Jose striker to fire over with his 
first time shot. Good work from Larin — doing what he does best.

80 mins: Iwobi sends a dangerous cross across the six yard box, but great 
anticipation from D.C. United’s Steve Birnbaum to get his foot to it first.

78 mins: Bingham almost gets the ball stuck under his feet from a back pass, 
but hacks the ball clear. Will someone find a winner in the remaining moments?

74 mins: Lovely little improvized flick cross from Giovinco, but there’s no 
finish on the end of it. And then Trapp skies his follow up shot and grins 
sheepishly. As he should. He really skied it. Like, 
California-sky-speckled-with-firework-smoke skied it.

72 mins: Now Akpom earns a free kick, central some 25 yards out, as he too 
runs directly at the opposition defense. Xhaka over it, but the expensive 
signing can only drive it straight at Bingham. Suppose he at least made him 
make a save, sniffed the rather less expensive Guardian writer.

Chris Wondolowski comes on to a big cheer from his local crowd. And Clint 
Dempsey’s on too, for Kljestan.

70 mins: Arsenal subs were Martinez for Cech, Reine-Adelaid for 
Oxlaide-Chamberlain, Zelalem for Elneny and Akpom for Walcott.

Bingham just had to make a quick reaction save at a snapshot from distance, 
and now he’s diving again in pursuit of a shot by Reine-Adelaide, who’s looking 
lively already.

66 mins: Arsenal trying to move the ball around again and Oxlade-Chamberlain 
again gets down the right to send a dangerous looking cross to the back post, 
but it’s just about headed clear. They’re just beginning to up the tempo again 
as they figure out all those All-Star adjustments.

64 mins: Another lovely ball forward by Kljestan almost gets Giovinco in 
through the middle, but Chambers steps across to block his route to goal before 
the little Italian can fashion a clear chance. Kljestan’s having a great season 
with assist numbers for the New York Red Bulls.

62 mins: Both teams a little ragged at the moment, with some sloppy touches 
from attacking players when it matters. Dangerous approach play by the 
All-Stars around theArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> box 
let down by an uncharacteristically poor touch from Mauro Diaz.

60 mins: An hour gone, and Kieran Baker’s been in touch again to let us know 
he’s reached D.C. and is off to watch the second half with some “proper 
American commentators”. With a statement like that, truly, football, or soccer 
as you call it, is growing etc etc. Still 1-1.

58 mins: Acosta hits a wild shot that sat up nicely for him on left edge of 
box, and Brandon Vincent immediately replaces him. Vincent is a first year 
professional who’s been making quite a name for himself in Chicago and already 
on the fringes of the USA national team.

52 mins: Arsenal make their first foray forward, and Walcott wants a penalty 
as he’s bundled over, but he’s already been called offside.

They’re beginning to settle again — given all the subs everyone could be 
forgiven for thinking they’d wondered out into the wrong game.

50 mins: Andrew Farrell and Steve Birnbaum on in defense for the All-Stars, 
who’ve looked the sharper at the start of the second half, with Giovinco 
instantly causing problems forArsenal

48 mins: Arsenal subs: Bellerin for Debuchy. Chambers for Bielik, Monreal for 
Gibbs, Xhaka for Coquelin, Iwobi for Wilshire.

All-Stars when I figure it out, but Giovinco just had a shot, and I think he’s 
on for Drogba, and I just saw Darlingto Nagbe have a touch, so clearly he’s 
replaced someone too. And David Bingham is on for Blake in goal.

Obligatory Graham Parker and the Rumour reference:

“Not THE Graham Parker,” chortles Patrick O’ Brien. “Or is that just a rumour. 
Ho, ho.

 Anyway, is there something in the fact that Drogba can still score and 
Walcott still can’t?

 Probs not. Arsene knows, after all.”

Yes, Drogba can still squeeze out sparks.

I’m off to change my name by deed poll. Back for the second half in a few.

More email:

Kieran Baker (42 mins) seems to realize we may have got off on the wrong foot 
and has another go:

“Thanks for the shout out, I’m reading the game on the train from New York to 
Washington. It’s the best thing on the internet right now. Did you do Eng Lit 
at Uni and then realize there aren’t any jobs and stumbled into journalism? 
Great use of the word eddying by the way. Train just stopped at Baltimore and 
an eddy of chill air swirled into the carriage.”

I didn’t stumble. I eddied.

Half-time: MLS All-Stars 1-1 Arsenal

Anyone trying to get an early jump on the Longest bar line in North America 
(LOBLINA) missed that...the All-stars didn’t have many chances andArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> would have been decent value for 
a 1-0 lead, but they were punished for switching off, and Drogba gets to leave 
the field cheerfully teasing his former team mate Cech, after scoring past him.

OK time to rest and prepare for a raft of substitutions.

GOAL! MLS All-Stars 1-1 Arsenal (DROGBA!)

Out of nothing, Kljestan slides a beautiful pass to dos Santos on the edge of 
the box, who in turn slips the ball to Drogba. He needs a couple of hacks at 
it, but eventually toe pokes the ball past Cech from close range for an 
equalizer. Great vision by Kljestan.

45 mins+1: Arsenal try to work one last attack, but it rather fizzles out, 
like a small faulty firework, arcing off course in the Northern California sky.

Where are you going? There are two minutes of stoppage time.

42 mins: Slight delay for some treatment to Bielik and time for Kieran Baker 
to endear himself with this email:

“Without much to look at I’ve been studying the pre game ‘long’ picture 
-didn’t realize Cech was that HUGE. Dn’t recognize the little guy looking in 
the wrong direction either? The guy with the ‘tash looks like something out of 
Starsky and Hutch too. Are you freelance because no one else will stay up late 
at the Grauniad?”

I am freelance as a lifestyle option, Kieran (he said with as much dignity as 
he could muster). And ‘tash man is Kljestan.

Drogba’s free kick is deflected over off the wall, then Van Damme heads 
powerfully over from the resulting corner.

40 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain makes a little burst down the left but runs into 
traffic in the corner. Now Aresnal go down the right with no more joy, and the 
All-Stars can break. Piatti drifts into a dangerous spot but his touch to 
Kljestan is poor. But now Drogba wins a dangerous free kick on the edge of the 
box after he’s dragged down by Bielik.

38 mins: The All-Stars making the odd chance without getting many clear shots 
on goal other than dos Santos’s early chance on Pirlo’s ball over the top. A 
little spell of possession for them in the Arsenal half at the moment. The 
intelligent movement of Kljestan and Piatti will give theArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> midfield a couple of adjustments 
to make.

36 mins: Arsenal building up again in the All-Star half, with neat 
one-twos/give-and-go’s (delete where culturally appropriate). They slowly up 
the tempo in search of a shooting angle, but eventually Campbell fouls Piatti 
as he tries to retrieve a loose ball.

Pirlo and Villa are already shaking hands and leaving for the airport by the 
way., so they just missed Kljestan almost getting on the end of a fiercely 
driven ball across the box.

32 mins: Villa greets a long ball out wide with a first time low ball across 
the six yard box. It evades Cech, but there’s nobody there to turn it in. And 
that will be the last contribution of Villa and Pirlo as the two NYCFC players 
are withdrawn. Their Eastern Conference leading team is facing the Western 
leaders Colorado Rapids on Saturday afternoon in New York.

Sacha Kljestan and Ignacio Piatti on for them by the way.

30 mins: Coquelin makes another hard tackle that looked a little naughty, but 
no card.

Meanwhile the All-Stars are scrambling a little in defense until Van Damme 
boots it inelegantly clear.

Kaka and Drogba again try to combine but Kaka’s deft flick behind the defense 
wasn’t read by the Montreal striker and the ball drifts out for a goal kick. 
Still 1-0 toArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>.

28 mins: Acosta has to get across sharply to deflect Campbell’s shot, after the
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> player had made a 
support run to meet Walcott’s cutback. Acosta’s done well so far.

All-Stars come forward and both Kaka and Drogba look to be trying to tee 
themselves up for something spectacular in the Arsenal box but Bielik does well 
to crowd Drogba out. No nerves from the young man.

Arsenal win it at the death then, with a few tantalising glimpses of future 
attractions in the build up to that goal. They were given a good workout by the 
All-Stars and a couple of scares in what turned out to be a competitive game. 
Xhaka looked classy — causing problems from open play and set pieces with that 
sweet left foot. He looks like a good addition forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, but surely there’ll be more 
reinforcements to come. But only Arsene knows...

Thanks for your tweets and emails. Sorry I couldn’t use all of them. Good 
night.
 
90 mins +1: Dempsey slides a ball behind the defense down the right hand side 
for Nagbe to make a low cross. But he can’t pick out a blue shirt and danger is 
averted.

Into the last scheduled minute. And Monreal almost gives up the ball while 
trying to hold possession, but the ball deflects to safety and that will be 
that.
 
90 mins: Arsenal’s young players have been scampering forward with purpose 
since Wenger’s late substitutions, and that’s a nice reward for them. Time for 
the All-Stars to make one last attack?

There is, you know. Larin finds a postage stamp of space on a through ball 
into the box, but he’s just denied by Bellerin I think. We’ll have two minutes 
of time added on.
 
For the love of the game! it’s a simple tap-in for Akpom as their forwards 
flood the box and a low ball across goal created by a combination of Monreal 
and Willock gets him what should be the winning goal!
 
86 mins: Farrell tries to find Wondolowski from the right and earns a corner 
off Chambers. Diaz with the corner, which is half cleared, then the ball pings 
around a little awkwardly beforeArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> pick it up and head forward...
 
84 mins: The game will go to penalties if we don’t get a goal in the next 7 
minutes. I get paid the same either way if anyone’s wondering, though that has 
nothing to do with my desire to see another goal. I just love the game.

Corner to Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> which Xhaka 
will take. It’s a decent one too, to the edge of the 6 yard box, and Holding 
heads juuuust over. Great corner from Xhaka who’s shown some sweet touches.

 
82 mins: Zelalem involved in the build up around the All-Star box, as Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> push up to probe for an opening. 
Nothing yet, but they retain possession for a while.

But suddenly the All-Stars break as Larin runs off Chambers’ shoulder to power 
into the right side of the box. He runs out of angle but holds up the ball for 
the arriving Wondolowski, only for the San Jose striker to fire over with his 
first time shot. Good work from Larin — doing what he does best.
 
80 mins: Iwobi sends a dangerous cross across the six yard box, but great 
anticipation from D.C. United’s Steve Birnbaum to get his foot to it first.
 
78 mins: Bingham almost gets the ball stuck under his feet from a back pass, 
but hacks the ball clear. Will someone find a winner in the remaining moments?
 
76 mins: Cyle Larin of Orlando is in the game now. He’s scored 20 goals in his 
one and a half seasons inMLS <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mls>. All 
the subs on now for the All-Stars.
 
74 mins: Lovely little improvized flick cross from Giovinco, but there’s no 
finish on the end of it. And then Trapp skies his follow up shot and grins 
sheepishly. As he should. He really skied it. Like, 
California-sky-speckled-with-firework-smoke skied it.
 
72 mins: Now Akpom earns a free kick, central some 25 yards out, as he too 
runs directly at the opposition defense. Xhaka over it, but the expensive 
signing can only drive it straight at Bingham. Suppose he at least made him 
make a save, sniffed the rather less expensive Guardian writer.

Chris Wondolowski comes on to a big cheer from his local crowd. And Clint 
Dempsey’s on too, for Kljestan.
 
70 mins: Arsenal subs were Martinez for Cech, Reine-Adelaid for 
Oxlaide-Chamberlain, Zelalem for Elneny and Akpom for Walcott.

Bingham just had to make a quick reaction save at a snapshot from distance, 
and now he’s diving again in pursuit of a shot by Reine-Adelaide, who’s looking 
lively already.
 
68 mins: Big swathe of Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
substitutions as the tv cameras show Jones, Pirlo and Villa heading to the 
airport to play in that NYCFC vs Colorado game in New York at 3pm on Saturday. 
MLS, folks.

American Gedion Zelalem coming in as one of the subs. More in the exact 
changes in a second. Quick water break going on now.
 
66 mins: Arsenal trying to move the ball around again and Oxlade-Chamberlain 
again gets down the right to send a dangerous looking cross to the back post, 
but it’s just about headed clear. They’re just beginning to up the tempo again 
as they figure out all those All-Star adjustments.
 
64 mins: Another lovely ball forward by Kljestan almost gets Giovinco in 
through the middle, but Chambers steps across to block his route to goal before 
the little Italian can fashion a clear chance. Kljestan’s having a great season 
with assist numbers for the New York Red Bulls.
 
62 mins: Both teams a little ragged at the moment, with some sloppy touches 
from attacking players when it matters. Dangerous approach play by the 
All-Stars around theArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> box 
let down by an uncharacteristically poor touch from Mauro Diaz.
 
60 mins: An hour gone, and Kieran Baker’s been in touch again to let us know 
he’s reached D.C. and is off to watch the second half with some “proper 
American commentators”. With a statement like that, truly, football, or soccer 
as you call it, is growing etc etc. Still 1-1.
 
58 mins: Acosta hits a wild shot that sat up nicely for him on left edge of 
box, and Brandon Vincent immediately replaces him. Vincent is a first year 
professional who’s been making quite a name for himself in Chicago and already 
on the fringes of the USA national team.
 
56 mins: Giovonco has been a catalyst in the opening moments of the half, with 
the All-Stars taking the game toArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> much more.

Oxlade-Chamberlain gets down the right but his low cytback is well rea dby 
Birnbaum stepping in to intercept any danger.
 
54 mins: Farrell makes a big tackle and can’t help but grinning as he realizes 
he’s in against the team he supported as a kid,Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>.

Collective gasp of appreciation from the crowd, as Giovinco makes an 
outrageous little flick, as is his wont.
 
52 mins: Arsenal make their first foray forward, and Walcott wants a penalty 
as he’s bundled over, but he’s already been called offside.

They’re beginning to settle again — given all the subs everyone could be 
forgiven for thinking they’d wondered out into the wrong game.
 
50 mins: Andrew Farrell and Steve Birnbaum on in defense for the All-Stars, 
who’ve looked the sharper at the start of the second half, with Giovinco 
instantly causing problems forArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. Sorry, still trying to track 
these changes on the run here.
 
48 mins: Arsenal subs: Bellerin for Debuchy. Chambers for Bielik, Monreal for 
Gibbs, Xhaka for Coquelin, Iwobi for Wilshire.

All-Stars when I figure it out, but Giovinco just had a shot, and I think he’s 
on for Drogba, and I just saw Darlingto Nagbe have a touch, so clearly he’s 
replaced someone too. And David Bingham is on for Blake in goal.
 
Five changes for Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>. Eight 
for the MLS All-Stars. Great.
 
Obligatory Graham Parker and the Rumour reference:

“Not THE Graham Parker,” chortles Patrick O’ Brien. “Or is that just a rumour. 
Ho, ho.

 Anyway, is there something in the fact that Drogba can still score and 
Walcott still can’t?

 Probs not. Arsene knows, after all.”

Yes, Drogba can still squeeze out sparks.

I’m off to change my name by deed poll. Back for the second half in a few.
 
Twitter — last bastion of humanity in a cruel, cruel world:

Stephen Hamilton is back, and this time I’m less certain that he’s not being 
sarcastic:
 
More email:

Kieran Baker (42 mins) seems to realize we may have got off on the wrong foot 
and has another go:

“Thanks for the shout out, I’m reading the game on the train from New York to 
Washington. It’s the best thing on the internet right now. Did you do Eng Lit 
at Uni and then realize there aren’t any jobs and stumbled into journalism? 
Great use of the word eddying by the way. Train just stopped at Baltimore and 
an eddy of chill air swirled into the carriage.”

I didn’t stumble. I eddied.

Anyone trying to get an early jump on the Longest bar line in North America 
(LOBLINA) missed that...the All-stars didn’t have many chances andArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> would have been decent value for 
a 1-0 lead, but they were punished for switching off, and Drogba gets to leave 
the field cheerfully teasing his former team mate Cech, after scoring past him.

OK time to rest and prepare for a raft of substitutions.
 
Out of nothing, Kljestan slides a beautiful pass to dos Santos on the edge of 
the box, who in turn slips the ball to Drogba. He needs a couple of hacks at 
it, but eventually toe pokes the ball past Cech from close range for an 
equalizer. Great vision by Kljestan.
 
45 mins+1: Arsenal try to work one last attack, but it rather fizzles out, 
like a small faulty firework, arcing off course in the Northern California sky.

Where are you going? There are two minutes of stoppage time.
 
44 mins: Drifting towards half-time now, like a small plume of firework smoke 
eddying across the Northern California sky.
 
42 mins: Slight delay for some treatment to Bielik and time for Kieran Baker 
to endear himself with this email:

“Without much to look at I’ve been studying the pre game ‘long’ picture 
-didn’t realize Cech was that HUGE. Dn’t recognize the little guy looking in 
the wrong direction either? The guy with the ‘tash looks like something out of 
Starsky and Hutch too. Are you freelance because no one else will stay up late 
at the Grauniad?”

I am freelance as a lifestyle option, Kieran (he said with as much dignity as 
he could muster). And ‘tash man is Kljestan.

Drogba’s free kick is deflected over off the wall, then Van Damme heads 
powerfully over from the resulting corner.
 
40 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain makes a little burst down the left but runs into 
traffic in the corner. Now Aresnal go down the right with no more joy, and the 
All-Stars can break. Piatti drifts into a dangerous spot but his touch to 
Kljestan is poor. But now Drogba wins a dangerous free kick on the edge of the 
box after he’s dragged down by Bielik.
 
38 mins: The All-Stars making the odd chance without getting many clear shots 
on goal other than dos Santos’s early chance on Pirlo’s ball over the top. A 
little spell of possession for them in the Arsenal half at the moment. The 
intelligent movement of Kljestan and Piatti will give theArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> midfield a couple of adjustments 
to make.
 
36 mins: Arsenal building up again in the All-Star half, with neat 
one-twos/give-and-go’s (delete where culturally appropriate). They slowly up 
the tempo in search of a shooting angle, but eventually Campbell fouls Piatti 
as he tries to retrieve a loose ball.

Pirlo and Villa are already shaking hands and leaving for the airport by the 
way., so they just missed Kljestan almost getting on the end of a fiercely 
driven ball across the box.
 
34 mins: Piatti immediately tries to find Drgoba, but doesn’t. Such is life.
 
32 mins: Villa greets a long ball out wide with a first time low ball across 
the six yard box. It evades Cech, but there’s nobody there to turn it in. And 
that will be the last contribution of Villa and Pirlo as the two NYCFC players 
are withdrawn. Their Eastern Conference leading team is facing the Western 
leaders Colorado Rapids on Saturday afternoon in New York.

Sacha Kljestan and Ignacio Piatti on for them by the way.
 
30 mins: Coquelin makes another hard tackle that looked a little naughty, but 
no card.

Meanwhile the All-Stars are scrambling a little in defense until Van Damme 
boots it inelegantly clear.

Kaka and Drogba again try to combine but Kaka’s deft flick behind the defense 
wasn’t read by the Montreal striker and the ball drifts out for a goal kick. 
Still 1-0 toArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>.
 
28 mins: Acosta has to get across sharply to deflect Campbell’s shot, after the
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> player had made a 
support run to meet Walcott’s cutback. Acosta’s done well so far.

All-Stars come forward and both Kaka and Drogba look to be trying to tee 
themselves up for something spectacular in the Arsenal box but Bielik does well 
to crowd Drogba out. No nerves from the young man.
