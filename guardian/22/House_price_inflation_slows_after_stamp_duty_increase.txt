House price inflation slowed in May to a rate of 4.7% a year as second home 
buyers and landlords fell out of the market, according toNationwide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nationwide> Building Society, but it 
added that a more prolonged slowdown is unlikely.

The monthly increase in May was 0.2% 
<http://www.nationwide.co.uk/about/house-price-index/headlines>, the same as 
April, helping to cut the annual rate from 4.9%. The average price for a home 
in the UK is now £204,368.

 drove up demand in March, which has since dropped substantially.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: “In the near term, it’s 
going to be difficult to gauge the underlying strength of activity in the 
housing market due to the volatility generated by the stamp duty changes that 
took effect from 1 April.”

The number of residential property transactions surged to an all-time high in 
March, about 11% higher than the pre-crisis peak, said Gardner.

“House purchase activity is likely to fall in the months ahead given the 
number of purchasers that brought forward transactions. However, it is possible 
that the recent pattern of strong employment growth, rising real earnings, low 
borrowing costs and constrained supply will tilt the demand/supply balance in 
favour of sellers and exert upward pressure on price growth once again in the 
quarters ahead.”

Estate agents were cheered that the post-stamp duty slowdown was less than 
they feared.

Jeremy Leaf, a former chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
(RICS) and a north London estate agent, said: ‘The slowdown in price growth is 
not as bad a comedown as one might expect following the rush from landlords and 
second homebuyers . The figures are also indicative of a relatively strong 
underlying market.”

Separate data from the Bank of England 
<http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/Pages/bankstats/2016/apr.aspx> 
showed that mortgage lending slowed dramatically in April after booming in 
February and March.

Total mortgage lending grew by just £281m in April, compared to the £7.4bn 
rise in March, the lowest increase since August 2012. New mortgage approvals 
dropped to 66,250 in April, down from 70,305 the month before.

Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: “The strong suspicion is that 
housing market activity will be pressurised in the immediate term by a 
combination of weakened interest from the buy-to-let and second home sectors as 
well as heightened concerns and uncertainties over the UK economic outlook, 
particularly in the run-up to June’s referendum on EU membership.

“Consistent with this, the RICS reported the first fall in buyer enquiries in 
April since March 2015. Furthermore, buyer enquiries fell at the fastest rate 
since August 2008. Consequently, house prices are likely to be soft for the 
next few months.”
