The stats look worrying. One in seven 15-year-olds in Australia can’t perform 
basic reading tasks: in the OECD’sProgram for International Student Assessment 
<http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results.htm> (PISA) 2012, 14 
per cent were classified at the lowest level in reading comprehension skills.

Meanwhile, Australian year 4 students ranked only 27th out of 45 countries 
tested for literacy in the 2011Progress in International Reading Literacy Study 
<https://www.acer.edu.au/files/TIMSS-PIRLS_Australian-Highlights.pdf> (PIRLS), 
sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland and well down the list from Canada, 
England and the US.

But things may not be as bad as they seem. “I would suggest that the teaching 
of strong critical reading and writing skills is perhaps the strongest it has 
been in some time,” says education consultant and Dymocks literacy expert, Ryan 
Spencer.

And with schools reporting on students in ever more comprehensive ways 
(through NAPLAN, for example), it’s becoming easier to identify students who 
need help.

“The challenge for parents, educators and the community is to use this 
information in a way that makes children feel valued for what they can do and 
what they are interested in…

“Being encouraged, supported and motivated to learn makes a big difference to 
the skills we can develop.”

How to create readers

Getting reluctant readers motivated is half the battle, Spencer says.

“Find their interests and engage them in books that they know something about, 
enjoy and can read before we move onto more complex reading skills.

“If boys in my classroom loved non-fiction books about dinosaurs, insects and 
dirt bikes rather than the class novel, then those are the books I’d fill my 
classroom library with. It’s about recognising kids’ interests and celebrating 
their choices.”

Being encouraged, supported and motivated to learn makes a big difference to 
the skills we can develop.”
Ryan Spencer, education consultant and Dymocks' literacy expert 
Allowing children to read what interests them certainly seems to encourage 
reading. The favourite books of an overwhelming majority of children aged six 
to 17 are ones they have chosen themselves, according to the 2015Australian 
Kids and Family Reading Report 
<http://www.scholastic.com.au/schools/ReadingLeaders/KFRR/data.asp>.

Nearly three-quarters of children in the study said they would read more if 
they could find books they liked (top of the wish list: books that make them 
laugh). We sometimes forget it, but reading should be fun.

Other factors that help turn kids into frequent readers include:


 * Knowing their reading level (nine out of 10 children who knew their reading 
level had used the information to choose books) 
 * Being raised in a home with lots of books 
 * Having parents who are frequent readers 
 * Being read to aloud 
Almost 90 per cent of children in the study said they loved being read books 
aloud at home – mainly because it’s a special time with parents.

“The best things that we can do to assist our kids to become literate is to be 
interested, motivated and excited members of their learning,” Spencer says.

“We need to fuel their interests in books, celebrate their reading 
achievements and assist them to challenge themselves when needed.”

Free books for schools

Of course, not all homes have shelves groaning with books and family members 
devouring novels day and night.

Stocking primary school libraries with new books that children actually want 
to read is the aim ofDymock’s Children’s Charities 
<https://dcc.gofundraise.com.au/cms/home> (DCC), a not-for-profit organisation 
that operates Australia wide.

“We understand that book ownership in many homes is low, which is why we have 
programs that provide books to schools and to students,” says DCC general 
manager, Paul Swain.

“There is disadvantage right across Australia, which includes remote and 
marginalised communities, but also many communities in cities and suburbs which 
can get overlooked.”

All the books that DCC supplies are chosen by the child or the school 
(depending on the program).

DCC is seeking expressions of interest from primary schools and other groups, 
such as pre-primary school service providers, that would like to be involved. 
It’s also seeking donations. For more information visit

Stop the summer slide

Whatever your child’s reading level, there’s a chance their aptitude could 
decline over the summer as beaches and backyard cricket become more appealing 
than books.

The phenomenon is known as the “summer slide”. 

Here are Ryan Spencer’s top six tips to keep kids reading over the summer 
holidays:

 * Make reading time fun (and quick!)
 “Aim for no more than 10 minutes reading together – just enough to encourage 
the kids to come back tomorrow.” 
 * Visit bookstores and the local library 
“Bookstores often sell brand new popular kids’ books for less than $10, much 
less than a movie ticket.” 
 * Allow children to choose what they want to read
“It is often hard to let go and let children choose their own books, however 
it is vital to developing strong, self-sufficient readers.” 
 * Have a screen-free night each week
“Make a screen-free night part of your family’s regular routine where everyone 
in the family picks up something to read.” 
 * Give books as gifts
“Christmas for kids means presents, and more books in the house can never go 
astray.” 
 * Read together using supportive strategies
“When you are reading together with your child, it’s a great idea to give them 
the option of how they would like to read. Provide the opportunity for children 
to choose whether they would like to read aloud or silently. Check if they 
would like to try paired reading – a child and parent reading together, the 
same book, same time – if they feel like they need extra support with the book.”
