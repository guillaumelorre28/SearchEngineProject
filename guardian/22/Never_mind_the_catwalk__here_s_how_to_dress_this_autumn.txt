A funny thing happens in fashion, which is that you are bombarded with 
information about new-season fashion trends without ever being told what it is 
you should actually wear. I can get to the end of a feature about “the new 
directions” and feel, if I am honest, none the wiser. OK, I should aim for 
Contemporary Polish or Fresh Sparkle but, um, what should I wear tomorrow?

This is not about fashion being deliberately obtuse. It is not even about 
fashion being accidentally obtuse by dint of Zoolanderish overuse of 
impressive-sounding words. (OK, OK, maybe a little bit of the latter.) It 
springs from good intentions: a well-intentioned recognition that fashion, 
these days, is as much about cult styling tricks and below-the-radar trends as 
it is about the new Prada catwalk. But the desire to appeal to the widest 
possible audience ends up miring fashion in bland, catch-all manifesto-speak 
that doesn’t mean anything. The phrase “modern tailoring” is to fashion’s 
September issues what “hard-working families” is to party conference season.

Fringe benefits: the haircut that become 2016's fashion power move

So I will do my best to get to the point. The look you are aiming for this 
autumn is a bit sporty, quite blunt, but a bit posh. Let’s break this down. 
Sportswear has dominated fashion for more than a year. But the sporty element 
of this season’s look is slightly different from six months ago. Theperky 
athleisure vibe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/06/athleisure-polo-shirt-skirt-jess-cartner-morley>
 has turned less wholesome. This is the kind of sportswear that gets a cheeky 
McDonald’s on the way home from the pub, not the green-juice kind. It is a 
shiny pair of three-stripe Adidas tracksuit bottoms, or a crop top to give that 
demure midi-skirt a new look, or a half-zip sweatshirt under a blazer.

Next. Blunt sounds like exactly the kind of obtuse fashion directive I was 
bemoaning, right? It’s not a colour, or a hemline, or a print. But it is the 
reason why fashion types who have sworn by navy coats for the last five years 
are buying padded jackets and anoraks in analogue primaries. It is why trainers 
and flat shoes work with everything. It is why twiddly details are over and why 
breezily oversized is more on point than fussily fitted and why stark outlines, 
such as a vest dress over a polo neck, work. It is why French Girl Chic – which 
has existed as a kind of independent city-state within fashion for years, white 
jeans aloft from the flagpole – has gone for motorcycle-leather toughness this 
season. For all Gigi Hadid’s caramel-toned girl-next-door appeal, it is her 
cooler, less approachable looking sister, Bella, who you should be channelling.

Lastly, posh. This is important, because the sporty and blunt elements need 
glamour and attitude. Buy one thing in jersey or acrylic, one in velvet or 
satin. Wear enormous earrings with your padded jacket and let your tracksuit 
bottoms pool on the floor, with a Delevingne-like insouciance, like silk 
pyjamas . Oh, and buy the padded jacket now, before they sell out. Does that 
sound blunt? Good. This season, that’s a compliment.

, the kind of jacket that your parents made you wear for a wet walk in the Lake 
District is now fashionable. Preferably make it an 80s school-jacket colour 
combination – blue and green, perhaps. However, to make sure it isn’t mistaken 
for Millets, wear it the fashion way – shrugged on to frame your shoulders 
rather than zipped up properly.

Velvet

If stars such as Taylor Swift and Alicia Vikander have been wearing velvet in 
the summer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/08/velvet-overground-how-to-wear-velvet-in-summer>
, it hasn’t jumped the shark yet. On the catwalk at Valentino and Haider 
Ackermann, the cool girls’ take is a velvet blazer. It’s smart, a bit retro in 
a Jimi Hendrix way and – bonus! – distinctly strokeable.

 Furry slippers … sort of retro. 
Furry slippers

Sure, there’s Miu Miu and Gucci <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> on 
the catwalk but the furry-shoes prize still goes toRihanna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2016/apr/14/buy-of-the-day-rihannas-alpha-slippers>
 and her Puma line, Fenty. Her furry sliders – complete with stamped Puma logo 
– are ridiculous enough to bring the lols that footwear requires this season, 
but also have that Rihanna-patented loungey feel. Accessorise with aglass of 
wine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/01/pour-it-up-rihannas-wine-chic> 
and satin robe for the full look.

Blouse

Anne-France Dautheville, Chloé’s muse this season 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/03/chloe-shows-us-a-post-girly-world>
, was a photographer who travelled around the Middle East on a motorbike in the 
70s. Being Parisian, however, she needed some glamour in her holdall, and that 
came in the blouse. Chloé’s collection, therefore, had lots of frilly blouses, 
and these are the kind you need this season. The only rule? The more OTT the 
better.

Big earrings

If Michelle Obama’s blue dress at the Democratic convention 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/26/stylewatch-michelle-obama-at-the-democratic-convention>
 kept things simple, her earrings – bold and graphic – were a fashion-friendly 
touch. It’s all about the statement earring right now, from the cluster of 
diamanté on ears atSaint Laurent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/saint-laurent> to the mismatched designs 
at Loewe. Think of your ears as tiny galleries for abstract art and you’re on 
the right track.

Hoodie

The hoodie is the signature item of Vetements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vetements> – the label that leads where 
fashion follows. As such, there is a surfeit of hoodies this season. Cropped 
ones, like this from Topshop, have a Kendall Jenner show-your-stomach look but 
oversized works too. Just be sure to keep the hood up for alpha in-the-know 
touch.

Celine,AW16’s trench

 is less the tired style cliche thrown over suits for the commute home, and 
more slacker. Wear open, with sandals, to really fashion things up. Turning 
practical things unpractical is a particular fashion talent.

OTK boots

Call it lampshading 
<http://www.whowhatwear.co.uk/lampshading-celebrity-style-trend> if you want, 
but wearing a short dress/T-shirt/jumper with over-the-knee boots is definitely 
a thing. The baggy top is crucial. As the likes of Gigi Hadid, the Kardashians 
and indeed North West have all proved in the past, the slouchy top is what 
updates this look from Shania Twain video to 2016. Take note,Fergie
