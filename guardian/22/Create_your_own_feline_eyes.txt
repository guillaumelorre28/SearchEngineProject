Think of white eyeshadow as a tiny spotlight. It illuminates everything it 
touches, meaning that if you wear eyeliner on top, the effect is heightened. 
Brightened. At the couture shows, the autumn/winter looks relied on a series of 
variations on the feline eye, with Armani Privé’s coiffed models making their 
smoky swooshes of liner even more dramatic with bold gradations of white and 
pale grey shadow, lighting it from beneath.
