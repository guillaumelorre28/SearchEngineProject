That's all for today

Don: This whole thing has not been about photography. It’s been about 
emotions. Thank you for the questions.

Thank you for the inspiration your pictures have given me. What became of the 
Guvnors of the Seven Sisters Road (below) and without photography would your 
life have followed a similar path?
 The Guvnors in their Sunday Suits, Finsbury Park, London, 1958. Photograph:

Well I had to choices when I grew up in Finsbury Park. Either I ran with the 
pack, which I've photographed in the Observer, or I tried to stay on the 
straight and narrow and eventually escape what was a really violent ghetto at 
the time. It was by the fortune of this one sunny day that I took my camera and 
photographed the boys in this derelict building at the end of my street. I took 
this photo to the Observer newspaper, the editor asked: Did you take this? I 
said: yes. And they published it. And gave me £50 and it was a king's ransom, 
the turning point of my whole life. It offered me a life away from the bigotry 
and ignorance and violence of Finsbury Park. And since then I've managed to 
publish 30 books, numerous exhibitions. But the final footnote is that I failed 
my photography test to becomes a RAF photographer. I taught myself everything 
about photography and darkroom work. It was all based on the foundations of a 
terrible beginning in my life. I've managed to turn it all around and be where 
I am.


Victoria Anderson  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16234277>asks:

Being a photographer who has experienced multiple scenarios out of your 
control and potentially fatal – how do you deal with what you have seen and the 
effects on your mental health? I’m just curious to know how you deal with the 
mental side of the photography you do?

What I do is I thin down the hard part by putting all my energy into the 
trying part of processing the film, making beautiful prints. I don't 
disassociate, I always retain the memory of what I've seen because the memory 
becomes my white stick, it guides me into the next stage, into the darkroom and 
releasing my emotions into the print. It might be darker, more sinister. A lot 
of fear went into my work, I saw dead children, men with their jaws blown away, 
holes in their throat. This had to be got rid of or I would have post-traumatic 
stress. Which I don't. But I do have bad dreams. I took my soul and my stress 
into the darkroom. I belong to this system I've developed. It has been a 
marriage for me, one of the longest lasting of my life.

100% really. Once I make up my mind, I think of little else. And once I make 
the statement that I commit myself to such a subject there is no turning back.

Regarding the Beatles’ 1968 photoshoot, how structured was the day, was it 
totally spontaneous in terms of location choice? Were any locations vetoed? Any 
chance of you retracing your steps for the 50th anniversary of the shoot with 
McCartney?

One day I received a phone call from the Apple company, who were tired of 
requests from endless photographers to do more shoots of the Beatles. They said 
to me if we offered you £200 would you consider spending a day with the Beatles 
. I would have given them £200. However, I agree to it. and we chose the 
location of the East End of London and I spent a very interesting day which 
ended up in Paul McCartney's house in St John's Wood having tea at the end of 
his garden in what looked like a golf ball but was his summerhouse. I loved 
being with them but photographically looking back I found this possibly the 
most unrewarding thing in my photo collection because other people did a much 
better job.

Yes don't do it. My concerns are that we are seeing less and less 
photojournalism and I would think twice before investing your life in thinking 
this would eventually find you some reward. My main comments relate to possibly 
the vanishing future of newspapers.

Yes I would actually. It would have be one of the most difficult situation of 
my life. There is an English captive there, John Cantlie, and we are in 
contact. But I don't think my wife would allow it. She was angry when I was in 
Damascus last week. I went to photograph Palmyra because I did a book called 
Southern Frontiers and Palmyra featured big in it in the book and particularly 
the temple which Isis blew up. I wanted to show the tragedy of the devastation. 
I found a hole in a wall and managed to shoot one frame before a Russian 
solider appear out of nowhere and told me to get going. So you could say my 
trip was a semi-failure...

 But I wound up in Aleppo and Homs.

Your new exhibition is at Photo London, probably the largest gathering of 
photography Britain has ever seen. Why do you think there has been this 
groundswell of interest in photography in Britain? Will London ever overtake 
Paris as the world capital of photography?

Well it's not you see. New York is the world capital, France next and England 
third. There's more visual, better designed magazines and media outlets. 
Unfortunately we have far too much emphasis on fashion, accessories, 
advertising, and now we have the iPhone. This is all part of it. The value of 
photography has gone up enormously too. Photographic prints have changed hands 
for hundreds and thousands of dollars in the market. Unfortunately, I fear the 
contamination of the art world and photography will steal integrity and 
commitment from some photographers.

'Photography is about the chemistry of your own emotion. You release the

Robert Capa, one of Magnum’s founders, said “if your pictures aren’t good 
enough, you’re not close enough.”Do you think you got too close?

It would be trite to say that during your lifetime the world has changed but

Did I get too close? The answer is yes, and I'm glad I did. I always use the 
wide angle lens so it was necessary for me to get even closer. My main purpose 
in saying this I wanted to bring you, the viewer, as close as I was standing so 
that you could almost smell the despair and the pain and the suffering I was 
witnessing.Photography <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography> 
isn't about cameras, film, chemistry. It's the chemistry of your own emotion. 
You release the button on this hopefully everlasting image of people who are in 
such unfortunate situations.

I have a moral feeling that however close I've been to my subject and however 
it's played out by the viewer in their minds, I sincerely believe that all 
their imagery we've seen in the last 30, 40 years, hasn't really brought about 
an understanding that we could see the end of further wars. The conflicts now 
have become far worse than they were when I first started out. Nothing could be 
more despicable than the imagery of ISIS beheading prisoners in the desert. 
Just when you think you've seen the worse, another load of worse comes along.

'When I came back from wars and revolution, I threw my cameras in a cupboard.

When it comes to home and family life, have you always adopted the 
photographer role and documented the lives of your loved ones? Or were you 
opposed to this approach, instead leaving the camera in the hands of others? Or 
a happy compromise?

My problem was that when I came back from these areas of conflict, when I came 
back to England, I would naturally find our own family in the security of our 
simple home with a caring and loving mother who would have assumed the role of 
father in my absence. It was very hard to pick up the thread of what my 
responsibility was. I though it was unnecessary to start persecuting my own 
family with the camera. And I have to say that when I came back from wars, and 
revolution, I put my cameras in a bag and threw them into the cupboard turned 
my back on them. There is very little documentation of the families I had in my 
life. Very little. Almost non existent. Some people's idea might be considered 
to be harmful. It was purely based on my exhaustion, my mental and physical 
exhaustion. Having seen terrible things. But I was a good father. I loved my 
children. And still do.

'Newspapers promote this narcissistic imagery of celebrities and the rich

Christopher Nunn  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12768809>asks:

The banality of life today is summed up for me by the navel-gazing “selfie” on

This is a very good question. Thank you. My concerns are that celebrities - 
the wealthy and the celebrities have taken over from the most important images 
we need to be aware of - the suffering, the side of humanity that isn't in the 
privileged position in the first place and it's normally these unfortunate 
people during wars, revolutions and famines that are the last to be told of the 
dangers that are coming toward them. I know that newspapers are under threat of 
survival and I can't help feeling in some quarters that they are encouraged to 
promote this narcissistic imagery of celebrities and rich footballers and rich 
financiers because it sells newspapers. And sadly I don't call this 
information, it call it a waste of great space. I also feel that we are denying 
ourselves the chance to be educated on the tragedies and the political horrors 
that are going on out there and that we should be contributing to try and stop.

Well I had to choices when I grew up in Finsbury Park. Either I ran with the 
pack, which I've photographed in the Observer, or I tried to stay on the 
straight and narrow and eventually escape what was a really violent ghetto at 
the time. It was by the fortune of this one sunny day that I took my camera and 
photographed the boys in this derelict building at the end of my street. I took 
this photo to the Observer newspaper, the editor asked: Did you take this? I 
said: yes. And they published it. And gave me £50 and it was a king's ransom, 
the turning point of my whole life. It offered me a life away from the bigotry 
and ignorance and violence of Finsbury Park. And since then I've managed to 
publish 30 books, numerous exhibitions. But the final footnote is that I failed 
my photography test to becomes a RAF photographer. I taught myself everything 
about photography and darkroom work. It was all based on the foundations of a 
terrible beginning in my life. I've managed to turn it all around and be where 
I am.

What I do is I thin down the hard part by putting all my energy into the 
trying part of processing the film, making beautiful prints. I don't 
disassociate, I always retain the memory of what I've seen because the memory 
becomes my white stick, it guides me into the next stage, into the darkroom and 
releasing my emotions into the print. It might be darker, more sinister. A lot 
of fear went into my work, I saw dead children, men with their jaws blown away, 
holes in their throat. This had to be got rid of or I would have post-traumatic 
stress. Which I don't. But I do have bad dreams. I took my soul and my stress 
into the darkroom. I belong to this system I've developed. It has been a 
marriage for me, one of the longest lasting of my life.

How much of yourself do you feel is ever appropriate or required to give away 
in order to get close enough to a subject? And thank you for your outstanding

100% really. Once I make up my mind, I think of little else. And once I make 
the statement that I commit myself to such a subject there is no turning back.

Regarding the Beatles’ 1968 photoshoot, how structured was the day, was it 
totally spontaneous in terms of location choice? Were any locations vetoed? Any 
chance of you retracing your steps for the 50th anniversary of the shoot with 
McCartney?

One day I received a phone call from the Apple company, who were tired of 
requests from endless photographers to do more shoots of the Beatles. They said 
to me if we offered you £200 would you consider spending a day with the Beatles 
. I would have given them £200. However, I agree to it. and we chose the 
location of the East End of London and I spent a very interesting day which 
ended up in Paul McCartney's house in St John's Wood having tea at the end of 
his garden in what looked like a golf ball but was his summerhouse. I loved 
being with them but photographically looking back I found this possibly the 
most unrewarding thing in my photo collection because other people did a much 
better job.

Yes don't do it. My concerns are that we are seeing less and less 
photojournalism and I would think twice before investing your life in thinking 
this would eventually find you some reward. My main comments relate to possibly 
the vanishing future of newspapers.

Yes I would actually. It would have be one of the most difficult situation of 
my life. There is an English captive there, John Cantlie, and we are in 
contact. But I don't think my wife would allow it. She was angry when I was in 
Damascus last week. I went to photograph Palmyra because I did a book called 
Southern Frontiers and Palmyra featured big in it in the book and particularly 
the temple which Isis blew up. I wanted to show the tragedy of the devastation. 
I found a hole in a wall and managed to shoot one frame before a Russian 
solider appear out of nowhere and told me to get going. So you could say my 
trip was a semi-failure...

 But I wound up in Aleppo and Homs.

Your new exhibition is at Photo London, probably the largest gathering of 
photography Britain has ever seen. Why do you think there has been this 
groundswell of interest in photography in Britain? Will London ever overtake 
Paris as the world capital of photography?

Well it's not you see. New York is the world capital, France next and England 
third. There's more visual, better designed magazines and media outlets. 
Unfortunately we have far too much emphasis on fashion, accessories, 
advertising, and now we have the iPhone. This is all part of it. The value of 
photography has gone up enormously too. Photographic prints have changed hands 
for hundreds and thousands of dollars in the market. Unfortunately, I fear the 
contamination of the art world and photography will steal integrity and 
commitment from some photographers.

It would be trite to say that during your lifetime the world has changed but

Did I get too close? The answer is yes, and I'm glad I did. I always use the 
wide angle lens so it was necessary for me to get even closer. My main purpose 
in saying this I wanted to bring you, the viewer, as close as I was standing so 
that you could almost smell the despair and the pain and the suffering I was 
witnessing.Photography <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography> 
isn't about cameras, film, chemistry. It's the chemistry of your own emotion. 
You release the button on this hopefully everlasting image of people who are in 
such unfortunate situations.

I have a moral feeling that however close I've been to my subject and however 
it's played out by the viewer in their minds, I sincerely believe that all 
their imagery we've seen in the last 30, 40 years, hasn't really brought about 
an understanding that we could see the end of further wars. The conflicts now 
have become far worse than they were when I first started out. Nothing could be 
more despicable than the imagery of ISIS beheading prisoners in the desert. 
Just when you think you've seen the worse, another load of worse comes along.

When it comes to home and family life, have you always adopted the 
photographer role and documented the lives of your loved ones? Or were you 
opposed to this approach, instead leaving the camera in the hands of others? Or 
a happy compromise?

My problem was that when I came back from these areas of conflict, when I came 
back to England, I would naturally find our own family in the security of our 
simple home with a caring and loving mother who would have assumed the role of 
father in my absence. It was very hard to pick up the thread of what my 
responsibility was. I though it was unnecessary to start persecuting my own 
family with the camera. And I have to say that when I came back from wars, and 
revolution, I put my cameras in a bag and threw them into the cupboard turned 
my back on them. There is very little documentation of the families I had in my 
life. Very little. Almost non existent. Some people's idea might be considered 
to be harmful. It was purely based on my exhaustion, my mental and physical 
exhaustion. Having seen terrible things. But I was a good father. I loved my 
children. And still do.

This is a very good question. Thank you. My concerns are that celebrities - 
the wealthy and the celebrities have taken over from the most important images 
we need to be aware of - the suffering, the side of humanity that isn't in the 
privileged position in the first place and it's normally these unfortunate 
people during wars, revolutions and famines that are the last to be told of the 
dangers that are coming toward them. I know that newspapers are under threat of 
survival and I can't help feeling in some quarters that they are encouraged to 
promote this narcissistic imagery of celebrities and rich footballers and rich 
financiers because it sells newspapers. And sadly I don't call this 
information, it call it a waste of great space. I also feel that we are denying 
ourselves the chance to be educated on the tragedies and the political horrors 
that are going on out there and that we should be contributing to try and stop.
