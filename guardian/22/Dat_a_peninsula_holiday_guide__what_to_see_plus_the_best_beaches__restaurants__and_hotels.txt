Istanbul city guide: essential sights, and where to eat, drink and stay

The spindly, 50-mile-long Datça peninsula in Turkey’s Muğla province is a 
dagger of pure green at the meeting point of the Aegean and the Mediterranean, 
and is as unsullied as south-west Turkey gets. The ancient Greeks believed 
Datça to have been created personally by Zeus, so gorgeous are its rocky 
outcrops and aquamarine waters. The geographer Strabo apparently said: “God 
sent his beloved creatures to Datça for them to live longer.”

So what’s all the fuss about? It’s about craggy, pine-crested hills, endless 
olive groves, empty ravines, cornflower-blue coves, vast sweeping bays and 
deserted beaches, air scented with thyme, rosemary and sage, and sleepy 
villages. It’s about goats on the road and old men tinkering with their worry 
beads in vine-covered cafes.

Although this backwater peninsula is wedged between moneyed Bodrum to the 
north, and overdeveloped Marmaris to the south, bad road access and its 
distance from airports have left it unspoilt. Tourists do come and stay in a 
new clutch of upmarket hotels, and city-dwelling Turks are buying second homes 
here, but most visitors still only make short stop-offs on gulet cruises.

Remnants of the Karians – who settled here in 5400BC – and the cultures of 
Lydia, Persia, and the Byzantine and Ottoman empires, stud the landscape: there 
are church ruins, ancient cisterns, tombstones and ruined olive oil facilities.

On the southern shore, workaday, harbour-front Datça is the main settlement. 
It’s not built for tourists but this is where you’ll find most of the 
restaurants. In the hills above town is Old Datça which, by the 1980s, was more 
or less abandoned, but is now having a mini renaissance. Then there is a 
235-mile coastline to take in, Datça’s sleepy villages and landscapes, and its 
most precious jewel: the ancient Greek ruins of Knidos, a city at the 
confluence of the Mediterranean and the Aegean.

 Ruins of the ancient ampitheatre of Knidos. Photograph: Alamy 
This ancient ruined harbour was a shipping stronghold from the 4th century BC. 
Astronomers (including Eudoxus the Mathematician), medics and architects 
(including the architect who designed the Beacon of Alexandria, one of the 
Seven Wonders of the World) congregated here. Its most famous poster girl, 
though, was its nude Aphrodite statue, which had a cult following – Pliny wrote 
that many came just to admire it. Knidos fell into ruins through earthquakes, 
conquests and looting – the last treasures were spirited away to the British 
Museum – and Aphrodite disappeared entirely more than 1,000 years ago. Notable 
remains are a few basilica arches, floor mosaics and the exceptional sea-facing 
theatre. The drive there is heavenly, following the backbone of the peninsula, 
passing forested hills and winding through gorges. Once there, the site has a 
spiritual quality; it is largely empty but for a handful who climb the silent 
steps of the antique theatre and pick the daisies on the hillside. In its 
heyday, it must have been a fantastic: a marble city with terraces descending 
to the sea, full of temples, and home to 70,000 people. At the site there is an 
old-fashioned restaurant serving meze, fish and koftas.

Hit the beach
The peninsula has coves, bays, and beaches in abundance. Sandy or shingly, 
they all share the same, alluring, crystalline turquoise waters. Often the 
water remains shallow for some distance offshore, making it safe for young 
children. In the quiet village of Orhaniye, there’s an elongated sandbank you 
can walk on, out into the bay. East of Knidos, the charming fishing village of 
Palamut Bükü is known for its fish restaurants and its 2km-long beach. Kargi is 
a simple rustic idyll with a few vine-shaded cafes and a clutch ofpensions on a 
shingle beach, and the tiny villages of Hayıtbük, Kızılbük and Ovabükü, triple 
bays in a row, are becoming places to spend a day on the beach.

Hidden gem
Domuzbükü, which translates as ‘Pig Inlet’, is a lovely turquoise bay which 
can only be reached by boat. A favourite stop on the famous Blue Cruise, so 
find a gulet (yacht) to take you there.

 A cafe in Eski Datça 
Once the peninsula’s main village, Eski Datça (Old Datça), lapsed into 
obscurity in the late 20th century. Now it has been partially restored by 
second homers from Istanbul, Ankara and further afield. It’s a beautiful 
patchwork of stone-paved lanes, kitchen gardens, pot plants, 
bougainvillea-drenched walls, and little cafes and shops. Drop into the old 
stone house of the late poet Can Yücel. In his poem, Testament, he wrote: “Bury 
me, my dear, in Datça. Near that view by the sea.”

Day-trip to Symi
Just 50 minutes to the south by boat from Datça town, Symi is the closest 
Greek island and makes for a winning day trip, partly because of the contrast 
between its neo-classical beauty and Datça’s rustic vibe. In the 19th century, 
the island flourished on sponge diving and boat building and many elegant homes 
were built. It’s a wonderful place for walking and discovering secret corners 
and houses with faded beauty. Boats leave from Datça town’s main harbour, or 
you can book a trip through any hotel.

The Carpet Weavers Association in Turgutkoy, on the nearby Bozburun peninsula, 
also makes for a good day out. Admire the skill of the weavers then haggle for 
their carpets and kilims.

There’s a dearth of fancy restaurants in Datça but, for a blow out, visit the 
D-Hotel. High up on the cliffs, it offers a prime slug of exclusivity. In 
addition to the amazing views, it encompasses several small islands, pine woods 
and five private beaches. There are six bars, each of which offers live music 
or DJ nights: Coliseum Beach hosts singers and jazz bands and specialises in 
cocktails; Zuma has established itself permanently after a successful summer 
pop-up – itsizakaya-style of shared eating and drinking includes a robata grill 
and sushi counter; and Ruia exposes Turkish culinary roots in a sophisticated 
way.

 The Olive Farm 
The Olive Farm, Datça town

Down a rough track banked with tall trees, this bucolic haven offers 
farm-to-table lunches, ponies to pet, hammocks to lie in, bougainvillea-banked 
paths to wander down, and avocado and pomegranate trees to loll beneath. An 
American established the working farm in 1995 with the purpose of exporting 
Turkish olive oil to the States; 10 years later, it passed into Turkish hands. 
The farm has since expanded, gone organic (the olives are cold-pressed on the 
premises), and added a guesthouse with 10 rooms and a pool. The Mill Store 
sells the organic oil as well as vinegar, toys made from olive wood, fruit, 
herbs and jam, molasses and even beauty products made from the oil. If you 
check into one of the five suites, the breakfasts are divine.
