WA Labor has vowed to scrap the “deeply flawed” $1.9bn Perth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/perth-news> Freight Link if it wins 
the March election, but the state government says it’s a reckless move that 
will cost jobs and throw away federal funding.


Western Australia’s opposition leader, Mark McGowan, said on Wednesday that 
the newly signed Roe 8 contract would be renegotiated immediately upon Labor 
forming government, freeing up $1.7bn in funding for more worthy 
“congestion-busting” projects, with $236m to be used on three other projects.

Labor would also start planning an outer harbour at Kwinana to complement 
Fremantle port, which will reach capacity in 10 years.

The legal advice Labor received from the former WA solicitor general Grant 
Donaldson indicated that renegotiating the Roe 8 contract would incur a modest 
cost.

McGowan described the project as a “monumental waste of money” that made no 
sense in terms of planning, the economy or the environment, and called on the 
premier,Colin Barnett <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/colin-barnett>
, to halt work until March.

The Perth Freight Link has become a key election issue and McGowan said the 
public had a choice between supporting Labor’s comprehensive plan or the 
Liberals’ short-sighted road to nowhere.

But the transport minister, Bill Marmion, said Labor had a “silly idea” and 
the cost of breaking the contract would be about $40m.

The deputy premier, Liza Harvey, said McGowan’s plan was his most reckless 
decision yet and insisted that the Perth Freight Link would ease congestion.

Harvey said Labor would be throwing away $1.2bn worth of federal government 
investment, which is tied to the project, and 3,360 jobs would be lost.

But McGowan said he expected the commonwealth to back WA Labor, just as it 
supported the Victorian Labor government’s decision to scrap the East West Link.

“We would expect and in fact demand that the commonwealth respect the will of 
the people ofWestern Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/western-australia>,” he said.

Labor would take $236m from the Perth Freight Link to spend on three projects, 
with some funding already previously assigned, and McGowan said they would 
create jobs.

This would include bringing forward funding for the $145m Armadale Road dual 
carriageway between Anstey Road and Tapper Road, $166m for the Armadale Road 
Bridge, and $95m to build two new overpasses on Wanneroo Road.

The Greens’ Lynn MacLaren said it should not have taken a looming election for 
the ALP to make its position on the Perth Freight Link clear but she supported 
the decision.

The City of Cockburn mayor, Logan Howlett, said the city and thousands of Roe 
8 protesters were delighted, adding that the council had maintained its strong 
stance against the wanton destruction of the wetlands and banksia woodlands, 
and the adverse impact on Indigenous culture and heritage.

The project has also been part of an ongoing legal battle involving the Save 
Beeliar Wetlands group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/03/western-australia-puts-16bn-perth-freight-link-on-back-burner>
, with a hearing scheduled for Friday in the federal court, after a lost bid in 
the high court.


The group says an agreement has been reached to have no more clearing work 
done until Monday. “We are seeking an injunctive relief against any 
recommencement of the construction of Roe 8, which may lead to irreversible 
impacts such as clearing,” said the group’s convenor, Kate Kelly.
Roe 8 would extend Roe Highway from Jandakot to Coolbellup, passing through 
the wetlands.
