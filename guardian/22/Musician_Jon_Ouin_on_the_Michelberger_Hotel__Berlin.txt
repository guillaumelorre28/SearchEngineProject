If the band are ever on tour in Berlin, the Michelberger Hotel 
<http://michelbergerhotel.com/> is one of our favourite places to stay. It’s in 
the Friedrichshain district, close to the Oberbaum bridge. It’s an 
early-20th-century factory transformed into a boutique hotel by a co-operative 
that includes furniture designer Werner Aisslinger. The rooms are stylised to 
the point of absurdity, the designers delighting in incongruous decor. One 
room, Das Golden One, is comically obscene, with gold bedding, a gold en suite 
and a gold statue of a dog. Other rooms are festooned with bits of rope, bare 
flex and untreated wood.

There are art books and novels to flick through while you drink bison grass 
vodka withapfelschorle (fizzy water and apple juice). Much of the rest is 
inexplicable: the entrance to the hotel has a sign that says Honolulu, the Big 
Lebowski is on a loop in the hallways, and it serves its own brand of coconut 
juice. The whole place has a cheeky, scatterbrained sense of humour.
