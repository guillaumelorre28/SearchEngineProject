There was no change at the top in the general classification, with Nairo 
Quintana maintaining his 3min 37sec lead over the Tour de France championChris 
Froome <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome> by finishing with the 
Briton.

Froome endured a dismal stage on Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/04/vuelta-a-espana-nairo-quintana-extends-lead-over-chris-froome-after-stage-15>
, finishing 2:40 behind winner Gianluca Brambilla and 2:37 down on Quintana, 
allowing the Colombian to tighten his grip on the red jersey.

The German pair Rüdiger Selig and Nikias Arndt finished second and third 
respectively, recording the same time as Drucker, who claimed his first ever 
win in a Grand Tour.

“I suffered a lot the last days but I always kept believing in the sprint 
stages,” said Drucker. “I did a good Tour of Burgos and I was confident in my 
sprint. It’s nice. It’s cool to have a victory in a Grand Tour.“

Johan Esteban Chaves stays third and 20 seconds behind Froome, with five 
stages remaining of the Tour, which finishes on Sunday 11 September. Tuesday is 
the second and final rest day of the race.

Froome’s few remaining opportunities to gain some ground on Quintana lie in 
the two remaining mountain stages on Wednesday and Saturday, while his best 
chance of eating into the Colombian’s lead could be in Thursday’s individual 
time trial.
