As we reach the final month of the year and the chequered flag of 2016 edges 
into view, we’re looking for your songs on the theme of finishing.


You have until 11pm on Monday 12 December to post your nomination and make 
your justification. RR contributorSarah Chappell  
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarah-chappell> (who posts as AFictionHabit
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10102877> in the comments) will 
select from your recommendations and produce the playlist, to be published on 
15 December.

Here is a list of all songs previously picked 
<http://www.rrindex.com/azsong.htm> and therefore ineligible for the series.

If you want to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions – and 
potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian – please email 
matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line “RR guru”, or make 
yourself known in the comments.

Here’s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:

 * Tell us why it’s a worthy contender. 
 * Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of 
a song’s words. If sharing links, make sure there is appropriate copyright 
permission.

 * Listen to others people’s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative 
Spotify playlist. 
 * If you have a good theme <http://www.rrindex.com/aztopic.htm>, or if you’d 
like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions, please email
matthew.holmes@theguardian.com <mailto:matthew.holmes@theguardian.com> 
 * There’s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are “zedded”, at 
theMarconium <http://www.rrindex.com/glossary.htm>. It also tells you the 
meaning of “zedded” (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), “donds” and 
other strange words used by RR regulars. 
 * Many RR regulars also congregate at the ’Spill blog 
<http://thespillblog.co.uk/>.
