1. Tate Modern Switch House, London, by Herzog & de Meuron

Jutting up behind Giles Gilbert Scott’s stately temple of electricity like an 
aggressive brick Dalek, the Tate ModernSwitch House 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern> is one of the strangest buildings to 
appear in 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/23/first-look-inside-tate-moderns-power-pyramid>
. And its power comes from its refusal to do anything that you might expect.

In an age when public buildings are supposed to be transparent and welcoming, 
it is opaque and brusque, a forbidding monolith that speaks more of a 
watchtower than a gallery of modern art. It meets the street not with arms wide 
open and a friendly smile, but with a fortified bastion wall of brown concrete, 
like a rammed-earth rampart. The entrance isn’t grand and ceremonial, but takes 
the form of a low slot around the back, through which visitors shuffle like 
mice. The structure and materials are just as counterintuitive: the brick walls 
don’t carry their load, they hang like chainmail, forming a kind of masonry 
veil draped over the chunky concrete skeleton within, only pierced by 
arrow-slit windows.

This unsettling tower of Babel is the work of Swiss architects Herzog & de 
Meuron, who first brought their light touch to the design of the originalTate 
Modern <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tate-modern> in 2000, 
undertaking the biggest loft conversion ever seen. Sixteen years on, they have 
matured from restrained floorboard-sanding minimalists to full-blown 
expressionists (as the billowing Elbphilharmonie, below, also attests), 
crafting an exhilarating vertical journey of Piranesian spatial power.

Rising from the Stygian underworld of the power station’s former oil tanks, to 
the panoramic views at the crow’s nest summit, the building leads you through 
an unfolding sequence of radically different spaces, from little cave-like 
areas carved out beneath the concrete staircase, to a gaping, 64-metre-long 
hangar. It all adds up to a tangled knot of riddles – with floors sloping 
almost imperceptibly, the structural cage expanding to provide seating nooks – 
that’s as intriguing as the work on show.

“Never demolish, never remove or replace – always add, transform, and reuse!” 
This is the rallying cry of French architects Lacaton & Vassal and Frédéric 
Druot, masters of estate refurbishment, who transformedthree ailing concrete 
slab blocks <https://www.lacatonvassal.com/index.php?idp=80> in a 1960s estate 
in Bordeaux with a deft economy of means. They wrapped the existing buildings 
with new, deep facades, extending the flats by four metres, with full-height 
windows – all on a budget of just €65,000 per home. A model for how Britain’s 
postwar estates could be renovated.

Seven years late and 10 times over budget, Herzog & de Meuron’s €789m glass 
mountain finally opened this year –and it was well worth the wait 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/04/hamburg-elbphilhamonie-herzog-de-meuron-a-cathedral-for-our-time>
. From the curving, sequin-lined escalator at the entrance, to the bulging 
glass facades, to the scaly, coral-like lining of the auditorium, it is a 
project that revels in its strange material experiments and the theatrical 
experience of moving through its carved-out spaces, which exude unparalleled 
intricacy and complexity. You canstay there <http://www.westinhamburg.com/>,

Standing at a crossroads in the centre of Basel like a big chunk of rock 
freshly hewn from the Alps, the newKunstmuseum 
<http://www.kunstmuseumbasel.ch/en/home/> has a suitably geological weight for 
a building that houses the oldest municipal collection of art in the world. The
sharply chiselled edifice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/04/hamburg-elbphilhamonie-herzog-de-meuron-a-cathedral-for-our-time>
 uses three shades of brick to give a stratified, sedimentary quality, while 
the galleries are designed as a suite of intimate rooms. It is a refreshing 
departure from the prevailing fashion for big, open-plan halls.

 beginning to gain momentum across London, in defiance of Tory housing policy, 
the first phase of theBacton Estate regeneration 
<http://karakusevic-carson.com/work/bacton-low-rise-estate> in Camden comprises 
around 50 new social-rented homes, with a mixture of four-bed townhouses and 
two-bed maisonettes cleverly interlocked in a handsome brick block. Developed 
with the close involvement of an active residents’ association, it shows how 
councils can do it for themselves, retaining value in perpetuity, without a 
developer creaming off the profit.

 of Norway’s national identity. The cafe building, where Anders Breivik 
murdered 19 students before killing a further 50 on the island, has been 
retained as a stark relic, its walls sliced with Matta-Clark rawness, and 
encased in a simple timber and glass pavilion.

An imaginative reinvention of the almshouse for the 21st century, Holmes Road 
<http://www.peterbarberarchitects.com/holmes-road-studios/>, Kentish Town, 
provides a stepping stone for homeless people to gain the skills and confidence 
to move on to independent living, with 59 micro-flats, counselling spaces and 
training facilities arranged around a planted courtyard garden. The units have 
a clever compact plan, conceived as double-height barrel-vaulted studios, with 
a mezzanine for the bed above an en suite bathroom, while circular windows and 
rooftop skylights bring light flooding in.
