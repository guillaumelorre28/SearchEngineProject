A close friend of the Labor leader, Bill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten>, has been charged 
over allegations of vandalism at a Melbourne polling booth on election day.

Andrew Landeryou, the husband of the Labor senator Kimberley Kitching, will 
face Melbourne magistrates court in February on five counts of theft and five 
counts of criminal damage.

Two other men have also been charged over the incident – David Asmar faces the 
same 10 charges, as does Dean Sherriff who is also charged with assault. The 
men were all involved in the election campaign for the Melbourne Ports Labor 
MP, Michael Danby, in what is a marginal electorate.

Landeryou notoriously fled the country in 2004 and was declared bankrupt after 
his return in 2006. The failed businessman is also a former political blogger, 
whose posts attracted controversy.

Shorten is a friend of both Landeryou and Kitching. In October, it was 
revealed that Shorten wentagainst the advice

 of his colleagues by backing Kitching to replace Stephen Conroy in the Senate. 
The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, described her appointment as a “union 
stitch-up”.

In 2014, the trade union royal commission made adverse findings about Kitching 
and referred her for possible prosecution. She was never charged.

Asmar is a close political ally of Shorten’s who was implicated in a Victorian 
branch-stacking scandal.

Sherriff has worked as an industrial officer with the embattled Health Workers 
Union. The union’s secretary is Asmar’s wife, Diana.

The men were arrested on 2 July, polling day, at 2.40am in St Kilda, with 
police seizing box cutters from the car the men were travelling in. At the 
time, Shorten said “anyone in an election who is conducting vandalism deserves 
to have the book thrown at them”.

The men will appear before the court on 15 February.
