On Sunday night Donatella Versace <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/versace>
, a pocket-rocket of a designer from Milan, opened the haute couture shows in 
Paris with a collection that was both modern and rooted in reality. Well, at 
least as much rooted in reality as it is possible to be when talking about 
evening dresses costing more than £10,000.

Her collection was named “Athletic Couture” and featured dresses with 
ergonomic lines which traced the models’ curves, harness straps and white ski 
pants and matching zip tops highlighted with orange go-faster stripes all of 
which could loosely be termed sporty. Before the show the designer said: “I was 
thinking about women at their most focused and dynamic … women who push 
themselves to the limit.”

Dreams and magic, rather than focus and dynamism, are the more usual 
vernacular of couture. But this collection tapped into the modern trend of 
“ath-evening” – wearing posh tracksuit bottoms with high heels or shoulder 
baring tops with racer backs which recall performance sportswear, to aswanky 
evening event

. It’s a concept which rejects the fusty notion that a gilt edged invitation 
demands the kneejerk response of a floor length, cocktail dress. That feels a 
bit too Nancy Reagan-era White House for now. In this context it was refreshing 
to see a designer using current trends to influence even the highest levels of 
a brand’s design repertoire. It was a move that younger couture customers – 
looking for something that little bit more relevant – will appreciate.

So much about the world of haute couture celebrates the past. Dresses as 
weighed down with an over-reverance to the history ofles petits mains and the 
workmanship of the ateliers as they are with bugle beads and crystals.

Much of the big names on couture schedule are designed by men – the world of 
couture can feel very backward sometimes.

But Donatella’s Versace is different. In couture terms the brand is an 
ariviste (it rejoined the couture rosta only four years ago). What is more the 
designer’s approach feels modern and open. The Versace family has been no 
stranger to scandals in the past but Donatella’s Versace is one where knowing 
irony lives happily alongside high glamour and sexually charged designs. Look 
up her Instagram account if you are unconvinced.

The designer herself was at pains to highlight Versace’s modern point of 
difference. She noted that “couture is not about the past, it is a living 
tradition.” To emphasis this still further the designer had used silicone gel 
throughout the collection – a forward-thinking kind of couture decoration which 
looked as if a spirograph had been involved.

Chunky crystal ropes (which recalled those sugary shoelace sweets) were 
knotted and threaded in and out of evening gowns. Flashes of highlighter orange 
and neon yellow – the sort of colours seen on performance trainers – were a 
motif throughout the show. There was a catsuit with ski-pant stirrups and a 
white evening gown which looked as if a neon yellow swimsuit was worn 
underneath.


Dynamism, strength and athleticism may have been the starting point, but there 
was plenty of femininity too. Supermodels dressed in cobalt blue and acid 
tangerine dresses wearing four inch heels can never really be accurately 
described as looking ready to compete in track and field. The couture levels of 
craftsmanship and technical accomplishment of the atelier were also keen to be 
highlighted by the Versace team – journalists were briefed that one crochet 
dress took a month to complete.


Summing up the show the designer said: “This collection is one of the most 
complicated, sophisticated and technically accomplished that we have ever 
created.” Like the evening wear design her clients will likely lap up, 
Donatella Versace is not about modesty. Nor should she, or they, be.
