Winning tip: Jaja


Just behind the hustle and bustle of the Marais is a hidden little entrance to 
Jaja, a cosy little alfresco parcel of peace. Not your stereotypical Parisian 
bistro, Jaja is Paris’s modern alternative. Pick a table in the jungle-like 
courtyard (if it’s raining, it has a lovely conservatory) and enjoy this hidden 
gem. The food is gorgeous, and even has vegetarian options, which is rare in 
the city. All its wines are from independent French vineyards.

On the way out or back from Père Lachaise cemetery 
<http://www.pere-lachaise.com/perelachaise.php?lang=en>, hop off at St Maur 
metro station to visit this nearby indie bistro specialising in food with a 
Breton twist. Named after a Nick Cave song about PJ Harvey (whom he was dating 
at the time) on 1997 album The Boatman’s Call, this really is, as the lyrics 
say, “something to look forward to”. The savoury crêpes – Montbéliard sausage 
with cheese or, if you are vegetarian, sautéed leek and melted cheese are to 
die for (therefore unavailable to those interred in the cemetery), washed down 
with cider. It is scuffed and retro - you could imagine Nick Cave and PJ Harvey 
sitting in here.

Effortlessly laid-back, while still maintaining the busy hustle of a popular 
bistro, Mascotte Montmartre, 10 minutes’ walk from the Sacré-Coeur, makes for a 
great Parisian evening out. It specialises in fresh seafood – portions of the 
excellentmoules-frites are wonderfully generous – and the service is attentive, 
but not pushy. The best bit, though, is just watching the rest of the world 
pass by along one of Montmartre’s liveliest streets.

Whether it has been an early morning coffee and eggs Benedict, steak tartare 
at lunch, or lounging at dinner with a cocktail and perfectly seasoned 
escargots, Café St Regis offers charm, courteous staff, delicious French 
staples and a taste of French bistro life that keeps me returning for repeat 
visits during my trips to the city. It has cosy booths and traditional 
black-and-white tiled floors and its setting on the Ile Saint-Louis helps sets 
it apart.

A stone’s throw from Place de la République, this friendly, intimate bistro is 
in a beautiful, wood-panelled turn-of-the-century pharmacy. Traditional dishes 
are cooked with modern flair – the salmon gravlax is served with a delicious 
passion fruit and saffron cream (€10). The venison fillet is coupled with 
butternut squash purée and mouth-watering creamy peppered gravy (€20). Among 
the €9 puddings is an exquisite salted caramel fondant withcrème anglaise, 
which oozes warm caramel. With an extensive and reasonably priced wine list, 
this is an affordable find in an area that is generally swamped by overpriced 
touristy restaurants.

Small, affordable and atmospheric, this bistro is owned by Michelin-starred 
chef Christian Constant and just 10 minutes’ walk east of the Eiffel Tower. It 
has a zinc-topped bar, tiny tables squeezed close together, a lively fun 
atmosphere, friendly waiters, and a mix of locals and tourists. Prices are 
reasonable – €16 for a main dish such as beef stew or chicken – and everything 
is home-cooked. Among the desserts are enormous ice-cream-filled profiteroles, 
generously poured with chocolate sauce – sensational!

Walking past this bistro’s black exterior and modern decor, you may not be 
instantly attracted, but take the risk. The light-hearted waiters talk you 
through an abundance of bagels and a wide variety of fresh fillings. The 
friendly service continues to the coffee, served with a heart-shaped cocoa 
topping. Make room after the scrumptious bagel for some amazing desserts 
including Nutella muffins.

The foodie traveller ... tries a seaside special in Paris

In a quiet street in the 19th arrondissement close to Parc des 
Buttes-Chaumont, this bistro was a star find. Our party chose pigs’ cheeks, 
beef steaks, kangaroo, lamb shanks with rosemary and escargots followed by some 
beautifully presented desserts. The bill for six was just €120 including wine. 
The decor inside is unassuming, but don’t let that put you off – “honest” is a 
better description, for this is a real Paris bistro bar and there is nothing 
contrived about its appearance. On the way out, we noticed a little glass 
display box with models of disturbing, gory scenes – I don’t know why!

This wonderful little bistro has links to the carpenters’ guild, whose 
illustrations form the basis of the decor. The menu is composed of simple but 
well-executed traditional dishes, with the duck a particular highlight. The 
lack of English reviews online points to it being a locals’ restaurant, but the 
staff were very welcoming; when our waiter noticed that I had finished my wine 
while my friend was still a long way off finishing hers he brought me another 
glass on the house which, if nothing else, guarantees a return visit.

This is actually a duplicate of its older New York sibling of the same name, 
complete with tin ceiling and marble bar. The waiters are friendly, flitting 
effortlessly between tables, and between French and English. Buvette serves 
medium-sized sharing plates and everything was excellent. The creamydauphinoise 
potatoes provided the culinary comfort we were searching for given that this 
was the week after the Paris attacks. The generous chocolate mousse was so 
good, I started laughing and then actually cried! The bill for two came to €56 
including a glass of red wine (€7) and a champagne negroni cocktail (€11).
