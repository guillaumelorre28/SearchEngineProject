A record number of women now use contraception. The latest figures from the 
UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs show 64% of married and 
cohabiting women used modern or traditional methods of contraception in 2015 – 
a significant rise from 36% in 1970. But the figures show wide disparities 
between and within regions and countries.

Data refers to women aged between 15 and 49 who were married or living with a 
partner.
