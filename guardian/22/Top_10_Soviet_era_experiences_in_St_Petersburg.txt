Walk among Stalinist-era buildings


St Petersburg’s architecture  
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/16/st-petersburg-russia-rooftop-tour>
is one of its biggest attractions. The centre’s original baroque and classicism 
styles have been preserved, so it’s almost as if the USSR never happened here. 
However, if you travel to the Moskovskiy district you’ll see the full scale of 
the Stalinist neoclassical architecture. It has been said that the tall grey 
buildings with giant columns and Soviet insignia were meant to oppress the 
citizens into obeying the communist party. See for yourself by starting a walk 
at the end of Moskovsky Prospekt at the Moskovskaya metro station, and then 
walk back towards its beginning at Sadovaya station. Look out for the two 
largest, classic examples of the style: theHouse of Soviets

Prospekt, and theSpire Building at 190 Moskovsky Prospekt

Life in the Soviet Union was not too sweet but at least one aspect of it was 
known to be literally covered in sugar: the famous Leningradpishki. Still 
served in one of the oldest cafes (and named after them) in the city centre,
pishkis are ring doughnuts dusted with powdered sugar. They are the cafe’s only 
dish, and the proper way to eat them is with Soviet-style coffee – pre-mixed 
with milk and sugar in a large pot, a concoction that divides Russians like 
caffeinated Marmite. The interior has also been largely preserved, with stone 
floors, old counters, uniformed cashiers and standup tables. The place has a 
legendary reputation among locals and savvy Russian tourists, so there might be 
a queue to get in during the high season.

This unusual private museum, concentrating on the 20 post-war years, showcases 
everyday objects from 50s Leningrad. The exhibition is fascinating for lovers 
of vintage and those curious about day-to-day life in the Soviet era. There is 
a big collection of women’s items such as cosmetic and perfume bottles, 
magazines, purses and gloves, as well as homeware and toys. The museum has the 
atmosphere of a Soviet apartment (in fact, a real communal apartment existed on 
the site until a few years ago), with no labels or other usual museum signs – 
which is not a problem since most of the items are self-explanatory.

Banya, the Russian sauna
 Degtyarniye Bani 
Even though banya is a Russian tradition, the modern incarnation was largely 
shaped in Soviet times, when many people in Leningrad ended up living in large 
communal apartments where several families had to share one bathroom – and a 
hot sauna was a salvation for those craving a good scrub. The process is not 
just about cleaning: Russians say it refreshes the soul. Visit Degtyarniye 
Bani, which has been going for over 50 years, and choose the slightly more 
expensive Russkaya parnaya (Russian steam room) option for the authentic 
experience. If you’re feeling brave order the venik treatment, a form of herbal 
massage where you get hit with bundles of twigs and branches. Yamskiye Bani is 
a more affordable option – no treatments on offer but, according to legend, 
Dostoyevsky and Lenin favoured this place.

Eating out in Soviet Leningrad, like the rest USSR, was not common: cafes and 
restaurants were scarce, expensive, and hard to get into. However, places that 
sold affordable fast food have not only managed to outlast the regime, they 
have gained cult-like status. The most common are calledchebureki: a 
traditional Tatar dish of deep-fried half-moon pies filled with meat or cheese. 
The dough is supposed to be flaky and crunchy, and the filling juicy and 
slightly spicy. For a restaurant meal go to Salhino, open since 1962, and for a 
more affordable lunch and Soviet canteen experience choose Cheburechnaya on the 
Petrogradskiy Island – it may look shabby, a mix of perestroika and 90s styles 
inside, but locals swear by this place.
• Chebureki from £3 at Salhino, Kronverkskiy Prospekt 25, or from £1.50 at

In old photos, the streets of large Soviet cities look deserted; cars were 
expensive and difficult to get and you had to join a queue for a chance to buy 
one. That’s why having a car, especially the highly coveted Volga, was a point 
of pride for the owners and the object of jealousy for others. Now, keeping and 
looking after retro Russian cars is becoming a hobby, albeit a rather expensive 
one, with old car parades taking place in Moscow, as well as smaller cities. In 
St Petersburg, several services offer retro cars for hire (usually with a 
driver), including the legendary Pobeda (Victory) model and the exclusive 
customised Volga made into a cabriolet. A more affordable option is a taxi 
service, also operated by retro Volgas.

This museum, just three years old, has become a must-visit for nostalgic 
Russians and curious foreigners. The display consists of more than 40 Soviet 
arcade games, most of them functioning and open for visitors to play on. A 
ticket gets you a short walking tour of the museum and 15 tokens to play the 
machines. There’s also a vintage soda vending machine where you can try a drink 
that Soviet teenagers drank instead of Pepsi and Coke.

Another must-visit museum – though a more sombre experience – this represents 
an important part of local history, and one which shaped the way the city 
developed. The city was besieged for 900 days during the second world war and 
the stories of hunger and air raids still travel through families. Locals will 
tell you stories of their grandmothers who survived the siege telling them off 
for throwing away food that had gone bad. The display is mostly in Russian but 
excellent English audio guides are available. One of the most shocking displays 
is the daily ration of food given out to citizens during the siege: 125g of 
brown bread.

This flea market, in a park in the suburbs, is the only one in the city. It 
might take some rummaging around to find something valuable, but on most days 
you will discover Soviet badges, toys, kitchenware and clothes – great 
souvenirs for vintage aficionados. Only go on the weekends; from Udelnaya metro 
station cross the rail tracks and keep going right through the modern part of 
the market, and mind your bags and valuables while there.

Visit a ryumochnaya, the Russian version of a pub

Ryumochnayas (the name is derived from the Russian word for shot glass) are as 
close as you’ll get to the drinking traditions of 19th-century Russia. Cheap 
and unpretentious, they were a step up from drinking at home (or in the 
street), the place to go if you couldn’t afford a restaurant in both the USSR 
and 90s Russia. The local favourite is Mayak Café, going since the 80s and now 
filled with Soviet memorabilia. There is no sign outside but you can spot the 
place by the large head of Lenin in the window. The traditional order would be
zakuski –Russian d’oeuvres of dill pickles, sausages, pickled herring – 
consumed with alcohol.
