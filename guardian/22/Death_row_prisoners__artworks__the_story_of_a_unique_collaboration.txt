The photograph shows trees silhouetted against the night sky, with a simple 
handwritten caption: "It has been 25 years since I have seen the stars in the 
open sky!" This is part of The Night Sky Series by Robin Paris, Tom Williams 
and Harold Wayne Nichols. Paris and Williams are both art teachers. Nichols is 
on death row; he really hasn't seen the sky for 25 years.

Tennessee's Riverbend Maximum Security Institution houses 79 prisoners on 
death row, 11 of whom have collaborated with artists from the local Watkins 
College of Art for the project Unit 2 (part 1), currently showing atNashville's 
Coop gallery <http://www.coopgallery.org/>. The Night Sky is described as a 
"surrogate" piece, the result of a prisoner asking artists to go out and 
capture an experience that is forbidden to them: a library full of books, a 
hearty breakfast prepared to precise specifications, a family portrait. Others 
are "add on" works, visual exchanges of drawings and text arising directly from 
the prison sessions. Donald Middlebrooks's "add on", Detroit Rebuilt: The 
Spirit Never Dies, contains an aspiration of hope and rejuvenation for a 
crumbling metropolis in its portrayal of two garages, one photographed, the 
other drawn. He says the project proves that he and his fellow prisoners "are 
more than that five minutes of time in our lives where we messed up".
