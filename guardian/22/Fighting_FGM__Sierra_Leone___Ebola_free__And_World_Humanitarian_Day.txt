Following Amnesty International’s decision to support the decriminalisation of 
the sex trade, Kay Thi Win, coordinator for the Asia Pacific Network of Sex 
Workers, describedwhy she supported the move 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/aug/18/sex-workers-welcome-amnesty-international-policy-help-empower-us>
. “We hope Amnesty’s decision will move the discussion firmly into the sphere 
of human rights, rather than moral or religious frameworks,” she said. And as 
World Water Week meetings take place in Stockholm, development economist Ian 
Rosscalled for greater accountability

To the people finding a women-only group sexist: this village exists as a 
refuge from a strongly paternalistic society that is often violent towards its 
women folk. These women have had experiences that mean they cannot feel safe 
around men. Not all men are violent, and perhaps those who aren’t can show 
their non violence by treating this need with respect, not judging, and keeping 
their distance.

I’m sure these women would prefer to live in a society where such a refuge was 
not necessary, but they don’t. This is not sexism: it’s healing.
