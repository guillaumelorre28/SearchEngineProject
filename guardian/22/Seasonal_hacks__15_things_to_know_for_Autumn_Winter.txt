Effortless Ellery goes with the flow

Asked who her ultimate customer is, Kym Ellery 
<https://www.instagram.com/kymellery/?hl=en> doesn’t pick one of the red-carpet 
usuals. Instead she goes left field: “Cleopatra – she’s a strong woman.”

The Australian launched her eponymous label in 2007 while a fashion editor at 
Russh magazine <http://www.russh.com/> in Sydney. It’s been a slow burn: these 
clothes aren’t showstoppers – but you soon come to rely on the draped silk 
blouses, blazers and flares. “Since 2012,” Ellery says, “it’s been intense, 
with double-digit growth every year.”

A move to Paris fashion week fulfilled a dream for the 33-year-old, who might 
live more than 10,000 miles away but has “a huge crush” on the French capital 
and design-wise is closer to Parisian chic than her homeland’s beach-ready 
style. This season’s corsetry-inspired collection is a case in point: lots of 
black, satin blouses, ruffle sleeves and cuissardes boots. “Volume is our 
signature. We use it in new ways, giving more fluidity around the body,” Ellery 
explains. “The idea was to make 18th-century essentials relevant again.”

Arguably her great strength lies in making clothes that are widely relevant, 
worn bySolange Knowles <https://www.theguardian.com/music/solange-knowles> and 
Miranda Kerr <http://www.mirandakerr.com/>, but also stocked at 
matchesfashion.com <http://www.matchesfashion.com/> and net-a-porter.com 
<https://www.net-a-porter.com/> where anyone can buy her no-nonsense chic. 
“Style should be effortless,” she says. “We talk about modern classics, 
timeless things women can use to build their wardrobes.” Cleopatra included.

With labels such as Vetements, Gucci and Henry Holland forcing us to redefine 
“ugly” and “beautiful” aesthetics, theBarbican exhibition The Vulgar 
<http://www.barbican.org.uk/news/artformnews/art/visual-arts-2016-the-vulgar> 
feels prescient. The show explores vulgarity in fashion from the Renaissance to 
now, looking at “exposure, performance and self-fashioning”, according to 
curators Judith Clark and Adam Phillips.

There will be specific sections focusing on bodily concealment and exposure 
(think: the Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren “tits” T-shirt) and fashion 
excess including a pair of 18th-century mantuas with an overskirt 2.5m wide. 
The exhibition, featuring work by Elsa Schiaparelli, Marc Jacobs and Raf 
Simons, is set to be an interesting intersection of ideas and examples. 
“Because fashion experiments with taste, it is more alive as an idea and 
creates an opportunity to consider a variety of uses and abuses,” Clark says, 
adding that modern fashion is meta about its relationship to the concept of 
vulgarity: “Pretending to be free but constrained by standards of taste, it is 
contemporary fashion that most tellingly exploits the predicament as parody and 
interpretation.”

The Vulgar: Fashion Redefined is at the Barbican from 13 October;

So there we were watching A/W16 catwalk show number 467 and, admittedly, a 
level of ennui had set in. That is until these jewel-encrusted sliders clacked 
by. Cue sudden and sustained interest in what looked to be the sort of slippers 
Louis XIV might have provided for his guests at the Versailles spa. Sliders 
have been A Thing in fashion for a couple of seasons and by piling on the 
embellishment, Miuccia Prada atMiu Miu has upped the slipper stakes 
<http://www.miumiu.com/en/GB/e-store/dep/shoes/cat/slippers/product/5XX115_3I33_F0136_F_B005#>
. The result? Yet another reason to ignore heels – it’s the weight not the 
height of the shoe that matters now.

If you can make it there, you’ll make it anywhere...

<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> show being the most obvious example 
and the naval jackets at Givenchy and Dolce & Gabbana more the subtle nods. 
Buyers, who basically earn their keep by betting on clothes’ shapes, told us

Guardian 
As far as Christelle Kocher is concerned, the new revolution in Parisian 
fashion – with Vetements, Gosha Rubchinskiy and her own line Koche – is 
actually more of an evolution. “Paris has always been the centre of 
creativity,” she says. “Now there is a new area of fashion with youth taking 
over.”

And Kocher is at the centre of it. Christelle launched Koche – a play on her 
surname – in 2014, and designs it while holding down a day job as artistic 
director of Christophe Lemaire. The collections bear the hallmarks of an 
illustrious career in design, including stints at Dries Van Noten and Chloé. 
She dubs the aesthetic couture-to-wear which means intricate embroidery and 
fabrics mixed with prints and T-shirt shapes. “They are items with the taste of 
couture,” the 37-year-old says. “We mix different aesthetics and create a 
dialogue between street and couture. It’s a brand where these different 
elements have a conversation.”

The mix is truly international – though born in France, Kocher has lived 
everywhere from London to Hamburg to New York. “It’s not just Parisian,” she 
says. “It’s a taste of all the places I’ve been.”koche.fr <http://www.koche.fr/>

 Bringing a bit of smoulder to style: Sebastiaan Pieter. Photograph: Kris 
Mitchell Photography 
Anyone hankering after something a bit more X-rated in menswear will get their 
satisfaction with Pieter. The label, by 28-year-old Dutch designer Sebastiaan 
Pieter, is now on its third season and becoming known for bringing a bit of a 
smoulder to style. For autumn, he was inspired by Robert Mapplethorpe but added 
the modern reference of gay dating app Grindr to bring the photographer’s work 
bang up to date. “I was always interested in Mapplethorpe and have one of his 
images on my studio wall,” Pieter says. “It’s a very traditional portrait but 
two of the men happen to be wearing leather and chains. It’s familiar and 
disturbing at the same time.”

For his collection, this translated into straps, leather trousers and zips, 
though they are far more SFW than those in Mapplethorpe’s work. Other designs, 
such as T-shirts with HH written on them – Grindr code for “high and horny” – 
are more risky, depending on who sees them. “The fun is that some recognise it 
and some think it’s just a nice graphic T-shirt,” Pieter says. “I really enjoy 
that.”sebastiaanpieter.com <http://www.sebastiaanpieter.com/>

Question: how to give a classic bag, in existence since the 1970s, a new spin? 
Answer: add matching shoes. Longchamp have done just that with their new 
loafer-skater hybrid, designed to complement the Pénélope bag. With the tassels 
and classic colour palette of the bag, the loafers have the same no-brainer 
wear and wear again appeal. A great addition to any shoe closet, whether or not 
they have the matching bag.longchamp.com <https://www.longchamp.com/>‎

Raey’s range is a wonderful midpoint between classic and futuristic, outré and 
traditional. It gently references both athleisure and the gender-neutral trend, 
but feels timeless, thanks to the quality of the fabrics. The 
matchesfashion.com collection features tracksuit bottoms made from herringbone 
and Game Of Thrones-ish knits. Creative director Rachael Proud says the 
collection comes from ever so slightly messing with the classics. Her starting 
points are always the fabrics rather than the concepts. So this season there’s 
gender-fluid tailored denim and hand-knitted cashmere funnel-neck tops. “If it 
were up to me, there wouldn’t be distinctions such as womenswear and menswear, 
there would just be one thing. I think men are more open to stuff these days,” 
Proud says. “There’s more variety in what they wear.”matchesfashion.com

Tibi keeps it clean

 Tibi: ‘wearable clothes that stand out just enough’. Photograph: PR company 
handout 
Tibi may not be a household name, but the label that designer Amy Smilovic 
defines as “luxurious, modern, refined but still relaxed and feminine” does 
have a devoted fanbase. The clothes aren’t directional but they are far from 
boring – in fact they hit the sweet spot to become that rare thing of wearable 
clothes that stand out just enough. Colours are often muted – lots of greys, 
blues and whites – and the knitwear alone justifies the cult following. 
Smilovic thinks this is down to keeping her goal – “to make it easy for women 
to look confident and effortlessly polished” – at the forefront of the design 
process. That, and making clothes that she wants to wear. “We design for the 
way a modern woman, including me, wants to dress,” she says. “I want clean 
styles, minimal details and designs that don’t take themselves too seriously.”

There will be new designs for each season, but classics will repeat. “It allows 
our clients to come back to us for those timeless styles that form the 
foundation of their wardrobes,” Trotter says. She has “spent almost every day 
in the white loafers”. That’s as good a recommendation as you can get.

Ryan Roche’s definitive look is based around comfort. It’s all loose-fit 
cashmere in gentle pinks, blues and neutrals, ranging from the sort of drapery 
the famous wear on long-haul flights to knitwear with edge. This is a happy 
marriage of texture, comfort and what Vogue describes as “ballerinas in 
rehearsal”.

Roche, now 38, grew up in a creative household in Idaho, “although there 
weren’t glossy magazines lying around”. Rather she was inspired by her 
grandmother’s knitting and a keen sense of familial DIY. “I lived an hour from 
the mall. We used to see things in the window and then copy them back home.” 
Though the first clothes she made were for kids, she moved into womenswear to 
great acclaim. It started with a shaggy cardigan that appeared in Vogue 
“alongside a few other things” and now her collections are being snapped up by 
Brooklyn types including Maggie Gyllenhaal and Jemima Kirke. She’s moved from 
the city to a 17th-century house in upstate New York, but her clothes remain 
the look for hip-luxe New Yorkers.ryan-roche.com <http://www.ryan-roche.com/>

 Bonnet by Christopher Kane AW/16 Photograph: PR Company Handout 
Ugly, mundane, nostalgic. Adjectives not often used in high fashion, unless 
describing Christopher Kane. His design CV already includes making abattoir 
shoe protectors and cable ties cool (niche skills there), and now Kane makes us 
rethink the rain bonnet. Usually found in a plastic basket on the chemist’s 
counter, beloved of old ladies who want to protect their shampoo and set, rain 
bonnets are interlopers on the catwalk. Kane’s beefed-up versions (created by 
Stephen Jones) were worn over wet-look hair and semaphored oddness, melancholy 
and humour.

The idea of elevating the ordinary is major in fashion right now. Kane’s 
contribution to this theme is a welcome addition because a) it legitimises 
wearing them at the bus stop in the rain, b) polka-dot rain bonnets sell for 
£6.45 for three on Amazon and c) umbrellas are just so beta.

See, buy, wear, love: Diesel denim on demand

Diesel joined the See Now, Buy Now revolution this month. A Tokyo show 
celebrated the brand’s 30 years in Japan – where creative director Nicola 
Formichetti was born – and showcased denim and ready-to-wear available to buy 
straight after. It all makes for an impressive example of how to get involved 
in a fashion revolution – and design some tough outerwear in the process.

In February, Alessandro Michele’s A/W16 Gucci 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> collection was spruced up with 
graffitied logos. The insignia came from the hand ofTrevor “Trouble” Andrew 
<https://www.facebook.com/troubleandrew/>; graffiti artist/partner of Santigold 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/santogold>/general Renaissance man, 
otherwise known as Guccighost. “Everyone said, ‘They’re going to sue you,’” 
Andrew explains, “but Alessandro got the message. He thought, ‘This guy is 
obsessed with Gucci, I want to work with him.’”

For Andrew, it was the DIY skate scene that opened his eyes to pen-in-hand 
self-expression. “I liked it because there are no rules,” he says. The 
Guccighost tag started life when Andrew cut eye-holes in some Gucci fabric and 
wandered about the streets of Brooklyn shouting his namesake to passersby. 
Andrew would later tag the GG symbol on bins and bathrooms around New York. “I 
was creating my own perception of where Gucci could go,” he says. The team-up 
with Gucci is a dream come true: “To work with a big brand like Gucci is like 
being acknowledged by the president.” That the likes ofBeyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce> are wearing the GG coat is amazing, 
too. “I had the jacket on yesterday and it smelt like Beyoncé.” What does she 
smell like? “A floral scent. It’s really nice.”guccighost.com
