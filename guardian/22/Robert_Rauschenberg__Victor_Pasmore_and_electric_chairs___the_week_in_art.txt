Exhibition of the week

Robert Rauschenberg
The hungry genius of Rauschenberg embraced everything from the space race to 
Dante’s Inferno – often in the same work. His neo-dada art of assemblage, 
collage and montage is still very much alive in 21st-century art. At an anxious 
time in US history, the creative abundance of one of its greatest artists is a 
reminder of its democratic culture at its inclusive best.

 The Townley Discobolus. Photograph: Trustees of the British Museum 
This version of one of the most famous artistic masterpiece of ancient Greece 
was excavated in 1791 at the villa of the Roman emperor Hadrian. It was 
restored and sold to the British collector Charles Townley, but he was 
suspicious that it had been dishonestly restored. He was right: the head comes 
from a different statue and faces the wrong way, making this a masterpiece not 
so much of Greek art as of 18th-century neo-classicism.

Jeff Koons, the US pop artist known for his balloon dogs and other kitsch 
sculptures, hasdonated this monumental sculpture to Paris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/22/jeff-koons-sculpture-tribute-paris-attacks-bouquet-of-tulips>
 to commemorate the terror attacks of November 2015. He called it a “symbol of 
remembrance, optimism and healing in moving forward from the horrific events 
that occurred in Paris one year ago”. It is currently being built, and will be 
installed next year outside the Museum of Modern Art and the Palais de Tokyo.
