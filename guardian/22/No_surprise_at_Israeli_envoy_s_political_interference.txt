I doubt whether Alan Duncan or anyone else critical of Israel will be 
surprised to learn of Shai Masot’s activities (Envoy plotted to set up 
pro-Israel political party groups 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/08/israeli-diplomat-shai-masot-plotted-against-mps-set-up-political-groups-labour>
, 9 January). One would have to be extremely naive not to recognise that so 
much of the negative reporting of any pro-Palestine stance is the result of a 
powerful Israeli propaganda effort. This has resulted in the deliberate 
misrepresentation of any criticism of Israel as antisemitism, even when it 
comes from Jewish individuals and organisations.

It has also enabled the denigration, whether motivated by malice or ignorance, 
of any politician who dares to support organisations like the Palestine 
Solidarity Campaign or Jews For Justice. As a member of the Labour party, I 
support its call for an investigation “into improper interference in our 
democratic politics” and would also support the suspension of the Conservative 
andLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> Friends of Israel 
groups, whose independence and credibility appear to have been undermined by 
these latest revelations.
