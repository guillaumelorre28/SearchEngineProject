I would love to say I start getting ready for a snazzy do at lunchtime, but I 
have two children, a dog and a husband, so it’s not until 4pm that I’ll close 
my bedroom door to make sure the kids and the dog are on the other side.

I shower and give my hair a wash and a deep cleansing treatment so I can 
control the spiral curls. Then I’ll de-fluff in the shower because, unless I’ve 
got a big night out, it’s not getting done.

My makeup takes 20 minutes. I put on primer before concealer and foundation, 
anything to stop the makeup sliding off, because I will be dancing; it doesn’t 
matter where I go, I always find music. I use Mac <http://www.maccosmetics.com/>

, and a lot of it comes from work. When I finish a job, they give me the makeup 
palette they’ve used. I still have Darcey’s eyeshadows fromCutting It

When I did the red carpet at the Golden Globes and the Oscars six years ago, I 
had a stylist who picked out the most beautiful blush, floor-length,Jenny

 with nude heels from New Look. I don’t like wearing heels but I like the way 
they make me look. I have size nine feet, so finding anything that fits is 
difficult.

I turned 40 this year, and I’m a lot less “fashion” than I used to be. I am 
not bothered about looking as if I’ve just walked out of a magazine. I am 
probably a bit cooler than I used to be; I was too try-hard before. There was a 
time when I would go, “I must wear something that comes fromHarvey Nichols

 if I am going to be photographed”. Now, I am head to toe in Topshop!.
