Yes, they’re all sequels or remakes, but here are five of the games our 
readers felt were cruellyoverlooked from our roundup of 2016’s best efforts.

1) Doom

‘Doom was our number 11’, said Guardian games editor Keith Stuart, 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89091932> responding to 
howls of indignation from those calling for the inclusion of the satisfyingly 
rebooted demon killing shooter.

Sigh...Very well then, DOOM ought to be on the list since it successfully 
updates a beloved shooter from yesteryear with modern elements like upgrades 
and character improvements whilst simultaneously reinvigorating the FPS genre 
with old school past-paced action. Shooters had gone stale by endlessly 
repeating the formulas developed in the noughties like waiting behind cover for 
your health to recharge, which doesn't benefit either the pace or realism. DOOM 
does away with all of that. Its stroke of genius is the glory kill system, 
which incentivises aggression. Ironically you stand more of a chance if you get 
right into the thick of it, meaning battles have a blistering pace and fluidity 
that hasn't been seen in the FPS for years. Does that meet with your 
satisfaction?

2) Civilisation VI

The latest in the venerable history-straddling turn-based strategy and 
conquest series won praise from our readers, whose angry complaints against the 
Guardian look likely to have real life consequences many thousands of years 
from now.

Absolutely outrages civilization 6 isn't on the list. 

I'm so outraged that I'm going to lead a small group of civilization fans into 
a previously uncharted corner of the earth where we'll give up our nomadic ways 
and found our first city. And then 4 to 6 000 years you're going to regret this 
slight guardian....oh how you'll regret it!!

“Civ VI should really be in there,” said another reader. 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89086609>

“I was worried that stacking mechanic on top of mechanic was going to turn the 
thing to mush but after a few games it really does work quite well.”

3) XCOM 2

And while we’re talking tactical turn-based games, here’s another that readers 
felt should have been in the top ten. “XCOM 2 over-delivers in almost every 
area, and more than that has faith in its players”,wrote Rich Stanton back in 
February 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/05/xcom-2-review-best-strategy-game-ever-truth-is-in-here>
. A brilliant concept, beautifully realised, some of you never stopped playing.

Will add to the voices lamenting the absence of XCOM2 to this list. The best 
strategy game of the year by some distance - challenging, constant 'meaningful 
choice' decision making and deeply satisfying gameplay. Sure it's got some 
rough edges, but a more than worthy successor to XCOM:EU.

A vast improvement on the original, Watch Dogs 2 gave players a likeable 
central character and a beautifully rendered open world to explore. Keith 
Stuart called it a “great, albeit not all-time great” game: some of you felt it 
was good enough to feature in the front phalanx of 2016’s offerings.

No Mention of Watch Dogs 2 on here.
I've got to say, I havnt enjoyed a game so much for a long time. Great fun, 
keeps me involved with the story line and a lot of variety in side missions. 
Stealth and combat is clever and a big bonus is its not in clumsy first person.
Goes top of my list.
