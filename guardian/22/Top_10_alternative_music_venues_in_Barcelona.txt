Sidecar Factory Club


In a former life, Sidecar – known phonetically to locals as “cedar car” – used 
to play host to singles nights for the US army, who would trot eagerly up the 
Ramblas to the Plaça Reial from the port. Sadly, you won’t find much military 
hedonism at Sidecar today, but the spirit of this American bacchanal remains in 
the venue’s devotion to guttural rock’n’roll, punk and garage rock.

Sidecar has hosted more than 4,000 concerts since it opened in 1982, with a 
small stage fit snugly into a beautifully lit, low-ceilinged cellar venue. It 
also hosts DJ sessions until the early hours, six nights a week, covering 
everything from ghetto funk to indie. Local bands are a speciality, but you’ll 
also get visiting acts likeBill Ryder-Jones <http://billryderjones.co.uk/> and 
Natalie Prass <http://natalieprassmusic.com/>. The recent problems at Heliogàbal
 <http://www.heliogabal.com/programacion.php?s=2> – long a home to 
up-and-coming local bands and now faced with potentially crippling fines for 
alleged overcrowding – make Sidecar, as well asFreedonia 
<http://www.freedonia.eu/donde.php>, more important than ever.

Rumba Catalana – a mixture of flamenco rumba, Cuban music and rock’n’roll 
which developed in Barcelona’s Romani community in the 1950s – is one of 
Catalonia’s most endearing musical legacies. You can still hear it all over 
Barcelona, but rarely in a venue as eye-catching as Gran Bodega Saltó, an old 
wine shop in Poble-Sec decorated with cartoon tigers, dolls and even a hybrid 
shark-carrot. The venue also plays host to blues, swing and other musical 
mixes. Even better, you can sample another great Barcelona tradition, the 
Sunday vermouth. Entry is usually free, but it gets busy, so get there early, 
when you can still see the decor.

For vinyl fiends, Barcelona is a paradise, with the city’s location making it 
a treasure trove of French, Italian, Latin American, Spanish and, of course, 
Catalan records, both new and secondhand. Most of the city’s record shops are 
located in El Raval, a brief sunshine stroll from each other, which makes a 
shopping trip the work of one very pleasant late afternoon. But if you can only 
visit one shop then Wah Wah Records is the pick, both for its exquisite 
selection of discs – it’s the kind of place where French prog rock has its own 
extensive section – and for the air of record shopping it gives off, with vinyl 
heaped on vinyl in chaotic piles.

L’Hospitalet de Llobregat is, technically, the second largest city in 
Catalonia and the 16th largest in Spain. However, it has become rather subsumed 
into the Barcelona sprawl: you’d struggle to fit a cigarette paper between the 
two cities, and it is well served by the Barcelona metro. That may be bad news 
for L’Hospitalet’s civic pride, but it’s a welcome development for anyone who 
wants to visit one of Catalonia’s most legendary indie music venues, Depósito 
Legal – orel Depo, as everyone knows it. AKA the “indie temple” of 
l’Hospitalet, El Depo was born in 1985 of the same free spirit that inspired the
Movida Madrileña <http://www.madrid-uno.com/society/movida.htm> (the 
countercultural movement that followed Franco’s death). These days it’s known 
for its friendly, unpretentious atmosphere and some of Catalonia’s best indie 
nights, calling on the region’s most established indie spinners, likeLuis Le 
Nuit <https://soundcloud.com/luislenuit>, Hal 9000 
<https://myspace.com/hal9000dj> and Monamí.

“Legendary” is overused in the musical world, but it’s hard to find another 
way to describe Jamboree, a venue that has played host to the likes of Bill 
Coleman, Chet Baker and Ornette Coleman since opening in 1960. Even today, the 
venue still plays hosts to two live performances a day – at 8pm and 10pm – 365 
days a year, offering blues, swing and funk, and predominantly jazz, while the 
Jamboree Dance Club hosts R&B, soul and hip-hop DJs from midnight. The music at 
Jamboree is uniformly brilliant. But perhaps even better is the decor: the 
venue is all low ceilings, exposed brick and darkness – precisely how you’d 
want a jazz club to look, in other words.

In a city where green space is at a premium, Parc de la Ciutadella is 
Barcelona’s beating heart, a 70-acre park to the north-east of Ciutat Vella 
where people go to relax, take the sun, walk their dogs and throw frisbees. 
It’s also an amateur musical hive, home to drum circles, buskers, practising 
trombone players, swing classes, improv jazz trios, the occasional live gig and 
even secret DJ sets, notably whenRichie Hawtin played the Ciutadella bandstand 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6nwxXSIL0U> during Sonar 2013. Primavera 
Sound may have moved its free gig programme from Ciutadella to Raval in 2016, 
but the park is warmly recommended for anyone who wants to bring their own 
instrument and join in the fun, or just experience the charming musical chaos 
of Ciutadella during a warm summer day.

Allegedly modelled on a typical bar in prewar Marseille, Bar Pastis is home to 
intimate live music performances in one of the most charming small spaces in 
Barcelona, all elderly wooden panels, faded pictures, low lighting and layers 
of random nostalgic trinkets, infused with the kind of corporeal smell that 
makes you wish they’d repeal the smoking ban. Expect tango, blues, folk and 
more, in a bar about the size of your lounge, where you can see the whites of 
the performer’s eyes, all for a €2 supplement on your first drink. The 
experience, both musical and alcoholic, is like stepping back in time.

In the late 19th century, Barcelona’s Poblenou district was known as “the 
Catalan Manchester”, thanks to its textile industries. In 2016, however, “the 
Catalan Manchester” is Manchester Bar, a higgledy-piggledy homage to the rainy 
city tucked away in a small square in Barri Gòtic, behind a Joy Division 
shutter (there’s a tiny sister bar in El Raval, at Carrer de Valldonzella 40). 
The music, as you might expect, is British to a tee – all Happy Mondays, Stone 
Roses and New Order, as well as the cream of modern indie – attracting both 
homesick exchange students and a surprising number of Anglophile Catalans, who 
cram into the corners of the darkened bar to drink and dream the night away.

relatively new venue in Poble-sec that devotes itself to the unconventional and

Switch


Technically this may be a bar, but its owners prefer to call it a “pocket 
club”, and, as you step down into this dark, mysterious, Gràcia locale, you can 
see why. There’s something essentially club-ish about Switch, from the 
brilliant sound system, thunderous yet clear, to the music – from dub techno to 
house, new wave and EBM, with few concessions to polite conversation. And yet 
the place is determinedly pocket-sized, with a small dance floor pushed up 
against a well-stocked bar in a way that determines you’ll make new friends as 
you tune in and Switch on. Gràcia certainly doesn’t lack for bars, but few are 
as intensely satisfying as Switch on a good night.
