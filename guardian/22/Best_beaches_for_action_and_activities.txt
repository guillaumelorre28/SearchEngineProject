North Shore Oahu, Hawaii: marvel at surf masters 


Each December, surfers compete for the coveted Pipeline Masters surf title. 
All the action takes place in cavernous barrelling waves that come close to 
shore. Oahu’s north coast also sees the world’s best big-wave competition: the
Quiksilver Big Wave Invitational 
<http://quiksilver.co.uk/surf/events/eddie-aikau/>, in memory of local surfer 
Eddie Aikau. It’s held only when the waves are more than six metres high. 
There’s an opening ceremony on 1 December each year, but the actual contest has 
run just nine times in 31 years.

This beach on Andalucia’s Atlantic coast is perfect for those who want to 
kitesurf by day and party by night. Home to the World Kitesurf Championships, 
the seven-kilometre stretch of white sand gets constant, year-round winds. By 
night, beach bars, clubs and restaurants offer a laid-back surfer vibe – with 
those same trade winds blowdrying your post-surf Patrick Swayze hairstyle.

Ben Quinn is a Cornwall-based chef who will take visitors out on his fishing 
boat, foraging in rock pools for oysters, mussels and crab, or line-fishing off 
a cliff for the ultimate beach barbecue. Think Poldark meets Hugh Fearnley 
Whittingstall. Ben’s HQ is Nancarrow Farm in Zelah, but he’ll go anywhere in 
north Cornwall and work out a menu based on how adventurous – physically and 
gastronomically – guests want to be.

With its warm water and hazard-free beach bottom, Freights, on the south coast 
of Barbados, has some of the world’s best beginner-friendly waves, though 
clearly it will cost you a bit more to learn there than back home in Croyde. 
When the swell hits, the long peeling, left-hand waves break at under a metre 
high, making it the ideal place to master surfing along the open face of a wave 
rather than straightlining back to the beach. The vibe is super-chilled, with 
friendly locals and some of the world’s best rum punch.

Although set within a nature reserve, this small haven of sun and sand comes 
with a soundtrack of gently thudding bass drums, because it is licensed to 
party until just after sunset. As the sun dips towards the horizon, bikini-clad 
dancers mingle with sunbathers on the ticklishly soft sand. (Those in search of 
something quieter will be happy to know that the secret beaches of Punta de Ses 
Portes are a short stroll along a footpath from the far end of the beach.) For 
an afternoon of classic, bouncy house, try Melon Bomb DJs’ secret parties at 
the Jockey Club.
