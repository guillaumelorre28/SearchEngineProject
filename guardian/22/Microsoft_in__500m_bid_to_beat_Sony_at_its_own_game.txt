Microsoft <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft> will spend a 
staggering half a billion dollars marketing its new Xbox games console.

Ed Fries, Microsoft's vice president of games publishing who will outline the 
software giant's vision of an interactive world later today at the European 
Computer Trade Show in London, told The Observer: 'We have very aggressive 
forecasts and we'll be spending more than half a billion dollars in the first 
18 months to promote the product worldwide. We're going to put a huge push 
behind Xbox.'

Fries hinted that Microsoft was preparing to take a massive hit on the Xbox to 
steal market share fromSony <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sony>, 
maker of Playstation II. 'We understand that price is crucial to any consumer 
market. Traditionally, the way a console business works is that you sell the 
hardware for less than it costs you to produce it and charge a royalty on the 
software. We believe we'll be very competitive on price.'

Later today Microsoft will announce that it has signed up 18 software 
development studios to write exclusive content for the Xbox, which will be 
launched late next year. Included in the line-up is the UK's Lionhead Studios, 
founded by Peter Molyneux, who made millions when he sold his original company, 
Bullfrog, to the world's largest games publisher, Electronic Arts.

Some console manufacturers have suffered from a shortage of good games. 
However, Molyneux said today's announcement meant Microsoft's commitment to the 
video game market was serious. 'It's a very important step forward. Without 
world class video game talent you're going to flounder.'
