The 24-year-old, who also won two Olympic golds at the venue during London 
2012, married the six-times Olympic champion Jason Kenny in September.

“I’m really excited to be back racing again,” Laura Kenny said. “I needed a 
break after the Olympics but I’m looking forward to getting back on my bike and 
enjoying racing after the pressure of Rio.”

Elinor Barker, who won team pursuit gold alongside Kenny in Rio, will race in 
round one of the Revolution series in Manchester this weekend.

The 14-times Paralympic champion Dame Sarah Storey is also in action in 
Manchester.
