If the dog had not started licking my kneecaps, I would never have made the 
discovery. I was in the shop ofAntica Dolceria Bonajuto 
<http://www.bonajuto.it/en/>, a 19th-century chocolate factory in Modica, 
Sicily, assiduously testing the various flavours on offer: ginger, cinnamon, 
fennel, cardamom and so on. I was wearing cycling shorts as I was travelling by 
bike.

“Are you wearing sun cream?” demanded the lady with the animal. She was 
Sicilian, but spoke English well. “He loves sun cream.” The dog was now down to 
my calves and licking like his life depended on Factor 50. She made a 
half-hearted attempt to pull him away. “Did they tell you about the Mares? No, 
of course not, they never mention it to the tourists, but that is so special! 
That is a jewel, a treasure! It is art!”

She reached along the polished wooden counter and fetched out a tiny blue box. 
She seemed quite at home, obviously a regular customer.Modica

 is famous among chocolate cognoscenti, the only place in the world where 
chocolate is still made by the old Atzec cold-working technique, bringing out 
subtleties of flavour and texture not found elsewhere. Housewives guard recipes 
that go back to when this Sicilian town was a major manufacturer for the 
Spanish empire. Even today, the supermarkets sell bags of cocoa mass ready to 
be mixed up with grandma’s secret ingredients.

The woman opened the tiny container and removed a small brown disc of 
chocolate. “Look, it took the expert Salvo Giannone a whole year to perfect 
it.” She became conspiratorial. “Under the dark chocolate is white, then a 
crispy layer of seaweed. It is exquisite! And wrapped inside, a tiny diamond of 
fish.”

The flavour was certainly peculiar: a battle of sweet, sour and salty that was 
finally won by fishy. I preferred the next delicacy:mpanatigghi, a concoction 
of beef mince, almonds, cinnamon and chocolate folded into a half moon of 
sugar-dusted pastry. A wonderfully bonkers take on the South Americanempanada.

If I had wanted an introduction to the profoundly complex and surprising 
creature that is Sicily, I could not have asked for a better one. I was cycling 
a tiny portion of the south-eastern corner of the largest island in the 
Mediterranean, but I had begun to see what makes it so special.

I had started in old Syracuse, itself an island called Ortigia, tethered to 
the mainland by two short bridges. Within a few minutes of rattling up its 
labyrinthine stone alleyways, I had encountered ancient Greek columns, Norman 
arches, Arab and Byzantine influences, and, of course, Italian driving. This 
last element is one that does not feature in theBritish Museum’s epic 
exhibition, Sicily: Culture and Conquest 
<http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/sicily.aspx> (until 14 
August) which focuses on the astonishing confluence of art and ideas that makes 
Sicily.

Ortigia is something of a jewel itself, easily worth a couple of days’ 
exploring. Its fine cathedral manages to combine successfully elements as 
diverse as 2,500-year-old Greek columns and a baroque façade. Somewhere in the 
surrounding narrow streets, in about 287BC, Archimedes was born, and since he 
spent his entire life in the city, it was also here, presumably, that he 
famously sprang from his bath shouting Eureka, discovered pi, and invented his 
many devices, notably the “burning mirrors” which allegedly held an invading 
Roman fleet at bay for some two years (did they never consider a night attack?).

 Ortigia, Syracuse. Photograph: Kevin Rushby for the Guardian 
I could have lingered a whole summer in Syracuse, but instead I had to rattle 
over the bridge, and dive into the traffic heading south along the coast road. 
Fortunately my fear of Sicilian driving proved unfounded: cyclists are given 
plenty of room and usually a merry tootle on the horn. I reached the town of 
Avola and parked the bike on the beach while I swam, then headed inland for 
10km to the town of Noto.

An earthquake in 1693 destroyed old Noto, and it was rebuilt in full-blown 
baroque style. It’s certainly ornate, but with some of the cold-hearted 
atmosphere of a Spanish colonial grid-pattern town: the palaces are too vast, 
the streets too straight. I preferred the smaller-scale domesticity of my hotel,
Giardino del Barocco <http://www.ilgiardinodelbarocco.it/en/content/welcome>, 
where owner Giovanni lives among his grandparents’ heirlooms, a fascinating 
collection of 19th-century middle-class Sicilian life (his grandfather was the 
town’s doctor). Any fan of Lampedusa’s classic work The Leopard will love this 
pint-sized palace with its air of gracious but down-at-heel gentility.

Back on the road next morning, I made it to Modica and the Antica Dolveria 
Bonajuto <http://www.bonajuto.it/en/> factory with its curious chocolate. From 
there I somehow took the wrong road, the fast one, up toRagusa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jan/31/sicily-winter-sun-holiday-restaurants>
, but then found an exhilarating descent through a series of hairpins into 
Ragusa Ibla, the most ancient part of the city, with its gorgeous central 
square, Piazza Duomo.

The last day’s riding was the best: a 55km swing through countryside, finally 
descending on narrow lanes into the Anapo valley, where I was supposed to be 
staying on a citrus farm calledSacre Pietre 
<http://www.sacrepietre.it/agriturismo.asp>. Only there was not a soul to be 
found. I went off and explored thePantalica <http://www.pantalica.org/>, a 
nearby nature reserve inside a deep limestone gorge, where bronze age burial 
caves pepper the vertical cliffs.

Returning at sunset to the farm, I was greeted by Vincenzo Pitruzzello, the 
farmer, an ebullient host who insisted on showing me all the various varieties 
of oranges, picking armfuls. The air was heavy with the scent of blossoms and 
moths as big as bats were starting to flit about.

Vincenzo and his wife, Nunzia, are not only famous for their oranges: the farm 
restaurant was filling up with eager diners. “Drink this homemade red wine and 
you’ll never get a hangover,” he declared “Up to one litre – no problem.” There 
were six courses of astonishing food to negotiate, but the highlight was 
spaghetticon le sarde. Anywhere else that would be simple: pasta plus 
pilchards. Not here. This was a miracle of fennel and herbs, with a sprinkling 
of sultanas. Where else but Sicily would such a combination exist?
