Speaking to the Daily Mail 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-3914584/Jess-Varnish-vilified-Shane-Sutton-sexism-claims-Sportsmail-rocked-British-Cycling-says-stand-everything.html>
, Varnish said: “I stick by everything I said. Obviously the comments made to 
me by Shane, they are sexist, you wouldn’t say it to a guy. I don’t want to 
throw words around but it is what it is.”

Last month British Cycling upheld claims made by Varnish that Sutton used 
“inappropriate and discriminatory language” towards her. Varnish alleges that 
she was told to “go and have a baby” but Sutton still protests his innocence 
and, on the announcement of British Cycling’s ruling, his wife, Abbie, tweeted: 
“two words spring to mind when the word liar is used…Jess Varnish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jess-varnish>.”

“To call me a liar? They’re allowed their opinion but the investigation has 
answered that,” said Varnish. “Obviously I know the truth, everyone around me 
knows the truth and in this investigation the truth has come out. Before the 
investigation it was harder but now I’ve been backed up it’s just an absolute 
relief.”

Sutton has recently admitted telling Varnish to “lose some timber” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/31/shane-sutton-denies-sexism-jess-varnish>
 but continues to deny allegations of sexism. “That conversation [with Varnish] 
has never taken place,” he said.
