 Accolades were also given to the top television series and stars in several 
categories. The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story was recognised as the 
best movie made for television or limited series.

 The Critics’ Choice awards are chosen by the more than 300 members of the 
Broadcast Film Critics Association (BFCA).

 Although its members are not usually part of the same guilds that pick 
nominees and winners for most of Hollywood’s awards shows, the critics’ awards 
help to build the buzz for potential Oscar front-runners.
