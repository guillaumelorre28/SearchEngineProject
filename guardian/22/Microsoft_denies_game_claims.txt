Microsoft <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft> will not take its 
Flight Simulator computer game off sale, despite claims that terrorists in 
Tuesday's attack may have used it to practise their deadly flight paths.

But the company said it will make changes to the game.

Microsoft has reacted with anger to speculation that the suicide pilots may 
have practised using the game, which allows users to pilot realistic flights 
over New York and other cities.

"It is highly inappropriate and speculative to say the terrorists may have 
used Flight Simulator," said a spokeswoman for Microsoft.

"It is counter to what the investigators are saying and is being circulated by 
the media. The purpose is to provide an entertaining and realistic game. It has 
to be realised that this is a game," she said.

"It helps and supports people but will not teach them to fly. We will 
absolutely not be pulling the game off sale, we don't feel it's appropriate."

But she said the computer giant will change an introductory voiceover at the 
beginning of the game in future editions which features the New York skyline 
and comments about "how cool" the flight is.

It will also issue a free "patch" within the game that will allow users to 
change the voiceover on existing games if they wish to do so.

The Â£44.99 game, which can be bought on the high street, boasts that its 
flight simulation is "as real as it gets".

It allows the player to tap in the co-ordinates of key landmarks such as the 
World Trade Centre or the Pentagon.
