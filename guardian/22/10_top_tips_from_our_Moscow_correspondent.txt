Kandinsky by the river


There’s plenty of art to see in Moscow, but the one unmissable stop is the new 
wing of the Tretyakov Gallery, in a vast Soviet building on the river 
embankment. The gallery houses Russian 20th-century art, and the centrepiece of 
the collection comprises Russian avant garde works.

Feast your eyes on Kandinsky and Chagall, including little-known sets the 
latter artist completed in 1920 for the Moscow Jewish Theatre. Malevich’s 
famous Black Square is also here. Anywhere in the west there would be long 
queues for this art; here, you’ll probably have the place almost to yourself. 
The gallery also houses a large collection of later Socialist realist art, 
impressive in its own way.

Cutting-edge theatre


Moscow has some great theatre, but most of it is off-limits to non-Russophone 
visitors for obvious language reasons. Gogol-Center, run by director Kirill 
Serebrennikov, has English subtitles for many of its performances. The modern 
stagings have often proved controversial in a city that still likes its art 
traditional, and not everything they put on here works. But the space itself is 
beautiful, the crowd is young and interesting, and many of the productions are 
innovative. Frequently in the repertoire is An Ordinary Story, a play by Ivan 
Goncharov, about a man coming to Moscow from the provinces, written more than 
150 years ago and updated to the present day.

Posh but simple cafe food


Dr Zhivago cafe, inside the Hotel National <http://www.national.ru/>, just 
across the road from the Kremlin, is the place to go for posh but simple 
Russian food. The high-kitsch Socialist realist interiors are fun, and the 
serving staff are friendly. Open 24 hours, it has different vibes at different 
times: watch brawny businessmen do breakfast deals over trout and cream cheese 
pancakes (£5), raucous family parties eat dinner, or bleary-eyed revellers pop 
in for post-boozing caviar (£32.50) at 4am. Thegolubtsy (stuffed cabbage 
leaves) with crayfish (£10.50) are divine, as are the fat juicy kamchatka crab 
legs smeared in butter (£11). Book several days in advance for dinner.•

Feast and fun in a historic theme park

VDNKh (pronounced veh-deh-en-kha), in the Ostankinsky district of the city, is 
a great place to spend an afternoon. Designed as a kind of Disneyland to show 
off the achievements of the socialist economy, each of the Soviet republics had 
a grand pavilion which used to hold exhibits. Now, many have shops or cafes in 
them (the restaurant in the Armenian pavilion is excellent). The huge grounds 
have been given a makeover of late and are now a pleasant place for a walk as 
you admire the architecture. Don’t miss the legendary Worker and Kolkhoz Woman 
statue outside. There’s also a cute space museum in the grounds.

Gorgeous Georgian grub


The Soviet Union was not known as a culinary paradise but, of all the 
different national cuisines, Georgian was the best, and Moscow has some of the 
best Georgian food outside Tbilisi. Sahli is one of the top places to try it; 
it’s not the cheapest, but worth every rouble. Non-intrusive live music on some 
evenings adds to the family atmosphere and cosy surroundings. Particularly 
worth ordering: succulent lyulya kebab (£9) andkhachapuri, the indulgent 
Georgian cheesy bread (£6). There is also a selection of decent Georgian wines.

Maxim Gorky House Museum

The area between New Arbat and Patriarch’s Ponds is stuffed with sumptuous art 
nouveau mansions, built for the wealthy merchant class in the years before the 
Russian revolution. Many are now embassies, but one you can get inside to gawp 
at (free of charge) is the magnificent Gorky House Museum. The house’s owners 
fled in 1917, and the mansion was handed over to the writer to live out his 
last years, after he returned from exile. Marvel at the extraordinary swirling 
shapes in the doors, windows and railings, and the overwrought Gaudi-esque 
staircase inside.

Get naked – in a good clean fun way


The banya is a quintessential Russian experience – the Slavic version of a 
sauna. The tourist-friendlySandunovskie baths <http://eng.sanduny.ru/> have 
impressive interiors but, for a more down-to-earth experience, try the 
Rzhevskie baths. The steam room is roasting hot and very humid; cool down by 
plunging into ice water; repeat. Men and women have separate sections. Banya 
etiquette is to purchase bunches of birch twigs and whip each other’s bodies. 
Afterwards, people relax with tea, beer and snacks in the changing area. It’s 
especially invigorating on a cold winter’s day, or with a hangover. Nothing 
quite matches the buzzy post-banya warmth and you will have never felt so 
clean. You’ll have to be comfortable with total nudity.

Cocktails and ‘concept drinks’


Necking vodka out of plastic cups at a bus stop is so 1990s. Today’s young 
Muscovites prefer to sip glasses of wine or and hipster-made cocktails. One of 
the best places to see this new Moscow in all its glory is Public Bar, a 
sharply designed subterranean cocktail haunt with low-key interiors and 
high-concept drinks. It’s tiny, so being turned away is always possible. In 
which case, retire to the perfectly decentcafé Iskra <http://www.iskrabar.ru/> 
upstairs for food or drinks.

A night at the opera

Moscow has four opera houses and, while you shouldn’t miss the chance to see 
something on the stage of the Bolshoi – if you can get a ticket – the others 
are also worth checking out. My personal favourite is the Helikon, where 
tickets are not much more expensive than a cup of coffee. For a small fee, you 
get sharp stagings of a mixture of classic and lesser-known operas in extremely 
intimate surroundings. Many performances have English subtitles. The Helikon 
also stages 40-minute performances in the foyer, during which the singers might 
pour you a coffee or a beer.

Stroll on a Sunday walk

Start with brunch at Strelka <http://www.strelka.com/en/bar> (in summer, have 
lunch on the terrace), before setting off on a long, lazy walk along the river 
embankment. Call into the Tretyakov (see above) and then walk on throughGorky 
park <http://park-gorkogo.com/en/places> which, in recent years, has been 
turned from a gloomy weed-strewn mess into a fun and pleasant space, full of 
cafes and activities. Pop intoGarazh <http://garagemca.org/en>, the museum of 
contemporary art run by Roman Abramovich’s wife, Dasha Zhukova, then continue 
all the way along the river until you reach Sparrow Hills (Vorobyovye Gory), 
from where you can take the metro back into town.
