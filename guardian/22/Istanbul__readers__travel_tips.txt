Winning tip: Vefa Bozacisi cafe

If your legs are weary from following the Byzantine walls, then a short 
detourdown the intriguing backstreets to Vefa in Mollahüsrev Mh is just what 
you need. This blast-from-the-past cafe with its marbled doorstep and 
smoky-glass windows has been selling the iconic drinkboza since 1876. Its owner 
will instantly serve you a glass brimful of this unusual, thick drink, made 
from fermented millet topped with cinnamon and roasted chickpeas.

This underground space is close to the much more famous Hagia Sophia. It was 
built in the third century AD by the Romans, one of many similar underground 
water storage caverns only discovered again in the 19th century by a British 
archaeologist.

station. Photograph: Alamy 
You can still soak up the atmosphere of travel 100 years ago by visiting 
Sirkeci railway station, originally the Orient Express’s eastern terminus, and 
its original, splendid cafe. Sip a coffee and conjure up Hercule Poirot and the 
stylish travellers of yesterday.

Misirli Ahmet is a darbūkah (goblet drum) virtuoso. The mysterious interior 
looks parttekke (monastery of dervishes) part clubhouse (he improvises rap 
beats and beatbox too) with 20-30 musicians playing with him at any time. Drop 
in to see it for yourself.

Join the swimmers early on Saturday mornings just under Topkapi palace, in 
beautiful clear blue water yet next to the passing tankers. Even if you haven’t 
got your trunks they’ll give a wave and a slice of watermelon.

Big Bath, Kasimpaşa

Fifteen minutes’ stroll from the Beyoğlu Tünel underground station is the 
working-class suburb of Kasimpaşa and my favourite Istanbul chill-out zone – a 
Turkish bath simply called the Big Bath. For £20, recline, sweat and release 
the city dirt on the “belly button” stone plinth. Massage is optional, as is 
the scrubbing glove. I recommend a freshly squeezed lemon juice (sitron sulu) 
with a bottle ofgazoz to add zing to the chillax. Bookend your visit with a 
glass of Turkish tea,çay, at the tea gardens lining the entrance.

Locally Istanbul: private tours 
 Locally Istanbul offers tailored tours that reveal the more authentic side of 
Istanbul. Photograph:Facebook.com/locallyistanbul 
<https://www.facebook.com/locallyistanbul> 
Guides take you to the underground coffee houses, the little-known eateries on 
the Asian side, the smartly renovated buildings off the beaten track and the 
hippest boutiques. We learned so much about the up-and-coming designers in the 
city. Erk is also very knowledgeable about the political scene. The guides are 
smart and fascinating. They leave the historical sites to the experts but make 
sure you see the real city – on foot, by boat, tram, and in their car.

Underneath tourist-thronged Hagia Sophia is an oasis of calm in the form of 
five sultans’ tombs. Each is decorated differently and there are wonderful 
examples of Iznik tiling. Beautiful, and free to enter too.

Join the locals and meander across the Galata Bridge at sunset, watching as 
fishermen jostle for space to dangle their lines into the water, while seagulls 
circle overhead against the silhouettes of the vivid minaret- and dome-filled 
skyline. Then try a fresh fish sandwich from one of the gaudy floating boat 
restaurants that bob in the water under the shadow of the mosque.

Mandabatmaz cafe, Beyoğlu

This delightful little coffee shop is tucked away down a small alleyway off 
Istiklâl Caddesi in the heart of Istanbul. It serves delicious Turkish coffee (
türk kahvesi) as you sit nestled in the tiny seating area, or perch on the wall 
outside and peek down the alley on to the bustling main street of Istiklâl.
