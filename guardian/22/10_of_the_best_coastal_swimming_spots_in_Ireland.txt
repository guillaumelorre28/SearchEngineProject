This time last year, I set off on a tour of the Irish coast for my book, At 
Swim: A Book about the Sea, which lists the best places to swim around the 
country, and explores Ireland’s sea swimming culture. I was joined by actor, 
comedian and fellow Dubliner Michael O’Reilly. We know our own city’s swim 
spots well. Dublin is surrounded by great places for a dip, from deep rocky 
dives by Georgian dwellings to further-flung cliffside beaches and pier walls. 
But we wanted get to know the rest of the Irish coast better, so put out a call 
to the country’s sea swimming community through radio and newspapers. Hundreds 
of local swimmers, expats and holidaymakers shared their favourite dips, and 
many had stories to tell, too. I contend that there are no “best” swimming 
spots. Each of the 50-odd swims in my book is somebody’s favourite – home of a 
childhood memory or a deep psychic connection. So instead I give you 10 “great’ 
Irish swims.

Dublin’s commuter trains run south to this famous swimming spot, below a 
Martello tower in which the opening chapter of Ulysses is set. Joyce himself 
lived here for just under a week before setting sail for the continent. This 
rocky outcrop sees hundreds of visitors daily, in good weather and bad, and 
thousands of swimmers on Christmas Day. If the going is rough, it’s only a 
20-metre walk to the more protected Sandycove beach. No excuses.
• Head down Marine Parade to Sandycove Avenue and James Joyce Tower.

The sunny south-east has a near mythic micro-climate: I can remember the 
distinct smell of porridge and jam wafting through our car window as we drove 
by strawberry farms. The peninsula of Hook Head fingers out into the sea. At 
the tip is 2km of black, rocky coast great for walking, coasteering or swimming 
(in places). The best of the geological features is Solomon’s Hole. Walking 
south from Slade harbour, keep your eyes peeled for a bridge of rock that 
overhangs a fairy pool. A deep crack in the coast, wide enough for two swimmers 
abreast, allows the pool to fill at higher tides for high jumps and sea 
lounging.
• Turn left at the mini-roundabout in Slade towards the harbour, and from 
there it’s a 300-metre walk south. Map

I regularly break my rule about “bests” for Derrynane, whose white-sand 
beaches in a natural bay enjoy further protection from black sandstone rock 
that heats in the sun and warms the calm, shallow waters. The western beach, 
with a tiny jetty from which children and toddlers leap, is completely 
protected – and was once a smuggler’s cove. A tiny peninsula divides it from 
the eastern beach, which houses an ancient abbey and graveyard, and did I 
mention there’s a pub? It’s known as Bridie’s.

These three natural swimming pools emerge from a rocky reef as the tide 
recedes. Bring a pair of goggles or a snorkel to explore the rich sea life in 
these deep pools that warm to up to 20C in summer – but be sure to arrive two 
hours either side of low tide. This was the childhood playground of actor 
Richard Harris, where he performed death-defying handstands and cycling tricks 
on the cliffside walls when not showboating by the sea.
• Follow the coast road west from Kilkee, heading for the Diamond Rock Cafe.

We had more emails about this swimming spot than any other. In particular, the 
residents of Miltown Malbay, a few miles inland, were keen to show us their 
childhood favourite. But decades of the raging Atlantic seas had washed away 
safe access to the natural pool at the base of the cliff. A handful of locals 
decided something must be done, and by July 2014 had raised money for a large 
engineering project. The new cliff access opened last summer. This is a local 
swimming spot with a warm welcome for visitors and also a traditional music 
session in the town every night of the week.

This seaside suburb has a holiday atmosphere thanks to the arcades and 
promenade that lead towards Blackrock, where a diving platform stretches out 
into the Atlantic. Designed by a local engineer, it was built by a local 
company, blessed by the local priest and opened in 1954 – to men only. The 
forthright Bishop Michael Browne of Galway was known to patrol the area, making 
sure men and women swam separately. Women didn’t join the men for a swim at 
Blackrock, or in many other parts of Ireland, until the 1970s. On the day we 
arrived, Mike Doyle, a Galway native, was executing fabulous dives from the top 
platform. His seven-year-old daughter was jumping from the top for the first 
time, too.

On our short ferry journey from Roonah Point on the mainland to this small 
inhabited island, we were joined by a pod of dolphins. The last leg of the 
journey is an unmarked track through boggy, picturesque landscape. But the 
deep, crystal blue waters made it well worth the journey. You’re likely to be 
the only soul swimming in this tiny cove, with staggering views back towards 
islet-pocked Clew Bay.

“We started swimming there in the mid-1960s,” wrote Eva Reilly. “The parish 
priest, Archdeacon Feeney, complained about us from the altar, but we were 
brazen and chose to ignore him. He was in his 70s then and used to swim there 
himself. We made life difficult for him.” Eva became the area’s first water 
safety officer in the 1980s. The town wanted an indoor pool, but the council 
coffers were empty. Instead, inspired by one local’s holiday to Sweden, an 
outdoor tidal pool was built: it’s an uncanny, modernist concrete block that 
sticks out from the coastline like a tongue.

Just north of Bundoran is a cliff walk to a pair of sea stacks. They lean out 
over a narrow, deep inlet, making perfect diving platforms. Generations of 
teenagers have gathered here in summer to test their nerve by jumping from 
ever-higher ledges. It’s also got one of the last remaining springboards in 
Ireland, most were pulled up by councils frightened of litigation. But here, 
the board appears to be safer than the sea stacks.

The last place on our coastal odyssey is known more for its history than its 
swimming heritage. A small pier sits directly below an 18th-century fort in 
Lough Swilly. It’s where the Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell fled in 1607, where 
the French fleet carrying the revolutionary Wolfe Tone was intercepted and 
defeated by the British in 1798, and was the largest home of the Royal Navy’s 
Grand Fleet in the first world war. But its swimming value is beyond doubt too. 
The pier is plenty deep for diving, with access to a narrow gully beneath the 
drawbridge and a pristine, horse-shoe beach on the opposite side of the fort.
• Head north from Buncrana on the R238. Turn left for Glebe and continue to 
Dunree. Map
