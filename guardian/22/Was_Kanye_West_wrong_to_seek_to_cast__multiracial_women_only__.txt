Kanye West <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest> has sent out a 
casting call for his forthcoming Yeezy Season 4 fashion show, which is set to 
be a centrepiece of New York fashion week. “Multiracial women only. No makeup 
please come as you are,” read the sheet, posted on Twitter. Accordingly, it 
caused controversy.

The replies attempted to read between the lines. “So no black women??”, “no 
white women either?”, was the tone of the dialogue. “It’s art. It’s a casting 
call. Absolutely allowed. That’s how casting works,” read one.

In Hollywood and on stage, the controversy surrounding certain casting 
decisions (such as that of Noma Dumezweni to play Hermione Granger in Harry 
Potter and the Cursed Child, for example) have only shown up the rigid 
attitudes that congregate around those worlds.

Fashion’s young attitude and the seasonal nature in which it operates means it 
is a quicker reflection of societal changes. Take, for example, the rise of the 
so-called Instagram “It girls”, such as the Hadid sisters andKendall Jenner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kendall-jenner>, as well as Vine star 
Cameron Dallas replacing Justin Bieber in the Calvin Klein ads. This has shone 
a light on the importance of an online personality bringing her or his personal 
brand and fan base to a fashion brand. The rise of transgender models like Hari 
Nef modelling for Gucci, and Andrej Pejic starring in adverts for Marc Jacobs 
and Gaultier, meanwhile, suggests both acceptance and an awareness of the 
column inches created by such casting.

The racially diverse runway, meanwhile, is currently a norm. Designers like 
Nasir Mazhar and Balmain’s Olivier Rousteing have pushed a diverse agenda on 
their runways, featuring models such as Damaris Goddrie or Leomie Anderson. In 
fact, it was jarring when the modernist quake caused by the Vetements show was 
tempered by the lack of diversity of the models, a thing that its creative 
director, Demna Gvasalia, seemed to be mindful of in his debut collection for 
Balenciaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2016/jun/22/ikea-chic-and-talking-heads-suits-balenciaga-gets-the-vetements-treatment>
. It is also speaks to an international economic reality. As Christopher 
Michael, executive agent at Society Management in New York, told Vogue: “Right 
now the No 1 driving force is diversity. Brands are looking to global culture.”

Surely the main point about West’s casting call to Yeezy hopefuls (a brand 
with an avant-garde take on athleisure and a haute price tag) was that it was 
an accurate extension of its brand: woke but also economically driven.
