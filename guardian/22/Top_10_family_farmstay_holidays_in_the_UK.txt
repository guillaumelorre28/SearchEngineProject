Trevorrick Farm, St Issey, Cornwall

Shetland ponies, kune-kune pigs and pygmy goats are among the sociable animals 
on this small farm near Padstow. Four of the seven cottages sleep four, and 
most have log-burners and gardens or patios. The indoor pool is open from 
Easter to October, the games room has table football, table tennis and air 
hockey, and there’s a trampoline, sandpit and play equipment outdoors. Tickets 
to nearby Crealy Adventure Park last seven days, and sandy beaches await on the 
Camel estuary.

Good bus links to Bath (five miles) and Bradford on Avon (two miles) make a 
car-free country holiday a realistic prospect here. There’s a pub in the 
village across the road and a well-stocked farm shop and cafe next door. When 
it’s not fine enough to explore foot and cycle paths – the Kennet and Avon 
canal is less than a mile away – there’s a shared heated pool and a games room. 
Four of the seven cottages (in converted cow byres) sleep four; a stylish 
open-plan granary conversion sleeps 12. There’s also a glampsite with four 
canvas bell tents.

Whether they’re in the milking parlour or on the trampolines, it’s hard to 
imagine kids getting bored on this organic dairy farm. As well as an indoor 
pool, games room, soft-play area, tennis court, football pitch and adventure 
playground, there are pigs, goats and hens to feed and miles of the unspoilt 
Llyn peninsula to explore. Nearby attractions include Criccieth Castle and 
Porthmadog, for the Ffestiniog or Welsh Highland railway to the foothills of 
Snowdon. Thirteen cottages sleep between two and eight.

Toddlers and pre-schoolers are well- looked-after here: there’s a walk-in 
rabbit and guinea-pig enclosure, a “racetrack” with ride-on toys, and a play 
barn with ball pool for under-fives. Parents and older siblings won’t feel too 
hard done by, with a tennis court, games room and swimming pool with picture 
windows and outdoor decking overlooking miles of south Devon countryside. The 
village of Rattery, with its 11th-century pub, is a 15-minute ramble away. Five 
cottages sleep between three and eight.

These six small, simple two- and three-bedroom cottages are converted from 
cattle sheds and farm buildings. Geared towards families with young children 
(for whom climbing a ladder to a loft bedroom is an adventure in itself), 
they’re on a family-run estate where guests can wander 14 acres of woodland, 
meet farm animals and play on trampolines, scooters, slides, sandpit and a 
football pitch. The small indoor pool is bookable at £5 a hour.

The Reade family have been making cheese from their own cows’ milk since 1982. 
They built a new dairy in 2000 and converted the old buildings into four 
holiday cottages. Sleeping from two (plus cot) to six, they have wood-burning 
stoves, and the pool and sauna are powered by a water turbine and log-fired 
boiler. Food lovers can watch udder-to-vat cheesemaking, and kids can have a go 
at milking.

From a small apartment to a four-bedroom barn conversion, there’s a property 
here to suit most families and budgets. Surrounded by craggy Pennines, this 
farm in the Holme valley welcomes small hands to help collect free-range eggs 
and (in spring) bottle-feed lambs. If the nearby Pennine Way, Kirklees Way and 
summit of Cheesegate Nab don’t tempt, Holmfirth, where Last of the Summer Wine 
was filmed, is nearby. Six cottages/apartments and two yurts share a pool, 
steam room, sauna, playground and games room.
