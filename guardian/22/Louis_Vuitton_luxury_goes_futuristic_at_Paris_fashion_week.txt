The Place Vendôme, like Louis Vuitton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton>, is a monumental triumph of 
French luxury branding. The grandest square in Paris – which is not square but 
octagonal, faceted like a diamond so the rows of tall symmetrical windows 
reflect the maximum amount of sunlight – is an illusion. The Place Vendôme is a 
facade, a 300-year-old shopfront, behind which the owner of each plot is free 
to rebuild at will, so long as what the well-heeled shoppers on the pavement 
see is unaffected.

Louis Vuitton, the new owners of a large plot in the south-east corner, 
operates in a similar way. The name above the door remains paramount, whoever 
is working behind the scenes. Whether they are buying a bag designed byNicolas 
Ghesquière <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/nicolas-ghesquiere>, as now, or 
one created by Marc Jacobs five years ago, the customer is paying for a Louis 
Vuitton bag.

Moving his catwalk show from the Fondation Louis Vuitton art gallery, where it 
has been staged for the past two years, to the concrete shell that will become 
the brand’s Place Vendôme flagship store in 2017, Ghesquière seemed to shift 
his focus from fashion as art to fashion as commerce – or at least, a blend of 
the two.

“People expect sportswear from Vuitton now,” he said backstage, alluding to 
his leaning toward futuristic, technical fashion. “But they also want high 
luxury from Vuitton, always. So I was thinking, how can I fuse those?”


The night before his show, Ghesquière Instagrammed a photo of himself using an 
iPhone 6 case modelled on the current Vuitton “it” bag, the Petite Malle, which 
is a miniature version of the famous brown and gold travel trunks. The same 
phone cases appeared on the runway, carried by models wearing fluid, lean 
dresses, vaguely sporty in silhouette but in exquisite fabrics.

“I was thinking about the Place Vendôme, and what Parisian sophistication 
means today. About that woman who is dressed up and embellished, and just 
carrying her phone,” he said. The phone case as an alternative to the handbag 
is a strikingly modern image – and a lucrative line to add to the shop floor.

There was a direct connection between the clothes on the Vuitton catwalk and 
what chic women wear now, and the instant desire it generated in the audience 
was palpable. The collection, the last major show ofParis fashion week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/paris-fashion-week>, was one of the best 
of the week.

There were long skirts gathered at the hip for elegance and ease of movement, 
and slim trousers worn with boots. Traditional tropes of Parisian dress-up were 
modernised: Swiss dot lace remade in metallic beads, for instance. Last 
season’s chunky, heeled hiking boots – a front-row stalwart at thisParis 
fashion week <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/paris-fashion-week> – have 
evolved into a elegant take on the cowboy boot.

There were party clothes – electric-blue caviar lace was a standout – and 
tailored suits. “I was thinking about women who get dressed up not just to go 
out, but for how they look at work. It’s funny how men have never let go of the 
suit,” said Ghesquière.
