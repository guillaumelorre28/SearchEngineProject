Australia may have famously ridden to prosperity on the sheep’s back, with 
bush ballads like Click Go the Shears forming part of our national heritage.

But when Julie Cameron and her husband Sandy left their city science careers 
to come back home to the land as merino farmers they were soon facing disaster.

Their dream of returning to the sort of rural life and natural beauty they had 
both grown up with in farming families was under serious threat after the 
reserve wool price was discontinued in the early 1990s, precipitating an 
industry collapse.

“It literally dissolved our income,” Julie Cameron recalls today. “There were 
record numbers of sheep in Australia at that time, so sheep became absolutely 
worthless, and prime lamb prices dived because of the supply.”

The young couple had a stark choice for their farm at Meredith in rural 
Victoria: innovate or perish.

“Desperate times called for desperate measures,” Cameron says. “We wanted to 
be farmers and we owned this asset and we needed to produce something off it 
that would give us a sustainable income.”


As they looked around for alternatives to wool, salvation came after 
discovering that the French blue cheese Roquefort – often cited as the best in 
the world - was made using sheep’s milk.

Against the odds, the Camerons turned to their backgrounds in science to make 
it happen - milking their sheep instead of shearing them, while experimenting 
to make a viable local product themselves.

For those first few years of Meredith Dairy, Sandy, a veterinary science 
researcher, tended to the flock by day, while Julie, a nurse trained in 
microbiology, made the cheese at night with no time off.

“We were really struggling but we had cash flow,” she says. “We found we could 
reinvent ourselves. We weren’t relying on that one wool cheque a year. We were 
doing things that were really out there and a bit different and that’s why the 
brand became very valued.”

Twenty-five years on, the vertically integrated Meredith Dairy has a $15m 
annual turnover, with around 100 staff making and selling an extensive range of 
fresh sheep and goat’s milk products both here and overseas.

While overseeing such phenomenal growth, core to Cameron’s philosophy has been 
the “triple bottom line” of creating a business that is sustainable 
environmentally and socially as well as financially.

“It was why we came home from the city in the first place,” she says. “We are 
doing it because we want to be farmers and we want to make the world a better 
place. We don’t want to leave a bad footprint in the environment.”

Meredith Dairy includes pristine areas of the original Victorian volcanic 
grasslands that have been largely degraded elsewhere by European settlement and 
agricultural techniques. Cameron says she has been passionate about 
biodiversity from a young age and is proud to have set aside 20% of their 4000 
acres for direct conservation.

She also sees water conservation as a necessity because of climate change, and 
the farm employs a number of innovative methods to achieve this. As well as 
recycling rinse water and the runoff from shed roofs, the dairy operations are 
built on a steep slope to enable a “dry sweep system” that is used while 
milking their flock of 4000 sheep and 9000 goats.

The animals stand on a platform almost 4m off the ground with a grating for 
waste products, like manure, to fall or be swept through. Instead of having to 
hose out a traditional concrete milking platform, the waste can accumulate 
below until it is hauled away using a bobcat.

To help their sustainability efforts, the farmers have taken out an 
environmental loan through the National Australia Bank, allowing them to put in 
solar panels and a solid fuel boiler, which uses waste timber instead of 
non-renewable LPG.

Meredith Dairy is one of more than 300 agribusinesses to take up this Clean 
Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) equipment finance with NAB - an initiative 
aimed at letting irrigators, horticulturalists, dairies and other farms with 
high energy costs reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy 
efficiencies.

Through the scheme, NAB offers a 0.7% p.a. discount on the equipment finance 
rate for qualifying assets that reduce energy consumption or are renewable. The 
discount is for the life of the financing and the repayment schedule is aimed 
at fitting individual cash flow and circumstances. There is usually no deposit 
needed, with the security being the equipment itself, so capital can stay 
within the business.

We were doing things that were really out there and a bit different and that’s 
why the brand became very valued.

$70 million of discounted equipment finance has been provided so far, with 
products funded including solar pumps, PV solar, irrigation systems, and new 
state of the art vehicles.

The CEFC invests commercially to increase the flow of funds into renewable 
energy, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies. It supports a diverse 
range of large and small businesses across the Australian economy.

For Cameron, the benefits of loan have been improved efficiencies while 
helping to reduce their carbon footprint, including being “off the grid for a 
while”.

“The number one priority is looking after the environment and to look after 
our social environment – the community – because we need them to support us,” 
Cameron says.

“I think people who live in the country are more attentive to their natural 
environment. I see native wildlife coming back in the district around us and 
that’s because there are farmers like us who are seeing the benefits of 
restoring degraded areas.”

NAB is to date the only Australian bank to sign the Natural Capital 
Declaration of December 2011, a global statement which recognises that natural 
capital poses significant potential risks and opportunities to the finance 
sector.

The bank is working with agribusinesses like Meredith Dairy as part of an 
integration of natural capital considerations into its day-to-day decision 
making processes and risk assessments.
