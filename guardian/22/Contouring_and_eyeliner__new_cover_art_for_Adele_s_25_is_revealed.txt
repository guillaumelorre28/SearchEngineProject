For the cover of her new album, 25, out on 20 November, Adele has done a 
complete u-turn and gone for a black-and-white close-crop shot (see21 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(Adele_album)>) that focuses on her face (see 
19 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jan/25/popandrock.shopping6>). An 
early adopter of the failproof feline flick and contouring combination (see 19 
and 21), both are back although – wait – her hair looks a little shorter. 
According to Man About Town magazine, it was shot by Alasdair McLellan. Given 
her decision to stay firmly out of the spotlight, she’s a sight for sore eyes 
so we’ll take what we can get.
