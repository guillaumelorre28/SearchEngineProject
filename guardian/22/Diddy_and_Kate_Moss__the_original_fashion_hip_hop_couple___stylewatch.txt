before releasing the cover: a shot of himself withKate Moss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss> from 1999.

Vogue in October 1999 in a feature called Puff Takes Paris, in which Puff did 
indeed take Paris, alongside Jean Paul Gaultier, Karl Lagerfeld, Oscar de la 
Renta, Alek Wek and John Galliano.

editorial at a time when hip-hop was only beginning to move from subculture to 
a mainstream fashion reference point.


Diddy describes MMM as a “sonic motion picture”. We call it a 
“self-mythologising ode to his wealth, success and empire”, but, to be fair, he
