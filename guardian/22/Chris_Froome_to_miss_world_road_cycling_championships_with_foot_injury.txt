The 30-year-old, who rides for Team Sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky>, would have been one of the 
favourites for the title in Virginia when the championships begin on 19 
September. He abandoned the tour after crashing on stage 11 and breaking a bone 
in his foot.

“It looks unlikely, the fracture will take a while to heal,” Team Sky’s Dave 
Brailsford <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dave-brailsford> was quoted as 
saying on the BBC. Froome was on a provisional list of riders to take part in 
the road race and the time trial.
