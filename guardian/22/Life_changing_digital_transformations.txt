Our culture holds inventors in special regard but the halo we give to those 
who create life-changing inventions can sometimes obscure the fact that the act 
of invention itself is only the first step to changing the world, not the last.

For any technology to be truly transformative, it will need help along the way 
to reach the world. WiFi, for instance, which allows different devices to 
communicate seamlessly across wireless networks, has, to many, become as 
mandatory an amenity as hot water in just a few short years, and transformed 
our expectations around mobile communication. Wifi networks are now seemingly 
in every home and business, not to mention increasing numbers of planes and 
trains and everywhere in between.

But Wifi has its origins in the stars. Key facets of the technology stem from 
CSIRO research into radio astronomy in the 1980s – specifically, efforts to 
detect miniature exploding black holes.

But it wasn’t until the 1990s that same batch of CSIRO scientists hatched a 
plan to use elements of that research to dramatically boost the speed of 
wireless information networks that the technology we now depend upon so heavily 
began to emerge. But even then, the present ubiquity of Wifi did not spring 
magically from those days but is instead the result of efforts by many to bring 
it to market and make it easy for customers to use and depend upon.

The most transformative technologies have been backed up by innovative ways of 
getting those technologies to users.

A prime example is the cochlear implant that has allowed well over 300,000 
people to hear, ever since Australian Rod Saunders became the world’s first 
recipient of a bionic ear in 1978.

In the decades since then, Cochlear has worked ceaselessly to bring more 
people into the world of sound, but its innovation is not restricted to the 
implant and surgery themselves.

Based in Sydney, Cochlear set out to build and maintain lifetime relationships 
with the people across the globe who use its implants, matching the reality of 
local healthcare with the needs and aspirations of a global customer base.

For Global Head of Marketing Technology Vishy Narayanan, that means connecting 
potential implant recipients to a community.

“Today, decisions around medical devices like these aren’t left to the 
surgeons alone,” he said. “Patients have a say, too. And they want to go out 
and research, talk to people who have had similar procedures.”

To that end, Cochlear has built a 3000-strong volunteer community of implant 
recipients, who are willing to share their experiences in the decision-making 
phase. And it’s why Cochlear specifically aims to recruit people with Cochlear 
implants and audiology backgrounds, giving them a much deeper ability to 
identify with people’s experiences.

alone. Patients have a say, too.

“There’s a deep understanding of device owners bring in varying stages of 
adapting to their new lives,” Cochlear recipient and employee Kate Obermeyer 
said. “If you are a new recipient [for example], still learning to 
differentiate sounds, voice calls are not necessarily your first choice,” which 
is why Cochlear also offers live text chat.

In the business world, it doesn’t matter how attractive your product is if the 
process for your customers to get their hands on it is too frustrating or 
burdensome. This is where innovative digital techniques can make all the 
difference.

Salesforce APAC Vice President Robert Wickham said this is where the rapidly 
increasing sophistication and ability of digital technology can make all the 
difference.

“We’ve seen an acceleration of technology’s transforming ability, and its 
ability to innovate at pace,” he said.

“We’re seeing that brought into the market in many different ways. For 
instance, cloud computing has been extraordinarily disruptive.

“It has changed the fundamental requirements that companies need to operate. 
It has greatly increased the pace at which companies can change their 
operations, and cut the resources and costs of doing so.”

Wickham said the companies that are set to thrive in the new digital world are 
not just those with the most transformative products, but those that harness 
digital technology to better connect with users or customers.

This is precisely what La Trobe University’s Olga Tennison Autism Research 
Centre (OTARC) did. For 10 years, the centre has been training nurses to 
observe the early behavioural signs for autism in infants.

OTARC Director Professor Cheryl Dissanakaye said this was critical work, as 
early detection can change lives.

“If we detect autism early, we can then begin to assist that young person to 
learn and that has knock-on effects for the quality of that person’s life later 
on,” she said.

By monitoring more than 30,000 babies, OTARC has been able to identify early 
signs of autism with a world-leading accuracy rate of 81%, offering a vital 
tool in an arena where early detection and intervention can have an enormous 
impact on quality of life.

What began as a simple set of questions for nurses has now evolved into 
powerful algorithm, harnessing the data recorded from children observed to help 
a new generation.

Although the participating nurses were initially simply recording their 
observations with a pen and paper, OTARC soon created an app for nurses to use, 
to make the process more efficient. And when that app proved successful, OTARC 
asked itself how they could make early detection available to families 
everywhere.

Soon, ASDetect was born, taking the potentially life-altering technology out 
of the hands of the few and dispersing it to the masses. The app contains a 
number of questions for parents about their infant children, along with videos 
demonstrating typical and atypical behaviours for their age. Results are sent 
straight to OTARC for automatic analysis.

In order to ensure ASDetect can help families as efficiently as possible, 
OTARC has also created an automated system to guide parents who have completed 
the assessment to the most appropriate next step.

For example, if a child is identified at being at-risk, an email is triggered 
to explain what the assessment means, and what the options are for parents.

The same system also allows OTARC to maintain close, personal communication 
with hundreds of families at once, ensuring each receives the personal care 
needed.

The old adage that invention is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration is no 
doubt apt, but the sweating doesn’t stop once invention is complete. No 
invention can change the world without users and customers, and delivering it 
to them can often involve just as much innovation as the invention itself.
