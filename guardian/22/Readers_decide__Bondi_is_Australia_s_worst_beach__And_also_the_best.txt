It was the best of beaches, it was the worst of beaches.

Bondi, that is. 

When we asked, you answered quite clearly that Bondi was Australia’s worst 
beach. And also the best.

Open thread: what is Australia's worst beach?

jeromeknewton <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4309453> said it was 
“no competition” for the worst beach. It is “Bondi.”

Ulrike Zachmann <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13574062> also has it 
in for Bondi:

Bondi beach at Christmas and New Year is the worst beach. Back Packer drunken 
yob parties. Yuck! Haven’t been there for years. You cannot go for a swim 
without having your stuff pinched. Popularity ruins places. Give me St Kilda 
any day.

Aaron B Lingwood <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14539775> agreed:

Bondi is one of the worst beaches I have seen. No trees; very little wildlife; 
monoculture; over-priced parking; almost all sports and activities banned; 
crowded; no beach kiosk; and on a nice Sunday can take a few hours to get there 
due to the bumper-to-bumper traffic on the poorly planned arterials.

Luckily utterflanker  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10970745>was on 
hand to reassure the Bondi haters that they are just “doing it wrong”:

Early morning coffee on the beach, especially on a crisp winter’s day, then 
onto the bus and off to work.

No crowds. No stress. It’s all good.

Brisbane’s South Bank seemed to get a fair few nominations, as did Canberra’s 
Lake Burley Griffin. They’re not coastal beaches, so it might seem unfair. But 
then again, neither is Wagga and there was no shortage of love for that.

In fact, only one thing was for sure in our call out for Australia’s worst 
beach: that is definitivelynot Wagga Wagga. In fact, the reverie inspired in 
the comments for this riverside park could soon have it turned into a tourist 
attraction.

... Melbourne and Wagga ...

Poor old Wagga Beach! Gone are the halcyon days of summer in the early 70s 
where the Wagga Beach was the place for all the cool teens to hang out. Working 
on our tans and watching the boys somersault off the cliffs to show off their 
prowess to the bikini clad girls. Good times!

Wagga has a great beach, with a daily 5 o’clock wave in the arvo as a result 
of spills from dams upstream. Trust me: when you’ve sweated through day after 
day of 40+ temps in classrooms with no air con, you head straight for the beach 
(the local pool now shuts way too early and the hottest part of the day is 
around 7pm). Walk 800m upstream, enter via a rock ledge and float all the way 
down. Just so cooling and refreshing. Or swim to the other side and jump off 
the cliffs. Then fight the current to just make it back to the beach - 
otherwise you’re floating all the way to Wiradjuri Reserve before you can exit. 
And don’t forget the world-famous Gumi Races of the 1970s and 1980s. It’s 
better than Bondi.

The 5 o’clock wave is fantastic, reckless to let everybody in on the secret.

Agree. After many a hot trip between Adelaide and Sydney would stay at Wagga 
and take the kids down to the beach. Brilliant.

The good thing on a stinkin’ hot Riverina day is that the water is nice and 
cool, as it comes out the bottom of the dams. Not great for river ecology, but 
great for cooling off.

Ah, the Gumi races....the best way to enjoy taking part was being already 
pissed and carrying extra refreshments :)

Wagga is my favourite beach

Ha ha, being from Wagga Wagga, I do take slight umbrage at the comparison of 
our beautiful coastal beaches set beside a photo of the flooded Murrumbidgee 
river! Wagga beach, whilst not having the kudos of its coastal cousins, has 
come a long way in recent times and our Council is to be commended for their 
work creating a riparian vista of considerable bucolic charm!!

I was on the front page of the Daily Advertiser some time in the 60s at Wagga 
beach having a bucket of water tipped on my head by my big sisters. It seemed 
like the best of all beaches back them, however my world view changed on a 
family holiday a few months or years latter as we crested a hill somewhere on 
the South Coast of NSW and the Pacific Ocean revealed the true meaning of beach.

bewalls <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16906294> also had some fond 
memories of Wagga:

Wagga once had a lovely beach, nice sand and a pleasant place to swim in the 
blistering hot summers. The swift current was a bit treacherous. But after 
Blowering dam went it was mostly too cold in the water. Bevan

And Nettythe1st <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12040727> said:

have very fond memories of Wagga Beach in the early 70s. Floating down the 
river in a tube was a great way to while away a hot lazy summer afternoon.

If you’re confused about how to judge, one reader has the answer:


Paul E Bonnett <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13403855>:

There should be a criteria:
The enjoyment of a beach becomes disproportionately worse the larger the 
crowds - nominate Bondi then.
The long long beach that disappears into the distance as opposed to the small 
crescent type of Coogee. I don’t much like long long beaches. Give me Coogee 
any day.
The safety of lifeguards or the privacy of no protection?
The privacy to strip naked and dive in anytime without gawkers?
Fresh water versus salt water. No competition in my opinion. Salt water 
swimming every time.
Cold water versus warm?
The facilities around? Is there a decent fish and chip or hamburger joint - or 
is a decent cafe or vegan burger your thing?
Favourite Sydney beach is Coogee. Any south coast NSW beach would do me.
Got to say the comments throughout have made me laugh lots.
Worst beach for me would be Bondi, St Kilda or Wagga.

So there you have it. Australia’s worst beach might very well be Bondi but it 
is definitely not Wagga Wagga.
