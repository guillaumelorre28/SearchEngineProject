I know so many people who, when they get ready for an event, spend two days 
working with their stylist, calling in outfits and having their hair, makeup 
and everything else done. That makes me laugh. I go the opposite way. The last 
event I went to, I had 25 minutes to get ready before I was out of the door.

I don’t do a lot of grooming, though I have to use hair products. I’ve got 
very thick curly hair and without them I end up looking like an extra fromthe

. I just had my hair cut off because I was getting fed up with the amount of 
time it was taking.

I am learning more from being in this industry and working with makeup 
artists. I get very dry skin from travelling, so they tell me to use vitamin C 
creams and serums. I think it is becoming more acceptable for men to be into 
moisturising.

These days there are all sorts of dress codes, such as “London chic” or 
“evening chic”, but I usually just stick to what I know and what I am 
comfortable in, which is a suit. When I first started going to parties in 
three-piece suits about eight years ago, people thought, “Who is this guy in 
the three-piece suit?” But now it is a normal occurrence, as the suit and 
tailoring have made a huge comeback.

You never want to be at a party underdressed, so I always tend to overdress. 
Some people think it is cool to turn up to a big event in a T-shirt but I think 
that is a little disrespectful. If you have been invited somewhere, it is 
polite to dress well. It will also give you confidence.
