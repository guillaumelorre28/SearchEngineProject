The singer-songwriter Shane Howard sees the irony in receiving an Australia Day
 <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-day> honour for a song 
about the genocide of Indigenous inhabitants upon white settlement.

Howard wrote the 1982 hit single Solid Rock for his band, Goanna, about the 
settlement of Australia.

Its powerful lyrics include: “Wasn’t long before they felt the sting, white 
man, white law, white gun / Don’t tell me that it’s justified, ’cause 
somewhere, someone lied / Yeah, well someone lied, someone lied, genocide”.

It was off the successful debut album, Spirit of Place, and was the first 
commercial song to use a didgeridoo.

Howard said being recognised for his work, not only for the iconic song but 
also for his work alongside other Indigenous artists, was a “two-edged sword 
for a number of reasons”.


“Australia Day is a complicated day and as a nation we have to deal with that, 
and it’s become a symbol of division and not unity,” he said.


“It’s lovely and ironic in a way that you are recognised for a song that 
criticises government policy.”


Howard has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his 
service to the performing arts as a singer, songwriter and guitarist, to the 
recording industry, and to Indigenous musicians.


He has worked on more than a dozen albums with Indigenous artists including 
Archie Roach, the Pigram Brothers, Joe Geia, Jimmy Chi and Patricia Clarke.


Howard said he would not only accept the honour with pleasure, but would 
celebrate a little more than most recipients because it was also his birthday.


“How can I not be interested in the settlement of Australia and the 
complications for Aboriginal people, when it’s your birthday?” he said.

“This award is not about this particular day.


“I am grateful and very honoured for my work. I still love playing that song. 
It means a lot.”
