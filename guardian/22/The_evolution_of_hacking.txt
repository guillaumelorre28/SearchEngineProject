Indiscriminate Attacks 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2016/nov/intel-the-evolution-of-hacking/gifs.html?01>
Like a toddler that gets stuck into the lolly stash just before bedtime, there 
is no specific target for an indiscriminate hack - just total annihilation of 
anything that happens to be in its way. Their reach can be far and wide and 
does not distinguish between organisations and individuals.

In 2012, the Red October malware attacked hundreds of computer networks, 
affecting diplomatic, government and scientific research organisations all 
around the world. Thousands of emails were sent containing documents that 
exploited vulnerabilities in everyday programs such as Word and Excel.

Government Espionage

As the name suggests, government espionage is when government organisations 
are the targets of online hacking.These hacks can be used to steal secret 
documents, expose sensitive information, or even to access computer-controlled 
weapons managed by government bodies.

In 2007, a malicious computer worm dubbed Stuxnet was considered to be the 
world’s first digital weapon. Rather than using the hack to simply steal 
information, the attack moved beyond the digital realm and wreaked physical 
destruction on the equipment that the computers controlled.

Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, affecting their operating speed 
and destroying the machines. The hack was disguised to appear as a series of 
unfortunate accidents.

Corporate Espionage

It may sound like it’s from a James Bond flick, but corporate espionage is 
when hackers steal data from corporate and industrial companies, usually with a 
commercial agenda. It often takes place when one company hacks into their 
competition to gain an advantage.

Google was the victim one of these corporate attacks in 2010. Operators in 
China hacked into the Google China headquarters and stole intellectual 
property, including the email accounts of human rights activists.

It’s believed to have been part of a widespread cyber attack across a number 
of Chinese companies known as Operation Aurora.

Integrity Attack
Integrity Attack

Stealthy, selective and devastating: integrity attacks shy away from trying to 
obtain vast amounts of sensitive data and instead focus on carefully changing 
particular elements within transactions, communications, or data to gain a 
significant benefit.

This can include changing the direct deposit settings for a victim’s 
paycheques to have money redirected and deposited into a different account. 
It’s a small hack with a big impact.

Gauss malware was developed in 2011 to stealthily target specific devices and 
make minor configuration changes that resulted in a major impact to a national 
nuclear program.

In 2015, hackers used this same method to attack a number of banks, providing 
hackers with an understanding of the workings of internal finance operations.

Stolen Credentials

The more we try to protect ourselves from cyber attacks, the more hackers find 
ways around the new technologies we create to block them.

With the rise of security components; firewalls, gateways and end-point 
security products, hackers now source authentic credentials to hack into online 
platforms. They can be bought on the dark market, or ‘harvested’ via phishing 
emails or other vulnerabilities.

Online cloud storage platform Dropbox reported a massive breach after hackers 
obtained over 68 million account credentials in 2012.

Stolen Funds
Stolen Funds

Given that the majority of our monetary transactions are now via our credit or 
debit cards, there’s understandably a large amount of security surrounding 
these products to help prevent cybercriminals stealing funds.

But with the growth in alternate payment methods, such as digital currency 
Bitcoin, cyber thieves now have many more targets to choose from, meaning the 
number of attacks have multiplied, and continue to grow.

Russian hackers stole up to $1 billion between 2013 and 2015. The group first 
infected a bank computer with malware that gave the hackers remote access to 
the computer. Once they had learned how the bank’s computing system worked, 
they were able to mimic staff activity in order to transfer money out.

Ransomware
Ransomware 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2016/nov/intel-the-evolution-of-hacking/gifs.html?07>
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that is designed to block a user’s 
access to their computer system and then - you guessed it - hold it for ransom.

Users who have been hacked using ransomware have to pay a sum of money to 
regain access to their system. An example of this is
CryptoLocker, a type of ransomware which extorts money from users that 
procured at least $3 million in 2013 before it was shut down in 2014.

CryptoLocker hijacked documents before asking for a sum of money to be paid in 
order to release them. Emails were often sent with a password-protected zip 
file claiming to be from a company that the user might be familiar with, such 
as a bank or telecommunications company.

Hacktivism
Hacktivism 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2016/nov/intel-the-evolution-of-hacking/gifs.html?08>
Cyber attacks that fall under the umbrella of Hacktivism are driven by a 
strong political agenda or social point that hackers want to make public.

Skilled hacktivist groups will attack a well-known entity and use their 
platform to make their point. It’s shifting activism from rallies and protests 
that traditionally take place in the street to the online space.

Anonymous became the first poster child for hacktivism in 2008 after they 
launched a series of attacks against the Church of Scientology. They organised 
a raid, prank-called their phone line and launched a DDoS attack on the 
church’s websites.

They have become famous for well-publicized cyber attacks on government, 
religious and corporate organisations.

Stolen Personal Data
Stolen Personal Data 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2016/nov/intel-the-evolution-of-hacking/gifs.html?09>
Our personal data is valuable - especially to companies that want to sell us 
their products. And it’s not just our names and emails anymore - our purchasing 
history, what we eat, what we watch, our weight, our blood pressure and much 
more can be collected by hackers and sold on at a tidy profit.

Hackers can even use this data to figure out what purchases they could make 
with stolen credit card info without triggering an alert.

Medical data is highly sought after by cyber criminals - it’s even more 
valuable than our credit card details. In 2014, Chinese hackers broke onto the 
system of one of the largest US hospitals, Community Health Systems Inc., and 
stole the personal information of 4.5 million patients. They then sold those 
large batches of data for massive profits.

Cloud Hacking

Whether you are using video conferencing or voice mail, project management 
tools, data storage sites, or cloud-hosted applications, companies are at risk 
when they access and store their company data on third-party sites. Unless the 
third party site offers proper oversight on security management, they can 
create the perfect environment for cloud hacking.

Ashley Madison came under the spotlight when hackers stole all of their 
customer data from their dating site, an anonymous service that encouraged 
marital affairs and infidelity.

Data stolen included emails, home addresses, credit cards and sexual 
fantasies. The hackers threatened to expose all of the data publicly if the 
website wasn’t taken down.

Payment System Hacks 
Payment System Hacks

Most payment system attacks approach card theft in the same way they have for 
the past 10 years: by attacking payment mechanisms or the databases that 
contain the card data, and then selling it as quickly as possible to pocket the 
profit.

Software giant Oracle was the target of hackers early in 2016. Hundreds of 
computers at their point-of-sale division were infected with malicious code, 
which infiltrated the support portal used by their customers and potentially 
hacked into sales registers all over the world.

Car Hacking

As car manufacturing continues to advance - and different types of software 
are used in car design - the risk of cars being hacked continues to increase.

In 2016, 12% of our cars are connected to the internet in some way.
In August, several security researchers demonstrated that was possible to hack 
different types of connected cars, including a Jeep Cherokee, by sending 
commands through the Jeep’s entertainment system to its dashboards functions, 
steering, brakes, and transmission, all from a remote laptop.

Wearable Hacks 
Wearable Hacks

Although breaking into a wearable device does not necessarily provide 
immediate value for a hacker, the real value lies in the wearable device’s 
connection to a person’s personal smartphone or tablet.

Most wearables collect a lot of data, and then feed it to an application on a 
smartphone or tablet for processing. Most of these devices use Bluetooth LE 
(low energy) technology, which has suffered a number of very well documented 
security flaws. The vulnerability of Bluetooth is becoming more well known, and 
will possibly become worse as new versions of applications are rolled out.

Physical Hacks

Physical access also opens up a variety of new avenues for hacking.

In 2015 there was an increase in the area of hardware and hardware-centric 
attacks. Many new academic and proof-of-concept reports concerning hardware 
attacks were published, and the security industry discovered multiple, 
in-the-wild hardware-based attacks.

The side effect of DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) is that the memory may 
get corrupted by simply reading the ‘bits’ in a different part of the chip.

This corruption has been given the name Rowhammer because repeated accesses to 
a single one of the DRAM’s internal ‘rows’ of bits can bleed charge off the 
adjacent rows, causing bits to ‘flip’.

These repeated accesses are referred to as ‘hammering’. Memory cells then leak 
their charges and interact electrically between themselves, causing corruption 
of data.

As long as we keep valuable data in the digital space, so too will there be 
cyber criminals. And even with increasing security, cybercrime will continue to 
thrive into the future.

Like any business, most cyber criminal operations follow the money, looking 
for the easiest way for them to steal something of value. The growing worth of 
personal data will play a big part - already more sought after than payment 
card information, it will continue to climb in value as a commodity that can be 
traded on the black market.

Still, to counter this increase in cyber attacks, we continue to see ongoing 
advances and improvements in antivirus software. Education, both personal and 
organisational, will also play an important role in ensuring our future safety 
online.
