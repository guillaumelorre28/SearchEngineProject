And finally, Kate Middleton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/duchess-of-cambridge> went off-the-shoulder. On 
home turf, at the Natural History Museum, the royal wore an expensive (over 
£1500) Barbara Casasola dress to present an art prize. It was a difficult 
dress, being cream, panelled and jersey, but also arguably her best look of the 
summer, if not year – not least because the dress tapped into summer 2016’s 
biggest trend confirming just how mass, mainstream and everywoman the 
off-the-shoulder look had become. It was also a royal first (or at least the 
last time a royal had shown both arms since Diana).

So what makes someone like Kate want to wear an off-the shoulder dress? 
Several reasons: on paper, bare shoulders speak of summer, now but also then, 
the 1960s, or 1970s if you’re looking atChloé <https://www.chloe.com/gb>, hence 
the “Bardot” moniker; retro is always engaging in a fashion sense. They’re also 
a great top for tanning, not looking too naked and for showing your arms 
without showing your arms. But they’re also wholly impractical and that’s part 
of the appeal.

Look at Middleton, and the way she stands: hands in front, clutching a clutch, 
and doing little more. Because you can’t do much in them. You can’t lift your 
arm, you can’t carry your shopping and even if you do, over your shoulder, you 
can’t because you’ll mark your shoulder. The top has become code for the way in 
which you live your life: tan first, work second. Just like you can’t run in 
clogs or go bare-legged without a hefty taxi bill, you can’t really wear a bra 
with them, either, taking them to the far end of the humblebrag spectrum.

Perhaps this is why they’ve bedded in so nicely. Off-the-shoulder tops should 
have been one of those ephemeral items, an idea, a flight, but they’ve become a 
summer diktat and in shops, for every vest or tee, there’s a variation without 
shoulders. Such is the breadth of this look that there are even subsets within 
the Bardot family: semi-Bardots (cut out shoulders, a no-no), strapped-Bardots 
(practical, with excellent selections atTopshop

 Topshop Boutique’s Off the Shoulder top. 
Being on-trend (or engaged) are often happy accidents for us, but for Kate, 
the stakes are high. She has always gone for safety and modesty over anything 
on trend (she sticks to the five finger rule of designers:Emilia Wickstead 
<http://emiliawickstead.com/welcome> and Topshop, and a few labels in between) 
at most wearing yellow (very spring/summer 2016). Going shoulderless has taken 
things to the next level.
