1 Gucci: because this is the show defining what we really wear 


No, I’m not winding you up. And, yes, I’m talking about that Gucci show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/21/gucci-milan-fashion-week-frenzied-like-an-explosion-inside-a-fairytale>
, the one with the orange fur coat with the zebras and the red leather jacket 
with the pussybow collar.Gucci <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> has 
changed how we dress. I’ve been watching the off-catwalk fashion – not so much 
the peacocky Anna Dello Russo stuff as what the fashion footsoldiers wear, 
which is much more telling – and a key look right now is a midi-length, loose, 
floral or colourful dress worn with comfortable shoes (trainers, chunky 
loafers, flatforms).

This look – the fancy-but-not-cocktailish dress worn with practical shoes – is 
what Gucci looks like when you pare down the pearl trims, the bows, the sparkly 
sunglasses. Dakota Johnson, Gucci’s poster girl, nailed the look in the front 
row: long tea dress, chunky loafers, denim jacket. Alessandro Michele is 
winning atGucci <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> because he is 
affecting not just the brand’s bottom line, but what we actually wear.

2 Dolce & Gabbana: in an anti-intellectual age, this is clever fashion


Ice-cream cones, pizzas, Madonnas, spaghetti, olive oil bottles: this is not a 
subtle or nuanced take on Italian culture. But there is a kind of genius toD&G 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dolce-and-gabbana>. While the fashion 
industry ties itself in knots trying to balance heritage with the zeitgeist and 
tradition withSnapchat <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/snapchat>, Dolce 
& Gabbana has an idiot savant’s instinct for shows with an uncomplicated appeal 
that leaves the purists breathing its dust.

sophistication of aMake America Great Again cap 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/sep/04/make-donald-trumps-next-great-caps-again-also>
, but that’s exactly the point. This is the year of the anti-intellectual, the 
year when the experts became the bogeymen. Dolce & Gabbana has a business 
rooted in skilled craftmanship and expert tailoring – its stores are still full 
of beautifully tailored suits, and refined cocktail wear – but it has the 
instinctive emotional intelligence to grasp that, in 2016, the most effective 
message is the simplest one. Italian food and emoji-level communication: what’s 
not to love?

3 Versace: athleisure’s legacy for this party season will be the comfortable 
evening shoe


Donatella Versace and Miuccia Prada are the two polar opposite grande dames of 
Milan fashion week, so it is a significant moment when the two of them agree on 
a look. AtVersace <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/versace>, the first two 
models on to the catwalk wore a sporty version of an evening sandal, heeled but 
withTeva <http://www.teva.co.uk/>-style wide, velcro-tabbed straps rather than 
spindly, piano-wire buckled ones. AtPrada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/prada>, medium-heeled evening sandals had 
sparkle at the front, but the same sporty-utilitarian vibe at the ankle strap.

The athleisure aesthetic does not sit as naturally in Milan as it does in New 
York, where sporting chic is at the heart of style heritage. (The Italian TV 
presenter at Versace who complimentedSerena Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> on being “so sporty 
<http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/09/every-supermodel-walked-the-versace-spring-2017-show.html>
” seemed to sum up the way in which female athleticism is still treated almost 
as an eccentricity here.) Until recently, this was reflected in catwalks where 
tracksuit bottoms and go-faster striped collections were worn with wobbly 
stilettos. But the prime party-season takeout is the long-awaited triumph of 
the dancefloor sandal over the taxi shoe.

4 Prada: the skirt is back


Anna Wintour <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/anna-wintour> pointed to “
the appropriation of normal clothing 
<http://www.vogue.com/13483916/milan-fashion-week-spring-2017-mfw-anna-wintour-video/>
” as a theme of the Milan shows. There were hotel slippers at D&G and anoraks 
at Versace, but the spiritual home of the elevated-normal will always bePrada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/prada>. After last season’s sailor hats 
and corset belts, Prada was back to doing what Prada does best, which is 
offbeat versions of normal clothes. Key points to note: the skirt – which has 
been mostly sidelined from recent catwalks in favour of crazy trouser shapes – 
was very much back here.

This is probably a good commercial move, because a glance around the audience 
reveals that everyone is still wearing those foil skirts from, like, three 
seasons ago, so clearly there’s a market for a fancy skirt. Observe, also, the 
deliberately nausea-inducing colour combination, which is what makes this 
outfit look fashion and is the reason why theDuchess of Cambridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/duchess-of-cambridge> with her matchy-matchy, 
tone-on-tone wardrobe never ever looks fashion even when she’s in head-to-toe 
McQueen or Preen.

5 Fendi: the prime rib is the new cold shoulder


In the afterglow of the July couture show, staged on a glassed-over Trevi 
fountain, Fendi is a serious fashion force right now. This week’s catwalk show 
took looks that were hovering on the edges of our vision and pulled them into 
focus. Knitted sock boots put a pretty spin on a sellout piece from the cult
Vetements <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vetements> line; pinafore-shape 
dresses looked grownup and elegant; handbags boasted the ornate guitar-strap 
handles that will dominate in 2017. But the central message was in the sweaters 
– simple and long-sleeved but cropped or slashed to show the lower ribs.

Say goodbye to the cold shoulder, and get ready for the prime rib. This trend 
is unlikely to have the same mass appeal – the allure of the cold-shoulder 
being precisely that this is a body part normal women feel confident in 
revealing, which doesn’t translate to the torso – but the look certainly seemed 
to make an impression on Fendi front-rower Serena Williams, who sported an 
ab-flashing sweater for her next fashion week appearance atVersace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/versace>.
