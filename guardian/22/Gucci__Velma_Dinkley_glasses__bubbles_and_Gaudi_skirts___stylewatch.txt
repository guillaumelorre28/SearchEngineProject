Like Sofia Coppola or Bret Easton Ellis, Gucci has a thematic obsession with 
the floaty ennui of the idle rich, clacking about from party venue to party 
venue. Previous adverts have included the Christiane F.-inspired, 
morning-after-the-night-beforeHotel in Berlin bum rush 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSuc4H0wkao> and the slow-mo vision of The Mod 
Squad throwing shapes on thedance floor 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQOppPHIOHk>. In its new autumn/winter 
campaign, the action has moved from Germany to the artificial grandeur of Tokyo.

We meet a trio of friends (two girls and a guy, like an haute version of Human 
League) blowing bubbles and dressed in a heady bricolage of blood red, art 
deco, diamond-shaped dresses, sequined Gaudi-esque skirts and Velma Dinkley 
glasses. As soon as they enter a vehicle that resembles the Christmas Coca-Cola 
truck (alight with Japanese signage and twinkly lights), it feels as if things 
have gone full Alessandro Michele. They head to their destination: an arcade to 
play games and, um, blow some more bubbles. A melancholy undertow persists, 
courtesy of the soundtrack (Pretender by Black Marble, a doom synth number from 
2012) and the subtitles that appear Karaoke-like at the bottom of the screen 
(random phrases of disenfranchisement such as: “I don’t believe in chance”). 
Here the transfixing beauty of an ephemeral bubble becomes a metaphor for the 
temporary halcyon days of #SquadGucci.
