Charles: I only watch shows featuring traditional hedge-laying methods, which 
is why I love Countryfile but never got on with The Sopranos. Instead of seeing 
a psychiatrist, why couldn’t Tony have built a dry stone wall? It certainly 
helped Winston Churchill’s mental health!

Camilla: I always like Harry Potter. Particularly Voldermort who I think is a 
much misunderstood character. Wouldn’t it be nice if just once he got Harry 
Potter? That would certainly make my Christmas.

Wills Planet Earth or anything about animals and conservation: a subject dear 
to my heart. But I won’t see much TV as most of the time I’ll be out shooting 
pheasant.

Kate: I’ll be watching Jamie’s Ultimate Christmas on Channel 4 and I’m 
planning to cook his Well Pukka, Right Bangin’, Eat It You Slag Brussels 
Sprouts. He came from nothing, just like me, although he hasn’t changed his 
accent!

Pippa: I adore Made in Chelsea. It’s a good way to catch up with future 
relatives! Plus my telly’s stuck on E4 and I’ve lost the remote.

Harry: I’ll be watching Sherlock. I like how he solves the crimes using 
something called “thinking”. But if it’s on on the first of January I’ll miss 
it as I usually spend the first two days of the New Year in intensive care.

Beatrice: I’ll be watching The Crown. I never knew how hard The Queen and 
Prince Philip’s lives were. Poor Grandad had to give up being a lieutenant in 
the navy to tour the world at the tax-payer’s expense and live in a selection 
of palaces? No wonder he’s always swearing!

Eugenie: I’ll be watching it too. They’ve got everybody spot on, except 
Princess Margaret who I never remember seeing sober.

As told to George Jeffrie and Bert Tyler-Moore
