When the US-based technology research company, Forrester, released a benchmark 
report this year on mobile banking products around the world, it was a feather 
in the cap for one of Australia’s big four.

“A cluster of banks is racing forward by putting customers at the centre of 
their strategy, striving to anticipate customers’ emerging needs, and by 
embracing an agile and iterative approach to speed up the development of new 
mobile capabilities that differentiate them from their peers,” said Forrester 
analyst Aurelie L’Hostis.

“Today, these banks are delivering outstanding services to their customers in 
mobile, and in 2016, Westpac in Australia is leading the pack.”

For Travis Tyler, general manager, consumer digital, Westpac Group, this was a 
well-deserved accolade for a company that has embraced digital transformation 
whole-heartedly.

“This was a huge achievement for us,” Tyler says. “And great recognition for a 
wonderful team that has worked hard for many years.”

Customer expectations

Digital disruption is posing urgent challenges, and presenting huge 
opportunities, for most areas of human endeavour. And the traditionally staid 
banking industry is no exception.

The average person engages with their mobile phone 150 times a day, according 
to Westpac research. And they have high standards.

We speak internally about the concept of being a digital sixth sense for our 
customers

“Gone are the days where we are being compared to the other banks when it 
comes to online or mobile experience,” Tyler says. “Our customers are now 
comparing us against all of their other day-to-day digital experiences, whether 
it’s the immediacy of Uber, the service features of Facebook or the 
functionality of Google. We’re no longer just being measured against our 
competitors.

“With smartphones being used by more than 85% of Australians, and banking 
being one of the most trusted personal functions people do on their phones, it 
was critical for us to deliver a market-leading service that is also trusted, 
safe and secure.

“We’ve spent a lot of time listening to our customers to understand their 
needs, and observing global technology trends to help us anticipate what’s 
coming.”

Innovating at top speed

Banking isn’t generally thought of as an enjoyable consumer activity. But 
Westpac was quick to realise that technology offered an opportunity to improve 
its customers’ experiences.

“When we started our digital journey, our major focus was on removing friction 
in the banking process,” Tyler says. “We knew our customers didn’t like filling 
in long forms, having to repeatedly prove their identity every time they 
applied for a product, or having to call us to do simple things like activating 
a card.”

Westpac’s subsequent innovations have included an Unlock & Activate 
application process that lets customers open a bank account or apply for a 
credit card in less than three minutes; electronic verification so customers 
can easily prove their identity online; and the ability to activate a card by 
taking a photo on a smartphone.

 Despite Westpac being a corporate giant, these innovations have been brought 
into effect quickly.

“Like many other large organisations, our initial challenge was around 
rallying the internal approvals we needed to get off the ground,” Tyler says. 
“However, we’re very fortunate at Westpac that despite our size, we’ve got an 
executive team that very much have their finger on the pulse and are supportive 
and progressive when it comes to digital and technology.”

That ability to make changes quickly has proved crucial.

“Gone are the days where you can run a 12-month project to deliver a customer 
outcome – by the time you’ve delivered it, they’ve moved on.

“We’ve learned from this and adopted an agile delivery model that enables us 
to provide new and richer functionality to our customers faster, and more 
cost-efficiently, than ever before.”

Changing staff profiles

We’ve spent a lot of time listening to our customers to understand their 
needs, and observing global technology trends
Travis Tyler 
The digital age has shifted Westpac’s recruitment focus. The company tries to 
anticipate market trends and looks for skillsets that it might need in two, or 
five years’ time. New recruits aren’t necessarily from a finance background. 
Attitude and the ability to learn have become increasingly valued attributes.

The company’s progressive attitude has made staff retention easier, Tyler says.

“Our employees love the fact that they’re at the forefront of technology and 
that the work they are doing is contributing to and being seen by literally 
millions of people every day.

“There aren’t too many places where you have that opportunity to help that 
many people.”

Benefits across the board

Digital transformation has improved almost every aspect of Westpac’s business, 
Tyler says. With one in four bank products now sold digitally, customer 
experience, profitability, employee engagement and the bank’s reputation have 
all benefited.

But there’s no time to sit still.

“We speak internally about the concept of being a digital sixth sense for our 
customers,” Tyler says. “That is, being able to anticipate their needs and 
offer them the right banking solution when they need it, automate the everyday 
things they don’t necessarily like doing and augmenting their experience to 
make it personal.

“One of our greatest strengths is the connection between our physical and 
digital network and offering a connected experience for our customers, however 
they choose to interact with us – digitally, over the phone or walking into one 
our branches. A critical part of our digital transformation is making sure we 
keep our people at the heart of what we do.”
