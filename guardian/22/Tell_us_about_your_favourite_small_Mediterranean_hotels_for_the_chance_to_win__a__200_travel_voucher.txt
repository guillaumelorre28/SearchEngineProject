There are lots of things that can make a independently run Mediterranean hotel 
special: owners who take the trouble to advise you on trips and tell you about 
local customs, staff who help amuse the kids, a well kept swimming pool, 
idiosyncratic decor and lovely breakfasts, for example. We want to hear your 
recommendations with details of price, services and locale.

Send us your specific tips via GuardianWitness 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/>, including as much detail as you can in 
around 100 words (along with website, prices etc, if possible).


The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
fromUK.hotels.com <https://uk.hotels.com/>, allowing you to stay in more than 
260,000 places worldwide. Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using 
the text tab.

You’re welcome to add a photo if you own the copyright to it – but it’s the 
text we’ll be judging.
