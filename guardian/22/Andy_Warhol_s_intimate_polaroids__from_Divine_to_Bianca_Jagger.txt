When selfies were still called self-portraits, Andy Warhol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol> took loads of them, along 
with photographs of the great and the good of his era.

This one comes from the man himself, who wears round specs with clear plastic 
frames. Combine with a kind of preppy, old man-ish look – bowtie, corduroy – 
and, if you’re Yves Saint Laurent, an open-necked shirt and medallion. Classy.

This can be worn any way you like. Candy Darling wears hers as a sort of wrap 
while Grace Jones creates some sort of head piece, adding a white fuzzy hat. 
All the better for framing that genetic gift that is otherwise known as her 
face.

Warhol is a fixture of New York but it turns out he got around. There are 
photos in this book of him hanging out with Jackie O’s sister Lee Radziwill and 
children on the beach (Cape Cod, surely) and Yves Saint Laurent and Bianca 
Jagger in Venice. The soft sunshine in the back of this picture is almost 
enough to distract from the awesomeness of this pairing.

A scowl and a pout at the same time

Warhol could do joy but, as someone obsessed with cool, a touch of rebel edge 
would always go down well, too. There are lots of scowly people in this book 
but the top prize goes to Divine, who practically spits out of her picture. 
Fast forward 40 years, and this expression is basically whatKim Kardashian

 does on Instagram on a daily basis.
