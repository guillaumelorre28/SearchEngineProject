US security services accuse Russia of interfering in the US election (Trump 
meets with intelligence leaders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/06/donald-trump-russia-hacking-meeting-intelligence-officials>
 after calling Russia case ‘witch-hunt’, 6 January), but in view of FBI director
James Comey’s bombshell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails>
 only 11 days before the election – announcing that the FBI had discovered 
additional emails and was reviewing them to see whether they were related to 
its investigation into Clinton’s handling of classified information – are we to 
assume he is also a Russian agent?

• Loner, hacker supreme – forget Alisa Shevchenko (Young Russian denies she 
aided election hackers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/russian-hacker-putin-election-alisa-shevchenko>
, 7 January), it’s got to be Wasp (Lisbeth Salander

• Good for the pope (Go ahead and breastfeed in church 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/08/pope-francis-encourages-mothers-breastfeed-sistine-chapel>
, 9 January). Another benefit of breastfeeding, which would appeal to the pope, 
is that it can be an effective method of birth control, as long as 
breastfeeding remains exclusive and frequent. The activities of milk companies 
have inadvertently contributed to the population explosion, increasing the 
number of their potential customers.

• Like Andy Croft (Letters, 9 January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/08/poetic-injustice-and-literary-look-aheads>
) I too have concerns about the Guardian’s list of must-read books for 2017. 
It failed to take into account the growing market for self-published books, 
many of them of higher quality than so-called mainstream books. In particular, 
I suspect one bestseller is due to be out in October 2017: Corpse Roads of 
Cumbria by Alan Cleaver.

• Had Peter Riocreux (Letters, 9 January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/08/bang-go-the-banjos-for-trumps-inauguration>
) asked the good Dr Wiki for advice he would have learned that: “The word 
broccoli comes from the Italian plural of broccolo, which means ‘the flowering 
crest of a cabbage’. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli>” The internet can 
tell you a lot.

• I’m not sure about a broccolo, but I do know that a spaghetto is the last 
strand left on your plate.
