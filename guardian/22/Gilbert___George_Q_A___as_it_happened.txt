We ate in Stoke Newington for many years. And then we saw the newly opened 
Mangal II which had beautiful pale blue tablecloths and looked too posh for 
most people so it remained empty every time we passed. And the one night we 
looked at the menu and saw that it featured testicles and we thought: wow, 
tablecloths and testicles, and we never looked back. Lots of Mangal II love G&G.

We found out a long time ago that the most common reason why a person didn't 
see an exhibition is because they didn't know it was on. We did some amateur

Dear Gilbert & George,

What do you think of contemporary arts role socially today? As artist's have 
more time to be in the quotidien, or the artistic practice of everyday life; 
under a conservative government, should they become polemical, and engage in 
art-activism? Even if it fails?

Art is playing a bigger role in society than it ever did in our lifetime. 
Everybody on the street knows the names of living artists. This wasn't true

Post your questions for Gilbert & George

Their slogan is "Art for All" and Gilbert & George certainly put their all 
into art, having spent the past five decades as "living sculptures" (in their 
own words) of the East London world where they share a home and career.


"We have two main privileges," said George in a 2012 Guardian interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/mar/02/gilbert-george-london-pictures-interview>
. "We can bolt the door of the studio and make pictures that say exactly what 
we want. Then we can take them out into the world and no one can say: not this 
one or not that one."

The pair met at Central St Martin's art college in 1967. Two decades later 
they won the Turner Prize, and in 2007, earned a 40th anniversaryretrospective 
at Tate Modern 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/artblog/2007/may/04/doubleactputhumourbackint>
. But it's theWhite Cube  
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/08/gilbert-and-george-white-cube-exhibition>
gallery where their art is most often seen and where they return on Friday with 
a major new show,Scapegoating Pictures for London
