 Leonardo DiCaprio calls for action on climate change. 
The year of #OscarsSoWhite was a banner season for political protest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/29/leonardo-dicaprio-political-2016-oscars-spotlight-lady-gaga-joe-biden-sam-smith>
, even if the expected complaints about ethnic diversity failed to ignite at 
the Oscars ceremony itself.Lady Gaga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga> provided a heartfelt gesture in 
support of sexual abuse survivors, and the producers ofSpotlight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/spotlight> directly addressed the pope, 
saying: “It’s time to protect the children and restore the faith.” But the king 
of protest turned out to beDiCaprio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio>, who used his best actor 
win as a platform to call for action on climate change, “for our children’s 
children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by 
the politics of greed”. Weeks earlier, DiCaprio had used his Golden Globe win to
support First Nation issues <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncgFQAISaGo>, to 
“protect your indigenous lands from corporate interest and people that are out 
there to exploit them.”

 Michael Moore decrys the Iraq war at the 2003 Oscars. 
Moore <https://www.theguardian.com/film/michaelmoore>’s track record as an 
activist had gone before him, so expectations of something special were high 
when he won a best documentary Oscar in 2003. He didn’t disappoint, with an 
incendiary effort decrying the Iraq war. “We live in a time where we have a man 
sending us to war for fictitious reasons … Shame on you, Mr Bush, shame on you. 
And any time you have got the pope and theDixie Chicks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/mar/28/artsfeatures3> against you, 
your time is up.” Moore was booed, threatened and stalked for his trouble.

 Vanessa Redgrave speaks on Palestinian issues. 
Moore, though, was an amateur compared with Redgrave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/vanessa-redgrave>, who doubled down on her 
record of radical pro-Palestinian activism upon winning the best supporting 
actress Oscar in 1978. Having been the target of protesters herself, Redgrave 
complimented her audience that they “stood firm and you have refused to be 
intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums whose behaviour 
is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and their great and 
heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression … I salute you and I 
thank you and I pledge to you that I will continue to fight against 
antisemitism and fascism.”

 Native American activist Sacheen Littlefeather collects Marlon Brando’s best 
actor Oscar. 
All-time honours, though, go to Brando 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/marlonbrando>, who boycotted the 1973 
ceremony, and had native American activist Sacheen Littlefeather collect his 
best actor Oscar instead. (That old smoothieRoger Moore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/roger-moore>, co-presenting the award with 
Liv Ullmann, no doubt raised a quizzical eyebrow when Littlefeather refused the 
statuette.) Littlefeather cited Brando’s reasons as “the treatment of American 
Indians today by the film industry” and the infamousWounded Knee 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_incident> standoff which had 
started a month before. Brando’s letter, which Littlefeather didn’t read on the 
podium, was later released to the press and asserted: “We lied to them. We 
cheated them out of their lands. We starved them into signing fraudulent 
agreements that we called treaties which we never kept. We turned them into 
beggars on a continent that gave life for as long as life can remember.”

 Richard Gere speaks out on China’s human rights record in Tibet. 
New-age political protest arrived via Gere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-gere>’s most public articulation of 
his views on Tibet, although it wasn’t technically an acceptance speech, as he 
was at the Oscars to present the best art direction award toHowards End 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/41530/howards.end>. But he took the 
opportunity anyway, describing China’s human rights as “horrendous” and asking 
the audience to send vibes directly to Deng Xiaoping. “If something miraculous, 
really kind of movie-like could happen here where we could all kind of send 
love and truth and kind of sanity to Deng Xiaoping right now in Beijing – that 
he will take his troops and take the Chinese away from Tibet and allow these 
people to live as free independent people again.” Would anyone try that today?

 Patricia Arquette raises the issue of gender equality in 2015. 
Gender equality was the big issue in 2015; and its one that has never really 
gone away in Hollywood. Its most stirring articulation was arguably byArquette 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/patricia-arquette>, who won best supporting 
Oscar for her role as a harassed mother inBoyhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/boyhood>. “To every woman who gave birth, to 
every taxpayer and citizen of this nation, we have fought for everybody else’s 
equal rights. It’s time to have wage equality once and for all. And equal 
rights for women in the United States of America.”

 Kanye West voices his concern for victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 
It wasn’t an acceptance speech, but West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest>’s ad-libbed interpolations during 
a scripted segment of the 2005 benefit concert for victims of Hurricane Katrina 
took an earnest, well-meaning blandathon hostage just as effectively as any 
awards show. After complaining about the way black flood victims were portrayed 
in the media, West finished up by saying: “George Bush doesn’t care about black 
people.” Co-presenterMike Myers <https://www.theguardian.com/film/mike-myers>, 
who tried to stay on-script, looked suitably consternated as the camera cut 
away.
