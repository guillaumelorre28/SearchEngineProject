Pokémon Go <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go> has finally 
given players a big reason to come back to the game: the introduction of the 
first new Pokemon since it launched back in July.

Pokémon <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon> trainers can now 
catch Ditto, an amorphous blob that can transform into any other Pokemon using 
its signature move “mimic”. But there’s a catch.

You won’t see Ditto on the world map, the overview screen where players see 
which Pokémon are around them. That’s because it’s hiding in plain sight, 
disguised as other Pokémon. In other words, that Ratatta orPidgey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/04/pokemon-go-pidgeys> you 
wouldn’t normally bother with? If you catch it, it might be a Ditto.

If someone else nearby you has caught the Ditto in the area already, it will 
show up marked in its true form.

Once you’ve caught Ditto, it acts largely like you’d expect. You can take it 
to a Pokémon gym, where it will transform itself into a copy of the first 
Pokémon you fight, stealing its moves. Unless it’s another Ditto, in which case 
both blobs will sit there, uselessly blobbing at each other with a basic attack.

As if that isn’t a good enough reason to pop back to Pokémon Go, the game is 
also offering double XP and stardust for the next week, to “say thank you” to 
the community. It’s almost as though Niantic Labs knows it’s Thanksgiving in 
the US and wants to make the most of the fact that people might have more time 
to play the game.
