The tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, will review the system of travel 
allowances and work-related expenses for members of parliament after public 
concern about some MPs “double-dipping” by claiming a tax deduction in addition 
to the travel allowance while staying in their own homes in Canberra.


There was confusion on Monday about rules that allow MPs to claim a tax 
deduction in addition to the $273-a-night travel allowance to stay in Canberra, 
even when they stay in a property that they or their partner own.

Critical media reports on Sunday named numerous politicians on both sides of 
the aisle who owned property in Canberra who would be eligible for the 
deduction, includingMathias Cormann

Labor had defended the practice on the weekend, but it changed tack on Monday

The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/chris-bowen>, told reporters the practices 
involving MPs claiming travel allowances and pursuing deductions were not in 
line with community standards and needed to change.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, initially rebuffed Labor’s overture 
while campaigning in the marginal New South Wales seat of Eden-Monaro on Monday 
– but while campaigning in SydneyScott Morrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison> told reporters he 
would be seeking particulars from Labor about what it was proposing.

“We’ll be in contact with [Chris Bowen’s] office, that may already have 
occurred so we can see exactly what he is proposing,” Morrison said.

“And we’ll have a look at exactly what he is proposing.”

But Jordan has effectively neutralised the controversy before it gathers more 
steam in the election campaign.

In a statement on Monday evening, Jordan said the tax office would review the 
ruling on MPs allowances to allay community concerns.

“The rules are the same for every taxpayer, regardless of their occupation,” 
Jordan said.


“Any taxpayer who has had to travel overnight for work is entitled to deduct 
the costs of meals and accommodation under our tax laws.

“However, given that there are clear misunderstandings of how the ruling is 
applied, we will undertake to review the 1999 ruling to give greater clarity 
for all taxpayers on the treatment of allowances they may receive from their 
employer to cover the costs of work related travel.”

On Sunday Cormann defended the practice of politicians receiving a 
$273-a-night travel allowance

 while also claiming tax deductions for mortgages and rents for properties in 
Canberra.

He said the travel allowance was set independently by the remuneration 
tribunal and tax rules were set independently by the tax office, and applied 
equally to all members of parliament.

“I comply with all of the rules,” Cormann said. “Of course the tax ruling for 
members of parliament, which is quite comprehensive ... provides what 
deductions can and cannot be made. I provide all of that information to my 
accountant.”
