Take me there: Fermanagh Lakes

Why go?
Locals like to tell you that for six months of the year the lakes are in 
Fermanagh and for the other six, Fermanagh is in the lakes. And it’s true, this 
corner of Northern Ireland, with its reed-fringed loughs and rivers, can at 
times seem more liquid than land. It’s an evocative place that has made a 
lasting mark on Ireland’s cultural landscape. Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett 
both went to school in Enniskillen – a connection celebrated with A Wilde 
Weekend (launched in early May) and the Happy Days festival which brings to 
life the works of Beckett with readings and performances in unexpected 
locations (23 July-3 August, happy-days-enniskillen.com 
<http://happy-days-enniskillen.com/>).

What to do
You could easily spend a week pottering around on Fermanagh’s waterways, 
either by motorboat or canoe (canoeni.com/canoe-trails/lough-erne 
<http://canoeni.com/canoe-trails/lough-erne>). There are some 150 islands to 
explore. Don’t miss the monastic ruins on Devenish Island and the early 
Christian carvings on White Island. Float along a subterranean river beneath 
the limestone stalactites at the Marble Arch Caves (marblearch cavesgeopark.com 
<http://www.marblearchcavesgeopark.com/>). The National Trust-owned Florence 
Court and Castle Coole run regular events for families (nationaltrust.org.uk 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/>).

Where to stay
Geaglum Cottage is a cosy thatched hideaway on Upper Lough Erne. There’s an 
open fire, vintage furnishings and a beautifully restored gypsy caravan in the 
garden (sleeps three, plus two in the caravan,underthethatch.co.uk/rci 
<http://www.underthethatch.co.uk/rci>).

Where to eat
Tully Mill is an intimate stone-walled restaurant in a converted millhouse in 
the leafy grounds of the Florence Court estate (028 6634 9879).

Insider tip
Sean Doran, artistic director of the Happy Days festival, recommends a pint in 
Blakes of the Hollow pub (blakesofthehollow.com <http://blakesofthehollow.com/>
): “The Irish writer Colm Tóibín described it as ‘a cathedral of a pub’. It’s 
got an old Victorian bar with peaceful snugs, and I use it as an unofficial 
festival club.”

 The Azmakhan Deluxe, a fittingly low-key hotel. 
Away: a relaxing place to stay in Turkey Four years ago the sleepy Turkish 
town of Akyaka became an officially designated ‘slow town’ to protect its 
relaxed pace of life. The Azmakhan Deluxe is a new, fittingly low-key hotel, 
with carved wooden ceilings and balconies, a Turkish bath and views over the 
Gulf of Gokova. Anatolian Sky Holidays is offering a week’s stay from £626pp 
B&B, including flights and transfers, in June (anatoliansky.co.uk
