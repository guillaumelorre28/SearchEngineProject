Free walking tours

Instead of wandering aimlessly along the Unesco-lauded canals, get your 
bearings courtesy of a complimentary walking tour.Sandemans New Amsterdam 
<http://www.newamsterdamtours.com/> offers three-hour ambles twice a day, 
covering staples such as the gentrification of the Red Light District and the
Begijnhof Convent <http://www.amsterdam.info/sights/begijnhof/>, an inner 
courtyard leading to the Civic Guards Gallery, where a collection of paintings 
by old masters is on permanent display. TheOriginal Amsterdam Alternative Tour 
<http://originalamsterdamtours.com/#2>, which starts daily at 2pm, at 
Spuistraat, features a more eclectic selection that can often include street 
art squatter areas and hidden graffiti.

 The Pancake Bakery 
Start your budget food odyssey around central Amsterdam with pannenkoeken, 
crepes that deliver most of your daily caloric intake in a sweet or savoury 
pizza-size package. If you can’t snag one of the four tables atPannenkoekenhuis 
Upstairs <http://www.upstairspannenkoeken.nl/> then Pancakes Amsterdam 
<http://www.pancakesamsterdam.com/> offers equally tasty options, albeit in a 
charmless, fluorescent-lit space. A classic pannenkoeken will cost around €6, 
but it’s worth the €9.80 splurge on a spinach variation topped with pine nuts, 
pepitas and a slab of molten goat cheese. The more atmospheric Pancake Bakery 
<http://www.pancake.nl/> has crepes (from €6.25) slathered with everything from 
Thai red curry to Indonesian peanut sauce, as well aspoffertjies – diminutive, 
butter-fried confections made from yeasted, buckwheat-tinged batter. For lunch, 
grab sandwiches with fillings like Taleggio with tomato-rosemary jam and 
walnuts (€3.50) atDe Laatste Kruimel <http://delaatstekruimel.nl/>, a grilled 
Gouda-and-ham (€5) at one ofToastable <http://toastable.nl/>’s three city 
centre spots, or one of the rotating dishes (from €4) atInStock 
<http://www.instock.nl/en/>, a recent addition, which salvages edibles that 
grocery stores would otherwise discard.

 Pathe Tuschinski Cinema. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock 
A wide array of Dutch and international movies screen for free in personal 
booths at theEYE Film Institute 
<http://goamsterdam.about.com/od/amsterdammuseums/p/Eye-Film-Institute.htm>, 
but for a brush with history, treat yourself to the big-screen version at the
Pathé Tuschinski Cinema <https://www.pathe.nl/>, a grand old building near 
Rembrandtplein where stars such as Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich have 
performed live. Decked out in sumptuous Moroccan carpets, intricate bronze 
detailings and art deco ceilings, the theatre is a lavish affair. Current 
showings range from avant-garde indie hits to popcorn flicks, but you don’t 
need to buy a ticket to bask in the opulent 1921 ambience.

 Keren de Vreede gallery 
To peruse world-class works of art without the hefty admission fee (€17 for the
Van Gogh Museum <http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en>’s Munch exhibition; €17.50 for 
Asia > Amsterdam at theRijksmuseum <https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en>), ditch 
Museumplein for the dozens of galleries in Spiegelkwartier or Jordaan. Weave 
your way down Prinsengracht and its side streets, stopping at smaller places 
such asKeren de Vreede <http://kerendevreede.com/>, where the local artist is 
happy to chat about her textural floral canvases. There are also carefully 
curated collections in larger galleries such asGalerie Ron Mandos 
<http://ronmandos.nl/>, Gabriel Rolt <http://www.gabrielrolt.com/>, Annet 
Gelink Gallery <http://www.annetgelink.com/l/>, and Torch 
<http://www.torchgallery.com/>, then consider stopping for a single-origin 
espresso and more local exhibitions atCloud <http://www.cloudartcoffee.nl/>. 
Finish your tour back in the centre with an aperitif atArt’otel Amsterdam 
<http://artotelamsterdam.com/>’s slick 5&33 bar, which features a cavernous, 
subterranean gallery open to customers and passing viewers alike.

Picnic in the park

Planet Images 
Of the green oases sprinkled throughout the city, Vondelpark 
<http://www.hetvondelpark.net/> is the largest, but the public gardens at the 
Rijksmuseum make for an even more scenic option with their meticulously tended 
flowerbeds, impressive sculpture collection, and pieces of historic Dutch 
architecture. Alternatively, pack your lunch and spy on some of the feathered 
inhabitants at theArtis Zoo <http://www.artis.nl/en/artis-royal-zoo/>. There’s 
an admission (adults from €19.95) to gawk at the 900 species of animals inside, 
but the shady Artisplein nearby costs nothing and has an unimpeded view of the 
flamingo pond.

 An artwork at Electric Lady Land 
Amsterdam’s 50-plus museums feature some fantastically funky, affordable gems, 
includingElectric Lady Land <http://electric-lady-land.com/> (€5), which is the 
world’s first fluorescent museum and every bit as trippy as it sounds. The
Houseboat Museum <http://houseboatmuseum.nl/> (adults €4.50, children €3.50) 
provides a glimpse of life on one of the city’s 2,500-plus live-aboard 
watercraft. At €10, the just-renovatedOur Lord in the Attic 
<http://www.opsolder.nl/en/museum-ons-lieve-heer-op-solder> is a bit steeper, 
but is worth it for a glimpse of a secret 17th-century church ensconced in a 
historic canal house. Check out theCannabis College 
<http://www.cannabiscollege.com/>, too, an information centre where helpful 
staff advise visitors on everything from how to use a vapouriser to how to 
avoid the ire of police and locals. On your way in or out of town, have a look 
at the interactive science exhibits atNEMO Schiphol <http:> – yes, at the 
airport. The museum, in the city centre, has a €15 entry fee, but this smaller 
outpost doesn’t cost anything.

 A room at Ecomama 
Once a derelict, industrial zone, Noord is now one of Amsterdam’s hottest 
neighbourhoods, thanks to the addition of the revitalised shipyardNDSM Wharf 
<http://www.ndsm.nl/en/>, the EYE Film Institute <https://www.eyefilm.nl/en>, 
with a number of free exhibits, andTolhuistuin <http://tolhuistuin.nl/>, a 
multipurpose dining and events space in the former Shell factory canteen. Steps 
from the latter two attractions is the stylish new hostelClinkNOORD 
<http://www.clinkhostels.com/amsterdam/clinknoord/> (dorm rooms from €18, 
doubles from €76), in a refurbished 1920s building with art exhibitions and 
gratis stays for bands willing to perform. The 24/7 reception staff are as 
friendly as can be and the cosy ZincBAR and spacious library encourage 
travellers to set aside their smartphones and mingle. Free ferries make the 
five-minute ride across the IJ to the historic city centre a snap, but should 
you prefer to stay closer to the canals,Ecomama <http://ecomamahotel.com/> 
(dorms from €23, doubles from €84) has environmentally conscious digs – opt for 
the aptly named El Cheapo dorm – right by Waterlooplein. Keep an eye out for
Generator Amsterdam 
<http://generatorhostels.com/en/blog/generator-amsterdam-opening-2016/>, 
another design hostel opening up near Oosterpark in 2016.

 The 3D Print Canal House. Photograph: Marije van Woerden 
A 15-minute stroll from NDSM Wharf, molten squiggles are being transformed 
into the building blocks of what will someday be a 13-room3D Printed Canal House
 <http://3dprintcanalhouse.com/>. Visitors can watch technology evolve during 
the building process; the giant KamerMaker (“room maker”) has tripled in speed 
since the beginning of the project and is being joined by an even more massive 
sibling printer. It’s a unique attraction that, at €2.50 a visit with 
audioguide, is also a steal.

Get your classical music fix for free every Tuesday with a lunch concert at the

which celebrates its 50th anniversary next March with even more freebies. The
Muziekgebouw aan ‘t IJ <http://www.muziekgebouw.nl/informatie/english/> only 
has complimentary concerts once a month, but they are worth seeking out for the 
performances and the modernist, glass-faced structure with a sweeping panorama 
of the waterfront. After dark, head toBourbon Street 
<http://www.bourbonstreet.nl/> for rhythm and blues. Entrance is free on 
Mondays and every evening before 11pm, there’s a €3-€5 cover. Amble five 
minutes down the road toJazz Café Alto <http://www.jazz-cafe-alto.nl/>, where 
performances spanning genres from salsa to soul are free all night every night. 
Sensibly priced drinks, a lively multigenerational crowd and a laid-back vibe 
make this a popular local choice.

 IJ-Hallen flea market. Photograph: Nichon Glerum 
For price and sheer utilitarianism, the ubiquitous Dutch HEMA 
<http://hemaontwerpwedstrijd.nl/english/> chain is hard to beat. To give 
fledgling designers a boost, the retailer hosts an annual competition in which 
fashion students enter for a chance to have their creations mass-produced and 
distributed. The city offers an abundance of vintage threads that even budget 
backpackers can afford. AtKiloshop 
<https://www.facebook.com/kiloshopamsterdam?_rdr=p> wares are priced by weight, 
with retro Parisian dresses and other finds often coming in at under €10. Out 
of the string of trendy shops on Haarlemmerstraat,Rumors Vintage 
<https://www.facebook.com/RumorsVintage?_rdr=p> is a favourite for stylish 
coats capable of withstanding the country’s soggy weather. True bargain-hunters 
will want to prowl the local flea markets; head east forDappermarkt 
<http://www.dappermarkt.nl/>, a grand bazaar of food and garments from the 
city’s Surinamese and African communities, or north for the monthly flea market 
at Noord’sIJ-Hallen Vlooienmarkt <http://ijhallen.nl/en/>.
