Villalpando to La Camperona, dropping Team Sky’s Froome to gain 33 seconds on 
the Tour de France winner and take the leader’s jersey from Darwin Atapuma (BMC 
Racing), who finished two minutes down.

Froome was passed by Alberto Contador (Tinkoff Saxo) before the line but 
remains third in the general classification standings, 27 seconds behind 
Quintana.

Quintana’s team-mate Alejandro Valverde crossed the line with Froome and now 
sits in second place in the GC standings, 19 seconds behind the Colombian.

Sergey Lagutin (Katusha) won the stage after holding off Axel Domont (AG2R La 
Mondiale), Perrig Quemeneur (Direct Energie) and Pieter Serry 
(Etixx-Quick-Step) in the closing stages.

But the GC drama was just getting started behind them, as Froome was initially 
distanced by Movistar but fought back before launching an attack of his own.

Quintana kept pace, though, and then surged clear in the last kilometre of the 
gruelling Alto de la Camperona.

Contador’s late attack earned him 12 seconds over Valverde and Froome and saw 
the three-time Vuelta winner move up to sixth in the standings, 1min 39sec 
behind Quintana.

However, the stage belonged to winner Lagutin, who told Eurosport: “I’ve been 
dreaming about it since I was little, to win a stage of a Grand Tour like the 
Vuelta, so when this happened I couldn’t believe that it happened to me. I’m 
35-years-old and at some point I thought that it was probably it, but I still 
hoped that it was for me.”
