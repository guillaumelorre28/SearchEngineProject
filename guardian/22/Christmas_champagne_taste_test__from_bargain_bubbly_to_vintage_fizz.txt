Can a good socialist tell the difference between cheap plonk and the best 
bubbly? Our plucky columnists put their palates and their politics on the line 
to find out.Berry Bros & Rudd's <http://www.bbr.com/> vintage champagnes were 
rigorously blind-tasted against supermarket fizz by Jon Henley, assistant 
comment editor David Shariatmadari, Zoe Williams and Marina Hyde.
 1996 Champagne R&L Legras, Veuve Monsigny and Pierre Darcys 
1996 Champagne R&L Legras, Cuvee Exceptionelle, St Vincent BB&R, 
<http://www.bbr.com/products-945550-1996-champagne-randl-legras-cuvee-exceptionelle-st-vincent>
 £75

Darker appearance than most on offer. Marina was impressed with bubbles that 
"really applied themselves to the task of bubbling". Complex and layered, smoky 
and rich. Despite the words "cat pee" appearing in one taster's notes, "smells 
like teen spirit" and "burnt rubber" in others', it achieved no less than four 
out of five from all, which may tell us quite a lot about our panel's personal 
tastes.

Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut by Philizot Aldi 
<https://www.aldi.co.uk/en/product-range/drinks/wine-cellar/sparkling-wine/sparkling-wine-product-detail-page/ps/p/veuve-monsigny-champagne-brut-by-philizot/>
, £9.99

This was found to be silky and light, with Jon finding notes of honey and 
lychee. The word "smooth" appears in all testers' notes. One judge was so taken 
with it, they awarded full marks, while it was "a bit insipid" for another ("a 
champagne that blends into the background"). It's "attractive but knows it" 
offered another judge, grudgingly.

Pierre Darcys Champagne Brut Asda 
<http://groceries.asda.com/asda-webstore/landing/home.shtml#/product/81605794>, 
£10 (normally £24.99)

Marina was unimpressed with the laziness of the bubbles in this one and 
another thought it "eggy". (Since they gave it four out of five, we assume eggy 
is good. Like cat pee, and burnt rubber.) One judge said "exotic – not bad at 
all", while David detected "a touch of bubblegum and candy floss" and found it 
"on the sweet side but quite cute".

 Tesco's Premier Cru, Ruinart and Waitrose Vintage 
Premier Cru Brut Tesco 
<http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=255245446>, £19.99

Marina had this down as being a bit dirty, all leather and lace, like an Alice 
Cooper video (again, this translated to a high mark for her), while another 
thought it young and fresh. "Bitter, too dry, like sucking a lemon" disapproved 
Jon, bringing it down to a three.

Ruinart, Rose BB&R <http://www.bbr.com/products-4010-ruinart-rose>, £55

"Pink! So pink!" This "light and summery" fizz brought some relief for 
glassy-eyed panelists intently staring from one pale yellow glassful to 
another. Smooth and savoury, its structure particularly impressed Zoe: "Sort of 
architectural, opening out like a cathedral."

3/5

Vintage Champagne 2004 Waitrose 
<http://www.waitrosedirect.com/product/waitrose-brut-special-reserve-vintage-04/083802>
, £30.99

This "floral" fizz inspired a lyrical "scent of a French meadow after the 
rain" from one sipper and a rather less poetic "smells like a hangover" from 
another. It was nice and easy, and softer on the palate than others, and while 
someone found it "a bit thin" it was enjoyable overall. Bubble watcher Marina 
observed that it "whizzed around a bit but it was less fizzy when its big 
moment came (we've all been there)".

 Comte de Brismand, Pol Roger and Alfred Gratien 
Comte de Brismand Champagne Brut Lidl 
<http://www.lidl.co.uk/cps/rde/SID-20222774-E5224C1D/www_lidl_uk/hs.xsl/3887.htm?action=showDetail&id=5172>
,11.99

This was "smooth and mild, no bitterness". David thought it had notes of 
caramel, but a cheap version, "Cadbury's caramel", he concluded.

3/5

Pol Roger, Brut Reserve BB&R 
<http://www.bbr.com/products-3464-pol-roger-brut-reserve>, £37

Looks much more dainty than it is, thought one judge. "Petrolly," said Zoe, 
"quite Bruce Willis macho, in a nice way – if I smelled that at a party, I'd 
think they probably wanted me to leave quite soon."

3/5

Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve Fortnum and Mason & others 
<http://www.fortnumandmason.com/showproduct.aspx?ProductID=9332&SEName=charles-heidsieck-brut-reserve-nv>
, £45

"Tastes a bit childish but I like it," said Zoe, "thin and a bit sweet, like a 
schoolkid in an M&S advert." A second agreed: "Too sweet for me," though a 
third thought it bitter. David found much to like in its notes of butterscotch, 
"warm and homely like honeycomb".

2/5

Alfred Gratien, Brut BB&R 
<http://www.bbr.com/products-933585-alfred-gratien-brut>, £30.60

Marina felt she could relate to this "pale and uninteresting" sample; for 
another it was brandy-like. A third found it quite bitter, while David thought 
it "steely, elegant, a bit of a Sean Connery".
