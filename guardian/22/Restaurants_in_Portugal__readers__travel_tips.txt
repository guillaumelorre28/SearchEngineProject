Winning tip: Casa Guedes, Porto

Casa Guedes 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/A-Casa-Guedes/118939868173940?sk=timeline>, in 
the old centre of Porto (130 Praças Poveiros) serves juicy slabs of roast pork 
in rustic brown rolls, stuck together with oozing sheep’s cheese. The delicious 
sandwiches are washed down with the bar’s own label albarinho wine, which is 
light and apple-crisp. Stand around outside with the young locals, try the 
house’s rose-coloured fizz and watch the chefs carve pork from the giant roast.

Chapitô à Mesa

This restaurant is part of a circus school complex <http://www.chapito.org/> 
and serves fun, informal food with a delightful twist – either in terms of 
choice of ingredients or presentation. There is a wood-fired grill for mains 
but plenty of lighter options. Make a reservation (+351 21 885 5550) and 
request one of their two window seats, which offer some of the best views in 
Lisbon.

For seafood in Lisbon, go to Tó do Marisco <http://www.tomarisco.com/>, in 
Carnide, close to theBenfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> 
football stadium. This place has the most amazingmariscada, which basically 
consists of a variety of seafood, served with fries and a delicious sauce. For 
afternoon drinks, seek outNoobai <http://www.noobaicafe.com/> – at a viewpoint 
called Adamastor. It’s perfect to have a bottle of white wine and watch the 
sunset while enjoying one of the most beautiful views in town. Later, have a 
cocktail atPark <https://www.facebook.com/00park/info?tab=page_info>, another 
bar with a view of the city at the top of a car park close to Bairro Alto.

Sinal Vermelho 


Finding an empty table in Lisbon’s Bairro Alto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jan/23/lisbon-new-clubbing-scene-nightlife-reports>
 can be tricky, but the owner of a fully booked restaurant quietly directed us 
down an unassuming street to the place he goes on his lunch break. Sinal (89 
Rua das Gaveas) is a welcoming, bustling “local” place with huge portions of 
succulent cod, incredible salmon, crisp white wine and great service.

This is the best place to eat Porto’s speciality francesinha sandwich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/nov/06/travel-portugal-vintage-porto>, 
usually filled with steak or finely cut ham and covered in melted cheese and a 
rich sauce made with tomatoes and beer – with a fried egg and plate of chips 
for dipping. The restaurant has a friendly staff and atmosphere, low prices and 
traditional decor, and you will almost certainly be dining with the locals.

O Batareo, Setúbal

You’ll feel like you’re in a friend’s kitchen here, sharing the freshest 
grilled fish imaginable. It’s a small, unassuming restaurant where even the 
queue to get in is exciting – order a cold beer andwatch one of the owners 
grill fresh sardines 
<https://www.facebook.com/166691670009241/videos/vb.166691670009241/965242333487500/?type=2&theater>
 and red mullet by the door as you wait. Service is exceptional and prices 
surprisingly low for the humongous portions. Side dishes, including simple 
salads and boiled potatoes, are excellent and you can also sit outside.

At Sao Frutuoso you’ll find traditional cooking techniques in a rustic 
family-owned restaurant. Start withpasteis de bacalhau, Portugal’s legendary 
cod fritters. For something typical of the rustic northern countryside, try
cabrito asado, a slow-roasted young goat cooked in a wood-burning oven. It’s a 
meal that highlights northern Portugal’s rich agricultural history and local 
ingredients. Don’t forget the vinho verde, a great young wine.

 North along the coast from Lisbon, working port and surfing hotspot Peniche 
is the perfect place to try fresh sardines. You’ll immediately know you’re in 
sardine country – the scent is unmistakable. Head to the harbourfront and 
you’ll be met with large, juicy specimens atRestaurante Mira Mar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/aug/03/seafood-restaurants-europe> (42 
Avenida do Mar) where the friendly atmosphere gives a flavour of the local 
humour and waiters jovially explain how to eat the fish “properly”.

 The cafeteria in the Pingo Doce supermarket <http://www.pingodoce.pt/pt/> in 
Albufeira may not sound grand, but the food is excellent, as demonstrated by 
how full it is with locals. You can get a two-course meal for two with wine for 
under €10, choosing your own fresh fish or meat to be grilled to order, or 
savour creamybacalhau

but if you are after really good food, this is the place.
