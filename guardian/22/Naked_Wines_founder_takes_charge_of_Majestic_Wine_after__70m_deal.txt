Majestic Wine <https://www.theguardian.com/business/majestic-wine> is to buy 
online rival Naked Wines for up to £70m in a deal that also acquires a new 
chief executive for the retailer.

Naked Wines, founded in 2008, runs a crowdfunded business where around 300,000 
subscribers help fund over 130 independent winemakers in 14 countries in 
exchange for access to exclusive wines at preferential prices.

It generated sales of £74m last year, up 40% on a year ago, but made a loss of 
£3.3m. The firms said the combination boosted Majestic’s online presence while 
providing Naked Wines with a nationwide store network to allow a 
click-and-collect delivery option for its customers.

Majestic and Naked Wines will continue to operate as independent brands. 
As part of the deal Naked Wines founder and chief executive Rowan Gormley will 
take over as boss of the enlarged group. He replaces Majestic’sSteve Lewis who 
left the retailer

 after six years in February following poor sales.

Majestic Wine trades from over 200 outlets and has over 640,000 active 
customers. In January it said like-for-like sales edged up 1.1% in the 10 weeks 
to 5 January, but that it had to sacrifice margin in order to shift stock 
during the period. Total sales lifted 3.7%.

Gormley said the deal provided “the very exciting opportunity to build a world 
class wine retailer, serving customers who are looking for inspiration that the 
supermarkets cannot provide”.

Majestic Wine chairman Phil Wrigley added: “The acquisition of Naked Wines 
represents a transformational deal. The two businesses have significant 
strengths which are very complementary.”
