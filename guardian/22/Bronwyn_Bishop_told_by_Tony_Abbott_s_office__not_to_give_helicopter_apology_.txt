 that cost the former speaker her job, a new book reveals.


The Road to Ruin author Niki Savva has revealed Bishop wanted to “lay it all 
on the line” and issue a “grovelling” apology for taking the expensive ride at 
the taxpayers’ expense.

But the former prime minister’s office told her not to say sorry because it 
would imply guilt and could spark a domino effect that would affect others.


“She was told not to say sorry, not to admit guilt,” Savva told ABC on Sunday.


Bishop’s lack of apology sparked community anger, and almost three weeks after 
the trip was aired publicly, she lost the speakership.

 ‘I have to say I’ll be repaying all expenses towards weddings which, while 
technically in the rules, just doesn’t look right’. 
Savva’s book also reveals Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells’ concern 
about a rumoured affair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/06/abbott-and-credlins-destructive-approach-led-to-downfall-says-author>
 between Abbott and his chief of staff Peta Credlin.


Senator Fierravanti-Wells told Abbott in February 2015 – on the eve of a 
leadership spill vote – that the perception he was having an affair with 
Credlin was damaging him.


Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> MPs have 
played down the accounts in Savva’s book, with attorney general George Brandis 
saying the events should be left to historians.

But communications minister Mitch Fifield urged his coalition colleagues to 
take it in their stride.

“There will be accounts of the events that led to a change of prime minister. 
That’s inevitable,” he told ABC on Sunday. “I think it’s quite right that there 
is a public record of what led to such a significant change.”

He believes his party has shown “incredible” unity since Malcolm Turnbull 
toppled Abbott last year, despite the former prime minister’s strong presence 
in media.


“It’s really for Tony Abbott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tony-abbott> to measure himself 
against the model of how a former prime minister, a former leader should 
conduct themselves, which is John Howard.”

Brandis said Abbott was determined not to be like Kevin Rudd, who disrupted 
Labor’s election campaign in 2010 after being ousted as prime minister by Julia 
Gillard.


“Tony Abbott has absolutely no respect whatsoever for Kevin Rudd,” Brandis 
told Sky News.


But Greens leader Richard Di Natale said the situation was reminiscent of the 
Rudd-Gillard era.


“There’s no question it’s harmful,” he told ABC.
