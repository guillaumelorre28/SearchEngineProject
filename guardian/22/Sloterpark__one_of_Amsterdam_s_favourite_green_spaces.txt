My favourite place in Amsterdam has to be the Sloterpark, one of the largest 
in Amsterdam, at around 90 hectares. I love riding round it on my bike but you 
can easily see it all on foot. There are lots of fun things to do there, too – 
like the disc golf course, which is laid out a little like a normal golf 
course, but you play with frisbees.

Joggers run round its winding paths, and there is also an Olympic size 
swimming pool and an outdoor pool, too. Since they opened back in 2001, the 
pools have been regarded as among the best in the Netherlands. There are also 
gym facilities, and sailing and watersports clubs.

 All welcome … a jogger runs through a crowd of festivalgoers going to the 
Mystic Garden Festival 
The thing I love about it is the way it brings the city together: young 
families like the small zoo, and older ones and tourists enjoy the festivals 
here, such as June’s Mystic Garden, Loveland in August and September’s West 
Beach film festival.

In the north-west corner of the park a piece of land that has been left to its 
own devices since the park was created has become the Het Ruige Riet (Rough 
Reeds) nature reserve.

The park is west of the city centre, slightly off the beaten track, but easy 
to get to on the number 14 tram from Dam Square.
