Hidden on a backstreet in the seedy Barcelona neighbourhood of El Raval, in 
the Ciutat Vella district, lies atablao, a flamenco club, that attracts 
hundreds of aficionados each week. Despite the lingering prostitutes and 
pickpockets, 23 Robadors offers a great preview of the city’s emerging musical 
talents. There is no space for luxury in the small seating area: artists and 
spectators are packed into a 20 sq metre room. This intimacy makes the flamenco 
experience even more unique.

The venue’s jam sessions are particularly special. Established and amateur 
performers play together, young and old, Andalusian and Catalan, Gypsy and 
non-Gypsy. This fusion of talent results in an incredible explosion of raw art.

During the jam sessions, despite the artists’ concentration, the bar is alive 
with Spanish banter. The venue’s tapas and pinxtos cost just €1 apiece, making 
the night out fantastic value.

Informal, original and exhilarating, 23 Robadors is definitely an address to 
tick off on your way through Ciutat Vella, next to Barcelona’s Barrio Gótico. 
You know when you have arrived: the number 23 is lit up bright and bold, just 
like its flamenco.
