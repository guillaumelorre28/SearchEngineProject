The first time I got paid actual money to cook food was on a beautiful 
single-masted sloop superyacht based in the Mediterranean. For two months I 
sailed up and down the Adriatic coast of Croatia, between Trogir and Dubrovnik, 
cooking for rich Americans and disdainful Russians.

And it was on that trip that I found the best restaurant I’ve ever been to. 
It’s a shack, only accessible by boat. The son goes out fishing and the father 
cooks whatever he catches over charcoal while verbally abusing the guests ... 
and that’s about it. Apart from the homemade “wine” he also serves, which takes 
your throat lining with it on the way down.

I feel quite reluctant to share the name of the place, but here goes: it’s 
called Konoba Dionis, and it’s in Vlaka Bay on the island of Sveti Klement, one 
of the Pakleni islands off the west coast of Hvar, near Split. It has views of 
olive trees, vineyards and across to the bigger island of Vis. You probably 
wouldn’t find it by accident; you’d need help from someone in the know.

The best thing that I ate there was the red Adriatic squid, grilled over hot 
coals until it exuded a sweet, fishy Marmitey liquor that I have craved ever 
since.

You can get a similar squid dish at Restaurant Capo (capo-trogir.com 
<http://www.capo-trogir.com/>; it’s also a pizzeria and has apartments to let 
nearby) in the historic harbour town of Trogir. But you have to sit on chairs 
instead of rough wooden benches, and drink nice wine. And you don’t get shouted 
at by an irascible old Croatian man. It’s not the same.
