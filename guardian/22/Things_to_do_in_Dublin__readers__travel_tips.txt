Winning tip: Walking Dublin’s little known northside


The famous Fagan’s Pub <http://faganspub.ie/> in Drumcondra is where the then 
taoiseach Bertie Ahern stopped the traffic to bring Bill Clinton for a jar on 
his visit to Dublin in 2000, and where the photos on the walls document all the 
famous customers as well as the rich local history. Start there then take a 
short walk down Millmount Avenue to Griffith Park and follow the Tolka river to 
theNational Botanic Gardens <http://www.botanicgardens.ie/> (free entry). The 
Palm House is breathtaking – look for the plaque marking the spot where the 
great philosopher Wittgenstein, who lived in Dublin for a couple of years after 
the second world war, liked to sit. The gardens allows direct access to
Glasnevin Cemetery <http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/> (entry free) – Dublin’s Père 
Lachaise – and a focal point of the1916 centenary commemorations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/25/easter-rising-tour-dublin-google-maps-colin-farrell>
. Exiting the cemetery at the south gate (not the main gate) you enter Prospect 
Square and can finish the walk with a pint inJohn Kavanagh’s pub 
<https://www.facebook.com/JohnKavanaghTheGravediggers/>, known locally as the 
Gravediggers. This is one of Dublin’s most atmospheric old pubs and a world 
away from the tourist trap that is the Temple Bar area.

My favourite area of Dublin is a collection of lively streets bounded by 
Grafton Street, Exchequer Street, George’s Street and Stephen Street Lower. 
While it may not be on the traditional tourist circuit, the area is being 
discovered by visitors and has recently acquired the title of Dublin’s Creative 
Quarter. Filled with boutiques, eateries, traditional pubs and arcades, it 
gives a taste of locals’ Dublin. A good place to start exploring isOm Diva 
<http://www.omdivaboutique.com/> (27 Drury St), a wonderful, friendly shop of 
colourful and affordable clothing, from vintage to new designs.

This is one of the less visited sites in Dublin. Marino Casino 
<http://www.visitdublin.com/see-do/details/casino-marino/48869/#53.371324|-6.227020|16>
 is a beautiful but small building designed by Sir William Chambers in the 
mid-18th century and is a fantastic example of neo-classical architecture. It 
is well worth a visit for anyone who is interested in architecture and its 
single room appearance will leave many surprised once they enter the building. 
Combine a trip here withDublin Castle <http://www.dublincastle.ie/> and the 
brilliantDublin Zoo <http://www.dublinzoo.ie/>.

The best place to enjoy a pint of the black stuff and a bit of craic is Grogans
 <http://www.groganspub.ie/>, a shabby old pub just off Grafton Street and 
close to St Stephen’s Green. There’s original art for sale on the walls (the 
owner has a great eye for up-and-coming artists) and great ham and cheese 
toasties to tuck in to. Try not to stay there all evening, as fantastic pubs 
likeKehoes <http://www.louisfitzgerald.com/kehoes>, the Long Hall 
<http://www.visitdublin.com/see-do/details/the-long-hall/51633/#53.341822|-6.265267|16>
 and theStags Head <http://www.louisfitzgerald.com/stagshead> are all within 
striking distance.

Not the easiest of places to find (you have to go through a stationery shop to 
enter) but the Cake Café is well worth the effort. The picturesque courtyard is 
a nice place to sit with a glass of wine, although the mismatched crockery and 
loud tablecloths may seem kitsch. The owners are very serious when it comes to 
the environmental side of the business - the cafe serves up ethically sourced 
coffee and home-baked cakes using only local ingredients. Disposable cutlery 
and napkins are avoided. Lovely people trying to make a difference but not 
allowing their product to suffer for it.

The ground floor range of arts, crafts and gifts at the Dublin branch of 
Kilkenny Shop is excellent, carefully selected and far from the usual tourist 
souvenirs you will find elsewhere. And the first-floor restaurant is a foodie’s 
dream, with a great range of hot foods, cold platters and homemade cakes. Try 
and get a window table to look out across to Trinity College.

South Dublin’s river is the beautiful Dodder, famed for its rich and varied 
wildlife. Along its banks you can spot bats, kingfishers, otters … and, erm, 
the Dodder Rhino. He’s big, bronze, and beautiful. In fact, he’s turned out to 
be one of Dublin’s greatest mysteries. Back in 2002 he appeared overnight, 
without fanfare, within the Dodder’s waters. As luck would have it he’s 
situated very conveniently next to theDropping Well <http://droppingwell.com/> 
(Classon’s Bridge, Milltown) – 2014’s Dublin Bar of the Year, no less – which 
denies all knowledge of how the rhino got there. There’s a lot we don’t know 
about him, but I love this rhino in the river.

Glasnevin Cemetery is about two miles from O’Connell St and is a great place 
to learn about the history of Dublin and Ireland. Guided tours take in the 
graves of the famous and the nameless, to Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera ( 
close to each other in death) and include a performance ofPatrick Pearse’s 
rebellion-inspiring oration <http://www.easter1916.net/oration.htm>. Check out 
the 2014 film by Aoife Kelleher, One Million Dubliners, for more on the 
fascinating stories behind the people buried here.

 Splash out … Powerscourt waterfall, Ireland’s highest, is worth a visit. 
Photograph: Alamy 
For a fabulous day trip, visit the Powerscourt Estate, about 20 miles south of 
the city under theWicklow Mountains 
<http://www.wicklowmountainsnationalpark.ie/>. On the way you could stop off at 
the seaside town of Bray (Dart train from Dublin Connolly, €6.85 return) as we 
did, then jump on a bus to Enniskerry (€2.70) and walk up to Powerscourt House. 
The landscaped gardens are stunning and well worth the entry price. There are 
lots of small, themed gardens – a favourite being the Japanese garden. You can 
also buy a ticket to see Ireland’s highest waterfall for an extra €6, but this 
will involve a four-mile walk from the main estate, or a coach tour to get 
there. The Avoca terrace cafe is a lovely place to grab a coffee and some lunch 
and take in the beauty of the area, overlooking the estate gardens and the 
mountains beyond.
