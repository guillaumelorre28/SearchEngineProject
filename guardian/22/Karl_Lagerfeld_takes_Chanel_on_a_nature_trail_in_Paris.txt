At Chanel <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/chanel>, the show starts long 
before the clothes appear. Karl Lagerfeld’s overture began a few days ahead of 
this collection with the show tickets: simple slabs of eco-friendly plywood 
looking nothing like haute couture’s traditional beribboned and gold-embossed 
invitations.

Once inside the Grand Palais on the day of the show, guests found themselves 
transported from the leaden skies and frenetic streets ofParis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris> to a blissed-out, spa-like stage set, 
with a painted blue sky lit by floodlights and a backdrop of trees in full 
leaf. A minimalist pavilion in slatted wood sat in the centre of a lawn edged 
by paths picked out in yet more pale wood.

The natural idyll was a notable departure from Lagerfeld’s recent Chanel 
shows, which have been staged in aParis street scene

 (October 2015). The presence of the ethical fashion campaignerLivia Firth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/livia-firth-the-fashion-industry-is-so-messed-up-cannes>
 in the seat next to Anna Wintour was another final clue to the theme of this 
collection, which Lagerfeld said later was about fashion and natural resources. 
The set would be recycled immediately after the show, he said.

The setting represented nature at its most chic. The final prop was Cara 
Delevingne, who made a late arrival in the front row cuddling her husky puppy, 
Leo. It was the perfect backdrop for Lagerfeld to apply the skills of his 
couture ateliers to making beautiful clothes out of natural, sustainable 
materials. This summer’s two-tone slingback sandals came not in leather, but in 
environmentally friendly cork. A skirt was woven out of jute, and embroidery 
fashioned from tiny paillettes of wood.

Lagerfeld has touched on the eco theme before, most notably in 2010 when he 
imported a giant iceberg as a centrepiece of a Paris catwalk. That day, 
however, he told reporters that his inspiration was a Swedish ice hotel, rather 
than the melting of the polar ice caps. Lagerfeld is constantly engaged with 
the world around him – last year his shows made reference to French national 
identity, and to modern feminism – but in the end, it is fashion and fashion 
alone that he takes entirely seriously.

The key message of this show was that longerlength straight skirts and cropped 
wide-legged trousers – the same silhouette, in effect – are chic for spring. 
Day looks were streamlined and simple, with jackets cropped at the waist, and 
fabrics stiffened to hold a constant shape. There was an air of tranquillity, 
even beatitude, which had something to do with the notable absence of 
distracting, buy-me accessories – the only handbags were simple pouches slung 
around the waist – and something to do with the languid pace dictated when 
wearing very high platform sandals and very long skirts.

The mood was reflected in the elaborate “Chanel croissant” hairstyle that 
seemed to fuse geisha styling with Scarlett O’Hara. The elongated flicks of 
black eyeliner were an idea taken from Picasso, Lagerfeld said. At the close of 
the show, the screens of the wooden house retracted, revealing 19 rooms with 
two or three models posed in each, a vast and absurdly elegant dolls’ house.

With the Oscars a month away, eveningwear is front of mind at haute couture 
week. Lagerfeld dressed two of the supermodels of the moment,Kendall Jenner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kendall-jenner> and Gigi Hadid, in looks 
designed to catch the eye of red carpet contenders – including, perhaps, Diane 
Kruger and Gwyneth Paltrow, in the front row. Jenner wore a dramatic, 
multi-strapped black goddess gown, while Hadid’s pale gold column dress was 
topped with a shimmering cape to match.
