An exhibition will celebrate the fashion style of Princess Diana, on the 20th 
anniversary of her death. Diana: Her Fashion Story will open at Kensington 
palace, her home for 15 years, on 24 February 2017.

The organisers say in a statement that the exhibition will “bring together an 
extraordinary collection of garments ranging from the glamorous evening gowns 
worn on engagements in the 80s, to the chic Catherine Walker suits that made up 
Diana’s working wardrobe in the 90s”.

The exhibition’s curator, Eleri Lynn, told Vogue 
<http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/kensington-palace-release-details-of-diana-exhibition-dates?utm_medium=Email&utm_source=Editorial-VogueDailyNews&utm_campaign=145286344>
: “Our exhibition explores the story of a young woman who had to quickly learn 
the rules of royal and diplomatic dressing, who in the process put the 
spotlight on the British fashion industry and designers.”

The collection will explore Diana’s “relationship with her favourite 
designers” via some original outfit sketches. Outfits on display will include 
the Victor Edelstein blue velvet dress she worn at the White House where she 
famously danced with John Travolta and the pale pink Emanuel blouse she wore 
for her 1981 engagement portrait by Lord Snowdon. Both Prince Harry and William 
are believed to have given the exhibition their blessing.

As well as the exhibition, Kensington Gardens will be restyled to feature 
flowers and foliage inspired by Diana’s life and style. They will include 
tulips, scented narcissi and white English roses.
