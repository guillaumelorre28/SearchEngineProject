Jodie Taylor came off the bench to score a second‑half winner as England beat 
the Euro 2017 hosts Holland to extend their unbeaten run to 10 games.

It was a scrappy friendly at the 14,500-seat Koning Willem II Stadion in 
Tilburg, which will host the Lionesses’ final Group D match against Portugal 
next summer. However, Toni Duggan, one of seven players from the FA Women’s 
Super League champions, Manchester City, named in the starting side, went close 
after a superb piece of individual skill on 65 minutes. She controlled a long 
ball before cutting back inside the penalty area and drilling a low shot that 
Loes Geurts saved at the near post.

The decisive moment came with 15 minutes left when Arsenal’s Taylor, who has 
struggled with injuries this season and had not played for England since March, 
latched on to a long ball from Jordan Nobbs to lob Geurts from the edge of the 
penalty area.

Neither side had been able to gain the upper hand during a tense first half. 
The Chelsea forward Karen Carney tried to pick out Isobel Christiansen in the 
box but the defence cleared.

At the other end, Lieke Martens and Shanice van de Sanden, the Liverpool 
forward, caused England problems on the counterattack before Renate Janssen’s 
close-range effort was blocked.

Holland, who had enjoyed most of the possession, pressed for an equaliser but 
Sherida Spitse’s effort flew wide before Sippie Folkertsma shot straight at the 
England keeper Karen Bardsley.
