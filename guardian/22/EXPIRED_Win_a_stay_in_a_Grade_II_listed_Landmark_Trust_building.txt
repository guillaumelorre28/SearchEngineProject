Built in 1969 by Peter Aldington, a pioneering modernist architect, Anderton 
House is a Grade-II listed building in Barnstaple, north Devon.

The house is an exceptional example of uncompromisingly modern design. The 
building retains all its contemporary materials and detailing and is furnished 
to evoke the period. Sliding glass doors in the open plan living area make it a 
grandstand for the changing light on the rolling Devon hills.


The Landmark Trust <http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/> is a charity that 
rescues historic buildings and sensitively restores them. By making such rare 
buildings available for self-catering holidays, they can be enjoyed today and 
in future generations.
 The Landmark Trust. 
Landmark has nearly 200 buildings in its care in Britain, Italy, France and 
Belgium. The buildings are rich in history and atmosphere. They include 
everything from castles to cottages and follies to mills, and the creations of 
great architects from Palladio to Pugin.
