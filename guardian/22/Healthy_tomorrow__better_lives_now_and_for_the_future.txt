They are the moments that change our lives forever.

From the first knowledge that we will soon be nurturing a newborn, to facing 
up to bad news in a doctor’s office, it is clear that caring for our health is 
at the centre of our wellbeing.

And at whatever stage we need help, and for whatever reason, we will 
inevitably rely on the latest advances in healthcare technology to get us 
through.

Here are three of the key areas where continued medical innovation is making 
lives better for billions around the globe, now and for the future.

Taking healthcare to heart

At an average 80 beats per minute, that fist-sized muscle we call a heart will 
have beaten more than 3.3 billion times over the course of an 80-year life.

So vital to life is this organ pumping blood around our body that the 
disorders affecting the cardiovascular system are the number one cause of death 
globally.

Australia is no exception, with the various types of cardiovascular disease 
accounting for 30% of all the nation’s deaths at latest figures and one in five 
of us having some form of heart or circulatory condition to manage.

Where cardiovascular disease is listed as the main cause of death, coronary 
heart disease accounts for the greatest proportion of cases at 46%, followed by 
strokes with 19%.

While better health habits and treatments have seen the number of heart 
attacks (or acute myocardial infarction, a subset of coronary heart disease) 
steadily declining since the 1980s, they still accounted for 9286 deaths in 
2012, mostly in older populations.

With improved imaging to aid diagnosis, more minimally-invasive procedures and 
sophisticated patient monitoring, it is increasingly our lifestyles which 
really need to change.

Healthier choices, and coaching through integrated wearable solutions, can 
help reduce associated risk factors to help reduce the significant impact of 
cardiovascular disease in both acute and chronic forms.

A personal approach to cancer care

Cancer in its many different forms is another leading cause of death 
worldwide. In Australia 2012 figures show 484 new cancer diagnoses per 100,000 
people, with 43,039 cancer-related deaths recorded in the same year.

The number of new cases is increasing but with better diagnosis, management 
and treatment plans the number of fatalities per capita is going down. Between 
1994 and 2012 the number of deaths from all cancers came down significantly, by 
2.6 people per 100,000, for a total of 167 deaths per 100,000. The trend is 
projected to continue into the future with an estimated 56,265 deaths from all 
cancers projected for 2025.

The risk for Australian men being diagnosed with some form of cancer before 
turning 85 is one in two, with the most common types being prostate (one in 
seven); bowel (one in 10), lung (one in 13) and melanoma (one in 14).

For women it is one in three, with breast cancer the most common (one in 
eight) followed by bowel (one in 15), lung (one in 23) and melanoma (one in 24).

66% of people diagnosed with cancer in Australia are still alive five years 
later, according to latest figures.

Because each case is different, a trend towards personalised care through 
innovative data-driven solutions in imaging, biopsy, pathology, genomics, 
navigation and monitoring looks set to make this incredibly difficult time in 
life easier into the future.

Nurturing healthy families

The latest developments in fertility, pregnancy and parenting are helping mums 
in the delivery and care of their babies, that most precious and fragile 
population.

Thankfully, infant and child deaths in Australia have more than halved from 
1986 to 2010. This has been driven largely by improvements in neonatal 
intensive care facilities, national childhood immunisation and greater 
awareness of risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

But still, the latest figures from 2010 show there remained 1229 deaths of 
infants under one, with 69% of mortality happening in the risky first 28 days 
after labour. The three leading causes of death are perinatal conditions, like 
complications during pregnancy; congenital abnormalities; and other symptoms 
and abnormal findings including SIDS.

More than 135 million women give birth each year around the globe and 20 
million of them experience some form of pregnancy-related illness afterwards.

Research shows the first 48 hours immediately following a birth is the most 
crucial period for a newborn’s survival, with both mum and baby needing the 
most care at this time to prevent and treat illness.

Data integration and analytics through better ultrasound quality is one way to 
enable continuous monitoring of mother and baby which can be done with 
increasing ease and mobility.

Sharing this information with obstetricians and gynaecologists can help lead 
to better outcomes for growing families.

Looking to a healthier, brighter future for all

As well as looking at these three key areas, the world is facing some serious 
health challenges in the 21st century: from the changing demographics of an 
ageing population, to increasing and unsustainable costs placed on our 
healthcare systems.

But as throughout history, technological change will go with us as we advance, 
to provide solutions that build on innovation upon innovation in the years 
ahead.

So wherever in life we find ourselves, we can look forward to brighter 
healthcare tomorrow.
