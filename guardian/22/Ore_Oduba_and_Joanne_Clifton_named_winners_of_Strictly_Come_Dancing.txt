Oduba and Clifton’s 118 was enough to top the final leaderboard of the series, 
with their rival couples both finishing on 116.


Mac and Mabuse’s record-breaking samba to Magalenha by Sergio Mendes again 
scored 40 points.

It became the first samba to be given full marks in the show’s history when 
the pair performed it for the first time in week 10. Redknapp and Clifton also 
collected 40 for their final dance – an Argentine tango to Tanguera by Sexteto 
Mayor.

Judge Len Goodman, making his final appearance on the show, said: : “I’ll miss 
just turning up and the anticipation of what is going to occur. I will miss 
what I consider the three best judges on television, being close to the band 
and the fabulous singers.

“I think the whole thing is like a big machine with cogs. Every cog has to 
work to make the whole thing happen. You’d miss any one of the cogs because 
that’s what makes Strictly into Strictly … I’m going to miss it all.”

This year’s competition marks the show’s most-watched series in its 12-year 
history.

An average of 11.3 million viewers have tuned in to BBC1’s flagship 
entertainment show on Saturday nights – the highest figure recorded, according 
to figures compiled by the Press Association.
