PolaWalks, Warsaw

Instagram has fuelled our lust for instant travel photos, but this tour draws 
on actual cameras, arming walkers with a vintage Polaroid camera and a pack of 
film as you snap away in the Polish capital. The three-hour tour starts by 
meeting in the old town square and makes its way through some of the city’s key 
sites: the Royal Castle, the Presidential Palace, the University of Warsaw 
Library and its roof gardens and the Świętokrzyski bridge. Led by a local guide 
– and also running in Vienna and Graz – the tour price includes camera loan and 
a pack of colour film from the Impossible Project: the company that took over 
Polaroid when it ceased production of instant film in 2008.

 Go with the flow … a wonderfully curved bridge in futuristic Ijburg. 
Amsterdam may be best known for its picturesque canalways, but one of the most 
interesting areas of the city, right now – from an urban development 
perspective, at least – is Ijburg. This is a collection of manmade islands just 
east of the city, which is currently being developed into a progressive new 
residential district. Led by a tour company specialising in architecture tours 
around the Netherlands (it’s worth checking out the other tours on offer, 
including those exploring the city bybike 
<http://www.architecturetours.nl/Eastern-Docklands-Amsterdam>, or boat 
<http://www.architecturetours.nl/Amsterdam-architecture-boat-tour>), the Ijburg 
tour talks you through the “laboratory for new forms of living” that the area 
has become, with a fascinating range of housing projects created by renowned 
architecture firms. All walks are led by architects.

 Crash, bang, wallop … a tour party at the edge of Tjörnin, and close to the 
Alþingi, which houses Iceland’s parliament 
The Blue Lagoon trip can wait … One of the most dramatic events to happen in 
Iceland’s history (apart from the Eyjafjallajökull eruption) was the 
catastrophic collapse of all three of the country’s banks in 2008 – the third 
largest bankruptcy in history, which caused knock on effects around the world. 
The crash tour (which covers a similar subject matter to London’s ownOccupy 
Tours <http://occupytours.org/>) is led by historian and business journalist 
Magnús Sveinn Helgason <http://grapevine.is/author/magnus-sveinn-helgason/> and 
explores sites that played a role in the crash, explanations of what caused it 
and what happened to those responsible, and the story of the “pots and pans” 
revolution: when thousands took to the streets in protest.

Thomas Karlsson 
Stieg Larsson’s Millennium trilogy – including The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo 
– is among the most popular book series in the world, so you’ve probably heard 
of them, or at least watched the film adaptations. However, this isn’t a 
literary tour for bookish types, rather a chance to put yourself in the 
footsteps of the series’ Scandi-noir characters. The two-hour walk, run by the 
City Museum, takes fans through theSödermalm neighbourhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/04/10-best-ways-enjoy-stockholm-sweden-on-a-budget>
, passing the home of the fictional journalist Mikael Blomkvist, the office of 
Millennium magazine where he works, past Lisbeth Salander’s apartment, as well 
as other locations mentioned in the books and films. The plot is put into a 
wider context, as you learn about the dynamics of contemporary Stockholm and 
the areas that form the backdrop to the action.

 New Belgrade district. Photograph: Vladimir Martinovich 
This tour explores the urban geography of the Serbian capital with a walk 
through the Zemun and New Belgrade districts on the left bank of the Sava 
river. New Belgrade was constructed as a socialist mega-project, with the aim 
of being the perfect city. The tour also takes in the Millenial Tower and Zemun 
Park, which was once the border crossing of the Turkish and Austrian empires. 
It concludes with a stop in the Savamala district, a neighbourhood now known as 
an art and design quarter, though it is also in the midst of its own 
controversial riverside development plan, which carries echoes of the city’s 
past, grandiose urban projects. Still in Belgrade, which runs the tour, also 
offers walks through Savamala and Dorcol as well – taking in galleries, street 
art and clubs.

The creative tour company behind these journeys of discovery offers more than 
just the usual guided walks. Visitors can go on anything from a 
steampunk-inspired trip into Croatia’s science history to a tour through the 
serene woods on the Medvednica mountain outside of the city, where there are 
visits to peaceful pilgrimage spots and abandoned second world war bunkers. 
That’s just the tours: Secret Zagreb also run “quests” that explore the city 
while guests complete challenges and missions, such as the Witch Hunt quest, 
where you learn about the history of city’s witch trials, before a scavenger 
hunt around the upper town area, solving riddles along the way.

 A Coiste tour stops in front of a mural. 
Coiste Irish political tours are among the best ways a visitor can learn about 
how the city’s recent turbulent history has shaped it. Led by political 
ex-prisoners from the republican community, the tour provides a personal oral 
history of the Troubles as well as an attempt at explaining its broader 
context. There are several tours on offer, but one of the most popular is a 
three-hour walk through west Belfast, passing the murals painted along Falls 
Road and ending at Milltown Cemetery, where three of the republicans who died 
during the 1981 hunger strikes are buried. There’s a chance to discuss what 
you’ve learned – over a pint – at the end of the tour.

 Vive la difference … L’Alternative Urbaine shows off another side to Paris. 
Founded to encourage professional and social inclusion in the city, 
L’Alternative Urbaine uses the structure of the city tour business as a means 
to train and support people who have been struggling with long-term 
unemployment or homelessness. The result is friendly tours of the Paris 
neighbourhoods that usually go less explored by tourists, such as a walk 
through “the java suburbs” in the 10th arrondissement, or a walk around the 
13th, learning about the lives of factory workers who lived in the formerly 
industrial areas of the Faubourg Saint-Marcel and Butte aux Cailles.
