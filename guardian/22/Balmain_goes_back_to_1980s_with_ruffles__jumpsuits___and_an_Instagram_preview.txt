You can debut your spring collection the old-fashioned way, in the 
gilt-and-frescoed salon of a grand hotel next to the Paris Opera with a select 
few hundred of the fashion establishment in attendance.

Or you can debut it on social media, giving Kendall Jenner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jun/30/kendall-jenner-instagram-photo-most-liked-history>
 and Gigi Hadid dresses from the new collection to wear to a party the night 
before the show, and letting Jenner post a close-up photo of the two 
supermodels’ bottoms – one in open-weave cobweb knit dress, one in a semi-sheer 
jumpsuit – to her 37.7 million Instagram followers.

 At the Balmain show. 
No prizes for guessing which makes the most impact. By the time the audience 
fought their way through the rock-concert scrum outside Thursday afternoon’s 
catwalk show, the key looks from the show they were about to see had already 
been widely shared on social media.

But it is testament to the sophistication of Balmain’s strategy under designer 
Olivier Rousteing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/20/kardashian-couture-balmain-buzz-olivier-rousteing-fashion-social-media-star>
 that he masterminded the supermodels stealing his show and the following day 
went ahead and staged the show with full pomp and ceremony.

Balmain is a brand which operates at two levels. The collection is expensive, 
and a high profile at fashion week helps to maintain favour with the elite 
world of red carpet fashion, which is controlled by a status-conscious coterie 
of stylists. TheParis fashion week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/paris-fashion-week> show is no longer the 
unveiling of the collection, but essential maintenance of the facade of the 
brand.

Hadid. 
At the other end of the scale, Balmain has a huge following among young 
fashion fans, thanks to Rousteing’s close ties with the new generation of 
supermodels-cum-social media powerhouses, and his body-conscious, ultra 
dressed-up aesthetic, which appeals to a huge fanbase of fashion-obsessed young 
women.

The Balmain formula is straightforwardly hotblooded, and this collection was 
no exception. The look was 1980s Paris cocktail-to-club wear: skintight 
jumpsuits with ankle boots, suede jackets with pencil skirts, flamenco ruffles 
and one-shouldered leotards. No outfit is complete without assertive 
accessories: a 5in wide belt, or long power earrings. Hair was worn in high, 
tight ponytails.

There is little here that is new to the fashion pantheon. The cobweb knit 
dresses recalled the ones with which Julien Macdonald made his name over a 
decade ago; the bandage dresses called to mind the frocks in which Hérve Léger 
dressed an earlier generation of supermodels.

But most of Balmain’s new generation of fans – who will have the chance to buy 
into the brandwhen the Balmain collection for H&M launches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/18/hm-announces-latest-collaboration-with-balmain>
 next month – are too young to remember those references. And while the content 
might not be groundbreaking, the brand-building strategy is leaving the rest of 
the industry standing.
