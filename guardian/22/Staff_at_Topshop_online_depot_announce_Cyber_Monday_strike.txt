Workers at a Topshop online distribution depot have announced plans to strike 
on Cyber Monday, one of the busiest trading days of the year, in a fresh blow to
Sir Philip Green <https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green>.

Just over half of the 200 workers at the depot in Shirley, West Midlands, 
which is operated by Spectrum for Arcadia, a division of logistics company DHL, 
plan to walk out on Monday morning, according to theGMB union

As well as handling online sales on Monday, the depot is likely to be 
processing orders from the Black Friday promotional day.

The strike announcement comes as Green faces calls for assets including his 
£100m yacht to be seized

, the collapsed retail chain he owned for 15 years.

Most workers at the Solihull depot are paid £7.20 an hour, the minimum wage 
for over-25s. David Warwick, an organiser for GMB, said workers wanted the
independently calculated living wage of £8.45

Warwick said: “It’s a disgrace that Sir Philip Green, who holds the purse 
strings on this DHL contract and has enriched himself on the backs of these 
loyal workers, is refusing to put a sensible offer on the table.

“I sincerely hope he takes some time from sailing his luxury yacht to 
reconsider his position and pay his workers enough money for a decent standard 
of living.”

He said there were also concerns about the recruitment of workers on 
short-term contracts for the busy festive period, as they were working on 
controversial “flex” arrangements, which meant they could find themselves 
working longer or shorter days with little notice.

“These contracts affect two groups in a detrimental way,” Warwick said. “Those 
on the flex contract, who may only get notified of their hours on the day, and 
also the core staff, who used to be able to volunteer for overtime and boost 
their income at this time of year.”

A spokesperson for DHL Supply Chain said: “We are disappointed that the GMB 
has announced its intention to hold industrial action. We believe our offer to 
be reasonable in the current economic climate.

“Detailed contingency plans are in place and we are confident that there will 
be no disruption to service. We urge the GMB to return to the negotiating table 
to meet with us to resolve this matter at the earliest opportunity.”

Arcadia was unavailable for comment.
