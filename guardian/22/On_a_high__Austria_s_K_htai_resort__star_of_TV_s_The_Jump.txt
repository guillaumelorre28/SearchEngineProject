Er, where?


Drive 35km south-west from Innsbruck airport and you soon climb to one of 
Austria’s highest ski villages. At 2,020 metres, little Kühtai sits in a bowl 
between the Stubain and Ötztal mountains, above the treeline. For three years 
now, it’s been the modest star of Channel 4’s celebrity challenge The Jump, 
which returned on 31 January.

Why try it?


Kühtai is very cute, with traditional Alpine-style hotels at the foot of the 
slopes. High altitude gives it an enviable snow record: it’s more or less 
guaranteed until late April. The village, used mainly by Austrian and German 
families, has a relaxed, intimate atmosphere, and the mountains offer space and 
openness. Lift passes include neighbouring Hochötz, linked by a free bus: its 
sheltered pistes can be a blessing if the weather turns nasty.

The slopes really are on the doorstep, with many gliding into the snow-covered 
main street. There are a couple of novice areas with magic carpets and a few 
blues to work towards, but it’s intermediates who get the most out of Kühtai. 
Almost half of the pistes are red; the KPark terrain park includes a superpipe 
and a boardercross. Children have their own snowpark, with jumps and rails to 
play on. Nervous beginners can take heart from the fact that those plentiful 
red runs are very wide and well-groomed.

The ski area is served by four quad chairlifts and a cable car. There’s 
extensive off-piste, and the resort offers good ski touring. There’s 
night-skiing Wednesdays and Saturdays, popular among Innsbruckers taking 
advantage of the free ski bus.

And apart from skiing?


Many of the hotels have pools and spas, which is where you’ll find a large 
portion of visitors in the late afternoon. There’s a 2.5km toboggan run, which 
is floodlit at night and starts at theGraf Ferdinand Haus 
<http://graf-ferdinand.at/> hut, which has sledges for hire. If you don’t fancy 
the hour-long walk uphill, there’s a toboggan taxi available from 4.30pm 
onwards (minimum eight people, €4 each). Cross-country skiers can try the 11km 
of trails, and there’s peaceful winter walking and snowshoeing, plus a dinky 
ice rink by Hotel Jagdschloss.

Après any good?

You’re spoilt for choice – if you want a jolly time howling to cheesy Austrian 
pop. There’s Zeitlos Schirmbar, run byHotel Edelweiss 
<http://www.edelweiss-kuehtai.at/>, where everyone crams into a little wooden 
hut when it’s chilly. It’s similarly lively at tentedLoisl’s Schirm 
<https://www.facebook.com/LoislsSchirm> near the ski jump, and Dorfstadl 
<http://www.dorfstadl.at/> gets raucous on Wednesdays, when there’s live music.

but bear in mind indoor smoking is allowed at all three. There’s a disco, Kaos, 
from 11pm atHotel Tyrol <http://hotel-tyrol-kuehtai.at/>.
