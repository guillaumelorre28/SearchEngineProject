The brief but colourful parliamentary career of the Tory Louise Mensch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/louise-mensch> has formally ended with a 
bizarre tradition.

Because MPs cannot resign in the conventional sense, Mensch had to accept a 
"paid office of the Crown", a new job that disqualified her from membership of 
the Commons.

The chancellor, George Osborne, has appointed her to be steward and bailiff of 
the Manor of Northstead, one of the two posts that allow MPs to leave the 
Commons.

The job is a sinecure, with no actual responsibilities â€“ the manor house 
itself is under a lake near Scarborough.

The previous holder of the post was Labour's Sir Peter Soulsby, who quit the 
Commons to fight and win Leicester's mayoral election

 last year.

The other position to which MPs seeking to resign can be appointed is crown 
steward and bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds (Stoke, Desborough and Burnham).

The posts are filled on an alternate basis, so the next MP to leave will be 
given that role by the chancellor.

Mensch's decision to stand down to move to New York with her family

 will provide David Cameron with a difficult byelection contest in the marginal 
Corby seat.

The author, who writes fiction under her maiden name Louise Bagshawe, won the 
constituency from Labour in 2010 with a majority of 1,951.

But polling by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft suggested Labour had a 15-point 
lead in the contest, a swing that, if repeated nationally, would result in Ed 
Miliband taking the keys to 10 Downing Street.

The Conservatives dismissed an internet rumour that the former England cricket 
captain Andrew Strauss could take advantage ofthe free time he now has available

 to contest the seat for the Tories.

A source said: "We are not aware of any truth in it."
