I’ve recently seen a lot about cargo shorts in the news. What’s going on?

Ding dong merrily on high, it’s because they have finally been banned by 
international law! At long last, the European court of human rights has decreed 
that these hideous, multi-pocketed monstrosities contravene my human rights by 
appearing in my line of vision on every third man in the street in the summer 
months. From today, there will be a cargo shorts amnesty. Everyone must hand in 
their disgusting shorts at a designated safe space; failure to do so will 
result in offenders having to walk around town wearing a scarlet sign that 
says: “Hi! I’m a straight guy who can’t accept the 90s are over. I shop at Old 
Navy, you know.” Personally, I think this is a rather odd punishment, given 
that wearers of these shorts essentially wear that sign every day, ba boom boom 
tish.

Anyway, sadly, I jest; this has not happened. Rather, a journalist named 
Nicole Hong wrote an article about the perfectly obvious awfulness of these 
shorts <http://www.theonion.com/graphic/heterosexual-mens-fashion-10288> and 
men rose up as one and gave a collective howl of fury. The male employees at 
the Wall Street Journal all came in wearing their beloved cargo shorts to 
protest against Hong’s piece. Film director Judd Apatow tweeted that women’s 
dislike of men’s cargo shorts proves “you don’t understand us”. In fact, it’s 
because women understand men all too well. A man who wears cargos is a man who 
is refusing to embrace maturity, as proved by the collective temper tantrum 
these chaps had when one woman questioned the merits of their stupid shorts.

There are two conclusions to draw here. First, it’s adorable how outraged men 
(#yesliterallyallmen) get when someone criticises one piece of their clothing, 
given that women are told every single goddamn day how they are supposed to 
dress. Heck, fashion magazines tell women to throw out their entire wardrobes 
every six months. Do women cry about it? No, because they’re adults, and they 
know – and I realise this is ironic coming from me, given that the whole point 
of this column is ostensibly to tell people what to wear – it doesn’t really 
matter. Someone doesn’t like your clothes? Oh well, walk it off! Seeing these 
men willing to die on the hill of their cargo shorts is like watching people 
spend all day quarreling on the internet, unable to accept that someone has a 
different point of view to them. It reflects a deeply narcissistic belief that 
not only should everyone think the same way as them, but that they can make 
them do so.

So, here is the definitive ruling on cargo shorts, chaps. They are – clearly, 
objectively, obviously – fugly. You know this, of course, given that your only 
real argument in defence of them is that they allow you to store your mobile 
close to your kneecap. And yet you want to keep wearing them. Fine, no one is 
going to arrest you. But we will think you look terrible in them, and no amount 
of whingeing will change that. Consider it your burden. Store it one of the 17 
pockets on your shorts.

Wait, Seth Rogen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/seth-rogen> and Katherine 
Heigl are still fighting? Seriously?
Tara, by email

Yes, the seminal Knocked Up civil war is still raging, eight years after it 
began, meaning it has now lasted twice as long as the first world war.

To recap, in 2008 – yes, 2008 – Heigl said in an interview that the Judd 
Apatow film, in which she co-starred with Rogen, was “a little sexist”. “The 
movie paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the 
men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,” she said, absolutely correctly.

Obviously, Apatow and Rogen considered this point of view seriously and 
calmly, accepting that maybe a woman would have a different – more valid, even 
– perspective on sexism to them. Kidding! Nope, they reacted like men whose 
cargo shorts had just been criticised.

“[You’d think] at some point I’ll get a call saying: ‘Sorry, I was tired.’ But 
that call never came,” Apatow said, all more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger.

“It’s not like we’re the only people she said some batshit crazy things about. 
That’s kind of her bag,” added Rogen. Because only fatigue and being “batshit 
crazy” would make someone accuse an Apatow film of being sexist.

This whole farrago essentially destroyed Heigl’s career. Yes, she is 
supposedly a little difficult on set, but that trait doesn’t seem to have 
harmed, say,Jared Leto 
<http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/news/a39710/jared-leto-joker-method-acting/>
. Anyway, earlier this year, Heiglmade some kind of groveling apology 
<http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/08/katherine-heigl-should-not-apologize-to-rogen.html>
 for daring to voice her opinion. Rogen added last week: “I respect that maybe 
she realises it has hurt her career,” he said, like a teacher solemnly pleased 
a naughty toddler has learned her lesson.

The real takeaway from this is that, despite the fears of a million manboys 
who thought anall-female Ghostbusters meant Hollywood was being taken over by 
the feminazis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/26/kristen-wiig-bummed-out-by-ghostbusters-backlash>
, the movie business remains a place where a woman’s career will be destroyed 
if she complains that a sexist film is sexist. As writer Sady Doyle tweeted: “I 
mean, Seth Rogen made a comedy so terrible that it almost caused a war with 
North Korea, but God forbid HE apologise for anything.” Yeah, but war is cool. 
Telling men they’re a bit sexist? That hurts their feelings! Not as much as 
telling them their shorts are bad, but it’s up there.
