This season you are encouraged to treat your eyelids as dainty little 
canvases. Inspired by Dior and Fendi, where models’ eyes weren’t just lined 
with cornflower blue and slashes of pink but decorated as if by a delighted art 
student. Play with coloured eyeliners and MAC’s brilliant pigments to find a 
design that makes you feel beautiful.
