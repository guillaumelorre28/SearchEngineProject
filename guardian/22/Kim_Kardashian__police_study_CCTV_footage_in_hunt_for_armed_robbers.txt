French investigators are examining footage from surveillance cameras to try to 
identify five armed men who are still on the run afterrobbing the reality TV 
star Kim Kardashian West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/kim-kardashian-west-gunpoint-robbery-manhunt-paris>
 of an estimated €10m (£8.8m) in jewellery in one of the country’s biggest 
heists in decades.


Kardashian West <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian> was 
in Paris for fashion week when a gang of masked men wearing jackets marked 
“police” entered the luxury apartment building where she was staying at 2.30am 
on Monday.

Three men tied up the receptionist downstairs and stood guard by the door. The 
two others went up to Kardashian West’s bedroom, where she was lying down. They 
held a gun to her head, tied her up in the bathroom and escaped with a vast 
haul of jewels thought to include her €3.5m wedding ring.

The attack lasted only six minutes before the men escaped on bicycles.

Kardashian West’s stylist, who had hidden in a bedroom during the attack, 
untied Kardashian West and raised the alarm.

Crucially, Kardashian West’s personal bodyguard, Pascal Duvier, who had 
trailed her to all events during fashion week, was not present during the 
attack. Kardashian West had “loaned” him to one of her sisters who had gone out 
to a nearbyParis <https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris> nightclub. Called by 
the stylist during the attack, the bodyguard reportedly rushed to the scene, 
arriving minutes after the gang had fled.

The fact that the bodyguard was not present when the gang struck has raised 
speculation in Paris that the thieves had either been trailing and observing 
her extremely closely, or they had been tipped off by someone within her 
entourage that Duvier was not present.

Paris prosecutors declined to comment on whether the robbers might have 
received help from inside her circle.

Kardashian West reportedly begged the armed thieves not to kill her because 
she had children, according to the celebrity site TMZ.

The attack happened at an exclusive, private apartment building known as a “no 
address” site, where celebrities visiting Paris often rent sumptuous suites. 
The main door to the street was unmarked, giving the guests privacy, but the 
site was thought to have far less security protection than the city’s luxury 
hotels. The rest of the Kardashian family were staying at a luxury hotel.

Karl Lagerfeld ticked off Kardashian West on Tuesday for flaunting her wealth 
and for staying in that type of building.

 “You cannot display your wealth and then be surprised that some people want 
to share it with you,” the fashion designer told Agence France-Presse after his 
Chanel show.

Lagerfeld had written Kardashian West a note on Monday saying: “Dearest Kim, 
we are all with you”, but he criticised her for showing off her jewellery to 
her 100 million-plus social media followers. “If you’re that famous and you put 
all your jewellery on the net, you go to hotels where nobody can come near to 
the room,” he said.

, the French actor and director who shot to fame with the French film La Haine, 
sparked controversy on social media after the robbery and Kardashian West’s 
swift return to the US by tweeting: “Proud to be Parisian” and refusing to 
delete it.

 in France, tweeted after the heist: “Nine million euros in jewellery in her 
bedroom? The redistribution of riches is urgent. It has seemingly begun.” He 
then deleted the tweet, saying he agreed with the criticism he had attracted.

The Kardashian West robbery was the biggest jewellery theft from an individual 
inFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> for more than 20 years.

Johanna Primevert, the chief spokeswoman for the Paris police departmentsaid 
it was “very, very rare” in the city for robbers to pose as police and target a 
private apartment.

Jeanne d’Hauteserre, the mayor of Paris’s 8th arrondissement, where the attack 
took place, told BFMTV she suspected Kardashian had either been followed or 
there had been some kind of tipoff that led to the attack.
