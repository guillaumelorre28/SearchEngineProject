When Kavya Menon first brought up the idea of installing a sanitary pad 
dispenser in the girls’ bathroom of Calicut Medical College, fellow students 
said she shouldn’t really discuss such matters openly at a student union 
meeting, where boys were present. “It was strange. I mean, we’re supposed to 
become doctors yet some people would say, ‘How can you talk about this here?’”

For Menon, the sanitary pad dispenser was a necessity: “If you start your 
period in the middle of the day and you can’t find a pad, you have to go all 
the way to the hostel, which is at least a 10-minute walk away. There’s no time 
between classes to go there.”

Periods are only ever mentioned in hushed tones, Menon said. “You can’t raise 
your hand in class and tell your professor you need to leave because of period 
pain, for example. You have to be discreet.”

She eventually convinced her fellow students that the dispenser was a worthy 
expense for the college. But still, she found she couldn’t talk openly about 
her period when there were boys around.

“We learn about menstruation and yet we can’t talk about it. Even I was 
hesitant to talk about it openly at first, but soon I realised that when I did, 
the boys were supportive. Sometimes I think we women impose this secrecy about 
periods on ourselves.”

At the college’s literary club, a group of core members decided to launch a 
menstruation-themed haiku and poetry competition to markInternational Women’s 
Day

 earlier this year.

But not all the club’s members were keen. Among those initially resistant was 
Maiz Wafy, a second-year male student. “This is a taboo subject,” he said. “It 
is not comfortable for me. In my family, the women discussed this among 
themselves – I was never really exposed to it. Many of the students at the 
college are from conservative backgrounds, and I didn’t know if it would be 
offensive to them. I said that we didn’t need to be so open about this topic. I 
thought – would anyone write about this?”

But as the entries started to pour in and he read the poems, Wafy changed his 
mind. “Now I don’t think it should be a taboo. I still don’t think we should be 
very open about it, but I am OK with talking about it.”

Banished for menstruating: the Indian women isolated while they bleed |

The competition was publicised through social media and entries arrived from 
across the country. “We started circulating those on WhatsApp and Facebook, and 
then people from our college started writing in too,” said Menon.

Sreya Salim compiled the haikus and poems into a magazine. “We got 87 
entries,” she said. “We chose to have a haiku competition because some people 
don’t feel comfortable writing entire essays about it. This way it doesn’t take 
people too long to write something.

“It has had a such a big impact. When I was young, I was ashamed to talk about 
it. Most girlsweren’t allowed into the temple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/13/menstruation-temples-mosques-india-ban-women>
 or to do certain things when they were on their periods. One of my friends, 
who comes from a very orthodox family, was confined to a room and no one would 
touch her, or eat with her while she was on.

“When you’re on your period, you’re constantly checking your dress for stains. 
Even though it’s happening to our bodies, it’s something that we can’t speak 
about.”

Locked in a room, food served in turns. 
Get out, they warned, 
For it seemed we ruined godly places! 
Funny, I said, 
For we bleed to give a life.

Menon said she was given gold when she got her first period. “In Kerala we 
have a ceremony called valayakuttiyay, which means, ‘You became a big girl.’ 
It’s a coming of age ceremony to tell everyone in the community that the girl 
is now ready for marriage. On the day, you wear new clothes, and all your 
family members and community are there. It’s quite embarrassing, really. I 
guess it’s OK as long as they don’t isolate you after that.”

Menstrual health is a serious issue for the 355 million women of reproductive

<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-cant-afford-sanitary-napkins-reveals-study/articleshow/7344998.cms>
, and tampons are rare. For the rest of India’s menstruating women, a reusable 
rag is the only option.

A lack of toilets, and taboos that surround hanging washed underwear outdoors, 
mean sanitation during periods is poor. One study says that roughly20% of girls 
aged 12-18 drop out of school 
<http://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/NewsDetail/index/7/7836/Menstruation-Keeps-Girls-From-School-In-India-20-Drop-Out-Reaching-Puberty>
because of menstruation-related issues.

“I’ve seen patients who don’t know basic details about menstrual hygiene,” 
said Salim, who works in hospital wards as part of her medical studies. “They 
come from poor families, they use dirty rags instead of sanitary napkins – they 
have no idea how to dispose of them correctly. It’s a real shame to see.”


For the students of Calicut Medical College, reading poems about menstruation 
is one small step towards erasing the taboo. “The girls definitely seem to have 
gained confidence to discuss it publicly now,” said Wafy. “The boys still don’t 
talk about it properly. We discuss the language, the structure of the poems. 
The focus point is not on the issue of menstruation, but how the writer has 
written about it.”

“She fed him, bathed him, she loved him.
Now he lies in there motionless, draped in white cloth.
She must not touch him, they say.
She is bleeding.”

For Menon, the haikus and poems have already done a lot to change attitudes on 
campus. “We’re budding doctors, so if we don’t talk about this, who will?” she 
said. “It only takes a small number of people willing to break a taboo, and 
then the others will follow.”
