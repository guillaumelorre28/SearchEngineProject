Nairo Quintana regained the red jersey at the Vuelta a España 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/vuelta-a-espana> after he opened up a 
58-second lead on Great Britain’s Chris Froome during a dramatic victory in 
stage 10.

The Colombian Quintana (Movistar) showed his renowned climbing skills on the 
188.7km haul from Lugones to Lagos de Covadonga to pass the long-time stage 
leader Robert Gesink (Lotto NL Jumbo) with 2.5km remaining.

Gesink finished second, 24sec back, with Froome (Team Sky) a further second 
down, as the previous race leader David de la Cruz lost 3min 15sec to Quintana.

Third-placed Froome, who is one second behind Alejandro Valverde (Movistar), 
is now almost a minute down on Quintana heading into the second week of the 
Vuelta.

It could have been worse for Froome as he lost contact with 10km left as 
general classification rivals Quintana and Alberto Contador (Tinkoff) surged up 
the special category climb to the Lagos de Covadonga.

But the Tour de France winner rediscovered his rhythm and surged past Contador 
and others, and he was only edged out on the line by Gesink.

Movistar, however, are in good shape going into the Vuelta’s first rest day on 
Tuesday.

“It was a day for the team and for Nairo,” Movistar’s Daniel Moreno Fernández 
told Eurosport. “That sort of category of climbs suits him, so many rhythm 
changes from the beginning to the end. At first Froome couldn’t follow and the 
rhythm Nairo set out there was amazing. He just went off and did it alone, he’s 
extremely strong. It looks much better for us than it was in the Tour de 
France.”
