Thanks for your questions, and for your passion. I still believe that books 
can change the world, and that my job is to communicate as honestly and 
humorously as possible.

One serious question: can you say more about what you mean by “we’ve only had 
one third of a feminist revolution”?

One frivolous one: would Isadora Wing still aspire to ziplessness today...

Until women are represented in politics according to their numbers in the 
population, we do not have a feminist revolution.Women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> in politics are still a 
minority, women rulers of corporations are few and far between. We do not have 
complete equality between the genders in power or politics. I will be very 
curious to see the world when that has changed, but I probably won't be here.

Do you think a generation of children were negatively affected by DeBeauvoius,

despised all aspects of domesticity?

Most of the women you mention did not despise all aspects of domesticity - nor 
do I. Books don't ruin children's lives. Not enough people read books to have 
the effect you describe. If anything, books open minds and promote choice.

I wonder if you might tell us your story of how you became a writer. Any life

critical to success/constructive feedback? Literary agent, editor, life partner?

I was lucky to have some writers in my life who encouraged me and criticised 
my work lovingly. Some of them were poets: Robert Pack, Mark Strand, Stanley 
Kunitz. Novelists: Henry Miller, John Updike and others. Early on I had a 
terrific editor called Aaron Asher who published my first two books of poetry, 
rejected my first novel which was written from a male point of view. He wanted 
me to write a novel from the point of view of the voice in my poems - that 
novel became Fear of Flying. Bless him.

A lot of online dating profiles will include caveats of “no casual hookups”, 
implicating interest in “serious” or “committed” sustained relationships only. 
Do you think that the notions of these this-or-that ultimatums are having an 
adverse affect on how people approach dating, and if so, what attitudes might 
you propound to redress the restrictions that people are putting on themselves 
and others?

I think most people when they develop some maturity want relationships with 
human beings. I'm reluctant to comment on hookup sites because my experience of 
them is limited. The people I know would rather have sex with a person that a 
computer.

It comes as no surprise to me that after centuries of oppression, men are

change. In fact, that's why I write.

Probably adolescent young men are the main target for pornography. They're 
very curious and very horny. I don't think we should judge them too harshly. 
When your hormones are in flux, there are many things you want to see on the 
internet. And believe me, it's there. But as life goes on, I think one becomes 
less interested in this stuff. People want real relationships. I imagine that 
the sort of men who think masturbating to the internet is better than a real 
woman have many other psychological problems. Maybe we should send them to 
doctors rather than the internet. Most men probably outgrow this phase.

People always want to see social catastrophe in new technological inventions - 
maybe they're just not that important. In my experience most young men prefer 
girls to the internet, and eventually discover that. I'm always surprised by 
people who want to pass laws against the internet, the cellphone, the fax 
machine, for fear they will bring down western civilisation. Perhaps we should 
spend our time working on more important issues, like the pandemic of violence 
against women. We see women being kidnapped, raped over and over again in war. 
I think all of this went on before the internet. Blaming these things on 
technology may well be a dodge from looking at them honestly. I really do think 
that. We have to understand the psychology of men who abuse women - it's too 
easy to blame it on new inventions.

Anthony Burgess was your friend and neighbour. How do you remember him? How 
important was he as an influence on your writing?

He was my friend, not my neighbour. We were brought together by our 
translators, Georges Belmonde and Hortense Chabrer. I thought Burgess was a 
brilliant writer who also was a composer and wrote music every day. He was an 
amazing scribomaniac. He was always writing, either music or literature. He 
absolutely was not happy unless he was writing. He was extremely kind to me as 
a mentor, and loved my books as I loved his. So it was a mutually nurturing 
relationship.

He greatly encouraged me when I was writing Fanny, Being The True History of 
Fanny Hackabout-Jones - he had written a brilliant novel about Shakespeare, 
Nothing Like the Sun, which is a kind of model of the historical novel. He 
tries to imagine Shakespeare's life as he was writing the sonnets, and he 
invents or intuits a rivalry between a male and female lover. He uses the 
sonnets as a way of talking about Shakespeare's sexuality. As we know, the 
Elizabethans experimented with male love affairs and Burgess tried to 
understand the psychology of the Elizabethans. He inspired me in the way he 
understood the historical novel. Though he's most known for Clockwork Orange, 
because of the movie, I much prefer his novel about Shakespeare.

I am often wondering: What is the price for being a writer? An artist? A 
celebrity?

It hasbeen described all over literature and arts, as sympathy for the Devil, 
leaving family behind, being half-a-person, a split personality, the like of a 
God, loosing your saneity or others…

Was has your price been – what is your thought on this?

Being a writer is hard work, and the hardest part of it is you're working all 
alone, and nobody is applauding at the end of a paragraph. You have to be very 
self-motivated, and willing to rewrite endlessly, because life is pretty 
chaotic and to make a story out of it requires discipline. I believe you have 
to write the truth out of your own heart, but that does not mean everything is 
literally something you experience. Many people think women have no 
imaginations, and can only write exactly what they experience.

Being a celebrity is a completely different gig. The Kardashian family 
exemplify this. Mostly it's about getting free designer clothes for talking 
about how hard it is to get pregnant, or why you did a sex tape in your youth. 
Reality TV has impacted all our ideas of fame, so now we are all supposed to be 
Kardashians. Writers aren't real celebrities in my opinion - when a book comes 
out, for a limited period of time people recognise you at the train station, 
and mostly in my life it's been nice. People come up and say: "I love your 
books! Goodbye." That's the kind of celebrity a writer has. It's nothing like 
being Daniel Craig, or Jennifer Lawrence. These people can literally not cross 
the street, and I feel great empathy for them.

What are your thoughts on the Fifty Shades of Gray books? And why do you think 
they are so successful?

Why do people keep asking me about that abysmal drivel! Sometimes I think the 
people who ask me about it have never read either my books or James's books. 
They have really nothing in common. Maybe it's successful because nobody read 
The Story of O, or Justine and Juliette by the Marquis de Sade. Fifty Shades is 
a Cinderella story about a woman who promises submission in exchange for money. 
This is not new. We might say that women have been doing that for ages, but it 
doesn't turn me on.

I think there's a great innocence about pornography. I think a lot of people 
have never read some of the great pornography, like Memoirs of a Woman of 
Pleasure by John Cleeland, who was an 18th-century writer who impersonated a 
happy, jolly prostitute. Now, I don't think there were many happy jolly 
prostitutes in the 18th century. I think most of them were gin-soaked and ill, 
probably with many venereal diseases. Look at Hogarth's etchings. But the myth 
of the happy prostitute seems to have lingered. It's a case of trying to prove 
to people that women are happy in oppression. Newsflash: they aren't. 
Pornography is a form of mythology - it should be taken with a pinch of salt. 
Men want to believe that women are happy being receptacles - we aren't. It's a 
mythology, it's male wish fulfilment. Probably as women get freer and freer 
that kind of pornography will disappear.

Dear Erica, firstly I love your books and found their espousal of liberation 
very helpful as a young repressed Northern Irish girl :) Secondly, how do you 
feel your love of 18th Century literature impacts on your depiction of the 
feminist heroes in your modern novels?

Thank you for loving my books. I still believe that books can inspire people 
to live their lives with more freedom. Most of us find change very hard, and 
books do inspire change.

18th century literature means a lot to me because it comes from a period when 
Europeans were discovering the rights of man, and of woman. It's also a time of 
satire and I love satire, so maybe my study of the 18th century inspired the 
humour and satire in my books. The Romans used to say that the satirists lash 
the world to bring it to its senses, and I do believe that remains true, that 
if you can be deeply funny, you can wake people up from their indifference. And 
it's a great tool for waking up the reader. I think one of the first writers I 
loved was Oscar Wilde was because of his satire, and George Bernard Shaw, so 
I've always been drawn to that.

'The great thing about getting older is that you no longer worry about 
decrepitude'

Pooka MacPhellimey <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15514984> asks:

Surely old age is the real fear, as death’s blessing is zero awareness? Given 
the inevitability of decrepitude, should the authentic choice of a character 
who likes to keep it real, be increasing desperation or philosophical surrender?

The great thing about getting older is that you no longer worry about 
decrepitude. Also, as your vision gets worse, it's harder to see yourself in 
the mirror.

I do think that some people die more gracefully than others. My own mother who 
was 101 seemed quite ready to depart; my father who was 93 raged against the 
dying of the light. Maybe this is the choice. Dylan Thomas writes that to his 
father, rage against the dying of the light - there's just different ways that 
people approach it.

I've seen a lot of people age gracefully, and really feel that they'd done 
what they needed to do in their lives. It's quite inspiring when you see that 
but not everyone can do that. Because my heroine is an actress, she knows as 
most people in the theatre know, that her appearance is all important to her 
getting work, so not everybody has that obsession - it really has to do with 
the profession you're in. If you're a computer programmer nobody cares what you 
look like. If you're in the public eye, you have to do a certain amount of 
cleaning up... I would say to my assistant when I leave the house: now I have 
to impersonate a famous author.

'I have never been on Tinder'

clareyesno <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13950903> asks:

What do you make of Tinder?

More broadly, can sex ever really be “no strings attached”?
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15515231> Guardian contributor
EricaJong  <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15515231> 27 October 
2015 1:20pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/62210652> 
I have never been on Tinder. Friends have talked to me about it, and said that 
they tried to find lovers on there, but I swear to God, I can't remember what 
they said. I think when you're very young you get excited about new 
technologies and you think they'll change the world, and then you try them, and 
I'm very dubious that new technologies will change the world. It seems to be if 
you're 15, you might say oooh Tinder! How great! But if you're a little older 
than that, perhaps not. Also, everybody is asking these questions about 
approving or disapproving - maybe this judgemental thing is the worst thing 
we've done with the internet. We're supposed to take a political position on 
these apps, that probably won't exist tomorrow. They're not here forever. 
They're not like the Himalayas. Apps go in, and apps go out.

If you read my book, you realise that the online dating stuff in my book is 
hilarious satire - no-one could read that book and think that I think that 
online dating is the solution to our problems. My heroine meets a selection of 
fetishists, and fools, who are quite disappointing.

I would say it depends on the person, regarding no strings attached sex. 
Usually the people I like are interested in human interaction more than the old 
in-out.

It's great to be namechecked in a Bob Dylan song. Do I think he's a feminist - 
I've absolutely no idea, I've never met him. I was pleased, I love music, and 
music has always been very important so I was happy to be mentioned. Did it 
change my life? I don't think so.

He's a great talent. Once, when I was on a book tour I saw an exhibition of 
his paintings and I was very impressed - often, multiple talents go together.

Post your questions for Erica Jong

Published in 1973, Erica Jong’s Fear of Flying was a sensation: a book about a 
woman who longs for sex that isn’t freighted with motherhood or power games, 
but which is a satisfying – even meaningless – experience for both men and 
women. She coined the popular term “zipless fuck” to describe this 
uncomplicated kind of sex, and the book’s liberated but complex heroine, 
Isadora Wing, was embraced by feminists; it sold 27m copies worldwide.

Jong revisited Wing twice more, and she appears again in her new novel, Fear 
of Dying 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/14/fear-of-dying-erica-jong-review-novel>
. Times have changed (there’s an adultery website, zipless.com), but the 
desires remain the same. Her main protagonist is now Vanessa Wonderman, a 
60-year-old actor refusing to let go of her sexual appetite, and having plastic 
surgery to keep herself in the game – it lays bare our prejudices about ageing, 
and anxieties about death.

With the book out this month, Erica is joining us to answer your questions 
about it and anything else in her career, in a live webchat. It starts from 1pm 
BST onwards on Tuesday 27 October – post your questions for her in the comments 
below, and she’ll answer as many as possible.

Until women are represented in politics according to their numbers in the 
population, we do not have a feminist revolution.Women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> in politics are still a 
minority, women rulers of corporations are few and far between. We do not have 
complete equality between the genders in power or politics. I will be very 
curious to see the world when that has changed, but I probably won't be here.

Most of the women you mention did not despise all aspects of domesticity - nor 
do I. Books don't ruin children's lives. Not enough people read books to have 
the effect you describe. If anything, books open minds and promote choice.

I was lucky to have some writers in my life who encouraged me and criticised 
my work lovingly. Some of them were poets: Robert Pack, Mark Strand, Stanley 
Kunitz. Novelists: Henry Miller, John Updike and others. Early on I had a 
terrific editor called Aaron Asher who published my first two books of poetry, 
rejected my first novel which was written from a male point of view. He wanted 
me to write a novel from the point of view of the voice in my poems - that 
novel became Fear of Flying. Bless him.

A lot of online dating profiles will include caveats of “no casual hookups”, 
implicating interest in “serious” or “committed” sustained relationships only. 
Do you think that the notions of these this-or-that ultimatums are having an 
adverse affect on how people approach dating, and if so, what attitudes might 
you propound to redress the restrictions that people are putting on themselves 
and others?

I think most people when they develop some maturity want relationships with 
human beings. I'm reluctant to comment on hookup sites because my experience of 
them is limited. The people I know would rather have sex with a person that a 
computer.

Probably adolescent young men are the main target for pornography. They're 
very curious and very horny. I don't think we should judge them too harshly. 
When your hormones are in flux, there are many things you want to see on the 
internet. And believe me, it's there. But as life goes on, I think one becomes 
less interested in this stuff. People want real relationships. I imagine that 
the sort of men who think masturbating to the internet is better than a real 
woman have many other psychological problems. Maybe we should send them to 
doctors rather than the internet. Most men probably outgrow this phase.

People always want to see social catastrophe in new technological inventions - 
maybe they're just not that important. In my experience most young men prefer 
girls to the internet, and eventually discover that. I'm always surprised by 
people who want to pass laws against the internet, the cellphone, the fax 
machine, for fear they will bring down western civilisation. Perhaps we should 
spend our time working on more important issues, like the pandemic of violence 
against women. We see women being kidnapped, raped over and over again in war. 
I think all of this went on before the internet. Blaming these things on 
technology may well be a dodge from looking at them honestly. I really do think 
that. We have to understand the psychology of men who abuse women - it's too 
easy to blame it on new inventions.

Anthony Burgess was your friend and neighbour. How do you remember him? How 
important was he as an influence on your writing?

EricaJong  <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15515231> 27 October 
2015 1:51pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/62213009> 
He was my friend, not my neighbour. We were brought together by our 
translators, Georges Belmonde and Hortense Chabrer. I thought Burgess was a 
brilliant writer who also was a composer and wrote music every day. He was an 
amazing scribomaniac. He was always writing, either music or literature. He 
absolutely was not happy unless he was writing. He was extremely kind to me as 
a mentor, and loved my books as I loved his. So it was a mutually nurturing 
relationship.

He greatly encouraged me when I was writing Fanny, Being The True History of 
Fanny Hackabout-Jones - he had written a brilliant novel about Shakespeare, 
Nothing Like the Sun, which is a kind of model of the historical novel. He 
tries to imagine Shakespeare's life as he was writing the sonnets, and he 
invents or intuits a rivalry between a male and female lover. He uses the 
sonnets as a way of talking about Shakespeare's sexuality. As we know, the 
Elizabethans experimented with male love affairs and Burgess tried to 
understand the psychology of the Elizabethans. He inspired me in the way he 
understood the historical novel. Though he's most known for Clockwork Orange, 
because of the movie, I much prefer his novel about Shakespeare.

I am often wondering: What is the price for being a writer? An artist? A 
celebrity?

It hasbeen described all over literature and arts, as sympathy for the Devil, 
leaving family behind, being half-a-person, a split personality, the like of a 
God, loosing your saneity or others…

Was has your price been – what is your thought on this?

Being a writer is hard work, and the hardest part of it is you're working all 
alone, and nobody is applauding at the end of a paragraph. You have to be very 
self-motivated, and willing to rewrite endlessly, because life is pretty 
chaotic and to make a story out of it requires discipline. I believe you have 
to write the truth out of your own heart, but that does not mean everything is 
literally something you experience. Many people think women have no 
imaginations, and can only write exactly what they experience.

Being a celebrity is a completely different gig. The Kardashian family 
exemplify this. Mostly it's about getting free designer clothes for talking 
about how hard it is to get pregnant, or why you did a sex tape in your youth. 
Reality TV has impacted all our ideas of fame, so now we are all supposed to be 
Kardashians. Writers aren't real celebrities in my opinion - when a book comes 
out, for a limited period of time people recognise you at the train station, 
and mostly in my life it's been nice. People come up and say: "I love your 
books! Goodbye." That's the kind of celebrity a writer has. It's nothing like 
being Daniel Craig, or Jennifer Lawrence. These people can literally not cross 
the street, and I feel great empathy for them.

What are your thoughts on the Fifty Shades of Gray books? And why do you think 
they are so successful?

2015 1:35pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/62211804> 
Why do people keep asking me about that abysmal drivel! Sometimes I think the 
people who ask me about it have never read either my books or James's books. 
They have really nothing in common. Maybe it's successful because nobody read 
The Story of O, or Justine and Juliette by the Marquis de Sade. Fifty Shades is 
a Cinderella story about a woman who promises submission in exchange for money. 
This is not new. We might say that women have been doing that for ages, but it 
doesn't turn me on.

I think there's a great innocence about pornography. I think a lot of people 
have never read some of the great pornography, like Memoirs of a Woman of 
Pleasure by John Cleeland, who was an 18th-century writer who impersonated a 
happy, jolly prostitute. Now, I don't think there were many happy jolly 
prostitutes in the 18th century. I think most of them were gin-soaked and ill, 
probably with many venereal diseases. Look at Hogarth's etchings. But the myth 
of the happy prostitute seems to have lingered. It's a case of trying to prove 
to people that women are happy in oppression. Newsflash: they aren't. 
Pornography is a form of mythology - it should be taken with a pinch of salt. 
Men want to believe that women are happy being receptacles - we aren't. It's a 
mythology, it's male wish fulfilment. Probably as women get freer and freer 
that kind of pornography will disappear.

Dear Erica, firstly I love your books and found their espousal of liberation 
very helpful as a young repressed Northern Irish girl :) Secondly, how do you 
feel your love of 18th Century literature impacts on your depiction of the 
feminist heroes in your modern novels?

Thank you for loving my books. I still believe that books can inspire people 
to live their lives with more freedom. Most of us find change very hard, and 
books do inspire change.

18th century literature means a lot to me because it comes from a period when 
Europeans were discovering the rights of man, and of woman. It's also a time of 
satire and I love satire, so maybe my study of the 18th century inspired the 
humour and satire in my books. The Romans used to say that the satirists lash 
the world to bring it to its senses, and I do believe that remains true, that 
if you can be deeply funny, you can wake people up from their indifference. And 
it's a great tool for waking up the reader. I think one of the first writers I 
loved was Oscar Wilde was because of his satire, and George Bernard Shaw, so 
I've always been drawn to that.
 
Pooka MacPhellimey <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15514984> asks:

Surely old age is the real fear, as death’s blessing is zero awareness? Given 
the inevitability of decrepitude, should the authentic choice of a character 
who likes to keep it real, be increasing desperation or philosophical surrender?
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15515231> Guardian contributor
EricaJong  <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15515231> 27 October 
2015 1:25pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/62211066> 
The great thing about getting older is that you no longer worry about 
decrepitude. Also, as your vision gets worse, it's harder to see yourself in 
the mirror.

I do think that some people die more gracefully than others. My own mother who 
was 101 seemed quite ready to depart; my father who was 93 raged against the 
dying of the light. Maybe this is the choice. Dylan Thomas writes that to his 
father, rage against the dying of the light - there's just different ways that 
people approach it.

I've seen a lot of people age gracefully, and really feel that they'd done 
what they needed to do in their lives. It's quite inspiring when you see that 
but not everyone can do that. Because my heroine is an actress, she knows as 
most people in the theatre know, that her appearance is all important to her 
getting work, so not everybody has that obsession - it really has to do with 
the profession you're in. If you're a computer programmer nobody cares what you 
look like. If you're in the public eye, you have to do a certain amount of 
cleaning up... I would say to my assistant when I leave the house: now I have 
to impersonate a famous author.

I’m booked on a transatlantic flight and, if i’m honest, i’m pretty nervous 
about it.

Any tips?

Flying is pretty safe - it's love that's dangerous.

What do you make of Tinder?

More broadly, can sex ever really be “no strings attached”?

I have never been on Tinder. Friends have talked to me about it, and said that 
they tried to find lovers on there, but I swear to God, I can't remember what 
they said. I think when you're very young you get excited about new 
technologies and you think they'll change the world, and then you try them, and 
I'm very dubious that new technologies will change the world. It seems to be if 
you're 15, you might say oooh Tinder! How great! But if you're a little older 
than that, perhaps not. Also, everybody is asking these questions about 
approving or disapproving - maybe this judgemental thing is the worst thing 
we've done with the internet. We're supposed to take a political position on 
these apps, that probably won't exist tomorrow. They're not here forever. 
They're not like the Himalayas. Apps go in, and apps go out.

If you read my book, you realise that the online dating stuff in my book is 
hilarious satire - no-one could read that book and think that I think that 
online dating is the solution to our problems. My heroine meets a selection of 
fetishists, and fools, who are quite disappointing.

I would say it depends on the person, regarding no strings attached sex. 
Usually the people I like are interested in human interaction more than the old 
in-out.

How does it feel to be name-checked in a Bob Dylan song? (Highlands) And do 
you think Bob’s a feminist?

It's great to be namechecked in a Bob Dylan song. Do I think he's a feminist - 
I've absolutely no idea, I've never met him. I was pleased, I love music, and 
music has always been very important so I was happy to be mentioned. Did it 
change my life? I don't think so.

He's a great talent. Once, when I was on a book tour I saw an exhibition of 
his paintings and I was very impressed - often, multiple talents go together.

Let’s get this started. 
 
Published in 1973, Erica Jong’s Fear of Flying was a sensation: a book about a 
woman who longs for sex that isn’t freighted with motherhood or power games, 
but which is a satisfying – even meaningless – experience for both men and 
women. She coined the popular term “zipless fuck” to describe this 
uncomplicated kind of sex, and the book’s liberated but complex heroine, 
Isadora Wing, was embraced by feminists; it sold 27m copies worldwide.

Jong revisited Wing twice more, and she appears again in her new novel, Fear 
of Dying 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/14/fear-of-dying-erica-jong-review-novel>
. Times have changed (there’s an adultery website, zipless.com), but the 
desires remain the same. Her main protagonist is now Vanessa Wonderman, a 
60-year-old actor refusing to let go of her sexual appetite, and having plastic 
surgery to keep herself in the game – it lays bare our prejudices about ageing, 
and anxieties about death.

With the book out this month, Erica is joining us to answer your questions 
about it and anything else in her career, in a live webchat. It starts from 1pm 
BST onwards on Tuesday 27 October – post your questions for her in the comments 
below, and she’ll answer as many as possible.
