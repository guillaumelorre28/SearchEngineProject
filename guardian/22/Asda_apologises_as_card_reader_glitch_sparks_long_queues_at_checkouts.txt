Asda <https://www.theguardian.com/business/asda> has apologised to customers 
after a problem with its card machines led to long queues at checkouts across 
the country.


The supermarket chain said it had resolved the issue in the majority of its 
stores after scores of shoppers took to social media to complain about the 
delays.

People posted photos of cashiers using old-fashioned card-readers, while 
others said stores were only accepting cash.

Thanks very much @asda <https://twitter.com/asda> I have lost my 'extra' hour 
today waiting at Boldon store as tills stopped working! 45 minutes with no 
explanation.

Seems to be technical issue at #Basingstoke 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Basingstoke?src=hash> @asda 
<https://twitter.com/asda> - no tills taking card payments, only cash. 
Customers requested to draw cash from ATM.
