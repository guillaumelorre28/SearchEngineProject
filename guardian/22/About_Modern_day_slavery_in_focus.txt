Slavery was abolished by most countries in the 19th century, but bonded and 
forced labour, trafficking and exploitation persist. The series uncovers abuses 
often hidden from public view, in the process investigating the root causes of 
this continuing abuse and looking at potential solutions.

We’ll be exploring key debates, ranging from the role of markets in sustaining 
modern-day slavery to the failure of states and justice systems in both the 
developed and developing worlds to tackle the issue effectively. This analysis 
will take a variety of forms, ranging from investigations, features and comment 
to offline events.

The Guardian is committed to open journalism, recognising that the best 
understanding of the world is achieved when we collaborate, share knowledge, 
encourage debate, welcome challenge and harness the expertise of specialists 
and their communities. This approach is particularly valuable in dealing with 
modern-day slavery, a complex issue that touches the lives of millions of 
people in communities everywhere from the richest cities to the poorest 
villages in the world.
