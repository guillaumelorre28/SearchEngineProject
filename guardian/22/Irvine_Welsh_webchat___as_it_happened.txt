Better than a three star, not as good as a five star.

"I write from character. I have to write in the voices that characters come to 
me in"

Policy2shock <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12275917> asks:

You’ve had criticized the Man Booker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/man-booker-international-prize> awards as 
one of the imperialism festivals in the world. What leads you to such a 
conclusion? What’s your idea about other important book and literature awards 
around the world? And...

Why do you constantly use Scottish words in your novels?

How much are you familiar with Persian literature including Iranian literature 
and what’s your idea about it ?

I think there's a nature of the kind of festivals, with prizes like this, of a 
rich and learned white people bestowing them on their friends or the deserving 
poor. It makes me uncomfortable. I think some of the awards have evolved and 
have become more inclusive in their judging. I'm torn - there has to be book 
festivals and awards to keep an interest going in the thing, you have to have 
something that gets people talking, so they do have a function. But you want to 
see a broad representation of all classes, ethnicities and both genders across 
all awards.

I write from character, and I have to write in the voices that characters come

I can't even remember when I started - they've always been in my

wing saving the empire message - it's purely gratuitous nonsense.

Thanks for some great stuff over the years, though in particular for 
Trainspotting <https://www.theguardian.com/books/trainspotting> and The Kingdom 
of Fife <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/21/fiction.irvinewelsh>, 
one of the funniest pieces I’ve ever read. What is it about the Scottish idiom

been televised/filmed yet? Surely Colin Farrell’s a decent shout for the lead...

Thanks very much. The Kingdom of Fife - it would be nice to see it televised. 
I wanted to write about smalltown Scotland. I'd always had a soft spot for 
Cowdenbeath, I don't know why, but I've always liked it as a town.

The things I started off with were Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell. Even though 
Waugh was posher than me, I liked the way he wrote about group relationships, 
and schaudenfreude. And George Orwell, he was such a fascinating, commited 
political writer, he sucked me in from an early age. In terms of prose style, 
Roddy Doyle and James Kelman always gave me permission to write in that kind of 
way. In some ways I wasn't really conscious of it though - when I first started 
writing Trainspotting it couldn't have come alive in any other way.

A hard one to answer. I think you always have to con yourself that you've 
written the book you want to write, but you probably never do - it changes as

We deliberately lose Scottish cup finals in order to keep the romance of the 
cup going - Hibs' failure in the cup is the only thing that keeps it 
interesting. It they won, it would kill it as a tournament.

Post your questions for Irvine Welsh

In 1993, Trainspotting bottled the British literary scene with its tales of 
the highs and lows of heroin abuse, spoken in the thick brogue of Edinburgh’s 
council estates. Along with Danny Boyle’s subsequent film adaptation, it became 
a British cultural landmark, and Welsh has sustained its energy throughout his 
career.

Through the repeating cast of characters in Trainspotting, Porno and Skagboys, 
to the vile criminals in Filth and Crime, Welsh trades in people who either 
delight or despair in corruption. His latest book A Decent Ride sees the return 
of Terry “Juice” Lawson, the sex-obsessive last seen in Glue, who now finds 
himself robbed of his virility, thus setting up another turn through terrible 
behaviour and black comedy.

Welsh is appearing at a Guardian Live event 
<https://membership.theguardian.com/event/between-the-lines-irvine-welsh-and-jesse-armstrong-15926171608>
 on Tuesday 21 April alongside Peep Show writer and and novelist Jesse 
Armstrong, discussing the art of comic writing. Earlier that day, he’ll join us 
to answer your questions about anything in his career, starting at 11.20am BST 
– post yours in the comments section below, and he’ll answer as many as 
possible.

I think there's a nature of the kind of festivals, with prizes like this, of a 
rich and learned white people bestowing them on their friends or the deserving 
poor. It makes me uncomfortable. I think some of the awards have evolved and 
have become more inclusive in their judging. I'm torn - there has to be book 
festivals and awards to keep an interest going in the thing, you have to have 
something that gets people talking, so they do have a function. But you want to 
see a broad representation of all classes, ethnicities and both genders across 
all awards.

We deliberately lose Scottish cup finals in order to keep the romance of the 
cup going - Hibs' failure in the cup is the only thing that keeps it 
interesting. It they won, it would kill it as a tournament.
 
In 1993, Trainspotting bottled the British literary scene with its tales of 
the highs and lows of heroin abuse, spoken in the thick brogue of Edinburgh’s 
council estates. Along with Danny Boyle’s subsequent film adaptation, it became 
a British cultural landmark, and Welsh has sustained its energy throughout his 
career.

Through the repeating cast of characters in Trainspotting, Porno and Skagboys, 
to the vile criminals in Filth and Crime, Welsh trades in people who either 
delight or despair in corruption. His latest book A Decent Ride sees the return 
of Terry “Juice” Lawson, the sex-obsessive last seen in Glue, who now finds 
himself robbed of his virility, thus setting up another turn through terrible 
behaviour and black comedy.
