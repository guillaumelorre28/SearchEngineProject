Dennis Publishing <https://www.theguardian.com/media/dennis-publishing> is 
bucking the industry trend by spending upwards of Â£2m launching a website based 
on the Computer & Video Games magazine brand.

While most other publishers, including Future, Emap and IPC, are scaling back 
their online investments, Guy Sneesby, the managing director of Dennis 
Interactive, said the launch would be one of the biggest of the year.

The Computerandvideogames.com portal will cover computer games on all formats, 
using technology that allows users to personalise the site to suit their own 
tastes and interests.

"On top of our investment in content and talent, we have made a significant 
investment in technology to guide users through what will be one of the largest 
and most comprehensive games sites ever built," said Mr Sneesby.

Dennis acquired the Computer & Video Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> from Emap last year as part of a 
deal that also included PlayNation magazine. Under the terms of the agreement, 
Emap will continue to promote the new site on its own web properties.

In order to beef up the content and services available to users when the site 
launches later this month, Dennis has acquired Cheatstation.com and 
Csports.net, which provide game cheats and high scores respectively.

It will add content from C&VG as well as its other computer titles, including 
PC Zone and Official Dreamcast, and is hoping for 500,000 regular users within 
the first month of the site's existence.

Kerin O'Conner, the head of marketing at Dennis, said it was a good time to 
launch a major site.

"The technology is now so much better, there's less competition and it's much 
easier to be realistic about how much you should spend," he said.
