To get an idea of how entrenched the word “fresh” is to hip-hop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop>, look to the Urban Dictionary 
<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fresh>. Across 14 pages, 
definitions include “Young. Fly. Flashy … fashion sense that people ain’t never 
seen before.” The general gist emerges: to be fresh is to be stylish, and style 
has always been key to hip-hop.

This connection is the subject of a new documentary, Fresh Dressed 
<http://freshdressedmovie.com>, directed by Sacha Jenkins and out this week. 
Starting with Run DMC – the group’s fat laces,Cazal glasses 
<http://www.cazal-eyewear.com/index.php?lang=en>, gold chains and Kangol hats – 
and running up to current fashion killasKanye West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest> and A$AP Rocky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/asap-rocky>, it’s a crash course in an 
alliance of style, culture and music. Talking heads range from Kanye himself,
Damon Dash <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/15/popandrock>, Givenchy 
creative directorRiccardo Tisci 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/dec/09/julia-roberts-riccardo-tisci-givenchy-pretty-woman>
 andAmerican Vogue’s André Leon Talley 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Leon_Talley>. Highlights include the 
story ofTupac Shakur <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2pac> modelling for 
free as a gesture of support for black designerKarl Kani 
<http://www.karlkani.com/>, and that of Dapper Dan 
<http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/21390/1/dapper-dan-natural-born-hustler>
, the cult designer who kitted out those on the 80s scene with tracksuits made 
from counterfeitGucci- <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> and Louis 
Vuitton <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton>-monogrammed fabric 
before these brands began to take legal action. Nas calls him “Tom Ford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tom-ford> before Tom Ford”.

While style takeaways from Fresh Dressed are numerous (see the rediscovery of 
late-80s labelCross Colours <http://crosscoloursla.com>), Jenkins’s film is 
really about the racial politics of hip-hop style. “All of these clothes are 
connected to what it means to be young and black in America,” says Erik 
Nielson, co-author ofThe Hip Hop & Obama Reader 
<http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199341801.do>. “They were a reflection 
of urban life to some extent. If you think of the hoody, that goes back to 
early graffiti artists who used the baggy shape to hide their probably stolen 
spraypaint, and the hood to hide from the police. And baggy jeans have 
connections with prison.”

Jenkins points out that in the early hip-hop scene, clothes were a way to 
transcend the poverty that surrounded most of those involved. Damon Dash, who 
set upRocawear <http://www.rocawear.com/> with Jay Z 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jayz>, talks in the film about how “if you 
go home and you got roaches and 10 people living in an apartment, the only way 
you can … feel some kind of status is [with] what you have on your body.” This 
may link back to the origins of “fresh” – the hip-hop look is about being 
pristine, never grimy. “That’s a major difference between hip-hop and 
rock’n’roll,” says Jenkins. “You’ll never find photos of hip-hop stars wearing 
thrift clothing.”

While American classic labels such as Tommy Hilfiger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/05/hilfiger-tommy-30-anniversary> 
andRalph Lauren 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/02/its-not-about-fabric-its-about-dreams-how-ralph-lauren-created-an-empire>
 were popular in the hip-hop community – particularly with Hilfiger organising 
“drops” of free clothes on the streets of the projects – the music reaching the 
mainstream in the 90s led to the creation of labels specifically designed for 
this market, by those inside it.Fubu <http://www.fubu.com/> – which 
appropriately stood for For Us By Us – was set up in 1992 byDaymond John 
<http://daymondjohn.com/>. Seven years later, global sales were £228m. Demand, 
says John in the film, was so extreme that stores “were selling polar fleece in 
August in Texas,” andLL Cool J <https://www.theguardian.com/music/llcoolj> 
rapped about the label in theGap commercial 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3L04ry7a4o> he made in 1999. Artists’ labels 
followed. Beginning with Russell Simmons’ Phat Farm andDiddy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/diddy>’s Sean John, everyone from the 
Wu-Tang Clan <https://www.theguardian.com/music/wutangclan> to Eminem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/eminem> – an unlikely style icon in anyone’s 
book – had a go at cashing in.

The backlash was inevitable – these labels are no longer at the forefront of 
hip-hop culture. These days, wearing a brand such as Fubu is “seen as 
‘ghetto’”, says Jenkins. Hip-hop stars such as West are more likely to be found 
in Parisian brands Givenchy and Louis Vuitton. “Houses likeLouis Vuitton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton> are connected to a dynasty 
far away from the inner city,” says the director. “It’s like being a conquerer 
– you’re buying into the notion of superiority.”

While there have always been connections with designer brands in hip-hop – see 
the Ralph Lauren-obsessed subcultureLo Lifes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/27/new-york-gangs-ralph-lauren>
 – these labels symbolise a kind of gold standard of European luxury. “With 
Kanye West it’s like: ‘I have something that you never will have,’” says 
Nielson. “There’s a form of self-aggrandising, to become larger than life 
because you can afford stuff in the upper echelons.” The need to have the 
latest symbols of status has its dark side away from West’s gilded world. 
Several people in Fresh Dressed mention the threat of sneakers being stolen 
from their feet, and there’s the story of a 2013 shooting in New York’s Bryant 
Park after afight over a teenager’s Marmot coat

According to Cynthia Lawrence-John, the fashion director at Volt magazine 
<http://www.voltcafe.com/products-page/digital-editions> – who has worked with 
West and contributed to the V&A’s exhibition about black British street style,
Staying Power <http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/s/staying-power/> – hip-hop style in 
2015 has outgrown the street and is now part of the wider fashion conversation. 
“It has influenced fashion for years. If you are in that world you know that,” 
she says. “It’s appropriated by designers, but I don’t think the street always 
gets the credit.” The latest shift is style-hungry artists such as West 
experimenting with fashion by picking up on young designers at London fashion 
week, such asAstrid Andersen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/25/women-who-design-fashion-for-men>
, and his own labelYeezy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/16/kanye-west-new-york-fashion-week-yeezy>
, which Lawrence-John says will have longevity because it “creates his own 
style”. It’s all in a lineage of fanaticism for fashion, one that can be traced 
back to those fat laces. “Hip-hop is a sensibility and an attitude that’s 
sprinkled on things that already exist. We reimagine and remix what is already 
there,” says Jenkins. “It’s in the way your pants hang or the way your cap 
tilts. It’s about identity.”

Five staples of the hip-hop look

Cazal 607s

 are hip-hop in 2015. A bit weird and futuristic, but still with the Adidas 
heritage. Fans queued for three days when they were released in April.
