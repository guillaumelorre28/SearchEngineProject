Nicolette is sixteen. She doesn’t much like being thought of as a schoolgirl 
but supposes, with characteristic directness, that she cannot be called 
anything else.

Her face is full with a pointed chin, a very snub nose, small slanting eyes 
and far fewer spots than she is conscious of. Sometimes it looks like a baby’s 
and sometimes almost middle-aged with care, but it is still basically and 
appealingly the face of a child. Her hair is brownish, springy and vaguely 
shoulder length with a ragged fringe over some of her forehead.

She lives in London but spends three-quarters of the year at a good 
boarding-school for girls in the West Country. When she leaves, she hopes to go 
to an art school.

Gloomy Talk
She appeared for lunch wearing a straight olive-green raincoat over a thick 
black pleated skirt, line-checked in shocking pink and lettuce green, a heavy 
ribbed olive-green sweater, black ribbed stockings and shiny pointed black 
bootees hand-stitched in white.

She talks about herself hesitantly, but with great honesty and accuracy, in a 
low gloomy voice:-

My shoes are hurting. I’ve just bought them and now I can’t walk in them. I 
have to walk with my heels half out of them. Does it show? Does it look awful?

It’s always happening to me with shoes now. I buy them and they feel all right 
in the shop and then they start pinching and burning halfway down the street. 
And then they get mashed about and they’re like boats. I’ve got awful feet. 
They’re all fat and lumpy. I suppose I want them to be long and narrow and 
pointed.

Everyone’s always dieting at school. They all think they’re fat but they’re 
not really, that’s the trouble. I am.

I’ve just bought another pair with high heels or Louis heels or whatever you 
call them. I can’t remember how high they are now. They’re silk and sort of 
cream-coloured but I expect they’ll be mashed up soon.

I’ve just got a dress at that shop called Chanelle in Knightsbridge. I’ve got 
to have one anyway and then there’s a dance at school at the end of term. I 
went last year and it was awful. Nobody knew what to say and the boys trod on 
my feet.

This dress is pinky-brown and sort of ordinary. I wanted it to be ordinary - 
at least, I didn’t but I’m glad it is. I’m sure I hate it now anyway. I suppose 
it’s kind of silk (not wool anyway; I never know what materials are) with a 
fairly full skirt and a kind of paper petticoat.

So Humiliated
I took my mother in to see it to-day and she paid for it. It wasn’t very much, 
that was one of the things about it, about eight I think.

Before that I spent hours in the Bazaar trying on things. I always feel awful 
in there; all the girls looking at me and my awful shape. And then one’s so 
humiliated.

And before that I went into another shop in Knightsbridge and the woman tried 
to make me buy horrible pink things with frills. She was so awful to the poor 
little assistant that I thought she’d be beastly to her if I didn’t buy 
anything. So when they turned away I marched out. Felt like slinking really, 
but marched.

School Parties
Clothes are the main thing at school. We make a tremendous thing of getting 
dressed-up and putting on eye-shadow. We give parties for each other with food 
from the town and little pop records. It seems so pointless somehow just for 
each other. But sometimes someone’ll say: “I wish some boy or other could see 
me now.”

I never quite know how to make up my eyes, but other people do it for me. I 
think of make-up as eyes, really. I’ve got quite a lot of lipsticks that people 
have given me or I’ve bought, but it never seems to work. And I’ve got powder 
but it’s in an awful box that spills everywhere. I never take it out. What’s 
the use? I’m so hopelessly spotty.

Everyone’s always dieting at school. They all think they’re fat but they’re 
not really, that’s the trouble. I am. But I never keep it up for about more 
than a few days. I get so hungry. That’s why I feel best in jerseys and skirts. 
They kind of hide it. I got this one in Italy this summer.

I got a bikini there, too. I thought I was much too fat to wear one but 
Harriet (my friend) had one and all the Italians kept telling me she looked too 
thin in it so I got one - a green one; I just walked in and they said I looked 
gorgeous and I felt wonderful and glamorous.

My bottom’s my worst body part. That’s why I don’t wear trousers as much as I 
used to.

I hate my hair. It’s just hair. I don’t much like thinking about it and just 
have it down so it covers my face. I’d like to put it up really, but I don’t 
know how to make it stay.

I like clothes that make people look interesting. I like people with 
interesting faces that make you want to know them. I’d love to have big eyes - 
I expect that’s why I don’t try to make mine up more. I suppose my snub nose is 
the best thing about me. Sometimes I hate it. But in Italy people used to 
stroke it and say how nice, so sometimes I feel pleased to have it.
