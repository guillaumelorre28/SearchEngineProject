The Volga river slices through the heartland of Russia and covers a diverse 
set of cultures. You could probably travel its length in a week if you jumped 
on trains.

I took two months doing it, partly for romantic reasons. My childhood friend 
Vicky was marrying another friend of mine, Dimitri (whom I met while working in 
St Petersburg), in Astrakhan, at the end of the river, close to the delta. They 
met when she came on a trip I was running to St Petersburg.

Stalin’s dream was to create the largest working waterway in Europe, capable 
of handling a constant flow of freight. Some might argue that the Volga 
embodies all the ugliness of the Soviet machine, ruthlessly ripping through 
Russia. But it is also a river of art, literature and myth. Pushkin, Tolstoy 
and others wrote of its magic. Many think it represents the real Russia.

The source of the Volga, near Staritsa in the Valdai hills, is housed in a 
wooden chapel, with the same smell and damp air as a Finnish sauna. Candles and 
icons decorate the walls.

This was once a wild province, like Siberia. From the 16th century, the 
fertile river banks attracted settlers and Russian traders, and it thrived. Now 
it’s a patchwork of industrialised and rural landscapes. You travel through 
arable land for miles, then have mile upon mile of stark concrete.

I rowed for 180km to the first major town, Tver. This part, north of Moscow, 
was my favourite – quiet, gentle, it runs through a soothing bygone Russia, my 
fantasy Russia of the 19th century and Tolstoy. There are lots of orthodox 
churches, and homestays. After that I used buses and trains – and walked 100km 
from Ulyanovsk to Samara.

Samara is a real summer destination, with a beach on the Volga. You have 
people rollerblading and cycling along the promenade, and a seaside feel that’s 
quite incongruous to the area.

I spent a week sleeping under the stars on a rug – I tend to travel quite 
rough. The Transit Hotel in Samara was interesting: it’s at the main railway 
station and offers a glimpse into the bureaucracy that still exists in 
provincial Russia. Because I didn’t have the right paperwork they wouldn’t let 
me have a room, but for $5 I could sleep in a chair for four hours. Every 20 
minutes or so there was a 1970s-style Tannoy going off, announcing trains and 
destinations.

I took a boat from Kazan to Ulyanovsk, the birthpace of Lenin. It’s a six-hour 
trip and I’d decided to be organised and had queued for hours several days 
earlier to book a seat (there were only nine) on the boat. But I still ended up 
in the only seat that faced backwards. I was eyeballed by passengers plus what 
felt like 100 children, for the whole journey. I had nausea and was surrounded 
by boxes of vegetables.

Volgograd is a mesmerising city. The Soviet iconography is still very evident 
and the statue of Mother Russia, a memorial to the Battle of Stalingrad, is 
mindblowing. At 80 metres high it’s intimidating but it means a lot to the 
Russian people – you’ll see them having picnics around it.

I speak Russian badly, but people are always open to conversation. In rural 
areas this will be about the important things: family, food, shelter. Because 
it’s such a huge country, there are large gaps between the big cities, so 
people see central government as a long way away with no bearing on their 
day-to-day lives – on the potato harvest. There’s very little aspiration, which 
is quite enlightening. It’s all a bit mindful really, they’re living in the 
moment.
 Sailboats on the Volga 
The trip finished at my friends’ wedding in Astrakhan. There’s a lot of 
drinking at Russian weddings, so it was fairly disorganised. And Astrakhan 
never failed to surprise me: on a relatively commercial major street, you’ll 
see goats tethered outside the banks, grazing on the grass.
