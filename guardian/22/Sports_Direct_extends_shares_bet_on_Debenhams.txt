<https://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams> by a year and reiterated that

The put-option is a bet that Debenhams’ share price will rally. If the share 
price is below the agreed exercise price when the contract expires, Sports 
Direct would have to buy the stake – the equivalent of 128.9m shares – at that 
price or pay the bank the difference. If the share price rises above the 
exercise price, Sports Direct receives the premium – a profit for Ashley and 
the company.

Sports Direct previously said its maximum exposure under the put-option was 
about £85m. Buying put-options is a way of gaining access to a sizeable stake 
in a company without tying up capital.

The retailer said: “Sports Direct reiterates its intention to be a supportive 
stakeholder in Debenhams and to create value in the interests of both Sports 
Direct’s and Debenhams’ shareholders.”

Debenhams’ share price rose slightly to 74.4p, from 73.35p on 23 January 2015 
when the put-option deal was first announced.

The agreement is Sports Direct’s only remaining put-option that relates to 
shares in other listed companies, it said. The group had set up asimilar deal 
over Tesco shares
