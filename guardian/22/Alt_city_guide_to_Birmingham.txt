Creatively, Birmingham is elusive. Unlike many cities, it does not have an 
identifiable cultural DNA. It has never asserted itself as a centre of radical 
art or music. Local creatives offer various reasons why. Some take a quiet 
pride in that anonymity: “We didn’t shout as loud as people from Manchester, 
but that’s the nature of the city”, the techno producer Karl O’Connor, aka 
Regis,once told the Quietus 
<http://thequietus.com/articles/13898-regis-downwards-karl-o-connor-interview>. 
Over the years that modesty may have become a self-fulfilling prophecy, but, 
even geographically, Birmingham is not built for self-promotion.

This “city of a thousand trades” has always been sprawling and granular. It is 
highly diverse socially and culturally, a city where the best restaurants (
Jyoti’s <http://www.jyotis.co.uk/>) or music venues (Hare & Hounds 
<http://hareandhoundskingsheath.co.uk/>), are often found in the suburbs – if 
you are willing to travel. Which not everyone is. For instance, attracting 
people from the city centre into the rave dens of neighbouring, post-industrial 
Digbeth can be difficult. Consequently, Birmingham club crowds tend to be 
dedicated and discerning, though, overall, the scene is relatively small. As 
Alex Wynne Hughes, co-promoter of theShadow City 
<https://www.facebook.com/shadowcitybirmingham/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE&fref=nf> 
parties, puts it: “A lot of people would say we’ve got our own thing going on.”

Birmingham playlist by Lisa Meyer of Supersonic festival

Fundamentally, this is a city of gangs and individuals working in comparative 
isolation, which encourages driven oddballs and out-there ideas. Look at the 
annualSupersonic festival <http://www.supersonicfestival.com/> or Brum bands 
from Black Sabbath toDexys Midnight Runners 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dexys-midnight-runners>. There is a purity 
in that, says Mark Badger from the labelIron Man <http://ironmanrecords.net/> 
(and the band Police Bastard): “If you want to make art, make it because it’s 
something you have to get out of your system; not because someone’s going to 
pay you.”

That attitude may explain why Birmingham has produced so much screamingly 
loud, confrontational music, from Napalm Death to theNegative Reaction label 
<http://www.negativereaction.co.uk/>, alongside quieter outliers such as 
Broadcast <http://futurecrayon.blogspot.co.uk/>, drone label Oaken Palace 
<https://www.oakenpalace.com/> or electronica imprint the Irrational Media 
Society <https://theirrationalmediasociety.bandcamp.com/>. These outliers can 
be influential, too. Most notably, the “Birmingham sound” (the mid-90s 
industrial output of Regis, Surgeon and the club House of God) was a key 
precursor to modern Berlin techno.

Such DIY energy is also palpable in the arts scene. Digbeth is home to 
numerous offbeat outfits, such as aerial theatre companyRogue Play 
<http://www.rogueplay.co.uk/>, and printers/ ‘zine store Rope Press 
<http://ropepress.org.uk/>. “The past two years have been exciting in terms of 
people such as Grand Union, Eastside Projects and Centrala making their own 
things happen,” says Lisa Meyer, artistic director atCapsule 
<http://www.capsule.org.uk/>, which produces Supersonic. But how long will that 
last? The planned,HS2 <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/hs2>-related 
transformation of Digbeth threatens the area’s creative pioneers. “As the 
largest arts organisation here, we don’t own our building. It’s precarious,” 
warnsEastside Projects <https://eastsideprojects.org/>’ director Gavin Wade.

The battle to find affordable space in central Birmingham is one that food 
entrepreneurs know well. Birmingham has five Michelin stars, but, says Lap-fai 
Lee, a professional cook and blogger atthefoodist.uk 
<http://www.thefoodist.co.uk/>, “I’d trade three of our stars for 20 more 
places like [indie burger joint] Original Patty Men.”

The message? Support Birmingham’s battling independents.

CULTURE

Centrala

Run by the Polish Expats Association, this colourful warehouse space is a 
gallery, venue, cafe and “destination for free-thinkers”. It hosts everything 
from avant-garde music events to calligraphy workshops. “Its visual art, film 
and performance programme has a strong east European flavour,” says Jonathan 
Watkins, director at theIKON gallery <https://ikon-gallery.org/>. “The cafe 
serves delicious Polish dumplings.”

On the first Friday of each month, Digbeth’s creative hubs throw open their 
doors. Minerva Works, in particular, is home to a cluster of innovative 
artist-run gallery and performance spaces, such asStryx <http://stryx.co.uk/>, 
Grand Union <http://grand-union.org.uk/> and Vivid Projects 
<http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/>. On 3 December, Vivid Projects is throwing 
an Algorave, where freshly minted electronic bangers are generated live from 
computer algorithms. Look out forRecent Activity <http://recentactivity.org.uk/>
, which sites art in odd places.

The festival happens each April but, beyond that, Flatpack 
<http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/> keeps busy throwing events such as a 
screening of Bride of Frankenstein in Dudley Castle, or a 90s hip-hop club 
night in celebration of Kid ‘n’ Play’s House Party (26 November). “It uses 
spaces really imaginatively,” says Lisa Meyer. For more alternative cinema, try

DRINK

Post Office Vaults

Due to the street-level livery, people still mistake this (basic, windowless) 
basement for a post office, but what it delivers is superb keg and cask beers, 
and real ciders. Ross Lang, who runs theBottle Shed 
<https://twitter.com/bottleshedbrum> in Acocks Green, loves it: “You expect a 
pub with just bitter and mild on. In fact, it has a selection of 400 beers, 
from traditional Belgian bottles to Magic Rock cans.”

With its cobbled-together, DIY aesthetic, street-food residencies and local 
art, 1000 Trades is an unusually interesting watering hole in the upmarket 
Jewellery Quarter. It focuses on natural wines and craft beers. Fans of the 
latter may also like the Jewellery Quarter’s brewery taps atBurning Soul

Faculty 

An unapologetically nerdy coffee shop – check out that chart of bewildering 
PH, TDS, DGH water statistics – Faculty serves a stunning flat white: rich, 
silky, full of sweet caramel flavours, a lick of liquorice at the close. In 
nearby City Arcade,Tilt <http://tiltbrum.com/> is similarly hot on coffee, as 
well as pinball and craft beer (schooners from £3.80). Ross Lang: “Tilt has 
pushed boundaries. It once had eight Swedish Omnipollo beers on at once. There 
were 40 people queueing at the bar.”

<https://twitter.com/CotteridgeWines?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor>
 andBottle Shed <https://twitter.com/bottleshedbrum> for starters. As well as 
their growler refills and rare bottles, these also offer space where shoppers 
can drink on-site. Clink has brought that concept into town… ish, with its 
shop-cum-taproom atDigbeth’s Custard Factory <http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/>
. Its global selection includes 200 bottled beers and eight keg lines from

MUSIC

The Rainbow

March. Photograph: Here & Now 
Originally a pub, the Rainbow has, over the years, grown into numerous 
modular, interlinked Digbeth venues which, collectively, constitute the core of 
Brum’s underground club scene. Look out for nights from Shadow City,Leftfoot 
<http://www.leftfootevents.co.uk/>, Portal <http://www.portalmusic.co.uk/> and 
Blackdot <https://www.facebook.com/blackdotevent/>. “The Rainbow’s Blackbox is 
arguably one of the best clubs in the country,” says Tom Hopkins from gig and

are on a level with you, the light and sound are incredible.”

Suki10c

This graffiti-covered outpost is unusually green, with its eco-electricity and 
conscientious recycling, and a hotbed of raucous, sweaty gigs and club nights 
running the gamut from indie to grime. “It’s small, maybe 150 capacity, and 
when I’ve DJd there it’s been good fun,” says Shadow City’s Alex Wynne Hughes.

provide a platform for roving Birmingham institutions such as drum’n’bass 
outfit Break Thru, andMagic Door <https://www.facebook.com/magicdooruk/> – a

EAT

Original Patty Men
 Photograph: Jack Spicer Adams 
“It boggles my mind that someone would sit in Ed’s Easy Diner in Selfridges, 
when, over the road, you can have a proper burger at Original Patty Men,” says 
Lap-fai Lee, of this rough-edged railway arch site. Its well-seasoned, 
vigorously charred patties and zingy pickles deliver, although some of the beer 
prices are staggering (568ml bottle of Arbor’s 6.5% Umm…Bingo?, £7.50). For 
more from Birmingham’s buoyant street food scene, go to the weeklyDigbeth

40 23

Near New Street railway station, this tiny takeaway-cafe is run by three mates 
from Thessaloniki who do a tasty, affordable line in Greek comfort food. That 
means homely specials such as moussaka,soutzoukakia (meatballs), or potato and 
pea stew, andarakas, but also grilled meats: pork souvlaki, loukaniko 
(sausages) that are stuffed into pittas with salad, tzatziki and fried 
potatoes. “It has a cult following,” says Joe Schuppler, editor at

Rico Libre 

“A raw, noisy and busy tapas restaurant,” says Eastside Projects’ Gavin Wade, 
whose arty Digbeth crowd adores this former greasy spoon, subsequently given a 
lick of paint and decked out with music and movie posters. Expect Spanish 
classics (gambas pil pil, bravas, albondigas) and a globe-trotting specials 
boards (frogs’ legs, barbecue pork ribs). BYO alcohol.

Modu

On a grimy street of industrial units, this family-run Korean restaurant is a 
quirky proposition. Guests eat in one of three spaces, which include a summer 
courtyard and a brick out-building, whitewashed and jazzed up with colourful 
knick-knacks. Portions are not huge, but the flavours are true in, say, the 
marinatedbulgogi beef served with kimchi. The female kitchen staff are chatty 
evangelists for Korean food, Modu’s fried chicken has many local fans and, as 
Supersonic’s Lisa Meyer says of the four-course £15 menu: “It’s amazing value.”

Look In

For Chinatown’s connoisseurs, Peach Garden’s triple roast (crispy pork belly, 
duck, char siu with rice, £7.50, 34 Ladywell Walk, 0121-666 7502) is one of 
Birmingham’s best bargains. But, says Lap-fai Lee, the “quality of the meat” at 
Look In means its triple is edging ahead as the No1. He is not wrong. Look In’s 
honey-lacquered char siu is unusually good, while the crust-not-crackling on 
its beautifully moist pork belly tastes as if someone has coated it in the 
purest essence of Frazzles. It is incredible.
