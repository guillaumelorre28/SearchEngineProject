B: We're out of here. But to the person who asked which one of our albums we 
enjoyed making the most - without a doubt, Revolution Radio is the album we 
enjoyed making the most. We are back, stronger than ever, and ready to play 
amazing gigs for all ages to enjoy. Thank you kindly, yours sincerely, Green 
Day!

B: The trilogy, we just wanted to make a mess. 
M: By playing music together, that's our inspiration. And listening to pirate 
radio.

What can people do after electing Trump? 'Give someone a hug'

Andy Jardy <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16980643> asks:

What’s the best thing I can do for this country now that we’ve elected someone 
as terrifying as Trump? I’m so angry and want to find a positive, peaceful 
outlet for that anger. Rage and Love, always.

Dan Hegarty <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16980612> asks:

Big fan of Green Day <https://www.theguardian.com/music/greenday>, especially 
the classics from Dookie – that must be the most played album on my iPod.

I have a lot of respect for you guys, but I have to ask, how can you endorse a 
candidate like Hillary Clinton in the US presidential elections? Given the 
numerous examples of her corruption and cronyism in the leaked emails from the 
DNC and John Podesta, her support for US military intervention in foreign 
conflicts, her being funded by huge corporations, global bankers and her 
chop-and-change view on gay marriage. She seems like the anti-candidate for 
Green Day, and I can’t see why you didn’t support a third party or independent 
candidate that would at least try to do good by the American people.

B: I voted for Bernie first. Hillary Clinton is not the president of the US, 
she has to own that. The bigger problem is Trump, and how you deal with 
fascism. Emails are obsolete. I've had a fascist president for three days - I 
don't know how to deal with it yet.

B: Our intention was to play music for the rest of our lives. I don't worry 
about what other people think of me, we just want to make great records and 
tour the world, and that's how we felt during Kerplunk just as with Revolution 
Radio.

'We accept anyone who feels marginalised at a Green Day event. Period'

ArketyHodge <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16980746> asks:

I recently watched a documentary about Pansy Division and was really impressed 
by your support and promotion of a queercore band on that 1994 tour. Twenty two 
years on, do you think homophobia is still an issue in punk/rock or the music 
world in general? How do you think LGBT rights [in the US] will fare under the 
Trump administration?

Period. Especially if you're gay or trans, black, white, brown, or of any 
nationality. Period.Green Day <https://www.theguardian.com/music/greenday> is a

M: At a show in San Francisco, a fan jumped off a 20 foot tall balcony and 
crowdsurfed to the stage. It was fucking amazing.
B: It was!
M: The crowd caught him, it was crazy. A friend who was a stuntman said he 
couldn't do it better himself. And then played the song Knowledge on stage with 
us, on guitar.

Where do you find inspiration for some of your non-political albums? What 
inspired the sound on Warning, or the sound on the trilogy?

B: The trilogy, we just wanted to make a mess. 
M: By playing music together, that's our inspiration. And listening to pirate 
radio.

What’s the best thing I can do for this country now that we’ve elected someone 
as terrifying as Trump? I’m so angry and want to find a positive, peaceful 
outlet for that anger. Rage and Love, always.

Dan Hegarty <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16980612> asks:

Big fan of Green Day <https://www.theguardian.com/music/greenday>, especially 
the classics from Dookie – that must be the most played album on my iPod.

I have a lot of respect for you guys, but I have to ask, how can you endorse a 
candidate like Hillary Clinton in the US presidential elections? Given the 
numerous examples of her corruption and cronyism in the leaked emails from the 
DNC and John Podesta, her support for US military intervention in foreign 
conflicts, her being funded by huge corporations, global bankers and her 
chop-and-change view on gay marriage. She seems like the anti-candidate for 
Green Day, and I can’t see why you didn’t support a third party or independent 
candidate that would at least try to do good by the American people.

B: I voted for Bernie first. Hillary Clinton is not the president of the US, 
she has to own that. The bigger problem is Trump, and how you deal with 
fascism. Emails are obsolete. I've had a fascist president for three days - I 
don't know how to deal with it yet.

T: I'd like to win an Adult Video Network award.
M: I would like to have a comeback album after we die. Our best album will be 
released the minute we pass. That would be neat. Not just put it out - record 
it after we die. That's optimism.

B: Our intention was to play music for the rest of our lives. I don't worry 
about what other people think of me, we just want to make great records and 
tour the world, and that's how we felt during Kerplunk just as with Revolution 
Radio.

I recently watched a documentary about Pansy Division and was really impressed 
by your support and promotion of a queercore band on that 1994 tour. Twenty two 
years on, do you think homophobia is still an issue in punk/rock or the music 
world in general? How do you think LGBT rights [in the US] will fare under the 
Trump administration?

Period. Especially if you're gay or trans, black, white, brown, or of any 
nationality. Period.Green Day <https://www.theguardian.com/music/greenday> is a

M: At a show in San Francisco, a fan jumped off a 20 foot tall balcony and 
crowdsurfed to the stage. It was fucking amazing.
B: It was!
M: The crowd caught him, it was crazy. A friend who was a stuntman said he 
couldn't do it better himself. And then played the song Knowledge on stage with 
us, on guitar.
