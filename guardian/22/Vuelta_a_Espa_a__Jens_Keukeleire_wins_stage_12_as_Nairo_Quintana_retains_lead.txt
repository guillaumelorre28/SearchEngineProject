<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/vuelta-a-espana> as Nairo Quintana retained 
the leaders’ red jersey ahead of Chris Froome.

The 193.2km stage from Los Corrales de Buelna to Bilbao in northern Spain 
ended in a much-reduced sprint finish, and Orica-BikeExchange’s 27-year-old 
Belgian Keukeleire took victory ahead of Etixx - Quick-Step’s Maxime Bouet and 
Trek-Segafredo’s Fabio Felline for his first Grand Tour stage win.

The main protagonists in the general classification battle were not far 
behind, with Quintana’s team-mate Alejandro Valverde taking eighth place on the 
day.

Quintana crossed the line 26th, five places behind Froome, but with no time 
splits in the pack there was no change in the battle for red. Quintana leads 
Froome by 54 seconds afterFroome’s stage 11 victory

 in Peña Cabarga on Wednesday. Valverde is third, a further 11 seconds back on 
Froome.

Orica-BikeExchange’s Simon Yates sits seventh, three minutes and 25 seconds 
behind Quintana.

Froome’s team-mates Peter Kennaugh and David López were part of the day’s 
breakaway, but the group splintered on the second of two laps of a circuit 
around Bilbao, which included the category two climb of Alto el Vivero.

IAM Cycling’s Dries Devenyns launched a late bid for glory as a spritely 
looking Alberto Contador of Tinkoff led the contenders up the climb, but it all 
came back together on the streets of the city before Keukeleire made his move 
in the sprint.
