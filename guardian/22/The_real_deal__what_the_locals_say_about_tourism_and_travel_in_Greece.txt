<http://www.alternativeathens.com/> in the capital
It’s very quiet in Athens at the moment but most shops are still open and we 
haven’t seen any problems with supplies or food. I’m not panicking, but I am 
concerned because this was a very good year – in June our business had doubled.

The media shows a state of chaos and anarchy – it’s really damaging. I 
received an email today from a couple asking if there was still water in our 
country. We stay calm and explain that the situation is not like that.

The ATMs are running out of money and you see people spending less at the end 
of their holiday than the beginning. I am thankful to people who continue to 
visitGreece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> after all the trouble. 
Tourists will get the same service and the same smile as ever. I have about a 
fifth fewer customers than last year. There aren’t as many new faces, only the 
regulars who are not put off by the negative news. For the past month I have 
only accepted payment by cash but, when the government reaches a solution, I 
will be happy to take card payments again.

In the week before the referendum, we had a slight panic buy on petrol and one 
of our local petrol stations ran out … for half a day. And my 77-year-old 
mother bought 10 bars of Cadbury Fruit and Nut! Greeks are understandably 
cancelling in fairly significant numbers but I was on the beach in Stoupa last 
night and it very much felt like business as usual – bars and tavernas full of 
people strolling up and down the promenade.

The normal number of reservations are not happening – and we have no Greek 
tourists at all. There are media photos showing pensioners waiting outside 
closed banks – but, in reality, they are all receiving their pensions. It is 
standard practice in Greece for old people to wait outside the banks before 
they open, sometimes from 7am. We are the same people, with the same beautiful 
places. That has not changed.

I got an email asking if there was still water in our country. We stay calm 
and explain the situation is not like that.

Antonios Maniatis owns Kivo Art & Gourmet Hotel, Skiathos in the Aegean
My biggest worry is cancellations but we haven’t had any and the hotel is 
currently fully booked. However, we have not yet had any new bookings for 
September. Local Greeks often eat at the hotel restaurant but they are spending 
less. The biggest day-to-day problem is that the banks are closed, which 
affects payment methods. Greeks queue at the ATMs to take out €60 a day, but 
this is not enough to run a hotel. How can I pay my suppliers or get paid by 
tour operators if the banks remain closed?

George Kyriakos owns Nautilus Diving Club in Vassiliki bay, Lefkada
We are lucky that Vassiliki attracts people with specific interests, like 
diving and windsurfing, and my bookings are even better than last year. But I 
have heard from diving colleagues that some of the other Greek islands are 
suffering. Tourism is the biggest industry here. Greek visitors have already 
disappeared and it would be a disaster if foreign tourists stopped visiting, 
too.

Our economy here is more self-sufficient than a place like Athens. Most locals 
grow a big part of their food and produce energy using solar or biomass 
methods. Ikarians use two times less fossil fuel for heating than average in 
Greece. Potential visitors should ignore those who tell them they might have 
problems in our island and country.

I've spoken to hoteliers in the Peloponnese and to my dad in Athens. All said 
there is no shortage of any supplies

I have spoken to hoteliers this week, in the Peloponnese and in Athens, and to 
my dad who lives in Athens. All said there is no shortage of any supplies; 
probably the first thing to run out will be heating oil in due course, but that 
is not an issue for coastal areas yet. Greeks have bartering in their veins and 
are falling back on extended-family and community networks to swap goods, 
rather than buy and sell. Most hotels continue to take card payments but very 
reluctantly, because of a fear that they won’t be able to access all the money. 
My dad said Athens is peaceful and he has actually seen some new businesses 
(mostly cafes) opening recently. He says high-street shops and supermarkets are 
not discounting any more than usual.

Luckily, this summer has been busy but I worry about the next few months. 
Business is down in my other jobs – renting rooms and selling flowers – because 
Greek people are worried about spending. It’s good that Skiathos is so 
beautiful and easy to get to by air. If tourism continues, I feel positive 
about the future.

Elena Soutari, manager of Hotel Porto Scoutari 
<http://www.portoscoutari.com/hotel/>
Everything is working fine on Patmos right now. There are no shortages of 
anything. As long as we don’t have cancellations, which we haven’t had so far, 
the season looks good. My hotel is almost fully booked for the summer, but we 
will gladly help visitors find another place. Or come in September – the sea is 
warm, the sun shines, and it’s a beautiful month here.
