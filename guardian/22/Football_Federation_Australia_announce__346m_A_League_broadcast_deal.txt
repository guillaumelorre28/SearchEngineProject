But the overall broadcast deal won’t be confirmed until next year, with FFA 
holding off selling one Saturday night match to a free-to-air television 
partner.

FFA chairman Steven Lowy said the deal showed football was “now entrenched as 
a mainstream Australian sport”.

“Our game has never seen a deal of this magnitude before,” Lowy said of the 
$57.6m-a-year deal.

“This six-year agreement gives us the certainty to continue to implement our 
strategy to grow the Hyundai A-League and the Westfield W-League and invest 
more in grassroots football development and the women’s game.”

FFA chief executive David Gallop has wasted no time apportioning an extra $3m 
to increase its marquee fund, which saw head office help foot the bill for Tim 
Cahill’s return to Australian football.

“We have seen the enormous impact that our current marketing and marquee 
player strategies are having,” Gallop said. “This year TV audiences, crowds and 
club memberships are all up and it is our intention to re-double our efforts in 
these areas under the new deal.

“The new arrangements will benefit all areas of football in Australia, but in 
particular the A-League clubs and players who will receive additional funding 
as a result of today’s announcement.”

Fox Sports also celebrated the announcement, with chief executive Patrick 
Delany delighting in the deal, which sees the broadcaster lock in every major 
Australian football code until 2020.

The free-to-air deal taking in Saturday night’s match of the round is unlikely 
to be done until the Big Bash League rights are purchased early next year.

Channels Seven, Nine and Ten are prioritising the highly popular T20 
competition but all are believed to be keen on broadcasting the A-League should 
they miss out.

The new deal will end free-to-air channel SBS’s unpopular time as a partner of 
the league. Fox Sports has broadcast the A-League since its creation in 2005.
