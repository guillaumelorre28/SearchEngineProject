Australia’s reefs

To the Barrier … and beyond
With Sir David Attenborough espousing its delights in his latest BBC 
documentary series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/21/david-attenborough-great-barrier-reef-australia>
, theGreat Barrier Reef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/30/great-barrier-reef-australia-holiday-guide>
 – made up of the 1,400-mile string of islands, coral reefs and sand cays off 
the Queensland coast – is ready for the rush. One of Attenborough’s programmes 
features the giant manta rays of Lady Elliot Island, 50 miles from Bundaberg (a 
four-hour drive from Brisbane), and visitors can check them out on a stay at 
the island’seco-resort  <http://www.ladyelliot.com.au/>(twins from £83pppn).

Another option is to nip over to Lady Musgrave Island on a new catamaran 
<http://www.ladymusgraveexperience.com.au/> from Bundaberg (day tour £100) or 
pack a tent to make like a castaway onLady Musgrave, the Whitsunday or Lizard 
islands <http://lmcruises.com.au/Camping.aspx> (permit £3pp). Or try glam hostel
Rambutan <http://www.rambutantownsville.com.au/>, which opened recently 
adjacent to the reef in Townsville (dorm beds from £14, rooms from £60).

Alternatively, head for Ningaloo Reef on Australia’s north-west coast, which 
attracts far fewer tourists than the Great Barrier and has plenty to offer. At 
its southern end is the superbly remoteGnaraloo Sheep Station 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/25/western-australia-ningaloo-reef-gnaraloo>
, where you can volunteer on operations such as protecting turtle nests, or use 
it as a base for fishing, surfing (some of the best breaks in the world are 
here) and snorkelling (camping £9, cabins from £17). Further north, in Exmouth, 
a number of operators offer swimming with whale sharks, but now licences have 
been issued for swimming with humpback whales too: around 30,000 of them 
annually migrate along the coast.Charter1 <http://www.charter1.com.au/> offers 
whale swim trips from £190. Tours will run from June to October. Another 
newcomer is a kayak trail with moorings and free campsites along the coast, 
with the best snorkelling sites pin-pointed.Capricorn Sea Kayaking 
<http://www.capricornseakayaking.com.au/> has a three-day trip from £487.

 ‘Guggenheim of wine’ … La Cité du Vin Museum. Photograph: Philippe Caumes 
With its wide boulevards and neoclassical buildings on the banks of the 
Garonne, Bordeaux has never been short of ambition. Now the centre of the 
region that produces the biggest volume of fine wines in France wants to be 
known as the wine capital of the world. And it’s staking its claim with the 
opening in June of an ultra-modern museum,La Cité du Vin 
<http://laciteduvin.com/accueil.html>, “exploring the evolution of wine and 
honouring all vintages of the planet”.

The region that produces the biggest volume of fine wines in France now wants 
to be known as the world's wine capital

Already dubbed the “Guggenheim of wine”, the futuristic, glass-clad, curved 
building was designed to evoke wine flowing through a stemmed glass, and aims 
to liberate wine tourism from its stuffy, elitist reputation. The 10-storey 
building will house an “immersive” tour of viniculture, including a “theatre of 
experts”, with professionals appearing as holograms dispensing advice, and 
“magic binoculars” for looking out over the world’s vineyards. There will be a 
restaurant at the top of the 55-metre viewing tower, and once visitors have had 
their fill of theory, boats can shuttle them to vineyards on the outskirts of 
Bordeaux.

If you thought you’d seen all there was to see of the “Marvellous City” during 
the 2014 Brazil World Cup, think again. Rio’s stunning natural landscape should 
make this the most photogenic Olympics ever. The rowing will be held on the 
Lagoa, a natural lake ringed by imposing black mountains; the road cycling will 
speed through the city’s rainforested hills; and the beach volleyball will be 
on Copacabana beach – also the site of the Olympic fanzone. Away from sport,

There have been times in recent years when the arrival of a western tourist at 
an Iranian hotel attracted a crowd of sightseers and a formal welcome from 
management. But since the Vienna agreement on the country’snuclear programme  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-18-days-in-vienna>
was reached in July and the subsequent softening of relations with the west, 
those rare visitors are set to grow in number. Exposure to contemporary culture 
from Iran has also grown this year with the filmTaxi Tehran

In a recent survey, Hokkaido was Japanese travellers’ preferred region, with 
Hakodate, the gateway to Hokkaido, voted the country’s most attractive tourist 
destination, followed by Sapporo. Hakodate is celebrated for its historic 
buildings, landscapes including Mount Hakodate, and dishes such asikura (salmon 
roe) and squid-ink ice-cream.

Sapporo, meanwhile, is styling itself as Japan’s version of US hipster city 
Portland. People are relocating there for its laid-back lifestyle, outdoorsy 
edge, winter festival, small start-up businesses and retro-styled bar scene. 
The Hokkaido Shinkansen route will connect Tokyo with Shin-Hakodate Hokuto in 
four hours, two hours less than the current journey time. A seven-dayJapan Rail 
pass <http://www.jrpass.com/> costs £157.

celebrate, a steam-powered cast-iron puppet of a miner, that’s 12 metres tall, 
will spend two weeks in late July walking across Cornwall, stopping at mining 
locations en route.

Food fans who have the appetite, if not the wallet, for Nordic cuisine should 
head to Copenhagen, where some of the city’s high-end restaurants are opening 
casual alternatives. While René Redzepi’s world-beating Noma relocates to 
Sydney from January to April, the team is opening a new spot, called108 
<http://108.dk/en/>, with more seats and a more affordable menu than the 
mothership.

108 will start off as a pop-up on Noma’s premises during the Australian 
hiatus, before moving to a permanent location. Small plates (around £10) and 
mains (£15) will include cured squid and bacon broth, and caramelised milk skin 
with veal tongue.

Kadeau <http://www.kadeau.dk/kbh_english.php>, another celebrated restaurant 
in the canal area of Christianshavn, has also launched a more laid-back 
offshoot,Eldorado <http://eldoradokbh.dk/>, with a menu featuring papadums and 
Thai coconut soup – signalling the city’s appreciation for a cuisine beyond 
foraged beach herbs and Nordic dogmas. Craft brewery Mikkeller follows this 
trend with recently openedRamen to Bíiru 
<https://www.facebook.com/Ramen-to-B%C3%ADiru-1606601632934437/> in the 
bohemian Nørrebro district, serving, as the name suggests, bowls of ramen.

 Noordbrabants Museum 
In February, this small Dutch town an hour south of Amsterdam by train will 
stage a cultural coup. Dutch Renaissance painter Hieronymus Bosch was born and 
worked in the town, and died there 500 years ago. To pay tribute, the
Noordbrabants Museum 
<http://www.hetnoordbrabantsmuseum.nl/verwacht/jheronimus-bosch/> is putting on 
an exhibition of 39 of the artist’s iconic paintings and drawings – the largest 
ever Bosch exhibition. The whole town is getting into the spirit of the 
artist’s fantastical paintings, with fringe events such as a jaunt around the 
city’s canals and river called the Boat Trip of Heaven and Hell, and some of 
Bosch’s more grotesque works projected on to walls beneath its tunnels and 
bridges.

On 25 August 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the act that created the 
National Park Service, “to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic 
objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same 
in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for future 
generations”.

One hundred years later, the 84-million-plus-acre National Park Service 
comprises 409 sites, including 58 national and historical parks, monuments, 
battlefields, and seashore. In 2014, almost 293 million people visited them. 
The opening event of the centennial takes place on 1 January, with the enormous
Tournament of Roses Parade 
<http://www.tournamentofroses.com/rose-parade/theme-grand-marshal> winding 
through the streets of Pasadena, Los Angeles – the theme is “Find Your 
Adventure’’ in a US national park. All national parks will waive their entrance 
fees on 16 special days in 2016, including during National Park Week (16-24 
April), and the National Park Service Birthday (25-28 August).

Le Marche, a region halfway up the eastern side of Italy’s boot, is slowly 
being discovered by Brits: visitor numbers were up 24% in the year to August, 
though from a very low base. And tourists are staying there longer – enjoying 
the region’s beaches, hilltop villages, art-filled towns and great outdoors for 
their own sake, rather than making a quick foray from Umbria or Abruzzo.

Hospitality in Le Marche used to be in staid business hotels or pack-’em-in 
beachside billets, with (uninspiring) half-board compulsory in summer. But a 
younger generation has taken the British concept of bed-and-breakfast to their 
hearts.

La Maison Jujube  <http://www.lamaisonjujube.it/>(doubles from €69 B&B) is in 
a 14th-century village house in Morrovalle, between the sea and the old 
university city of Macerata, with two bedrooms, a walled garden and great 
views. Less than an hour away is one of Italy’s best beaches, spectacular Due 
Sorelle, beneath white cliffs and accessible by boat from the harbour at Numana.

Inland, medieval Urbino is a must-see for the renaissance art in its Palazzo

On 23 April, to mark 400 years since the death of William Shakespeare, the BBC 
will broadcast a live tribute from the RSC theatre in Stratford. Spring is a 
great time to explore more of the playwright’s home county. As well as the RSC 
itself (which opens a newShakespeare exhibition

Iceland’s popularity is well-justified, but access is nearly always through 
Reykjavik, giving any trip a bias towards the west. In May, new direct flights 
from Gatwick to Egilsstaðir in the east will allow visitors to head straight to 
some of the wilder, more remote areas.

There are impressive drives down the east coast fjords, taking in little towns 
such as Seyðisfjörður, a good base for summer hiking. Other highlights are 
treks to Mount Snæfell or the Hafrahvammar canyon. For full immersion in 
Icelandic culture, head up the Fljótsdalur valley, a place inextricably linked 
with author Gunnar Gunnarsson, nominated six times for the Nobel prize. At the 
upper end of the valley, tourists can walk or ride horses into a lost 
wilderness inhabited by pink-footed geese, reindeer and arctic foxes. Flights 
to Egilsstaðir will operate twice weekly from May withDiscover the World 
<https://www.discover-the-world.co.uk/>. The tour operator also offers a 
seven-night, tailor-madeExploring East Fjords tour 
<https://www.discover-the-world.co.uk/destinations/iceland-holidays/exploring-east-fjords>
 (tailor-made), from £951pp, including return flights, airport taxes, car 
rental and accommodation. It also organises a climb of Mount Snaefell, 
including transfers from Egilsstadur and visits to hot pools afterwards (£216).

 Auditorio opera house 
With its walking festivals and rural hotels, Tenerife has proved that there’s 
more to the largest Canary island than beach holidays. Its capital, Santa Cruz, 
has stayed off-radar, but that will change in July, with the release of the 
fifth Bourne movie. Much of the action was shot in the city, but while the film 
probably won’t linger on Santa Cruz’s emerging foodie scene, its soaring 
Auditorio opera house, or brightly painted historic buildings, visitors should. 
Those of a gastronomic persuasion will be particularly happy:El Rincon de Juan 
Carlos <http://elrincondejuancarlos.es/>, a contemporary Spanish restaurant, 
has just won a Michelin star, doubling the city’s stellar dining options.

 Gardens at Harewood House 
Our land may have been green and pleasant before Lancelot “Capability” Brown 
started rearranging its hills and lakes, but the UK’s most celebrated landscape 
gardener was so prolific – he is associated with 260 sites in England and Wales 
– that many of the landscapes we think of today as typically English are, in 
fact, typically Lancelot. In 2016, designated theYear of the English Garden by 
VisitEngland 
<https://www.visitengland.com/biz/about-us/campaigns-and-opportunities/year-english-garden-2016>
, around 150 of the landscapes Brown designed will be open to the public, with 
organisations such as the National Trust and the Royal Horticultural Society 
contributing to a nationwide programme of events marking 300 years since his 
birth. Some of the sites will open specially for the occasion; others, such as 
Harewood House near Leeds, are upping their Capability credentials with events 
and exhibitions.

In 2016 around 150 of the landscapes designed by Capability Brown will be open 
to the public

True Brown aficionados could start with a pilgrimage to the small village of 
Kirkharle in Northumberland, where he was born. Brown discovered gardening 
here, learning his craft via an apprenticeship with the head gardener at 
Kirkharle Hall. Though it’s an unassuming site today (much of the hall was 
demolished in the 19th century, and the remaining wing was remodelled as a 
farmhouse), Brown’s plans for the parkland here were finally put into action in 
2010 by the estate’s owners. The landscape now includes a serpentine lake 
around which visitors can stroll, and a children’s play area (complete with 
Capability-inspired serpentine sandpit). Find out more first by visiting an 
exhibition on Brown’s life in the area at theKirkharle Courtyard Coffee House 
<http://kirkharlecourtyard.co.uk/> and craft centre (also the hub for a 
Capability festival over the August bank holiday weekend), seeing the church 
where Brown was baptised, then carrying on north toAlnwick Castle 
<http://www.alnwickcastle.com/>, where he designed the landscape on its 
northern side.

It has long been known for gastronomy, but this year San Sebastián is tempting 
visitors with a packed cultural programme. As the jointEuropean Capital of 
Culture 2016 <http://dss2016.eu/en/> (with Wrocław in Poland), its lineup of 
events include “guerilla lighting actions” to brighten the dark days of 
January; a music-box festival with gigs in unusual spaces; an art installation 
involving the city’s fountains; a “caravan of desires” full of erotica 
travelling through the streets; a Stop the War festival; and Sunday hikes.

San Sebastian: in the limelight

One appealing-sounding show is a performance of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 
Cristina Enea Park, with live music and contemporary dance, preceded by an 
alfresco feast at dusk. Culture aside, the city’s highlights include apintxo 
(tapas) crawl around the bars of the old town or, at the other end of the 
spectrum, a Michelin-starred dinner – San Sebastián’s restaurants have 16 stars 
between them, including three three-star establishments – astonishing for a 
relatively small city. The best views are from the top of Mount Urgull. There 
is a fantastic city beach, Playa de la Concha, plus two surfing beaches, and 
the Paseo Nuevo is the place to stroll and watch the sunset.

Stade de France. For supporters of Wales and Northern Ireland, it will be the 
first opportunity to support their side in 58 and 30 years respectively. 
England and Wales will meet in their opening group game, in the north-eastern 
city of Lens, home to the minimalist Louvre-Lens, an outpost of the Paris 
museum. Northern Ireland’s fans will no doubt be cheered to discover that their 
opening game will be a chance to sun themselves on the Med, as they play Poland 
in Nice. The Republic of Ireland head to Paris to take on Sweden. The 
tournament will be spread across 10 venues (Paris’s Stade de France and Parc 
des Princes, Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Lens, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Nice and 
Saint-Etienne), with the final at the Stade de France on 10 July. French rail 
operatorSNCF <https://uk.voyages-sncf.com/en/?redirect=yes#/> and the French 
tourist organisationAtout France <http://uk.france.fr/en/euro2016> have guides 
to the host cities and train travel to them.

<http://umfa.utah.edu/>, Clark Planetarium <http://clarkplanetarium.org/>, 
Temple Square <http://www.templesquare.com/>’s architecture and tabernacle, and 
many more Mormon sites – but the best thing about the first direct flights to 
Utah’s capital, launching on 1 May withDelta <http://www.delta.com/>, is that 
the city is a leaping-off point to theWasatch mountains and national parks

The best thing about the first direct flights to Utah’s capital is that it's a 
leaping-off point to national parks

There are several stellar ski resorts in valleys within an hour or so’s drive, 
includingPark City 
<https://www.visitparkcity.com/winter/?gclid=CIDCw7nG78kCFQs8GwodWPADBw>, which 
hosts theSundance Film Festival 
<http://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival> and is newly 
connected this season to the resort previously known as The Canyons: together, 
they form the US’s largest ski resort, with nearly 300 runs. There’s also 
chichi celeb haunt Deer Valley, where snowboarding is banned, newly opened
Cherry Peak resort <http://www.skicherrypeak.us/>, and cool, quirky little gems 
Solitude <https://skisolitude.com/> and Snowbird <http://www.snowbird.com/> – 
the latter’s backcountry terrain provides a steep introduction to the famous 
Utah powder. A road-trip tour of them all is a true western adventure, and easy 
to do (Ski Safari  
<http://www.skisafari.com/Ski-USA-Utah-and-Las-Vegas-Safari-Details.aspx>has 
packages). The snow-averse can explore thejawdropping pink-rock national parks 
<http://utah.com/national-parks> south of the city – such as Bryce Canyon, 
Arches, Canyonlands and Zion.

Chianti, Italy

Rolling hills and racing bikes

 Chianti vineyards. Photograph: Alamy 
The Chianti wine region between Florence and Siena is 300 years old this year. 
Its wine is now regarded as Italy’s answer to bordeaux, with high-quality 
vintages offering spice, leather and tobacco notes. To mark three centuries of 
classic wines,one stage of the 2016 Giro d’Italia 
<http://www.cyclingnews.com/giro-ditalia/stage-9/> cycle race will take place 
in the Chianti hills: stage nine, on 15 May, will be a rolling 40km time trial 
through the region, starting in the ancient village of Radda, 29km north of 
Siena, and heading north to finish in Greve in Chianti. It’s a fantastically 
picturesque route, with, as Giro director Mauro Vegni gleefully points out, 
barely a metre of flat land. Make the most of it with a stay amid the vines at
Podere Val delle Corti <http://valdellecorti.it/> (from €120 a night 
self-catering), a producer of high-quality wine from 40-year-old vines, right 
in the chianti classico golden triangle. Owners Roberto and Lis let a 
beautifully restored two-bedroom cottage with fantastic views over vineyards 
and olive groves to the mountains. From here it’s a five-minute drive or 
half-hour walk into the village for the start of the race.

Yes, Poland’s fourth-largest city is a European capital of Culture in 2016 
(along with San Sebastián in Spain). But call it Rock-law, and you’re not 
invited to the party. It’s pronounced Vrots-waf, and you’ve got until 17 
January, when the official celebrations begin, to practise.

Headline events for the city’s year in the spotlight are a series of 12 
cultural weekends, starting with Awakening, a winter fiesta of exhibitions, 
concerts and a mass parade. The showstopper will be a performance on 23 
February by prolific movie composer Ennio Morricone, with 200 choristers and 
musicians .

“Puerto Rico you lovely island, island of tropical breezes …” sang Rosalia in 
West Side Story. It’s also an island of rum, palm trees, golden beaches, and a 
fascinating mix of US, Caribbean and Spanish cultures. And now it’s as easy to 
get to as anywhere in the Caribbean (and a lot cheaper than many destinations) 
sinceNorwegian 
<http://www.norwegian.com/uk/?gclid=CPTJnP3w8ckCFRQTGwodz-MIYA&gclsrc=aw.ds> 
launched direct flights from the UK to Puerto Rico’s capital, San Juan.

They will run in the winter, from November to April, with returns from Gatwick 
from £338. Once there, visitors can explore over 500 years of history in 
atmospheric Old San Juan, plus nightlife as lively as anywhere in this 
party-loving region.

Small, family-run guesthouses all over the island have doubles from about $80 
or, for a bit of glitz, Hilton group hotels in San Juan (The Caribe 
<http://www.caribehilton.com/>) and overlooking the Caribbean in the east of 
the island (El Conquistador <http://www.elconresort.com/>) have great 
post-Christmas deals, with huge doubles from around $200, and all the pools, 
beach bars and entertainment you could wish for.

Can you name a single ski jumper other than Eddie “The Eagle” Edwards? Thought 
not. As the first British ski jumper to take part in the winter Olympics, in 
Calgary in 1988, Eddie became a huge favourite with TV viewers and fans, for 
his determination and humour despite his relative lack of skill at the sport, 
glasses that fogged when he jumped, equipment that didn’t fit, and a 9kg weight 
disadvantage compared with the next-heaviest competitor.

If you’re inspired by Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards' story visit Calgary’s Olympic 
park and adjoining ski hills

Though he was Britain’s best at the time, a stunt-jumping record holder and 
ranked ninth in the world in amateur speed skiing, he admitted he’d entered the 
Olympic ski jump category because no one else was going to apply. He originally 
wanted to compete in downhill events but didn’t have the funds to enter.

As the worst in the competition, finishing last in the 70-metre and 90-metre 
eventsdespite breaking the UK record 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/04/reappraising-eddie-eagle-winter-olympics-ski-jumping>
, he became an underdog hero. Now his story will take flight on the silver 
screen when it is released in April: Eddie the Eagle, produced by Matthew 
Vaughn, has Taron Egerton in the lead role, and Hugh Jackman playing a 
fictional coach training him on Lake Placid.

If you’re inspired, visit Calgary’s Olympic park and adjoining ski hills (
winsport.ca <http://www.winsport.ca/>); or the Olympic Jumping Complex 
<http://www.whiteface.com/activities/olympic-jumping-complex-tour> (daily tours 
from $11 adult, $8 junior) in Lake Placid; or the filming locations in the 
Bavarian ski resort of Oberstdorf. At this last location, visitors can tryski 
jumping at the Impulse centre 
<https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://impulsecompany.de/&prev=search>
 (regular workshops around £117) or watch events at theErdinger Arena 
<http://www.oberstdorf.de/en/experience/erdinger-arena-ski-jump-arena.html>. 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen to the east was another location: hereguided tours of 
the ski jump <http://www.gapa.de/Town_Region_Sights_Olympic_Ski_Jump.html> cost 
€10 adult, €8 child. There are various ski jumping courses for beginner eaglets 
too, including inSaalfelden Leogang

significant modernist buildings, it was abandoned in 1980, but sound and light

 Hastings Pier in 1872 
Hastings Pier <http://www.hpcharity.co.uk/> has a roller coaster history: it 
opened in 1872, boomed in the 1930s and hosted bands including the Rolling 
Stones in the 1960s and 70s. It closed in 2008 after being damaged by a storm, 
then was almost destroyed by fire in 2010. But it is about to get a new lease 
of life, reopening on 21 March after a massive transformation, thanks in part 
to a £11.4m Heritage Lottery grant. The new-look pier will host farmers’ 
markets, urban sports, outdoor cinema and gigs – plus more traditional seaside 
promenading. And there’ll be a grand opening party in May.

 more easily. Yunnan province, in the south-west, has a compelling trio of 
attractions: dramatic mountain landscapes, unusually well-preserved historic 
towns and an exciting food culture. One way to discover it is by exploring the 
Tea Horse Road, or Southern Silk Road. A network of ancient paths along which 
caravans of traders once travelled (including, as you might have guessed, tea 
merchants), it snakes through spectacular landscapes, from Sichuan and Yunnan 
through Tibet, and south to Bengal. FromLux Resorts’

Getting to Toronto this year will be a bargain if you can snap up the lowest 
of the new low-cost flights. Icelandic airlineWow <http://wowair.co.uk/> is 
launching flights from Gatwick to Toronto (from 20 May) and Montreal (from 12 
May) from £198 return: so cheap because they go via Reykjavik. (It will also 
offer low-cost transatlantic flights from Gatwick to Los Angeles and San 
Francisco later in the summer, fares to be confirmed.)

And Canadian airline WestJet <http://www.westjet.com/guest/en/home.shtml> will 
launch its first direct flights from the UK to seven Canadian cities (Toronto, 
Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Edmonton, St John’s) from Gatwick on 6 
May, with fares from £414 return.Air Canada Rouge <http://flyrouge.com/> has a 
new direct route from Glasgow to Toronto between 13 June and 25 September, from 
£400 return, as well as seven routes from Gatwick from May. Destination 
Canada’s Nim Singh says 2016 will be a good year for a visit, “as air fares 
will be lower than they have been in a while, and the exchange rate is more 
favourable than in the past few years”.

For those who’ve done NYC, Toronto is a low-key alternative for a short 
transatlantic city break. Attractions include the expandedPride Toronto Festival
 <http://www.pridetoronto.com/> (24 June-3 July) and a new venue for the Museum 
of Contemporary Canadian Art, orMocca <http://mocca.ca/sterling/>, in the 
heritage Tower Automotive Building. The latest hip neighbourhood isThe Junction 
<http://thejunctionbia.ca/> , where cheap warehouse conversions are tempting 
artists and startups, leading to a flurry of vintage stores, pizza parlours, 
and organic and raw food outlets.

The centenary of Dadaism, a radical art movement founded in Zurich in 1916, 
will draw art lovers to Switzerland’s principal metropolis, with a series of 
soirées atCabaret Voltaire <http://www.cabaretvoltaire.ch/> (where the movement 
began) among the commemorations. Staying with art, the ninthManifesta 
<http://manifesta.org/> European contemporary art biennale, with seminars and 
exhibitions, will be held in Zurich in 2016, too. Best book early if you want 
to stay at hip new boutique hotelMarktgasse <http://www.marktgassehotel.ch/en/>
, (doubles from £170). Zurich is also, of course, a hit with skiers (there are 
270 resorts within a three-hour drive) and, less obviously, swimmers (in summer 
a string of lidos open around the city’s lake).

Boston’s streets have staged plenty of history, whether it’s revolutionary 
riding and marching (and tea throwing) or celebrating – when theRed Sox finally 
won another World Series <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflva8oSqbI> – but 
that may not feel like any preparation when the drivers of IndyCar take over

Labor Day weekend (2-4 September) the event will feature live bands, 
family-friendly attractions and driver appearances, building up to Verizon’s 
IndyCar Series race on the Sunday. The racecourse is centred on the city’s 
fast-developingSouth Boston waterfront 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/20/boston-fort-point-waterside-city-guide>

The racecourse for the Grand Prix of Boston will be centred on the city’s 
fast-developing South Boston waterfront

The intention is for the event to run annually until 2020. Tickets have yet to 
go on sale, but for more information and updates seeindycarboston.com 
<http://indycarboston.com/>.

If that’s not enough to rev your travel engines, consider the city’s famous 
marathon in April, theAmerican Craft Beer fest in May 
<http://www.beeradvocate.com/acbf/>, its film festivals in April and September, 
theseafood festival <http://bostonseafoodfestival.org/> in August and its book 
festival in October.

And, while Boston <http://www.bostonusa.com/> is a city that’s relatively easy 
to reach, from May things will get even easier and a little more affordable. 
The low-cost airlineNorwegian <http://www.norwegian.com/us> is to run flights 
from Gatwick to Boston four times a week, starting on 13 May. Fares on the 
route, which will use the 787 Dreamliner aircraft, will start from £179
