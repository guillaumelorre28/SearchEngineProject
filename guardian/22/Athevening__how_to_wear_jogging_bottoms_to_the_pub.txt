Fashion loves nothing more than a buzzword. Actually, scratch that, it loves a 
buzzword of a buzzword even more. See the latest example: athevening.

Most of us might resort to the confused emoji 
<http://emojipedia.org/confused-face/> when presented with such a word. But 
fashion insiders will recognise it as the brand-new incarnation ofathleisure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/01/athleisure-beyonce-topshop-style-trend-gym-ready-gear>
, that hybrid of gym and non-gym clothes that allows you to look like you work 
out even if getting up from the sofa between episodes of Making a Murderer is a 
stretch. Beyoncé’s into it; so is Alexander Wang, and it’s handy to justify 
staying in your tracksuit top all day. Athevening is, arguably, even more 
good/lazy. It’s basically wearing sporty, slouchy clothes for a night out.

Anyone who thinks this is an excuse to head out on the town in a pilled 
tracksuit is very much mistaken. This is fashion, we’re talking about; a place 
where there’s sometimes a sniff of reality but it’s all wrapped up in an extra 
bit of fabulousness and really expensive fabrics. You can’t buy athevening in 
Sports Direct; it isn’tladdi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/17/nu-lads-on-the-block-post-hipster>
sh or streetwear-influenced. In fact, it’s Victoria Beckham level polished. 
Wear with Stan Smiths, sliders or (if you’re brave) a heel. TheNew York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2015/12/24/fashion/trends-from-the-pre-fall-2016-collections/s/24UNBUTTONED-slide-334H.html>
 has linked the idea to pre-collections from distinctly uptown brands such as 
Bottega Veneta, Carolina Herrera and Michael Kors, and you could add Chloe’s 
catwalk tracksuits into the mix. All have created gym-friendly shapes – 
sweatshirts, baseball jackets, tracksuit pants – from distinctly 
non-gym-friendly fabrics, such as suede, satin and lace. It’s this that makes 
them more suitable for the kind of venues where you’re more likely to be toting 
a champagne flute, rather than a water bottle.

This can all be seen in a wider trend of eveningwear softening and becoming 
more relaxed and casual – see anything frompyjama dressing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/sep/22/how-to-wear-pyjamas-as-daywear-without-looking-daft>
 to fancy flats and Rihanna wearing a dressing gown on the red carpet. But, if 
the rise of its cousin athleisure in 2015 is anything to go by, athevening’s 
influence on our wardrobes this year could have much more of an impact. The 
shops have yet to fully embrace it, but early adopters will be mixing luxe 
sweatshirts found at J Crew and & Other Stories with posh joggers from Whistles 
and waiting for the rest to catch up. If anyone asks, just say you’re wearing 
2016’s latest look. Honest.
