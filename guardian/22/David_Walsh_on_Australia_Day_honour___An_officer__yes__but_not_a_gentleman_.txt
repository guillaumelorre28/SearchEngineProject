Museum of Old and New Art founder David Walsh has said he is “an officer, yes, 
but not a gentleman” after accepting anAustralia Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-day> honour.

In a post to the museum’s blog <http://monablog.net/category/david-walsh/>, 
Walsh expanded on his decision to accept the offer to be made an officer in the 
Order of Australia (AO).

“I suspect it will surprise you that I accepted. It certainly surprised me,” 
he wrote.

He noted the award came despite his “regular vociferous opposition” to many of 
the conservative local and federal governments’ policies, and that previous 
recipients of the officer award – the second-highest division – included Rolf 
Harris, Marcus Einfeld and Alan Bond.

“All, unsurprisingly, have since had their award revoked. Those bastards 
inoculate me against the insidious infection of self-satisfaction.”

The perks, he wrote, included being able to sign his name David Walsh

“If my life were a movie I’d like to think that it would be rated Adults 
Only,” he wrote.

It wasn’t a patch on British comedian Graeme Garden’s scheme to become an earl 
and receive an OBE, and thus become an Earlobe, he wrote – but that ceased to 
be a possibility when Australia abandoned the English honours system.

“I don’t know who nominated me, but based on the citation, he or she knows 
quite a bit about my activities, and approves,” Walsh wrote.

“Although the citation doesn’t include twice daily feeding, I suspect Christ 
the cat.”

As well as being an influential figure

 in the arts world, Walsh is a significant supporter of charities and sporting 
and education organisations.

The museum, which Walsh set up in 2007 with his fortune acquired through 
gambling, has been credited with significantlyboosting tourism
