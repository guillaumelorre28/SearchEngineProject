Robert Xie has been found guilty of murdering five members of his wife’s 
family at their North Epping home in July 2009.

Xie, 53, was convicted of using a hammer-like object to inflict horrific head 
injuries on his newsagent brother-in-law Min Lin, 45; his wife, Lily Lin, 43; 
her sister Irene, 39; and the Lins’ two sons, Henry, 12, and Terry, nine.

As the majority 11-to-one verdict

was handed down in the New South Wales supreme court on Thursday, Xie told the 
court he did not murder the Lin family. “I am innocent,” he told the jury as he 
left the court. His wife, Kathy, began to cry.

Lin’s mother wailed as she left court. Holding pictures of their loved ones 
outside court, she and her husband spoke to the media, mostly in Mandarin.

“My son has been avenged,” Feng Quin Zhu said in Mandarin. “The law has given 
me truth. God can see this.”


The verdict comes after Xie faced four trials and almost five years on remand 
in jail after the killings. Two previous trials were aborted for legal reasons 
and last year a jury was unable to reach a verdict in a nine-month-long trial.

The crown said Xie had been motivated by anger and resentment over his 
perceived “subordinate status” within the extended family and the uncritical 
regard given to his brother-in-law Min Lin. The crown also suggested there was 
a sexual motive.

Prosecutors also said Xie also had a financial incentive to carry out the 
killings and had gone to great lengths to gain control of his brother-in-law’s 
assets. These included the family’s newsagency, their North Epping home, a unit 
at Merrylands and a commercial unit which had just been leased.

The defence pointed to Xie’s alibi, supported by his wife, that he was in bed 
asleep with her when the crimes occurred in the nearby Lin residence and also 
said more than one assailant was likely to have been involved.

In the days after the murders, Xie and his wife made emotional public pleas 
for information to help solve the terrible crimes. He said he couldn’t imagine 
any reason why anyone would want to harm the family, describing his dead 
brother-in-law as a “very nice, hard-working, friendly person”.

Police, however, were busy building a case and arrested the former ear, nose 
and throat specialist in May 2011.

They found Xie had left the bed he shared with his wife in the early hours of 
18 July 2009, hours after attending a “normal” Friday-night dinner with his 
extended family.

The crown suggested Xie sedated his wife before creeping into the Lin 
residence around the corner. Lin lied at times to “assist” her husband, not 
because she knew he was guilty but because she was convinced he had been framed 
by police, said the prosecutor, Tanya Smith.

At the Lin house, Xie disconnected the electricity before making his way 
upstairs in the dark. He then used a hammer-like object to attack Min and Lily 
as they lay in their bed. He did the same to Lily’s sister Irene in the next 
room.

Blood splatters revealed a furious struggle took place in a third bedroom 
occupied by Xie’s nephews. But Henry and Terry still suffered the same shocking 
fate.

“This was a well-planned crime of a personal nature, by a single person who 
has carefully improvised a murder weapon,” Smith said.

Four of the victims died from the combined effects of blunt-force trauma and 
asphyxia, involving injuries indicative of neck compression.


The crown cited Xie’s medical skills, while Witness A, who was in jail with 
Xie, said Xie had showed him a particular location on the neck which was 
incapacitating.

Witness A also testified to seeing Xie, who always appeared calm in the dock, 
screaming at an elderly inmate who was using a walking frame. “The whole 
[exercise] yard stopped,” he said. “It was like zero to 100.”

The defence barrister, Robert Webb, had argued the “highly organised” and 
brutal execution involved multiple assailants, also contending that Xie had got 
on well with his relatives.

But the crown said the boys and Irene were “collateral damage”, or secondary 
victims, who may have woken up when the couple were being murdered.

“The crown case is that he came to kill Min and Lily and was prepared to kill 
others should the need arise.”

Sentencing submissions are expected on February 10.
