Most Januarys are broadly similar. The lunchtime wait in line at M&S to 
exchange that dodgy Christmas gift cardigan, the treadmills jammed with runners 
trying to remember how to work the controls, the Dry January martyrs making a 
massive song and dance about every Diet Coke in the pub.

But this particular January feels tangibly different. Seldom has a new year 
begun with a zeitgeist united in such bloody-minded optimism. The social media 
mood on New Year’s Day was a curious mix of blitz spirit (“We can do this!”) 
and VE Day demob-fever (“We did it!”). The afterburn of 2016 is being felt in 
our collective determination to bring a better year into being through sheer 
force of will. Last year had more than its fair share of obscure buzzwords –

 tohygge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/18/hygge-a-soothing-balm-for-the-traumas-of-2016>
 – but the first of this year is one that everyone can rally around. Optimism 
is so hot right now.

This is big picture stuff, but style is part of it, because on an individual 
level even big picture stuff gets expressed in small ways. Profound statements 
are posted on Instagram, and liked by your immediate family. And what you wear 
to face 2017 is a statement, too. In Susie Boyt’s bookMy Judy Garland Life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/28/biography>, she writes that one 
of the lessons she learned from her heroine is that “Glamour is a moral 
stance.” Dressing to cheer and brighten the world in 2017 – whether by red 
lipstick or a Choose Life T-shirt – is a generous act. And so it is that the 
look of 2017 has a different slant to what went before. More cheerful, more 
colourful, more outward looking. With the benefit of hindsight, the athleisure 
trend that dominated the first half of 2016 seems to signify not simply the 
wholesome, healthsome vibe it represented at the time, but something about 
self-obsession and a brazenness about celebrating the shallows of humanity, 
which played out on a meta scale later in the year.

The across-the-board embrace of optimism chic as we begin the new year is also 
fashion’s way of getting back on to the front foot. From Christopher Bailey 
backing the remain cause to Anna Wintour campaigning for Hillary Clinton, the 
industry was at its most overtly political in decades last year, and ended on 
the losing side. But instead of retreating into default black – being jaded and 
aloof, and taking refuge in style as classic tropes rather than engaging with 
fashion in the here and now – fashion has come out on the doorstep for 2017 in 
glorious technicolour. So: here’s what to wear, now that positive thinking is 
the new black. Accessorise with a cost-effective lunchbox of leftovers and that 
shiny new gym card.

Don’t think we need spell out the symbolism here. The item that encapsulates 
the new optimism best of all is the Gucci rainbow sweater, which became a 
modern classic after it appeared on the Gucci runway, and shortly thereafter on 
Alexa Chung, in 2015. If you have the funds to buythis sweater

, do it. Gap’s Happy Stripe is a cheap and cheerful alternative at a fraction 
of the price, now sold out online, although you could – optimistically! – try 
your luck on a sale rail.

The first iconic style image of 2017 is Emma Stone dancing with Ryan Gosling 
in a yellow dress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone>
, in the poster for Oscar-buzz movie La La Land. Mary Zophres, the film’s 
costume designer, has said that she wanted the brightly coloured dresses of the 
film to “evoke some kind of emotion that lands in the subconscious or 
conscious”. The dress is not a high-fashion yellow, but the yellow of canaries 
and squeezy mustard and those light-up hexagons on Blockbusters, and this is 
exactly what makes it jolly.

 won’t arrive till later this year, but the look will be everywhere long before 
that. The fashion obsession with the show that saw the cast hanging out at 
Louis Vuitton HQ at Paris fashion week has fuelled a fuzzy nostalgia for 1980s 
dressing as remembered through Spielberg-tinted glasses. Think: varsity jackets 
over check shirts, backpacks with baseball caps and oversized denim jackets

The February issue of British Vogue <http://www.vogue.co.uk/>, out this week, 
praises the return of the kitten heel. After almost a decade in the long grass, 
the mini-heel is back as a serious fashion option this year. The most prized 
options will be those with theDior-branded ribbon slingbacks 
<http://www.instyle.co.uk/fashion/trends/celebrities-front-row-at-paris-fashion-week/jennifer-lawrence-at-the-christian-dior>
, orManolo Blahnik’s collaboration with Vetements 
<http://www.instyle.com/fashion/shoes/shop-satin-shoes-vetements-manolo-blahnik>
 in jewel-coloured satin, but the options will be endless. The surprisingly 
impressive boost a kitten heel gives to your silhouette, combined with 
walkability, will put a spring in your step. And the name is perfect for a new 
year of cheer: goodbye killer heels, hello kitten heels.

 Women taking up more room: Balenciaga showcases the power shoulder. 
Photograph: REX/Shutterstock 
The ubiquity of the off-the-shoulder trend in 2016 belied the fact that those 
clothes were more challenging to wear than they looked. A top that relies on 
your upper arms being pinned to your sides makes it tricky to drive, or cook, 
or dance. This year, the lady-shoulder will be a focal point once more, but 
this time padded, pointed, ruffled or possibly all three. Shown at its finest 
on theBalenciaga catwalk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/02/demna-gvasalia-reinvigorates-balenciaga-with-strategic-disrespect>
, this is a look that is about women taking up more room, rather than being 
encouraged to take up as little as possible. In a Trump world, a woman in a 
power shoulder takes on a newly subversive quality.
