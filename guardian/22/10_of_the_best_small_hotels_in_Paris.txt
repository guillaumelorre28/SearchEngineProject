Hotel de la Paix, 14e

This calm retreat in the heart of Montparnasse lets guests step out of the 
bustle and into a foyer full of natural light. A blend of old and new creates 
an individual, warm atmosphere: attractive flea market finds, antiques, 
characterful dark or honey-coloured wood furniture and headboards. Bedrooms 
have art, fresh flowers and splashes of colour from stylish fabrics; bathrooms 
are gleaming. Families and groups can choose communicating rooms. Have 
breakfast in your room or join the buffet in the dining room.

This Parisian guesthouse and its quiet garden rub shoulders with Le 
Corbusier’s Villa Jeanneret. Revel in fine art and antiques, ancient and modern 
all beautifully put together by friendly and super-chic hosts; they live on the 
top floor with three well-behaved teenagers and a small dog. Bedrooms are 
sumptuous in their fineobjets and lovely fabrics (the largest has its own 
garden door), wonderful walk-in mosaic showers and fabulous washbasins. Beds 
are superb, towels deluxe, breakfast delicious and there’s a grand piano.

Poetry moves from the pavements of Paris into the cosiest new Left Bank hotel 
in town. Coming from the television industry, Laurent and Charlotte wanted to 
echo the rich history of Montparnasse. Modigliani’s studio was on the top 
floor, each room has a fine art book for guests to peruse, themes are art deco, 
Man Ray, music hall, high fashion. They asked renowned street artist, Jérôme 
Mesnager if he would join their new venture and he brought a small army of his 
emblematic “white bodies” to dance across, climb up and generally enliven this 
tiny box of contemporary luxury. There are sculptures, too, by Charlotte’s 
well-known mother. Bedrooms are small and perfectly formed.

Owners Georges and Charlotte Ferrero cleverly create a private house vibe in 
their boutique hotel. Style and elegance are their trademarks, and contemporary 
touches mix with lovely old things in an effortless way. Sink into a big sofa 
or bright orange chair in reception; relax by glowing lamps and vases of 
flowers. The breakfast lounge is a wonderful space to sit in, too, with shelves 
of books and sculptures, china and vibrant art. Bedrooms vary in size: the 
biggest are the suites on the sixth floor, with sitting rooms adorned with art; 
some have balconies with rooftop views. Next door isLes Botanistes 
<http://lesbotanistes.com/>, named best bistro in Paris in 2014.

The first owner of this place was a passionate beekeeper so he perhaps picked 
a place with a bit of nature as a centrepiece. When you step off the smart 
shopping street you can certainly believe that Passy was just a village a 
hundred years ago. Breathe deeply in this calm atmosphere, a restful mix of 
old-fashioned and contemporary styles. Lounge in the glassed-in veranda, where 
you can see a cute gardener’s cottage across the tiny cobbled yard. The family 
rooms have large windows, some of which provide an excellent view of the Eiffel 
Tower. Lovely staff, too.

Les Balcons has the lot: an idea of service that produces tea on winter 
afternoons and a feast of a breakfast – that’s free on your birthday. Having 
decorated their art nouveau hotel by taking inspiration from the floral 1890s 
staircase windows, Jean-François and manager Marie run the place with great 
charm. Rooms are simple yet pleasing. The five big family rooms have smart 
décor and modern lamps, parquet floors and decent bathrooms. Some rooms are 
tiny but the space is used judiciously; amusing prints decorate the walls and 
front rooms have balconies with window boxes. Remarkable value, super people, 
and bang in the heart of the Latin Quarter.

Smack on the back doorstep of Saint Sulpice church, this hotel is on one of 
those tiny magic streets untouched by time. You might miss the door if you are 
not careful: it looks more an entryway into an aristocratic 18th-century home. 
The womb-like salon has deep red papered walls, screened mahogany bookcases, a 
white faïence stove, Chinese jars and some bottles of French liqueur tempting 
guests to an evening apéritif. There’s no reception desk to speak of here, just 
a friendly spirit behind a table to hand out keys to your small but cosy room.

Behind its imposing old doors, the Millésime is welcoming, cosy and friendly. 
The hotel is undergoing a bit of a transformation and now has a Scandi-chic 
feel with blond wood, clean lines and calm colours. Smart, comfortable bedrooms 
vary in size but are never too tiny, and have charcoal curtains and throws and 
sleek white linen. Three rooms open on to the leafy patio. Splurge on the 
spacious top-floor suite, with its high ceilings and windows overlooking 
historic towers and domes. In the heart of the Left Bank, this is one of our 
favourite city hotels, and decent value for Saint- Germain.

Look down the throats of gargoyles, soak up the history. Revolutionaries 
printed their newsletter in the cellar of this building, which inspired 
Puccini’s Café Momus in La Bohême. Everywhere, antiques and oriental rugs 
complement the firm beds and perfect bathrooms. Front rooms look along to the 
Louvre; others give on to a light-filled patio. Top-floor junior suites have 
space for a sofabed, pastel walls, exuberant upholstery and heaps of light from 
mansard windows. The sense of service is highly developed and, as there is no 
dining room, breakfast comes to you.

Make haste if you want to experience the last breath of that dying species, 
the two-star Parisian hotel. The Jeanne d’Arc, always one of the friendliest 
and best-placed of the bunch, has a talented new owner who will soon be 
wielding her design flair and filing for an upgrade. She has already lifted the 
façade with glorious torrents of geraniums. Hurry if you want to enjoy fresh 
croissants beneath the extravagantly kitsch mirror in the airy breakfast room, 
a landmark for generations of guests. The hallway has already been beautified 
and the junk-shop-style furniture is heading for an update, but not at the 
price of the essence of the place, its cosy friendliness and superb value for 
the trend-conscious Marais.
