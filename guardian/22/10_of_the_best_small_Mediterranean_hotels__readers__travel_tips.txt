GREECE

Winning tip: The Good Life, Syros


Picture a Cycladic island 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/12/greek-island-holiday-guide-the-cyclades>
 that no one seems to know. It’s easy to get to, easy to explore, with sandy 
sheltered beaches almost empty in summer. The restaurants have real chefs 
without Mykonos prices and the locals are genuinely happy to see you. This is 
Syros, and our hotel is The Good Life in Poseidonia. We found it on an organic 
farm site, but although it is in a vineyard, with olives and figs, the restored 
traditional stone cottages are seriously comfortable. The Australian owners 
live nearby and make sure you experience the best of the island: wines, walks, 
beaches, the many music festivals. You can cook at home (the kitchens are 
luxurious) using vegetables from the gardens, or stroll down to the water’s 
edge for a choice of tavernas.

A beautifully restored 16th-century Venetian manor house with idyllic 
courtyard garden, Casa Vitae is a winner. Not only for its location, 
architecture and breakfasts, but also for the way its staff personify the Greek 
spirit of hospitality. Manager Maria, formerly a lecturer, was a casualty of 
the country’s economic downturn and relocated to Crete from Athens. Here, 
exemplary customer service (finding a late-night optician to repair my specs) 
and friendliness (inviting us to a restaurant with her family) makes a stay so 
rewarding.

This little pension on the tiny Greek island of Kastellorizo is the Greece of 
a time gone by: a perfect horseshoe bay lined by pastel-coloured buildings, 
crystal-clear waters, fishermen fixing their nets, smoking and playing cards. 
Owners Monika and Damien are welcoming and sincere. This is a place to escape 
the world, appreciate the beauty in life and let lazy days drift away. They 
have the cutest little olive garden restaurant for lazy evenings chatting over 
wine. Ball-ache to get there, but harder to leave.

We love this small B&B apartment development at Tersanas on the Akrotiri 
peninsula near Chania. Comfortable rooms open out into a garden filled with 
fruit trees and flowers, with swimming pool and tennis court and views across 
the bay. It attracts quiet relaxed visitors, the staff are friendly and the 
sandy beaches and great traditional restaurants are within walking distance or 
short drive . Been here four times now over past seven years.

The location, rooms and restaurant in this hotel are all fabulous, as is the 
view from the breakfast terrace. It’s on the main street in the old town but 
you would not know it from the quiet rooms. It’s also close to the old port, 
diving centre and five miles of beach, with an immaculate, well-maintained 
pool. It’s family-owned and run.

Casas de Parauta are scattered whitewashed villas in the tiny village of 
Parauta. The inside is wonderful: more white walls, minimalist designs, 
wood-burning fireplaces, country-style kitchen for serious cooking and inviting 
beds. There are rooftop terraces for looking out at the galaxy that can’t be 
seen just 40 minutes away in the resorts of the Costa del Sol. Once you turn 
the lights off at night you are in pitch darkness. I had the best sleep ever. 
The village pool is yours to use and the views across the Sierra de las Nieves 
are stunning. Walking through the Sierra is so peaceful, aside from the odd 
eagle. Ana, who speaks great English, can suggest hiking routes. Outside of all 
but the busiest times villas can be had for little more than €60.

Port des Torrent is a lovely quiet bay just south of San Antonio. This 
two-star hotel is on a quiet junction 200 metres from the beach and is friendly 
and clean with an authentically local vibe. The rooms are simple, all have 
balconies and the hotel will supply a small fridge on request. There is a large 
reception area with a bar/restaurant, and front courtyard and a terrace next to 
the pool at the rear. The well-kept pool has ample sunbeds. A decent 
continental breakfast is optional.

I don’t think I have ever experienced anything like Caroline’s B&B on the tiny 
island of Ortigia, the historical centre of Siracusa in Sicily. Every detail in 
her one-bedroom B&B makes the place feel unique – including the art in the 
bathroom. Caroline is friendly and full of stories – you will want to sit on 
her roof terrace garden, with views over the sea, chatting all day. She’s out 
early to the market to get fresh ricotta cheese for breakfast, and to the 
bakery to getIris (deep fried ricotta-filled pastries). We ate in her stylish 
kitchen, with homemade lemon jam and bread and freshly brewed coffee and fresh 
orange juice.

Hotel Miramare, in the walled city of Noli, offers great views over the 
Ligurian sea from its balconies. Ancient seafaring families run this charming, 
stone-walled three-star place with just a few rooms, adding to the friendly 
intimated atmosphere. Try the deliciousminestrone di mare on the dinner menu or 
nibble at freshly made foccacia and olive bread for breakfast as the palm trees 
sway and the salty sea air whets your appetite.

This charming family-owned hotel clings to the cliffs of the Amalfi coast. 
From the roadside you take a lift down and emerge in a tunnel bores through the 
rocks, which leads to the rooms, all sporting picture-perfect sea views. 
Half-board deals with candlelit dinner on the panoramic terrace are good value.
