Riders at the Road World Championships in Doha have complained of extreme 
conditions causing havoc following the crash of the Dutch cyclist Anouska 
Koster.

During the women’s team time trial, which began at 2.10pm with temperatures in 
Qatar nearing 40C, Koster, who rides for Rabo-Liv, appeared to suddenly lose 
all control and veered off line, flipping over her handlebars. She was helped 
back on to her bike looking extremely dazed and managed to finish the race.

Her team later announced that Koster had avoided any fractured bones or 
serious injuries but the 23-year-old’s team-mates said she had been fortunate.

“The heat in Qatar is extreme,” her team-mate Roxane Knetemann said of the 
country set to host football’s 2022 World Cup. “I cannot explain how 
excruciating it feels to be riding 40km through the desert. You’d expect 
organisers and the UCI to have some knowledge about cycling.

“If you send out people for a team time trial in this heat, make sure there 
are at least 10 ambulances ready to look after the riders. The UCI didn’t think 
this through. The heat, it’s just not to do and certainly not in a time trial. 
It’s like a sauna.”

Meanwhile, the US rider Chloe Dygert was violently sick as her team approached 
the finish line.

Olympic road race gold medallist Anna van der Breggen, who broke her pelvis in 
the same event in Spain two years ago, revealed her she had been concerned 
leading up to the race, which was won by the Boels-Dolmans team.

“This is a combination of fatigue and the heat,” Van der Breggen said. “When 
you see how Anouska is then we should be glad that she came across the finish 
line. I’ve never ridden in such heat.”
