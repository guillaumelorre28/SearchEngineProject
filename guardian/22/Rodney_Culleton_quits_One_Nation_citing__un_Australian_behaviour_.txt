Senator Rodney Culleton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/rodney-culleton> has quit One 
Nation, citing “personal attacks and un-Australian behaviour” towards him by 
the One Nation team and the party’s policy-making on the run.

In a statement released late on Sunday night, Culleton said he would continue 
to representWestern Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/western-australia> “independently 
of One Nation” but leaving open the possibility of joining another party.

He said the One Nation leader Pauline Hanson’s public criticism of him had 
been accompanied by demands for his resignation and control over his diary and 
office by Hanson and her chief of staff, James Ashby.

Hanson told Channel Seven’s Sunrise that Culleton had failed to attend party 
room meetings and was quitting because One Nation refused to pay his legal 
bills in the high court and bankruptcy proceedings.

“Rod Culleton is a pain in my backside. I am glad to see the back of him,” 
Hanson said, confirming she had told him she wanted him to resign, but only 
after he had asked her.

Culleton’s resignation caps off months of instability in which Hanson agreed 
to the Senate referral

He had previously said that he would serve his term with One Nation

The lower house MP Bob Katter has consistently supported Culleton, including 
attending both of his high court appearances, and has left the door open to 
take him on board Katter’s Australia party if One Nation “ratted” on him.

In the statement, Culleton said policy decisions had been “run in morning 
media, with no consultation, discussion or agreement from the party room”.

“Personal attacks and undermining, un-Australian behaviour towards myself and 
my team, [have] been ongoing and terms dictated to the team.”

Culleton did not regularly attend One Nation party-room meetings, citing other 
business and preparation for his high court case, and at times was unaware of 
policy changes includingthe party’s willingness to accept a backpacker tax of 
15% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/25/rod-culleton-pauline-hanson-support-high-court-referral-backpacker-tax>
.

He said the backpacker tax was a “case in point” of lack of consultation 
because the 15% compromise,first reported by Guardian Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/24/senate-votes-for-jacqui-lambies-suggestion-of-105-backpacker-tax>
, was “dictated” to him despite his clear intent to match New Zealand’s level 
of 10.5%.

Hanson said it was “completely incorrect” that there had been no consultation 
on policy. Describing the party’s daily meetings, she said staffers and 
parliamentarians discussed upcoming legislation and “we are briefed on which 
way we’re going to go on that legislation”.

Culleton said he had been “consistently committed” to One Nation policies, 
including supporting the Australian bid for Kidman station. Hanson backedthe 
successful Gina Rinehart Shanghai CRED joint venture 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/scott-morrison-approves-sale-kidman-rinehart-chinese-joint-venture>
.

“I can no longer tolerate the lack of party support for my positive 
initiatives, including the recent abandonment of One Nation’s pre-election 
commitment to a banking royal commission,” he said.

Hanson announced she had negotiated with the government for a Senate inquiry 
to include banks’ repossession of agricultural land due to loan defaults, a key 
plank of Culleton’s mooted royal commission. She said she had negotiated the 
inquiry to help farmers now and “further down the track” would get a full royal 
commission. She accused Culleton of “bullying the prime minister” by being 
“demanding” and “over the top” in a meeting about the banking sector.

Culleton criticised Hanson, Malcolm Roberts and Brian Burston for not backing 
a successful Senate motion calling for more evidence relating to the referral 
of his eligibility to the high court.

Pauline Hanson says she can’t work with One Nation’s Rod Culleton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/dec/06/pauline-hanson-says-she-cant-work-with-one-nations-rod-culleton-video>
The senator, who had been convicted of larceny in his absence at the time of 
the election but the conviction was later annulled, said One Nation had 
approved the referral “without evidence”.

He said when Hanson recruited him, she promised One Nation would be different 
to the major parties, and allow its members to vote on conscience. “One Nation 
promised to be different but in practice has failed to deliver on this and many 
other fronts.”

Culleton said he remained committed to represent his constituents to the best 
of his ability, and would deliver the “best outcome for Australians”.

“In supporting One Nation policy, I would have thought it reasonable to expect 
some measure of support or at the very least, some discretion and respect from 
the party leader and my party colleagues – there has been none,” he concluded.

Hanson said she had no say over Culleton’s replacement. In an earlier 
interview she had noted that if the high court found him ineligible, a recount 
electioncould result in his brother-in-law winning the seat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/06/pauline-hanson-rod-culleton-one-nation-backpacker-tax>
, which would mean the party would be on “the same merry-go-round”.

On Monday Hanson apologised to voters for choosing Culleton. “It is a shame 
this has happened,” she said. “I am sorry to the people. I did not expect him 
to be this type of man.”
