You may already know the grim statistics: every day, 17,000 children 
<http://data.unicef.org/child-mortality/under-five> under the age of five die; 
nearly half of them are newborn babies.

Almost all these deaths – which occur in just a handful of countries – could 
be prevented. The inequalities between countries are stark. A child born in 
Angola is 84 times more likely to die before the age of five than a child born 
in Luxembourg.

What are the millennium development goals on child mortality and maternal 
health all about?

Contrary to what you might think, this is not just an issue in poor countries. 
It applies to poor communities everywhere, including those in some of the 
richest countries.


Every child’s life is precious. But right now, a child’s chance of survival is 
determined almost entirely by luck: where he or she is born, the income and 
education level of the parents, and other social and environmental factors that 
have a direct impact on health.

This means that despite the progress achieved, we have failed to reach the 
ones who need it the most – the poorest, the most disadvantaged, the most 
vulnerable. It is inexcusable that so many children die because they miss out 
on basic, cost-effective health services.

So what do we need to fill this equity gap? 

 * A skilled health workforce. Many newborn deaths can be prevented by having 
a trained birth attendant nearby, someone with knowledge of simple, life-saving 
methods such askangaroo mother care 
<http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/9241590351/en/> and 
exclusive breastfeeding 
<http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/>, the latter 
of which is the single most effective intervention in high mortality settings. 
Skilled health workers are critical for providing care during childbirth and in 
the crucial week that follows, when more than 40% of child deaths occur. 
 * Bringing care close to home. A key strategy in reaching the “unreachable” 
in remote areas is to make care more readily available by training local 
community members to give basic healthcare and treat common childhood 
illnesses. Antibiotics would prevent most child deaths from pneumonia and other 
infections. But access to these medicines remains difficult in the places where 
child death rates are highest. Removing legal barriers that prevent health 
workers from administering antibiotics for pneumonia would also save children’s 
lives. 
We must bridge the gaps ​​created by inequality and ​create conditions for a 
healthy, sustainable future for every child

 * Political commitment. Most important is political will and providing 
universal coverage to vulnerable populations. Countries such as India and 
Brazil, with strong economic disparities, are tackling inequalities and have 
set up special programmes to ensure free essential care to pregnant women, 
babies and young children. The results have been remarkable. Brazil’s infant 
mortality rate dropped from 47.1 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 1990 to 
20 in 2007. And in India over the same period, under-five child mortality 
dropped 54.4% – from 118 to 52 deaths for every 1,000 live births.

I was recently in New York, where the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon 
convened world leaders to commit to astrategy for women’s, children’s and 
adolescents’ health 
<http://www.who.int/life-course/partners/global-strategy/renewing-the-global-strategy/en/>
. Ban brings strong global leadership to this approach, which looks to save 
lives through a focus on equity and human rights, and will serve as a platform 
for implementing the sustainable development goals, which will be adopted at 
the UN general assembly in New York in September.

As we move beyond the era of the millennium development goals, we, the global 
community, must seize the opportunity to work together. The gaps created by 
inequality must be bridged, and the conditions created for a healthy, 
sustainable future for every infant, child and person, regardless of where they 
live. We need action at the highest level, with commitments and resources to 
back it up.

Let’s not forget that action does not only rely on political commitment or the 
availability of medical knowhow. It must be founded on a recognition that our 
newborns and young children are not mere recipients of care, but are “rights 
holders” of their own, with legal entitlements to survival and the highest 
possible standards of health and care. Both in law and in practice. For all 
children. Without discrimination.
