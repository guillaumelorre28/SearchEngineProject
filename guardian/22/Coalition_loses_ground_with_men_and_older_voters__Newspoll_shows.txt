Older voters are turning against the Turnbull government while Labor is 
enjoying a lift in its standing with men, a Newspoll analysis shows.

The analysis of 8,508 voters in Newspoll surveys taken for the Australian from 
October to December reveals a seven-percentage-point plunge in the primary vote 
for theCoalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> among 
voters over 50 since the 2 July election.

Support for the government in the largest voting demographic has fallen from 
49.9% to 43%, with two-thirds of the lost vote shifting to Labor and one-third 
to independents and minor parties.

The analysis shows the voting margin of almost 20 points that the Coalition 
enjoyed over Labor among over-50 voters at the election has been cut to just 
eight points.

The dip has come as the government faced criticism over an overhaul of 
superannuation taxes, changes to the pension assets test and aged care reforms.

The analysis also shows the near eight-point lead for the Coalition among men 
at the election has been halved, with Labor’s support among men rising to 36% 
against the coalition’s 40%.

The Coalition’s lead among women is down 1.7 points to 38% while Labor’s has 
risen 0.4% to 37%.

The government, however, has posted a 1.6-point gain among voters aged 18 to 
34 and held its position among voters aged from 35 to 49.
