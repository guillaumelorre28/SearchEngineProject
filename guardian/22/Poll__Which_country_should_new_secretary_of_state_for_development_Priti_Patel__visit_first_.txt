The international development community is currently abuzz with what Priti

.

Where she chooses for her first official trip abroad representing DfID will be 
one of the first indicators about what areas of the humanitarian and 
development landscape she might prioritise: emergency assistance, global health 
or gender-based violence? Which fragile states or low-income setting would 
offer the best insights into these?
