David Hicks


Hicks was a leading interior designer whose mise-en-scene designs and mission 
statement quote (“the excitement of today is the freedom of the individual to 
make his own choice and the vast range of possibilities from which he may 
choose“) inspired theJW Anderson show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/feb/20/london-fashion-week-highlights-from-todays-shows>
. The theme of the show – the deconstruction of the cocktail-dress-as-armour – 
was true to Hicks’ mix’n’match aesthetic playfulness, featuring mint 
ice-cream-colouredbouffants

 Brrrap battle … Lady Sov and the Caitlin Price show. Photograph: Rex Features 
Last heard brrr-apping up the trailer for Trainwreck 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxnhBPoIx4>, the sartorial spectre of fallen 
grime toughie Lady Sovereign loomed large at Caitlin Price’s Fashion East show. 
Sovereign’s bad-girl style –side ponytail 
<https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/3/5254651_cd62d951dc.jpg>, non-bovvered 
expression, pristine trackies – seemed like an extension of what was happening 
atNYFW 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/16/good-girl-bad-new-york-hoodies-grunge-pvc-rihanna-alexander-wang-marijuana-leaf-skirts-vetements>
. But Price managed to bottle a very specifically British sense of tough 
clubland energy – mixingathleisure  
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/feb/12/athleisure-key-fashion-trends-of-the-season-in-pictures>
wearables withunexpected cut-outs 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/fashion-east/slideshow/collection#31>
 and a sense that something dodgy might be going down in the loos of the club. 
Sov would have been proud.

For the dreadful crime of putting the pep back into Henry VIII’s step (and, 
um, maybe sleeping with her brother 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boleyn,_2nd_Viscount_Rochford#Trial_and_execution>
), his second wife Anne Boleyn was beheaded. Thankfully, fashion is a much more 
forgiving master, because Boleyn – as a freedom-pushing sexual rebel – was the 
perfect muse for Topshop Unique’s collection. The portrait of her with the 
personalised “B” necklace wasmodernised 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/topshop-unique/slideshow/collection#40>
: a gothic choker sat atop a sheer black top and pearly chelsea boots.

Like some of the more conservative pieces in the Topshop Unique 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/topshop-unique/slideshow/collection#23>
 collection, Mulberry riffed on the ideas of Britishness spotlighted in 
Shakespeare’s plays (he quoted Othello in the show notes), and there was 
definitely something Elizabethan-dandy about theirhigh-necked cape jackets 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/mulberry/slideshow/collection#1>
. This theatrical thread and potential jazz hands is no coincidence: it’s the
400th anniversary <http://www.shakespeare400.org/> of the big guy’s death this 
year. Great news for those of us who like their fashion references really, 
really retro

 Myths in the making … McQueen and the Unicorn emoji. Photograph: Getty Images 
One of the best emojis ever 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/16/style-stars-2015-set-fashion-agenda>
, due to its multiple meanings, including everything from “currently am 
experiencing sensory overload due to living in a waking dream” to “I’m really, 
really drunk”. Sarah Burton at McQueen was clearly referencing the former with 
their nightsprite-channelling collection, the highlight of which was the luxe 
gold unicorn dress. HalfVelvet Goldmine

response was ;)
