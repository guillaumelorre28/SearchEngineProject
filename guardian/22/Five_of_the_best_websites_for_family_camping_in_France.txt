Founded in 1959, Les Castels brings together beautiful sites and estates 
across France, with 38 to choose from. The smart four- and five-star sites 
offer different styles of accommodation: chalets, treehouses, gypsy caravans – 
or apartments, for those who prefer to enjoy the great outdoors from a more 
solid base – in a choice of seaside, mountains and the countryside settings. 
Many of the sites – which have a sustainable environmental approach – are 
situated around grand chateaux. These include the 15th-century Château de 
Boisson, which is just inland from Montpellier and has its own swimming pools, 
workshops and entertainment for children and is an excellent base for hiking, 
climbing and canoeing.

Most of Sandaya’s 11 sites are along the Mediterranean coast, though it also 
offers locations in Normandy, Brittany and Aquitaine. This year the company 
celebrates its fifth anniversary and has three new campsites, including Douce 
Quiétude on the French Riviera, a leafy site with pool and waterpark and also a 
good base for exploring townssuch as Saint-Tropez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/nov/01/chef-nina-parker-st-tropez-france>
 and Cannes. Another new campsite is Blue Bayou in Valras, in the Languedoc 
region, right on the coast and nearby seaside resort Valras-Plage, which has 
more than four kilometres of beach which is perfect for hiking and watersports. 
Accommodation ranges from mobile homes with private hot tubs to six-person 
bungalows.

 One of Riviera Villages’ three holiday camps in Saint-Tropez 
If you’re looking for a holiday camp with a little more than the usual family 
fun park aesthetic, Riviera Villages has accommodation in wooden lodges among 
exotic gardens, with palm trees and plants adding to an easy-going, tropical 
feel. The “Tiki Lounge”, for example, has a private terrace with small pool and 
wooden decking area, and three bedrooms. The three holiday resorts are all in 
the gulf of Saint-Tropez, and all on the beachfront. While offering a fun, 
family ambience, with plenty of sports and activities, these should also appeal 
to those after a more peaceful, adult-focused break.
