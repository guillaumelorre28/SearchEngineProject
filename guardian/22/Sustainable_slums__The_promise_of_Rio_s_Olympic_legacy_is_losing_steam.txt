One year from today, the city of Rio de Janeiro will kick off the 2016 Olympic 
Games, bringing tens of thousands of spectators to the city, and billions of 
dollars into Brazil. Traditionally, in the run-up to everyOlympic Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games>, the host city makes a big 
show of highlighting the positive impact the Games will have on the city’s 
infrastructure, services, and economy.

In some cases, those promises bear fruit: Barcelona is widely recognized as a 
successful example

 of leveraging Olympics-sized spending for the greater good. Residents of many 
other Games host cities, however, have found the experience to bea mixed 
blessing

 at best. Starting today, we are taking a look at how Rio is preparing for the 
Games, and how these preparations will affect businesses and people across the 
city.

One aspect of the Olympics legacy touted by the municipal government is in 
urbanizing Rio’s favelas – the sprawling slums throughout the city. Widespread 
development and improvements in the favelas could usher in a huge economic boom 
for the Brazil’s construction industry – not to mention improving residents’ 
quality of life.

But the results to date haven’t lived up to expectations, and experts question 
if the program will achieve its goals.

“Soon after [it was launched], the program lost strength,” said Orlando Santos 
Junior, a professor at the Institute of Urban and Regional Research and 
Planning. “It ceased to be a priority to the municipal government, with no 
official explanation.”
