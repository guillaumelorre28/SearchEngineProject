Would you still rather be an old man’s sweetheart than a young man’s fool?

Thanks for all the questions! I did the best I could. I love you!

Yeah, I was. Duane has a Jesus-people kind of look, flower children sort of 
thing, he can in with no shirt on and flowers round his neck. No shoes, hair 
all the way down. He sat in lotus style in the middle of the floor, with a Coke 
bottle on his thumb playing the guitar. He blew us away, I was in awe: who was 
this person? And Rick was so traditional: "If you don't get that hippie out of 
here..." He would stay outside sun-worshipping, looking up at the sun playing 
his guitar. I said you should sign him now; Rick didn't care, he couldn't deal 
with it. It was great being around all those people, it was wonderful.

"I think Beyonce gives her soul to women"

hollymusic <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3674580> has a great 
question:

If she could get an old school songwriter - and a new writer to write her a 
song each . Who would they be?

I think Beyonce would be the new songwriter. And the old-school: George 
Jackson. He wrote a lot of my best songs. Put them together, you'd get some 
great combinations.

I think Beyonce gives her soul to women. I like the way she expresses herself, 
it's a hurt-filled kind of independence - she's going through pain, but she can 
make it without you; I'm hooked on you, but I don't have to be. I can make it 
on my own, but I don't want to. She's a great songwriter.

Canzetta is on my birth certificate. Mavis Staples called me Candi, that's who 
started it. We were teenagers together, and she said that's just too long! She 
had that bubbly personality, she's always up. She said I'm just gonna call you 
Candi, cause you sweet. Call her Candi! I was just 15.

Maybe the first remix, with the guitar thing - Frankie Knuckles' song [that 
the Source sampled]. It's so sad he passed away, it doesn't seem like he's 
gone. And I never got a chance to meet him.

They had slicker ways back then - now it's blatant. They don't care any more. 
Cheating is cheating - it's just easier to cheat now. And easier to get found 
out too. I don't think cheating will ever stop. You gotta hang onto them, hang 
in there! Some girls are so nasty!

My faith is my foundation, it's very important. It keeps me steadfast, keeps 
me centered. Keeps me focused. It's my solid rock. I try to choose good music 
in secular music, I wouldn't go way leftfield, I want to keep it family-based 
and have kids having to leave the room. I want people from 9 to 90 to come to 
my concerts, so I keep my lyrics clean, and that has a lot to do with my faith.

Someone asked me why I don't sing Mr and Mrs Untrue any more - it's because I 
don't encourage adultery, thanks to my faith.

That song In The Ghetto - my ex-husband was in the studio, and I was just 
sitting there reading a magazine. He was in the middle of recording In The 
Ghetto, and [songwriter] Mack Davis said why doesn't Candi sing it? A woman 
hasn't ever sung it before. It's about women, feelings and emotions of them. I 
said you gotta tell Clarence, I'm not going to tell him! He didn't mind it at 
all, in fact he liked it. Clarence didn't like Patches, his big hit record - 
even though that record got out in 7 days, in the street in 7 days, and it went 
gold. So he probably didn't like In The Ghetto either. I did it with the same 
band, changed the key, and they all went back to their session. Just did it, no 
practice. We pulled that one out, and he just carried on his session.

I have one song on my playlist that is my go-to carefree song - the one that 
makes me the most zen individual on a stressful commute or the most free spirit 
on pavement. Young Hearts Run Free is powerful to anyone that hears it. What 
were your very first thoughts or feelings when Crawford presented you with the 
song?

David gave me that song, and I knew it was a hit. My god, it was the most 
beautiful song I'd ever heard. He wrote the lyrics around what I was going 
through at the time. I was going through a bad relationship, trying to get out, 
it was very abusive and hurtful. I was afraid, fearful of this person, that 
kept threatening my life. "If you leave me, I'll kill you, I'll have your kids 
and mother killed." The whole fear tactic: I'm going to scare you to death; I'm 
going to hold onto you one way or another.

I would tell David about it as we went along, and he wanted to write a song. 
He knew I would bring a song home if he knew I was in the middle of it. I could 
sell it. So that's why he wrote that song. It was a really tough time.

It's a bittersweet song - you're dancing away your troubles when you hear it. 
It's got a dance beat, but really heavy lyrics.

I got a lot of love to see you through! That song came out in 86 in Chicago, 
and it's grown so big since then. I really didn't think anything would happen, 
didn't think much about the lyrics. I didn't pay them any attention, it was 
just a song for a film. I was writing and producing and doing TV, and this was 
a small song compared with some I was doing. It wasn't a big thing to me. And 
after it came over and became such a big hit, I started to revisit it - what 
was so wonderful about it?

And I started to read into it the things that other people were feeling about 
it. Hope, it's all we have, without it we wouldn't survive, and that's a song 
that's filled with hope. It's a great song, the lyrics are strong.

Right now I am, in terms of secular music. Those 25 years of being in the 
Christian music scene, people in the US think I'm doing pure gospel. I'm in the 
class of "gospel singer". Every Honest Jons or EMI record didn't come out back 
at home, they don't know I'm doing this stuff. His Hands, they never got that, 
unless they got online and imported it. The gap is so wide in America, we're 
trying to close it, between gospel and the mainstream. I know it'll come 
around, but it might take a minute to come around. I really don't mind - I live 
there, work here.

It's out now - it's called Evidence. A double CD was released last year, it's 
got everything I've ever done, plus some new stuff - some new things in the can 
you've never heard before.

They offered them to me in demo versions, and some I knew I could bring home, 
and some weren't my style. I tried to pick the songs that mean something to me, 
that's personal, that I could feel. I have to feel them, I'm a soul singer. If 
I can't feel it, why offer it to you, because you can't feel it either.

I started singing secular music in 69 - Stand By Your Man, In The Ghetto, How 
Can I Put Out The Fire, that kind of songs. But I'm forever doing new material 
- it's hard to do all those songs in one show! If you want to hear them let me 
know before I do a tour so I can put them in. I went to Japan, they started 
emailing us with requests, and some were songs I hadn't done for decades - I 
had to go back in the studio to relearn them. In Australia, I did my regular 
show, and they didn't recognise anything!

We had an era when DJs were mostly men... women's lib had not come to be. We 
were in a jail, in a sense. We could only sing songs about: "men, please don't 
leave me!" The male DJs would play the big pleading songs, "you can do anything 
you want to do to me, just take me back." Men love to hear that - if you got 
too liberated they wouldn't play your record. Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive 
broke that mould, and then me with Young Hearts Run Free- suddenly women were 
buying more and more records.

After I went on sabbatical for 25 years, and did my TV show at Christian TV 
shows - I went back and listened to those songs and I was appalled. You have 
got to be joking: I was singing those blood sweat and tears songs, about how I 
would die if he didn't come back to me. Ha! I am not dying if you leave me - 
it's good riddance. But that was the era we lived in, we had to conform. The 
producers were totally behind it - "we can't do that, it's too liberal. We 
won't get no airplay." So you had to do those songs.

All the hit records! I tease Gloria Gaynor, I say that was supposed to me my 
song... I love that song. The Right Woman by Aretha Franklin too. Gladys 
Knight, Midnight Train to Georgia. BB King, The Thrill Is Gone - I love it.

And Pharrell, Happy, I wish that song. Happy? I got happy! That song makes you 
want to jump up and dance.

I wanted to ask Sam Smith at the Mobos - it was on my mind, let's put it that 
way. THere's a soulful connection. He would give his interpretation, as we as 
me, and I'd think we'd gel pretty well. But Jessie J is so fantastic... her 
voice is so up there, I don't know if we would gel, I would have to stay on the 
low ground while she takes the high ground. And Nicole Scherzinger, she's a 
beautiful singer. I admire good singing, good music. I saw her on a show in 
Atlanta one night, I think it was the X Factor, and she blew it away. I was in 
bed, and I sat up and said girl, if you don't stop this... what is this?? This 
chick can blow! It was crazy.

Adele, Sam Smith, Pixie Lott - my Pixie! Pixie came over when we did the Jazz 
Cafe, and she wanted to sing with me, and she did a great job - she can dance, 
instead of saying throw your hands up in the air, she can throw her foot up in 
the air! I was so proud of her.

Sam Smith has a soulful voice - I recognise other soulful voice, I could just 
listen and listen to him. Adele, we were having a barbecue when I was first 
introduced to Adele. And all the kids around the area in Atlanta were listening 
to her. So I've been an Adele fan ever since. She's an artist, first of all - 
artists are different, they create as they go, they paint pictures. She's made 
her own way - she's not cookie cutter, she's Adele.

Post your questions for Candi Staton

To many people, Candi Staton is known purely for You Got The Love 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7yn6spOAFI>, a song whose durability is 
almost ridiculous. Originally recorded as an 80s funk jam for the soundtrack to 
a documentary about the world’s fattest man, it was mashed up with Frankie 
Knuckles’ Your Love in 1991 to create a rave classic, then remixed in 1997 as 
bombastic breakbeat, before eventually being thunderously covered by Florence 
and the Machine. Staton demonstrated its ongoing popularity with a barnstorming 
performance at this year’s Mobo awards, with rapper Little Simz weaving through 
the track.

But her career is so much more rich than just one song. She began in the 1950s 
singing country-soul tracks full of heartbreak – indeed, one producer made her 
sing herself hoarse to get the required level of emotional pain. Her version of
In the Ghetto <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuXqcynZZYg> was praised by 
Elvis, while the likes ofToo Hurt To Cry 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTtbv38NOLM> rank among the greatest ballads 
of the era. She moved into disco and gospel, with the regret-soakedYoung Hearts 
Run Free <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPAd4kNqe-s> proving her first major 
hit, and has continued to record until the present day: His Hands featured 
collaborations with Lambchop and Will Oldham, while her new LP Life Happens is 
released on 27 October.

To celebrate the release day, Candi is joining us to answer your questions 
from 10.30am GMT onwards. Whether its the life lessons learned across five 
marriages, or the creative ups and downs of 60 years of music-making, there’s a 
huge amount to delve into – post your questions in the comments below, and 
she’ll endeavour to answer as many as possible.

Yeah, I was. Duane has a Jesus-people kind of look, flower children sort of 
thing, he can in with no shirt on and flowers round his neck. No shoes, hair 
all the way down. He sat in lotus style in the middle of the floor, with a Coke 
bottle on his thumb playing the guitar. He blew us away, I was in awe: who was 
this person? And Rick was so traditional: "If you don't get that hippie out of 
here..." He would stay outside sun-worshipping, looking up at the sun playing 
his guitar. I said you should sign him now; Rick didn't care, he couldn't deal 
with it. It was great being around all those people, it was wonderful.

I think Beyonce would be the new songwriter. And the old-school: George 
Jackson. He wrote a lot of my best songs. Put them together, you'd get some 
great combinations.

I think Beyonce gives her soul to women. I like the way she expresses herself, 
it's a hurt-filled kind of independence - she's going through pain, but she can 
make it without you; I'm hooked on you, but I don't have to be. I can make it 
on my own, but I don't want to. She's a great songwriter.

Canzetta is on my birth certificate. Mavis Staples called me Candi, that's who 
started it. We were teenagers together, and she said that's just too long! She 
had that bubbly personality, she's always up. She said I'm just gonna call you

They had slicker ways back then - now it's blatant. They don't care any more. 
Cheating is cheating - it's just easier to cheat now. And easier to get found 
out too. I don't think cheating will ever stop. You gotta hang onto them, hang 
in there! Some girls are so nasty!

My faith is my foundation, it's very important. It keeps me steadfast, keeps 
me centered. Keeps me focused. It's my solid rock. I try to choose good music 
in secular music, I wouldn't go way leftfield, I want to keep it family-based 
and have kids having to leave the room. I want people from 9 to 90 to come to 
my concerts, so I keep my lyrics clean, and that has a lot to do with my faith.

Someone asked me why I don't sing Mr and Mrs Untrue any more - it's because I 
don't encourage adultery, thanks to my faith.

That song In The Ghetto - my ex-husband was in the studio, and I was just 
sitting there reading a magazine. He was in the middle of recording In The 
Ghetto, and [songwriter] Mack Davis said why doesn't Candi sing it? A woman 
hasn't ever sung it before. It's about women, feelings and emotions of them. I 
said you gotta tell Clarence, I'm not going to tell him! He didn't mind it at 
all, in fact he liked it. Clarence didn't like Patches, his big hit record - 
even though that record got out in 7 days, in the street in 7 days, and it went 
gold. So he probably didn't like In The Ghetto either. I did it with the same 
band, changed the key, and they all went back to their session. Just did it, no 
practice. We pulled that one out, and he just carried on his session.

I have one song on my playlist that is my go-to carefree song - the one that

song?

David gave me that song, and I knew it was a hit. My god, it was the most 
beautiful song I'd ever heard. He wrote the lyrics around what I was going 
through at the time. I was going through a bad relationship, trying to get out, 
it was very abusive and hurtful. I was afraid, fearful of this person, that 
kept threatening my life. "If you leave me, I'll kill you, I'll have your kids 
and mother killed." The whole fear tactic: I'm going to scare you to death; I'm 
going to hold onto you one way or another.

I would tell David about it as we went along, and he wanted to write a song. 
He knew I would bring a song home if he knew I was in the middle of it. I could 
sell it. So that's why he wrote that song. It was a really tough time.

It's a bittersweet song - you're dancing away your troubles when you hear it. 
It's got a dance beat, but really heavy lyrics.

When did you first realise I had the love you need to see you through?

I got a lot of love to see you through! That song came out in 86 in Chicago, 
and it's grown so big since then. I really didn't think anything would happen, 
didn't think much about the lyrics. I didn't pay them any attention, it was 
just a song for a film. I was writing and producing and doing TV, and this was 
a small song compared with some I was doing. It wasn't a big thing to me. And 
after it came over and became such a big hit, I started to revisit it - what 
was so wonderful about it?

And I started to read into it the things that other people were feeling about 
it. Hope, it's all we have, without it we wouldn't survive, and that's a song 
that's filled with hope. It's a great song, the lyrics are strong.

Do you think it’s fair to say that you’re more popular in the UK and Europe 
than you are in the States? If so, what do you think of that, and why is it 
that the case?

Right now I am, in terms of secular music. Those 25 years of being in the 
Christian music scene, people in the US think I'm doing pure gospel. I'm in the 
class of "gospel singer". Every Honest Jons or EMI record didn't come out back 
at home, they don't know I'm doing this stuff. His Hands, they never got that, 
unless they got online and imported it. The gap is so wide in America, we're 
trying to close it, between gospel and the mainstream. I know it'll come 
around, but it might take a minute to come around. I really don't mind - I live 
there, work here.

My question is actually about your past when you recorded at Rick Halls’ Fame 
Studios.I believe you had over 15 big hits in those days, yet your songs seem 
to be very difficult to find.Why do you not appear on The Fame Studios Story 
1961-1973, and why is “I’m just a prisoner” out of print?

It's out now - it's called Evidence. A double CD was released last year, it's 
got everything I've ever done, plus some new stuff - some new things in the can 
you've never heard before.

They offered them to me in demo versions, and some I knew I could bring home, 
and some weren't my style. I tried to pick the songs that mean something to me, 
that's personal, that I could feel. I have to feel them, I'm a soul singer. If 
I can't feel it, why offer it to you, because you can't feel it either.

I started singing secular music in 69 - Stand By Your Man, In The Ghetto, How 
Can I Put Out The Fire, that kind of songs. But I'm forever doing new material 
- it's hard to do all those songs in one show! If you want to hear them let me 
know before I do a tour so I can put them in. I went to Japan, they started 
emailing us with requests, and some were songs I hadn't done for decades - I 
had to go back in the studio to relearn them. In Australia, I did my regular 
show, and they didn't recognise anything!

We had an era when DJs were mostly men... women's lib had not come to be. We 
were in a jail, in a sense. We could only sing songs about: "men, please don't 
leave me!" The male DJs would play the big pleading songs, "you can do anything 
you want to do to me, just take me back." Men love to hear that - if you got 
too liberated they wouldn't play your record. Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive 
broke that mould, and then me with Young Hearts Run Free- suddenly women were 
buying more and more records.

After I went on sabbatical for 25 years, and did my TV show at Christian TV 
shows - I went back and listened to those songs and I was appalled. You have 
got to be joking: I was singing those blood sweat and tears songs, about how I 
would die if he didn't come back to me. Ha! I am not dying if you leave me - 
it's good riddance. But that was the era we lived in, we had to conform. The 
producers were totally behind it - "we can't do that, it's too liberal. We 
won't get no airplay." So you had to do those songs.

All the hit records! I tease Gloria Gaynor, I say that was supposed to me my 
song... I love that song. The Right Woman by Aretha Franklin too. Gladys 
Knight, Midnight Train to Georgia. BB King, The Thrill Is Gone - I love it.

And Pharrell, Happy, I wish that song. Happy? I got happy! That song makes you 
want to jump up and dance.

I wanted to ask Sam Smith at the Mobos - it was on my mind, let's put it that 
way. THere's a soulful connection. He would give his interpretation, as we as 
me, and I'd think we'd gel pretty well. But Jessie J is so fantastic... her 
voice is so up there, I don't know if we would gel, I would have to stay on the 
low ground while she takes the high ground. And Nicole Scherzinger, she's a 
beautiful singer. I admire good singing, good music. I saw her on a show in 
Atlanta one night, I think it was the X Factor, and she blew it away. I was in 
bed, and I sat up and said girl, if you don't stop this... what is this?? This 
chick can blow! It was crazy.

Adele, Sam Smith, Pixie Lott - my Pixie! Pixie came over when we did the Jazz 
Cafe, and she wanted to sing with me, and she did a great job - she can dance, 
instead of saying throw your hands up in the air, she can throw her foot up in 
the air! I was so proud of her.

Sam Smith has a soulful voice - I recognise other soulful voice, I could just 
listen and listen to him. Adele, we were having a barbecue when I was first 
introduced to Adele. And all the kids around the area in Atlanta were listening 
to her. So I've been an Adele fan ever since. She's an artist, first of all - 
artists are different, they create as they go, they paint pictures. She's made 
her own way - she's not cookie cutter, she's Adele.
 
To many people, Candi Staton is known purely for You Got The Love 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7yn6spOAFI>, a song whose durability is 
almost ridiculous. Originally recorded as an 80s funk jam for the soundtrack to 
a documentary about the world’s fattest man, it was mashed up with Frankie 
Knuckles’ Your Love in 1991 to create a rave classic, then remixed in 1997 as 
bombastic breakbeat, before eventually being thunderously covered by Florence 
and the Machine. Staton demonstrated its ongoing popularity with a barnstorming 
performance at this year’s Mobo awards, with rapper Little Simz weaving through 
the track.

But her career is so much more rich than just one song. She began in the 1950s 
singing country-soul tracks full of heartbreak – indeed, one producer made her 
sing herself hoarse to get the required level of emotional pain. Her version of
In the Ghetto <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuXqcynZZYg> was praised by 
Elvis, while the likes ofToo Hurt To Cry 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTtbv38NOLM> rank among the greatest ballads 
of the era. She moved into disco and gospel, with the regret-soakedYoung Hearts 
Run Free <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPAd4kNqe-s> proving her first major 
hit, and has continued to record until the present day: His Hands featured 
collaborations with Lambchop and Will Oldham, while her new LP Life Happens is 
released on 27 October.

To celebrate the release day, Candi is joining us to answer your questions 
from 10.30am GMT onwards. Whether its the life lessons learned across five 
marriages, or the creative ups and downs of 60 years of music-making, there’s a 
huge amount to delve into – post your questions in the comments below, and
