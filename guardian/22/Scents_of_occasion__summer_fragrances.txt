Chanel’s first gender-neutral fragrance, Boy, smells like the perfect 
relationship. Lavender, rose geranium, moss, citrus, and just a hint of lazy 
dinner followed by rowdy argument about the kitchen. All of this season’s best 
fragrances veer towards boyish, with bergamot and fruit and green things 
leaving the sense of a memorable country walk on your skin, but one with 
someone you really, really like.
