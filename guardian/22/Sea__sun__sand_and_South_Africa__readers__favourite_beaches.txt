Winning tip: Beware the Wild Coast’s ‘Jesus fish’

The stunning Wild Coast five-day hike from Kei Mouth 
<http://www.keimouth.co.za/> to Coffee Bay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/20/top-10-backpacker-lodges-south-africa-eastern-cape>
 on the Eastern Cape is surely the ultimate beach lovers’ experience. Apart 
from a series of stunning sandy beaches between lush green hills, numerous 
river crossings form part of the fun, with some shallow enough to be waded. But 
beware the “Jesus fish”! Small, interested knots of locals gathered on the 
beach when one of us, tired of waiting for the ferry, waded into the water with 
a staff for support. Barely halfway across, he bellowed “JESUS!!” and fell back 
into the water, only to rise again clutching his staff with one hand and his 
foot with the other, still cursing. “Ah yes, that was the Jesus fish,” 
explained one of the locals, nodding sagely, “everyone shouts the same thing.” 
As you will, too, if you happen to tread on one of these electric rays.

On a visit to Robben Island’s prison museum, be sure to leave time to explore 
the island’s unspoiled beaches. You’ll be rewarded with dramatic views of the 
city, and Table Mountain flanked by Devil’s Peak and Lion’s Head. Few visitors 
realise that the island’s shores are the natural habitat of a sizable penguin 
colony: enjoy watching them with far fewer tourists than at Boulders Beach. 
Bird life is abundant and includes oystercatchers, ibis, egrets and cormorants. 
Sharks and dolphins can often be spotted offshore too.

There’s more to Durban

gallery of sand sculptures and drawings, butLucas 
<http://traveller24.news24.com/Explore/Beach/Lucas-the-sand-artist-adds-sparkle-to-Durbans-Golden-Mile-20151007>
, one of the best resident artists, offers lessons. His amazing rhino, with its 
message denouncing poaching, is the only permanent fixture in a frequently 
changing exhibition. Lucas charges a modest R50 (£3) for a fun and surprisingly 
physical hour of creativity. Or, you could commission him to create a 
personalised sculpture for a special occasion.

Paternoster is a small beach community about 150km north of Cape Town. The 
route passes through the wild scenery of theWest Coast national park 
<https://www.sanparks.org/parks/west_coast/>, full of flowers in the summer, 
and after a few hours you emerge on a peaceful crescent of white sand. The town 
has rentals galore, all the Cape Dutch architecture you could want for a 
weekend away and some great food. Long walks on the beach, eating and drinking 
and watching the fishing boats make for a peaceful break. And, unlike in Cape 
Town, you can dip your toes in the sea without your legs freezing solid.

Around 20 miles east of Plettenberg Bay lies the village of Nature’s Valley 
(on theGarden Route <http://www.gardenroute.co.za/>), with two contrasting but 
equally stunning waterscapes. Stand on the deserted silver beach looking inland 
and you’ll see the tranquil Groot river lagoon, against the backdrop of the 
Tsitsikamma mountains. Turn seawards to experience the thrill of the Indian 
Ocean’s thunderous breakers; if you are lucky you may spy a pod of bottlenose 
dolphins. In the surrounding forest, exotic knysna lourie birds flash red and 
green as they swoop among the yellowwood trees. 360 degrees of enchantment and 
the highlight of our South African holiday.

 View from a room at the Santos Express 
In Mossel Bay on the Garden Route coast you can stay in a train which has been 
converted into a hotel. The Santos Express has double, twin, and dorm rooms all 
in former carriages, and every single room has an uninterrupted view of the 
ocean and the beach right underneath the windows. Even the toilet has a stunner 
of a view.

Travelling through rolling green hills of the Transkei, among the traditional 
rondavels of the Xhosa, you try to avoid huge potholes in the road and cows 
suddenly crossing. It’s a magical landscape, then suddenly the Indian Ocean 
opens up, and nestled between majestic cliffs is Coffee Bay. Gigantic waves 
roll on to a pristine beach. The Sardine Run happens between May and July and 
you can go out diving with whales and dolphins. Surfing is another favourite 
and the famousHole in the Wall 
<http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-hole-in-the-wall-wild-coast>
 is just to the south. We stayed halfway up the hill behind the beach at the 
lovely, small Ocean View Hotel, whose rooms offer amazing views. It has a 
restaurant on a wooden terrace, overlooking the beach.

 Bakoven rock 
Escape Camps Bay’s crowds by walking along the promenade towards Bakoven. 
Halfway round the bay, find the path that takes you down through the fynbos 
shrubland to the tiny, shingle beach, with rocky pools and big granite boulders 
to lean against. Here you can sit in blissful peace, read a book and 
contemplate the sparkling azure sea and the Bakoven rock, shaped like a pizza 
oven. It’s sheltered when the Cape Doctor is blowing, when you can contemplate 
the white horses of the waves. When you have had enough, return to enjoy a 
drink or meal at one of Camps Bay’s bars or restaurants, just 10 minutes’ walk 
away.

Two hours east of Cape Town is the village of Arniston, home to a variety of 
beaches. At one, at low tide, you can wade out to the enormous Waenhuiskrans 
Cave. My favourite lies beyond the thatched fishermen’s cottages of the 
Kassiesbaai area: a vast expanse of beach home to the wreck of theArniston 
<http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-wreck-of-the-arniston>
. The British freighter was shipwrecked in 1815, and the individual decks still 
lie poignantly scattered across the sand. Behind this are sand dunes, great for 
exploring on foot or by dune buggy. Or sit and wait to see the southern right 
whales as they occasionally swim past.

There are beaches, and then there’s Tergniet on the south coast of the Western 
Cape. My family and I have been going there since I was four. It is quiet and 
clean, and has lovely pools for kids to play in. There are a few guesthouses 
and some self-catering places nearby. The nearest major settlements are Mossel 
Bay and George. The more widely known beaches of Hartenbos and Dias are a short 
drive away. Tergniet is still raw nature combined with beach and sea. The 
weather is lovely year-round and the water is far warmer than the Cape beaches.
