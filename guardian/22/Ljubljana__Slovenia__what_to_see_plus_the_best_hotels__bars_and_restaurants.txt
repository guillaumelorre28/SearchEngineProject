As capital of one of Europe’s most forested countries, it’s perhaps fitting 
that Ljubljana is this year’s European Green Capital. A city of just 300,000 
inhabitants, Ljubljana has often been ahead of the game when it comes to green 
initiatives – from the introduction of a sophisticated waste management system 
(Ljubljana was the first EU capital to adopt a zero-waste programme) and the 
creation of new green spaces from degraded urban land, to electrically powered 
golf buggy-type vehicles (kavalirs 
<http://www.greenljubljana.com/funfacts/kavalir>) offering free transport 
around the old town, which is otherwise closed to traffic. OfficialGreen 
Capital celebrations <http://greenljubljana.com/> kicked off last month, but 
there are numerous events taking place throughout the year.

The city oozes charm, a delightful confection of Baroque and Habsburg 
inspired-architecture, richly painted churches, abundant greenery and engaging 
riverside cafes. Moreover, its location, at the heart of this tiny, but 
astonishingly diverse country, means it’s no more than a couple of hours away 
from anywhere, be it the imperious limestone mountains and glacial lakes of the 
Julian Alps, the magical subterranean world of the Karst region, historic 
coastal towns or the lush vineyards in its hinterland.

WHAT TO DO AND SEE

The old town 
Ljubljana’s most obvious point of reference is its gorgeous old town, buffered 
on one side by a neat castle-topped hill and on the other by the languorous 
Ljubljanica river, its willow-fringed banks sprinkled with easy-going 
restaurants, cafes and bars. It is an attractive lattice of cobbled streets, 
arched alleys and fine cultural monuments, many of which were bequeathed to the 
city by Jože Plečnik (1872–1957), Slovenia’s most celebrated urban planner. 
From the brilliantly conceived and much-photographed Triple bridge (he 
contributed the two angled footbridges in the 1930s), to the graceful market 
colonnade, the city is run through with his unique designs.Two-hour Plečnik 
tours <https://www.visitljubljana.com/en/tours-and-excursions/5843/detail.html> 
can be arranged through the tourist office (€50 for a group of up to five 
people or €60 for up to 10), which also operatesother excellent themed tours 
<http://www.visitljubljana.com/en/tours-and-excursions/default.html?category[]=5808>
.

Otherwise, the best and most original of the city’s many guiding companies is 
CurioCity <http://www.curiocity.si/ljubljana-tours.html>, whose tours include 
From Ljubljana With Love <http://www.curiocity.si/from-ljubljana-with-love.html>
, which takes visitors to local social enterprises including restaurants and 
shops, andLazy Sundays <http://www.curiocity.si/lazy-sundays.html>, which 
includes a park stroll, brunch, coffee and beer pitstops, but otherwise does 
not very much at all – in the best possible sense.

Ljubljana Castle

Lording it over the huddle of orange- and red-roofed townhouses below is the 
16th-century Ljubljana Castle, whose grounds have been given over to a cluster 
of first-rate museums: Virtual Castle, a clever 3D multi-visual illustrating 
the castle’s development; an engrossing exhibition on Slovene history, with 
particularly illuminating sections on socialist Yugoslavia through to the 
Ten-Day War (or Slovenian Independence War) in 1991; and the sweet Museum of 
Puppetry, a long-cherished art form in Slovenia. The stocky Clock Tower, 
meanwhile, affords peerless views of the old town, and, in the distance, the 
serrated, snow-dusted Kamniške Alps. If you don’t fancy the stiff 15-minute 
climb to the top, a funicular goes right into the heart of the complex.

Krakovo and Trnovo
Ljubljana is replete with genteel, village-like suburbs, but few are as 
appealing as Krakovo, within a 10-minute walk of the old town. An erstwhile 
haunt of Slovenian artists, today Krakovo is characterised by thickset medieval 
houses and neatly tended allotments, the produce of which sustains the huge 
open-air market on Vodnikov trg (Vodnik Square) as well as numerous city 
restaurants. In neighbouring Trnovo, there are more examples of Plečnik’s work, 
notably Trnovo bridge, on one side of which is the architect’s surprisingly 
modest house (€6,guided tours only, on the hour, 10am-5pm

<http://www.mgml.si/en/plecnik-house-503/contact-opening-times-prices/>). Most 
of it has been left as it was, notably his studio, complete with equipment, 
books and plans.

Sundays

On Sunday mornings, the banks of the Ljubljanica are taken over by a terrific 
little flea market, selling everything from antique sofas and vintage stamps to 
ex-Yugoslav military uniforms. While outdoorsy types love nothing better than 
hiking up 669m Šmarna Gora, five miles north of the city. At the top, you can 
grab a warming cup of tea.

Eipprova ulica
This convivial canalside street is Ljubljana’s main entertainment hub and 
boasts a colourful ensemble of cafes and pubs.

WHERE TO EAT

Odprta kuhna 

Spring sees the reopening of the city’s ever-popular Odprto Kuhna (Open 
Kitchen) on picturesque Pogačarjev trg, which is bound on one side by Plečnik’s 
elegant market colonnade, itself a great spot to pick up picnicky snacks. Every 
Friday, hungry punters flock to this buzzing open-air food market, where some 
of the city’s very best establishments (including Strelec and Gostilna AS) 
serve sample (and cheap) portions of their restaurant dishes. There are also 
stalls selling many cuisines that you might not otherwise find in the city. A 
phalanx of beer and wine stalls adds to the convivial atmosphere.
• Pogačarjev trg, odprtakuhna.si <http://www.odprtakuhna.si/>

Gostilna Dela


The idea behind this warm, bustling little daytime restaurant is to help those 
from disadvantaged groups assimilate into mainstream society, in a similar vein 
to Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen. The daily menu is short, typically consisting of one 
soup, one meat (roast veal with carrot mash, say) and one fish dish (maybe sea 
bream on barley risotto), and a dessert, but that matters little when the food 
tastes this good; each dish goes for around €7 a pop.

Strelec 


Dining out in Ljubljana doesn’t get much more exciting than at this refined 
establishment, secreted in the castle’s Archer’s Tower. Climbing the elegant 
spiral staircase, you emerge into an artfully designed room whose rust-red 
stone walls are painted with scenes of medieval battle. Chef Igor Jagodic – a 
rising star in Slovenian gastronomic circles – conjures up beautifully crafted 
and technically accomplished dishes such as veal tongue with smoked eel and 
horseradish mayonnaise, and buckwheat croquettes stuffed with duck liver, black 
walnuts and fir tree foam. The space is perfect for assignations of a romantic 
nature.

Pri Škofu 
A comely neighbourhood restaurant in Krakovo, Pri Škofu has been quietly going 
about its business for years. Fabulous home-style cooking is the order of the 
day, most of which is prepared using hand-picked produce from the nearby 
allotments. Visitors choose from whatever’s chalked up on the board, which 
might be pork tenderloin in a fig sauce, or a black truffle risotto (€10), then 
take a seat inside the unadorned but snug interior, or outside on the sunny 
pavement terrace.

WHERE TO DRINK
 Dvorni Bar Photograph: peterirman.com 
Dvorni Bar 
Slovenian wine is little known outside the country but it is outstanding, and 
this seasoned wine bar down by the Ljubljanica is just the place to begin your 
education. Start with a drop of Rebula, a sumptuous dry white from the 
picturesque Goriška Brda region abutting the Italian border, before moving on 
to a glass of full-bodied, blood-red Teran from the Karst – best sampled with a 
plate or two of tapas (€3-€5 a glass). When you’re done here, pop next door to 
the excellent shop and stock up on a bottle or two to impress friends back home.

Metelkova City

Once a Yugoslav army barracks, Metelkova was squatted in 1993 and is now a 
rag-bag of alternative venues in the centre of Ljubljana. The autonomous social 
centre and legendary night spot features all kinds of live music: everything 
from jazz and rockabilly to dub and techno.

Ziferblat 


The good folk at Ziferblat do things somewhat differently. Put simply, the 
longer you stay, the more you pay (€0.5c per minute, or €3 per hour; a daily 
ticket is capped at €7), for which you get unlimited beverages (alas no 
alcohol) and cookies, and general all-round use of the facilities, including 
the kitchen. Indeed, guests are encouraged to use the cafe’s not inconsiderable 
space – amply filled with recycled and vintage furnishings – as they wish, be 
it to read, paint or play an instrument. There’s even a hammock if you fancy a 
kip.

Union Pivnica 


Occupying the cavernous former worker’s canteen of the Union brewery (one of 
Slovenia’s two major breweries; the other is Laško), this rocking venue 
showcases the very best in both warehouse chic design and Slovenian beer. On 
offer is a prodigious array of pale, dark and amber ales, including numerous 
unfiltered versions (from €2.50-€4). Naturally, the beer has to be soaked up 
somehow, so grab a plate of grilled beer sausages while you’re at it.
• Celovška cesta 22, pivnica-union.si <http://www.pivnica-union.si/en/>

Café Čokl 
Named after its personable owner, this cosy, happily careworn cafe is the 
place for caffeine connoisseurs. Fairtrade coffee beans are sourced from single 
estates, which are then roasted by Tine himself, with each one chalked up on a 
board indicating the date the beans were picked and when they were roasted. On 
a warm day, park yourself outside on the sociable little terrace and treat 
yourself to a cup of deliciously refreshing cold-pressed coffee.

WHERE TO STAY
 Cubo hotel is the slickest in town Photograph: David Ralita 
Cubo 
The city’s slickest hotel is housed in a stunningly refurbished, white 1930s 
residential building, and the 26 bedrooms are decorated in discerning shades of 
grey, complete with all mod cons and abstract art on the walls, alongside 
glassed-in bathrooms featuring enormous walk-in showers and L’Occitane 
toiletries. Around half the rooms have unencumbered views of the castle. It’s 
impeccably serviced too.

Slamič 


B&Bs are few and far between in Ljubljana, so this is a most welcome find. The 
understated rooms come in two categories: those in the main building boast high 
ceilings with panelled walls and waxed wooden floors; another six, more 
contemporary rooms are just across the way. Breakfast is taken in the quaint 
in-house cafe – worth a visit even if you’re not staying here – or on the 
rooftop terrace in warmer weather.

Adora 
In a sleepy little corner of the old town, this exquisite, family-run hotel – 
a fine conversion of a bourgeois townhouse – conceals 10 rooms of considerable 
charm and style: parquet flooring, polished teak furnishings including 
fabulously chunky bedsteads, and brass-fitted taps and showers alongside some 
thoughtful touches like 1930s-style telephones and side-lamps, and framed 
watercolours of old Ljubljana. The pocket-sized courtyard, with its trim lawn, 
is the perfect spot for a sundowner.

Tresor Hostel


It’s not often you get the chance to sleep in a bank, but this buzzy hostel 
gives you the opportunity to do just that. A stone’s throw from the Triple 
bridge, it is set around a high, central atrium, with spacious, spotlessly 
clean dorms – each sporting the name of a currency – sleeping between four and 
12 people. Many of the bank’s original fixtures and fittings, such as the 
lockers, have been cleverly incorporated as design features, while the old 
vaults now function as a common area and kitchen. And there’s a pint-sized bar 
for a cheeky nightcap.
