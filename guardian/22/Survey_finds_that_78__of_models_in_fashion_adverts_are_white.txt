According to a new report, 78.2% of all the models featured in spring 2016’s 
fashion adverts were white. In a breakdown of the statistics, 8.3% of models 
featured in ads were black, 4% were Asian and 3.8% were Hispanic.

Although low, the percentage of non-white models has actually increased from 
2015 when the total was 84.7%. The results, complied byThe Fashion Spot 
<http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/690669-diversity-report-spring-2016-fashion-ads/>
, come from a survey of 236 fashion print campaigns and 422 models.

“The good news is that it is more racially diverse. The downside is that there 
is a long way to go,” Jennifer Davidson, managing editor of The Fashion Spot, 
told theNew York Post

The statistics come in the same week that Naomi Campbell admitted that her 
iconicFrench Vogue cover from 1988 
<https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ec/a6/e0/eca6e03225d52850c73c680b4ee8e1c4.jpg>
 (she was the first black model to appear on its cover) almost didn’t happen.

In an interview with CNN style <http://edition.cnn.com/style>, the model said 
that she had no idea editor-in-chiefAnna Wintour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/anna-wintour> had to fight for the cover.

“Anna gave me such a great opportunity and I had no idea how much she had to 
fight for that.” At the time, Yves Saint Laurent threatened to pull his 
advertising from the magazine if they refused to put a black model on the 
cover. They relented and Campbell’s cover appeared on newsstands.

Campbell wrote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/19/naomi-campbell-modelling-bob-marley-putin-autobiography-extract>
 about her early experiences of racism in the fashion industry earlier this 
month in her self-titled book. “When I started out, I wasn’t being booked for 
certain shows because of the colour of my skin. I didn’t let it rattle me. From 
attending auditions and performing at an early age, I understood what it meant 
to be black. You had to put in the extra effort. You had to be twice as good.”
