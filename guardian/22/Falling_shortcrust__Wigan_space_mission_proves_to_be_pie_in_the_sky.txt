It never quite made it into space, but one of Wigan’s chosen few – a meat and 
potato pie – has boldly gone where no pastry has gone before.

Tethered to a high-altitude weather balloon, its progress monitored by an 
onboard camera, the celebrated northern concoction, complete with foil tray, 
rose to a point 29 miles above the Earth’s crust.


Nasa didn’t want to know about this, so we got a couple of lads from Sheffield 
to sort it instead.

It remained in the air for more than two hours before beginning a graceful 
descent into a field 38 miles away from its launchpad. First indications were 
that it did not reheat on entry.


The unmanned flight provided a taster for the World Pie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/pie> Eating Championships being held 
in Wigan on Tuesday.


Organisers claim to be optimistic that data collected from the mission will 
help this year’s contestants down their 12cm competition pies in record time.

Tony Callaghan, who owns Harry’s Bar in the town centre, said: “We are 
continually questing to go where mankind has never gone before: sub-16 seconds 
consumption of a regulation pie.


“We are aware that scientists have been experimenting with plants on the 
international space station, to see if their molecular structure changes, so we 
are experimenting with pies to see if the structure changes with space travel.”


And the point of that, of course, is to discover whether it “allows the pie to 
be eaten quicker”.


Callaghan brought in experts from Sheffield-based SentIntoSpace to help with 
the launch from a pub car park. “Nasa didn’t want to know about this, so we got 
a couple of lads from Sheffield to sort it instead.”


Bill Kenyon, of Ultimate Purveyors, the St Helens firm commissioned to make 
the pilot pie, said: “This is the first step to enable mankind to consume pies 
with more elegance and comfort. Neither the sky, nor the pie, should be the 
limit.”

Wigan has had a long love affair with the pie, but it was only in 1992 that 
the world championships were first held in the town.

One of the highlights came in 2005 when Anthony “the Anaconda” Danson - a 
weight trainer from Lancashire - managed to eat seven pies in three minutes.


Sadly, the 2006 competition was marred by a number of controversies.


First, to the chagrin of local carnivores, organisers had the temerity to 
introduce a parallel competition for “southern types” who like to put things 
called vegetables in their pies.


Second, an “impostor”, Matt Dunning, somehow managed to beat off local 
competition to win the title for Australia.


And third, to meet healthy eating guidelines set by the government, the 
contest switched from stuffing down as many pies as possible in a given time to 
the almost genteel pursuit of demolishing a single pie.


But at least national pride was restored the following year, when Adrian 
Frost, 42, from Wigan no less, polished off his pie in 35.86 seconds.

He was actually quite lucky to find one, it turns out. The night before the 
big event another competitor’s dog, Charlie, had eaten 20 pies and damaged a 
further 10.


To say that Wiganers are both proud and fiercely protective of their pies is 
an understatement.


Bakers have been known to attach notices to their vans, declaring: “No pies 
are kept in this vehicle overnight.”


And especially not before Tuesday’s contest.
