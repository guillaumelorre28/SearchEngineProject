New York 

In summer, the Big Apple becomes an incinerator. So rent a car and drive north 
into the peaceful Hudson Valley, where the Hessel Museum of Art is presenting 
two magnificent but very different solo exhibitions. Amy Sillman, a giant of 
painting, mixes abstraction and figuration in powerful, sometimes hilarious 
mashups, while photographer Anne Collier shoots appropriated images from 
calendars or magazines with forensic objectivity.Until 21 September. Details:

Rio de Janeiro

The cidade maravilhosa has more to offer than just sand and caipirinhas. Mar, 
the new Museu de Arte do Rio, is presenting a bonkers group show springing from 
the unlikely meeting, in 1929, of performer Josephine Baker and architect Le 
Corbusier. According to multiple biographers, the pair had an affair during 
their time in Brazil. The curators take an expansive view, presenting both 
historical documentation and parallel projects by artists and performers, 
including Grace Jones.Until 17 August. Details: museudeartedorio.org.br/en

 Art by Wolfgang Tillmans at the 8th Berlin Biennale 
Berlin

Want to hang out with semi-employed Europeans sitting in the sun all day? At 
the 8th Berlin Biennale curator Juan Gaitán is showcasing art that privileges 
archival materials, historical oddments and cross-cultural exchange – such as a 
large display by Wolfgang Tillmans, which includes both photographs and 
consumerist junk. Most of the biennial takes place in the western suburb of 
Dahlem, far from the galleries and bars of East Berlin.Until 3 August. Details:

 Splendide Hotel, 2014, by Dominique Gonzalez-Foster 
Madrid

If you're taking a stroll through El Retiro, Madrid's superb central park, 
make sure to stop at the lakeside Palacio de Cristal. The French artist 
Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster has refashioned the 19th-century greenhouse as the 
"Splendide Hotel", an imaginary resort complete with antique rocking chairs and 
mysteriously abandoned top hat and boots. She borrowed the name from a hotel in 
which Marcel Proust stayed, and just like his novels,her installation 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Jr9uJj9lw> is a gathering place for those 
adrift on the sea of time.Until 19 October. Details: museoreinasofia.es

The rumours are true: the European capital really has become a contemporary 
art hotspot,. This summer Bozar, the city's main cultural institute, is giving 
its galleries over to Michaël Borremans, one of the leading figures of 
Belgium's resurgent figurative painting scene. His exacting compositions often 
portray solemn, downcast characters but sometimes lunge into the surreal, as in 
a full-length portrait of model Hannelore Knuts with her face covered in a 
black mask.Until 3 August. Details: bozar.be

 Bassidjiy, 1985, by Kazem Chalipa, part of Unedited History. Iran 1960-2014 
Paris

Ignore anyone who tells you Paris is no-go territory in the summer – just hop 
on a Vélib and spend the day bombing down the empty boulevards. Then make your 
way over to the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, whose blockbuster 
summer show Unedited History: Iran 1960–2014 continues a welcome trend of 
looking at modernism beyond Europe and America. With more than 200 works, it 
both highlights the achievements of Persian artists before the revolution and 
shows that Iranian modern art didn't end in 1979.Until 24 August. Details:

 Overpass, 2001, by Jeff Wall 
Amsterdam

The Stedelijk may have dropped the ball with its ghastly new building, but it 
still has some of the best programming of any European museum. It's presenting 
a retrospective of Canadian photographer Jeff Wall, but instead of trotting out 
his famous 1980s lightboxes,the show 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNWWrKXNeBA> starts with his lesser-known 
black-and-white prints of the 1990s. It goes a long way to re-establishing Wall 
as a photographer first, rather than a frustrated painter.Until 3 August.

Venice

Besides the stuffed-to-bursting architecture biennial, Venice's other big draw 
this summer is a major exhibition of the American photographer Irving Penn. At 
the Palazzo Grassi, home to the François Pinault Foundation, his fashion 
photographs hang alongside portraits of artists (Picasso, Duchamp, Chagall), 
late still lifes, and lesser-known images of animal skulls. In a darkened 
gallery are Penn's never-before-exhibited internegatives, which he slashed 
crosswise after completing his prints.Until 31 December. Details:

 Paweł Althamer's installation on the island of Hydra. 
Athens

Get into the city, push past the tourists at the Parthenon, then get out: 
summer in Greece means you need to go to the archipelago. On the island of 
Hydra, the megacollector Dakis Joannou has established a satellite of his Deste 
Art Foundation in a former slaughterhouse that has been given over to the 
sometimes-incendiary artist Paweł Althamer. His interactive installation 
features dolls depicting his own family, which visitors can manipulate as they 
like.Until 29 September. Details: deste.gr/hydra <http://deste.gr/hydra>
 Monologue, 2009, by Laure Prouvost 
Oslo

In less than a decade Norway's little oil-soaked capital has developed one of 
the most dynamic arts scenes in Europe. In gritty, diverse Grønland, the 
dependably stout, artist-run institution 1857 is holding about the coolest 
summer show you could ask for: Sunbathers II, which displays art from Ugo 
Rondinone, Margaret Lee and other young guns on the gallery's roof, reached via 
a scaffold stair tower. Film screenings, including work by last year's Turner 
prize-winner Laure Prouvost, take place at dusk – which, in the Norwegian 
summer, comes just before midnight.Until 17 August. Details: 1857.no

 Izu Photo Museum 
Tokyo

Leave the capital to its 35 million inhabitants; hop on a westbound bullet 
train, and in less than an hour you'll reach Shizuoka's sublime Izu Photo 
Museum, whose single-storey stone building (designed in collaboration with 
photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto) sits in a serene sculpture garden. Its summer 
exhibition features the work of the late Ichiro Kojima, a gloomy photographer 
who devoted his career to documenting Japan's frozen north.From 3 August to 25 
December. Details:izuphoto-museum.jp/en <http://izuphoto-museum.jp/en>
 Love Long Distance, 2010, by Bruno Peinado 
The Hague

An hour to the southwest of Amsterdam, The Hague offers all the culture with 
smaller, less cannabis-addled crowds. In the seaside suburb of Scheveningen, 
the Museum Beelden aan Zee has a broad exhibition of French sculpture, from 
modern masters such as Henri Laurens to contemporary artists Bruno Peinado and 
Daniel Firman. The show continues back in town with larger outdoor works, 
including Adel Abdessemed's giant bronze depicting Zinedine Zidane's World 
Cup-ending headbutt.Until 26 October. Details: beeldenaanzee.nl/en
