At last, we’re moving into the top ten video games of the year, as chosen by 
our team of experienced and opinionated game writers. Judging by the comments 
beneath previous entries, there will be some controversy here, with 
much-favoured online football brawler Rocket League falling short of an 
expected top five placing.

The appearance of Destiny – effectively re-thought and re-engineered for its 
Taken King release – could prove controversial too. But, as we’ve pointed out, 
the selection is subjective and makes no attempt to consider wider critical 
opinion. You can just go on Metacritic for that.

Let’s start with another Wii U <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/wii-u> 
game...

 Xenoblade Chronicles X 
Tetsuya Takahashi’s latest is a grand, ambitious and, at times, willfully 
arcane open-world masterpiece. It begins with a crash-landing on the Jurassic 
world of Mira. There you join the ranks of the other remaining humans to begin 
rebuilding civilization, an expansion that the local flora and fauna powerfully 
resist. Its systems are varied, knotted and, at times, seemingly unrelated. 
Yet, in the mystery, wonder lies. Unlike the increasingly homogenous glut of 
western open world games, X is singular and memorable in both style and 
structure.

 Destiny: Taken King 
A mystifying waste of time to some, a lifestyle to others, Destiny has kept 
its hold on the gaming consciousness this year through sheer force of will. The 
Taken King update added a new plotline and social base, as well as new strikes 
and a massively improved levelling system. Some said this is what Destiny 
should always have been. Whatever the case, it became a ridiculously compelling 
endeavour to its fans, perfectly combining those Halo-style bursts of shooter 
action with the slower arc of a loot gathering adventure. It’s still a troubled 
and difficult relationship but, to many gamers, it is love.

 Rocket League Photograph: Psyonix 
Two teams of rocket-propelled cars, an enclosed stadium and one giant football 
are the elements that make Rocket League 2015’s ultimate “one more go” game. 
The secret sauce is the perfectly-tuned driving controls, capable of everything 
from bicycle kicks to rocket-propelled flight, which keep on revealing new 
depths as you master the old ones. The speed of the players combines 
beautifully with the low-gravity ball and curved stadia, and the five-minute 
match length is a flawless touch – there’s always time for another.

 Her Story 
Everyone fancies themselves as a detective, and Her Story taps into this to 
weave a multi-threaded story out of restrained mechanics. You find yourself at 
a police terminal, with access to timestamped video clips and a searchable 
index. The game is to find and watch these clips, all from several police 
interviews with the same woman, and work out what’s going on. The atmosphere is 
fuggy, the acting is wonderful, and following-up the right leads feels so good 
it’s like you’re a natural.

 Splatoon 
Why play a normal shooter, when you can play a shooter where you fire ink and 
turn into a squid? Comprised of an addictive and ridiculously entertaining 
online mode, and a single player campaign with unique mechanics, Splatoon is 
one of 2015’s most interesting offerings. It is essentially the gaming 
equivalent of a 1990s Saturday morning kid’s TV show; colourful, noisy, fun – 
and with a lot of people getting gunked. Importantly, with an emphasis on 
territorial gain rather than shooting people in the face,Nintendo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo> showed us that there’s more 
to team-based online shooters than blood and shotguns.

 * The Guardian Games ‘Review of the Year’ is taking place at the Guardian’s 
Scott Room on Thursday evening, 7-8.30pm. Featuring Keith Stuart, writers Simon 
Parkin and Cara Ellison and game developer Mike Bithell, we’ll look back at 
2015, with mince pies and a giant (free!) Xmas tombola with amazing prizes!
