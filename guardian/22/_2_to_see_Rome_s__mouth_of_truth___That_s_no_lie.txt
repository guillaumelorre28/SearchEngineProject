Legend says that if you are a liar and place your hand inside Rome’s Bocca 
della Verità, a marble face known as the mouth of truth, you’ll lose some 
fingers.

But now a trip to the monument, which has long been considered a must-see for 
tourists visiting the Eternal City, means you will also lose some of your money.

Visitors will no longer be free to snap a photo of themselves with their 
fingers placed in the Bocca della Verità, mock expressions of fear on their 
faces.

The medieval church that owns it, the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, has 
started to charge tourists €2 (£1.72) for access to the statue and one 
photograph, a policy that would have made Audrey Hepburn’s famous stop at the 
site with Gregory Peck rather less romantic in Roman Holiday.

 If they had taken a selfie, Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck would have been 
charged €2 – or the equivalent in lira in 1953, under the new policy. 
The funds are to be used to help renovate the 8th century church, which was 
last given a major revamp about nine centuries ago.

Tourists will not only have to pay to access the site but will be watched by 
at least one church official to ensure they only get one photograph per ticket.

The news caused some raised eyebrows among Italian media outlets, with La 
Repubblica concluding that, in times of economic crisis, even liars have to do 
their bit.
