Michael Keaton has apologised for a gaffe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/08/hidden-fences-golden-globes-2017-mistake>
 in which he referred to the film Hidden Figures as “Hidden Fences” while 
presenting an award at the Golden Globes.

Speaking to reporters before the Los Angeles premiere of his new film, The 
Founder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2016/mar/30/ray-kroc-the-wily-businessman-who-made-mcdonalds>
, Keaton said: “I screwed the line up. I was nonchalant about it. I actually, 
now, I totally understand … It makes me feel so badly that people feel badly. 
If somebody feels badly, that’s all that matters.”

Keaton had been naming the nominees for the best supporting actress Golden 
Globe, and had conflated the titles ofHidden Figures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/12/hidden-figures-review-john-glenn-taraji-henson-black-nasa-octavia-spencer-janelle-monae>
, the film about black women mathematicians working on the 1960s space-flight 
programme, andFences 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/22/fences-review-denzel-washington-viola-davis-august-wilson>
, the Denzel Washington-directed drama about a retired baseball player. A 
similar gaffe was made earlier in the evening by NBC reporter Jenna Bush Hager. 
Both films feature largely African-American casts, andreaction on social media 
<https://twitter.com/fenceshidden> was quick to point this out.

Keaton added: “Especially those people in the movie, who worked all that time. 
I always think about if they have brothers and sisters or mothers and fathers 
or friends waiting for this, then this guy – me – gets up, gives the wrong 
part. Watching a player drop a big pass, I always go, ‘Oh my gosh, I feel so 
bad.’ It kills me. So I am very very sorry.”

Keaton also spoke to the Associated Press 
<http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PEOPLE_MICHAEL_KEATON_CAOL-?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT>
 about the issue, saying he “made a mistake reading the teleprompter and the 
cue cards” and assuring viewers that there was nothing “discriminatory” in his 
error. “I mean, almost like calling Al Gore a climate change denier.”
