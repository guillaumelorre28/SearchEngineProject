In the back streets of Seville, out of the sun, away from the crowds queuing 
for the Alcazar and cathedral, my girlfriend and I were put to work in a 
kitchen. It’s not everyone’s idea of a holiday, perhaps, but we were here for a 
behind-the-scenes tour of Andalucía’s cuisine.

“Chop one of these,” said David Ciudad 
<https://www.tourhq.com/guide/es50196/david-ciudad>, our 
guide-cum-culinary-instructor, handing me a bulb of garlic. He was showing us 
how to makesalmorejo, the gazpacho-like Andalucían cold soup of tomatoes, 
garlic, salt, and olive oil; andespinacas con garbanzos, a stew of chickpeas, 
garlic, cumin and spinach – Indian flavours that are a legacy of thegitanos who 
settled here from Rajasthan in the seventh century and have had a lasting 
influence on the culture. Both dishes are simple, tasty and cheap.

The kitchen David uses for lessons doubles as an art gallery, which when we 
visited had an exhibition of acerbic newspaper cartoons.

For pudding, David took us to see his friend Marta, a Sevillian singer who now 
occasionally welcomes tourists to her home to eat. She served us a dish of 
chocolate ice-cream with orange-flavoured olive oil, her own creation.

This insider’s view of the region’s culinary delights is part of a new food 
tour organised by Pura Aventura. The tailormade trips include everything from 
cooking lessons to farm visits, meeting connoisseurs along the way. The tours 
are focused on the food, but there are options to get active too, including a 
visit to theDoñana national park 
<http://www.andalucia.org/en/natural-spaces/national-parks/donana/>, an expanse 
of wetlands and forest where rare species such as the Iberian lynx and imperial 
eagle are found.

 Finca La Fronda hotel 
Our cooking lesson complete, we raided a few tapas bars before leaving Seville 
and driving an hour west into Huelva province. We drove up into the hills of the
Sierra de Aracena y los Picos de Aroche 
<http://www.andalucia.com/environment/protect/sierradearacena.htm> natural park 
to theFinca La Fronda <http://www.fincalafronda.com> hotel. Set in a cork oak 
and chestnut forest, and cooled by an upland breeze, the hotel has a fine view 
over the village of Alájar and strives to beeco-friendly 
<http://www.fincalafronda.com/conocenos-2/compromiso-medioambiental/?lang=en> 
with recycled water, solar power and a reliance on local food supplies. It’s 
run by a family descended from William Wordsworth, and a large portrait of the 
poet sits in the lounge.

However, we had come to learn about the area’s pigs, not to talk about Tintern 
Abbey, so headed to nearbyFinca Montefrio <http://fincamontefrio.com/>, where 
Armando and his wife Lola raise organicibérico herds and produce some of the 
best ham in the world. At Armando’s call the pigs came trotting through the 
trees. Thisdehesa, characterised by pastures of olive, cork and acorns, with 
swine rooting around in their shade, is one of the oldest managed landscapes in 
Europe, an elegant system dated to Roman times.

Each October, year-old pigs are released for the montanera, a six-month orgy 
of gluttony where they feed almost exclusively on acorns, eating 10kg of them 
and putting on 1.2kg in weight every day before being slaughtered, cured and 
hung. The high oil content of the acorns gives the ham its flavour. Montefrio 
produces just 200 hams a year; those that make it to the UK sell at around 
£400. We tried the ham at lunch. Sliced translucently thin, it dissolved on the 
palate, deep in salt, fat and flavour.

 Pigs bathing in the Sierra de Aracena 
Lots of parts of Spain would claim that their hams are the best. Fewer could 
claim that for their tuna. Bluefin tuna was until recently a byword for 
overfishing, and animal rights protestors would sit crossly outside Nobu. But 
the catching of fish below a certain size has now been banned. As a result the
rojo tuna, as it’s called here, is back in business. Down on the south coast in 
places such as Barbate, south of Cadiz, it has been caught in the same way for 
thousands of years, using a a system called thealmadraba. In May and June the 
fish swim into a series of nets in the bay before being hauled in as part of a 
great communal effort. Their flesh is then processed in factories like Herpac, 
where commercial director Jose Vazquez Varo showed me aground. Again, a trip 
round a tuna processing plant might not be on everyone’s dream holiday list, 
but I found it fascinating.

 Tuna await processing at the Herpac plant. Photograph: Ed Cumming 
The cutting of the tuna is called the ronqueo, from the Spanish word for 
“snore”, on account of the sound the knife makes on bone. The fish is filleted 
for its various parts, and a proportion is salted, cured or canned – contrary 
to perception, high-end canned tuna is twice as expensive as the fresh variety. 
Mojama, air-dried tuna a little like fishy ham, is a prized tapas dish.

Atún lomo picante (spicy tuna) at El Campero restaurant. Photograph: Ed Cumming 
In a nearby restaurant, El Campero <http://www.restauranteelcampero.es/en/>, 
we ate a seven-course tasting menu of different parts of the fish, from cheek 
to heart. The salty, fishy broth that results from the curing was calledgarum 
in ancient Rome, where it was a valuable commodity, shipped inamphorae (tall 
jugs) around the empire. Abel Claudia, a Roman ruin a few miles down the coast 
at Bolonia beach, was once one of the centres of garum production. It’s a 
long-lasting fad, this love of tuna.

 A vegetable market in Barbate. 
I could spend a long time in this corner of Spain. The quality of life is high 
and prices reasonable. There are cheeses and vegetables as fine as the meat and 
fish, although it’s still not a haven for vegetarians. And there are plenty of 
good wines to wash the food down with.

In Jerez we toured the family-owned El Maestro Sierra 
<http://www.maestrosierra.com/nuevaweb/> bodega, where sherries waited in 
stacked black oak barrels: fino, oloroso and sweet, raisiny Pedro Ximénez. A 
few miles down the road, Sanlúcar de Barrameda is the centre of dry, salty 
manzanilla sherries. There’s plenty to keep the glutton coming back.

 Tuna carpaccio at El Campero. Photograph: Ed Cumming 
A week after I got back to London I went to a Spanish restaurant, in an 
attempt to keep the trip alive. I ate jamón, manchego cheese, razor clams, hot 
prawns soused in garlic, but felt as though I knew them for the first time. I 
thought of Armando’s happy oinkers, and 100-year old sherry. You don’t have to 
speak Spanish to understand how this land and its grub are intertwined, but a 
visit to a factory or two can help.
