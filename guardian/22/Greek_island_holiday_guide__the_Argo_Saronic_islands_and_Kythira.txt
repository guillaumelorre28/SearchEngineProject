The Argo-Saronic islands hug the coast between Piraeus, the port of Athens, 
and the Peloponnese, the stunning southern mainland of Greece. They could 
easily fill a holiday on their own but, combined with Athens and the mainland, 
would make for a trip that summed up the very best of Greece.

Having said that, and unless you’re keen to see the site where the Greeks 
defeated the Persian navy in 480 BC, Salamis is probably not worth the effort. 
Aegina (an hour by ferry from Athens) is a much better bet. The classical 
temple of Aphaea is everything you imagine a Greek temple to be and is far less 
visited than some.

Heading south around the Peloponnese coast, the islands become more upmarket 
and expensive, and are best out of season. Poros, only a long stone’s throw 
from the mainland, attracts some package tourism but is beautiful, nonetheless, 
and a great base for exploring the famous sites on the mainland (the theatre of 
Epidaurus and Mycenae among them).

Hydra ramps up the stakes, not even allowing cars or bicycles to spoil the 
island’s tranquillity. If you can afford it, its charms are obvious and have 
not gone unnoticed by the world’s artists, writers and musicians.

Spetses, a little further on, is an outpost for the remaining rich Greeks and 
the yacht crowd. Away from them, the interior is almost entirely unpopulated 
and hiking will allow you to savour the mysterious atmosphere that inspired 
John Fowles’ The Magus. Lastly, Kythira is strictly part of the Ionian islands, 
but is most easily reached from the Peloponnese. If you can make it here, you 
will be rewarded with one of the most authentic and beautiful Greek islands 
there is.

All prices are for one week’s accommodation for two in August, with breakfast 
unless otherwise stated. Prices in other months can be considerably cheaper. 
Greek taverna prices are remarkably similar, and if anything have gone down in 
the past few years. You can expect to eat well for €15-€20pp. Where a 
restaurant is cheaper or more expensive it is stated.

Where to stay
 Aeginitiko Archontiko
This 12-room hotel sits by the castle-like Markellos Tower in Aegina Town. 
There is a distinct Anatolian feel to it and Rena, the owner, has filled it 
with antiques and trinkets. Everything has a friendly, old-world feel – down to 
the authentically creaky beds. It’s a warm hearted place and the local 
breakfast is a treat.
• £350, +30 22970 24968, aeginitikoarchontiko.gr 
<http://aeginitikoarchontiko.gr>

Where to eat
 Dromaki 
Right on the town beach, just south of the harbour, this taverna has a clean 
modern take on traditional style. If you sit outside you’re right on the sand. 
It offers well-executed local dishes and, as always, it’s worth looking out for 
the daily “oven dishes”.
• Akti Toti Hatzi 4, +30 22970 24445

What to do
The Temple of Aphaea is on the other side of the island from Aegina Town, not 
far above the unlovely resort of Agia Marina. Don’t be put off: this is one not 
to miss. Almost as elegant as the Parthenon itself, the classical ruin has the 
advantage of relatively few visitors and a lovely setting in an olive grove. 
The views are pretty great, too.

 Agistri. Photograph: Alamy 
Where to stay
 Rosy’s Little Village
The little island of Agistri is just beyond Aegina, only 45 minutes by 
hydrofoil from Piraeus, but if you know where to go it can be a magical place. 
Rosy’s is a good example of this, set around a rocky cove studded with swimming 
platforms. Accommodation is simple but comfortable and welcoming.
• £350, breakfast extra, +30 22970 91610, rosyslittlevillage.com 
<http://www.rosyslittlevillage.com/>

Where to eat
 Parnassos
Rosy’s does pretty good food, but visitors should also head up to Metochi, the 
village in the hills just above it. Walk through the windy alleys and your nose 
should lead you to Parnassos, a family-run taverna. The food is good, but even 
if it weren’t, the views from the rooftop terrace make it worth the trip.
• +30 22970 91339

What to do
There’s not a lot to do on Agistri apart from chilling out. If you want to 
stir, Rosy’s can lend you bikes or kayaks, and offers trips in its motorised 
fishing boat. They also run various courses, such as yoga and shaitsu, as well 
as live music nights.

Poros Town
 Karavalos restaurant 
Where to stay
 The Lemon Tree House 
Poros, only 350 metres from the Peloponnese mainland, is a small Greek 
island-pair linked by a causeway. The main town takes up most of the smaller 
island and is a buzzing place facing a narrow strait full of boats. The terrace 
of this well-designed self-catering villa – which sleeps six comfortably, 10 
with sofabeds – just above the harbour is a great place to observe the comings 
and goings.
• £1,895, 020-8941 1700, havenonearth.co.uk

Where to eat
 Karavolos 
Just behind the cinema (follow the laughing snail signs – this is what 
karavolosmeans), this well-known taverna offers a warm welcome from hosts Theo 
(in the kitchen) and Maria. It serves all the usual favourites plus, of course, 
stewed snails.
• +30 22980 26158

What to do
The mainland is a five-minute, €1 boat ride from Poros Town. Book a tour, or 
hire a car to explore world-famous sites such as the theatre of Epidavros, the 
ancient ruins of Mycenae and Nafplio, one of the most elegant towns in Greece. 
Other delights include the Devil’s Bridge canyon behind ancient Troezen, a 
lemon forest, and the volcanic landscape of the Methana peninsula.

Kalavria, Poros
 Sirene Blue Resort, Kalavria 
Where to stay
 Sirene Blue Resort 
For a bit more peace and quiet, stay on Kalavria, the larger Poros island. The 
Sirene is in a gorgeous location above its own beach and large swimming 
platform. There are great views from the balconies, a swimming pool, tennis 
courts, roof terrace restaurant/bar and good facilities for kids.
• £700, +30 22980 22741, sireneblueresort.gr <http://www.sireneblueresort.gr/>

Where to eat
 Paradisos
This large rural tavern is in the village of Foussa, roughly in the centre of 
the island. It caters for tour groups but has a reasonably authentic Greek 
Night and does good local dishes. They are particularly proud of their wild 
rabbit (best sampled in astifado – stew with sweet onions) and homemade bread.
• 3km from Poros Town, before the Temple of Poseidon, +30 22980 23419

What to do
Vayionia Bay, on the north coast of Kalavria, is one of the best beaches on 
the island, and one of the quietest – an important consideration on this 
sometimes busy island. There’s a beach cafe and sunloungers in the summer.

Hydra Town
 Sunset restaurant 
Where to stay
 Hydra Hotel 
Hydra got its wealth from its merchant fleets and this mansion, now a boutique 
hotel, once belonged to one of its magnates. Later on it was a school, and the 
large classrooms have now been converted into luxury suites. It’s a fair walk 
to get up here, but the views are well worth the effort.
• £750, +30 22980 53420, hydra-hotel.gr <http://www.hydra-hotel.gr/> 

Where to eat
 Sunset
Eating out on Hydra can be an expensive affair by Greek standards, but you 
tend to get what you pay for. Sunset is a prime example, and would be worth it 
for its setting alone – no guessing when to come to experience its full glory. 
Fortunately the food, a blend of Italian and Greek focusing on seafood, is 
rather fine as well.
• +30 22980 52067, sunsethydra.com <http://sunsethydra.com/>, expensive

What to do
Just wandering the car-free alleys of town is joy enough on Hydra. After the 
decline of its merchant fleets, the island was rediscovered by Greek and 
foreign artists and musicians during the 1960s – Leonard Cohen still has a 
house here – and there are always exhibitions or cultural events to stumble 
upon.

 Petroleka Pension. Photograph: Alamy 
Where to stay
 Petroleka Pension
There are some amazing places to stay in Hydra Town, from boutique hotels to 
private villas with butlers. For accommodation on a budget you may need to go a 
little further afield. The little village of Kamini is only a 10-minute walk 
away, or a short water taxi ride. The Petroleka has a studio for two and a 
two-bedroom apartment; both are simple but well done, and sit just above the 
crystal waters of the pebble beach.
• £400, +30 69779 46429, petrolekapension.gr <http://www.petrolekapension.gr/> 

Where to eat
Ke Kremmidi
To eat cheaply, best head back into town. Although a bit smarter than most, Ke 
Kremmidi is essentially a kebab joint. A couple of sublime lamb-filled pittas 
each (more than enough for most appetites) and half a litre of wine will set 
cost a grand total of €15.
• +30 69726 05126, cheap

What to do
Apart from the coast either side of Hydra Town, most of the island is wild and 
uninhabited. It does reward those prepared to go hiking, however. There are 
local maps available and many of the routes are signposted, though it’s best to 
get local advice. To complete the experience, get a water taxi to pick you up 
from one of several coves that you can trek to.

Spetses Town
 Orloff Resort 
Where to stay
 Orloff Resort
Not far from the waterfront is this extremely chic hideaway. It’s in the 
grounds of a 19th-century mansion, but you wouldn’t guess this from the 
white-washed buildings set among olive trees and round a lovely pool.
• £1,070, +30 22980 75444, orloffresort.com <http://www.orloffresort.com/>

Where to eat
 Clock 
The harbour area of town, called the Dapia, is where most things go on, but 
some of the restaurants can be surprisingly pricy. For something a bit 
different, Clock, on the main square, does good burgers and fries as well as 
that rarity for Greece, a tasty pizza, all at low prices.
• +30 22980 72259, cheap

What to do
A single road makes a loop round Spetses, and it can be used to explore the 
island’s many beaches. One of the most popular is the sand and shingle bay of 
Ayia Anargyri., on the opposite side from Spetses Town. There is a taverna and 
watersports centre here, but for the best adventure, explore Berkiris’s cave, 
beyond the western end. Follow the path and then the steps down into the back 
of the cave, then dare yourself to swim out through the narrow exit. Islanders 
hid in the cave when the island was invaded by Albanians in 1770, and it was 
also a refuge for a wounded British pilot in the second world war.

 Niki Rooms
Kythira often feels like the Greece of 20 or 30 years ago. Niki, in the 
beautiful hilltop capital of Hora, is a sprawling complex of whitewashed 
buildings with all manner of rooms, studios and apartments. Rooms are plain but 
do have aircon and can be an absolute bargain.

This grill house is so old-fashioned the waiters still dress in white shirts 
and black waistcoats. In the summer it opens a terrace on top of a roof just 
down the lane.
• +30 27360 31655

What to do
 Just down the hill from Hora is the little port of Kapsali, with a beach 
that’s sandy at one end, shingle at the other. In the distance the rock of 
Hytra can be seen jutting out of the sea: it’s one of the reputed birthplaces 
of Aphrodite. Captain Spiros will take you there on his glass-bottomed boat, 
which has a surprising turn of speed, and then lead you for a swim through its 
caves.

Where to eat
 Panaretos
Just up the road is Potamos, now the main hub of the island. There’s a market 
on Sunday mornings in the main square, and you get a ringside seat from this 
taverna. The market is as much a social event as anything else, and this is a 
superb place to have an early lunch and people watch.
• +30 27360 34290

What to do
One spot not to miss is Paleohora, the medieval capital of the island. Now 
mostly in ruins, it is worth a visit for the stunning views as it is almost 
entirely surrounded by deep gorges. The lazy can even drive here (although it 
is dirt road for the last bit).

Getting there

The islands are best approached by flying to Athens and then either driving 
into the Peloponnes or getting the ferry or hydrofoil from Piraeus. Kythira can 
be reached directly from Piraeus as well, but it’s more fun to explore the 
Peloponnese and then get a ferry from Neapoli (daily). Another option is a
budget flight <http://www.easyjet.com/en/> to Kalamata and a ferry (weekly in 
season). There are alsoflights from Athens to Kythira  
<http://en.aegeanair.com/>for those in a rush.
