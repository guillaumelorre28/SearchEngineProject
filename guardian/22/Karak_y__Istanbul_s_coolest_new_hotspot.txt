Once a thriving port, Karaköy fell on hard times in the 20th century, and 
magnificent commercial edifices were divided into workshops. The opening of the 
nearbyIstanbul Modern <http://www.istanbulmodern.org/en> art gallery in 2004 
sparked a renaissance that has gained momentum in the past couple of years. 
Now, hardware stores rub shoulders with galleries, restaurants and boutiques, 
creating a dynamic blend of urban grit and glitter. Hoping to cash in on this 
cachet is a swath of soon-to-open hotels, so Karaköy's days as an "in-the-know" 
hideout may be numbered.
