James Van Der Beek is set to play a fictional version of DJ Diplo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/diplo> in Viceland’s first scripted TV show.

According to Deadline 
<http://deadline.com/2017/01/what-would-diplo-do-james-van-der-beek-comedy-viceland-first-scripted-series-1201878143/>
, the actor, known for roles in Dawson’s Creek and The Rules of Attraction, 
will headline What Would Diplo Do? as well as write, executive produce and act 
as showrunner. The Grammy award-winning musician will also produce for the 
Vice-owned channel.

“The show doesn’t take itself too serious, but it’s not cynical,” Van Der Beek 
said. It’s been described as a “collection of parables” that can be likened to 
Louie and This is Spinal Tap.

“I’ve enjoyed deconstructing my own image quite a bit over the years, but to 
have the chance to do it with a global megastar like Diplo who’s letting us to 
do something fun and ridiculous that few people have the balls to allow is 
crazy,” said Van Der Beek, who played himself in sitcom Don’t Trust the B---- 
in Apartment 23. “To get to work with this creative team within a Viceland 
aesthetic is fun on a whole new level.”

The show will also be overseen by film-maker Spike Jonze, who acts as 
Viceland’s co-president. It stems from a concert promo starring Van Der Beek 
called Day in the Life of Diplo.

“When James was in the office a few weeks ago, he told me the storylines he 
had sketched out, they were, of course, funny; one even got me emotional, which 
made it that much more funny,” Jonze said. This idea has gotten inside James 
which makes me really excited to see what he makes and happy to have it on our 
channel.”
