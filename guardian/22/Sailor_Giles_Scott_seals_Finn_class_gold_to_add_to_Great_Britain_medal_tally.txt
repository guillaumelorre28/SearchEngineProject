The 29-year-old was all but guaranteed to win gold having amassed an 
insurmountable points tally coming into the final race and simply had to turn 
up and partake in the race to secure glory. Slovenia’s Vasilij Zbogar and USA’s 
Caleb Paine won silver and bronze, respectively.

Scott, who sails for Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup syndicate, finished a 
frustrating 17th in the scrappy first race but improved through the 
competition, winning three of his 10 races, with two second-place finishes and 
two thirds.

The medal adds to a string of British success both on the water and in the 
velodrome over the past few days which leaves Team GB behind only USA in the
overall table
