southernMalawi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/malawi>. But Christopher 
Witimani, Lilian Matafle and their seven children and four grandchildren had 
nothing to celebrate last week as they picked their meagre maize crop.

Last year’s drought, followed by erratic rains, hit the village of Nkhotakota 
hard. But this year the rains never came and, for a second year running, the 
family grain store is empty. If they manage their savings carefully and eat 
just one small meal a day, they may just have enough food for two more months.

By August, said Irish charity Concern Worldwide <https://www.concern.net/en/>, 
they and tens of thousands of other small farmers in southern Malawi will have 
completely run out of food, with no prospect of another harvest for at least 
seven months. With nothing to sell and no chance of earning money, Witimani, 
Matafle and family will starve.

“I am worried the children will starve to death. I don’t know what to do,” 
said Matafle.

“We need food. We are in a desperate situation,” her husband added.

Countries are just waking up to the most serious global food crisis of the 
last 25 years. Caused by the strongestEl Niño weather event 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/17/el-nino-leaves-100-million-people-hungry-short-of-water-droughts-floods-worldwide>
 since 1982, droughts and heatwaves have ravaged much of India, Latin America 
and parts of south-east Asia. But the worst effects of this natural phenomenon, 
which begins with waters warming in the equatorial Pacific, are to be found in 
southern Africa. A second consecutive year without rain now threatens 
catastrophe for some of the poorest people in the world.

The scale of the crisis unfolding in 10 or more southern African countries has 
shocked theUnited Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations>. 
Lulled into thinking that Ethiopia in 1985 was the last of the large-scale 
famines affecting many millions, donor countries have been slow to pledge funds 
or support. More than $650m and 7.9m tonnes of food are needed immediately, 
says the UN. By Christmas, the situation will have become severe.

Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Madagascar, Angola and 
Swaziland have already declared national emergencies or disasters, as have 
seven of South Africa’s nine provinces. Other countries, including Botswana and 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have also been badly hit. President 
Robert Mugabe has appealed for $1.5bn to buy food for Zimbabwe and Malawi is 
expected to declare that more than 8 million people, or half the country, will 
need food aid by November.

More than 31 million people in the region are said by the UN to need food now, 
but this number is expected to rise to at least 49 million across almost all of 
southernAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> by Christmas. With 12 
million more hungry people in Ethiopia, 7 million in Yemen, 6 million in 
Southern Sudan and more in the Central African Republic and Chad, a 
continent-scale food crisis is unfolding.

“Food security across southern Africa will start deteriorating by July, 
reaching its peak between December 2016 and April 2017,” says the UN’s office 
for humanitarian affairs. The regional cereal deficit already stands at 7.9m 
tonnes and continues to put upward pressure on market prices, which are already 
showing unprecedented increases, diminishing purchasing power and thereby 
reducing food access. As food insecurity tightens and water scarcity increases 
due to the drought, there are early signs of acute malnutrition in Madagascar, 
Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabawe.

For Coco Ushiyama, head of the UN’s World Food Programme in Lilongwe, Malawi’s 
capital, just working out how to import a million tonnes of food, needed to 
support between five million and eight million people in Malawi over the next 
12 months, is proving nightmarishly difficult. With no guarantees of money from 
donors, she cannot buy the food on the open market, or book ships and transport.

“We are very concerned. Last year, like many other countries in the region, 
Malawi had a double disaster with erratic rains and then floods which led into 
droughts,” said Ushiyama. “Last year, 2.8 million people were affected. Then we 
had a deficit of 220,000 tonnes of food. This year, we are anticipating it will 
be four times as bad. The maize price is already exceptionally high.

“We are monitoring 50 markets throughout the country and already they are 
seeing abnormally high prices. We have very worryingly high admission rates for 
childhood malnutrition in health clinics. In some areas it is very serious 
already and it is likely to get much more serious. It will be a regional 
issue,” she said.

The government has declared a disaster and will publish a new assessment of 
its needs in the next few weeks. The vice-president, Saulos Chilima, has said 
that about 1.3m tonnes of maize will be needed.

Politicians may talk of going on to the world market to buy a million tonnes 
of maize, but Ushiyama is unsure where it will come from. There is usually 
enough food in the region, but South Africa, which usually exports a million 
tonnes of food a year, will need to import 3.5m tonnes this year. Only Zambia 
may have enough food to export and it has imposed restrictions, she said.

“South Africa is in trouble. Nearby Zambia has had a better harvest than most 
countries but it has put export restrictions on its food. If we import it [from 
outside Africa], the food will take four to six months [to arrive]. We have 
learned from experience that the rains start in November so the roads will be 
terrible when the food is most needed and some lorry drivers will refuse to 
come. By November, we will need to have pre-positioned food in key areas. But 
to get it there by then means ordering the food right now,” she said.

Finding the cash to feed possibly 50 million people for eight or more months 
is the biggest problem of all, says the UN, because Africa’s slow-burn crisis 
must compete with Middle East wars, refugees and natural disasters for 
attention. According to the UN, which is holding an unprecedentedhumanitarian 
summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/world-humanitarian-summit> this 
week in Istanbul, 125 million people worldwide need long-term assistance and a 
further 60 million have been forced from their homes by war, violence and 
disaster.

More than $1.5bn has been requested by southern African governments, says 
Ocha, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, but less 
than a quarter of this has been pledged. Officially, the deficit is $677 
million (87%) but this will grow when countries complete their assessments of 
the harvests in the next few weeks.

“The window for responding in a meaningful manner is closing rapidly,” said 
Shadrack Omol, senior adviser to the UN children’s fund, Unicef. “The concern 
is that slow-onset emergencies, like the one we are dealing with in southern 
Africa, do not get enough attention because they creep up on us.”

John Makina, Oxfam country director in Malawi, said: “The donors just do not 
have the money; there is donor fatigue. Malawi has been hit by drought, then 
floods, then drought. The donors are getting tired of it. In 2015, Malawi alone 
needed $170m. In 2016-17, it will be far more.

“The full impact will be felt from October to March 2017. It’s looking really 
bad. The most affected will be the poorest and jobless. They will end up 
selling what little they possess. The price of maize flour has already gone to 
9,000 kwachas (£8.70) for 50kg. It will double again for sure,” he said.

International development minister Nick Hurd, who has visited Mozambique, 
wants Britain to lead the humanitarian effort. But money cannot be given 
directly to the country following a corruption scandal, and the government must 
work through a consortium of NGOs, providing food vouchers, medical aid and 
food-for-work schemes.

“We cannot and will not stand idly by while millions suffer. Britain is 
playing a leading role in helping countries across Africa to cope with the 
impact of El Niño. Support for people affected by El Niño is important to 
Africa and also firmly in Britain’s national interest,” says Hurd.

In villages across southern Africa, people are fearful, unsure how they will 
survive. In Mozambique, where Britain is contributing £11.8m over three years, 
some food aid has arrived in the village of Mblalava.

The women are ecstatic: “It’s been two and a half years since we had good 
rain,” said Rosita Chauque, a mother of three. “When the drought started we 
used to be able to find vegetables in the bush, but even these have gone now. 
We used to make and sell charcoal, but there are so many other people doing 
that now it’s not possible. We have thought of leaving, but where to? We have 
no crops in the fields, no food for the cattle and nothing for ourselves. There 
is no water, no grass. People are selling their animals. They have no other 
resources. There is a lot of suffering.”

“The situation is critical,” said Abdoulaye Balde, the World Food Programme 
country director in Mozambique’s capital, Maputo. “We are at the point of no 
return.”

Droughts and “hungry seasons” are common throughout southern Africa, but the 
breadth of this year’s crisis is very unusual, says Caoimhe de Barra, Malawi 
country director of Concern Worldwide. Her frontline workers see rural people 
already employing traditional coping strategies, including eating wild foods, 
taking children out of school, selling their animals and assets.

“Early action is key. If we can start supporting people now, we can save lives 
and prevent an even worse situation later this year. People are not currently 
dying of hunger but the overall health of the population will be severely 
affected by hunger-related illnesses. Malnutrition will blight the life chances 
of countless more Malawian children,” she said.

The secretary general of the International Red Cross, Elhadj As Sy, who 
visited Malawi and Zimbabwe last week, said: “Much more needs to be done to 
support communities to survive and strive over the coming months. We met 
families who have received no external support and who are simply desperate. We 
need to urgently scale up our interventions to prevent this situation from 
becoming a catastrophe,” he said.

Relief from Africa’s long drought may finally be coming, says the World 
Meteorological Organisation, which is monitoring the temperature of waters in 
the Pacific. These are said to be cooling rapidly and are expected to be 
“neutral” by mid-June. That, says the UN, signals the coming end of the El 
Niño, the droughts and the worldwide heatwaves.

The effects, however, will not be felt in southern Africa until April 2017 
when the next main harvest should be in. But, says the WMO, there may be a 
sting in the tale. There is a 50:50 chance that the continent will be hit from 
September by El Niño’s climatic “twin”, known as La Niña, which develops as the 
Pacific Ocean equatorial waters cool after an El Niño.

Instead of droughts, La Niña usually brings heavier monsoon rains in 
south-east Asia and much cooler and wetter conditions in southern Africa.

“We pray hard for rain and then we must pray harder that it stops. Is there no 
end of extreme weather?” said Malawian villager Richard Kapenda.
