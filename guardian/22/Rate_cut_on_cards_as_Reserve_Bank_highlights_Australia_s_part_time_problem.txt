Economists are warning the Reserve Bank could cut interest rates again this 
year, pulling them well below Joe Hockey’s so-called “emergency levels,” 
because it has admitted it is finding it harder to gauge momentum in the labour 
market.

The RBA published its much-anticipated quarterly statement on monetary policy 
<http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2016/aug/> on Friday, providing rich 
insight into its view of the economy.

It shows the RBA has become more uncertain about the health of the labour 
market, because even though it had anticipated slower employment growth this 
year, recent forward indicators – such as job ads and vacancies – have been 
mixed, and there has been strong growth in part-time jobs and workers desiring 
longer hours.

Interest rates: why the Reserve Bank of Australia has been cutting away

“The share of workers who would like to work more hours has been little 
changed over the past two years and is at a high level,” the RBA statement 
warns.

“That is, the underemployment rate (which captures the number of workers who 
would like more hours, as a share of the labour force) has not fallen by as 
much as the unemployment rate over the past year.

“Low growth in a range of wage measures is also consistent with a degree of 
spare capacity in the labour market.”

The unemployment rate is 5.7% 
<http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6202.0>. It has not been below 5.7% 
since April 2013.

NAB’s chief economist, Ivan Colhoun, said most of the risks cited by the RBA 
concern a weaker rather than a stronger outlook.

“Today’s statement therefore suggests that despite the further easing by the 
RBA in August, the risk of additional monetary action remains significant,” he 
said,

The RBA cut the cash rate to a record low of 1.5% this week, citing anaemic 
inflation and record low wages growth.

The treasurer, Scott Morrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison>, insisted it did 
not mean the economy was struggling, but the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, 
said it made a mockery of the Coalition’s “jobs and growth” slogan.

On Friday, the Parliamentary Budget Office published its review of the 
election promises of the Coalition, Labor and the Greens 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Budget_Office/2016_post-election_report>
 showing what impact they would have on the budget.

It says the Coalition made election promises that will improve the budget 
bottom line by $1.1bn over four years.

The Greens’ election commitments would improve the budget bottom line by 
$8.2bn over four years, while Labor’s would have a negative impact of $16.6bn, 
it said.

The report does not provide substantial figures beyond the four-year budget 
estimates period.

Morrison said the PBO report showed Labor had learnt nothing from their “past 
budget failures, and would simply lock in higher spending and higher budget 
deficits, if given the chance”.

Bowen said the government’s budget was “propped up by unfair ‘zombie 
measures’” which will not pass the parliament, destroying the credibility of 
its fiscal position.

“At the same time, it has tripled the deficit, added $100bn to net debt and 
put Australia’s triple-A credit rating at risk,” he said.
