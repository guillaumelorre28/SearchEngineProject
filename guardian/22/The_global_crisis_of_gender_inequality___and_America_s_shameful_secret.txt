Girls face inequality from the moment they are conceived, and it continues 
throughout their lives – that was the message of ouranimation to mark 
International Day of the Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2016/oct/11/a-girls-life-how-inequality-starts-before-birth-video-international-day-of-the-girl>
. The statistics on the lack of gender parity in education, health, marriage 
and employment are alarming: for example,twice as many girls as boys 
<http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/twice_as_many_girls_as_boys_will_never_start_school_says_unesco_eatlas_launched_in_advance_of_international_womens_day/#.V_yfgTYrLAx>
 will never start school, and one in four girls globally are married before 
they reach 18. World leaders have promised to achievegender equality by 2030 
<https://europa.eu/eyd2015/en/un-women/events/european-development-days-high-level-panel-gender-equality>
 – but at the current rate of progress this will take more than 100 years.

We also reported on a study from Save the Children, which found that the US 
ranks lower than Kazakhstan and Algeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/11/us-united-states-ranks-lower-than-kazakhstan-algeria-gender-equality-international-day-of-the-girl>
 on gender equality, due to its low representation of women in parliament, high 
teenage pregnancy rates and and record onmaternal deaths 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/opinion/sunday/americas-shocking-maternal-deaths.html?_r=0>
. Niger was named the worst country in theGirls’ Opportunity Index 
<https://assets.savethechildren.ch/downloads/index_only_every_last_girl_print_version_inside_pages_3_10_16_3_.pdf>
: ithas the highest rate of child marriage in the world 
<http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/where-does-it-happen/>, with 76% of women now 
aged 20 to 24 married before they were 18.

Students Speak

We asked for your views on the legacy of the outgoing UN secretary general, 
Ban Ki-Moon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/14/students-speak-ban-ki-moon-united-nations-reign-was-gender-rights-success-but-peacekeeping-failure>
. Students hailed his work on gender equality, but said he failed to protect 
civilians from conflict.

What you said

On Ben Ramalingam’s opinion piece about tackling global health inequality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/09/healthcare-innovations-wont-cure-global-health-inequality-political-action-will-world-health-summit-berlin>
,Siameez said:

It seems to me that putting resources into accessible clean water, good 
sanitation, basic health education, pre- and post-natal care, vaccination 
programmes and such would have huge improvements in health outcomes for the 
greatest number of people …

I’m not saying medical technology should be denied, but that the basic health 
problems that are so common in poor societies should be addressed first, and 
will have the most benefit in health improvement.
