To further investigate the significance of nudity today AGNSW commissioned a 
project to recreate Rodin’s classic sculptureThe Kiss as part of its exhibition 
Nude: Art from the Tate Collection.

Seven Sydney couples took it in turns to remove their clothes and arrange 
themselves in the pose. We spoke to a few of the couples who posed nude about 
taking part, why they wanted to be involved and why being nude is still such a 
tricky topic.

Each of the couples who took part saw the experience very differently. Here 
are three of their stories.

LUCY L AND LUCY W

Lucy L is a 25-year-old photographer, teacher and recent art school honours 
graduate.

Lucy W is a 26-year-old doing a PhD in media. She’s also an editor and 
freelance journalist.

The motives

Lucy L: I found the concept really interesting and I’m happy to be involved in 
anything in the art world. In art school I did a lot of nude photography and 
film. I’ve got no issues with my own nudity.

Lucy W: I wanted the challenge of being naked. I wanted to try and be more 
comfortable in my body.

The pose

Lucy L: It wasn’t a natural pose for us. We’d never be sitting on a rock 
making out.

Lucy W: I was really nervous. I know the theory - every body is beautiful - 
but I was sitting there thinking, does my belly look big in this? What are my 
thighs doing? It was frustrating... And I got so caught up in recreating the 
pose, right down to the hand placements.

Lucy L: I found the posing really frustrating.

Lucy W: I was doing the lady’s position and she has to lean back and lean to 
the side. I was conscious of not giving Lucy a dead leg. It hurt my neck and 
back.

Lucy L: I’m not very good at being uncomfortable. Being that close to Lucy, it 
sounds ridiculous, but I felt like she was stealing my air. That got to me, and 
I got worked up.

Lucy W: We sound really intimate, don’t we.

Lucy L: Obviously in natural circumstances I don’t have that problem.

Reflection

Lucy W: Seeing the sculpture was hard. I didn’t like the way I looked and 
wasn’t I expecting to be that thrown by it. It’s just so real. My belly looks 
really big, stupid stuff like that

Lucy L: I’m really happy that we went through it.

Lucy W: Same. Even though I felt a bit self-conscious about the way it turned 
out, I think it’s important to be like, fuck it, let the world see who I am. 
And being part of this is really cool. It’s really exciting to be alongside all 
these huge artists.

Lucy L: Not many people get this opportunity. I’m pretty stoked to be part of 
queer visibility… The nude as a concept isn’t just about beauty, it’s about 
more than just a body, it’s a political form.

The motives

Oscar: It’s not every day you get to recreate a famous sculpture. 

Maddy: It was a chance to get out of our comfort zone. We’ve done nothing like 
this before.

The pose

Oscar: It’s pretty nerve-wracking, getting your kit off in front of a whole 
bunch of photographers and sound guys and 3D printers.

Maddy: I was a bit anxious but I quickly took my robe off and we got on the 
rock to recreate the sculpture and I got more calm. It helped doing it with 
someone I trusted.

Oscar: I was the same. A bit anxious before taking off the robe, then while 
the sculpture and video were being made I felt a lot of passion, I felt 
energised by the act of kissing and all that… it was quite an intimate 
experience.

Reflection

Maddy: We haven’t seen the exhibition yet. My dad was at the exhibition today 
and he sent me some photos. I’m a bit nervous now that people are seeing it, 
like my dad.

Oscar: I’m quite proud of it. Not showing off my bits. I’m proud of that fact 
that I got out of my comfort zone.

Maddy: I think this was a good thing to do to gain confidence. It’s like a 
public thing, saying, I’m OK with my body. All the women in the Roman statues 
had a bit of fat on them so I don’t feel so bad.

Oscar: My attitude towards nudity hasn’t changed because of this but it has 
made me think about what my attitude is. I’ve discovered that I don’t share my 
nudity much but I’m comfortable with my body and what nudity is.

Maddy: It was a very exciting thing to do together. We’ll always have that 
weird, quirky memory of the time we got naked for the art gallery. I’d 
recommend more people try to get out of their comfort zone. You don’t always 
have to get naked to do that but it’s a good start.

Oscar: If you’re not sure how you feel about nudity, get nude.

JAQI AND AL

Jaqi, 54 is an artist and life model, and former dancer with the Australian 
Ballet.

Al, 59, is a landscape gardener.

The motives


Jaqi: This kind of thing is right up my alley. Life modelling is something 
I’ve done as a sort of day job for more than 10 years. The interaction between 
the model and the artist is a really satisfying creative process.

Al: I wanted to see what it was like to be part of Jaqi’s world. 

Jaqi: As a dancer, nudity is part of your stock in trade. Your body is the 
primary tool that you work with and you get pretty pragmatic about it.

Al: I’m pretty conservative about nudity really.

Jaqi: I wouldn’t say that. He’s actually quite relaxed about nudity. He’s an 
ex-surfer so he’s used to stripping off beside the car.

Al: The more I think about it, the more I think it’s strange that people carry 
on the way they do about nudity. If you see a man with his shirt off you don’t 
think too much about it, but if you see a woman with her shirt off, it’s all 
goggles, if you know what I mean. It’s she’s this, or she’s that, or whatever. 
I just think that’s wrong as I’m getting older.

The pose

Al: I was fascinated by the backstage thing. I was amazed by how many hands it 
takes. And how organised they were. The film set, the trucks, the equipment… it 
was mind-boggling.

Jaqi: I love being on film sets, but I only discovered that in my early 40s, 
when work dries up for women in those industries. Al was fascinated to find 
himself sitting around in the nude being asked questions by people behind very 
bright lights, but we knew who they were and it was set up not to be 
intimidating.

Al: I take my hat off to them. It was that relaxing, you forgot you didn’t 
have any clothes on.

 Sculpture of Jaqi and Alan Nude: Art from the Tate collection Photograph: The 
Glue Society/Art Gallery of NSW 
Reflection

Jaqi: The statue is extraordinary. I’m used to seeing myself sculpted but this 
isn’t a rendition, this is an electronic scan so it’s meticulously detailed. 
These figures are only a few inches high but they look like they could get up 
and walk away they’re so real.

Al: I’m can’t believe I’m that skinny. When you see yourself in the mirror you 
dismiss the imperfections.

Jaqi: You see yourself the way you were when you were young.

Al: Then you see the digital image, you can’t argue with it. You can’t blame 
the artist, you can’t blame anyone but yourself, and that’s really weird. I 
recommend you get it done.

Jaqi: I was a bit relieved. I know my body well but I was a little bit worried 
that when I saw the figurine I would be worse than I am. But I wasn’t.

Al: I don’t think I’m going to take my shirt off as often as I do.

Jaqi: Oh, darling, you’re still beautiful.

Al: I’m not the man I used to be, and that’s going to stay in the back of my 
head. I’d do it again very quickly but it was a reality check.

Jaqi: The big thrill for me is we get to keep the little statue.

Al: It’ll be a nice doorstop.

Jaqi: It can go on the mantelpiece.
