I am like a firefighter: my pants are hung up waiting for me, so I just 
get up, wash, jump into my clothing and get out of the house. It takes me all 
of 10 minutes.

I order all my clothing online: merino wool T-shirts and underwear, hiking 
pants and suspenders (braces) byMary Jane Lane <http://www.maryjanelane.com>. I 
wear the same basic outfit every day.

I think I would like clothes a lot more if I were 20lb lighter. I am not 
embarrassed by my waistline but, when I see pictures of myself, I know that I 
could do better weight-wise. That’s something I am working on, though: I go 
hiking and I also jump rope and do sit-ups.

I haven’t had my hair cut in many years. Every week, a stylist comes to my 
house and washes it. I just moved to Los Angeles and I have an outdoor sink, so 
I don’t have to go to a salon, which is cool.

The stylist brushes out my hair first, then I lie back and she washes my hair, 
then she brushes it out one more time to finish. I don’t like to use a 
hairdryer, so I just leave it to dry naturally.

I let my beard grow out and just get it trimmed when it starts to look a 
little stupid – there are a couple of places I go to in the neighbourhood, or I 
might get it trimmed atThe Late Late Show With James Corden 
<http://www.cbs.com/shows/late-late-show/>, where I’m the band leader. I did 
try beard oil for a while, but I never got the point of it. I used to wear 
cologne, too, but now I don’t use any of that stuff.

I wear makeup if I am doing TV, but someone does it for me – I would look like 
a clown if I did it myself.
