Priti Patel, the international development secretary, demands better “value

, 26 October). It’s time to start applying these principles to the full extent 
of the UK’s role in global poverty. Whether through enabling tax-dodging, the 
actions of our corporations, or our contributions to climate change, the UK 
causes far more poverty in the world than its aid budget can ever compensate 
for.

In 2013, over $1tn in illicit financial flows was stolen from poor countries; 
55% of illicit flows are estimated to end up in rich countries, 45% in tax 
havens. With 10 tax havens under our jurisdiction, the UK is at the heart of 
this theft.

Giving money to alleviate poverty, while at the same time enabling it, is not 
transparent, not accountable, and does not provide value for money. Aid is, at 
best, meagre compensation towards the damage caused. Transparency and 
accountability in aid spending is reasonable; it’s time we start applying these 
principles to the full extent of our relationship with the world.
