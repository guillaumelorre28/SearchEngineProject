“I talk funny cause I come from Canada.” So says comedian Katherine Ryan, 
winner of the 2008 Nivea Funny Women award, finalist on BBC1’s Let’s Dance for 
Comic Relief and a familiar face on Mock the Week, 8 Out of 10 cats and QI. The 
Guardian called her latest live show “heartfelt, gossipy and sharp-tongued”.

Ryan made her screen debut at the age of 18, presenting the Canadian reality 
show Teens Dating, but somehow ended up working at Hooters, the restaurant 
chain known more for its scantily dressed waitresses than for its food. She 
even thought about opening her own branch of this “delightfully tacky yet 
unrefined” operation.

Now 30 and the mother of a four-year-old daughter, she calls herself “a 
typical British mum – a young, uneducated immigrant”. More than a little 
obsessed with Beyoncé, she recently announced, “All I’ve ever wanted to be is a 
strong, powerful, beautiful black woman.” “What I meant,” she explained, “is 
that I’d love to have the confidence in and ownership of my sexuality that 
Beyoncé appears to have. She’s sexy on her own terms and comes across as 
completely authentic to me.”

Katherine came into the Guardian to answer your questions live.

You've appeared on Mock the Week, a format notorious for favouring the louder, 
more robust, male comedians. I thought you did a great job – what's the secret 
of getting your contribution heard in such a challenging environment?

I don't worry about whether or not people like me. What kind of person would I 
be if I expected everyone to like me? I just enjoy the experience of being next 
to my favourite comedians. I'm glad you like the result. x

What aspects of British life do you find bizare and strange and do we provide 
excellent comedy material that we are completely oblivious to?

I love Britain. I'm an Irish citizen, but I was born in Canada, and I'm a 
British comedian really. My entire career has been over here. And now I'm a 
British mum too.

I do find your level of patience funny. And your reluctance to speak up if 
someone pushes in a queue for example. But that's also very dangerous. Speak 
up, Britain!

I love all the accents. Drive five minutes down the road and it's like a whole 
new language.

You drink a lot - WAY TOO MUCH - and will sit on a patio for a pint when it's 
raining.

You're very, very funny, but I can only say that because I respect you so much 
too.

What is the most difficult aspect of a comedian for you? In what way does 
being a woman make it harder and in what, easier?

You're great! And to hold your own on Mock the Week is no mean feat!

I'm aways surprised that we see you hosting more shows, I hope that changes in 
the future.

Katherine, would you consider providing grooming, dietary and life skill tips 
to the current crop of UK female comedians?

Also some advice on what is funny would help.

Some of the things you say could be interpreted as controversial, but so far 
you have managed to avoid too much controversy. As your career gathers pace, 
and the tabloids take notice, are you more aware of what you can/can't say? Or 
do you just not give a shit?

There's been controversy. Not in the tabloids as they've been busy helpfully 
outing peados and pointing out celebrity cellulite mostly, but you're right, 
who know what may piss them off in the future. I don't seek to be 
controversial, but I don't mind it either. There's always someone who's going 
to be offended. I try to be fair and not take too much notice.

Was it your time with Hooter's that gave you the seriousness of going into 
performing comedy, and what was it?

I did my first open mic gig while waitressing at Hooters restaurant next door. 
I looked at comedy like a gym for keeping my mind sharp at work and at uni. 
It's a long story, but I'm very fond of my time as a Hooters Girl. It's 
certainly something that I look at very differently than I did ten years ago, 
but I was a silly girl back then - In a group of other silly girls, who I 
formed deep friendships with and who are all now amazing women. It's like being 
a cheerleader or beauty pageant contestant, we were objectified, but didn't 
understand. Dressing identically to everyone else and serving customers chicken 
with a smile forced me to develop a very strong voice that I'm grateful for 
today.

Having performed in both big and small venues, do have a preference when it 
comes to the audience size you are performing to?

Also did you get to keep your costume from Let's Dance and if so, has it made 
an appearance for Halloween yet??

It's great to do both because I think different material works for varying 
crowd sizes. It's really fun to be physical and sharp in a big room, but I can 
get away with more storytelling in the basement of a pub.

The Let's Dance Nicki Minaj suit was a collaboration of ideas, and the costume 
department worked hard and imaginatively to make it overnight. I certainly 
don't own it. It's a work of art. And it's theirs. Who knows what they get up 
to with it though...

I don't want to encourage bad behaviour, but I do love a heckler. A SMART 
heckler who isn't pissed & trying to ruin the show for everyone else. It's not 
my experience, but there's a green room story about the best heckle ever and I 
think it goes:
Comedian: So I'm a schizophrenic. 
Heckler: F-off then, the both of you!
