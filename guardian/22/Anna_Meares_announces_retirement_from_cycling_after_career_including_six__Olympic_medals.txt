The Australian cycling champion Anna Meares has announced her retirement after 
a career including six Olympic medals.

“Obviously a lot of people have been wondering where I’m going to go to post 
Rio and, with some reflection, I’ve decided that I’m actually going to retire,” 
she told Weekend Today on Channel Nine.

She had hinted at a major announcement on Twitter earlier on Sunday.

Meares represented Australia at four Olympics and is Australia’s most 
decorated cyclist at the Games.

Meares won gold in the 500m time trial and bronze in the sprint in Athens in 
2004.

After breaking her neck in a crash in January 2008, she won sprint silver at 
Beijing’s 2008 Olympics just seven months later.

.

On Sunday, she revealed she needed several pain-killing injections in her 
spine to compete at the Games in Rio.

“Having looked back and seen all the things that I have achieved and assessed 
some of the injuries that I have had to manage going into Rio,” Meares said.


“Most people were unaware just to get to Rio I had six cortisone injections 
through my spine.


“Having had to change tack for six months leading into it and to achieve the 
things I have, I feel satisfied and happy to step aside from the sport and try 
something new and different.”

After the Rio Olympics the 11-time world champion had said she intended to 
take some time

 to catch her breath and spend time with her family before coming to a decision 
about her future.

“I didn’t get a fairy tale ending [to these Olympic Games] but I had a good 
ending,” she said.
