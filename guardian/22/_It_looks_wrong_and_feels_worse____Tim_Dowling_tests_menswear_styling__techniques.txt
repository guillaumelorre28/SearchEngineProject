According to the Guardian’s fashion desk, I could become instantly more 
fashionable without adjusting my wardrobe, or spending any money. It’s not even 
about what I’m wearing – it’s about the way I style my clothes. The trick, 
apparently, is to take my cues from the sort of men who get photographed 
outside fashion shows. These men - I’ve seen pictures of them - have developed 
a secret uniform of styling eccentricities: they wear their coats like capes, 
and go through life sockless. So, here I attempt the top five street-style 
trends for men this season. All clothes and accessories are, for better or 
worse, the model’s own.

1. Shoulder-robing

Putting your coat over your shoulders like a cape isn’t new, but no one used 
to call it shoulder-robing. The only thing new about it is that apparently it’s 
no longer stupid.

for the Guardian 
The best thing I can say about shoulder-robing is that size is not an issue, 
because you are not actually wearing the coat in question. However, as a 
result, it’s a highly unstable arrangement; when I shoulder-robed my way down 
to the shops, my coat blew away. Anyway, I think I lack the insouciance 
required to carry this look off; it looks as if I have broken one of my arms. 
People hold doors open for you, but that’s about the only benefit I can see.


2. Complex scarf drapery

At first, I couldn’t find anything generous enough to replicate this look – 
you can’t do it with an old QPR scarf – so I ended up using a big pashmina I 
found in a cupboard. I also struggled to get the right casual draping; I think 
you want it to look as if the scarf fell out of a tree and landed on you. I 
ended up somewhere between shawl and bib.

The problem is obvious from the name: I don’t want to have to walk around 
clutching something all day. I want both hands free – that’s why I have 
pockets. If my pockets fill up, I have also got a rucksack. I suppose I could 
keep my clutch bag in there.

You see a lot of men outside fashion shows wearing sunglasses and looking at 
their phones. When I wear sunglasses in winter, I can’t even see my phone. Are 
there special lenses for this?

I understand that wearing brogues without socks is trendy – even, it seems, in 
winter – but to me it looks wrong and feels worse. I think you are meant to put 
on little socklets first, but I don’t own any, so I went commando. The trend 
seems to be to combine this look with rolled trousers, in order to show off as 
much ankle as possible. Perhaps there’s a general feeling that men’s ankles get 
better as they go up. Mine are a ghostly white, and still bear indentations 
from the socks I was wearing all morning. There’s no way I’m going outside like 
this in February. People will think I don’t own any socks.
