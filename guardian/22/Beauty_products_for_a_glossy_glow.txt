On the catwalk this season models worked a look that one designer described as 
“beautiful sweat” – super-glossed bodies that looked like they’d just left the 
gym. Easy to pull off on public transport in a heatwave, sure; but actually 
quite glamorous if done with more decorum for night-time, alongside fresh hair 
and a non-drenched dress. Use an all-over dry oil or radiance balm for skin 
that gleams.
