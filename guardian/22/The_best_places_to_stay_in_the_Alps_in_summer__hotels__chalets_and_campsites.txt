Camping Seiser Alm, Fiè allo Scillar, Dolomites

It seems ridiculous to comment on the beauty of the washrooms when you've got 
a spacious, grassy pitch at the foot of the Seiser Alm in the Dolomites, 
surrounded by gorgeous Alpine scenery with a cool bathing lake a mere bellyflop 
away. But if you ever find another mountain campsite where you can request a 
private bathroom that looks like something out of an Austrian spa, I'll eat my 
tent flaps. They also have apartments and caravans to rent for those needing 
more creature comforts than canvas allows.

Chalet Val Ferret, Aosta valley
 Chalet Val Ferret, Aosta valley 
Come out of the Mont Blanc tunnel to Courmayeur and hang a swift left, moving 
up through Val Ferret, a bucolic broad curve in the land that feels an age away 
from the closely packed and jagged peaks of the Mont Blanc massif. There is 
hiking, rock climbing, sitting by the river and picnicking to be done. If you 
feel like spending the night, the charming Chalet Val Ferret sits almost where 
the road ends (Val Ferret is a dead end.) Closed in winter, in summer it offers 
accommodation, a restaurant and picnic tables with the most peaceful Alpine 
view imaginable.

Rifugio Torre di Pisa, Predazzo, Trentino
 Rifugio Torre di Pisa, Predazzo, Trentino 
At 2,671 metres high, it's not the easiest walk in, but the views really are 
worth the trek and with the aid of chairlifts you can cut the bulk of the 
schlep down to about two hours. The hut sits on top of the Cavignon peak with 
complete 360- degree vistas across the Dolomites. Don't expect luxury – beds 
are dorms and bathrooms communal and mountain climbers tend to smell quite 
earthy after a few days up high. But the food is homely and satisfying and if 
you fancy a taste of mountain life without the commitment of a long trek, it's 
a good place to start.

Maison Perriere, Saint Vincent, Aosta Valley
 Maison Perriere, Saint Vincent, Aosta Valley 
The location of this attractive stone house, not very close to anywhere in 
particular (the nearest town is Saint Vincent which isn't necessarily the first 
place you think of staying in the Aosta Valley), means you get peace, beauty 
and that clear stillness that only the mountains can provide. There's a lovely 
garden with a vegetable patch and wild flowers, so if you don't feel like 
exploring the villages, castles and churches of Aosta or hiking the valley 
itself, you really don't need to move to feel refreshed.

B&B da Mariangela, Avio, Trentino
 B&B da Mariangela, Avio, Trentino 
It's a bit of a stretch but Avio – 30 minutes from the northern tip of Lake 
Garda – can still just about be classified as the Alps if you're looking for 
their softer side. This B&B is run by Mariangela and Carlo, who renovated an 
old mill – building a lot of the furniture and fittings themselves – and 
attempt to live as in as eco-friendly a way as possible, reducing light 
pollution at night and composting with fervour. There is a creek for fishing 
and they can supply bikes for cycling along the Adige river – a lot more 
accessible than most cycling in the Alps. Views from some of the rooms are over 
the Val d'Adige and at breakfast you feast on homemade cakes and local produce.

Gîte Lou Finon, Les Contamines-Montjoie
 Gite Lou Finon, Les Contamines-Montjoie 
This simple little self-catering gîte sleeping eight has no bells and whistles 
but sits right in the heart of the Réserve Naturelle des Contamines Montjoie 
and almost at the end of the road, which means little through traffic and 
immense hiking options. The only folks you will see are the ones using the 
nearbyPontet Leisure Park 
<http://en.lescontamines.com/pontet-leisure-park-1-1.html>, which features 
pretty much every outdoor activity you can think of – lake for swimming and 
boating, rock climbing, archery, zip wires, tree climbing and tennis. Les 
Contamines itself is a pretty little town bedecked in flowers in summer, with a 
couple of good pizzerias. If you've youngsters to entertain, Gîte Lou Finon, 
with its outdoor picnic table and spacious garden, is perfect.

Le Ferme d'Angèle, Séez
 Le Ferme d'Angele, Seez 
Close enough to Bourg St Maurice to be convenient but far enough away to feel 
like somewhere the madding crowd have yet to colonise, La Ferme d'Angèle is a 
delightful 19th-century Savoyarde farmhouse that oozes mountain charm. Lots of 
stone (and a joyous lack of varnished pine) and balconies dripping with 
flowers. It is close to the col du Petit San Bernard, which means road cyclists 
can drop into Italy for coffee and make it back in time for atartiflette 
dinner. This being the Alps, you've of course got everything from rafting and 
hiking close by as well. Rooms are atmospheric, with a separate one-bedmazot 
(converted outbuilding) for those wanting more privacy. Breakfast outside in 
the sun is not to be missed.

La Maison du Guil, Eygliers
 La Maison du Guil, Eygliers 
This design-led B&B is in a 16th-century farmhouse surrounded by the Écrins 
massif. The guest rooms are stunning, with vaulted stone walls that open on to 
a shaded patio. If you fancy a challenge, cols of the Tour de France on your 
doorstep include the Galibier and Izoard and mountain bikers will be in their 
element here. The B&B can also match you up with rafting and paragliding 
guides. Dinners using local produce are also available.

Camping La Ravoire, Annecy
 Camping La Ravoire, Annecy 
The brilliant thing about camping in Annecy is that you're surrounded by epic 
mountains but you don't have to hike or camp on any of them – the area around 
the lake is perfectly flat for pitching a tent or walking without thigh burn. 
The Annecy to Albertville cycle path runs behind the campsite, so you can 
pootle off whenever you want and the nearest beach is just a kilometre away. 
It's not a large site and there are lots of trees for shade, a heated swimming 
pool and a small bar selling lasagne, pizza and the like. If you want to sample 
the Alps away from the hordes it's a lovely little spot to go as hard or as 
easy as you like.

L'Ancienne Ecole du Molliet, Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval, Grand Massif
 L'Ancienne Ecole du Molliet, Sixt-Fer-a-Cheval, Grand Massif 
Sixt-Fer-a-Cheval is gorgeous - it sits in a horseshoe of mountains, so you 
spend your days basically in a stunning Alpine crater. There's the dramatic 
Cascade du Rouget for the feeling of glacial mist on your face, some incredibly 
technical rock climbing, and 600km of trails for all levels of hiker and biker. 
The village even has a microbrewery. L'Ancienne Ecole du Molliet is just that – 
an old village schoolhouse that has been converted into a self-catering chalet 
sleeping eight. It's full of atmosphere – big beams, good lighting, lots of 
granite, wooden floors and a sense of history. There's a garden and a barbecue 
at your disposal too.

SWITZERLAND

Camping Petit Praz, Arolla
 Camping Petit Praz, Arolla 
If you've driven here from the UK you probably feel like a bag of rats anyway 
and then you have to pitch your tent, unload, sort yourself out. But then you 
look up and catch your breath – boom! Instant uplift. Not only are you standing 
in Europe's highest campsite (1,950m) so laboured breathing may well be a 
physical reality but the tiered levels are backed by toppling glaciers, 
sweeping peaks and that icy bareness only the high Alps can provide. The grassy 
site is perfect for hardy types who like to camp without too many comforts, but 
not to the extent that forgetting the milk means a two-hour walk out.

Hotel Staz, St Moritz
 Hotel Staz, St Moritz 
Perched on the edge of Lake Staz, this petite billet has cosy quarters and a 
tranquil setting, with wide views of fields, woods and lakes just perfect for 
swimming. It's only accessible by foot or horse-drawn carriage (order one from 
the church square in St Moritz) and has the air of a gracefully ageing hunting 
lodge. Bubbly St Moritz is not far away if you fancy some human interaction, 
but it might come as something of a culture shock.

Ollie and Maria's B&B, Gimmelwald
 Ollie and Maria's bed and breakfast, Gimmelwald 
Hanging on vertiginous slopes overlooking the Lauterbrunnen valley in the 
Bernese Oberland, Gimmelwald is a car-free village with, arguably, the most 
spectacular terrain of the Swiss Alps on its doorstep. There are no shops, 
hardly any tourists – just cows, hikers and cheese.The Mountain Hostel 
<http://www.mountainhostel.com/> is the most famous place for meeting fellow 
mountain lovers but Ollie and Maria's B&B offers a lovely pine-drenched stay if 
sharing bunk beds isn't your style. You can catch a cable car up the 
Schillthorn peak to get closer to the heavens or you can use one to get you to 
Murren if you're seeking more distraction than the gentle sound of cows 
munching Alpine grass.

Rapperswil Monastery, Rapperswil
 Rapperswil Monastery, Rapperswil 
The Alps aren't all about loftiness and drama; if you feel like taking your 
gaze inward for a bit, this is your place – a Capuchin monastery that welcomes 
guests of all religions, Rapperswil was established in the early 17th century 
and offers a complete break from modern life. While staying here you are 
assigned a brother or sister to guide you through your days and are expected to 
share in the spiritual exercises and meditations and to engage in the rhythm of 
the monastic community. The environment lends itself to contemplation, with the 
old building resting on the soft shores of the Obersee.

Sleeping in a cave always sounds like an adventure but it can be kind of 
freaky. But sleeping in a chocolate box Swiss house in a cave is another 
matter, especially when that house is a very long way up. Access to Aescher is 
via the cable car from Wasserauen, and from the drop-off it's a 15 minute 
ramble through the caves to your accommodation, with sweeping views across the 
Appenzell landscape. You don't have to stay the night, but it's worth it for 
breakfast on the terrace followed by a hike back down. Accommodation is 
dormitory- style with the odd three-bunk room.

AUSTRIA

Camping Anderwald, Lake Faaker 
 Camping Anderwald, Lake Faaker See 
Only 5km from Slovenia, Camping Anderwald is absolutely brilliant. The site, 
on the shore of pristine Faaker See, is covered in trees and surrounded by the 
Karawanks mountains. It's also on theAlpe Adria hiking trail 
<http://www.alpe-adria-trail.com/en/>, which runs from Austria via Slovenia to 
Italy in 43 stages. But if you want to stop off longer than just to soak your 
feet in the lake, this is a great spot for an extended pit stop. The campsite 
has its own mountain school offering mountain biking, via ferrata, climbing, 
hiking, canoeing and even courses on alfresco camp cooking.

Ufogel, Nussdorf
 Ufogel, Nussdorf 
Talk about a room with a view! Ufogel resembles a giant barrel with one whole 
side made of glass so you can lie on the cushions ("sofa" is stretching it a 
bit) and feel like you're floating as you gaze out across Alpine meadows. It's 
a bit like staying in a giant sculpture, with the pervasive smell of larch wood 
and uninterrupted views keeping you at one with nature. It's cosily appointed 
with everything you need to act out your sci-fi isolationist fantasies: shower, 
stove and even a TV. It's such a novel living space that it's hard to step 
outside, but you've got the medieval town of Lienz nearby, and lots of 
mountains to yodel on. This is Tyrol after all.

Zugspitz resort, Obermoos
 Zugspitz resort, Obermoos 
This is family camping but not as you know it. At the base of the Zugspitz 
mountain in Tyrol lies a sprawling campsite that caters for every possible 
family whim – it's like camping Disneyland but without the forced glee. Bathing 
ponds, swimming pools, go-karting, massages, climbing, kid's club, cycling and 
wellbeing packages for tired adults. If you're looking for a way of easing your 
kids into both camping (nice shower blocks) and the Alps (you don't have to 
walk uphill every day) there's a tent pitch here with your name on it. If you 
feel like easing them in even more softly, there are apartments or even a 
hotel. But that's cheating.

Pure Life chalets, Graz
 Pure Life chalets, Graz 
Vineyards? In the Alps? Well, yes. The Styria region just 30 minutes south of 
Graz is an area of beautiful tiered vineyards and orchards, crisscrossing hills 
and wide horizons. Pure Life owns a series of chalets and houses made mainly 
from wood and glass, with verandas suspended over the terrain. You have the 
option to go very posh with a pool, sauna and a private chef, or you can stay 
slightly simpler, venturing out for prearranged picnics by Vespa or wine 
tasting afternoons. You won't see snow-capped peaks here but clean air and 
rejuvenation are pretty much guaranteed.
