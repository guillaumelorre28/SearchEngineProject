More than 70 inmates have been teargassed during a riot in the 
maximum-security wing of Bathurst prison, 200km west of Sydney.

A spokeswoman from Corrective Services New South Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> said the riot had 
broken out after a fight between two inmates and prison guards in the cell 
block that led to the guard requiring medical treatment for head injuries.

It had begun about 1.30pm on Tuesday, she said, when an inmate “became 
argumentative with staff” and refused to leave the unit. While guards were 
restraining that inmate, another inmate stepped in and allegedly hit one of the 
guards repeatedly on the head.

“As the officer was being taken to the clinic for treatment, inmates in the 
yards became unsettled and began calling out abuse,” Corrective Services NSW 
said. “Inmates were secured in their cells, but a number of inmates in two 
yards refused to comply and chemical munitions had to be deployed.”

Prison guards in riot gear, known as the immediate action team, were called in 
before the riot broke out. Later police, the fire department and paramedics 
were also called.

The spokeswoman said the suspected ringleaders of the riot were being held in 
segregation.

The injured police officer was offered counselling. The Corrective Services 
commissioner, Peter Severin, praised guards for their “effective and judicious 
handling of the incident” and said it would be subject to an internal 
investigation.

It comes just a few hours after a 77-year-old inmate at Sydney’s Long Bay 
Jail, also operated by Corrective Services NSW, wascharged with murdering his 
71-year-old cellmate
