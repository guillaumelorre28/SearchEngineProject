Dessert dreams, Lisbon


During the festive season the Portuguese capital overdoses on cakes, desserts, 
fried pastries etc, with people queuing to buy them inpastelarias (bakeries). 
My favourite aresonhos (dreams) – light, deep-fried doughnuts, sprinkled with 
sugar and cinnamon. They can be made with flour and eggs, or with flour and 
mashed boiled pumpkin. There are good ones atPastelaria Versailles 
<https://www.facebook.com/Pastelaria-Versailles-125661190814840/>, a beautiful, 
art nouveau cafe dating back to 1922. Still,bolo rei (king cake) is probably 
the most popular treat and you’ll see it everywhere. The old cafeConfeitaria 
Nacional <http://www.confeitarianacional.com/pt/#index.html> (near Rossio 
square) introduced this French cake to Lisbon in the 19th century, and now it’s 
baked all over the country. It’s dry, with soft dough, and is not too sweet, 
with nuts and candied fruits.Bolo-rainha is the same but without the candied 
fruits. Whoever finds the dry broad bean hidden inside has to buy the next bolo 
rei.

Biscuits in Brussels

The scent of spicy, baked biscuits marks the start of the festive season in 
the Low Countries. Speculoos, a crunchy biscuit made with brown sugar and 
cinnamon, is eaten all year round and known worldwide through the miniature 
version served with cups of coffee. But the biscuit was originally associated 
with Saint Nicholas Day, celebrated in early December. Traditionally, children 
would leave their shoes by the chimney with carrots for Saint Nicholas’s horse 
and in the morning find biscuits in their place. Although the Flanders towns of 
Ghent and Bruges are strong on cookies, Brussels has claimed speculoos as its 
own. During December, Brussels bakers make one-foot-long speculoo Christmas 
trees, set in traditional wooden moulds. Best known of the cookie makers is
Maison Dandoy <https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/www.maisondandoy.com> on 
the aptly-named Rue au Beurre.

Fish dishes and sweet bread, Prague

On the days leading up to Christmas a curious site can be seen (and smelled) 
on the streets of Prague. Throughout the city, fish farmers dressed in full 
garb sell live carp from huge water-filled tanks. With the original recipe 
attributed to Magdalena Dobromila Rettigova, called the mother of Czech 
cuisine, fried carp served with potato salad has been the traditional Christmas 
meal served in Czech households since at the least the 19th century. While some 
have the fish vendors butcher the carp on the spot, the more entertaining 
tradition is taking the carp home live and letting it swim around in the 
bathtub until it’s time to prepare the meal, served on Christmas Eve. To try 
this traditional dish head toPilsen Restaurant 
<http://www.plzenskarestaurace.cz/en/?cal=4> in the Municipal House or Aureole 
<http://www.aureole.cz/vanoce_2016/> (both offer special Christmas menus). And 
don’t forget to save a scale, dry it and put it in your wallet for the year as 
doing so is said to bring good fortune.

In sweet contrast, Vanocka is a delicious sweet bread that is traditionally 
served on the morning of Christmas Day. Similar to a braided brioche or Jewish 
Challa, this yummy yeast-based loaf, dating back to the 16th-century and taking 
its name from the Czech word for Christmas (Vanoce), includes raisons, almonds 
and lemon zest and in some recipes includes anise or nutmeg and is topped with 
powdered sugar. Two good spots to try Vanocka areEska <http://eska.ambi.cz/en/>
, a restaurant and bakery hybrid, andAntoninovo Pekarstvi 
<http://www.antoninovopekarstvi.cz/>, a neighbourhood bakery with two 
locations. Slice and top with butter or honey, or just enjoy this tasty Czech 
Christmas loaf plain.

Perfect pancakes, Berlin

 Photograph: Global_Pics/Getty Images 
Spending New Year’s Eve in Berlin will allow you to debunk one of the most 
enduring myths about the German capital via a culinary tradition: in June 1963, 
US president John F Kennedy made a fool of himself saying “Ich bin ein 
Berliner”, which in German means “I am a doughnut”. In fact, the proper German 
term for a doughnut with a jam filling is a Berliner pfannkuchen or “Berlin 
pancake”. In most parts of the country people refer to it as a Berliner – but 
in Berlin itself people call it a pfannkuchen. Even though most bakeries sell 
Berliner pancakes all year around, they are particularly associated with New 
Year’s Eve parties, and tradition demands that for every eight doughnuts filled 
with jam, you slip in one filled with mustard (senf) to play a trick on an 
unlucky guest. Enjoy, and cut JFK some slack.

Soviet-style salad, Moscow

 Photograph: Getty Images 
The olivier salad, a dish rich in mayonnaise, simply can’t be avoided if you 
want to fully experience winter festivities Russian-style. Also known as 
Russian or Stolichniy salad, it’s democratic, hailing from Soviet times when 
fancy food was not easy to procure: it’s just potatoes, vegetables, ham, eggs 
and mayonnaise. Even the characters in the ultimate Russian new year film, the 
Irony of Fate romantic comedy, eat it. To get the most affordable version of 
the salad go toTeremok <http://teremok.ru/>, a chain of Russian style fast food 
cafes, where olivier is served deconstructed for you to mix up yourself.
Varnichnaya <http://varenichnaya.ru/>, a chain of dumpling cafes, offers a 
chicken olivier in all of its branches. Or, if you’re willing to splash out, go 
toMari Vanna <http://www.marivanna.ru/>, where prices for ham olivier start at 
RUB470 (£6).

Creamy rice pudding, Copenhagen

 Photograph: Alamy 
You can’t spend Christmas in Denmark without being served the nation’s 
favourite Christmas pudding,risalamande – a cold rice pudding with whipped 
cream and chopped almonds served with a hot cherry sauce. Originally rice 
pudding was the traditional Christmas dessert, but as the price of rice rose 
sharply during the second world war, the cream and almonds were added to make 
it last. Danes celebrate Christmas on the evening of 24 December when the 
pudding is served in a large bowl, and a whole almond is added. Whoever gets 
the almond gets the “almond present”. This has been known to cause great 
disputes as some people – mainly uncles and grandpas – hide the almond in their 
hand or in their cheek, thus leaving members of their family not only in great 
suspense, but with aching bellies from eating way too much of the rich and 
filling dessert. If you are not celebrating Christmas in a Danish home, you can 
get risalamande at many restaurants in Copenhagen. A local favourite is
Schønnemann’s <http://www.restaurantschonnemann.dk/>, in the city centre where 
you get some of the city’s best smørrebrød. Be sure to have the pickled herring 
and the schnapps too.

Getting piggy with it, Bucharest

In the Romanian countryside the tradition is to slaughter a pig at Christmas, 
and while this practice is long gone in big cities such as Bucharest, pork 
dishes remain ubiquitous throughout the holiday period – along with copious 
amounts ofțuică (fruit brandy). Sarmale (minced meat, rice and onions wrapped 
in cabbage leaves) is available year-round but has a prominent place on the 
Christmas table, while dishes such aspiftie (pork and garlic in gelatine), 
șorici (salted pork rinds) and jumări (chunks of pork fat, fried) feature 
heavily. For those visiting Bucharest over Christmas and looking to try some of 
these meaty treats, traditional restaurants likeCaru’ cu bere 
<https://www.carucubere.ro/en/>, a 19th-century beer hall in the heart of the 
city,Hanu’ lui Manuc <https://hanulluimanuc.ro/en/>, a centuries-old traders 
inn, andCurtea Berarilor <http://curteaberarilor.com/> have a full menu of 
classic Romanian dishes, with platters of the above featured prominently.

Seasonal smörgåsbords, Stockholm
 Photograph: Alamy 
Every December large groups of people vie for spots at seasonal buffets called 
julbord (Christmas table). This is built up from base items – pickled herring, 
cured salmon and meatballs – regular staples in smörgåsbords. But as Christmas 
is the mother of all seasonal buffets, julbord draws on 19th-century Swedish 
soul food traditions with specific dishes, such as Jansson’s Temptation 
(potato-anchovy casserole),dopp i grytan (bread dipped in pork broth), lutfisk 
(gelatinous white fish dish),risgrynsgröt (rice porridge), and julskinka 
(Christmas ham); all washed down with a non-alcoholic sweet root beer-like 
beverage,julmust. Restaurants are often fully booked to celebrate this official 
end of the working season, but for an atmospheric julbord experience, hop aboard
Strömma’s steamboats <http://www.stromma.se/en/stockholm/dining-cruises/> for 
SEK 595 (£51) as you sail around Stockholm’s archipelago.

Game on, Paris 
 Art-nouveau brasserie, Julien. Photograph: Alamy 
The French Christmas meal - traditionally known as Le Reveillon – is 
celebrated on the evening of 24 December – and involves the politically 
incorrect, and banned in some countries, foie gras, as well as oysters, smoked 
salmon, turkey or capon and a chocolate cake known as abuche with, depending on 
the budget, champagne or sparkling wine. Much of this is actually quite new. 
Traditionally, Catholic families ate their Christmas meal on returning from 
midnight mass, which in those days started at midnight. Back thenChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> dishes depended on the 
region: oysters in the west, foie gras in Alsace and the south-west, pork in 
rural areas.

The Christmas buche or log cake is a tradition apart. It used to be that a log 
was put on the fire to keep it going through the evening until the family 
returned from mass. In recent times, with fewer chimneys, the log has been 
replaced by a chocolate cake desert, these days more often than not 
industrially produced and filled with ice-cream. A three-course Christmas menu 
with starters, including foie gras and/or snails and a glass of champagne costs 
€69 atJulien <http://www.julienparis.com/en/>, part of the fabulously decorated 
art-nouveau chain that includes Bofinger, La Coupole, Flo and the Terminus Nord 
(by the Gare du Nord). It’s in the previously unfashionable, but increasingly 
trendy 10th arrondissement.

Sugar and shortbread overload, Madrid
 Casa Mira, Madrid 
Shellfish, bream, lamb, and turkey may be festive staples in Spain but nothing 
says Christmas quite so cloyingly as the plethora of sugary treats that weigh 
down tables and stomachs at the end of December. Spanish nougat (turrón) can be 
hard or soft but its appeals seldom wanes. Similarly popular arepolvorones 
(shortbread, the name of which hints at the dusty debris into which they 
crumble) andmantecados (like polvorones but enriched with lard). Among Madrid’s 
oldest and best known confectioners areCasa Mira <http://www.casamira.es/>, La 
Antigua Pastelería del Pozo <https://www.facebook.com/antiguapasteleriadelpozo/>
 andEl Riojano <http://www.confiteriaelriojano.com/>, all of which have been 
serving the sweet-toothed of the city since the 19th century. Take an appetite 
and expectations of a serious sugar rush.
