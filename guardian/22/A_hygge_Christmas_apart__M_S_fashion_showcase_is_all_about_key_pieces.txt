Technically, the Marks & Spencer fashion showcase is a reveal of hemlines and 
heel heights, but within two minutes of arriving at the new season preview I am 
talking feelings with the retailer’sCEO, Steve Rowe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/13/m-and-s-marks-spencers-must-sell-clothes-like-it-sells-food>
.

The store’s latest advert stars a Hillary Clinton-esque Mrs Claus 
<http://www.marksandspencer.com/c/christmas/christmas-tv-advert> saving the 
(Christmas) day in on-trend hygge knitwear, and includes the most feelgood 
helicopter moment sinceJames Bond and the Queen flew into the Olympic stadium 
for the opening ceremony of London 2012 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW5abat5NEU>. 

The advert is a poignant, Sliding Doors vision of the feminist happy ending 
that 2016 appeared destined to have but didn’t, and Rowe keeps hearing from 
people who say it made them cry, which we agree is a very good sign. (Rowe, 
ever mindful of the bottom line, is even more cheered by the fact that the red, 
sequinned trainers that feature in the ad have done storming business since the 
advert dropped.)

Emotion is never far from the surface at a store which is part of the British 
national conversation in ways that are about more than its £10bn annual 
revenue. The public does not care about many FTSE 100 companies in this 
fashion. So the recent news thatit will close 30 stores and convert 45 to being 
food only 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/m-and-s-marks-spencer-close-80-stores-major-overhaul>
 was keenly felt by many observers, who interpreted a switch of focus from 
clothing (first bras, school uniform, affordable cashmere) into the passionless 
territory of prawn sandwiches and chicken kiev as a sign of an M&S beating a 
cultural retreat.

, the leadership team of the fashion business, issued a flat denial that their 
part of the company was being squeezed. They argue that forfeit of floor space 
reflects how customers now shop – 17% of M&S fashion sales are made online, and 
this is rising – and a commitment across the business to streamlining, so that 
there is one great pair of velvet trousers on sale rather than three. 
(Footnote: straight after the meeting, I ordered a pair of theAutograph wide 
leg velvet trousers, £59, which two of the team were wearing

.) “We remain completely committed to clothing, but we need to make space work 
harder,” Jenkins said.


Note the buzzwords and phrases most often repeated by the team on our tour of 
the showroom: “edit”, “focus”, and “key details”. Instead of being home to 20 
variations on the twinset, the new M&S aims to have a tighter collection of 
more eye-catching pieces.

Case in point: the new season is strong on simple blouses with interesting 
sleeve shapes, a feature adopted from catwalk and street style for the M&S 
customer. “She wants that detail that gives her a reason to buy, but she 
doesn’t want overcomplicated clothes – a simple body with something happening 
on the sleeve is flattering and easy to wear,” said Jenkins.

 M&S collection dress, £35. Photograph: Mark & Spencer 
A crisp blue-and-white striped blouse with buttons at the shoulder and fluted 
sleeves echoes the cult fashion brandEllery 
<http://www.matchesfashion.com/womens/designers/ellery>, but for less than £30, 
while a £65 Autograph hot pink, fashionably loose dress with bell sleeves and 
back cutout is very Victoria-Beckham-at-JFK (that’s a good thing these days, if 
you haven’t been paying attention). Prints have been given a much-needed 
overhaul: a graphic print that nods to Hokusai’s images of Mount Fuji makes for 
an excellent £35 silk dress.

 Cutwork boots, £35. Photograph: Mark &Spencer 
While most of the collection goes on sale in early 2017, the See Now Buy Now 
capsule collection introduced for the first time this year continues with an 
accessory edit that channels next season’s trends but goes on sale immediately. 
(The £35 cutwork boots, comfortable partywear with the patented technology that 
M&S have devised to rebalance the foot and make heel-wearing comfortable, are a 
standout, as are the £45 ankle-tied ballet slippers.) That this puts 
accessories in the spotlight at a crucial juncture for M&S reflects the way the 
fashion business is shifting, away from blanket-coverage basics and towards key 
pieces. My hot tip for next season’s pink coat? A pair of pearl-studded black 
high-heeled sandals.
