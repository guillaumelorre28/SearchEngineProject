Denmark’s Magnus Cort Nielsen edged his way to victory in stage 18 of the 
Vuelta a España <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/vuelta-a-espana> on 
Thursday, leading out the sprint in the final 500 metres of the 200.6km race 
and taking the stage win in his first appearance in a grand tour.

The peloton kept close to the breakaway group in the second longest stage of 
the Tour, from Requena to Gandia, so the leader, Nairo Quintana,maintained his 
3:37 lead over nearest challenger Chris Froome

 before Friday’s individual time trial.

Friday’s 37km time trial represents Froome’s best chance of making up time on 
favourite Quintana, although his hopes of wresting the red jersey from the 
Colombian have diminished since he finished 2:37 behind him in stage 15.

The 23-year-old Nielsen held off attempted surges from German Nikias Arndt and 
Frenchman Jean-Pierre Drucker to edge over the finish line for his Orica 
BikeExchange team.

“It’s a really big dream come true, its fantastic,” Nielsen said. “Our main 
goal is to have our eyes on our general classification guys but every now and 
then we try [to win a stage] and it was fantastic. I gave it a go and it was 
amazing.

“It’s my first grand tour ever, so three wins and our guys are high up in the 
GC, so its a nice team to be in.“

The Tour finishes on Sunday in Madrid.
