We have read about the German government banning Berliners from renting out 
whole apartments and wonder if that applies retrospectively?

In January we booked and paid for a week in a flat later on this year. We have 
tried – unsuccessfully – to contactAirbnb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/airbnb> to ask if our booking is still 
confirmed.

We have had no reply to texts either from our host or Airbnb, and our emails 
have bounced back.

When Airbnb rentals turn into nuisance neighbours

It is frustrating trying to contact Airbnb; there does not seem to be anyone 
you can phone at the organisation.AS, Abingdon, Oxfordshire 

The new rules, introduced on 1 March to prevent short-term holiday lets 
compromising the long-term rental market, mean Berliners can be fined up to 
€100,000 (£85,000) if they let more than half of their apartment through Airbnb 
without a permit.

From now on foreign nationals can only rent rooms via the website. The 
restriction was brought in to address a chronic housing shortage in the city 
and was upheld by a court ruling in June.

Happily for you, Airbnb assures me that your holiday is safe and the host has 
now contacted you to assure you that he has the relevant permit for your stay.
