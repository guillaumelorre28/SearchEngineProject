With so many worthy causes in the world, deciding how to help make a 
difference can be bewildering. The best thing about social enterprises is they 
make it easy to do good, daily.

The model of social enterprise is built on sustainability: enterprises 
providing goods and services at a profit, while delivering human or 
environmental benefit at the same time.

Tom Dawkins, co-founder of crowdfunding platform StartSomeGood, 
<https://startsomegood.com/> describes a successful social enterprise as being 
“able to access capital and use commerce to scale their impact,” while also 
having “a financially-sustainable business model that delivers social impact” 
so they don’t have to compromise on their mission.

Naturally, we want these amazing enterprises to succeed, but how do we invest 
in them, support them? What small, daily steps can we take, as individuals and 
as businesses? 


What individuals can do (and that means you)

1. Buy their products and services

It’s pretty obvious: social enterprises can’t do their good work if they’re 
not on your shopping list. Jackie Ruddock ofThe Social Outfit 
<http://thesocialoutfit.org/> says, “We’re actually quite a tiny organisation, 
so the way our dreams will come true is if people buy our products.” Ruddock’s 
dream is to provide training and employment opportunities for refugees and new 
migrants.

Some social enterprise products can be purchased in retail stores such as One 
Night Stand <http://onenightstandsleepwear.com.au/> sleepwear in General Pants, 
Thankyou <https://thankyou.co/> in supermarkets and The Social Outfit in their 
Sydney shopfront.

 Many can be purchased online, including Words with Heart 
<http://wordswithheart.com/> stationery, fair-trade produce from Eat Me Chutneys
 <http://www.eatmechutneys.com.au/>, Australian native teas and condiments from 
Warndu <http://www.warndu.com> and coffee from Darcy St Project 
<http://www.darcystproject.com.au/>.

2. Pledge your support

You can support social enterprises financially through crowdfunding engines. 
Tom Dawkins cites theING DIRECT Dreamstarter 
<https://www.campaigns.ingdirect.com.au/dreamstarter> initiative as one way the 
community can get behind inspiring social entrepreneurs.

Every year, Dreamstarter helps 16 to 20 social enterprise businesses secure 
funding and awareness so they can thrive and make a positive difference in 
their community.

Dawkins encourages us all to get involved, “What’s great about crowdfunding is 
you’re raising funds from the community that will support your growth. If 
you’re a social enterprise you don’t just need money, you need customers, early 
adopters and advocates”.

Crowdfunding can help social enterprises raise all this simultaneously, 
setting them up “to succeed much more than funding alone in the form of a grant 
ever could.”

StartSomeGood’s crowdfunding platform acts as a springboard for hundreds of 
social and environmental projects every year and now powers ING DIRECT’s 
Dreamstarter.

Research has shown customers are really keen on supporting these projects 
through buying goods and services.

“A lot of consumers are looking to align their consumption with their values,” 
Dawkins says.

“Crowdfunding is uniquely good at incentivising people to give, with its 
dynamic built around deadlines, set timeframes and set outcomes.”

 The next round of ING DIRECT Dreamstarter campaigns has just launched with 
six social enterprises looking for crowdfunding support to get their ventures 
off the ground.

“By partnering with the community through crowdfunding, ING DIRECT is able to 
focus its investment around the most innovative projects with the greatest 
capacity to succeed,” says Dawkins.

3. Spread the word

Jackie Ruddock says one of the best things customers can do for her enterprise 
is to become ambassadors and share The Social Outfit’s story. “There are a 
whole lot of Australians out there who don’t yet know that we are a brand,” she 
says.

Social media is the perfect tool for brand ambassadors. Crowdfunding, with its 
intrinsic ties into social media, inspires people not just to give but also to 
advocate through their networks.

“Sharing is how things most effectively spread in today’s world,” says Dawkins.

4. Volunteer

There are lots of ways to give your time and skills to social enterprises, 
depending on where your talents lie.


Many organisations offer programs or opportunities for you to volunteer. Some 
have charity-linked partners you can speak to as well, for exampleOne Night 
Stand <http://onenightstandsleepwear.com.au/> partners with OzHarvest 
<http://ozharvest.org/>.

At The Bread & Butter Project <http://thebreadandbutterproject.com/> they’re 
always on the lookout for English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers to 
volunteer as tutors for their refugee and migrant trainees.

“All of our trainees have personal language tutors who are volunteers. We’re 
always looking for ESL teachers who might want to volunteer their time,” says 
co-founder of The Bread & Butter Project, Jessica Grynberg.

“Many organisations have volunteering programs,” says Michele Goldman, “or 
people could talk to organisations like School for Social Entrepreneurs to 
identify enterprises that are operating in the area they’re passionate about.”

How businesses can support social enterprise

1. Offer expertise through an intermediary

Businesses have much to offer the social enterprise world, whether it’s 
through mentoring, participating in training programs, or having their staff 
sitting on the boards of social enterprises.

However, if you’re a business that wants to offer skills or expertise to a 
social enterprise, it’s not always easy to approach them and say, “I want to 
work with you”.

Mark Daniels, head of market and sector development at social enterprise 
development organisationSocial Traders <http://www.socialtraders.com.au/> says, 
“It’s not a homogenous community that you can just tap into”.

If you’re a social enterprise you don’t just need money, you need customers, 
early adopters and advocates”
Tom Dawkins, co-founder of crowdfunding platform StartSomeGood 
Often a business will choose to work through intermediary organisations like 
Social Traders that have the experience – and their own databases of social 
enterprises – to draw from.

“There’s no question that business has a lot to offer the social enterprise 
world. There are great examples of pro bono and low bono services, mentoring 
and board membership on these organisations,” Daniels says.

2. Help publicise social enterprises

Businesses should consider using their marketing, PR and other communications 
networks to shine a light on for-purpose businesses.

ING DIRECT Sustainability Manager Shannon Carruth says, “Research has shown 
customers are really keen on supporting these projects through buying goods and 
services.

“Dreamstarter can be like a dating agency in that way, introducing people who 
aren’t aware of these particular social enterprises to what’s out there,” she 
says.


Tom Dawkins sees this as an emerging trend, “We are starting to see more and 
more interest from corporates in supporting social enterprises and even 
incorporating social enterprise approaches into their business. Corporate 
partners can offer expertise and reach emerging social enterprises lack.”

3. Become a corporate customer

Social procurement is the most sustainable way to create change, says Carruth. 
In simplest terms it means businesses buying from social enterprises.

She cites the example of a recent ING DIRECT team-building day, where they 
engaged a social enterprise – Darcy St Project’s barista training program – to 
set up a pop-up coffee stand at the venue. They also sourced afternoon tea from 
The Bread and Butter Project and Eat Me Chutneys.

How to find social enterprises

a brand stocked at your local supermarket or café (get used to reading 
packaging).
