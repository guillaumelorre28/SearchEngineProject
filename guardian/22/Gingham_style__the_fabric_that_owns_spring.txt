We all know what wearing leopard print means. It means you are sexy and 
womanly and abit daring but very much within socially acceptable boundaries. It 
means being rock’n’roll up to, but not beyond, the 
two-martinis-on-a-schoolnight watermark. You put on your leopard-print pencil 
skirt and you’re, like, mentally high-fiving Diane von Fürstenberg as you leave 
for the office.

 Gigi Hadid for Guess Jeans 
But what does gingham mean? This is a matter of some urgency, because gingham 
is owning spring 2016. Gigi Hadid wears a red-and-white ginghamhigh waisted 
bikini 
<http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/13422014/gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-italy-vacation/#3>
in American Vogue this month, and wore a black-and-white gingham one-piece 
swimsuit on her birthday. Poppy Delevingne has designed a black-and-white 
gingham sundress for cult label Solid and Striped. Prince George’s pyjamas – 
which, lets face it, have been this season’s top-scoring outfit so far – were 
blue gingham, while his mum wore a gingham dress bybespoke London label Eponine 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/03/kate-middleton-eponine-checkered-gingham-dress>
 last month. Days later, President Obama wore a gingham shirt for the White 
House Easter egg roll. Caitlyn Jenner has been wearing a gingham shirt with 
denim cut-offs; on the J Crew site this month, creative director Jenna Lyons 
has posted a “gingham diary” with five different looks. (Our favourite:

Gingham is wholesomeness. It is family-album seaside holiday snaps, school 
uniforms, homestyle bistro tablecloths. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy’s gingham 
dress embodies the message of the film: there’s no place like home. I blame 
this year’s gingham revival at least in part on Taylor Swift, and the Taylor 
Swiftification of pop culture. Gingham is perfect for Swift’s homebody, 
cat-loving vibe, and she has worn it for years. If you were invited for brunch 
with Tay Tay’s squad, you would totally wear gingham. (Squad members Gigi and
Kendall Jenner <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kendall-jenner> have been 
at the forefront of this year’s gingham thing.)

Gingham is also hot. Bardot in that pink-and-white wedding dress 
<http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/13265484/brigitte-bardot-weddings/,>, Monroe in 
gingham capri pants, Gigi in her swimsuit. It’s an earthy hotness, a 
girl-can’t-help-it sex appeal rather than the strategic, Versace-wearing kind. 
(Caveat: this only works on women. On men, gingham isn’t sexy at all, just 
wholesome. Why is this? Wholesomeness and innocence is appealing in women but 
not in men?)

 Warehouse off-the-shoulder gingham dress 
And it is particularly hot right now. “Gingham is moving away from the 
Stepford wives connotations,” says Harvey Nichols fashion buying director Anita 
Barr. “It works particularly well for summer, playing on the French Riviera 
traditions of the 1950s. A grown-up, contemporary variation was seen at Stella 
McCartney, who plays with an asymmetric print in bold primary colours 
<http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/spring-summer-2016/ready-to-wear/stella-mccartney/close-up-photos/gallery/1498014>
. Or if you’re looking for a subtle nod to the trend, Alexander McQueen’swoven 
leather stiletto heels 
<http://www.harveynichols.com/152830-monochrome-woven-leather-pumps/>, 
toe-capped using a gingham print, add an edgier ladylike look.”

“Gingham says attitude: sweet, sassy, a bit geeky,” say the Warehouse design 
team, who have come up with an early summer hit with their monochromegingham 
off-the-shoulder dress 
<http://www.warehouse.co.uk/gb/clothing/dresses/gingham-off-shoulder-dress/0256737606.html>
, (£49). What does it all mean? Well, for a start, it means you should buy the 
dress.
