Surprisingly, Lonergan missed out on a best director nomination for his film 
about a grief-stricken maintenance man living in the Massachusetts seaside 
town, and the film’s female lead, Michelle Williams, also missed out on a best 
supporting actor nod.

Pablo Larrain (Jackie), Jeff Nichols (Loving), and Kelly Reichardt (Certain 
Women) all join Jenkins and Arnold in the best director category.

The best male lead award will be decided between Manchester by the Sea’s Casey 
Affleck; David Harewood (Free in Deed); Viggo Mortensen, as an off-the-grid 
father in Captain Fantastic; Jesse Plemons (Other People); and Tim Roth 
(Chronic).

The best female lead category features nominations for Annette Bening for 20th 
Century Women, Sasha Lane (American Honey), Ruth Negga (Loving), Natalie 
Portman (Jackie) and Isabelle Huppert for Paul Verhoeven’s controversial drama 
Elle.
