Starnberger See

TS Eliot immortalised this dreamy lake in The Waste Land, and Ludwig II, the 
“mad king” known for flamboyant palaces, had a summer residence here. Visitors 
can cycle the 49km border trail (bikeit.de <http://bikeit.de/>, half-day rental 
€11) in roughly four hours, or take a boat from Possenhofen to Rose Island, to 
see the eccentric monarch’s villa. Though the chi-chi town of Starnberg tends 
to fill up with tourists in summer, the smaller villages retain a quiet charm. 
Take a ferry to Bernried to see the expressionist art atBuchheim Museum der 
Phantasie <http://www.buchheimmuseum.de/> (€8.50).

 Summer splashing on Ammersee. Photograph: Ingolf Hatz/Getty Images 
Home to one of Germany’s oldest sailing schools, Ammersee in the Fünfseenland 
(“land of five lakes”) is a paradise for watersports lovers. On fine 
afternoons, dozens of windsurfers, sailors and kayakers will be out on its 
glassy surface. The less athletic can watch the action fromStrandbad Seewinkel 
<http://www.strandbad-herrsching.de/>, a manmade beach on an 8km promenade in 
Herrsching. A short bus ride away isKloster Andechs <http://www.andechs.de/> 
(tours from €5.50pp), a Benedictine monastery founded in 1455, where visitors 
can taste seven varieties of traditional Bavarian beer brewed on site.

Where to eat Dishes such as pan-seared lake trout with passion fruit butter 
(€19) atFischer <http://www.fischer-ammersee.com/> in the village of Stegen 
offer a welcome respite from pork knuckles and other hearty regional staples.


Where to stay Great location, excellent breakfast spread and contemporary 
style make the 40-roomAmmersee Hotel <http://www.ammersee-hotel.de/de/> 
(doubles from €85 B&B) in Herrsching a popular choice with Müncheners.

 Rowing boats wait for visitors to explore the islands of Chiemsee. Photograph: 
Florian Werner/Getty Images 
Sometimes nicknamed the Bavarian Sea, the region’s largest lake sprawls over 
80 square kilometres with three main islands, and a smattering of smaller ones. 
Herreninsel, or “lord’s island,” has an unfinished palace by King Ludwig II 
patterned after Versailles, and there’s a convent on its feminine counterpart, 
known either as Frauenchiemsee or Fraueninsel (“women’s island”). Both are open 
to the public and worth visiting, and it’s easy to rent a kayak in Bernau and 
row over to uninhabited Krautinsel for a picnic lunch.

Where to eat Guests have been sailing out to Klosterwirt 
<http://klosterwirt-chiemsee.de/> abbey on the Fraueninsel for over five 
centuries. Order veal-mushroom ragout (€18.90), followed by a shot of 
klosterlikör, a potent spirit distilled by the nuns.

Where to stay Rooms may be on the modest side, but Hotel Schlossblick  
<http://www.schlossblick-chiemsee.de/>(doubles from €105 room only) in Prien is 
in a prime lakeside location.

Getting there Take a regional train from Munich’s Hauptbahnhof to Prien am 
Chiemsee (from €41 return). In summer, a train runs from Prien to the main boat 
pier.

 Tegernsee’s stunning surroundings make it a very popular spot. Photograph:

Pristine water and a lovely mountainous backdrop make this a popular spot. The 
five towns around the lake have gone upmarket, with spas, fine dining, and 
luxury hotels. But this can’t detract from the lake’s sheer splendour, and 
there are lower-key gems. Spend a leisurely afternoon hiking along the banks, 
or book a boat tour (seenschifffahrt.de 
<http://www.seenschifffahrt.de/tegernsee>, from €10).

Where to eat For a blowout, Christian Jürgens’ triple-Michelin-starred 
Überfahrt <https://www.seehotel-ueberfahrt.com/de> (tasting menus from €219) in 
Rottach-Egern is worth breaking the bank for. Equally indulgent but less 
extravagant delights can be found atKirschner Stuben 
<http://www.kirschner-stuben.de/>. Try the chanterelles in cream with 
semmelknödel(bread dumplings, €18).

Where to stay Best value in the area is Hotel Ritter am Tegernsee 
<http://hotel-ritter-am-tegernsee.de/> doubles from €80 B&B) near the lake in 
Bad Wiessee.

Unlike at posh neighbour Tegernsee, all of Schliersee’s shoreline is 
accessible to the public. Signposts around the fringes in English and German 
describe the local flora, turning a stroll into an impromptu nature walk. The 
children’s playground in the town of Schliersee is so popular that families 
from other villages regularly drive over at weekends. The walk up to St Georg 
am Weinberg chapel brings a stunning view of the lake framed by snow-dusted 
peaks.

Where to eat For big portions of traditional fare such as schweinebraten 
(roast pork, €9.80),Hotel Terofal <http://www.hotelterofal.de/> by Schliersee’s 
historic theatre hits the spot.

Where to stay In summer, lakeside lounge chairs at Seehotel Schlierseer Hof 
<http://schlierseerhof.de/> (doubles from €100 B&B) fill up with sunbathers.

Cradled on all sides by 1,000-metre mountains, this area is popular with 
skiers in winter and hikers in summer, when wildflowers bloom across the 
spectacularly green landscape.

Where to eat Lamb and venison bratwursts (€8.30) at Blecksteinhaus 
<http://blecksteinhaus.com/> come from a traditional butcher and the sauerkraut 
is made in-house. For dessert,Kaiserschmarrn (€7.40), a sugar-kissed cross 
between a chopped pancake and a broken soufflé, is enough for two.

Where to stay After making the trip to this remote lake, most visitors spend 
the night and venture back to town at a leisurely pace the next day.Hotel Gundl 
Alm <http://gundlalm.de/#> (doubles from €90 B&B) is an old-timey mountain 
lodge minutes from the shore.

Getting there Bayerische Oberlandbahn (BOB) train from Munich Hauptbahnhof to

 Staffelsee inspired expressionist painters in the early 20th century. 
Photograph: Florian Werner/Getty Images 
Staffelsee’s serene beauty was supposedly a source of inspiration for 
Kandinsky, Münter, Marc and other expressionist artists in the early 1900s. The 
visionaries lived in countryside between here and Kochelsee. The picturesque 
town of Murnau has cobbled streets, outdoor markets andStaffelsee-Freibad 
<http://www.murnau.de/en/outdoor-swimming-pools.html>, a 5,000-square-metre 
recreational area with beach volleyball and free sunloungers.

Where to eat The beer garden at Gasthof zum Stern <http://gasthof-stern.de/de/>
 in Seehausen am Staffelsee does rustic fare like grilled mackerel with tangy 
potato salad (€10.80).

Where to stay Griesbräu zu Murnau <http://griesbraeu.de/> (doubles from €119 
B&B) in Murnau is about 10 minutes’ walk from the water, and has an in-house 
brewery that traces its roots back to 1670.

While most travellers stop at nearby Kochelsee, those willing to go a bit 
farther to this hidden gem in the mountains will be rewarded with impossibly 
scenic views. It’s popular with windsurfers, but the crowds that descend upon 
more accessible lakes are conspicuously absent. The water is pure enough to 
drink.

Where to eat The lakeside terrace of Hotel Karwendelblick 
<http://hotel-karwendelblick.de/> is the place to eat whole fish (€11.80) from 
the lake with butter-drenched potatoes.

Where to stay Hotel Schwaigerhof <http://schwaigerhof.de/> (doubles from €70 
B&B) may be a little on the Spartan side but it’s a charming laid-back spot 
right by the lake.

Getting there Regional Bahn (RB) from Munich Hauptbahnhof to Kochel am See 
(return from €35), then Regionalverkehr Oberbayern (RVO) bus to Walchensee.

Getting around

This is ideal road trip country, so it’s worth renting a car for ease of 
mobility and for savings on train fares. Individual train tickets can be bought 
at stations or on theDeutsche Bahn  <http://www.bahn.de>website, but there are 
cheaper options.Bayerische Oberlandbahn <http://www.bayerischeoberlandbahn.de/> 
(BOB) has a one-day Oberland Ticket from €17 for unlimited trips from 9am until 
3am. Deutsche Bahn’sBayern Pass 
<http://www.munich-touristinfo.de/Bavaria-Ticket.htm> (bahn.de) offers 
considerable savings, especially for groups of up to five. It costs €23 a day 
for one person’s unlimited travel, but a five-person ticket starts at €43, or 
less than €9pp. Under-15s travel free, with a pass-holding adult. Want to spend 
the whole weekend in the countryside? TheSchönes Wochenende 
<http:////www.bahn.com/i/view/overseas/en/prices/germany/schoenes-wochenende-ticket.shtml>
 (lovely weekend) pass offers just that: tickets valid on Saturdays and Sundays 
from €40, plus €4 for each additional passenger (for up to five).
