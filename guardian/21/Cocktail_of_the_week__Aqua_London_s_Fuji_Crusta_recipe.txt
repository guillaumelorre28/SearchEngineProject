This refreshingly citrussy cocktail is named after Mount Fuji because the 
sesame seeds on the rim of the glass make it look a bit like a rocky, 
snow-capped peak. Serves one.

1 slice lime
½ tsp each black and white sesame seeds mixed with ½ tsp sugar
50ml vodka
25ml lime juice
20ml pear liquor (such as Lejay 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lejay-Poire-Pear-Liqueur-70/dp/B00XL3RCX6>)
25ml pear purée

Rub the lime around the outside rim of a tumbler, then turn the top of the 
glass in the sesame seed and sugar mix, so it sticks. Hard shake all the 
liquids over ice, then double strain into the glass over more ice.
