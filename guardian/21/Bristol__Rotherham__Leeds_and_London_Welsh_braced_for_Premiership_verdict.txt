The four teams involved in the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/championship-rugby-union> play-offs will 
know before the start of next weekend's semi-finals whether they will meet the 
criteria for promotion to the Premiership.

Bristol entertain Rotherham next Saturday, with Leeds taking on London Welsh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-welsh> the following afternoon in the 
first of the two-legged semi-finals. The returns will take place the following 
weekend. The bad news for Worcester, who will finish bottom of the Premiership, 
is that all four of the contenders are confident of meeting the criteria.

London Welsh, who play at Oxford's Kassam Stadium where they played in the 
Premiership <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/premiership> last season, and 
Leeds, based at Headingley, have grounds that have been passed fit for the top 
flight before. Bristol are moving to Ashton Gate, which has a bigger capacity 
than their current Memorial Stadium home.

Rotherham's Clifton Lane ground would not begin to meet the criteria and they 
have reached an agreement with Barnsley Football Club to play at Oakwell next 
season if promoted.

The auditors' report into whether the four have met the criteria will be 
considered by the Professional Game Board on Thursday with the Rugby Football 
Union set to consider its recommendation the following day, before any of the 
semi-finals start.
