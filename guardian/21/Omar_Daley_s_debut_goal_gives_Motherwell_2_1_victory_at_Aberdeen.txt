Rangers suffered another slump after an international break when they were 
held to a goalless draw bySt Johnstone at Ibrox. The stalemate allowed Celtic 
to close the gap on the Scottish Premier League leaders to 10 points following 
their win at Inverness earlier in the day.

Rangers had been held by St Mirren 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stmirren> on their return from the 
previous international break and they were again unable to find a cutting edge 
against the Perth side, who held on for a creditable draw.

Omar Daley marked his first Motherwell start with the winning goal as the 
Lanarkshire side won 2-1 atAberdeen. The Jamaican international shot home from 
18 yards in the 53rd minute asMotherwell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/motherwell> strengthened their grip on 
third place in the SPL.

Scott Vernon had equalised four minutes after Michael Higdon headed the 
visitors into an early lead, butAberdeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen> rarely looked like levelling 
again after Daley struck.

Aberdeen brought Peter Pawlett on for Chris Clark but they could not break 
Motherwell down despite pushing them back at times.

Billy Brown's bid to become Hibernian manager began with a 1-1 draw against 
his former clubKilmarnock at Easter Road. Following 23 years as assistant to 
Jim Jefferies, including two spells atHearts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts>, the caretaker manager was 
seeking to prove his credentials as long-term successor to Colin Calderwood.

It was not an entirely convincing display as Manuel Pascali put the visitors 
in front after 36 minutes before the half-time substitute Leigh Griffiths 
equalised after 50 minutes.

Scott Robertson's first goal in nearly three years gave Dundee United a 1-0 
win overHearts and added on-field misery to the off-field woes at Tynecastle. 
Robertson dived to head in the only goal of the game in the 24th minute, 
capitalising on a pinpoint cross from the home captain Jon Daly.

First-half goals from Kenny McLean and Nigel Hasselbaink helped St Mirren to a 
2-1 victory overDunfermline at St Mirren Park. The Dunfermline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/dunfermline> midfielder Joe Cardle scored 
after 63 minutes to set up a nervous finish for the home side, but Danny 
Lennon's men held on to move up to fifth place in the SPL.

In the Scottish Cup, Airdrie United recorded a club record victory in thrashing
Gala Fairydean 11-0 in their third-round tie.
