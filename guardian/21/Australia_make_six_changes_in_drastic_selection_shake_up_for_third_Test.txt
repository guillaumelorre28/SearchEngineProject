Selectors have pleaded for patience after coldly axing half the Australian 
Test team in the biggest carve-up in a generation. Four cricketers – 
20-year-old opening bat Matt Renshaw, batsmen Peter Handscomb and Nic Maddison, 
and swing bowler Chadd Sayers – could debut against South Africa on Thursday in 
Adelaide.

Wicketkeeper Matthew Wade has also been recalled with paceman Jackson Bird, 
while axed from the Hobart horror show are one-Test wonders Callum Ferguson and 
Joe Mennie, gloveman Peter Nevill and opener Joe Burns, with Adam Voges ruled 
out by concussion.

Interim chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns defended the brutal sweep, saying 
an emergency revamp was needed. “We don’t expect an immediate turnaround but we 
have got a bit of faith in these guys now,” Hohns said.

Yorkshire-born Renshaw, who moved to New Zealand aged seven before settling in 
Australia four years later, Handscomb and Maddinson will earn a Test cap with 
selectors swayed by their steely character as much as continued domestic 
run-scoring.


And Wade’s combative nature, and superior ability with the bat to Nevill, gets 
him another crack at Test cricket after three and a half years in the 
wilderness.


“We certainly are looking at players’ characters and their toughness,” Hohns 
said. “[Wade] is obviously seen as a tough competitor and that is what we’re 
looking for in our players now.”

Australia has not unveiled four Test debutants in one game since 1978 but 
Hohns said the drastic changes were discussed beforeRod Marsh quit as chairman 
of selectors last week

, following Australia’s fifth Test loss in a row.

“We haven’t won very much. We have lost a lot of Test matches of late. So we 
considered it was time to start to revamp and look to the future,” he said.


Hohns dodged questions about the merits of selection of Australia’s previous 
two Test sides under Marsh, but said regeneration was imperative. “I’m not so 
sure it’s a bad crisis ... it wasn’t long ago we were No.1 in the world,” Hohns 
said.

“Things haven’t gone our way, no excuses. We haven’t played well. But a lot of 
countries go through this, I don’t have any doubts.”

Hohns sympathised with South Australia’s Ferguson and Mennie, dumped after 
making their Test debut in Hobart, while Burns was dropped after one Test back 
in the side.


Offspinner Nathan Lyon was saved from the cull by fellow spinner Steve 
O’Keefe’s latest injury, a calf strain.


Queensland’s Renshaw and NSW’s Maddison are classy left-handers while 
Handscomb was the main beneficiary of the selection wheel of fortune: on a 
weekend when they demanded runs, he scored a double-century.


“It was definitely a bit of a surprise when I received the text message and 
the phone call this morning from Trevor,” Handscomb said.

Squad: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner, Jackson Bird, Peter Handscomb, 
Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nic Maddinson, Nathan Lyon, Matt Renshaw, Chadd 
Sayers, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade (12th man to be named).
