Ricky Hatton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rickyhatton> has settled a 
Â£1.4million claim for unpaid wages from his former trainer.

Hatton today reached an undisclosed but "mutually acceptable" deal with Billy 
Graham on the third day of a hearing at Manchester's Civil Justice Centre.

Graham, who accused Hatton of failing to pay him in relation to two fights 
against Juan Lazcano and Floyd Mayweather, said after the hearing that he was 
happy with the outcome and keen to move on with his life.

Hatton, the ex-light welterweight world champion, has not fought since May 
2009.
