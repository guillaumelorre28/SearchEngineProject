BST set a deadline of 21 July for a response, but received no acknowledgement 
from the club owner Owen Oyston.

Oyston has been in charge of the Seasiders since 1987, while his son Karl, who 
recentlyreceived an FA ban 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/10/fa-ban-karl-oyston-blackpool-chairman-abusive-text-messages-football>
 for sending a Blackpool fan an abusive text message, is chairman.

The Oyston family have proven unpopular in recent years, having been subjected 
to numerous fan protests, and recently saw a pre-season match against Lancaster 
City abandoned following a pitch invasion as well as a game at Morecambe called 
off through further safety fears.

“The deadline has passed without the basic courtesy of a reply to our offer,” 
a trust spokesman told the BBC <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33623963>
. “This lack of response is disappointing but not in the least surprising.

“The deadline may have passed, but our offer remains on the table while we 
assess our next move. That next move will be subject to the wishes and approval 
of our members.

“We remain committed to discussion with the Oystons about a change in 
ownership or a change in the power structure at the club, to bring about a 
situation in which the fans have a real say in how our club is governed and how 
our money is spent.”

Blackpool were relegated to League One last, finishing bottom of the 
Championship with 26 points, andhave since appointed the former West Ham 
assistant Neil McDonald

 as manager following Lee Clark’s resignation.
