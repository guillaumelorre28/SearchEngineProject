Peterborough <https://www.theguardian.com/football/peterborough> have parted 
company with their manager, Darren Ferguson, after eight years in charge over 
two spells and in the wake of a 3-0 defeat by MK Dons, their third loss in four 
league games.

The Posh’s chairman, Darragh MacAnthony, called Ferguson, son of Sir Alex, 
“one of the finest managers in our club’s history” in a statement on the club 
website announcing the departure of the 43-year-old and his coaching team.

MacAnthony said Ferguson felt “a new challenge is needed for both himself and 
the football club”. Dave Robertson, the academy and youth team manager, will be 
in charge until a new manager is appointed.

“We have had over eight incredible years together with tremendous success on 
and off the field. I will be forever in his debt for the great times, fantastic 
football and professionalism he has brought to our football club. I also have 
no doubt that wherever he goes next, it will lead to great success for him and 
the club he next works for,” the statement said.

“I’m personally very disappointed in our current league position, the 
performances from our playing squad and the fact that we have dropped way below 
our own standards that we set out at as a football club.“

Peterborough are 15th in League One, eight points above the relegation zone.

“It has not been our finest six months results wise or performance wise as a 
football team and my remit is to now go out and find a new football manager and 
coaching staff that will challenge and inspire these players to greater heights 
and to start fulfilling their potential individually and collectively,” 
MacAnthony said.
