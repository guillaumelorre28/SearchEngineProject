James DeGale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> produced the best 
performance of his professional career as he dismantled the dangerous American 
Brandon Gonzales in four rounds to earn the promise of a world title fight, 
perhaps by the end of the year.

Gonzales was no slouch. He entered this IBF super-middleweight eliminator with 
an unbeaten 20-fight record and had Virgil Hunter, who took Andre Ward from 
scratch to world champion and also trains Amir Khan, in his corner. But DeGale 
could see a world title fight dangled in front of him and leapt at it with a 
viciousness he has shown only fitfully since winning Olympic gold in Beijing.

He hurt Gonzales in the first, kept up the pressure in the second and third, 
and destroyed him in the fourth. The penultimate act was artful. As Gonzales 
came forward, trying to close the distance, he was caught by a cuffing 
left-right followed by a right hook and a full-stretch left that put him down. 
He got up but never recovered. The fight was stopped with 22 seconds of the 
round remaining.

At the finish DeGale held his gloves up to the sky and kissed his trainer, Jim 
McDonnell, on the cheek before insisting: “I am 100% ready for a world title 
shot.” And the promoter, Eddie Hearn, was in no mood to disagree. “The winner 
of Carl Froch–George Groves will fight James within 120 days,” he said. “It 
will be another big fight for Britain.”

Meanwhile McDonnell purred over what he had seen. “For James to produce a 
statement like that shows he is in the big time,” he said. “James is about the 
big fights and the bright lights.”
