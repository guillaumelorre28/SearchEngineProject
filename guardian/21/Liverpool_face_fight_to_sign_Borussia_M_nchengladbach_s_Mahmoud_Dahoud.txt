However, it is understood that despite Liverpool’s willingness to offer up to 
€30m (£25m), Dahoud has been informed he will not be allowed to leave Gladbach 
followingthe sale of fellow midfielder Granit Xhaka to Arsenal

. A source close to the player told the Guardian that he is happy to continue 
his development at Gladbach “for another season”, with his contract due to 
expire in 2018.

That could mean any potential suitors are able to purchase him for less, 
although Gladbach are understood to be preparing to offer him a new deal.

Dahoud, who was only 10 months old when his family fled the largely Kurdish 
town of Amuda on Syria’s northern border with Turkey, was considered as a 
potential member of Joachim Löw’s Euro 2016 squad and has represented Germany 
at various youth levels.
