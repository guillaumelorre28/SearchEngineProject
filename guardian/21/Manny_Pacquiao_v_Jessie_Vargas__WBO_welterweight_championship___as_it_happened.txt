“My aim every round was to knock him out,” says Pacquiao during an in-ring 
interview with Stephen A Smith. “I feel happy.”

Adds the new WBO welterweight champion: “After this I’m going back to 
Philippines to go work. But for the next fight, I’ll talk to Bob.”

Smith presses Pacquiao on whether he would rather fight Terrence Crawford or 
Floyd Mayweather, the two biggest names put out there for his next opponent.

“Whoever the people want me to fight,” he says. “I’m not picking an opponent 
or choosing anything.”

Round 12

Pacquiao landing shots amid chants of Man-ny! Man-ny! from the crowd. Another 
knockdown near the end of the round but again it’s ruled a slip. A one-sided 
beating of a champion a decade his junior. Pacquiao, at 37, just may be the 
best active fighter in the welterweight division.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 109-118 Pacquiao)

Round 11

Pacquiao looking incredibly energized here. More in-and-out movement keeps 
Vargas off balance then a huge overhand right from Pacquiao. Vargas has slowed 
down a lot here. Pacquiao caught flush by Vargas while rushing in but he takes 
it well. Still, a scary moment. Pacquiao lands with a right near the end of the 
round and goes down, but the referee rules it a slip. It looks as if their feet 
were tangled but that easily could have been ruled a knockdown. Easy round for 
Pacquiao.

Round 10

Pacquiao looking comfortable now, countering at will, landing punches from all 
sorts of angles. A double hook, a straight left, an uppercut. He seems to have 
figured Vargas out completely. He’s outlanding and outthrowing him. Vargas to 
his credit has shown no quit, it’s just a different class of fighter before him.

Round 9

Two hard overhand lefts by Pacquiao but Vargas is unbowed. He’s still trying 
to win this fight, not simply exit the ring upright like so many previous 
Pacquiao opponents at this stage. Yet Pacquiao continues to frustrate Vargas 
and make him miss and he wins another round. Crucially, the Nevada State 
Athletic Commission has ruled the cut over Vargas’ eye was caused by a punch. 
That means if the fight is stopped as a result of the cut, Pacquiao will be 
awarded the victory without going to the scorecards.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 82-88 Pacquiao)

Round 8

Vargas connects with a massive straight right but Pacquiao fires back with a 
flurry of punches. A clash of heads but it appears to be accidental. Pacquaio 
really punishing Vargas here with blinding speed and now he’s opened a cut 
above the champion’s right eye. Clearly a Pacquiao round.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 73-78 Pacquiao)

Round 7

Better work from Pacquiao right out of the gate: a jab, a hook. An array of 
straight lefts. He’s picking up the pace and scoring with accuracy. A clear 
round for Pacquiao. When he’s active, he’s clearly the better fighter. When he 
sits back, he allows Vargas to control the pace and the action.

Round 6

Pacquiao connects with a left hand and Vargas is showing a lot of swelling on 
the right side of his face, but he responds with a hard right that catches 
Pacquiao flush! Now another right by Vargas! It’s only taken him half the fight 
but he’s finally found range with it. He’s controlling distance a bit better 
and on our card he’s won his second round in a row.

Round 5

Good straight left by Pacquiao but it doesn’t seem to affect Vargas, who now 
is ramping up the aggression. He barrels forward and throws a series of 
punches. None seem to connect with substance but it’s better than waiting for 
Pacquiao to bring the action. Pacquiao landing punches here and there but 
Vargas looking more confidence and returning when he can. The closest round yet 
and Vargas has really managed to keep it on even terms, just enough to nick it.

Round 4

Vargas just looks slower and he’s expended a lot of energy simply keeping 
Pacquiao at bay, so it’s a problem that won’t resolve itself. He lands a nice 
right early on but continues to miss wildly with the left hook. The constant 
in-and-out, herky-jerky movement of the challenger is just too much to keep up 
with. Another good right by Vargas near the bell. That was his best round but 
I’ve still got to tip it to Pacquiao.

Round 3

Vargas rattled here and Pacquiao starts to open with combinations. A flurry of 
punches moves Vargas back but he stays on his feet. Oh and Manny is really 
letting his hands go now: punches in bunches from all angles. Now the crowd is 
chanting: Man-ny! Man-ny! Pacquiao warned for a low blow. Vargas connects with 
a stinging shot near the end of the round, perhaps his best shot of the fight, 
but it’s not enough to take the third. Pacquiao sure doesn’t look like the 
fighter who is 10 years older.

Round 2

Vargas opening up more here with a few tenatative combinations but failing to 
connect with anything substantive. Pacquiao bobbing and weaving, looking for an 
opening and keeping Vargas on the back foot simply with feints. Vargas misses 
with a wild right and Pacquiao lands a stinging counter.And down goes Vargas! A 
straight left by Pacquiao drops the champion to roars from the crowd near the 
end of the round.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 8-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 17-20 Pacquiao)

Round 1

Pacquiao fires a few right jabs. Vargas’ advantages in height (six inches) and 
reach (five) are apparent, but he looks tighter and on edge. A body shot from 
Vargas, who is boxing and staying disciplined, measuring distance with the lead 
left. Good counter left by Pacquiao, who is circling the champion and looking 
for an opening. A compact uppercut by Pacquiao near the end of the round and 
it’s a solid start for the challenger

Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao

Here comes Vargas. He’s smiling, walking fast to the ring in a red robe with 
gold trim. Michael Buffer is making the fighter introductions. Not much longer 
now.

Manny Pacquiao <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/manny-pacquiao> is making 
his walk to the ring first as the challenger. He’s smiling from ear to ear, as 
he does, wearing a black robe with yellow trim and looking relaxed. He kneels 
in a corner in prayer as the lights go down for Jessie Vargas’ entrance.

Oscar Valdez has defeated Hiroshige Osawa by a technical knockout to retain 
his WBO featherweight title. The stoppage came at the 1:50 mark of the seventh 
round.

Meanwhile, Mayweather is hugging Top Rank’s Todd DuBoef at ringside as camera 
flashes pop in a frenzy. It’s not an invitation for Mayweather-Pacquiao II but 
it sure feels like a save the date: 6 May 2017.

Floyd Mayweather has just arrived at the Thomas & Mack Center to watch 
tonight’s main event from ringside. Oh boy. Bear in mind Vargas, one of the 
first major signees to Mayweather’s then-nascent promotional outfit, has a 
friendly relationship with Floyd. But brace yourselves for a call-out if 
Pacquiao manages to win in spectacular fashion.

Osawa down midway through the fourth on a massive left hand from Valdez. He’s 
up and the Mexican is looking to close the show as referee Vic Drakulich 
inspects the action closely. Impressively, Osawa is back on his feet and in the 
fight. He makes it out of the fourth round but he’s down 40-35 on the 
Guardian’s unofficial card.

We’re only two rounds into Osawa-Valdez and it’s already become clear which 
way this one’s going. Valdez, the 25-year-old from Mexico who competed in the 
Beijing Olympics when he was 17, connected with a pair of stinging rights in 
the second that rocked Osawa badly. Just a one-sided beating so far that I 
don’t see lasting too much longer.

Jessie Magdaleno has just unseated Nonito Donaire for the WBO junior 
featherweight title by a unanimous decision. Two judges scored it 116-112 while 
the third, Adalaide Byrd, incredibly had it 118-110. Magdaleno clearly won the 
fight but no sane observer could argue he won 10 rounds out of 12.

Only one more undercard bout between now and the main event: Oscar Valdez and 
Hiroshige Osawa for Valdez’s WBO featherweight title.

Hello and welcome to tonight’s WBO welterweight title fight between Manny 
Pacquiao <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/manny-pacquiao> and Jessie Vargas 
from the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.

Pacquiao, the Filipino senator and eight-division world champion, is back in 
action for the first time since animpressive win over Timothy Bradley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/10/manny-pacquiao-twice-floors-timothy-bradley-in-unanimous-decision-win>
 in April. After that fight he announced a retirement that few believed would 
stick. So here he is, fighting for the WBO’s version of the 147lb title 
currently held by Jessie Vargas, who claimed the vacant belt with an upset of 
Sadam Ali by ninth-round knockout in March.

At 37, Pacquiao is clarely on the downside of an extraordinary career. But he 
looked in fine form against the outstanding Bradley, scoring two knockdowns, 
and is widely expected to prevail here tonight. The southpaw from Sarangani 
province was installed as a -850 favorite while Vargas opened as a +625 
underdog. Those odds have shortened slightly as the fight has drawn closer, but 
there’s no doubt that Pacquiao will enter the ring a firm favorite tonight in 
Las Vegas.

Plenty more to come. Thanks for setting in with us.

That’s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us. Here’s a 
look at tonight’s full fight report.

Pacquiao tops Vargas to regain title as Mayweather watches from ringside

“My aim every round was to knock him out,” says Pacquiao during an in-ring 
interview with Stephen A Smith. “I feel happy.”

Adds the new WBO welterweight champion: “After this I’m going back to 
Philippines to go work. But for the next fight, I’ll talk to Bob.”

Smith presses Pacquiao on whether he would rather fight Terrence Crawford or 
Floyd Mayweather, the two biggest names put out there for his next opponent.

“Whoever the people want me to fight,” he says. “I’m not picking an opponent 
or choosing anything.”
 
Pacquiao wins a unanimous decision by scores of 114-113, 118-109 and 118-109.
 
Pacquiao landing shots amid chants of Man-ny! Man-ny! from the crowd. Another 
knockdown near the end of the round but again it’s ruled a slip. A one-sided 
beating of a champion a decade his junior. Pacquiao, at 37, just may be the 
best active fighter in the welterweight division.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 109-118 Pacquiao)
 
Pacquiao looking incredibly energized here. More in-and-out movement keeps 
Vargas off balance then a huge overhand right from Pacquiao. Vargas has slowed 
down a lot here. Pacquiao caught flush by Vargas while rushing in but he takes 
it well. Still, a scary moment. Pacquiao lands with a right near the end of the 
round and goes down, but the referee rules it a slip. It looks as if their feet 
were tangled but that easily could have been ruled a knockdown. Easy round for 
Pacquiao.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 100-108 Pacquiao)
 
Pacquiao looking comfortable now, countering at will, landing punches from all 
sorts of angles. A double hook, a straight left, an uppercut. He seems to have 
figured Vargas out completely. He’s outlanding and outthrowing him. Vargas to 
his credit has shown no quit, it’s just a different class of fighter before him.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 91-98 Pacquiao)
 
Two hard overhand lefts by Pacquiao but Vargas is unbowed. He’s still trying 
to win this fight, not simply exit the ring upright like so many previous 
Pacquiao opponents at this stage. Yet Pacquiao continues to frustrate Vargas 
and make him miss and he wins another round. Crucially, the Nevada State 
Athletic Commission has ruled the cut over Vargas’ eye was caused by a punch. 
That means if the fight is stopped as a result of the cut, Pacquiao will be 
awarded the victory without going to the scorecards.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 82-88 Pacquiao)
 
Vargas connects with a massive straight right but Pacquiao fires back with a 
flurry of punches. A clash of heads but it appears to be accidental. Pacquaio 
really punishing Vargas here with blinding speed and now he’s opened a cut 
above the champion’s right eye. Clearly a Pacquiao round.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 73-78 Pacquiao)
 
Better work from Pacquiao right out of the gate: a jab, a hook. An array of 
straight lefts. He’s picking up the pace and scoring with accuracy. A clear 
round for Pacquiao. When he’s active, he’s clearly the better fighter. When he 
sits back, he allows Vargas to control the pace and the action.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 64-68 Pacquiao)
 
Pacquiao connects with a left hand and Vargas is showing a lot of swelling on 
the right side of his face, but he responds with a hard right that catches 
Pacquiao flush! Now another right by Vargas! It’s only taken him half the fight 
but he’s finally found range with it. He’s controlling distance a bit better 
and on our card he’s won his second round in a row.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 10-9 Pacquiao (Vargas 55-58 Pacquiao)
 
Good straight left by Pacquiao but it doesn’t seem to affect Vargas, who now 
is ramping up the aggression. He barrels forward and throws a series of 
punches. None seem to connect with substance but it’s better than waiting for 
Pacquiao to bring the action. Pacquiao landing punches here and there but 
Vargas looking more confidence and returning when he can. The closest round yet 
and Vargas has really managed to keep it on even terms, just enough to nick it.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 10-9 Pacquiao (Vargas 45-49 Pacquiao)
 
Vargas just looks slower and he’s expended a lot of energy simply keeping 
Pacquiao at bay, so it’s a problem that won’t resolve itself. He lands a nice 
right early on but continues to miss wildly with the left hook. The constant 
in-and-out, herky-jerky movement of the challenger is just too much to keep up 
with. Another good right by Vargas near the bell. That was his best round but 
I’ve still got to tip it to Pacquiao.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 35-40 Pacquiao)
 
Vargas rattled here and Pacquiao starts to open with combinations. A flurry of 
punches moves Vargas back but he stays on his feet. Oh and Manny is really 
letting his hands go now: punches in bunches from all angles. Now the crowd is 
chanting: Man-ny! Man-ny! Pacquiao warned for a low blow. Vargas connects with 
a stinging shot near the end of the round, perhaps his best shot of the fight, 
but it’s not enough to take the third. Pacquiao sure doesn’t look like the 
fighter who is 10 years older.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 26-30 Pacquiao)
 
Vargas opening up more here with a few tenatative combinations but failing to 
connect with anything substantive. Pacquiao bobbing and weaving, looking for an 
opening and keeping Vargas on the back foot simply with feints. Vargas misses 
with a wild right and Pacquiao lands a stinging counter.And down goes Vargas! A 
straight left by Pacquiao drops the champion to roars from the crowd near the 
end of the round.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 8-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 17-20 Pacquiao)
 
Pacquiao fires a few right jabs. Vargas’ advantages in height (six inches) and 
reach (five) are apparent, but he looks tighter and on edge. A body shot from 
Vargas, who is boxing and staying disciplined, measuring distance with the lead 
left. Good counter left by Pacquiao, who is circling the champion and looking 
for an opening. A compact uppercut by Pacquiao near the end of the round and 
it’s a solid start for the challenger

Guardian’s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao
 
Final instructions from referee Kenny Bayless and there’s the opening bell! 
We’ll pick it up from here with round-by-round coverage.
 
Here comes Vargas. He’s smiling, walking fast to the ring in a red robe with 
gold trim. Michael Buffer is making the fighter introductions. Not much longer 
now.
 
Manny Pacquiao <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/manny-pacquiao> is making 
his walk to the ring first as the challenger. He’s smiling from ear to ear, as 
he does, wearing a black robe with yellow trim and looking relaxed. He kneels 
in a corner in prayer as the lights go down for Jessie Vargas’ entrance.
 
Anthem time at the Thomas & Mack Center: Mexico first, then the Philippines, 
then the United States.
 
Oscar Valdez has defeated Hiroshige Osawa by a technical knockout to retain 
his WBO featherweight title. The stoppage came at the 1:50 mark of the seventh 
round.

Meanwhile, Mayweather is hugging Top Rank’s Todd DuBoef at ringside as camera 
flashes pop in a frenzy. It’s not an invitation for Mayweather-Pacquiao II but 
it sure feels like a save the date: 6 May 2017.
 
Floyd Mayweather has just arrived at the Thomas & Mack Center to watch 
tonight’s main event from ringside. Oh boy. Bear in mind Vargas, one of the 
first major signees to Mayweather’s then-nascent promotional outfit, has a 
friendly relationship with Floyd. But brace yourselves for a call-out if 
Pacquiao manages to win in spectacular fashion.
 
Osawa down midway through the fourth on a massive left hand from Valdez. He’s 
up and the Mexican is looking to close the show as referee Vic Drakulich 
inspects the action closely. Impressively, Osawa is back on his feet and in the 
fight. He makes it out of the fourth round but he’s down 40-35 on the 
Guardian’s unofficial card.
 
We’re only two rounds into Osawa-Valdez and it’s already become clear which 
way this one’s going. Valdez, the 25-year-old from Mexico who competed in the 
Beijing Olympics when he was 17, connected with a pair of stinging rights in 
the second that rocked Osawa badly. Just a one-sided beating so far that I 
don’t see lasting too much longer.
 
Jessie Magdaleno has just unseated Nonito Donaire for the WBO junior 
featherweight title by a unanimous decision. Two judges scored it 116-112 while 
the third, Adalaide Byrd, incredibly had it 118-110. Magdaleno clearly won the 
fight but no sane observer could argue he won 10 rounds out of 12.

Only one more undercard bout between now and the main event: Oscar Valdez and 
Hiroshige Osawa for Valdez’s WBO featherweight title.
 
Both fighters made weight yesterday afternoon ahead of tonight’s main event. 
Pacquiao came in at 144.8lbs, well under the welterweight limit. Vargas tipped 
the scales at 146.5lbs.
 Pacquiao and Vargas make weight on Friday afternoon.  
Hello and welcome to tonight’s WBO welterweight title fight between Manny 
Pacquiao <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/manny-pacquiao> and Jessie Vargas 
from the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.

Pacquiao, the Filipino senator and eight-division world champion, is back in 
action for the first time since animpressive win over Timothy Bradley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/10/manny-pacquiao-twice-floors-timothy-bradley-in-unanimous-decision-win>
 in April. After that fight he announced a retirement that few believed would 
stick. So here he is, fighting for the WBO’s version of the 147lb title 
currently held by Jessie Vargas, who claimed the vacant belt with an upset of 
Sadam Ali by ninth-round knockout in March.

At 37, Pacquiao is clarely on the downside of an extraordinary career. But he 
looked in fine form against the outstanding Bradley, scoring two knockdowns, 
and is widely expected to prevail here tonight. The southpaw from Sarangani 
province was installed as a -850 favorite while Vargas opened as a +625 
underdog. Those odds have shortened slightly as the fight has drawn closer, but 
there’s no doubt that Pacquiao will enter the ring a firm favorite tonight in 
Las Vegas.

Plenty more to come. Thanks for setting in with us.
 
Bryan will be here shortly.
