Neil Robertson there, the Tom Hanks of snooker betting.

Thanks for joining us on a busy old bank holiday night of sport. And over and 
done with well before midnight too – splendid.

There’s moisture welling in Ding’s eyes as he gives dignified testimony to 
Hazel Irvine. The 6-0 deficit in the first session must have taken a huge 
emotional toil.

As for the champion? “Thank God I’ve got a decent B-game to fall back on.” 
Selby isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but he’s a fantastic match-player and a 
worthy champion.

The cheques are out. That’s £330,000 to Mark Selby, and £137,500 to Ding 
Junhui.

But the trophy is the main prize for Selby, followed by photo opportunities 
with spouse and bemused child. Ticker tape everywhere, adding a level of 
excitement to proceedings that the lack of coloured strips of paper simply 
couldn’t provide. Any problems, Crucible types,see here

Quite the night for Leicester, all told, and Selby does his Foxes bit by 
holding his team’s banner next to the trophy.

Well done Selby, commiserations to Ding Junhui. A topsy-turvy final that never 
quite started to tip fully into the Chinese player’s favour.

MARK SELBY IS YOUR 2016 WORLD CHAMPION: Selby 18-14 Ding (74-0)

AND IT’S THERE.

Ding needs snookers, but he’s not going to get chance to make them, and he 
knows it. Handshake time.

Selby looks like getting home with four frames to spare.

For my part, I look like getting home with at least two trains to spare. It’s 
67-0 to Selby, with 67 left on the table. One more ball …

Selby’s armed with the experience of having been in this position two years 
ago, and he’s wearing the pressure extremely well. A wobbly old red aside, the 
balls are being put away cleanly.

Is this the last table visit of this year’s championship? It could be. He’s 
already 39-0 up in the frame.

Frame 32: Selby 17-14 Ding

That frame broke an awkward spell for Selby, and he looks calm and assured 
with the reds well set.

Incidentally, for those who don’t want to know what happened in tonight’s 
Premier League fixture, look away now, and try not to read the content of the 
Breaking News alert at the bottom of your browser window. At least one phone in 
the Crucible auditorium just chimed with the news, much to the annoyance of 
referee Paul Collier.

Selby 17-14 Ding (59-11)

A punishing period of tactical stuff is broken by a cracking double from 
Selby, but he plays it with safety-first in mind, and rolls up behind the black 
40 ahead, with 43 left on the table.

But then Ding cracks, leaving both of the remaining reds on, and Selby is on 
to the table like a lion on a gazelle. He gets over the line, and a 51-minute 
frame goes his way. Just one more frame needed for the world No1.

It’s fair to say that Selby is getting a bit more of the rub of the old green 
at this stage. A flick off the blue elevates a good-looking safety, leaving 
Ding in big trouble. But despite the obvious nerves, more calm hands give Selby 
something to think about.

And, after a fashion, he conjures a lovely snooker, sending the ball across 
and up, leaving Ding needing to swerve the white from behind the brown.


The fella can swerve the thing, no question about it. Too much as it turns 
out, resulting in a costly seven-point foul as he strikes the black.

Attempt two is a lovely shot however, and they’re going toe-to-toe with some 
cracking safety play here.

Selby’s nearly home in this frame, 43-7 up, but all the reds are now safe on 
the bottom cushion. That’s better news for the world No1 than it is for Ding at 
this stage.

And Selby’s finding his range with his safety play too. Ding is 36 behind with 
just 51 on the table. Not that he’s any slouch on the safety front himself – 
he’s acquitted himself brilliantly at times in this match.

Mark Williams – two-time champion at the Crucible – is getting butterflies 
just watching …

Selby’s looking a tiny bit ruffled here. Normally these tactical passages of 
play are to his liking, but his errors are irking him.

He takes his time before addressing a long-ish red, cueing awkwardly over the 
blue. In. A phenomenal shot. But – not for the first time tonight – it’s 
followed with something a bit average. Selby aims to cannon on a red but fails 
to make contact, instead flicking off the pink, leaving the cue ball some 
distance from his next object. Which he misses by some distance.

Ding can’t capitalise though, and badly misjudges his attempted red. Selby 
back at the table, puts the red Ding leaves away, and suddenly there’s a bit of 
daylight in this frame – Selby 27-7 up.

Ding’s in a pickle here. The white is, unusually, touching two reds. 

He takes a seat on the cushion, cue almost vertical, and jabs tentatively down 
on to the cue ball. The white moves, but – crucially – neither of the reds 
budges. Good, calm hands.

But he leaves it touching one of the reds, and so it’s an easy safety for 
Selby, playing away. And he does more than a merely adequate job of putting the 
squeeze on Ding by tucking the white behind the brown.

Advantage Selby? Ding overhits his next effort. However, the man from 
Leicester overcooks his positional shot from an easy red. He might have to opt 
for safety once more.

Timely distraction from Alex Corcos …

I’ve heard it for the last time now and a mildly extensive Google search has 
yielded nothing: what is Ding’s entrance music? It sounds promising

Sadly Shazam decided to crash my phone when the players were coming out, so I 
failed to turn up an answer to this. Public hive mind – now is your time to 
shine.

We were due a messy passage of play – and here’s one.

Selby, again with extensions to extensions at hand, fails to sink a 
regulation-looking pot and he’s back in his seat 6-7 down in the frame, with 
safety-friendly reds everywhere. For those who don’t like the tactical side of 
this sport, look away now.

One-nil, to the Mark-Selby.

Lovely plant from the Leicester man, making it work between two balls sitting 
some distance apart.

Then he nestles behind the yellow to give Ding something to think about. A 
delicate dink off the side cushion looks like limiting the damage, but there’s 
a red on to the left middle …

Selby thinks better of it, and goes safe again. Good choice, because Ding 
ballses his next shot up quite badly. White in mid-table, red winking at the 
bottom right corner alluringly – seemingly a regulation pot for Selby. But he 
misses. It’s a huge, huge let-off for Ding.

But he can’t capitalise, and only gets seven points on the board before 
missing a lengthy blue with the rest. Selby’s back in.

Frame 31: Selby 16-14 Ding

None of this tightly clustered pack nonsense this time around. Ding splits 
them up good and early. Ordinarily this would be good news for any decent pro, 
but it also means any missed red could be the last shot of the frame.

Some good safety play from both men here – no balls down yet.

I might have made a mistake by referencing banners incidentally. A fair bit of 
correspondence of differing quality on this subject. We’re all about the little 
guy here at the Guardian though, so here’s this from Ian, presumably, one of
those Clapton Ultras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/10/clapton-ultras-anti-fascist-essex-senior-league-football>
 …

 Enjoying your coverage this evening. Ultras banners are always on the large 
size – some as big as a snooker table. No A4 at Clapton. Ian.


And I thought some of my links were tenuous.

Selby 16-14 Ding (0-103)

Shot of the evening – a ridiculous, thinly cut red, leaving the white 
careering horizontally several times. That brings up 98 for Ding. Then it’s a 
formality to get over the century mark to 103. With three figures on the board 
however, he immediately dumps out, so no clearance this time.

But those paying attention may note that he’s creeping ever-closer to Selby 
now.

Premier League, sch-memier league 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/02/chelsea-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live>
. All the cool kids are over this way.

Ding’s break crosses the half-century mark. He’s not exactly got the ball on a 
string, as TV’s finest like to put it, but is working hard to make this visit 
count.

One more charge into the pack needed to free up some more options of a crimson 
bent – bootiful. And he’s 65 ahead, with 75 still on the table. Then 66 ahead 
with an easy black to leave Selby needing to do his snooker-y thing. But I 
smell a century.

Or not. A lovely long red from Ding. 16-14 has a nice ring to it for a plucky 
upstart. There’s a long way to go before that though – a Hobbit’s-handful of 
reds (to my mind, three) are available before further development is required.

This is calm and assured stuff under the circumstances. He’s 28 up, but a 
thwack into the bunch leaves a tricky red to the right centre. Suddenly he’s 
35-0 up with lots to play with.

Frame 30: Selby 16-13 Ding

Selby to break after the mid-session interval. Tidy enough. Ding sends the cue 
ball back towards the green pocket, flirts with it suggestively, and leaves 
Selby with an awkward safety. The world No1 clips the object red far too thin, 
but the cue ball, between mid-table and baulk, has the blue between it and 
anything meaningful.

His next safety is much better, and although Ding gets the white back up the 
table, Selby has a chance. No dice. But he plays it as a shot to nothing with 
enough weight to get tightish to the top cushion. We might have a few minutes 
of this.

Bit of live-blogging housekeeping from eight days ago while I have a sec …

In Lawrence Ostlere’s mile-by-mile coverage of the London Marathon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/apr/24/london-marathon-2016-live>, 
he plugged in tweets from me giving sporadic from-the-roadside updates of the 
Guardian Sport entrants. We had Owen Gibson > Sachin Nakrani > Steve McMillan 
in the opening stages, which remained true until the boy Nakrani blew a gasket 
in the latter half, allowing the hobbled McMillan to romp on through.

Unfortunately, what I failed to acknowledge is that the whippet-like youngling 
Alan Smith, also of this parish, was also in the race. And he beat the lot of 
them, with a fine time of 3hrs 15m 13sec. So belated congrats Alan.

ATTEMPTED SEGUE: a while back Alan noted that he once took part in a race up 
against one Ronnie O’Sullivan. Intriguingly, some of Ronnie times can be found 
inhis profile on the Power of 10 website 
<http://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=38667>. I knew he 
enjoyed his running, but I had no idea he was quite that good. His Parkrun 
(5km) PB: 18m 8sec. So he has me licked by over six minutes (no gauge of class 
in itself by the way).

Many thanks for everyone’s correspondence (seven people now) suggesting 
various Leicester City/Ranieri/Dilly Ding snooker links to tie together all of 
tonight’s potential sporting news. Much obliged, but just for the record I’ve 
had it written in a pad since about 5pm on Friday. So if it comes to it, it’s 
MINE.

Back on crap holdy-uppy things in the crowd, important thoughts from our own 
Owen Gibson, which can apply to all sports everywhere …

Mid-session interval: Selby 16-13 Ding (0-108)

Let’s be honest, 16-13 is not a lovely scoreline to be on the wrong end of in 
a first-to-18 match, but it’s a hell of a lot better than 17-12.

Ding is close to the line in this frame now. One more red …

Clack.

He visibly relaxes as the ensuing pink also goes down, reducing the 
possibility for the Selby snooker-a-tron kicking into life for the first time 
tonight.

And Ding goes into the mid-session interval with a clearance of 70. As Lenny 
Kravitz once sang, much to my annoyance …

Dunno. Looks more like a less terse Lord Kitchener to me.

I am absolutely adamant that Alan McManus has something Smurf-y about him 
though.

Paul Collier, officiating the final, shows his displeasure as another mobile 
chimes out, shattering the decorum at the table.

Ding is not to be chimed out of his composure however, and his next shot is an 
outstanding, red-developing rasper. But with his break at the 22 mark, he gets 
an unfortunate double-kiss trying to play safe off the green.

Selby has a red on – a fine-ish cut. It’s close … but misses!

Ding breathes again, and is back at the table. These are all huge moments for 
his chances now.

Cracks in the Selby armour. A badly misjudged dink on to a red finishes short, 
and leaves Ding well set once more.

But then Ding finishes short playing for the blue! Plenty of capacity for 
things to go badly wrong, but playing it round the green pocket with lots of 
side takes him back in touch with the reds. Clustered reds leaves lots of 
mileage in this frame however.

Frame 29: Selby 16-12 Ding

A phenomenal long pot from Ding to get the scoreboard moving. But the ensuing 
yellow fails to drop. Mercifully, nothing of note left for Selby.

Time for some safety, and we’re soon in tippy tappy cluster territory. A 
re-rack looked a shoo-in, until Ding leaves the cue ball touching one of the 
reds. Easy safety for Selby, playing away. But then ANOTHER touching ball after 
a well-weighted effort back down-table by Ding.

Meanwhile, this from the gorgeously named Riley Strother …

 Ahoy there,


I am following along from the Race Rocks lighthouse perched on a tiny island 
off the west coast of British Columbia! Only about 10 miles from Victoria, 
hometown of Cliff Thorburn! It’s too bad there aren’t any top Canadian players 
anymore. Not like the 80s when there were 3 or 4! Although I read somewhere 
that Marco Fu grew up in Vancouver.


Cheers,


Riley


Myself and Mrs Goodwin hit our 10-year anniversary mark next year and are 
heading Canada-wards. Don’t suppose the lighthouse offers bed and board? Sounds 
marvellous. #shamelessblaggingends

Selby 16-12 Ding (0-87)

More phone-based dickheadedness in the crowd. Just put them on silent, folks. 
Ding composes himself and sinks an awkward black. Let’s be honest, everything’s 
awkward at this stage, particularly when you’re five frames down to a player 
noted for closing matches out.

But Ding gets over the line. He needed to seal the frame to leave himself with 
more than a margin of error to play with – and he has.

Everyone’s cashing out their Ding bets. Boo. There’s life in this match yet – 
Ding’s at the table, but there’s plenty of work to do to develop some clustered 
reds. And develop them he does. Well, two of them anyway.

I’ve put it off for as long as I can. Time for The Safety Dance 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjPau5QYtYs>.

Selby’s tight on the bottom cushion, with very, very limited options to get 
the cue ball safe. He will be doing extremely well to make a shot and leave 
Ding without a red on.

Almost three minutes after Selby took the table, he tries a tap off one 
cushion into the base of the cluster. But he leaves a red on for Ding to the 
right centre pocket. It creeps in. Great drama.

Frame 28: Selby 16-Ding 11

Ding has cut a calm figure this evening but just before the crucial black in 
frame 27 his face was suddenly doused in sweat. If this match is to go much 
further he needs to rally in almost as grand a style as he managed at this time 
yesterday.

Early stages of this frame, great pot from Ding cueing from the bottom cushion 
to sink a red into the right centre. Couple of shots later, time for another 
key black to take the cue ball into the clustered reds. Strong contact, 
unfortunate outcome. Not a lot immediately on.

Selby 16-11 Ding (67-60)

Black ball needed by Selby. He’s well placed on the pink …

But he fluffs his position. He needs to cut it in from a fine angle now.

Ding towels his face as Selby lines the shot up. He makes it. It’s an 
outrageously difficult shot in any circumstances. Pros all week have been 
referring to Selby as a superb match player – that’s one reason why.

Unbelievable. His position for the penultimate red finishes a fraction of a 
ball short, and the pot isn’t on.

The safety’s just short of perfect, and Selby takes on a long red. Missed.

Ding responds with a better safety, and a harder long pot faces the world No1. 
Fortune favours him as the missed red goes safe.

Ding is 60-31 up, agonisingly short of a frame-clinching lead.

Selby eyes up a flamboyant double into the middle pocket, with the cue ball 
travelling past from baulk down to the bottom cushion and back again. He makes 
it. Frame back in Selby’s hands?

Ding’s tail is up. A brave cannon to develop two balls by the bottom cushion 
leaves all remaining reds with room the breathe. The Chinese player quickly 
takes the lead in the frame.

A great attempt to rustle the pack from distance and develop matters further 
in his favour results in a touching ball, so Selby’s contribution ends with him 
27-0 up.

Ding needs to head for the cluster off a side cushion. Attempt one stops well 
short. Attempt two taps them lightly, but Selby thinks he’s left a red on. He 
chops down on the cue ball, applying left hand side, but has midjudged the gap 
to the object ball, and strikes another in between the two. No pot, but nothing 
left for Ding to score with.

Selby then takes on a long red and misses by several inches, before the cue 
ball hammers into the cluster of reds. This is a crucial opportunity for the 
Chinese, with plenty of reds available.

Frame 27: Selby 15-11 Ding

Ding breaks, before Selby fluffs an attempt to get the cue ball back behind 
the D.

The Chinese then leaves the white tight to the baulk cushion once more. If 
he’s been rattled during this match, his safety hasn’t always shown it. A 
couple of shots later an attempted long red from Ding rattles the jaws but 
flies out, skirting with the opposite corner on its way back up the table.

It’s a longish red for Selby, but in it pops. He has the initiative again. 
When his eye’s in he’s an astonishingly clean potter.

Mark Selby clinches second world title with 18-14 win over Ding Junhui

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/02/mark-selby-world-championshp-ding-junhui> 
There’s moisture welling in Ding’s eyes as he gives dignified testimony to 
Hazel Irvine. The 6-0 deficit in the first session must have taken a huge 
emotional toil.

As for the champion? “Thank God I’ve got a decent B-game to fall back on.” 
Selby isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but he’s a fantastic match-player and a 
worthy champion.

The cheques are out. That’s £330,000 to Mark Selby, and £137,500 to Ding 
Junhui.

But the trophy is the main prize for Selby, followed by photo opportunities 
with spouse and bemused child. Ticker tape everywhere, adding a level of 
excitement to proceedings that the lack of coloured strips of paper simply 
couldn’t provide. Any problems, Crucible types,see here

Quite the night for Leicester, all told, and Selby does his Foxes bit by 
holding his team’s banner next to the trophy.

Well done Selby, commiserations to Ding Junhui. A topsy-turvy final that never 
quite started to tip fully into the Chinese player’s favour.
 
AND IT’S THERE.

Ding needs snookers, but he’s not going to get chance to make them, and he 
knows it. Handshake time.
 
Selby looks like getting home with four frames to spare.

For my part, I look like getting home with at least two trains to spare. It’s 
67-0 to Selby, with 67 left on the table. One more ball …
 
Selby’s armed with the experience of having been in this position two years 
ago, and he’s wearing the pressure extremely well. A wobbly old red aside, the 
balls are being put away cleanly.

Is this the last table visit of this year’s championship? It could be. He’s 
already 39-0 up in the frame.
 
That frame broke an awkward spell for Selby, and he looks calm and assured 
with the reds well set.

Incidentally, for those who don’t want to know what happened in tonight’s 
Premier League fixture, look away now, and try not to read the content of the 
Breaking News alert at the bottom of your browser window. At least one phone in 
the Crucible auditorium just chimed with the news, much to the annoyance of 
referee Paul Collier.

Let’s stick our collective necks out and suggest: possibly.
 
A punishing period of tactical stuff is broken by a cracking double from 
Selby, but he plays it with safety-first in mind, and rolls up behind the black 
40 ahead, with 43 left on the table.

But then Ding cracks, leaving both of the remaining reds on, and Selby is on 
to the table like a lion on a gazelle. He gets over the line, and a 51-minute 
frame goes his way. Just one more frame needed for the world No1.

It’s fair to say that Selby is getting a bit more of the rub of the old green 
at this stage. A flick off the blue elevates a good-looking safety, leaving 
Ding in big trouble. But despite the obvious nerves, more calm hands give Selby 
something to think about.

And, after a fashion, he conjures a lovely snooker, sending the ball across 
and up, leaving Ding needing to swerve the white from behind the brown.


The fella can swerve the thing, no question about it. Too much as it turns 
out, resulting in a costly seven-point foul as he strikes the black.

Attempt two is a lovely shot however, and they’re going toe-to-toe with some 
cracking safety play here.

 
Selby’s nearly home in this frame, 43-7 up, but all the reds are now safe on 
the bottom cushion. That’s better news for the world No1 than it is for Ding at 
this stage.

And Selby’s finding his range with his safety play too. Ding is 36 behind with 
just 51 on the table. Not that he’s any slouch on the safety front himself – 
he’s acquitted himself brilliantly at times in this match.

Mark Williams – two-time champion at the Crucible – is getting butterflies 
just watching …

Selby’s looking a tiny bit ruffled here. Normally these tactical passages of 
play are to his liking, but his errors are irking him.

He takes his time before addressing a long-ish red, cueing awkwardly over the 
blue. In. A phenomenal shot. But – not for the first time tonight – it’s 
followed with something a bit average. Selby aims to cannon on a red but fails 
to make contact, instead flicking off the pink, leaving the cue ball some 
distance from his next object. Which he misses by some distance.

Ding can’t capitalise though, and badly misjudges his attempted red. Selby 
back at the table, puts the red Ding leaves away, and suddenly there’s a bit of 
daylight in this frame – Selby 27-7 up.
 
Ding’s in a pickle here. The white is, unusually, touching two reds. 

He takes a seat on the cushion, cue almost vertical, and jabs tentatively down 
on to the cue ball. The white moves, but – crucially – neither of the reds 
budges. Good, calm hands.

But he leaves it touching one of the reds, and so it’s an easy safety for 
Selby, playing away. And he does more than a merely adequate job of putting the 
squeeze on Ding by tucking the white behind the brown.

Advantage Selby? Ding overhits his next effort. However, the man from 
Leicester overcooks his positional shot from an easy red. He might have to opt 
for safety once more.

 
Timely distraction from Alex Corcos …

I’ve heard it for the last time now and a mildly extensive Google search has 
yielded nothing: what is Ding’s entrance music? It sounds promising

Sadly Shazam decided to crash my phone when the players were coming out, so I 
failed to turn up an answer to this. Public hive mind – now is your time to 
shine.
 
We were due a messy passage of play – and here’s one.

Selby, again with extensions to extensions at hand, fails to sink a 
regulation-looking pot and he’s back in his seat 6-7 down in the frame, with 
safety-friendly reds everywhere. For those who don’t like the tactical side of 
this sport, look away now.
 
One-nil, to the Mark-Selby.

Lovely plant from the Leicester man, making it work between two balls sitting 
some distance apart.

Then he nestles behind the yellow to give Ding something to think about. A 
delicate dink off the side cushion looks like limiting the damage, but there’s 
a red on to the left middle …

Selby thinks better of it, and goes safe again. Good choice, because Ding 
ballses his next shot up quite badly. White in mid-table, red winking at the 
bottom right corner alluringly – seemingly a regulation pot for Selby. But he 
misses. It’s a huge, huge let-off for Ding.

But he can’t capitalise, and only gets seven points on the board before 
missing a lengthy blue with the rest. Selby’s back in.
 
None of this tightly clustered pack nonsense this time around. Ding splits 
them up good and early. Ordinarily this would be good news for any decent pro, 
but it also means any missed red could be the last shot of the frame.

Some good safety play from both men here – no balls down yet.

I might have made a mistake by referencing banners incidentally. A fair bit of 
correspondence of differing quality on this subject. We’re all about the little 
guy here at the Guardian though, so here’s this from Ian, presumably, one of
those Clapton Ultras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/10/clapton-ultras-anti-fascist-essex-senior-league-football>
 …

 Enjoying your coverage this evening. Ultras banners are always on the large 
size – some as big as a snooker table. No A4 at Clapton. Ian.


And I thought some of my links were tenuous.
 
Shot of the evening – a ridiculous, thinly cut red, leaving the white 
careering horizontally several times. That brings up 98 for Ding. Then it’s a 
formality to get over the century mark to 103. With three figures on the board 
however, he immediately dumps out, so no clearance this time.

But those paying attention may note that he’s creeping ever-closer to Selby 
now.

 
Premier League, sch-memier league 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/02/chelsea-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live>
. All the cool kids are over this way.

Ding’s break crosses the half-century mark. He’s not exactly got the ball on a 
string, as TV’s finest like to put it, but is working hard to make this visit 
count.

One more charge into the pack needed to free up some more options of a crimson 
bent – bootiful. And he’s 65 ahead, with 75 still on the table. Then 66 ahead 
with an easy black to leave Selby needing to do his snooker-y thing. But I 
smell a century.
 
Or not. A lovely long red from Ding. 16-14 has a nice ring to it for a plucky 
upstart. There’s a long way to go before that though – a Hobbit’s-handful of 
reds (to my mind, three) are available before further development is required.

This is calm and assured stuff under the circumstances. He’s 28 up, but a 
thwack into the bunch leaves a tricky red to the right centre. Suddenly he’s 
35-0 up with lots to play with.
 
Selby to break after the mid-session interval. Tidy enough. Ding sends the cue 
ball back towards the green pocket, flirts with it suggestively, and leaves 
Selby with an awkward safety. The world No1 clips the object red far too thin, 
but the cue ball, between mid-table and baulk, has the blue between it and 
anything meaningful.

His next safety is much better, and although Ding gets the white back up the 
table, Selby has a chance. No dice. But he plays it as a shot to nothing with 
enough weight to get tightish to the top cushion. We might have a few minutes 
of this.
 
Bit of live-blogging housekeeping from eight days ago while I have a sec …

In Lawrence Ostlere’s mile-by-mile coverage of the London Marathon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/apr/24/london-marathon-2016-live>, 
he plugged in tweets from me giving sporadic from-the-roadside updates of the 
Guardian Sport entrants. We had Owen Gibson > Sachin Nakrani > Steve McMillan 
in the opening stages, which remained true until the boy Nakrani blew a gasket 
in the latter half, allowing the hobbled McMillan to romp on through.

Unfortunately, what I failed to acknowledge is that the whippet-like youngling 
Alan Smith, also of this parish, was also in the race. And he beat the lot of 
them, with a fine time of 3hrs 15m 13sec. So belated congrats Alan.

ATTEMPTED SEGUE: a while back Alan noted that he once took part in a race up 
against one Ronnie O’Sullivan. Intriguingly, some of Ronnie times can be found 
inhis profile on the Power of 10 website 
<http://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=38667>. I knew he 
enjoyed his running, but I had no idea he was quite that good. His Parkrun 
(5km) PB: 18m 8sec. So he has me licked by over six minutes (no gauge of class 
in itself by the way).
 
Many thanks for everyone’s correspondence (seven people now) suggesting 
various Leicester City/Ranieri/Dilly Ding snooker links to tie together all of 
tonight’s potential sporting news. Much obliged, but just for the record I’ve 
had it written in a pad since about 5pm on Friday. So if it comes to it, it’s 
MINE.

Back on crap holdy-uppy things in the crowd, important thoughts from our own 
Owen Gibson, which can apply to all sports everywhere …

Let’s be honest, 16-13 is not a lovely scoreline to be on the wrong end of in 
a first-to-18 match, but it’s a hell of a lot better than 17-12.

Ding is close to the line in this frame now. One more red …

Clack.

He visibly relaxes as the ensuing pink also goes down, reducing the 
possibility for the Selby snooker-a-tron kicking into life for the first time 
tonight.

And Ding goes into the mid-session interval with a clearance of 70. As Lenny 
Kravitz once sang, much to my annoyance …

Dunno. Looks more like a less terse Lord Kitchener to me.

I am absolutely adamant that Alan McManus has something Smurf-y about him 
though.
 
Paul Collier, officiating the final, shows his displeasure as another mobile 
chimes out, shattering the decorum at the table.

Ding is not to be chimed out of his composure however, and his next shot is an 
outstanding, red-developing rasper. But with his break at the 22 mark, he gets 
an unfortunate double-kiss trying to play safe off the green.

Selby has a red on – a fine-ish cut. It’s close … but misses!

Ding breathes again, and is back at the table. These are all huge moments for 
his chances now.
 
Cracks in the Selby armour. A badly misjudged dink on to a red finishes short, 
and leaves Ding well set once more.

But then Ding finishes short playing for the blue! Plenty of capacity for 
things to go badly wrong, but playing it round the green pocket with lots of 
side takes him back in touch with the reds. Clustered reds leaves lots of 
mileage in this frame however.

A phenomenal long pot from Ding to get the scoreboard moving. But the ensuing 
yellow fails to drop. Mercifully, nothing of note left for Selby.

Time for some safety, and we’re soon in tippy tappy cluster territory. A 
re-rack looked a shoo-in, until Ding leaves the cue ball touching one of the 
reds. Easy safety for Selby, playing away. But then ANOTHER touching ball after 
a well-weighted effort back down-table by Ding.
 
Meanwhile, this from the gorgeously named Riley Strother …

 Ahoy there,


I am following along from the Race Rocks lighthouse perched on a tiny island 
off the west coast of British Columbia! Only about 10 miles from Victoria, 
hometown of Cliff Thorburn! It’s too bad there aren’t any top Canadian players 
anymore. Not like the 80s when there were 3 or 4! Although I read somewhere 
that Marco Fu grew up in Vancouver.


Cheers,


Riley


Myself and Mrs Goodwin hit our 10-year anniversary mark next year and are 
heading Canada-wards. Don’t suppose the lighthouse offers bed and board? Sounds 
marvellous. #shamelessblaggingends
 
More phone-based dickheadedness in the crowd. Just put them on silent, folks. 
Ding composes himself and sinks an awkward black. Let’s be honest, everything’s 
awkward at this stage, particularly when you’re five frames down to a player 
noted for closing matches out.

But Ding gets over the line. He needed to seal the frame to leave himself with 
more than a margin of error to play with – and he has.
 
Everyone’s cashing out their Ding bets. Boo. There’s life in this match yet – 
Ding’s at the table, but there’s plenty of work to do to develop some clustered 
reds. And develop them he does. Well, two of them anyway.

I’ve put it off for as long as I can. Time for The Safety Dance 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjPau5QYtYs>.

Selby’s tight on the bottom cushion, with very, very limited options to get 
the cue ball safe. He will be doing extremely well to make a shot and leave 
Ding without a red on.

Almost three minutes after Selby took the table, he tries a tap off one 
cushion into the base of the cluster. But he leaves a red on for Ding to the 
right centre pocket. It creeps in. Great drama.
 
Ding has cut a calm figure this evening but just before the crucial black in 
frame 27 his face was suddenly doused in sweat. If this match is to go much 
further he needs to rally in almost as grand a style as he managed at this time 
yesterday.

Early stages of this frame, great pot from Ding cueing from the bottom cushion 
to sink a red into the right centre. Couple of shots later, time for another 
key black to take the cue ball into the clustered reds. Strong contact, 
unfortunate outcome. Not a lot immediately on.
 
Black ball needed by Selby. He’s well placed on the pink …

But he fluffs his position. He needs to cut it in from a fine angle now.

Ding towels his face as Selby lines the shot up. He makes it. It’s an 
outrageously difficult shot in any circumstances. Pros all week have been 
referring to Selby as a superb match player – that’s one reason why.
 
Unbelievable. His position for the penultimate red finishes a fraction of a 
ball short, and the pot isn’t on.

The safety’s just short of perfect, and Selby takes on a long red. Missed.

Ding responds with a better safety, and a harder long pot faces the world No1. 
Fortune favours him as the missed red goes safe.

Ding is 60-31 up, agonisingly short of a frame-clinching lead.

Selby eyes up a flamboyant double into the middle pocket, with the cue ball 
travelling past from baulk down to the bottom cushion and back again. He makes 
it. Frame back in Selby’s hands?
 
Ding’s tail is up. A brave cannon to develop two balls by the bottom cushion 
leaves all remaining reds with room the breathe. The Chinese player quickly 
takes the lead in the frame.
 
A great attempt to rustle the pack from distance and develop matters further 
in his favour results in a touching ball, so Selby’s contribution ends with him 
27-0 up.

Ding needs to head for the cluster off a side cushion. Attempt one stops well 
short. Attempt two taps them lightly, but Selby thinks he’s left a red on. He 
chops down on the cue ball, applying left hand side, but has midjudged the gap 
to the object ball, and strikes another in between the two. No pot, but nothing 
left for Ding to score with.

Selby then takes on a long red and misses by several inches, before the cue 
ball hammers into the cluster of reds. This is a crucial opportunity for the 
Chinese, with plenty of reds available.
 
Last year’s losing finalist laments …

Ding breaks, before Selby fluffs an attempt to get the cue ball back behind 
the D.

The Chinese then leaves the white tight to the baulk cushion once more. If 
he’s been rattled during this match, his safety hasn’t always shown it. A 
couple of shots later an attempted long red from Ding rattles the jaws but 
flies out, skirting with the opposite corner on its way back up the table.

It’s a longish red for Selby, but in it pops. He has the initiative again. 
When his eye’s in he’s an astonishingly clean potter.
