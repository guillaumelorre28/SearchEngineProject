zeugma
A figure of speech in which, typically, a single verb is used to yoke together 
two or more parts of a sentence with different meanings. Some examples:
“The queen takes counsel and tea” (Pope).
“Mr Pickwick took his hat and his leave” (Dickens).
And more recently:
“The following year, in Sing Your Worries Away, she played a stripper, taking 
off her clothes and her sister.”
(Ronald Bergan, in a 2010 Guardian obituary of June Havoc, Gypsy Rose Lee’s 
sister)

zhoosh
an example of gay slang (see Polari 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-p#polari>), used in 
the fashion industry and on US television shows such as Will and Grace and 
Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, it has various shades of meaning: (noun) 
clothing, ornamentation; (verb) zhoosh your hair, zhoosh yourself up

zhooshy
showy

Zhu Rongji

Wen Jiabao

Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali

Zionist
refers to someone who believes in the right for a Jewish national home to 
exist within historic Palestine; someone who wants the borders of that entity 
to be expanded is not an “ultra-Zionist” but might be described as a hardliner, 
hawk or rightwinger.

You can be a leftwing Zionist, a rightwing Zionist, a secular Zionist or a 
religious Zionist – the word should, therefore, be used with great care.

This headline, which appeared in the paper, was misleading and inaccurate: 
“Mutiny fear in Israeli army as Zionists gain influence”. The online version 
was much better: “Mutiny fear in Israeli army as religious Zionists gain 
influence”

Z, Jay
has dropped the hyphen, so it’s Jay Z, not Jay-Z
