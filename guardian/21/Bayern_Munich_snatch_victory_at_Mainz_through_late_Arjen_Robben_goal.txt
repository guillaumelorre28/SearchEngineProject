Arjen Robben’s last-minute goal gave Bayern Munich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> a 2-1 victory at Mainz on 
Friday to set a Bundesliga record for points at the halfway stage of the season.

Robben was left free to convert Juan Bernat’s cross from close range after 
Mainz lost the ball in midfield, giving Bayern 45 points from 17 games to beat 
the club’s own mark of 44 at the halfway stage of the 2005-06 season.

It was a cruel defeat on Mainz after a commendable performance. The home side 
opened the scoring through Elkin Soto in the 21st minute. It was only the 
fourth goal that Bayern have conceded all season, which is also aBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> record at the halfway 
stage.

Bastian Schweinsteiger equalised three minutes later with a brilliant 
free-kick in off the top of the left post.
