It will also keep the French goalkeeper out of this Sunday’s FA Cup 
fifth-round tie at home to Crystal Palace.

The Spurs manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has full faith in reserve keeper 
Michel Vorm, but admits not having his captain will have an effect.

“It is not a big, big issue,” he said. “It is a very small injury. It will 
always impact. Hugo is our captain and it is a very important period for us but 
how it is important, we know now we have a squad and we believe that Michel is 
a very good, top goalkeeper too, and we believe in him and trust in him. It is 
true it is a big impact but in one week we expect and hope he is available to 
start to play again.”

Lloris picked up the injury turning away a Sergio Agüero cross deep into the 
2-1 win at City on Sunday, which left Tottenham second in the Premier League.

Pochettino added: “The last action of the game against Manchester City, Hugo 
hurt his shoulder and he is out for tomorrow and for Sunday too. We need to 
assess him during the week if he can be available for next Thursday but for 
sure, tomorrow and next Sunday he is out.”

With a Premier League title tilt in full swing, Tottenham could be forgiven 
for taking an eye off theirEuropa League

when they were knocked out by Fiorentina at the same stage last year.

Then they were just three days from a Capital One Cup final against Chelsea, 
but this time Pochettino insists he will maintain his stance on wanting to win 
in Europe.

“For us it is important, too,” he said. “I can understand, because our 
position in the table it is a very big opportunity to fight for the Premier 
League but, for me, when you’re in a big club like Tottenham you need to fight 
in every competition and every game.

“I don’t think too much into the future. The most important game is tomorrow 
and the Premier League can wait for a few weeks. When you manage Tottenham, you 
need to try and win every competition and every game.”

12 months ago but Pochettino is expecting a different tie this season, with 
their hosts sitting third in Serie A.

“Last season was very different, some different players and we are in a 
different period now,” he said. “Fiorentina are the same because they have a 
different coach and different players, too. It is a very different team to last 
season, a different game completely.

“My attitude was to try and win the game last year and tomorrow it is the 
same. It is a very important competition for us, we have a strong squad.”

The Argentinian also agreed with Fiorentina’s coach Paulo Sousa, who said the 
game had the feel of a Champions League meeting.

“I agree with Paulo,” Pochettino said. “The characteristics and the level we 
show in the Premier League and the level of Fiorentina in the Serie A, both 
teams have a lot of quality and good players. I agree with him, we need to work 
very hard to play again next season but in the Champions League against
Fiorentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina>.”
