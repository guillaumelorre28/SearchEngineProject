Police say rapper Soulja Boy <https://www.theguardian.com/music/soulja-boy> 
was charged with obstruction after telling officers that people gathered at an 
abandoned Georgia house were shooting a music video.

Jason Bolton, Henry county police captain, said today that when officers 
arrived Wednesday night to investigate complaints, almost half of the 40 people 
assembled fled by foot. Later, a man identified as DeAndre Cortez Way, Soulja 
Boy's real name, returned and said the group was shooting a video.

The 19-year-old was charged with obstruction and bonded out of the Henry 
county jail yesterday. A telephone call to his publicist was not immediately 
returned.

The rapper started an internet dance craze several years ago with the hit 
Crank That (Soulja Boy). More recent hits include Kiss Me Thru the Phone.
