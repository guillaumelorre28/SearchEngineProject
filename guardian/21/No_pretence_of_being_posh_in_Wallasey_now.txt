I was born in Liverpool but have lived now for 35 years in Wallasey. I have 
had to endure, during that time, the boring accusation that I have moved over 
to the “posh side”. I have always protested that, while Wallasey is extremely 
pleasant, it has no pretensions to being “posh”. But thanks to Ewen MacAskill’s 
description of the town as “home to dockers and their families in its heyday 
but now suffering from decades of unemployment and neglect” (The long read 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/sep/22/labour-and-liverpool-the-city-that-reveals-cracks-in-party>
, 22 September), I don’t think I will ever have to protest again.

• Peter Geall (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/21/misunderstandings-and-mistakes-on-immigration-to-britain>
, 22 September) says “the exclusive use of non-English signs and labels should 
be banned”. He describes the use of such signage as “discourteous and 
alienating to the native population”. He ought to be Welsh. We have suffered 
generations of the swamping of our language by “discourteous and alienating” 
English speakers. The “stupidity” of monolingual English signage in Wales has 
done a very effective job of sublimating the cultural jewel of our language. O 
bydded i’r hen iaith barhau!

• I was intrigued to read that the new Ukip leader lists Winston Churchill as 
a political hero (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/new-ukip-leader-says-she-counts-vladimir-putin-as-a-political-hero>
, 19 September). I presume that she is familiar with his speech in Zurich in 
1946 in which he called for a United States of Europe. This famous speech is so 
relevant today, it would be worth printing in full.

• On our return to our local authority adult education French conversation 
class after the summer break we have learned that our teacher is now required 
to “embed British values” into each of our lessons. How? Why? And why does this 
seem deeply disturbing?

• Liz Fuller (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/21/helpful-hand-gestures-may-improve-others-driving>
, 22 September) says she is probably too old to know what “flava” is. I have 
the same problem, and it is not in my dictionary. But it is online.
