Lyon have confirmed that they rejected an offer from Tottenham for their 
goalkeeper Hugo Lloris this summer, while the agent of Gastón Ramírez has 
claimed the north London club have bid for theBologna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bologna> forward.

Spurs' current No1, Brad Friedel, turned 41 in May and the France keeper 
Lloris, 25, would provide André Villas-Boas with a much younger alternative.

"Hugo wants to play at one of the best clubs in Europe," the Lyon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lyon> chairman, Jean-Michel Aulas, told 
the French radio station RMC. "This year there was an approach from Tottenham 
that was quickly rejected. If he absolutely wants to leave, we will look at the 
proposals but they must be consistent with what we want. If not, he will stay."

Spurs have also made an offer for Ramírez, according to the Bologna forward's 
agent.

"The only solid offer is the one from Tottenham, who offered €16m [£12.6m]," 
Oscar Betancourt told Calciomercato. "But the deal didn't go through because 
Spurs offered too low a wage to the player and if the wage difference is 
minimal he would stay at Bologna.

"Tottenham could raise their offer if they sell Modric and in that case the 
deal could be done, otherwise Ramírez will stay another year at Bologna. We 
also talked with Liverpool but nothing more."
