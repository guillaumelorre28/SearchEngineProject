Mark King claimed his first ranking title as a professional with a thrilling 
9-8 victory over Barry Hawkins at the Northern Ireland Open.

Hawkins raced into a 5-1 lead after breaks of 83 and 113 but King, who was 
playing his first ranking final since the 2004 Irish Masters, responded with 
breaks of 48 and 42 to cut the deficit to two frames at the end of the first 
session.

King, who had never won a ranking title in 25 years as a professional, reeled 
off another four frames, including breaks of 62, 100 and 54, to lead 7-5. 
Hawkins, however, fought back to draw level with breaks of 73 and 76.

A stroke of luck led King to snatch the 15th frame and lead 8-7. The 
42-year-old then forced a black ball re-spot in the 16th but missed the chance 
to seal the title, allowing Hawkins to force a decider.

However, the Romford potter made no mistake in the final frame to claim the 
Alex Higgins Trophy and £70,000 first prize.

In the semi-finals King had beaten Kyren Wilson, who had knocked out Ronnie 
O’Sullivan in the last 16.
