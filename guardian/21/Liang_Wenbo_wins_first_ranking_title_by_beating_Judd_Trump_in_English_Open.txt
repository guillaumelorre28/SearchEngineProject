The Chinese left-hander became the fourth Asian player to win a ranking title 
after James Wattana, Ding Junhui and Marco Fu.

Liang was 5-3 ahead from the afternoon session but Trump – who was aiming for 
back-to-back ranking event victories after winning the European Masters – 
responded with a break of 132 in the first frame of the evening.

Breaks of 84 and 98 resulted in Liang extending his lead and, although Trump 
fought back to win the next two and trail 7-6, the 29-year-old from Zhaodong 
took the 14th frame with a 62 clearance.

An emotional Liang, who turned professional in 2005, closed out victory in a 
tight final frame after he potted the last red down the cushion and cleared the 
colours.
