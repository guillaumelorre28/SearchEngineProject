The EU may be agreed on its response to Britain’s vote to leave, but on one 
key question it remains divided: is Brexit masculine or feminine?

In French, Britain’s decision to leave the European Union is known as le 
Brexit,either – although the Académie Française has yet to rule on the question 
– because new words in French are almost invariably masculine, or becausenouns 
ending in “t” <http://www.languageguide.org/french/grammar/gender/mep1.html> 
mostly are (with a few exceptions:la nuit, la forêt, la plupart).

Germany, also, appears to have pretty much decided that der Brexit is a male 
thing. This might seem oddsince several German nouns ending in “it” 
<https://jakubmarian.com/how-to-recognize-gender-in-german-using-endings/> (das 
Fazit, meaning conclusion, das Dynamit, dynamite) are neither masculine nor 
feminine, but neuter.

But as any German learner knows, what makes a noun feminine, masculine or 
neuter in German is somewhat less clear than in Latin languages.Der Brexit may 
be inspired – perhaps unwisely – by the equally masculineder Profit, or more 
likely by the fact that the German word for exit,der Austritt, is masculine.

Spain, too, has plumped for el Brexit, like most English loan words that 
become masculine by default in Spanish. That’s because they rarely end in “o” 
(generally masculine) or “a” (generally feminine) like most Spanish nouns, and 
given the choice, Spain, being a Latin country, opts for male.

Italy, for the time being at least, is resisting the trend – and its language 
police, the Accademia della Crusca,has published a fabulously lengthy 
explanation as to why 
<http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/genere-brexit>
. Debating whether Italians should say plainBrexit (without a preceding 
article),il Brexit or la Brexit, the academy finds firmly in favour of the last.

“It seems preferable to make Brexit feminine,” it said, “since etymologically, 
the componentexit has a corresponding Italian noun, ‘uscita’”, which is 
feminine. Moreover, it adds, use of a preceding article would be in line with 
other loan words describing “real or hypothetical events ... indicating complex 
scenarios”, such asla perestrojka and il global warming.

As with most things in Europe, France and Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>, once agreed, are likely to end up 
on the winning side in the Brexit gender war, as the former Labour Europe 
minister Denis MacShane observed in a tweet. Britain, for its part, will 
doubtless hope for more disunity once the real Brexit battle starts.
