Oh no, the vest is back. The vest, beloved of Mr Muscle, the angry-looking guy 
whose natural habitat is the local GNC shop and Vin Diesel. For years its 
wearability has been questionable, partly thanks to its unseemly moniker (the 
“wife beater”. Great name, guys) but also because it’s basically unwearable 
unless you were carved out of marble by Michelangelo. Or at least look like it.

The celebrities who are wearing it are not slim jims (Kit Harington

, Justin Theroux,Jason Momoa <https://www.instagram.com/p/BIj2l1uB7g-/> and, 
infamously,Tom Hiddleston

) but they are plentiful. It’s become the #humblebrag top that speaks to a 
Insta-graphic world, where the bearing of a muscular, tattoo-filled upper arm 
is a powerful currency.

On the catwalk, the vest has appeared in various forms: Gucci went all Jarvis 
Cocker with their knitted graphic tank top featuring some sort of magical hare 
riding atop a demonic whippet, Gosha Rubchinskiy’s athleisure one referenced 
Olympics gymnasts with its three stripes, and Sibling’s floral mesh one.

On the screen it has appeared as a staple of 70s referencing in Everybody 
Wants Some!! and Jaden Smith in The Get Down. The subtext is clear: it’s the 
new T-shirt.

But even though some of us would like to believe that, it’s difficult to 
envision a situation where it will become a mass staple. Wearing a vest on a 
normal body feels like a vulnerable exposure: you need a mix of machismo and 
upper-body confidence off to carry the look off. Unless you style it like Gucci 
has done, layering it over a shirt and channelling your inner mathlete.

For us mere mortals who are not familiar with any products containing whey 
protein, perhaps it’s time to put the tank top back on the shelf and leave it 
to the big guns. And the guys with the big guns.
