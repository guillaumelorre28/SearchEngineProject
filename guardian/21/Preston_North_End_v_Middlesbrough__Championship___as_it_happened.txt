We said that Boro were probably lacking in attacking options before the match, 
and this game will only harden Karanka’s desire to bring in another striker. 
But the game was decided in the middle of the pitch, with Welsh and Johnson 
relentlessly closing down the space – Downing wasn’t afforded the chance to 
make his mark on the game.

Chances were missed: Garner and Wright for Preston, Leadbitter and Adomah for 
Boro, but the draw is a fair result.


Thanks for reading, see you next time.

Full-time: Preston North End 0-0 Middlesbrough

Not the point that Boro wanted, but they didn’t deserve anything more. Preston 
do not look out of the depth at this level.

90+3 min: A little break in play with Adomah picking up a knock. The local 
sponsors have given John Welsh the man-of-the-match award. That’s probably 
about right, he’s been a terrier, and largely stifled Boro’s attacking play.

90 min: Chance for Garner, but he’s blown it! Cunningham delivers a cross from 
deep that catches Friend flat-footed. Garner is perhaps a yard off-side but 
it’s not flagged and he nods wide from five yards out! Crucial miss!

89 min: What a block from Clarke! Downing curls a ball towards Stuani at the 
back post, which is headed out only as far as Adomah on the edge of the area. 
He takes a touch, steadies himself and unleashes a piledriver but both Clarke 
and Huntington throw themselves at it. Brave stuff.

85 min: Another Gallagher set-piece, another wild effort on goal. This time 
it’s Garner who heads harmlessly over.

83 min: Preston make their second change: Keane coming off for Hugill. Keane 
has done an awful lot of running today, but save for his shot that was cleared 
off the line, hasn’t threatened Boro’s goal.

81 min: Downing finds some space in the middle of the pitch, drives towards 
goal and unleashes a fierce right-footed drive which goes maybe a couple of 
yards over the bar. He’s very one-footed, Downing, but can score with his 
right; for example at Stoke last season for West Ham. Here’s some terrible 
footage of the goal, excellent footage of fans going mental.

conducting much of the play from a deep-lying position.

69 min: Fabbrini has indeed brought this game back to life! He’s playing more 
central now with Downing out on the left. Fabbrini escapes a wild lunge from 
Welsh to break into a rare pocket of space, and slips a lovely ball inside the 
Preston full-back to Adomah. The winger is clean through on goal but tries to 
round the keeper when he might have shot, and the backtracking Welsh is able to 
clear!

59 min: The quality is poor, to be honest. Nothing is happening. Boro are 
getting ready for their first change: Fabbrini, on loan from Watford is coming 
on for Reach. Let’s hope the Italian can inject some life into this game.

51 min: What a miss from Ayala! From the corner, he heads a good 10 yards over 
the bar despite having a free header on the edge of the six-yard box. Terrible 
effort, he completely mis-timed his jump and didn’t get over it.

fight to his opposite man on the right flank. He works half a yard and whips a 
cross to the near post, where Kike is just beaten to the ball by Huntington, 
who heads behind for a corner.

Here is some more information on Gary Parkinson, the former Preston and Boro 
player in attendance today that suffers from locked-in syndrome.

Despite being fully-paralysed, Parkinson was hired as a scout by Boro in 2011. 
He would review players on DVD and then communicate his thoughts by blinking to 
his wife, who would then pass on the information to then-manager Tony Mowbray.

“When Tony first came to see Gary, he could see Gary was still aware of 
everything that was going on around him. So he asked Gary if he wanted to do 
some scouting for him,” Deborah said in 2011.

“A DVD comes down to us, with a sheet of paper. There is a description of the 
player, his name, his age, his position and the clubs he has played for.”

Quite remarkable.
Gary Parkinson Trust (@GaryParkyTrust) 
Delighted to confirm that Gary will be at Deepdale on Sunday to see his two 
former teams@pnefc <https://twitter.com/pnefc> and @Boro

Half-time: Preston North End 0-0 Middlesbrough

Poor first half from Boro. Save for that glorious Leadbitter chance early on, 
they haven’t threatened at all. We said that they looked a little light in 
attack this season, and that definitely showed this first period.

43 min: Vermijl chucks a long throw deep into the Boro box, and 
Konstantopoulos again fails to deal with it, on his own line he can only touch 
the high throw down, and is lucky that no Preston player is on hand to stab the 
ball in.

40 min: Garner is again brought down. Free-kick, and an ironic cheer goes up 
around Deepdale. There is the feeling that Preston have been on the wrong end 
of a few decisions this half.

37 min: The game is hotting up, with Garner inevitably in the throng of the 
action. He becomes sandwiched between Clayton and Ayala, and the three struggle 
for a good few seconds, as they try to untangle their limbs. Did Clayton stamp 
on Garner there? It certainly looks like he did.

35 min: Johnson, a man with some of the finest dreadlocks you are ever likely 
to see, is impressing for Preston this first half, showing a few deft touches. 
He drives into the area, and lays the ball back for Vermijl, but the Belgian 
completely slices it wide with his weaker left foot.

32 min: Clarke is booked for hacking down Friend. The Preston captain comes 
off a little worse, that looked like a nasty clash of shins. The free-kick is 
pumped into the box by Downing, but Ayala is penalised for grabbing Huntington 
by the neck.

29 min: Another mistake from Konstantopoulos gifts Preston another chance: 
this time he fumbles a cross from the left, and Garner pounces, attempting to 
lift the ball over the scrambling keeper, but it’s blocked. For all their 
possession, Boro are lucky not to be at least 1-0 down here.

28 min: Friend clears off the line! From the resulting free-kick, 
Konstantopoulos flaps at the cross, and the ball drops to Keane just beyond the 
penalty spot. He shoots low through a crowd of bodies, but Friend is just able 
to stab it clear, one yard off his own line. Saved a certain goal!

ball back. He passes to Garner, who is unceremoniously chopped down by the 
frustrated Adomah. Garner is really in the wars at the moment.

24 min: Garner is at it again, this time out-jumping Friend, with the two 
players landing in a heap on the floor. Garner is only 5ft8in remember, he’s 
got a remarkable leap, and scored plenty of headers last season in League One.

22 min: Garner and Ayala clash, the latter giving the Preston striker a little 
bump on the head with his elbow. It’s not violent, but Garner is understandably 
not happy. They exchange words, the referee Chris Kavanagh calms things down. 
No bookings.

15 min: What a run from George Friend. He dribbles the ball unchallenged from 
the edge of his own box to the edge of Preston’s, ghosting past Vermijl then 
Walsh, the Huntington. But instead of going for goal, he tries to pass to Kike 
and it is well intercepted by the covering Wright. That was a lung-busting run, 
he was probably too tired to shoot!

11 min: If Wright’s miss was bad, this is worse from Leadbitter. He is furious 
with himself! Boro’s captain played a clever one-two with Kike, dropped his 
shoulder to leave Huntington on his backside, and under no pressure whatsoever, 
flashed his shot wide from 10 yards out.

9 min: Chance for Preston’s Wright! Oh, he should do so much better. Gallagher 
is again over a set piece, and this time delivers a beauty to the near post – 
Wright completely loses his man and has a free run at the cross, but mis-times 
his header and the effort dribbles wide.

7 min: There is a round of applause from both sets of supporters for Gary 
Parkinson, a player formerly of both Preston and Boro, who suffers from 
locked-in syndrome. Parkinson is in attendance in the stands today. Nice touch, 
that.

4 min: And what a way for Fry to introduce himself to Joe Garner, whacking him 
flush on the face with a high boot. Ouch. Free-kick to Preston, but Gallagher 
wastes it, punting it too long.

2 min: It’s a very pedestrian start with Boro’s defence, popping it about 
without much pressure. At the heart of that defence today is 17-year-old Dael 
Fry, making his full debut, who replaces the injured Ben Gibson. Big day for 
the youngster.

Preston have released their playlist for today’s match. I assume that this is 
what they will blare out around the stadium, rather than in the dressing 
room/players’ headphones. But you never know.

Note Simon Grayson’s choice – Mr Brightside by The Killers 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE> – and the final song in the ‘Peak 
run-up’: Can’t Help Falling in Love, by UB40.

As my colleague Tom Bryant points out, not sure how ‘Living on a Prayer’ is 
supposed to inspire the Preston team/supporters …

Here’s what Karanka had to say prior to today’s game:

We are more mature now, more experienced, better and stronger now than last 
season. When I saw the first training session I knew they were ready. The 
expectations on us this season are a lot higher. 18 months ago we were close to 
the relegation position and last season were nearly went up, so everyone 
expects us to do even better this time. I haven’t got the squad I want just 
yet, but already we are stronger than we were last season.

Preamble

The last time Preston were promoted to the second tier (in 2000/01), they had 
a formidable strike-force, with the club reaching the play-off final. Jon 
Macken top-scored with 22 league goals, but he was well supported by a 
combination of David Healy, Richard Cresswell, and Brian McBride, on loan from 
Columbus Crew. Names that are enough to send a shiver down the spine of any 
defence, especially when they are led by player-manager David Moyes.

Last season at Preston, Joe Garner and Jermaine Beckford were arguably the 
most best forward partnership in the league. Garner won the league’s golden 
boot with 25 goals, and after a sluggish start, Beckford scored 15 goals in 23 
league (and play-off) games, including a hat-trick at Wembley in the 4-0 
play-off final victory over Swindon. Both have playedChampionship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> football, with varying 
success, but all eyes will be on whether they can continue last season’s form 
into this.

Middlesbrough’s own play-off story played out a little differently in May, as 
failed to overcome Norwich and reach the Premier League. They remain among the 
promotion favourites and have an excellent squad – hello Stuart Downing! – with 
their excellent manager, Aitor Karanka, recently penning a new four-year 
contract. However, much of their summer has also been focused on their 
strike-force, or a lack of one. Patrick Bamford – last season’s on-loan golden 
boy – and Lee Tomlin have departed and Boro’s attempts to replace them haven’t 
really materialised, with a £12m (!!!) bid for Jordan Rhodes rejected by 
Blackburn. Cristhian Stuani has joined from Espanyol, but they look a little 
light up top.

It’s all set up for a little upset today at Deepdale. Preston for a 2-1 win 
anyone? Get your predictions, for both this game and the season as a whole, in

close  
We said that Boro were probably lacking in attacking options before the match, 
and this game will only harden Karanka’s desire to bring in another striker. 
But the game was decided in the middle of the pitch, with Welsh and Johnson 
relentlessly closing down the space – Downing wasn’t afforded the chance to 
make his mark on the game.

Chances were missed: Garner and Wright for Preston, Leadbitter and Adomah for 
Boro, but the draw is a fair result.


Thanks for reading, see you next time.

Not the point that Boro wanted, but they didn’t deserve anything more. Preston 
do not look out of the depth at this level.
 
90+3 min: A little break in play with Adomah picking up a knock. The local 
sponsors have given John Welsh the man-of-the-match award. That’s probably 
about right, he’s been a terrier, and largely stifled Boro’s attacking play.
 
90+1 min: Four minutes added on here for injury time. 
 
90 min: Chance for Garner, but he’s blown it! Cunningham delivers a cross from 
deep that catches Friend flat-footed. Garner is perhaps a yard off-side but 
it’s not flagged and he nods wide from five yards out! Crucial miss!
 
89 min: What a block from Clarke! Downing curls a ball towards Stuani at the 
back post, which is headed out only as far as Adomah on the edge of the area. 
He takes a touch, steadies himself and unleashes a piledriver but both Clarke 
and Huntington throw themselves at it. Brave stuff.
 
87 min: Another Boro sub, Forshaw coming on for Leadbitter. 
 
85 min: Another Gallagher set-piece, another wild effort on goal. This time 
it’s Garner who heads harmlessly over.
 
83 min: Preston make their second change: Keane coming off for Hugill. Keane 
has done an awful lot of running today, but save for his shot that was cleared 
off the line, hasn’t threatened Boro’s goal.
 
81 min: Downing finds some space in the middle of the pitch, drives towards 
goal and unleashes a fierce right-footed drive which goes maybe a couple of 
yards over the bar. He’s very one-footed, Downing, but can score with his 
right; for example at Stoke last season for West Ham. Here’s some terrible 
footage of the goal, excellent footage of fans going mental.
 
79 min: Cunningham is applauded for booting a cross into the stands. I’m not 
entirely sure why. That was rubbish.
 
77 min: Preston also make a change, with Vermijl replaced by Humphrey.
 
76 min: Turns out, he’s on his way off the pitch. Kike off, Stuani on, to make 
his competitive debut for the club.
 
75 min: Fabbrini drives down the left and crosses, but there is not one Boro 
player in the box. Where is Kike?
 
73 min: Riot! Riot Riot! First Clayton sends Keane flying. Cunningham puts 
Kike on his bum. Then Leadbitter Leadbitters Cunningham. Some textbook handbags 
ensue. Nobody is booked. Lenient.
 
71 min: Boro are definitely the stronger at the moment, with Leadbitter 
conducting much of the play from a deep-lying position.
 
69 min: Fabbrini has indeed brought this game back to life! He’s playing more 
central now with Downing out on the left. Fabbrini escapes a wild lunge from 
Welsh to break into a rare pocket of space, and slips a lovely ball inside the 
Preston full-back to Adomah. The winger is clean through on goal but tries to 
round the keeper when he might have shot, and the backtracking Welsh is able to 
clear!

Currie/BPI/Rex Shutterstock  
66 min: Leadbitter is fouled but not allowed to play an advantage. He gives 
the referee a piece of his mind.
 
64 min: Despite the dearth in quality, you have to tip your hat to both 
Preston’s midfield three of Gallagher, Welsh and Johnson. They haven’t stopped 
running.
 
61 min: Downing has been anonymous. He’s done nothing this second half.
 
59 min: The quality is poor, to be honest. Nothing is happening. Boro are 
getting ready for their first change: Fabbrini, on loan from Watford is coming 
on for Reach. Let’s hope the Italian can inject some life into this game.
 
55 min: Kalas is the latest Boro player to be sent crashing to the turf, after 
Cunningham puts one or two studs into the back of the Czech’s achilles. Ouch.
 
52 min: Kike is cynically fouled by Clarke, and the Spaniard wastes no time in 
telling the referee what he thinks about it. The referee instead books Kike for 
dissent.

51 min: What a miss from Ayala! From the corner, he heads a good 10 yards over 
the bar despite having a free header on the edge of the six-yard box. Terrible 
effort, he completely mis-timed his jump and didn’t get over it.
 
50 min: Excellent run from Adomah, the first time he has really taken the 
fight to his opposite man on the right flank. He works half a yard and whips a 
cross to the near post, where Kike is just beaten to the ball by Huntington, 
who heads behind for a corner.
 
49 min: Billy Wright upends Kike – free-kick to Boro but again Downing is 
wasteful, with Pickford easily claiming. Boro yet to have a shot on target, 
Pickford has had nothing to do.
 
47 min: Clarke bravely wins a header on the edge of Boro’s box, and the ball 
nearly falls to Keane, but Konstantopoulos is quick off his line to smother the 
ball.
 
Peeep peeep! And we’re underway again.
 
Here is some more information on Gary Parkinson, the former Preston and Boro 
player in attendance today that suffers from locked-in syndrome.

Despite being fully-paralysed, Parkinson was hired as a scout by Boro in 2011. 
He would review players on DVD and then communicate his thoughts by blinking to 
his wife, who would then pass on the information to then-manager Tony Mowbray.

“When Tony first came to see Gary, he could see Gary was still aware of 
everything that was going on around him. So he asked Gary if he wanted to do 
some scouting for him,” Deborah said in 2011.

“A DVD comes down to us, with a sheet of paper. There is a description of the 
player, his name, his age, his position and the clubs he has played for.”

Quite remarkable.

Mid-match entertainment:
 
Poor first half from Boro. Save for that glorious Leadbitter chance early on, 
they haven’t threatened at all. We said that they looked a little light in 
attack this season, and that definitely showed this first period.
 
43 min: Vermijl chucks a long throw deep into the Boro box, and 
Konstantopoulos again fails to deal with it, on his own line he can only touch 
the high throw down, and is lucky that no Preston player is on hand to stab the 
ball in.
 
40 min: Garner is again brought down. Free-kick, and an ironic cheer goes up 
around Deepdale. There is the feeling that Preston have been on the wrong end 
of a few decisions this half.
 
37 min: The game is hotting up, with Garner inevitably in the throng of the 
action. He becomes sandwiched between Clayton and Ayala, and the three struggle 
for a good few seconds, as they try to untangle their limbs. Did Clayton stamp 
on Garner there? It certainly looks like he did.
 
35 min: Johnson, a man with some of the finest dreadlocks you are ever likely 
to see, is impressing for Preston this first half, showing a few deft touches. 
He drives into the area, and lays the ball back for Vermijl, but the Belgian 
completely slices it wide with his weaker left foot.

32 min: Clarke is booked for hacking down Friend. The Preston captain comes 
off a little worse, that looked like a nasty clash of shins. The free-kick is 
pumped into the box by Downing, but Ayala is penalised for grabbing Huntington 
by the neck.
 
29 min: Another mistake from Konstantopoulos gifts Preston another chance: 
this time he fumbles a cross from the left, and Garner pounces, attempting to 
lift the ball over the scrambling keeper, but it’s blocked. For all their 
possession, Boro are lucky not to be at least 1-0 down here.
 
28 min: Friend clears off the line! From the resulting free-kick, 
Konstantopoulos flaps at the cross, and the ball drops to Keane just beyond the 
penalty spot. He shoots low through a crowd of bodies, but Friend is just able 
to stab it clear, one yard off his own line. Saved a certain goal!
 
27 min: Keane is full of running, harrowing Kalas and Adomah, and winning the 
ball back. He passes to Garner, who is unceremoniously chopped down by the 
frustrated Adomah. Garner is really in the wars at the moment.
 
24 min: Garner is at it again, this time out-jumping Friend, with the two 
players landing in a heap on the floor. Garner is only 5ft8in remember, he’s 
got a remarkable leap, and scored plenty of headers last season in League One.
 
22 min: Garner and Ayala clash, the latter giving the Preston striker a little 
bump on the head with his elbow. It’s not violent, but Garner is understandably 
not happy. They exchange words, the referee Chris Kavanagh calms things down. 
No bookings.
 
19 min: Downing, who is indeed playing in that No10 role, is dropping very 
deep to pick up the ball. Preston will be happy for him to have the ball there.
 
15 min: What a run from George Friend. He dribbles the ball unchallenged from 
the edge of his own box to the edge of Preston’s, ghosting past Vermijl then 
Walsh, the Huntington. But instead of going for goal, he tries to pass to Kike 
and it is well intercepted by the covering Wright. That was a lung-busting run, 
he was probably too tired to shoot!
 
13 min: Boro have had 67% possession so far. They’ve started well. 
 
11 min: If Wright’s miss was bad, this is worse from Leadbitter. He is furious 
with himself! Boro’s captain played a clever one-two with Kike, dropped his 
shoulder to leave Huntington on his backside, and under no pressure whatsoever, 
flashed his shot wide from 10 yards out.

9 min: Chance for Preston’s Wright! Oh, he should do so much better. Gallagher 
is again over a set piece, and this time delivers a beauty to the near post – 
Wright completely loses his man and has a free run at the cross, but mis-times 
his header and the effort dribbles wide.
 
7 min: There is a round of applause from both sets of supporters for Gary 
Parkinson, a player formerly of both Preston and Boro, who suffers from 
locked-in syndrome. Parkinson is in attendance in the stands today. Nice touch, 
that.
 
6 min: Boro’s away fans are out in full force today. “One Steven Gibson, 
there’s only one Steven Gibson” they chant about their beloved chairman.
 
4 min: And what a way for Fry to introduce himself to Joe Garner, whacking him 
flush on the face with a high boot. Ouch. Free-kick to Preston, but Gallagher 
wastes it, punting it too long.
 
2 min: It’s a very pedestrian start with Boro’s defence, popping it about 
without much pressure. At the heart of that defence today is 17-year-old Dael 
Fry, making his full debut, who replaces the injured Ben Gibson. Big day for 
the youngster.
 
Peeep peeep! And we’re off.
 
The teams are out! John Welsh has lost his beard! Let’s do this!

Preston have released their playlist for today’s match. I assume that this is 
what they will blare out around the stadium, rather than in the dressing 
room/players’ headphones. But you never know.

Note Simon Grayson’s choice – Mr Brightside by The Killers 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE> – and the final song in the ‘Peak 
run-up’: Can’t Help Falling in Love, by UB40.

As my colleague Tom Bryant points out, not sure how ‘Living on a Prayer’ is 
supposed to inspire the Preston team/supporters …

Here’s what Karanka had to say prior to today’s game:

We are more mature now, more experienced, better and stronger now than last 
season. When I saw the first training session I knew they were ready. The 
expectations on us this season are a lot higher. 18 months ago we were close to 
the relegation position and last season were nearly went up, so everyone 
expects us to do even better this time. I haven’t got the squad I want just 
yet, but already we are stronger than we were last season.
 
Can we all just stop for a moment and admire this photo from 20 years ago? 
What a kit that is!

Today’s teams: 

Preston: Pickford, Vermijl, Clarke, Huntington, Wright, Cunningham, Welsh, 
Johnson, Gallagher, Keane and Garner.
Subs: James, Humphrey, Kilkenny Woods, Browne, Brownhill and Hugill.

New signings Will Keane and Marnick Vermijl start for Preston, as do new boys 
Greg Cunningham and Jordan Pickford. Beckford is injured but is expected to 
return next week.




Middlesbrough: Dimi, Kalas, Ayala, Fry, Friend, Adomah, Clayton, Leadbitter, 
Reach, Downing, Kike


Subs: Mejias, Carayol, Stephens, Stuani, Nsue, Fabbrini, Forshaw.

Kike to play up top on his own for Boro, with Downing tucked in behind. It was 
in that position that Downing shone so brightly for West Ham at the start of 
last season.
 
The last time Preston were promoted to the second tier (in 2000/01), they had 
a formidable strike-force, with the club reaching the play-off final. Jon 
Macken top-scored with 22 league goals, but he was well supported by a 
combination of David Healy, Richard Cresswell, and Brian McBride, on loan from 
Columbus Crew. Names that are enough to send a shiver down the spine of any 
defence, especially when they are led by player-manager David Moyes.

Last season at Preston, Joe Garner and Jermaine Beckford were arguably the 
most best forward partnership in the league. Garner won the league’s golden 
boot with 25 goals, and after a sluggish start, Beckford scored 15 goals in 23 
league (and play-off) games, including a hat-trick at Wembley in the 4-0 
play-off final victory over Swindon. Both have playedChampionship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> football, with varying 
success, but all eyes will be on whether they can continue last season’s form 
into this.

Middlesbrough’s own play-off story played out a little differently in May, as 
failed to overcome Norwich and reach the Premier League. They remain among the 
promotion favourites and have an excellent squad – hello Stuart Downing! – with 
their excellent manager, Aitor Karanka, recently penning a new four-year 
contract. However, much of their summer has also been focused on their 
strike-force, or a lack of one. Patrick Bamford – last season’s on-loan golden 
boy – and Lee Tomlin have departed and Boro’s attempts to replace them haven’t 
really materialised, with a £12m (!!!) bid for Jordan Rhodes rejected by 
Blackburn. Cristhian Stuani has joined from Espanyol, but they look a little 
light up top.

It’s all set up for a little upset today at Deepdale. Preston for a 2-1 win
