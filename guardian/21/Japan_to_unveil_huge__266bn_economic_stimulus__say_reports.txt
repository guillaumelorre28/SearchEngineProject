Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> is planning to launch a 
massive economic stimulus package worth more than 28 trillion yen (US$266 
billion), according to media reports.


Prime minister Shinzo Abe  <https://www.theguardian.com/world/shinzo-abe>
announced the programme in a speech in south-western Japan, giving few details 
except to say it would include about 13 trillion yen in fiscal measures 
including government spending, according to Jiji Press news agency.

More highlights of the package are expected next week when the cabinet is due 
to approve the measures.

But it is believed Abe will propose improved wages for childcare and elder 
care workers, the introduction of needs-based scholarships for college students 
and reduced employment time required to earn pensions.

There would also be money for infrastructure, such as expanding ports to 
accommodate larger ships and accelerating a decades-long high-speed maglev 
train project.

worth 10 to 30 trillion yen – after Britain’s vote last month to quit the

Traders tend to buy Japan’s currency as a safe bet in times of turmoil or 
uncertainty, but it makes the country’s exporters less competitive overseas and 
takes a bite out of their bottom line.

The news comes as speculation mounts that the Bank of Japan will further ease 
monetary policy after a two-day meeting Friday.

Since taking the helm more than three years ago bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda 
has overseen a huge asset-buying plan that now stands at an unprecedented 80 
trillion yen annually. The scheme is a cornerstone of Abe’s push to beat years 
of deflation and kickstart growth, dubbed Abenomics.

But while Kuroda has insisted the central bank’s target to reach 2% inflation 
is realistic, the BoJ has beenforced to push back its timeline for meeting that 
goal several times.

The government and central bank have come under increasing pressure to do more 
for the economy as a string of weak readings and sagging business confidence 
highlight a long-running weakness.

The dollar jumped as high as 106.54 yen from around 105.01 yen in the morning, 
after Fuji Television flagged the stimulus on Wednesday afternoon.

The benchmark Nikkei stock average ended higher on Wednesday, lifted by 
reports of the stimulus. The Nikkei ended up 1.7% at 16,664.82. It had jumped 
as much as 2.7% to 16,821.43 in early afternoon trade.
