A Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> council 
has axed funding for a community harmony day event linked to a dumped One 
Nation candidate over “stupid” comments she made about gay people.

The Ipswich mayor, Paul Pisasale, said his council would scrap its usual 
funding for a local World Harmony Day event planned for March because it has 
been linked to teacher Shan Ju Lin.

people.

Lin has refused to apologise after saying “gays should be treated as patients” 
and that “abnormal sex behaviour leads to abnormal crime”.

The mayor said his council could not fund the Harmony Day event linked to Lin, 
given what she had said.

“She’s made stupid statements. We’re not going to tolerate that sort of 
behaviour,” he told the ABC.

“I’m not going to have the destruction of harmony in our community. What she’s 
done is take a perfectly good event and used it for political purposes, and now 
the whole event has lost its credibility.”

Lin, a teacher, has been named as the president of a group named the World 
Harmony Society, which is organising Ipswich’s World Harmony Day community 
event planned for 11 March.

Lin, who is on holiday overseas, said her views on gay people were not 
inconsistent with the concept of community harmony.

“Essential to achieving harmony is that you have the freedom to speak freely. 
Any issues that arise can then be resolved peacefully and this in turn 
illustrates why freedom of speech is vital to a healthy culture,” she said.

She has said she hopes the event can still go ahead.
