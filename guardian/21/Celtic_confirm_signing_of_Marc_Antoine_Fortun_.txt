Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> tonight confirmed the 
signing of Marc-Antoine Fortuné from Nancy on a three-year contract. The 
28-year-old French Guiana-born striker joins for an undisclosed fee, reportedly 
in the region of £3.8m.

Fortuné is Tony Mowbray's first signing since he became Celtic manager, with 
the pair reunited after the forward spent the second half of last season on 
loan at West Bromwich Albion. Fortuné passed a medical yesterday before 
completing the formalities of his deal today.

The Frenchman told his new club's website: "This is where I want to be. Having 
met the people at the club and knowing all about the club's fantastic pedigree 
and support, this is where I saw my future. I am looking forward to the 
challenge of winning the league title, competing for the cups and playing in 
Europe, in front of the Celtic supporters.

"I am also looking forward to working with my manager, Tony Mowbray, once 
again. I had a great experience with him, Mark Venus and Peter Grant in the 
Premiership last season and I am looking forward to now working with him at one 
of Europe's biggest football clubs."

Mowbray was equally delighted to be resuming the pair's relationship. "Marc is 
a quality player and, at West Brom, he was a privilege to work with. Some of 
his play in the second half of the season was phenomenal and, if you look at 
our goals ratio as a team after he joined, you can see the impact he made.

"He is a team player, we were delighted with the way he performed in the 
Premiership and are looking forward to working with him at Celtic."

Fortuné joined up with the first-team squad today and will be officially 
unveiled tomorrow before Celtic's trip to Australia for Sunday's opening 
pre-season friendly against Brisbane Roar.
