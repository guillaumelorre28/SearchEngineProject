A fun little genre flick that doesn’t try to do too much, but does more than 
you might have expected. Underground in location but entirely mainstream in 
sensibility, it’s a clever, claustrophobic chamber piece. Winstead finds 
herself a nuclear bunker-guest of Goodman’s avuncular weirdo, who’s 
well-prepared for the alien apocalypse he assures her is going on upstairs. But 
is it? How to tell? It would be a crime to reveal more, but as the title, and 
the fact it was produced by JJ Abrams, suggest, there certainly is.

High-Rise (15) (Ben Wheatley, 2015, UK) 
Tom Hiddleston, Sienna Miller, Luke Evans. 119 mins

JG Ballard’s totemic tower-block tale finally makes it off the drawing board, 
with 1970s features and politics preserved. The mass psychosis, societal 
breakdown and middle-class warfare is conducted with sardonic glee, even if the 
story descends (or rather, ascends) into chaos before it’s established much 
order.

The Pearl Button (12A) (Patricio Guzmán, 2015, Fra/Spa/Chi/Swi) 
82 mins

After the brilliant Nostalgia For The Light, another distinctive essay from 
Guzmán, roaming freely across Chile’s history and geography. With arresting 
imagery, warm humanity and a wealth of insight, it’s an enriching experience.

The Boy (15) (William Brent Bell, 2016, US/Chi/Can) 
Lauren Cohan, Rupert Evans, James Russell. 97 mins

This supernatural horror has its work cut out by its ludicrous premise: a 
nanny is charged with minding a life-sized doll, which inevitably has 
Chucky-like malevolent tendencies.

Risen (12A) (Kevin Reynolds, 2016, US) 
Joseph Fiennes, Tom Felton, Peter Firth. 107 mins

How to retell the best-known story in Christendom? By framing the Resurrection 
as a Roman mystery thriller, which Fiennes’ tribune must get to the bottom of. 
It’s Passion Of The Christ meets CSI.

Rock The Kasbah (15) (Barry Levinson, 2015, US) 
Bill Murray, Kate Hudson, Leem Lubany. 106 mins

Cross-cultural encounters of the worst kind occur when Murray’s jaded LA music 
manager travels to wartorn Afghanistan and discovers a Pashtun singing talent. 
The laughs stay at home.

Norm Of The North (U) (Trevor Wall, 2016, Ind/US) 
Rob Schneider, Heather Graham, Ken Jeong. 90 mins

A polar bear comes to New York for third-tier animation and toilet humour when 
his Arctic habitat is threatened by gentrification.

Marguerite (15) (Xavier Giannoli, 2015, Fra/Cze/Bel) 
Catherine Frot, André Marcon, Michel Fau. 129 mins

Frot shines and squawks as a wealthy 1920s Paris chanteuse who’s apparently 
oblivious to her lack of talent – though others ironically celebrate it. More 
than a straight farce, the story has already inspired a Meryl Streep-led 
version.

Kapoor And Sons (12A) (Shakun Batra, 2016, Ind) 
Alia Bhatt, Fawad Khan, Sidharth Malhotra. 132 mins

Genial Bollywood romcom about a dysfunctional family and two lovelorn brothers.

Out from Friday
