I will be 60 next July and have been teaching at a further education college 
for more than 20 years. This means I will be eligible to retire and claim 
mypension, but I don’t have to.

There are many changes taking place at the college and it is looking at 
merging with other institutions. The job has becomestressful, plus I have 
diabetes.


To claim my pension from July 2017 I have to give between six weeks’ and six 
months’ notice – which means decision time is looming.


I have no concrete plans as to what to do after retirement, but I know I would 
want to do something. Colleagues say I should just reduce my teaching hours and 
carry on in the same job.


I want to change to a lower non-teaching and less demanding role in my present 
college, perhaps as a teaching or learning support tutor.


I don’t know whether I should approach my head or HR to discuss my future now, 
as I worry this may put doubts in their mind about my competence and commitment 
as a teacher – if the only choice is to carry on as I am – and my fitness.

Or should I just give in my notice and plan something new on retirement? If 
so, what is my best plan?
