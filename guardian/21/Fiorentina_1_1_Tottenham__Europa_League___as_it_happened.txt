Well that’s all from me. It hasn’t been Tottenham’s finest display, but they 
still have several reasons to be delighted. One, they will be strong favourites 
to win the tie, what with the away goal and stuff. Two, Dele Alli should have 
got sent off in the first half? Three, Fiorentina could easily have won anyway: 
they were poor in the first half but still had the best chances, then their 
second-half substitutions wrested control of the game from their opponents (for 
20 minutes at least) and they also saw Gonzalo Rodriguez’s late header flash 
wide, when he could so easily have scored.Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> have it all very much to do, 
but on the plus side they royally entertain fans to multiple Hi-De-Hi 
impressions at every home game. It’s not much by way of consolation, but there 
you go. Bye!

90+3 mins: The ball is hoisted forwards, and the camera finds Gonzalo 
Rodriguez on the floor, with Harry Kane standing nearby guiltily. The 
Englishman is booked, and replays show a forearm shove, of no great violence 
but nevertheless, a forearm shove.
 Harry Kane pleads his innocence but is shown the yellow card. Photograph:

90+1 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time, and they start with 
Zarate having another shot, from 30 yards. It’s an eye-catching effort, heading 
up high and then looping down, but a) it’s going narrowly wide, and b) Vorm 
catches it.

89 mins: Save! And then near miss! Zarate shoots low at the near post from 
just outside the penalty area, and Vorm falls to his left to push it 
unconvincingly clear. The ball is put behind for a corner, which is met by 
Gonzalo Rodriguez at the near post and flashes across goal and just wide of the 
far post!

68 mins: Tottenham, who would surely have preferred him to stay on the bench, 
are bringing Harry Kane on, with Son going off. Which shows what Pochettino

64 mins: Now Fiorentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> are 
doing all the attacking, and Bernardeschi has another long-range shot. This one 
isn’t deflected, and is harmlessly off-target.

62 mins: Fiorentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> ring the 
changes: Kalinic comes on for Blaszczykowski, to the immense gratitude of 
everyone forced to type player names in a hurry (me). A minute earlier they 
brought on Milan Badelj, and took off Josip Ilicic.

GOAL! Fiorentina 1-1 Tottenham (Bernadeschi, 60 mins)

Goal! From nowhere! Bernadeschi has a shot from 25 yards, and it flicks off 
Mason, who is closing down half-heartedly, and loops over Vorm and into the top 
corner!

54 mins: Tottenham create a chance! With the entire Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> defence running right to 
cover Alli’s run, Dembélé slides the ball left to Chadli, who runs into the 
area, checks onto his right foot, and then shoots unconvincingly low towards 
the near post, where Tatarusanu saves.

50 mins: Kind of almost-chance for Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina>, who slide a low cross in 
from the left flank, and Zarate meets it at the near post and stabs it 
goalwards. It almost instantly hits a defender, though, and rumbles wide. The 
corner is wasted.

47 mins: Disallowed Tottenham goal! They win a free kick on the right, Eriksen 
curls it in and Son stoops to head in at the near post, with Tatarusanu diving 
in vain. Son, though, was one of two Spurs players standing a yard offside as 
the ball was struck.

Alli definitely kicked Tomovic in the chest, rather than pulling out of a kick 
at the last moment, as I suggested earlier, and should have had his marching 
orders. That apart it’s been a scrappy game, withFiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> struggling to cope with 
Tottenham’s pressing, and Spurs not really sure what to do when they attack.

Half time: Fiorentina 0-1 Tottenham

Half one is over, and Spurs are winning and deserve to be winning on the 
balance of play if not the totting up of chances –Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> have had a couple of corkers, 
while Tottenham have little more than that penalty to boast about.

45+1 mins: Into first-half stoppage time we go, and there’ll be just a single

45 mins: Chance for Fiorentina! Valero finds Blaszczykowski bursting into 
space on the right, he crosses low and the ball ricochets off a couple of legs 
to Zarate, who blasts over from 15 yards.

44 mins: Spurs keep possession for an age, working the ball down the right 
flank, into and around the home side’s penalty area, without ever quite 
creating anything. Still, they’re very much in control at present.

40 mins: Alli runs past Tino Costa, who sticks out an elbow which Alli runs

35 mins: Now Ryan Mason does some shirt-pulling.and is also warned rather than

really pretty poor.

32 mins: How did that not go in? Ilicic crosses from the right, the ball goes 
over the head of Alderweireld and Bernadeschi runs onto it, six yards out, 
needing only to tap it into the net. Instead, and puzzlingly, he hits itaway 
from goal, and Spurs survive!

Well that’s all from me. It hasn’t been Tottenham’s finest display, but they 
still have several reasons to be delighted. One, they will be strong favourites 
to win the tie, what with the away goal and stuff. Two, Dele Alli should have 
got sent off in the first half? Three, Fiorentina could easily have won anyway: 
they were poor in the first half but still had the best chances, then their 
second-half substitutions wrested control of the game from their opponents (for 
20 minutes at least) and they also saw Gonzalo Rodriguez’s late header flash 
wide, when he could so easily have scored.Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> have it all very much to do, 
but on the plus side they royally entertain fans to multiple Hi-De-Hi 
impressions at every home game. It’s not much by way of consolation, but there 
you go. Bye!
 
It wasn’t a classic, but Spurs have a draw, and an away goal, and head for 
White Hart Lane with theirEuropa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> destiny very much in 
their own sweaty palms.
 
90+3 mins: The ball is hoisted forwards, and the camera finds Gonzalo 
Rodriguez on the floor, with Harry Kane standing nearby guiltily. The 
Englishman is booked, and replays show a forearm shove, of no great violence 
but nevertheless, a forearm shove.

90+3 mins: Alonso fouls Dembélé, and the final minute will start with a Spurs 
free kick in their own half.
 
90+1 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time, and they start with 
Zarate having another shot, from 30 yards. It’s an eye-catching effort, heading 
up high and then looping down, but a) it’s going narrowly wide, and b) Vorm 
catches it.
 
89 mins: Save! And then near miss! Zarate shoots low at the near post from 
just outside the penalty area, and Vorm falls to his left to push it 
unconvincingly clear. The ball is put behind for a corner, which is met by 
Gonzalo Rodriguez at the near post and flashes across goal and just wide of the 
far post!
 
88 mins: Alli sends an overhead over the bar! Trippier crossed from the right, 
and the young English whippet went all acrobatic and shinned it over.

88 mins: Sorry, not sure that last incident deserved an exclamation mark. 
 
87 mins: A long ball from defence finds Valero bursting down the right, but 
the linesman raises his flag. And he’s wrong to have done so!
 
85 mins: This has been a forgettable game. There are now just five minutes 
left for someone to do something genuinely good.
 
83 mins: The corner misses everyone and allows Bernardeschi to break, but his 
first touch is long, allowing Spurs to reclaim the ball.
 
82 mins: Trippier finds space on the right, but instead of crossing he stops, 
waits and pulls back to Dier, whose first-time shot from 25 yards is deflected 
wide.
 
81 mins: Into the final 10 minutes we roar. Meanwhile, I’m happy to make it 
clear that this is the Round of 32.

@Simon_Burnton <https://twitter.com/Simon_Burnton> Nowhere on the live feed 
(on mobile) did it say what round the Spurs match is, had to check on BBC 
Sport! Worth including ;)

79 mins: A delay, as Mauro Zarate has treatment for cramp. The last 10 minutes 
have seen Fiorentina’s ascendancy wane, and the game return to messy if 
competitive equality.
 
78 mins: Hello campers! The final substitution of the evening sees Chadli 
hooked, and Dier replace him.

76 mins: Spurs now have a shot, but it’s limp, and from an unhelpful angle, 
from Kane, and Tatarusanu catches.
 
75 mins: Vecino has a long-range shot for Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina>, and it would probably have 
nestled just inside the post if Spurs didn’t have a goalkeeper. Which they do.
 
73 mins: I am enjoying the stadium announcements, preceded as they are with a 
little two-note xylophone trill that will surely remind all viewers of a 
certain age of this:
 
72 mins: Fiorentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> continue 
to push, with the ball just running away from Zarate a couple of times in the 
last couple of moments.
 
68 mins: Tottenham, who would surely have preferred him to stay on the bench, 
are bringing Harry Kane on, with Son going off. Which shows what Pochettino 
thinks of this second half.Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> have made their final change, 
Matias Vecino replacing Costa.
 
67 mins: Dembélé and Badelj both go for a ball bouncing at waist-height. 
Neither lands boot on the other. Dembélé is booked, puzzlingly in my opinion.
 
66 mins: Another Fiorentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> 
shot, Alonso trying to bend one in at the far post from the left-hand corner of 
the area (but missing).
 
64 mins: Now Fiorentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> are 
doing all the attacking, and Bernardeschi has another long-range shot. This one 
isn’t deflected, and is harmlessly off-target.
 
62 mins: Fiorentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> ring the 
changes: Kalinic comes on for Blaszczykowski, to the immense gratitude of 
everyone forced to type player names in a hurry (me). A minute earlier they 
brought on Milan Badelj, and took off Josip Ilicic.

Goal! From nowhere! Bernadeschi has a shot from 25 yards, and it flicks off 
Mason, who is closing down half-heartedly, and loops over Vorm and into the top 
corner!

58 mins: Spurs are getting a bit of stick online for this diminutive tweet 
about Alli’s first-half yellow card, which doesn’t mention the fact he kicked a 
grounded opponent:
Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) 
30mins @Dele_Alli <https://twitter.com/Dele_Alli> goes into the book for a 
challenge on Tomovic, 0-0.#COYS <https://twitter.com/hashtag/COYS?src=hash>

2016 <https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/700387005579071488>  
56 mins: Another Spurs shot, this time from Son, 20 yards out, whose low 
effort zips wide. Good work from Alli in the build-up.
 
54 mins: Tottenham create a chance! With the entire Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> defence running right to 
cover Alli’s run, Dembélé slides the ball left to Chadli, who runs into the 
area, checks onto his right foot, and then shoots unconvincingly low towards 
the near post, where Tatarusanu saves.
 
50 mins: Kind of almost-chance for Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina>, who slide a low cross in 
from the left flank, and Zarate meets it at the near post and stabs it 
goalwards. It almost instantly hits a defender, though, and rumbles wide. The 
corner is wasted.
 
48 mins: Davies tries to tackle Blaszczykowski but gets only ankle, and is 
duly booked.
 
47 mins: Disallowed Tottenham goal! They win a free kick on the right, Eriksen 
curls it in and Son stoops to head in at the near post, with Tatarusanu diving 
in vain. Son, though, was one of two Spurs players standing a yard offside as 
the ball was struck.

46 mins: Into half two we roll, and there’s a Spurs substitution to report: 
Tom Carroll is off, and Mousa Dembélé is on.

Alli definitely kicked Tomovic in the chest, rather than pulling out of a kick 
at the last moment, as I suggested earlier, and should have had his marching 
orders. That apart it’s been a scrappy game, withFiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> struggling to cope with 
Tottenham’s pressing, and Spurs not really sure what to do when they attack.
 
Half one is over, and Spurs are winning and deserve to be winning on the 
balance of play if not the totting up of chances –Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> have had a couple of corkers, 
while Tottenham have little more than that penalty to boast about.
 
45+1 mins: Into first-half stoppage time we go, and there’ll be just a single 
minute of it, unless anything unusual happens.
 
45 mins: Chance for Fiorentina! Valero finds Blaszczykowski bursting into 
space on the right, he crosses low and the ball ricochets off a couple of legs 
to Zarate, who blasts over from 15 yards.
 
44 mins: Spurs keep possession for an age, working the ball down the right 
flank, into and around the home side’s penalty area, without ever quite 
creating anything. Still, they’re very much in control at present.
 
40 mins: Alli runs past Tino Costa, who sticks out an elbow which Alli runs 
into, prompting much agonised rolling about. Just a free kick.
 
Chadli sidefoots into the bottom left corner, with the goalkeeper diving the 
other way, and Spurs have an away goal!

36 mins: Davies runs into the penalty area, where he’s tripped by Tomovic, and 
another refereeing decision goes Spurs’ way!
 Nenad Tomovic disagrees with the referee. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters  
35 mins: Now Ryan Mason does some shirt-pulling.and is also warned rather than 
booked. Spurs have benefited from a couple of lenient decisions, and could very 
well be playing with 10 men, replays of that Dele Alli kick making it look 
really pretty poor.
 
32 mins: How did that not go in? Ilicic crosses from the right, the ball goes 
over the head of Alderweireld and Bernadeschi runs onto it, six yards out, 
needing only to tap it into the net. Instead, and puzzlingly, he hits itaway 
from goal, and Spurs survive!
