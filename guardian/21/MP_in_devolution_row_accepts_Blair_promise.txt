 Tony Blair last night appealed to Labour Party members in Wales to back this 
autumn's campaign for a Welsh Assembly after the anti-devolution MP, Llew 
Smith, announced that he was satisfied with Mr Blair's commitment to free 
speech on the issue.
Mr Blair and his Welsh Secretary, Ron Davies - who was accused of trying to 
strong-arm Mr Smith, MP for Blaenau Gwent - called the proposed assembly vital 
to the democratic renewal ofWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> and 
plan a series of party meetings to cement support for a Yes vote.

 But Mr Smith's public row, which prompted his leader to say that reasonable 
opposition to devolution would be tolerated without threats of expulsion, may 
have a counter-productive result. Some wavering activists may be more inclined 
to support the No campaign, which won by 4-1 in the 1979 referendum.

 Announcing that he will not now be pursuing his complaint to the standards 
and privileges committee, Mr Smith said he was not withdrawing his charges 
against Mr Davies and his team and would - if necessary - repeat them on oath.

 But he will let the matter rest for now. 'All along, I have said this issue 
is about free speech and much to the credit of the Prime Minister, he has 
always recognised this, and indeed he announced that differences of opinion can 
be put on this issue without fear of expulsion,' he said.

 Tory peer Lord Crickhowell, an ex-Welsh Secretary, yesterday tabled 
amendments in the Lords to the Referendum Bill making intimidation a criminal 
offence.
