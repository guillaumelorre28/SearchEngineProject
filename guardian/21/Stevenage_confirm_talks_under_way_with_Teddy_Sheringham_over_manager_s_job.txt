Stevenage <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stevenage> have confirmed they 
are holding talks with the former Manchester United and England striker Teddy 
Sheringham about their vacant manager’s position.

Sheringham is the attacking coach at West Ham but has spoken to Borough about 
replacing Graham Westley, whose contract expires at the end of the month.

In a statement, the club said: “Stevenage FC have confirmed they are in talks 
with former Man United, Spurs, West Ham and England international Teddy 
Sheringham with a view to him taking over as manager next season.”

The move would be 49-year-old Sheringham’s first into management after his 
appointment to become a member of the West Ham staff 12 months ago.

Sheringham started his career with Millwall and played for Nottingham Forest, 
Tottenham (twice), Manchester United, Portsmouth, West Ham and Colchester 
before retiring aged 42. He earned 51 caps.

Stevenage reached the play-offs this season, but lost to Southend last week, 
and Westley’s time at Broadhall Way appears up after eight seasons over three 
spells.

Stevenage’s chairman, Phil Wallace, said: “Graham Westley’s agreement ends on 
31 May and his team couldn’t have done more from a results viewpoint this 
season, but Graham’s been Stevenage manager for eight of the past 12 years and 
that’s a long time at this level of football.

“Our board doesn’t dishonour contracts at a whim, so even when things weren’t 
going well in 2014, we kept the faith and our faith was rewarded by results in 
2015. Graham may now have some football offers coming in that we wouldn’t be 
able to match and I know he has some opportunities outside of football to 
consider.

“Despite the utmost respect and appreciation I have for everything he’s done 
for Stevenage FC, sometimes you have to accept that a business needs to change 
to refresh itself and evolve.”
