I, Daniel Blake <https://www.theguardian.com/film/i-daniel-blake>, Ken Loach’s 
drama about a middle-aged carpenter recovering from a heart attack and trying 
to navigate the benefits system, has taken best British film at the Evening 
Standard film awards.

At a ceremony in London hosted by the actor and director Richard Ayoade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/richard-ayoade>, the drama also picked up 
best actress for newcomer Hayley Squires, who plays a single mother also 
encountering obstacles claiming welfare. It capped the evening by winning the 
award for most powerful scene, for its harrowing sequence set in a foodbank in 
which Squires’s character is so hungry she eats from a tin of cold baked beans.

The awards, now in their 40th year, recognise primarily British films and 
talent, and their celebration of Loach’s film echoes the message of the paper’s 
recent championing ofThe Felix Project <http://www.thefelixproject.org/>, which 
seeks to distribute surplus food to Londoners in need.


Loach’s film, which initially struggled to find funding, has been an 
unexpected hit: firstpicking up the Palme d’Or in Cannes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/ken-loach-cannes-2016-palme-dor-win-i-daniel-blake>
, then being endorsed by the likes of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/02/corbyn-urges-may-to-see-i-daniel-blake-to-gain-insight-on-life-on-welfare>
. So far, the film has taken £4m in the UK; a best-ever result for Loach, who 
is now 80. Loach did not attend due, said he longtime producer Rebecca O’Brien, 
to illness, which meant he was unable to travel. He did honour a long-standing 
engagement at his local football club in Bath.

Picking up the awards in Loach’s absence, O’Brien said: “Ken will be really 
pissed off he missed this.” Addressing the after-dinner audience at Claridge’s, 
O’Brien said: “We can’t believe how lucky we are to be so feted when there are 
people using foodbanks and starving in the sixth richest country in the world.

“I know it’s a bit of a spoiler to say that, but this film is about people who 
are suffering in our country now, which is why it’s been noticed by the 
government and denied by the government, and why it’s been picked up by the 
opposition as an important film.”

Squires described the film as “the absolute truth of what’s happening to 
millions of British people in this country,” before making reference to the 
spat between I, Daniel Blake’s film-makers and critics such as Toby Young and 
Camilla Long, who were accused of being out of touch when they dismissed of the 
film as unrealistic.

“It’s very irresponsible journalism,” said Squires. “It was quite vulgar. They 
dismissed the people going through [a hard time] and made them feel very small.”

Squires also said that playing a single mother was a gift because “it’s a 
demographic in Britain that’s really, really victimised; made out to be 
unloving and irresponsible and a real blight”.

Hugh Grant <https://www.theguardian.com/film/hughgrant> took best actor for 
his role as Meryl Streep’s failed thespian husband in Florence Foster Jenkins, 
a biopic of a notoriously awful singer in 1940s New York.

“I’m very grateful,” said Grant. “It’s the only award I’ve had from a paper 
that wasn’t for hacking my phone.” The Evening Standard, he said, had been “a 
big part of my life for 56 years”, saying that the man who flashed him on the 
tube aged 13 did so through a hole in the paper. “It may be true that the 
Standard still to this day is 16% owed by Satan, but aren’t we all? And the 
rest of the ownership is in very good and very well manicured hands.”

Grant also thanked his director, Stephen Frears, “for this unfashionable offer 
of this rather juicy part” as well as his children, “who are tiny and have no 
idea what I do but they have made me much nicer and much better at the love 
bits. I couldn’t have done it without them”.


Elsewhere, Kate Beckinsale <https://www.theguardian.com/film/kate-beckinsale> 
won best actress for her revelatory turn as a charming, Machiavellian widow in 
Love & Friendship, Whit Stillman’s adaptation of Jane Austen’s novella Lady 
Susan.

Ed Balls presented the Peter Sellers award for comedy to Bridget Jones’s Baby, 
the London-set belated second sequel for Helen Fielding’s scatty singleton. In 
his introduction, Balls compared the recently elected Donald Trump to one of 
Sellers’s best-known characters, Dr Strangelove. He also said that, forced to 
choose between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, he would opt for Firth.

Lion picked up the international film prize. The film stars Dev Patel as a man 
who traces his birth family in India with the help of Google Maps – and adopted 
mother Nicole Kidman. That prize was presented by Olympic diver Tom Daley and 
his fiance, Dustin Lance Black; the latter said that in the current climate, 
“the idea of aggressively embracing diversity has never been more important” 
and that films such asLion <https://www.theguardian.com/film/lion> help promote 
inclusivity and “inspire action on a global scale”.

Accepting the award, executive producer Harvey Weinstein passed on a “sweet 
message from Homeland Security” to London mayor Sadiq Khan: “You’re not fucking 
welcome in our country any more.” Rueing the election of Donald Trump, 
Weinstein said he was reminded of a Kurt Vonnegut quote his late mother was 
especially fond of: “Good can triumph over evil if the good are as organised as 
the mafia.”

“Watch out,” concluded Weinstein. “The next four years to the mafia.”

Khan himself presented the editor’s award to Fantastic Beasts and Where to 
Find Them which, although set in 1920s New York, was shot at Leavesden Studios 
in the UK’s capital. Khan said: “The film speaks to the values that Londoners 
hold dear: diversity, openness and acceptance.”

Bob Geldolf presented the best documentary prize to climate change documentary 
Before the Flood, saying that the “reality that [the film] presents is tangible 
and real and scary and I’m not sure you want to watch but you must watch it”.

Co-director Fisher Stevens, who made the film alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, 
said that they had rushed the release when they realised Hillary Clinton would 
be running against a climate change denier, “and I don’t think anyone saw it”. 
Stevens professed encouragement at the fact Ivanka Trump had been “moved” by 
the film and that despite theappointment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/07/trump-scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency>
 of Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, he and DiCaprio 
would “keep trying to make Trump and his cabinet realise that climate change is 
real”.

The screenplay prize was won by Guy Hibbert for drone warfare nail-biter Eye 
in the Sky; Florence Pugh took best newcomer for her role in feminist thriller 
Lady Macbeth and Arinzé Kene received best supporting actor for his performance 
in gay footballer drama The Pass.

The technical achievement award was taken by composer Max Richter for his 
contribution to the music for Arrival. Richter, a British-raised veteran of 
movie soundtracks, contributed On the Nature of Daylight to Denis Villeneuve’s 
cerebral sci-fi – the piece bookends the movie to what those who voted for the 
award deemed devastating effect.

The judging panel was made up of film critics from the Evening Standard, the 
Times, the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph.
