Huddled around their hives, beekeepers around the south-eastern US fear a new 
threat to their livelihood: a fine mist beaded with neurotoxin, sprayed from 
the sky by officials at war with mosquitos that carry theZika virus

Earlier this week, South Carolina beekeepers found millions of dead honey bees 
carpeting their apiaries, killed by an insecticide. Videoposted by a beekeeper 
to Facebook 
<https://www.facebook.com/Flowertown-Bee-Farm-and-Supplies-169371146803372/> 
showed thousands of dead insects heaped around hives, while a few survivors 
struggled to move the bodies of fellow bees.

“This is what’s left of Flowertown Bees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bees>,” a despondent keeper says in 
the video. Company co-owner Juanita Stanley told the Associated Press her farm 
looked “like it’s been nuked” and estimated 2.5 million bees were killed.

In another Facebook post, 
<https://www.facebook.com/100011338145585/videos/360425757678693/> South 
Carolina hobbyist Andrew Macke wrote that he had lost “thousands upon thousands 
of bees” and that the spraying had devastated his business. “Have we lost our 
mind,” he wrote, “spraying poison from the sky?”


Around the US, bees and other pollinators contribute an estimated $29bn to 
farm income 
<http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/05/insect-pollinators-contribute-29b-us-farm-income>
. Clemson University’s department of pesticide regulation is investigating the 
incident.

The program head, Dr Mike Weyman, said that though South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> has strict rules about 
protecting pollinators, county officials were using the neurotoxin, Naled, 
under a clause exempting them in a “clear and public health crisis”.

More than three dozen people have tested positive for Zika in South Carolina, 
Weyman said, and officials have made it a priority to prevent local 
transmissions through the Aedes aegypti mosquito.


“We don’t want one of those mosquitos having a blood meal on an individual 
we’ve already determined was positive,” Weyman said. “We know beyond a shadow 
of a doubt that [Zika] isup and running in Florida 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/florida-zika-virus-outbreak-miami-mosquitos>
. If it gets in the mosquito population ... you’re playing catch-up.”

South Carolina’s protocol for Zika infections is to alert local officials of a 
carrier’s residence, which they “consider a ground zero”, Weyman said. Local 
authorities then target the local mosquitos in a 200-yard radius, in this case 
with spray.

Flowertown Bees was listed on local records but not in the state’s voluntary 
registry of pollinators, according to Weyman. “We know where the big ones are,” 
he said, “but as you can see this was a fairly large operation and almost right 
smack dab in the spray path.”

If regulation allowed some spraying that would kill half of your livestock 
overnight, how would you recover?
Jennifer Holmes, Florida State Beekeepers Association 
Despite the investigation into what went wrong, the killing has beekeepers 
worried about what might happen next.

“Everyone that I’ve spoken to has major concerns about the effect” of 
insecticides, said Jennifer Holmes, vice-president of theFlorida State 
Beekeepers Association <http://www.floridabeekeepers.org/> and the co-owner of 
a company with about 300 colonies north of West Palm Beach.

Comparing bees to cows or other pillars of agriculture, she said: “If there 
was a regulation that allowed some spraying that would kill half of your 
livestock overnight, how would recover your livelihood?”

Holmes has spent the last week working with beekeepers and state and county 
officials. The keepers, she said, fear “not just the immediate die-offs, but 
possible genetic die-offs or sterility” for bees that survive the first sprays.

“We understand the serious threat of possible disease,” she said, “but we also 
have to maintain our agricultural livelihood.”

A Louisiana beekeeper, who requested anonymity because of work with county 
officials, added another set of concerns: careless mixture and application of 
chemicals, mismanagement and long-term imbalance in the ecosystem.

“In order to ‘fix’ the problem,” the keeper said, “it will all have to begin 
with re-establishing healthy soil that will nourish a healthy plant population 
that will nourish healthy populations, whether it be the honeybee or a deer.

“Chemical application of any sort creates an imbalance from the ground up, 
even if a simple mosquito is the target.”

Experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
<http://www.cdc.gov/zika/vector/aerial-spraying.html> (CDC), the Environmental 
Protection Agency <https://www.epa.gov/mosquitocontrol/naled-mosquito-control> 
(EPA) and independent universities say Naled is far safer than other chemicals. 
It breaks down rapidly and, in the very low doses at which it is prescribed, 
should not pose a risk to humans.

“In Louisiana, we use these products quite frequently to reduce mosquitos, but 
we don’t see many nontarget effects, because the doses are really small,” said 
Dr Kirsten Healy, a public health entomologist at Louisiana State University.

“A lot of people don’t realize that we always have the environment in mind. We 
try to have products that have the lowest possible impact.”

Even the mosquitos targeted “quickly bounce back”, she said. Healy recommended 
a multi-pronged approach: aerial and ground sprays along with removal of the 
trash cans, bird feeders and other containers where water pools and mosquitos 
breed.

Aerial sprays threaten other pollinators. Dennis Olle, director of 
conservation programs for the North American Butterfly Association, noted the 
effect of chaotic ocean winds near his office in Miami. “It’s aerial bombing 
without any sense of being able to lay the chemical down on the target,” he 
said.

It kills everything. There’s no question it is highly, highly deleterious to 
butterflies and other arthropods
Dennis Olle, North American Butterfly Association 
Olle conceded that that he was not a scientist – he is an attorney – but 
described a 2015 Florida International University study  
<http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article27299731.html>that 
found Naled application was uneven and harmful to butterflies.

“It kills everything,” he said. “There’s no question that it is highly, highly 
deleterious to butterflies and other arthropods, even mammals in high enough 
doses.”

He agreed that door-to-door removal of breeding objects and hand spraying were 
effective techniques against mosquitos, but worried about repeated low doses of 
chemicals to both pollinators and his children.

“If they’re killing every mosquito, as they claim, everything else needs to be 
worried too,” he said. “That’s not rocket science, that’s common sense.”

Olle’s fears have sympathizers in Florida and Puerto Rico, where there have 
been, respectively, 35 and 13,791 mosquito infections of the Zika virus. 
Earlier this summer on Puerto Rico,doctors 
<http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article95024917.html> rallied 
<https://www.facebook.com/RafaelBernabeGobernador/videos/1129072043826790/> 
against Naled when the CDC made a last-ditch plea to start spraying. Governor 
Alejandro García Padillarejected the proposal 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/health/zika-virus-puerto-rico.html> in July, 
citing concerns over possible side effects on humans and other animals.

Puerto Rico was also the site of some of what limited Naled-mosquito research 
has been performed in the last 30 years. Dr Duane Gubler, a professor at Duke 
Medical School and an expert in infectious diseases, led that research and 
found that Naled had mixed results.

“It’s unpredictable,” Gubler said. “We did the whole city of San Juan and it 
appeared to be somewhat effective in some areas but not others.”

Aedes aegypti mosquitos, Gubler said, were especially difficult targets since 
they breed inside and under houses, in buckets, tires, puddles or any container 
with stagnant water.

“There’s some data from Florida <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida> 
that suggests it can be effective where Aedes aegypti mosquitos are primarily 
outdoor breeders,” he said, “but from my data, it was spotty.”

Like Healy, Gubler recommended a mix of techniques – targeting adults and 
larvae through habitats and sprays and a partnership between citizens and 
agencies. “It’s near impossible for any government agency to control all of the 
mosquitos,” he said.

“It’s a matter of weighing the benefits versus the risks,” he added, noting 
the critical place of bees, especially, in keeping crops growing.

“If you have to make a decision on whether it protects, say, your pregnant 
wife from being exposed versus killing a few butterflies, I suspect in most 
people’s minds it’s probably worth the risk.”
