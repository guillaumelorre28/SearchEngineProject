Here’s a look at the final stats. Celtic, who had struggled to keep the ball 
for most of the opening hour, winds up with a 53/47 advantage in possession, 
boosted no doubt by the hosts playing the final quarter hour with 10 men after 
Korb was sent off.

Full-time: Borussia Mönchengladbach 1-1 Celtic

And there’s the final whistle and 10-man Borussia Mönchengladbach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiamoenchengladbach> hang on for a 
point against Celtic, who pushed for a winner right up until the end but were 
unable to end a winless run away from home in European play that’s now extended 
to 10 matches.

90 min+1: We’re into stoppage time as Celtic’s hopes of making it out of the 
group hang in the balance with Gladbach down a man. Can they push through for a 
chance here?

87 min: Roberts ... to McGregor ... he’s onside with only the keeper to beat 
... and McGregor bottles it! Oh dear. That was Celtic’s chance and it was 
misfired by McGregor, missing the far post by the slimmest of margins. How 
costly that may prove.

86 min: Henderson doesn’t wait long to make his presence felt, ripping a shot

81 min: Gladbach make their final switch as Raffael comes on for the 
goal-scorer Stindl, who cedes the captain’s armband as he walks off. And Rafael 
makes an immediate impact! He’s taken a free kick that pinsCeltic

later has a goal on goal that misses the target but doesn’t keep him from 
raising his arms in an effort to stoke the home supporters, who are already in 
full throat.

62 min: The end-to-end action has picked up over the past several minutes with 
a series of threats from both sides. Hazard blasts a chance from a tight angle 
that’s redirected over the frame by Gordon. That gives another corner to 
Gladbach, but it’s easily cleared.

57 min: A couple more corners for Gladbach but neither of Hazard’s efforts 
create much trouble for Gordon. Then a bad giveaway byCeltic

Fabian Johnson, but the American’s shot toward the far post that beats the 
keeper trickles just wide right.

The referee blows the whistle for half-time. Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> will need something over the 
remaining 45 minutes to sustain their flickering hopes of advancing. Here’s a 
look at the stats so far.

43 min: Celtic win their first corner after a quick attack up the right side 
is broken up by a Gladbach defender inside the area. Sinclair’s effort sails a 
bit too far and is easily cleared past the halfway line, butCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have possession and will try to 
build up from the rear once more. They’d really been doing better right up 
until the Gladbach goal.

39 min: A rapid Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
counter-attack is broken up with a timely challenge and just as quickly 
Gladbach are back down the pitch and threatening again. Now Vestergaard has a

GOAL! Borussia Mönchengladbach 1-0 Celtic (Stindl, 32 min)

A good spell of possession as the Gladbach players probe the Celtic defense 
before an entry pass from the right flank finds an onrushing Stindl, whose 
volley overcomes a slight deflection to beat Gordon for the opening goal. A 
fourth goal for the captain this year including two in the group, both against
Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>.

20 min: Another positive build-up for Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> but they’re dispossessed and 
Gladbach are quick to counter, demanding a save from Gordon on a Stindl shot. 
Hahn misses on the follow-up. Best chance of the match for either side so far.

6 min: Patient, controlled build-up for Gladbach from the back. It’s worked up 
the left flank before it’s swung over Hazard, who tries to break down his

Hello and welcome to the Champions League group-stage clash between Borussia 
Mönchengladbach <https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiamoenchengladbach> 
and Celtic. Tonight represents a moment of truth for Brendan Rodgers’ side if 
they hope to see through any European dreams. They’re currently bottom of Group 
C with one point through three matches and desperately need a victory away from 
home to climb past Gladbach (on four points) into third.

On a lighter note, the Bundesliga side have posted this on their official 
Twitter feed in response to thenow famous sign outside a Glasgow pub <http://

Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s why Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are missing some key players for 
the game in Germany:

Rodgers acknowledged the difficulty of keeping a squad together for any length 
of time. “It’s also the job within the club that we can have this pipeline of 
players, if we lose one or two, that we’re ahead of the game and ensuring we 
can replace them.

“It’ll always be the nature that, no matter how great Celtic is as a club and 
the great support and playing for Celtic being the great privilege it is, there 
are other factors in football that will sometimes take players away and you 
can’t blame a player. I think you have to be realistic, but the idea is to keep 
that pipeline of players coming in.”

Celtic were beaten 2-0 by Mönchengladbach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/celtic-borussia-monchengladbach-champions-league-match-report>
 a fortnight ago with the visitors more than worth their win. “They reinforced 
that they are a very good side even with players missing. The level they are 
developing over the last couple of years is a level we are trying to get to 
over time,” Rodgers said. “I experienced it in the Champions League when I was 
in England. It is a step up even from that, the intensity, the quality, the 
speed.

“We are taking a couple of jumps up to that level. At this level there are 
very few opportunities and you have to take them but while remaining very solid 
and super competitive.”

Moussa Dembélé earns Celtic crucial draw at Borussia Mönchengladbach

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/01/borussia-monchengladbach-celtic-champions-league-match-report> 
That’s all for now! Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure 
to check back shortly for a full match report.
 
Here’s a look at the final stats. Celtic, who had struggled to keep the ball 
for most of the opening hour, winds up with a 53/47 advantage in possession, 
boosted no doubt by the hosts playing the final quarter hour with 10 men after 
Korb was sent off.

Champions League group-stage match. Photograph: ESPN  
And there’s the final whistle and 10-man Borussia Mönchengladbach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiamoenchengladbach> hang on for a 
point against Celtic, who pushed for a winner right up until the end but were 
unable to end a winless run away from home in European play that’s now extended 
to 10 matches.
 
90 min+1: We’re into stoppage time as Celtic’s hopes of making it out of the 
group hang in the balance with Gladbach down a man. Can they push through for a 
chance here?
 
88 min: Kramer is shown yellow for a high boot on Henderson. He’ll miss the 
next match as a result.
 
87 min: Roberts ... to McGregor ... he’s onside with only the keeper to beat 
... and McGregor bottles it! Oh dear. That was Celtic’s chance and it was 
misfired by McGregor, missing the far post by the slimmest of margins. How 
costly that may prove.
 
86 min: Henderson doesn’t wait long to make his presence felt, ripping a shot 
when ceded a bit of real estate along the edge of the area. But it fails to 
curve as much as needed to pose a serious threat and instead skids well wide of 
the far post for a goal kick.
 
83 min: Now Rodgers makes his final swap as Gamboa exits to make way for Liam 
Handerson.
 
81 min: Gladbach make their final switch as Raffael comes on for the 
goal-scorer Stindl, who cedes the captain’s armband as he walks off. And Rafael 
makes an immediate impact! He’s taken a free kick that pinsCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> onto the back foot and moments 
later has a goal on goal that misses the target but doesn’t keep him from 
raising his arms in an effort to stoke the home supporters, who are already in 
full throat.
 
78 min: Some extracurriculars between Herrmann and Izaguirre near the 
touchline and both men are shown yellow for their trouble.

 
77 min: An immediate change for Mönchengladbach as Jantschke comes on for 
Strobl.
 
Dembélé calmly deposits the penalty and they’re back on level terms at 
Borussia-Park!
 
75 min: Dembélé is pulled down by Julian Korb as he sprints onto Roberts’ pass 
and the Portuguese referee Manuel de Sousa has given a penalty. And he’s sent 
off Korb with a straight red! What a development!
 
70 min: Twenty minutes from full time and the possession is 50/50, though the 
stats would indicate Gladbach have made more of their spells with the ball.
 
69 min: A second substitution for Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> as McGregor comes in for Rogic. 
Gladbach answer immediately with their first switch as Hazard exits to make way 
for Patrick Herrmann.
 
68 min: Now a breakaway for Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> against the run of play as 
Sinclair finds Roberts, who gives to Dembélé. But the Frenchman’s shot is 
parried away by Sommer.
 
67 min: Raffael appears to be readying to come on.

<https://twitter.com/UEFAcomMattH/status/793559865952174080>  
66 min: Hahn receives the perfectly played pass from Stindl and rattles the 
woodwork with a curling effort that so nearly doubles Gladbach’s advantage!
 
64 min: Some miscommunication near the back for the hosts as Roberts very 
nearly pounces on a lackadaisical back pass by Wendt, but Sommer arrives in the 
nick of time to wipe out the threat.
 
62 min: The end-to-end action has picked up over the past several minutes with 
a series of threats from both sides. Hazard blasts a chance from a tight angle 
that’s redirected over the frame by Gordon. That gives another corner to 
Gladbach, but it’s easily cleared.
 
60 min: Rodgers makes his first chance as Patrick Roberts enters for Forrest 
at the hour mark.
 
57 min: A couple more corners for Gladbach but neither of Hazard’s efforts 
create much trouble for Gordon. Then a bad giveaway byCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> leads to an immediate chance for 
Fabian Johnson, but the American’s shot toward the far post that beats the 
keeper trickles just wide right.
 
53 min: A ball is played through to Stindl and the crowd swells, but he can’t 
put enough on the shot and it’s easily corralled by Gordon.
 
50 min: Hazard races up the right side with the ball and his cross toward the 
far post is misjudged by the keeper and curves dangerous close toward the goal, 
but instead veers out for a goal kick.
 
48 min: Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> with the first 
half-chance of the half as Armstrong attempts to play a cross into Sinclair, 
but it’s cleared from danger.
 
46 min: We’re off and running in the second half.
 
The referee blows the whistle for half-time. Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> will need something over the 
remaining 45 minutes to sustain their flickering hopes of advancing. Here’s a 
look at the stats so far.
 Mönchengladbach lead 1-0 over Celtic at half-time of their Champions League 
group-stage match. Illustration: ESPN  
43 min: Celtic win their first corner after a quick attack up the right side 
is broken up by a Gladbach defender inside the area. Sinclair’s effort sails a 
bit too far and is easily cleared past the halfway line, butCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have possession and will try to 
build up from the rear once more. They’d really been doing better right up 
until the Gladbach goal.
 
39 min: A rapid Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
counter-attack is broken up with a timely challenge and just as quickly 
Gladbach are back down the pitch and threatening again. Now Vestergaard has a 
go on goal but misses the target.
 
36 min: Borussia-Park is rollicking now as the hosts win another corner. 
They’ve had eight attempts on goal to Celtic’s one, with six corners to the 
visitors’ zero.
 
A good spell of possession as the Gladbach players probe the Celtic defense 
before an entry pass from the right flank finds an onrushing Stindl, whose 
volley overcomes a slight deflection to beat Gordon for the opening goal. A 
fourth goal for the captain this year including two in the group, both against
Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>.

29 min: As we approach the half-hour mark, Gladbach have had the better 
chances but are no doubt itching to break through for a goal amid a drought 
that’s seen them go scoreless over their last four league matches.
 
24 min: A ripping shot by Scott Sinclair from inside the area and he’s denied 
by the far post! How closeCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
were to an opener there!
 
20 min: Another positive build-up for Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> but they’re dispossessed and 
Gladbach are quick to counter, demanding a save from Gordon on a Stindl shot. 
Hahn misses on the follow-up. Best chance of the match for either side so far.
 
17 min: Hazard, who’s been excellent today so far, sends a shot soaring over 
the crossbar off the Gladbach corner.Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> will look to build it up from the 
back off the goal kick.
 
16 min: Another corner for the hosts as a marauding Hahn’s cross into the area 
is cleared behind theCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
defense.
 
13 min: Celtic enjoying a sustained spell of possession here, but they’re 
dispossessed and Gladbach continue to dominate possession without necessarily 
creating many chances.
 
9 min: Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have been active 
in the attack with Sinclair and Forrest up top, but it’s Gladbach who have had 
the run of play and the early chances.
 
7 min: Hazard’s first corner is cleared past the goal line and Gladbach have 
another corner. This one is overcooked a bit and cleared down the pitch from 
the far post.
 
6 min: Patient, controlled build-up for Gladbach from the back. It’s worked up 
the left flank before it’s swung over Hazard, who tries to break down his 
defender. Instead it goes out for a corner.
 
4 min: Mönchengladbach win the first corner of the match, but Hazard’s effort 
is easily cleared.
 
3 min: The first chance of the game is Gladbach’s as a player is fouled 
outside the area. The ball falls to Wendt after the initial free kick but his 
offering is wide left of the target.
 
1 min: And they’re off! The hosts wearing their all-black third kits attacking 
from left to right whileCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
are in their traditional home strips going from right to left.
 
Celtic fans are making themselves heard with an old standard. Kickoff only a 
few minutes away.

Hello and welcome to the Champions League group-stage clash between Borussia 
Mönchengladbach <https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiamoenchengladbach> 
and Celtic. Tonight represents a moment of truth for Brendan Rodgers’ side if 
they hope to see through any European dreams. They’re currently bottom of Group 
C with one point through three matches and desperately need a victory away from 
home to climb past Gladbach (on four points) into third.

On a lighter note, the Bundesliga side have posted this on their official 
Twitter feed in response to thenow famous sign outside a Glasgow pub <http://
