According to figures published by Chinese research agency Entbot 
<http://english.entgroup.cn/642658/>, Rogue One made a total of $30.6m on its 
first weekend, a drop of 57% fromForce Awakens’ opening result of $53.6m 
<http://english.entgroup.cn/631832/>, which was released in a near-identical 
calendar slot in 2016.

A number of factors are thought to be at play: not only has the Chinese box 
office stagnated in 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/01/china-limit-on-imported-films-relaxed-amid-box-office-downturn>
, with growth falling well short of expectations, but the Star Wars series has 
less traction in the country than in other areas of the world (the figures for 
Force Awakens were themselves considered somewhat disappointing).

However, the inclusion of China-audience friendly stars, such as Donnie Yen 
and Jiang Wen,as well as a huge screenings schedule 
<http://deadline.com/2017/01/rogue-one-crosses-900-million-china-sing-passengers-dangal-international-box-office-weekend-1201880724/>
 (some 89,000 per day, more than double the runner-up, homegrown romcom Some 
Like It Hot), appear not to have paid dividends.

China’s new year season – this year, in early February – is prime filmgoing 
territory, but is reserved for locally produced films, with Hollywood 
blockbusters forced to jostle for space in the weeks beforehand. Rogue One’s 
run in cinemas – likely to be the standard four weeks given to overseas films – 
will be hampered even further by the arrival of Passengers, the Jennifer 
Lawrence/Chris Pratt space romance, released inChina

Record-breaking levels of pollution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/21/smog-refugees-flee-chinese-cities-as-airpocalypse-blights-half-a-billion>
 have also been cited as a reason that Chinese audiences may be staying at home.
