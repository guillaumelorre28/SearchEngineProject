On the eve of the biggest match in their history, Cheltenham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cheltenham> Town's training ground has 
been burgled.

Thieves struck on Sunday morning at the club's training ground in the Swindon 
Village area of Cheltenham, stealing wallets, watches and mobile phones worth 
thousands of pounds. On Monday night, the League Two club take onEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> in the FA Cup third-round.

The Cheltenham striker Darryl Duffy took to Twitter to vent his frustration at 
the theft of his mobile phone and said he would buy it back given the chance. 
He wrote: "It was stolen from me, it's white and has all my pics/videos of my 
kids in it so it means a lot to me. Cannot stand thieves."

Between 10.45am and midday on Sunday, thieves entered the training rooms at 
the site. Keys to two vehicles parked outside were also taken and the cars 
entered. Wallets were taken from inside.

The thefts were reported to Gloucestershire Police at 12.30pm and at around 
4pm officers arrested two 17-year-old boys on suspicion of theft. They have 
been bailed to return to Cheltenham police station on 13 February.

A police spokeswoman said: "Some of the stolen items have been recovered. 
Police are appealing for witnesses and ask anyone with information about the 
thefts to call Gloucestershire Police."

An away tie at either Bolton or Sunderland is the reward for the victors of 
Monday's tie.
