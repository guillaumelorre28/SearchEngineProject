Gordon Brown's much-derided economic growth forecast for this year has won the 
backing of one of the country's top think-tanks .

 The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said today that it 
continued to expect gross domestic product to expand by 1 per cent this year 
after last year's 2.5 per cent.

 This is in line with the range of 1 to 1.5 per cent predicted by the 
Chancellor in his pre-Budget report in November but at odds with Wednesday's 
Institute for Fiscal Studies report, which predicted GDP growth this year of 
just 0.4 per cent.

 Mr Brown's forecast, could be lowered in the forthcoming Budget if domestic 
data reveals a sharp deterioration in the economy's performance or the global 
economy takes another turn for the worse.

 The institute said that, while overall economic output would continue to rise 
this year, there would be a full blown recession in manufacturing, which would 
contract by 1.5 per cent in 1999. Nevertheless, it expected the rise in 
unemployment across the economy to be limited to 100,000 because of the 
relative shallowness of the downturn.

 The institute predicted that the cost of borrowing would fall from 6 per cent 
to 5 per cent by the end of the year and to below 4 per cent in 2001.
