Newcastle United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited> have 
agreed a deal to sign Rennes midfielder Sylvain Marveaux. The 25-year-old will 
formally complete a Bosman free transfer move to St James' Park on 1 July after 
signing a five-year deal.

Marveaux had been heavily tipped to move to Liverpool this summer, although 
reports suggested the deal had broken down because of a problem with his 
medical. The former France Under-21 international has been out of action since 
November with a groin injury suffered during a 2-1 Ligue 1 victory over Brest.

Newcastle have carried out their own checks and are confident that will not be 
an issue, and have sealed their third close-season signing.

"It's a great coup to have signed Sylvain, who has received interest from a 
number of other clubs," the Newcastle manager, Alan Pardew, said.

"He may not be well known to many of our fans, but he is a real talent and a 
player we have been keeping an eye on for some time. "It's been a good couple 
of days for us on the transfer front."

Marveaux is a left-sided midfielder and the third Frenchman to move to 
Tyneside in the last year after Hatem Ben Arfa and recent signing Yohan Cabaye.

The confirmation of his signing comes just a day after Newcastle unveiled 
Senegal striker Demba Ba as their second summer arrival, following in Cabaye's 
wake.

His signing will help to offset the loss of captain Kevin Nolan, who joined 
West Ham in a move understood to amount to Â£4m on Thursday, while Alan Smith 
has also been told he can leave.

With Joey Barton having been informed that he will not be offered a new 
contract, there are suggestions that he too will be sold this summer rather 
than be allowed to leave for free when his current deal expires in 12 months' 
time.
