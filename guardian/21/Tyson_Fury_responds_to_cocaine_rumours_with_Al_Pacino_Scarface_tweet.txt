Tyson Fury <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tyson-fury> has posted a cryptic 
tweet amid reports of a positive test for cocaine, putting his head on the body 
of Al Pacino’s Tony Montana, one of the actor’s most famous roles.

So far, the world heavyweight champion’s camp has refused to comment on the 
claims from ESPN, but the fighter, who has 470,000 followers on Twitter, shared 
an image from the filmScarface, which shows the main character, Montana, 
sitting with a pile of cocaine on a table in front of him. Fury superimposed 
his face on to the picture, with the hashtag #Tysonmontana, which did little to 
clear up the confusion surrounding the reports.

On Friday, ESPN reported that Fury’s A sample from a random urine test had 
tested positive for the substance benzoylecgonine, the central compound found 
in cocaine. The sample was given on 22 September, in Lancaster, through the 
Voluntary Anti‑Doping Association.

A spokesman for Fury’s promoter, Hennessy Sports, declined to discuss the ESPN 
claims and Vada said they would not be commenting on the story and that they 
“do not release results publicly unless requested by the athlete”. A Ukad 
spokesperson said: “UK Anti-Doping will not discuss or disclose information 
relating to cases until due legal process has been completed.”

Last week, Fury, who holds the WBA and WBO world titles, pulled out of his 
proposed rematch with Wladimir Klitschko, arranged for 29 October, with his 
camp citing mental health issues.
