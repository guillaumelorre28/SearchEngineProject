Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> made sure 
they will go into the Bundesliga winter break in top spot after beating 
promoted Ingolstadt to bounce back from their first league defeat.

Second-half goals from Robert Lewandowski and Philipp Lahm lifted Bayern, who 
lost to Borussia Mönchengladbach last week,

 on to 43 points, eight ahead of Borussia Dortmund, who play Eintracht 
Frankfurt on Sunday, with one more match left before the one-month break. The 
Bavarians, who won the league 17 times out of the previous 20 they had finished 
top at the halfway mark, struggled for more than an hour against the gutsy 
visitors.

Without the injured wingers Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben it was captain Lahm 
who went close, failing to beat Ramazan Ozcan in a one-on-one early in the 
second-half as Bayern upped the tempo. Lewandowski was also denied by Ozcan, 
but the Poland forward latched on to a defence-splitting pass from Jérôme 
Boateng in the 65th minute and flicked the ball past the keeper and in off the 
post for his 15th goal of the season.

Lahm made amends for his earlier miss, drilling in Bayern’s second goal from a 
Thomas Müller assist 10 minutes later.
