Labour will lead the next Welsh government after a deal with the nationalists 
Plaid Cymru was brokered to end anunprecedented week-long deadlock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/12/welsh-labour-plaid-cymru-accusations-assembly-standoff>
 and it accepted it would have to work in a more inclusive way.

Carwyn Jones will remain first minister but his anointment threatened to be 
overshadowed by a sexism row afterUkip’s leader at the assembly, the former 
Tory MP Neil Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/ukip-group-neil-hamilton-elected-lead-welsh-assembly-wales>
, branded two senior female assembly members “political concubines” and called 
Plaid a “cheap date”.

Welsh Labour failed to win a majority at the assembly elections 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/labour-wales-plaid-cymru-takes-rhondda-plaid-cymru>
 and Plaid, the second biggest party, put forward its leader, Leanne Wood, as a 
candidate for first minister against Jones.

Thanks to mischievous support for Wood from the Tories and Ukip – Plaid’s 
sworn enemies – the pair tied and the people ofWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> faced having to return to the polls if 
the impasse remained.

Following days of talks between Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> and Plaid, the parties reached 
agreement and, subject to the Queen’s approval, Jones will lead a minority 
government.

Hamilton branded it the “coronation of King Carwyn” and claimed the deal made 
Plaid a “very cheap date”.

He was accused of sexism after calling Wood and the Liberal Democrat Kirsty 
Williams – who backed Jones last week – “political concubines in Carwyn’s 
harem”.

Williams tweeted: “The blatant sexist language was bad enough but Neil 
Hamilton actually talked about dodgy deals with a straight face.”

While an MP, Hamilton faced allegations that he took cash for asking 
parliamentary questions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1996/oct/01/conservatives.uk>, which he 
has always denied.

The Welsh Conservative leader, Andrew RT Davies, said it was “groundhog day” 
and Plaid, which has worked in coalition with Labour in the past, had fallen in 
line with Labour.


Wood, however, made it clear her party was not part of a coalition. She pulled 
no punches when she accused Labour, which has been in government in Wales since 
1999, of arrogantly believing it was entitled to power.

The Plaid leader said her party was “allowing” Jones’s election as first 
minster but was not supporting him and would oppose and challenge Labour when 
it disagreed. “We intend to be an opposition. We are prepared to use our mettle 
if and when that is needed,” she said.

Jones made it clear within the debating chamber and outside it that Labour 
would operate in a new way in this fifth assembly. On Twitter he said: “We have 
no doubt about the responsibilities on us, and the responsibility upon me in 
particular, to work with others.”

In the Senedd, Jones said that for the fifth time in a row the Welsh people 
had asked Labour to form the next government.

But he added: “For the fifth time in a row they have said: ‘Proceed, but with 
caution and humility.’ Because we have no majority. Of that we are acutely 
aware … No one party has a monopoly on good ideas, and I want this assembly to 
be more open and more confident than the last.”

He said the priorities for the first 100 days would include a “relentless 
focus on securing a successful and sustainable future” for the steel industry 
and campaigning “vociferously” for the UK to remain in the EU.

A key plank of the agreement with Plaid – called A Compact to Move Wales 
Forward – is the establishment of three liaison committees on finance, 
legislation and the constitution. Jones said these would comprise a Labour 
minister and aPlaid Cymru <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/plaid-cymru> 
representative and would be staffed by the civil service.

Offering an olive branch to the other parties, Jones said the government would 
not bring forward any new legislation in the first 100 days, giving political 
groups in the assembly time to establish “a new way of doing law-making in 
Wales”.

He said that when the time was right the government would introduce a new 
public health bill and, on a cross-party basis, a law to remove the defence of 
“reasonable chastisement” – smacking.

Jones concluded: “Wales does not want for ambition. Wales does not want for 
brilliance. And if the last few days are anything to go by, Wales does not want 
for excitement either. It is our job, collectively, to make real that ambition. 
To turn that brilliance into sustainable success and growing prosperity for 
all. And where we have excitement, let’s make sure it comes with results.

“We have given the media, the Welsh historians and the commentariat plenty of 
what they want – theatre and intrigue. It is time now to give the Welsh people 
what they want and expect: good governance, delivery and respect.”
