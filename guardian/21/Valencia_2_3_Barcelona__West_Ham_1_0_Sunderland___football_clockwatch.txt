So, another bonkers afternoon of football in the Premier League, Football 
League and beyond. Arsenal go top, momentarily at least, and Stoke move two 
points clear of the relegation zone. In the Championship, Newcastle have moved 
three points clear at the top while Aston Villa are just six points of the 
playoffs after their latest victory. Match reports and reaction will follow in 
this blog. Until then, thank for your company, emails and tweets. Bye!

Full-time result: Valencia 2-3 Barcelona

Barça snatch it late on courtesy of a late, late Lionel Messi penalty. Alves, 
the Valencia goalkeeper came close but not close enough to keeping it out. The
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> players are duly 
pelted with all sorts from the crowd. Valencia’s players are given a huge 
ovation as they walk off the pitch, a fine performance despite the result.

And surely a last-minute winner for Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> and Lionel Messi at the 
Mestalla! Luis Enrique’s side trailed 2-1 but they’ve come back and the 
Argentinian slots home from the spot to win it.

Some big goals in the Championship: Matt Ritchie’s made it plain sailing, if 
it wasn’t already, for Newcastle at St James’ Park. A fine finish, with the 
outside of his boot puts the hosts 3-0 up against Ipswich Town. And Steve Bruce 
could yet be celebrating his second win in just a few days. Jonathan Kodjia, 
potentially the Championship’s record-signing, has scored his fourth goal of 
the season to put Aston Villa one-up at home to Fulham.

GOAL! Leicester City 3-0 Crystal Palace (Fuchs)

Game, set and match you would think now at the King Power Stadium. And in some 
style, too. Christian Fuchs, the Leicester full-back scores with a thunderous 
effort. The defender sends an unstoppable half-volley at goal and gets the 
deserved reward. A real screamer.

Good point, well made. “Still confused about a current trend amongst 
footballers in the top leagues not wearing their kits underneath all those 
sponsor emblazoned warmups,” emails James Thomas. “Were I named to a top tier 
European bench, I’d be showing up at the pitch having slept in the bloody 
thing. I’d be ready in about 2.2 seconds if the gaffer pointed at me. What the 
heck?” While finding myself nodding in agreement, Sheffield United have 
levelled against Bradford at Valley Parade. It’s now 3-3.

In La Liga, Valencia have levelled against Barcelona! Munir has found the net 
with a powerful drive on the edge of the box. Moments before, the visitors hit 
the post through the substitute Ivan Rakitic. The Croatian midfielder, who 
replaced Andres Iniesta in the first-half, hit his effort against the woodwork 
after Neymar’s initial effort was saved by Alves in theValencia

GOAL! Leicester City 2-0 Crystal Palace (Okazaki)

Shinji Okazaki smashes home inside the box to double the lead for Leicester at 
the King Power Stadium, where Jamie Vardy remains on the substitutes bench. If 
Claudio Ranieri’s side can continue to fend off Palace here, then it’ll be 20 
games on the bounce in the league unbeaten at home ...

Meanwhile it’s one-way traffic at Hull, where Stoke almost had a third goal 
but for the gloves of David Marshall. Elsewhere, Reading have missed a penalty 
at Rotherham, after Lee Camp saved Garath McCleary’s effort. And, Yeovil lead 
at Crewe through Matty Dolan.

Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> players are duly 
pelted with all sorts from the crowd. Valencia’s players are given a huge 
ovation as they walk off the pitch, a fine performance despite the result.

And surely a last-minute winner for Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> and Lionel Messi at the 
Mestalla! Luis Enrique’s side trailed 2-1 but they’ve come back and the 
Argentinian slots home from the spot to win it.
 
With games elsewhere signed, sealed and delivered, thank goodness for Barcelona

down and they have a last-minute penalty at Valencia ...

Bad news for Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>? The 
club have released a statement regarding their captain, Andrés Iniesta. The 
Spaniard was withdrawn after 14 minutes at the Mestalla.

“The first team player Andrés Iniesta has injured the lateral collateral 
ligament in his right knee,” reads the statement. “When he arrives in Barcelona 
the player will have more tests to find out the exact extent of the injury.” 
They are still playing atValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>, where it’s still 2-2 and 
Lionel Messi’s been booked. As you were.
 
Heartbreak for Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> 
and David Moyes. Winston Reid, the West Ham defender, collects the ball on the 
edge of the box and smashes a low left-footed shot into the corner. Elsewhere, 
Arsenal have the ball in the net through Mesut Özil but the Germany midfielder 
is miles offside.

In the Championship, two very late goals. Huddersfield have a stoppage-time 
winner through Elias Kachunga and Bristol City have taken the lead against 
Blackburn Rovers through skipper Aaron Wilbraham. “There’s only one Bristol 
City,” emails Nancy.
 
It’s his second of the afternoon, but this is surely the winner? 

Elsewhere, another goal for Bristol Rovers and it’s another Chelsea loanee. 
This time it’s defender Jake Clarke-Salter.
 
In the Championship, Reading, without a win in four, are 1-0 up at Kenny 
Jackett’s Rotherham. Paul McShane has got the goal at the New York Stadium. 
Elsewhere, Norwich City still trail Preston 1-0 at Carrow Road.
 
Surely only a consolation striker for Palace? Yohan Cabaye guides a low ball 
from Wilfried Zaha beyond Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.
 
Barcelona are back level at the Mestalla! Luis Suárez equalises for Barça and 
the substitute Rakitic is involved once more. The Croatian’s header is saved by 
Alves but the Uruguayan striker is there to fire home the rebound. 2-2. Game on!
 
Some big goals in the Championship: Matt Ritchie’s made it plain sailing, if 
it wasn’t already, for Newcastle at St James’ Park. A fine finish, with the 
outside of his boot puts the hosts 3-0 up against Ipswich Town. And Steve Bruce 
could yet be celebrating his second win in just a few days. Jonathan Kodjia, 
potentially the Championship’s record-signing, has scored his fourth goal of 
the season to put Aston Villa one-up at home to Fulham.
 
Game, set and match you would think now at the King Power Stadium. And in some 
style, too. Christian Fuchs, the Leicester full-back scores with a thunderous 
effort. The defender sends an unstoppable half-volley at goal and gets the 
deserved reward. A real screamer.

Barcelona are behind in La Liga! Valencia have taken the lead at the Mestalla 
through Rodrigo, after a fine pass from Nani, the former Manchester United 
winger. 56 minutes on the clock there.
 
Newcastle are two goals to the good against Ipswich! Pérez, with his second of 
the afternoon. Elsewhere, Kemar Roofe, who scored goals for fun last year, has 
bagged his first goal of the season to give Leeds United the lead at Wolves.
 
Good point, well made. “Still confused about a current trend amongst 
footballers in the top leagues not wearing their kits underneath all those 
sponsor emblazoned warmups,” emails James Thomas. “Were I named to a top tier 
European bench, I’d be showing up at the pitch having slept in the bloody 
thing. I’d be ready in about 2.2 seconds if the gaffer pointed at me. What the 
heck?” While finding myself nodding in agreement, Sheffield United have 
levelled against Bradford at Valley Parade. It’s now 3-3.
 
More goals in the Football League: Brighton have taken the lead at Wigan 
through Dale Stephens. Barnsley have doubled their lead at Brentford through 
striker Sam Winnall and Barnet are ahead at Wycombe.
 
In La Liga, Valencia have levelled against Barcelona! Munir has found the net 
with a powerful drive on the edge of the box. Moments before, the visitors hit 
the post through the substitute Ivan Rakitic. The Croatian midfielder, who 
replaced Andres Iniesta in the first-half, hit his effort against the woodwork 
after Neymar’s initial effort was saved by Alves in theValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> goal. Neymar’s been booked, 
too. It’s all happening!
 
Shinji Okazaki smashes home inside the box to double the lead for Leicester at 
the King Power Stadium, where Jamie Vardy remains on the substitutes bench. If 
Claudio Ranieri’s side can continue to fend off Palace here, then it’ll be 20 
games on the bounce in the league unbeaten at home ...

Meanwhile it’s one-way traffic at Hull, where Stoke almost had a third goal 
but for the gloves of David Marshall. Elsewhere, Reading have missed a penalty 
at Rotherham, after Lee Camp saved Garath McCleary’s effort. And, Yeovil lead 
at Crewe through Matty Dolan.
 
Yannick Bolasie’s opened his account in Everton colours with a timely goal at 
Turf Moor. The Congolese winger drilled home from close range, after Ben Mee 
found himself the wrong side of Romelu Lukaku. Meanwhile, Plymouth are back in 
front at Newport in League Two. It’s 2-1 there now.
 
At the Emirates, Victor Valdes has just made a fine save to deny Arsenal’s 
Alexis Sánchez the opener. It’s still 0-0, for the time being at least:

The Beast has scored in League Two! Not you, Adebayo Akinfenwa. Jon Parkin’s 
levelled for Newport County at home to league leaders Plymouth Argyle. It’s 1-1 
now at Rodney Parade.
