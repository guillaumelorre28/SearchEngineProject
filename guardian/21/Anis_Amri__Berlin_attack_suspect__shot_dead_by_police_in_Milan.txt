Anis Amri, the Tunisian suspect believed to be behind Monday’s terror attack 
on a Christmas market in Berlin, has been shot and killed by police in Milan, 
the Italian interior minister has confirmed.

“The man killed was without a shadow of doubt Anis Amri,” said Marco Minniti, 
the interior minister.

Amri was stopped by two police officers in a routine check in the Sesto San 
Giovanni neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city and was asked for his 
documents, according to Minniti.

He reached into his backpack, pulled out a gun and a shootout ensued in which 
Amri was killed, Minniti said. One officer was also injured and was recovering 
in hospital.

While there were few other confirmed details of the shooting, there were 
multiple Italian reports that Amri was the first to shoot. A 36-year-old 
officer named Cristian Movio sustained a non-life threatening wound to his 
shoulder. Another officer, Luca Scatà, a 29-year-old who had been on the job 
for nine months, then shot and killed the suspected terrorist.

Paolo Gentiloni, Italy’s prime minister, said he alerted German chancellor 
Angela Merkel to the news of Amri’s death early on Friday morning.

“Our attention is high, threats should not be underestimated, but what 
happened last night, I think, allows all of our fellow citizens to know that 
the state is present, andItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> is 
present,” Gentiloni said.

Both Gentiloni and Minniti issued high praise for the officers who confronted 
Amri and killed him. Minniti said he told the wounded officer that “Italians 
will be able to have a happier holiday. All of Italy should be proud of him.”

Minniti added: “It’s not simple to guarantee an adequate level of security 
faced with the threat of terrorism but we are putting everything into it.”

It was a dramatic end to a story that began and ended in Italy, five days 
after Amri drove a lorry carrying 20 tonnes of steel beams into a crowded 
Christmas market in Breitscheidplatz, Berlin’s main public square.

Twelve people, including the Polish lorry driver murdered by Amri and an 
Italian, Fabrizia Di Lorenzo, were killed in the attack, and dozens more were 
injured.

A Czech and an Israeli were among the six female victims. Eight victims were 
German. Among the 45 injured are citizens from Israel, Spain, Britain, Hungary, 
Finland and Lebanon.

Many details are still unclear about Amri’s final hours, including how he 
entered Italy. Several media reports said a ticket had been found on Amri’s 
body that suggested he had just arrived in the Sesto San Giovanni area by train 
from Turin at about 1am. He is believed to have arrived in Turin from France.


Reports initially indicated that Amri had been in a car at the time of his 
confrontation with police, but the shootout appears to have occurred while Amri 
was walking down the street.

Italy was familiar territory to Amri and that may explain why the suspected 
murderer headed back to the country following Monday’s attack. He is believed 
to have arrived in Italy as a migrant, one of tens of thousands of Tunisians 
who entered the country after the Arab spring protests in 2011.

He quickly came to the attention of law enforcement officials. He was 
allegedly involved in several incidents, including a fire at a migrant 
detention facility, and spent several years in prisons in Sicily.

Italian interior minister Marco Minniti says the man killed in a shootout with 
police in Milan on Friday is, without doubt, Anis Amri – video report

In all, he was held in six different prisons on the island, serving three and 
a half years for starting a fire at a refugee centre and making threats, among 
other charges. But Italy apparently recorded no signs that Amri was becoming 
radicalised.

The Italian government has not officially responded to questions about Amri’s 
period in Italy or why he could not be deported following his arrest and 
conviction. But the issue of deportation of migrants who have not been granted 
asylum is a tricky one for Italy, which has criticised the EU for not doing 
enough to support costly deportation efforts.

Gentiloni, who previously served as foreign minister, has only been prime 
minister for nine days. His predecessor, Matteo Renzi, who remains head of the 
Democratic party and is expected to lead the party in early elections next 
year, took to Facebook to issue his congratulations to Italian police forces.

Renzi wrote: “If there’s one thing I’ve learned to appreciate in my thousand 
days in office it is that our men and our women in uniform have extraordinary 
quality and professionalism. They are among the best in the world even if this 
is is not always recognised.”
