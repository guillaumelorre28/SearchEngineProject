Development, and have to work longer than anywhere else before they qualify for 
a state pension.

 once they approach retirement age. A quarter of people about to retire can’t 
afford to give up work and for those who can, 51% would prefer to keep active

flexibility or foresight to adapt employment models for an ageing population.

We’d like to hear from readers about what it’s like being an older person in 
the workforce. Do you worry about how you’ll ever afford to retire? Are you 
eager to slow down but concerned about surviving on your pension? Or, are you 
someone who longs to continue working as long as possible but are concerned 
about a lack of opportunity for you simply because of your age?
