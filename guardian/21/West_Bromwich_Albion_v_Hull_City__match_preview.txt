Both these sides ended 2016 with encouraging results, although the fact West 
Bromwich managed to win 2-1 at Southampton but Hull were pegged back by Everton 
to draw 2-2 tells the story of their respective seasons. Tony Pulis’s side are 
riding high in eighth place and will look to consolidate that today, whereas 
Hull, in 19th, know they need to start winning soon if an instant return to the 
Championship is to be avoided.Paul Chronnell
