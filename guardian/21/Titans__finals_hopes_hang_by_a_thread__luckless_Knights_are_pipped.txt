Gold Coast, however, are sweating on Sunday’s match between the Wests Tigers 
and Canberra to know if they’ll reach the finals for the first time since 2010.


A win for the Tigers at Leichhardt would enable them to leapfrog the Titans 
into eighth spot.


Just like last weekend against Penrith, the Titans made life hard for 
themselves with a slow start to the match.


The Cowboys opened the scoring through Justin O’Neill in the fifth minute when 
he outjumped Josh Hoffman to claim a Lachlan Coote kick.


Jarryd Hayne, playing his second match at fullback for the Titans, then came 
up with a crucial error to allow the Cowboys to extend their lead.


The two-time Dally M medallist appeared to have defused a Cowboys attack but 
spilt a grubber and Antonio Winterstein pounced to open up a 12-0 lead midway 
through the half.


It was a costly error by Hayne, who endured a torrid night in the No1 jersey.


While their superstar recruit wasn’t firing, the Titans resisted a wave of 
Cowboys pressure and managed to get themselves back into the contest by 
halftime.


Winger David Mead, who sat out most of the first half undergoing a head-injury 
assessment after an early collision with Kane Linnett, snared a Nathan Friend 
cross-field kick to put the visitors on the board in the 32nd minute and ensure 
the margin was just six points at halftime.


The Cowboys came out firing in the second half and extended their lead to 20-6 
through a try to Gavin Cooper and a Johnathan Thurston penalty goal.


Ryan James’ 11th try of the season in the 57th minute gave the Titans hope of 
securing the win which would have ensured their finals berth.


Cowboys prop James Tamou’s try put the hosts out beyond two converted tries 
again but the Titans just refused to lie down, Konrad Hurrell running 88 metres 
with an intercept in the 71st minute to give the visitors hope.


A late injury scare to Cowboys captain Thurston threatened to ruin the 
premiers’ night but the Queensland and Australian star recovered to set up 
Cooper for the final try of the match.

Newcastle’s losing streak has been extended to 18, courtesy of a controversial 
28-26 defeat to St George Illawarra.

A dubious penalty against retiring Knights back-rower Jeremy Smith in the 
play-the-ball gave Gareth Widdop the chance to kick an 80th-minute goal at 
Kogarah Oval in the final round of the regular season.

Smith was penalised by referee Henry Perenara for kneeing Kurt Mann in the 
tackle, but it appeared a tough call.

Widdop kicked the 39m penalty goal to give the Dragons a winning end to a 
disappointing season in what could be Benji Marshall’s final first-grade game.

After a shocking 2016, Newcastle will start next season seeking to end the 
worst losing streak in the NRL.

It is the first time since Gold Coast in 1993 that a team has won just one 
game in a season.

It was an entertaining match at Kogarah, punctuated by silly errors from both 
sides.

Marshall led the way for the Dragons and Trent Hodkinson steered Newcastle 
well around the park. But, when the Knights had a field-goal chance late, 
before Widdop’s penalty, the ball wrongly went to Jarrod Mullen.

Newcastle started the game strongly to lead 10-0 after 10 minutes on the back 
of tries to Nathan Ross and Jacob Saifiti.

But the Dragons came storming back scoring four tries in 15 minutes to grab a 
generous lead.

Joel Thompson bagged tries in the 25th and 30th minutes. Jason Nightingale 
helped himself to his first in the 17th minute and Jake Marketo streaked away 
in the 32nd to give the home side a 22-10 halftime lead.

Newcastle started the second half as they did the first. Dane Gagai crossed 
out wide two minutes after the resumption and Peter Mata’utia did likewise five 
minutes later to peg the gap to two points.

Nightingale crossed for his second in the 58th minute before Mitchell 
Barnett’s try and Trent Hodkinson’s conversion in the 73rd minute tied up the 
scores at 26-26 before 8,726 fans.

Neither team used the captain’s challenge, brought in for this game as a 
trial, with both teams out of top-eight contention.
