The two clubs, alongside Hart’s representatives, spent Monday agreeing the 
final terms of the contract, with both City andTorino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> understood to be contributing to 
the 29-year-old’s salary of around £135,00 a week.

Hart is currently with the England squad at St George’s Park but has been 
given permission by the Football Association to fly to Turin on Tuesday to take 
a medical and seal the loan.

The 29-year-old’s decision to leave City has come about after he lost his 
place as the club’s No1 goalkeeper under Pep Guardiola. Hart has started only 
once under Guardiola and was again on the bench forSunday’s 3-1 victory against 
West Ham United at the Etihad Stadium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/28/manchester-city-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report>
, when Willy Caballero also again started. Hart is keen to play regularly and 
was conscious that, if he did not join Torino, his status would drop to third 
choice under Guardiola following last week’sarrival of Claudio Bravo from 
Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/manchester-city-confirm-signing-of-claudio-bravo-from-barcelona>
.

Hart also has his England status to protect. He is in Sam Allardyce’s first 
squad, for the World Cup qualifier against Slovakia on Sunday, but has been 
told by the national team manager that he needs to play on a regular basis to 
remain part of his plans.

Also poised to leave City is Samir Nasri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/samir-nasri>, who is being targeted by 
Besiktas, with a delegation from the Turkish club scheduled to have arrived at 
Luton airport on Monday in the hope of sealing the move. The flight is 
scheduled to return to Turkey at noon on Tuesday and Besiktas are hopeful of 
having the out-of-favour Frenchman with them.

Nasri was banned from training with the first-team squad by Guardiola when he 
returned for pre-season overweight. He then made a surprise substitute 
appearance against West Ham, playing the last 15 minutes. That was the 
29-year-old’s first appearance under Guardiola, who offered an ambivalent 
response after the game when asked about the player’s future. “If you want to 
help us, want to stay, want to be part of something, it depends on him, not 
me,” the manager said.

Meanwhile, Sergio Agüero has pulled out of the Argentina squad with a calf 
injury and will miss the World Cup qualifiers against Uruguay and Venezuela. 
The striker was replaced on 88 minutes on Sunday and City expect to discover 
the extent of the problem later in the week.

Agüero is also likely to discover on Tuesday whether he will be charged by the 
Football Association afterappearing to elbow West Ham’s Winston Reid at the 
weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/28/sergio-aguero-miss-manchester-united-clash>
. A charge and guilty verdict would bring a three-game ban and rule Agüero out 
of the Manchester derby on 10 September.
