St Mirren’s captain Steven Thompson admits he was mortified after a foolish 
prank during a training session left a team-mate with a gaping wound.

Thompson threw a spiked pole at the 20-year-old John McGinn after he robbed 
him of the ball and it struck him on the thigh, causing severe bleeding.

“I’m just mortified by the whole thing,” Thompson told the Scottish Sun on 
Monday. “It was a daft prank. It wasn’t like I threw the pole out of anger or 
anything like that. That’s not what happened.”

McGinn missed the 4-1 Premier League victory over Kilmarnock on Saturday and 
Thompson plans to make amends by giving him his win bonus.

Thompson is no stranger to bizarre injuries himself. Nine years ago, when 
playing for Cardiff, he detached a nerve in his finger when slicing an apple 
while a year later, when on the transfer list, he was forced to undergo major 
groin surgery after failing off a banana boat while on holiday, denying him a 
transfer.
