<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/port-adelaide> after it emerged an AFL 
team-mate was with him when he allegedly crashed into parked cars following a 
weekend pool party.


Impey, who left team-mate Angus Monfries’ party on Saturday and allegedly 
crashed his car into four parked vehicles, has been banned from selection for

Port initially believed Impey was the only person in his car but it has 
emerged Aidyn Johnson, a 19-year-old from Bendigo who is yet to play anAFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> game, was a passenger.

Johnson, recruited by Port in the 2015 national draft, has also been fined 
$5,000 and ruled out of playing in round one against Sydney next year.


Port is under pressure over its handling of the affair given the club waited 
about eight hours between finding Impey and taking him to police.


“These sanctions are based on the information at hand and Port Adelaide will 
make no further comment as the matter is subject to an ongoing police 
investigation,” the club said.


Impey drove away from Monfries’ party at about 7pm Saturday. Police allege 
that he crashed into parked cars, left his own car, keys and mobile phone and 
walked home – some 17 kilometres away.

Port located Impey after midnight but didn’t take him to police until Sunday 
morning.


The 21-year-old has been charged by police with driving without due care, 
failing to exchange particulars and failing to report the collision. He will 
appear in court at a later date.


Impey and Johnson met with Port coach Ken Hinkley and the club’s leadership 
group on Monday. Port said Impey’s $5,000 fine would go to the Brain Injury 
Network of South Australia to support road safety programs.

Impey would also be required to attend a network program where he will witness 
the impact and life-changing circumstances of road trauma.
