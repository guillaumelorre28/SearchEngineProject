In-form Ross County earned three valuable points in the Scottish Premiership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-premiership> after surviving a 
late onslaught fromKilmarnock to win 2-1 at Victoria Park.

The home side were deserved victors, having controlled play for long spells in 
the contest and held the advantage with goals from Michael Gardyne and Craig 
Curran.

However, a late strike from Lee Ashcroft made for a nervy last few minutes for 
the home side, who, nevertheless, held on.

Partick Thistle recorded consecutive league wins for the first time since 
March 2013 with a 1-0 victory overInverness at Firhill.

The Jags claimed their third league win of the season over the visitors in a 
poor contest. A single goal by Steven Lawless, six minutes from time, was 
enough to give them the points, as they gave their survival hopes another boost 
after their convincing win overSt Johnstone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stjohnstone> last week.

St Johnstone eased to a 2-0 victory over St Mirren at McDiarmid Park – a 
result that leaves the visitors four points adrift at the bottom of the 
Premiership table.

A goal in each half from Brian Graham and Steven Anderson, both from assists 
by David Wotherspoon, proved important as Tommy Wright’s team climbed to fifth 
place in the table.

The St Mirren <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stmirren> manager, Gary 
Teale, said that his side needs to get tough if they are to avoid relegation. 
“I feel, over the last couple of weeks, we’ve competed well, but today we got 
bullied right from the start to the finish. St Johnstone deserved their 
victory.”

In the Championship, Hearts won 3-0 at Falkirk and edged closer to sealing the 
title. Jamie Walker scored his 11th goal of the season on 28 minutes after good 
approach play by Osman Sow. Three minutes after the restart, theHearts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts> striker Género Zeefuik doubled 
the lead after a cross from Walker. Substitute James Keatings added a flourish 
to the win when he fired into the top corner of the net with eight minutes 
remaining.

Hearts are two points away from claiming the league title and can win it 
tomorrow if Rangers defeat second-placed Hibs at Easter Road.
