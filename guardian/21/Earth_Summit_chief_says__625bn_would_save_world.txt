THE price of correcting the world's environmental problems is about Dollars 
625 billion ( pounds 350 billion) a year, Maurice Strong, secretary of the UN 
Conference on Environment and Development ( Earth Summit ), said yesterday in 
London. Of this, Dollars 125 billion needs to be transferred from rich to poor 
countries, or an increase of Dollars 70 billion a year in aid programmes.

 The total cost is no more than 3 per cent of the world's gross domestic 
product, Mr Strong said. 'It does not mean that all this money is needed now. 
It is not even practical to start everything at once and it doesn't need to 
involve a massive increase in foreign aid - but if the world's major donors 
even committed one per cent of their GDP we would have more than Dollars 150 
billion immediately.'

 Proposals for the Rio conference in June - described by Mr Strong as a chance 
for the world to redeploy its economic resources to achieve a sustainable 
society - include controlling carbon dioxide emissions to avoid climate change, 
investment in efficient sources of energy, technology transfer to the 
developing countries and anti-poverty programmes.

 Mr Strong warned that the cost of not acting would eventually be far greater 
in economic and environmental terms. 'We need to obviate the major global risks 
and ensure that developing countries do not destroy their environments.'

 Following Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC's environment minister who this week 
strongly attacked agricultural subsidies as being harmful to the environment, 
he said there were billions of dollars just in the agricultural system which at 
present were being used to prevent sustainable development.
