Faroese villagers have slaughtered about 250 pilot whales in the past 24 hours 
according to Sea Shepherd activists monitoring the traditional summer hunts in 
the north Atlantic islands.

The whale pods, which migrate past the islands in July and August, were herded 
by flotillas of small boats on to two beaches where villagers waded into the 
water to kill them with lances.

Seven protesters, mainly from European countries, have been arrested this week 
for allegedly interfering with the the traditional community hunts, known as 
“grindadráp”.

Amsterdam-based direct action group Sea Shepherd, which has 36 people on two 
boats close to the islands and a further 20 supporters on Faroese islands, 
claimed on Friday that the Danish navy was helping the Faroese whalers.

“It was perfectly clear that the Danish navy ships Triton and Knud Rasmussen 
were present to guard one grindadráp, and that the slaughter [only] proceeded 
with the full consent of the Danish navy,” said Wyanda Lublink, captain of the 
Sea Shepherd boat Brigitte Bardot.

“How Denmark – an anti-whaling member nation of the European Union, subject to 
laws prohibiting the slaughter of cetaceans – can attempt to justify its 
collaboration in this slaughter is incomprehensible,” he said.

Footage from the hunt suggests that 111 pilot whales were killed on a beach at 
Nólsoy and a further 142 near the capital Tórshavn.

Whaling <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/whaling> in the Faroes has 
been practised for hundreds of years and is regulated by the Faroese 
authorities. Around 800 pilot whales and some dolphins are killed annually.
