Readers based in the US will start to see the new look site this week - the 
first step towards launch of a fully responsive Guardian website.

The changes started with both US opinion and US arts on Monday 27 October and 
continued today with sport, business and money.

This thread is the place to discuss these changes with members of the project 
team.
