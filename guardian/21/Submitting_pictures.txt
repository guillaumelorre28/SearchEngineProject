You should ensure that your CRN is attached to the Original Transmission 
Reference (OTR) field for each picture you submit. If you are using Adobe 
Photoshop, insert the CRN into the OTR field using the following procedure 
(this must be done for each picture) and send to the appropriatecopywire address

:

1 Select File > File info ...
2 Under Section, choose Origin.
3 Type the CRN into the OTR field.
4 Make any other changes and click on OK.

Should you not have email, your CRN should be displayed prominently on all 
prints. Prints should be sent to your commissioning editor at Guardian News and 
Media Ltd, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

With new GPS and camera technology it is now possible to embed geographical 
locations in the camera File Information fields. GNM requests that this 
technology is disabled or the information removed before filing pictures from 
assignments commissioned by us. It is especially important where identification 
of a source is an issue. It is not enough to pixilate a face; you must make 
sure you are not using a camera with this technology enabled.

If the technology has been enabled on material sent to us on spec, we must be 
notified of this - preferably on the picture caption.
