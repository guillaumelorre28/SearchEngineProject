story has touched off a Twitter confrontation between nuclear powers Pakistan 
and Israel, the latest disturbing incident of fabricated stories having a 
serious impact in the real world.

The exchange of tense public words between two countries with a difficult 
relationship and no diplomatic ties comes the same month that a fake news story 
about a child abuse ringprompted a gunman to fire shots inside a pizza 
restaurant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/05/gunman-detained-at-comet-pizza-restaurant-was-self-investigating-fake-news-reports>
 in Washington.

The spat appeared to have been prompted by the publication of a fake story 
headlined “Israeli Defense Minister: IfPakistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan> send ground troops to Syria on any 
pretext, we will destroy this country with a nuclear attack”.

The story appeared on 20 December on the site AWD News, which has been 
identified by fact-checking organisations as a fake news site.

Snopes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/snopes-com-internet-fact-checker-post-truth-david-mikkelson>
, one of five organisationschosen by Facebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/facebook-flag-fake-news-fact-check>
 to vet questionable stores, said AWD News “doesn’t have more than a nodding 
acquaintance with facts 
<http://www.snopes.com/king-abdullah-ii-kills-queen-rania-in-rome/>, instead 
playing on nationalistic fantasy and conspiracy theory to create alarming … 
stories.”

 The original article mis-identified Israeli minister Moshe Ya’alon.

The article mis-identified Moshe Ya’alon as the Israeli defence minister when 
he actually resigned in May, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/israel-defence-minister-moshe-yaalon-quits-rift-binyamin-netanyahu>
 changed the title of a senior official from the Pakistan government and was 
dotted with grammatical errors and strange syntax.

Undeterred by those warning signs, Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja 
Mohammad Asif, apparently read the article as a genuine threat of a pre-emptive 
nuclear strike and took toTwitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> to warn Israel that “Pakistan 
is a nuclear state too.”

 <https://twitter.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/812370140507545600> 
Israel’s defense ministry responded the next day, also on Twitter, saying the 
original story was “totally fictitious” and the quote had been invented.

Ministry of Defense (@Israel_MOD) 
@KhawajaMAsif <https://twitter.com/KhawajaMAsif> reports referred to by the 
Pakistani Def Min are entirely false

<https://twitter.com/Israel_MOD/status/812662633686069248> 
After the Twitter spat pushed the story into the spotlight, AWD updated it to 
identify Ya’alon as a former defence minister in the body of the text, but left 
the headline unchanged. It continued to mis-identify Tariq Fatemi,special 
assistant to the Pakistani prime minister 
<http://mofa.gov.pk/content.php?pageID=sa>, as minister of state for foreign 
affairs.

There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan to Israel’s response, but Asif 
did take time to direct an oblique message at the New York Times. After the 
paper described his own tweet as a “nuclear threat 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/world/asia/pakistan-israel-khawaja-asif-fake-news-nuclear.html>
”, Asif insisted that Pakistan’s nuclear programme “is only a deterrence”.
Khawaja M. Asif (@KhawajaMAsif) 
Our nuclear prgrm is only a deterrence to protect our freedom.We desire to 
coexist in peace , both in our region & beyond.@nytimes

Pakistan became a nuclear power in 1998. Israel officially neither confirms 
nor denies the existence of an arsenal, but its nuclear programme has been an 
open secret since the 1980s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/truth-israels-secret-nuclear-arsenal>
.

Their dispute is the latest case of fake news, peddled by sites with political 
aims or simply to earn money from advertising, influencing the real world. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/16/fake-news-journalism-digital>

Concern about real world spillover spiked in early December after a man opened 
fire in a pizza restaurant in Washington DC after becoming convinced by fake 
news reports that it was used for child sex abuse.

He claimed he had come to investigate “Pizzagate”, a baseless conspiracy, 
which falsely claims Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta were running a 
child sex ring from the restaurant’s backrooms.

Tech companies have come under increasing pressure 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/19/facebook-fake-news-mark-zuckerberg>
 to roll out changes to attempt to thwart the trend, which hasbecome a global 
problem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/02/fake-news-facebook-us-election-around-the-world>
.

Germany’s political mainstream is getting increasingly nervous about the 
effect that the rise of fake news, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/18/german-courts-should-tackle-fake-news-now-says-minister>
 hacking and misinformation might have on federal elections next autumn, 
particularly since the US election. Many in France are also concerned about the 
possible impact on Presidential elections in the spring.
