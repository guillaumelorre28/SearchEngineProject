Teddy Sheringham could be about to take his first job in management after 
being given permission to speak to Stevenage. There are reports that the former 
England striker has been given the go-ahead by West Ham,where he was appointed 
the attacking coach a year ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/30/teddy-sheringham-returns-west-ham-attacking-coach>
, to talk to the League Two side.

Stevenage <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stevenage> declined to comment 
on the suggestions but Graham Westley’s contract as manager expires imminently 
and he has not received an offer of an extension.

Sheringham, 49, started his career with Millwall and played for Nottingham 
Forest, Tottenham, Manchester United, Portsmouth, West Ham and Colchester 
before retiring at 42. He earned 51 caps for England.

Westley suggested after the play-off loss to Southend last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/14/southend-stevenage-league-two-play-off-match-report>
 that he may not be at Broadhall Way next season.

He said: “We will see where things go from here. I am the Stevenage manager up 
until the end of May. There’s been no offer to me. The club is having a serious 
rethink about what it’s going to do for the future, so we’ll see how that pans 
out.”
