Ten-man Sheffield Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldwednesday> fought hard for their 
2-1 victory over a wasteful Preston side in a bad-tempered clash that ended 
with the visitors having Jermaine Beckford and Eoin Doyle sent off for a clash 
in the final minutes.

Trailing to a goal from Fernando Forestieri, who was himself later dismissed, 
and Steven Fletcher‚Äôs penalty, Preston pulled a goal back through Doyle. But 
any chance of securing a late draw was snuffed out when Beckford and Doyle were 
both shown red cards after an angry exchange between the team-mates off the 
ball.

Their manager, Simon Grayson, later labelled the pair ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù and 
confirmed that the club would take action against them The incident brought 
back memories of Newcastle team-matesLee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer being sent off 
for fighting each other

The Owls created the first big chance, when Adam Reach sent a lofted pass 
forward to Forestieri, who controlled the ball with his chest and drove to the 
edge of the box, but his shot was straight at the goalkeeper, Chris Maxwell. 
Forestieri continued to cause the visitors problems when he had a goal-bound 
effort blocked by Alex Baptiste, but he failed to clear the ball and Kieran 
Lee‚Äôs cross found Reach in space. The left-back‚Äôs mistimed shot then bounced 
favourably for Forestieri, who finished expertly with a headed flick into the 
bottom right corner from a central position.

Callum Robinson went close to levelling the scores immediately, when he fired 
a shot against the post from just outside the area. Wednesday then suffered a 
double injury blow. First, Ross Wallace was forced off in the 27th minute, with 
Will Buckley replacing him. David Jones then came on for Glenn Loovens, after 
the captain had gone down for treatment twice before finally leaving the field 
in the 35th minute, passing the armband on to Tom Lees. Preston continued to 
create chances but failed to convert them, with Westwood comfortably saving two 
efforts from Alan Browne.

At half-time, Browne was substituted along with the former Wednesday player 
Aiden McGeady, as Grayson introduced Beckford and the Belgian full-back Marnick 
Vermijl. Preston had several set-piece opportunities from just outside the area 
after the break. Beckford had one effort disallowed for taking it too quickly, 
while Robinson and Daniel Johnson saw their shots miss the target.

Forestieri was then sent off by the referee, Scott Duncan, in the 65th minute 
following an off-the-ball incident. The home side then suffered their third 
injury, when Lucas Jo√£o took a knock and was replaced in the 74th minute by 
Fletcher. Preston‚Äôs goalkeeper Maxwell brought down Buckley inside the area and 
Fletcher made an immediate impact, side-footing the ball into the bottom right 
corner to double the hosts‚Äô lead with just over 10 minutes remaining.

With Buckley off the field receiving treatment, Preston capitalised on their 
two-man advantage, when the substitute Doyle smashed the ball past Westwood 
into the left side of the net from close range.

With Preston failing to convert their chances, frustration spilled over and 
the referee showed straight red cards to Doyle and Beckford ‚Äì both for violent 
conduct ‚Äì in the 90th minute.
