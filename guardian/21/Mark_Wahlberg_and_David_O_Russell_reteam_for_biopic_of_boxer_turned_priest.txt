<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/03/the-fighter-review>, Mark 
Wahlberg and David O Russell are to reteam for a fourth film: a biopic of an 
athlete who became a priest.

During a Facebook Live post 
<https://www.facebook.com/markwahlberg/videos/10154545548711532/> recorded on 
Wednesday, Wahlberg revealed that the pair were working on a screenplay about 
Father Stuart Long, a former boxer and aspirant actor who found God.

 ‘Tough guy’ … Father Stuart Long 
“David O Russell and I right now are working on developing a script on Father 
Stu,” said Wahlberg, “who was an amazing priest from Helena, Montana.”

He continued: “He was a very tough guy who was a fighter, a football player … 
anything but a spiritual guy. He found his calling, and decided, after falling 
in love with a woman, that he wanted to become a priest. He suffered from this 
horrible muscular degenerative disease but was still ordained as a priest and 
passed away, but not before he was able to inspire thousands upon thousands of 
people.”

Long <http://cal-catholic.com/?p=15331>, who died aged 50 in 2014 of muscular 
degenerative disease, was a promising prize-fighter who turned to acting after 
undergoing reconstructive surgery. But he became disillusioned with the 
industry and, after a serious motorcycle accident, retrained as a priest.

Wahlberg will next been seen in real-life disaster movie Deepwater Horizon

, about the BP oil spill, while Russell is set to make a TV drama series with 
Julianne Moore and another regular collaborator, Robert De Niro.
