Also chosen in the first round was former surf lifesaver Ebony Marionoff, who 
was taken seventh by Adelaide.

Hayley Miller (Fremantle), Jaimee Lambert (Western Bulldogs), Nicola Stevens 
(Collingwood) and Elise O’Dea (Melbourne) rounded out the top eight picks.

Australia cricketer Jess Cameron – one of several women with backgrounds in 
other sports to turn to AFL football – was picked by Collingwood at 75.

WNBL basketballer Lauren Pearce went to Melbourne with the 25th selection.


They join several others from different sports who had already been signed to 
clubs, including another international cricketer Delissa Kimmince, javelin 
thrower Kim Mickle, Opals basketballers Erin Phillips and Jess Bibby and 
Matildas footballer Ellie Brush.

“No words can describe how I’m feeling right now.” said Bates. “It’s so 
exciting to be here and I’m so excited to be part of the historic journey.

“It was a big shock for me (going at No1), but I couldn’t be happier. I think 
GWS are a great club and I can’t wait to get started.”

The eight clubs that will make up the inaugural competition had already 
selected two marquee players, along with a handful of rookies and others under 
priority selection rules.

Following Wednesday’s draft, each club has until the end of the month to 
complete their rosters by topping up with free agents.
