Two blue whales have been seen off the New England coast, in a rare sighting 
of the largest creatures on earth.

Blue Ocean Society for Marine Conversation cofounder Dianna Schulte told 
WMUR-TV <http://bit.ly/2bWLSnt> she was working aboard the Granite State off 
the coast of Rye Harbor, New Hampshire, on Friday when she spotted the whales.

The group’s executive director, Jen Kennedy, said sightings of the animals, 
which can be up to 100ft long, are rare in New England. Spotting two together 
is even rarer.

“To spot two blue whales together is simply unheard of,” she said. “In the 
Atlantic, they are usually sighted off of St Lawrence in Canada.

“We might see a blue whale every five to 10 years, so it was possible, but 
rare. And we’ve never seen two together in our last 20 years of whale watching 
and research off theNew Hampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire> coast.”

Schulte said she planned to send pictures of the whales to researchers in 
Canada, to try to learn more about the two that were spotted.
