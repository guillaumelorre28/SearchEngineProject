Brooks was ruled out for up to five weeks with a knee injury.

Brooks was diagnosed with a torn posterior cruciate ligament after failing to

The club said the 21-year-old was expected to miss three to five weeks in a 
massive blow to their top eight hopes. It could result in NSW hooker Farah 
returning to top grade just two weeks after being dumped by coach Jason Taylor.

Farah missed Saturday’s NSW Cup game with a calf injury but could be recalled 
for his side’s blockbuster clash with premiers North Queensland at Leichhardt 
Oval next Sunday.

Chris Lawrence filled in alongside Mitchell Moses in the halves against the 
Eels. However Taylor didn’t rule out selecting Farah.

“It’s a possibility. It’s just too early,” Tayalor said. “We’ll look at where 
Brooksy’s going to be at and what the best team’s going to be for this week. 
That’ll be completely clean slate in regards to everyone and the team we think 
is going to do the job this week.”

Jack Littlejohn will also come into contention to fill in for Brooks. The 
Tigers sit in 10th spot but are equal on 22 points alongside seventh-placed 
Gold Coast, the Warriors and Penrith, with five games left in the regular 
season.
