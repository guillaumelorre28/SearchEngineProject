The AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> and the players’ union are set 
to resume pay discussions in the hopes of averting a pre-season strike.

Talks between the two parties have stalled over the off-season, with the 
league resisting demands for a percentage of fixed revenue in the new 
collective bargaining agreement.

AFL Players Association chief Paul Marsh says negotiations will resume this 
week, with a strike during next month’s pre-season competition still possible 
if a deal can’t be reached.


“It’s not really appropriate to be talking about the pre-season competition at 
this stage,” Marsh said on Monday. “We want to get things moving. Let’s get 
these talks going and hopefully we can get to a resolution as soon as possible.”

Tension between the two camps grew when AFL chief Gillon McLachlan declined an 
invitation to attend a summit in Torquay last month, with Geelong star Patrick 
Dangerfield describing the move as disrespectful.


Marsh confirmed McLachlan would not be part of the pay talks this week but 
said that was not unusual at this point in the negotiations. “We’ve got working 
parties. Gillon’s not necessarily involved in those,” he said.

AFLPA president and former Fremantle Dockers star Matthew Pavlich last month 
said the league had not taken a constructive approach to the discussions. “When 
we can’t get to the negotiating table and we can’t talk, it sort of leaves us 
scratching our heads a little bit,” Pavlich said.
