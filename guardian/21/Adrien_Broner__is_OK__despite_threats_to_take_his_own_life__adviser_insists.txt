Former four-division title-holder Adrien Broner shared a series of alarming 
posts on social media on Wednesday that suggested he was planning to take his 
own life, though a longtime adviser to the boxer reached by the Guardian 
insists “he’s OK”.

The 27-year-old fighter posted a photo of a handgun inside a vehicle with the 
caption “I’m going home I love y’all” on Instagram. That came hours aftera post 
that simply read <https://www.instagram.com/p/BLd9fmIjziP/>: “3PM I’m doing it 
I’m sorry to my family and friends but I don’t want to be here no more this 
shit too much”.

I'm going home I love y'all 🙏🏾 <https://www.instagram.com/p/BLeGzV8Dg4T/>

TMZ reported that Broner’s friends are “extremely concerned” and at least one 
has contacted police.

But Sam Watson, a longtime confidant to the Cincinnati fighter, insisted that 
Broner “is OK” when reached by phone on Wednesday afternoon.

“He’s OK, he’s OK,” Watson told the Guardian. “I’m not sure what’s going on 
but I talked to him yesterday and he was fine. I’m sure he’s OK.”

Broner’s partner Arienne Gazaway, who goes by Arie Nicole, later communicated 
that the fighter was out of harm’s way in a Snapchat post, writing that “Adrien 
is okay!”

Later Wednesday, the Cincinnati Police department confirmed they had made 
contact with Broner and “all is well”.

Earlier this year Broner was charged with felony assault and robbery at 
gunpoint of a man outside a Cincinnati bowling alley on the morning of 21 
January, where it was alleged the boxer lost $12,000 to the victim during a 
night of high-stakes betting on bowling games. Those charges were dropped last 
month when the accuser and a material witness failed to turn up in court.

Broner served a 10-day jail sentence in April for a violation of his probation 
relating to a reckless driving case from last year. He had previously been 
sentenced to six months’ probation in July relating to a drunken driving 
arrest, later entering a plea of no contest to reckless driving.

Despite those charges, Broner was permitted to fight on 1 April in Washington 
DC on the condition he turned himself in upon return to Ohio. He lost his 
junior welterweight title on the scale after failing to make weight, but scored 
a ninth-round TKO of Ashley Theophane.

Broner, who has held versions of major world title belts at 130lb, 135lb, 
140lb and 147lb, complied by surrendering to authorities three days following 
the fight and was released after posting bond of $100,000.

He’s been inactive since but was reportedly in talks for a title shot in 
February against Scotland’s Ricky Burns, whoretained the WBA’s version of the
