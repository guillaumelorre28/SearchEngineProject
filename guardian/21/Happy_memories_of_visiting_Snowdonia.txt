May I thank the Guardian for rekindling memories of the spring and summer of 
1973 that I spent in Llanberis as a trainee surveyor mainly based in the slate 
quarry? Helen Evans’ picture of Anglesey Barracks on the letters page 
(3 November) brought it all back.

• When are you going to publish a collected edition of Michele Hanson’s wise, 
brilliant and amusing Tuesday columns (A certain age 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/michele-hanson-certain-age>)? 
I’m sure there must be a market of the masses of readers for whom her column is 
the highlight of the G2 week.

• The Guardian cost me €2.50 in my local shop this morning. Any chance you’ll 
revert to the €2 price as sterling falls? Or should I wait until after Brexit 
when the pound will probably be worth less than a euro?

• I cannot believe that you published a letter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/nov/06/age-appropriate-clothing-and-food-for-people-over-55>
 (7 November) criticising a female politician’s dress sense, which used the 
words “age-appropriate” (and from another woman too). Isn’t the world a 
depressing enough place already?

• Shopping in the supermarket yesterday, I saw rows of potatoes in packaging 
saying “Proudly British”. I had no idea that potatoes cared so much.

• If Damian Green thinks that depriving the most in need of £2,000 a year is a 
“real success” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/damian-green-says-governments-benefits-cap-is-a-real-success>
, 7 November), I dread to think what his idea of a failure is.
