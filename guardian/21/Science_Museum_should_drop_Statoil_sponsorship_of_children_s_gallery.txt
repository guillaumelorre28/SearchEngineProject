On Tuesday, the Science Museum will launch its new interactive gallery for 
children –Wonderlab: The Statoil Gallery 
<http://beta.sciencemuseum.org.uk/wonderlab/#overview>. Despite securing 
sponsorship from an oil and gas company that is recklessly planning to drill 
seven new wells in the fragile Arctic, the London museum has also introduced an 
entry charge, restricting access to those visitors able to pay.

It is unconscionable that in 2016 a museum of science is handing a fossil fuel 
company legitimacy by allowing it to sponsor a gallery designed to inspire the 
next generation. Statoil is pursuing new sources of oil that must stay in the 
ground if there is to be any hope of leaving a safe climate for the children 
that are to visit this gallery. And from the NorwegianArctic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/arctic> to the Great Australian Bight, 
Statoil’s plans are opposed by local communities and indigenous peoples who 
want the company off their lands and out of their waters.

Putting a charge on galleries aimed at children denies those from less 
privileged backgrounds the opportunity to become engaged in science and excited 
by the renewable energies that will play a vital role in their future. It is 
unacceptable for the Science Museum and Statoil to make future generations pick 
up the bill for their ill-made decisions. Wonderlab’s entry charge and its 
unethical sponsor must both be dropped.
