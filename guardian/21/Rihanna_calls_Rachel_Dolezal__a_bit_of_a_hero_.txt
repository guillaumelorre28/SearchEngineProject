Rachel Dolezal – the NAACP leader who became the object of controversy and 
ridicule when her estranged parentsrevealed she was not black but white in June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/rachel-dolezal-today-show-interview>
 – has received support from a perhaps unlikely quarter: Rihanna.

Speaking to Vanity Fair 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/10/rihanna-cover-cuba-annie-leibovitz>
, the singer said that she admired Dolezal, a former chapter leader for the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Spokane, 
Washington, for stirring up a discussion about race.

“I think she was a bit of a hero, because she kind of flipped on society a 
little bit,”Rihanna <https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna> said. “Is it 
such a horrible thing that she pretended to be black? Black is a great thing, 
and I think she legit changed people’s perspective a bit and woke people up.”

Dolezal was heavily criticised for living as a black woman and evading 
questions about her racial identity.She told Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/rachel-dolezal-today-show-interview>
: “It’s a little more complex than me identifying as black or answering a 
question of: are you black or white?”

In the interview, Rihanna also discussed being a victim of domestic violence 
at the hands of her then-boyfriend Chris Brown in 2009 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/10/rihanna-victim-chris-brown-assault>
, saying that she resented having to talk about it continually. “It’s not a 
subject to sweep under the rug, so I can’t just dismiss it like it wasn’t 
anything, or I don’t take it seriously. But, for me, and anyone who’s been a 
victim of domestic abuse, nobody wants to even remember it. Nobody even wants 
to admit it. So to talk about it and say it once, much less 200 times, is like 
… I have to be punished for it?”

 Prominent civil rights activist Rachel Dolezal responds to claims, made by her 
biological parents, that she has been misrepresenting herself as a black woman.
When a reporter from KXLY asks Dolezai

 if her parents are white she walks away from the interview. 
She added that she got back together with Brown after the assault in an 
attempt to change him. “I was very protective of him. I felt that people didn’t 
understand him. Even after ... But you realize after a while that in that 
situation you’re the enemy. You want the best for them, but if you remind them 
of their failures, or even if you say I’m willing to put up with something, 
they think less of you – because they know you don’t deserve what they’re going 
to give.

“And if you put up with it, maybe you are agreeing that you [deserve] this, 
and that’s when I finally had to say, ‘Uh-oh, I was stupid thinking I was built 
for this.’ Sometimes you just have to walk away.”
