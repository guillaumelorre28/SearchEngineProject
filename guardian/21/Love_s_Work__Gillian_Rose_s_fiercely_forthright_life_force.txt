The founding act of defiance for the philosopher Gillian Rose seems, by her 
own account, to have been against dyslexia. The discovery early on “that the 
desert of stony words could be made to bloom, that I could channel what I could 
not overcome” enabled her to embark on a life of intellectual adventure that 
combined forbidding academic rigour with a passionate, personal engagement in 
moral and ethical questions.
 Gillian Rose 
Her intense and beautiful memoir, Love’s Work, records an experience of 
learning philosophy at Oxford so sterile she nearly abandoned the subject. Rose 
recalls being admonished to “remember … all the philosophers you will read are 
much more intelligent than you are”, but through a left turn into sociology she 
was able to relaunch her singular journey through speculative European thought. 
The books that followed includedThe Melancholy Science 
<https://www.versobooks.com/books/1555-the-melancholy-science>, an 
“introduction” to the work ofTheodor Adorno 
<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/adorno/> that’s best read only after you 
know it; and The Broken Middle, a forbidding account of the impossible, 
unavoidable negotiation between the ideal and the singular, which manages to 
reveal aKierkegaard <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/>ian face to
Hegel <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel/>, and vice versa. This 
rewarding but rather terrifying work won her fans includingRowan Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rowan-williams>.

These intellectual struggles are all – rather miraculously – alive in this 
laconic, lyrical autobiography. It describes a troubled childhood in a 
turbulent Jewish family where the trauma of divorce was loaded on to the 
emotional weight of history; it recounts romantic loves that are sometimes 
desperate, sometimes euphoric and offers vivid, tender and occasionally 
shocking portraits of her many friends.

Throughout a career that ranged across thinkers rarely considered together, 
the work of Hegel was a constant: the knotty thinker who explored how every 
concept depends on its opposite; how truth is a moving target in an unceasing 
dialectic. And this defiantly difficult line of thinking, or something very 
much like it, seems to have informed her personal life.

In philosophy and in private life, Rose takes as inspiration Hegel’s not 
obviously hilarious definition of comedy: “The comical as such implies an 
infinite lightheartedness and confidence felt by someone raised altogether 
above his own inner contradiction and not bitter or miserable in it at all.” 
(Rose adds a nuance: “No human being possesses sureness of self: this can only 
mean being bounded and unbounded, selved and unselved, sure only of this 
untiring exercise.”)

This style of thinking, which defiantly refuses any easy certainty, is the key 
with which she unpickeda generation of contemporary philosophers 
<http://www.lrb.co.uk/v07/n13/christopher-norris/textual-theory-at-the-bar-of-reason>
, includingJacques Derrida <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/> and 
Michel Foucault <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/>, to find their 
claims to have overcome western metaphysics actually recapitulate older forms 
of law. It also shows in her frustration with uncomplicated feminism, which she 
argues “fails to address the power of women as well as their powerlessness, and 
the response of both men and women to that power”.

In spiritual questions, too, Rose insists on complication. Modern debates 
about faith neglect a protestantism shared by both sides, she argues – a 
protestantism that was the foundation of modernity. After all, it was to defend 
Christianity thatImmanuel Kant <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/> 
constructed the Critique of Pure Reason – a foundational text of the 
Enlightenment.


The book is also defiant in its treatment of the life crisis that set her 
writing: the discovery of advanced ovarian cancer. Her defiance here is not in 
any romantic “battle” with the disease, any embrace of alternative medicine or 
credulous faith in conventional doctoring, but in continuing to live, 
open-eyed, with remarkable vigour – a vigour she says left her friends 
distinctly unsettled.

Love’s Work is no polemic, but there is a fierceness here that defies both 
conventional wisdom and readers’ self-reassurances. And also herself: Rose 
levels a flinty eye at her own exorbitant thinking, and remains ready to “tarry 
with the negative” in her seeking after the truth. “You are always stronger 
than yourself” is a refrain in these reflections.

If there were a prize for the most challenging epigraph, Love’s Work would be 
a strong contender. Rose takes it from Staretz (in some accounts Saint) 
Silouan: “Keep your mind in hell, and despair not.” This is of course 
impossible wisdom, but Rose bore it with her, writing and thinking to the end. 
The cancer killed her, aged just 48 in 1995. But the defiant invitation to live 
and think and feel more deeply remains as urgent as ever.

Her friend Geoffrey Hill wrote his poem Paideia 
<http://dangreeson.tumblr.com/post/5887188355/in-memoriam-gillian-rose> in 
memory of a thinker who is only beginning to receive her due. It includes these 
lines:

There are achievements
that carry failure on their back, blindness
not as in Brueghel, but unfathomably
far-seeing.

But Hill offers no easy consolation, concluding: “I find love’s work a bleak 
ontology / to have to contemplate; it may be all we have.”
