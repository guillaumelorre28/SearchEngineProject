Maine. After reports of divers going missing on the hitherto aptly named Lake 
Placid, research scientist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda), Fish and Game Warden 
Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) and local sherrif Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson) 
gather by the water. Suddenly, a helicopter begins descending over the lake.

"If this is who I think it is..." mutters Scott. She peers at the helicopter. 

"It is." 

Wells steps forward. 

"Who?" 

"Hector Cyr. Mythology Professor. He's done some work for our museum. He 
also..."

"What?" 

"Swims with crocodiles." 

The copter lands. Cyr (Oliver Platt) dismounts, then shambles amiably towards 
the group, scratching his beard. He beams at Kelly.

"You beat me! Balls!" He glances at the water. 

"Splendid lake, eh? You could be a man on a lake like this. So, who do we have 
from Fish and Game." "Me", answers Wells. Cyr ignores him.

"You can see the algae bloom's just come in. I need topographic charts!" "Wait 
a minute," announces Keough. "You don't just come in here and start giving 
orders..." Cyr interrupts him.

"I apologise. I just don't want to lose the light." He turns to Kelly. 

"You had a little work done?" "No, I have not", she replies, outraged. Keough 
eyeballs Cyr, anger in his voice.

"Who are you?" 

"Hector Cyr. There, I've told you once. Let me know when it sinks in."
