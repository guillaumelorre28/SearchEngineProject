Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Whishaw have previously been cast in the role of 
Mercury, but both plans fell apart due to creative differences.

Baron Cohen said that Queen members Roger Taylor and Brian May, who are 
working as music producers on the film,had different ideas about how much of 
the film should be focused on Mercury

. May later denied the claim,saying Baron Cohen “became an arse”
