Frank Archambault’s tent sits on top of a small hill in the middle of Oceti 
Sakowin, the largest encampment at Standing Rock. It is easy to spot him on the 
small rise, wearing a long black coat, feathered hat, and yellow, red, white 
and black ribbons on his arm that mark him as a member of Iktčé Wičháša Oyáte – 
A Common Men’s Society.

Archambault founded Iktčé Wičháša Oyáte shortly after he arrived, with his 
five children and grandchild, at the “water protector” encampments in August. 
He saw that there was work around the camp that wasn’t getting done, and he saw 
that there were men around camp not doing work. Now the group helps run 
security and coordinates work crews.

It’s a big change from Archambault’s previous life in Little Eagle, South 
Dakota, a community of about 300 people within the Standing Rock Sioux 
reservation. A recovering meth addict, Archambault describes the existence he 
left behind, before he joined the movement fighting the Dakota Access pipeline: 
“Sad.”

I was a bad kid. It’s not hard to be that way when it’s all you see
Lauren Howland 
“Back home, it’s drugs, alcohol, no jobs. People don’t really know how to 
survive. It’s hopeless,” he said. “All we have left is the river.”

Many of the Native American activists, also known as water protectors, who 
have gathered on the windswept plains ofNorth Dakota 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/north-dakota> to defeat a 
multibillion-dollar pipeline, come from reservations ravaged by poverty, 
substance abuse, and a legacy of historical traumas that reach well into the 
present.

“This is like an awakening,” Archambault said as he surveyed the camp from his 
spot on the hill. “Something I’ve been struggling with my whole life is doing 
something to be proud of.”

‘You can’t leave’

Before Lauren Howland travelled to Standing Rock, she was back home at the 
Jicarrilla Apache Nation reservation in Dulce, New Mexico, taking a break from 
the University of New Mexico to help her family through some hard times.


“I was a bad kid,” she said of her life before Standing Rock. “I was always 
drinking, always with my hoodrat friends doing hoodrat stuff, just being a 
typical Native American, giving into the stereotype that we’re all drunks and 
druggies and we just get our checks and get drugs.”

“It’s not hard to be that way when it’s all you see,” she added. 

Howland, who is San Carlos Apache and Navajo, calls herself a “recovering 
alcoholic”. When we spoke, in early November, she was 31 days sober.

“Back on the rez, there’s nothing really to do. All there is do is drink and 
kill yourself,” she said. “I’m only 21 and I’m an alcoholic. I know 13-year-old 
alcoholics, 11-year-old alcoholics. I started drinking when I was, like, seven.”

Surveys by the National Institute of Health 
<http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/DEPRStrategicPlan/BriefingBook2.htm#A._MINORITIES>
 conducted in 1991-1992 and 2001-2002 showed that Native Americans were almost 
twice as likely as other racial and ethnic groups in the United States to be 
alcohol dependent. However, amore recent study 
<http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716(15)01830-X/abstract>
 by researchers at the University of Arizona, looking at the period from 
2009-2013, found no elevated rate of alcoholism in Native American populations.

And among young adults, Native Americans are more than twice as likely to take 
their own lives than other racial groups, according to a2015 study 
<http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/suicide/racial_and_gender_2009_2013.pdf> 
by the US Centers for Disease Control.

For the Cheyenne River Sioux, the crisis is even more acute. Between 2002 and 
2003, the tribe suffered 17 youth suicides,according to multiple news reports 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=871969&page=1>. 

In 2005, Julie Garreau, the executive director of the Cheyenne River Youth 
Project, told the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that there were between three 
and seven attempted suicides on the reservation every week.

Before getting involved in the Standing Rock movement, Jasilea Charger, 20, 
was working at a Taco John’s and living on the Cheyenne River Sioux 
reservation, in her hometown of Eagle Butte, South Dakota.

On the reservation, she said, she felt “stuck”. She lost friends and family to 
the suicide epidemic. Her father died before she was born, and her mother has 
“lost her way”.

“She taught me what not to do by doing it,” Charger said of her mother. “It’s 
a gift on its own because it taught me forgiveness.”

“It’s kind of hard living there, but then again you can’t leave,” she said, 
while cooking slices of spam over a fire pit on a sunny day. “I don’t want to 
leave home because I feel like I’m running from the problem.”

‘A family gathering’

Hunter Shortbear always wanted to serve in the military. He wanted to join the 
marines, but a March 2010 beating left him with a fractured skull and just one 
eye.

At Standing Rock, he has become a “warrior”. 

Shortbear’s black eye patch, barrel chest, and proud carriage set him apart in 
a crowd. He speaks deliberately and eats voraciously. He describes the tasks he 
has been assigned on the security team by his “superior officer” as “an honor 
and a privilege”.

It wasn’t until I came here that I realized it’s a powerful thing to learn 
your traditions and ways
Lauren Howland 
As a child, the 29-year-old Oglala Hunkpapa Lakota was adopted by a white 
family and grew up one of the only Native Americans in Carrington, North 
Dakota. But at Standing Rock, he has reconnected with his roots.

“I consider it a family gathering,” he said. “The Shortbear family is here.” 

The way of life at the camp – communal kitchens, work crews chopping firewood 
and building shelters, medics and healers providing care, councils coming 
together to make decisions, and everyone keeping an eye out for each other – 
has been a revelation for Shortbear.

He compared it to a mural of a historic Sioux tribe living in tipis on the 
wall of the casino restaurant where we were eating.

“It’s all coming back,” he said. “I don’t want to lose this.”

Dakota Access pipeline protesters celebrate after permit denied

In every moment, Standing Rock is suffused with indigenous ceremony and 
prayer, from the women who walk down to the water at sunrise to the singers who 
gather at the sacred fire.

At home, Howland said, tribal elders would tell young people to “get back to 
prayer and get away from drugs and alcohol” but it never made sense to her.

“It wasn’t until I came here that I realized it’s a powerful thing to learn 
your traditions and ways,” she said. “We do everything in prayer. This morning 
I woke up in prayer. You wake up and you smudge and you pray. At home, I would 
wake up and open a bottle and drink.”

‘Take this fire’

On Sunday, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it was denying an 
easement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/04/dakota-access-pipeline-permit-denied-standing-rock>
 for the Dakota Access pipeline to cross the Missouri river. It’s a victory for 
the movement, though many don’t trust the government or the company not to 
figure out another way.

With the temperatures dropping, a blizzard raging through North Dakota, and 
the chairman of the Standing Rock Siouxasking people to leave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/06/standing-rock-protesters-asked-to-go-home-by-sioux-leader>
, the camps are at a crossroads.

Rock. Photograph: Julia Carrie Wong for the Guardian 
Xhopakelxhit was an activist before she arrived at camp. A member of the 
Nuu-chah-nulth, Coast Salish, and Cree nations from the Village of Maaqtusiis 
in Sovereign Ahousaht Territory, Canada, she grew up reading Mao with her 
father.

As a member of the Red Warrior Camp, a group within Oceti Sakowin responsible 
for many of the direct actions against the pipeline, like chaining themselves 
to machinery, Xhopakelxhit carries a certain amount of mystique. “The joke 
around Red Warrior Camp is we eat rubber bullets for breakfast,” she said while 
receiving a large tattoo on her chest.

The challenge now, Xhopakelxhit says, is ensuring that everyone stays in the 
fight.

“One-hundred percent of indigenous people who leave here have a battle at home 
they weren’t taking care of. So maybe they can go home and fight.”

Howland agreed: “Imagine if we go back to our different reservations and start 
implementing tradition and prayer. Think about how much change we can make.”

“When I go home, I’m not going to be the same,” said Charger. “People back in 
our community deserve to know what it feels like to stand strong and pick each 
other up.”
