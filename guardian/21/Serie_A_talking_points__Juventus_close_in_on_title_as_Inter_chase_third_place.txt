The fat lady has not yet started singing. But the Old Lady is ripping the foil 
off a bottle of fizz. Juventus will seal their fifth consecutive Scudetto if 
Napoli fail to win away to Roma on Monday afternoon (which you can follow live
with Jacob Steinberg’s minute-by-minute report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football> from 2pm), so we’re holding back the 
main part of my weekly Serie A blog until after that match – which also has 
significant implications for both teams involved.

But for those who just can’t wait that long, here are some quick thoughts on 
Juventus’s 2-1 win away to Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/20/juventus-lazio-serie-a-paulo-dybala>
, along with the usual Talking Points from the weekend.

• Juventus got some breaks early on at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. They were 
fortunate to be 1-0 up at the interval, after a first half in which Federico 
Bernardeschi had a goal disallowed on a questionable offside call andFiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> were denied a penalty for a 
clear shirt tug by Daniele Rugani. But the referee, Paolo Tagliavento, did 
later award the hosts a spot-kick for a non-existent foul on Nikola Kalinic, 
only for Gigi Buffon to save it.

These incidents do not necessarily even out. The whole game would have gone 
differently if those initial decisions had gone the other way. Fiorentina have 
the right to feel frustrated after outplaying their rivals for long stretches. 
Their 21 shots were the mostJuventus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> have faced in any game this 
season. Likewise, the six shots that they allowed were a record low for the
Bianconeri in this campaign.

But equally, Juventus deserve credit where it’s due. They were clinical in 
taking their chances, the first a beautifully constructed goal – volleyed home 
by Mario Mandzukic after Paul Pogba headed down Sami Khedira’s cross-field ball 
– and the second an act of defiant opportunism from Álvaro Morata just moments 
after Fiorentina had equalised.

 The fact that the Spaniard was on as a substitute tells you everything you 
need to know about the depth and the quality of this squad. Juventus are – or, 
will be – deserving champions, and to have sewn it up this earlyafter the 
miserable start they made 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/14/juventus-feel-the-force-to-appease-talk-of-crisis-and-re-enter-scudetto-race>
 to the campaign is astonishing.

Frankly, this one statistic says it all:

Juve have taken 73 points from a possible 75 since 31 October.

• Rugani was fortunate not to give away a penalty last night, but he did 
receive his first top-flight yellow card, and in his 53rd appearance at this 
level. For a centre-back, that’s remarkable.

• Inter’s match against Udinese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/23/internazionale-udinese-serie-a-match-report>
 on Saturday was the first in Serie A history not to feature a single Italian 
in either starting XI. Foreign footballers now make up 56.1% of all players in 
the division, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, and the Italian Footballers’ 
Association president, Damiano Tommasi, is far from alone in believing that 
“the rules are wrong”.

 Highlights from Inter 3-1 Udinese 
• Still, that was a good 3-1 win for Inter - made all the better by Éder 
finally grabbing his first goal for the club. Roberto Mancini insisted 
afterwards that he had not given up hope of third place, and a Napoli win on 
Monday would keep his team’s slender hopes alive. If nothing else, Inter’s 
victory was well-timed for the visit of representatives from China’s Suning 
Commerce Group, who are said to be close to buying a minority stake in the club.

• Remember that fan who we saw weeping in the stands 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv-OgiSuAQI> after Francesco Totti came off 
the benchto score twice against Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/21/francesco-totti-italian-football-roy-of-rovers-roma>
? Well, his name was Alessio Avallone, and the club invited him down to meet 
his hero at training last week. “I was not even born when Totti made his debut 
in Serie A,” the 22-year-old told reporters. “But he’s a huge part of my life. 
Roma are my true girlfriend.”

• Palermo struck a vital blow in their battle for top-flight survival, winning 
2-0 away to Frosinone. The Sicilians remain behind Carpi - who have a game in 
hand, at home to Empoli on Monday evening - on goal difference, but with home 
fixtures still to come against Sampdoria (now realistically safe from 
relegation) and Verona (already sunk), escape suddenly looks achievable. This 
was their first win since 24 January.

• Sassuolo continue to trail Milan in the race for Europe, but they might have 
kept theRossoneri from poaching their manager Eusebio Di Francesco, who has 
signed a new three-year contract. That said, the deal is reported to include a 
€3m release clause.
