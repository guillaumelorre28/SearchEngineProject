Luca Scatà always wanted to be a police officer, but the 29-year-old could not 
have imagined when he set off on a regular foot patrol in the early hours of 
Friday that he was about to come face-to-face with Europe’s most wanted man.

Scatà and his patrol partner, Cristian Movio, thought there was something 
suspicious about Anis Amri when they approached him near a train station in the 
working-class Sesto San Giovanni district of Milan and asked him for his 
identification.

Milan police kill Berlin attack suspect in shootout 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/dec/23/milan-police-kill-berlin-attack-suspect-anis-amri-shootout-video-report>
It was about 3am and Amri, the man suspected of killing 12 people when he 
ploughed a lorry into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin five days earlier, 
initially said he did not have any papers but that he was from Calabria.

When the officers pressed him to show them his rucksack, Amri pulled out a 
gun, shooting Movio in the shoulder. Scatà fired twice in quick succession, 
sending the suspect to the ground.

It was a quick response 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/23/anis-amri-berlin-attack-suspect-shot-dead-milan>
 that may have saved lives, but it was not one born of years of experience.

Scatà only joined the force in Sesto San Giovanni on 2 November and is still 
serving his probationary period. He had spent the previous nine months in 
police training.

Within hours, the native of Canicattini Bagni, Sicily, was the subject of 
praise from Italy’s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, who commended the two 
officers’ “courage and skills”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the 
Berlin police force thanked them for their support and wished Movio a speedy 
recovery.

“My son simply did his job,” Scatà’s father, Pippo, told the Siracusa News. 
“We are proud of him. I don’t have other words to express how we feel.”

He also won accolades from the mayor of his home town, Paolo Amenta. “We are 
very proud of Luca,” he said. “He is an amazing man and he was very, very 
brave. Since he was little, his dream was to be a cop. We hope to see him soon 
in Sicily.”
