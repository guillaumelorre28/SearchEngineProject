The Port Vale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portvale> manager, Micky 
Adams, will be relishing the prospect of facing Brighton – a club he has 
managed twice before – who are challenging for a Championship play-off 
position. He will be delighted to welcome back Chris Lines, who is available 
following a one-match ban, and Gavin Tomlin, who is likely to make the bench 
after injury. Will Buckley is expected to begin as a substitute for Brighton 
after a month out with hamstring trouble. The two sides have not met since 
2008, in a game that Vale edged 3-2.Ryan Baxter
