Ben Flower has been charged by the Rugby Football League with the most serious 
grade of disciplinary offence for his attack on Lance Hohaia in Saturday’sSuper 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/superleague> Grand Final, with the 
F-level tariff meaning the Wigan prop is facing a suspension of at least eight 
matches.

But Hohaia, who was knocked out by one punch from Flower and then hit by 
another when he lay on the ground, is also facing disciplinary punishment after 
being charged with the much less serious Grade B offence of striking the 
Welshman with his forearm to provoke his violent reaction.

Hohaia would be banned for one or two matches if he is found guilty, a 
sentence that would almost certainly be served in a pre-season friendly early 
next year, and the New Zealander has the option of taking an early guilty plea 
which would restrict his suspension to one match.

Flower does not have that option after being charged with “violent and 
aggressive punching” and “punching an off-guard opponent”. He will appear at an 
independent disciplinary tribunal in Leeds on Tuesday, when the panel will be 
able to use its discretion in deciding the length of any ban.

The longest ban handed out in recent years was received by the late former 
Great Britain hooker Terry Newton in 2005, when he was initially suspended for 
10 matches for two separate incidents, also playing for Wigan against St 
Helens, but the ban was extended to seven months on appeal.

There is no word yet on whether Flower could face criminal charges.

Greater Manchester Police has confirmed it received a number of complaints 
from members of the public, but was meeting with St Helens on Monday lunchtime 
before deciding whether to hand the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service.
