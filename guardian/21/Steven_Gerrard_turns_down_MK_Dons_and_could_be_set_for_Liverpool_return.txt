Steven Gerrard <https://www.theguardian.com/football/steven-gerrard> has 
turned down the chance to manage MK Dons and could now return to Liverpool in a 
coaching capacity.

The League One club sounded out the former Anfield captain

 as they looked for a successor to Karl Robinson but the midfielder, who is 
working towards his Uefa A licence badge, is believed to want more experience 
before embarking on a managerial role.

Initial talks took place between the club and the 36-year-old who left LA 
Galaxy last week

. However, Gerrard is keen on keeping his options open as he weighs up his next 
move.

The Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp has made no secret of an open invitation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/jurgen-klopp-steven-gerrard-liverpool-role>
 for Gerrard, should the club legend want to hang up his boots and begin his 
coaching career, possibly at the club’s academy.

Speaking on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football, Gerrard’s former team-mate 
Jamie Carragher <https://www.theguardian.com/football/jamie-carragher> said: 
“His family didn’t go over to the States fully but I think the MK Dons job 
offer came too early. I don’t think he is fully ready yet. Maybe he wants to 
see if he can get more experience. It’s great he’s making noises about going 
into management.

“If he’d have taken the job, it would have been a good decision in terms of 
the club. That chairman [Pete Winkelman] gave Karl Robinson plenty of time, 
gave Roberto Di Matteo and Paul Ince a chance. The chairman, rather than the 
club, would have enticed him. I think it will only be a matter of time.”

Richie Barker will continue in caretaker charge of the Dons for Tuesday’s 
match against Chesterfield, with the club in the relegation zone of the third 
tier of English football. The former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs has 
also been linked with theMK Dons <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> 
vacancy.
