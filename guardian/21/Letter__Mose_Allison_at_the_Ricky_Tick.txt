<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/16/mose-allison-obituary> at the 
Ricky-Tick club in Windsor in 1965, at a time when many of the African American 
blues giants, such as Howlinâ€™ Wolf, Muddy Waters and Sonny Boy Williamson, were 
making such a huge impact.

Mose was very different, almost disappearing modestly into the nightclub 
gloom, but instantly quietening down the raucous good-time crowd with his 
bouncy piano trio music and laconic, dry delivery on songs such as Parchman 
Farm. He showed the mods and ravers that there was another register to the 
blues, no less authentic for being sung by a white man. He scrupulously 
credited the black composers of songs he covered, and I came to love his 
version of a Mercy Dee Walton classic, One Room Country Shack.
