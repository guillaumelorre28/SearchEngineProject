Veretout joins for an undisclosed fee on a five-year deal from the Ligue 1 
club, with the France Under-21 international having been linked with a move to 
the Premier League throughout the summer.

Tim Sherwood <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tim-sherwood> said: “I’m 
really pleased Jordan decided to choose Aston Villa over the other options he 
had and opt to continue his development with us. He is only 22 but he is vastly 
experienced for someone that age.” The Villa manager added: He has played over 
140 games in France and is a really exciting young player. I know he is very 
highly rated so we are delighted to get this deal over the line.”

Gestede has also joined on a five-year deal from Championship club Blackburn, 
with the fee undisclosed. He scored 22 goals for Blackburn last season, having 
joined from Cardiff City in January 2014 after a successful loan.

Sherwood said: “I’ve known about Rudy since he was at Cardiff City and he is a 
player I’ve always admired. His goalscoring ratio last season was fantastic and 
he is someone who certainly knows how to find the back of the net. He’s a big, 
physical striker but he can play and I’m pleased to welcome him to the football 
club.”

Veretout and Gestede are the eighth and ninth players to arrive at Villa Park 
this summer – and Veretout is the fourth to arrive from Ligue 1 after Jordan 
Amavi, Idrissa Gueye and Jordan Ayew as Sherwood looks to refresh a squad who 
finished three points above the drop zone last season, and the fourth to arrive 
from the French first division.
