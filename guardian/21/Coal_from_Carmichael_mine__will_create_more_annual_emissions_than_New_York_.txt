Coal <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal> from Adani’s proposed 
$16bn Carmichael project will create annual emissions similar to those from 
countries like Malaysia and Austria and more than New York City, according to 
calculations designed to highlight the scale of the mine’s environmental 
impacts.

Conservation group challenges approval of Carmichael coalmine as ‘illegal’

The Australian Conservation Foundation has launched another legal action  
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/09/conservation-group-challenges-approval-of-carmichael-coalmine-as-illegal>
against the federal government’s renewed approval for the mine – this time on 
the grounds that environment minister Greg Hunt failed to consider its impact 
on climate change and therefore on the Great Barrier Reef.

Progressive thinktank the Australia Institute has sought to illustrate just 
how big those emissions will be. It says the average annual emissions from 
burning the coal from Carmichael – 79m tonnes of CO2 – is more than the annual 
emissions from Sri Lanka, more than Bangladesh with its population of 160 
million, about the same as those from Malaysia and Austria and only slightly 
less than the annual emissions from Vietnam.

Compared to annual emissions from cities, it says Carmichael’s emissions will 
be three times the average annual emissions from New Delhi, double those from 
Tokyo, six times those of Amsterdam and 20% more than New York City.

“As the international community prepares for the Paris talks, the world’s 
climate change abatement efforts rely on leaving the bulk of coal resources in 
the ground,” the institute says.

Under international negotiations, emissions are calculated in the country 
where they occur, not the country where the fuel is sourced, but the 
conservation movement is arguing against the development of major new coalmines 
on the grounds that they are incompatible with the globally recognised 
threshold of limiting warming to two degrees.

The previous successful court challenge, which forced Hunt to re-examine his 
approval for Adani, was on technical grounds, because he had failed to consider 
its impact on two species. Huntreapproved the mine.

The new challenge is a test case for the minister’s obligations to consider 
the climate change impacts on theGreat Barrier Reef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/great-barrier-reef> from burning the 
mine’s coal.

Hunt insists the project has been approved in accordance with the law, and 
that 36 strict conditions have been imposed, including on groundwater 
monitoring, protecting local fauna and funding research for conservation in the 
Galilee Basin.

The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act requires the 
minister to consider the principles of ecological sustainable development when 
assessing projects of national environmental significance, but it is not clear 
whether this could include the consideration of the climate change impact on 
the reef of the emissions from the coal when exported and burned.

There have been previous decisions  
<http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLEC/2006/720.html>in the federal 
court where decision-makers were required to take into account these so-called 
“scope three” emissions.

After the original legal action, the former Abbott government tried to rush 
through laws preventing such challenges,arguing they were “lawfare” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/10/coalition-mps-on-green-lawfare-mung-bean-soup-to-treasonous-sabotage>
 and tantamount to economic “sabotage.” That bill was deferred after Malcolm 
Turnbull became prime minister, but the new challenge has prompted Queensland 
Liberal National party senator Matthew Canavan to call for it to be brought 
forward.

Malcolm Turnbull: coal export ban ‘would make no difference to emissions’

ACF president Geoff Cousins has said the aim of the litigation is to stop the 
mine.

The ACF application refers to article four of the world heritage convention, 
which dictates Australia “do ‘all it can to the utmost of its resources’ to 
identify, conserve, present and transmit to future generations the outstanding 
universal value of the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area” – and that this 
must be the “primary purpose” of management of the area.

It says Hunt “made an error of law” by characterising emissions from transport 
by rail, shipping and then the burning of the Adani coal overseas as “not a 
direct consequence of the proposed action”.
