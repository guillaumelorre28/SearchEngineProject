When I play with [experimental musician] Kavus Torabi, sometimes it’s billed 
as a techno set. So we quickly put this track in, which does two things: it 
doesn’t turn away anybody that’s into techno, but it establishes that it’s not 
a strictly techno set.

The track that currently gets the most rewinds

This is Kavus’s band. His new album is very addictive and will appeal to 
people who like complicated pop as well as many other genres. It’s not 
necessarily one for the dancefloor because it chops and changes too much, but 
it’s one I have on in the car and I keep on returning to it.

The track that’s been unfairly slept on this year

I would say most of my record collection is unfairly slept on, so to pick out 
one track would be a bit unfair. However, an artist that’s unfairly slept on is 
a Manchester band calledTrojan Horse <http://trojanhorseuk.com/>. They’re 
fantastic and have got another album coming out relatively soon. 

The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes

Most of my music is eclectic but I’d play this track if I was trying to show 
off what I listen to.

The track you always play to rescue a dancefloor

This is a track that’s pretty tribal in its beat. If you can’t tap your feet 
or dance to it, then there’s something wrong.

The track I wish I’d never played

Myself and a load of snooker players got together with Chas and Dave and got 
to No 7 in the charts with this. It was a great laugh but it’s an albatross 
around my neck. Having said that, I played the tape recently and thought, “This 
is quite catchy.”

The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding

Just to upset anyone that was upset by it. I don’t think wedding DJs are doing 
what they want to do, they’re supplying a demand. I’d play any old crap that 
was required.
