St Vincent de Paul chief executive David Wark said on Friday the group “made a 
couple of comments, saying ‘I don’t think sleeping out for one night means you 
understand what it means 
<https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/oct/29/homeless-sleep-out-charity>
 to be homeless’. And I think that’s fair.”

Wark told 891 ABC Adelaide the group may been offended by the marquees and 
fences put up around the site.

“We didn’t put the marquees or the fencing in an area where they might 
normally occupy,” Wark said.

“I think it was just having marquees in Whitmore Square was something very 
different and took people by surprise.”

Wark said the homeless people accused participants of not understanding what 
homelessness felt like.

“The homeless people were demanding in one instance, ‘can you give us some 
money’, and in other instances ‘what are you doing here?’

“They certainly stayed and made their presence felt and then occupied a seat 
or two for maybe 15 or 20 minutes, but that’s OK, that’s a real experience and 
that’s what we’re trying to provide people that are doing it.”

About 1,300 chief executives take part in the annual sleepout, which aims to 
raise awareness and fund services for the 100,000 Australians who sleep rough 
on the streets. The Adelaide event involved 120 CEOs and raised $560,000 for St 
Vincent de Paul.
