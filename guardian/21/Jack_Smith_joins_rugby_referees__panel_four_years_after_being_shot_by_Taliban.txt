The former Royal Marine Jack Smith has joined the Rugby Football League’s 
full-time panel of referees. The appointment completes a remarkable climb up 
the ranks for Smith, 27, who took up refereeing only four years ago when he was 
forced to retire from playing after being shot by a Taliban sniper while on 
duty in Afghanistan.

The RFL has also promoted Scott Mikalauskas, taking its full-time match 
officials team back up to nine following the recent departures of Richard 
Silverwood and Sam Ansell.

“I’m excited to be part of the full-time team,” said Smith, who made his Super 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/superleague> debut in June. “I feel 
the full-time environment will help me learn more and take my officiating to 
the next level.

“I’m looking forward to joining a great group of people on a full-time basis – 
they have all been very helpful and welcoming during my spell as a part-time 
official and I’m already looking forward to seeing what 2017 brings.”

Mikalauskas, also 27, who played for Golborne Parkside in the North West Men’s 
League up to the start of this season, will quit his job as a school house 
learning coordinator to take on the role.

“As much as I enjoyed officiating, I never thought it would lead to being 
given such a fantastic opportunity,” said Mikalauskas. “My father inspired me 
to take up the whistle and my aims now are to become a firm fit in the full 
time refereeing structure and to continue to progress and improve my 
performances.”
