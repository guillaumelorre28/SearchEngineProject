The Colombian was in scintillating form at the Bernabéu and crossed for Bale 
to head home in only the second minute. Rodríguez smashed in a superb free-kick 
before half-time and Bale crossed for Karim Benzema to make it 3-0 two minutes 
into the second half.

Rodríguez then fired in an acrobatic overhead kick three minutes later as Real 
tormented Seville-based Betis. Betis had a chance to pull a goal back when 
Raphael Varane conceded a penalty for a foul on the substitute Jorge Molina but 
Keylor Navas saved Rubén Castro’s weak 61st-minute effort.

Bale, who overshadowed an out-of-sorts Cristiano Ronaldo, sealed a resounding 
win with a long-range effort a minute from time that cannoned in off a post.
