It’s good that Alice Bacon is to be recognised in a new biography (Female MPs 
often written out of political history, 28 November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/27/time-to-write-women-back-into-parliamentary-history-rachel-reeves>
). Margaret Bondfield was mentioned as another MP without a biography. She did, 
however, write her autobiography, A Life’s Work. My second-hand copy, in my 
possession for many years, has a bookplate showing that it originally belonged 
to Caroline Haslett. I have always assumed this was the Carolne Haslett, who 
herself was a pioneer in opening up engineering as a profession for women, and 
who in 1919 founded theWomen’s Engineering Society <http://www.wes.org.uk>.

• An excellent photograph of Salisbury Cathedral (Eyewitness, 28 November). 
However, it was not “a spectacular start to Christmas”, but rather a 
spectacular start to Advent. It is unfortunate that someone does not know the 
difference

• Maybe the English should aspire to the dog Goethe described (English 
nationalism is a growling dog with no bite and no bark,Editorial, 28 November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/27/the-guardian-view-on-english-devolution-a-lack-of-cross-party-legitimacy>
). Rough translation: “Wanted, dog / no barking or biting / must eat broken 
glass / and shit diamonds.”

• Cosy, from the Scots Gaelic cosagach, is one approximation of hyggelig (
Letters, 28 November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/27/high-flyer-economists-keep-show-on-the-road>
), though Under Milk Wood’s Mrs Dai Bread One was possibly closer with the 
sentiment, “nice to be comfy, nice to be nice”.

• Re your report on the “second highest” building in western Europe (29 
November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/28/trellis-1-undershaft-skyscraper-london-green-light-building>
): Emley Moor transmitter (330m) in West Yorkshire is 20m taller than the Shard 
(310m). The tower has a top-floor interior equipment area at a height of 330 
metres, which is accessible.

• David Harper, in his calculation (Letters, 29 November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/28/rolling-stones-darryl-jones-not-just-a-spare-part>
), fails to recognise that Wales is not level. If all the sugary drinks 
consumed by 11- to 18-year-olds were poured on it, we would have a mass of 
hills and mountains rising over some deep sticky lakes.
