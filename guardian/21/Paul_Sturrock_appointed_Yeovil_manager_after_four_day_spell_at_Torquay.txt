Yeovil Town have appointed Paul Sturrock as their manager after he walked out 
on his advisory position atTorquay United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torquay-united> only four days into the 
job.

The former Plymouth and Southampton manager had been out of work since leaving 
Southend in 2013before his very brief spell at Torquay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/08/paul-sturrock-torquay-united-four-days>
 over the Easter weekend. He departed his job at the Conference club having 
been offered this role with Yeovil, which will see the current interim manager, 
Terry Skiverton, revert to assistant manager, with Darren Way first-team coach.

Skiverton has been serving as temporary manager since the departure of Gary 
Johnson in February.

Yeovil are bottom of League One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> and 13 points adrift 
of the last safe spot, with five games to play.

A statement placed on the Yeovil website on Thursday read: “Paul took up his 
duties this morning and will be in charge of the first team for Saturday’s 
match with Notts County. Everybody atYeovil Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/yeoviltown> would like to welcome Paul to 
Huish Park and wish him a long and successful stay at the club.”
