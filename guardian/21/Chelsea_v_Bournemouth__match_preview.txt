Antonio Conte must decide whether Michy Batshuayi is ready to start his first 
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> game in 
place of the suspended Diego Costa, with Cesc Fàbregas drafted into midfield, 
or if he must juggle his attacking resources to secure a club record 12th 
successive victory. The Italian will be aware that Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth won 
in south-west London last season, albeit while José Mourinho’s tenure was 
unravelling, and they will be awkward opponents. This will provide a test of 
sorts of the depth of Chelsea’s squad ahead of the transfer window.
