Everton’s England Under-17 European Championship winner Jonjoe Kenny is to join
Oxford United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/oxford-united> on an 
initial one-month loan.

The right-back, who made his debut for Everton’s under-21 side at the age of 
16, played seven games on loan at Wigan Athletic earlier this season before 
being recalled to Goodison Park. The Merseyside club are anxious for the 
18-year-old to gain further first-team football, though the youngster is not 
expected to be eligible to feature for the League Two side in Saturday’s FA Cup 
fourth-round tie against Blackburn Rovers.

It remains to be seen whether Kenny’s arrival at the Kassam stadium signals 
the end of George Baldock’s impressive loan spell with Michael Appleton’s side. 
Baldock is contracted to MK Dons but signed for Oxford last summer on a 
season-long deal, though there is a recall option written into the agreement 
which can be triggered by the Championship club in January.

The MK Dons manager Karl Robinson indicated last week that he had yet to 
determine whether a player who has featured 34 times already this season at the 
lower level, and has been outstanding in Oxford’s promotion push, would be 
returning.

Appleton’s team sit third in League Two following Saturday’s impressive 
success at Portsmouth, and are 2-0 up from the first leg of their Football 
League trophy semi-final against Millwall with the second game to follow next 
week. They host Blackburn on Saturday having provided the FA Cup’s biggest 
shock in the third round, where theyeliminated top-flight Swansea City 3-2
