Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> look set 
to be investigated by Fifa over their signing of the French teenager Jérémy 
Hélan after the defender's former club, Rennes, said they had complained to 
world football's governing body about the transfer.

Hélan, who is 17, joined City in February and Rennes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rennes> want Fifa to look into the 
Premier League club's conduct. "We have referred this to Fifa," the technical 
director, Pierre Dreossi, told the Independent. City are understood to be 
adamant that they broke no rules in bringing the player, who was then 16, to 
the club.

Rennes' action comes after Chelsea were given a transfer ban to 2011 by Fifa 
after being found guilty of illegally inducing Gaël Kakuta to sign from Lens. 
Chelsea have said they did nothing wrong and that they will appeal.

Hélan, a product of France's Clairefontaine academy, had been a target for 
Manchester United before he signed for City.

City have made several more high-profile and costly signings since their 
Middle Eastern owners took over last season but the United defender Rio 
Ferdinand has warned that the lavish spending is no guarantee of success and 
said that Manchester is not big enough for two highly successful team.

"I won't like it very much if City start doing well," he said. "This city 
isn't big enough for two big teams. But they have very loyal supporters who 
have been crying out for success. Maybe they think their time has come with all 
the money that has been invested.

"Sometimes money doesn't buy success. It can do, as we saw at Chelsea, but 
they were starting from finishing fourth, fifth and third in the league. City 
are starting from a different position."
