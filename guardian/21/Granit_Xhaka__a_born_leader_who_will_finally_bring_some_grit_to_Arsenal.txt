Borussia Mönchengladbach’s interim manager André Schubert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/02/andre-schubert-borussia-monchengladbach-bundesliga>
 looked around his dressing room in search of a leader. The team had lost five 
consecutive games at the start of last season and the two club captains, Martin 
Stranzl and Tony Jantschke, were injured and unavailable.

The team were rock bottom of the Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball>, still reeling from 
the departure of the hugely popular manager Lucien Favre, who had qualified the 
team for the Champions League the previous season, and Schubert needed someone 
to invigorate his squad.

He could have opted for the Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer or for Lars Stindl, 
who had been such an inspirational captain for Hannover before leaving in 2015. 
But he didn’t – instead he chose a 22-year-old with a history of unnecessary 
yellow and red cards, with a decent proportion of them coming for dissent.

Arsenal confirm signing of Granit Xhaka from Borussia Mönchengladbach

“There were two or three others who could have replaced Jantschke,” said 
Schubert, “but I picked Granit Xhaka because he is an important player for us 
who has a lot of good qualities. But he is also someone who has to learn to 
take responsibility.”

It was a huge gamble – but a gamble that paid off. Xhaka could have wilted, 
but instead he grew with the responsibility.

Xhaka’s first outing as captain, a home game against Augsburg, serves as a 
microcosm of the player: an extraordinary amount of running, intense tackling, 
a goal, superb passing – and then substituted in the 77th minute on a yellow 
card, having given away a penalty, and in real danger of being sent off. An 
asset but also a danger to his team. It was Xhaka’s sixth league game and his 
third booking. By the 17th league game of the season he had been sent off three 
times. He simply could not help himself.

But slowly he grew into the role as captain, maturing on the pitch, managing 
to “be more balanced in his game” and becoming “cooler and calmer”, according 
to Schubert. The manager was right. After that third red card, which came as 
early as 31 October, Xhaka picked up only one more yellow until the end of the 
season.Die Fohlen, under Xhaka’s leadership, recovered from their dreadful 
start and finished fourth.

This week the 23-year-old Switzerland midfielder joined Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/25/arsenal-granit-xhaka-confirm-signing>
 for £25m rising to £35m, becoming Arsenal’s third most expensive player ever, 
behind Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez. He cost almost three times as much as his 
international team-mate Xherdan Shaqiri when he moved to Stoke in January.

Arsène Wenger said Arsenal had been watching the player regularly for more 
than a year and Xhaka said the Frenchman was a huge reason for joining the 
Gunners. “He is a legend. The first contact with him was a year ago. He phoned 
me. I could hardly speak,”he told Blick

He could have joined Atlético Madrid last season but despite the fact that the 
Spanish club has reachedtwo Champions League finals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/03/bayern-munich-v-atletico-madrid-champions-league-semi-final-live>
 in three years the Swiss is adamant he made the right choice in sticking with 
Wenger (suggesting that, whatever the “Wenger out” brigade think, the Frenchman 
is perhaps not all bad).

“Arsenal were really interested in me for a long time and I think that I fit 
into the football Arsenal play,” he added. “I am a good footballer but I also 
like to get stuck in.Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 
have, in the last few years, always played great, attractive football and this 
is a great step for me.”

Xhaka then added the fact that he had captained Mönchengladbach at such a 
young age was “not normal”. But then Xhaka is not a “normal” player. Born in 
Switzerland to Kosovan parents, he has had to break down barriers to get to 
where he is today. In recent times he has been held up as the perfect example 
of successful integration in the country but it has not always been that easy.

Asked in 2012 whether he had been discriminated against because of his 
background, he toldSchweiz am Sonntag [Switzerland on Sunday] 
<http://www.schweizamsonntag.ch/ressort/sport/2664/>: “Yes, absolutely. I never 
used to be taken seriously as a Swiss person. I often heard people saying 
things like ‘always these shit Albanians’ but I never let it get to me because 
I knew it was just a cliché …

“There a lot of occasions when Albanians cause trouble but then we are also 
very nice people. People sometimes forget that there are good people from the 
Balkans as well. The biggest difference between someone like myself and an 
‘Urschweizer’ [someone born in Switzerland] is the name. That’s it. If Max 
Müller and Flamur Berisha goes for the same apprenticeship then it is likely 
that the job goes to Max Müller. I find that stupid.”

Xhaka and his brother, Taulant, who will represent Albania at Euro 2016, 
managed to stay out of trouble when they were younger, dedicating themselves to 
football. They both started out in Basel’s youth team and rose through the 
ranks, moving up to the first team for the 2010-11 season.

In 2012 Granit joined Mönchengladbach and immediately made it clear that he 
did not lack in confidence. After a few months, when he was mainly on the 
bench, the 20-year-old told the press that he “would seek to speak to the 
manager” and “that he had already proved that he could play at the highest 
level”.

The comments did not go down too well with his team-mates or manager Favre 
but, despite flirting with Lazio, he stayed at Gladbach. Later, when asked what 
he had learned from the experience, Xhaka said: “To speak less with the press,” 
before expanding, “I don’t blame the journalists but I will say things 
differently from now on. I went in too hard straight away. I shouldn’t have 
said that openly what I was thinking.”

Since then Xhaka has let his football do the talking, improving in each of the 
four years he spent at Die Borussen. There is no doubt he will be an asset for 
Arsenal as Wenger has finally decided to opt for a bit of bite in midfield to 
go with all the skill. Not that Xhaka isn’t skilful, it is more that he 
combines both aspects of the game. One minute he will get stuck in to the 
tackle, the next he will be spraying the ball crossfield like Xabi Alonso.

If he continues to develop the way he has done over the past four years, he 
will be an Arsenal captain in the making. Towards the end of the 2014-15 season 
he played nine games with a broken rib, initially with special protection and 
painkillers before ditching them too and just playing through the pain. “At 
times, it hurt like hell,”he told Der Express  
<http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/granit-xhaka-im-interview--wer-traeumt-nicht-von-einem-ganz-grossen-klub---1762680>
(http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/granit-xhaka-im-interview--wer-traeumt-nicht-von-einem-ganz-grossen-klub---1762680) 
, “but that was mainly when I was lying on the sofa at home. But when I was 
playing I was so focused I wasn’t that interested in my broken rib. And we had 
to qualify for the Champions League.”

It is an attitude and never-say-die will that have perhaps been missing at 
Arsenal for the past few years. One player will not change the whole mentality 
of a squad but Xhaka proved at Gladbach that he can inspire his team-mates with 
his enthusiasm and work rate.

Wenger has got himself a 23-year-old leader. He may need a few more to win 
that elusive Premier League title but at least it is a step in the right 
direction.
