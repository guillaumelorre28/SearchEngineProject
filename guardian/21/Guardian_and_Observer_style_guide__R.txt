 R - style guide illustrations Photograph: Jakob Hinrichs 
race card
as in “play the race card”; has become a cliche, especially at election times 
when someone is certain to be accused of it

racecard
lists racehorses at a racetrack

race-fixing

RAC Foundation
should be described on first mention as a pro-motoring thinktank

racial terminology
A person’s race should only be included if relevant to the story. The words 
black and Asian should not be used as nouns, but as adjectives: black people 
rather than “blacks”, an Asian woman rather than “an Asian”, etc.

Say African-Caribbean rather than Afro-Caribbean.

Use the word “immigrant” with great care, not only because it is often 
incorrectly used to describe people who were born in Britain, but also because 
it has been used negatively for so many years. If relevant, say people are 
“children of immigrants”, not “second-generation immigrants”

rack or wrack?
You rack your brains, face rack and ruin, and are racked with guilt, shame or 
pain; wrack is seaweed


rackets
not racquets, except in club titles

Rada
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art

Radio 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 Extra, 5 Live, 6 Music

radiographer
takes medical images


radiologist
reads them

Raidió Teilifís Éireann
Irish public broadcasting corporation

radius
plural radii

raft
something Huck Finn and Jim were on when they floated down the river; do not 
say “a raft of measures”, which has very rapidly become a cliche (particularly 
in political reporting)

Raid
redundant array of independent disks (data storage)

railway station
train station is acceptable, indeed more widely used nowadays, although it 
still sounds wrong to some older British readers (and writers)

Rainbows
for girls from five (four in Northern Ireland) to seven, at which point they 
may become Brownies

raincoat, rainfall, rainproof, rainwater
but rain check

Ramadan
month of fasting for Muslims

Ramblers, the
formerly known as the Ramblers’ Association

Ramsay, Gordon
ex-footballing chef; note that England’s World Cup-winning manager in 1966 was 
Alf Ramsey

Ramsay Street
where Neighbours become good friends

R&B
whether you are listening to Bo Diddley or Beyoncé, although only the former 
style should be referred to as rhythm and blues

Range Rover
no hyphen

Rangers
not Glasgow Rangers

Rangoon 
is now Yangon

rarefy, rarefied

rateable

rating agency
not ratings

 ravage or ravish?
To ravage is to destroy or severely damage something. To ravish, confusingly, 
can mean one of two distinct things: to seize someone and carry them off, or to 
enrapture. The OED gives examples, both from the 1990s, of a child being 
ravished by a lion and a wine lover being ravished by a glass of chablis

Rawlplug
TM

Ray-Ban
TM; it’s OK to call them Ray-Bans

razzmatazz

re/re-
Use re- (with hyphen) when followed by the vowels e or u (not pronounced as 
“yu”): eg re-entry, re-examine, re-urge.

Use re (no hyphen) when followed by the vowels a, i, o or u (pronounced as 
“yu”), or any consonant: eg rearm, rearrange, reassemble, reiterate, reorder, 
reread, reuse, rebuild, reconsider, retweet.

Exceptions (where confusion with another word would arise): re-cover/recover, 
re-creation/recreation, re-form/reform, re-sent/resent, re-sign/resign

realpolitik

rear admiral
Rear Admiral Horatio Hornblower at first mention, thereafter Adm Hornblower in 
leading articles, otherwise just Hornblower

rebut, refute or repudiate?
To rebut is to contest or deny something; to refute is to prove that it’s 
wrong. So when a politician claims to have refuted an allegation, what they 
mean is rebut. To repudiate someone is to disown them.


If you don’t know the difference, you could always try “refudiate”, a word 
coined by Sarah Palin, perhaps inspired by George W Bush’s “misunderestimate”

received pronunciation (RP)
a traditionally prestigious accent, associated with private schools and used 
by an estimated 3% of the population of England, also known as BBC English, 
Oxford English or the Queen’s English; nothing to do with Standard English, 
which includes written as well as spoken language and can be (indeed, normally 
is) spoken with a regional accent

recent
avoid: if the date is relevant, use it

 recourse, resource or resort?
You might have recourse to your mother to comfort you when your hamster dies. 
She would, therefore, be a resource you could turn to. As a last resort, you 
might resort to your brother as well

recur
not reoccur

Red Crescent, Red Cross

redbrick
university; the original six were Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, 
Manchester and Sheffield

redshirts
formally known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD), 
they were at the forefront of protests against the Thai government in 2010; 
their opponents, loyal to the Bangkok regime, were the yellowshirts

redundancy
Strictly (and in legal terms) jobs, rather than people, are made redundant. 
From a reader: “Please could the Guardian set an example to all journalists by 
saying that 1,028 jobs were made redundant, not 1,028 staff? That subtle 
difference can make a big difference to the self-respect of the people whose 
jobs have been made redundant, and, in my experience (four redundancies) to the 
attitude of future employers too”

referendum
plural referendums, not referenda

reforestation
not reafforestation

re-form
to form again

reform
to change for the better. We should not take the initiators’ use of the word 
at its face value, particularly in cases where we believe no improvement is 
likely. The latest set of changes to education or the health service may, or 
may not, be reforms

refugee
According to the Refugee Council, a refugee is defined as “a person who, owing 
to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, 
nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is 
outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is 
unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country”.

The Refugee convention of 1951 is the key legal document in defining who is a 
refugee, their rights and the legal obligations of states towards refugees


refute
This much abused word should be used only when an argument is disproved; 
otherwise contest, deny, rebut

regalia
plural, of royalty; “royal regalia” is tautologous

regard
with regard to, not with regards to (but of course you give your regards to 
Broadway)

Regent’s Park
in London

regime
no accent

regional assemblies
abolition of the eight bodies representing English regions outside London, 
along with the regional development agencies, was announced in 2010

register office
not registry office – the first thing reporters used to be taught on local 
newspapers, although you still see the mistake

registrar general

regrettably
unfortunately; regretfully with regret


reign or rein?
A ruler reigns, but a horse is reined in


reinstate

religious right

Remembrance Sunday

Renaissance, the

reopen

repellant
noun, repellent adjective: you fight repellent insects with an insect repellant

repertoire
an individual’s range of skills or roles

repertory
a selection of works that a theatre or dance company might perform

replaceable

report
the Lawrence report, etc; use report on or inquiry into but not report into, 
ie not “a report into health problems”

reported speech
When a comment in the present tense is reported, use past tense: “She said: ‘I 
like chocolate’” (present tense) becomes in reported speech “she said she liked 
chocolate”.

When a comment in the past tense is reported, use “had” (past perfect tense): 
“She said: ‘Iate too much chocolate’” (past tense) becomes in reported speech 
“she said shehad eaten too much chocolate” (not “she said she ate too much 
chocolate”).

Once it has been established who is speaking, there is no need to keep 
attributing, so long as you stick to the past tense: “Alex said he would vote 
Labour. There was no alternative. It was the only truly progressive party,” etc

republicans
lowercase (except for US and other political parties)

Reserve Bank of Australia
the reserve bank or RBA after first mention

residents
has a rather old-fashioned feel to it, especially in the deadly form “local 
residents”; on the whole, better to call them people

resistance, resistance fighters
See terrorism/terrorists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-t#terrorism>

respective
unnecessary in a sentence such as “Smith and Jones spoke on behalf of their 
respective constituencies”; essential in “Smith and Jones represented the 
constituents of Dorset North and Dorset South respectively”

restaurateur
not restauranteur

résumé

retail prices index (RPI)
prices not price, but normally no need to spell it out. No longer the official 
measure of inflation (that is the consumer price index), but still used for 
uprating pensions and other state benefits

Rethink
formerly the National Schizophrenia Fellowship

reticent
unwilling to speak; do not confuse with reluctant, as in this example from the 
paper: “Like most graduates of limited financial means, Louise Clark was 
reticent about handing over a huge wad of dosh”

Réunion
French island in the Indian Ocean; not La Réunion

Reuters

the Rev
at first mention, thereafter use courtesy title: eg the Rev Joan Smith, 
subsequently Ms Smith if honorific is needed; never say “Reverend Smith”, “the 
Reverend Smith” or “Rev Smith”

reveille

Revelation
last book in the New Testament: not Revelations, a very common error; its full 
name is The Revelation of St John the Divine

Revenue & Customs
or HMRC: either is acceptable shorthand for HM Revenue and Customs, formed in 
2005 from a merger of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise

Revolutionary Guards
(plural) in Iran. The official name is Army of the Guardians of the Islamic 
Revolution; “Revolutionary Guard” is meaningless in Iran.

In Libya, however, Muammar Gaddafi had his very own Revolutionary Guard 
(singular), now disbanded. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein also had one

Rheims

rheumatoid arthritis
not rheumatism or arthritis, but can be abbreviated to RA after first mention

Rhodes scholar

RIBA, the
the Royal Institute of British Architects

Rice, Condoleezza

rice paddies
tautologous, as padi is the Malay word for rice; so it should be paddy fields 
or simply paddies

Richmond
historic town in North Yorkshire.

We sometimes confuse the parliamentary constituency of Richmond with that of 
Richmond Park, in south-west London, suggesting that the north of England is a 
faraway country of which we know little and care less

Richter scale
expresses the magnitude of an earthquake, but scientists no longer use 
Richter’s methodology as it does not work for large quakes or ones where the 
epicentre is farther than 600km away.

It was superseded in 1979 by the more uniformly applicable moment magnitude 
scale. So we talk about “an earthquake of magnitude 7.2” or whatever it is

rickety

ricochet, ricocheted, ricocheting

ridden, riddled or raddled?
crime-ridden, disease-ridden; riddled with errors, riddled with bullets; a 
raddled appearance

riffle
to flick through a book, newspaper or magazine; often confused with rifle, to 
search or ransack and steal from, eg rifle goods from a shop

right now
adds nothing, and should normally be deleted.
We asked: “Who are the most powerful people in the UK media right now?”
“Who are the most powerful people in the UK media?” would have had just as 
much impact, and been much less annoying

right to buy, help to buy, buy to let
no initial caps; hyphenate before a noun, eg right-to-buy scheme, help-to-buy 
programme, buy-to-let mortgages

right wing, the right, rightwinger
nouns

rightwing
adjective

Riley
as in “living the life of Riley”, defined by the OED as “an enviably 
enjoyable, luxurious or carefree existence”

RIM
abbreviation for Research In Motion, the BlackBerry company

Rime of the Ancient Mariner
not Rhyme

ringfence, ringtone

riot grrrl

risque
no accent

riverbank, riverbed

rivers
The “river” part comes first in the names of British rivers: river Severn, 
river Thames, etc; elsewhere, it normally comes second: Amazon river, Hudson 
river, Yangtze river, etc.

Most of the time it can be left out altogether, however: Amazon, Thames, 
Yangtze, etc

riveted, riveting

RNIB
Royal National Institute of Blind People (no longer “the Blind”)

RNID
the Royal National Institute for Deaf People changed its name to Action on 
Hearing Loss in June 2011

steal a car or a bag of money

cap if referring to Gibraltar

rock’n’roll
one word

Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II

Rogers, Richard
British architect, Lord Rogers on second mention, thereafter just Rogers

role
no accent

Rollerblade
TM; say inline skates

rollercoaster
one word

rollover
noun (as in lottery rollover)

Rolls-Royce

Roman Catholic
The archbishop of Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, Liverpool, St Andrew’s, 
Southwark and Westminster: it is not normally necessary to say Roman Catholic 
(as there is no Anglican equivalent).

The Roman Catholic bishop of Aberdeen, Argyll, Lancaster, Plymouth, 
Portsmouth, Shrewsbury (for all of which there are Anglican bishops).

Unless obviously Roman Catholic from the context, say the Roman Catholic 
bishop of Brentwood, Clifton, Dunkeld, Galloway, Hexham and Newcastle, Leeds, 
Menevia, Middlesbrough, Motherwell, Northampton, Nottingham, Paisley and 
Salford.

In a UK setting use Roman Catholic in describing Roman Catholic organisations 
and individuals and wherever an Anglican could argue ambiguity (eg “the 
Catholic church”). But Catholic is enough in most overseas contexts, eg 
Ireland, France, Italy, Latin America

Romania

Romany
noun, adjective; Roma plural

romcom

Romeo
cap up, whether referring to Juliet’s boyfriend or using generically (“he’s 
the office Romeo”)

roofs
plural of roof (not rooves, which has appeared in the paper)

Rooney, Coleen
not Colleen

ro-ro
roll-on, roll-off ferry

Royal Mail

Royal Society of Arts

of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce

RSPB, RSPCA
do not normally need to be spelt out, but our readers outside the UK deserve a 
brief explanation of what they are

rubber
strictly, a series of card games or sporting encounters, not an individual 
match; so if (say) Great Britain’s tennis team lost the first three matches of 
a five-match Davis Cup tie, you would have a dead rubber (but it would be wrong 
to call the fourth or fifth matches “dead rubbers”)

Rubens, Peter Paul
(1577-1640) Flemish painter
