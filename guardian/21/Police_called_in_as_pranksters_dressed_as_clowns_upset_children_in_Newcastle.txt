Schoolchildren across Newcastle <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/newcastle> 
have been targeted by pranksters dressing up as clowns and jumping out from 
behind bushes.

Thought to be inspired by a craze in America, police have now been forced to 
step in after the youngsters were left “incredibly distressed”.

Northumbria police said they have received six separate reports since Friday, 
leaving parents and teachers very concerned.

They said no one had been attacked or injured in the incidents, but said they 
had also received further reports of clowns chasing pedestrians down the street.

Insp Stephen Wykes said: “The people carrying out these pranks may think 
they’re being funny but it is leaving a number of young people incredibly 
distressed.

“Parents of the children affected, and teachers at our local schools, are 
understandably concerned and we are working very closely with them as this is 
not something we want to see happening in our local community.

“There has only been a handful of these incidents, which we think have been 
inspired by a trend in America, but we are keen to stop them before they cause 
anyone else further distress.

“We are keen to identify those people who are dressing up as clowns so we can 
speak to them about their conduct and establish whether any criminal offence 
has taken place.”

There have been reports across the US of men dressed up as clowns trying to 
lure children into woods as well as running around with knives and guns.

This has led to a number of arrests as well as police telling people to take 
photos of any clowns they see to help identify them. Anyone with information is 
asked to contact the police on 101.
