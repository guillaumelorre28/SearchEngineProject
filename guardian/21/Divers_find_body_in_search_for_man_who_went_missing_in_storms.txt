Police divers involved in the search for an elderly man who went missing 
during this week’s storms have recovered a body.

Russell Sherwood, 69, went missing after leaving his home in Neath, South Wales
 <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>, on Monday morning.

Teams searching the river Ogmore said they had discovered a car believed to be 
Sherwood’s silver Ford Focus lying upside down in the water but initially could 
not reach it as conditions were too treacherous.

On Wednesday South Wales police tweeted that a body had been found. The tweet 
said:

Meanwhile, police in Kent were continuing to investigate the circumstances 
surrounding the death of a 39-year-old woman who lost her life after being 
pulled from rough seas near Folkestone on Tuesday. The woman was airlifted to 
hospital but died.

The death is being referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission 
(IPCC), Kent Police said. Police received a call concerning the welfare of the 
same woman at around 6.30pm on Monday and referral to the IPCC was “mandatory” 
in such circumstances.


The Environment Agency (EA) is warning people across England who live close to 
rivers and streams to remain vigilant following this week’s heavy rain as water 
feeds through the system in the coming days.

Though much of the UK was enjoying drier weather on Wednesday morning, almost 
100 warnings and alerts remained in place from Cornwall through the Midlands, 
up to Greater Manchester and the north-east.

Twelve warnings were in place that flooding was expected and immediate action 
required.

The EA said water levels on the river Stour from Sturminster Newton to 
Wimborne in Dorset were continuing to rise.

Flood warnings were also in place on the river Ouse at Naburn Lock in York and 
stretches of the river Severn in Gloucestershire.

The mainline train track between Tiverton and Exeter in Devon remained closed 
after the track was washed away in seven places by the torrential rain.

The railway company GWR said on Wednesday morning 
<https://www.gwr.com/travel-updates/live-network-updates/pidd-disruption-information>
 it did not expect to complete work until 4pm. The Barnstaple branch line in 
north Devon and the Looe line in Cornwall also remained closed.
