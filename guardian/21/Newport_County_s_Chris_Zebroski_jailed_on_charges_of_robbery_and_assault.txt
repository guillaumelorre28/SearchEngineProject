The Newport County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/newport-county> 
striker Chris Zebroski has been jailed for four years after admitting four 
charges of robbery, attempted robbery and assault.

Swindon crown court was told that the 28-year-old crashed his BMW into a taxi 
in December and attacked another taxi driver who filmed him, smashing his 
mobile phone.

He then chased the first taxi driver, pushed him to the ground and punched him 
at least 10 times, saying “give me your phone”.

Zebroski, who was a youth player for Swindon and has played for Plymouth 
Argyle, Millwall, Bristol Rovers and Cheltenham Town, said later he was “a bit 
over the limit”.

The court heard that while on bail, Zebroski then attacked and tried to rob 
two men in Swindon after leaving a party. The player was said to have previous 
convictions for assault and alcohol-related incidents.

The Recorder Ian Lawrie said: “Whatever talent you had as a footballer has 
been squandered because of alcohol abuse.

“It is a matter of regret if this sentence shatters your professional football 
career.”

Zebroski joined Newport, currently ninth in League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball>, from non-league 
Eastleigh in 2013 and was their top scorer last season with 13 goals.

Newport later put out a statement saying they had terminated Zebroski’s 
contract.

“Newport County have noted the prison sentence handed down to striker Chris 
Zebroski today,”the club website said.

“The club have always had the welfare and wellbeing of Chris at heart and have 
worked hard with Chris and the PFA throughout.

“However, we would like to make it clear that we do not condone any of the 
actions for which Zebroski has been found guilty.

“Regrettably, the club are left with no other option than to terminate Chris’s 
contract.”
