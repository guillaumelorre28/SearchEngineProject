A police officer feared for his life when an intoxicated man got him in a bear 
hug and threatened to tip them both off a bridge over the A1, a court has heard.

Michael Walker, 28, a cocaine addict from West Denton, Newcastle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/newcastle> upon Tyne, was jailed for five years 
after he pleaded guilty to attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with 
intent. A charge of attempted murder was dropped at a previous hearing.

Walker had punched a female neighbour in the face and run off when the police 
arrived at about 6.30am on 12 November.

When PC Richard Wilkinson, who is 6ft 3in, confronted him on the footbridge 14 
metres above the ground, Walker, who had been drinking wine and vodka, grabbed 
him.

Mark Giuliani, prosecuting, told Newcastle crown court how Walker then tried 
to tip himself and Wilkinson over the railings on to the embankment below.

Giuliani said: “The defendant was shouting, so much so his face was contorted 
with rage.”

He added that Walker shouted: “Come on, we are both fucking going over.”

Walker leaned back over the railings, lifting Wilkinson off the ground, 
becoming red in the face with the effort. “PC Wilkinson was very afraid and in 
fear of his life,” said Giuliani.

The officer managed to force Walker back on to the ground and radioed for 
assistance. But as he tried to handcuff Walker, the suspect grabbed Wilkinson 
and squeezed his windpipe.

During the struggle the handcuffs were lost, but Wilkinson managed to call 
again for back-up and three more officers arrived to help, eventually carrying 
Walker off the bridge but only after the suspect had kicked PC Stacey Elhala.

When he sobered up at the police station, Walker said he had no recollection 
of attacking his neighbour or the incident on the bridge.

He had banged on the 51-year-old woman’s door in the middle of the night 
demanding toast and punched her in the face when she slapped him in her attempt 
to get him to leave.

Robert Woodcock QC, defending, said Wilkinson must have been terrified during 
the ordeal on the footbridge but it was only for a brief period. He said his 
client had now confronted his problem drinking.

Sentencing Walker to five years for the attempted grievous bodily harm with 
intent, assaulting the neighbour and attacking the other officer, Judge Paul 
Sloan QC said: “I accept you are now genuinely ashamed of your conduct that 
night.”

Acting Ch Supt David Felton said: “Walker is a dangerous man and what he did 
that day could have endangered his own life and that of our police officer.

“It eventually took a number of officers to restrain Walker, just showing how 
powerful and dangerous he was and what an incredible job the PC who responded 
did.”

Felton added: “This type of situation is faced by many of our officers every 
day and exemplifies how dangerous and difficult the job of a police officer can 
be.”
