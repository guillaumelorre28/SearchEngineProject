Maria Miller’s report is to be welcomed (MPs urge action to fight ‘shocking’ 
bias against mothers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/31/mps-urge-better-job-protection-for-expectant-and-new-mothers>
, 31 August). However, there is little point in creating new rights until there 
is proper funding of Citizens Advice bureaux, law centres and other voluntary 
agencies to enforce those rights. Rebecca Raven was assisted by her union in 
her unfair dismissal case. A large section of female workers are not unionised 
and have to represent themselves.

High tribunal fees, complex legal issues and aggressive correspondence from 
the legally represented employer deter the vast majority from pursuing their 
claims. Until this is recognised, the “shocking bias” will continue unchecked.
