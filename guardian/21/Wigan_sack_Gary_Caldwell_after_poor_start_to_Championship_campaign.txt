Wigan Athletic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wiganathletic> have 
sacked Gary Caldwell as manager after a disappointing start to their 
Championship campaign.

With the club in 23rd place in the league, after winning two games in 14 this 
season, the club have made the change.

The Wigan chairman, David Sharpe, said: “It’s undoubtedly the toughest 
decision I’ve had to make since becoming chairman. We deservedly won the League 
One title last season.

“However, we have not managed to carry on that momentum into this season and, 
after careful consideration over a period of time, I feel that we need to act 
now in the best long-term interests of the club.

“We thank Gary for all the hard work he has put in and wish him all the best 
for the future. We need to identify a new manager who can have an immediate 
impact and deliver success in the long term.”

Caldwell was appointed manager in April 2015 after playing 111 times for the 
club and captained the side to the FA Cup final victory against Manchester City 
in 2013.
