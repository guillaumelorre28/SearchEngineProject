“I feel I have worked very hard to be given this opportunity. I have shown the 
same passion and commitment as a manager that I did when I played.

there is enough around the town and community with everyone pulling in the same 
direction to maintain our league status.

“I fully respect the fans who have turned up week in week out to show their 
support and I think they can see the change since I took over. Keep positive 
and let’s keep marching on.”
