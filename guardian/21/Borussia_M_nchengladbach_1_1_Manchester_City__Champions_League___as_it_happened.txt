FULL TIME: Borussia Mönchengladbach 1-1 Manchester City

And that’s that! City qualify in second place behind Barcelona. Gladbach are 
guaranteed a spot in the Europa League. And Celtic are out of Europe. Oh 
Brendan! This wasn’t much of a match, truth be told, but City won’t care: they 
can now spend the next three months concentrating on domestic matters!

90 min +1: With Barcelona beating Celtic, and this game level, Gladbach are 
sure of Europa League football. So City are able to hold possession in the 
middle, and the pragmatic hosts are happy to let them do it. This is like 
watching West Germany versus Austria in 1982, albeit without too much scandal.

86 min: Aguero flicks a clever pass down the inside-left channel, between a 
couple of black-and-green shirts, to release Silva into the area. Silva lashes 
into the net, but that’s City’s second disallowed goal of the evening. Offside 
again, and once more it’s the correct decision.

85 min: Kolarov works and works to earn a corner on the left. Silva takes. 
Otamendi rises, just to the left of the penalty spot, and sends a free header 
wide left. He should have at least got that on target.

82 min: City are more than happy to knock it around the middle right now. 
Going nowhere, but that’s all right, the clock is their friend.

80 min: A rare attack by Gladbach. Hoffman opens his legs down the right, but 
with Johnson hovering in the middle, loops a wild one straight through the 
area. City are looking pretty comfortable right now, knowing they’re through to 
the next round as things stand.

79 min: Navas slips Sagna into space down the right. Sagna earns a corner 
kick. After some intricate triangles, Navas finds himself on the by-line, just 
to the right of the goal. He skelps a vicious shot-cum-cross straight at 
Sommer, who does well to parry up and away from his own goal. That was hit so 
hard, it could have gone anywhere.

74 min: City, having had their collective bubble deflated in the wake of 
Fernandinho’s needless dismissal, regroup and pin the hosts back. Low crosses 
are fizzed into the area from both wings, but each time a black shirt is first 
to the party and hacks clear.

72 min: Raffael is really trying it on now. He blocks a Kolarov cross with his 
arms up. A free kick, which leads to nothing, but that’s not really the point: 
it was a deliberate hand ball, and he really should be walking by now.

71 min: Now Raffael is booked for a very agricultural slide on Gundogan. A 
case for a red card there, as he went in studs up and, for a split second, had 
two feet off the ground. It looked more clumsy than malicious, but again, the 
letter of the law...

69 min: Hofmann makes good down the right and reaches the by-line. He cuts 
back for Johnson, bombing in down the channel. Johnson can’t connect, and City 
clear. Sagna romps down the right, and is scythed to the ground by a 
ludicrously late challenge from Jantschke. A yellow card, all day long.

67 min: De Bruyne, 30 yards out and cutting in from the left, drops a shoulder 
to make some space and unleashes a superlative riser towards the top right. 
It’s in all the way, but Sommer tips it over the bar. What a shot! And a 
stunning save! The corner comes to nothing.

65 min: And with the crowd having found their voice again, Raffael picks up 
possession on the edge of the City D and sends a no-backlift shot trundling 
towards the bottom left. It’s just wide of the post. Not 100 percent sure Bravo 
was getting across to that. The home side are renewed.

RED CARD! Fernandinho (Manchester City)

63 min: This is beyond stupid. Fernandinho, on a booking, lightly tugs at the 
back of Strobl’s shirt in the centre circle. It’s not much of a foul, hardly a 
tug even, but by the letter of the law and all that. Why take the risk when 
you’re on a booking, and a man up? And now it’s ten versus ten.

62 min: De Bruyne battles and bustles down the left, and very nearly breaks 
clear into the Gladbach area. Strobl stands his ground and eventually wins a 
free kick. Cue ironic cheers from the home faithful, who are still sore about 
the departure of their captain.

59 min: This is attack versus defence. Gladbach can’t get hold of the ball at 
all. Navas slides De Bruyne into space down the right. De Bruyne reaches the 
by-line and looks for a friendly orange-and-purple shirt in the middle. His 
shot-cum-cross is snaffled by Sommer at the near post.

57 min: City are all over Gladbach now. Sterling is seeing a lot of the ball 
on the right. He floats one to the far post, but Aguero is never getting there, 
and Sommer plucks from the sky.

RED CARD! Stindl (Borussia Mönchengladbach)

51 min: The Gladbach captain is sent packing for a second yellow, picked up 
after he cynically bodychecks Otamendi! A difficult evening for City has 
suddenly become a whole lot easier.

50 min: De Bruyne enters the box on the right. A chance to shoot, but he 
doesn’t take it. A fresh-air swipe. Then he has another go, but only manages to 
screw the ball to his left, where Sterling is free! Sterling sidefoots home 
with power, but the flag goes up for offside. The correct decision.

49 min: From the free kick, 40 yards down the inside-right channel, De Bryune 
floats a ball to the far post, where Stones really should go for goal from 
close range. But he opts to head back across goal instead. Sommer claims, and 
is barged by Fernandinho as he leaps. The pair square up but calm down soon 
enough.

48 min: Gladbach have barely touched the ball in this first half. Eventually 
all the City possession gets the better of Dahoud, who tugs at Nevas’s arm and 
is booked for his trouble.

And we're off again!

In the tunnel, before the teams emerge, Pep Guardiola takes a few seconds to 
drum a few extra words of beneficial advice into his defence. You can’t blame 
him for taking every opportunity to cram in a little more tuition during the 
break: on the evidence of the first half, fifteen hours wouldn’t have been long 
enough, never mind 15 minutes. City go immediately on the attack, Gundogan 
making good down the left but ballooning his cross into the stand behind the 
goal with the box loaded.

HALF TIME: Borussia Mönchengladbach 1-1 Manchester City

And that’s that for the first half! It’s fair to say City are a little lucky 
to be level, given the way they’ve defended at times. But a moment of sheer 
quality has put a different sheen on this game at the break. The home side will 
be livid with themselves for easing off before the half-time whistle. Pep’s now 
got a chance to knock some sense into his defenders. Should be a cracker of a 
second half. Don’t go anywhere, now.

GOAL! Gladbach 1-1 City (Silva 45+1)

No matter! City equalise in their very next attack, and with the last kick of 
the half! Gundogan finds Sterling with a clever pass down the right channel. 
Sterling helps it on to De Bruyne, who bursts towards the by-line before firing 
a low cross inside. Silva, on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box, pokes 
home! What a wonderful, crisp passing move!

45 min: City should be level! De Bruyne scoops a gorgeous pass down the 
inside-right channel to spring Sterling into the area. Shades of offside 
possibly? Maybe, maybe not. But perhaps there’s a little doubt in Sterling’s 
mind, because instead of battering a shot goalward, he checks. He cuts inside 
for Aguero instead. The striker looks for the bottom right, but his shot is 
smothered by Sommer.

42 min: Stindl is everywhere right now. He’s set along the right wing by 
Raffael. He nears the by-line, then cuts back to Dahoud, just to the right of 
the City D. Dahoud puts his foot through the ball, but sends his shot miles 
over the bar. City could do with hearing the half-time whistle here. They’re 
not being over-run as such, but every time Gladbach launch an attack, they’re 
finding all sorts of holes in the City back line.

Manchester City through after David Silva earns draw at Mönchengladbach

And that’s that! City qualify in second place behind Barcelona. Gladbach are 
guaranteed a spot in the Europa League. And Celtic are out of Europe. Oh 
Brendan! This wasn’t much of a match, truth be told, but City won’t care: they 
can now spend the next three months concentrating on domestic matters!

90 min +1: With Barcelona beating Celtic, and this game level, Gladbach are 
sure of Europa League football. So City are able to hold possession in the 
middle, and the pragmatic hosts are happy to let them do it. This is like 
watching West Germany versus Austria in 1982, albeit without too much scandal.
 
90 min: There will be two additional minutes.
 
88 min: City continue to fiddle around in the middle, letting the clock do its 
thing. They’re within touching distance of the knockout stages.
 
86 min: Aguero flicks a clever pass down the inside-left channel, between a 
couple of black-and-green shirts, to release Silva into the area. Silva lashes 
into the net, but that’s City’s second disallowed goal of the evening. Offside 
again, and once more it’s the correct decision.
 
85 min: Kolarov works and works to earn a corner on the left. Silva takes. 
Otamendi rises, just to the left of the penalty spot, and sends a free header 
wide left. He should have at least got that on target.
 
84 min: Gladbach make their last change of the evening, swapping their 
goalscorer Raffael for German international Andre Hahn.
 
82 min: City are more than happy to knock it around the middle right now. 
Going nowhere, but that’s all right, the clock is their friend.
 
80 min: A rare attack by Gladbach. Hoffman opens his legs down the right, but 
with Johnson hovering in the middle, loops a wild one straight through the 
area. City are looking pretty comfortable right now, knowing they’re through to 
the next round as things stand.
 
79 min: Navas slips Sagna into space down the right. Sagna earns a corner 
kick. After some intricate triangles, Navas finds himself on the by-line, just 
to the right of the goal. He skelps a vicious shot-cum-cross straight at 
Sommer, who does well to parry up and away from his own goal. That was hit so 
hard, it could have gone anywhere.
 
77 min: City ping it around some more. Gladbach sit back. Suddenly De Bruyne 
breaks free down the left and earns a corner. Vestergaard clears with a header 
that reaches the halfway line.
 
74 min: City, having had their collective bubble deflated in the wake of 
Fernandinho’s needless dismissal, regroup and pin the hosts back. Low crosses 
are fizzed into the area from both wings, but each time a black shirt is first 
to the party and hacks clear.
 
72 min: Raffael is really trying it on now. He blocks a Kolarov cross with his 
arms up. A free kick, which leads to nothing, but that’s not really the point: 
it was a deliberate hand ball, and he really should be walking by now.
 
71 min: Now Raffael is booked for a very agricultural slide on Gundogan. A 
case for a red card there, as he went in studs up and, for a split second, had 
two feet off the ground. It looked more clumsy than malicious, but again, the 
letter of the law...
 
69 min: Hofmann makes good down the right and reaches the by-line. He cuts 
back for Johnson, bombing in down the channel. Johnson can’t connect, and City 
clear. Sagna romps down the right, and is scythed to the ground by a 
ludicrously late challenge from Jantschke. A yellow card, all day long.
 
68 min: City react to their red card by sacrificing Sterling for Sagna.
 
67 min: De Bruyne, 30 yards out and cutting in from the left, drops a shoulder 
to make some space and unleashes a superlative riser towards the top right. 
It’s in all the way, but Sommer tips it over the bar. What a shot! And a 
stunning save! The corner comes to nothing.
 
65 min: And with the crowd having found their voice again, Raffael picks up 
possession on the edge of the City D and sends a no-backlift shot trundling 
towards the bottom left. It’s just wide of the post. Not 100 percent sure Bravo 
was getting across to that. The home side are renewed.
 
63 min: This is beyond stupid. Fernandinho, on a booking, lightly tugs at the 
back of Strobl’s shirt in the centre circle. It’s not much of a foul, hardly a 
tug even, but by the letter of the law and all that. Why take the risk when 
you’re on a booking, and a man up? And now it’s ten versus ten.

62 min: De Bruyne battles and bustles down the left, and very nearly breaks 
clear into the Gladbach area. Strobl stands his ground and eventually wins a 
free kick. Cue ironic cheers from the home faithful, who are still sore about 
the departure of their captain.
 
60 min: Dahoud is replaced by Vestergaard, who slots in at the back. Jantschke 
moves forward to take up the departing midfielder’s position.
 
59 min: This is attack versus defence. Gladbach can’t get hold of the ball at 
all. Navas slides De Bruyne into space down the right. De Bruyne reaches the 
by-line and looks for a friendly orange-and-purple shirt in the middle. His 
shot-cum-cross is snaffled by Sommer at the near post.
 
57 min: City are all over Gladbach now. Sterling is seeing a lot of the ball 
on the right. He floats one to the far post, but Aguero is never getting there, 
and Sommer plucks from the sky.
 
55 min: City possession, whistles, Otamendi being given pelters, etc.
 
53 min: City stroke it around the middle of the park awhile, just because they 
can now. The home support are whistling quite a lot, especially when Otamendi 
receives the ball.
 
51 min: The Gladbach captain is sent packing for a second yellow, picked up 
after he cynically bodychecks Otamendi! A difficult evening for City has 
suddenly become a whole lot easier.

Grimm/Bongarts/Getty Images  
50 min: De Bruyne enters the box on the right. A chance to shoot, but he 
doesn’t take it. A fresh-air swipe. Then he has another go, but only manages to 
screw the ball to his left, where Sterling is free! Sterling sidefoots home 
with power, but the flag goes up for offside. The correct decision.
 
49 min: From the free kick, 40 yards down the inside-right channel, De Bryune 
floats a ball to the far post, where Stones really should go for goal from 
close range. But he opts to head back across goal instead. Sommer claims, and 
is barged by Fernandinho as he leaps. The pair square up but calm down soon 
enough.
 
48 min: Gladbach have barely touched the ball in this first half. Eventually 
all the City possession gets the better of Dahoud, who tugs at Nevas’s arm and 
is booked for his trouble.
 
In the tunnel, before the teams emerge, Pep Guardiola takes a few seconds to 
drum a few extra words of beneficial advice into his defence. You can’t blame 
him for taking every opportunity to cram in a little more tuition during the 
break: on the evidence of the first half, fifteen hours wouldn’t have been long 
enough, never mind 15 minutes. City go immediately on the attack, Gundogan 
making good down the left but ballooning his cross into the stand behind the 
goal with the box loaded.

And that’s that for the first half! It’s fair to say City are a little lucky 
to be level, given the way they’ve defended at times. But a moment of sheer 
quality has put a different sheen on this game at the break. The home side will 
be livid with themselves for easing off before the half-time whistle. Pep’s now 
got a chance to knock some sense into his defenders. Should be a cracker of a 
second half. Don’t go anywhere, now.
 
No matter! City equalise in their very next attack, and with the last kick of 
the half! Gundogan finds Sterling with a clever pass down the right channel. 
Sterling helps it on to De Bruyne, who bursts towards the by-line before firing 
a low cross inside. Silva, on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box, pokes 
home! What a wonderful, crisp passing move!

45 min: City should be level! De Bruyne scoops a gorgeous pass down the 
inside-right channel to spring Sterling into the area. Shades of offside 
possibly? Maybe, maybe not. But perhaps there’s a little doubt in Sterling’s 
mind, because instead of battering a shot goalward, he checks. He cuts inside 
for Aguero instead. The striker looks for the bottom right, but his shot is 
smothered by Sommer.
 
44 min: Fernandinho is booked for a foul on Dahoud in the centre circle, as 
Gladbach once again prepare to launch a sortie downfield.
 
42 min: Stindl is everywhere right now. He’s set along the right wing by 
Raffael. He nears the by-line, then cuts back to Dahoud, just to the right of 
the City D. Dahoud puts his foot through the ball, but sends his shot miles 
over the bar. City could do with hearing the half-time whistle here. They’re 
not being over-run as such, but every time Gladbach launch an attack, they’re 
finding all sorts of holes in the City back line.
