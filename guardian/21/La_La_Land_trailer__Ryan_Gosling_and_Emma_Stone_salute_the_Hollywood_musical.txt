Soundtracked by Gosling crooning an original song, City of Stars, La La Land 
reveals itself as self-conscious homage to the traditional Hollywood musical 
and the city of Los Angeles itself – both referenced in the title.According to 
the Wrap 
<http://www.thewrap.com/miles-teller-emma-watson-circling-damien-chazelles-musical-la-la-land-exclusive/>
 back in 2014, the film “follows a pair of dreamers – aspiring actress Mia, 
who’s lonely and desperate to fit in, and cocky, charismatic jazz pianist 
Sebastian – who fall in love in Los Angeles”. Miles Teller (star of Whiplash) 
and Emma Watson were first mooted, but Gosling and Stone have ended up with the 
roles.

The trailer immediately recalls the high water marks of the homage-to-musicals 
genre: Woody Allen’s Everyone Says I Love You, Francis Ford Coppola’s One from 
the Heart and Martin Scorsese’s New York, New York, with its contemporary 
setting and explicitly artificial sets.La La Land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/la-la-land> also appears to thread in some of 
the more sinister elements of LA noir reminiscent of Mulholland Drive and LA 
Confidential.

La La Land is due for general release on 2 December in the US and 13 January 
in the UK.
