Everton will have to wait another week to see who they will meet in the FA Cup 
third round afterCheltenham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cheltenham> 
and Hereford drew 1-1 at Whaddon Road.

Cheltenham dominated the opening stages, with Billy Jones having a free-kick 
deflected for a corner and Steve Elliott and Kaid Mohamed being denied by 
Hereford's goalkeeper, James Bittner.

The pressure finally paid off for the hosts on 16 minutes when a slick pass 
from Marlon Pack found Jermaine McGlashan down the right and his low cross was 
neatly flicked over the line by Shaun Harrad.

Jake Taylor glanced a header wide as Cheltenham continued to push but, after 
being on the back foot for so long,Hereford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hereford> levelled with their first 
attack of the game. Ryan Bowman's cross found Josh O'Keefe and although his 
initial header was pushed out by the goalkeeper Scott Brown, O'Keefe powered in 
the rebound.

The second half was more even, with both sides having chances to snatch the 
game. Kaid Mohamed twice tested Bittner with long-range efforts and Will Evans 
had an effort tipped over the bar at the other end.
