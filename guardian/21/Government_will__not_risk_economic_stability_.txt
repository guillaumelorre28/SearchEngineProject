Trade and industry Secretary Stephen Byers said today that the government 
would not risk Britain's hard-won economic stability with a rash wave of public 
spending.

Mr Byers said prime minister Tony Blair would hammer home Labour's message of 
prudence in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) annual 
conference in Birmingham this morning.

"I would expect the prime minister to make it absolutely clear that we are 
going to continue to steer a course of economic stability," Mr Byers told BBC 
radio.

"That is very important for business. An irresponsible increase in public 
spending would... lead us back to the old days of boom and bust," he said.

Mr Byers, speaking of a "new coalition between a Labour government and 
business", said the prime minister would stress it was in the national interest 
for British businesses to flourish.

"The reality is we will only prosper as a society if we have businesses doing 
well, that can provide jobs to our people. That gives us sound public finances 
to invest in public services," he said.

Deflecting criticism from Labour's own backbench MPs that the government was 
wooing wealthy business people while planning to trim incapacity benefits to 
the needy, Mr Byers insisted public spending would benefit from a healthy 
business sector.

"We can achieve economic efficiency... and at at the same time achieve social 
justice... Economic efficiency and social justice are not incompatible, they 
are two sides of the same coin," he said.
