However, Stevenage confirmed <https://twitter.com/StevenageFC> on their 
Twitter account that the former Tottenham and Manchester United forward will 
not take to the field.

They said: “There’s been lots of media speculation on Teddy dusting off his 
boots, however we have an update for you.

“Contrary to speculation we can confirm that neither Teddy Sheringham nor 
Kevin Watson will feature in the Herts Senior Cup game at WGC.

“ With a number of squad injuries and the FA Youth Cup game just 48 hours 
before this fixture, both were registered in case they were required.”

Sheringham took over at Stevenage last summer for what is his first managerial 
role. They are 20th in League Two.
