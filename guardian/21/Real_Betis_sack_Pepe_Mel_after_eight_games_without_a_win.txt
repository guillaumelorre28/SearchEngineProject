Real Betis <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realbetis> have sacked Pepe 
Mel after more than a month without a win left the Seville-based club hovering 
just above the La Liga relegation places.

“The board of Real Betis has decided tonight to sack [Pepe Mel] as coach of 
the club’s first team,” Betis said in a statement on their website.

They did not immediately name a successor but said the president, Juan Carlos 
Ollero, and the sporting director, Eduardo Macía, would hold a news conference 
later.

Mel, who has also coached Getafe, Rayo Vallecano and West Bromwich Albion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/12/west-bromwich-part-company-pepe-mel>
, was appointed Betis coach for a second time in December 2014 and led them to 
promotion by winning the second division.

They last won in La Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> 
at the end of November and Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Getafe, their eighth outing 
without a victory in all competitions, left them in 15th place, five points 
above the drop zone.

Their next game is Tuesday’s King’s Cup last-16 second leg at their city 
rivals Sevilla. They lost the first leg 2-0.
