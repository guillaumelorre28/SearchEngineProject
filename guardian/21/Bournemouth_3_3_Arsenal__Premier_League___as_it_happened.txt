But could Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have won 
it...?
James Dall (@JamesDallESPN) 
I enjoyed Ox looking vexed that Giroud was celebrating rather than running 
back for kick off.

Meanwhile, the Vitality is yer place for entertainment this season: 3-3 from 
3-0 today, 4-3 from 3-1 in the game against Liverpool, 6-1 against Hull, a 3-2 
defeat in extra-time to Preston in the EFL Cup. Lovely stuff.

So Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> produce a brilliant 
comeback, but potentially lose further ground on Chelsea at the top, and remain 
in striking distance of Tottenham. That game tomorrow is really a no-win for 
them...

A weird result: Bournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> 
probably would’ve taken the draw before the game but walk off dejected, while a 
point isn’t a huge amount of use to Arsenal but they depart the scene relieved.

The Bournemouth players aren’t happy about the sending off, with the excellent 
Arter giving a big sarcastic thumbs up to the officiating team, before 
declaring Oliver an “effing joke.”

90 mins + 4: Arter works himself some space on the right of the box and bashes 
a shot towards goal, which Cech saves and just as well too - if he hadn’t got

90 mins + 2: Xhaka curls a cross into the area, Giroud rises and gets a

spectacular as the scorpion kick the other day, but it’s sure as hell more 
important.

89 mins: Sanchez slips a pass through to Perez, but that’s too far ahead of 
him. Will they hold out?

87 mins: Arsenal claim a handball for a cross that just seemed to thud into 
Smith’s tummy. No penalty, and it’s worth noting that referee Oliver has had a 
pretty decent game tonight. There was the potential shove for Bournemouth’s 
third, but that was borderline.

86 mins: Sanchez chips over the defensive line for Ramsey, but instead of 
controlling the ball as he possibly had time to do, he tries an incredibly 
difficult spinning volley and skews it wide. Boruc is booked for taking his 
sweet time over the goal kick.

85 mins: Arsenal most definitely have the sniff now, and Sanchez clips a ball 
to the back post where Giroud...somehow doesn’t head home. Big pressure on the
Bournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> goal, and 
presumably will be for about ten minutes...

RED CARD - Francis

Bournemouth down to ten as Francis goes over the ball on Ramsey - there wasn’t 
a huge amount of contact, but that was a dangerous challenge. Big problems now 
forBournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth>.

82 mins: And that leads to a glorious chance - Gosling finds himself in the 
box, spins and gets around Giroud, defending for some reason, but hoys the shot

calf, and before more damage is done he’s off, Adam Smith replacing him.

66 mins: More danger from Fraser, as he skips around Mustafi and is through on 
goal, but the slightly unlikely figure of Oxlade-Chamberlain swoops in to save 
the day.

And that’s your lot from this one. Thanks for reading!
 
But could Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have won 
it...?
James Dall (@JamesDallESPN) 
I enjoyed Ox looking vexed that Giroud was celebrating rather than running 
back for kick off.
 <https://twitter.com/JamesDallESPN/status/816400988898725888> January 3, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/JamesDallESPN/status/816400988898725888>  
Meanwhile, the Vitality is yer place for entertainment this season: 3-3 from 
3-0 today, 4-3 from 3-1 in the game against Liverpool, 6-1 against Hull, a 3-2 
defeat in extra-time to Preston in the EFL Cup. Lovely stuff.
 
So Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> produce a brilliant 
comeback, but potentially lose further ground on Chelsea at the top, and remain 
in striking distance of Tottenham. That game tomorrow is really a no-win for 
them...
 
A weird result: Bournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> 
probably would’ve taken the draw before the game but walk off dejected, while a 
point isn’t a huge amount of use to Arsenal but they depart the scene relieved.

The Bournemouth players aren’t happy about the sending off, with the excellent 
Arter giving a big sarcastic thumbs up to the officiating team, before 
declaring Oliver an “effing joke.”

What a game!
 
90 mins + 5: Gosling tries to bring the ball out of defence but is blocked off 
by Xhaka.
 
90 mins + 4: Arter works himself some space on the right of the box and bashes 
a shot towards goal, which Cech saves and just as well too - if he hadn’t got 
his hands to that it might have taken his head clean off.
 
90 mins + 3: Both teams think they can win this one now...
 
90 mins + 2: Xhaka curls a cross into the area, Giroud rises and gets a 
brilliant glancing header into the bottom corner. It might not have been as 
spectacular as the scorpion kick the other day, but it’s sure as hell more 
important.

They’ve done it!
 
90 mins + 1: The first of six minutes added time...
 
90 mins: Time-wasting/vital tactical sub for Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> - Brad Smith is on for 
Wilson, who opts for the textbook technique of shaking hands with the ref on 
his way off the pitch.
 
89 mins: Sanchez slips a pass through to Perez, but that’s too far ahead of 
him. Will they hold out?
 
87 mins: Arsenal claim a handball for a cross that just seemed to thud into 
Smith’s tummy. No penalty, and it’s worth noting that referee Oliver has had a 
pretty decent game tonight. There was the potential shove for Bournemouth’s 
third, but that was borderline.
 
86 mins: Sanchez chips over the defensive line for Ramsey, but instead of 
controlling the ball as he possibly had time to do, he tries an incredibly 
difficult spinning volley and skews it wide. Boruc is booked for taking his 
sweet time over the goal kick.
 
85 mins: Arsenal most definitely have the sniff now, and Sanchez clips a ball 
to the back post where Giroud...somehow doesn’t head home. Big pressure on the
Bournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> goal, and 
presumably will be for about ten minutes...
 
Bournemouth down to ten as Francis goes over the ball on Ramsey - there wasn’t 
a huge amount of contact, but that was a dangerous challenge. Big problems now 
forBournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth>.

82 mins: And that leads to a glorious chance - Gosling finds himself in the 
box, spins and gets around Giroud, defending for some reason, but hoys the shot 
wide.
 
81 mins: Wilson toiling up top on his own, but he does manage to retain 
possession.Bournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> push 
up and do the sensible thing, by knocking it around high up the pitch for a bit.
 
79 mins: Yellow card for Mustafi after a fairly routine foul on Wilson - but 
that wasn’t his first routine foul, so a yellow it is.
 
78 mins: Bournemouth look rather nervy now. And with good reason....
 
75 mins: Smashing goal, as Xhaka plays a ball into Giroud, he flicks it up in 
the air and to the left of the box, where the substitute Perez absolutely 
leathers a volley into the far corner. Suddenly theArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> fans have hope...

in the game. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA  
It’s on!
 
74 mins: A ball is clipped over the top of the defence for Sanchez, he brings 
it down and almost has a shot from close range, but the linesman puts his flag 
up signalling, quite rightly, a handball.

72 mins: Because Eddie Howe could do with some advice from a 
minute-by-minuter, the best way for them to go now would be as they were just 
after half-time. They briefly looked as if they would go into their collective 
shell and sit back, but then went on the front foot. If they do that again, 
they should be fine.
 
70 mins: Simple one: Giroud flicks on a cross at the near-post, and Sanchez is
