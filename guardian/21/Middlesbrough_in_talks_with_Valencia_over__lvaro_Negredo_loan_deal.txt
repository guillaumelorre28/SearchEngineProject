However, the negotiations are proving painstaking with Boro seeking an initial 
loan agreement without taking on full responsibility for the player’s existing 
financial package.

Discussions are understood to have been going on for some time and, though 
progress has been made, any deal remains distant.

The Spaniard, born in Madrid, scored 23 goals in his one season at City before 
returning to Spain to joinValencia

a £19m permanent switch.

He has managed five league goals in each of his last two La Liga campaigns, 
although his physical presence has proved a weapon.

Boro have also been credited with interest in Negredo’s club-mate Antonio 
Barragan, a 29-year-old right-back.
