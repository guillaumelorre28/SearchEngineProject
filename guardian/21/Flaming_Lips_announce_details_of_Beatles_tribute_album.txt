The Flaming Lips <https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-flaming-lips> have 
shared details of their upcoming tribute to Sgt.Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club 
Band, which includes Beatles covers by artists including J Mascis, Miley Cyrus, 
Tegan & Sara and Tool’s Maynard James Keenan.

Wayne Coyne announced the news on Instagram <http://instagram.com/p/rI07HaJ-y1>
, with a handwritten tracklist and a caption incorporating 19 exclamation 
marks. “Yessssss!!” he wrote. “Lots of great stuff !!!!!!!! Wow!!!! It’s really 
gonna happen!!!!!”

Initial details of what is being called With a Little Help from My Fwends were 
unveiledearlier this year

, including a handful of its participants, a release date (28 October), and 
news that proceeds would go to benefit Oklahoma City’s pet-friendly Bella 
Foundation.In July

, the Lips offered up one of the most bizarre promotional clipsof all time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/08/watch-miley-cyrus-video-with-flaming-lips>
: Blonde SuperFreak Steals the Magic Brain, starring Coyne, Cyrus and Moby, was 
initially supposed to be a music video for their version of Lucy in the Sky 
with Diamonds.


“I don’t know if it was for creative or legal reasons, but Wayne changed the 
Lucy audio to this very experimental, David Lynch-like psychedelic soundbed, 
ultimately,” Moby toldSpin magazine 
<http://www.spin.com/articles/moby-interview-miley-cyrus-flaming-lips-video-lsd/>
. He also helpfully explained the video’s plot: “I’m an evil wizard and I 
desperately want JFK’s brain because encoded therein is the original recipe for 
LSD. I command my naked minion to go steal the brain from Miley Cyrus, who is 
livid. She then contacts Melty-Face Bigfoot and Weird Santa Claus, who are in a 
spaceship orbiting the earth, and commands them to battle my naked minion.”

With this new tracklist, Coyne has laid out the full extent of the Lips’ 
collaborative take on the Fab Four’s magnum opus. Besides two songs with Cyrus, 
there’s a title track team-up by Dinosaur Jr’s J Mascis, Fever the Ghost and My 
Morning Jacket. On the reprise it’s Foxygen jamming with MGMT. Other 
contributors include Dr Dog, Phantogram, Juliana Barwick and Grace Potter.

Lately, the Flaming Lips have been in the habit of curating and coordinating 
bizarro tribute records. Past volumes include face-melting versions of Pink 
Floyd’sDark Side of the Moon

King Crimson’sIn the Court of the Crimson King 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/13/flaming-lips-king-crimson-album>
, and the Stone Roses’self-titled debut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/06/stone-roses-flaming-lips-cover>. 
The band’s last studio LP, The Terror, came out in 2013.
