Teddy Sheringham responded to his sacking as Stevenage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stevenage> manager by going to their next 
game in disguise.

The former England striker’s eight-month spell in charge ended last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/01/teddy-sheringham-sacked-stevenage>
 after only seven wins from his 33 games. But rather than avoid Stevenage’s 
first result after his dismissal, Sheringham turned up in the crowd for the 
game against Crawley to see how players and fans reacted.

“I got the sack on the Monday and Stevenage were playing at home and I wanted 
to see how they reacted to my sacking, so I went to the game on the Saturday 
incognito,”he told The Times 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/article4687930.ece>.

“I went in disguise, put it that way. I wanted to see what the reaction of the 
players and supporters would be. I just wanted to get a vibe of how things 
were. I’m still concerned, I don’t want to see Stevenage relegated. Was there 
something I wasn’t doing, was something better with me not there?”

Stevenage lost to Crawley but won at Hartlepool on Tuesday night, leaving them 
11 points clear of the relegation zone.

Sheringham said he is aware his reputation as a manager is far from high – but 
hopes another club will give him a chance.

“If I can’t do it at Stevenage in League Two, who else is going to touch me – 
that was my initial reaction and my apprehension about taking the job in the 
first place,” he added. “But it is about learning and growing, and I feel 
better equipped now. If I get a chance now, I don’t have to make those 
mistakes.”
