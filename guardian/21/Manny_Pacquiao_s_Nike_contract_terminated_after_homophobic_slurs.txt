Nike has terminated its contract with the boxer Manny Pacquiao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/manny-pacquiao> after he claimed people in 
same-sex relationships are “worse than animals”.

Nike released a statement on Wednesday that read: “We find Manny Pacquiao’s 
comments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/16/manny-pacquiao-gay-people-worse-than-animals>
 abhorrent. Nike strongly opposes discrimination of any kind and has a long 
history of supporting and standing up for the rights of the LGBT community. We 
no longer have a relationship with Manny Pacquiao.”

The 37-year-old, who is running for a seat in the Philippines senate in May’s 
elections as a conservative Christian, made the remark in a video posted on 
local station TV5’s election site.

“It’s common sense,” the eight-times world champion, who later apologised, 
said. “Do you see animals mating with the same sex? Animals are better because 
they can distinguish male from female. If men mate with men and women mate with 
women they are worse than animals.”

Pacquiao initially appeared unrepentant with a post on Instagram stating he 
was “just telling the truth of what the Bible says”.

However, he later wrote on Facebook he was “not condemning LGBT”, while still 
voicing his opposition for gay marriage.

The country’s most popular gay comedian, Vice Ganda, posted 
#PrayForMannyPacquiao to his 6.7 m illionfollowers on Twitter as he hit back at 
the boxer, adding: “Some people think they can judge people like God just 
because they’ve attended a prayer meeting and read the Bible. The senate needs 
experts on politics and law, not blind prophets.”

Pacquiao, who was beaten by Floyd Mayweather

 last year in the “fight of the century”, is due to face Timothy Bradley Jr in 
April.
