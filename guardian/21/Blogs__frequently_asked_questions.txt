Why can't I see my older comments on my user profile page?
We launched our registration system on April 13 2006. At present we will only 
be migrating comments that were submitted by registered, signed-in readers from 
that date to the present day. Comments submitted before April 13 2006 will not 
be visible on readers' profile pages.

The blogs affected are the News blog (created September 2004), the Politics 
blog (created September 2004) and Mortarboard (created February 2006). Articles 
written on these blogs before April 13 2006 will not have any comments, 
however, we are working on migrating as many of these comments as possible at a 
later date.

Why are my comments not displaying in reverse chronological order on my 
profile page?
The comments that we have imported from the old platform to the new platform 
will display at the end of articles in reverse chronological order, with the 
five most recent comments displaying under the article. On readers' profile 
pages, comments will display in the order in which they are imported into 
Pluck, the new comment platform. We plan to do some further work to reorder 
these comments into reverse chronological order, but this will not take place 
until all blogs have been migrated onto the new platform.
