Final thoughts:

Australia will head to the Four Nations with confidence after this fairly 
comfortable win over a NZ side that had more sting in defence that offence. 
Time and again they failed to complete their sets, and often they handed the 
ball over the Australia on the last after running a play that no-one seemed to 
know a thing about, much less the person with the ball. Their kicking was 
awful. Outside of a 20m period into halftime —a period that followed their only 
try to Proctor— NZ were clearly second best. But they’ve had a fair layoff 
since the end of the NRL season and I wouldn’t be writing off their Four 
Nations chances just yet.

Australia weren’t exactly polished but they showed far greater composure and 
their left side attack looked particularly potent. All three debutants (Boyd, 
Holmes and Frizell) did well but it was old-hand Inglis who caused the most 
trouble, and he ended up as man of the match. As usual captain Smith and half 
Cronk kept the side well-oiled.

And that’s that. Thanks for coming. See you next time.

Cameron Smith talks: “Really pleasing to finish it off that way. Mal spoke all 
week about being a professional outfit ... and I though we played a really 
clinical second 40.”

Jesse Bromwich: “We let ourselves down in that second half and we have a lot 
to work on,” he says. After hearing NZ completed just 11 sets he adds; “You 
can’t do that against them and expect to win.”

Try! Australia 24-6 New Zealand (Cordner 79)

That’s the icing on the cake. From centrefield, 20m out, Smith passes left to 
Thurston who holds the ball up and finds Cordner running a good line on his 
outside. Cordner bumps Johnson aside and runs 10m to score.

74m: No try. Johnson kicked across field for Kata and it’s debatable whether 
or not he touched down for a try after Ferguson tried and failed to bat the 
dropping ball dead. The thing is, he was offside before that point so his 
grounding matters not. As you were.

72m: Holmes takes another bomb from Johnson. I can’t see NZ getting home now. 
A good 20m before halftime aside they’ve been off the pace and their execution 
has been that of a team who have not played a lot of football over the past six 
weeks.

Gould now says NZ can’t beat Australia in the Four Nations going on what he’s 
seen tonight. Seems premature to make a call like that.

Try! Australia 18-6 New Zealand (Inglis 68m)

That could be the game! From close in, Matt Scott wrestled forward and drew in 
defenders like zombies on the sniff. From the play the ball Cam Smith grubbered 
on the diagonal. It hit Inglis on the back of the legs as he entered the Kiwis’ 
in-goal and he turned and touched the ball down for the try.

Was he offside? No. But it seems Inglis might have been running a decoy and 
that the kick was aimed for Thurston who was outside Inglis. No matter. Still a 
try.

Kenny-Dowall was the culprit this time.

59m: The ball hits the deck as Australia throw it about on the last, and that 
fact opens up the defence. Thurston banks like a jet through two tacklers 
before dinking a kick ahead for Cronk. He might have got their first but for 
the wicked bounce it took.

NZ clear but again butcher a last tackle play after Johnson was set upon as he 
was about to kick. They knock on on their own 40m.

57m: Thurston goes desperately close before Australia run it right. Wide out, 
after a string of passes, Dugan does well to get his arms free for a flick pass 
to Ferguson on his outside. Ferguson steps inside and looks bound for the line 
but as he spun clear of the cover defenders the ball spun clear of his arms!

55m: A midfield bust from Gillett puts Australia back on the offensive. He’s 
in open space but he can’t find a runner. A few tackles later Morgan runs 
towards his left winger and, as the sideline looms, he flicks the ball back 
inside. Holmes is tackled in the act of catching and the ball comes loose. A 
big call: the ref rules a NZ knock-on.

50m: Taupau bursts between Scott and Thaiday and runs 30m before he doesn’t 
attempt to sidestep the approaching Boyd. No, he’s content to run through him. 
But he’s pulled down by the cover.

 Yet NZ waste a good opportunity by over-egging the pudding. The pudding being 
the grubber kick. It runs dead, marshalled into the badlands by Ferguson.

47m: Taupau trips Thurston as he races through to put pressure on Kahu after 
an Aussie kick. He’s pinged for it, too. But from the resulting penalty 
Australia spin the ball right and throw a forward pass that Nightingale knocks 
down. It’s called forward, too, and you could say it’s not the first time that 
should have happened tonight. Aussie fans on Twitter have not been happy with 
the Johnson pass for Proctor’s try earlier.

From the left touchline, with the wind blowing towards the posts, Thurston 
aims it way right and the curl and the wind bring it home.

Try! Australia 12-6 New Zealand (Holmes 43)

No, Kenny-Dowall carried the ball with too little security. A swift effective 
counter by Australia. Ninja-like. Holmes showed great toe to win the race to 
the line, too.

Possible try to Australia

Kenny-Dowall loses the ball on his own 20m line with Morgan on him like a Dora 
the Explorer backpack. Did Morgan strip the ball illegally before Thurston 
picked up, passed left to Inglis and the big centre found Holmes who streaked 
away to touchdown just inside the corner post?

43 min: Johnson grubbers behind the line but Holmes, who’s had a strong debut 
so far, attacks the ball and get out of his own in-goal with ease. Frizell then 
makes some nice inroads, before Thurston rips the ball downfield.

42m: Gillett spills it under pressure from Manu Ma’u. So it’s the Kiwis on the 
attack, Blair carrying a defender to the 20m line.

Peeeeeeep!

41m: Are we’re off! Plenty of mistakes that first half and a bit of rust but 
it sure had some sting, particularly from the Kiwis who have been hitting hard 
and sometimes high. The Aussies have a breeze at the backs this half, which 
should help their kickers.

37 min: Morgan, 20m out from the Kiwi line, drops another one with Johnson 
hanging off his arm. He looked for an offload but he only had one arm.

Cordner’s been forced to leave the field to treat that head wound which has 
beaten the first attempt to stop the blood flowing. Frizell comes on for his 
debut.

35m: Cronk almost puts Gillett over with a short ball! But Leuluai pulls him 
down just short. Tackle! Later in the set Nightingale climbs highest to defuse 
a bomb just as it seemed Ferguson was set to take it and score.

34 min: Now Kenny-Dowall messes up the play-the-ball such was his haste to 
give his team quick possession. Aussie scrum 25m out from the Kiwi line.

We’ve just seen a replay of Thurston getting hit by Blair as if by a runaway 
piano.

32 min: NZ pound the Aussies, looking for a half-time lead, but their defence 
holds. On the last Johnson kicks high to Holmes’ wing again. The charging 
Rapana knocks it on as he reaches over Holmes. Aussies restart from the 20m.

28 min: Strong carry from Taupau before Johnson puts up another bomb to 
Holmes’ wing. The debutant does very well to catch that under all sorts of 
pressure.

Moments later a head clash opens up a cut on Cordner’s head and every vampire 
from Kalgoorlie to Bon Temps, Louisiana, sits up, suddenly alert.

26 min: After another good Kiwi set another bomb goes up. This time it’s the 
other Aussie winger, Holmes, taking a bomb under pressure on his own line.

Final thoughts:

Australia will head to the Four Nations with confidence after this fairly 
comfortable win over a NZ side that had more sting in defence that offence. 
Time and again they failed to complete their sets, and often they handed the 
ball over the Australia on the last after running a play that no-one seemed to 
know a thing about, much less the person with the ball. Their kicking was 
awful. Outside of a 20m period into halftime —a period that followed their only 
try to Proctor— NZ were clearly second best. But they’ve had a fair layoff 
since the end of the NRL season and I wouldn’t be writing off their Four 
Nations chances just yet.

Australia weren’t exactly polished but they showed far greater composure and 
their left side attack looked particularly potent. All three debutants (Boyd, 
Holmes and Frizell) did well but it was old-hand Inglis who caused the most 
trouble, and he ended up as man of the match. As usual captain Smith and half 
Cronk kept the side well-oiled.

And that’s that. Thanks for coming. See you next time.
 
Cameron Smith talks: “Really pleasing to finish it off that way. Mal spoke all 
week about being a professional outfit ... and I though we played a really 
clinical second 40.”

Jesse Bromwich: “We let ourselves down in that second half and we have a lot 
to work on,” he says. After hearing NZ completed just 11 sets he adds; “You 
can’t do that against them and expect to win.”
 
A comprehensive win for the Aussies, their second on the trot against New 
Zealand who were off the pace for most of the match.
 
80m: Australia get time to absorb three tackles before the siren sounds and 
it’s hugs all round.
 
Easy peasy.
 
That’s the icing on the cake. From centrefield, 20m out, Smith passes left to 
Thurston who holds the ball up and finds Cordner running a good line on his 
outside. Cordner bumps Johnson aside and runs 10m to score.
 
77m: We’re being reminded that Aaron Woods and Josh Mansour are in the wings 
for Four Nations selection. I’d have Mansour in for Ferguson. I’ve never been 
convinced about the Rooster.
 
74m: No try. Johnson kicked across field for Kata and it’s debatable whether 
or not he touched down for a try after Ferguson tried and failed to bat the 
dropping ball dead. The thing is, he was offside before that point so his 
grounding matters not. As you were.
 
74m: A hit up from Taumalolo who has not had a lot of impact tonight....

Hold the phone, Kata is claiming a try in the left corner...
 
72m: Holmes takes another bomb from Johnson. I can’t see NZ getting home now. 
A good 20m before halftime aside they’ve been off the pace and their execution 
has been that of a team who have not played a lot of football over the past six 
weeks.

Gould now says NZ can’t beat Australia in the Four Nations going on what he’s 
seen tonight. Seems premature to make a call like that.
 
Another one from the left, another one curled over with a right-to-left banana.
 
That could be the game! From close in, Matt Scott wrestled forward and drew in 
defenders like zombies on the sniff. From the play the ball Cam Smith grubbered 
on the diagonal. It hit Inglis on the back of the legs as he entered the Kiwis’ 
in-goal and he turned and touched the ball down for the try.

Was he offside? No. But it seems Inglis might have been running a decoy and 
that the kick was aimed for Thurston who was outside Inglis. No matter. Still a 
try.
 
66m: After an Aussie set the Kiwis get the ball back but again lose it. 
Kenny-Dowall was the culprit this time.

The crowd? An educated one. Some 20,283 souls.
 
63m: Bromwich drops the ball cold on the Aussie 30m on the fifth. An ‘oh dear’ 
moment.
 
61m: The Aussies go right and Dugan is brilliantly bundled into touch by Kata 
and Nightingale.
 
59m: The ball hits the deck as Australia throw it about on the last, and that 
fact opens up the defence. Thurston banks like a jet through two tacklers 
before dinking a kick ahead for Cronk. He might have got their first but for 
the wicked bounce it took.

NZ clear but again butcher a last tackle play after Johnson was set upon as he 
was about to kick. They knock on on their own 40m.
 
57m: Thurston goes desperately close before Australia run it right. Wide out, 
after a string of passes, Dugan does well to get his arms free for a flick pass 
to Ferguson on his outside. Ferguson steps inside and looks bound for the line 
but as he spun clear of the cover defenders the ball spun clear of his arms!
 
55m: A midfield bust from Gillett puts Australia back on the offensive. He’s 
in open space but he can’t find a runner. A few tackles later Morgan runs 
towards his left winger and, as the sideline looms, he flicks the ball back 
inside. Holmes is tackled in the act of catching and the ball comes loose. A 
big call: the ref rules a NZ knock-on.
 
53m: Smith lies all over Nightingale and is penalised. A pressure reliever for 
NZ who were pinned inside their own 20m.
 
52m: Phil Gould has been giving it to NZ for their poor kicking and 
fifth-tackle options. Hard to argue with him.
 
50m: Taupau bursts between Scott and Thaiday and runs 30m before he doesn’t 
attempt to sidestep the approaching Boyd. No, he’s content to run through him. 
But he’s pulled down by the cover.

 Yet NZ waste a good opportunity by over-egging the pudding. The pudding being 
the grubber kick. It runs dead, marshalled into the badlands by Ferguson.
 
47m: Taupau trips Thurston as he races through to put pressure on Kahu after 
an Aussie kick. He’s pinged for it, too. But from the resulting penalty 
Australia spin the ball right and throw a forward pass that Nightingale knocks 
down. It’s called forward, too, and you could say it’s not the first time that 
should have happened tonight. Aussie fans on Twitter have not been happy with 
the Johnson pass for Proctor’s try earlier.
 
From the left touchline, with the wind blowing towards the posts, Thurston 
aims it way right and the curl and the wind bring it home.
 
No, Kenny-Dowall carried the ball with too little security. A swift effective 
counter by Australia. Ninja-like. Holmes showed great toe to win the race to 
the line, too.
 
Kenny-Dowall loses the ball on his own 20m line with Morgan on him like a Dora 
the Explorer backpack. Did Morgan strip the ball illegally before Thurston 
picked up, passed left to Inglis and the big centre found Holmes who streaked 
away to touchdown just inside the corner post?
 
43 min: Johnson grubbers behind the line but Holmes, who’s had a strong debut 
so far, attacks the ball and get out of his own in-goal with ease. Frizell then 
makes some nice inroads, before Thurston rips the ball downfield.

42m: Gillett spills it under pressure from Manu Ma’u. So it’s the Kiwis on the 
attack, Blair carrying a defender to the 20m line.
 
41m: Are we’re off! Plenty of mistakes that first half and a bit of rust but 
it sure had some sting, particularly from the Kiwis who have been hitting hard 
and sometimes high. The Aussies have a breeze at the backs this half, which 
should help their kickers.
 
About to kick-off again, folks. 
 
A half of two halves, that one. Back in a tic.

40m: Nup.
 
39 min: The Kiwis make a meal of their last play, running to the blindside 
with no plan. They turn it over. Can the Aussies, 50m out, make them pay in the 
shadows of halftime?
 
37 min: Morgan, 20m out from the Kiwi line, drops another one with Johnson 
hanging off his arm. He looked for an offload but he only had one arm.

Cordner’s been forced to leave the field to treat that head wound which has 
beaten the first attempt to stop the blood flowing. Frizell comes on for his 
debut.
 
35m: Cronk almost puts Gillett over with a short ball! But Leuluai pulls him 
down just short. Tackle! Later in the set Nightingale climbs highest to defuse 
a bomb just as it seemed Ferguson was set to take it and score.
 
34 min: Now Kenny-Dowall messes up the play-the-ball such was his haste to 
give his team quick possession. Aussie scrum 25m out from the Kiwi line.

We’ve just seen a replay of Thurston getting hit by Blair as if by a runaway 
piano.
 
32 min: NZ pound the Aussies, looking for a half-time lead, but their defence 
holds. On the last Johnson kicks high to Holmes’ wing again. The charging 
Rapana knocks it on as he reaches over Holmes. Aussies restart from the 20m.
 
31 min: Speaking of momentum, here’s some. Michael Morgan gets up to play the 
ball 30m out from his own line and he loses control of the pill as Proctor 
leaves his legs lying about. Careless from Morgan. NZ ball.
 
30 min: Momentum... doesn’t it swing about? It’s all NZ now, as a scrum packs 
on the Aussie 20m.
 
28 min: Strong carry from Taupau before Johnson puts up another bomb to 
Holmes’ wing. The debutant does very well to catch that under all sorts of 
pressure.

Moments later a head clash opens up a cut on Cordner’s head and every vampire 
from Kalgoorlie to Bon Temps, Louisiana, sits up, suddenly alert.
 
26 min: After another good Kiwi set another bomb goes up. This time it’s the 
other Aussie winger, Holmes, taking a bomb under pressure on his own line.
