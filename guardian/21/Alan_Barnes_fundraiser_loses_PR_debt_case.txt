A woman dubbed the angel of the north after she started a fundraiser for 
mugging victim Alan Barnes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/16/muggim-victim-alan-barnes-offers-small-donation-fundraiser-katie-cutler>
 has said she will give up charity work after losing a legal dispute with her 
former public relations handler.

Katie Cutler was ordered to pay £6,200 plus legal costs to Claire Barber PR.

During the hearing at Newcastle <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/newcastle> 
county court it emerged that Barber, who is visually impaired, took Barnes to a 
bank and he had written her a cheque for the amount Cutler owed, but she had 
not cashed the cheque.

Cutler, from Greenside, Gateshead, had set up an online fundraising page for 
Barnes last year after he was attacked in the street, raising £330,00. Cutler 
used the widespread publicity to start a foundation to help other good causes.

After the decision on Wednesday, she spoke outside the court: “I am happy I 
have done some nice things and have helped some people who sadly are not with 
us now.

“Because of this [court case], I will not do any more charity work, I will not 
do anything for anyone else.

“I am so disappointed how someone can try to belittle someone.”

Cutler said she had not received money raised recently from two online 
donation sites which were set up to help her pay her PR bill.

After the hearing, Barber, who runs her Northumberland-based business with one 
of her daughters, said the strain of the case had been “intolerable” and that 
she had been the victim of online trolling since details of the legal dispute 
emerged.

She said Barnes had felt pressured to step in to help Cutler by people on 
social media, and that was why he had written her the cheque, which she has not 
cashed.

She said: “Alan Barnes felt tremendously pressurised, he has also been 
trolled. Everyone knows Alan has a disability. He is a really lovely guy.

“I didn’t know what to do because it’s not Alan that owes the money so I held 
on to the cheque and waited to speak to the judge to see what to do.

“But it’s not Alan who owes the money, it is Katie.”

During the hearing it emerged that Cutler sent an email to Barber in March 
last year which said: “I formally appoint you as my official PR for both Katie 
Cutler and Acts of Kindness [a charity she intended to start] at a daily rate 
of £550.”

The judge, Nathan Adams, said the disputed bill came down to contract law and 
he turned down Cutler’s application to challenge a previous county court 
judgment in favour of Barber.

Barber acted for Cutler for four months and told the court she probably worked 
“triple” the 14-and-a-half hours that she billed her client.

The PR handler said she had waited more than a year to be paid and her small 
business could not afford to work for free.

She told the hearing her business had built up an “impeccable reputation”. 

Cutler said she got her mother to speak to the county court when a letter came 
warning her of the legal action.

She said part of the delay in her responding happened when she asked Barnes if 
he would help her pay the bill, and he declined.

“He didn’t give me an answer straight away,” Cutler said. “He said: ‘No’, then 
I was back to square one.”

She became upset when she recalled being under “so much stress”, adding: “I 
did bury my head in the sand a little bit.”

Her story was picked up by the media after she was threatened with bailiffs 
when she did not settle the bill, despite a first county court hearing which 
found against her.

Cutler explained she sent the email to Barber setting out their agreement on 
the instruction of the PR handler during a meeting at a hotel in Newcastle upon 
Tyne.

“I didn’t think about it,” she said. “It’s probably the most stupidest thing I 
have ever done. At no point did I think I would have to pay for this.”
