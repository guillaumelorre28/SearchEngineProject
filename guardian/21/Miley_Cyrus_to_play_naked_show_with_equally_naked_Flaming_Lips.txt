In what may be a bid to create the most Googleable search term ever for a gig, 
Wayne Coyne has announced thatMiley Cyrus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus> will play a show naked, with 
the Flaming Lips – also naked – in front of a naked audience.

The Flaming Lips frontman posted on Instagram – alongside a split image of a 
seemingly unclad Lips and Cyrus – that Cyrus was planning the show for a 
forthcoming video for the song Milky Milky Milk, from the recentMiley Cyrus & 
Her Dead Petz

He added that Cyrus and the Lips would play without clothes while “milk (well, 
white stuff that looks like milk) is spewed everywhere”. The benefit of being 
naked, presumably, being that no one’s clothes are ruined by said white stuff.

Cyrus and the Lips are going out on the road in November and December as Miley 
Cyrus & her Dead Petz, playing six theatre and club shows in Chicago, Detroit, 
Washington DC, New York, Philadelphia and Boston. It is not known if any of 
those will be designated the naked show.

Both the Flaming Lips and Cyrus have previously disrobed in the name of art.
