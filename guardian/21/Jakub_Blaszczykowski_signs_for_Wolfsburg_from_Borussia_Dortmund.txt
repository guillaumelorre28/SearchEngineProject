Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> said the 
30-year-old signed a three-year contract. Both clubs agreed not to disclose the 
transfer fee though Kicker magazine reported it as being around €5m (£4.2m).

The Wolfsburg sporting director, Klaus Allofs, said: “Blaszczykowski is a 
player that will do any team good. Not only because of his footballing 
capabilities but also because he is a model of dedication, commitment and 
passion and because he gives 100% to his team.”

Blaszczykowski, who played 197 Bundesliga games for Dortmund, winning the 
league in 2011 and 2012, spent last season on loan at Fiorentina. Injuries 
hampered his time in Serie A, but he impressed at Euro 2016 with Poland, 
although he missed the decisive penalty
