1980: Wolves 1-0 Nottingham Forest 

In a tweet: Forest’s quest for three in a row ended after a calamitous 
Shilton/Needham mix-up let in Gray to score one of the easiest Wembley winners 
ever.

The key man: Jimmy Gordon. The 65-year-old Nottingham Forest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottinghamforest> trainer was chosen by 
Brian Clough to lead out the side, just reward for a man who had been there for 
his boss during the highs and lows of his managerial career.

Minute-by-minute: GOAL! Wolves 1-0 Nottingham Forest 0 (Gray 67’)
 Oh dear. Oh no. Any Forest fans, look away now. A through ball by Peter 
Daniel causes confusion between Needham and Shilton who end up colliding on the 
edge of the box, leaving Andy Gray with the simplest of tap-ins to give Wolves 
the lead. Who do you blame for that cock-up? For me, Shilton should have stayed 
at home, but I suppose if there was any doubt then Needham should have launched 
the ball into the terraces. Wolves fans will not care either way.

 Wolves 1-0 Nottingham Forest 0 (Gray 67’) 
What they said: “I blame myself entirely. I shouted for the ball but, in the 
roar of the crowd, David did not hear me and Gray was left on his own”. Peter 
Shilton’s assessment of the goal that won the cup for Wolves.

Facts: By winning the 1980 League Cup, the Wolves skipper Emlyn Hughes 
completed his collection of domestic honours. Four days later, Forest brushed 
themselves down and won 3-1 at Dynamo Berlin (winning the quarter-final 3-2 on 
aggregate) on their way to retaining the European Cup.

1981: Liverpool 1-1 West Ham (aet). Replay: Liverpool 2-1 West Ham 

In a tweet: Liverpool’s class eventually told in a replay at Villa Park, as a 
brave effort from second division West Ham fell just short.

Key man: Referee Clive Thomas. Never one to shrink into the background, Thomas 
over-ruled his linesman, who had flagged Sammy Lee offside, to allow Alan 
Kennedy’s 117th-minute strike to stand in the first match. West Ham’s players 
were furious, with even Trevor Brooking picking up a booking in the aftermath.

Minute-by-minute: GOAL! Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 1-0 West Ham (Kennedy 117)
 It may have taken nearly two hours, but we now have talking points galore at 
Wembley. After some pinball in the West Ham area and a poor Alvin Martin 
clearance, Alan Kennedy thumps in a right-footed effort from the edge of the 
box and wheels away in delight. The only issue is that Sammy Lee was laying in 
an offside position when Kennedy shot, the linesman apparently flagging only to 
be over ruled by Clive Thomas. West Ham are understandably a little bit peeved 
it has to be said, and I possibly wouldn’t take a stroll down Green Street 
later tonight if I was Mr Thomas.

What they said: “I didn’t call him [Thomas] a cheat. There were two club 
officials present when all this happened. It’s not my style to get involved in 
this sort of thing. I was never even booked as a player, let alone a manager. 
But I apologise if I have upset Clive or anyone else.” John Lyall reacts 
strongly to Thomas’ accusation that the West Ham manager had called him a cheat 
after Kennedy’s controversial goal.

Fact: This was Liverpool’s first League Cup win, a competition that they would 
go on to dominate in the early part of the 1980s.

1982: Liverpool 3-1 Tottenham Hotspur (aet) 

In a tweet: A late Whelan equaliser took the match to extra-time, where there 
was only one winner; Spurs’ marathon season caught up with them.

Key man: Ronnie Whelan. The young Irishman had only been to Wembley once 
before – watching his team-mates draw with West Ham in the previous final – but 
putting pre-match nerves aside, Whelan’s display on the day was masterful, his 
two goals crowning a fine afternoon.

Minute-by-minute: GOAL! Tottenham 1-1 Liverpool (Whelan 87) 
 Never write off Liverpool! Seemingly down and out with their grip on the 
League Cup loosening, somehow they have found a response. After an Ian Rush 
break, Tottenham appear to have dealt with the threat, yet a David Johnson 
cross from the right is swept in by 20-year-old Ronnie Whelan, and extra time 
is now looming. Whelan immediately runs off, bouncing up and down like a joyful 
rabbit in spring time. Tottenham must be feeling like a physical and emotional 
wreck after that hammer blow.

What they said: “Whelan’s goals, one three minutes from the end of normal time 
and another in the second period of extra time, demolished Tottenham’s dream of 
a four-trophy grand slam. Wembley has been the scene of many pulsating 
occasions. And this one can be ranked alongside the best. It put heavy demands 
on the hearts and minds and bodies of those taking part.” James Mossop in the 
Sunday Times.

Fact: This was the first final to be sponsored by the Milk Marketing Board.

No1: The Lion Sleeps Tonight, Tight Fit


1983: Liverpool 2-1 Manchester United (aet) 

In a tweet: Liverpool make it three in a row, needing ET again to see off 
their rivals. Injuries and a controversial Courtney decision hit United hard.

Key man: George Courtney’s decision to book Bruce Grobbelaar after his wild 
lunge on Gordon McQueen brought heavy criticism in the papers, many feeling 
that the referee should have sent the keeper off for a professional foul. It 
may not have been in the league ofWillie Young on Paul Allen 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKemltpQMgA> in the 1980 FA Cup final - 
Courtney had officiated during that match too, but the professional foul rule 
was not in place back then - yet in the climate of the time, Courtney’s actions 
were lambasted.

Minute-by-minute: GOAL! Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 1-2 Liverpool (Whelan 
98)
 It has been coming. United are simply out on their feet, the injuries to 
Moran and McQueen finally taking their toll (not to mention the absence of 
their Captain Marvel). After makeshift defender Frank Stapleton blocks an 
attempted pass by Ronnie Whelan on the edge of the box, the hero of last year 
bends a curling effort round his international team mate and past a sprawling 
Gary Bailey, to surely win the cup for Liverpool. It’s tough on United, but a 
goal worthy of winning any final.

What they said: “Lou Macari was having a try to do a George Cohen at 
right-back and Frank Stapleton went into defence to play like Charlie Hurley”. 
Manager Ron Atkinson bemoans Manchester United’s injuries on the day that saw 
Kevin Moran limp off with an ankle strain and Gordon McQueen having to hang 
around up front after pulling a hamstring.

Facts: This was the second season in a row that Liverpool would win the League 
and League Cup double (they would repeat this in 1984), the retiring Bob 
Paisley sent up the Wembley steps by Graeme Souness to collect the trophy.


No1: Is There Something I Should Know, Duran Duran


1984: Liverpool 0-0 Everton (aet). Replay Liverpool 1-0 Everton 

In a tweet: Hansen’s sleight of hand earns Liverpool a second bite at the 
cherry. A Souness thunderbolt makes it 4-in-a-row + slows theEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> revival.


Key man: Graeme Souness. His replay thunderbolt would eventually separate the 
sides, the Daily Express’ Steve Curry stating that Liverpool’s skipper “raised 
his game like a commander taking charge in the heat of battle”.


Minute-by-minute: 7 mins Liverpool and Alan Hansen appear to have got away 
with one here. Adrian Heath manages to beat Bruce Grobbelaar to a loose ball on 
the edge of the area, one that the Liverpool keeper should really have claimed, 
and whilst on the floor, the diminutive striker scoops a shot towards goal. 
Alan Hansen has spotted the danger and is able to block the effort, but in 
doing so the ball appears to strike his hand. How is that not a penalty? 
Everton fans who have barely had time to get over Bryan Hamilton’s disallowed 
goal in the last minute of the 1977 FA Cup semi may well spontaneously combust 
come the end of the match if Liverpool keep the trophy.

What they said: “I felt sorry for Everton but the last two clubs we have 
beaten in the Milk Cup, Spurs and Manchester United, have gone on to win the FA 
Cup in the same season.” Liverpool manager Joe Fagan after the replay win at 
Maine Road. Everton would indeed follow the lead of both and go on to end their 
14-year trophy drought.

Facts: Liverpool’s third Milk Cup victory meant that they kept the Milk Cup. 
The two matches were contested in front of 152,089 supporters, with gate 
receipts reaching £920,000. This was the first League Cup final to be shown 
live on television.

No1: Hello, Lionel Richie

1985: Norwich City 1-0 Sunderland 

In a tweet: Chisholm’s chest the difference as Sunderland pay the penalty for 
Walker’s missed spot kick.

Key man: Clive Walker. The man who had scored goals in the previous three 
rounds – including a fourth round replay win over Tottenham, and the semi-final 
against Chelsea – fluffed Sunderland’s best chance from the penalty spot, after 
Dennis van Wijk had been penalised for handball.

MBM: GOAL! Norwich 1-0 Sunderland (Chisholm o.g. 46)
 What has David Corner done here? Attempting to shepherd the ball out for a 
goal kick, Corner is pick pocketed by John Deehan on the by-line. The ball 
comes back to Asa Hartford, who sees his side footed effort deflected into the 
net via Gordon Chisholm’s chest. The Norwich players are delighted; the 
Sunderland defenders conversely look shocked at the catalogue of errors that 
led to that goal.

What they said: “And now I believe I can turn a little club like Norwich into 
a big one, just like Brian Clough did at Nottingham Forest, Bobby Robson at 
Ipswich and Lawrie McMenemy at Southampton.” Norwich manager Ken Brown had big 
plans for the club, yet by May he was having to revise those a little.

Facts: Both clubs would be relegated from the top flight come the end of the 
season. Norwich did not even have the consolation of playing in Europe during 
1985/86 after events at Heysel saw English clubs banned from playing on the 
Continent.

No1: Easy Lover, Philip Bailey and Phil Collins


1986: Oxford 3-0 QPR 

In a tweet: Oxford upset the odds with a Trevor Hebberd inspired display 
easing them to a win over a woeful QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2014/feb/24/league-cup-final-1986-oxford-qpr-liverpool-aston-villa>
. A penny for Jim Smith’s thoughts.

Key man: Trevor Hebberd. The man who played in every round of the 1978-79 
competition but was then left out of Southampton’s final line-up finally made 
up for his disappointment, running QPR ragged as Oxford ran out easy winners.

Minute-by-minute: GOAL! Oxford 3-0 QPR (Charles 87)
Game, set and match. John Aldridge breaks down the right and exchanges passes 
with man of the match Trevor Hebberd before unleashing a shot from 18 yards 
out. In truth Barron should have done better with Aldridge’s attempt, only 
parrying the ball into the path of a grateful Charles, who can’t miss from 
inside the six yard box. That rounds off a marvellous day for a club that two 
years ago was playing in the third division, and completes the misery for Jim 
Smith and his men.

What they said: “We were diabolical. We just froze – we were frightened of the 
occasion.” Jim Smith gives an honest assessment of QPR’s performance at Wembley.


Facts: Oxford manager Maurice Evans sent up 72-year-old trainer Ken Fish to 
collect his winners’ medal. Oxford would go on to avoid the drop from the first 
division, beatingArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> 3-0 on 
the last day of the season to send Ipswich down.

No1: A Different Corner, George Michael


1987: Arsenal 2-1 Liverpool 

In a tweet: It’s Champagne Charlie’s day at Wembley, as another case of 
one-nil down two-one up for Arsenal mucks Rush’s record up.

Key man: Charlie Nicholas. The forward may not have fully justified the hype 
that had surrounded his arrival from Celtic in 1983, but on that glorious sunny 
April day in 1987 he was Arsenal’s hero.

Minute-by-minute: GOAL! Liverpool 1-2 Arsenal (Nicholas 83)
Perry Groves may not be the greatest player to have ever worn an Arsenal 
shirt, but he has just played a massive part in possibly ending the club’s 
eight year trophy drought. After receiving a pass down the left from Kenny 
Sansom, Groves skins Gary Gillespie before cutting the ball back to Charlie 
Nicholas. In all honesty, Nicholas’ side footed effort is pretty tame, but a 
deflection off of Ronnie Whelan sends the ball past the wrong footed 
Grobbelaar, and George Graham punches the air in delight. I think I may have 
also spotted Bob Wilson celebrating to the side of the goal as the ball hit the 
net. So much for BBC impartiality, although we can probably forgive him in the 
circumstances.

What they said: “Arsenal manager George Graham will have to come up with a 
king’s ransom to make Bonnie Prince Charlie stay at Highbury after his 
startling two-goal winning performance”. The Daily Mirror’s Harry Harris 
discusses Charlie Nicholas’ ongoing contract negotiations with the club, 
hinting that Arsenal’s match winner may well be on his way to Liverpool. 
Nicholas’ days were numbered though, and next January he was sold to Aberdeen.

Facts: This was the first final to be sponsored by Littlewoods. For the first 
time Liverpool lost when Ian Rush scored, a run that had lasted 144 matches 
before Arsenal’s victory (Norwich would repeat the feat a week later).

No1: Let It Be, Ferry Aid


1988: Luton Town 3-2 Arsenal 

In a tweet: Luton shock the holders as Arsenal are left to rue missed chances. 
Dibble saves from the spot, Caesar is toppled, Stein nets last min winner

Key man: Gus Caesar. Maybe unfairly blamed for Arsenal’s defeat - Martin Hayes 
missing from a yard and Nigel Winterburn failing from the spot could also 
shoulder some responsibility - the Arsenal defender will be forever remembered 
for his Littlewoods Cup final display. Described by Nick Hornby in Fever Pitch 
as “looking like somebody off the street who has won a competition to appear as 
a centre-half in a Wembley final,” I still believe to this day that he was 
fouled in the lead-up to Danny Wilson’s equaliser.

Minute-by-minute: 79 mins PENALTY MISSED! 
 Andy Dibble has kept Luton’s hopes alive, saving a penalty from Nigel 
Winterburn - a strange choice surely for a spot kick - and preventing another 
Simod Cup type disaster. The penalty was not particularly well struck, and 
someone as left footed as Winterburn always looked likely to put it to the 
keeper’s left, but Dibble predicted/guessed correctly, and the man who wasn’t 
even sure of his Cup final place until yesterday has at least maintained the 
suspense for a little longer.

What they said: “Luton Town, the little club that plays on a wall-to-wall 
carpet and refuses to accommodate visiting supporters, yesterday won the 
Littlewoods Cup in a match as unpredictably dramatic as the FA Cup Final of 
1979”. The Times’ Stuart Jones highlights the frenetic ending to the match.


Fact: Luton won their first major honour in their 102-year history, a month 
after losing the Simod Cup final 4-1 to Reading.


No1: Theme From S’Express - S’Express


1989: Nottingham Forest 3-1 Luton Town

In a tweet: Clough’s nine-year wait for a major trophy ends after Forest’s 
second half comeback loosens Luton’s grip on the Littlewoods Cup.

Key man: Nigel Clough. Scorer of two goals, Clough was voted man of the match, 
although Neil Webb was probably not far behind. Webb’s display was one of many 
impressive performances during the season, and in the summer he was on his way 
to Manchester United for £1.5 million.

Minute-by-minute: GOAL! Nottingham Forest 1-1 Luton (Clough pen 55)
 Les Sealey has just made an error of judgement that could have changed the 
course of this final. Neil Webb played a sublime through ball to Steve Hodge, 
but the England midfielder was being tracked by Steve Foster. Sealey decided to 
charge off his line, however, and clearly fouled Hodge as the ball was knocked 
past him. Nigel Clough calmly steps up and rolls the ball into the same corner 
of the same goal that Nigel Winterburn put his penalty last year. Where is Andy 
Dibble when you need him?

What they said: “Nigel Clough yesterday served his famous father with the only 
thing that could compensate for missing his favourite Sunday roast - the 
Littlewoods Cup”. The Daily Express’ Steve Curry is one of many journalists to 
reference the father-son relationship between the manager and two-goal hero.


Fact: Luton’s defeat was their first loss in the League Cup since October 
1985. They were excluded from the 1986-87 competition due to their ban on away 
fans attending Kenilworth Road, and won the cup the following season.
