Yes, can’t see anyone getting too wound up about that. The second half was 
rather more sprightly than the first, although it was still hardly a classic. 
Sturridge should have diverted a Milner cross home forLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> and Ji clipped the post for 
Augsburg late on. Both sides will be able to convince themselves that they can 
do something in the second leg, and that at least tees it up nicely. Bertolt 
Brecht rather unexpectedly carried us through that during its slower moments 
although I suspect he’d be turning in his grave at the outcome. Thanks for all 
your excellent emails and tweets, and for reading. See you again!

87 min: Ji hits the post! My goodness. Caiuby hangs in the air to nod down a 
right-sided cross and Ji, poised 10 yards out and under pressure from Toure, 
lashes a low volley that snicks off the base of the frame and out of play! So 
close for the home side.

86 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> win their 
sixth corner but Henderson can’t get it beyond the near post. Ibe retrieves the 
ball and dances into a shooting position, but it’s no trouble for Hitz.

85 min: All of a sudden, Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> find themselves with men over 
on the counter and if Caiuby can get his head up Esswein is storming clear up 
the right flank. He can’t, and although Esswein eventually gets the ball the 
chance is fading and it is snuffed out totally when Esswein passes to an 
offside Verhaegh.

76 min: Well, now the home side have their best chance of the half! Stafylidis 
gets onto a deep cross from the right with Milner sleeping, and tries to guide 
the ball into the far corner. It’s off target but Caiuby *almost* gets the 
touch that would divert it into the vacant goal!

73 min: And close again for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> – excellent cross from the 
right by Milner, perhaps the delivery of the night, towards Origi. It screams 
“gobble me up!” but a defender gets there just in time, knocks the ball against 
the substitute and over. Werner gets booked for fouling Coutinho in the buildup.

72 min: That was even more threatening from Moreno at the other end. He hits a 
swerving 30-yarder that bounces wickedly up off the turf and Hitz, readjusting 
quickly, does well to paw it past his post. Milner takes another early corner, 
lofted to Henderson, but not for the first time it doesn’t pay off – Henderson 
loops his shot well off target.

68 min: Augsburg have just steadied things a touch after that spell of 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> pressure and chances 
earlier, and Toure gets across well to prevent Caiuby getting away. Meanwhile, 
Sturridge comes off and Divock Origi is on. Still no Benteke.

65 min: Liverpool win a corner, through the much more involved Clyne. Milner 
works it neatly, tightly, with Henderson but can’t put his left foot shot 
through a crowd of players. Altintop gets away briefly for the home side on the 
counter, but his legs can’t take him clear and the chance goes.

63 min: “Will we get a draw?” ponders Richard McGahey. “Well, as Brecht said, 
‘Because things are the way they are, things will not stay the way they are’. 
So I guess Brecht thinks someone will score.”

You’d certainly like to think that all this has some end product.

62 min: Athletic Bilbao veteran Aritz Aduriz has just scored an absolute 
stunner against Marseille – make sure you see it. Think Shearer versus Everton, 
but even further out.

60 min: Kohr rather professionally fouls Firmino, who had weaved away through 
the middle. Booking, no complaints.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> might sense a breakthrough on 
this evidence ... and they almost get it when, from the free kick, Caiuby’s 
clearance hits his team-mate Verhaegh, and nearly trickles across the line. 
Hitz is relieved to get back and gather.

55 min: Ohhhhh, Sturridge should score. Firmino delays a pass perfectly for 
the overlapping Milner, and he fizzes the ball at speed into the unmarked 
striker at the edge of the six-yard box. He tries to touch it into the far 
corner but can’t get a good enough contact and the ball drifts well wide, when 
anything more solid would break the deadlock. At the other end Feulner isn’t 
too far off with a 25-yarder, and then Sturridge puts a long-ranger of his own 
straight at Hitz. Is this warming up a bit now?

@NickAmes82 <https://twitter.com/NickAmes82> Halfway through the match and not 
a single Fuggerstädter joke? Can't decide if I'm impressed or disappointed.

It was a choice between the high road and the low road, Luke. There’s plenty 
of time yet to revert to type.

53 min: Better from Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>
. Coutinho cleverly leaves a Firmino pass, allowing Moreno clear space on the 
left of the area. He cuts back to Coutinho, who has run into the area, but the 
Brazilian jabs well wide of the near post. Their best move of the game, I think.

one was harsh on Henderson but his shot was poor anyway.

From Steve Coombs:

“Marie Meyer’s song goes on:

‘Just a Benteke has Jürgen Klopp, dear, But he keeps him out of sight’

This could run and run this evening!”

Never know what you’re going to be confronted by next in this job.

Half-time: Augsburg 0-0 Liverpool

Not a thriller, but a couple of sights of goal apiece and that last one for 
Esswein was certainly the clearest. Need to see more fromLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> going forwards here: Augsburg 
were forced to replace their talismanic striker, Bobadilla, early on but 
they’ve been slightly the brighter since. Don’t go away.

45+1 min: Best chance of the half for Esswein! That could well, maybe should, 
have been 1-0. He gets away down the right, cuts inside onto his left foot and 
has a clear sight of goal – but Mignolet does really well to anticipate, get 
down and gather the ball as he whips it towards the far corner.

45 min: The half is pretty much winding down now ... until the home left-back 
Stafylidis, probably their best attacking threat so far, profits from a mistake 
by Milner and puts in a good low delivery from the left, cleared again by 
Sakho. Without Bobadilla,Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> don’t really have a focal point 
for those balls.

left but Esswein, the right midfielder, is back superbly to get to the line and 
see the ball out for a goal kick.

Yes, can’t see anyone getting too wound up about that. The second half was 
rather more sprightly than the first, although it was still hardly a classic. 
Sturridge should have diverted a Milner cross home forLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> and Ji clipped the post for 
Augsburg late on. Both sides will be able to convince themselves that they can 
do something in the second leg, and that at least tees it up nicely. Bertolt 
Brecht rather unexpectedly carried us through that during its slower moments 
although I suspect he’d be turning in his grave at the outcome. Thanks for all 
your excellent emails and tweets, and for reading. See you again!
 
Fair’s fair.

90+2 min: The impressive – going forwards, anyway – Stafylidis fizzes another 
cross in but nobody is in the box to attack it. Feulner fouls Can to stop
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> breaking, and is 
yellow carded.
 
90+1 min: “I just heard John Aldridge say on the LFC in-house commentary that 
neither team really deserves to win the game,” reveals Peter Oh. “Brecht versus 
Aldridge.”

We have two added minutes to play.
 
90 min: Coutinho cracks a shot in but, like several before it, it’s deflected 
off target. Little comes from the corner.
 
89 min: “I’ve had “Scarlet billows start to spread!” teed up for an age now 
but it is looking like I’m not going to get a chance to use it.” You started 
this, Marie Meyer, so I’ll give you the honour of finishing it.
 
88 min: Another change for Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg>, Koo Ja-cheol on for Altintop.
 
87 min: Ji hits the post! My goodness. Caiuby hangs in the air to nod down a 
right-sided cross and Ji, poised 10 yards out and under pressure from Toure, 
lashes a low volley that snicks off the base of the frame and out of play! So 
close for the home side.

Hangst/Bongarts/Getty Images  
86 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> win their 
sixth corner but Henderson can’t get it beyond the near post. Ibe retrieves the 
ball and dances into a shooting position, but it’s no trouble for Hitz.
 
85 min: All of a sudden, Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> find themselves with men over 
on the counter and if Caiuby can get his head up Esswein is storming clear up 
the right flank. He can’t, and although Esswein eventually gets the ball the 
chance is fading and it is snuffed out totally when Esswein passes to an 
offside Verhaegh.
 
83 min: Martin Fergus has a go at Brecht now, and again it’s not bad – “Steven 
Caulker, Lucas Leiva, what about Jordan Ibe? They’re all sitting down. Oh, the 
line forms on the bench, Babe, now that Klopp is back in town!”
 
82 min: Kohr is down with cramp, but should be ok. Can someone grab a crucial 
late goal here?
 
81 min: A change for the hosts. Sunderland stalwart Ji comes on for Werner – 
not William Hague. And Jordan Ibe replaces Milner forLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>.
 
78 min: After the set piece is cleared, Kohr strikes a speculative shot at 
Mignolet. The home side are still very much here.
 
77 min: Yellow card for Moreno after he fouls Feulner, who has played well.
 
76 min: Well, now the home side have their best chance of the half! Stafylidis 
gets onto a deep cross from the right with Milner sleeping, and tries to guide 
the ball into the far corner. It’s off target but Caiuby *almost* gets the 
touch that would divert it into the vacant goal!
 
75 min: “A Fuggerstaedter joke? Fugger daboudit, frankly,” says Robin 
Hazlehurst. Could be a slow last 15...
 
73 min: And close again for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> – excellent cross from the 
right by Milner, perhaps the delivery of the night, towards Origi. It screams 
“gobble me up!” but a defender gets there just in time, knocks the ball against 
the substitute and over. Werner gets booked for fouling Coutinho in the buildup.

Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty Images  
72 min: That was even more threatening from Moreno at the other end. He hits a 
swerving 30-yarder that bounces wickedly up off the turf and Hitz, readjusting 
quickly, does well to paw it past his post. Milner takes another early corner, 
lofted to Henderson, but not for the first time it doesn’t pay off – Henderson 
loops his shot well off target.
 
69 min: Werner crosses tantalisingly to the far post and Moreno, bearings all 
wrong, manages to head the ball back towards his own goal. Luckily no white 
shirt is there to snaffle up the gift.
 
68 min: Augsburg have just steadied things a touch after that spell of 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> pressure and chances 
earlier, and Toure gets across well to prevent Caiuby getting away. Meanwhile, 
Sturridge comes off and Divock Origi is on. Still no Benteke.
 
65 min: Liverpool win a corner, through the much more involved Clyne. Milner 
works it neatly, tightly, with Henderson but can’t put his left foot shot 
through a crowd of players. Altintop gets away briefly for the home side on the 
counter, but his legs can’t take him clear and the chance goes.
 
63 min: “Will we get a draw?” ponders Richard McGahey. “Well, as Brecht said, 
‘Because things are the way they are, things will not stay the way they are’. 
So I guess Brecht thinks someone will score.”

You’d certainly like to think that all this has some end product.
 
62 min: Athletic Bilbao veteran Aritz Aduriz has just scored an absolute 
stunner against Marseille – make sure you see it. Think Shearer versus Everton, 
but even further out.
 
60 min: Kohr rather professionally fouls Firmino, who had weaved away through 
the middle. Booking, no complaints.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> might sense a breakthrough on 
this evidence ... and they almost get it when, from the free kick, Caiuby’s 
clearance hits his team-mate Verhaegh, and nearly trickles across the line. 
Hitz is relieved to get back and gather.
 
58 min: Now Clyne’s turn to open Augsburg up down the right and win a corner. 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have sharpened up 
their act here. Can heads the flag kick well over.
 
55 min: Ohhhhh, Sturridge should score. Firmino delays a pass perfectly for 
the overlapping Milner, and he fizzes the ball at speed into the unmarked 
striker at the edge of the six-yard box. He tries to touch it into the far 
corner but can’t get a good enough contact and the ball drifts well wide, when 
anything more solid would break the deadlock. At the other end Feulner isn’t 
too far off with a 25-yarder, and then Sturridge puts a long-ranger of his own 
straight at Hitz. Is this warming up a bit now?

It was a choice between the high road and the low road, Luke. There’s plenty 
of time yet to revert to type.
 
53 min: Better from Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>
. Coutinho cleverly leaves a Firmino pass, allowing Moreno clear space on the 
left of the area. He cuts back to Coutinho, who has run into the area, but the 
Brazilian jabs well wide of the near post. Their best move of the game, I think.
 
51 min: There really isn’t a lot happening in the game. Couple of offsides; 
one was harsh on Henderson but his shot was poor anyway.
 
49 min: “My Dad taught me that Brecht was into Verfremsdungsaffect, which kind 
of translates intodistancing effect,” explains childhood prodigy Howard Appleby.
 “Maybe more appropriate for Van Gaal and Manchester United. What does Klopp 
have to say?”
 
48 min: Richard Noble says he’s enjoying ‘Klopp the Knife’ and continues – 
“That was venerably witty. But if we’re talking about things biting... Well, I 
was wondering if there was any more in theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> rumour mill about a Barcelona 
striker rejoining the team adding some bite (metaphorical and physical) to 
their attack.”
 
47 min: A goalless draw would probably suit Augsburg quite well, I reckon, not 
that they shouldn’t think they can score here. Get a few players back for the 
second leg, sneak an away goal against a nervyLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> at Anfield, who knows?
 
Second half underway. I’d have thought Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>, attack-wise at least, can 
only improve.
 
From Steve Coombs:

“Marie Meyer’s song goes on:

‘Just a Benteke has Jürgen Klopp, dear, But he keeps him out of sight’

This could run and run this evening!”

Never know what you’re going to be confronted by next in this job.
 Tim Woods (@tim_hannover) 
@NickAmes82 <https://twitter.com/NickAmes82> is that William Hague on the left 
wing for Augsburg?

 <https://twitter.com/tim_hannover/status/700422630638252032> 
On the left wing? Certainly not.
 
Not a thriller, but a couple of sights of goal apiece and that last one for 
Esswein was certainly the clearest. Need to see more fromLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> going forwards here: Augsburg 
were forced to replace their talismanic striker, Bobadilla, early on but 
they’ve been slightly the brighter since. Don’t go away.
 
45+1 min: Best chance of the half for Esswein! That could well, maybe should, 
have been 1-0. He gets away down the right, cuts inside onto his left foot and 
has a clear sight of goal – but Mignolet does really well to anticipate, get 
down and gather the ball as he whips it towards the far corner.

Schrader/AP  
45 min: The half is pretty much winding down now ... until the home left-back 
Stafylidis, probably their best attacking threat so far, profits from a mistake 
by Milner and puts in a good low delivery from the left, cleared again by 
Sakho. Without Bobadilla,Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> don’t really have a focal point 
for those balls.
 
42 min: Who said this wasn’t a cultured MBM. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> almost have a wound inflicted 
themselves as a long shot flashes wide, and at the other end Sturridge can’t 
get onto a right-sided cross.
 
41 min: “You cannot mention Brecht without consequences,” Marie Mayer warns, 
before continuing –

“Oh the Klopp, has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white. Just one 
away goal is what he wants here.But his attack is lacking bite”
 
39 min: Feulner takes the corner but Sakho defends it well by the near post.
 
39 min: Dangerous free-kick to Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> just beyond the right corner of 
the area. Werner, left-footed, is poised. Can is causing some aggro in the 
area. Now it’s whipped in and, after a white shirt gets a flick on, it’s headed 
out to Stafylidis, whose volley cannons wide off Firmino...
 
37 min: Elsewhere, it’s Gary Neville’s Valencia 5-0 Rapid Vienna after 35 
minutes....

Photograph: Kai Foersterling/EPA  
36 min: Played straight out to Henderson on the edge of the area. He tries to 
weigh one up and beyond Hitz but it has neither direction nor power and the 
‘keeper claims.
 
35 min: But now Sturridge runs forwards and, ignoring the option of Henderson 
– who is frustrated with that – has a shot deflected wide. Corner, on the 
left...
 
34 min: Coutinho, on song so far, plays a lovely no-look flick to Can, albeit 
in a pretty unthreatening area, and the midfielder can’t make too much of it. 
No exactly seat-of-the-pants stuff here yet.
 
32 min: Some decent possession for Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg>, now, and it ends up with the 
ball being worked well to Feulner on the right byline. Sakho clears his low 
cross.

30 min: Nice work by Stafylidis down the Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> left but his lofted cross to 
the back post is controlled by the arm of Caiuby.
 
29 min: Moreno plays a nice give-and-go with Coutinho and bustles down the 
left but Esswein, the right midfielder, is back superbly to get to the line and 
see the ball out for a goal kick.
 
27 min: Maybe the loss of Bobadilla will provoke a siege mentality among his 
peers. They’ve had a couple of bright moments in the last few minutes but it’s 
hard to really see where any incision would come from.
