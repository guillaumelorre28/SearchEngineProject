The UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> event to be held in Melbourne 
later this month has suffered a huge blow with American fighter Luke Rockhold 
withdrawing from the headline bout.

Rockhold was due to fight Brazilian Ronaldo Sousa at UFC Fight Night 101 at 
Rod Laver Arena on 27 November. UFC officials are scrambling to find a 
replacement after it emerged on Wednesday that Rockhold had suffered a knee 
injury and will not take part.

“Right now there is nothing I want more than to get back into the cage and do 
what I love most ... unfortunately, due to an injury to my left knee I had to 
withdraw from the fight,” Rockhold posted on his official Facebook page.

“I apologise to the UFC and [Sousa] and most importantly to the fans. I will 
be back better than ever in pursuit of the belt.”

The middleweight fight was a rematch of the 2011 meeting between the pair that 
went to Rockhold by unanimous decision. The winner of the bout was expected to 
be in contention for a shot at the middleweight title held by British fighter 
Michael Bisping.

A UFC official said it was unclear if a replacement fighter would step in to 
face Sousa or whether a new feature fight would be organised with the 
Rockhold-Sousa match rescheduled.

The Sousa camp are reportedly angling for a title bout against Bisping in 
Melbourne, a possibility that wasn’t ruled out by officials.
