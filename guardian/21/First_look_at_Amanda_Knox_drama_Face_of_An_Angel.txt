The first footage from Michael Winterbottom's film Face of An Angel, a drama 
inspired by the Amanda Knox case, has been premieredon Variety's website 
<http://variety.com/2014/film/news/amanda-knox-face-of-an-angel-kate-beckinsale-1201084722/>
.

The film is a fictional tale heavily based on the case in Italy, in which 
Amanda Knox <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amanda-knox> and her boyfriend 
Raffaele Sollecito were accused of sexually assaulting and murdering British 
student Meredith Kercher – Knox was convicted and served four years of her jail 
term, acquitted, and again found guilty in a retrial last week.

The book Angel Face: Sex, Murder and the Inside Story of Amanda Knox by the 
American journalist Barbie Latza Nadeau was a key inspiration for the film. It 
stars Daniel Brühl as a film-maker who travels to Italy to research a film 
adaptation of the book with its author, played byKate Beckinsale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/kate-beckinsale>. He becomes embroiled in the 
sensational case, and strikes up a relationship with a British student, played 
by model Cara Delevingne.

The film, co-produced by BBC Films, is still in post-production, but will soon 
be shopped around the European Film Market in Berlin which begins later this 
week. The prolific Winterbottom is also set to release his sequel to Steve 
Coogan and Rob Brydon's gastronomic tour The Trip, whichpremiered at Sundance
