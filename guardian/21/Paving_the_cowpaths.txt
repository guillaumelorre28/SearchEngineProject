Websites are full of compromises. They provide a general view that caters for 
the majority. However, we know you don’t always want what the majority wants.

Your interests are different from your neighbour’s, and probably different 
from your partner’s, friends’ or family’s. We also know that if we update the 
navigation on our site, then finding your regular topics again can be 
frustrating as you learn where everything is – particularly for those of you 
changing from our old site to the new one.

We want to embrace different tastes, so we’ve introduced “recently visited” 
links under ‘all sections’ that help you find the topics you’ve visited in the 
past. If you’re not already using the beta, you can see this byswitching to our 
beta site

Here are my own recently visited links:

 Recently visited links on theguardian.com 
Yours probably look a lot different, but that’s ok!


How does this work?

As you read articles and navigate to different topics across the Guardian 
site, we ask your browser to keeps a record of the sections you visit.

We display up to 10 of these topics back to you, as shortcuts to return to 
easily.


I’ve never visited that stuff!

Do you share a computer with someone else? If so, you might get mixed results. 
We will explore ways in which we can link this to your signed-in account in the 
future. You can remove the links you don’t like by clicking the ‘x’ on each one.

I don’t like them. Can I switch them off?

You can. Just click on the ‘edit’ button or visit the preferences 
<https://www.theguardian.com/preferences> page. Delete them individually or 
switch the feature off entirely.

Please tell us why you don’t like them as well; leave a comment below. Are 
they showing the wrong content, or are they just not useful? Drop a note to
userhelp@theguardian.com <mailto:userhelp@theguardian.com> with any issues.


I love them. How can I let you know?

Feel free to comment below or drop me a tweet!

What about my privacy?

We respect your privacy and your shortcuts will never be made public. You can 
easily remove individual items or turn the functionality off completely. If you 
clear your browser cookies and storage, then these will automatically 
disappear. Read more about ourcookie policy here

What’s this about cowpaths?

‘Paving the cowpaths’ is a term initially used to describe making common paths 
easier to travel along. Folklore suggests it comes from the urban planning, or 
apparent lack thereof, inBoston 
<http://www.celebrateboston.com/strange/cow-paths.htm>. It suggests the 
scrambled road system through the city was implemented by simply paving the 
most common routes.

Whether that’s true or not, it’s a term that’s used commonly in describing a 
good user experience practice. This can also be described as a ‘desire path 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path>’ or ‘desire line 
<http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/desire-lines-the-metaphor-that-keeps-on-giving/>
’.


When we’re designing for our users we want to provide paths that are natural 
to each individual visitor and we don’t want you to have to re-learn the site 
if it changes. If you have already navigated to a particular subject area, we 
want you to be able to find it again easily.


Our navigation reflects the subjects we think are important, but we also know 
that everyone has their own preferences. We try to cater for both.
