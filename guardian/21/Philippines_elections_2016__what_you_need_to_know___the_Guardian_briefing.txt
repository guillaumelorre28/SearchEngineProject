What’s happening?

The Philippines <https://www.theguardian.com/world/philippines> is holding 
elections for almost all branches of government. The most powerful posts of 
president and vice-president will be voted for, with the winners serving one 
six-year term. Also up for grabs are 12 seats, or half of the senate; all 
governor posts, all mayors, and all city and municipal councils.

When is voting day?

Monday 9 May. Walls and roadsides across the country of 101 million people 
have been covered in campaign posters.

When will we know the results?

During the 2010 presidential election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/may/10/philippines-elections-gallery>
 on 10 May, unofficial tallies showedBenigno Aquino III 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/30/benigno-aquino-philippines-president1>
 was the leading candidate in the days following voting. But it was not until 
nearly a month later, on 9 June, that congress declared him as the 
president-elect.

How did he do in power?

Aquino has been credited for bringing political stability and economic 
prosperity as foreign investment rises. He has also drawn up the framework of a 
peace deal in the south and made inroads into fighting graft. But the southern 
province of Mindanao still needs rebuilding, corruption is rampant in politics, 
and Islamist militants remain able to operate.

Who will win this time?

The current front-runner is Rodrigo Duterte, also known as “the Punisher”. In 
a profanity-laced campaign, he has promised to kill criminals in the streets,
joked about raping a missionary

What is his background?

The 71-year-old motorbike fanatic was mayor of the southern city of Davao for 
two decades, where he drastically reduced crime. However, human rights groups
accuse 
<https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/07/17/rodrigo-duterte-rise-philippines-death-squad-mayor>
 him of allowing vigilante death squads to carry out hundreds of extrajudicial 
killings.

The political establishment is in shock but Duterte is way ahead in many 
polls, having promised to end drug crime in three to six months andpardon  
<http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/122044-duterte-pardon-cops-kill-criminals>
security forces who kill criminals. Speaking last month, the man known as 
Duterte Harry said his presidency “will be a bloody one”.

Duterte is popular because many see him as an outsider who can end years of 
the same types of politicians, and also use quick fixes to deal with the 
south-east Asian nation’s problems.

Many have compared his demagogic rise to that of Donald Trump, although Duterte
says <http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/776353/duterte-trump-is-a-bigot-i-am-not> 
Trump is a bigot. Duterte is also openlysupportive 
<http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/13/1476508/duterte-declares-support-gay-marriage-lgbt-rights>
 of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights, a sensitive topic in 
a mainly Catholic country.

Joshua Kurlantzick, a fellow for south-east Asia at the Council on Foreign 
Relations,describes 
<http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/2016/03/30/how-will-the-philippines-presidential-election-transform-the-country/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AsiaUnbound%2FJKurlantzick+%28Asia+Unbound+%C2%BB+Joshua+Kurlantzick%29>
 him as “the ultimate wildcard”.

Who are the other candidates?

It’s a five-way race and Senator Grace Poe comes second in the opinion 
surveys. An economic liberal who would have the country join the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership, 47-year-old Poe also plans to liberalise foreign investment laws.

She is the daughter of a famous Filipino action hero, Fernando Poe Jr, who 
failed to enter high office, and was the favourite for months before Duterte 
took the lead in April.

Poe has a fairly clean image, and has not been dragged into the corruption 
scandals that are widespread in Philippine politics. Despite being a former US 
citizen – she had to drop citizenship to run – Poe has distanced herself from 
Washington, but that might be seen as a political move after her foes painted 
her as a US stooge.

Behind Poe is current vice-president Jejomar Binay. The 73-year-old has not 
received Aquino’s blessing and Binay has promised to work more closely with 
China, a shift away from his boss.


What's the mood in the Philippines in the run up to the elections?

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/whats-the-mood-in-the-philippines-in-the-run-up-to-the-elections>
Binay comes from a political family that has run Manila’s financial district, 
Makati, for decades. He has, however, focused on policies for the poor, 
including free medical care and education.

Aquino’s own choice for his successor, Mar Roxas, is seen as bringing a 
continuation of the outgoing premier’s policies, especially bolstering Manila’s 
links with Washington and other regional powers such as Japan againstChina’s 
territorial assertiveness in the South China Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/23/south-china-sea-dispute-hague-competing-claims>
 (called the West Philippine Sea in the Philippines).

Last in the polls is Miriam Defensor Santiago,who has run three times for the 
presidency. She says she wants to end her career in politics as the president 
“unless I get struck by another bout of cancer, but it doesn’t happen that 
often” – referring to her stage four lung cancer.

Any others to watch?

The Philippines was the first democracy in south-east Asia but there are good 
odds on the late dictator’s son,Ferdinand Marcos Jr, taking the 
vice-presidency. The voting system allows for this as the president and 
vice-president are voted for separately, so they are unlikely to come from the 
same party.

Known as “Bongbong”, Marcos’ run at the highest elective post any family 
member has tried for since his father died, and his anti-establishment 
platform, have been incredibly successful as many Filipinos are disillusioned 
with the slow pace of change.

The imposition of martial law, torture and billions of dollars of plundered 
wealth during his father’s two decades in power has so far not greatly tainted 
his campaign.

Also on the ballot is boxing legend Manny Pacquiao, who is running for the 
senate in Binay’s team. He’s a hero in the country – street kid to superstar to 
political contender – and polls suggest he is almost guaranteed to win a seat.

Having already served two terms as a congressmen, the evangelical Christian 
damaged his reputation abroad whenhe said gay people were “worse than animals” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/16/manny-pacquiao-gay-people-worse-than-animals>
. Nikecancelled his sponsorship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/17/manny-pacquiao-gay-comments-nike-boxing>
 immediately. In the Philippines, his popularity briefly dropped but has since 
recovered.
