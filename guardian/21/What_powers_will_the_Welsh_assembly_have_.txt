How much will the new assembly be able to do? 
It can implement laws that affect: 

 agriculture, fisheries, forestry, water and flood defences;
  economic development;
  schools, colleges and training;
  the environment;
  community development;
  food;
  health;
  housing;
  local government;
  sport and leisure;
  some transport policy, such as Welsh roads;
  arts, culture and the Welsh language. 

The assembly can also set performance targets and establish new standards in, 
for example, the NHS inWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>. But unlike 
the Scottish parliament, it cannot make laws and it has no tax-raising powers.

It can also "do anything it considers appropriate" to support certain aspects 
of Welsh culture - museums, libraries, recreation and the Welsh language. 
Members of the assembly will also be able to make speeches in Welsh.

What happens if the UK parliament wants to make a law in one of the policy 
areas implemented by the Welsh assembly? 

The Secretary of State for Wales has a duty to consult the Welsh assembly on 
these issues, and Westminster will usually invite the assembly to "make 
representations" about the issue. However, final authority remains with the UK 
parliament.

Which policy areas will still be completely controlled by Westminster? 

 "Reserved matters". These are: 

  the constitution;
  defence;
  foreign affairs;
  electricity, coal, oil and gas;
  nuclear energy;
  employment;
  financial and economic matters;
  social security. 

Who decides whether the Welsh assembly is entitled to implement an issue or 
make a representation about it? 

Westminster decides, but the assembly itself has to approve the decision. Once 
Whitehall has decided that a matter is relevant to Wales, the Secretary of 
State for Wales issues a "concordat" defining what the assembly can discuss. 
The assembly is entitled to dispute the concordat, for example if it considers 
it should be allowed to make representation about a wider range of issues. Once 
it has approved the concordat, the assembly can go on to debate the issue in 
Wales.

Would Westminster ever be able to intervene to stop a Welsh assembly decision? 

Yes - if that decision 

 would conflict with an "international obligation" of the UK;
  would affect rivers and water courses that flow into England.
