Storms during the winter of 2013-14 generated the maximum recorded sea level 
at 20 of the 40 tide gauge sites around the UK, as well as the largest number 
of extreme sea level events in any season in the last 100 years.

This is one of the findings of scientists from Southampton University 
<http://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2016/11/moderate-storms.page> who have been 
studying coastal flooding around Britain to try to understand the increasing 
threat from storm surges in various parts of the coast.

There are several factors involved in who will get flooded and when. The track 
of the depressions, the direction of the wind and the state of the tide dictate 
which places are vulnerable at any one time.

From food supplies to coastal defences, the UK is ill-prepared

To help people predict when coastal communities might be at risk the 
scientists have developed a historical record of coastal flooding called
Surgewatch <https://www.surgewatch.org/>, which gives a report of each event 
since 1915 and its severity. Those with memories of recent storms or extra 
information are asked to contribute.

But a disturbing finding is that none of these serious flood events occurred 
during severe storms but those classed as moderate. This was because none of 
the severe storms coincided with a high spring tide so were not enough on their 
own to overtop the sea defences. In other words, so far the UK has been lucky.

The conclusion must be that with sea levels rising at around 3mm a year and 
storms getting more frequent and violent, it is only a matter of time before a
major storm and a spring tide coincide 
<http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/springtide.html>, and bring widespread 
destruction to somewhere along Britainâ€™s coastline.
