Among her many journalistic exploits, Clare Hollingworth (Obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/10/clare-hollingworth-obituary>, 11 
January) should be credited with a notable feminist victory over the Ministry 
of Defence. I was among a group of correspondents invited for a trip on HMS 
Dreadnought, Britain’s first nuclear submarine, soon after it was commissioned 
in 1963. An invitation to Clare, who was also newly launched as a defence 
correspondent, ran into trouble when Dreadnought crew insisted that women were 
never allowed aboard submarines because they brought bad luck.

As I recall, the issue was discussed at a senior admiralty level before Clare 
was allowed to join us. Her only concession was to wear trousers when she 
climbed aboard.
