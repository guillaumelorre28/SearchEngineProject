Wilshere, not selected for Sam Allardyce’s first England squad, was named in 
Bournemouth’s starting XI for Warren Cummings’ testimonial at Dean Court.

saved byMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> goalkeeper Gabriel 
Ferreira.

half, including replacing Wilshere. Milan went ahead on 64 minutes through
