Readers have been sharing a wonderful array of wildlife photographs every 
month throughout the year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/wildlife-on-your-doorstep>. And 
with 2016 drawing to a close, we thought it would be nice to document the very 
best of them from all four seasons. Here’s to more fantastic, up close and 
personal wildlife photography next year.

I took this blue tit photo at a nature reserve called Oxford Island on the 
shores of Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland, using a Nikon D610 with a 70-300 
zoom lens. It’s just a few miles from where I live and I go there several times 
a year to take photographs mostly of the birds. The birds are quite friendly in 
this nature reserve. If you put out bird seed for them they will come fairly 
close.Debbie Deboo

This picture was taken in a little forest area around Vlaardingen, the 
Netherlands where I live. I used my digital Nikon D5000 with a zoom. It’s not 
common to see deer in that area, but I was not totally surprised either as they 
have appeared more often lately in that area. The Hoge Veluwe National Park is 
not far away either.Lisa Smit

A jay comes in to land 
Photograph: Di Carey/GuardianWitness  
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/56a8ab82e4b03715edefaaf4/1931686> 
This jay came in to land at Cromwell Bottom, a local nature reserve in the 
Calder Valley between Brighouse and Elland, West Yorkshire. The site used to be 
a
quarry, a tip for ash from the old Elland power station, and a land
fill site. Now it’s a mix of woodland, wetlands and grasslands. I feel very 
lucky to live in this post-industrial area where there is so much access to 
wildlife.

I go to Cromwell Bottom for the bird life, which is plentiful, but I’m
always pleased to get a clear image of a jay. They are very shy birds, and 
tend to hang back in the woodland whilst smaller, bolder birds feast on the 
food which has been put out for them. I used a Canon 100D with a 55-250 lens: 
250mm,ƒ/6.3,1/2000,ISO 800. Despite always taking a tripod, I tend not to use 
it, as it can affect the spontaneity of a wildlife shot. It was an added bonus 
that this particular image looked comical.Di Carey

Mountain hare - High Peaks, Derbyshire, February

My 78-year-old dad and I are both keen wildlife photographers and I try to 
organise a trip each month for us to go exploring. In February we went to the 
Peak District to see if we could spot any mountain hares. We’d researched where 
the hares can be seen in advance, but there obviously still a lot of luck 
involved too. The hope was that would still be in their “winter whites” but 
with the snow having melted they would be easier to see on the hillsides. 
Derbyshire has the only mainland population of these hares, though they are 
locally common in the Cairngorms, Scotland.

To get this close to a mountain hare takes a fair amount of climbing and a 
little bit of fieldcraft but the result was worth it for sure. I ruined my 
jeans from crawling on my belly to get the shot, but that’s the only way you 
can close to them. I was testing a Panasonic FZ330 on this particular day which 
proved to be ideal.Robin Bennett

Nothing sums up the cold Kentucky winter of 2016 than a cardinal braving a 
snow shower in my yard in Utica. I captured this one with a Nikon D3200 camera 
and a 55-200 mm lens. The Northern Cardinal is very common in this region of 
North America. I’ve always thought they’re very photogenic, particularly with a 
wintry backdrop. I enjoyed photographing the birds in my yard during the cold 
winter months.Holly Schwartz

I was driving home to Dunfermline after a sunrise climb of Ben A’an, when I 
saw some highland cows in a field by the side of the road next to Loch Venachar 
in the Trossachs areas of Scotland. As I’d been climbing that morning, I 
luckily had my camera gear in the car. This was taken with my Fuji X-E2 
mirrorless camera. Highland Cows are not massively common in Scotland, but as 
you travel further to the north and west you tend to find more.Darren Brogan

I live in Jersey so I was taking a short break in the forest. I was 
deliberately looking for the boars, but was surprised to find them. They are

I spotted a family of geese sitting by the small local pond near the canal in 
Voorschoten, Netherlands. I’d gone looking for them deliberately, as I live 
close by and have seen geese and their goslings many times in the past. There’s 
no better early sign of spring than goslings. I captured this one with a 
compact Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ30 I always carry with me when I go outdoors, so 
that I won’t miss anything unexpected and beautiful.Gerrie Stegehuis

This shot was taken with a Canon EOS 70D at Morton Lochs near Tentsmuir Forest 
in Fife, not far from my home. I visit the nature reserve there specifically to 
photograph wildlife. There are a number of hides for viewing wildlife including 
a wooden “squirrel” hide installed by the Fife Red Squirrel Project. The 
rangers leave food for the squirrels, which come very close to the hide, 
providing excellent opportunities for photography. I am fortunate to live in 
Kinross-shire, where red squirrels are relatively common. On occasion I see 
them in my own garden, usually raiding the bird feeders.William Starkey

Young mother raccoon in the Hudson Valley

This mother raccoon had made a very cozy den in the back of our property in 
the Hudson Valley of New York. The den was well hidden as to avoid being 
discovered by the other tribes of raccoons that visit us on most evenings. 
Raccoons are very common in most regions of North America,although they wisely 
avoid most human contact.

Apparently this particular female raccoon was orphaned or abandoned when very 
young and came to depend on our supply of cat food while she was growing up. 
The feral cats don’t seem to mind sharing their food. Several months ago she 
appeared in the afternoon thirsty, hungry and wet. She had obviously just given 
birth. Over the summer the mother and her four kits visited us nightly. The 
kits have now grown up and left our land to stake-out their own territory.

The Lake St Clair National Park in Tasmania is not too far from home. There 
are a large number of wombats in the National Park, although there is no 
guarantee you will see one. We were hoping to see a wombat in the snow as this 
is a rare treat. We were lucky!Bronwyn Scanlon

I was hiking at Mount Rainier during a summer trip to Washington State. There 
were lots of chipmunks on the mountain but this one stood out, due to it being 
perched on the rock in the way it was. Using my Canon 70D with a 15-85mm lens, 
it couldn’t help but strike a pose.Hamish Kale

I took the photo at St Mary’s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear which 
is less than ten miles from where I live in Wallsend. My husband and I were at 
a day trip to the coast. There’s a well known seal colony that rests on the 
rocks at the Lighthouse at low tide. This particular seal was on the rocks and 
we watched as the tide rose and it eventually swam out to sea . There’s a 
regular seal watch there during the summer and wardens do their best to educate 
people about keeping a safe distance. I was about 50 metres away using a Canon 
70D and a 100-400 lens.Ann Chapman

Motorbike frog in our fishpond, Perth, Western Australia

This smiling frog was spotted at our home in Perth, Western Australia. We have 
a pond in our back garden where frogs have been breeding for a number of years. 
We’ve had up to twenty frogs in the pond at one time.

This particular frog, a Western Green Tree Frog or, as it is more commonly 
known, the Motorbike Frog is relatively common in our local wetlands and often 
finds it way to other water habitats such as our pond. Its loud, repetitive 
call is likened to a motor cycle changing gears. Though often reclusive, the 
frogs like to sunbathe in the pond and happily pose for photos taken with my 
Canon 7D Mark II. This one seemed particularly pleased.David Merryweather

I spotted this Buzzard on the Sanger Genome Campus in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire 
where I work. The campus is bordered by the river Cam next to the Hinxton 
Wetlands Nature Reserve. It was a nice autumn morning and I was looking for 
subjects to test my new telephoto zoom lens on during a break. The nearby 
wetlands make it an attractive place for ducks and geese, but I was also 
surprised to see this bird of prey not very far from the building where I work 
and took the opportunity to shoot a couple of pictures of which all but this 
one looked blurry or unremarkable.Ray Stefancsik

I’ve been going to Richmond Park to take photos for about a year, starting not 
long after I moved to Wandsworth. I’d seen photos of stags bellowing, but had 
never managed to catch the act myself. On this particular morning I arrived 
about an hour before sunrise and walked to the middle of the park, Pen Ponds, 
to stand and listen for the sound of bellowing. It didn’t take too long and I 
followed my ears through the darkness and fog, and found my way to this stag 
with a large harem of females. I had an amazing morning following them around 
and building their trust, before taking this photo, with a Canon 5D mk2 and a a 
Canon 70-200mm f.28 lens, shortly before I needed to move on.Richard Bromley
