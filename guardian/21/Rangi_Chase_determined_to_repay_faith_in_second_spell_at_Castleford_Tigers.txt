Rangi Chase is fully aware that he has failed to fulfil his undoubted 
potential throughout large portions of his career but, while preparing for his 
second debut forCastleford <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castleford> on 
Sunday, he says that his return to the Tigers could rejuvenate his standing in 
the game.

Chase is in Castleford’s squad to face Catalans as the player and the club 
look to rescue a season that has quickly gone off the boil. Chase started the 
year as a pivotal part ofthe Leigh side

aiming to win promotion to Super League, but he left in May having played five 
games. Castleford, tipped by many as outsiders for the title, find themselves 
in eighth place as the Super 8s approach.

Chase insists that despite his difficult time since leaving Castleford in 
2013, he is ready to repay the faith shown in him by the Tigers after they 
handed him a deal until the end of the season. “I’m honoured to have another 
chance because most people would have turned their back on me: I haven’t lived 
up to what I can do at times,” he said. “I’m delighted to come back to a place 
that has a big place in my heart.”

Daryl Powell, the Castleford coach, remains coy on whether the half-back could 
be included on Sunday – he has not played for more than two months – but 
believes that a return to familiar surroundings can bring the best out of a 
playerwho was Man of Steel

 five years ago. “If we can get him back to anywhere near the level he was back 
then we’ll have a phenomenal player on our hands,” Powell says.

“Time will tell about how good Rangi is in terms of getting back to his very 
best, but I think he’s very capable of that.”

Chase endured tumultuous exits from Salford and Leigh in the past 12 months, 
subsequently revealing a struggle with depression. In this, the annual State of 
Mind round to raise awareness of mental health issues in rugby league, Chase 
insists he can make his second spell with Castleford as successful as the 
first. “The opportunity to come back here was about playing, not money,” he 
says. “I’ve been kidding myself in the past saying I was OK, but this time I 
feel genuinely good. I’m blessed to be back at Castleford and I’m ready to go.”
