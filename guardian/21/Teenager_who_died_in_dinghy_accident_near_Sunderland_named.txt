A teenager who died after getting into trouble swimming off a dinghy in the 
sea has been named as Liam Hall.


The 17-year-old, from Southwick, Sunderland, was pulled from the sea by 
emergency services following a search and rescue operation.


He had got into difficulty at the mouth of the river Wear after heading out in 
a dinghy with three other teenagers.

Tributes were paid to him on social media. One user posted on Facebook: “RIP 
Liam, you were such a lovely lad with a heart of gold. God only takes the best. 
Fly high boyo.”

Another wrote: “Can’t even believe it! I can remember in Sandhill when I used 
to chase you all over the school. RIP beautiful!! Heart goes out to he’s family 
and friend!! Love you Liam.”


The boy and another 17-year-old were spotted in the water at about 3.22pm on 
Tuesday. Emergency services rescued the second boy and two teenage girls from 
the dinghy, but Liam remained missing.


Following a multi-agency search, the police helicopter spotted something in 
the water at about 5.10pm. RNLI lifeguards retrieved him and he was airlifted 
to the RVI with serious injuries.


Police said it is thought the boys had been in the dinghy, got out to swim and 
then got into difficulty.


A police statement said: “Police can identify the 17-year-old boy that died 
during the incident as Liam Hall who was from the Southwick area of Sunderland.”

The other three youngsters are said to be stable.
