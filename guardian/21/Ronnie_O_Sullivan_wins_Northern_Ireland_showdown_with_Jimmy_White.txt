Ronnie O’Sullivan came through a rare showdown with Jimmy White 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jimmy-white> to book his place in the third 
round of the Northern Ireland Open.

White, who has slipped to 108 in the world rankings, was facing O’Sullivan in 
the final stages of a ranking event for the first time in six years.

The 54-year-old hinted at an upset by taking a scrappy opening frame before 
O’Sullivan hit back with a 141 clearance to level the scores.

With both players struggling to find top form O’Sullivan added two more frames 
before wrapping up a 4-1 victory with a break of 95.

John Higgins <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/john-higgins> scored the 
eighth 147 break of his career as he also booked a place in round three in 
Belfast. The 41-year-old achieved the feat in the final frame of his 4-1 win 
over Sam Craigie, setting up the maximum with a brilliant cross-double on the 
final red.

Higgins is looking to claim his third consecutive ranking event title after 
wins at the China Championship and last week’s Champion of Champions tournament 
in Coventry.

He is the fifth player to hit a 147 on the tour this year after Thepchaiya 
Un-nooh, Stephen Maguire, Shaun Murphy and Alfie Burden.

Mark Allen, Kyren Wilson and Barry Hawkins were among the other winners on 
Wednesday, but the world semi-finalist Alan McManus was beaten 4-0 by the world 
No93, Sanderson Lam.
