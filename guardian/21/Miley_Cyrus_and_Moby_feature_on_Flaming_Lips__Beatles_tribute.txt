After much speculation, it has been announced that With a Little Help From My 
Fwends, theFlaming Lips <http://www.flaminglips.com/>' highly-anticipated 
tribute to the Beatles' 1967 Sgt Pepper album, will be released this autumn.

The Lips' frontman, Wayne Coyne, told Rolling Stone 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flaming-lips-sgt-peppers-tribute-album-out-this-fall-20140515>
: "People are like, 'Why do you do Beatles songs?' and I'm like, 'Because 
people love them.' I think it'll generate a lot of interest."

The full-length tribute to the seminal album is said to feature Miley Cyrus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus>, Moby and MGMT's Andrew 
VanWyngarden covering Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, with Coyne's good friend 
Cyrus also cropping up on a version of A Day in the Life, too.

"It's really just a lot of great friends of mine who are all contributing," 
says Coyne, having hinted at the collaboration with Miley Cyrus for months now. 
"Sometimes it's two groups doing a song; sometimes it's one. And it's not 
always the Flaming Lips and someone; sometimes it's just other groups. But I 
think all that's gonna be great."

He originally joined Cyrus on stage during her Bangerz in the US, holding a 
large inflatable balloon spelling Fuck Yeah, before performing Yoshimi Battles 
the Pink Robots.


A portion of the album's sales is said to be going to the Bella Foundation 
<https://thebellafoundation.org/>, a charity in the band's Oklahoma City 
hometown that assists "low-income, elderly or terminally-ill pet owners with 
the cost of veterinary care when it cannot be afforded".

Those who pre-order the album, out on 28 October via Bella Union in the UK and 
Warner Bros Records in the US, will get a download of Lucy in the Sky With 
Diamonds. This week, the Flaming Lips joined Cyrus onstage at the Phones4U 
Arena show in Manchester during her Bangerz tour, to perform Lucy in the Sky 
with Diamonds.
