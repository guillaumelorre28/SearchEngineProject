 at the weekend.

The £86m Welshman will have a scan on Tuesday but is likely to miss the games 
against Real Betis, Espanyol and Granada,according to AS 
<http://as.com/diarioas/2016/01/18/english/1453126728_370714.html>.

The club hopes he will be fit for the league match with Athletic Bilbao on 13 
February or against Roma in the Champions League on 17 February.

It is the sixth injury to the calf muscle in what has become a recurring 
problem for the forward. Bale, who opened the scoring against Gijón, was 
replaced by Jesé, who now has an opportunity to impress Zinedine Zidane.

The new manager has already been given a vote of confidence by Cristiano 
Ronaldo who said the results of “a week of hard work” are visible on the pitch, 
with the squad “in good spirits with Zidane”.

Ronaldo, who scored twice against Gijón, said Zidane had “a different concept” 
of football and “sees the game differently” to the previous coach, Rafael 
Benítez.

With half of the season still to go, Ronaldo said the team was hoping to reach 
the end of the Spanish and Champions Leagues feeling as positive, adding: “We 
are happy about how things are going.”
