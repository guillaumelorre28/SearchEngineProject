Rulli, who is a product of the Estudiantes youth system in his homeland, has 
spent the last two seasons on loan at Sociedad from the Uruguayan side 
Deportivo Maldonado and impressed the City manager, Pep Guardiola, with his 
performances in La Liga.

However, despite reports that City could look to replace Joe Hart this summer, 
it is understood that Guardiola still considers the England goalkeeper as his 
first choice and is happy for Rulli to continue his development on loan.

Having first broken into the Estudiantes team in 2013, he became a regular the 
following season before his economic rights were purchased by Maldonado, a 
second division club in Uruguay, in 2014. Like Jonathan Calleri, a striker who

Argentina at the Olympics in Rio.
