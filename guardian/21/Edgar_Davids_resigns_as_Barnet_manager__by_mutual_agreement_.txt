Barnet <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnet> said in a statement: 
"Everybody associated with the club would like to thank Edgar for his 
contribution during his time here and for his help in putting together the 
current team structure.

"The club would also like to wish Edgar the very best of luck in what we have 
no doubt will be the continuation of an illustrious career."

Davids joined the club in October 2012 as joint head-coach, working alongside 
Mark Robson. However,Davids took sole control two months later after Robson 
left the club

.

At the time there were rumours that Davids was bound for pastures new but the 
club confirmed he would stay, saying he was "keen to help the Bees return to 
the Football League". However, last monthDavids hinted he was ready to walk away

 after he picked up a third red card in eight league appearances, claiming he 
was being made a target by referees.

"I think I know for definite now that the league is targeting Barnet," he 
said. "I don't know how many games we have played now but there is weird 
decision-making all the time. It is ridiculous. I don't think I'm going to play 
any more."
