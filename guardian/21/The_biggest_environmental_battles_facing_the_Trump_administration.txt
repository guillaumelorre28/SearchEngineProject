Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is likely to 
face unprecedented opposition from environmental groups during his presidency 
as activists prepare to battle the new administration on a number of fronts 
across the US.

 While environmentalists clashed with Barack Obama over the Keystone and 
Dakota Access oil pipelines, these fights could pale in comparison to the array 
of grievances Trump will face over water security, fracking and climate change.

Climate change denial in the Trump cabinet: where do his nominees stand?

 The president-elect has vowed to approve the Keystone pipeline, which Obama 
blocked, and “very quickly” resolve the Dakota Access project, currently held 
up by the federal government after months of protests by Native Americans. 
Trump has pledged to remove “roadblocks” to oil, gas and coal developments and 
threatened to end all climate and clean energy spending.

 Opposition to this agenda has already begun in earnest, following a 
prediction by former vice-president Al Gore that there will be a “huge upsurge” 
in environmental activism, stoked by the new administration’s plans to cut 
science funding, remove the US from the Paris climate deal and appoint Scott 
Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency – an agency he 
has sued multiple times as Oklahoma attorney general.

350.org, an international environmental organization, pledged to make January 
a month of a resistance against Trump’s cabinet picks. On 9 January, the 
organization will mobilize its chapters in all 50 states to stage protests at 
senators’ district offices. It will be the beginning of what they say will be a 
sustained protest throughout the year.

In New York City in December, the Sierra Club protested Pruitt’s nomination by 
projecting an image of rising seas and the words “Don’t Trump the planet” on to 
the side of the Trump Building on Wall Street. It’s the opening salvo of what 
is likely to be a war of attrition waged by America’s largest environmental 
group, which has drawn in more monthly donors in the weeks since Trump’s 
election than it has in the past four years.

 “If Trump keeps choosing to drag us backwards to the dirty energy of the 
past, he will find unfettered opposition every step of the way,” said Michael 
Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.

Here are some of the flashpoints for environmental activists protesting issues 
relating to climate change happening around the country now and likely to erupt 
in the first few months of Trump’s presidency:

Eminent domain in Iowa 

South of Standing Rock, the sprawling Dakota Access pipeline faces another 
dispute. Landowners in Iowa are challenging the government seizure of their 
land to build the pipeline.

What will be the first actions Trump takes as president? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/10/first-actions-trump-president-video>
The pipeline is almost 90% complete in Iowa and will eventually run through 
200 parcels of private land granted to Energy Transfer Partners, the 
Texas-based company building the Dakota Access pipeline. But 17 of those parcel 
owners are suing the Iowa utilities board (IUB), arguing that the pipeline 
should be dug up and removed because the government violated the law in its use 
of eminent domain, which is the power the government has to seize private land 
for public use.

Bill Hanagan, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the case, explained 
that an Iowa law passed in 2006 prevents the state from using eminent domain to 
grant farmland to a private company if it is not in the public good. Energy 
Transfer Partners argues that the state will reap significant financial 
benefits, and the approval of the IUB is all that is required.

A judge heard the arguments for the eminent domain lawsuit on 15 December and 
will probably issue a decision in the coming weeks. But regardless of what he 
decides, the losing side is expected to appeal and protests are expected to 
continue. Environmentalists and some from the Meskwaki tribe held protests,
conducted a hunger strike 
<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2016/11/21/three-iowa-pipeline-protesters-wage-hunger-strike/94217274/>
, and faced 200 arrests, according to Edward Fallon, a former state lawmaker 
and lead climate advocate

Hanagan predicts the legal dispute may ultimately be settled in the US supreme 
court.


Divestment movement on campus

Campuses across the country have been pushing universities to divest from from 
the fossil fuel industry over the past few years. Organizers are hoping the 
environmental threats posed by Trump’s cabinet nominations of energy industry 
leaders will further galvanize the movement.

The divestment movement calls on a range of different holding funds – 
including public pensions and university endowments – to sell off their 
investments in fossil fuel companies. According to a report by Arabella 
Advisors, holding funds controlling more than $5tn have joined the divestment 
movement.

“I see a choice: to give up and give into fear or transform that into the hope 
and anger that we will need to fuel this movement,” said Greta Neubauer, 
director of Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network. She said there was a 
“growing moral consensus that investing in the fossil fuel industry is 
unacceptable”. Neubauer and others are fearful of the prospect of having a 
climate denier in the White House and the damage that could be wrought by 
cabinet appointments such as those offormer Exxon chairman Rex Tillerson for 
secretary of state 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/15/rex-tillerson-environmental-record-exxonmobil>
 andScott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency

She said students were planning to walk out of classes on the the Monday 
following Trump’s inauguration to “reject his climate denial”.


“There is no room for neutrality in the face of the administration that is 
threatening the very future of life on this planet,” Neubauer said.

Olivia Rich, the spokeswoman for New York University’s divest campaign, said 
fossil fuels were not a tenable long-term investment.

“The reason why is either the fossil fuel industry continues to do really 
well, and then the entire economy tanks because we end up with a catastrophe of 
monumental proportions, or the fossil fuel industry stops doing well because 
there’s climate action,” Rich said.

Pipelines across the US

It’s not just Dakota Access and Keystone XL. Environmental reform leaders say 
resistance is escalating tonumerous proposed oil and gas pipelines 
<http://www.ecowatch.com/fracking-pipeline-projects-2011302077.html> around the 
country.

“I think there is a growing opposition to the buildout of gas pipelines and 
the opposition crosses party lines,” said Kelly Martin, deputy director of the 
Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign for the Sierra Club. “The concerns range from 
impacts on our land and water and private property to impacts on the climate.”

Martin points to opposition to the Sabal Trail Transmission,which would 
stretch approximately 515 miles through Alabama, Georgia and Florida, as 
emblematic of future resistance.

In several spots along the route near where construction is planned, 
protesters have set up encampments.

Debra Johnson, 58, said she helped to found a camp that has been running since 
late September. She called the camp, in Live Oak, Florida, a “refuge” and a 
“unity camp” where people gather then head to demonstrations, such as a sit-in 
planned for later this month in Suwannee river state park. About 35 people are 
currently staying there, she said, though the number varies.

 Merrillee Malwitz-Jipson, a campaign organizer with the Sierra Club in 
Florida, said she had been fielding calls about how people can donate to two 
camps established along the Suwannee and Santa Fe rivers. She said said the 
pipeline poses a range of environmental concerns, including endangering the 
local groundwater supply and the risk of sinkholes.

Martin said there are also major environmental justice concerns that the 
locations of compressor stations, which she said affected air quality, would 
have adisproportionate impact 
<http://fusion.net/story/343376/southeast-gas-highway-upsets-everyone-in-pipelines-path/>
 on African American communities.

Malwitz-Jipson has been encouraging people to document construction violations 
and reach out to lawmakers. The project also faces legal challenges, including 
by the Sierra Club.


Sabal Trail, a joint venture of Spectra Energy Corp, NextEra Energy and Duke 
Energy, according toa website for the pipeline 
<http://www.sabaltrailtransmission.com/about>, is slated to become operational 
in the fall.

In an email, Andrea Grover, the director of stakeholder outreach with the 
Sabal Trail Transmission, wrote: “Sabal Trail believes that this project, as 
authorized by the federal and state agencies, is a balanced plan for the route, 
construction techniques, and the approved measures to avoid, minimize or 
mitigate impacts.” She citeda company newsletter
