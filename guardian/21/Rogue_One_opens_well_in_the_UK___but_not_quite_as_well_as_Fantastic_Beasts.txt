The winner: Rogue One

With a UK debut of £17.31m for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-review-felicity-jones-gareth-edwards>
, Disney was quick to trumpet the result as the biggest opening of 2016 as well 
as the second biggest December opening, behind last year’sStar Wars: The Force 
Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/16/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review-a-spectacular-homecoming>
. Certainly Rogue One has done well, confirming that fans will line up for Star 
Wars spin-off titles.

Disney made clear that the £17.31m debut was earned over four days. What it 
omitted to say was that, on a weekend period comparison,Fantastic Beasts and 
Where to Find Them 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/13/fantastic-beasts-review-jk-rowling-eddie-redmayne-harry-potter>
 opened bigger. Over Friday to Sunday, Rogue One grossed £13.22m, while 
Fantastic Beasts’ three-day debut was £15.33m.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story – video trailer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-video-trailer>
Fantastic Beasts has now reached £45.0m, and should push towards £50m by the 
end of its run, as families see it over Christmas. Rogue One should clean up 
during the school holiday, although the 12A certificate may be a red flag for 
families with younger children.

The Force Awakens began a year ago with £34.01m (including Thursday previews 
of £9.68m) on its way to £123m. A similar trajectory would take Rogue One to 
£63m – almost certainly ahead of Fantastic Beasts, and thus the biggest release 
of 2016. Currently, the top achievers of 2016 remainBridget Jones’s Baby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation>
 andThe Jungle Book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review>.

The impact

The arrival of Rogue One in multiple screens at most of its 698 locations had 
a devastating impact on other recent releases. Top titles such asMoana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/07/moana-review-disney-polynesian-princess-movie>
, Fantastic Beasts andSully: Miracle on the Hudson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/01/sully-review-pious-hagiopic-that-even-tom-hanks-cant-save>
 were able to hold on to a high proportion of their cinemas, but it was a 
different story lower down the chart.Arrival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/10/arrival-review-amy-adams-jeremy-renner-science-fiction>
 contracted from 283 to 156 cinemas,andAllied 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/21/allied-review-brad-pitt-marion-cotillard-fail-to-find-blitz-spirit>
 from 436 to 202.A United Kingdom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/09/a-united-kingdom-review-rosamund-pike-david-oyelowo-toronto>
 fell from 314 sites to 93, andNocturnal Animals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/02/nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-returns-with-wildly-gripping-revenge-tale>
 dropped from 49 to 15.Snowden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/08/snowden-review-oliver-stone-joseph-gordon-levitt>
 lost 103 of its 184 cinemas, andThe Birth of a Nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/08/the-birth-of-a-nation-review-nat-turner-nate-parker>
 plummeted from 196 to 49.

In terms of box office revenue, Nocturnal Animals did well to fall by only 
42%, but the others dropped more than 50%, and 80% or more in the case of 
Snowden andThe Birth of a Nation

The festive surge

The James Stewart classic It’s a Wonderful Life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/14/family.drama> expanded from 19 to 
72 cinemas, and more than tripled takings at the box office from the previous 
weekend, crashing back into the Top 10 with £86,000. Since Park Circus 
rereleased the title for Christmas 2007, it’s grossed £2.39m – an average of 
£266,000 a year. Certain venues, including Tyneside cinema and Glasgow film 
theatre, have turned it into a festive tradition. Tyneside cinema achieved 
1,600 admissions at the weekend – almost as many as saw Rogue One at the venue.

The live event: The Nutcracker

Another week, another version of The Nutcracker hits cinemas. Previously it 
was the Royal Opera House presentation; this time it was the Bolshoi Ballet’s, 
which played in cinemas on Sunday afternoon. The Bolshoi version grossed 
£135,000 from 123 cinemas, which compares unfavourably with the Royal Opera’s 
numbers: £796,000 from the live broadcast on Thursday 8 December, and £946,000 
so far including the latest set of encores.

Hits of the year

Last year saw cinema admissions surge in the UK after a dismal 2014, and few 
thought that 2016 would prove equal. After all, 2015 boasted giant hits such as 
Star Wars: The Force Awakens,Spectre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/21/spectre-review-james-bond-is-back-stylish-camp-and-sexily-pro-snowden>
 andJurassic World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/10/jurassic-world-review-chris-pratt-steven-spielberg-dinosaur-movie>
 – which collectively grossed £282m. So far nothing released in 2016 has 
managed £50m.

The surprise, then, is that overall 2016 has been a strong year for 
cinemagoing. Total UK and Ireland box office cracked £1bn in record time, 
passing the milestone on 8 October; last year it took until 25 October.

It is also surprising which films have worked best. The year’s current top 
grossers do not come from the Marvel or DC stables, but are Bridget Jones’s 
Baby and The Jungle Book. As for Marvel, few would have guessed at the start of 
the year that Deadpool (£37.9m) would beatCaptain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/captain-america-civil-war> (£36.9m) – the 
latter a full-on Avengers movie in all but name.

In 2015, eight films exceeded £30m at the UK box office. This year, there have 
already been 10; Rogue One will be 11th. On top of that, The Force Awakens, a 
2015 release, grossed £35.9m in 2016, effectively making it the 12th film to 
clear £30m. One of those £30m hits this year has beenThe BFG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/21/the-bfg-review-mark-rylance-towers-over-roald-dahls-classic-tale>
, a notable flop in the US, but one of the biggest family successes here in the 
UK, where source authorRoald Dahl <https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl>
, who would have been 100 this year, is so beloved. Another title that punched 
above its weight in the UK wasThe Girl on the Train 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/03/the-girl-on-the-train-review-emily-blunt-paula-hawkins>
, which grossed $75.3m in the US and £23.7m here. While the book’s setting is 
south-east England, the transposition of the story to New York state does not 
seem to have diminished UK audiences’ enthusiasm.
