Eddie Hearn is confident a blockbuster fight between Anthony Joshua and 
Wladimir Klitschko <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wladimir-klitschko> can 
take place before the end of the year.

Joshua is currently pencilled in for a mandatory defence of his IBF 
heavyweight belt on 26 November while Klitschko is looking for an opponent 
after his rematch with Tyson Fury, scheduled for later this month,was cancelled 
for a second time

The fight may also be for the WBA and WBO belts if Fury is stripped of them, 
and Hearn says both fighters want the bout to go ahead. “I am hopeful, both 
guys have it in their mind that that is going to be the next fight,” the 
promoter said. “There are plenty of hurdles to overcome still and day by day we 
are ticking each of them off and I think there is a real expectancy from all 
sides now that that will be the next fight.

“Can we push that back to December? I’d like a little bit more time, that’s a 
possibility as well. Wladimir Klitschko against Joshua is the most likely 
scenario. There are less lucrative ones Klitschko could take, some easier ones 
definitely. Klitschko has been training for 12 months, he has got the bit 
between his teeth and he wants to fight.

“The Joshua fight is probably the biggest out there in the division right now 
and it is a great fight – a young lion coming through against the master.

“Is it too early for Anthony Joshua 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anthony-joshua>? Maybe, but isn’t that what 
makes it exciting? Anthony is ready for the fight and wants the fight. Wladimir 
wants the fight and all being well we can overcome the inevitable hurdles that 
come with a magnitude of this fight.”
