Western Bulldogs <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/western-bulldogs> are the 
2016 premiers. This statement, so unlikely at so many points of an improbable 
campaign, is the product of the Bulldogs outlasting the Sydney Swans 13.11 (89) 
to 10.7 (67) in a pulsating AFL grand final.


No less than 99,981 fans crammed into the MCG to witness the Bulldogs‚Äô first 
grand final since 1961 and their first premiership since 1954. It caps the most 
remarkable of seasons for the club and the competition. From seventh on the 
ladder and handicapped by a succession of cruel injuries, the Bulldogs have 
dominated this finals series, riding an unstoppable wave of momentum.

Luke Beveridge deserves the highest acclaim. This is his triumph. Beveridge‚Äôs 
ability to channel the energy within his group over the past two seasons and 
harness the goodwill pouring his club‚Äôs way in recent weeks has been a peerless 
coaching accomplishment. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve ridden on your wings,‚Äù he told supporters from 
the dais, before draping his Jock McHale medal around the neck of a tearful 
Robert Murphy. The coach then stood aside to allow Murphy and Easton Wood to 
lift the premiership cup for only the second time in the club‚Äôs history.

In keeping with the finals campaign, Beveridge masterminded a team victory. 
Tom Boyd came of age as a power forward, Liam PIcken showed he‚Äôs a jack of all 
trades and master of most and Jason Johannisen, with a team high 33 disposals, 
took home the Norm Smith medal. But there were contributors everywhere you 
looked. Easton Wood and Dale Morris spoiled everything in defence. Clay Smith 
laid 11 tackles. Tory Dickson kicked three goals in a faultless performance in 
front of goal. You got the feeling Beveridge could throw a guernsey on a member 
of the cheer squad and they would deliver decisive contribution.

There were six lead changes throughout the game, and the margin stood at just 
one point midway through the final quarter. Each side threatened to run away 
with it at different points. Only in the closing stages did the Dogs do so, 
decisively.

As magnificent as the contest was, it wasn‚Äôt a celebration of precise 
football. The winning team went inside 50 on 59 occasions for only six marks. 
Dane Rampe and Heath Grundy snaffled 20 of those between them. But what was 
lacking in polish was more than made up for in industry. It was a brutal affair 
for three and a half quarters, but when the late afternoon haze began to 
shimmer through the MCG it was the Dogs who had the run to kick their way home.

The tone was set from the opening bounce and two minutes of preposterous, 
stoppage-free demolition derby action, with bodies hurled at pace into contact 
and neither side able to control possession.

So hot was the footy, the first goal took 12 minutes to arrive. Luke Parker 
took the honours but its genesis was one of the great grand final marks by 
Kieren Jack. Running with the flight towards the arc, the Swans co-captain flew 
like a cannon ball, secured the grab, and then had the stuffing thumped out of 
him by Wood‚Äôs shoulder.

By this point Lance Franklin had already been off the ground for five minutes 
after rolling his ankle in a marking contest. Best on ground when these sides 
met earlier in the season, the injury-blunted the spearhead for the remainder 
of the game.

The Bulldogs took to the first break with a four-point advantage courtesy of 
goals from Tory Dickson and Zaine Cordy. They should have been further ahead. 
True to prematch form the balance of play was in Sydney‚Äôs defensive territory 
but the Dogs, so slick by hand, were clumsy by foot. At times they weren‚Äôt just 
missing targets they gave the impression they weren‚Äôt even looking for any.

Sydney struggled to capitalise on the rebound. As well as Franklin‚Äôs issues, 
Xavier Richards and George Hewett struggled to get into the game and whenever a 
marking chain threatened, a blue defender left his man to spoil.

The first quarter reaped only three goals but it was absorbing and intense. 
The second belched 11 and will rank among the great quarters in grand final 
history.

Boyd, Picken and Dickson marched the Dogs into a 16-point lead but a sharp 
snap from the excellent Tom Mitchell jump-started the Swans into action. Gary 
Rohan kicked the most peculiar goal of the day, the game having stopped for an 
age with the noise too loud for any player in earshot to hear the umpire 
screaming that the supposed mark had been touched.

All of which was a prelude to the Josh Kennedy show. The Swan turned on beast 
mode for a passage, kicking two, Sydney‚Äôs third and fourth in succession to 
drag the game their way. By half-time the finals specialist had amassed 22 
possessions, two goals, and was a monty for best on ground.

What should have been a clear half time lead for the Swans was dragged to just 
two points in the shadow of the siren, and in controversial circumstances. Jack 
was incorrectly penalised for kicking in danger and fined 50 metres for 
dissent. The Swan deserved a free-kick of his own for forceful contact below 
the knees but his cries fell on deaf ears. Toby McLean held his nerve.

The third quarter resembled the first, with clear attacking chances at a 
premium. Dickson and Kennedy exchanged lead changes early on but neither side 
could break the shackles, setting up a grandstand finale.

The finale that began with Daniel Hannebery carried off the ground after his 
left knee buckled in a ferocious Wood tackle, the latest in a long line of 
incidents that went against the Sydneysiders. The Bulldogs won the free kick 
count 20-8.

It was an ominous start, and despite Franklin booting the opening goal of the 
term, the Bulldogs had the ascendancy. Jake Stringer, a peripheral figure all 
afternoon, snapped accurately to extend the lead back to seven, and almost as 
soon as Hewett replied, Picken restored belief.

The game was unravelling as a structured contest. Bodies strewn all over the 
turf, the Sherrin bobbling of its own accord. Through the chaos, Boyd strode 
like a man with his own forcefield to wallop the sealer.

Win or lose there would be Bulldog tears. They‚Äôre that kind of a group; it‚Äôs 
been that kind of a year. But when Beveridge and Murphy moved boundaryside two 
minutes before the final siren, the emotion was already overwhelming. It was as 
pure a scene as you could design in the heat of battle, capped moments later by 
the coach‚Äôs generosity ‚Äì a fairytale ending to a magical story.
