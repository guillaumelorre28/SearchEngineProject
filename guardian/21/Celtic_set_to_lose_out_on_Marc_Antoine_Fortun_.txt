Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> look set to be priced out 
of the race to sign Marc-Antoine Fortuné after Nancy accepted offers from three 
English clubs.

The new Celtic manager, Tony Mowbray, had targeted the striker after he 
impressed during a loan spell at his former clubWest Bromwich Albion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom> last season. But Celtic will 
need to produce an offer of around £3.5m to stop him moving to the Premier 
League.

The Hull City manager, Phil Brown, has confirmed having negotiations with 
Nancy, while Portsmouth,Wolverhampton Wanderers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolves> and Fulham have also been linked 
with the player.

Nancy's sporting director, Nicolas Holveck, said: "We have accepted three 
separate offers, all from English clubs. All are in excess of €4m [£3.4m] and, 
with add-ons, one is approaching the five-million mark.

"We are happy to allow the player to begin negotiations with these clubs and 
we expect the transfer to be formalised by Monday. It's still possible he could 
move to Celtic but they have yet to make an acceptable offer."
