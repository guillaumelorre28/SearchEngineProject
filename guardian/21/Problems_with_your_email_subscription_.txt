I've signed up to one of your emails, but I'm not receiving it.

• Do you use Hotmail or Yahoo webmail? If so, they are probably automatically 
sending our emails to your junk mail folder because they see they are sent to 
multiple addresses and assume they are spam.

Hotmail users should go to hotmail.com <http://www.hotmail.com> and click on 
Frequently Asked Questions, then choose the link saying: 'How can MSN Hotmail 
help me to fight spammers?' This will explain how you can set your own 'Junk 
Mail Deletion Options' to allow Guardian emails to reach you.

Yahoo users should visit help.yahoo.com/help/mail/ 
<http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/> and click on the 'Bulk Mail Folder?' By
following these instructions 
<http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/index.html?pir=dofUPFBibUndMFr08uBkAFR.QRUXBkZHNdNgRnFzvWETgjDPTdRPBtPRTDN4HYXj_1SUcWM->
 you can set up a filter to ensure our emails aren't sent to the Bulk Mail 
Folder.

• Do you work for a company that filters or censors your mail? If so, they may 
have identified our emails as non-business-related and quarantined or deleted 
them. You might consider having a word with your IT administrator or setting up 
a web-based account.

• Have you set up a spam filter yourself? Some of these will delete our emails.

• If none of these apply, email userhelp@theguardian.com 
<mailto:userhelp@theguardian.com> and ask us to check that you really are on 
the list.

I want to unsubscribe, but it isn't working.

• Check that the email address you're now using is the same as the one you 
signed up with. Go totheguardian.com <https://www.theguardian.com/international>
. If your email address does not display in the top-left hand corner, click 
sign in. Otherwise, click on 'My details'. If the email service you are 
receiving doesn't display under 'My email services' email
userhelp@theguardian.com <mailto:userhelp@theguardian.com> and ask us to remove 
you, quoting the address on the profile page or any alternative address you may 
have used.

I got a message saying I'd been unsubscribed, but I didn't want to be

• We will automatically unsubscribe you if our emails to you bounce back 
several days running. This is usually because your account has been cut off, 
your inbox is full, you haven't checked your email for a while, your server has 
been down for a long time, or it has been set to reject emails from the 
Guardian. If you still don't know why you were unsubscribed, email us at
userhelp@theguardian.com <mailto:userhelp@theguardian.com>; we may be able to 
find out.

I want to change the address to which you send my emails

• You will need to update your profile on the site. Go to theguardian.com 
<https://www.theguardian.com/international>. If your old email address does not 
show in the top left-hand corner you need to sign in. If the email address is 
showing, click on 'My details' in the top left-hand corner. Then follow the 
instructions

I can't find the answer to my question here ...

• Email userhelp@theguardian.com <mailto:userhelp@theguardian.com> and we will 
try to help you.
