Full-time: Liverpool 3-0 Villarreal (agg 3-1)

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over - Liverpool are through to their first 
European final since 2007. It was easy for them tonight, as many of their 
players excelled against a Villarreal side that just didn’t give a good account 
of themselves. They weren’t allowed to - Liverpool tore into them from the 
get-go and goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana piled the hurt on
Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> after Bruno had 
put the hosts ahead with an own goal.

77 min: Heart-in-mouth time for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> fans as Denis Suarez gets a 
blatant shove in the back from Alberto Moreno in the penalty area. The referee 
doesn’t give it and it’s a bad decision. That was unquestionably a penalty. 
He’s got away with it, but what a completely idiotic thing for Moreno to do.

74 min: Going back to Ruiz’s dismissal: the centre-half was already on a 
yellow card and picked up his second for a late challenge on Adam Lallana. Upon 
seeing the yellow card come out of the referee’s pocket, he applauded 
sarcastically before the long, lonely trudge to the dressing room. Liverpool 
lead 2-o andVillarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> are 
down to 10 men.

played in Sturridge with a neat pass and the finish from close range could 
scarcely have been more composed. The most difficult part of his task was 
remaining onside, truth be told.

free-kick, wide on the right a long way out. Jonathan dos Santos’s delivery is 
wonderful and Roberto Soldado wins the header. His effort fizzes wide when he 
really should have hit the target. A good chance gone begging, there.

54 min: From the perspective of a neutral, a Villarreal

an already entertaining game up a notch. They’re being dominated by Liverpool 
and have been under the cosh throughout, but haven’t gone without chances. They

He dives in to hook the ball away from the foot of Cedric Bakambu at the exact 
moment theVillarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> striker 
was about to pull the trigger and looked certain to score after being put 
through on goal. Brilliant defending by the Croat.

Second half: Liverpool 1-0 Villarreal (agg: 1-1)

46 min: Villarreal get the ball rolling for the second half. We’ll have extra 
time and the possibility of penalties if there are no further goals, but I’ll 
be astonished if we have a goalless 45 minutes. There don’t appear to be any 
changes of personnel on either side. Interesting stat from BT Sport’s Owen 
Hargreaves: Villarreal have only failed to score once in their past 32Europa 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> matches.

John Dutton has been in touch ...

He’s written in to say that I’m mistaken, Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> captain Bruno didn’t shin the 
ball into his own net. It was instead, he says, quite literally sucked into the 
net by the Kop.

Half-time at Anfield: Liverpool 1-0 Villarreal (Agg: 1-1)

It’s all square on aggregate after Bruno unwittingly and reluctantly restored 
parity by delecting the ball into his own net.Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> looked a bag of nerves as 
they started and were unable to handle Liverpool’s press, but they improved 
towards the end of the half. They’re very much second best on the evening 
however and manager Marcelino will have to come up with some ideas if they’re 
to beat Liverpool tonight.

33 min: Roberto Soldado makes a meal of a challenge from Dejan Lovren, who 
subsequently makes a meal of having his ankle grabbed by theVillarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> man as he was sitting on the 
ground. The referee keeps his yellow card in jhis pocket but gives both men a 
talking-to. I’d like to think he’s reminding them that they’re grown men who 
are embarrassing themselves with that kind of tomfoolery.

30 min: Liverpool win a corner, which Milner sends in from the left. Dejan 
Lovren leaps and attempts to float a header over Alphonse, but the goalkeeper 
finally manages to catch the ball. Victor Ruiz picked up a booking for some 
indiscretion or other in the build-up to that corner. His colleague Denis 
Suarez was lucky to avoid a yellow for a petulant trip on Milner a few moments 
previously.

25 min: Liverpool win a corner, which is sent into the mixer. Alphonse comes 
off his line, flaps helplessly and doesn’t get near the ball, leaving it up to 
Tomas Pina to head the ball out for another corner to prevent the waiting Emre 
Can from tapping in at the far post. Milner takes the second corner and
Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> clear.

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over - Liverpool are through to their first 
European final since 2007. It was easy for them tonight, as many of their 
players excelled against a Villarreal side that just didn’t give a good account 
of themselves. They weren’t allowed to - Liverpool tore into them from the 
get-go and goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana piled the hurt on
Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> after Bruno had 
put the hosts ahead with an own goal.

90+3 min: Denis Suarez gets booked. 
 
90+2 min: Joe Allen picks out Adam Lallana, who sells Jaume Costa a dummy 
before shooting for the top corner. Excellent save from Areola in theVillarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> goal.
 
90+1 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
substitution: Lucas on for Daniel Sturridge.
 
90 min: The home fans strike up a rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone, as 
their team pass the ball around amongst themselves. Villarreal’s players look 
like they just want this nightmare to end. They’ve been totally outplayed 
tonight.
 
89 min: Liverpool substitution: Roberto Firmino off, he’s been excellent 
tonight. Christian Benteke on.

87 min: Through on goal with just the goalkeeper to beat, Sturridge is unable 
to slot the ball past Areola, who saves at the striker’s feet.

86 min: Emre Can has a shot from distance. It’s on target, but Alphonse Areola 
saves comfortably enough.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> substitution from a couple of 
minutes ago: Joe Allen on for Philippe Coutinho.
 
85 min: On the Villarreal bench, manager Marcelino has the look about him of a 
man who is well aware the jig is up. His side are losing 3-1 on aggregate and 
down to 10 men. Liverpool are set fair for a place in theEuropa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> final, where they 
will almost certainly face Sevilla.
 
82 min: Roberto Firmino did superbly there to take the ball down the left 
flanks and around Mateo Musacchio and pull ity back into the penalty area from 
the byline. Daniel Sturridge’s shot from near the penalty spot was scuffed or 
half-blocked, but Adam Lallana was on hand to finish the job. It wasn’t the 
prettiest goal you’ll ever see, but they all count.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> can’t possibly blow this now, 
types minute-by-minute reporter tempting fate.

81 min: Adam Lallana prods home after great play from Roberto Firmino.

80 min: Sturridge traps the ball brilliantly to control a long pass from 
Coutinho. A couple of step-overs later he shoots high and wide from a tight 
angle, when perhaps holding the ball up and waiting for the cavalry might have 
been a better idea.
 
77 min: Heart-in-mouth time for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> fans as Denis Suarez gets a 
blatant shove in the back from Alberto Moreno in the penalty area. The referee 
doesn’t give it and it’s a bad decision. That was unquestionably a penalty. 
He’s got away with it, but what a completely idiotic thing for Moreno to do.
 
76 min: Roberto Firmino has a rasping shot punched clear by Alphonse Areola. 
Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> substitution: Dos 
Santos off for the replacement centre-half Daniele Bonera.
 
74 min: Going back to Ruiz’s dismissal: the centre-half was already on a 
yellow card and picked up his second for a late challenge on Adam Lallana. Upon 
seeing the yellow card come out of the referee’s pocket, he applauded 
sarcastically before the long, lonely trudge to the dressing room. Liverpool 
lead 2-o andVillarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> are 
down to 10 men.
 
71 min: Philippe Coutinho takes the free-kick but shoots straight into the 
wall. A poor effort, considering how dodgy the goalkeeper’s been tonight. Any 
sort of shot on target would surely have gone in!
 
70 min: Victor Ruiz gets his marching orders from Viko Kassai and walks off to 
a chorus of “Cheerio! Cheerio! Cheerio!” Liverpool have a free-kick just 
outside theVillarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> penalty 
area, a little right of the D.

70 min: Alphonse Areola drops the ball again, failing to hold on to a cross 
from Firmino. There’s nobody on hand in aLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> shirt to capitalise.

68 min: Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> 
substitution: Adrian Lopez on for Roberto Soldado.
 
66 min: Cedric Bakambu latches on to a long pass over the top from Denis 
Suarez. His first touch lets him down in a very promising position.

66 min: Roberto Moreno bamboozles a Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> defender with a dazzling 
piece of footwork on the turn, before teeing up Alberto Moreno. He pulls his 
low drive wide.
 
64 min: From a Villarreal point of view, that was a sdoft one for Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> to concede. Roberto Firmino 
played in Sturridge with a neat pass and the finish from close range could 
scarcely have been more composed. The most difficult part of his task was 
remaining onside, truth be told.

Daniel Sturridge puts Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 2-0 up on the night and ahead 
on aggregate. He nutmegged the goalkeeper from six yards out and wheels away in 
delirious celebration.

61 min: Meanwhile in Spain, Sevilla lead Shakhtar 3-1 on the night and 5-3 on 
aggregate. It seems they’re about to qualify for their 393rdEuropa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> final in a row.
 
60 min: Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> 
substittion: Manu Trigueros on for Tomas Pina. A central midfielder for a 
central midfielder.
 
58 min: James Milner plays the ball to the near post, where Roberto Soldado 
heads clear. A poor corner from Milner, who’s having a good game tonight.
 
57 min: Coutinho plays the ball wide to Clyne, who wins a corner for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> off Jaume Costa the left-back.
 
55 min: Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> 
free-kick, wide on the right a long way out. Jonathan dos Santos’s delivery is 
wonderful and Roberto Soldado wins the header. His effort fizzes wide when he 
really should have hit the target. A good chance gone begging, there.
 
54 min: From the perspective of a neutral, a Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> goal would really help crank 
an already entertaining game up a notch. They’re being dominated by Liverpool 
and have been under the cosh throughout, but haven’t gone without chances. They 
will get more.
 
52 min: Nathaniel Clyne crosses from the right, but Victor Ruiz heads the ball 
out for a corner. From the ensuing inswinger, Emre Can shoots well wide from 
outside the box.
 
52 min: Sturridge shoots from the edge of the Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> penalty area. His shot 
bounces in front of the goalkeeper, who gathers comfortably.
 
50 min: James Milner picks up a pass from Firmino on the edge of the Villarreal
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> penalty area, takes out a 
defender with a wonderful touch and then unleashes a low drive. He aims for the 
bottom corner, but doesn’t trouble Alphonse Areola.
 
49 min: Alphonse Areola in the Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> goal tries to punch a 
Philippe Coutinho shot, but his effort is quick. The ball refuses to drop for 
Milner. Well, it dropseventually, but not kindly for the midfielder.

47 min: More good defending, this time at the other end. Musacchio slides in 
to block a Daniel Sturridge shot from a narrow angle. TheLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> stirker had been played in 
down the inside left by Coutinho.

46 min: Another fine challenge from Dejan Lovren, who’s been immense tonight. 
He dives in to hook the ball away from the foot of Cedric Bakambu at the exact 
moment theVillarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> striker 
was about to pull the trigger and looked certain to score after being put 
through on goal. Brilliant defending by the Croat.
 
46 min: Villarreal get the ball rolling for the second half. We’ll have extra 
time and the possibility of penalties if there are no further goals, but I’ll 
be astonished if we have a goalless 45 minutes. There don’t appear to be any 
changes of personnel on either side. Interesting stat from BT Sport’s Owen 
Hargreaves: Villarreal have only failed to score once in their past 32Europa 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> matches.
 
He’s written in to say that I’m mistaken, Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> captain Bruno didn’t shin the 
ball into his own net. It was instead, he says, quite literally sucked into the 
net by the Kop.

It’s all square on aggregate after Bruno unwittingly and reluctantly restored 
parity by delecting the ball into his own net.Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> looked a bag of nerves as 
they started and were unable to handle Liverpool’s press, but they improved 
towards the end of the half. They’re very much second best on the evening 
however and manager Marcelino will have to come up with some ideas if they’re 
to beat Liverpool tonight.
 
45 min: Dejan Lovren slides in to prevent Cedric Bakamba from prodding home a 
cross from the right. Good defending.

44 min: There will be no added time at the end of the half. None. Shakhtar 
have equalised against Sevilla in the other semi-finasl, where it’s 1-1 (agg: 
3-3).
 
41 min: Nathaniel Clyne sends a cross in from the right, which Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> half-clear. Milner sends the 
ball back into the mixer, but the Spanish side clear their lines more 
convincingly this time.
 
39 min: Roberto Soldado gets booked for a late and daft tackle on Philippe 
Coutinho. He has the air about him of a man who is losing the plot, does 
Roberto. The way he’s going I wouldn’t be too confident he’ll last 90 minutes.
 
38 min: Gadding down the left flank, Sturridge attempts to pick out Firmino on 
the edge of theVillarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> 
penalty area, but his pass goes astray.
 
36 min: Alberto Moreno attempts to pull the ball across the penalty area for 
Sturridge, but it’s cut out. Milner goes on to win a corner, his low drive 
going out off Musacchio. He curls the ball in from the left, but the goalkeeper 
plucks it from the air.
 
35 min: Nathaniel Clyne gets booked for a fairly innocuous looking challenge 
on Soldado as he challenged him for the ball.
 
33 min: Roberto Soldado makes a meal of a challenge from Dejan Lovren, who 
subsequently makes a meal of having his ankle grabbed by theVillarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> man as he was sitting on the 
ground. The referee keeps his yellow card in jhis pocket but gives both men a 
talking-to. I’d like to think he’s reminding them that they’re grown men who 
are embarrassing themselves with that kind of tomfoolery.

30 min: Liverpool win a corner, which Milner sends in from the left. Dejan 
Lovren leaps and attempts to float a header over Alphonse, but the goalkeeper 
finally manages to catch the ball. Victor Ruiz picked up a booking for some 
indiscretion or other in the build-up to that corner. His colleague Denis 
Suarez was lucky to avoid a yellow for a petulant trip on Milner a few moments 
previously.

28 min: Firmino wins a corner for Liverpool in his efforts to turn Mateo 
Musacchio. Milner floats the ball into the penalty area andVillarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> embark on a lightning fast 
counter-attack that comes to an abrupt end when Dejan Lovren dispossesses Denis 
Suarez with a fine challenge.
 
26 min: Alberto Moreno lands awkwardly after leaping into an aerial challenge. 
He’ll live.
 
25 min: Liverpool win a corner, which is sent into the mixer. Alphonse comes 
off his line, flaps helplessly and doesn’t get near the ball, leaving it up to 
Tomas Pina to head the ball out for another corner to prevent the waiting Emre 
Can from tapping in at the far post. Milner takes the second corner and
Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> clear.
