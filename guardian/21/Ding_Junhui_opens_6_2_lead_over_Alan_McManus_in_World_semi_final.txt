The Chinese player had to qualify for the Crucible this year after slipping 
out of the worldâ€™s top 16 but has been impressive up to this point.

Ding dropped only seven frames in three best-of-19 qualifying matches and 
knocked out Martin Gouldand Judd Trump in the first two rounds

 before winning his quarter-final against Mark Williams 13-3 with a session to 
spare.

He began this match in the same form, with breaks of 100, 84 and 131 taking 
him into a 3-0 lead. He added the fourth and made another 100 break to go 5-0 
up before McManus, in the last four for the first time since 1993, got on the 
board in frame six.

A precise long red helped the veteran Scot take the next as well but Ding 
scored a 128 in the last frame of the session for a 6-2 advantage.
