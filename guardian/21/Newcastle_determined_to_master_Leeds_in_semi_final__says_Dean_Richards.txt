Newcastle dominated the regular season in the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/championship-rugby-union>, losing one of 
their 22 games, but they go into the second leg of their play-off semi-final 
against Leeds at Kingston Park on Sunday trailing by five points.

The Falcons conceded a last-minute try at Headingley in the first leg and 
their director of rugby,Dean Richards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dean-richards>, said "We were not as 
prepared mentally as they were and the defeat has woken us up," he said. "We 
did not pay them enough respect and I was annoyed and frustrated after the 
game. The players are aware of what went wrong and are determined to put it 
right."

The winner of the tie will meet Bedford, conquerors of Nottingham, in the 
two-legged final on 23 and 29 May. The achievement of the Blues givesLondon 
Welsh <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-welsh> a chance of retaining 
their Premiership status. While Newcastle and Leeds meet the entry criteria for 
the Premiership, Bedford do not, although the Blues, following London Welsh's 
example last year, have said that if they win the final they would challenge 
any decision to keep them out of the top flight.
