<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> side Grimsby have 
sacked their manager, Mike Newell. Grimsby lie 23rd in the table after being 
beaten 2-0 at home to Rochdale yesterday, their fourth league defeat in 
succession.

A statement on the club's website read: "Despite the intention for continued 
support beyond the recent poor results and disappointing performances, the club 
has dismissed Mike Newell due to irretrievable breakdown.

"The directors believe they have done everything possible to back him during 
his period with the club but were left with no alternative but to terminate his 
contract with immediate effect.

"The club appreciates Mike Newell's efforts to take this football club forward 
and wish him all the best for the future.

"The club will now begin the task of selecting and appointing a new manager."

The youth team manager, Neil Woods, will take care of the side in a caretaker 
capacity.
