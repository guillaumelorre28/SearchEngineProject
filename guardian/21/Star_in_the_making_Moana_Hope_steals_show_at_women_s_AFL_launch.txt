The inaugural AFL women’s league has its first cult figure, with Moana Hope 
stealing the show on Thursday. Hope andAFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> chief executive Gillon McLachlan 
greeted each other on stage in Melbourne with a “dab” hip-hop dance move as she 
was confirmed as one of 16 marquee players for the new league.

She will play for Collingwood and, similar to Magpies star Dane Swan, her 
right arm is covered in tattoos. Hope is a long-time Magpies fan and comes from 
Broadmeadows, where club president Eddie McGuire grew up.

As one of the best forwards in women’s football, Hope also can play and should 
be an immediate star when the league starts next February. “I feel very 
blessed. It’s an opportunity I’m not going to hold lightly,” Hope said.

Top women’s players such as Daisy Pearce and Tayla Harris were predictably 
also among the first 16 named, with two apiece for the eight teams. 

Several West Australian players are relocating to other states to ensure an 
even distribution of the best players. The AFL held simultaneous announcements 
in WA, Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane as well as Melbourne to announce the 
players. 

But Hope was the undoubted highlight. Rather than simply shake McLachlan’s 
hand when she walked on stage, Hope proposed beforehand that they “dab”. The 
dance move has become popular as a sporting celebration.

“There was a lot of explaining and a lot of practising, too,” Hope said. “He 
didn’t know what it was ... he did pretty good for his first time.”

Hope, also a talented cricketer before choosing football, is looking forward 
to meeting Swan and says it’s “fate” that she’ll play for the Magpies.
