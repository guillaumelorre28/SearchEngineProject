Clothes can make people like you!

This is the actual point of the red carpet, when you think about it. The red 
carpet is the only time we watch actors and actresses being themselves. It is 
their moment to promote their personal brand: fun, kooky, clever, sweet, 
whatever. The smart ones know that for the long-term longevity of this brand 
you need people to like you, not just fancy you. Cate Blanchett is brilliant at 
this. I’ve only ever seen Blanchett being a scary ice queen (Elizabeth, Blue 
Jasmine) or a kids’ film scary ice queen (the Lord of the Rings trilogy; the 
Hobbit) and, once, a madwoman called Lotte in a German play at the Barbican I 
couldn’t make head or tail of. And yet she has my lifelong devotion, primarily 
forthe lavender and yellow Givenchy she wore at the 2011 Oscars 
<http://www.redcarpet-fashionawards.com/2011/02/28/cate-blanchett-in-givenchy-couture-2011-oscars/>
, but also for livening up every red carpet I’ve ever covered. See also: Claire

 Hourglass shape ... Sandra Bullock in navy McQueen at last year’s Oscars.

For impact, shape matters more than anything else

Corsetry is your friend. Boning is your friend. If your dress lets it all hang 
out, you have to hold your tummy in. And nobody remembers to hold their tummy 
in except when they are looking in the mirror, and especially not after two 
glasses of champagne. This is not just about looking thin, it’s about looking 
like you have a shape, because shape looks good in photographs. On camera, a 
dress with a waist looks more dynamic and warm than a loose, blobby shape, 
which is why every red carpet, ever, is dominated by hourglass shapes. The 
masterclass:Sandra Bullock at last year’s Oscars in navy blue McQueen 
<http://oscar.go.com/photos/tag/sandra+bullock>. Look inside a really good 
red-carpet gown and you will find two corsets: an inner one to squeeze you in, 
and then an outer one that keeps the dress in shape but is fractionally larger 
than the inner one, so that the dress never looks too small. I am not 
advocating two corsets in real life, but the takeaway here is that in any 
situation where you will end up in photos where you want to look nice – from 
your wedding, to being photographed at work – you will make life easier for 
yourself if you wear something with a built-in shape.

 Offputting ... Nicole Kidman in high-neck Balenciaga. Photograph: Steve 
Granitz/WireImage 
High collars make you look a bit mean

The thought process behind wearing a high-necked evening dress is impeccable – 
why should women bare their chests, making themselves exposed and vulnerable, 
when – at least, since the tragic demise of boyband JLS – a man would never do 
the same? And anyway, if you’ve been even remotely concentrating on fashion 
recently, you’ll be aware that polonecks are quite the thing. But the brutal 
fact is that high collars for evening are deeply offputting. Think ofNicole 
Kidman in that Balenciaga dress with the raised turtleneck and the red bow at 
the neck, at the 2007 Oscars 
<http://www.zimbio.com/Nicole+Kidman/articles/FY87fWNzop5/Nicole+Kidman+Red+Bow+Dress+vs+Emma+Stone>
. She looked terrifying! (The outsize bow that looked like a mechanical key for 
a wind-up robot didn’t help.) This doesn’t mean you have to go bare and 
strapless: both Helen Mirren and Judi Dench always show some skin at the 
throat, but cover their arms and shoulders.

Pretty-but-blah dresses don’t cut it except on pre-teen bridesmaids




The most common red carpet mistake is to go soft and ruffly and drippy. That 
lobotimised dolly look is my red carpet bugbear. Also, it is in my experience a 
bad sign, career-wise. You can basically date the steepening downward 
trajectory of Jennifer Lopez’s cultural relevance to when she worea great 
Southern Belle ballgown to the Met Ball 
<http://chouchicblog.com/top-10-red-carpet-looks-jennifer-lopez/jlo-1-murad/>. 
Can the word “fairytale” be applied to your dress? Have you reached puberty? If 
the answer to both of these questions is yes, you are in the wrong dress.

 Fabulous earrings ... Sienna Miller at the Golden Globes. Photograph: Jeff

It’s not just about the dress

The devil is indeed in the details. Like, use fake tan – not too much, but a 
little – if you are pale. Yes, yes, I know Blanchett and Glenn Close look 
incredible, but they are otherworldly goddesses. Normal humans always, always 
look better a little bit tanned. (Felicity Jones, I’m talking to you!) Also, it 
is impossible to overstate the importance of backcombing and Elnett. Sade was 
basically the only woman who ever looked really good with flat hair. (Again: 
goddess.) Also, there is almost no look that cannot be improved by a pair of 
really fabulous earrings. (See:Sienna Miller at the Golden Globes <>.)

 Forever emerald ... Julianne Moore. Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty

If it works for you, stick to it

Julianne Moore’s colouring looks fantastic in emerald green. Jennifer 
Aniston’s shoulders look awesome in halternecks. Neither of them are afraid to 
reprise a formula that works. There is a misguided narcissism at the heart of 
the idea that you can’t wear a black jumpsuit to Lucy’s birthday party because 
you wore one to Nina’s Christmas drinks. Your eveningwear wardrobe is unlikely 
to be constantly on the mind of anyone else, however much they love you. There 
are many issues to be negotiated when getting dressed, but boring other people 
is an imaginary problem.

 Cape crusader ... Gwyneth Paltrow in Tom Ford gown at the 2012 Oscars. 
Photograph: Dan MacMedan/WireImage 
Timeless = good. Old-fashioned = bad

My all-time least-favourite red carpets to write about are the ones when I 
feel like I’ve slipped through a snag in the time-space continuum and landed in 
1961. Silver screen glamour is boring and wet and irrelevant if you don’t bring 
it up to date. This is not about wearing trainers on the red carpet, it’s about 
referencing modern style in an elegant way. My all-time favourite example of 
this is the Tom Ford white caped gown thatGwyneth Paltrow wore to the Oscars in 
2012 
<http://www.redcarpet-fashionawards.com/2012/02/27/gwyneth-paltrow-in-tom-ford-2012-oscars/>
. It looked like she was shoulder-robing the cape, which brought a fabulously 
Wintour-esque front-row moment to the red carpet. See also: Cara Delevingne in 
a little black dress with a diamond ear cuff.

Your mum was right. Stand up straight!

Seriously, this drives me insane. Keira Knightley: fabulous, talented, 
stylish, but sticks her head forward like a duck. The Duchess of Cambridge: 
beautiful, enviable height, but ruins it with that round-shouldered slouch. At 
the other extreme: pageant poses makes you look like an idiot. The 
one-leg-forward pose jumped the shark with Angelina Jolie at the 2012 Oscars.
