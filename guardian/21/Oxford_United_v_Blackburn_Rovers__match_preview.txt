Blackburn are on a poor run in the Championship at the moment having not won 
in their past seven games. However, they should still pose more of a threat to 
Oxford Utd than Swansea City did in the previous round. Michael Appleton will 
be keen to show his former employers, of just 67 days, that Oxford can upset 
the odds once again in this year’sFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup>. And they look well placed to do 
so. Appleton’s side are strong contenders for promotion to League One with 
Kemar Roofe’s performances being a particular highlight.Graham Searles

Match pointers

lost 4-2 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge after a replay. Blackburn have lost just 
two of their last 21 FA Cup games against lower league sides.
