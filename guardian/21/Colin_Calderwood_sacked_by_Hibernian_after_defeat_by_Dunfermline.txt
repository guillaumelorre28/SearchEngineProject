Hibernian have sacked Colin Calderwood as manager. The 46-year-old former 
Scotland international had been in charge at Easter Road for 13 months but a 
poor run, culminating in a 1-0 home defeat againstDunfermline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/dunfermline> on Saturday, triggered the 
decision.

Calderwood, who joined Hibs on a three-year contract in October 2010, played 
for Swindon, Tottenham, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest. As well as managing 
Northampton and Forest, he was also Chris Hughton's No2 at Newcastle United.

He managed 12 wins in his 49 matches in charge at Hibs and in the summer was 
reported to be of interest to Birmingham City and Forest, who were both looking 
for an assistant manager.

After the Dunfermline defeat, which left the club third bottom of the Scottish 
Premier League, a group of supporters protested outside the main entrance 
demanding the departure of Calderwood and the chairman, Rod Petrie.

A club statement read: "Hibernian FC announced today that the board of 
directors have relieved Colin Calderwood of his duties as manager of the club."

Petrie said: "I would like to thank Colin for his time as manager. The board 
decided that it was in the club's best interests to find a new manager to take
Hibernian <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hibernian> forward."
