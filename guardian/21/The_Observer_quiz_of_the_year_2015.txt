Madrid?

12 The Pope called on world leaders to prevent deaths from migrants driven to 
desperate crossings of the Mediterranean, saying: “They are men and women like

 Put your hands together: what does this emoji mean? 
13 Many thought that this image was a “praying” emoji (left), when it’s 
actually what?
