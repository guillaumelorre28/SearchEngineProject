Matt Wilde’s article on housing (Our immoral housing policy is set up to 
punish the poor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/immoral-housing-policy-punish-poor-councils-poverty-people-losing-homes>
, 26 September) was heartbreaking. I was truly shocked to hear how easy it is 
to put someone out on the streets in this rich country, in this day and age. 
Can someone please make an updated version ofCathy Come Home 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Come_Home>? And can you please ensure that 
all our party leaders receive copies of the article?

• Good to hear about the amount of time and money spent on authenticating the 
colour of Queen Victoria’s eyes in the ITV drama (How producer’s eye for detail 
cost Victoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/27/victoria-producer-lifts-lid-on-making-queen-eyes-historically-accurate>
, 27 September). Just a pity a fraction of it wasn’t spent on Chartism, the 
depiction of which was risible.

• It’s many years since I went to Wales (I’m 83), but as far as I remember the 
only signs in English were “Bed & Breakfast” (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/kea-simply-takes-its-share-of-natures-bounty>
, 27 September). By the way, in commemorating 50 years of the first Severn 
Bridge it should be remembered that both ends are in England – it’s the Wye 
Bridge that connects England and Wales.

• Please could you ask Ken Swinswood which dictionary he got for his birthday (
Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/25/sherlock-holmes-with-a-sting-in-the-tale>
, 26 September)? We’ve looked for “flava” in Chambers, Merriam-Webster and the 
complete Oxford English Dictionary, without success. Got a hit with Wiktionary 
(with yellow), but only in Esperanto and Ido. We feel unprepared for your next 
crossword.

• Rachel Twiselton declares that the only thing wrong with Radio 3 is all the 
talking (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/26/radio-3-and-the-musical-museum-mindset>
, 27 September). I hope this includes the “bird talking” each Sunday morning. 
If I want music, I turn on Radio 3; if I want birdsong I open the window.
