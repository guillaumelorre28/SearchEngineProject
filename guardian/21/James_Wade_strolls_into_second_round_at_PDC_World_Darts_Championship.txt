The sixth seed shrugged off losing the first leg of each set to produce 
finishes of 84, 120 and 62 on the penultimate night of first-round action at 
Alexandra Palace.

The eighth seed, Mensur Suljovic, eased past Ron Meulenkamp 3-0, after his 
Dutch opponent spurned a 2-0 lead in the first set.

Robert Thornton had few problems dispatching Zoran Lerchbacher 3-0 once he hit 
stride, the ninth seed easing through.

Two 180s secured a tight first set 3-2, before back-to-back 68 checkouts 
secured the second. A 63 checkout secured the third and final set, and 
Thorntonâ€™s safe passage.
