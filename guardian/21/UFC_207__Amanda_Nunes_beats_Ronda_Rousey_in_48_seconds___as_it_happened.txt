Strong statement from Nunes about her place as a female champion. She says 
people should forgetRonda Rousey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey>. What happens if they do? Will 
fans follow Nunes and others, or was Rousey’s draw so prolific that her 
destruction means hard times ahead for the women?

Amanda Nunes: 'No one is taking this belt from me'

“I love that because I can show this up. I stop it like that. When I asked for 
this fight I know everything. I prepare in my mind, my spirit and body for this 
moment. I know Ronda Rousey is bigger. I know they loveRonda Rousey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey>. But no one is taking this

The crowd turns as Amanda Nunes walks to the cage. There are plenty of people 
who want to see Rousey fall on her face again, but the former champion will 
reclaim so many of her supporters if she finds vindication.

“Rowdy” Ronda is next. She could easily blow through Amanda Nunes. Or get 
blown away. That’s so much of the intrigue of this fight. Sequestering herself 
the way she did over the last year raised so many questions about Rousey. They 
all get answered after this ring walk—her first as a challenger in theUFC

Garbrandt said all he knows is fighting. He thrives in these moments. Unbeaten 
at 11-0. And he just called out TJ Dillashaw in the most promotable way.

 From beginning to the end, Garbrandt was excellent. His speed and movement 
were good, but the most impressive part was how slick he moved. And against 
Dominick Cruz. Tremendous.

That’s it! Round five goes to Cruz, 10-9, but the fight should belong to 
Garbrandt. Guardian scores it 48-46 for Garbrandt.

Right hand followed by a left hook from Cruz. Solid punches. Jumping knee from 
Cruz just missed. Cruz hits a glancing low kick and Garbrandt mocks him by 
dropping for a pushup.

Two minutes remaining. Garbrandt seems content to ride this out. Cruz pushes 
forward, misses on a heavy combination, and they scramble back to the feet.

Cruz’s corner is asking their fighter to let it all ride. They know a decision 
is unlikely. They mix it up and Cruz lands a right hand. Garbrandt has laughed 
off most of Cruz’s offense.

Garbrandt takes a left hand to the chin. Hasn’t needed to most of the night. 
Then he drops Cruz, who is reeling. Garbrandt is knocking Cruz around the 
octagon.

Left hand to the chin by Cruz, who seems to be seeing well despite an ugly 
gash above his left eye.

Straight right from Garbrandt scores. Midway through the fourth, the 
challenger is dancing. Like, literally. Garbrandt dodged a series of Cruz 
punches, then started popping and locking. Cocky Cody.

Round four: Cruz v Garbrandt

Cruz has been a tremendous champion, especially later in fights. He has to put 
together a solid five minutes here.

Cruz gets dropped by a heavy punch. Garbrandt pointed at him instead of going 
for a kill and Cruz rose to land a big shot of his own.

High kick and a right hand by Cruz gets Garbrandt to pump out a combination 
that scores. Cruz swings and misses big with an overhand right, then moments 
later Garbrandt catches him. The champ went to the ground and popped up.

Cruz unleashed a four-punch combination that didn’t do much to Garbrandt.

Cruz moved forward and landed several punches in the final minute but the 
third goes to Garbrandt. He’s ahead 29-28.

Round three: Cruz v Garbrandt

Heavy shots to start the third. They went after each other on takedowns and 
Garbrandt slammed punches into Cruz that wobbled the champion. A headbutt 
during the wild exchange opened up a cut on Cruz. He’s laboring. Garbrandt 
isn’t over anxious. He’s picking his moments.

Cruz looks like he’s getting a rhythm, but he’s firing from a bit too outside 
so not much effective offense. Garbrandt hasn’t done much of note until a 
overhand right and left hook score for the challenger with two minutes to go.

Garbrandt scores with two nice kicks, then takes a chopping one to the top of 
his left knee.

Big sequence at the end of the round. Cruz put together a chain of takedowns 
that got Garbrandt off balance, they swung and both scored. Good action.19-19.

Sneaky takedown by Garbrandt: great timing from him that may sway the judges. 
Cruz stood after a scramble. This is an even fight as Garbrandt takes it 10-9.

Midway through the opening round and Cruz-Garbrandt is shaping up to be highly 
intriguing.

Garbrandt is talking to Cruz. He scored a heavy low kick and gave the champion 
an earful. Cruz ducks under a winging challenger and hit a double-leg, but 
there was too much momentum and they rolled through it. Back to standing. 
Strong right hook by Cruz stood up Garbrandt. Solid punch.

Garbrandt is moving well. He stepped forward and landed a right hand. Low kick

Round one: Cruz v Garbrandt

No touch of the gloves. Some jawing during final instructions. Here we go, UFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 135lb title on the line.

Cruz retreats and moves away, then lands a one-two on the challenger. Already 
the motion from Cruz is fixating.

Cruz-Garbrandt sets up as another bull-matador contest. Since promotion began 
forUFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 207, Cruz went after Garbrandt 
in a war of words the young challenger couldn’t keep up with. If talk 
translates to emotion and anger then Cruz will have accomplished what he hoped. 
Cruz is one of the brightest and best defensive fighters in game, and Garbrandt 
will have to find a way to score against a master of range and timing. The more 
traditional Garbrandt throws clean punches and can generate power in small 
spaces. If he begins to reach Cruz can pick him off with counters, and there’s 
always the champion’s underrated wrestling game that comes into play. Fun fight 
ahead.

Dillashaw got animated as he spoke post-fight. Speaking about the main event, 
he said he favored Cruz instead of his old teammate Cody Garbrandt.

a 10-8, it seems.

Another level performance from TJ Dillashaw. Speed. Movement. Tactics. The 
former champion outlasted Lineker’s basic game plan to score what should be a

Dillashaw put it on Linker in round 2. Again his grappling was the big 
difference. Beautifully timed takedowns gave Lineker no shot of defending, and 
he spent much of the period on the bottom eating punches and elbows. 20-18 
Dillashaw. Gonna take something amazing for Lineker to turn this around.

10-9 TJ Dillashaw. The opening stanza to what should be a fight that delivers. 
The last minute inspired some emotion from both men, as they slung punches in 
close quarters. Dillashaw spent a solid 90 seconds on top of Lineker after a 
strong double-leg.

UFC 207 needs a jolt. Dillashaw-Lineker – fighters who love going for a finish 
– should do it.

Well, that turned out to be fairly dull. Kim continued to walk forward, but he 
couldn’t create any meaningful offense against a strong defensive fighter. 
Judges split for the South Korean, scoring two 29-28s for him while Saffiedine 
pulled out a 30-27 card.

Kim’s pressure paid off in the second. The South Korean walked down Saffiedine 
for five minutes. Neither fighter connected on anything damaging, and the crowd 
boos as the fighters walk to their corners. Saffiedine either has two rounds in 
the books, or the fight is even headed to the third. That’s how I have it: 
19-19.

Good opening round from Saffiedine. He met Kim’s pressure, used superior 
footwork and created angles to counter. Meanwhile Kim swung and missed too much.

Welterweights Dong Hyun Kim and Tarec Saffiedine are up next. Saffiedine needs 
a win in this spot, otherwise the former Strikeforce champion will have dropped 
three of his five contests inside the Octagon since 2014. Kim should press the 
action against the tactical Belgian.

Judges see it 30-27, 30-26, 30-26 for Ray Borg. Too bad about his missed 
weight issue. Borg said he isn’t sure if he broke his right ankle but he 
couldn’t plant on it.

Well, if Borg’s ankle is broken, he didn’t show it. Lopsided 15 minutes in 
favor of Ray Borg, who landed five takedowns and flirted with an assortment of 
submissions. Smolka was out of this one from the start.

After two rounds, it’s all Borg. Bad news for him, however. He told his corner 
he broke an ankle. Seems jovial as he can be and continues to put pressure on 
both legs though.

When a fighter like Borg misses weight the only penalty as it stands today is 
monetary. So, Smolka receives 30% of Borg’s purse, but is that punitive enough? 
While chances are slim it ever happens, maybe regulators should consider missed 
weight an automatic point deduction for the fight. With the Unified Rules ofMMA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mma> changing at the start of 2017, I mean, 
why not?

Scrambles aplenty in the opening round, which goes to Borg 10-9. Smolka is 
bleeding from a cut near his right eye, and was on the defensive against Borg’s 
submission intensive grappling.

The first of three non-title main card fights is set to begin. A scheduled 
flyweight contest between two exciting prospects was made a catch-weight bout 
when Ray Borg (9-2) missed the division limit by three pounds. Originally 
booked for an non-PPV spot on the card, Borg’s match with Louis Smolka (11-2) 
bumped up after the Nevada Athletic Commission pulled heavyweight Cain 
Velasquez from the card due to medical concerns. Both men enter the Octagon off 
a loss.

Hello and welcome

It’s been 13 months since former UFC bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey> went from invincible to 
inconsolable. Mixed martial arts is better off with Rousey, that much is 
certain, yet as she sat out most of 2016, estranged from the sport that made 
her a household name, an otherwise banner year in cage-fighting unfolded 
without her.

Rousey intends to remind the MMA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mma> world 
what kind of competitor she is when she challenges Brazilian Amanda Nunes for 
the right to call herself champion again. That wouldn’t have been an easy task 
when Rousey was at her peak. Now?In some ways Rousey seems permanently dented 
after Holly Holm unloaded a high kick on the blonde Californian’s head. Her 
goal against Nunes (13-4) on Friday, beyond simply winning, must be to show 
that she is not damaged.

There is an enormous opportunity for Rousey (12-1) to earn redemption, and 
what a story that would be. It is the best case scenario for the fighter and 
her promoter, which gave in to demands that allowed Rousey (and Nunes) to skip 
any traditional pre-fight media obligations. But there also exists enormous 
potential for Rousey to fall on her face again, and that would make for a hell 
of a story too.

Joining the 135lb women, bantamweights Dominick Cruz and Cody Garbrandt will 
be featured in what should be a lively and emotion-fueled co-main event. Cruz 
(22-1) and Garbrandt (10-0) have picked up the promotional slack left by 
Rousey’s absence, and their rivalry has been a central focus of the hype ahead 
of Friday’s card at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey> we’ll see on Friday night: 

Nunes isn’t the only one wondering what’s up with Rousey after one of the most 
influential figures in theUFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> erected a 
wall around herself during a mostly self-imposed 13-month hiatus.

It certainly comes across as strange behavior when an elite fighter, a star,

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/15/holly-holm-stuns-ronda-rousey-for-ufc-womens-bantamweight-title>
. When Rousey finally declared that it was time to fight again, it came with a 
concession from UFC president Dana White that the vast majority of her 
promotional duties for UFC 207, including fight week’s traditional photo ops 
like open workouts and press conferences, were optional.

Rousey claimed they would distract from her goal of winning back the belt, and 
this is where the picture gets muddled for Nunes, who views Rousey’s actions as 
confusing and potentially telling. An overdose on media obligations played a 
part in the loss to Holm, Rousey said, and because she believed some members of 
theMMA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mma> media had been unfair to her in 
the wake of that performance she decided against talking to anyone this time 
around. That could be why she’s skipping questions. Or it could be another

Well, how about that. That was awesome from Nunes. Rousey just didn’t show 
We’re going to wrap up the blog here, but we’ll have much more post-match 
analysis on the site. Thanks for reading. Goodnight.
 
Strong statement from Nunes about her place as a female champion. She says 
people should forgetRonda Rousey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey>. What happens if they do? Will 
fans follow Nunes and others, or was Rousey’s draw so prolific that her 
destruction means hard times ahead for the women?

“I love that because I can show this up. I stop it like that. When I asked for 
this fight I know everything. I prepare in my mind, my spirit and body for this 
moment. I know Ronda Rousey is bigger. I know they loveRonda Rousey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey>. But no one is taking this 
belt from me.”
 
Nunes is watching a replay of her fight. “This is amazing. Before I walk out, 
we talked because this moment is my moment. She had her time. She did a lot for 
this sport. Thank youRonda Rousey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey> … I’m the champion, the Lion!”

Official time of the fight: 0:48 R1. 

 
It was right hand after right hand. Nunes obliterated Rousey, who showed zero 
defense. Showed zero offense. She didn’t show.

They take the center of the cage and Nunes pops off a jab. She just scored 
again. Rousey’s head popped again.
 
The crowd turns as Amanda Nunes walks to the cage. There are plenty of people 
who want to see Rousey fall on her face again, but the former champion will 
reclaim so many of her supporters if she finds vindication.
 
Madness. Ronda Rousey <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey> has 
entered T-Mobile Arena. She looks determined as ever, and on the scale Thursday 
appeared to be in sublime shape.

“Rowdy” Ronda is next. She could easily blow through Amanda Nunes. Or get 
blown away. That’s so much of the intrigue of this fight. Sequestering herself 
the way she did over the last year raised so many questions about Rousey. They 
all get answered after this ring walk—her first as a challenger in theUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc>.

Garbrandt said all he knows is fighting. He thrives in these moments. Unbeaten 
at 11-0. And he just called out TJ Dillashaw in the most promotable way.
 
 From beginning to the end, Garbrandt was excellent. His speed and movement 
were good, but the most impressive part was how slick he moved. And against 
Dominick Cruz. Tremendous.
 
Judges: 48-46, 48-47, 48-46 … and new UFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> bantamweight champion, Cody Garbrandt.

That’s it! Round five goes to Cruz, 10-9, but the fight should belong to 
Garbrandt. Guardian scores it 48-46 for Garbrandt.

dropping for a pushup.

Two minutes remaining. Garbrandt seems content to ride this out. Cruz pushes 
forward, misses on a heavy combination, and they scramble back to the feet.
 
Cruz’s corner is asking their fighter to let it all ride. They know a decision 
is unlikely. They mix it up and Cruz lands a right hand. Garbrandt has laughed 
off most of Cruz’s offense.

Cruz will need a stoppage.

gash above his left eye.

Straight right from Garbrandt scores. Midway through the fourth, the 
challenger is dancing. Like, literally. Garbrandt dodged a series of Cruz 
punches, then started popping and locking. Cocky Cody.
 
Cruz has been a tremendous champion, especially later in fights. He has to put 
together a solid five minutes here.

Cruz gets dropped by a heavy punch. Garbrandt pointed at him instead of going 
for a kill and Cruz rose to land a big shot of his own.
 
High kick and a right hand by Cruz gets Garbrandt to pump out a combination 
that scores. Cruz swings and misses big with an overhand right, then moments 
later Garbrandt catches him. The champ went to the ground and popped up.

Cruz unleashed a four-punch combination that didn’t do much to Garbrandt.

Cruz moved forward and landed several punches in the final minute but the 
third goes to Garbrandt. He’s ahead 29-28.
 
Heavy shots to start the third. They went after each other on takedowns and 
Garbrandt slammed punches into Cruz that wobbled the champion. A headbutt 
during the wild exchange opened up a cut on Cruz. He’s laboring. Garbrandt 
isn’t over anxious. He’s picking his moments.
 
Cruz looks like he’s getting a rhythm, but he’s firing from a bit too outside 
so not much effective offense. Garbrandt hasn’t done much of note until a 
overhand right and left hook score for the challenger with two minutes to go.

Garbrandt scores with two nice kicks, then takes a chopping one to the top of 
his left knee.

Big sequence at the end of the round. Cruz put together a chain of takedowns 
that got Garbrandt off balance, they swung and both scored. Good action.19-19.
 
Combination from Cruz opens the action in the second. A left hook from 
Garbrandt scored but it didn’t hurt the champ, who pushed forward and cracked 
Garbrandt in an exchange.
 
Sneaky takedown by Garbrandt: great timing from him that may sway the judges. 
Cruz stood after a scramble. This is an even fight as Garbrandt takes it 10-9.
 
Midway through the opening round and Cruz-Garbrandt is shaping up to be highly 
intriguing.

Garbrandt is talking to Cruz. He scored a heavy low kick and gave the champion 
an earful. Cruz ducks under a winging challenger and hit a double-leg, but 
there was too much momentum and they rolled through it. Back to standing. 
Strong right hook by Cruz stood up Garbrandt. Solid punch.

Garbrandt is moving well. He stepped forward and landed a right hand. Low kick 
by Cruz and Garbrandt just misses on a counter right.
 
No touch of the gloves. Some jawing during final instructions. Here we go, UFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 135lb title on the line.

Cruz retreats and moves away, then lands a one-two on the challenger. Already 
the motion from Cruz is fixating.
 
The matador has a serious scowl going.
 
Cruz-Garbrandt sets up as another bull-matador contest. Since promotion began 
forUFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 207, Cruz went after Garbrandt 
in a war of words the young challenger couldn’t keep up with. If talk 
translates to emotion and anger then Cruz will have accomplished what he hoped. 
Cruz is one of the brightest and best defensive fighters in game, and Garbrandt 
will have to find a way to score against a master of range and timing. The more 
traditional Garbrandt throws clean punches and can generate power in small 
spaces. If he begins to reach Cruz can pick him off with counters, and there’s 
always the champion’s underrated wrestling game that comes into play. Fun fight 
ahead.
 
Dillashaw got animated as he spoke post-fight. Speaking about the main event, 
he said he favored Cruz instead of his old teammate Cody Garbrandt.
 
All three judges see it 30-26 for Dillashaw. They like that second period for 
a 10-8, it seems.
 
Another level performance from TJ Dillashaw. Speed. Movement. Tactics. The 
former champion outlasted Lineker’s basic game plan to score what should be a 
unanimous decision.

Christian Petersen/Getty Images  
Dillashaw put it on Linker in round 2. Again his grappling was the big 
difference. Beautifully timed takedowns gave Lineker no shot of defending, and 
he spent much of the period on the bottom eating punches and elbows. 20-18 
Dillashaw. Gonna take something amazing for Lineker to turn this around.
 Dillashaw-Lineker. Photograph: Christian Petersen/Getty Images  
10-9 TJ Dillashaw. The opening stanza to what should be a fight that delivers. 
The last minute inspired some emotion from both men, as they slung punches in 
close quarters. Dillashaw spent a solid 90 seconds on top of Lineker after a 
strong double-leg.
 
UFC 207 needs a jolt. Dillashaw-Lineker – fighters who love going for a finish 
– should do it.
 
Business picks up as the three remaining bouts on UFC 207 take place at 135lbs
. First up, a pivotal contest between former champion TJ Dillashaw and the 
pound-for-pound heaviest hitter in theUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc>, John Lineker.
 
Well, that turned out to be fairly dull. Kim continued to walk forward, but he 
couldn’t create any meaningful offense against a strong defensive fighter. 
Judges split for the South Korean, scoring two 29-28s for him while Saffiedine 
pulled out a 30-27 card.

Kim’s pressure paid off in the second. The South Korean walked down Saffiedine 
for five minutes. Neither fighter connected on anything damaging, and the crowd 
boos as the fighters walk to their corners. Saffiedine either has two rounds in 
the books, or the fight is even headed to the third. That’s how I have it: 
19-19.
 
Good opening round from Saffiedine. He met Kim’s pressure, used superior 
footwork and created angles to counter. Meanwhile Kim swung and missed too much.

Welterweights Dong Hyun Kim and Tarec Saffiedine are up next. Saffiedine needs 
a win in this spot, otherwise the former Strikeforce champion will have dropped 
three of his five contests inside the Octagon since 2014. Kim should press the 
action against the tactical Belgian.
 
Judges see it 30-27, 30-26, 30-26 for Ray Borg. Too bad about his missed 
weight issue. Borg said he isn’t sure if he broke his right ankle but he 
couldn’t plant on it.
 Ray Borg: victorious. Photograph: Christian Petersen/Getty Images  
Well, if Borg’s ankle is broken, he didn’t show it. Lopsided 15 minutes in 
favor of Ray Borg, who landed five takedowns and flirted with an assortment of 
submissions. Smolka was out of this one from the start.
 
After two rounds, it’s all Borg. Bad news for him, however. He told his corner 
he broke an ankle. Seems jovial as he can be and continues to put pressure on 
both legs though.

Bottari/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images  
When a fighter like Borg misses weight the only penalty as it stands today is 
monetary. So, Smolka receives 30% of Borg’s purse, but is that punitive enough? 
While chances are slim it ever happens, maybe regulators should consider missed 
weight an automatic point deduction for the fight. With the Unified Rules ofMMA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mma> changing at the start of 2017, I mean, 
why not?
 
Scrambles aplenty in the opening round, which goes to Borg 10-9. Smolka is 
bleeding from a cut near his right eye, and was on the defensive against Borg’s 
submission intensive grappling.
 
The first of three non-title main card fights is set to begin. A scheduled 
flyweight contest between two exciting prospects was made a catch-weight bout 
when Ray Borg (9-2) missed the division limit by three pounds. Originally 
booked for an non-PPV spot on the card, Borg’s match with Louis Smolka (11-2) 
bumped up after the Nevada Athletic Commission pulled heavyweight Cain 
Velasquez from the card due to medical concerns. Both men enter the Octagon off 
a loss.

It’s been 13 months since former UFC bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey> went from invincible to 
inconsolable. Mixed martial arts is better off with Rousey, that much is 
certain, yet as she sat out most of 2016, estranged from the sport that made 
her a household name, an otherwise banner year in cage-fighting unfolded 
without her.

Rousey intends to remind the MMA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mma> world 
what kind of competitor she is when she challenges Brazilian Amanda Nunes for 
the right to call herself champion again. That wouldn’t have been an easy task 
when Rousey was at her peak. Now?In some ways Rousey seems permanently dented 
after Holly Holm unloaded a high kick on the blonde Californian’s head. Her 
goal against Nunes (13-4) on Friday, beyond simply winning, must be to show 
that she is not damaged.

There is an enormous opportunity for Rousey (12-1) to earn redemption, and 
what a story that would be. It is the best case scenario for the fighter and 
her promoter, which gave in to demands that allowed Rousey (and Nunes) to skip 
any traditional pre-fight media obligations. But there also exists enormous 
potential for Rousey to fall on her face again, and that would make for a hell 
of a story too.

Joining the 135lb women, bantamweights Dominick Cruz and Cody Garbrandt will 
be featured in what should be a lively and emotion-fueled co-main event. Cruz 
(22-1) and Garbrandt (10-0) have picked up the promotional slack left by 
Rousey’s absence, and their rivalry has been a central focus of the hype ahead 
of Friday’s card at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
 
Josh will be here shortly. In the meantime, read about which Ronda Rousey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ronda-rousey> we’ll see on Friday night:
