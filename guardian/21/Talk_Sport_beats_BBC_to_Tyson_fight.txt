Kelvin MacKenzie's all-sport radio station Talk Sport has paid a six-figure 
sum to beat its BBC rival, 5 Live, to the rights to broadcast Mike Tyson's 
fight in Manchester this weekend.

Both stations are known to have negotiated in advance with Tyson's promoter, 
Frank Warren, to broadcast the fight against the British heavyweight Julius 
Francis. But last night it emerged that Talk had secured the rights.

The fight is the first big event to have been up for grabs since Talk Radio's 
relaunch as an all-sport network this month.

Mr MacKenzie said: "For us it's a very big moment. This will be one of the 
biggest fights in recent history, and I'm delighted we've got it."

He declared that he was unaware of the BBC's bid, adding: "They're not really 
interested in boxing are they?"

A BBC spokeswoman played down Radio 5 Live's loss and emphasised the widely 
held view that it will not be a long bout.

She said: "Radio 5 Live made a fair and reasonable offer which sought to 
balance interest in a main title fight which might only last a few minutes 
against value for licence payers' money."

The difference between the two bids is thought to have been around £25,000. 

A BBC insider said 5 Live "just couldn't go any higher". 

Talk Sport is 20% owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose Sky television will screen 
the live pay-per-view coverage of the fight.

Despite his substantial backers, Mr MacKenzie has been anxious not to 
overstate Talk's powers to poach sports rights from the BBC.

He bought the five-year-old station last year, and he has been campaigning 
ever since against what he describes as the BBC's monopoly on sports rights.

He has confirmed, however, that he will bid against 5 Live for its greatest 
asset, the £5m deal to broadcast Premier League football, which runs out in 
2001.
