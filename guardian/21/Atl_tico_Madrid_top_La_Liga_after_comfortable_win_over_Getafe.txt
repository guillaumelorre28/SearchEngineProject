Atlético Madrid’s in-form striker Antoine Griezmann struck twice to earn a 
comfortable 2-0 derby victory over their toothless visitors,Getafe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/getafe>, that took his side top of La 
Liga.

The France striker, who is developing into a talisman for Atlético, scored at 
the start of the first half and at the end of the second after a competent 
display by the home side.

Atlético have 12 points from five games having only dropped points against 
Barcelona, who have a 100% record from four games so far and face Celta Vigo 
away on Wednesday when Real Madrid, with 10 points from four matches, visit 
Athletic Bilbao.

Atlético controlled the game, having started by pinning Getafe back, but they 
eased off for long spells against a side incapable of putting them under 
sustained pressure. Griezmann scored after four minutes with a volley from six 
metres and wrapped up the win with another close-range finish from a Jackson 
Martínez pass in the final minute.

Valencia’s dismal start to the season continued as they lost 1-0 at Espanyol, 
with Víctor Álvarez scoring in the first half. They are eighth with six points 
after one win and three draws.

There was better news for Real Sociedad, whose 3-0 win at Granada may have 
relieved some of the early-season pressure on their manager,David Moyes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-moyes>. It was their first win of 
the season and came five days before Sunday’s derby against Athletic Bilbao.
