to working with David,” the manager, Darren Kelly, told the club’s website.

“David is a very experienced player and he will be a great addition to our 
existing squad. He has Premier League class and his experience will be vital to 
the younger players in our dressing room.”

Dunn, 35, has played more than 250 games in the Premier League for Blackburn 
and Birmingham.
