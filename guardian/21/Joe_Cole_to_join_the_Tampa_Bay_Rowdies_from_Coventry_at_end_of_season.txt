The former England international Joe Cole 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/joe-cole> said he is looking forward to a 
new challenge after signing for the Tampa Bay Rowdies.

The 34-year-old, who joined Coventry on a free transfer from Aston Villa in 
January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/07/joe-cole-free-transfer-coventry-city-aston-villa-tony-mowbray>
, will join the club in the North American Soccer League – a level below Major 
League Soccer (MLS) – when his contract expires in the summer.

“I’ve always envisaged playing in the United States at some point in my life,” 
said Cole.

“My family and I came out to visit a few months ago and everyone was lovely. 
They really made us feel welcomed.

“I’m really excited. My desire to win football matches is still there. I’m not 
coming for an extended holiday.”

Coventry manager Tony Mowbray added: “I would have liked to have kept Joe who 
I think has proven his fitness and worth to the team. He’s a fantastic 
character around our building – no airs and graces, not looking for favours or 
extra days off. He’s a top guy and he has shown his football ability.”

Cole joined Coventry initially on loan in October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/19/joe-cole-coventry-city-money-aston-villa>
 and has made 22 appearances, scoring twice, for the League One club. He also 
won the FA Cup three times during his eight-year spell at Chelsea after 
starting his career at West Ham United and made 56 appearances for England.
