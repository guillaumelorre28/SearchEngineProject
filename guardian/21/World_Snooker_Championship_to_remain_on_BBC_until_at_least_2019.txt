Barbara Slater, the BBC Sport director, said: “We know there will be millions 
of snooker fans across the country celebrating the fact they can continue to 
watch world-class snooker on free-to-air television.”

Barry Hearn, chairman of World Snooker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/snooker>, said: “We’ve agreed a new two-year 
extension with the BBC. We’re now guaranteed on air until 2019 and I fancy 
quite a few more years after that.”

The BBC has broadcast the world championship every year since its move to the 
Crucible in 1977.

Hearn said: “Our agreement with the BBC is one of the cornerstones of our 
sport and we are delighted to extend it for an extra two years.

“These three major tournaments are much loved by the public, they are part of 
the fabric of British sport.

“The BBC’s coverage of the world championship last year alone was watched by 
over 15 million people, proving how popular our sport is.

“Our Triple Crown tournaments are three of the high points of the sporting 
calendar so fans will be thrilled that they will remain on terrestrial 
television.”
