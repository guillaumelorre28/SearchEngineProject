We seem, nowadays, to have forgotten what a “proper” winter is like. A series 
of mild seasons, punctuated only by the freeze-ups of 2009-10 and 2010-11, have 
perhaps made us complacent.

But for Europe’s birds, cold winters need to be taken far more seriously. 
Almost 30 years ago the winter of 1978-79 led to a big influx of ducks and 
other waterbirds from the continent.

At the end of December 1978 a deep low-pressure system headed eastwards along 
the Channel, bringing heavy snow across parts of south-east England.

Across the North Sea, on the polders of the Netherlands and around the Baltic 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea>, the weather was even worse. This 
was the trigger for thousands of birds to head west, towards Britain.

The first to arrive were flocks of smew, a small duck known as the “white nun” 
for its pallid plumage. Normally fewer than 100 smew overwinter in Britain – 
many on the gravel pits and reservoirs around the M25 roadway – but that year 
almost 400 birds were seen.

They were accompanied by other scarce species, including black-necked, 
red-necked and Slavonian grebes, and red-throated and black-throated divers. 
These were followed by birds of prey, with as many as 750hen harriers 
<https://www.bto.org/national-offices/scotland/our-work/selected-highlights/hen-harrier>
 in England alone, well over twice the usual wintering population. There was 
also an an influx of long-eared and short-eared owls, as well as skylarks.

All these species were fleeing a long spell of below-zero temperatures in 
continentalEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. Though it 
was cold in the UK too, there was still enough ice-free water and available 
food to allow them to survive.
