found guilty on Monday of assaulting a steward with an inflatable shark at a

clash atBarnet <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnet> in February in 
support of a fellow fan who had been ejected from an earlier away game for

“A lot of lads were saying, ‘Come on, let’s get together and support Bryan’ by 
taking as many inflatables as possible to Barnet and that’s what we did, 
because we’ve got a good sense of humour,” Meech said. Grimsby won 3-1 after a 
late winner.

“We were jumping about amongst each other, celebrating, and before I knew it – 
I was shocked really – I was grabbed out by the police and taken away.“

Magistrates at Willesden in north London convicted Meech of common assault 
with a 12-month conditional discharge. He was also ordered to pay the steward 
£100 in compensation.
