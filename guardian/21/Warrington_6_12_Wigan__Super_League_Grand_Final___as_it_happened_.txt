There are tears for Warrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> 
and Gidley sinks to his knees, the sufferer of yet more final heartache. But 
after losing the past two Grand Finals, Wigan are victorious again – for the 
fourth time at this stage. Warrington’s long wait continues. Those in red and 
white shirts are, naturally, overjoyed. That was an excellent spectacle. It 
wasn’t the most high scoring but the intensity and defensive effort from both 
was remarkable. Liam Farrell is given the Harry Sunderland man of the match 
award. Thanks for reading and stay tuned for Aaron Bower’s report from Old 
Trafford.

OK to continue and Wigan are counting down the seconds. It’s theirs to lose.

79 min: Wigan’s defence have produced an amazing series of tackles on the line 
to stop Gidley, Westerman and Ruseell. Smith and Gelling both made massive 
tackles there and, with 47 seconds to go Wigan have a fresh set near their own 
try line.Warrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> look 
heartbroken.

but Tierney is on hand to quickly force him into touch. And Wigan will take 
their time now with this fresh set.

one point they seem to be searching for four, run out of phases and concede

67 min: Smith drills a magnificent kick that crosses the tryline but does not 
go dead, meaning Ratchford must run it. And he’s then tackled 10m from his own 
goal.

TRY! Warrington 6-10 Wigan (Charnley)

63 min: Charnley, on his final appearance for Wigan, has put them in front but 
it’s come from an absolutely beautiful kick from Dan Sarginson, who is also 
departing, into the right corner. Charnley has no problem collecting it and 
touching down. It all came from a Tom Lineham knock-on when fielding a high 
kick that gave Wigan a penalty close to goal. Smith has missed a difficult kick 
to add the extra two points.

TRY! Warrington 6-6 Wigan (Gildart)

55 min: Well, Atkins’ drop has certainly become a turning point because Wigan 
have scored the 100th Grand Final try thanks to a rapid break, finished off by 
Gildart’s first since early August. From the penalty following Atkins’ 
knock-on, they gained steady ground before Liam Farrell broke past Kurt 
Gidley’s limp tackle. Farrell then fed Gildart on his left and the Wigan No4 
touched down close to where Patton scored his try in the first half. But 
Smith’s conversion goes wide to the right and we remain level.

54 min: A huge moment and a possible turning point if Wigan can be kicked into 
gear. Atkins crosses over, the referee’s decision is to give the try but he 
goes to the video ref. And the decision is overturned. Replays show the ball 
popped out of Atkins’ grasp, with Gelling, Smith, Flower Sarginson and Charnley 
all tackling him.

53 min: Warrington’s Chris Sandow has come in for Daryl Clark, who is hobbling 
off. And Sandow’s first act is to send a kick towards Charnley. The Wigan 
player drops it and then Gelling tries to pick up the loose ball but knocks it 
on. Oh no, that is a mess.Warrington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> have a scrum on the 40m and have 
some momentum. There is a lot of time to go but would a second try kill off 
Wigan? They are growing increasingly sloppy.

50 min: This is quite scrappy now but the Wolves remain defensively 
formidable. Wigan are trying their best to find a hole but each time they kick, 
Ratchford and Lineham appear to be getting to the ball first.

45 min: Patton sends a sublime kick towards the left corner. Charnley collects 
it but falls and is quickly smothered. They need three tackles to get to 
halfway and after that fail to make much more ground. Smith’s high kick is well 
gathered by Lineham.

42 min: To borrow a Stevo phrase, the second stanza has started a tad more 
calm than the first. But Patton kicks a beauty to touch. Wigan will have the 
put in about 25m from their own goal.

Phew, time to catch our breath: and we definitely need it. There may have only 
been one try but there’s been a plethora of talking points and, on the whole, 
some gripping rugby on show.

Warrington have grown into the game well after Wigan’s early dominance – and 
conversely, the Warriors look increasingly lost in the final third. To make 
matters worse, Ben Flower looked in some discomfort when coming off the field 
andWarrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> still have a Chris 
Sandow-shaped ace up their sleeve sat on the bench.


Credit to the referee, Robert Hicks, too, who, despite being involved in the 
most bizarre play of the half close to the interval, has let the game flow 
well. As a result it’s been breathless and it’s been frantic: just how the 
Grand Final, and rugby league as a whole, should be.


More of the same in the next 40, lads. So far, it’s been a game befitting of 
the grand stage Old Trafford provides.

33 min: Wigan are enjoying a short spell of territorial advantage now but they 
cannot find a way through Warrington’s impressive defence. Wigan have gained 
614m to Warrington’s 588m, but what does that matter when it is the Wire who 
are leading?

30 min: Much better from Wigan with the ball this time as Gidley almost makes 
it through. It’s recycled to Bateman, who has buds up his nostrils to stem the 
flow of blood, but Atkins pinches the ball and races clear. He thinks he is 
through but the referee has blown his whistle for offside. Such is the noise 
inside Old Trafford theWarrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington>
 player cannot hear it though, so play continues for a while before Mr Hicks 
finally blows his whistle loud enough to halt proceeedings.

There are tears for Warrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> 
and Gidley sinks to his knees, the sufferer of yet more final heartache. But 
after losing the past two Grand Finals, Wigan are victorious again – for the 
fourth time at this stage. Warrington’s long wait continues. Those in red and 
white shirts are, naturally, overjoyed. That was an excellent spectacle. It 
wasn’t the most high scoring but the intensity and defensive effort from both 
was remarkable. Liam Farrell is given the Harry Sunderland man of the match 
award. Thanks for reading and stay tuned for Aaron Bower’s report from Old 
Trafford.

79 min: The clock is stopped as Charnley goes down with a head injury. He is 
OK to continue and Wigan are counting down the seconds. It’s theirs to lose.
 
79 min: Wigan’s defence have produced an amazing series of tackles on the line 
to stop Gidley, Westerman and Ruseell. Smith and Gelling both made massive 
tackles there and, with 47 seconds to go Wigan have a fresh set near their own 
try line.Warrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> look 
heartbroken.
 
78 min: Smith kicks to the right but it goes out on the full and Warrington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> have a fresh set beginning at 
halfway. This is their chance, you sense.
 
77 min: Warrington drive forward and Patton’s kick to the right finds Lineham 
but Tierney is on hand to quickly force him into touch. And Wigan will take 
their time now with this fresh set.
 
76 min: Wigan make it as far as Warrington’s 40m but instead of going for the 
one point they seem to be searching for four, run out of phases and concede 
possession.
 
75 min: Wigan have the put in but there’s a break in play as Smith gets some 
attention on his jaw – he was elbowed (accidentally, of course) by Charnley 
when they went to tackle Russell.
 
75 min: From the short kick-off Warrington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> retain possession and Atkins 
pumps his way towards goal. Gidley feeds Sandow who gives it to Evans. He is 
grounded. They come back across to the left but Matty Russell is tackled into 
touch by a combination of Smith, Gelling and Charnley.
 
74 min: Ice cool from Smith, who sends the ball over to increase the advantage 
to six points with six minutes to go.
 
73 min: Wigan have a penalty because the referee believes Daryl Clark has 
unfairly stolen the ball. It’s a contentious one, it does not look like a 
penalty. But Smith is going for the posts …
 
72 min: Russell concedes a drop out after Smith sends a wonderful kick towards 
the right corner.Warrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> are 
struggling to find a way out at the moment.
 
70 min: Gidley now has a horrific head injury with blood pouring after he 
collided with his team-mate Bateman when making a tackle. He’ll need a fresh 
shirt.
 
68 min: Warrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> make some 
ground but Gidley knocks on near halfway. Oh dear, Wigan will have the put in 
and should eat up another minute and, they hope, produce a gap to score what 
would be a decisive score.
 
67 min: Smith drills a magnificent kick that crosses the tryline but does not 
go dead, meaning Ratchford must run it. And he’s then tackled 10m from his own 
goal.
 
65 min: What do Warrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> have 
left in the tank? A converted try will be enough but they have never beaten 
Wigan in a play-off game.
 
63 min: Charnley, on his final appearance for Wigan, has put them in front but 
it’s come from an absolutely beautiful kick from Dan Sarginson, who is also 
departing, into the right corner. Charnley has no problem collecting it and 
touching down. It all came from a Tom Lineham knock-on when fielding a high 
kick that gave Wigan a penalty close to goal. Smith has missed a difficult kick 
to add the extra two points.

60 min: Sandow has been superb since coming on. He’s just dinked a lovely ball 
through. Rhys Evans gets to it but knocks on before crossing the line.
 
59 min: Warrington’s response is good. Sandow sends a tidy chip that Charnley 
collects but Sandow and Gidley force the Wigan man over his own try line for a 
drop out.
 
55 min: Well, Atkins’ drop has certainly become a turning point because Wigan 
have scored the 100th Grand Final try thanks to a rapid break, finished off by 
Gildart’s first since early August. From the penalty following Atkins’ 
knock-on, they gained steady ground before Liam Farrell broke past Kurt 
Gidley’s limp tackle. Farrell then fed Gildart on his left and the Wigan No4 
touched down close to where Patton scored his try in the first half. But 
Smith’s conversion goes wide to the right and we remain level.

54 min: A huge moment and a possible turning point if Wigan can be kicked into 
gear. Atkins crosses over, the referee’s decision is to give the try but he 
goes to the video ref. And the decision is overturned. Replays show the ball 
popped out of Atkins’ grasp, with Gelling, Smith, Flower Sarginson and Charnley 
all tackling him.
 
53 min: Warrington’s Chris Sandow has come in for Daryl Clark, who is hobbling 
off. And Sandow’s first act is to send a kick towards Charnley. The Wigan 
player drops it and then Gelling tries to pick up the loose ball but knocks it 
on. Oh no, that is a mess.Warrington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> have a scrum on the 40m and have 
some momentum. There is a lot of time to go but would a second try kill off 
Wigan? They are growing increasingly sloppy.
 
52 min: Could this be the lowest scoring Grand Final? Two have finished with 
only 14 points – in 1998 and 1999.
 
50 min: This is quite scrappy now but the Wolves remain defensively 
formidable. Wigan are trying their best to find a hole but each time they kick, 
Ratchford and Lineham appear to be getting to the ball first.
 
48 min: Daryl Clark goes down with an injury after making a tough tackle but 
he picks himself up and dusts himself down. He has made 23 tackles in 48 
minutes!
 Clark takes down Tautai, one of 23 tackles so far. Photograph: Alex 
Livesey/Getty Images  
47 min: Warrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> pin Wigan 
back and Patton’s kicking is causing some bother.
 
45 min: Patton sends a sublime kick towards the left corner. Charnley collects 
it but falls and is quickly smothered. They need three tackles to get to 
halfway and after that fail to make much more ground. Smith’s high kick is well 
gathered by Lineham.
 
44 min: A promising move from Wigan’s Tierney, who breaks down the left, but 
on the third tackle Charnley moves andWarrington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> are given a penalty.
 
42 min: To borrow a Stevo phrase, the second stanza has started a tad more 
calm than the first. But Patton kicks a beauty to touch. Wigan will have the 
put in about 25m from their own goal.
 
41 min: Warrington gets us going again, playing towards the Stretford End.
 
Phew, time to catch our breath: and we definitely need it. There may have only 
been one try but there’s been a plethora of talking points and, on the whole, 
some gripping rugby on show.

Warrington have grown into the game well after Wigan’s early dominance – and 
conversely, the Warriors look increasingly lost in the final third. To make 
matters worse, Ben Flower looked in some discomfort when coming off the field 
andWarrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington> still have a Chris 
Sandow-shaped ace up their sleeve sat on the bench.


Credit to the referee, Robert Hicks, too, who, despite being involved in the 
most bizarre play of the half close to the interval, has let the game flow 
well. As a result it’s been breathless and it’s been frantic: just how the 
Grand Final, and rugby league as a whole, should be.


More of the same in the next 40, lads. So far, it’s been a game befitting of 
the grand stage Old Trafford provides.
 
That’s the break. It’s not been high scoring, but it has been fascinating.
 
39 min: Again Wigan search for a hole and Gildart, on the left, gets to within 
5m of a first try but he offloads to Sutton before being tackled. Sutton is 
pressured into a loose pass.
 
35 min: We’re heading for half time but there is finally a pattern to the 
game: Wigan are enjoying better territory but neither team is making much 
ground with the ball in hand. Can either dispatch a spot on kick to force an 
error?
 
33 min: Wigan are enjoying a short spell of territorial advantage now but they 
cannot find a way through Warrington’s impressive defence. Wigan have gained 
614m to Warrington’s 588m, but what does that matter when it is the Wire who 
are leading?
 
32 min: When play restarts with a penalty, Wigan gain precious little 
territory and Westerman claims Smith chip.
 
30 min: Much better from Wigan with the ball this time as Gidley almost makes 
it through. It’s recycled to Bateman, who has buds up his nostrils to stem the 
flow of blood, but Atkins pinches the ball and races clear. He thinks he is 
through but the referee has blown his whistle for offside. Such is the noise 
inside Old Trafford theWarrington <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warrington>
 player cannot hear it though, so play continues for a while before Mr Hicks 
finally blows his whistle loud enough to halt proceeedings.
 
29 min: When play gets going again, Ratchford knocks on after Westerman chucks 
a wild pass at him. Wigan breath a sigh of relief.
