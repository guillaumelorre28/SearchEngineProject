A Kidderminster fan was stabbed twice and another taken to hospital after a 
fight with "local residents" close to Luton Town's ground.

Bedfordshire Police said that the two men were among five busloads of 
Kidderminster supporters. As the coaches queued in traffic about a mile from 
Kenilworth Road an argument broke out between residents and the fans in the 
rear coach.

It happened after the game and the vehicles were leaving Luton on the return 
journey. "It led to the coach being attacked," a police spokesman said. "Then 
some of the supporters got off to remonstrate and a fight ensued."

Two fans are being treated in hospital for non life-threatening injuries, 
although one was stabbed twice.

"Four local men have been arrested and a police presence remains in the area 
where the violence broke out in Dunstable Street near the Mansfield Road 
junction," police said. They added that the attackers did not appear to have 
any connection toLuton Town <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lutontown>.

Kidderminster won the Blue Square Bet Premier match 2-1 to maintain their 
position on top of the table.
