The future of Bradford is expected to be resolved by Friday afternoon, 
according to the Rugby Football League. The former Super League and world club 
champions, entered administration – for the third time in four years –on 
14 November to fight off a winding-up petition

 brought by HM Revenue and Customs and the club have since been the subject of 
up to a dozen expressions of interest.

The joint-administrator, Gary Petitt, has several times put back his own 
deadline for offers for the Championship club and theRFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rfl> has been involved in the latest talks 
with the one remaining bidder.

An RFL spokesman said that members of the governing body’s executive and 
welfare team addressed the Bradford players and staff on Thursday to update 
them on the situation. “The RFL was able to disclose that following positive 
and detailed discussions, an interested consortium is considering bidding for 
theBradford Bulls <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradfordbulls>, and that 
the consortium now has all the information needed to make a decision on whether 
it will make a formal offer for the club,” the spokesman said.

“Despite the fact that the consortium could potentially offer an exciting 
future, the RFL recognises that no deal has yet has been struck. It does, 
however, expect that a decision will be made by tomorrow afternoon.”

It is thought the bid is dependent on the RFL being prepared to sell back the 
leasehold of Bradford’s Odsal Stadium to the new owner.
