“It’s common sense,” said Manny Pacquiao.

 “Do you see animals mating with the same sex? Animals are better because they 
can distinguish male from female. If men mate with men and women mate with 
women they are worse than animals.” Well, it’s not common sense. But his 
intolerant attitude is too common in sport. Pacquiao was not the first athlete 
to air homophobic views this week. TheParis Saint-Germain defender Serge Aurier 
was suspended

 before their match against Chelsea after he called his manager a “faggot” on 
social media.

We are midway through Football v Homophobia 
<http://www.footballvhomophobia.com/> month, but sport seems to be behind the 
times when it comes to accepting people of all sexualities. Last year theOut on 
the Fields <http://www.outonthefields.com/> survey found that 85% of people 
believe an openly gay, lesbian or bisexual person would not be safe in the 
stands at a sporting event. Almost two thirds of respondents polled in the UK 
said homophobia is more common in sport than the rest of society, and six in 10 
gay men said they had experienced homophobia in sport.

The statistics make for sad reading, but we want to hear about your 
experiences of homophobia in sport. If you have been the victim of homophobic 
abuse or have witnessed other people being singled out for their sexuality, 
tell us your story. How did you react and how would you advise others to 
respond to prejudice? And do you have any heartening stories about the way you 
were treated? Thanks for sharing.
