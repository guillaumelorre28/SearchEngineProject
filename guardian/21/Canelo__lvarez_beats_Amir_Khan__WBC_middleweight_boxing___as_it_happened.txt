Final thoughts

A huge knockout for Canelo wins it. Khan had been in the fight early on and 
his speed caused problems for the Mexican but the longer the fight wore on, the 
more Canelo’s body blows told. And they were enough to sap Khan’s strength and 
allow Canelo to land that big right - it was scary enough for Canelo to 
immediately check on his opponent’s health. Khan did not disgrace himself but 
Canelo was simply too strong. It looks like it’s GGG next for Canelo

Khan is - happily - well enough to speak

Question: What now for Canelo? “Canelo needs to step in with GGG. I showed my 
balls, [Canelo] needs to now. I tried my best, I’d like to thank my support.”

Are you going to go down weight? “It was hard to turn down this fight but I 
will probably be going down in weight again.”

Canelo speaks ... and challenges Golovkin

Question: Did Khan’s speed surprise you: “He’s a fast fighter but I knew time 
would come to my favour and you saw that”


What skills did you show in the fight? “Many people talk about my speed but I 
have many more qualities and I think you saw that. I like to surprise everyone”

GGG is here, will you fight him? “Like we say in Mexico, we don’t fuck around. 
I don’t fear anyone.”

Canelo beats Khan by sixth round knockout

Canelo has landed 23 punches to Khan’s four to the body. Khan continues to 
come forward but Canelo is keeping out of his range. A minute into the round, 
Canelo glides forward and lands a brutal combination to Khan’s midriff and then 
goes upstairs to Khan’s head - that hurt the Briton. And then it’s over. Canelo 
lands a huge blow and knocks out Khan on his feet. Khan is out cold and Canelo 
looks concerned for his opponent but - to the relief of everyone – Khan slowly 
rises. It was a HUGE right from Canelo to the side of Khan face and the Briton 
was out before he landed on the canvas. It was big enough for Canelo to 
immediately goes to his knees to check his opponent was OK.

Fifth round

A hard left from Canelo early in the round, and Khan’s legs wobble ever so 
slightly. This has been a magnificent fight so far, both men fighting near 
their best - Khan is exceeding expectations. Canelo continues to land bombs on 
Khan’s body but the Briton is doing good work to Canelo’s head.

Guardian’s unofficial scorecard: Canelo 10-9 Khan (Canelo 47-48 Khan)

Fourth round

Canelo closes in on his opponent and lands his best blow of the fight a big 
right to the body. But Khan’s hand speed is still causing Canelo problems. 
Canelo is still taking some wild punches that Khan is avoiding with ease. But 
he countered Khan well in that round and gave him very little space.

Guardian’s unofficial scorecard: Canelo 10-9 Khan (Canelo 37-39 Khan)

Third round

“You go to pay attention because he’s so fast,” says Canelo’s trainer. Khan 
has the early lead but Canelo’s strength is likely to aid him as the fight goes 
on. Khan’s quick left catches Canelo, as the Mexican tries to catch his 
opponent with some big body blows. Khan ends the round with another flurry that 
catches Canelo. I’ll have to give that one to Khan again.

Guardian’s unofficial scorecard: Canelo 9-10 Khan (Canelo 27-30 Khan)

Second round

“He’s telegraphing everything he does,” says Khan’s corner. And Canelo starts 
with a big swing and a miss to start the second round that Khan ducks easily. 
The Mexican then slips slightly and Khan darts in to land two quick blows. Khan 
is the more aggressive fighter so far but is leaving himself exposed when he 
moves in with those quick flurries.

First round

Khan gets a few boos as his name is announced, mixed in with a few cheers. 
Canelo is pretty much universally cheered. Canelo stares at the ground as he 
comes to the centre of the ring. Khan throws the first punches of the fight, 
and soon catches Canelo with a sharp right. A good, confident start from the 
Briton: and Canelo’s face is flushed. But he’s a famously patient fighter and 
ploughs on landing a good counterpunch of his own towards the end of the round. 
Khan’s handspeed wins the round for me.

The fighters enter the ring

Khan enters the ring, he looks pensive. Canelo is next in, smiling as he walks 
down the corridor toward the arena. Definitely looking the calmer fighter. Does 
he know cast members of Saved By The Bell are here? He may well look a little 
more agitated if he did.

The national anthems are being sung. Not at the same time. The British one is 
first up. Sung by a big British star, who I’ve never heard of. And I’m British. 
But apparently he’s famous. Mexico anthem is next up. And very nicely sung it 
is too. Canelo listens in the corridor, he looks calm.

Robin Bradford emails in with some thoughts on the fight. “Well all this talk 
about Canelo being heavier looks a myth on the night. Khan is 1/2 inch shorter 
and 1/2 inch longer in reach. Okay Canelo’s got the harder punch and stronger 
chin but Khan has stopped more opponents with body shots and is faster in the 
back foot. It’s up for grabs for Khan if he can weather the first 5 rounds and 
do an ‘Ali’ shuffle around the square on Canelo, keep the sharp jabs coming in 
and not tire or get into a silly power punching battle.”

HBO have decided to out subtitles on Khan when he’s speaking in the promo. I 
know England is pretty far from Vegas but, you know, they speak English there.

Gennady Golovkin is ringside and is asked how confident he would be against 
the winner of Khan v Canelo. He is ... diplomatic.

I’m very excited to see who wins ... I need my belt. I respect Amir Khan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/amirkhan>, and Canelo is a strong guy.

Pre fight predictions

Our deputy US Sports editor Bryan Graham reckons it’s Canelo’s to lose:

Thinking Khan makes it the distance. Canelo looked weight drained v Cotto and 
that trend could continue. Official prediction is Canelo, seven rounds to five, 
in the fight of Khan’s career.

We also have a Twitter prediction from Ben Anderson. When we got the tweet I 
thought, “Huh, he’s got the same name as Ben Anderson, the guy who does those 
great reports on Isis for Vice.” Then it turned out it IS that Ben Anderson. 
This is better than Anna Paquin’s cameo appearance.

<https://twitter.com/tom_lutz> Canelo slows Khan down with bodywork, then stops

Lemieux beats Tapia by TKO. His corner throws in the towel after Tapia is put 
down by a right. Tapia clearly doesn’t agree and holds his hands to his head. 
But I guess Tapia’s team didn’t want to see their fighter take more punishment. 
Khan v Canelo is on next!

David Lemieux and Glen Tapia enter the ring, the last fight before the main 
card. Lemieux is 1-16 favourite but then again we’re contractually obliged to 
say that Leicester City were 5,000-1 to win the Premier League. And apparently 
they won. You may have read about it elsewhere.

One more fight to go before Khan v Canelo as Gomez-Herrera comes to an end. 
Gomez won every single round with all three judges and remains undefeated. An 
utterly dominant performance.

Khan and Canelo are in the building! I can report they are strolling through 
the corridors doing some shadow boxing and doing their best to look relaxed. 
They both succeed. In more pointless news, while we while away the time Khan is 
absolutely killing it in the social media stakes. Canelo wins the Instagram 
followers (953k to 709k) but Khan wins on Twitter (1.67m to 561k) and DESTROYS 
his opponent on Facebook (3.8m to 1.4m). No news on their MySpace accounts at 
the time of publication.

On the undercard, Teixeira-Stevens has just finished. Stevens won by knockout. 
Here’s what he had to say about his victory:

The name of the game is to knock people out and that’s what I did tonight. I 
feel great to get back into the game after my one and a half year break. I 
really want Lemieux, but I will take whatever I can get. My head is right, and 
I’m ready to take on whoever.

Good evening and welcome to tonight’s live(ish) coverage of Amir Khan’s 
middleweight showdown againstCanelo Alvarez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/canelo-alvarez>. There’s been the kind of 
devotion to weight in the build-up to this fight that you’d usually only see on 
an episode of The Biggest Loser. Khan looked like he’d done a few rounds with 
the McDonalds menu at the weigh-in (I’m taking him relatively here, he still 
looks better in a pair of shorts than 99.99999999% of us ever will) while 
Canelo looked like he could do with a few Big Macs himself. When it comes to 
the fight though, Canelo is likely to be the significantly heavier man. Here’s 
our own Kevin Mitchell on the tale of the scale (hey! that rhymes!):

 It all boils down to weight, though: will Khan be big and strong enough to 
hold at bay a fighter whose calling card is as subtle as a bailiff’s?


Álvarez is coming for Khan’s head, no question, and he will take a lot of 
stopping because of his obvious physical advantages.

At the start of the week Khan weighed 164lbs, and said: “My whole diet and 
training regime has changed. I honestly believe this could be a very good 
weight for me. I’m happier making the weight [than for welterweight at 147lbs]. 
When I get down to 155, I’ll be ripped.” And, at the weigh-in on Friday, so he 
was: totally reconstructed, almost, from the 135lb teenager whowon Olympic 
silver in 2004 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/aug/29/athensolympics2004.olympicgames7>
. As storm clouds gathered, in wicked metaphor, perhaps, both fighters hit the 
scales at 155lbs – and the challenger was noticeably bulkier than when at 
welterweight. When the bell goes on Saturday he will be back to around 164lbs 
and well aware that Álvarez will weigh closer to 175lbs than 170lbs. There is 
no rehydration clause. These are the alleged disciplines of a crazy sport. 
Ideally two fighters would box each other at their most comfortable size and 
weight, confident they had not stripped away the excess too far or too quickly. 
But that rarely happens.

A huge knockout for Canelo wins it. Khan had been in the fight early on and 
his speed caused problems for the Mexican but the longer the fight wore on, the 
more Canelo’s body blows told. And they were enough to sap Khan’s strength and 
allow Canelo to land that big right - it was scary enough for Canelo to 
immediately check on his opponent’s health. Khan did not disgrace himself but 
Canelo was simply too strong. It looks like it’s GGG next for Canelo
 
Question: What now for Canelo? “Canelo needs to step in with GGG. I showed my 
balls, [Canelo] needs to now. I tried my best, I’d like to thank my support.”

Are you going to go down weight? “It was hard to turn down this fight but I 
will probably be going down in weight again.”
 
Question: Did Khan’s speed surprise you: “He’s a fast fighter but I knew time 
would come to my favour and you saw that”


What skills did you show in the fight? “Many people talk about my speed but I 
have many more qualities and I think you saw that. I like to surprise everyone”

GGG is here, will you fight him? “Like we say in Mexico, we don’t fuck around. 
I don’t fear anyone.”
 
Canelo has landed 23 punches to Khan’s four to the body. Khan continues to 
come forward but Canelo is keeping out of his range. A minute into the round, 
Canelo glides forward and lands a brutal combination to Khan’s midriff and then 
goes upstairs to Khan’s head - that hurt the Briton. And then it’s over. Canelo 
lands a huge blow and knocks out Khan on his feet. Khan is out cold and Canelo 
looks concerned for his opponent but - to the relief of everyone – Khan slowly 
rises. It was a HUGE right from Canelo to the side of Khan face and the Briton 
was out before he landed on the canvas. It was big enough for Canelo to 
immediately goes to his knees to check his opponent was OK.
 
A hard left from Canelo early in the round, and Khan’s legs wobble ever so 
slightly. This has been a magnificent fight so far, both men fighting near 
their best - Khan is exceeding expectations. Canelo continues to land bombs on 
Khan’s body but the Briton is doing good work to Canelo’s head.

Guardian’s unofficial scorecard: Canelo 10-9 Khan (Canelo 47-48 Khan)
 
Canelo closes in on his opponent and lands his best blow of the fight a big 
right to the body. But Khan’s hand speed is still causing Canelo problems. 
Canelo is still taking some wild punches that Khan is avoiding with ease. But 
he countered Khan well in that round and gave him very little space.

Guardian’s unofficial scorecard: Canelo 10-9 Khan (Canelo 37-39 Khan)
 
“You go to pay attention because he’s so fast,” says Canelo’s trainer. Khan 
has the early lead but Canelo’s strength is likely to aid him as the fight goes 
on. Khan’s quick left catches Canelo, as the Mexican tries to catch his 
opponent with some big body blows. Khan ends the round with another flurry that 
catches Canelo. I’ll have to give that one to Khan again.

Guardian’s unofficial scorecard: Canelo 9-10 Khan (Canelo 27-30 Khan)
 
“He’s telegraphing everything he does,” says Khan’s corner. And Canelo starts 
with a big swing and a miss to start the second round that Khan ducks easily. 
The Mexican then slips slightly and Khan darts in to land two quick blows. Khan 
is the more aggressive fighter so far but is leaving himself exposed when he 
moves in with those quick flurries.

Guardian’s unofficial scorecard: Canelo 9-10 Khan (Canelo 18-20 Khan)
 
Khan gets a few boos as his name is announced, mixed in with a few cheers. 
Canelo is pretty much universally cheered. Canelo stares at the ground as he 
comes to the centre of the ring. Khan throws the first punches of the fight, 
and soon catches Canelo with a sharp right. A good, confident start from the 
Briton: and Canelo’s face is flushed. But he’s a famously patient fighter and 
ploughs on landing a good counterpunch of his own towards the end of the round. 
Khan’s handspeed wins the round for me.

Guardian’s unofficial scorecard: Canelo 9-10 Khan (Canelo 9-10 Khan)
 
Khan enters the ring, he looks pensive. Canelo is next in, smiling as he walks 
down the corridor toward the arena. Definitely looking the calmer fighter. Does 
he know cast members of Saved By The Bell are here? He may well look a little 
more agitated if he did.
 
The national anthems are being sung. Not at the same time. The British one is 
first up. Sung by a big British star, who I’ve never heard of. And I’m British. 
But apparently he’s famous. Mexico anthem is next up. And very nicely sung it 
is too. Canelo listens in the corridor, he looks calm.

Robin Bradford emails in with some thoughts on the fight. “Well all this talk 
about Canelo being heavier looks a myth on the night. Khan is 1/2 inch shorter 
and 1/2 inch longer in reach. Okay Canelo’s got the harder punch and stronger 
chin but Khan has stopped more opponents with body shots and is faster in the 
back foot. It’s up for grabs for Khan if he can weather the first 5 rounds and 
do an ‘Ali’ shuffle around the square on Canelo, keep the sharp jabs coming in 
and not tire or get into a silly power punching battle.”
 
HBO have decided to out subtitles on Khan when he’s speaking in the promo. I 
know England is pretty far from Vegas but, you know, they speak English there.
 
Gennady Golovkin is ringside and is asked how confident he would be against 
the winner of Khan v Canelo. He is ... diplomatic.

I’m very excited to see who wins ... I need my belt. I respect Amir Khan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/amirkhan>, and Canelo is a strong guy.

Our deputy US Sports editor Bryan Graham reckons it’s Canelo’s to lose:

Thinking Khan makes it the distance. Canelo looked weight drained v Cotto and 
that trend could continue. Official prediction is Canelo, seven rounds to five, 
in the fight of Khan’s career.

We also have a Twitter prediction from Ben Anderson. When we got the tweet I 
thought, “Huh, he’s got the same name as Ben Anderson, the guy who does those 
great reports on Isis for Vice.” Then it turned out it IS that Ben Anderson. 
This is better than Anna Paquin’s cameo appearance.

Lemieux beats Tapia by TKO. His corner throws in the towel after Tapia is put 
down by a right. Tapia clearly doesn’t agree and holds his hands to his head. 
But I guess Tapia’s team didn’t want to see their fighter take more punishment. 
Khan v Canelo is on next!
 
Anna Paquin, star of The One With the Vampires That Got Boring Near the End 
and Having the Same Birthday As Me (24 July since you ask), has arrived. That’s 
all the celebrities I have for now. I think the third-most famous dude out of 
Saved By The Bell is here too.

David Lemieux and Glen Tapia enter the ring, the last fight before the main 
card. Lemieux is 1-16 favourite but then again we’re contractually obliged to 
say that Leicester City were 5,000-1 to win the Premier League. And apparently 
they won. You may have read about it elsewhere.
 
One more fight to go before Khan v Canelo as Gomez-Herrera comes to an end. 
Gomez won every single round with all three judges and remains undefeated. An 
utterly dominant performance.
 
Gomez and Herrera are coming towards the end of their fight. Gomez has been on 
top throughout and Herrera has been cut underneath his left eye. In the 
meantime, the Guardian’s biggestAmir Khan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/amirkhan> fan, Madhvi Pankhania, has written 
on why Khan isn’t as loved in his homeland (Bolton excepted) as he is abroad:

Khan and Canelo are in the building! I can report they are strolling through 
the corridors doing some shadow boxing and doing their best to look relaxed. 
They both succeed. In more pointless news, while we while away the time Khan is 
absolutely killing it in the social media stakes. Canelo wins the Instagram 
followers (953k to 709k) but Khan wins on Twitter (1.67m to 561k) and DESTROYS 
his opponent on Facebook (3.8m to 1.4m). No news on their MySpace accounts at 
the time of publication.

On the undercard, Teixeira-Stevens has just finished. Stevens won by knockout. 
Here’s what he had to say about his victory:

The name of the game is to knock people out and that’s what I did tonight. I 
feel great to get back into the game after my one and a half year break. I 
really want Lemieux, but I will take whatever I can get. My head is right, and 
I’m ready to take on whoever.
 
Good evening and welcome to tonight’s live(ish) coverage of Amir Khan’s 
middleweight showdown againstCanelo Alvarez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/canelo-alvarez>. There’s been the kind of 
devotion to weight in the build-up to this fight that you’d usually only see on 
an episode of The Biggest Loser. Khan looked like he’d done a few rounds with 
the McDonalds menu at the weigh-in (I’m taking him relatively here, he still 
looks better in a pair of shorts than 99.99999999% of us ever will) while 
Canelo looked like he could do with a few Big Macs himself. When it comes to 
the fight though, Canelo is likely to be the significantly heavier man. Here’s 
our own Kevin Mitchell on the tale of the scale (hey! that rhymes!):

 It all boils down to weight, though: will Khan be big and strong enough to 
hold at bay a fighter whose calling card is as subtle as a bailiff’s?


Álvarez is coming for Khan’s head, no question, and he will take a lot of 
stopping because of his obvious physical advantages.

At the start of the week Khan weighed 164lbs, and said: “My whole diet and 
training regime has changed. I honestly believe this could be a very good 
weight for me. I’m happier making the weight [than for welterweight at 147lbs]. 
When I get down to 155, I’ll be ripped.” And, at the weigh-in on Friday, so he 
was: totally reconstructed, almost, from the 135lb teenager whowon Olympic 
silver in 2004 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/aug/29/athensolympics2004.olympicgames7>
. As storm clouds gathered, in wicked metaphor, perhaps, both fighters hit the 
scales at 155lbs – and the challenger was noticeably bulkier than when at 
welterweight. When the bell goes on Saturday he will be back to around 164lbs 
and well aware that Álvarez will weigh closer to 175lbs than 170lbs. There is 
no rehydration clause. These are the alleged disciplines of a crazy sport. 
Ideally two fighters would box each other at their most comfortable size and 
weight, confident they had not stripped away the excess too far or too quickly. 
But that rarely happens.
