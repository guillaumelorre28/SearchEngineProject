Morecambe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/morecambe> supporters have 
paid the £1,000 sum of fines and costs charged to the manager Jim Bentley by 
the Football Association for improper conduct. He had been sent to the stands 
during the League Two club’s defeat against Cheltenham Town in December because 
of his reaction to Alex Kenyon’s red card.

Bentley’s reaction also led to a two-match touchline ban and he has been 
warned about his future conduct. Bentley was not in the dugout for Morecambe’s 
4-1 win over Notts County on Saturday. Supporters collected money during the 
match and upon receiving the cash Bentley, who has managed the club since 2011, 
was reduced to tears.

Morecambe are currently working under serious financial constraints and are 
operating under a transfer embargo. Bentley joined the club as a player in 2002 
from Telford United, and went on to make almost 300 appearances for them. “The 
Morecambe manager used abusive and/or threatening words towards an opponent or 
opponents and/or his behaviour amounted to improper conduct,” read an FA 
statement. “The charge was in relation to an incident in or around the 39th 
minute of the game against Cheltenham Town on 17 December 2016.”

Morecambe are 17th in League Two and have won two of their last four matches.
