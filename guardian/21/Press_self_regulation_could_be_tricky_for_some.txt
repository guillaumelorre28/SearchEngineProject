Anyone who remembers the serial failures of the pathetic Press Complaints 
Commission and the appalling stories that came out during the Leveson inquiry 
must know that effective self-regulation of the press is a pipe dream (Press 
laws punish the many for the mistakes of the few 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/10/the-guardian-view-on-section-40-muzzling-journalism>
, 11 January). Publications that don’t give a toss about truth, accuracy or 
ruining innocent people’s lives won’t behave better unless they are regulated 
by a code that is legally enforceable. If you don’t like section 40 and you 
don’t want the current model of a state-sponsored regulator, then try 
campaigning for a better statutory regulator. But please don’t pretend that 
there is any future in just exhorting the press to be good boys and girls, 
which is all that self-regulation amounts to.

• Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 threatens news media with savage 
penalties for undertaking investigative reporting that exposes serious 
wrongdoing. By contrast, the MPs who passed it will remain free to make totally 
unfounded allegations against any person or organisation under the protection 
of parliamentary privilege with no fear of any sanction.
