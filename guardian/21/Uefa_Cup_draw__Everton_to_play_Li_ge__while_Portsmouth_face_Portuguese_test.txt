Standard Liège will resume hostilities on Merseyside when they face Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> in the first round of the Uefa 
Cup. The Belgian side took Liverpool to extra-time in the final qualifying 
round of the Champions League and David Moyes knows his side will have to be on 
guard against tricky, physical opponents.

Portsmouth and Spurs have difficult draws against Vitoria, who finished third 
in the Portuguese league last season, andWisla Krakow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wislakrakow> of Poland respectively. 
Manchester City's reward for struggling past Midtjylland is a tie with Omonia 
of Cyprus. Aston Villa, meanwhile, face Litex Lovech of Bulgaria.

Redknapp said he expected a difficult challenge against Pompey's opponents 
from Guimaraes. "It is not an easy draw. They are a good side," he said. "The 
Portuguese league is a tough one with teams like FC Porto, Sporting Lisbon and 
Benfica - but Vitoria finished third last season so they can't be bad."

Motherwell have been given a tough tie with Nancy, who only missed out on the 
Champions League by two points in Ligue 1 last season. St Patrick's of the 
League of Ireland will pull off a major shock if they get past Bundesliga side
Hertha Berlin <https://www.theguardian.com/football/herthaberlin>. The ties 
will be played on September 18 and October 2.
