Ricky Hatton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rickyhatton> has confirmed 
that his comeback fight on 24 November will be against the Ukrainian Vyacheslav 
Senchenko.

Speaking at a press conference on Friday morning Hatton, 33, who is coming out 
of retirement following three and a half years away from the ring, announced 
that the 35-year-old Senchenko would be his first opponent in a welterweight 
bout at the Manchester Evening News Arena.

Largely unknown on British shores, Senchenko, like Hatton, is a former world 
welterweight champion. He lost the belt in his last bout, his first career 
loss, to the American Paulie Malignaggi.

That was his first defeat in his 33rd fight, losing to a man Hatton himself 
beat in his penultimate match-up before retirement. His next outing was the 
convincing defeat by Manny Pacquiao, a setback that sent him on a downward 
spiral that saw him encounter problems with alcohol and drugs.

After a lengthy absence from the sport he confirmed his retirement last year, 
only to announce two weeks ago that he was returning to the ring.

Entering the media gathering to a video of his brutal dismantling by Pacquiao, 
Hatton went on to state his belief that he has selected the toughest-possible 
opponent.

"I can't wait to get in the ring now," Hatton said. "I'm sure that Vyacheslav 
will give me a good fight, but it's one I am confident I can win. I believe 
this was as good an opponent as I could have had.

"Senchenko lost the last time he fought but he has a good pedigree. But I'm in 
great shape, I'm feeling good and I know I can put on a performance for those 
watching."

Hatton also choked up when adding that the bout, his first at the MEN Arena 
since his famous win over Kosta Tszyu in 2005, had sold out. "I cannot thank 
the people of Manchester enough," he said.
