A Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> man who 
is allegedly keeping a cluster of illegal rabbits at his Brisbane home faces up 
to $60,000 in fines under the state’s tough anti-rabbit laws.

Brisbane <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/brisbane> City Council 
received 11 complaints of rabbit sightings in the inner-city suburb of Red Hill 
in 2016 and a spokesman said they are believed to belong to the same person.

Rabbits are a restricted animal in Queensland and it is illegal to keep them 
as pets, under strict biosecurity laws.

But, according to local media reports 
<http://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/southwest/christmas-confused-for-easter-as-rabbits-spotted-on-streets-of-red-hill/news-story/826ad2ecdffa0fbad02c66f5e17a978b>
, a number of domestic rabbits have been spotted on footpaths and in suburban 
backyards in Red Hill and some had even been hit by cars.

In a statement, a council spokesman said the rabbits had been traced back to 
one property.

“Council understands the source of the rabbits is a local resident, who is 
keeping the animals on his property,” they said. “Council is working with the 
resident to have the rabbits removed.”

Council was not able to say how many rabbits were at the house, how they had 
escaped, or whether the man had been charged.

Rabbits are classed as “restricted matter” under the Biosecurity Act 2014 
<https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/biosecurity/about-biosecurity/biosecurity-act-2014/biosecurity-matter/restricted-matter>
. Anyone found to have sold, traded or given a rabbit in any way, or to have 
kept one as a pet, or to have transported it, or to have fed one for any 
purpose other than baiting it, faces a fine of up to $60,950. The penalties 
have recently increased.

The Queensland government has faced continuing pressure to change the law by 
pet owners who say they should be able to keep rabbits as pets provided they 
are microchipped and desexed.

Alyson Shepherd, who runs the Facebook page Legalise Pet Rabbits in 
Queensland, said cases like this, when rabbits have reportedly roamed 
uncontrolled, damaged their campaign.

“It’s something we are completely against in our fight to legalise rabbits,” 
she told Guardian Australia. “We are completely angry about this because it’s 
now going to be a burden in our fight.”

Shepherd brought her pet rabbit with her when she moved to Queensland from 
Melbourne, driving it across the border at Tweed Heads past the signs warning 
of what was then a $44,000 fine for rabbit ownership.

She says pet rabbits are common in Queensland, despite the law, and a number 
of veterinary clinics are prepared to treat them so long as they are desexed.

“There are people here in Queensland and there are vets who look after them,” 
she said. “We call them long-eared guinea pigs.”

It may work as a code name in veterinary clinics but a rabbit owner who tried 
the same argument on police in March

 had to surrender the bunny to a rabbit sanctuary in Grafton, back across the 
border in rabbit-friendly New South Wales.

Shepherd said the law was “ridiculous”, particularly because Queensland had 
not outlawed the keeping of domestic mice, rats, or cats, all of which are 
significant feral pests.

According to Queensland’s Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, domestic 
rabbits are banned because they can easily interbreed with wild populations if 
they escape or are released, boosting wild numbers.

Queensland’s rabbit-proof fence makes it the only state to have a significant 
area that is largely free of rabbits, and pet rabbits threaten that status, the 
department said.

The department does issue permits for the use of rabbits for “certain forms of 
public entertainment… e.g. magic shows and circuses” and for scientific 
research but not to be kept as pets.

Rabbits were released in Victoria as hunting fodder in 1859 and quickly 
multiplied. The wild rabbit population in Australia is currently estimated at 
400m.
