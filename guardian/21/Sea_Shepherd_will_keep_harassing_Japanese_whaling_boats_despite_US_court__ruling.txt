A United States court ruling preventing conservationists from attacking 
Japanese whaling boats will not stop the annual protection campaign in the 
Southern Ocean.

The Japanese Times newspaper reported on Tuesday that a settlement declaring 
theSea Shepherd Conservation Society 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/sea-shepherd-conservation-society> was 
“permanently enjoined from physically attacking the [Japanese] research vessels 
and crew and from navigating in a manner that is likely to endanger their safe 
navigation”.

In response, Sea Shepherd Australia’s boss, Jeff Hansen, said his organisation 
remained “committed to upholding the Australian federal court ruling banning 
the slaughter of whales in the Australian whale sanctuary. We are not concerned 
about the US court settlement as it does not have any effect on Australian law.”

Japan’s Institute of Cetacean Research had sought an injunction in 2011 in a 
US court to stop Sea Shepherd hindering its whaling program.

Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> officially halted commercial 
whaling in 1987 in response to an international moratorium declared one year 
previously.

However, it has used a loophole to continue whaling under the premise of 
scientific research, despite international criticism.

Japanese whalers captured 333 minke whales in the Antarctic in the most recent 
season, which ended in March, but did not face any obstructive activities from 
the anti-whaling group.

The hunt was the first since the international court of justice ruled in 2014 
that Japan’s “research whaling” program in the Southern Ocean contravened the 
moratorium.
