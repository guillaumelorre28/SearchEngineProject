I read Michele Hanson’s article (G2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/23/microsoft-windows-ten-10-software-update-problems-iplayer>
, 24 May) with a wry smile, having spent time earlier modifying a friend’s 
computer to prevent it updating to Windows 10, as the same thing had nearly 
happened to me last month.

What happens is that Microsoft installs a Trojan horse update along with all 
the normal ones. Sometime later this malware initiates an upgrade toWindows 10 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows-10> without asking permission, 
and no method of cancellation without turning the computer off.

To prevent this happening, you need to uninstall update number KB3035583 (go 
to control panel, Windows update, installed updates, then find the right update 
KB3035583 right click on it and click uninstall). You may want to stopMicrosoft 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft> installing it again by 
switching off automatic updates (Windows update, change settings).

I have heard many stories of people who have upgraded to Windows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows> 10 and found numerous problems 
using their computer, including lost data. Microsoft may claim to have asked 
permission, but they haven’t – the only permission they had was to install 
updates (mainly fixes) to the existing operating system, not to change it 
completely. Maybe you should publish an article in the main section of the 
Guardian (pity you got rid of your tech section!).

• Michele Hanson and I seem to lead almost parallel lives but this week the 
coincidence was incredible as only last evening, I experienced an unsolicited 
invasion from Microsoft! I turned my back for a few minutes, only to find my PC 
was “upgrading” Windows of its own accord. For over an hour, I was unable to 
access my e-mails or do any of the work I had planned. Like Michele, I was 
furious.

Unlike Michele, I chose to decline the legal agreement which appeared on 
screen after the download. This allowed me to revert to Windows 7. Of course, I 
was pestered by one of those “Are you sure?” messages which I cancelled. I have 
made a conscious decision not to change from usingWindows 7 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows-7> to 10 as I know I will lose 
a lot of useful software that currently I use free of charge. It means I have 
to routinely decline an offer to upgrade to Windows 10.

I am very concerned that Microsoft is doing this without users’ permission – 
and I am clearly not alone. I can only conclude that they want us all to 
download a system which will allow them to track our activities more closely – 
and oblige us to pay for every item of software on a separate basis.

• Thanks to Michelle Hanson forher Windows 10 grumble. I was horrified last 
evening when I woke up my PC to find it busy changing my operating system 
without any approval by me. I had deleted every one of the twice a day messages 
asking me to allow the changeover and assumed I would continue with Windows 7. 
Having suffered the problems of learning new methods and layouts when 7 
superseded XP – not easy at 87 – I wanted a lot of reassurance before plunging 
into unknown waters. Fortunately clicking “decline” when asked to agree to the 
terms and conditions caused a reinstall to start but the terror of losing all 
my files haunts me. Shame on Windows!

• If Windows 10 starts to install, the worst thing you can do is start hitting 
keys at random (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/nothing-but-woe-for-users-of-windows>
, 25 May). If there’s no cancel option, artificially stopping the process may 
lead to corruption and an unusable computer. Better to let the process complete 
and then, if you don’t like the result, exercise the option, which lasts for 30 
days, to go back to how things were.

• David London (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/nothing-but-woe-for-users-of-windows>
, 25 May) was right to stop the automatic upgrade to Windows 10. Like a fool, I 
allowed mine to continue. Windows 10 is awful. The screen is dark. The font and 
icons are squashed. Windows 7 was much clearer. I don’t suppose I can go back 
now. I was the victim of a dirty trick. If there was ever a case of “If it 
ain’t broke don’t fix it”, this is it. I no longer respect Bill Gates.

• The same thing happened to me. But all was not lost. When I put my laptop on 
the following morning I found that there was an option to accept Windows 10 or 
to reject it, which I promptly did.

• I tried Windows 10, and didn’t like it – in particular Windows XP mode 
didn’t work (which allows one to run old programs), and which Microsoft say 
that they have no plans to install on Windows 10. So I reinstalled Windows 7, 
but then found, like Michele Hanson and David London, Windows 10 reinstalling 
itself. There are two things you need to do to stop this: first turn off 
automatic updates; and second there’s a bit of freeware called Never10 which 
removes all the Windows 10 stuff from your PC that is taking up almost 4GB of 
space. It works.
