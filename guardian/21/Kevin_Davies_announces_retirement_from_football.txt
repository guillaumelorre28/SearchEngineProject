scored 150 career goals in 820 appearances for several clubs including 
Southampton, Bolton and most recentlyPreston North End

The forward left Deepdale at the end of last season after helping them win 
promotion from League One to the Championship.

He told TalkSport: “I could probably physically do another season but I just 
feel it’s the right time. I’ll look back with immense pride for the last 22 
years.”

Davies was released by Preston at the end of the campaign after making 43 
appearances for the club. “It was disappointing what happened at Preston,” he 
said. “I was talking about doing a new contract there and coaching and playing 
on for another year in the Championship and that didn’t quite materialise. It 
did knock the stuffing out of me a little bit.

“But I’ve had that in my career before with Bolton, Southampton and even 
Sheffield United when I got rejected at the age of 15. I kept bouncing back, 
but I just felt this time I couldn’t quite get to that stage again. One of my 
biggest regrets is not playing for Sheffield United. I grew up in that area but 
it was one of those that never quite materialised, sadly.”

 Kevin Davies talks to Barry Glendenning in March about his life and career, 
from breaking through with Chesterfield at such a young age to getting the 
England call aged 33. 
Davies told the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/mar/20/kevin-davies-england-video-interview>
 in March that he “thought it was a wind-up” when he called up to play for 
England at 33. He won his sole international cap in a 0-0 draw against 
Montenegro at Wembley, making him the oldest England debutant since 1950.

“I’d been in so many of those long squads and on stand-by I never thought it 
would quite come,” he said. “To get the call at 33, it was just an amazing week 
for myself. I just loved every minute, travelling down, the training and 
getting onto the pitch.

“It wasn’t a great game but to get on the pitch and represent my country was 
the pinnacle. I would have also loved to play for England more, to have gone to 
tournaments and have those experiences, but I could only have done what I did.”
