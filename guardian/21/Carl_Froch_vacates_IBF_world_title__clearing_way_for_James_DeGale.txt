Carl Froch has vacated his IBF super-middleweight title – leaving the door 
open for his compatriotJames DeGale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> to fight for the title in the 
coming months.

DeGale became the mandatory challenger for the IBF belt when he defeated 
Brandon Gonzales on the undercard of the Froch-Groves re-match at Wembley 
Stadium.

But Froch, whose last bout was his memorable knockout of Groves last May, had 
been chasing a lucrative showdown with Julio César Chávez Jr in Las Vegas on 28 
March until an elbow injury ended his hopes.

He still aims to land a fight against the former middleweight champion Chávez 
this summer but said he could not stand in the way of DeGale getting a world 
title chance.

“It’s been a frustrating couple of weeks with terms agreed for the Chávez 
fight only for me to be unable to proceed in camp due to injury,” said Froch. 
“I know what it’s like to wait for a shot and I didn’t want to hold James up in 
fighting for a world title. James is a great fighter and I hope he can go out 
and win that title and who knows, we may even meet later in the year.”
