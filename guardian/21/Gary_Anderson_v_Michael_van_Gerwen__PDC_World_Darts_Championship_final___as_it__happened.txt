A bit of housekeeping for you … there were 42 180s which is comfortably a 
record. These two really have taken darts to the next level.

And in a minute or two, Van Gerwen is going to be officially presented with 
the trophy he’s already hoisted. Twice. First though, Sky Sports reverts to 
full montage mode.

MvG doesn't bother waiting to be presented with the trophy, grabbing it off 
the plinth instead. Superb.

“That was a bit said to be fair, you always get people like that, they try to 
be funny. He wanted to give me the trophy but you’re not allowed to do that,” 
says Van Gerwen of the invader.

Anderson is phlegmatic in defeat: “The year that this man has had, it’s been a 
walk in the park for him. It’s well deserved but I’ve had a good three years, 
the crowd has been fantastic and we’ve had a good couple of weeks.”

Van Gerwen is relishing his moment. In truth he was far too good for Anderson, 
who really did pay the price for failing to go 3-1 up in sets. The Dutchman’s 
form when streaking clear of the two-times defending champion was out of this 
world. A worthy champion indeed.

“I feel absolutely over the moon,” says Van Gerwen. “I’m a very happy man at 
the moment.”

Van Gerwen wins the World Darts Championship!

Tenth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): Van Gerwen 
is back to within one leg again. Oooosh, that’s ominous, a 180 from Van Gerwen 
but Anderson responds with one of his own! He may need 134 to stay in the match 
though. He can’t do it so Van Gerwen has 85 for the title, make that bullseye … 
AND HE NAILS IT!

Tenth set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): The crowd 
are bellowing Anderson’s name. And a timely 140 puts a bit of pressure on Van 
Gerwen’s throw. As does another 180 for Anderson. Van Gerwen checks out on 100 
though – his fifth three-figure finish.

Tenth set: Van Gerwen 1-2 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): It’s 
another 180 for Anderson though. And another for Van Gerwen. Woof! Anderson 
needs 103 to take this leg. Not this time. Van Gerwen needs 124 to move to the 
brink. But he can’t find it and Anderson takes the leg with tops.

Tenth set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): Van Gerwen 
responds the only way he knows how, with a maximum. Van Gerwen needs 87 for 
this leg and needs just two darts for an 11-dart leg. Emphatic.

Tenth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): He 
couldn’t, could he? Anderson has the darts. And he racks up another maximum. 
Van Gerwen seems rattled by that invader and Anderson is all of a sudden 
hitting his doubles!

Ninth set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-2 in sets): Anderson 
has the arrows. And his 16th 180 takes him to 125. He’s left himself 40 but Van 
Gerwen is nowhere in this leg. Maybe not after a 180. Anderson misses three 
darts at tops so Van Gerwen has 115 for the title. It’s not going to be this 
time, and after a brief interlude for a stage invader, we’re back. And Anderson 
hits double five.

Ninth set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-2 in sets): Anderson to 
throw first. He’s left himself 130 and has six darts at it. He’s left himself 
40 … and gets it. So we’re level in the set at one apiece.

Ninth set: Van Gerwen 1-0 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-2 in sets): Van Gerwen 
has the darts. And van Gerwen opens up with his 16th 18. 100 from Anderson. 44 
from Van Gerwen though, and a 180 from Anderson. 51 from Van Gerwen. Chance. 
Anderson has 140 to finish but can only manage 60. He’ll be back though. 80 
then. 20, 20, 20 … so Van Gerwen needs 145. Anderson is back, AGAIN. He needs 
20. And doesn’t get it. He’s gone. And Van Gerwen comes back to win the leg 
with double three.

Van Gerwen wins the eighth set to lead 6-2!

Eighth set: Van Gerwen 3-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 5-2 in sets): Van Gerwen 
starts with 180. Of course he does. And just misses another. The Dutchman is 
streets ahead in this leg and has six darts at 100. He needs three and he needs 
just one more set for victory. It’s becoming a procession.

Eighth set: Van Gerwen 2-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 5-2 in sets): It’s when 
Anderson is in the 200s that things aren’t really going his way. But he’s left 
himself with 104. No three figure finish for him yet. Now is a good time to 
start … nope. He misses double 12. Van Gerwen needs 75 … and he hits double 12. 
And that’s the story of this match.

Eighth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 5-2 in sets): Anderson 
with the darts. If there is to be any comeback now is the time to start Gary … 
100 to start. Van Gerwen is just relentless at the moment but Anderson has his 
nose in front in this leg. But visits of 40 and then 45 are not good enough. 
He’s in trouble again. Van Gerwen has 72 to break again. 16, 16, but he misses 
tops. Anderson needs 117. Ooouch. He misses tops as well. But Van Gerwen misses 
three darts at 40 … but Anderson misses three darts at 20!!!!! Van Gerwen needs 
double one … and misses. Yikes. Anderson finally hits double two to hold. And 
breathe.

An email from Simon McMahon …

Anderson on the ropes here. It will take a superhuman effort for him to win 
from here. He might still be Ali, but it appears he’s facing George Foreman and 
Larry Holmes now.

Van Gerwen wins seventh set to lead 5-2!

Seventh set: Van Gerwen 3-0 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets): The Touré 
brothers are back. Van Gerwen has 125 for the set. Of course he does. Van 
Gerwen is threatening to race away with this and burst a number of blood 
vessels in the process.

Seventh set: Van Gerwen 2-0 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets): Anderson 
begins with a 180. The commentators are saying there is no ceiling to how good 
the darts can be … hmmm. Van Gerwen is about to break again though, double 16 
again … Yep. The Dutchman has won 10 of the last 11 legs.

Van Gerwen wins the sixth set to lead 4-2!

Sixth set: Van Gerwen 3-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets): Van Gerwen 
is throwing for the set. And piles it on with a 140. Anderson replies in kind. 
But Van Gerwen has 161 for the set. No dice so Anderson has 124 but it’s just 
not happening for the champ and Van Gerwen checks out in style on 64.

Sixth set: Van Gerwen 2-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets): Van Gerwen 
hits 180 No2. Anderson does the same. This MC’s “180” is just fantastic. 
Anderson has 81. Oh, bends the wire but he misses double six. Van Gerwen 
pinches the leg with double eight.

Sixth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets): Van Gerwen 
has won the last five sets – Anderson is clearly rattled but has the darts and 
must respond. Scrappy start but Van Gerwen has a chance to make it six in a 
row. Van Gerwen leaves himself 84 and will be back. Hits the treble but misses 
two darts at double 12. Oosh. That was a vital double tops for Anderson and 
he’s back in the groove.

Fifth set: Van Gerwen 2-0 Anderson (2-2 in sets): Anderson surely must hold 
this set to stop Van Gerwen opening up a big lead. Van Gerwen applies pressure 
with a maximum … 136 for Anderson. Nope. So 94 for Van Gerwen to break. And 
he’s done it with tops.

Fifth set: Van Gerwen 1-0 Anderson (2-2 in sets): Van Gerwen to throw first. 
How much will Anderson dwell on that missed opportunity? Van Gerwen is bouncing 
to oche. But that’s a timely maximim for Anderson who has 128 to break. 
Bullseye for it – nope. Van Gerwen needs 68 to hold, teble 20 but no dice on 
double four or double two. Anderson needs 35. 15, misses double 10 and misses 
double five! Van Gerwen nails double one to hold.

Van Gerwen wins the fourth set to level at 2-2!

Fourth set: Van Gerwen 3-2 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): 361 plays 
362. Wow. 171 for Anderson just when he needed something. Van Gerwen hits back 
with 180. Anderson needs 132, not this time. Van Gerwen has 86 to break back. 
Oh my! He’s done it. And he’s pretty happy about it! Anderson could have opened 
some daylight there but Van Gerwen loves that kind of finish. Game on.

Fourth set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): Van Gerwen 
with the darts and he’s left himself 170. This one looks like ANOTHER fifth leg 
… only 58 for the Dutchman but Anderson is nowhere. 112 for Van Gerwen, nope, 
it’s now 32. And Anderson is now down to 78. Van Gerwen eventually comes 
through.

Fourth set: Van Gerwen 1-2 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): Anderson is 
looking good here. 140 leaves him 222, make that 124. What can Van Gerwen do, 
not much with 95. Anderson needs 124 … but takes 84 with Van Gerwen struggling. 
Struggling but then nailing a 180. Anderson hits tops though so he leads again.

Fourth set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): A 180 from 
Van Gerwen, he looks visibly cross, and he should hold this one at least. He’s 
left himself 40, Anderson is toiling at 249. Van Gerwen nails tops. One apiece.

Fourth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): Anderson is 
flying and opens with a 180. Anderson needs 40 for an all important hold but 
before that Van Gerwen has 170. He hits both trebles … but misses the bull. 
Anderson hits tops with his second effort so the champ holds.

Here’s a report of the action for you to digest …

Michael van Gerwen beats Gary Anderson to win World Darts Championship

… which means that’s about all from me. As ever, many thanks for reading. Bye!
 
A bit of housekeeping for you … there were 42 180s which is comfortably a 
record. These two really have taken darts to the next level.

And in a minute or two, Van Gerwen is going to be officially presented with 
the trophy he’s already hoisted. Twice. First though, Sky Sports reverts to 
full montage mode.

MvG doesn't bother waiting to be presented with the trophy, grabbing it off 
the plinth instead. Superb.

be funny. He wanted to give me the trophy but you’re not allowed to do that,” 
says Van Gerwen of the invader.

Anderson is phlegmatic in defeat: “The year that this man has had, it’s been a 
walk in the park for him. It’s well deserved but I’ve had a good three years, 
the crowd has been fantastic and we’ve had a good couple of weeks.”
 
Van Gerwen is relishing his moment. In truth he was far too good for Anderson, 
who really did pay the price for failing to go 3-1 up in sets. The Dutchman’s 
form when streaking clear of the two-times defending champion was out of this 
world. A worthy champion indeed.

“I feel absolutely over the moon,” says Van Gerwen. “I’m a very happy man at 
the moment.”
 
Tenth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): Van Gerwen 
is back to within one leg again. Oooosh, that’s ominous, a 180 from Van Gerwen

though. He can’t do it so Van Gerwen has 85 for the title, make that bullseye … 
AND HE NAILS IT!
 
Tenth set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): The crowd

brink. But he can’t find it and Anderson takes the leg with tops.
 
Tenth set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): Van Gerwen

then. 20, 20, 20 … so Van Gerwen needs 145. Anderson is back, AGAIN. He needs 
20. And doesn’t get it. He’s gone. And Van Gerwen comes back to win the leg 
with double three.

start … nope. He misses double 12. Van Gerwen needs 75 … and he hits double 12. 
And that’s the story of this match.

Eighth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 5-2 in sets): Anderson 
with the darts. If there is to be any comeback now is the time to start Gary … 
100 to start. Van Gerwen is just relentless at the moment but Anderson has his 
nose in front in this leg. But visits of 40 and then 45 are not good enough. 
He’s in trouble again. Van Gerwen has 72 to break again. 16, 16, but he misses 
tops. Anderson needs 117. Ooouch. He misses tops as well. But Van Gerwen misses 
three darts at 40 … but Anderson misses three darts at 20!!!!! Van Gerwen needs 
double one … and misses. Yikes. Anderson finally hits double two to hold. And 
breathe.
 
An email from Simon McMahon …

Anderson on the ropes here. It will take a superhuman effort for him to win 
from here. He might still be Ali, but it appears he’s facing George Foreman and 
Larry Holmes now.
