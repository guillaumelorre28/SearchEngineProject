Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> beat Schalke 
3-0 and increased their lead to 10 points as they closed in on a record fourth 
straight Bundesliga title.

Robert Lewandowski’s double took him to a career high for league goals in a 
season to 27, and Arturo Vidal added Bayern’s third.

Bayern could not crack Schalke’s defence until Lewandowski chested down a pass 
from Vidal, turned, and shot from close range in the 54th minute. He doubled 
the lead by rising to head in a cross from Rafinha. Vidal completed the victory 
after some good work by the substitute Franck Ribéry.
