Blackburn Rovers manager and I look forward to working with terrific people at 
the club. The ultimate aim is to give a team that is representative of the 
fans, a team that is entertaining and hard-working, and a team that can win.”

Blackburn Rovers director Mike Cheston said: “We are delighted to welcome Owen 
to the club. We took our time and conducted a thorough search and Owen was the 
stand-out candidate. He brings with him a wealth of management experience, a 
strong track record in theChampionship

complement our existing coaching staff perfectly. He meets all of the criteria 
we were looking for and we firmly believe he is the right man to take this club 
forward.”
