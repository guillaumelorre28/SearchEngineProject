Afternoon summary

 * Anis Amri, the man believed to be behind the Berlin Christmas market attack 
that killed 12 people has been shot dead by Italian police. The Italian 
interior minister said he was on foot when he was stopped in Milan during a 
routine check. 
 * Amri opened fire when challenged, shooting one police officer, Cristian 
Movio, in the shoulder.The 36-year-old officer’s wound is not life-threatening 
and photographs have shown him sitting up and smiling in hospital. Another 
officer, Luca Scata, a 29-year-old who had been on the job for nine months, 
then shot and killed the suspected terrorist. 
 * A video of Amri pledging allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr 
al-Baghdadi has been published by the extremist group’s Amaq news agency. In it 
Amri calls for Isis supporters to take revenge against “crusaders” bombing 
Muslims.

 * The focus of the investigation into the Berlin attack is now on whether 
Amri had any assistance or accomplices, the country’s federal prosecutor, Peter 
Frank, said. 
 * The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was told of Amri’s death by the 
Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, and thanked the Italian authorities. 
Italian and German politicians and officials praised the officers involved in 
the confrontation. 
 * Merkel ordered a security review, including an analysis of what went wrong, 
after it emerged that German authorities had tracked Amri for months over 
suspicions he was planning an attack. She said she had informed the Tunisian 
president, Beji Caid Essebsi, that Germany would be “significantly 
accelerating” deportation of rejected asylum seekers. 
 * Rightwing politicians, including France’s Marine Le Pen, Holland’s Geert 
Wilders, and the former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, have used the incident to 
rail at Europe’s open borders. Italian police have suggested that Amri “surely 
passed through France” and media reports suggest a French train ticket was 
found in his backpack. But there has been no official confirmation of the route 
he took or his means of transport.

Cristian Movio, 36, who was shot by Anis Amri, has paid tribute to his 
colleague, Luca Scata, who fired the shot that killed the Berlin attack suspect.

AFP reports that Movio praised his partner to one of his visitors in hospital. 
He is quoted as saying:

My partner’s actions were exemplary, he reacted immediately when the pistol 
came out.

After Movio was hit by a bullet in the shoulder, Scata, 29, fired twice in 
quick succession. Scata has only been in the police force for nine months and 
is three months into a probationary period in Milan, according to AFP.

Tunisia’s president has told the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that he 
firmly condemns the “cowardly terrorist act” in Berlin.

In a statement on Friday, Beji Caid Essebsi called for tighter cooperation to 
fight “the plague of terrorism that threatens the security and stability of all 
countries”.

The alleged attacker, Anis Amri, who was shot dead on Friday, was a Tunisian 
national. He was supposed to have been deported fromGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>, but authorities said they could 
not get the right papers from Tunisia.


Tunisian authorities say the reason it took so long to issue Amri’s papers is 
that they needed to carry out so many identity checks. Amri reportedly used at 
least six different names and three different nationalities in his travels 
aroundEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

French authorities are refusing to comment on how the Berlin attack suspect 
apparently crossed into France and left again in the face of an international 
manhunt, AP reports:

Milan police chief Antonio de Iesu said earlier that Anis Amri had ‘surely 
passed through France’, a country that has been living in a state of emergency 
for more than a year after deadly Islamic extremist attacks.

France upped security on the road borders with Germany after Monday’s 
Christmas market attack in Berlin and introduced extra security forces on 
trains last year afterAmerican passengers thwarted an attack on an 
Amsterdam-Paris route.
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/21/amsterdam-paris-train-gunman-france>

The interior ministry, prime minister’s office and president’s office would 
not comment on the Milan police announcement that Amri was found inItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> with a train ticket from Chambéry, 
France, the day before.

The French interior minister, Bruno Le Roux, visited a Paris train station on 
Friday morning to inspect security measures ahead of the Christmas holidays. He 
said more than 91,000 police and military forces were deployed across the 
country.

A German security official said the Berlin truck attack suspect has been 
linked to an extremist recruitment network allegedly run by a preacher arrested 
last month.

From AP:

Holger Münch, the head of the federal criminal police office, said that Anis 
Amri’s name ‘has come up in the past’ in connection with the network centring 
on a 32-year-old German-based Iraqi, Ahmad Abdulaziz Abdullah A, aka Abu Walaa. 
He would not elaborate.

Walaa was arrested on 8 November with four other men, accused of being the 
ringleader of a group whose aim was to steer people to Islamic State in Syria. 
Prosecutors say the network smuggled at least one young man and his family to 
Syria.

Amri’s killing is an international story, but it is also comes at a critical 
time in Italy’s domestic politics.

Paolo Gentiloni has been prime minister for nine days and had been consumed by 
a bank bailout of Monte dei Paschi di Siena just an hour before the shooting.

It did not take long for the issue to become a source of political controversy.

Beppe Grillo, the head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, joined 
Marine Le Pen, of France, Geert Wilders, of the Netherlands, and Nigel Farage, 
of Ukip, in using the incident to criticise Europe’s open border policy under 
Schengen,which he said needed to be “reviewed” <http://www.beppegrillo.it/>. He 
said:

It’s crazy that two ordinary officers should be put at risk and finding 
themselves having to deal with a terrorist wanted by half ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

The problem was the the result of a migrant crisis that was “out of control”, 
said Grillo.

The Five Star Movement has described itself as post-ideological, and neither 
left nor right in its political leanings. But Grillo’s response and evocation 
of the migrant crisis was in line with other rightwing leaders in Europe.

After he was approached by police, Amri told the officers that he did not have 
documents and that he was from Calabria, according to a report in La Repubblica.

The officers pressed him, however, and asked him to show them what was inside 
his backpack, at which point he slipped his hand into his bag and retrieved the 
gun, shooting Movio.

Luca Scatà returned fire and Amri fell to the ground. La Repubblica reported 
that he did not die instantly.

Rightwing politicians are queueing up to make hay out of Amri’s shooting in 
Milan.

“How about border controls?” asks Beatrix von Storch, MEP for the far-right 
Alternative forGermany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> party.
Beatrix von Storch (@Beatrix_vStorch)

Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan has also commented underneath a map which he 
claims shows Amri’s movements, although these have not been established and 
there has been no suggestion that he travelled through Paris:

The Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders> has joined Marine Le Pen and 
Nigel Farage in using Amri’s shooting in Italy to take a swipe at Schengen.

The Freedom party (PVV) leader, recently found guilty of inciting 
discrimination against Dutch Moroccans, tweeted:
Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) 
So Anis Amri enters EU as asylum seeker, commits terror in Germany and travels 
to Italy.

And closing our borders is a bad idea @MinPres <https://twitter.com/MinPres> ??

Amri made video pledging allegiance to Isis

The Berlin Christmas market attacker pledged his allegiance to Isis (Islamic 
State) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and called for Isis supporters to take 
revenge against “crusaders” bombing Muslims, a video posted on Amaq news agency

Merkel extends condolences to the families of those killed “for whom this 
Christmas will be a Christmas of deep sorrow”.

The death of Amri does not end the investigation, says the German chancellor. 
They will seek to find out who was helping him and covering his acts.

Merkel says she has asked for an investigation into “each and every aspect of 
the case of Mr Amri” as the case has raised a number of questions. Wherever 
there is a need for a political or legislative change, that will be done 
speedily, she pledges.

The chancellor says she spoke to the Tunisian president and the process of 
sending back Tunisian refugees fromGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> who have no right to stay will be 
speeded up. More need to be sent back, says Merkel.

We can be relieved that one acute threat has come to an end but the threat 
that comes from terrorism - that is a general threat - continues.

With that, the press conference ends.

Anglea Merkel says she was informed by the Italian prime minister that Amri 
was killed.

I thanked the Italian prime minister.

She wishes Cristian Movio, the Italian officer who was shot, a speedy recovery.

Terrorism is a challenge for all of us and it is good to see how resolutely 
and how well we work together acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, says Merkel.

Milan police say Cristian Movio, 36, the officer who was injured in the 
shootout with Amri, has had an operation on an injury to his right shoulder, AP 
reports. The surgeon says it was a superficial wound and that he was in good 
condition.

Movio managed to fire a round against his attacker but his partner, 
29-year-old Luca Scatà, fired the shot that killed Amri.

Scatà has only one year’s experience on the force. His shot to the chest 
killed Amri.

Milan’s police chief, Antonio De Iesu, said the officers became suspicious 
after noticing Amri alone outside a closed suburban Milan train station at 3am. 
When asked, Amri said he had no ID papers. He also had no phone and just a 
small pocket knife.

But De Iesu said he had a fully loaded 22-caliber pistol that he used against 
the officers. “He is a ghost,” De Iesu said, referring to Amri’s lack of 
documents or phone.

 * Anis Amri, the man believed to be behind the Berlin Christmas market attack 
that killed 12 people has been shot dead by Italian police. The Italian 
interior minister said he was on foot when he was stopped in Milan during a 
routine check. 
 * Amri opened fire when challenged, shooting one police officer, Cristian 
Movio, in the shoulder.The 36-year-old officer’s wound is not life-threatening 
and photographs have shown him sitting up and smiling in hospital. Another 
officer, Luca Scata, a 29-year-old who had been on the job for nine months, 
then shot and killed the suspected terrorist. 
 * A video of Amri pledging allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr 
al-Baghdadi has been published by the extremist group’s Amaq news agency. In it 
Amri calls for Isis supporters to take revenge against “crusaders” bombing 
Muslims.

 * The focus of the investigation into the Berlin attack is now on whether 
Amri had any assistance or accomplices, the country’s federal prosecutor, Peter 
Frank, said. 
 * The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was told of Amri’s death by the 
Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, and thanked the Italian authorities. 
Italian and German politicians and officials praised the officers involved in 
the confrontation. 
 * Merkel ordered a security review, including an analysis of what went wrong, 
after it emerged that German authorities had tracked Amri for months over 
suspicions he was planning an attack. She said she had informed the Tunisian 
president, Beji Caid Essebsi, that Germany would be “significantly 
accelerating” deportation of rejected asylum seekers. 
 * Rightwing politicians, including France’s Marine Le Pen, Holland’s Geert 
Wilders, and the former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, have used the incident to 
rail at Europe’s open borders. Italian police have suggested that Amri “surely 
passed through France” and media reports suggest a French train ticket was 
found in his backpack. But there has been no official confirmation of the route 
he took or his means of transport.  
Cristian Movio, 36, who was shot by Anis Amri, has paid tribute to his 
colleague, Luca Scata, who fired the shot that killed the Berlin attack suspect.

AFP reports that Movio praised his partner to one of his visitors in hospital. 
He is quoted as saying:

My partner’s actions were exemplary, he reacted immediately when the pistol 
came out.

After Movio was hit by a bullet in the shoulder, Scata, 29, fired twice in 
quick succession. Scata has only been in the police force for nine months and 
is three months into a probationary period in Milan, according to AFP.
 
Tunisia’s president has told the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that he 
firmly condemns the “cowardly terrorist act” in Berlin.

In a statement on Friday, Beji Caid Essebsi called for tighter cooperation to 
fight “the plague of terrorism that threatens the security and stability of all 
countries”.

The alleged attacker, Anis Amri, who was shot dead on Friday, was a Tunisian 
national. He was supposed to have been deported fromGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>, but authorities said they could 
not get the right papers from Tunisia.


Tunisian authorities say the reason it took so long to issue Amri’s papers is 
that they needed to carry out so many identity checks. Amri reportedly used at 
least six different names and three different nationalities in his travels 
aroundEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

 
French authorities are refusing to comment on how the Berlin attack suspect 
apparently crossed into France and left again in the face of an international 
manhunt, AP reports:

Milan police chief Antonio de Iesu said earlier that Anis Amri had ‘surely 
passed through France’, a country that has been living in a state of emergency 
for more than a year after deadly Islamic extremist attacks.

France upped security on the road borders with Germany after Monday’s 
Christmas market attack in Berlin and introduced extra security forces on 
trains last year afterAmerican passengers thwarted an attack on an 
Amsterdam-Paris route.
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/21/amsterdam-paris-train-gunman-france>

The interior ministry, prime minister’s office and president’s office would 
not comment on the Milan police announcement that Amri was found inItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> with a train ticket from Chambéry, 
France, the day before.

The French interior minister, Bruno Le Roux, visited a Paris train station on 
Friday morning to inspect security measures ahead of the Christmas holidays. He 
said more than 91,000 police and military forces were deployed across the 
country.
 
A German security official said the Berlin truck attack suspect has been 
linked to an extremist recruitment network allegedly run by a preacher arrested 
last month.

From AP:

Holger Münch, the head of the federal criminal police office, said that Anis 
Amri’s name ‘has come up in the past’ in connection with the network centring 
on a 32-year-old German-based Iraqi, Ahmad Abdulaziz Abdullah A, aka Abu Walaa. 
He would not elaborate.

Walaa was arrested on 8 November with four other men, accused of being the 
ringleader of a group whose aim was to steer people to Islamic State in Syria. 
Prosecutors say the network smuggled at least one young man and his family to 
Syria.

Amri’s killing is an international story, but it is also comes at a critical 
time in Italy’s domestic politics.

Paolo Gentiloni has been prime minister for nine days and had been consumed by 
a bank bailout of Monte dei Paschi di Siena just an hour before the shooting.

It did not take long for the issue to become a source of political controversy.

Beppe Grillo, the head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, joined 
Marine Le Pen, of France, Geert Wilders, of the Netherlands, and Nigel Farage, 
of Ukip, in using the incident to criticise Europe’s open border policy under 
Schengen,which he said needed to be “reviewed” <http://www.beppegrillo.it/>. He 
said:

It’s crazy that two ordinary officers should be put at risk and finding 
themselves having to deal with a terrorist wanted by half ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

The problem was the the result of a migrant crisis that was “out of control”, 
said Grillo.

The Five Star Movement has described itself as post-ideological, and neither 
left nor right in its political leanings. But Grillo’s response and evocation 
of the migrant crisis was in line with other rightwing leaders in Europe.
 
After he was approached by police, Amri told the officers that he did not have 
documents and that he was from Calabria, according to a report in La Repubblica.

The officers pressed him, however, and asked him to show them what was inside 
his backpack, at which point he slipped his hand into his bag and retrieved the 
gun, shooting Movio.

Luca Scatà returned fire and Amri fell to the ground. La Repubblica reported 
that he did not die instantly.
 
Rightwing politicians are queueing up to make hay out of Amri’s shooting in 
Milan.

Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan has also commented underneath a map which he 
claims shows Amri’s movements, although these have not been established and 
there has been no suggestion that he travelled through Paris:

The Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders> has joined Marine Le Pen and

The Freedom party (PVV) leader, recently found guilty of inciting 
discrimination against Dutch Moroccans, tweeted:
Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) 
So Anis Amri enters EU as asylum seeker, commits terror in Germany and travels 
to Italy.

And closing our borders is a bad idea @MinPres <https://twitter.com/MinPres> ??

The Berlin Christmas market attacker pledged his allegiance to Isis (Islamic 
State) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and called for Isis supporters to take 
revenge against “crusaders” bombing Muslims, a video posted on Amaq news agency 
showed, according to Reuters.

Merkel extends condolences to the families of those killed “for whom this 
Christmas will be a Christmas of deep sorrow”.

The death of Amri does not end the investigation, says the German chancellor. 
They will seek to find out who was helping him and covering his acts.

Merkel says she has asked for an investigation into “each and every aspect of 
the case of Mr Amri” as the case has raised a number of questions. Wherever 
there is a need for a political or legislative change, that will be done 
speedily, she pledges.

The chancellor says she spoke to the Tunisian president and the process of 
sending back Tunisian refugees fromGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> who have no right to stay will be 
speeded up. More need to be sent back, says Merkel.

We can be relieved that one acute threat has come to an end but the threat 
that comes from terrorism - that is a general threat - continues.

With that, the press conference ends.

Anglea Merkel says she was informed by the Italian prime minister that Amri 
was killed.

I thanked the Italian prime minister.

She wishes Cristian Movio, the Italian officer who was shot, a speedy recovery.

Terrorism is a challenge for all of us and it is good to see how resolutely 
and how well we work together acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, says Merkel.
 
Milan police say Cristian Movio, 36, the officer who was injured in the 
shootout with Amri, has had an operation on an injury to his right shoulder, AP 
reports. The surgeon says it was a superficial wound and that he was in good 
condition.

Movio managed to fire a round against his attacker but his partner, 
29-year-old Luca Scatà, fired the shot that killed Amri.

Scatà has only one year’s experience on the force. His shot to the chest 
killed Amri.

Milan’s police chief, Antonio De Iesu, said the officers became suspicious 
after noticing Amri alone outside a closed suburban Milan train station at 3am. 
When asked, Amri said he had no ID papers. He also had no phone and just a 
small pocket knife.

But De Iesu said he had a fully loaded 22-caliber pistol that he used against 
the officers. “He is a ghost,” De Iesu said, referring to Amri’s lack of 
documents or phone.

 
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is expected to make a statement at 3pm 
(2pm GMT).
