Dear Freda, 

 I am dreading returning to work after the Christmas/ New Year break. I've 
been in the same job for five years and am finding it increasingly difficult to 
motivate myself. It's worse after such a long break. I don't want to change 
jobs, and I suspect that I would find the same problem wherever I worked. What 
can I do to make myself feel more positive and contented in my job?

This is a problem for many people. January is the time of highest staff 
turnover for many organisations, probably because people have had time to 
reflect on their work and what they want out of it. I agree with your suspicion 
that demotivation could easily follow you from job to job, and it is a good 
idea to tackle it now. Here are a few ideas, some of which are particularly 
relevant to this time of year.

 Start by catching up on all those jobs, such as filing, that one always puts 
off. Then tidy your desk so that only essential items take up space. Try to get 
ahead with predictable jobs. You will feel more positive if there's no work 
backlog, and your desk is fresh and welcoming.

 Make notes of the things you like about your job and those you don't like. 
See if you can approach some of the negative items differently. If you can't 
get rid of the things you don't enjoy, allocate a specific time of the week, 
such as a Monday morning, to tackle them so that they do not accumulate.

 If you have a programme of training and development, examine it and identify 
areas that you can get ahead in. You could allocate yourself study time, such 
as a half-hour of your lunch break, and get relevant books from your local 
library. You'll feel good about yourself if you already have background 
knowledge before you attend courses, and you'll get more out of them, too.

 If you haven't planned any training and development, now is the time to do 
it. Set yourself two or three learning goals for the coming year.

 Finally, I find it helps to remember that most other people, including your 
manager, will be feeling the same. Maybe you could help colleagues to 
remotivate themselves, too. And plan ahead for 2000. It could be even more of a 
challenge to come back to 'normality' after such a historic event.
