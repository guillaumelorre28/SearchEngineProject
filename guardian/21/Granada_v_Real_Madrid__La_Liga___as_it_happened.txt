A hard luck story, then, for a very lively and entertaining Granada. They 
deservedly equalised on the hour when El Arabi, just on as a substitute, 
finished neatly after a referee-aided counterattack. After that they looked the 
likely winners for some time, but perhaps Penaranda’s withdrawal – the less 
offensively-minded Doucoure replaced him – invited Real on slightly. Still, it 
took a quite wonderful finish from Modric, who was outstanding throughout, to 
win the game and illuminate an otherwise stodgy Real performance. It was good 
fun, but at the end of the day it also showed why these teams are at opposite 
ends of the table. Granada just weren’t quite clinical enough up top and were 
made to pay at the back. That’s all for tonight – thanks for your company!

Full-time: Granada 1-2 Real Madrid

That’s a wrap. Real win away from home – but they were fortunate.

90+2 min: Benzema gets Real all the way up the pitch and wins a corner, that 
probably won’t travel that far. And indeed doesn’t. Keepball near the flag, 
until Granada get a foot in and clear.

87 min: Zidane introduces Nacho in Carvajal’s place. You just wonder if 
Granada paid for sitting off there, for the first time in the match. Bringing 
Doucoure on for Penaranda was a bit of a conservative move and Real took 
advantage within minutes. The scoreline is so hard on the home team but it’s 
the kind of thing that happens when you’re down at the bottom.

Goal! Granada 1-2 Real Madrid (Modric 85)

But they make it count! Modric, the best player on the park, receives the ball 
25 yards out in a central position and arrows an absolutelytremendous shot plum 
into Fernandez’s top right corner. Unstoppable. What a goal! They don’t deserve 
it, but that was brilliant.

84 min: Benzema is found by Kovacic in space and dinks a cross in from the 
right, but it’s headed away. Real putting a little pressure on now. They 
haven’t managed too much of it in sustained spells.

83 min: Rochina breaks across the halfway line and Carvajal tugs him back 
cynically. Wasn’t too much need for that; it probably tells you how rattled 
Real have been here.

82 min: Doucoure nearly bundles a way through immediately but Carvajal is in 
quickly to block. The pace has just dropped off a tiny bit here. Granada 
probably wouldn’t want to let a point slip by going in too strong, although 
their approach throughout has been a joy.

77 min: Success is sprung down the right by a super, clipped Rochina pass, but 
crosses beyond everybody. Chance wasted there. Now Granada make a second change 
and Rico is replaced by the Slovenian, Rene Krhin.

75 min: And now it’s Marcelo, passing to absolutely nobody down the left 
flank, who can’t keep the ball in play. Real don’t look happy. Granada look 
vibrant. But none of that guarantees anything.

the overlapping Isco and the ball ends up going out for a goal kick.

73 min: Big shouts for a Granada penalty! Success is played in by a lovely 
Penaranda pass and tries to go round Navas. He goes down ... but a replay shows 
that the ‘keeper got a hand to the ball! Good decision, as at full speed it 
looked as if Success had a solid case.

71 min: Success wins a corner from Modric. Could this be a chance for a second 
goal? Yes! No! El Arabi finds the net after touching in Lomban’s header from 
the flag kick ... but he’s a yard offside!

68 min: Real could – should – have gone 2-0 up through Benzema just before the 
goal but one or two of them have been missing in action really, James Rodriguez 
and Toni Kroos in particular. Modric, though, picks out Ronaldo wonderfully but 
his centre from the left is cut out.

but Foulquier’s pass sells Rico short and the midfielder ends up impeding 
Carvajal.

62 min: Ramos is booked for a foul on El Arabi. Have to say, much as the 
referee gets a pre-assist for that goal it came after some excellent pressing 
from the Granada forwards. Just before Modric was mugged, Success had almost 
done the same to Ramos.

Goal! Granada 1-1 Real Madrid (El Arabi 60)

The substitute scores immediately! Wow! It comes after Modric, pressed by 
Rochina, loses the ball just inside his own half. The referee seems to get in 
his way! Rochina doesn’t hang around to worry, laying the ball right to El 
Arabi. He has plenty to do – the angle, on the right, is narrow and Navas is 
out sharply. But he slips the ball under him and it rolls into the net, with 
Carvajal unable to keep it out. They really deserve it!

57 min: How is that not 2-0? Granada give the ball away in a silly area and 
Modric, probably Real’s best player, slips the ball through for Benzema. He is 
one on one, 10 yards out, and a goal seems inevitable. It’s not really a poor 
finish but Fernandez, staying big and strong and not committing too early, gets 
down to his right and saves brilliantly.

55 min: Modric has a 15-yard shot blocked and Benzema lashes the rebound, from 
an angle, into the side netting. It all comes about after Carvajal, seemingly 
offside, finds a lot of time and space deep inside the box while the home 
defenders wait for a flag. Play to the whistle!

54 min: Success seems to have forced Marcelo into an error after the left-back 
slips and is rather unlucky to be adjudged to have fouled him. He’d have been 
through.

53 min: Another glimmer for Granada, as Rochina seems for a moment to be 
through on goal before Varane gets in adroitly to intervene. Perhaps he could 
have shot earlier ... something he does from range a few moments later, hitting 
one not too far over from 25 yards.

48 min: Ooh, and now it’s Fernandez, the home ‘keeper, who is called into 
serious action for the first time in the game. He dives to punch a left-sided 
cross away and it’s returned with interest by Modric, 25 yards out, who shows 
superb technique to send a volley back towards goal. But Fernandez is up 
quickly to tip the ball acrobatically over his bar – and the corner is defended.

47 min: Marcelo almost gifts Granada a way back in. He tries to keep a Navas 
clearance in play and really shouldn’t bother – he ends up knocking the ball 
back towards his own goal and to Success, who hares into the area, cuts inside 
and shoots wide via a deflection. Should he have squared to a free man on the 
edge of the box? Probably. From the corner they go close again! Barral gets up 
at the back post and Navas has to fling himself to his right to parry. Fine 
start here from Granada!

Half-time: Granada 0-1 Real Madrid

Well that was fun and Real are a bit lucky to be ahead there. Benzema’s goal 
came after some slack defending on Granada’s left side and you wonder if that 
is the season’s story for a home team that has played some scintillating stuff 
going forward without quite finding a cutting edge. But they’ll be encouraged: 
there have been openings and Real haven’t really got into a rhythm despite 
seeing much more of the ball after scoring. It’s a good game, this, and 
there’ll be more of it to come in 15 minutes.

44 min: Super play by Granada down the right sees Lopes released inside the 
box by Success. He has a clear shot at goal, but skews it and it bobbles across 
and in front of Barral. It was neither one thing nor the other really, and it’s 
another good position spurned. At the other end, Isco lashes well over.

42 min: Real have had 63% of possession here, much of it since they scored. 
Granada are, more and more, having to operate on the counter.

40 min: Half a chance for Barral, who is found by a Rico cutback and sees his 
shot, eight yards out, blocked crucially by a brave Varane. Granada then win a 
corner and Rochina’s devilish delivery is fisted away by Navas.

38 min: Real continuing to knock the ball about, although as I say that 
Ronaldo is flagged offside. It would suit them to slow the tempo down a bit 
here. Things almost quicken at the other end but Rochina’s through ball towards 
Success is deflected away from harm.

36 min: A spell of possession here for Real, although Granada’s front three 
continue to press well. Not over by a long shot, this, although you can’t see 
the visitors not getting more chances.

34 min: A super, sweeping move from Granada perks things up and ends with 
Success, playing a one-two with Rico, thudding to the floor inside the box. 
Never a penalty – Ramos won the ball perfectly.

Goal! Granada 0-1 Real Madrid (Benzema 30)

That is probably why Granada are struggling. Not for the first time, the 
left-back Foulquier leaves too much space behind him and Penaranda is in no 
position to track. Carvajal, fed by Modric, gets into acres of space behind 
them and his low centre is converted with no fuss by Benzema, right in front of 
goal. Really, really bad defending.

30 min: Still nice and watchable, this. Penaranda gets in a spot of bother 
dribbling back towards his own goal but shows admirable cool to float a pass 
across the penalty area to Costa, who greets it with a sliced clearance.

A hard luck story, then, for a very lively and entertaining Granada. They 
deservedly equalised on the hour when El Arabi, just on as a substitute, 
finished neatly after a referee-aided counterattack. After that they looked the 
likely winners for some time, but perhaps Penaranda’s withdrawal – the less 
offensively-minded Doucoure replaced him – invited Real on slightly. Still, it 
took a quite wonderful finish from Modric, who was outstanding throughout, to 
win the game and illuminate an otherwise stodgy Real performance. It was good 
fun, but at the end of the day it also showed why these teams are at opposite 
ends of the table. Granada just weren’t quite clinical enough up top and were 
made to pay at the back. That’s all for tonight – thanks for your company!
 
That’s a wrap. Real win away from home – but they were fortunate.
 
90+2 min: Benzema gets Real all the way up the pitch and wins a corner, that 
probably won’t travel that far. And indeed doesn’t. Keepball near the flag, 
until Granada get a foot in and clear.
 
90+1 min: Delivered by Rochina but Varane, who has played well, heads away. 
Three minutes of added time here, in total.
 
90 min: Dangerous free kick to Granada after a Modric foul just outside the 
area on the left...
 
88 min: Rochina tries to get away down the left but can’t keep the ball in. 
Granada’s fire may well have been extinguished.
 
87 min: Zidane introduces Nacho in Carvajal’s place. You just wonder if 
Granada paid for sitting off there, for the first time in the match. Bringing 
Doucoure on for Penaranda was a bit of a conservative move and Real took 
advantage within minutes. The scoreline is so hard on the home team but it’s 
the kind of thing that happens when you’re down at the bottom.
 
But they make it count! Modric, the best player on the park, receives the ball 
25 yards out in a central position and arrows an absolutelytremendous shot plum 
into Fernandez’s top right corner. Unstoppable. What a goal! They don’t deserve 
it, but that was brilliant.
 
84 min: Benzema is found by Kovacic in space and dinks a cross in from the 
right, but it’s headed away. Real putting a little pressure on now. They 
haven’t managed too much of it in sustained spells.
 
83 min: Rochina breaks across the halfway line and Carvajal tugs him back 
cynically. Wasn’t too much need for that; it probably tells you how rattled 
Real have been here.
 
82 min: Doucoure nearly bundles a way through immediately but Carvajal is in 
quickly to block. The pace has just dropped off a tiny bit here. Granada 
probably wouldn’t want to let a point slip by going in too strong, although 
their approach throughout has been a joy.
 
81 min: A third Granada change. The Watford loan midfielder, Doucoure, 
replaces the Watford loan forward, Penaranda, who looks one heck of a player.
 
80 min: Varane is the latest Real player to play a pass straight off the 
pitch. They’re stumbling towards an unsatisfactory draw here.
 
78 min: Jese, on for the anonymous James a couple of minutes ago, has a shot 
deflected over. Then Real make a second change, Kovacic on for Isco.
 
77 min: Success is sprung down the right by a super, clipped Rochina pass, but 
crosses beyond everybody. Chance wasted there. Now Granada make a second change 
and Rico is replaced by the Slovenian, Rene Krhin.
 
75 min: And now it’s Marcelo, passing to absolutely nobody down the left 
flank, who can’t keep the ball in play. Real don’t look happy. Granada look 
vibrant. But none of that guarantees anything.
 
74 min: Ronaldo, really not at his best tonight, plays a really sloppy ball to 
the overlapping Isco and the ball ends up going out for a goal kick.
 
73 min: Big shouts for a Granada penalty! Success is played in by a lovely 
Penaranda pass and tries to go round Navas. He goes down ... but a replay shows 
that the ‘keeper got a hand to the ball! Good decision, as at full speed it 
looked as if Success had a solid case.
 
71 min: Success wins a corner from Modric. Could this be a chance for a second 
goal? Yes! No! El Arabi finds the net after touching in Lomban’s header from 
the flag kick ... but he’s a yard offside!
 
70 min: Carvajal comes off worse in an aerial challenge but, after a brief 
stoppage, seems to be alright.
 
69 min: From the resulting Modric corner, Ramos runs around the back but can’t 
keep his header down.
 
68 min: Real could – should – have gone 2-0 up through Benzema just before the 
goal but one or two of them have been missing in action really, James Rodriguez 
and Toni Kroos in particular. Modric, though, picks out Ronaldo wonderfully but 
his centre from the left is cut out.
 
66 min: The stadium is rocking now. They nearly have another attack to enjoy 
but Foulquier’s pass sells Rico short and the midfielder ends up impeding 
Carvajal.
 
64 min: Rochina tries to make it his but fouls Varane as the two compete for a 
through ball.
 
63 min: What an enthralling game this is now. Could be anyone’s.
 
62 min: Ramos is booked for a foul on El Arabi. Have to say, much as the 
referee gets a pre-assist for that goal it came after some excellent pressing 
from the Granada forwards. Just before Modric was mugged, Success had almost 
done the same to Ramos.

The substitute scores immediately! Wow! It comes after Modric, pressed by 
Rochina, loses the ball just inside his own half. The referee seems to get in 
his way! Rochina doesn’t hang around to worry, laying the ball right to El 
Arabi. He has plenty to do – the angle, on the right, is narrow and Navas is 
out sharply. But he slips the ball under him and it rolls into the net, with 
Carvajal unable to keep it out. They really deserve it!
 
58 min: A change up top for Granada – El Arabi replaces Barral, who had that 
header saved earlier.
 
57 min: How is that not 2-0? Granada give the ball away in a silly area and 
Modric, probably Real’s best player, slips the ball through for Benzema. He is 
one on one, 10 yards out, and a goal seems inevitable. It’s not really a poor 
finish but Fernandez, staying big and strong and not committing too early, gets 
down to his right and saves brilliantly.
 
55 min: Modric has a 15-yard shot blocked and Benzema lashes the rebound, from 
an angle, into the side netting. It all comes about after Carvajal, seemingly 
offside, finds a lot of time and space deep inside the box while the home 
defenders wait for a flag. Play to the whistle!
 
54 min: Success seems to have forced Marcelo into an error after the left-back 
slips and is rather unlucky to be adjudged to have fouled him. He’d have been 
through.
 
53 min: Another glimmer for Granada, as Rochina seems for a moment to be 
through on goal before Varane gets in adroitly to intervene. Perhaps he could 
have shot earlier ... something he does from range a few moments later, hitting 
one not too far over from 25 yards.
 
52 min: Isco, livelier in the first few minutes of this half, tries to nudge 
Benzema through but the striker isn’t really expecting it.
 
50 min: Ramos stands up to stop Lopes bursting into the box. This half has 
started at a right old tempo.
 
48 min: Ooh, and now it’s Fernandez, the home ‘keeper, who is called into 
serious action for the first time in the game. He dives to punch a left-sided 
cross away and it’s returned with interest by Modric, 25 yards out, who shows 
superb technique to send a volley back towards goal. But Fernandez is up 
quickly to tip the ball acrobatically over his bar – and the corner is defended.
 
47 min: Marcelo almost gifts Granada a way back in. He tries to keep a Navas 
clearance in play and really shouldn’t bother – he ends up knocking the ball 
back towards his own goal and to Success, who hares into the area, cuts inside 
and shoots wide via a deflection. Should he have squared to a free man on the 
edge of the box? Probably. From the corner they go close again! Barral gets up 
at the back post and Navas has to fling himself to his right to parry. Fine 
start here from Granada!
 
Now Real, all in blue, get us going.

Well that was fun and Real are a bit lucky to be ahead there. Benzema’s goal 
came after some slack defending on Granada’s left side and you wonder if that 
is the season’s story for a home team that has played some scintillating stuff 
going forward without quite finding a cutting edge. But they’ll be encouraged: 
there have been openings and Real haven’t really got into a rhythm despite 
seeing much more of the ball after scoring. It’s a good game, this, and 
there’ll be more of it to come in 15 minutes.

44 min: Super play by Granada down the right sees Lopes released inside the 
box by Success. He has a clear shot at goal, but skews it and it bobbles across 
and in front of Barral. It was neither one thing nor the other really, and it’s 
another good position spurned. At the other end, Isco lashes well over.
 
42 min: Real have had 63% of possession here, much of it since they scored. 
Granada are, more and more, having to operate on the counter.
 
40 min: Half a chance for Barral, who is found by a Rico cutback and sees his 
shot, eight yards out, blocked crucially by a brave Varane. Granada then win a 
corner and Rochina’s devilish delivery is fisted away by Navas.
 
38 min: Real continuing to knock the ball about, although as I say that 
Ronaldo is flagged offside. It would suit them to slow the tempo down a bit 
here. Things almost quicken at the other end but Rochina’s through ball towards 
Success is deflected away from harm.
 
36 min: A spell of possession here for Real, although Granada’s front three 
continue to press well. Not over by a long shot, this, although you can’t see 
the visitors not getting more chances.
 
34 min: A super, sweeping move from Granada perks things up and ends with 
Success, playing a one-two with Rico, thudding to the floor inside the box. 
Never a penalty – Ramos won the ball perfectly.
 
32 min: Now Perez is booked and we’ll see quickly enough how Granada, so 
positive thus far, respond to adversity.
 
That is probably why Granada are struggling. Not for the first time, the 
left-back Foulquier leaves too much space behind him and Penaranda is in no 
position to track. Carvajal, fed by Modric, gets into acres of space behind 
them and his low centre is converted with no fuss by Benzema, right in front of 
goal. Really, really bad defending.

30 min: Still nice and watchable, this. Penaranda gets in a spot of bother 
dribbling back towards his own goal but shows admirable cool to float a pass 
across the penalty area to Costa, who greets it with a sliced clearance.
 
29 min: Ronaldo takes on Lopes and is tackled briskly. Corner to Real on the 
left, from which a low Ronaldo shot is booted clear.
 
28 min: There’s definitely a sense that, for the great positions Granada have 
got themselves into, their final ball should probably have been better.
 
27 min: Success is prominent again, arrowing a cross towards Rochina, but it’s 
just behind the attacking midfielder and all he can do is backheel it up into 
the air.
 
26 min: Foulquier, a right-footed left-back, twists Carvajal’s blood, leaves 
him on his backside and whips in a cross-shot that Ramos clears.
