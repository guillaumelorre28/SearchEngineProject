One in 13 restaurants and one in seven takeaways in the UK have failed food 
hygiene inspections because they are dirty or have poor procedures, Guardian 
analysis shows.

Examination of the food hygiene reports for more than 460,000 businesses found 
that almost 30,000, or 6.4%, had failed their inspections, including more than 
7,000 takeaways and 8,000 restaurants.

The Food Standards Agency <http://www.food.gov.uk/> data also reveals huge 
food safety problems 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/23/filthy-conditions-mice-uk-worst-restaurants-food-hygiene>
 in some areas of the country, with some local authorities failing more than 
20% of food establishments and about 50% of takeaways and sandwich shops.

The FSA ranks all food providers with a score of zero to five. A zero rating 
signifies that the establishment “urgently requires improvement”: about 1,400 
businesses currently have this score. Between zero and two is considered a 
failing grade, and three to five is satisfactory.

 The ratings criteria are the same across England, Wales and Northern Ireland 
and each local authority is responsible for ranking food providers within its 
boundaries.Scotland uses a different system 
<http://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/food-safety-standards/food-safety-hygiene/food-hygiene-information-scheme>
, awarding a grade of “pass and eat” to premises that exceed legal requirements 
of hygiene, “pass” to those that are broadly compliant, or “improvement 
required”.

The analysis revealed huge disparities in hygiene levels around the country, 
with some local authorities failing large numbers of food establishments and 
others failing only a handful.

The 10 best areas in the country, ranked by the proportion of food premises 
that pass inspections, are the Orkney Islands, north Devon, South Ayrshire, 
Torridge, Harrogate, Cannock Chase, west Dorset, Suffolk coastal, Anglesey and 
Daventry.

The 10 worst areas in the country are Newham, Edinburgh, the Shetland Islands, 
Islington, Hyndburn, Harrow, Hertsmere, Midlothian, Luton and Ealing.

The scores also varied across countries and regions. Ten per cent of 
establishments in Scotland have been awarded a failing grade (improvement 
required), compared with 6% in England, 5% in Wales and 2% inNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>.


Businesses are not required to display their food hygiene scores in England and
Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>. In November 2013, Wales 
made it mandatory for food establishments to publicly display their ratings, 
which led to a significant improvement in safety. This mandatory display policy 
will be introduced in Northern Ireland on 7 October.

Schools, colleges and universities received the best scores nationwide of any 
type of food establishment, with less than than 1% given a failing rating. 
Takeaways and sandwich shops received the worst scores, with 15% judged to be 
below par.

There are 32 local authorities where more than 25% of takeaways failed to pass 
food safety inspections. Newham in eastLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> had the highest fail rate for takeaways 
(50.4%), meaning that customers there were more likely to walk into a takeaway 
that had failed its inspection than one that had passed. A high proportion of 
takeaways also failed in Epsom and Ewell (46.2%), Edinburgh (38.2%), Manchester 
(34%), Birmingham (33.8%) and Islington (32.2%).

Newham also had the worst overall results in London, with 26% of businesses in 
the borough receiving a score of zero to two.

Only 73 businesses in the country have the worst possible score (a zero 
overall) and maximum marks (80 out of 80) for concerns about food hygiene, the 
structure of premises and confidence in management. Of these, 35 are in 
Birmingham.

While cafe and restaurant chains tended to have very high safety and hygiene 
ratings, several branches of large chains currently have the worst possible 
score: Chopstix Noodle Bar in Liverpool, the Poundbakery and Poundcafe at St 
John’s shopping centre in Liverpool; the Adelphi hotel in Liverpool, which is 
part of the Britannia Hotels group, and a Costcutter supermarket in Great 
Hampton Row, Birmingham.


Poundbakery and Poundcafe, Chopstix Noodle Bar and Costcutter said the 
branches had closed temporarily to deal with hygiene issues, but have since 
reopened and been deemed to have addressed urgent concerns, and are awaiting 
inspections to rescore their premises. The Adelphi did not wish to comment.

While a zero-rated restaurant will not necessarily be shut down, it will be 
subject to follow-up inspections and required to address urgent concerns within 
28 days of the original visit. The business can then either pay £160 to be 
reassessed or wait until its next scheduled assessment, usually about six 
months later, to potentially be given a new score.

Matthew Collins, a principal environmental health officer at Newham council, 
said a score of zero had to be taken seriously as it indicated a “cumulative 
failure of management”.

“That would be a failure to keep clean, a failure to maintain accurate 
temperatures, a failure to disinfect and a failure to have any constructive 
plan to manage it and/or an infestation of pests. It would be a premises you’d 
walk into and you’d draw breath,” he said.

“We’re talking about premises we’ve been into where there’s sewage running 
over the floor, or you stand there and you see something moving out of the 
corner of your eye, combined with management that have no hold on how to 
rectify the situation and have obviously let it get into a bad situation with 
no plan for the future. It’s bad.”

Michael Harding, a food hygiene rating scheme support officer at the FSA, 
said: “I wouldn’t eat at a zero-rated business. The message from the FSA would 
be: ‘If it’s got a zero, don’t take the risk.’ Ninety-four per cent of food 
businesses have a rating of three or better, so there is plenty of choice to 
eat at a place where they take food hygiene more seriously.”

David Pierce, a food safety inspector for 13 years and the principal 
environmental health officer at Rossendale borough council in Lancashire, said 
there were a number of reasons for the varying scores across authorities. “You 
need to look at the types of businesses. A five in a pub, which just does wet 
sales [drinks], is different to a five in a restaurant; it’s easier to meet the 
requirements,” he said.

Inspectors can take legal action against businesses that fail to meet 
standards. In the year ending April 2016, more than 100 successful prosecutions 
were concluded against food businesses, resulting in penalties of community 
service, suspended sentences, fines of up to £90,000 and, in one instance, a 
three-month prison term.

In 2014-15, more than 160,000 food hygiene enforcement actions were issued 
nationwide, most of which were written warnings (businesses can be issued with 
multiple actions). Other sanctions included more than 1,000 cases of voluntary 
closure – in which an establishment agrees to shut while it improves standards 
– 416 cases of the seizure, detention and surrender of food, and 26 instances 
of a suspension or revocation of approval of licence.

Food premises can be inspected as regularly as every six months. For 
lower-risk businesses, or those with repeatedly high scores, the frequency of 
inspections can be reduced to once every few years.

Enforcement officers also follow up complaints made by the public. In the year 
ending March 2015, there were more than 70,000 customer grievances about food 
establishments. Pierce’s team of inspectors in Rossendale most commonly receive 
complaints about Indian takeaways, which he described as “unfair”.

“People make these assumptions. Asian food is far more heavily spiced and 
people don’t necessarily take into account [that] the spicy nature of the food 
might have an effect on them. The other thing they say is: ‘It was the last 
thing I ate.’ But they ate it at 2am after six pints and they wonder why they 
feel sick in the morning,” he said.

However, food safety officers also deal with legitimate complaints, from the 
relatively minor – one of Pierce’s team is investigating how a sticking plaster 
found its way on to a customer’s pizza – to more serious incidents, such asE 
coli in mixed salad leaves
