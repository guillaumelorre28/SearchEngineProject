West Ham arrive with nine points from nine while Leicester are looking to 
finish off the year in which they won the title with a win to stay out of the 
bottom three. “Considering where they were four seasons ago, it’s quite a 
normal situation for them,” said Slaven Bilic. To that end, City are helped by 
the returns from suspension of Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs.Mark Tallentire
