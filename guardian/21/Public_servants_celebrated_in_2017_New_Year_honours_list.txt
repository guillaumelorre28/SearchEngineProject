Mark Lowcock, permanent secretary of the Department for International 
Development (DfID), and David Beamish, the most senior official in the House of 
Lords, are both made Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 2017
New Year honours list <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/new-year-honours-list>: 
two of many public servants celebrated for their public service.

Lowcock has held the most senior civil service job in DfID since 2011. He 
recently told Civil Service World 
<https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/interview/dfid-perm-sec-mark-lowcock-funny-old-year-and-theresa-mays-%E2%80%9Cglobal-britain%E2%80%9D>
 that 2016 had been “a funny old year”, but highlighted the first anniversary 
of Sierra Leone being Ebola-free as “an inspiring reminder of what the civil 
service at its best can achieve: committed, adaptable and highly-skilled people 
joining up to contain an epidemic”.


Beamish has had a long career working in parliament, having joined the Lords 
as a clerk in 1974. Since 2011 he has been clerk of the parliaments, the most 
senior official in the Lords. As clerk of committees, he led a significant 
increase in committee activity, enhancing the house’s ability to scrutinise the 
work of government.

Politicians also feature, including Baroness Shirley Williams, a leading 
figure in British political life for more than 50 years, who becomes a 
Companion of Honour, and Vera Baird QC, Labour police and crime commissioner 
(PCC) for Northumbria, who becomes a dame. Baird is celebrated for a lifetime’s 
work “ensuring that those who have suffered previously ignored forms of 
violence are supported and given a voice”. Baird served as MP for Redcar from 
2001-10 and was first elected PCC in Northumbria in 2012.

This year’s list included 603 women, just over 50% of the total, and 116 
people from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background. At 9.3%, that 
is the greatest-ever number of BAME recipients in an honours list, according to 
the Cabinet Office.

David Behan, who has been chief executive of the Care Quality Commission since 
2012, receives a knighthood, as does David Sloman, chief executive of the Royal 
Free London NHS Foundation Trust. Those working in health account for 7% of the 
honours. About 10% of honours are for work in education, including 26 
headteachers. Baroness Warnock becomes a Companion of Honour, and there is a 
damehood for Helen Fraser, lately chief executive of theGirls’ Day School Trust.

Administration in England.Full details here

British Antarctic Survey, and a knighthood for Iain MacLeod, legal adviser at 
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
