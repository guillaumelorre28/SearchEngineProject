South Africa’s national airline has apologised to Tyrone Pillay, the country’s 
medal-winning Paralympic shot-putter, after he was prevented from boarding a 
flight with his spare prosthetic leg, a spokesman has said.

The incident happened on Tuesday as Pillay was returning from the Paralympic 
Games <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics-2016> in Rio de Janeiro, 
Brazil, where he won a bronze medal.

Pillay revealed on Twitter that a member of South African Airways (SAA) staff 
had stopped him boarding a connecting flight from Johannesburg to Durban, his 
hometown, while carrying his spare prosthesis.

“Terrible treatment of a Paralympic athlete as the staff refuse to allow my 
prosthetic leg on board,”he tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/pillaytyrone/status/778169023502704640>.

“Can’t believe I get treated like this after winning a medal for our country. 
Totally disrespectful.”

He had been allowed to board an SAA flight from São Paulo to Johannesburg with 
his prosthetic leg as his carry-on luggage. SAA was the official carrier of the 
South African team to the Games.

On Wednesday, airline spokesman Tlali Tlali said the incident had “left all of 
us with a terrible aftertaste”.

“SAA has already made contact with Mr Pillay and we have apologised to him 
<https://twitter.com/pillaytyrone/status/778283220068696064>,” Tlali added.

The spokesman said the prosthesis should have been treated as carry-on luggage 
or an assistive device. The airline is investigating the incident.

Pillay was born with an abnormality on his left foot and requires assistance 
with walking.
