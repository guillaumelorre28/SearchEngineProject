Scott Morrison has asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to 
investigate the national dairy industry as the agriculture minister,Barnaby 
Joyce <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/barnaby-joyce>, emerged from 
a dairy crisis meeting declaring the days of $1-a-litre milk had to end.

The industry study comes as the ACCC completes a more specific investigation 
into Murray Goulburn and Fonterra after the milk processors slashed farm gate 
prices and applied the cut retrospectively. That investigation is looking at 
whether conduct was misleading or unconscionable.


The chairman of the ACCC, Rod Sims, said the market study announced on 
Thursday could have three outcomes: it could find breaches of the act; make 
recommendations for government; or simply show what was working well and what 
was working badly in the dairy industry.

“A market study looks at whether the market is functioning well,” he said. “It 
could uncover breaches or it may find there was no breach of the act but at the 
same time find it’s not working well.”

The ACCC announcement came after Joyce called dairy farmers, processors and 
supermarket giants Coles andWoolworths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/woolworths-australia> together to address 
the issues raised by the dairy crisis.

Joyce said the discussions focused on two points: government assistance 
through existing farm household allowance, and concessional loans and systems 
which would create more transparency in pricing and contracts between 
processors and farmers.

“Our dairy farmers deserve fair returns at the farm gate, as well as 
transparency in milk price arrangements and supply contracts, which is why I 
can announce the ACCC will undertake a detailed inquiry into our national dairy 
industry,” Joyce said.

“An in-depth and independent inquiry is a thorough and fair way to uncover 
inefficiencies and inequities that our farmers face – and identify a way 
forward.”


The inquiry will begin in November and report in the second half of 2017. It 
will look at risk sharing along the supply chain, supply agreements and 
contracts, competition, bargaining and trading practices in the industry and 
the effect of world and retail prices on profitability.


Joyce’s harshest comments outside the meeting were aimed at Coles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/coles> and Woolworths over $1-a-litre 
milk as he warned the supermarkets to “solve the problem yourself” or face 
government intervention.

He reserved the right to intervene if the issue was not solved. 

“You can solve the issue yourself but if you choose not to, don’t complain 
about the clumsy fingers of government coming in to deal with it, and I do 
absolutely reserve that right,” Joyce said.

He said New Zealand produced 19bn litres of milk a year – more than 
Australia’s 9.7bn 
<http://www.dairyaustralia.com.au/Markets-and-statistics/Farm-facts/Dairy-at-a-glance.aspx>
 litres – yet New Zealand milk was more expensive.

“The days of a $1-a-litre milk have got to finish because it just sends all 
the wrong messages,” Joyce said.

“Even the consumers are turning off it because they just say all I’m doing 
when I am doing that is buying a form of exploitation.

“I don’t want to be a part of it. I am happy to pay an extra 50, 60 cents, 
whatever it is. I don’t need some farmer working for $5 an hour for me to put 
milk on my Weeties.”

Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon called on Joyce to “muscle-up” to Murray Goulburn on 
behalf of struggling farmers as the co-op celebratedits increased profit 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-24/dairy-processors-financial-results/7779442>
 worth $40m rather than trying to distract with $1-a-litre milk.

“Everyone hates $1 milk including me, and Barnaby Joyce knows it’s a perfect 
distraction from his failure to do anything about the Murray Goulburn crisis,” 
Fitzgibbon said.

“If Joyce believes the commonwealth has the power [to change $1 milk prices] 
and should use that power, he had all of the last parliament to do so.

“The focus has to be on Murray Goulburn and Fonterra suppliers and Barnaby 
Joyce inexplicably refuses to muscle up in calling for MG to give farmers a 
better deal.”

Nick Xenophon, who has called for a “modest” temporary levy on milk to go 
directly back to farmers, said Joyce’s delayed reaction on $1 milk had a Rip 
Van Winkle feel to it.

“Where was the government five years ago?” Xenophon asked. “This delayed 
reaction to the milk price war is something that has Rip Van Winkle feel to it.”

He said while he welcomed a forensic examination of the industry, the report 
in the second half of next year would be too late for some farmers.
