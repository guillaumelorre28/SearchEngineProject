Who picks the new additions? Is a crack team of caped wordsmiths holed up in a 
bunker in deepest Oxfordshire, spending day and night on the scent of words 
before eventually alighting on the contemporary relevance of … cheeseball (also 
in the 2016 list, defined as ‘someone or something lacking taste, style, or 
originality; or more prosaically, the breaded and deep fried cheese 
appetiser’)? “It might seem romantic,” says Jonathan Dent, senior assistant 
editor in the OED’s new words team, “but it’s a lot of standard research, 
checks and balances. Anything new that goes into the dictionary is drafted and 
researched by us. It’s all down to evidence.”

The 15-strong new words team – out of a staff of 70 at the OED – work year 
round tracking words in corpuses – electronic text collections containing 
billions of words – and analysing online databases, as well as material 
submitted by the public through reading programmes. “We are always tracking new 
words that arrive in the language and start to be picked up widely,” Dent tells 
me. “OED traditionally waits for 10 years of evidence before we add a word but 
there are exceptions such as livermorium, a chemical element, in this update, 
which has only been around since 2012. At the same time the wider project of 
revising the whole text of the dictionary continues.”

The updates are achieved through a fine balance of human endeavour and 
technology, a system introduced in 2000 when the OED went online. But in 1884, 
when the very first edition started publication it was a different story. “It 
took around 50 years for them to finish the first run,” Dent explains. “That 
was mainly done through the public reading books and submitting quotations on 
paper. As soon as it was finished in 1928 they had a whole extra volume’s worth 
of new words.”

Features 
In the latest list, Dent has observed “notable word clusters” around shopping 
and slacktivism (people supporting political or social causes online but 
actually taking no further action). As for Brexit (and Grexit), “entries are 
being prepared for publication, and will very probably appear before the end of 
this year”.

What are his favourite new words? “I try to avoid getting passionate about 
particular words because we have to treat each of them equally and give them a 
fair chance,” he replies, sounding like a father asked to name a favourite 
child. But he does concede that with 2016 marking Roald Dahl’s centenary, he 
has found researching Dahlesque (also on the list) words interesting. “Like 
Oompa Loompa, added because of how often it is used to refer to someone with a 
perma-tan. And the witching hour, from The BFG, which we traced back to the 
18th century.” What aboutvermicious knids 
<http://roalddahl.wikia.com/wiki/Vermicious_Knids>, the shape-shifting aliens? 
“I mention them in my notes but thankfully they haven’t escaped the Dahl 
universe yet,” Dent replies sternly. “We should all be worried if they do.”

Here’s our predictions for next year’s new words …

Brexit fatigue
A collective malaise suffered by millions in the UK after Britain voted to 
leave the EU. Symptoms include denial, fear, an inability to trust anyone in 
power or opposition, intolerance, and a propensity to apply for an Irish 
passport or EU citizenship. See also ‘regrexit’.

Avocados artfully applied to toast; the favoured brunch of Instagrammers. Now 
controversial as the global appetite for the green hipster fruit is indirectly 
fuelling illegal deforestation in Mexico and crime in New Zealand.

Corbynista
A member of the Labour party who supports leader Jeremy Corbyn. Initially 
viewed as a person who stands for pure socialist, anti-Blairite values, now 
deployed only as a term of abuse.

 Pokémoning … mind how you go. Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images 
Going out to play Pokémon Go, or accompanying children doing so. Pitfalls of 
Pokémoning include bumping into obstacles, the constant need to recharge your 
phone and the tedium of always, always catching Pidgeys.


Trumpism
The personality-fuelled politics of Donald Trump, often used to denote extreme 
rightwing, narcissistic, anti-immigrant views and overt patriotism.
