It’s always worth watching when these two sides come together, although this 
one was rather sapped of life by Iraizoz’s early sending off, which led to 
Messi’s opener from the spot. Messi was replaced at half-time but Suárez and 
Neymar never let up, the former grabbing a hat-trick, the latter scoring one, 
setting up a couple and generally being quite brilliant.

So Barça stay two points behind Atlético, with one game in hand. What a game 
it promises to be when they meet in a couple of weeks. For now that’s it from 
me, thanks for reading.

87 mins: Vidal pounces on a loose ball in behind the Athletic defence and 
whips a cross towards Neymar, but it’s an inch or two too high for the 
Brazilian who would have had a simple point-blank header.

85 mins: Moments before that goal Neymar had dribbled wonderfully into the 
Athletic box before rolling his studs over the ball with his right foot to 
round the goalkeeper, but his left-footed finish wasn’t hit cleanly and allowed 
Herrerín to get back and make the save. Suárez has played well to get his 
hat-trick, but Neymar is in sizzling form.

GOAL! Barcelona 6-0 Athletic Bilbao (Suárez, 83 mins)

Busquets gets to the byline and dinks an inviting cross for Suárez who simply 
has to jump on the spot and direct his close-range header into the corner to 
seal his hat-trick.

GOAL! Barcelona 5-0 Athletic Bilbao (Suárez, 69 mins)

Arda Turan looks up and floats a cross towards the far post for Suárez who is 
given far too much time, but still needs a quality piece of chest control to 
put himself in on goal before poking home with the outside of his right foot.

66 mins: Jordi Alba sprints for a ball down the left and stretches to keep it 
in play. He fails to do s,o and it’s a double blow as he reaches for his 
hamstring and signals to the bench that his day is done.

GOAL! Barcelona 4-0 Athletic Bilbao (Rakitic, 62 mins)

Well this is just silly. Neymar decides to turn it on, first leaving poor old 
Bóveda on the floor with a sudden turn of pace on the left touchline, before 
dribbling brilliantly in and up to the byline past a couple of admiring 
Athletic defenders and passing back for Rakitic to tap between Herrerín’s legs.

61 mins: Vidal’s cross hits Balenziaga in the throat and he’s down but not 
out; the defender is OK to continue. Apparently Messi was not injured, just 
brought off for a rare rest.

55 mins: The game is understandably lacking urgency right now. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> continue to probe but at the 
sort of tempo which suggests they want to expend not a jot more energy than 
they have to. Williams is brought off and Sabin Merino comes on.

52 mins: A lovely move sees Barça work the ball to Neymar on the left who cuts 
the ball back to Suárez, but he’s tackled just as he looked to pull the trigger.

GOAL! Barcelona 3-0 Athletic Bilbao (Suárez, 47 mins)

Neymar and Suárez work a lovely two-two on the edge of the box and when Neymar 
feeds his team-mate in behind the Athletic defence, Suárez sweeps the ball 
first time under Herrerín and into the net.

Peeep! We are back under way and Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have made a change. Arda 
Turan, who has pretty much been a season-ticket holder so far this season, 
comes on replacing Lionel Messi to spoil everyone’s fun.

Half-time: Barcelona 2-0 Athletic Bilbao

Bilbao finish on the attack but can’t make a chance and that’s the half. 
Messi’s penalty and Neymar’s wonderfully chipped finish are the difference – as 
well as Barça’s extra man courtesy of Iraizoz’s early red card.

45+1 mins: That bit of Neymar bamboozling might have got to Bóveda; he has 
time to clear Rakitic’s cross but instead panics and slams it behind for a 
corner. Nothing comes of the set piece.

44 mins: Neymar shows another flash of his dribbling powers, offering Bóveda 
the ball before sweeping it away from under the defender’s nose a fraction of a 
second later, but he’s closed down before getting a shot away. Athletic need a 
break.

42 mins: Messi is tripped by one of the four red and white shirts buzzing 
around him. The free-kick is right in the middle of the goal, 25 yards out, and 
pretty much on its knees begging to be hit. Messi obliges but his effort bends 
just wide of the left post.

39 mins: Messi and Suárez work a crafty one-two on the edge of the box but the 
Uruguayan’s shot doesn’t match the quality of the buildup, sailing high and 
wide.

36 mins: Neymar suddenly cranks up the tempo, sprinting down the left and 
whipping a low cross for Messi who volleys over the bar when he might have done 
better. Messi follows it up with a sumptuous pass to Vidal down the right wing 
through the tiniest of gaps, but the assistant is on a different wavelength and 
wrongly flags for offside.

GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Athletic Bilbao (Neymar, 31 mins)

Athletic have the temerity to attack and immediately regret it. Barça pinch 
the ball and break with Suárez feeding Neymar on the left, who sprints through

29 mins: Vidal pounces on a loose ball on the edge of the Athletic box and 
cracks one towards the top corner but is zips just over Herrerín’s crossbar. 
Not far away from the right-back’s first Barça goal, who is playing more as 
right winger right now.

27 mins: The Camp Nou has gone a little flat again. Rakitic gets them off 
their seats for a moment with a well-weighted cross for Neymar arriving at the 
back post, but his half-volley is a tricky one and it flies high into the crowd.

22 mins: Athletic have set up camp on the edge of their own box with two lines 
of four, and Iñaki Williams up on his own. They are doing well until a slack 
clearance finds Neymar who weaves into the area leaving a couple of defenders 
on the ground, before San José makes a crucial last-ditch block. A moment later 
Neymar tees up Rakitic but the Croatian fires and ambitious volley over the bar.

13 mins: Barça have near-total dominance of the ball as you might expect with 
a one-man advantage but they haven’t been able to carve out a decent chance 
since the penalty. The Camp Nou is fairly quiet, as if waiting to be 
entertained. Neymar almost delivers with a burst down the left but his cross 
aimed at Suárez is cut out.

10 mins: Looking back, the penalty and red card decision was the right one as 
Suárez got to the high throughball over the Athletic defence just before 
Iraizoz and was taken out when he almost certainly would have scored, although 
it is obviously a huge price for Athletic to pay. These two don’t do uneventful.

GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Athletic Bilbao (Messi pen, 7 mins)

It takes a little while for Herrerín, the substitute goalkeeper, to get ready 
but eventually he jogs on and Muniain is the unfortunate player to be 
sacrificed. Messi steps up and fires the ball low to the goalkeeper’s left, and 
Barça are in front.

RED CARD! (Iraizoz, 4 mins)

The Athletic goalkeeper rushes out, wipes out Suárez on the edge of the box 
without a sniff of the ball, and he’s off! And to compound matters, Lahoz 
points to the spot.

Before kick-off there is just time for Messi to show off his fifth Ballon d’Or 
to the Camp Nou crowd. He has a big grin on his face and looks very relaxed.
Athletic Bilbao <https://www.theguardian.com/football/athleticbilbao> should be 
worried.

The players head out of the tunnel and are just about ready to go on a chilly 
evening inBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Fun fact: 
there is a doorway halfway up the steps of the Camp Nou tunnel leading to a 
tiny chapel. OK, not that fun, but it is a fact.

Over in Gran Canaria, Antoine Griezman has just jogged through a cavernous 
hole in the centre of the Las Palmas defence to score his second of the evening 
and put Atlético 3-0 up. A moment later the referee blows his whistle to 
confirm a result that keeps Diego Simeone’s side four points clear of Real 
Madrid at the top ofLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>. Barça are a further 
point behind Real but have played two games fewer than the Madrid clubs above 
them.

Preamble

Barça and Bilbao have plenty of recent history. The two clubs’ crossed paths 
enough in 2015 for their own mini World Series made up of wonderful goals, 
bad-tempered red cards and memorable finals. Here’s how it played out:

Game One 8 February, Bilbao 2-5 Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/08/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-la-liga-match-report>
. Lionel Messi is at his brilliant best with a hand in all five Barça goals as 
the visitors win the La Liga tie. Xabier Etxeita is sent off for a nasty tackle 
on Luis Suárez.

Game Two 30 May, Bilbao 1-3 Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/30/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-copa-del-rey-final-match-report>
. One of the great Messi goals – a brilliant dribble from the halfway line past 
four defenders and a powerful finish inside the near post – helps to seal 
Barça’s Copa del Rey triumph.
 Messi’s magical goal in the Copa del Rey final. 
Game Three 14 August, Bilbao 4-0 Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/14/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-spanish-super-cup>
. Mikel San José’s breathtaking 50-yard goal and a Aritz Aduriz hat-trick stun 
Barça with a rare thrashing in the Spanish Super Cup first leg at San Mamés.

Game Four 17 August, Barcelona 1-1 Bilbao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/17/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-spanish-super-cup>
. Gerard Piqué is shown a straight red card for screaming in an assistant 
referee’s face. Aduriz scores again as Bilbao see out the second leg to win the 
Super Cup.

Game Five 23 August, Bilbao 0-1 Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/23/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-la-liga-match-report>
. A week after losing the Super Cup, Suárez’s wonderfully taken volley settles 
their La Liga opener.

Bilbao come to the Camp Nou for their first meeting of 2016 following a couple 
of disappointing results which leave Ernesto Valverde’s side eighth in La Liga, 
while Barça mixed two 4-0 wins with three draws in their past five games. But 
if we’ve learnt anything from their recent battles it is that regardless of the 
form book, pretty much anything could happen tonight between Barcelona and
Athletic Bilbao <https://www.theguardian.com/football/athleticbilbao>. All we 
really know is that it definitely won’t be dull.

close  
It’s always worth watching when these two sides come together, although this 
one was rather sapped of life by Iraizoz’s early sending off, which led to 
Messi’s opener from the spot. Messi was replaced at half-time but Suárez and 
Neymar never let up, the former grabbing a hat-trick, the latter scoring one, 
setting up a couple and generally being quite brilliant.

So Barça stay two points behind Atlético, with one game in hand. What a game 
it promises to be when they meet in a couple of weeks. For now that’s it from 
me, thanks for reading.
 
Barça’s biggest win of the season is complete.
 
90+2 mins: Here is how Suárez’s second goal, Barça’s fifth, came about. Lots 
of passing, basically.

89 mins: Iturraspe tries a free-kick from 30 yards. Why not. It’s comfortable 
for Bravo.

29 - Luis Suárez has scored more goals than any other player in the top five 
European leagues (all competitions). Monster.

<https://twitter.com/OptaJose/status/688832697914003457>  
87 mins: Vidal pounces on a loose ball in behind the Athletic defence and 
whips a cross towards Neymar, but it’s an inch or two too high for the 
Brazilian who would have had a simple point-blank header.
 
85 mins: Moments before that goal Neymar had dribbled wonderfully into the 
Athletic box before rolling his studs over the ball with his right foot to 
round the goalkeeper, but his left-footed finish wasn’t hit cleanly and allowed 
Herrerín to get back and make the save. Suárez has played well to get his 
hat-trick, but Neymar is in sizzling form.
 
Busquets gets to the byline and dinks an inviting cross for Suárez who simply 
has to jump on the spot and direct his close-range header into the corner to 
seal his hat-trick.
 
81 mins: Barça have the ball and seem quite happy with it. Meanwhile...

<https://twitter.com/SundayChants/status/688830684882837504>  
79 mins: Barça have a free-kick 20 yards out when Neymar is chopped to ground. 
He gets to his feet and lines up a shot which tickles the roof of the net as it 
flies over.
 
77 mins: Iniesta tries a half-shot half-cross which Herrerín parries away. 
 
74 mins: It’s hit straight at the wall. Sigh. 
 
73 mins: Athletic have a free-kick! It’s 20 yards out!
 
72 mins: Barça can score almost as many as they would like to from here on in. 
Neymar is the latest to have a go, curling an effort from outside the box 
straight at Herrerín.
 
70 mins: Alba hobbles off and Marc Bartra replaces him. 
 
Arda Turan looks up and floats a cross towards the far post for Suárez who is 
given far too much time, but still needs a quality piece of chest control to 
put himself in on goal before poking home with the outside of his right foot.
 
66 mins: Jordi Alba sprints for a ball down the left and stretches to keep it 
in play. He fails to do s,o and it’s a double blow as he reaches for his 
hamstring and signals to the bench that his day is done.
 
64 mins: Rakitic is replaced by Sergi Roberto.
 
Well this is just silly. Neymar decides to turn it on, first leaving poor old 
Bóveda on the floor with a sudden turn of pace on the left touchline, before 
dribbling brilliantly in and up to the byline past a couple of admiring 
Athletic defenders and passing back for Rakitic to tap between Herrerín’s legs.
 
61 mins: Vidal’s cross hits Balenziaga in the throat and he’s down but not 
out; the defender is OK to continue. Apparently Messi was not injured, just 
brought off for a rare rest.
 
58 mins: Rakitic tries to find Vidal but his pass is overhit and it runs out 
for a goal-kick.
 
55 mins: The game is understandably lacking urgency right now. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> continue to probe but at the 
sort of tempo which suggests they want to expend not a jot more energy than 
they have to. Williams is brought off and Sabin Merino comes on.
 
52 mins: A lovely move sees Barça work the ball to Neymar on the left who cuts 
the ball back to Suárez, but he’s tackled just as he looked to pull the trigger.
 
50 mins: Athletic are pinned back on the edge of their box but manage to pinch 
the ball and break downfield through Williams. The striker is brought down by 
Mascherano who is quite harshly booked.
 
Neymar and Suárez work a lovely two-two on the edge of the box and when Neymar 
feeds his team-mate in behind the Athletic defence, Suárez sweeps the ball 
first time under Herrerín and into the net.
 
Peeep! We are back under way and Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have made a change. Arda 
Turan, who has pretty much been a season-ticket holder so far this season, 
comes on replacing Lionel Messi to spoil everyone’s fun.

Bilbao finish on the attack but can’t make a chance and that’s the half. 
Messi’s penalty and Neymar’s wonderfully chipped finish are the difference – as 
well as Barça’s extra man courtesy of Iraizoz’s early red card.
 
45+1 mins: That bit of Neymar bamboozling might have got to Bóveda; he has 
time to clear Rakitic’s cross but instead panics and slams it behind for a 
corner. Nothing comes of the set piece.
 
44 mins: Neymar shows another flash of his dribbling powers, offering Bóveda 
the ball before sweeping it away from under the defender’s nose a fraction of a 
second later, but he’s closed down before getting a shot away. Athletic need a 
break.
 
42 mins: Messi is tripped by one of the four red and white shirts buzzing 
around him. The free-kick is right in the middle of the goal, 25 yards out, and 
pretty much on its knees begging to be hit. Messi obliges but his effort bends 
just wide of the left post.
 
39 mins: Messi and Suárez work a crafty one-two on the edge of the box but the 
Uruguayan’s shot doesn’t match the quality of the buildup, sailing high and 
wide.
 
36 mins: Neymar suddenly cranks up the tempo, sprinting down the left and 
whipping a low cross for Messi who volleys over the bar when he might have done 
better. Messi follows it up with a sumptuous pass to Vidal down the right wing 
through the tiniest of gaps, but the assistant is on a different wavelength and 
wrongly flags for offside.
 
34 mins: Pass, pass, pass. It’s a game of keep ball, and Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are winning.
 
Athletic have the temerity to attack and immediately regret it. Barça pinch 
the ball and break with Suárez feeding Neymar on the left, who sprints through 
on goal and dinks Herrerín deliciously.
 
29 mins: Vidal pounces on a loose ball on the edge of the Athletic box and 
cracks one towards the top corner but is zips just over Herrerín’s crossbar. 
Not far away from the right-back’s first Barça goal, who is playing more as 
right winger right now.
 
27 mins: The Camp Nou has gone a little flat again. Rakitic gets them off 
their seats for a moment with a well-weighted cross for Neymar arriving at the 
back post, but his half-volley is a tricky one and it flies high into the crowd.
 
25 mins: Iñaki Williams slides a clever throughball with the outside of his 
boot but De Marcos is offside. Williams, by the way, has already racked up ten 
goals this season including this little number against Espanyol:
 
22 mins: Athletic have set up camp on the edge of their own box with two lines 
of four, and Iñaki Williams up on his own. They are doing well until a slack 
clearance finds Neymar who weaves into the area leaving a couple of defenders 
on the ground, before San José makes a crucial last-ditch block. A moment later 
Neymar tees up Rakitic but the Croatian fires and ambitious volley over the bar.
 
19 mins: Messi and Suárez work together in very tight space on the edge of the 
box to fashion a chance for Neymar bursting ahead of them, but his shot is 
deflected wide and Bilbao head clear the subsequent corner.
 
17 mins: The Camp Nou is almost stunned as De Marcos sprints on to a measured 
forward pass and races in on goal, but Bravo comes out and slides through both 
ball and man to stop the shot.
 
15 mins: A beautiful volleyed lay-off by Rakitic finds Suárez on the edge of 
the box but the forward’s curling effort bends over the crossbar.
OptaJose (@OptaJose) 
16 - Lionel Messi has been involved in 16 goals in his last 11 appearances 
against Athletic inLa Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>
 (10 goals and 6 assists). Infallible.

<https://twitter.com/OptaJose/status/688808874036621312>  
13 mins: Barça have near-total dominance of the ball as you might expect with 
a one-man advantage but they haven’t been able to carve out a decent chance 
since the penalty. The Camp Nou is fairly quiet, as if waiting to be 
entertained. Neymar almost delivers with a burst down the left but his cross 
aimed at Suárez is cut out.
 
10 mins: Looking back, the penalty and red card decision was the right one as 
Suárez got to the high throughball over the Athletic defence just before 
Iraizoz and was taken out when he almost certainly would have scored, although 
it is obviously a huge price for Athletic to pay. These two don’t do uneventful.
 
It takes a little while for Herrerín, the substitute goalkeeper, to get ready 
but eventually he jogs on and Muniain is the unfortunate player to be 
sacrificed. Messi steps up and fires the ball low to the goalkeeper’s left, and 
Barça are in front.
 
The Athletic goalkeeper rushes out, wipes out Suárez on the edge of the box 
without a sniff of the ball, and he’s off! And to compound matters, Lahoz 
points to the spot.
 
2 mins: Gerard Piqué stitches up Cladio Bravo with a backpass right into the 
path of Muniain but Barça get back to clear their lines just in time.
 
Peeeeep! Antonio Lahoz blows his whistle and Athletic, in traditional red and 
white stripes, get the game under way. An early dose of pedantry:

Madrid at the top ofLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>. Barça are a further 
point behind Real but have played two games fewer than the Madrid clubs above 
them.

Preamble

Barça and Bilbao have plenty of recent history. The two clubs’ crossed paths 
enough in 2015 for their own mini World Series made up of wonderful goals, 
bad-tempered red cards and memorable finals. Here’s how it played out:

Game One 8 February, Bilbao 2-5 Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/08/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-la-liga-match-report>
. Lionel Messi is at his brilliant best with a hand in all five Barça goals as 
the visitors win the La Liga tie. Xabier Etxeita is sent off for a nasty tackle 
on Luis Suárez.

Game Two 30 May, Bilbao 1-3 Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/30/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-copa-del-rey-final-match-report>
. One of the great Messi goals – a brilliant dribble from the halfway line past 
four defenders and a powerful finish inside the near post – helps to seal 
Barça’s Copa del Rey triumph.
 Messi’s magical goal in the Copa del Rey final. 
Game Three 14 August, Bilbao 4-0 Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/14/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-spanish-super-cup>
. Mikel San José’s breathtaking 50-yard goal and a Aritz Aduriz hat-trick stun 
Barça with a rare thrashing in the Spanish Super Cup first leg at San Mamés.

Game Four 17 August, Barcelona 1-1 Bilbao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/17/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-spanish-super-cup>
. Gerard Piqué is shown a straight red card for screaming in an assistant 
referee’s face. Aduriz scores again as Bilbao see out the second leg to win the 
Super Cup.

Game Five 23 August, Bilbao 0-1 Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/23/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-la-liga-match-report>
. A week after losing the Super Cup, Suárez’s wonderfully taken volley settles 
their La Liga opener.

Bilbao come to the Camp Nou for their first meeting of 2016 following a couple 
of disappointing results which leave Ernesto Valverde’s side eighth in La Liga, 
while Barça mixed two 4-0 wins with three draws in their past five games. But 
if we’ve learnt anything from their recent battles it is that regardless of the 
form book, pretty much anything could happen tonight between Barcelona and
Athletic Bilbao <https://www.theguardian.com/football/athleticbilbao>. All we 
really know is that it definitely won’t be dull.
