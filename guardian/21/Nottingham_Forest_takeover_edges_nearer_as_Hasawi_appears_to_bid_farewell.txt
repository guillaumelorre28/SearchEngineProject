It is understood the Reds owner is in negotiations with an American consortium 
led by John Jay Moores and Charles Noell, who hope to assume control at the 
City Ground sometime during the forthcoming international break which follows 
this weekend’s round of fixtures.

Hasawi, who purchased Forest in July 2012, posted a series of tweets admitting 
his time in charge had not worked out as he had hoped, before appearing to 
confirm his impending departure.

He said: “I would like to wish all the supporters, the staff and the players 
all the best. I tried my best to take the club to the next level but 
unfortunately it did not work out. I hope that after the new takeover things 
would turn out as planned.

“At the end of the day I will always remain a supporter to this legendary 
football club. I wish all the best for Nottingham Forest.”

The potential takeover is thought to be worth around £50m. The bid needs to be 
ratified by the EnglishFootball League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league> and an owners’ and 
directors’ test would have to be passed for Moores, and his long-time business 
partner Noell, to finally end their search for a British club following 
unsuccessful attempts with Everton and Swansea City.

During Hasawi’s tenure Forest have lurched from one controversy to another, 
with the Kuwaiti businessman overseeing a succession of managers, late payments 
of bills to other clubs, agents and suppliers, as well as winding up orders.

Supporters called for him to leave during the 2-0 defeat at Reading last 
weekend, which was a sixth loss in the past eight league matches and left 
Forest 20th in theChampionship

Such form might leave Philippe Montanier, who was appointed over the summer as 
manager, vulnerable under the prospective new owners and the Frenchman will be 
desperate for a second win in 11 Championship games when his side host Queens 
Park Rangers at the City Ground this weekend.

Moores is the former owner of Major League Baseball franchise the San Diego 
Padres.
