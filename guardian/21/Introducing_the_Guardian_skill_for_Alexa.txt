For those of you that have bought yourself an Amazon Echo today, you will be 
able to enable the Guardian skill. For those of you that haven’t, let us 
explain what it’s all about.

Amazon Echo 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo-Black/dp/B01GAGVIE4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474962068&sr=8-1&keywords=amazon+echo>
 is a smart hands-free speaker that can recognise and respond to voice 
commands. Echo is the first way you can speak withAlexa 
<https://developer.amazon.com/alexa>, Amazon’s voice service. You can ask her 
for information about the weather and sports scores. She interfaces with your 
favourite services and devices, so you can ask her to play music on Spotify or 
switch your lights on and off. We believe technology like this could make a 
significant difference to our homes.

This has only been made possible by advances in natural language processing 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing> and voice 
recognition <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/voice-recognition>. Over 
the last few years, accuracy has come on leaps and bounds. Machines are now far 
better at interpreting the words spoken to them and understanding how to act on 
these commands.

Amazon Echo has been available in the US since November 2014 and has been 
gaining a loyal audience there. When we found out that Amazon werelaunching in 
the UK and Germany 
<https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/14/amazons-alexa-powered-echo-and-echo-dot-coming-to-uk-and-germany/>
, we thought this would be a great opportunity to present our journalism not 
just in a new way, but in a way to make it much more accessible. Just think - 
while you’re getting the kids ready for school, cooking dinner, or enjoying a 
Sunday cuppa with your feet up, you can check in with us without having to pick 
up your phone. Most excitingly, this allows us to build a fantastic experience 
for anyone with visual impairments.

Our skill is available for you to use in the UK today. We hope to have it 
available in the US in a few weeks time.


Ask for news and opinion

The first version of our skill allows you to ask the Guardian for the 
headlines or ask for the news for a particular topic you’re interested in, such 
as the US elections or football. If you want to hear a little more in-depth on 
a topic, you can ask for opinions on it.

Things you can ask:

 * “Alexa, ask the Guardian to give me the headlines” 
 * “Alexa, ask the Guardian to tell me the football headlines” 
 * “Alexa, ask the Guardian for the latest opinions on US Elections” 
Ask for reviews

The Guardian is more than just the news. Ask the Guardian for the latest film, 
book, music and restaurant reviews. Planning your next trip to the cinema or 
choosing the next title to read should be that little bit easier.

Things you can ask:

 * “Alexa, ask the Guardian to give me latest film reviews” 
 * “Alexa, ask the Guardian to read me book reviews” 
 * “Alexa, ask the Guardian to tell me the latest restaurant reviews”
