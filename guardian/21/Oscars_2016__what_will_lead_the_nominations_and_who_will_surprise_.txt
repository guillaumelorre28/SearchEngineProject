The Revenant will lead, after sweeping the Golden Globes

Alejandro González Iñárritu’s follow-up to last year’s best picture winner 
Birdman surprised many by coming out ahead of Tom McCarthy’s assumed 
frontrunner Spotlight at Sunday’s Golden Globes, netting picture and director 
honors. Its best actor win forLeonardo DiCaprio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio> was a given, and he’s sure 
to repeat at the Oscars, but going into the night, most awards pundits had 
pegged the best picture (drama) gong going to Spotlight, or the night’s most 
nominated film, Carol.

The Revenant has been expected to lead Thursday’s Oscar nominations even 
before its success at the Globes. Why? Because on top of assured major nods for 
picture, director and actor, the brutal thriller is sure to dominate the 
technical and craft categories as well, which will boost it to the front of the 
pack. Smaller films like Spotlight andThe Big Short 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-big-short> can’t compete, as they won’t 
factor into the extra two sections.

But that doesn’t mean it will win

The Globes are by no means a precursor for the eventual winners at the Oscars. 
TheHollywood Foreign Press Association <http://www.goldenglobes.com/hfpa>, who 
vote for the Globes, often don’t go with the tide: last year, the eventual best 
picture Oscar winner, Birdman, lost to Boyhood; in 2010, they opted for The 
Social Network over The King’s Speech, which went on to sweep the Oscars.

Spotlight, The Big Short and The Martian, are all still considered formidable 
competition toThe Revenant <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-revenant>.

Bridge of Spies, Carol and/or Mad Max: Fury Road will receive the second most 
nominations

For the same reason that The Revenant will come out on top on Thursday, Bridge 
of Spies,Mad Max: Fury Road <https://www.theguardian.com/film/mad-max-fury-road>
 and Carol are sure to be awarded with a lot of Oscar love.

Carol, while not expected to win any major awards on the big night, will 
probably be nominated in three top categories: picture, actress forCate 
Blanchett <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett>, and supporting 
actress for Rooney Mara. The Academy could also potentially pull a fast one on 
Harvey Weinstein by rewarding Mara with a bestactress nod – although the 
distributor has her campaigning for a supporting one. On top of those four 
major nominations, expect Carol to also receive a few nods in the craft 
department, although it won’t match The Revenant in the technical categories 
(best sound editing, etc). A director nod for Todd Haynes is uncertain, as he 
didn’t make the cut for the Directors Guild of America’s nominations, which 
usually serve as a good indicator.

The same goes for Bridge of Spies helmer Steven Spielberg, who was also left 
out by the DGA. Like Carol,Bridge of Spies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/bridge-of-spies> will in all likelihood net a 
picture nomination, on top of a supporting actor one for Mark Rylance, and a 
number of craft nods. It’s likely to miss out on screenplay, however, unlike 
Carol.

And the Oscar goes to (or it should anyway)

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/10/and-the-oscar-goes-to-critics-winners-predictions-2016>
Mad Max: Fury Road director George Miller is up for the DGA honor, and the 
film is pretty much assured a picture nod, in addition to a slew of craft and 
technical nominations.

Straight Outta Compton will defy the odds to receive a best picture nomination

Despite coming out in the summer, F Gary Gray’s hip-hop drama has maintained 
an incredible amount of momentum going into awards season, netting a Screen 
Actors Guild nod for best ensemble, which serves as a major precursor for a 
best picture nomination.

But don’t be so sure of Star Wars: The Force Awakens

The Star Wars franchise hasn’t netted a best picture nomination since its 
first installment, A New Hope, in 1977. Don’t expect that to change when this 
year’s nominations are read on Thursday.

Why Star Wars: The Force Awakens won't sweep the Oscars
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/17/star-wars-the-force-awakens-oscars>
No film has captured the zeitgeist more in the past 12 months than JJ Abrams’s 
seventh film in the sci-fi series: it’s currently the third-biggest global 
movie of all time, and stands a solid shot at claiming the top spot in the 
weeks to come. But unfortunately for the Force, financial success does not 
equal Oscar buzz. The fact is, even with 10 best picture nominees, the 
competition this year is too stacked for Star Wars to reasonably slide in.

The Academy has been known to reward critically approved populist fare in the 
past, giving major love to Avatar, Titanic and Gladiator. Expect those slots to 
go toInside Out <https://www.theguardian.com/film/inside-out>, Mad Max: Fury 
Road, and Straight Outta Compton this year.

There will be some major surprises

What would the Oscar nominations be without some hoodwinking? Few predicted 
Demián Bichir’s deserved best actor nomination for his little-seen independent 
drama A Better Life in 2011; the same goes for Marion Cotillard popping up in 
the best actress race for the French film Two Days, One Night last year, over 
Jennifer Aniston, who was expected to make the cut for Cake.

Major (and very welcome) surprises this year could come in the form of Michael 
B Jordan for best actor in Creed, andCharlotte Rampling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlotte-rampling> for best actress in 45 
Years. Although both failed to net SAG and Golden Globe nominations, their 
performances are too good to ignore, and stand a solid shot at creeping into 
the race. Rampling especially has a chance since she’s been campaigning hard 
all season long, putting in multiple Academy appearances in New York and Los 
Angeles.

Mya Taylor: the transgender actor who could make Hollywood history

<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/dec/21/mya-taylor-transgender-actor-academy-awards-oscar-tangerine-movie>
Also watch out for Mya Taylor, who’s been hustling in recent months like 
Rampling. Were she to be nominated, Taylor would be the first transgender actor 
ever up for an Oscar, for her supporting turn in Sean Baker’s beloved comedy,
Tangerine <https://www.theguardian.com/film/tangerine>. She already won for 
best breakthrough actor at the Gotham Awards, on top of receiving a Spirit 
Award nomination.

Kristen Stewart could also shock by entering Taylor’s race, for her supporting 
work in Clouds of Sils Maria. Although she’s been shut out of the major awards 
shows thus far, Stewart has topped a number of critics polls in her category, 
and recently made history by becoming the first American actress to win a 
César, France’s equivalent for theOscars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars>.

Lady Gaga will probably be honored

The pop star, who impressed many with a performance of The Sound of Music at 
last year’s Oscars ceremony, is intent on returning to the Dolby Theater next 
month to perform her balladTill It Happens to You

Gaga, together with the song’s co-writer Diane Warren and film-makers Kirby 
Dick and Amy Ziering, have been campaigning in recent weeks on behalf of the 
song, and the effort has struck a chord with Academy voters. The Guardian 
spotted a number of members visibly tearing during a recent performance of the 
song in Beverly Hills.


#OscarsStillSoWhite might not persist

Welcome to the 87th Oscars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars>. Tonight 
we honor Hollywood’s best and whitest – sorry,brightest.

So said host Neil Patrick Harris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/neil-patrick-harris> at the very start of 
last year’s show – and he was right. Ava DuVernay’s Selma was up for best 
picture, but was surprisingly shut out of the director and actor races. In 
fact, no actor of color made any of the acting categories. And of all the best 
picture nominees, only Selma featured a black protagonist. As a result, 
#OscarsSoWhite emerged as the dominant hashtag on social media during the 
ceremony.

In all likelihood, history won’t repeat itself this year. Straight Outta 
Compton will probably be up for picture. And although it’s a longshot, Star 
Wars: The Force Awakens which features John Boyega in one of the lead roles, 
could also be up for the same award.

As for the actor categories, the aforementioned Michael B Jordan and Mya 
Taylor are definite possibilities. Even surer is Idris Elba, who is expected to 
a receive a nod for best supporting actor inBeasts of No Nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/beasts-of-no-nation>. That film also stands a 
shot at entering the best picture race following its surprise SAG nomination 
for best ensemble.
