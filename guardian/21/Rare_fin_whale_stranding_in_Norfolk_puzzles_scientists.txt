Mystery surrounds how a rare 12-metre (40ft) fin whale came to be washed up on 
a beach inNorfolk <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/norfolk>.


The enormous creature was already dead when it was washed up on Holkham beach 
on the north Norfolk coast on Thursday afternoon.

Evolutionary biologist Dr Ben Garrod from Anglia Ruskin University 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/angliaruskinuniversity> in Cambridge 
said it was very unusual for a fin whale to be found on the east coast of 
Britain.

“It should not be in those waters,” he told the BBC 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-37726384>. “We see fin whales 
occasionally on the southern coast or more the west coast of the UK, so 
Ireland, right up to Scotland. But you never get them in the North Sea, so what 
it was doing there, we have no idea at the moment.”

It was not clear why the whale died, he added.

A postmortem is expected to be carried out by the Cetacean Strandings 
Investigation Programme <http://ukstrandings.org/>.

The death comes after a spate of whale strandings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/04/sixth-whale-stranded-on-east-anglian-beach>
 along the Norfolk region’s coastline this year, with dozens having died in 
other parts of the North Sea.


A spokeswoman for the Holkham Estate said the picturesque beach remained open 
and added: “Plans are in place to remove the whale from the beach. Holkham 
beach remains open, but we advise the public not to venture close to the 
carcass and to keep dogs on leads.”
