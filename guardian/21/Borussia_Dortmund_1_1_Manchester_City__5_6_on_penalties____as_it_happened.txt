Guardiola shakes hands with Thomas Tuchel, before assembling his players for a 
lengthy post-match berating. That was a stop-start game, hindered by conditions 
and the number of substitutions, but it improved late on, and Angus Gunn did 
his prospects no harm with three saves in the shootout. The Pep Guardiola era 
is up and running. Thanks for joining me.Bye.

Manchester City win 6-5 on penalties!

Merinoâ€™s penalty is unconvincing, and Gunn makes another save! City win the 
shootout, after it finished 1-1 after 90 minutes.

Tucked into the bottom-right corner by the full back. And now Merino must 
score for Dortmund...

GOAL! Borussia Dortmund 1-1 Manchester City (Pulisic)

Leitner wins a late, late corner and with Cityâ€™s defence sleeping, rolls it 
short to Kagawa. He finds Pulisic, who fires it low, through a crowd of 
players, and between Gunnâ€™s legs.

91 mins: A mistake from Adarabioyo allows Kagawa to dribble into the area, and 
Fernandinho appears to clip his heels. The referee isnâ€™t buying it, and 
penalises Kagawa for simulation. Thatâ€™s a second Dortmund penalty appeal denied.

at the right time. A penny for your thoughts, Wilfried. Another City change, 
just before the goal â€“ Angelino came on for Kolarov.

GOAL! Borussia Dortmund 0-1 Manchester City (AgÃ¼ero)

Dortmund have been threatening for the last few minutes, but City counter, and 
Aleix Garcia slots a through ball to Silva, who tucks the ball under BÃ¼rki and 
into the path of Sergio AgÃ¼ero, in front of an empty net. Thatâ€™s their first 
ever goal under Pep Guardiola.

75 mins: After Bony dawdles in the opposition area, Dortmund break at speed, 
with Castro set free on goal â€“ but his shot is tipped over by Gunn. An 
excellent save from Bryan Gunnâ€™s son â€“ quite literally, a son of a Gunn.

73 mins: Dortmund break down the right, with Maffeo forced to clear the ball 
awkwardly â€“ it slices wide for a corner. The young full-back did well to avoid 
an own goal.

71 mins: This Dortmund squad is loaded with quick, tricky young players â€“ 
Pulisic is the latest to make an impact, testing Denayer twice with runs 
forward. The second leads to a hefty foul that would surely have earned a 
yellow card in a competitive game.

69 minutes: More instructions from Guardiola to his players, who have the more 
senior side on the pitch for the last 20 minutes. By the way, if I know the 
International Champions Cup, this will go to penalties if it finishes goalless.

65 mins: Manchester City enjoying perhaps their best spell of the match now, 
with Silva finding Bony, who fires over. He will be keen to make an impression 
on Guardiola â€“ a bit too keen, on the evidence of the second half.

63 mins: With Dortmund trying to organise themselves, Aleksandar Kolarov 
strides forward and fires over from thirty yards. Worth a go.

60 mins: Bony has a shot from 25 yards, but it deflects off Barta and is 
palmed away by BÃ¼rki. More substitutions for Dortmund â€“ Burnic on for Sahin, 
Larsen on for Ramos, Hober on for Bartra. Only two Dortmund starters â€“ BÃ¼rki 
and Moritz Leitner â€“ are still on the pitch.

58 mins: One thing that Dortmund definitely are doing is pressing much higher, 
fitting nine outfield players into a postage stamp sized space. Their high line 
almost lets Silva in, but he is flagged offside â€“ wrongly, as it turns out. 
Silva sees his shot saved by BÃ¼rki.

56 mins: Both teams have spent most of the first ten minutes trying to work 
out each otherâ€™s formations; those changes havenâ€™t helped the flow of the game.

53 mins: Ramos finds space on the left-hand side of the box, but his 
cross-shot is well covered by Adarabioyo, who has performed well. The referee 
orders Dortmundâ€™s substitutes to put on green bibs, while letting Guardiolaâ€™s 
casual attire slide.

51 mins: Sven Bender and Pusilic link up for a spell of quickfire passing on 
the edge of theManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> area, but canâ€™t carve out 
a chance. Neater possession, less goalmouth action, is the story of the half so 
far.

49 mins: Pulisic lofts a high cross towards Ramos, who has stayed on as a lone 
forward for Dortmund. He brings it down, but is flagged offside. City, led by 
Silva in a central role, romp forward, but Kolarov is also caught offside on 
the left.

Guardiola shakes hands with Thomas Tuchel, before assembling his players for a 
lengthy post-match berating. That was a stop-start game, hindered by conditions 
and the number of substitutions, but it improved late on, and Angus Gunn did 
his prospects no harm with three saves in the shootout. The Pep Guardiola era 
is up and running. Thanks for joining me.Bye.
 
Merinoâ€™s penalty is unconvincing, and Gunn makes another save! City win the 
shootout, after it finished 1-1 after 90 minutes.
 
Angelino scores for Manchester City! 6-5

Tucked into the bottom-right corner by the full back. And now Merino must 
score for Dortmund...
 
Larsen misses for Dortmund! 5-5

This is never going to end. Gunn dives to his left to make another excellent 
save.
 
Sterling misses for Manchester City! 5-5

You could see this coming. It was a well-struck penalty, to be fair, but Burki 
tips it around the post...
 
Hober scores for Dortmund! 5-5

Blasted into the top corner...
 
Nolito scores for Manchester City! 5-4

Nolitoâ€™s first real action in a City shirt is a confidently struck penalty.
 
Pulisic scores for Dortmund! 4-4

He does, just, as Gunn gets down really well, but sees the ball deflect into 
the roof of the net!
 
Aguero scores for Manchester City! 4-3

Aguero, like many others, is unhappy with the surface around the penalty spot, 
but his effort is low to Burkiâ€™s left, beating the keeperâ€™s dive. Pulisic has 
to score...
 
Burnic scores for Dortmund! 3-3

Despite Gunnâ€™s attempts to put him off, Burnic coolly sends the young 
goalkeeper the wrong way...
 
Silva scores for Manchester City! 3-2

Curled inside the left-hand post to edge City back ahead...
 
Castro scores for Dortmund! 2-2

The midfielder goes straight down the middle...
 
Fernandinho scores for Manchester City! 2-1

Three in a row as the City captain rolls the ball in the right corner...
 
Kagawa scores for Dortmund! 1-1

Kagawa repeats the trick, tucking the ball inside the post.
 
Adarabioyo scores for Manchester City! (City 1-0 Dortmund)

The central defender belts it into the corner, low to Burkiâ€™s right...
 
Two penalties taken â€“ Sky were still showing adverts, forgive me â€“ but Aleix 
Garcia and Felix Passlack both saw their penalties saved...
 
There will be penalties.
 
Leitner wins a late, late corner and with Cityâ€™s defence sleeping, rolls it 
short to Kagawa. He finds Pulisic, who fires it low, through a crowd of 
players, and between Gunnâ€™s legs.
 
93 mins: Hober has brought a bit of energy to Dortmund attacks, but is harried 
out of play close to the corner flag, with time running out...
 
91 mins: A mistake from Adarabioyo allows Kagawa to dribble into the area, and 
Fernandinho appears to clip his heels. The referee isnâ€™t buying it, and 
penalises Kagawa for simulation. Thatâ€™s a second Dortmund penalty appeal denied.
 
90 mins: Fernandinho, who looks set to last the full 95 minutes, gets a foot 
in to make an important challenge on the edge of the area.
 
89 mins: Hober almost unlocks the City defence with a drilled ball to Pulisic, 
but the American canâ€™t bring it under control. Five added minutes.
 
87 mins: Silva and Aguero are capable of passing their way through an 
opposition defence despite being thirty yards apart; they do so here, but Silva 
canâ€™t latch onto Agueroâ€™s angled through ball, appealing in vain for a penalty.
 
86 mins: The crowd are urging a Dortmund equaliser, and the penalty shoot-out 
it will bring. They seem a little short of ideas. ForManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, even in this 
low-intensity affair, many of their young players have impressed â€“ Adarabioyo 
in particular.
 
84 mins: Bony and TourÃ© are taken off to allow Nolito and Sterling to come on. 
There could still be more than ten minutes left, what with the water breaks and 
all. Bony doesnâ€™t look happy.
City Watch (@City_Watch) 
Nasri has been there since the start of pre-season, but so far 0 minutes on 
the pitch under Pep.

<https://twitter.com/City_Watch/status/758656199931944960>  
82 mins: A couple more changes coming up for City â€“ Nolito and Raheem 
Sterling, last seen crashing out of Euro 2016, are going to get a brief taste 
of on-field action.
 
79 mins: Bony has worked tirelessly to carve out three chances, all of which 
he has missed. AgÃ¼ero hasnâ€™t really been involved, but was in the right place 
at the right time. A penny for your thoughts, Wilfried. Another City change, 
just before the goal â€“ Angelino came on for Kolarov.
 
Dortmund have been threatening for the last few minutes, but City counter, and 
Aleix Garcia slots a through ball to Silva, who tucks the ball under BÃ¼rki and 
into the path of Sergio AgÃ¼ero, in front of an empty net. Thatâ€™s their first 
ever goal under Pep Guardiola.
 
75 mins: After Bony dawdles in the opposition area, Dortmund break at speed, 
with Castro set free on goal â€“ but his shot is tipped over by Gunn. An 
excellent save from Bryan Gunnâ€™s son â€“ quite literally, a son of a Gunn.
 
73 mins: Dortmund break down the right, with Maffeo forced to clear the ball 
awkwardly â€“ it slices wide for a corner. The young full-back did well to avoid 
an own goal.
 
71 mins: This Dortmund squad is loaded with quick, tricky young players â€“ 
Pulisic is the latest to make an impact, testing Denayer twice with runs 
forward. The second leads to a hefty foul that would surely have earned a 
yellow card in a competitive game.
 
69 minutes: More instructions from Guardiola to his players, who have the more 
senior side on the pitch for the last 20 minutes. By the way, if I know the 
International Champions Cup, this will go to penalties if it finishes goalless.
 
Another water break. The local Dortmund fans have broken into the Icelandic 
thunder clap; itâ€™s already getting a bit played.

65 mins: Manchester City enjoying perhaps their best spell of the match now, 
with Silva finding Bony, who fires over. He will be keen to make an impression 
on Guardiola â€“ a bit too keen, on the evidence of the second half.
 
63 mins: With Dortmund trying to organise themselves, Aleksandar Kolarov 
strides forward and fires over from thirty yards. Worth a go.
 
60 mins: Bony has a shot from 25 yards, but it deflects off Barta and is 
palmed away by BÃ¼rki. More substitutions for Dortmund â€“ Burnic on for Sahin, 
Larsen on for Ramos, Hober on for Bartra. Only two Dortmund starters â€“ BÃ¼rki 
and Moritz Leitner â€“ are still on the pitch.
 
58 mins: One thing that Dortmund definitely are doing is pressing much higher, 
fitting nine outfield players into a postage stamp sized space. Their high line 
almost lets Silva in, but he is flagged offside â€“ wrongly, as it turns out. 
Silva sees his shot saved by BÃ¼rki.
 
56 mins: Both teams have spent most of the first ten minutes trying to work 
out each otherâ€™s formations; those changes havenâ€™t helped the flow of the game.
 
53 mins: Ramos finds space on the left-hand side of the box, but his 
cross-shot is well covered by Adarabioyo, who has performed well. The referee 
orders Dortmundâ€™s substitutes to put on green bibs, while letting Guardiolaâ€™s 
casual attire slide.
 
51 mins: Sven Bender and Pusilic link up for a spell of quickfire passing on 
the edge of theManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> area, but canâ€™t carve out 
a chance. Neater possession, less goalmouth action, is the story of the half so 
far.
 
49 mins: Pulisic lofts a high cross towards Ramos, who has stayed on as a lone 
forward for Dortmund. He brings it down, but is flagged offside. City, led by 
Silva in a central role, romp forward, but Kolarov is also caught offside on 
the left.
 
47 mins: Maffeo, on as a right-back in a more conventional back four with 
Denayer, Adarabioyo and Kolarov, makes an early slip but recovers to clear.
 
The second half is under way. Here are the updated teams:

Borussia Dortmund: BÃ¼rki; Merino, Bender, Bartra, Passlack; Sahin, Castro, 
Leitner; Kagawa, Pusilic, Ramos.

Manchester City: Gunn; Maffeo, Denayer, Adarabioyo, Kolarov; Fernandinho, 
TourÃ©, Aleix Garcia, Silva; AgÃ¼ero, Bony.
 
Weâ€™ve still not restarted, with the fourth official putting in overtime on the 
electronic subsâ€™ board â€“ thereâ€™s been half a dozen changes for each side, with 
AgÃ¼ero, David Silva and Yaya TourÃ© all coming on for City. A full run-down for 
both teams to follow shortly...
