1 | Artie Bucco

from The Sopranos <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv3SeUdRBZM>

Insecure, self-pitying and something of a schmuck, Artie (played by New Jersey 
native John Ventimiglia) was a childhood friend of Tony Soprano, meaning his 
upscale Italian restaurant Vesuvio became a venue for the mob’s “business 
meetings”. Rather than sweat in the kitchen, Artie loved to walk the floor, 
schmoozing diners and launching into lyrical descriptions of Sicilian olive 
oil, white truffles and artisan cheeses – while Carmela’s tableful of 
ladies-who-lunch rolled their eyes. Despite all the hungry wiseguys devouring 
his pasta, Artie struggled with debt, so borrowed money from his old buddy. Bad 
idea. Tone burned the place down in an insurance scam, rebuilding it as Nuovo 
Vesuvio.

from Sweeney Todd <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqG03ai1Yfc>

Memorably portrayed by some of stage and screen’s best-loved grande dames – 
the likes of Angela Lansbury, Elaine Paige, Imelda Staunton and Helen Bonham 
Carter – the cheerfully amoral Nellie Lovett was notorious for making the 
“worst pies in London” at her vermin-infested 186 Fleet Street shop. That is, 
until the demon barber reopened his shaving parlour upstairs and started 
slitting the throats of customers. Todd sent the corpses down a chute into his 
infatuated accomplice’s kitchen, where she’d bake the flesh into altogether 
tastier pies, turning her fortunes around. Well, for a while – in the end, Todd 
incinerated Mrs L in her own oven.

 Remy the rat from the Oscar-winning Ratatouille.

from Ratatouille <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YG4h5GbTqU>

 Despite his small stature and the fact that humans tended to scream when they 
saw him in a kitchen, lovable Remy (voiced by comedianPatton Oswalt 
<http://www.pattonoswalt.com/>) refused to give up on his gourmand dreams. 
Pixar hired Michelin-starredThomas Keller <http://www.thomaskeller.com/>, of 
Per Se and French Laundry repute, as food consultant on their Oscar-winning 
2007 romp about a rat who can cook. Controlling the hand movements of clumsy 
kitchen assistant Linguini by hiding under his toque and tugging on his ginger 
hair, Remy’s delicious dishes even impressed Paris’s toughest food critic, 
Anton Ego – climaxing in the title dish, rumoured to be Keller’s own recipe for 
layered confit byaldi.

 Primed for Prima: Stanley Tucci, Marc Anthony and Tony Shalhoub in Big Night. 
4 | Primo 

from Big Night <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLWy9Wp_RWY>

 “To eat good food is to be close to God.” This 1996 indie gem portrayed a 
pair of proud Italian immigrant brothers running Paradise, an ailing restaurant 
on the New Jersey shore during the 1950s. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) was the gifted 
but irascible chef, reluctant to “Americanise” his traditional food from the 
old country. Smooth younger sibling Secondo (Stanley Tucci, who also co-wrote 
and co-directed) ran front of house. They desperately tried to revitalise their 
business when bigtime swing singerLouis Prima 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-a8kLtJSJ4> was due to dine there, preparing 
a special feast centred on timpano (an elaborate drum-shaped baked pasta dish) 
but Prima didn’t show up. Fuhgeddaboutit.

 She’s the chef: Monica (Courteney Cox) in Friends.

from Friends <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Ad0tHFqgY> 

 Imagine how clean her kitchen would be. In the globe-conquering 90s sitcom, 
neurotic Monica (Courteney Cox) was the sister of Ross (David Schwimmer), best 
friend of Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and eventually wife of Chandler (Matthew 
Perry). Her competitive, perfectionist, obsessive-compulsive nature made her 
ideally suited to a career as a chef. Rising up the ranks from rollerskating 
waitress to head chef, she worked at five Manhattan restaurants during the 
show’s decade on air: Iridium, Café des Artistes, Moondance Diner, Alessandro’s 
and Javu. Apart from when she put the turkey on her head, her Thanksgiving 
spreads always looked mouthwatering too. No wonder she used to be “Fat Monica”.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIOtJfRNfI>

 In Peter Greenaway’s 1989 arthouse hit – complete with Jean-Paul Gaultier 
costumes and Michael Nyman score – coarse gangster Albert Spica (Michael 
Gambon) took over French chef Boarst’s high-class Le Hollandais restaurant. 
Spica’s wife Georgina (Helen Mirren) embarked on an affair with one of the 
regular diners, bookshop owner Michael (Alan Howard) and when Spica found out, 
his mob killed Michael by force-feeding him books. Vengeful Georgina begged 
Boarst to cook her lover’s body and in a cathartic final confrontation, 
Georgina forced her husband to eat the corpse (“Try the cock, Albert. It’s a 
delicacy and you know where it’s been”) before shooting him in the head. Bon 
appétit.

 “Børk, børk, børk!” A parody of TV chefs, the bushy-eyebrowed, 
gibberish-spoutingSwedish Chef <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY_Yf4zz-yo> 
was one of the few Muppets to have a puppeteer’s actual hands, as he needed to 
handle food and utensils. Sketches invariably began with him waving wooden 
spoons, clattering bowls and reciting mock-Swedish, semi-yodelled, singsong 
recipes (“Aweenda shmure da froog’s legs” or “Yur puurt thuur chiir-ken airn 
der bewl”) before descending into a slapstick finale, often involving shotguns, 
cleavers and his live animal ingredients getting the better of him. Thinkbandit 
lobsters <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWGh1YYT4vI>, a chocolate moose 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAbWQFM4G24> or a chicken that laid explosive

 Francs for the memory: Stéphane Audran in Babette’s Feast. 
8 | Babette Hersant 

from Babette’s Feast <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvNifgj_dv4>

 Decades before subtitled Scandi drama was a “thing” came this Oscar-winning 
1987 Danish film. In a remote 19th-century village, two pastor’s daughters took 
in French refugee Babette (Stéphane Audran) as their servant. When she won 
10,000 francs on the lottery, she secretly decided to spend it on cooking a 
lavish meal to repay them for their kindness. After seven courses of turtle 
soup, caviar, quails, truffles, foie gras and fine wines, Babette revealed she 
was once head chef at the famed Café Anglais, where dinner for 12 costs 10,000 
francs. The tearful sisters said, “Now you’ll be poor the rest of your life” to 
which Babette replied: “An artist is never poor.” It’s Pope Francis’s favourite 
film.
 No soup for you! The Emmy-nominated Larry Thomas as the Soup Nazi in Seinfeld.

from Seinfeld <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WRxEY8o3kc>

 He appeared in a single 1995 episode of Jerry Seinfeld’s mega-rated sitcom, 
returning for abrief cameo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phkre1QDPuk> in the 
finale three years later, but the tyrannical soup-seller is one of the show’s 
finest creations. Played by Larry Thomas, who was Emmy-nominated for the role, 
stony-faced, Stalin-’tached Yev Kassem made great soup but treated customers 
with contempt and operated an insanely strict ordering procedure to put them 
off. The character was inspired by real-life soup vendorAl Yeganeh 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L06udJXhfK0>, dubbed the “Terrorist” by 
midtown Manhattan residents. When Seinfeld and his crew tried to lunch at his 
55th Street restaurant after the episode aired, life imitated art and Yeganeh 
refused their order, yelling “No soup for you!”

 In this 1988 coming-of-age cult classic, two teenage sisters and their best

Taylor – worked at the eponymous pizza parlour in small town Mystic, 
Connecticut. When TV food critic the Everyday Gourmet came to town, he raved 
about the pizzeria’s “slice of heaven” and its fame spread. The three 
waitresses might have been like her daughters, but chef Leona (Conchata 
Ferrell) still refused to give up her secret recipe. Indeed, the film’s last 
line is: “What the hell do you think Leona puts in that pizza?” The film also 
marked the debut of Matt Damon, whospeaks one line while eating lobster 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZu3EVs8PIM>: “Mom, do you want my green 
stuff?”
