Three new teams will make their Australian netball debuts when round one kicks 
off on 18 February with three derbies.


Giants Netball face NSW Swifts in Sydney, Magpies Netball Club meet Melbourne 
Vixens and Sunshine Coast Lightning play reigning premiers Queensland Firebirds 
in Brisbane.


Adelaide Thunderbirds and West Coast Fever face off the following day to 
complete round one of the fixtures. The 17-week, 60-match season culminates in 
a 17 June grand final.

“Suncorp Super Netball will showcase our sport at its absolute best. Bold, 
confident, strong and fiercely competitive,” Netball Australia chief executive, 
Kate Palmer, said.

“There are so many stories brewing as the league takes shape; old and new 
rivalries, city versus city, state versus state, old teammates on opposite 
sides of the court.”

Netball Australia’s decision to lift import restrictions for the competition 
has allowed 16 international players from seven countries to find spots in 
squads.
