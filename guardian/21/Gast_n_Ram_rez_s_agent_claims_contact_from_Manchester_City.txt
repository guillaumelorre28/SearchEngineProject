Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have 
made the first move towards potentially signing Bologna's Gastón Ramírez, 
according to the Uruguayan playmaker's agent.

Pablo Betancourt said: "Juventus and Manchester City have contacted me 
but there is especially an interesting offer from Wolfsburg and also another 
one from an important Spanish club. I think considering all the offers, the 
possibility that he could leave [this summer] could happen."

This week Roberto Mancini, the City manager, admitted his admiration for the 
21-year-old, saying: "He is a good, young player with great potential. In 
attack, though, we are OK."

Bologna <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bologna> are said to want around 
£14m for Ramírez, who is under contract for three more years and scored eight 
goals in 28 Serie A starts last season.

Meanwhile, Dimitar Berbatov will not be returning to Bayer Leverkusen, though 
the Manchester United forward's future remains unclear. Berbatov played for 
Leverkusen for five seasons before he moved to Tottenham Hotspur in 2006. But 
Wolfgang Halzhauser, the German club's chief executive, said: "We are looking 
to find a striker, one that works well alongside Stefan Kiessling. However, the 
return of Berbatov is not an option for us. We are still on good terms with him 
but he would only be an option if he was available on a free transfer."

This will not be a possibility as Berbatov is signed on for another year at 
Old Trafford. He cost £30.75m four years ago and United will be keen to try to 
recoup around half of that.
