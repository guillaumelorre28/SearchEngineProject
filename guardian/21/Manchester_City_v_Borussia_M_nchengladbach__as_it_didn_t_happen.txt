The game is off and so am I ...

Well, it’s been brief but thank for your time and attention. I can’t apologise 
enough for not being able to bring you lots of lovely minute-by-minutely 
action, but it’s not really my fault. Rain in Manchester, eh? Who’d a thunk it. 
If you’re feeling starved of football action, feel free to tune into our 
minute-by-minute report ofPSG v Arsenal

, which are both very much on.

Gladbach's players come out to greet the fans ...

Gladbach’s players and officials have walked out on to the pitch and ambled 
down to the away end to salute their supporters, who are in very jubilant mood 
despite having their Tuesday night football parade quite literally rained on. 
Fans applaud players and the gesture is reciprocated. The players turn to 
return to the dressing room and are loudly summoned back, where everyone enjoys 
an Icelandic thunderclap.

We'll have an announcement later ...

Uefa have said they’ll wait until later this evening to make an announcement 
about when the match will be replayed. It’s a decision that will be made by the 
referee, officials from the two clubs and Uefa, who have to decide whether to 
play tomorrow at some other later date. Despite being asked to make their out 
of the ground, Gladbach’s fans are still in situ, singing loudly and demanding 
to see their team. You’ve got to feel sorry for them; most probably have 
flights home booked for later this evening or tomorrow morning and will 
probably miss the rescheduled match. Gladbach are due to play Werder Bremen on 
Saturday, while City will face Bournemouth on the same day.

BT Sport tunnel cam

Sergio Aguero is shown in the tunnel and he looks a bit surprised to learn 
that the game is off. The pitch is draining brilliantly and does currently look 
playable, with some City staff out on it kicking a ball around with little sign 
of adverse effects. However, it seems that circumstances outside the ground may 
have prompted the decision to postpone the match.

The latest on the weather

The stadium is practically empty due to weather-induced problems with the 
public transport, the fanzone at City Square has been closed because of the 
adverse weather conditions and referee Björn Kuipers and his assistants have 
been out on the pitch bouncing a ball and inspecting the surface. The 
torrential rain is showing no sign of easing and it’s not looking good. If the 
game is postponed, it may be played tomorrow night instead.

Rain may stop play ...

Jamie Jackson, our man at the Etihad Stadium, has just phoned the office to 
say the game may succumb to the weather and be called off. It’s 32 degrees 
centigrade in London and pelting down with rain in Manchester. Go figure. More 
news as we get it ...

Andre Schubert speaks

“We want to be courageous and brave, we always go into games feeling we are up 
for it and up for a victory rather than feeling we are going to lose,” said 
Schubert when he addressed the press last night. “It will take a lot of courage 
– we need to push ourselves all the way as we are up against a very strong 
team.”

On his side’s defeat at the hands of Freiburg last weekend, Schubert said: 
“They’re two different games, two different competitions; you can’t win every 
game. We weren’t good enough on Saturday but that has little to do with 
tomorrow’s game. City are favourites. Their results speak for themselves. They 
have a very good chance [of winning the competition]. They are trying to soften 
expectations but are one of the best teams in the world, have spent a lot of 
money and have one of the best coaches in the world on the bench.”

Pep Guardiola speaks

“It was a pleasure to be the coach of Barcelona and Bayern and [with] their 
history they are used to reaching semis and finals,” said the Manchester City 
manager at his pre-match press conference. “Manchester City don’t have that. 
[Roberto] Mancini helped us achieve the first step and Manuel did a really good 
job to reach the semi-finals. We have big, big targets in theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague>. We are far to compete 
from the best teams in Europe. We have to improve a lot of things. We’re first 
in the Premier League but the way we have played until now, it will be not 
enough to win the Premier League so you have to improve.”

On tonight’s opposition, he had this to say: “Gladbach are a brave team, one 
of the best teams in Europe right now. They have a lot of quality. The draw was 
difficult for us. They beat me many times [two of the last four meetings, the 
other two were draws] and they are aggressive. They make the game one-on-one in 
the build-up and when that happens it is a fight, man to man. With the ball 
they are so, so intelligent.”

Match preview

Following their scintillating win over Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report>
 at the weekend, Manchester City return to action on the European front, 
opening this year’s Champions league campaign with a home match against 
Borussia Mönchengladbach. The German side finished fourth in the Bundesliga 
last season and qualified for the group stages of this tournament with a 
thumping aggregate win over Swiss side Young Boys, who had their pants pulled 
down and were subjected to a painful 9-2 spanking across both legs. Managed by 
André Schubert, Mönchengladbach were in the same group as Manuel Pellegrini’s 
Manchester City last season, losing 2-1 at home and 4-2 at the Etihad. With 
City now managed by Pep Guardiola, Schubert will be hopeful of taking something 
from tonight’s game. His Mönchengladbach side went unbeaten against Guardiola’s 
Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga last season, winning 3-1 at home and drawing 
against the eventual champions on their travels.

Manchester City v Borussia Mönchengladbach tie postponed

Well, it’s been brief but thank for your time and attention. I can’t apologise 
enough for not being able to bring you lots of lovely minute-by-minutely 
action, but it’s not really my fault. Rain in Manchester, eh? Who’d a thunk it. 
If you’re feeling starved of football action, feel free to tune into our 
minute-by-minute report ofPSG v Arsenal

, which are both very much on.

Gladbach’s players and officials have walked out on to the pitch and ambled 
down to the away end to salute their supporters, who are in very jubilant mood 
despite having their Tuesday night football parade quite literally rained on. 
Fans applaud players and the gesture is reciprocated. The players turn to 
return to the dressing room and are loudly summoned back, where everyone enjoys 
an Icelandic thunderclap.
 
Uefa have said they’ll wait until later this evening to make an announcement 
about when the match will be replayed. It’s a decision that will be made by the 
referee, officials from the two clubs and Uefa, who have to decide whether to 
play tomorrow at some other later date. Despite being asked to make their out 
of the ground, Gladbach’s fans are still in situ, singing loudly and demanding 
to see their team. You’ve got to feel sorry for them; most probably have 
flights home booked for later this evening or tomorrow morning and will 
probably miss the rescheduled match. Gladbach are due to play Werder Bremen on 
Saturday, while City will face Bournemouth on the same day.

Sergio Aguero is shown in the tunnel and he looks a bit surprised to learn 
that the game is off. The pitch is draining brilliantly and does currently look 
playable, with some City staff out on it kicking a ball around with little sign 
of adverse effects. However, it seems that circumstances outside the ground may 
have prompted the decision to postpone the match.

I’m told the local Metrolink is down, which will cause all sorts of bother for 
fans trying to get to the game, while certain areas around the ground have been 
closed down due to flooding. The rain is still spilling down and footage of 
Bjorn Kuipers’ pitch inspection show that the ball simply wasn’t bouncing or 
moving. The pitch is draining well, but with the downpour showing no sign of 
abating, it’s difficult to see the match going ahead. With several hundred 
Gladbach fans sitting topless in the stadium, the DJ is currently entertaining 
them with a rendition of ...
 
The rain is due to ease off in the next hour or so, but referee Bjorn Kuipers 
is expected to make a decision on what to do next in the next 15 or 20 minutes.

The stadium is practically empty due to weather-induced problems with the 
public transport, the fanzone at City Square has been closed because of the 
adverse weather conditions and referee Björn Kuipers and his assistants have 
been out on the pitch bouncing a ball and inspecting the surface. The 
torrential rain is showing no sign of easing and it’s not looking good. If the 
game is postponed, it may be played tomorrow night instead.

Jamie Jackson, our man at the Etihad Stadium, has just phoned the office to 
say the game may succumb to the weather and be called off. It’s 32 degrees 
centigrade in London and pelting down with rain in Manchester. Go figure. More 
news as we get it ...
 
“We want to be courageous and brave, we always go into games feeling we are up 
for it and up for a victory rather than feeling we are going to lose,” said 
Schubert when he addressed the press last night. “It will take a lot of courage 
– we need to push ourselves all the way as we are up against a very strong 
team.”

On his side’s defeat at the hands of Freiburg last weekend, Schubert said: 
“They’re two different games, two different competitions; you can’t win every 
game. We weren’t good enough on Saturday but that has little to do with 
tomorrow’s game. City are favourites. Their results speak for themselves. They 
have a very good chance [of winning the competition]. They are trying to soften 
expectations but are one of the best teams in the world, have spent a lot of 
money and have one of the best coaches in the world on the bench.”

“It was a pleasure to be the coach of Barcelona and Bayern and [with] their 
history they are used to reaching semis and finals,” said the Manchester City 
manager at his pre-match press conference. “Manchester City don’t have that. 
[Roberto] Mancini helped us achieve the first step and Manuel did a really good 
job to reach the semi-finals. We have big, big targets in theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague>. We are far to compete 
from the best teams in Europe. We have to improve a lot of things. We’re first 
in the Premier League but the way we have played until now, it will be not 
enough to win the Premier League so you have to improve.”

On tonight’s opposition, he had this to say: “Gladbach are a brave team, one 
of the best teams in Europe right now. They have a lot of quality. The draw was 
difficult for us. They beat me many times [two of the last four meetings, the 
other two were draws] and they are aggressive. They make the game one-on-one in 
the build-up and when that happens it is a fight, man to man. With the ball 
they are so, so intelligent.”
