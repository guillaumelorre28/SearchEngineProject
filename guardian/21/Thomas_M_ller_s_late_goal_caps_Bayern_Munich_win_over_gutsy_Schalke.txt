The hosts levelled with their first chance of the game as Max Meyer rounded 
off a superb break launched by teenager Leroy Sané.

Schalke, however, were caught napping in the 69th minute when Javi Martínez 
was left unmarked in the box and rose high to head in an Arjen Robben cross.

Robert Lewandowski went close to adding another goal late in the game when he 
hit the post with a low shot but Thomas Müller slotted in with a clever effort 
from a tight angle in stoppage time for Bayern’s third.

Bayern’s 12th win from 13 league games moved them on to 37 points with 
Dortmund on 29, following their surprise 3-1 loss on Friday.

Schubert, who took over after five straight losses at the start of the season, 
matched their great former coach Udo Lattek’s record from the 1975/76 season 
with seven wins and a draw so far.

Ibrahima Traoré put the hosts ahead before Artur Sobiech’s 65th-minute 
equaliser for Hanover. Raffael was left unmarked five minutes from the end and 
he did not miss, tapping in the winner to lift Gladbach, who also twice hit the 
woodwork, to fourth on 22 points.

Wolfsburg remain two points ahead in third place after easing past Bremen with 
Alejandro Gálvez scoring an own goal before the hosts doubled their lead 
through Kruse on the stroke of halftime. The Wolves netted four times in the 
second half, with Kruse completing the rout with his second goal in the 87th 
minute.

Hakan Calhanoglu capped Bayer Leverkusen’s 3-1 victory over Eintracht
