As chief executive of Barnsley council up to 2012 I was party to the early, 
difficult discussions about the formation of the Sheffield city region; 
difficult because Derbyshire county council (and, similarly, Nottinghamshire 
county council) refused to engage in a sensible discussion about adapting 
institutional arrangements to reflect the reality of the economic geography of 
the sub-region. Economic data shows that Chesterfield is indeed part of the 
Sheffield city region economic area. The economic centre of gravity of 
Derbyshire itself lies to the south, in Derby’s relationship with Nottingham 
and Leicester.

Your editorial (Derbyshire’s dilemma pits cash against identity and democracy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/28/the-guardian-view-on-english-local-identities-a-clash-of-cash-against-community>
, 29 December) is wrong to say this argument is about council cuts and local 
councils “clutching at any cash straws they can”. Rather, it is about 
Chesterfield having the freedom to take its own decisions on its economic 
future, free from the dominion traditionally exercised by the county council. 
This need not threaten the historic and ceremonial ties with Chesterfield as 
part of Derbyshire, or even the pattern of most local service provision for 
Chesterfield residents. But it does require a change in the imperial mindset of 
the county council towards its district councils. The leadership of 
Chesterfield council should be congratulated for challenging the status quo, in 
the economic interests of their residents.

• As the daughter of a former town clerk of Chesterfield, who worked so hard 
on behalf of Chesterfield borough council to achieve intermediate area status 
for the town in 1974, it was so sad to read of the present council’s attempt to 
attach itself to the emerging city region of Sheffield. Intermediate area 
status gave Chesterfield economic stability and offered no threat to its 
historic identity. How depressing that the government’s draconian reduction of 
the grant to local authorities and its insensitivity to long-established local 
roots is reducing Chesterfield to such an undignified scramble for survival.

• It is not true that “there has never been any serious tradition of 
Chesterfield regarding itself as part of Greater Sheffield”; for 15 years from 
1979 to 1994 Chesterfield, North East Derbyshire and Sheffield elected a member 
of the European Parliament. As the first MEP for the constituency 1979-84, I 
can say at first hand that the whole constituency benefited, not just through 
local government but also the ties with two world-class universities, the 
counties’ second largest teaching hospital and one of only four children’s 
hospitals in the country. Not only are they major employers but the spin-off 
from these institutions through their knowledge bank and economic clout 
benefits not only the cultural and sporting fabric of the Sheffield city 
region, but the whole region’s manufacturing and wealth-creating base, which 
includes Chesterfield.

Bassetlaw too has expressed a desire to become part of the Sheffield city 
region.

County identity is a key aspect of Englishness, and Derbyshire is not the only 
historic county under threat

• Having commuted between Sheffield and Derby via Chesterfield along the A61 
for 15 years, I found your leader struck several chords. In a mobile society, 
issues of local identity can no longer be seen in purely binary terms, and all 
sorts of practical and emotional belongings are projected onto historical and 
municipal boundaries. Similarly, many communities that find themselves between 
two staging posts have a certain Janus quality, and road and rail links afford 
Chesterfield both a northward and southward perspective. What is more, 
Chesterfield is served by both BBC RadioDerby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/derby> and BBC Radio Sheffield, indicating that 
radio waves and local identity are less respectful of boundaries than we might 
suppose.

• When I played football for my grammar school here in Derby we had an annual 
fixture with a school in Sheffield. The steel city seemed to be in a distant 
land and locals stood on the touchline baying “Derbyshire born, Derbyshire 
bred, strong in’t arm weak in’t head’. I was one of the 92% of respondents 
opposed to Chesterfield joining Sheffield when the county council organised its 
online poll. I would like to think that the late Tony Benn (MP for Chesterfield 
1984-2001) would have voted likewise.

• County identity is a key aspect of Englishness, and Derbyshire is not the 
only historic county under threat. Despite ambitions by some in the city 
councils of Southampton and Portsmouth to split Hampshire – mentioned in the 
Anglo Saxon Chronicle entry for AD755 – into two or more parts, a recent Ipsos 
Mori survey showed only 22% of Hampshire residents favoured such a division. 
Parish councils in East Hampshire have expressed deep concern at being included 
in a Greater Portsmouth or Solent City, as well they might, with some being 
closer to Reading or Guildford than they are to Portsmouth, let alone 
Southampton.

Modern patterns of economic life are complex and there are no clear straight 
lines that put us into clear and distinct areas. Hampshire probably splits into 
at least six economic areas that overlap each other. What we do know is that to 
split administrative areas and disaggregate services is expensive and loses 
economies of scale. I am so grateful the government has recognised these facts 
and resisted moves to split this and other counties.
Cllr Roy Perry
Leader, Hampshire county council

• Ministers may well mess with medieval county boundaries “at their peril’ but 
older people in Rhyl, Prestatyn and St Asaph have resided in three counties 
since the 1970s without ever having moved house. First in Flintshire (then a 
county in three separate parts), before local government reorganisation in 1974 
placed them in Clwyd. With the demise of Clwyd they now find themselves in 
Denbighshire, while Flintshire has been reinstated as a smaller county, and 
without its exclaves, the larger of which had been situated between 
Denbighshire and Shropshire. Proposals for Chesterfield to be an exclave of a 
Greater Sheffield seem straightforward in comparison.

• The dilemma facing Derbyshire is, as you suggest, played out in many other 
parts of England, not least in the north. New local government structures have 
been imposed on a reluctant population and the latest move to unaccountable 
city regions is a further step away from democratic government. The one crumb 
being offered in some city regions is elected city mayors. Yet, unlike Greater 
London, they will not be scrutinised by an elected assembly.

 Many people in towns such as Bolton, above, regard themselves as Lancastrians

In Greater Manchester <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/greater-manchester> many 
people in towns such as Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale and Wigan (all of which once 
had strong local government, now hollowed-out shells) regard themselves as 
Lancastrians – not “Greater Mancunians” – and above that, as northerners. A new 
constitutional settlement for the north should recognise these identities, 
instead of trampling on them.

• Never mind the angst over Chesterfield and the Sheffield city region. Here 
in Cheshire the equivalent happened two years ago, with the inclusion of the 
borough of Halton in theLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/liverpool> 
city region. Although contiguous with other boroughs in the city region, Halton 
is constitutionally one of the four boroughs that make up the county of 
Cheshire. The sizeable part of the borough to the south of the Mersey is 
actually part of the historic county palatine of Cheshire.

The consequences for the voters of Halton are mind-boggling. For services such 
as economic development, transport and housing they must look to Liverpool city 
region, for whose “metro mayor” they have a vote. For the main local government 
services, education and personal social services, they continue to look to 
Halton borough, for whose council they have a vote and one of whose members is 
mayor of Halton itself. The police service (like the fire service) is a county 
function, so they also have a vote for the Cheshire police and crime 
commissioner. And for all legal and ceremonial purposes Halton is fully part of 
Cheshire county under the lord lieutenant.

It is true that our country can no longer define itself by the coherence or 
equity of its policies, but even so this is a truly tangled web. Ironically the 
sleepy rural village of Daresbury, at the eastern edge of Halton and the 
birthplace of Rev Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), can now if it wishes see 
itself as a dynamic part of the thrusting new Liverpool city region!

• The 1969 Redcliffe Maud report recommended abolition of all local 
authorities (except London) and the creation of city regions based on large 
towns which were already employment, commercial and recreational centres and, 
crucially, to my mind, centres of local travel patterns.  The election of the 
Conservatives in 1970 saw the end of this sensible proposal, since counties, 
widely run by Tories, saw in the plan the loss of their local political power. 
As a result we ended up with a dog’s breakfast of a local government structure 
made worse by the abolition of metropolitan counties in 1986 and now the 
creation of disparate unitary authorities in some parts of the country.
