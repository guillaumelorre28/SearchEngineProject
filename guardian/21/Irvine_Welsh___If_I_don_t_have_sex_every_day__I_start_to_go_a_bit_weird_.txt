When were you happiest? 
Happiness is mostly intrinsic: you’re either a happy soul or a miserable 
bastard. Fortunately, I’m the former.

What is your greatest fear? 
I don’t fear death, but I do fear being taken from loved ones. I’m also 
concerned that it might be shite.

What is your earliest memory?
Saying goodnight to Bunny, an imaginatively named toy rabbit.

Which living person do you most admire, and why?
Artists who do their own thing, without compromise: Ken Loach, Bob Dylan and 
James Kelman.

What was your most embarrassing moment?
One place I worked, the boss asked how I was getting on. I told him about one 
woman who was a nightmare. His face went ashen. I later found out she was his 
wife.

What is your screensaver?
The aftermath of David Gray’s winner in the Scottish Cup final 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iS6orteb2M>.

What do you most dislike about your appearance?
Saggy skin, wrinkles and creases.

Who would play you in the film of your life?
There’s nobody cool enough.

What is your most unappealing habit?
Raw greed.

What is your favourite smell?
The sea. I run down to the lake in Chicago every day to take in that massive 
inland sea.

Which book changed your life?
Trainspotting. It gave me money, fame and freedom.

What is the worst thing anyone’s said to you?
“I just don’t recognise you any more and I don’t want to spend any more time 
getting to know an unlikable stranger who is the very same as every other drug 
addict.” That was devastatingly hard to take, but it was (eventually) very 
helpful.

What is your guiltiest pleasure?
A chocolate doughnut, after my boxing training.

What does love feel like?
When you can barely stand to look at someone without turning away to catch 
your breath.

Which living person do you most despise, and why?
I have the capacity to dislike anybody, but it’s only fleeting; I don’t have 
the emotional energy actively to despise them.

What is the worst job you’ve done?
Laying down slabs for the council.

How often do you have sex?
If I don’t have sex every day, I start to go a bit weird. It makes travelling 
difficult.

What is the closest you’ve come to death?
When a pal grabbed hold of me as I fell into an unbanistered stairwell at a 
rave. Would have been curtains, but for his sharp reaction.

What do you consider your greatest achievement?
I haven’t achieved anything of note yet.

What has been your biggest disappointment?
There’s been the odd beauty on the dance floor I really ought to have gone 
home with.
