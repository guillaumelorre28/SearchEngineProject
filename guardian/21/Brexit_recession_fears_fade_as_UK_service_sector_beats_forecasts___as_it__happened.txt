Back to Greece where tensions are mounting over home repossessions with 
clashes erupting between indebted home owners and riot police outside a court 
in Thessaloniki this afternoon. Helena Smith reports:

Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes 
broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. 
Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a 
citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police 
reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to 
stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who 
had defaulted on a €300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a 
father- of-six, who also owed €80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he 
had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had 
suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated.

Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp 
end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken 
country’s rescue from insolvency.

But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in 
non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of 
the €900bn worth of bad loans in the area around €100bn belong to the 
portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 
1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over €300bn 
in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the 
government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months 
ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns 
that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, 
the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently 
warned: “Citizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It 
is to nobody’s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who 
will look after them, who will pay property tax?”

The Greek real estate market – with the exception of that on popular Greek 
islands – is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens 
having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

European markets end mixed

A mild recovery in the pound after better than expected UK service sector 
numbers saw the FTSE 100 drift back after Tuesday’s - failed - attempt at a new 
record. Meanwhile talk that the European Central Bank might begin tapering its 
bond buying programme took the wind out of European markets, with most ending 
lower. But strong US services data lifted Wall Street, albeit also prompting 
renewed talk of US rate rises this year. The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 41.09 points or 0.58% at 7033.25 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.32% to 10,585.78 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 4489.95 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB added 1.03% to 16,476.58 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.11% at 8778.3 
 * In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.66% to 575.37 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 129 points or 
0.71%.

As for the pound, it is up 0.17% at $1.2748 against the dollar and 0.19% 
higher at €1.1378.

4.19pm BST 16:19  <> 

After Tuesday’s attempt at a new peak, the FTSE 100 continues to flounder as 
the day wears on. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

 Today has seen a reversal of yesterday’s action, when the FTSE 100 soared (at 
least in the morning) as others fell back. Now, we have Wall Street advancing, 
and European markets paring losses, while the FTSE 100 languishes towards the 
bottom end of the day’s range. Having been such a boon in recent days, the 
pound has perhaps hindered the index today, although sterling has recovered 
only a fraction of the ground lost since the beginning of the week...

 The US ISM non-manufacturing index hit a level not seen since November 2015, 
further boosting the cause of those expecting a Fed rate hike this year. US 
markets seemed happy to rally on the news, making up for the losses suffered 
yesterday. 2140 has held yet again for the S&P 500, putting the index in a good 
position to challenge the all-time highs once again. A bounce in oil prices 
undoubtedly helped, after stockpiles dropped once again.

Back with the IMF, and in a new report it says global debt has hit a new 
record. Jill Treanor reports:

Global debt levels have reached a record $152tn (£119tn) according to the 
International Monetary Fund – more than double the size of the global economy 
at 225% of annual global output.

The Washington-based fund said that two-thirds of the debt – approximately 
$100tn is held by the private sector, or companies and households. The IMF 
warns that debt “can carry great risks [at] excessive levels”.

 The Fund’s report shows that the overall debt level has not decreased since 
the the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09, despite the fact that the 
most severe downturn of the post-war era was the consequence of too much 
reckless borrowing.

The IMF says that debt as a proportion of GDP has never been higher.

Elsewhere the International Monetary Fund has weighed in on Deutsche Bank, 
saying it was one of the banks which needed to convince investors its business 
model was viable in a low interest rate environment. The bank’s shares have 
fallen sharply on concerns about its balance sheet and the consequences of a 
possible $14bn fine by the US Department of Justice.

At the IMF meeting in Washington, the fund’s monetary and capital markets 
deputy director Peter Dattels said (quotes from Reuters):

Deutsche Bank... is among banks that need to continue to adjust to convince 
investors that its business model is viable going forward and has addressed the 
issues of operational risk arising from litigation.

He said the German authorities were closely monitoring Deutsche Bank’s health

Despite these strong service sector figures Dennis de Jong, managing director 
at UFX.com, believes a US rate rise before December is unlikely:

After slipping to a six-year low in August, the news that September’s ISM 
non-manufacturing PMI has rebounded strongly will be welcomed by Fed Chair 
Janet Yellen.

The US economy has been sending out mixed signals in recent months, and the 
uncertainty has not been helped by the speculation swirling around a 
long-anticipated interest rate hike.

Today’s positive figures make the case for a rate rise stronger but, as we 
enter the final weeks of the presidential race, the general consensus is that 
it is unlikely we will see any movement before December.

But the surveys could be an indicator for Friday’s jobs figures:

Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM’s non-manufacturing survey committee, said:

The comments from the respondents are mostly positive about business 
conditions and the overall economy. A degree of uncertainty does exist due to 
geopolitical conditions coupled with the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

And here are some of the comments highlighted by the ISM:


 * “Somewhat flat month of overall pricing conditions; however, labor cost and 
availability remains a concern.” (Accommodation & Food Services)

 * “Business is showing a moderate unexpected uptick over last month. YTD 
business volume is moderately under forecast.” (Management of Companies & 
Support Services) 
 * “Macroeconomic issues like Brexit and reduced travel from South America 
impact summer travel.” (Arts, Entertainment & Recreation) 
 * “Sales ahead of plan. Net income below plan. Costs running higher than 
plan. In addition, continued low interest rates impact investment results.” 
(Finance & Insurance) 
 * “Affordable Care Act, changes in Medicare and Medicaid causing problems 
across much of the healthcare and insurance industries. Acquisition helping our 
company, but also lost a large client that will impact our financials for the 
next year.” (Health Care & Social Assistance) 
 * “Solid steady growth.” (Professional, Scientific & Technical Services) 
 * “Business is [at] an annual high.” (Public Administration) 
 * “Sales continue [at an] increased pace from last month.” (Retail Trade) 
 * “We are watching the effects of the Hanjin Shipping issues with regard to 
cost and availability of Asian imports.” (Wholesale Trade) Facebook

The Institute for Supply Management service sector survey is also positive, 
even more so in fact.

Its non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.1 in September, showing a strong 
rebound from 51.4 in August and well above estimates of a figure of 53. This is 
the highest level since October 2015 and the biggest rise in the index since 
February 2011.

US service sector improves in September

The first of the US service sector surveys shows a better than expected 
performance in September.

The Markit services final purchasing managers’ index came in at 52.3 compared 
to an initial reading of 51.9 and a figure of 51 in August. This is the highest 
level since April.

Markit’s final composite PMI figure for September was 52.3, up from the first 
reading of 52 and August’s 51.5.

The ADP report still shows a strong jobs market, said Mark Zandi, chief 
economist of co-complier Moody’s Analytics:

The current record of consecutive monthly job gains continued in September. 
With job openings at all-time highs and layoffs near all-time lows, the job 
market remains in full-swing. Job growth has moderated in recent months, but 
only because the economy is finally returning to full-employment.

But Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and head of the ADP Research Institute, said:

Job gains in September eased a bit when compared to the past 12-month average. 
We also observed softening this month in trade/transportation/utilities, 
possibly due to a continued tightening U.S. labor market and lackluster 
consumer spending.

Back to Greece where tensions are mounting over home repossessions with 
clashes erupting between indebted home owners and riot police outside a court 
in Thessaloniki this afternoon. Helena Smith reports:

Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes 
broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. 
Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a 
citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police 
reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to 
stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who 
had defaulted on a €300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a 
father- of-six, who also owed €80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he 
had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had 
suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated.

Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp 
end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken 
country’s rescue from insolvency.

But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in 
non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of 
the €900bn worth of bad loans in the area around €100bn belong to the 
portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 
1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over €300bn 
in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the 
government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months 
ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns 
that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, 
the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently 
warned: “Citizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It 
is to nobody’s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who 
will look after them, who will pay property tax?”

The Greek real estate market – with the exception of that on popular Greek 
islands – is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens 
having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

 
A mild recovery in the pound after better than expected UK service sector 
numbers saw the FTSE 100 drift back after Tuesday’s - failed - attempt at a new 
record. Meanwhile talk that the European Central Bank might begin tapering its 
bond buying programme took the wind out of European markets, with most ending 
lower. But strong US services data lifted Wall Street, albeit also prompting 
renewed talk of US rate rises this year. The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 41.09 points or 0.58% at 7033.25 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.32% to 10,585.78 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 4489.95 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB added 1.03% to 16,476.58 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.11% at 8778.3 
 * In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.66% to 575.37 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 129 points or 
0.71%.

As for the pound, it is up 0.17% at $1.2748 against the dollar and 0.19% 
higher at €1.1378.
 
After Tuesday’s attempt at a new peak, the FTSE 100 continues to flounder as 
the day wears on. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

 Today has seen a reversal of yesterday’s action, when the FTSE 100 soared (at 
least in the morning) as others fell back. Now, we have Wall Street advancing, 
and European markets paring losses, while the FTSE 100 languishes towards the 
bottom end of the day’s range. Having been such a boon in recent days, the 
pound has perhaps hindered the index today, although sterling has recovered 
only a fraction of the ground lost since the beginning of the week...

 The US ISM non-manufacturing index hit a level not seen since November 2015, 
further boosting the cause of those expecting a Fed rate hike this year. US 
markets seemed happy to rally on the news, making up for the losses suffered 
yesterday. 2140 has held yet again for the S&P 500, putting the index in a good 
position to challenge the all-time highs once again. A bounce in oil prices 
undoubtedly helped, after stockpiles dropped once again.
 
Back with the IMF, and in a new report it says global debt has hit a new 
record. Jill Treanor reports:

Global debt levels have reached a record $152tn (£119tn) according to the 
International Monetary Fund – more than double the size of the global economy 
at 225% of annual global output.

The Washington-based fund said that two-thirds of the debt – approximately 
$100tn is held by the private sector, or companies and households. The IMF 
warns that debt “can carry great risks [at] excessive levels”.

 The Fund’s report shows that the overall debt level has not decreased since 
the the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09, despite the fact that the 
most severe downturn of the post-war era was the consequence of too much 
reckless borrowing.

The IMF says that debt as a proportion of GDP has never been higher.

Elsewhere the International Monetary Fund has weighed in on Deutsche Bank, 
saying it was one of the banks which needed to convince investors its business 
model was viable in a low interest rate environment. The bank’s shares have 
fallen sharply on concerns about its balance sheet and the consequences of a 
possible $14bn fine by the US Department of Justice.

At the IMF meeting in Washington, the fund’s monetary and capital markets 
deputy director Peter Dattels said (quotes from Reuters):

Deutsche Bank... is among banks that need to continue to adjust to convince 
investors that its business model is viable going forward and has addressed the 
issues of operational risk arising from litigation.

He said the German authorities were closely monitoring Deutsche Bank’s health 
and that the European financial system remained resilient.

But which should investors look at most, the Markit or ISM figures?

Despite these strong service sector figures Dennis de Jong, managing director 
at UFX.com, believes a US rate rise before December is unlikely:

After slipping to a six-year low in August, the news that September’s ISM 
non-manufacturing PMI has rebounded strongly will be welcomed by Fed Chair 
Janet Yellen.

The US economy has been sending out mixed signals in recent months, and the 
uncertainty has not been helped by the speculation swirling around a 
long-anticipated interest rate hike.

Today’s positive figures make the case for a rate rise stronger but, as we 
enter the final weeks of the presidential race, the general consensus is that 
it is unlikely we will see any movement before December.

But the surveys could be an indicator for Friday’s jobs figures:

Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM’s non-manufacturing survey committee, said:

The comments from the respondents are mostly positive about business 
conditions and the overall economy. A degree of uncertainty does exist due to 
geopolitical conditions coupled with the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

And here are some of the comments highlighted by the ISM:


 * “Somewhat flat month of overall pricing conditions; however, labor cost and 
availability remains a concern.” (Accommodation & Food Services)

 * “Business is showing a moderate unexpected uptick over last month. YTD 
business volume is moderately under forecast.” (Management of Companies & 
Support Services) 
 * “Macroeconomic issues like Brexit and reduced travel from South America 
impact summer travel.” (Arts, Entertainment & Recreation) 
 * “Sales ahead of plan. Net income below plan. Costs running higher than 
plan. In addition, continued low interest rates impact investment results.” 
(Finance & Insurance) 
 * “Affordable Care Act, changes in Medicare and Medicaid causing problems 
across much of the healthcare and insurance industries. Acquisition helping our 
company, but also lost a large client that will impact our financials for the 
next year.” (Health Care & Social Assistance) 
 * “Solid steady growth.” (Professional, Scientific & Technical Services) 
 * “Business is [at] an annual high.” (Public Administration) 
 * “Sales continue [at an] increased pace from last month.” (Retail Trade) 
 * “We are watching the effects of the Hanjin Shipping issues with regard to 
cost and availability of Asian imports.” (Wholesale Trade)  
The Institute for Supply Management service sector survey is also positive, 
even more so in fact.

Its non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.1 in September, showing a strong 
rebound from 51.4 in August and well above estimates of a figure of 53. This is 
the highest level since October 2015 and the biggest rise in the index since 
February 2011.
 
The first of the US service sector surveys shows a better than expected 
performance in September.

The Markit services final purchasing managers’ index came in at 52.3 compared 
to an initial reading of 51.9 and a figure of 51 in August. This is the highest 
level since April.

Markit’s final composite PMI figure for September was 52.3, up from the first 
reading of 52 and August’s 51.5.

The ADP report still shows a strong jobs market, said Mark Zandi, chief 
economist of co-complier Moody’s Analytics:

The current record of consecutive monthly job gains continued in September. 
With job openings at all-time highs and layoffs near all-time lows, the job 
market remains in full-swing. Job growth has moderated in recent months, but 
only because the economy is finally returning to full-employment.

But Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and head of the ADP Research Institute, said:

Job gains in September eased a bit when compared to the past 12-month average. 
We also observed softening this month in trade/transportation/utilities, 
possibly due to a continued tightening U.S. labor market and lackluster 
consumer spending.
