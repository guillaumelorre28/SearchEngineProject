Integrity Unit which will oversee the sport’s anti-doping programme will be 
launched in April next year and have a budget of £6.4m, the world governing 
body has announced.

The integrity unit was the key component of International Association of 
Athletics Federations presidentLord Coe’s reform programme

In a statement on Monday the IAAF <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/iaaf> 
said: “The Integrity Unit with a budget of $8m will be launched on 3 April 2017 
with an independent governance board, independent review panels and an 
independent staff to manage the anti-doping and other integrity-related 
programmes in elite athletics.”

Coe said: “I am delighted that the planning for this is now well under way and 
will accelerate as we head towards the beginning of April 2017 when the unit is 
due to be operational. We’re now inviting individuals with the necessary skills 
and relevant experience for either the leadership role or board positions to 
register their interest.”

The IAAF on Monday advertised for the role of head of the integrity unit as 
well as three board positions.

Coe’s reforms are intended to help restore the credibility of athletics, which 
has been damaged by doping and corruption scandals.
