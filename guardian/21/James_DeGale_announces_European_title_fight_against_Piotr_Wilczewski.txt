The former British super-middleweight champion James DeGale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> will fight Poland's Piotr 
Wilczewski for the European title in September. The Londoner has been eager to 
get back into the ring after losing his British title to George Groves on a 
points decision in May.

Wilczewski, who is ranked third in the world by the WBO, has lost only once in 
30 fights and captured the vacant European and WBO intercontinental titles with 
a an 11th-round stoppage of Amin Asikainen in March.

"Challenging for the European title is a fantastic opportunity to get myself 
back in the big picture in my first fight back," said 25-year-old DeGale. "I've 
been hard in training since my last fight and I'm ready to box tomorrow if I 
need to, come September I'll be in great shape.

"The fight with Groves is in the past. I still believe I beat him, but I'm a 
positive person and now I'm focused on the future and a win will put me in a 
great position for a world title. My promoter, Frank Warren, has done a great 
job in getting me home advantage for this title shot and now I've got to go out 
there, do the business and win it in style.

"In fact, I'm about to sign a new three-year deal with Frank and I'm really 
happy that he will continue to build my career as he has done since I turned 
professional. He brought Amir Khan back from a devastating knockout loss to a 
world title in only three fights so I know that he can do it for me."

Warren said: "This is a make-or-break fight for James. He's got a big 
opportunity in front of him against Wilczewski and now has to go out there a 
deliver the goods and show the fans what he can do."
