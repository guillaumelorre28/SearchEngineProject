The first clue was provided by moles. As the creatures burrowed beneath a 
farmer’s field close to the border between England andWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>, they threw up fragments of what 
appeared to be medieval pottery.

Stuart Wilson, an archaeology graduate who was working in a toll bridge booth, 
took a gamble and bought the field for £32,000 when he could have been 
investing in his first house.

Over the past 15 years he and a hardy band of volunteers have painstakingly 
unearthed what they believe are the remains of a sprawling medieval city.

Wilson, 37, is preparing for an exciting 2017. When the weather improves he 
and his colleagues will continue their work on the site, focusing particularly 
on what he says is the skeleton of a moated manor house.

He is applying for planning permission for an interpretation centre to tell 
visitors about thelost city of Trellech 
<http://www.lostcityoftrellech.co.uk/index.html>, and for a campsite for 
tourists and helpers.

After facing years of scepticism from some within the archaeology community, 
he is now being listened to seriously. Before Christmashe was invited

by Cardiff Archaeological Society 
<http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/history-archaeology-religion/events/cardiff-archaeological-society-lectures>
 to speak at Cardiff University.

Wilson said his decision to buy the land had been vindicated. “People thought 
I was mad and really I should have bought a house rather than a field,” he 
said. “But it turned out to be the best decision of my life. I don’t regret it 
at all.”

Back at the turn of the century, professional, well-equipped archeologists 
were trying to find the remains of the city but were focusing on the modern 
village of Trellech, on the Welsh side of the border between Tintern andMonmouth

.

In 2002 a farmer told the Monmouth Archaeological Society about the pottery 
that had been found in molehills on his land outside the village.

“I went and took a look,” said Wilson. He investigated the site and within 
minutes had found what he believed was the remains of a wall. “That was a very 
good start,” he said.

Two years later the 4.6-acre plot came up for sale and Wilson took a punt. 
“Much more experienced people were saying the city wasn’t there but I was young 
and confident,” he said. “If I was right the high street was right there in 
that field. It was a wonderful opportunity.”

Wilson gave up his job so he could focus on the dig

Over the years he estimates that about 1,000 people have joined him, from 
archaeology students to intrigued people from the area.

He said he had so far pinpointed eight buildings, adding: “We’re finding 
building after building after building.”

A manor house, thought to have included two halls and a courtyard, may be the 
most spectacular but Wilson is fond of a well that was unearthed containing 
pieces of wood, bone and leather. Other features discovered include parts of 
jugs, cooking vessels, fireplaces and drains.

One of the best finds last year was more ancient: a flint knapping kit thought 
to date back toneolithic times 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/10/neolithic-skeleton-oldest-case-rickets-hebrides>
. “I’ve asked the person who found that to come again,” he said. “They are 
clearly lucky.”

Wilson said the city was once home to about 10,000 people, perhaps a quarter 
of the size of London’s population at the time. He said the settlement was 
founded by a family called De Clare in the 13th century to manufacture weapons, 
armour and other military equipment.

Agricultural workers were tempted into the city by the prospect of more 
lucrative employment. “If you’re working in the fields you are living hand to 
mouth every single day – it’s a really hard existence,” said Wilson. “Suddenly, 
a big industrial town comes here, this is a great opportunity for you. You up 
sticks and move to the industrial town where the opportunity is.”

Most of the buildings, according to Wilson, seem to date from when the town 
was reorganised and built in stone after attacks by both English and Welsh 
forces. Evidence of the earlier town has been found below some of the buildings 
and occupation on the site may have started 100 years before that again, he 
believes.


The city did not last long as a major centre. It was attacked by enemies of 
the De Clares and ravaged by disease. In later centuries fighters led by the 
Welsh leaderOwain Glyndŵr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/14/on-the-owain-glyndwr-trail-wales-uk>
 targeted Trellech and it fell into ruin.

Wilson’s project has not been cheap. He estimates that it may have cost as 
much as £200,000 over 15 years. It has been funded by individual donations, 
commercial activities such as “experience days”, and through an online shop 
selling historical documents.

Wilson, who lives in a converted toilet block in Chepstow, believes that 
unearthing the city of Trellech will be his life’s work. “I think we’ve only 
found 0.1% of it,” he said.

This year’s digging season will start in the spring and students and 
volunteers are invited to sign up to join in with key excavations in July and 
August.

But what if Wilson’s gamble 15 years ago had come to nothing? “The field would 
have been a nice place to have a picnic.”
