wacky
not whacky

wagon
not waggon

Wags
wives and girlfriends (generally of footballers: the term was popularised 
during the 2006 World Cup, although Fabio Capello initially banned them from 
joining the 2010 team in South Africa); the singular is Wag. Regarded by many 
as sexist, although variations include Habs (husbands and boyfriends)

Wahhabism
branch of Islam practised by followers of the teachings of Muhammad ibn 
Abd-al-Wahhab (1703-92)

wah-wah pedal

waiver or waver?
To waive is to relinquish a claim or right, as in the much used headline 
“Britannia waives the rules”. The associated noun is waiver, which can lead to 
confusion with waver, meaning to hesitate (or a person waving).


Adding to the fun, waver is sometimes mixed up with haver, which in Scotland 
means to talk nonsense

wake
“in the wake of” is overused; nothing wrong with “as a result of” or simply 
“after”

Wales
avoid the word “principality”, and do not use as a unit of measurement (“50 
times the size of Wales”)

Wales Office
not Welsh Office

walking stick

Walkman

Watford Gap
service area on the M1 in Northamptonshire, near the village of Watford, 80 
miles north of London; nothing to do with the Hertfordshire town of Watford, 60 
miles away, with which it is sometimes confused by lazy writers who think such 
phrases as “anyone north of the Watford Gap” a witty way to depict the unwashed 
northern hordes

wayzgoose
traditional term for a printer’s works outing

weave (fabric)
past tense wove, past participle woven. This also applies when used 
metaphorically, as in “Obama’s speech was woven throughout with the language of

past tense weaved, past participle weaved, as in “Cameron dodged and weaved”

Chinese premier (prime minister) from 2002-12, having succeeded Zhu Rongji

west, western, the west, western Europe

western (cowboy film)

West Bank

West Bank barrier
should always be called a barrier when referred to in its totality, as it is 
in places a steel and barbed-wire fence and in others an eight-metre-high 
concrete wall; if referring to a particular section of it then calling it a 
fence or a wall may be appropriate. It can also be described as a “separation 
barrier/fence/wall” or “security barrier/fence/wall”, according to the nature 
of the article

west coast mainline

InterCity West Coast, currently operated by Virgin Trains

in their own constituencies

West Midlands

West Nile virus

Weyerhaeuser

what is 
a phrase that, while occasionally helpful to add emphasis, has become overused 
to the point of tedium; examples from the paper include:

“Beckham repaid the committed public support with what was a man-of-the-match 
performance ... “

“Principal among Schofield’s 19 recommendations in what is a wide-ranging 
report ... “

What is clear is that these would be improved by what would be the simple step 
of removing the offending phrase

wheelchair 
Say (if relevant) that someone uses a wheelchair, not that they are “in a 
wheelchair” or “wheelchair-bound” – stigmatising and offensive, as well as 
inaccurate

whence 
means “where from”, so don’t write “from whence” 

whereabouts 
singular: her whereabouts is not known 

which or that? 
This is quite easy, really: “that” defines, “which” gives extra information 
(often in a clause enclosed by commas):

This is the house that Jack built; but this house, which John built, is 
falling down. The Guardian, which I read every day, is the paper that I admire 
above all others. I am very proud of the sunflowers that I grew from seed (some 
of the sunflowers); I am very proud of the sunflowers, which I grew from seed 
(all the sunflowers).

Note that in such examples the sentence remains grammatical without “that” 
(the house Jack built, the paper I admire, the sunflowers I grew), but not 
without “which”

Which? 
the magazine, and the organisation that publishes it (formerly the Consumers’ 
Association)

while 
not whilst 

whisky, whiskey 
scotch whisky, or simply scotch, plural whiskies
Irish and American whiskey, plural whiskeys

whistleblower 

white 
lc in racial context 

white paper 

white-van man 

Whitsuntide, Whit Sunday 
not Whitsun 

whiz, whiz-kid
not whizz or wiz 

whodunnit 

who or whom? 
This is how to do it: “When it comes to sci-fi villains, few have endured as 
well as the Martians, whom HG Wells depicted wielding a weapon called the 
Heat-Ray in The War of the Worlds, back in 1898.”

And this is how not to do it: “A nation’s weeping turned to tears of joy with 
the news that Louie – for who media commentators had to commission new words 
for camp ... – is to star in his own 10-part series.”

Only those with a tin ear for language could be unaware that “who” sounds 
wrong in the second example, but it is not always so obvious.

If in doubt, ask yourself how the clause beginning who/whom would read in the 
form of a sentence giving he, him, she, her, they or them instead: if the 
who/whom person turns into he/she/they, then “who” is right; if it becomes 
him/her/them, then it should be “whom”.

In this example: “Straw was criticised for attacking Clegg, whom he despised” 
– “whom” is correct because he despised “him”.

But in “Straw attacked Clegg, who he thought was wrong” – “who” is correct, 
because it is “he” not “him” who is considered wrong.

Use of “whom” has all but disappeared from spoken English, and seems to be 
going the same way in most forms of written English too. If you are not sure, 
it is much better to use “who” when “whom” would traditionally have been 
required than to use “whom” incorrectly for “who”, something even great writers 
have been guilty of: “There was a big man whom I think was an hôtelier from 
Phnom Penh and a French girl I’d never seen before ...” (The Quiet American, 
Graham Greene – who as a former subeditor should have known better).

normally lc, whether taking their name from a region (eg beaujolais, bordeaux,

Burgundy, or a muscadet from the Loire valley – as are wines of individual 
chateaux, eg I enjoyed a glass of Cos d’Estournel 1970

cited as an example of American arrogance
