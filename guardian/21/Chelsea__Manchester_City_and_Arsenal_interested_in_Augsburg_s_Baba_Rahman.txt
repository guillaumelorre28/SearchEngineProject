Chelsea, Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> 
and Arsenal are among a stellar list of clubs to have registered an interest in 
signing Baba Rahman from the German side Augsburg, but they have been told the 
Ghana defender could cost up to €20m (£14m).

The 21-year-old, who joined Augsburg from Greuther Fürth only last summer, has 
also been the subject of inquiries from Roma, Juventus, Internazionale and
Atlético Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> after an 
impressive season in the Bundesliga.

But it is understood that he would favour a move to England this season, with 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> having contacted his 
representatives last month over making a potential bid. Manchester City are 
also keeping tabs on his situation as they search for a long-term solution to 
their problem left-back position, with neither Aleksandar Kolarov or Gaël 
Clichy having made the role his own.

Despite the presence of Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monreal in his squad, the 
Arsenal manager, Arsène Wenger, has also been impressed by Rahman, who helped
Augsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> finish fifth in the 
Bundesliga last season – the highest finish in the club’s history.

Last week, Augsburg’s sporting director Stefan Reuter insisted they wanted to 
hold on to a player who still has four years of his contract remaining.

“There is nothing concrete on our table with regard to Abdul Rahman Baba,” he 
told the German publication Kicker. “We are very happy to have him at our club, 
we are delighted he is playing for our club. We have been happy to hear him 
saying he feels great being with us.”

Rahman, who celebrated his 21st birthday on Thursday, returned to pre-season 
training this week having spent the close season in his homeland.
