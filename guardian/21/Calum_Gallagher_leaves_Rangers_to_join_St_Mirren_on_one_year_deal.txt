Gallagher made five first-team appearances for Rangers in the 2013-14 season 
and scored five goals in 10 games on loan at Cowdenbeath in the Championship 
last term before making a further substitute appearance for Rangers under the 
management of Stuart McCall.

Ian Murray, the Saints manager, told the club’s website: “He’s quick, he’s 
very direct, he likes to play on the shoulder and there’s no doubts he’s got 
the technical attributes to do quite well. We just need to make sure he’s ready 
and not shove him into the step up that he’s going to have to go and handle.

“Of course, he’s not trained with the players yet and he’s not integrated into 
the team at all but he’s certainly an option for us now on Friday night.”
