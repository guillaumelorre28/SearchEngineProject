Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 22nd La Liga goal of the season to set Real Madrid
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> on their way to a laboured 
2-0 win at home to Granada on Saturday that lifted them above Barcelona and 
Atlético Madrid to the top of the standings.

Barça and Atlético, who play on Sunday, have drawn on their past two outings, 
including a 0-0 stalemate between the pair at Atlético's Estadio Vicente 
Calderón this month, allowing Real to close the gap in the three-team title 
race.

Saturday's victory at the Bernabéu was Real's fifth in a row in La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> since a 2-2 draw at 
Osasuna in December and the France forward Karim Benzema was also on target as 
Carlo Ancelotti's side moved on to 53 points from 21 matches.

Barça and Atlético have 51 points ahead of their games on Sunday at home to 
Málaga and away at Rayo Vallecano, respectively.

Ronaldo showed off the Fifa Ballon d'Or award for the world's best player he 
won this month before kick-off and the Portugal forward came close to scoring 
moments before the break after a frustrating first half for the home side.

Luka Modric floated a cross over from the right and Ronaldo connected with a 
spectacular overhead kick that forced a superb reaction save from Roberto.

Real had struggled to dominate their lowly but well-organised opponents but 
Ronaldo, whose later free-kick was deflected on to the crossbar, finally beat 
the Granada goalkeeper 11 minutes into the second period.

He picked up a pass from Modric just inside the area and managed to squeeze a 
shot into the bottom corner despite the attentions of several defenders.

Marcelo skipped through and pulled the ball back for Benzema to make it 2-0 in 
the 74th minute.

Gareth Bale, Real's record signing, took a painful-looking kick to the groin 
in the eighth minute and was replaced by the forward Jesé at half-time.
