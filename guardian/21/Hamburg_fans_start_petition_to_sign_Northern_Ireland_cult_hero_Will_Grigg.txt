Grigg failed to make it off Northern Ireland’s bench in France, but became one 
of the names of the tournament

 after the 90s song Freed From Desire was adapted in his honour.Will Grigg’s On 
Fire <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOpGCGtCVsE> reached No6 in the official 
iTunes chart.

The 24-year-old, who finished last season as top scorer in League One as Wigan 
Athletic secured promotion, has been linked with Celtic, Hull and Nottingham 
Forest, but Hamburg fans want their club to join the race.

The petition <https://www.openpetition.de/petition/online/will-grigg-zum-hsv>, 
which has attracted more than 5,000 signatures, says: “Grigg has a market value 
of €1.5m (£1.2m). The striker enjoys an international reputation and would 
probably [pay for himself] several times over through merchandising.”

It claims the deal would “finally bring proper atmosphere to the stadium” and 
would provide a cult hero for “the club, and the city … the HSV fans need a 
player like Grigg.”

After arriving home, Grigg admitted he was “massively disappointed” that his 
only impact on the tournament had been musical.

“I try to stay away from the song,” he said. “I certainly haven’t been singing 
it myself because I find it all a bit awkward. I’m a footballer and the whole 
point of being here was to play football. But to hear the support I’ve been 
getting from the fans has been fantastic.”
