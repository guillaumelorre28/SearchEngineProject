“It feels great to be an Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>
 player,” the 19-year-old. “As soon as I heard about Everton’s interest I knew 
this would be the right place for me.

“Everton has a big history and I was also attracted by the manager. When you 
look at what he did at Southampton, and what he does with young players in 
terms of developing them, that was a big attraction.

“It was great playing in the Championship last season and for the last six 
months in League One but I feel like I’m ready to make the step up to the 
Premier League.”

Ronald Koeman, the Everton manager, said: “Ademola is a big talent and, at 19 
years old, he has a big future in the game. I’m really happy that we’ve been 
able to bring him here to the club.

“This is part of the vision we have for the club and it’s important to give to 
young players the opportunity so that the team continues to evolve and improve. 
We believe in the player and in the development of the player which, of course, 
will take time but he will have a big part to play in the future of the club.”
