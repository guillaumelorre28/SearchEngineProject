On Wednesday, Muir set a British indoor 5,000m best, running 14min 49.12sec – 
breaking Liz McColgan’s record, set in 1992, by 14 seconds. She showed no ill 
effects from that run on Saturday as she stormed clear on the final leg to win 
by 60 metres.

Muir confirmed that she will head to South Africa on Tuesday to continue her 
preparations for the European Indoor Championships in Belgrade in March, where 
she plans to double up. “The timetable works in that I can do the 1500m and 
3,000m,” she said. “There are two heats on the Friday, the 1500m final on the 
Saturday and 3,000m final on the Sunday. The legs will be working hard that 
weekend.”

Muir, who also expects to double up in the 1500m and 5,000m at the World 
Championships in London in August, said: “In the last couple of years, I’ve 
been there or thereabouts but a medal seemed to slip out of my reach - but this 
year is where I can make that stance,” she said. “The European Indoors will be 
the first chance I get and I think I can be competitive at both distances and 
be on the podium for the first time.”
