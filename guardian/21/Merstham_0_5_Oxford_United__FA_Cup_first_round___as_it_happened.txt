Here’s Michael Appleton (already!):

“The lads did a reasonable job, very professional... I think the lads we 
played today, had the quality to see us through”

He seems a hard man to please, does Appleton. Here’s Merstham manager Hayden 
Bird:

“The game changer was the goal before half-time. Some of the goals were a 
little cheap, but there were positives. These lads have nothing to be ashamed 
of... I said from the outset, the final was beating Ebbsfleet and this was the 
prize.”

91 mins: There will be two added minutes. Merstham really didn’t deserve to 
get a hiding, but Oxford have been clinical, particularly in the second half.

GOAL! Merstham 0-5 Oxford (Hemmings)

Marvin Johnson turns in the area and fires low across goal. Wilson gets down 
to parry the ball, but only into the path of Hemmings, who gets his second of 
the match.

85 mins: All about Merstham trying to find a consolation goal now – and 
Foulkes goes close, latching on to Bennett’s diagonal pass and shooting low 
across goal – but Eastwood saves well with his feet.

82 mins:  GOOOAAA  Bennett puts the ball in the net – but is flagged for 
offside! Hector pops up on the right, and his shot is pushed into Bennett’s 
path by Eastwood – but he’s a good yard offside. Still, have a heart, lino.

80 mins: Bird is still bellowing at his charges, but they’re a tired bunch 
now. Sercombe charges past Douglas and fires a shot towards the near post – but 
Wilson parries away. The goalkeeper has played very well, but still conceded 
four.

68 mins: A rare lull, as Merstham try to regroup and Oxford step off the gas. 
Goalscorer Roberts – incidentally, on loan from West Brom –goes off, replaced 
by Joe Rothwell.

65 mins: Vidal’s game is over, as he is replaced by the superbly named Tutu

GOAL! Merstham 0-3 Oxford (Hemmings)

Ruffels splits the Merstham defence with a slide-rule pass, and Hemmings races 
clear, before slotting the ball past Wilson to end the game as a contest.

60 mins: The attacking change has helped Merstham have an impact, with 
Kavanagh the latest home player to fire on goal – but his fierce effort from 
distance is blocked. At the other end, Ledson is given too much time 25 yards 
out, and his shot is smartly turned behind by Wilson.

59 mins: Eastwood wangs a clearance high into the air, and into the path of 
Vidal, who finds Hector with an exceptional first-touch pass. Hector, another 
tricky wide player, drives a low shot which Eastwood gets down well to hold.

54 mins: MacDonald’s corner bobbles around the Merstham box, but dribbles 
behind for a goal kick. I wouldn’t fancy living in earshot of Moatside – the PA 
system is both overbearingly loud and completely indecipherable.

53 mins: Hall dusts himself off and heads for the bench, along with Kershaney

52 mins: Okoye, an imposing presence in the Merstham defence, wins the ball 
off Taylor with a firm, but well-timed, challenge. Reece Hall is less 
disciplined, lunging in on MacDonald and picking up a booking.

50 mins: Bennett almost times his run between the centre-backs from a long

47 mins: Johnson sprints down the left but can’t catch a long ball forward. 
Here’s Phil Withall:

“Merstham both lucky and unlucky so far, but the most interesting thing has 
been the people in the crowd that a so obviously not regular football 
attendees. Clapping without confidence, looking sheepishly at the people next 
to them. That is the true magic of the cup.”

Plenty of non-league managers will tell you their team like to play good 
football – but Bird has delivered, with Merstham’s best moments coming from 
tidy attacking interplay. That said, they could do with a more imposing figure 
in the area – perhaps Omar Folkes, a headline writer’s dream on 5 November, can 
make the difference.

Half time: Merstham 0-2 Oxford United

An entertaining first half, with chances for both sides, but an Alex MacDonald 
free kick and a header from Josh Ruffels have put the League One team in 
command.

45 mins: Merstham have had half-chances, and another almost falls to Hall – 
but as he closes in on Eastwood, the ball is scrambled away.

GOAL! Merstham 0-2 Oxford (Ruffels)

Oxford click through the gears, Sercombe and Taylor moving the ball forward, 
and with the home defence ball-watching, Ruffels is unmarked to head Johnson’s 
cross past Wilson, and give the visitors a comfortable cushion.

40 mins: The corner is heaved in to the far post, where Dunkley, racing up 
from the back, gets a jump on the defender and heads just over the bar.

39 mins: It looked set to be a long afternoon for Merstham early on, but 
they’ve gone toe-to-toe with Oxford in the last 15 minutes. For the visitors, 
Taylor holds the ball up, but sees his long-range effort deflected behind off 
Okoye.

That’s all from me. Join Rob Smyth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/05/west-ham-v-stoke-city-fa-cup-first-round-and-more-clockwatch-live>
 to see if anyone can spring a Cupset in the 3pm games. It has to happen 
somewhere, right? Thanks for joining me.Bye!
 
Here’s Michael Appleton (already!):

“The lads did a reasonable job, very professional... I think the lads we 
played today, had the quality to see us through”

He seems a hard man to please, does Appleton. Here’s Merstham manager Hayden 
Bird:

“The game changer was the goal before half-time. Some of the goals were a 
little cheap, but there were positives. These lads have nothing to be ashamed 
of... I said from the outset, the final was beating Ebbsfleet and this was the 
prize.”
 
No upset here, as Oxford stroll into the second round with goals from Alex 
MacDonald, Tyler Roberts, Josh Ruffels and a double for Kane Hemmings.
 
91 mins: There will be two added minutes. Merstham really didn’t deserve to 
get a hiding, but Oxford have been clinical, particularly in the second half.
 
Marvin Johnson turns in the area and fires low across goal. Wilson gets down 
to parry the ball, but only into the path of Hemmings, who gets his second of 
the match.

87 mins: Addai commits a weary foul, allowing MacDonald the chance to swing 
the ball in – but his free kick is cleared away.
 
85 mins: All about Merstham trying to find a consolation goal now – and 
Foulkes goes close, latching on to Bennett’s diagonal pass and shooting low 
across goal – but Eastwood saves well with his feet.
 
82 mins:  GOOOAAA  Bennett puts the ball in the net – but is flagged for 
offside! Hector pops up on the right, and his shot is pushed into Bennett’s 
path by Eastwood – but he’s a good yard offside. Still, have a heart, lino.
 
80 mins: Bird is still bellowing at his charges, but they’re a tired bunch 
now. Sercombe charges past Douglas and fires a shot towards the near post – but 
Wilson parries away. The goalkeeper has played very well, but still conceded 
four.
 
78 mins: Ledson shoots from distance, and Wilson lets it escape his grasp – 
but the keeper gets up quickly to gather the ball ahead of Hemmings.
 
77 mins: Bennett’s corner drops towards the near post, with Eastwood coming to 
claim it, and failing – but Brooks blows up for a push in the penalty area.
 
76 mins: Bennett wriggles free of his marker and curls a shot on goal from 20 
yards out, but it’s straight at Eastwood. Merstham win the ball back, and 
Hector’s cross from the left earns a corner.
 
75 mins: Taylor shifts wide and picks out Hemmings in the middle – but his 
cross is just too high, and Hemmings heads over.
 
74 mins: There are plenty of positives for Oxford, with several fringe players 
staking a claim today. Last season, they beat teams from all of England’s top 
five tiers – they will add a seventh-tier scalp today.
 
72 mins: Folkes hasn’t been able to influence the game, and is unable to bring 
a long ball under control.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> action with Rob Smyth, as Chesham

68 mins: A rare lull, as Merstham try to regroup and Oxford step off the gas. 
Goalscorer Roberts – incidentally, on loan from West Brom –goes off, replaced 
by Joe Rothwell.
 
65 mins: Vidal’s game is over, as he is replaced by the superbly named Tutu 
Henriques. Surely a case of damage limitation, after Oxford picked the hosts 
apart twice in quick succession.
 
63 mins: Two goals in a minute, as MacDonald’s cute through ball finds Tyler 
Roberts, whose angled shot is fired through Wilson’s legs, and into the net.
 
Oxford fans aside, nobody wants to see this.
 
Ruffels splits the Merstham defence with a slide-rule pass, and Hemmings races 
clear, before slotting the ball past Wilson to end the game as a contest.

side’s third goal of the game. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA  
60 mins: The attacking change has helped Merstham have an impact, with 
Kavanagh the latest home player to fire on goal – but his fierce effort from 
distance is blocked. At the other end, Ledson is given too much time 25 yards 
out, and his shot is smartly turned behind by Wilson.
 
59 mins: Eastwood wangs a clearance high into the air, and into the path of 
Vidal, who finds Hector with an exceptional first-touch pass. Hector, another 
tricky wide player, drives a low shot which Eastwood gets down well to hold.
 
58 mins: Bennett swings a cross to the near post, but Dunkley is first to it, 
and heads clear.
 
57 mins: Bennett finds Addai, who draws a foul from Johnson. A chance for 
Bennett to forget all that tiki-taka stuff, and haul one into the mixer...
 
56 mins: Taylor tries to outmuscle Okoye, but the centre-back stays strong. 
Their relentless personal battle has been one of the highlights today.
 
54 mins: MacDonald’s corner bobbles around the Merstham box, but dribbles 
behind for a goal kick. I wouldn’t fancy living in earshot of Moatside – the PA 
system is both overbearingly loud and completely indecipherable.
 
53 mins: Hall dusts himself off and heads for the bench, along with Kershaney 
Samuels, as Hector and No9 Folkes come on – that’s a bold double change for the 
hosts.

scaffolding. Photograph: Adam Holt/Reuters  
52 mins: Okoye, an imposing presence in the Merstham defence, wins the ball 
off Taylor with a firm, but well-timed, challenge. Reece Hall is less 
disciplined, lunging in on MacDonald and picking up a booking.
 
50 mins: Bennett almost times his run between the centre-backs from a long 
diagonal ball, but is a yard offside. Hayden Bird is going to make two changes, 
Dan Hector and Omar Folkes coming on.
 
49 mins: Oxford push forward, but two scuffed shots in quick succession end 
their attack, and draw ironic cheers from the home fans. Merstham are about to 
make their first change...
 
47 mins: Johnson sprints down the left but can’t catch a long ball forward. 
Here’s Phil Withall:

“Merstham both lucky and unlucky so far, but the most interesting thing has 
been the people in the crowd that a so obviously not regular football 
attendees. Clapping without confidence, looking sheepishly at the people next 
to them. That is the true magic of the cup.”
 
We’re back under way.
 
Half-time viewing

There are plenty more Cup ties kicking off at 3pm – including Midland League 
club Westfields

’ home game against Curzon Ashton. The Hereford club are among the 
lowest-ranked sides ever to play in the first round proper – here’s how they 
did it:

50th year

Plenty of non-league managers will tell you their team like to play good 
football – but Bird has delivered, with Merstham’s best moments coming from 
tidy attacking interplay. That said, they could do with a more imposing figure 
in the area – perhaps Omar Folkes, a headline writer’s dream on 5 November, can 
make the difference.
 
An entertaining first half, with chances for both sides, but an Alex MacDonald 
free kick and a header from Josh Ruffels have put the League One team in 
command.
 
45 mins: Merstham have had half-chances, and another almost falls to Hall – 
but as he closes in on Eastwood, the ball is scrambled away.
 
Oxford click through the gears, Sercombe and Taylor moving the ball forward, 
and with the home defence ball-watching, Ruffels is unmarked to head Johnson’s 
cross past Wilson, and give the visitors a comfortable cushion.
 
42 mins: Merstham continue to ping the ball around the midfield, but Antoine 
Douglas gives the ball away, trying to be a little too clever. Oxford break...
 
40 mins: The corner is heaved in to the far post, where Dunkley, racing up 
from the back, gets a jump on the defender and heads just over the bar.
 
39 mins: It looked set to be a long afternoon for Merstham early on, but 
they’ve gone toe-to-toe with Oxford in the last 15 minutes. For the visitors, 
Taylor holds the ball up, but sees his long-range effort deflected behind off 
Okoye.
