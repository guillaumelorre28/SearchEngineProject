There were no damehoods or knighthoods for former or serving voluntary sector 
bosses in the list, published on 31 December 2016, but also made CBEs are 
Helena Herklots, chief executive of Carers UK; Dr Christopher Simpkins, 
director general at the Royal British Legion; Dr Margo Whiteford, chair of 
Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Scotland; and Richard Winter, for voluntary services 
for Save the Children and Merlin. William Lloyd, president of Age Concern, 
receives an MBE for services to the elderly, as does Samuel Duerden, deputy 
director of the International Rescue Committee.

More than 80 charity professionals are being recognised out of a total of 
1,197 people receiving an award. After a stellar Olympic year, the headlines 
will be dominated by sporting stars but 74% of recipients are recognised for 
making an outstanding contribution to their local communities in either a paid 
or voluntary capacity.

Among those, one of the oldest, 94-year-old Janet Gillespie, receives a 
British Empire Medal (BEM) for her charitable service, after having spent more 
than 60 years volunteering for Poppy Scotland. Gillespie first began selling 
poppies in 1952 and retired last year.

The list also includes a BEM for Vivien Cooper, who has volunteered for 50 
years at the Didcot Railway Centre and Great Western Society, and an MBE for 
Susan Green, who has volunteered with the Samaritans for more than 30 years, 
where she supported inmates at Feltham young offender institution and Wormwood 
Scrubs prison.
