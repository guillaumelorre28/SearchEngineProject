Having failed to register a shot on target against Aston Villa in the league 
last week, West Brom fans can take solace from the fact they cannot show any 
less attacking intent against League One opposition. They should still not 
expect free-flowing excitement to break out any time soon, though. 
Peterborough’s sale of Conor Washington to QPR has left them short on goals 
too. Graham Westley’s side are pushing for a play-off place in League One but 
have only one point from their last three games and have not won since 
defeating Preston 2-0 in the last round on 9 January.Alan Smith
