Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have moved closer 
to signing Sylvain Marveaux on a free transfer after the French midfielder 
underwent a medical on Merseyside.

The 25-year-old is out of contract following five seasons in the Rennes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rennes> first team and has been linked 
with a move to Anfield since January.

Talks took place between Liverpool officials and Marveaux's representatives 
when Roy Hodgson was manager, although the club's director of football Damien 
Comolli has overseen the transfer and interest has not waned since Kenny 
Dalglish took charge.

Marveaux made only 10 appearances for Rennes last season due to a serious 
groin injury but, providing he passes the medical, the left-sided midfielder is 
likely to become Liverpool's second capture of the summer following the arrival 
of Jordan Henderson from Sunderland.
