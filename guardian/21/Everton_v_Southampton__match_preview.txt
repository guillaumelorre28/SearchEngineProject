Ronald Koeman endured a miserable return to St Mary’s Stadium in November when 
his current side were outmanoeuvred and beaten by his old one but fatigue may 
work in Everton’s favour this time around. Ludicrously,Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are playing for the third 
time in six days and Claude Puel has admitted it will be a struggle to juggle 
his resources at Goodison Park. Tom Davies, sharp as a substitute at Hull City 
on Friday, may get a chance to start in Everton’s midfield, with Koeman keen to 
protect Gareth Barry from two games in quick succession.Andy Hunter
