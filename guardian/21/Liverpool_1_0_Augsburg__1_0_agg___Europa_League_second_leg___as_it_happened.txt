Full-time! Liverpool 1-0 Augsburg (1-0 agg)

And that’s your lot. Augsburg really did make life uncomfortable for Liverpool 
who will face an irate manager back in the changing room. NonethelessLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are through and there were 
some impressive moments, not the least when Sturridge, Firmino and Coutinho 
linked up. There was a certain ruthlessness lacking in the final third though 
and Klopp will demand better on Sunday.

Augsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> didn’t create that 
much but had Caiuby’s pullback reached Moravek then surely Liverpool were in 
considerable trouble. As it was, it didn’t and Liverpool are in the draw for 
the last 16.
 Despite their defeat it looks like the Augsburg fans at Anfield enjoyed 
themselves. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters

90+5 mins: Caiuby just can’t bring the bouncing ball under control but 
Bobadilla finds space 25 yards out and winds up … and it’s high, wide and 
handsome. Mignolet punts clear andAugsburg

90+4 mins: Firmino forces his way into the box but can’t really decide if he 
wants to beat Stafylidis or take the shot on. Eventually he shots but it’s 
blocked.

89 mins: Stafylidis takes left-footed, and it’s inches wide. A lovely 
free-kick from the right-hand side at the near side of the goal. That was 
almost curtains forLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>.
 Konstantinos Stafylidis curls his free-kick over the wall but just wide of 
the upright. That was close and there’s a collective sigh of relief from the

87 mins: Caiuby gets in behind down the left and rolls it across. It’s just

84 mins: Here’s Milner to the bye-line and his umpteenth pullback which is 
again unsuccessful. It falls to Can who doesn’t fancy hitting one with his left 
and the chances goes.

Oooh, he arrives late and pokes at a volley which is wide but a warning for
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>.

78 mins: Origi has a dash down the left but Klavan covers. We’ll have another 
corner, Hitz plucks it and releases Bobadilla who spreads it to Altintop. Koo 
puts a dangerous ball in but Mignolet produces a flying punch to clear. Solid 
from the Belgian but the Anfield crowd is beginning to get edgy.

77 mins: Koo has a rare shot for Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> but he can’t get the ball out 
of his feet and it’s high and wide. Firmino tries a couple of fancy flicks and 
they don’t come off but Janker hesitates with the clearance, Henderson nips in 
and having got there, he really should have scored. Instead he hurried his shot 
straight at Hitz.

76 mins: Bobadilla denied his first involvement but the linesman’s flag. 
Mignolet punts upfield and Milner crosses to no one again. Would Benteke not 
have been the better option from the bench?

75 mins: That’s a much better ball from Milner but no one on the end of it. He 
gets another chance, goes low and Firmino is tackled.

73 mins: Origi with his first involvement – he tries to pull it back and a 
deflection almost catches Hitz out. The ball finds its way to Coutinho but he 
can’t find the net. Corner. A bad one. From Milner.

69 mins: Werner with the corner, it’s a poor one and Moreno clears. Milner is 
back on the pitch butAugsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> 
have a free-kick. A fairly mindless foul from Sakho on Caiuby.

66 mins: Caiuby isn’t getting much change out of Lucas but that looked like a 
foul on the Augsburg man.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are making a sub, bringing off 
a somewhat disgruntled Sturridge for Origi.
 Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge doesn’t look too pleased with his substitution.

64 mins: That’s a pretty average attempted chip pass from Henderson. Leave 
those passes to the others Jordan. A bit of complacency creeping into 
Liverpool’s attacking play though. Klopp is furious on the sideline.

63 mins: Henderson finds himself on the edge of the box but the ball won’t sit 
kindly and Stafylidis blocks. Coutinho then has a bobbling shot but there’s not 
enough whip and it’s wide.

Quick aside: 

Hi Gerard,

I think Michael is talking about your little list of the matches and scores 
there on the side of the page. Every team is listed by their name which is a 
location, except Tottenham, who are just listed as Spurs. But writing just one 
sentence helped me figure it out. Tottenham has, like, waaay too many letters.


Ah yes, I do not know the answer but perhaps Turner Allen Matthew is right

55 mins: Caiuby is down but he wins the free-kick from Sakho. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> haven’t defended these 
situations with any great authority … but Vaerhaegh’s cross is well dealt with 
by Sakho.

49 mins: Oooh Sturridge should score that. He was offside but Coutinho picks 
him out, Sturridge rolls the ball inside in his typically languid manner but 
his placed shot is the wrong side of the post.

Cheerio! And thanks, as ever, for reading and your emails and tweets.
 
And that’s your lot. Augsburg really did make life uncomfortable for Liverpool 
who will face an irate manager back in the changing room. NonethelessLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are through and there were 
some impressive moments, not the least when Sturridge, Firmino and Coutinho 
linked up. There was a certain ruthlessness lacking in the final third though 
and Klopp will demand better on Sunday.

Augsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> didn’t create that 
much but had Caiuby’s pullback reached Moravek then surely Liverpool were in 
considerable trouble. As it was, it didn’t and Liverpool are in the draw for 
the last 16.
 Despite their defeat it looks like the Augsburg fans at Anfield enjoyed 
themselves. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters  
90+5 mins: Caiuby just can’t bring the bouncing ball under control but 
Bobadilla finds space 25 yards out and winds up … and it’s high, wide and 
handsome. Mignolet punts clear andAugsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> follow suit.
 
90+4 mins: Firmino forces his way into the box but can’t really decide if he 
wants to beat Stafylidis or take the shot on. Eventually he shots but it’s 
blocked.
 
90+3 mins: Mignolet plucks another looping cross from Esswein. He’s looked 
really quite solid tonight but there’s still time …
 
90+2 mins: Liverpool have it back and Firmino is by the corner flag with 
little intentions of going anywhere. Henderson wins a throw andLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> will endeavour to see this one 
out.
 
90+1 mins: We’ll have five minutes of extra time. To start with Hitz launches 
a free-kick which Caiuby flicks on butLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> scramble clear.
 
89 mins: Stafylidis takes left-footed, and it’s inches wide. A lovely 
free-kick from the right-hand side at the near side of the goal. That was 
almost curtains forLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>.
 Konstantinos Stafylidis curls his free-kick over the wall but just wide of 
the upright. That was close and there’s a collective sigh of relief from the 
terraces. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters  
88 mins: Augsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> are going 
long at every opportunity now. And Caiuby has won a free-kick about 22 yards 
out. This could be dangerous …
 
87 mins: Caiuby gets in behind down the left and rolls it across. It’s just 
behind Esswein who takes a touch but if he hadn’t Moravek would surely have 
scored.
 
86 mins: Augsburg have a throw from the left. Lucas clears but Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> still have it and go long to 
Caiuby, to no avail.
 
85 mins: Origi with a shot on target but it’s tame. Firmino looks to be in 
behind but he’s offside.
 
84 mins: Here’s Milner to the bye-line and his umpteenth pullback which is 
again unsuccessful. It falls to Can who doesn’t fancy hitting one with his left 
and the chances goes.
 
83 mins: Milner has it on the right but slips and handles the ball. Hitz booms 
long butLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> win back 
possession but Henderson’s legs get tangled in amusing fashion.
 
81 mins: Augsburg meanwhile have brought on Moravek to add a bit more guile. 
Oooh, he arrives late and pokes at a volley which is wide but a warning for
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>.
 
79 mins: Coutinho is going off, probably with Sunday in mind.
 
78 mins: Origi has a dash down the left but Klavan covers. We’ll have another 
corner, Hitz plucks it and releases Bobadilla who spreads it to Altintop. Koo 
puts a dangerous ball in but Mignolet produces a flying punch to clear. Solid 
from the Belgian but the Anfield crowd is beginning to get edgy.
 
77 mins: Koo has a rare shot for Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> but he can’t get the ball out 
of his feet and it’s high and wide. Firmino tries a couple of fancy flicks and 
they don’t come off but Janker hesitates with the clearance, Henderson nips in 
and having got there, he really should have scored. Instead he hurried his shot 
straight at Hitz.

Andrew Yates/Reuters  
76 mins: Bobadilla denied his first involvement but the linesman’s flag. 
Mignolet punts upfield and Milner crosses to no one again. Would Benteke not 
have been the better option from the bench?
 
75 mins: That’s a much better ball from Milner but no one on the end of it. He 
gets another chance, goes low and Firmino is tackled.
 
74 mins: That’s another low pullback from Moreno and again Augsburg clear. 
Can’t help but feelLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
should be standing more of these up.
 
73 mins: Origi with his first involvement – he tries to pull it back and a 
deflection almost catches Hitz out. The ball finds its way to Coutinho but he 
can’t find the net. Corner. A bad one. From Milner.
 
72 mins: That should serve as a reminder to Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> who could really do with 
another goal. Augsburg are bringing on Bobadilla, who scored six goals in the 
group stage.
 
71 mins: Werner had the chance to redeem himself there but he’s foiled by 
Mignolet! Mignolet sprung off his line when Werner was bearing down.
 Liverpool’s Simon Mignolet denies Augsburg’s Tobias Werner. Photograph: Carl 
Recine/Reuters  
70 mins: Werner to take it left-footed … it’s really poor again and Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> clear before winning the 
free-kick. That was a waste.
 
69 mins: Werner with the corner, it’s a poor one and Moreno clears. Milner is 
back on the pitch butAugsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> 
have a free-kick. A fairly mindless foul from Sakho on Caiuby.
 
68 mins: Play continues and Caiuby finds Esswein in the right channel. Lucas 
covers well butAugsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> will 
have a corner. Milner is now receiving treatment.
 
67 mins: Risky backpass from Stafylidis but Hitz deals with it well enough. 
Milner meanwhile, is down injured.
 
66 mins: Caiuby isn’t getting much change out of Lucas but that looked like a 
foul on the Augsburg man.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are making a sub, bringing off 
a somewhat disgruntled Sturridge for Origi.
 Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge doesn’t look too pleased with his substitution. 
Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters  
65 mins: Need I remind you that a goal for Augsburg puts Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> out. Hence Klopp’s fury I 
would wager.
 
64 mins: That’s a pretty average attempted chip pass from Henderson. Leave 
those passes to the others Jordan. A bit of complacency creeping into 
Liverpool’s attacking play though. Klopp is furious on the sideline.
 
63 mins: Henderson finds himself on the edge of the box but the ball won’t sit 
kindly and Stafylidis blocks. Coutinho then has a bobbling shot but there’s not 
enough whip and it’s wide.
 
62 mins: Sturridge has been cropping up on the left in the second half and he 
does so again but his pass for Coutinho is ever so slightly overhit.
 
61 mins: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have a 
free-kick on the left after a foul by Kohr but they’ve taken it short and the 
ball finds its way back to Mignolet.
 
59 mins: Augbsurg are certainly holding on to the ball better in the second 
half but Mignolet plucks a looping cross with something looking like 
conviction. Coutinho and Firmino try a one-two but Koo intercepts.

Christoph Janker. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters  
58 mins: Hitz has looked impressive enough tonight but that’s a poor kick. No 
matter though, Augbsurg have it back and Stafylidis crosses, only for Lucas to 
thump clear.
 
57 mins: Back to the action at Anfield and Augsburg knock it around for a bit 
before Sakho, despite a slip, clears from Caiuby.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> clear their lines from the 
resulting throw-in.
 
Quick aside: 

Hi Gerard,

I think Michael is talking about your little list of the matches and scores 
there on the side of the page. Every team is listed by their name which is a 
location, except Tottenham, who are just listed as Spurs. But writing just one 
sentence helped me figure it out. Tottenham has, like, waaay too many letters.


Ah yes, I do not know the answer but perhaps Turner Allen Matthew is right
 
55 mins: Caiuby is down but he wins the free-kick from Sakho. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> haven’t defended these 
situations with any great authority … but Vaerhaegh’s cross is well dealt with 
by Sakho.
 
54 mins: That’s excellent from Liverpool, freeing Milner in the box. Augsburg 
scramble clear before Janker blocks Coutinho’s shot.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are dominant again but they’d 
love that second goal.
 
53 mins: It’s short, and it’s intercepted. Ludicrous.
 
52 mins: Augsburg look like they’re going to give this a go but Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> keep crowding out Altintop. 
Sturridge tries to bend one with his left foot, no dice but it’s a corner.
 
51 mins: Coutinho and Sturridge link up nicely but they’re crowded out. Clyne 
wins it back though but Stafylidis intercepts.
 
50 mins: A bit of a scare for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> as Verhaegh puts in a 
free-kick and finds Caiuby who sparks a bit of panic but the assistant’s flag 
goes up.
 
49 mins: Oooh Sturridge should score that. He was offside but Coutinho picks 
him out, Sturridge rolls the ball inside in his typically languid manner but 
his placed shot is the wrong side of the post.
 
48 mins: Henderson’s ball forward is headed away but it falls to Coutinho who 
tries one of those dipping volleys scored by someone in Spain recently. It 
doesn’t work
 
47 mins: Kohr is down injured. That’s not a good start to the second half for 
Augbsurg. But I think he’s OK. Attempted intricacies from Augsburg don’t really 
work andLiverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have it back.
