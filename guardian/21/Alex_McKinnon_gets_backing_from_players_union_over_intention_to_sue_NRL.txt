The former Newcastle forward is readying legal action against the game’s 
governing body over the 2014 tackle which left him wheelchair bound.

The NRL said no claim had been lodged but they had been in contact with 
McKinnon’s lawyer.


The lawsuit is also reported to include Melbourne’s Jordan McLean, who was 
handed a seven-game ban for his involvement in a three-man spear tackle that 
left McKinnon with a spinal injury.


The Rugby League Players Association said McKinnon’s injury had been 
life-altering and people should consider his position before judging him.


“Alex has the right to pursue any and all legal options available to him in 
relation to his injury and it is appropriate that he has engaged his own legal 
representatives to assist him,” the RLPA said.


“We also recognise there has been an emotional toll on those who played and 
officiated in the game between theNewcastle Knights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/newcastle-knights> and Melbourne Storm and 
particularly on those involved in the incident that resulted in the injury to 
Alex.


“From the RLPA’s perspective, we will seek to ensure that the rights of all 
parties are protected throughout any legal process that might eventuate.”


The 24-year-old McKinnon’s rugby league career was cut short by the tackle.


He expressed a desire to sue last year despite receiving the maximum $500,000 
compensation payout from the NRL and around $1.2m for his medical costs through 
fundraising efforts.


But McKinnon, whose legal team has reportedly met with NRL boss Todd 
Greenberg, has said that will be nowhere near enough in the long-term.


“I had no idea how much this injury was going to cost,” he told the Nine 
Network in July 2015. “I didn’t know until two weeks ago it cost $100,000 for 
me to get out of bed in the morning.

“I just need to know how much it is going to cost me, how much money I have 
and where I [am] going to get that money from.”


The Storm have declined to comment.

If he does go ahead with the lawsuit, McKinnon could expect a compensation 
payout of more than $10m,litigation lawyers have suggested.

Sam Macedone, a Sydney-based lawyer, told Channel Nine last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/14/alex-mckinnon-strong-case-to-sue-nrl-storm>
 that McKinnon had a “very good case”.


“Without any doubt in the world,” Macedone said. “When you take on a sport 
like this, which is a sport that involves violence in a way, you take the risk 
that you’re going to get hurt. However, if you get hurt by someone playing 
outside of the rules then, yes, you do have a case.”

But Macedone said the real question would be over whether the sport’s 
governing body was liable on the grounds it should have made more of an effort 
to crack down on lifting tackles. “There’s some itchy feelings around 
responsibility and whether the NRL could’ve done anything to prevent it,” he 
said.

Macedone cited strong precedent including the former Wests Tigers player 
Jarrod McCracken’s 2006 case, when he was awarded $97,000 after he argued his 
career had been ended by a neck injury suffered in a tackle by Storm duo 
Stephen Kearney and Marcus Bai.

“You’d think that they [the NRL] would have had some sort of cover ... given 
what’s happened in the past, surely they would’ve planned for something like 
this. I think in some respects they’ve done that by offering him a job for life 
and looking after him as best they can.

“The real question here – or the legal question – is whether they would be 
liable in negligence because they did not do enough to prevent these sorts of 
tackles from continuing in the game. Let’s face it, they still continue.”
