Cheltenham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cheltenham> Town have parted 
company with their manager Paul Buckle by mutual consent after just 13 games 
and 79 days in charge.

The former Luton manager, who was appointed as Mark Yates’s successor in 
November

, won only once during his time in charge and leaves the club just a point 
above the League Two relegation zone. Russell Milton will take charge as 
caretaker for Saturday’s game against Bury.

A club statement read: “The board of Cheltenham Town FC have reached an 
agreement with manager Paul Buckle for him to leave the club.

“Paul has departed from Cheltenham Town by mutual consent and with immediate 
effect. Neither party will be making any further statement on this issue. Head 
of academy coaching Russell Milton will take caretaker charge of the first team 
for Saturday’s home match against Bury.”

Buckle’s future was thrown into doubt earlier this week when the club 
chairman, Paul Baker, was forced to deny his manager had left the club, though 
he did admit Buckle’s position was “under scrutiny”. The club have also 
confirmed that assistant Rob Edwards has left by mutual consent.
