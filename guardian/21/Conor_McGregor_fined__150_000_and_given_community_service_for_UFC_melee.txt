The fine represents 5% of the record $3m purse McGregor received for winning 
the fight by majority decision. McGregor has six months to complete the 
community service imposed upon him by the commission. He has the right to 
appeal.

McGregor and Diaz were involved in the melee at a testy press conference in 
Las Vegas three days before the fight. Tensions ran high and then boiled over.

Video showed <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0kNTkzyEno> Diaz leave the 
stage at the press conference and exchange verbal taunts with McGregor, who had 
arrived 30 minutes late. As he departed from the theater, surrounded by press, 
photographers and his entourage, Diaz threw a water bottle. McGregor, the UFC 
featherweight champion, jumped up and threw a series of bottles and cans 
towards Diaz and his team, who returned the favour.

The Irish star attended the disciplinary hearing via phone on Monday and 
admitted he “acted wrong” and would “learn from that.” He said: “I was acting 
very rapidly and it just got out of hand. This fight had everything on the line 
for me. This was the highest paid fight I’d ever been in.”

According to the Nevada attorney general’s office, one MGM security officer 
sustained a minor injury from a can that was thrown by McGregor.

Diaz, who earned $2m from the fight, has yet to appear before the commission 
for his disciplinary hearing. He was originally scheduled to do so on Monday, 
but was granted a delay.
