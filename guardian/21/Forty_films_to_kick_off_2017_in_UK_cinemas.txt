Manchester by the Sea <https://www.theguardian.com/film/manchester-by-the-sea> 

Casey Affleck <https://www.theguardian.com/film/casey-affleck> gives the 
performance of his career in this deeply affecting drama byKenneth Lonergan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/kenneth-lonergan>. He plays Lee, an angry and 
messed-up guy who after his brother’s death returns to his Massachusetts 
hometown (the one in the title) to find that he has been made legal guardian to 
the dead man’s son – his nephew. The past rises up to confront him and the 
result is an extraordinarily involving movie, with strains of tragedy and 
comedy.

Jackie

The new movie from Chilean director Pablo Larraín is a fascinating prospect: a 
study of one of the most enigmatic figures in American public life:Jackie 
Kennedy <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jackie-onassis>. This is a closeup 
psychodrama, at once intimate and yet mysterious. Jackie is played byNatalie 
Portman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/natalie-portman>, in what is being 
seen as a career highlight. After the assassination, she battles to master her 
fear and control the narrative.

here they’re not. Dev Patel gives a powerful, mature performance as a former 
Indian street kid who fell asleep in a train carriage and woke up in Calcutta,

same man: control freak Howard Hughes (played by Beatty) who forbade any

genuinely funny. Austrian actor Peter Simonischek plays Winfried, an ageing man 
with a fondness for wacky humour, increasingly estranged from his grownup 
daughter Ines (Sandra Hüller). When she was a little kid, she used to love his 
clowning around; so now, in a bizarre attempt to bond, he shows up at her 
workplace to play japes and stunts in his zany character “Toni Erdmann”. Is he 
having a breakdown? Is it worse than that?
