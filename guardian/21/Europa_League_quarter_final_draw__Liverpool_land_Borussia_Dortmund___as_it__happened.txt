I suppose it’s the worst draw and the best draw for Liverpool

atmospheric, occasions. Klopp’s knowledge of the Dortmund squad will be sure to 
help too.

Who is going to be plucking the balls out of the pot? It’s Basel legend 
Alexander Frei.

The last goal Frei ever scored as a professional was this one 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRF4aKqTqBY>. Not a bad way to sign off.

Right, Pedro Pinto has introduced Giorgio Marchetti back to the tombola stage. 
He needs to work on his autocue use.Giorgio that is, not Pedro. He’s a pro. 
Giorgio is more of a paper-shuffler day to day I suspect. Not used to the 
bright lights.

Right, that’s finished. The draw should be under way shortly. 

Here’s a stat: Every time Sevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> have reached the last eight they 
have gone on to lift the trophy.

Just give them the trophy now.

BT Sport are showing a documentary about the German referee Felix Brych. It’s 
interesting. He’s wearing a mic and the cameras are following him around during 
a match. It’s reminiscent of the one featuring David Elleray.“Go away, I don’t 
want you.” <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4ruNosLNOE&t=1m4s>

we don’t getBorussia Dortmund

Right. Well, another huge couple of nights await Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> and Dortmund fans. Meanwhile, 
Sevilla and Athletic promises to be a noisy clash of northern and southern 
Spain. Here’s the story from the draw.

I suppose it’s the worst draw and the best draw for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> fans. Football’s about 
occasions as much as success and progress. And both matches will be huge, 
atmospheric, occasions. Klopp’s knowledge of the Dortmund squad will be sure to 
help too.

Next out is Villarreal v Sparta Prague
 
Braga v Shakhtar Donetsk is first out of the pot.
 
Frei reckons Dortmund and Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are the two clubs most likely 
to bother Sevilla.And now we’re ready to go …
 
Who is going to be plucking the balls out of the pot? It’s Basel legend 
Alexander Frei.

The last goal Frei ever scored as a professional was this one 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRF4aKqTqBY>. Not a bad way to sign off. 
 Goal!  
Right, Pedro Pinto has introduced Giorgio Marchetti back to the tombola stage. 
He needs to work on his autocue use.Giorgio that is, not Pedro. He’s a pro. 
Giorgio is more of a paper-shuffler day to day I suspect. Not used to the 
bright lights.
 
Is there a more beautiful football trophy than the Uefa Cup?
 Ooh! Photograph: Jean-Guy Python/AFP/Getty Images  
Right, that’s finished. The draw should be under way shortly. 

Here’s a stat: Every time Sevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> have reached the last eight they 
have gone on to lift the trophy.

Just give them the trophy now. 
 
BT Sport are showing a documentary about the German referee Felix Brych. It’s 
interesting. He’s wearing a mic and the cameras are following him around during 
a match. It’s reminiscent of the one featuring David Elleray.“Go away, I don’t 
want you.” <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4ruNosLNOE&t=1m4s>
