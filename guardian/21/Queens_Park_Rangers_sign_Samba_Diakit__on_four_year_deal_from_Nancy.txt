told the club's website: "Samba was a real find for us in January, so we're 
delighted he's joined us permanently. He's a very accomplished footballer and 
he's made to measure for the Premier League.

"He's got good pace, strength and ability on the ball and he's going to be a 
great asset for us going forward. There's still so much more to come from him.

sure he's raring to go and get back into the action again."

this contract," he said. "I loved my time here on loan and I couldn't be

for me."
