Chris Brown <https://www.theguardian.com/music/chris-brown> has been 
criticized after posting a picture of a woman who allegedly broke into his 
house on Instagram.

“I get home and find this crazy individual in my house,” begins Brown’s 
caption on the photo-sharing website, beside thestark image of a woman wrapped 
in a towel <https://instagram.com/p/2Yi084PpW4/?taken-by=chrisbrownofficial>, 
staring into the camera lens. It has more than 204,000 likes.

Brown said that the woman had broken the hinges off the doors to his house 
while he was away, presumably in Las Vegas, where he spent his 26th birthday on 
Tuesday.

In March, Brown was released from felony probation for assaulting his then 
girlfriend Rihanna

 in 2009.

It is unclear how long the woman was in Brown’s home for, though he said that 
she cooked several meals. He said she also wrote “I love you” on the walls and 
wrote her name on his cars.

“She threw out my daughter’s clothing as well as my dogs’ stuff,” Brown said. 
“Then had all these crazy voodoo things around my crib.”

The Los Angeles County sheriff’s department told KABC radio that deputies 
responded to Brown’s home at 8.31pm and arrested a suspect for felony vandalism 
and burglary.

“I love my fans but this is some on some real real crazy shit! I pray she will 
get help,” Brown said.

Though he wrote that compassionate comment, Brown has attracted criticism for 
posting a photo of a possibly mentally ill person online.

Chris Brown should have never posted that picture/story of that girl. She 
could have serious mental health issues.
