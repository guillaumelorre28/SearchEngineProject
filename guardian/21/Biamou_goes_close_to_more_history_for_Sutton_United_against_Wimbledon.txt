It did not quite capture the spirit of their finest FA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> hour in 1989 but a battling 
performance ensured the National League side Sutton will be in the hat for the 
fourth-round draw on Monday following this stalemate against their south-west 
London neighbours.

The famous victory over First Division Coventry City 28 years ago at this 
venue will take some beating, but having enjoyed the best chances until a 
slight wobble late on, those of a chocolate-and-amber persuasion will know this 
could have come close to matching it had they found a way through a stubborn 
defence.

“There was a sense of disappointment because I think everyone was hoping for 
that last-minute winner but we couldn’t have done any more,” said the Sutton 
manager, Paul Doswell.

“We worked our socks off and restricted them to very little. I think we’ve 
done the Conference proud. I’d say we looked more like the League One side 
today and I think Wimbledon will have a little sigh of relief tonight.”

Doswell has transformed his side from the depths of the Isthmian League to a 
mid-table position in the top tier outside the Football League since his 
arrival from Eastleigh in May 2008. Not only does he not receive a penny from 
the club for his troubles, but the amiable 50-year-old paid for the 
state-of-the-art 3G artificial pitch out of his own pocket and is the managing 
director of a construction business who also happens to have seven children.

His appointment a few weeks after Sutton were relegated from the Conference 
South coincided with AFC Wimbledon’s promotion to the same division, meaning 
the two local rivals have never met before in the same division.

Their encounter in July 2002 in AFC Wimbledon’s first-ever match ended in a 
4-0 victory for Sutton but the tables have now turned, even if the visitors 
have fallen away in recent weeks after a brilliant start to life in League One 
under Neal Ardley.

Sutton served notice of their threat twice early on as Matt Tubbs and Nicky 
Bailey spurned good opportunities. But the best of the chances in the first 
half fell to the French striker Maxime Biamou after he was played in by the 
impressive Roarie Deacon, only for his lofted effort to bounce off the top of 
the crossbar.

Wimbledon have won once since battling back from 3-0 down to win 4-3 in the 
previous round against non-league Curzon Ashton and looked like a side short of 
confidence on the unusual but immaculate surface. They improved after half-time 
but were grateful to James Shea when he produced a brilliant save to deny 
Biamou after more good work from Deacon.

“It’s massive, I’m not going to lie. You really have to master this pitch,” 
said Ardley. “They marshalled us well and I give them a lot of credit but we 
dug in and made sure we are in the hat.”

Wimbledon could have made sure they did not need the replay on Tuesday week 
had the referee, Keith Stroud, awarded a penalty four minutes from time when 
Barry Fuller was brought down by substitute Bradley Hudson-Odoi in the box.

The managers felt the decision could have gone either way, while the visitors’ 
captain, Paul Robinson, also went close with a header in stoppage time as 
Wimbledon pressed for a winner but could not beat Ross Worner.

“We savour days like this – the excitement will still be there on Monday for 
the draw,” said Doswell. “We’ll go there and give it a real go.”
