.

Betis and Fiorentina reached an agreement for Joaquín’s return to Spain before 
the end of the transfer window in Italy.

“This is a dream come true,” Joaquín. “To return to Betis is what I wanted. 
I’m back home and ready to fight for this club.”

Joaquín made 49 appearances for Fiorentina and started 23 Serie A games to 
help the Viola finish fourth in the standings last season. He made 218 
appearances for Betis during his first spell at the club, and won the Copa del 
Rey title in the 2004-05 campaign.

Betis returned to La Liga earlier this year just one season after being 
relegated to the Segunda División.
