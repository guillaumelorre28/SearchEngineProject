What a comeback from Real Madrid, and what a performance by Ronaldo. Zidane’s 
team were in a jam after that sorry away performance, but they were much the 
better team today, and deserved to go through: they had more possession, 
created more chances, and basically looked much the classier side.Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> defended poorly in the opening 
20 minutes and looked nervous, and their second-half display was deeply 
mediocre. Julian Draxler’s injury was unfortunate, but they were second best 
here.

Congratulations to Madrid, and that Ronaldo is a force of nature, isn’t he? 
Unstoppable.

Thanks for reading – see you.
 The final whistle goes and the celebrations begin as Ronaldo does his best

90 min: Dreadful lunge from Vieirinha on Bale, and he’s booked, but that could 
easily have been red. That was reckless. It was knee-high. He should be off.

Three minutes of stoppage time, and Modric is replaced by Varane.

89 min: Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> are going 
out with a whimper. Dante wins a free kick on the edge of his box and whacks it 
long, but Real win it back, and carry it forward … Jese feeds Bale, but Bale’s 
right-foot shot is saved by Benaglio! That could have sealed it.

he can’t make it count, and it’s a goal kick.

Just looking at the Ronaldo free kick again, the wall just came apart at the 
seams! Benaglio had no chance. If they wall stays together, Ronaldo doesn’t 
score. Oh, Wolfsburg!

81 min: Fine save from Benaglio! Benzema had it down the left, cut inside 
under a flimsy challenge from Rodriguez, but Benaglio got hands to it to tip it 
wide. Corner.

79 min: Well, Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> have 
11 minutes to get a goal, and Bas Dost is on for Joshua Guilavogui. Yellow card 
for Ronaldo for a late tackle on Arnold. It was a bad one; the caution was 
deserved.

78 min: Brilliant from Ronaldo. What a player he is! His sixth-hat trick of 
the campaign, his 460th career goal … but it went through the wall! A 
baby-lotion soft goal to give up: Ronaldo hit it well, but the wall just split. 
What a farce! Terrible defending, butReal Madrid

74 min: A loose pass in defence, and Modric is quickly on to it, bursting 
forward. Luiz Gustavo dives in, and though it looked like he got the ball, the 
ref says foul, and a yellow card is shown. Great chance from the free-kick, 
this.

65 min: Benzema skins Vieirinha on the left side, and wins the corner. Kroos 
with it, andit’s off the post from Ramos! So unlucky from the centre-back: he 
got a clear header, thumped it off the woodwork, and it rolled back right 
across the line, where Benaglio stuck a hand out instinctively and grabbed it. 
No need for goal-line technology – it was clearly not over the line – but a 
lucky escape for Wolfsburg!

62 min: Oh, Benzema missed his header! Marcelo’s corner from the right, and 
Benzema was free, about eight yards out, but couldn’t get the purchase! That 
was a chance.

61 min: Real are on top here, but the longer the game goes on the jumpier you 
sense they’ll become. One false move in defence andWolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> have the upper hand again.

Another mistake from Guilavogui and it’s another corner to the hosts.

60 min: Ooh, a moment of panic for Wolfsburg! Modric ran beyond the attacking 
line, whipped a low ball across the box, and Guilavogui, running back, got his 
clearance wrong – but Benaglio saved! Good reaction stop from the Swiss: that 
was going in.

55 min: Ronaldo goes down in the penalty area, but no penalty, and no real 
complaint from the Portuguese. But now Kroos is bumped by Henrique about 30 
yards from goal, and this is a shooting chance.

What a comeback from Real Madrid, and what a performance by Ronaldo. Zidane’s 
team were in a jam after that sorry away performance, but they were much the 
better team today, and deserved to go through: they had more possession, 
created more chances, and basically looked much the classier side.Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> defended poorly in the opening 
20 minutes and looked nervous, and their second-half display was deeply 
mediocre. Julian Draxler’s injury was unfortunate, but they were second best 
here.

Congratulations to Madrid, and that Ronaldo is a force of nature, isn’t he? 
Unstoppable.

Thanks for reading – see you.
 The final whistle goes and the celebrations begin as Ronaldo does his best

Real go through!
 
90 min +3: Caligiuri with a chance to put the ball in, but he’s tackled 
cleanly, and that’s it.
 
90 min +2: One last chance for Wolfsburg. Luiz Gustavo sends it forward, and 
Naldo wins the header, but Dost can’t snaffle the second ball.Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> break, but Jese gives a bad 
pass and presents the ball straight to Wolfsburg. Duh.
 
90 min +1: Real head to the corner, and Bale wins the throw. Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> can’t get the ball.
 
90 min: Dreadful lunge from Vieirinha on Bale, and he’s booked, but that could 
easily have been red. That was reckless. It was knee-high. He should be off.

Three minutes of stoppage time, and Modric is replaced by Varane.
 
89 min: Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> are going 
out with a whimper. Dante wins a free kick on the edge of his box and whacks it 
long, but Real win it back, and carry it forward … Jese feeds Bale, but Bale’s 
right-foot shot is saved by Benaglio! That could have sealed it.
 
88 min: Caliguiri looks for Dost in the box, but his cross is overhit, and 
behind for a goal kick.
 
87 min: Corner to Real. It’s cleared, and Wolfsburg break … but Ramos, who has 
been excellent today, comes across and wins it firmly but fairly.Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> just can’t get it going in 
attack.
 
86 min: Jese, on for Benzema, cuts inside and fires one towards goal, and 
Benaglio tips over! Good save; it was deflected.
 
85 min: Dante clips Ronaldo in the centre circle, and that’s a yellow card. No 
argument.
 
84 min: Time’s running out for Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>. They’ve not really created 
much this half.
 
82 min: Kroos gets free in the box after Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> repel the initial cross, but 
he can’t make it count, and it’s a goal kick.

Just looking at the Ronaldo free kick again, the wall just came apart at the 
seams! Benaglio had no chance. If they wall stays together, Ronaldo doesn’t 
score. Oh, Wolfsburg!
 
81 min: Fine save from Benaglio! Benzema had it down the left, cut inside 
under a flimsy challenge from Rodriguez, but Benaglio got hands to it to tip it 
wide. Corner.
 
79 min: Well, Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> have 
11 minutes to get a goal, and Bas Dost is on for Joshua Guilavogui. Yellow card 
for Ronaldo for a late tackle on Arnold. It was a bad one; the caution was 
deserved.
 
78 min: Brilliant from Ronaldo. What a player he is! His sixth-hat trick of 
the campaign, his 460th career goal … but it went through the wall! A 
baby-lotion soft goal to give up: Ronaldo hit it well, but the wall just split. 
What a farce! Terrible defending, butReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are going through.

Amazing.
 
74 min: A loose pass in defence, and Modric is quickly on to it, bursting 
forward. Luiz Gustavo dives in, and though it looked like he got the ball, the 
ref says foul, and a yellow card is shown. Great chance from the free-kick, 
this.
 
73 min: The game is there for Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> to win; Wolfsburg are 
struggling here. Can they get a third goal before 90 minutes is up – or will we 
have to endure extra time?
 
72 min: The game is being played increasingly in Wolfsburg’s half. Half-chance 
for Karim Benzema, but it’s over the bar.
 
71 min: Henrique can’t continue, and Daniel Caligiuri takes his place.
 
69 min: Henrique is down after being caught in the face by Marcelo. There 
didn’t seem to be much in it, but the medical staff is on.
 
68 min: Fizzed in by Rodriguez towards Dante, but Ramos does really well to 
put him off, and the Brazilian’s header trickles through to Navas.
 
67 min: Real look much more likely to score again; Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> haven’t really threatened 
since half-time. But Schürrle tempts Pepe into a silly foul near the corner 
flag, and this is a chance from the set-piece.
 
65 min: Benzema skins Vieirinha on the left side, and wins the corner. Kroos 
with it, andit’s off the post from Ramos! So unlucky from the centre-back: he 
got a clear header, thumped it off the woodwork, and it rolled back right 
across the line, where Benaglio stuck a hand out instinctively and grabbed it. 
No need for goal-line technology – it was clearly not over the line – but a 
lucky escape for Wolfsburg!
 
63 min: Now Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> stream 
forward, but Vieirinha shoots when he should have passed, and it’s cleared from 
danger.
 
62 min: Oh, Benzema missed his header! Marcelo’s corner from the right, and 
Benzema was free, about eight yards out, but couldn’t get the purchase! That 
was a chance.
 
61 min: Real are on top here, but the longer the game goes on the jumpier you 
sense they’ll become. One false move in defence andWolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> have the upper hand again.

Another mistake from Guilavogui and it’s another corner to the hosts.
 
60 min: Ooh, a moment of panic for Wolfsburg! Modric ran beyond the attacking 
line, whipped a low ball across the box, and Guilavogui, running back, got his 
clearance wrong – but Benaglio saved! Good reaction stop from the Swiss: that 
was going in.

Sergio Perez/Reuters  
58 min: Bale tries to play it in from the right, but it’s way off target, and 
Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> have it back. Bale’s 
contribution this evening has been pocket-sized.
 
56 min: Ronaldo stands in that wide-legged position, but it’s not his best: 
the wall did its job and took the sting out of it. Corner to Madrid, but it’s 
wasted.
 Close but no cigar. Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images  
55 min: Ronaldo goes down in the penalty area, but no penalty, and no real 
complaint from the Portuguese. But now Kroos is bumped by Henrique about 30 
yards from goal, and this is a shooting chance.
 
53 min: Ramos does really well to charge forward down the left, but his cross 
is no good: out of play for a goal kick.
