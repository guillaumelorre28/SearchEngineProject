Younger citizens may not have heard of Neil Hamilton, who has made a 
triumphant return with Ukip to the Welsh assembly after 20 years in the 
political wilderness.

Not only has he been elected as one of seven Ukip assembly members via the 
regional list system, he has been appointed “group leader”, beating the head of 
the party inWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>, Nathan Gill. Gill 
remains Welsh leader of Ukip because that role is directly appointed by Nigel 
Farage, the party’s UK chief. This in no way sounds awkward.

Hamilton told ITV Morning Britain he had strong ties with the country 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/05/uk-election-results-2016-live-updates-and-news?page=with:block-572c8fbce4b00455bdea4017#block-572c8fbce4b00455bdea4017>
. “Cut me open, I’d be like a stick of Blackpool Rock,” he said, momentarily 
forgetting that Blackpool is not in Wales.

Does Neil Hamilton think Blackpool is in Wales?

Here’s a quick reminder of some of Hamilton’s career highlights, in case you 
were lucky enough to have missed them first time round.

He was a Tory whip in the 1980s

Hamilton became MP for Tatton in 1983, after failing to secure Bradford North 
in 1979. He served as a government whip under Margaret Thatcher, before 
becoming corporate affairs minister under John Major. Hamilton’s views and 
policies – anti-Europe, pro-privatisation, anti-trade unions, and pro-smoking – 
haven’t changed too much since.


He wanted to shut down the coal mines


Hamilton’s roots may have been in coal mining – both his grandfathers were 
south Wales miners – but he was part of the Thatcher government that went to 
war with the industry and its unions. “Britain couldn’t continue being an 
industrial museum for ever,”he explained

 more recently.


 He opposed the removal of lead from petrol


Hamilton wasn’t too impressed at the medical and environmental evidence on 
unleaded petrol, telling parliamentas recently as 1999 
<http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1989-05-10a.922.1&s=Neil+Hamilton+%22lead%22#g940.4>
 there was “no evidence that lead in petrol poses any health risk”.



A liar and a cheat

Hamilton’s political downfall came in 1996, after the Guardian reported he had 
taken money in brown envelopes from Mohamed Al Fayed in the 
“cash-for-questions” scandal. Hislibel suit against the paper collapsed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1996/oct/01/conservatives.uk>, leading to 
this infamous headline and his resignation from government. He went on to lose 
his Tatton seat to journalist Martin Bell in 1997’s general election.

Nowadays, Tatton’s MP is George Osborne, the chancellor.

He was the subject of a Louis Theroux documentary

In 2001, Hamilton was considered weird enough to justify a Louis Theroux 
documentary, appearing alongside his wife, Christine. The couple used the 
programme to relaunch themselves as media stars and it’s still compelling 
viewing, particularly Christine Hamilton’s flirt scene, and Neil’s House of 
Cards (original version) quoting response. The Hamiltons’friends in the Tory 
press weren’t too impressed 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4726974/Something-weird-about-Louis.html>, 
but the couple seemed to know what they were doing. While Neil’s political 
career was in the wilderness, he had a new plan.


He becomes an all-purpose Z-list celebrity

It’s difficult to imagine now, but the Hamiltons became archtypes for a new 
kind of celebrity: famous for being famous, the initial context of their fame 
(public scandal and humiliation) seemed forgotten in an endless round of 
shameless PR appearances.


He danced for Johnny Vegas’s fish

But suckling from the teat of media fame is a game of ever-descreasing 
circles, and tends to end one way: in a perspex cage being showered with fish 
while Johnny Vegas shouts: “You sicken me!”

He joins Ukip

After first appearing on a Ukip stage in 2011, eyebrows were raised when 
Hamilton was given important roles within the party, rising to the role of 
campaigns director.He was demoted from the role in 2014. <>
