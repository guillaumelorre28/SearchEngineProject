Sam Burgess has been included in the England squad for the first time since 
his return to rugby league after being named in Wayne Bennett’s 24-man squad 
for theFour Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/four-nations>.

Burgess, who last played for England in the 2013 World Cup, is the standout 
name in Bennett’s first squad as England coach, with the 27-year-old set to 
feature at international level for the first time since his spell in rugby 
union with Bath last year.

With Sean O’Loughlin out due to injury, Burgess is also likely to be among the 
frontrunners to replace the Wigan forward as captain. Bennett will name his 
captain before England’s one and only warmup game for the Four Nations against 
France in Avignon next weekend – with James Graham and the Warrington captain 
Chris Hill the other leading contenders.

“To have Sam Burgess <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sam-burgess> back is 
not just a boost for England but one for the international game,” Bennett said. 
“Having worked with him in the past, he’s a great bloke to have around and have 
by your shoulder on the field.”

The 66-year-old has also named four uncapped players in his squad – with the 
St Helens full-back Jonny Lomax the surprise inclusion. Lomax, who missed the 
first three months of the season because of a knee reconstruction, will win his 
first cap if selected, with his Saints team-mate Mark Percival, Hull’s Scott 
Taylor and Castleford’s Luke Gale the other three uncapped inclusions.

Bennett has retained 15 players from the squad that won last year’s 
three-match Test series against New Zealand, and has also handed England 
recalls to the likes of the Warrington duo of Daryl Clark and Stefan Ratchford, 
who had missed out on selection in previous years. Wigan’s Dan Sarginson also 
earns a recall after an impressive run of form during the Warriors’ run to the 
Super League title.

“There’s been a lot of competition for places this year and the players that 
have been picked are the ones we believe will stand up to the test of the 
competing nations,” Bennett said.

“I’ve always said that there wouldn’t be too many changes when I arrived and 
there are plenty of guys in the squad who worked hard in last year’s 
International Series win against New Zealand who have gone on and performed in 
2016.”

Notable omissions include the Hull hooker and 2016 Man of Steel Danny 
Houghton, as well as the likes of Zak Hardaker and Matty Smith, both of whom 
featured against New Zealand last year.

Speculation had lingered about whether Bennett would controversially pick a 
number of Australian-born players, but he has resisted the temptation to do so, 
instead insisting that he sees plenty of talent in the squad he has selected.

“There’s some serious talent in this English side and that’s testament to the 
England programme, the clubs they play for and the player’s attitude in wanting 
to do their best each week,” he said. “I’ve spoken to the boys and they’re well 
aware what’s ahead of them in this tournament.”
