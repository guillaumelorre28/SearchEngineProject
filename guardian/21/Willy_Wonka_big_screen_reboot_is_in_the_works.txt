The new Willy Wonka film is said to not to be an adaptation of one of Dahl’s 
two books featuring the character, but a standalone film focused on Wonka’s 
early adventures. It’s stressed, however, that the film will not be an origin 
story.

Variety hints that Charlie, the young boy who wins a golden ticket to Wonka’s 
chocolate factory in the first book, might not make an appearance in the film, 
suggesting that he’ll appear in “future installments of a possible franchise” 
if the revamp is a hit.

Wonka was last played onscreen by Johnny Depp in Tim Burton’s 2005 blockbuster 
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The original Willy Wonka, Gene Wilder, who 
played the character in the 1971 adaptation, died in August at age 83 from 
complications from Alzheimer’s. No cast has been announced of yet for the new 
film.

Dahl’s creation also got a stage musical adaptation courtesy of director Sam 
Mendes in 2003.
