Signs of renewed high street and factory activity set the scene for the 
Chancellor Gordon Brown to confirm official estimates of 1 per cent economic 
growth this year in today's Budget statement, a figure many commentators had 
dismissed as too optimistic.

 Retail sales rose in February for the second successive month, according to 
figures published by the British Retail Consortium today. Growth in the 12 
months to February stood at 1.3 per cent, lower than January's sales lead 
bounce-back of 2.5 per cent, but an improvement on the end of 1998 when sales 
were falling.

 The flagging manufacturing sector which has been struggling with the strength 
of sterling over the last year is also beginning to show signs of life, 
official figures published yesterday revealed.

 The Office for National Statistics said that manufacturing output rose by 0.1 
per cent between December and January, confirming recent business surveys which 
suggest that the sector is on the turn.

 The figures surprised City analysts who had pencilled in a 0.2 per cent fall. 
But economists warned that it was too soon to welcome the green shoots of 
recovery.

 'At best the new data may indicate some stabilisation in the manufacturing 
sector in line with the anecdotal evidence,' said David Coleman of CIBC. 'As 
yet, however, there is very little sign of outright expansion.'

 Most of manufacturing is still in recession and the pick-up is led by a few 
small sectors such as mobile phones and computers which are showing 
double-digit annual growth rates.

 Above average January temperatures suppressed demand for gas and electricity, 
causing the overall index of production to fall by 0.5 per cent over the month.

 Separate figures from the ONS showed a slight rise in inflation at the 
factory gate last month.
