 at The Valley.

However, Burnley’s celebrations during the match were marred by protests from 
Charlton fans, with the game being constantly interrupted as a number of flares 
were thrown on to the playing area and a supporter ran on to the pitch.

Sam Vokes scored the opener after 20 minutes as the statuesque Charlton 
defence failed to deal with a Stephen Ward cross and were duly punished.Burnley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/burnley> doubled their lead four minutes 
after the break when Andre Gray found George Boyd and he scored with a 
left-foot shot.

Gray added to his assist with a powerful finish after being picked out by Dean 
Marney to seal the win.

Despite the hostile home crowd, unhappy with the club’s owner, Roland 
Duchâtelet, Charlton gave it a good go, especially in the first half. Johann 
Berg Gudmundsson forced a good save from the goalkeeper Tom Heaton with a 
powerful low drive and was involved in Charlton’s best move of the match. He 
picked up a ball from Nick Pope and fed Ademola Lookman, who found Callum 
Harriott in space but his effort failed to match the buildup.

Burnley were already promoted and became champions in style, a cherry on top 
of the £170m bonanza coming their way for returning to the Premier League.

Marney was passed fit after recovering from a hamstring problem and started 
for Burnley – and soon made his presence felt in midfield.

Charlton were without the striker Yaya Sanogo, missing with a hamstring 
injury, and the defender Patrick Bauer, who is still struggling with an ankle 
injury. However, they were able to welcome back Jordan Cousins, who started in 
place of Johnnie Jackson. Jackson, the Charlton captain, replaced Gudmundsson 
after 66 minutes of what many believe to be the 25-year-old Icelander’s final 
game for the club.

Burnley’s third goal was greeted with a red flare thrown on to the pitch by a 
home fan but it was quickly dealt with. Another flare was hurled when a 
Charlton fan ran on to the playing area with a small banner before being caught 
by stewards.

Hundreds of Burnley fans invaded the pitch at the final whistle in jubilant 
celebration. Charlton fans magnanimously allowed them their moment but some 
Addicks supporters scuffled with police and stewards in front of the tunnel 
area.

The home fans then congregated in front of the main stand to protest 
peacefully against the Belgian owner and were joined by Burnley supporters.
