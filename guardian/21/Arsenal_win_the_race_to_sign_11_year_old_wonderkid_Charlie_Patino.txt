Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have won the race to 
sign Luton Town’s 11-year-old Charlie Patino at a cost of £10,000 in 
compensation.

Patino had caught the eye of Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham while Manchester 
City reportedly made a late attempt to lure the youngster to the north-west but 
he has opted for the Gunners because of their proximity to his home in St 
Albans.

Arsenal have missed out on another reported target, however, as the 
13-year-old Takefusa Kubo, dubbed “the Japanese Messi”, has signed for FC Tokyo 
from Barcelona.

Kubo joined Barcelona’s heralded La Masia academy in 2011 but Fifa ruled that 
the Spanish club violated international transfer regulations, forcing the 
teenager to return home.

Kubo, who could rejoin Barcelona when he is 18, had been training with Tokyo’s 
junior youth team since April. Manchester City were also reported to be among 
Europe’s big clubs interested in Kubo, who was recently selected for Japan’s 
under-15 team.
