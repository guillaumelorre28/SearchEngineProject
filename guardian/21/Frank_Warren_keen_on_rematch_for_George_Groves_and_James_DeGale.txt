Frank Warren would like to see a rematch between George Groves 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/george-groves> and James DeGale as a 
flagship bout on a new boxing channel. The promoter Warren was flanked by his 
top fighters at Thursday's launch of BoxNation at the O2.

The British and Commonwealth super-middleweight champion Groves recently 
joined Warren's camp from the Hayemaker promotional stable, signing a 
three-year deal in the hope of securing a world title shot. Unbeaten in 13 
fights with 10 stoppages, Groves is ranked in the top 15 with the WBC and IBF 
organisationsand beat DeGale on points in May in a tight grudge match 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/22/james-degale-george-groves-boxing>
. The 23-year-old, who will still be trained by Adam Booth, is open to a 
possible rematch with the Olympic gold medallist.

Warren would be keen to get that show on, provided both men come through their 
next bouts. Warren said: "What I have always done is put my fighters in with 
each other if they are at the same weight, because that is what the fans want.

"We don't keep them apart, we build fights. It is a natural rematch and is 
something which will happen, I am sure it will be some time next year and it 
will be a bigger fight. However, first of all George has got to get through 
Paul Smith, which will be a tough fight, and James has got to win the European 
title."

On 15 October all eyes will be on the Liverpool Echo Arena for the WBO light 
heavyweight title bout between Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew on a card that 
will also feature DeGale's European super-middleweight contest against Piotr 
Wilczeski before the action switches across the Atlantic for Bernard Hopkins 
versus Chad Dawson at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles.
