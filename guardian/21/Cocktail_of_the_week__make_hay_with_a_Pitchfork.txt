A refreshing long drink for the end of summer; it’s dead easy to make, too. 
For the hay cordial, just steep clean fresh hay (from a just-cut field or the 
pet shop) in a 50:50 sugar syrup; failing that, use green tea. Serves one.

50ml gin (we use Plymouth Navy Strength 
<http://plymouthgin.com/gins/navy-strength/>)
100ml hay cordial (or green tea)
25ml fresh lemon juice
Medium sweet cider, to top
1 slice each dried orange and green apple, to garnish

Pour the gin, cordial and lemon juice over ice into a tall glass or tankard. 
Top with cider, garnish with the dried fruit, and serve.
