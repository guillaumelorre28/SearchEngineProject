Two movies stand out, and making the now traditional should win/will win pick 
is very difficult.Barry Jenkins

’ Moonlight has commanded praise wherever and whenever it has screened, as a 
superbly crafted, beautifully acted, structurally audacious movie about gay and 
African-American sensibilities, transforming its theatrical origins into 
something like a personal epic of inner life.Kenneth Lonergan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/kenneth-lonergan>’s Manchester By the Sea has 
the same seriousness and solidity, and a fluent way of combining high drama and 
wry comedy. Of the two, MBTS is the more accessible and conventional, though a 
win for Moonlight would certainly be a satisfying rebuke to the new fashion for 
crude and ugly reactionary politics – and a vote for humanity.


Best film (musical or comedy)

Should win: La La Land

Will win: La La Land

The Globes are notable for creating a space for comedies and musicals – a 
valuable generic priority when awards voters elsewhere are encouraged always to 
bow the collective knee to movies they admire more but may secretly enjoy less.
Damien Chazelle <https://www.theguardian.com/film/damien-chazelle>’s La La Land 
is a conspicuously worthy recipient: a wonderfully entertaining, old-fashioned 
movie musical with a great romantic pairing inRyan Gosling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling> and Emma Stone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-stone>. It’s a homage to the former 
classics that doesn’t seem supercilious but open-hearted and ingenuous; a bold 
and ambitious step up for the director ofWhiplash

Best actor (drama)

Should win: Casey Affleck <https://www.theguardian.com/film/casey-affleck> 
(Manchester By the Sea)
Will win: Casey Affleck (Manchester By the Sea)

Casey Affleck <https://www.theguardian.com/film/casey-affleck> expresses a 
certain kind of wounded and unexpressed masculinity in Lonergan’s Manchester By 
the Sea. In many ways it is a film about male anger, and Affleck portrays and 
embodies that anger: it pulses off him like a heating element. He shows how 
this bottled rage reacts with anxiety and guilt and creates a kind of perverted 
eroticism in the way he goes to bars, ignores the attention of women and 
instead looks for men to fight. It is the performance with the most complexity 
and depth on this list.

Best actress (drama)

Should win: Isabelle Huppert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/isabelle-huppert> (Elle)
Will win: Amy Adams <https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy-adams> (Arrival)

For her pure outrageousness and inscrutable hauteur, Isabelle Huppert deserves 
to win for her typically imperious turn inPaul Verhoeven 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/27/paul-verhoeven-elle-isabelle-huppert-rape-comedy>
’s rape-revenge black comedyElle <https://www.theguardian.com/film/elle>. She 
is not a victim or even a survivor, but a lethal counterattacker, 
counterstrategist, counterdominator. It is the kind of performance that is 
usually given for a Tudor queen. Elsewhere, this is a strong list.Natalie 
Portman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/natalie-portman> has much admired for 
her portrayal ofJackie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/13/jackie-review-natalie-portman-kennedy-jfk>
 Kennedy andRuth Negga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/17/ruth-negga-hollywood-12-years-a-slave-misfits-preacher-iona-loving>
 gives a performance of tremendous subtlety inLoving 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/loving-review-civil-rights-tale-marries-heartfelt-drama-with-too-much-restraint>
, but Amy Adams is such a star turn in the sci-fi contact dramaArrival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/10/arrival-review-amy-adams-jeremy-renner-science-fiction>
 that I think she has this prize locked down.

Best actor (musical or comedy)

Should win: Ryan Gosling (La La Land)
Will win: Ryan Gosling <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling> (LA La 
Land)

Ryan Gosling is an actor who has matured and become more sympathetic (to use 
an awful word: relatable) by venturing into comedy. Shane Black’sThe Nice Guys 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/15/the-nice-guys-review-russell-crowe-and-ryan-gosling-cannes>
 was a smart move, and La La Land was smarter still. He has a face custom built 
for “sardonic” yet can also manage that tough-guy gallantry that is important 
for this role, playing the jaded jazz club manager who falls hard for Emma 
Stone’s beautiful wannabe star. Elsewhere,Hugh Grant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/hughgrant> is very good as the venal 
impresario-enabler inFlorence Foster Jenkins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/13/florence-foster-jenkins-review-meryl-streep-hugh-grant-stephen-frears>
. The same goes forRyan Reynolds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-reynolds> in the excellent Deadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero>
. But this will be Gosling’s night.

Best actress (musical or comedy)

Should win: Emma Stone (La La Land)
Will win: Meryl Streep <https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep> 
(Florence Foster Jenkins)

Emma Stone is entirely beguiling in La La Land: smart, romantic, funny. 
There’s a kind of funkily satirical self-awareness in her performance that 
transforms her vulnerability into strength. Casting her instead of a more 
natural singer such asAnna Kendrick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/anna-kendrick> (whose excellent musical The 
Last Five Years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/16/the-last-five-years-review-anna-kendrick>
 this slightly resembles) showcased the comedy for this character. My feeling 
though is that the Foreign Press Association will once again – and 
understandably – roll over for Meryl Streep for the umpteenth time, rewarding 
her tragicomic queenliness as the abysmal society warbler Mrs Jenkins.

Best supporting actor

Should win: Jeff Bridges <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeff-bridges> (Hell 
or High Water)
Will win: Jeff Bridges (Hell or High Water)

Again, not a bad lineup, and Dev Patel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/21/dev-patel-didn-t-know-what-getting-into-slumdog-marigold-hotel>
 is really good inLion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/lion-review-dev-patel-and-nicole-kidman-hunt-oscars-in-moving-adoption-drama>
: it is a moot point as to whether he should be considered as a leading man. 
But Jeff Bridges is such a great careworn cop inHell or High Water 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/hell-or-high-water-review-cannes-film-jeff-bridges-chris-pine>
, a performance of real weight that gives the movie perspective and ballast and 
functions very effectively as support to the two young leads. It’s something to 
compare with Tommy Lee Jones inNo Country For Old Men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/18/drama.thriller> or indeed Michael 
Shannon inNocturnal Animals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/02/nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-returns-with-wildly-gripping-revenge-tale>
. I found myself thinking, poignantly, of Bridges’s very Texan performance in 
Bogdanovich’sThe Last Picture Show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/14/the-last-picture-show-review> 
from 1971.

Best supporting actress

Should win: Naomie Harris <https://www.theguardian.com/film/naomie-harris> 
(Moonlight)
Will win: Nicole Kidman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolekidman> (Lion)

Naomie Harris is a superb performer who deserves a substantial leading role. 
Frustratingly, Hollywood isn’t (yet) giving it to her, but Moonlight has shown 
what she is capable of – transformed almost beyond recognition. However, my 
feeling is that the Globe will go toNicole Kidman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolekidman> who gives a very decent, 
heartfelt performance as the adoptive mother in Lion. She is not the very best 
contender, but a Globe for Kidman would be no disgrace.

Best director

Should win: Tom Ford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/02/tom-ford-nocturnal-animals-venice-film-2016-i-am-not-just-about-style>
 (Nocturnal Animals)
Will win: Tom Ford (Nocturnal Animals)

What a career quantum leap. Tom Ford was the fashion designer (lionised in the 
movieThe Devil Wears Prada <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/drama> 
for having attracted praise from Meryl Streep’s Wintouresque fashion editor 
Miranda Priestly) who made a good, if self-conscious, Hollywood debut as 
writer-director with his dramaA Single Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/a-single-man-review>. But 
Nocturnal Animals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/02/nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-returns-with-wildly-gripping-revenge-tale>
 is such a step up: dazzling, shocking, mesmeric. With thrilling confidence, he 
adapted Austin Wright’s much admired novel and made it live as a superb 
suspense thriller, with its daring double narrative.

Best screenplay

Should win: Taylor Sheridan <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792263/> (Hell or 
High Water)
Will win: Taylor Sheridan (Hell or High Water)

A screenwriting star is born. Taylor Sheridan is the former actor known for a 
recurring role in the TV biker dramaSons of Anarchy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/sep/22/sons-of-anarchy-getting-closure-ratings-eluded-deadwood>
. He went into writing, and stunned the 2015 Cannes film festival with his 
cracking script for Denis Villeneuve’s crime thrillerSicario 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/08/sicario-review-emily-blunt-at-the-sharp-end-in-war-on-drugs>
. Now he has got another project made: David Mackenzie’s politically aware 
stickup movie Hell or High Water. Very smart, stylish stuff.
