Foulmouthed, pansexual, and highly meta, Deadpool might be the outlier in 
superhero terms, but he is also the star of the most pirated movie of 2016,
according to figures compiled by filesharing news site TorrentFreak 
<https://torrentfreak.com/deadpool-torrented-movie-2016/>.

According to the site, precise figures are not available because, in the 
current reporting environment, it is more challenging to monitor downloads. But 
it says its estimates are based on several sources, including public BitTorrent 
trackers.

Deadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/feb/11/deadpool-video-review> – 
video review 
TorrentFreak says pirated versions of Deadpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero>
 emerged shortly before the film’s cinema release in February, and illegal 
downloads number in the “millions”. The film scoredover $783m at the global box 
office <http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=deadpool2016.htm>.

Two more high-performing superhero films occupied second and third spots, with 
the popularity ofBatman v Superman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/22/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-ben-affleck-henry-cavill>
 andCaptain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush>
 appearing to conform to the presumed comic-book sensibilities of torrent 
users. The former was released in March 2016, the latter in April. Two more 
comic-book adaptations –X-Men Apocalypse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/x-men-apocalypse-review-marvel-jennifer-lawrence-oscar-isaac>
 andSuicide Squad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/02/suicide-squad-review-dc-comics-will-smith-margot-robbie-jared-leto>
 – also feature on the list.

The appetite for pirated films also appeared to run along box-office lines, 
although videogame adaptationWarcraft 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/world-of-warcraft-the-beginning-review-end-already-nigh>
 andIndependence Day: Resurgence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/21/independence-day-2-resurgence-review-sequel-jeff-goldblum-charlotte-gainsbourg>
 performed relatively poorly at the box office (with, respectively, $386m and 
$389m globally), suggesting that piracy could have taken a significant bite out 
of revenues for both films.

The Revenant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/the-revenant-review-gut-churningly-brutal-beautiful-storytelling>
, at No 10 on the list, was notoriously posted on the internet before its 
release by former film studio employee William Kyle Morarity,who was convicted 
and fined $1.12m in October.
