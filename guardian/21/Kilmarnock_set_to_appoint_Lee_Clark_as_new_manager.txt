Kilmarnock <https://www.theguardian.com/football/kilmarnock> are expected to 
unveil Lee Clark as their new manager on Monday.

The Scottish Premiership club have been without a manager since 30 January, 
whenGary Locke resigned immediately after a home defeat to Hamilton Academical 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/30/gary-locke-quits-kilmarnock-hamilton>
. Kilmarnock were subsequently linked with Simo Valakari, Billy Davies, Graham 
Alexander and Neil Redfearn but have turned to Clark, who has been out of work 
since leaving Blackpool last May.

Clark’s first game in charge will be the Scottish Cup replay with Rangers on 
Tuesday evening. Under the caretaker manager Lee McCulloch, Kilmarnock drew 0-0 
at Ibrox and won a crucial relegation battle, 2-0 at Motherwell on Saturday. 
McCulloch was never viewed as a contender to succeed Locke on a permanent basis.

Clark, who served Newcastle United, Sunderland and Fulham as a player, enjoyed 
a successful time in charge of Huddersfield Town. He admitted to “shock” at the 
time of his sacking by the Yorkshire club in 2012. The 43-year-old subsequently 
managed Birmingham City where, like Blackpool, off-field events often 
overshadowed footballing matters.

At the time of Locke’s departure, Kilmarnock occupied the relegation playoff 
berth as second bottom in the top flight. They have now risen a place to 10th, 
and only two points from seventh, in what is a congested table.
