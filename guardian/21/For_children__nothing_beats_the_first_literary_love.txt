The back cover of Alan Moore <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alan-moore>’s 
new novel,Jerusalem, carries quotations praising the latest epic from the 
author ofWatchmen. At first sight, it reads like the typical blurb writer’s 
arms race of exaggerated love.Iain Sinclair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/iain-sinclair>, the Hackney magus, calls 
Moore’s book “the endgame of epic modernism”;John Higgs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/top10s/top10/0,,1835622,00.html>, chronicler 
of English psychedelia, hails it as “the highest achievement of the most 
groundbreaking English writer alive” andMichael Moorcock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/michael-moorcock> describes his rival cult 
hero as “one of the great visionaries of our age”.

The fourth quotation, though, trumps all of the above, both for directness and 
sincerity. This one comes from Joshua, a pupil at a school in Northamptonshire. 
“All in all,” he suggests of Moore, “you are the best author in human history. 
Please write back.”

The best children's books ever

Joshua was nine when he wrote that line to Moore, the payoff from a letter 
that began with a question: “I am writing because I want to know more about 
your comics includingV for Vendetta and Swamp Thing. I also want to say thank 
you for making such amazing graphic novels and how did you make such wonderful 
things?”

Moore was clearly touched by Joshua’s note. Before adding it to his book 
jacket, he wrote back: “Take care of yourself, Joshua. You’re obviously a young 
man of extraordinary good taste and intelligence, and you confirm my suspicion 
that Northamptonshire is a county touched by the gods…” before signing off: 
“Alan Moore. Best Author in Human History. In your face, Shakespeare, Joyce and 
Cervantes!”

That correspondence is preserved in the Letters of Note 
<http://www.lettersofnote.com/2016/07/you-are-best-author-in-human-history.html>
 project. Reading it is to remind yourself of that most sacred of bonds: the 
one that exists between a book-loving child and the author who first captures 
his or her imagination. Aged 10, I could have mounted a similarly defiant case 
forAlan Garner <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alangarner> as “the greatest 
writer in human history”.

My elder daughter, who at that age one summer sat in the fork of a yew tree in 
our garden readingJacqueline Wilson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/jacquelinewilson> nonstop, had the 
opportunity to convey that sentiment to her heroine at a book reading – except 
she was so trembly with excitement she couldn’t have got the words out.

One of the great things about Moore’s blurb is its implication that however 
hard adult critics might try to crank up their hyperbole to order, it never 
quite rings as true as authentic childhood wonder.

Jim didn’t care that it was an original drawing or anything. He saw it, he 
loved it, he ate it

When Maurice Sendak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/08/maurice-sendak>, author of Where 
the Wild Things Are, died in 2012, his publisher recalled the author’s 
favourite review. Sendak always personally replied to notes from children. 
After he received a card from one boy, he wrote back with a sketch of a Wild 
Thing monster and the words: “Dear Jim: I loved your card.” By return, a letter 
arrived from the boy’s mother. “Jim loved your card so much he ate it,” the 
note read. “That, to me, was one of the highest compliments I’ve ever 
received,” Sendak recalled. “Jim didn’t care that it was an original drawing or 
anything. He saw it, he loved it, he ate it.”

Kurt Vonnegut <https://www.theguardian.com/books/kurtvonnegut>, prisoner of 
war and survivor of the Dresden bombing, wrote some of the most singular and 
humane fiction of the last century. Towards the end of his life, some 
schoolchildren wrote to invite him to speak to their class and reflect on what 
he had learned. He wrote back with all the wisdom anyone probably needs: “Dear 
Xavier high school, you really know how to cheer up a really old geezer (84) in 
his sunset years. I don’t make many appearances any more because I look like an 
iguana.

“What I had to say to you, moreover, would not take long, to wit: practise any 
art, music, singing, dancing, acting, drawing, painting, sculpting, poetry, 
fiction, essays, no matter how well or badly, not to get money or fame but to 
experience becoming, to find out what’s inside you, to make your soul grow… Do 
it for the rest of your lives!”

It was Vonnegut who, tongue in cheek, advanced the notion 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP3c1h8v2ZQ> that the stories we begin to 
learn in childhood have recognisable emotional curves that could be fed into a 
computer (a notion that has, in fact, lately been employed in research projects 
to attempt to teach artificial intelligences the subtleties of human feeling). 
Those curves shape young minds, perhaps literally. A YouGov opinion poll 
commissioned by Amnesty International earlier this year showed that more than 
half (53%) of UK parents still think reading a book is the best way to develop 
a child’s ability “to put themselves in other people’s shoes”. Only 3% went for 
“playing a computer game” and 5% for “watching a film”. The book those surveyed 
thought most effective in this empathy creation wasRoald Dahl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl>’s The BFG.

The Disney film of Dahl’s book opens this first weekend of the school 
holidays. You guess the author would have been thrilled to seeMark Rylance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jul/18/roald-dahl-steven-spielberg-mark-rylance-the-bfg>
 whispering dreams into children’s ears. But Dahl would also be sure that there 
was nothing quite like the voice of his book working its own solitary magic.

He, too, made a point of corresponding with his young readers, never taking 
his responsibility as “the best author in human history” for granted.

A couple of years before he died, he wrote this note, which is preserved in the
Roald Dahl museum in Great Missenden <http://www.roalddahl.com/museum>, to a 
class of schoolchildren who had written, impatient for a new book: “Hello 
lovely Miss Bowers and all the children who wrote to me.

Your letters brought sunshine to my life. 
I showed them proudly to my lovely wife
Who said, ‘You really are a lucky boy
To have so many friends to bring you joy.’
Alas, this boy is getting old and grey, 
The hand that holds the pencil starts to
stray.
So is there yet another book in me?
You’re simply going to have to wait and
see.”


His correspondents didn’t have to wait too long. Matilda, whose heroine, as an 
avid reader, “travelled all over the world while sitting in her little room in 
an English village”, was published later that year.
