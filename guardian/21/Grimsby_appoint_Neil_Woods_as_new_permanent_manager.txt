Grimsby <https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> have appointed Neil 
Woods as their new manager until the end of the 2010-11 season. The former 
youth-team boss has been in temporary charge since Mike Newell left over a 
month ago and has impressed enough to be given the post permanently.

Interviews were held last week for the manager's job which has been vacant 
since the departure of Newell on 18 October. Woods was one of the six men 
interviewed and has now been charged with saving the Blundell Park club from 
relegation.

Grimsby have lost one and drawn three of their League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> matches under Woods, 
including the 0-0 draw at relegation rivals Lincoln on Saturday. The point 
still leaves the Mariners in the relegation zone, two points behind safety.
