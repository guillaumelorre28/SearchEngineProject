The former Castleford <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/castleford> player 
Ryan McGoldrick has put himself on eBay to try and find a new club.

He describes himself as a “1981 antique rugby league player” whose condiditon 
is “used” and who comes with “only surface scratches and rust”.

By midday on Wednesday, he had attracted 38 bids and stood at £215, with the 
winner due to pay McGoldrick on a per game basis.

“If a really feasible option did come up and it worked out, then I will go do 
it,”the 35-year-old told BBC Sport 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/36033267>.

The Australian utility player, who was also with Hull FC and Salford, said he 
took the decision after he signed for a side in New South Wales that then 
folded.


“I was at home speaking to my father-in-law and he came up with the idea to 
put myself on eBay and let them decide where I play,” he added.

“I am really open to seeing where it goes, if there is something serious then 
I am happy to sign a contract.

“There have been a couple of inquiries from England too but I have told them 
that postage comes at the buyer’s expense. They’ll have to make sure they can 
afford to get me over there.

“I hope I am not going anywhere too cold. If one of those sides come in for 
me, it will have to be in the summer months. Don’t expect me to train over 
winter.”

The website later took down his listing, prompting McGoldrick to tweet: “So 
eBay-UK has stopped my auction because I’m selling body parts or remains..?? 
I’ll just find another way! :).”
