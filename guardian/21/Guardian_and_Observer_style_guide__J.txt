J
joules; kJ kilojoules

Jack Daniel’s
note apostrophe; technically it is a Tennessee whiskey, not a bourbon

jack-in-the-box
but jack of all trades

jack russell
terrier first bred by the Rev John Russell in the early 19th century

Jacuzzi
TM; named after its US inventors, Roy and Candido Jacuzzi; call it a whirlpool 
bath unless you’re sure it really is a Jacuzzi

jail
not gaol (inexplicably, the Guardian persisted with this style well into the 
1980s, long after everyone else had changed)

Jalalabad
city in Afghanistan; Jalal-Abad is in Kyrgyzstan

Janjaweed
Sudanese militia; it means “man with a gun on a horse”

jargon
Originally jargon was “the inarticulate utterance of birds, or a vocal sound 
resembling it; twittering, chattering”.

The modern sense – defined as “mode of speech abounding in unfamiliar terms, 
or peculiar to a particular set of persons, as the language of scholars or 
philosophers, the terminology of a science or art, or the cant of a class, 
sect, trade, or profession” (OED) – dates from the 17th century.

Bill Bryson describes jargon thus: “The practice of never calling a spade a 
spade when you might instead call it a manual earth-restructuring implement”

Jay Z
no hyphen

JCDecaux
sells outdoor advertising space, but has no spaces in its name

Jeep
TM

Jehovah’s Witness

jejune
naive or unsophisticated, not necessarily anything to do with youth. Although 
jeune means young in French, jejune is derived from the Latin for fasting and 
originally meant deficient or scanty. The OED’s first listing of it in the 
modern sense is from George Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man, published in 1898

jellaba
loose cloak with a hood, worn especially in north Africa and the Middle East

Jerez

jerry-builder

Jerusalem
should not be referred to as the capital of Israel: it is not recognised as 
such by the international community. While the Knesset has designated the city 
as the country’s capital, a UN resolution of 1980 declared this status “null 
and void”. Jerusalem is the seat of government and Tel Aviv is the country’s 
diplomatic and financial centre

jerusalem artichoke
nothing to do with Jerusalem: this jerusalem comes from the Italian for 
sunflower

jetski

jewellery
in British English, not jewelry

jib
triangular sail or arm of a crane; “I don’t like the cut of his jib” means you 
don’t like the look or manner of someone

jibe
(not gibe) taunt

jihad
Used by Muslims to describe three different kinds of struggle: an individual’s 
internal struggle to live out the Muslim faith as well as possible; the 
struggle to build a good Muslim society; and the struggle to defend Islam, with 
force if necessary

jihadi
noun (plural jihadis) and adjective

Militant, extreme or violent jihadis may be used if a general term is needed 
to describe members or followers of a group such as Islamic State. We should, 
however, strive to avoid such generalisations and identify the actual group and 
its affiliations.

Individuals who are not formal members of any organisation, such as the 
Charlie Hebdo killers or Woolwich murderers, may reasonably be described as 
“violent jihadis”

jobcentres
are run by Jobcentre Plus

jobseeker’s allowance

job titles
are all lc: editor of the Guardian, governor of the Bank of England, prime 
minister, etc

jodhpurs

Joe Public, John Doe

Johansson, Scarlett

john dory
fish

John o’Groats
although the local newspaper is the John O’Groat Journal

Johns Hopkins University
not John Hopkins

jokey
not joky

Jolie, Angelina
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (“Brangelina” only when quoting someone)
have six children, all of whom have the surname Jolie-Pitt. Their charitable 
foundation is the Jolie-Pitt Foundation (originally the Maddox Jolie-Pitt 
Foundation, after one of the children)

Joneses
as in keeping up with the Joneses; also note the Joneses’ house (not the 
Jones’ house)

Jonsson, Ulrika

jubilee
diamond jubilee, etc

judgment
Try to resist the temptation to add the word “call”

judges
“Judge John Smith said” or “the judge, John Smith, said”
are both fine; “judge John Smith” is wrong.

Note that UK supreme court judges (or justices as they style themselves ) are 
Lord This or Lady That – hence Lady Hale, not “Lady Justice Hale”.

To call her Lady Justice Hale is to demote her to a court of appeal judge – 
who are (confusingly) Lord Justice This or Lady Justice That, eg Lady Justice 
Hallett

7 July 2005
The London suicide bombings may be referred to as 7/7 in headlines; the 
bombers were Hasib Hussain, Mohammad Sidique Khan, Germaine Lindsay and Shehzad 
Tanweer

jumbo jet
but jump-jet

the “Jungle”
Refer to it as the Calais refugee camp instead. While the “Jungle” is 
recognised as the camp’s name, it is a derogatory term so its use should be 
limited

junior
abbreviate to Jr not Jun or Jnr, eg Sammy Davis Jr

just deserts
not just desserts, unless you are saying you only want pudding

juvenile
the Criminal Justice Act 1991 replaced this term with “youth”, and raised the 
age at which you cease to be one from 17 to 18
