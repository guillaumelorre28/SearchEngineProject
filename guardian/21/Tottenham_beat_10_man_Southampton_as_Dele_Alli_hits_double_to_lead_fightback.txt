Tottenham Hotspur <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> had 
been forced to wait and, as each one of their top-six rivals won on Boxing Day 
or Tuesday, it might have felt pretty tortuous. But when they finally got their 
festive programme under way they made it count – and how.

Southampton 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened!

Mauricio Pochettino’s team shrugged off a second-minute concession to Virgil 
van Dijk and a generally sloppy start to produce a show of strength, in which 
Dele Alli scored twice and both Mousa Dembélé and Christian Eriksen sparkled 
around him. Danny Rose was also excellent.

Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> played the 
final 33 minutes with 10 men after Nathan Redmond’s sending-off for a foul on 
the goal-bound Alli and they were overwhelmed.

The visitors could even afford to miss a penalty in faintly comic 
circumstances – Harry Kane lifting his kick high over the crossbar after 
Redmond’s red-card offence – and they will remember it was in this fixture last 
December that they sparked their title chargewith an impressive 2-0 win 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/19/southampton-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report>
.

This performance was even more eye-catching. Kane had put them in front early 
in the second half, after Alli’s first-half equaliser, and they turned the 
screw once Southampton were a man down. The substitute, Son Heung-min, raced on 
to an Eriksen pass to drill home the third – it was the most clinical of 
finishes – and Alli gave the scoreline an emphatic feel with his second two 
minutes later.

The penalty/red-card double whammy, served up after considerable deliberation 
by the referee, Mike Dean, was the major talking point. It was a slick 
Tottenham counter-attack featuring Eriksen and Moussa Sissoko that had got Alli 
away and the chasing Redmond pulled at him from behind before they entered the 
area.

The Southampton winger then stumbled into Alli inside the box to make further, 
less obvious contact but it was still enough to knock the Tottenham player from 
his stride. Alli sent his shot wide as he went to ground. There was a dramatic 
pause as Dean considered his options, followed by a flourish when he flashed 
the red card.

Claude Puel, the Southampton manager, said the decision was “a little hard” 
and difficult to accept as it was simply “two players fighting for the ball” 
and he insisted that it had killed his team’s chances. On the other hand 
Pochettino was entitled to point out that Tottenham had not only been 2-1 up at 
the time but were well in control. And there was little doubt that Redmond had 
committed a last-man foul on Alli at some point.

The penalty carried shades of David Beckham’s decisive miss at Euro 2004  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXvGgb-P_7Y>for England against Portugal. When 
Kane planted his standing foot next to the spot he inadvertently created a 
divot beneath the ball and, in turn, he got horribly underneath the shot.

Kane said he had noticed before the game there was a relaid patch of grass 
just on the penalty spot while he also tweeted that “if there’s any NFL teams 
looking for a kicker in the future, have a look at my game tonight”.

He could afford to joke. Alli talked of Tottenham having made a big statement 
and nobody could disagree.

The only disappointment for Pochettino was in the yellow cards that Kyle 
Walker and Jan Vertonghen collected which will mean they are suspended for the 
trip to Watford on New Year’s Day. The manager is hopeful Toby Alderweireld – 
absent here because of a virus – will be available to return.

Pochettino saluted the character of his team and it was notable in what was a 
comeback win. Van Dijk had got in between Vertonghen and Rose to head home from 
James Ward-Prowse’s free-kick and for the first 15 minutes or so Southampton 
called the tune.

It was a sign of Tottenham’s irritation that Vertonghen left his hand across 
Jay Rodriguez’s face as if he meant it after making a clearance; the 
Southampton striker made no fuss and Dean took no action.

Southampton pressed hard at the outset and Redmond fizzed one low shot inches 
past Hugo Lloris’s far post.

The game turned on Alli’s equaliser. Dembélé initiated the move with a deft 
pass into the inside-left channel for Sissoko and, when his cross looped up off 
Redmond, Alli leapt in front of Van Dijk to direct a header in off the far post.

Tottenham had further chances before the interval. Eriksen blazed high and 
Victor Wanyama, booed on his return to Southampton, tricked through only to be 
denied by José Fonte’s block.

Southampton’s loss of hustle after their flying start was difficult to fathom 
and, when they lost their defensive bearings shortly after the second-half 
restart, they found themselves behind.

It said everything that Oriol Romeu was the nearest marker to Kane on 
Eriksen’s corner – and he was not close enough. Fraser Forster might have done 
more to keep out Kane’s header.

Fonte and the Southampton substitutes, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Dusan Tadic, 
had chances while Eriksen rattled the crossbar on 71 minutes.

But when Son and Alli showed their clinical edge, it meant Southampton had 
conceded four goals at home in thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> for the first time since 
1998.
