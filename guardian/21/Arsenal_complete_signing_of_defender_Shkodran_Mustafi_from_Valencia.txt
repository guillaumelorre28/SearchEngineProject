Arsenal have announced the signing of the defender Shkodran Mustafi from 
Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia>. The central defender, 
24, arrives after Arsène Wenger’s near summer-long pursuit and shortly after 
Calum Chambers’ loan departure to Middlesbrough.

Arsenal earlier on Tuesday secured the signing of Lucas Pérez from Deportivo 
La Coruña

, so Germany’s Mustafi becomes their sixth summer recruit after Granit Xhaka, 
Rob Holding, Takuma Asano, who has already joined Stuttgart on loan, and 
Kelechi Nwakali.

“He is at the right age,” Wenger told the club’s official website. “He has 
good experience. He is a very focused player who can play with the ball as 
well. We have taken a great player but have prepared well for the future.”
