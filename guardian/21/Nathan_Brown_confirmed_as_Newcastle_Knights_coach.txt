“This man [Brown] looks terrific to me and he does to the rest of the board,” 
McGuigan told Newcastle’s Radio 2HD.

“So we are all committed to having him on board. Next week, we’ll make it 
formal.

“We’ll be having an announcement ceremony and wishing him all the best for the 
future.”

An assistant coach with the NSW State of Origin side, Brown coached the 
Dragons from 2003 to 2008.

The former NRL hooker then moved to the Super League in England where he 
coached Huddersfield Giants for four seasons before heading up St Helens and 
leading them to a grand final win last year.
