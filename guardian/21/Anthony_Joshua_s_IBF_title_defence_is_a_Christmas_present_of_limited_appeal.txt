It is in one respect unfair that Anthony Joshua 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anthony-joshua> should be pilloried for 
defending his IBF world title against a third moderate American in the shape of 
Eric Molina in Manchester on 10 December.

The Watford fighter came late to boxing as a rebellious teenager who might 
have been lost to a life of street crime, but that has not hindered his rise to 
the top with an undisturbed run of 17 professional knockouts after winning 
Olympic gold in London four years ago. The 27-year-old is an ornament to the 
game, dedicated, amiable and dangerous.

However, it is a marginal call by Matchroom and Sky to ask fans to pay extra 
for the privilege of watching a rampant young champion go to it against a 
34-year-old opponent with a CV saved from ridicule only by one of his three 
defeats, when he was beaten up and stopped by the American knockout artist 
Deontay Wilder in June last year.

Defenders of Joshua’s match, which was announced on Tuesday afternoon, as 
probably the worst kept secret in boxing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/19/anthony-joshua-defend-title-december-klitschko-boxing>
 – will point with justification to Molina’s last outing when he punched the 
once very good but still small heavyweight Tomasz Adamek into retirement in 
April. Adamek, rising 40, had his best nights a long time ago. Nevertheless, if 
the Pole had managed to get to his feet in the 10th he could have lost the 
final two rounds and still won the fight as he was ahead by five points.

Those are not the sort of credentials that mark out Molina as in any way a 
satisfactory substitute forWladimir Klitschko 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wladimir-klitschko>, the dominant champion 
of his era whose challenge had been touted loud and long but who not only 
proved a difficult negotiator – throwing in a demand that the vacant WBA title 
be put on the line too – but who picked up a minor injury last week.

Elsewhere the alternatives went their own way, leaving Eddie Hearn with a 
headache probably as big as the one Joshua will inflict on Molina.

So we are left with a Christmas present of underwhelming appeal. However, 
there is a pretty decent contest on the undercard as Dillian Whyte, who gave 
Joshua his biggest scare before the uppercut of the year crunched his senses, 
goes against the now evergreen Dereck Chisora.

Chisora has nowhere to go. Whyte still has the cache of inconveniencing 
Joshua, who then went on to dispose of a very poor IBF titleholder in Charles 
Martin and a marginally more ambitious challenger in Dominic Brezeale.

British boxing fans have waited a while for a world heavyweight champion who 
might one day match the deeds of Lennox Lewis. Their patience is not bottomless.
