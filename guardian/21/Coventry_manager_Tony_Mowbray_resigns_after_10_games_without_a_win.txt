Coventry said in a statement: “Without a win in the first 10 league games, 
Tony felt on a professional level he was no longer able to take the club 
forward.

“Coventry City would like to thank Tony for all his energy and dedication over 
the past 18 months. We would also like to wish Tony all the very best for the 
future and put on record he will always be welcome at the club. Mark Venus will 
take responsibility of first-team duties with immediate effect.”

Mowbray, who also managed Hibernian, West Brom, Celtic and Middlesbrough, took 
charge at Coventry in March 2015. He leaves with an overall record of 26 wins, 
26 defeats and 24 draws from 76 matches.
