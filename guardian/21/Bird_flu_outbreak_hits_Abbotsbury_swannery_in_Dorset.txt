An outbreak of avian influenza has been detected at the historic Abbotsbury 
swannery in Dorset, <http://abbotsbury-tourism.co.uk/swannery/> where 80 birds 
have died.

The H5N8 strain of bird flu has been confirmed in nine mute swans but testing 
stops once the presence of the disease has been established so it is not known 
how many have been struck by the disease. Usually 30-40 swans would be expected 
to die over a typical winter.

Measures are being taken to stop the disease spreading to poultry flocks but 
the 1,000 free-flying swans at Abbotsbury are wild and it is not possible to 
completely confine them.

Avian flu has been detected in poultry flocks from Lincolnshire to south-west 
Wales and as far north as Yorkshire as well as in wild birds across the country.

Poultry keepers in England, Wales and Scotland have been ordered to keep their 
flocks separate from wild birds until the end of February.

Staff at Abbotsbury swannery, which is thought to have been established by 
Benedictine monks in the 11th century, spotted mute swans looking lethargic and 
then dying shortly before Christmas.

It sent the bodies for testing and the H5N8 strain was confirmed in nine birds.

John Houston, the Abbotsbury Tourism general manager, said the welfare of the 
birds and of swannery staff was the priority.

“Cases of avian flu have been reported in wild birds in Europe and in a number 
of locations across the UK. The current H5N8 strain of bird flu is of very low 
risk to public health and has never transferred to humans, but the wellbeing of 
the swans and other birds that visit the swannery is paramount,” he said.

“The swannery is closed to the public for the winter and is not due to reopen 
until March. Current access to the site is therefore restricted to staff 
members only. We are closely monitoring the health of the swans and our staff 
are taking all necessary precautionary measures as advised.”

Houston said staff were very distressed over the outbreak. “This is a vocation 
for them. They live and breathe it. But that is nature.”

Benedictine monks used to farm the swans at Abbotsbury for lavish banquets. 

In November and December, the population triples when hundreds of other swans 
not native to the area go to Abbotsbury to feed on the plentiful eelgrass.
