Fremantle AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> defender Michael Johnson 
has been charged with assault after allegedly punching a man in a kebab shop. 
Johnson will appear in court in January over the incident.

The 32-year-old allegedly punched a Bunbury school teacher earlier this month 
after being filmed with his pants around his ankles. The incident was partially 
captured by CCTV.

Johnson is the second Docker to be charged this month with assault. Forward 
Shane Yarran will face court after being charged with aggravated assault for an 
incident earlier this month involving a family member.

Continuing a woeful off-season for the Dockers, midfielder Harley Bennell has 
suffered another calf injury, but Fremantle hope he’ll still be available for 
round one of the 2017 season. Bennell failed to play a single game last year 
after tearing his right calf.

The Dockers say the latest injury is to his left calf, and he will travel to 
Munich next month to see Dr Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfarht to try to find a 
solution for his soft-tissue problems.

Muller-Wohlfarht, affectionately known as “Healing Hans”, has previously 
treated Collingwood’s Ben Reid and Geelong’s Max Rooke for soft-tissue 
injuries. Fremantle said Bennell suffered his latest injury last Friday at 
training.

In another blow for the Dockers, star midfielder Lachie Neale has undergone 
minor surgery on his right knee. Fremantle hope Neale will be able to return to 
full training duties in January, and be available for round one.
