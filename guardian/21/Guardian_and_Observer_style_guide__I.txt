iconic
in danger of losing all meaning after an average three appearances a day in 
the Guardian and Observer, employed to describe anything vaguely memorable or 
well-known – from hairdressers, storm drains in Los Angeles and the Ferrero 
Rocher TV ads to Weetabix, the red kite and the cut above the eye David Beckham 
sustained after being hit by a flying boot kicked by Sir Alex Ferguson. Our 
advice, even if our own writers rarely follow it, is to show a little more 
thought, and restraint, in using this term

icons
A selection of the things described in the Guardian as “iconic” in a heady 
fortnight in 2010:
Archaeopteryx
bluefin tuna
Castro’s cigar
David Beckham wearing an anti-Glazer scarf
Grace Kelly in casual wear
Imperial War Museum North
Liberty prints
limestone stacks in Thailand
Nigel Slater
Mad Men
Variety
the John Hughes films Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and Weird 
Science
postboxes
prints of the Che Guevara image
Stephen Fairey’s Obama Hope design
the parliamentary constituency of Hove
Brandenburg Gate
Bach’s St Matthew Passion
a community-owned wind turbine
Kraft cheese slices
salmon farming
the blue and white stripes of Cornishware pottery
Penarth Pavilion, Cardiff
the Norwegian church and Pierhead Building in Cardiff Bay
a multimillion-pound arena in Leeds
a “rock-built engine house at Bottalack near St Just”
the Royal Albert Hall
wind turbines (“iconic renewable energy technology”)
Wembley Arena
the video for Kylie Minogue’s Can’t Get You Out of My Head

ID cards
now “consigned to history”, at least in the UK

ie
no full points or commas, ie like this

if not
can be ambiguous: does “it is the most beautiful castle in France, if not the 
whole of Europe” mean “and maybe in the whole of Europe” or “but not in the 
whole of Europe”?

IJ
If a Dutch word starts with IJ then both letters are always capped (there is a 
waterway called the IJ so a lot of places have IJ in their name, eg IJsselmeer, 
IJmuiden, etc)

illegitimate
should not be used to refer to children born outside marriage (unless in a 
historical context, eg “the illegitimate son of Charles the Good”)

iMac, iPad, iPhone, iPod, iTunes
The trend for sticking an “i” in front of new products to make them seem 
whizzy began in 1997, when Ken Seagall, a creative director at Apple, came up 
with the iMac name when the computer was in development. “The i meant 
internet,” Segall says. “But it also meant individual, imaginative and all the 
other things it came to stand for.” Apple’s founder, Steve Jobs, initially 
pooh-poohed the name

Imax
cinemas, so named in 1968

immaculate conception
has nothing to do with the birth of Jesus: it is the doctrine that Mary 
herself was conceived by her mother (St Anne) without the stain of original 
sin. The virgin birth is the doctrine of Christ’s birth without a human father. 
This is one of our most frequent errors

immigrate
to arrive in a country; emigrate to leave one
Hence immigrant, immigration, emigrant, emigration

Immigration and Nationality Directorate
may be called “the immigration service”

immune to
not immune from

impact
is best used as a noun, not a verb: “could potentially impact” is more 
eloquently and concisely expressed as “might affect”; affect or have an effect 
on are invariably preferable to “impact” or “impact on”

impacted
a tooth

Imperial College London
(no commas) is no longer part of the University of London

impinge, impinging

imply or infer?
To imply is to suggest; to infer is to conclude.

 Homer: “What are you inferring?”
Lisa: “I’m not inferring anything. You infer; I imply.”
Homer: “Well that’s a relief.”

 Many people use infer when they mean imply, and they are in good company: 
Milton, Sir Walter Scott and Mervyn Peake in Titus Groan all did it


impostor
not imposter

impracticable or impractical?
Reference books typically define the former as “not practical”, and the latter 
as “not able to be done”. In other words: for all practical purposes, they mean 
the same thing; use impractical, as it’s shorter


impressionism, impressionist


painting

in
can lead to ambiguous headline constructions such as “Marconi chief in board 
clearout” – is the chief clearing out the board or being cleared out with them?

in or on?
in the team (UK), on the team (US).

The once widely used “in Oxford Street”, “in the high street” etc appear to 
have been largely supplanted in recent years by on Oxford Street, on the high 
street, etc

in/out referendum

inadmissible
not -able

inchoate
Nothing to do with chaos, it means newly formed, whether describing someone’s 
literary skills or the universe shortly after the big bang

incidence
amount, eg a high incidence of incidents

incident
has political connotations, so attack or clash is often preferable; within a 
couple of years of the massacre in Tiananmen Square the Chinese government was 
referring to it as an “incident” or even “alleged incident”

income support, income tax
lowercase

Independent Police Complaints Commission
replaced the Police Complaints Authority

index
plural indexes, except for scientific and economic indices

Indian ink
in the UK; India ink in the US

india rubber

Indian placenames
the former Bombay is now known as Mumbai, Madras is now Chennai, and Calcutta 
is nowKolkata

indie
music, films, etc; Indy abbreviation for the Indy 500 car race and the 
Independent, a newspaper (now online only)

Indigenous Australians
the preferred term for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people

indispensable
not indispensible

Industrial Revolution

industrial tribunals
have not existed since 1998, when they became employment tribunals; they still 
appear in the pages of the paper with embarrassing frequency despite regular 
corrections from the readers’ editor

infer or imply?
to infer is to deduce something from evidence; to imply is to hint at 
something (and wait for someone to infer it)

infinite
means without limit, not just “very big”

infinitives
See split infinitives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-s#split> 

inflammable
means the same as flammable, which we prefer; the negative is non-flammable

inflammatory
speeches, etc

information commissioner
but Information Commissioner’s Office

initials
no spaces or points, whether businesses or individuals, eg WH Smith, AJ Strauss

injunction
the verb is enjoin, not “injunct”

Inland Revenue
See Revenue & Customs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-r#revenue> 

inner city
noun two words, adjective hyphenated: inner-city blues made Marvin Gaye wanna 
holler

innocent civilians
the adjective is superfluous

innocuous

innuendo
plural innuendoes

inoculate
not innoculate

inpatient
but in-tray

inquiry
not enquiry

inshallah
means “God willing” in Arabic

insidious or invidious?
The former means subtly or gradually harmful (“an insidious disease”); easily 
confused with the latter, which means likely to arouse resentment (“she put 
herself in an invidious position”)

insignia
are plural

insisted
overused, especially in political reporting, perhaps to imply that you don’t 
believe the speaker; “said” should normally suffice

install, instalment

instil, instilled, instilling

Institute for Fiscal Studies

Institute for Government
not “Institute of Government”

Institute for Public Policy Research

insure
against risk; assure life; ensure make certain

insurgents, insurgency

 “The search, which aroused intense opposition from local people, was 
intensive”

internet
net, web, world wide web
See websites 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-w#websites>

interpreter
works with the spoken word; often confused with translator, who works with the 
written word

InterRail

intifada

into or in to? 
If you go into a room or look into something, it’s one word; if you call in to 
complain, listen in to someone’s conversation, or go in to see them, it’s two. 

On to is two words
See on to <https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-o#on to> 

introducing people
Do not use the following construction to introduce a speaker or a subject: 
“Foreign secretary Philip Hammond said ... ” Use the definite article and 
commas to separate the job from the name, like this: “Philip Hammond, the 
foreign secretary ... ” (there is only one person with this specific post).

Commas are not used if the description is more general and could apply to more 
than one person, like this: “The health minister Norman Lamb said ... ” (there 
are several health ministers); or like this: “The Liberal Democrat MP Norman 
Lamb said ... ” (after the 2010 election, there were 57).

Another example: “Michael Billington, the Guardian’s theatre critic, gave his 
verdict ... ” is correct; “The theatre critic Michael Billington gave his 
verdict ... ” is fine as well

introductory words
at the start of a sentence such as “However”, “Nonetheless”, “Instead”, should 
be followed by a comma

Inuit
not Eskimos; an individual is an Inuk

invalid
means not valid or of no worth; do not use to refer to disabled or ill people

invariable, invariably
unchanging; often used wrongly to mean hardly ever changing

“Labour MPs inveighed against Tony Blair for inveigling them into the plan to 
invade Iraq”

invitation
noun

invite
verb; so you do not send someone an “invite”

iPad, iTunes

IPCC
may refer to the Independent Police Complaints Commission or the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

iPhone 6S, iPhone 6C
plural 6Ss, 6Cs

iPod
only when you are sure it is an Apple iPod; the generic term is MP3 player or 
digital audio player

Ipsos Mori
pollsters

Iraqi placenames
Amara, Baiji, Baghdad, Baquba, Basra, Diwaniya, Dohuk, Falluja, Haditha, 
Hilla, Irbil, Kerbala, Kirkuk, Kut, Mosul, Najaf, Nassiriya, Nineveh province, 
Ramadi, Rutba, Samarra, Samawa, Sulaimaniya, Tikrit (note that these 
transliterations do away with al- prefixes and the final H)

Ireland, Irish Republic
not Éire or “Southern Ireland”

iridescent
one R

Irish Travellers
initial caps, as they are recognised as a distinct ethnic group under race 
relations legislation

iron age, iron curtain

Ironbridge, Iron Bridge
The former, a village on the Severn in Shropshire, is home to the latter; they 
are part of the Ironbridge Gorge Unesco world heritage site

ironic, ironically
Do not use when what you mean is strange, coincidental, paradoxical or amusing 
(if you mean them say so, or leave it up to the reader to decide). There are 
times when ironic is right but too often it is misused, as in this typical 
example from the paper: “Santini’s Tottenham won 2-0 at Nottingham Forest, 
ironic really with the north London club having a big interest in Forest’s 
Republic of Ireland midfielder Andy Reid ... “ (not that sport are the only, or 
biggest, offenders).

As Kingsley Amis put it: “The slightest and most banal coincidence or point of 
resemblance, or even just- perceptible absence of one, unworthy of a single 
grunt of interest, gets called ‘ironical’.” The idiotic “post-ironic”, which 
Amis would be glad he did not live to see, is banned

Is
as in dotting the Is and crossing the Ts

Isa
individual savings account, but no need to spell it out

-ise
not -ize at end of word, eg maximise, synthesise (exception: capsize)

Islam
means “submission to the will of God”.

Muslims should never be referred to as “Mohammedans”, as 19th-century writers 
did. It causes serious offence because they worship God, not the prophet 
Muhammad.

“Allah” is Arabic for “God”. Both words refer to the same concept: there is no 
major difference between God in the Old Testament and Allah in Islam. Therefore 
it makes sense to talk about “God” in an Islamic context and to use “Allah” in 
quotations or for literary effect.

The holy book of Islam is the Qur’an (not Koran)

Islamic State
at first mention, thereafter Isis. The abbreviation stands for Islamic State 
in Iraq and the Levant (“al-Sham”), which is why some people call it Isil. The 
group was originally al-Qaida in Iraq

Islamist
A believer in political Islam, which favours the organisation of government 
and society in accordance with laws prescribed by Islam. So the Justice and 
Development party (AKP) in Turkey and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt are 
Islamist parties. “Islamist” should not be used as a synonym for Islamic 
fundamentalist, extremist or militant

Islamophobia

Isles of Scilly
an alternative is Scilly, but not Scilly Isles

isotopes
Do not abbreviate, eg carbon-14, uranium-235 (not U235, U-235, etc)

Israel Defence Forces
IDF after first mention

issue
not a synonym for problem (“she has stylebook issues”)

italics
Use roman for titles of books, films, etc; the only exceptions are the Review 
and the Observer, which by special dispensation are allowed to ignore the 
generally sound advice of George Bernard Shaw:

“1 I was reading The Merchant of Venice.
2 I was reading ‘The Merchant of Venice’.
3 I was reading The Merchant of Venice.
The man who cannot see that No 1 is the best-looking, as well as the 
sufficient and sensible form, should print or write nothing but advertisements 
for lost dogs or ironmongers’ catalogues: literature is not for him to meddle 
with.”

Use italics for foreign words and phrases (with roman translation in 
brackets); poetry and scientific names.

Never use italics in headlines or standfirsts

it’s
shortened form of it is or has: it’s a big dog, it’s been ages since I saw her

its
possessive form of it: the dog is eating its bone

ITV1, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4

Ivory Coast
not “the Ivory Coast” or Côte d’Ivoire; its nationals are Ivorians

Ivy League universities
Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth College, Harvard, Princeton, University of 
Pennsylvania, Yale

Izz ad-Din al-Qassam
military wing of Hamas
