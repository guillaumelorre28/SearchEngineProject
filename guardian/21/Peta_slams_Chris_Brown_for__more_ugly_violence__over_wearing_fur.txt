Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has slammed Chris Brown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/chris-brown> for wearing fur during New York 
fashion week. The animal rights organisation said that Brown was “out of touch” 
and accused him of “more ugly violence”.

The pop R&B star had been attending the Michael Costello runway show along 
with his girlfriend Karrueche Tran, who was also clad in fur.


In a statement, Peta said 
<http://www.gossipcop.com/chris-brown-fur-karrueche-tran-peta-fashion-week/>: 
“There are few things more out of touch than draping yourself in the skins of 
animals who were beaten, electrocuted, and even skinned alive for their fur. 
Pink’s New York Fashion Week Peta billboard shows that true beauty comes from 
kindness – Chris Brown’s furs are just more of the same from him: ugly 
violence.”

The statement refers to a 90ft billboard in Times Square which featured a 
clothes-free Pink under the tagline: “I’d rather go naked than wear fur”. 
Underneath it said: “Be comfortable in your own skin, and let animals keep 
theirs.”


The Brown controversy arose after Tran posted a picture of herself and Brown 
to Instagram, with both of them posing in fur next to musician Christina Milian.


Peta has stepped up its attacks on pop stars recently. Last week they 
criticised Kanye West and Kim Kardashian for dressing their daughter North in 
fur during West’s show for Adidas.
