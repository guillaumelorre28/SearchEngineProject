Following the launch of the new Guardian website in the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2014/oct/29/-sp-welcome-to-the-new-guardian-us>
, we are starting to change sections of the site for more of our audience.

Today, Technology <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/technology>, Science 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science> and Environment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/environment> have launched with our new look. 
This thread is the place to discuss these changes with members of the project 
team.

We welcome your feedback in the comments below, or via this form
