When does journalism become propaganda? That was the question being asked in 
the SBS newsroom last week when the network scored an exclusive interview with 
the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Airing on Friday, the night before the 
election, reporter Luke Waters’ interview was hard won. He spent two years 
pursuingwhat he now describes as a “bizarre experience” 
<http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/07/01/inside-syria-how-i-interviewed-president-bashar-al-assad>
.

 “Once inside, I meet with the senior press office staff responsible for 
arranging the interview,” Waters says. “After Arabic coffee and small talk, 
logistics for the next day’s interview are discussed. It’s made clear that the 
interview must not be edited in any fashion. The department head, a former news 
anchor herself, explains that hard questions are welcome but rudeness and 
interruptions are not.”

SBS agreed to a pre-interview discussion with officials, to broadcast the 
25-minute interview in full and to use the footage shot by four of the regime’s 
own cameras inside the presidential palace in Damascus. Some SBS journalists 
told Beast they believe too many restrictions were placed on the network. A 
spokesman forSBS <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sbs> denies the questions 
were approved beforehand but says “we provided the topic areas for questions” 
and confirms all the editing was done by the regime.

“The Syrian technical team compiled the interview with SBS’s Luke Waters 
present,” a spokesman told Beast. “SBS confirms that the cut was the full 
interview and that no questions or answers were edited out.”

Perhaps the best test of how beneficial the exercise was for Assad – who was 
labelled a “murderous tyrant” by the Australian prime minister, Malcolm 
Turnbull – is to see how the regime reported the interview in its state-run 
media.The official Syrian media said:

President Bashar al-Assad <https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad> 
said the contradiction seen between the Australian officials’ statements and 
the official Australian stance towards Syria is an expression of the double 
standards followed by the West in general.

“They attack us politically, and then they send their officials to deal with 
us under the table, especially their security officials – including their 
government,” added the president in an interview with the Australian SBS TV 
channel due to be aired on Friday.

“All of them do that as they don’t want to upset the US … In fact, most of the 
western officials only repeat what the US wants them to say.”

The full interview will be posted on the Syrian Presidency’s official Facebook 
page at 12: 30pm on Friday (Damascus time) at the same time the interview will 
be aired on the Australian TV channel (Canberra time).

Allergic to Nutt?

ABC news aired a most unfortunate subtitle on Wednesday night, accidentally 
labelling Tony Nutt the Liberal party’s “dictator” instead of director. Was it 
because Nutt had been described in several reports in recent days as one?

“Tony Nutt, the head of the Coalition’s re-election campaign, has been accused 
of blowing the government’s poll chances by running an eight-week 
‘dictatorship’,” according tonews.com.au <http://news.com.au>. 

Or was it because the billionaire retailer Gerry Harvey lamented that 
Australia was ungovernable and should bring in a dictator? The ABC apologised 
for the slip at the end of the bulletin.

Final curtain after Drum battle 

The former ABC managing director Mark Scott set up the opinion website The 
Drum back in 2009 and it was funded largely by a discretionary fund from the 
MD’s own office. But when that money ran out and the news division had to pick 
up the tab, the end was nigh, insiders say. There has always been a division 
between those who believe the ABC shouldn’t be in the opinion space and those 
who thought the broadcaster should provide a forum for debate. The ABC’s news 
director, Gaven Morris, was in the first camp and, when he had to tighten his 
purse strings,The Drum was a casualty

Crocodile: done deed

The NT News recently updated its team of news reporters and among the prosaic 
rounds of education reporter, civic reporter, health reporter and court 
reporter was a unique round. Is the NT News the only paper in the world to have 
a “croc and UFO reporter?” Jill Poulsen is the lucky journalist to have landed 
this sensational round.

 Media milks Hanson’s return

 The post-election silly season is providing some excellent fodder for 
reporters. We particularly like the one about Pauline Hanson and Coles’ cheap 
milk.According to the Daily Mail 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3676407/Pauline-Hanson-accused-using-Coles-brand-milk-tea-slamming-supermarkets-not-supporting-Australian-dairy-farmers.html>
, Hanson was caught out topping up her cuppa with a bottle of $2 milk. This was 
a story because in May she said: “I would pay another 50c a litre for my milk 
if it went straight to the dairy farmers.”

 Hanson’s spokesman, James Ashby, told Channel Nine the milk did not come from 
Coles. Hanson responded on Facebook on Thursday with a photo of non-Coles milk.

“It must be a slow news morning for some outlets. I woke up this morning to 
find claims I support Coles milk. I thought those people without lives might 
like to see what’s in the fridge today.”
