Kingsley Coman and Robert Lewandowski 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/robert-lewandowski> both scored in the 
second half to earn the Bundesliga leaders, Bayern Munich, a 2-0 win at 
Wolfsburg on Saturday.

The defending champions stayed on course for an unprecedented fourth straight 
title and provisionally increased their lead over Borussia Dortmund to 11 
points as Dortmund host Hoffenheim on Sunday.

Lewandowski raised his best ever tally of Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> goals in one season 
to 23 goals. The second goal killed off any lingering hopes Wolfsburg had of 
taking anything out of the game. Pep Guardiola’s team did just enough to win 
against last season’s runners-up.

Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> wasted the better 
chances in the first half despite Bayern’s dominance. Franck Ribéry came on 11 
minutes into the second half for Arjen Robben and the French international 
played a role in both of Bayern’s goals.

He dribbled past three Wolfsburg players before passing to Lewandowski, whose 
shot was deflected. The ball fell kindly to Coman, who slotted it home from 
close range after 66 minutes.

The same three players also created Bayern’s second in the 74th. Coman broke 
through on the right and crossed into the area, Ribéry chested the ball down 
and Lewandowski drove it inside the post with the outside of his right foot.

Lewandowski scored a Bundesliga-record five goals

 inside nine minutes when Bayern won 5-1 at home in September.
