If you want to offer us a contribution you should consider which section of 
the newspapers or websites is most likely to be interested. Contact the 
commissioning editor for this section - ideally by phone or email - and briefly 
outline your idea.

The commissioning editor may offer to “take a look” at your proposed 
contribution. This means that you are invited to submit it speculatively and 
you will be paid only if your contribution is published.

Unless you are already an established contributor, it is most unlikely that 
the editor will “order” or commission a contribution from you.

Please do not send pictures or artwork unless we request them. We do not 
accept responsibility for loss of unsolicited prints, transparencies, etc.

Contributions should be sent to us electronically. Other methods are possible 
- but only in exceptional circumstances.

We publish contributions from all freelances on our standard copyright terms 
and payment is at our normal rates, unless agreed otherwise before publication.
