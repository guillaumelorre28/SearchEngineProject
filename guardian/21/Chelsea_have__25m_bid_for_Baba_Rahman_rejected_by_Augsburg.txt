The Ghana left-back, 21, has been identified as the player José Mourinho wants 
to replace Filipe Luís, who wassold back to Atlético Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/28/filipe-luis-sold-back-atletico-madrid-chelsea>
 after just a season at Stamford Bridge.

However, with Rahman already having agreed personal terms for his move to the 
Premier League champions, Augsburg have insisted thatChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> must meet their valuation of the

So far, Chelsea have refused to budge but with a lack of defensive 
reinforcements available to Mourinho, it is anticipated that a compromise may 
be found.
