The thin veneer of civility between Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> and Donald Trump has a few 
more cracks in it, after Trump tweeted to accuse Obama of throwing up 
“inflammatory” roadblocks during the presidential transition of power.

Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and 
roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!

The president-elect is on the social media platform most mornings to tweet 
something accusatory. But since his positive post-election meeting with Obama, 
he has largely stayed away from a negative personal tone against the president.

Trump didn’t specify exactly what Obama has done or said to anger him this 
time, although just a few days agoObama said he is “confident” he would have 
won a third term 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/26/barack-obama-third-term-president>
 – a statement Trump immediately disagreed with.

President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should 
say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.

Trump also said on Wednesday morning that Israel was being treated with “total 
disdain and disrespect” by the United Nations, after a UN vote (the United 
States abstained from the vote) declared West Bank settlements by Israel 
illegal. Israeli officials have accused the Obama administration of creating 
and pushing the resolution.

When asked to clarify what Trump means by saying Obama is not allowing for a 
smooth transition, press secretary Sean Spicer said on a media call that the 
tweets “speak for themselves”.

On Monday, Spicer said in an interview 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/will-donald-trump-tweet-as-president-sean-spicer-232975>
 that Trump’s use of Twitter to communicate will be “a really exciting part of 
the job”.

Obama has long said that George W Bush had ensured a smooth transition when he 
took office in 2009, and he was insistent that his successor receive the same 
treatment.

Immediately after the election, Obama invited Trump and his wife, Melania, to 
the White House to meet with him and the First Lady. It created a (very forced) 
friendly rapport of sorts between the two men, with a clearly strained Obama 
attempting to be as welcoming and hospitable as possible. The planned 15-minute 
meetingturned into a 90-minute private meeting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/barack-obama-donald-trump-white-house-meeting-transition>
, with Trump afterwards declaring the president a “good man”.


“I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, 
including counsel. He explained some of the difficulties, some of the 
high-flying assets and some of the really great things that have been 
achieved,” said Trump.

A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good 
meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!

“I want to emphasize to you, Mr President-elect, that we now are going to do 
everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country 
succeeds,” said Obama during their White House meeting on 10 November.
