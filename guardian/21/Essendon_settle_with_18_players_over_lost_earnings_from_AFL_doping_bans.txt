Essendon have agreed to pay settlements to 18 past and present players who 
lost earnings as a result of the AFL club’s supplements saga. Thirty-four past 
and presentEssendon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/essendon> players missed 
the 2016 season after they were banned in January for anti-doping code 
violations arising from the supplements program overseen by controversial 
sports scientist Stephen Dank.

Law firm Slater and Gordon have confirmed the Bombers have reached an 
in-principle agreement with 18 of the players but said the amount of money each 
would receive was confidential.

“These players were innocent participants in the supplements program,” class 
action lawyer Patrick Gordon said. “They were given assurances that all 
supplements they were receiving had been approved from people who they thought 
they could trust.

“No player at any time intended to breach their obligations under the AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> anti-doping code and any such breach 
that occurred was due to the players being misled about the nature of the 
supplements they received.


“They now hope to move on with their lives and careers, both within and 
outside the AFL.”


Gordon said paperwork had been lodged in regards to the settlements, which 
were expected to be formally resolved in coming days. Essendon are expected to 
address the matter at a press conference on Tuesday.

The Bombers last week revealed the supplements debacle had cost them almost 
$10m over the last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/16/essendon-post-98m-loss-in-wake-of-cas-ruling-over-players-doping-bans>
. Essendon said the net additional cost of player compensation claims and legal 
fees was $4.5m.

Additionally, they had to fork out $1.5m for short-term player contracts so 
they could field an AFL team. They also lost $3.1m in reduced gate takings and 
other revenue and took another $806,000 hit as they wrote off assets at their 
old Windy Hill ground.

Stewart Crameri, who now plays for the Western Bulldogs and has been publicly 
linked to Slater and Gordon, is among the 18 players set to receive a 
settlement.
