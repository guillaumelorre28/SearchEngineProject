Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei has recreated the image of drowned 
infant Alan Kurdi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees>
 that in 2015 became the defining symbol of the plight of Syria’s refugees.

For the recreation, Ai lay on a pebbled beach on the Greek island of Lesbos. 
His pose was similar to that of Kurdi’s lifeless body, which washed up on a 
beach near the Turkish town of Bodrum and was captured in a September 2015 
photo.

Ai has been working in a studio on the Greek island as part of several 
projects that engage with the refugee crisis. The island has been akey point of 
entry into the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/07/lesbos-on-verge-of-explosion-as-refugees-crowd-greek-island>
 for thousands of refugees.

According to the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/01/30/chinese-artist-ai-weiwei-poses-as-a-drowned-syrian-refugee-toddler/>
, the image of Ai was taken by photographer Rohit Chawla for the magazine India 
Today and an accompanying exhibition at the India Art Fair. Ai and his team 
were involved in the staging of the image.


Co-owner of the India Art Fair, Sandy Angus told the Washington Post: “It is 
an iconic image because it is very political, human and involves an incredibly 
important artist likeAi Weiwei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei>.


“The image is haunting and represents the whole immigration crisis and the 
hopelessness of the people who have tried to escape their pasts for a better 
future.”

He told the Guardian on Thursday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/27/ai-weiwei-shuts-danish-show-in-protest-at-asylum-seeker-law>
: “My moments with refugees in the past months have been intense. I see 
thousands come daily, children, babies, pregnant women, old ladies, a young boy 
with one arm.

“They come with nothing, barefoot, in such cold, they have to walk across the 
rocky beach. Then you have this news; it made me feel very angry.

“The way I can protest is that I can withdraw my works from that country. It 
is very simple, very symbolic – I cannot co-exist, I cannot stand in front of 
these people, and see these policies. It is a personal act, very simple; an 
artist trying not just to watch events but to act, and I made this decision 
spontaneously.”
