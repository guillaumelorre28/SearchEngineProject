Ndidi, who will wear the No25 shirt, moved to Genk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/krc-genk> from Nathaniel Boys of Lagos 
after impressing during a trial and made his debut in January 2015 as a 
centre-half. He can also play at right-back and has been capped twice by 
Nigeria.

He will join his international team‑mate Ahmed Musa at Leicester and both will 
be available during the Africa Cup of Nations because Nigeria failed to qualify.
