Philip Oltermann provides this translation of Merkel’s remarks. 

There is no point beating about the bush. Today represents a break in Europe’s 
history, a break in the process of European integration.

What the consequences of this decision will be, depends on whether the other 
27 member states will prove to be willing and capable to draw not hasty and 
simplified conclusions from the British vote that would only divideEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> further, but willing and 
capable to analyse the result with calm and level-headedness and make a joint 
decision on that basis. In doing so, we should consider the following.

First, Europe is multifaceted. Expectations towards the European Union are as 
varied as the people of Europe. More and more often we see ourselves confronted 
with fundamental doubts about the current direction of European integration. 
That doesn’t just apply to Britain, but in various forms to all member states. 
We therefore have to ensure that citizens get a concrete sense of how the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> contributes to improving 
their own personal lives. That’s a task for the EU institutions as well as the 
member states.

Secondly, in a world which is growing ever more closely intertwined, 
challenges are too great for individual states to manage on their own. The 
European Union is one of the biggest markets in the world. It has to act as an 
engaged global partner, shaping and wanting to shape globalisation. It is a 
unique community of solidarity and values. It is our guarantor of peace, wealth 
and stability. Only by working together will we able to assert our democratic 
and constitutional values, as well as our economic, social, ecological and 
foreign policy interests in the global race.

Thirdly, we have to draw our conclusions from the outcome of the British 
referendum with history in our minds. Even if it is hard to imagine now we 
should remember, especially in these hours, that the idea of the European Union 
is an idea of peace. After centuries of terrible bloodshed, the founders of the 
European Union found a joint path towards reconciliation and peace, culminating 
in the treaties of Rome signed almost sixty years ago. That is and continues to 
be anything but a given in the future. We are seeing a world in turmoil: in 
Europe too we feel the consequences of oppression, crises, conflicts and wars 
in our immediate vicinity that have cost many lives and uprooted many others 
from their home countries.

Germany has a special interest in and a special responsibility for the 
European Union to succeed. That is why I have invited the president of the 
European Council, Donald Tusk, the French president François Hollande and the 
Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi for talks in Berlin on Monday. On Tuesday 
and Wednesday we will continue talks with other member states at the summit in 
Brussels.

In the European treaties there is a clear set and orderly procedure for member 
states who want to leave the European Union. This procedure involves several 
years of negotiations, at the end of which we will have established the details 
of Britain’s departure from the European Union. While the negotiations are 
ongoing, Britain remains a member of the EU. All the rights and commitments 
that pertain to this membership are to be respected and fulfilled until the 
actual exit. This applies to both sides.

Our goal should be to shape the future relationship between Britain and the 
European Union in a close and fair manner. The German government will pay 
special attention to the interests of German citizens and the German economy in 
that process.

Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is strong enough to find the right 
answers to today’s events. Myself and the entire government are fully committed 
to that.

 Angela Merkel Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP 
Associated Press has more on German chancellor Angela Merkel’s reaction. She 
said theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> was strong enough 
to find the “right answers” to Britain’s vote to leave.

Merkel said that Germany had a “special interest” and a “special 
responsibility” in European unity succeeding. She said she had invited the EU 
president, Donald Tusk, the French president, François Hollande, and the 
Italian PM, Matteo Renzi, to a meeting in Berlin on Monday before a scheduled 
EU summit.

Merkel told reporters in Berlin that Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> shouldn’t draw “quick and 
simple conclusions” from the referendum that would only create further 
divisions.

She voiced “great regret” at the British decision to leave the EU and said the 
bloc must aim for a “close” future relationship with Britain. She emphasised 
that the country remains an EU member with “all rights and obligations” on both 
sides until negotiations are complete.

Sir David Attenborough has expressed his sadness at the prospects for 
Britain’s environment following the country’s vote to leave.

The country’s top naturalist has previously ruled out commenting on the 
referendum in any form,despite focus groups saying the wildlife broadcaster was 
among the most trusted public figures on the issue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/eu-referendum-whats-on-the-minds-of-voters>
.


But in his first intervention on the referendum, when asked about the 
potential impact of Brexit on the environment Attenborough told the Guardian: 
“That is sad. Swallows aren’t members of the union, and migrant birds and so 
on.”

Throughout the campaign, environmentalists have been largely united in 
proclaiming the environmental protections guaranteed by EU membership. 
Attenborough said he was hopeful that international conservation efforts would 
not be hampered by the UK leaving the EU. “One just hopes that collaboration on 
these issues, conservation issues, will transcend political divisions,” he said.

He said he hoped the EU’s two key protections for wildlife, the birds and 
habitats directive, would stay in UK law. “I hope so, and I hope it may be 
possible for us to do so,” he said.

Corbyn faces no confidence motion

Anushka Asthana

Jeremy Corbyn faces a no confidence motion in his leadership from two of his 
MPs.

Labour MPs Margaret Hodge and Ann Coffey have sent a letter to John Cryer, 
chair of the parliamentaryLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
party, submitting the motion.


The letter calls for a discussion at the next meeting of the PLP on Monday. 
The ballot has no formal constitutional force, but would be a significant 
expression of the lack of confidence of Labour MPs in their leader.

It is up to Cryer to decide whether or not to accept the motion and allow it 
to be debated.

If it is accepted, it would be followed by a secret ballot of Labour MPs on 
Tuesday. It would require a simple majority of MPs to support the motion for it 
to be passed.

Here’s the text: 


We wish to submit a motion for urgent consideration by the Parliamentary 
Labour Party as follows:

“That this PLP has no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the 
Parliamentary Labour Party.”

Proposed by: Rt Hon Dame Margaret Hodge MP

Seconded by: Ann Coffey MP

More on joint efforts by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and the 
London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to secure some kind of referendum opt-out for 
Scotland and London.

Here’s what Sturgeon said:

I have made it clear to the prime minister this morning that the Scottish 
government must be fully and directly involved in any and all decisions about 
the next steps that the UK government intends to take.

We will also be seeking direct discussions with the EU institutions and its 
member states including the earliest possible meeting with the President of the 
European Commission.

I also be communicated over the weekend with each EU member state to make 
clear that Scotland has voted to stay in the EU and I intend to discussion all 
options for doing so.

I have also spoken this morning with [London] mayor Sadiq Khan and he is clear 
that he shares this objective for London, so there is clear common cause 
between us.

Khan’s office confirmed that he had talked to Sturgeon about the need for 
Scotland and London to be involved in Brexit negotiations.

Spokesman for @SadiqKhan <https://twitter.com/SadiqKhan> confirms he has

What we know so far

Mark Tran

 * David Cameron has resigned after Britain took the momentous decision to 
ditch the EU with the leave campaign prevailing 52% to 48% after a bitter 
campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union>
. Cameron said a new prime minister should be in place by the start of the 
Conservative party conference in October. He said his successor should decide 
when to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, which begins the two-year 
process of negotiating a new trade relationship with the UK’s former partners. 
“I will do everything I can as prime minister to steady the ship over the 
coming weeks and months, but I don’t think it would be right for me to try to 
be the captain that steers our country to its next destination,” said Cameron, 
his voice breaking up at the end of his statement. 
 * Cameron’s announcement is expected to trigger a battle for the Conservative 
leadership. Obvious candidates include Boris Johnson, the star of the leave 
campaign, and the home secretary Theresa May, who was ostensibly for remain but 
was barely visible in the referendum campaign. In his first comments, Johnson 
said he agreed with Cameron’s decision not to immediately invoke article 50. He 
said the EU is no longer right for this country and claimed young people could 
look forward to a prosperous future if we take back control from the EU. 
 * Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has said a second independence 
referendum is “highly likely”. She wants to explore all options to stay in the 
EU. 
 * The win for leave wreaked havoc on the markets. Shares plunged and the 
pound plummeted to a 31-year low as panicked traders reacted to the prospect of 
recession amid months of market turmoil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/ftse-100-and-sterling-plunge-on-brexit-panic>
. TheFTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 tumbled 530 points, 
or 8.4%, within the first few minutes of trading. That mirrored sharp losses 
for the pound overnight as investors sold sterling on the back of growing 
worries about the UK’s economic outlook. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank 
of England, sought to reassure the markets by declaring that the Bank will “not 
hesitate” to steady the markets. He said it will make an extra £250bn available 
to the banks. His comments steadied the markets a little as FTSE losses were at 
4.8% compared with almost double that at the open. More than £100bn was wiped 
off the FTSE. The European Central Bank promised to provide extra liquidity to 
protect the financial world. 
 * Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the EU’s 27 
remaining members will meet to assess its future next week without Britain. 
Tusk said he had spoken to EU leaders in the past few days and the union had 
been prepared for the result and was determined to keep its unity. “There is no 
hiding the fact that we wanted a different outcome of yesterday’s referendum,” 
he said in Brussels, “especially for the UK. It is a historic moment, but not a 
moment for hysterical reactions.” 
 * Donald Trump who is visiting his golf courses in Scotland hailed the leave 
victory as a “great thing” that the people of the UK have “taken back their 
country” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk>
. 
 * Within the Labour party, the knives are out for Jeremy Corbyn. Tony Blair 
turned on Corbyn for a “lukewarm” and backward-lookingLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> campaign. Former Labour minister 
and EU commissionerLord (Peter) Mandelson said the referendum campaign showed 
Corbyn “can’t cut it” as leader.The PoliticsHome website reported that least 55 
Labour MPs will put their name to a letter calling for Corbyn to quit next week

Boris Johnson: no need for haste over Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/boris-johnson-no-need-for-haste-in-leaving-eu-video>
Here’s the full text of Boris Johnson’s comments:

I want to begin by paying tribute to David Cameron who has spoken earlier from 
Downing Street, and I know I speak for Michael when I saw how sad I am that he 
has decided to step down but obviously I respect that decision. I have known
David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> for a very 
long time, and I believe he has been one of the most extraordinary politicians 
of our age. A brave and principled man, who has given superb leadership of his 
party and his country for many years.

Delivering one nation Conservative government, making this country the most 
dynamic economy in Europe and with his own brand of compassionate Conservative 
that rightly earned his party the first majority government for decades. It was 
his bravery that gave this country the first referendum on theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> for 43 years. Today I think all of us 
politicians need to thank the British people for the way they have been doing 
ou job for us. They hire us to deal with the hard questions and this year we 
gave them one of the biggest and toughest questions of all.

Some people are now saying that was wrong and that people should never have 
been asked in that way. I disagree, it was entirely right and inevitable and 
there is no way of dealing with a decision on this scale except by putting it 
to the people.

Because in the end this decision is about the people, the right of people in 
this country to settle their own destiny. The very principles of our democracy, 
the rights of all of us to elect and remove the people who make the key 
decisions in their lives. And I think that the electorate have searched in 
their hearts and answered as best they can in a poll the scale the like of 
which we have never seen before in this country. They have decided it is time 
to vote to take back control from a EU that has become too opaque and not 
accountable enough to the people it is meant to serve.

In voting to leave the EU, it is vital to stress there is no need for haste, 
and as the prime minister has said, nothing will change in the short term 
except how to give effect to the will of the people and to extracate this 
country from the supranational system. There is no need to invoke article 50.

And to those who may be anxious both at home and abroad, this does not mean 
that the United Kingdom will be in anyway less united, it does not mean it will 
be any less European. I want to speak directly to the millions of people who 
did not vote for this outcome, especially young people who may feel that this 
decision involves somehow pulling up the drawbridge because i think the very 
opposite is true.

We cannot turn our backs on Europe we are part of Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, our children and our 
grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans, travelling 
to the continent, understanding the languages and the cultures that make up our 
common European civilisation, continuing to interact with the peoples of other 
countries in a way that is open and friendly and outward looking. And I want to 
reassure everyone Britain will continue to be a great European power, leading 
discussions on defence and foreign policy and the work that goes on to make our 
world safer.

But there is simply no need in the 21st century to be part of a federal 
government in Brussels that is imitated nowhere else on Earth. It was a noble 
idea for its time but it is no longer right for this country. It is the essence 
of our case that young people in this country can look forward to a more secure 
and more prosperous future, if we take back the democratic control which is the 
foundation of our economic prosperity. We have a glorious opportunity, to pass 
our laws and set our taxes entirely according to the needs of the UK, we can 
control our borders in a way that is not discriminatory but fair and balanced 
and take the wind out of the sails of the extremists and those who would play 
politics with immigration.

Above all we can find our voice in the world again, a voice commensurate with 
the fifth biggest economy on earth. Powerful, liberal, humane, an extraordinary 
force for good in the world. The most precious thing this country has given the 
world is the ide aof parliamentary democracy. Yesterday, I beleive the British 
people have spoken up for democracy in Britain and across Europe and we can be 
proud of the result.

The sun in shining in Clacton, Essex, and the mood in Ukip’s heartland is just 
as upbeat.

In the seaside town’s centre, Rob Blyth, 53, said he was delighted by the vote.

“I don’t want to sound racist, but I think there are just too many people 
coming into the country. I moved out here from Dagenham four years ago, because 
Dagenham was looking like a foreign country.”

Blyth, who works on the London Underground, said that many people had moved 
out to Clacton from London, but “there was nowhere further for them to go now”.

“Dagenham just became a dumping ground,” said Blyth. “They weren’t doing it to 
Surrey, just Dagenham. People have had enough.”

Joe Liff, 67, said he was very pleased by the result of the vote. 

He was also concerned about immigration. 

“The thing is, it’s like if you’ve got the Hilton hotel and a greasy spoon 
caff,” said the pensioner. “We’re the Hilton and Bulgaria’s the greasy spoon, 
so of course they all want to come here.”

Jackie Collins, 53, housewife said she was “shocked” the country had voted for 
Brexit.

“I didn’t think we’d actually do it. I think that’s how a lot of people feel 
shocked by it. I’m pleased though, I’m pleased for Britain.”

Watching her grandchildren play in the fountains, she said it was important 
for their generation.

“I think it’s going to be tough for a while. I haven’t got a clue what happens 
next,” she said. “I did it for my grandchildren. I think my age range will 
suffer, but it will be better for them.”

The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has rejected 
suggestions that Brexit will trigger the end of theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. Asked whether British withdrawal would 
bring the end of the EU, he gave a one-word answer: “No.” Officials at the 
press conference burst into applause.

Juncker stressed the British government must start negotiations to terminate 
Britain’s relationship with the EU “as soon as possible, however painful that 
process might be”. But it is not obvious that the EU has any legal means to 
compel the UK to start negotiations, under the article 50 procedure.

“I expect France and Germany to take a very clear position, as it is clear and 
obvious to everyone that this situation of unertainty that we are in now cannot 
last too long. We have to speed things up.”

The veteran EU leader was speaking after a meeting with the EU’s other three 
presidents: Donald Tusk of the European council, Martin Schulz of the European 
parliament and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who is chairing the EU’s 
rotating presidency.

Juncker said he was “personally sad” about the UK’s decision to leave, but 
insistedEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> would stand 
strong and united.

“This is an unprecedented situation but we are united in our response. We will 
stand strong and uphold the EU’s core values of promoting peace and the 
well-being of its peoples.”

Nicola Sturgeon is now giving her reaction. She says the vote in favour in 
Scotland was “significant” as it came after positive case for immigration. The 
vote is a sign of divergence between Scotland and the rest of the UK, she adds.

She says taking the UK out of the EU against the will of Scots is 
“democratically unacceptable”.

Brexit represents a material change to the terms under which Scotland voted 
against independence.

Michael Gove <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> also pays 
tribute to Cameron, who he says should be remembered as a “great prime 
minister”.

He says the vote to leave is the start to a process. Officials and diplomats 
can start to scope out the best possible terms for Britain, Gove says.

Britain is embarking on a new chapter that is inline with its traditions of 
openness and tolerance, Gove insists.

Our liberal democratic tradition are being renewed, Gove adds. 

“Britain can move forward in the spirit of the warm, humane and generous 
values that are the best of Britain,” Gove says.

.
  German chancellor Angela Merkel reacts on British vote to leave EU.

Philip Oltermann provides this translation of Merkel’s remarks. 

There is no point beating about the bush. Today represents a break in Europe’s 
history, a break in the process of European integration.

What the consequences of this decision will be, depends on whether the other 
27 member states will prove to be willing and capable to draw not hasty and 
simplified conclusions from the British vote that would only divideEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> further, but willing and 
capable to analyse the result with calm and level-headedness and make a joint 
decision on that basis. In doing so, we should consider the following.

First, Europe is multifaceted. Expectations towards the European Union are as 
varied as the people of Europe. More and more often we see ourselves confronted 
with fundamental doubts about the current direction of European integration. 
That doesn’t just apply to Britain, but in various forms to all member states. 
We therefore have to ensure that citizens get a concrete sense of how the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> contributes to improving 
their own personal lives. That’s a task for the EU institutions as well as the 
member states.

Secondly, in a world which is growing ever more closely intertwined, 
challenges are too great for individual states to manage on their own. The 
European Union is one of the biggest markets in the world. It has to act as an 
engaged global partner, shaping and wanting to shape globalisation. It is a 
unique community of solidarity and values. It is our guarantor of peace, wealth 
and stability. Only by working together will we able to assert our democratic 
and constitutional values, as well as our economic, social, ecological and 
foreign policy interests in the global race.

Thirdly, we have to draw our conclusions from the outcome of the British 
referendum with history in our minds. Even if it is hard to imagine now we 
should remember, especially in these hours, that the idea of the European Union 
is an idea of peace. After centuries of terrible bloodshed, the founders of the 
European Union found a joint path towards reconciliation and peace, culminating 
in the treaties of Rome signed almost sixty years ago. That is and continues to 
be anything but a given in the future. We are seeing a world in turmoil: in 
Europe too we feel the consequences of oppression, crises, conflicts and wars 
in our immediate vicinity that have cost many lives and uprooted many others 
from their home countries.

Germany has a special interest in and a special responsibility for the 
European Union to succeed. That is why I have invited the president of the 
European Council, Donald Tusk, the French president François Hollande and the 
Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi for talks in Berlin on Monday. On Tuesday 
and Wednesday we will continue talks with other member states at the summit in 
Brussels.

In the European treaties there is a clear set and orderly procedure for member 
states who want to leave the European Union. This procedure involves several 
years of negotiations, at the end of which we will have established the details 
of Britain’s departure from the European Union. While the negotiations are 
ongoing, Britain remains a member of the EU. All the rights and commitments 
that pertain to this membership are to be respected and fulfilled until the 
actual exit. This applies to both sides.

Our goal should be to shape the future relationship between Britain and the 
European Union in a close and fair manner. The German government will pay 
special attention to the interests of German citizens and the German economy in 
that process.

Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is strong enough to find the right 
answers to today’s events. Myself and the entire government are fully committed 
to that.
  Angela Merkel Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP 
Associated Press has more on German chancellor Angela Merkel’s reaction. She 
said theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> was strong enough 
to find the “right answers” to Britain’s vote to leave.

Merkel said that Germany had a “special interest” and a “special 
responsibility” in European unity succeeding. She said she had invited the EU 
president, Donald Tusk, the French president, François Hollande, and the 
Italian PM, Matteo Renzi, to a meeting in Berlin on Monday before a scheduled 
EU summit.

Merkel told reporters in Berlin that Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> shouldn’t draw “quick and 
simple conclusions” from the referendum that would only create further 
divisions.

She voiced “great regret” at the British decision to leave the EU and said the 
bloc must aim for a “close” future relationship with Britain. She emphasised 
that the country remains an EU member with “all rights and obligations” on both 
sides until negotiations are complete.

Sir David Attenborough has expressed his sadness at the prospects for 
Britain’s environment following the country’s vote to leave.

The country’s top naturalist has previously ruled out commenting on the 
referendum in any form,despite focus groups saying the wildlife broadcaster was 
among the most trusted public figures on the issue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/eu-referendum-whats-on-the-minds-of-voters>
.


But in his first intervention on the referendum, when asked about the 
potential impact of Brexit on the environment Attenborough told the Guardian: 
“That is sad. Swallows aren’t members of the union, and migrant birds and so 
on.”

Throughout the campaign, environmentalists have been largely united in 
proclaiming the environmental protections guaranteed by EU membership. 
Attenborough said he was hopeful that international conservation efforts would 
not be hampered by the UK leaving the EU. “One just hopes that collaboration on 
these issues, conservation issues, will transcend political divisions,” he said.

He said he hoped the EU’s two key protections for wildlife, the birds and 
habitats directive, would stay in UK law. “I hope so, and I hope it may be 
possible for us to do so,” he said.
 
Jeremy Corbyn faces a no confidence motion in his leadership from two of his 
MPs.

Labour MPs Margaret Hodge and Ann Coffey have sent a letter to John Cryer, 
chair of the parliamentaryLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
party, submitting the motion.


The letter calls for a discussion at the next meeting of the PLP on Monday. 
The ballot has no formal constitutional force, but would be a significant 
expression of the lack of confidence of Labour MPs in their leader.

It is up to Cryer to decide whether or not to accept the motion and allow it 
to be debated.

If it is accepted, it would be followed by a secret ballot of Labour MPs on 
Tuesday. It would require a simple majority of MPs to support the motion for it 
to be passed.

Here’s the text: 


We wish to submit a motion for urgent consideration by the Parliamentary 
Labour Party as follows:

“That this PLP has no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the 
Parliamentary Labour Party.”

Proposed by: Rt Hon Dame Margaret Hodge MP

Seconded by: Ann Coffey MP
 
More on joint efforts by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and the 
London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to secure some kind of referendum opt-out for 
Scotland and London.

Here’s what Sturgeon said:

I have made it clear to the prime minister this morning that the Scottish 
government must be fully and directly involved in any and all decisions about 
the next steps that the UK government intends to take.

We will also be seeking direct discussions with the EU institutions and its 
member states including the earliest possible meeting with the President of the 
European Commission.

I also be communicated over the weekend with each EU member state to make 
clear that Scotland has voted to stay in the EU and I intend to discussion all 
options for doing so.

I have also spoken this morning with [London] mayor Sadiq Khan and he is clear 
that he shares this objective for London, so there is clear common cause 
between us.

Khan’s office confirmed that he had talked to Sturgeon about the need for 
Scotland and London to be involved in Brexit negotiations.

 * David Cameron has resigned after Britain took the momentous decision to 
ditch the EU with the leave campaign prevailing 52% to 48% after a bitter 
campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union>
. Cameron said a new prime minister should be in place by the start of the 
Conservative party conference in October. He said his successor should decide 
when to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, which begins the two-year 
process of negotiating a new trade relationship with the UK’s former partners. 
“I will do everything I can as prime minister to steady the ship over the 
coming weeks and months, but I don’t think it would be right for me to try to 
be the captain that steers our country to its next destination,” said Cameron, 
his voice breaking up at the end of his statement. 
 * Cameron’s announcement is expected to trigger a battle for the Conservative 
leadership. Obvious candidates include Boris Johnson, the star of the leave 
campaign, and the home secretary Theresa May, who was ostensibly for remain but 
was barely visible in the referendum campaign. In his first comments, Johnson 
said he agreed with Cameron’s decision not to immediately invoke article 50. He 
said the EU is no longer right for this country and claimed young people could 
look forward to a prosperous future if we take back control from the EU. 
 * Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has said a second independence 
referendum is “highly likely”. She wants to explore all options to stay in the 
EU. 
 * The win for leave wreaked havoc on the markets. Shares plunged and the 
pound plummeted to a 31-year low as panicked traders reacted to the prospect of 
recession amid months of market turmoil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/ftse-100-and-sterling-plunge-on-brexit-panic>
. TheFTSE <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 100 tumbled 530 points, 
or 8.4%, within the first few minutes of trading. That mirrored sharp losses 
for the pound overnight as investors sold sterling on the back of growing 
worries about the UK’s economic outlook. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank 
of England, sought to reassure the markets by declaring that the Bank will “not 
hesitate” to steady the markets. He said it will make an extra £250bn available 
to the banks. His comments steadied the markets a little as FTSE losses were at 
4.8% compared with almost double that at the open. More than £100bn was wiped 
off the FTSE. The European Central Bank promised to provide extra liquidity to 
protect the financial world. 
 * Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the EU’s 27 
remaining members will meet to assess its future next week without Britain. 
Tusk said he had spoken to EU leaders in the past few days and the union had 
been prepared for the result and was determined to keep its unity. “There is no 
hiding the fact that we wanted a different outcome of yesterday’s referendum,” 
he said in Brussels, “especially for the UK. It is a historic moment, but not a 
moment for hysterical reactions.” 
 * Donald Trump who is visiting his golf courses in Scotland hailed the leave 
victory as a “great thing” that the people of the UK have “taken back their 
country” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk>
. 
 * Within the Labour party, the knives are out for Jeremy Corbyn. Tony Blair 
turned on Corbyn for a “lukewarm” and backward-lookingLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> campaign. Former Labour minister 
and EU commissionerLord (Peter) Mandelson said the referendum campaign showed 
Corbyn “can’t cut it” as leader.The PoliticsHome website reported that least 55 
Labour MPs will put their name to a letter calling for Corbyn to quit next week

 Boris Johnson: no need for haste over Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/boris-johnson-no-need-for-haste-in-leaving-eu-video>
Here’s the full text of Boris Johnson’s comments:

I want to begin by paying tribute to David Cameron who has spoken earlier from 
Downing Street, and I know I speak for Michael when I saw how sad I am that he 
has decided to step down but obviously I respect that decision. I have known
David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> for a very 
long time, and I believe he has been one of the most extraordinary politicians 
of our age. A brave and principled man, who has given superb leadership of his 
party and his country for many years.

Delivering one nation Conservative government, making this country the most 
dynamic economy in Europe and with his own brand of compassionate Conservative 
that rightly earned his party the first majority government for decades. It was 
his bravery that gave this country the first referendum on theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> for 43 years. Today I think all of us 
politicians need to thank the British people for the way they have been doing 
ou job for us. They hire us to deal with the hard questions and this year we 
gave them one of the biggest and toughest questions of all.

Some people are now saying that was wrong and that people should never have 
been asked in that way. I disagree, it was entirely right and inevitable and 
there is no way of dealing with a decision on this scale except by putting it 
to the people.

Because in the end this decision is about the people, the right of people in 
this country to settle their own destiny. The very principles of our democracy, 
the rights of all of us to elect and remove the people who make the key 
decisions in their lives. And I think that the electorate have searched in 
their hearts and answered as best they can in a poll the scale the like of 
which we have never seen before in this country. They have decided it is time 
to vote to take back control from a EU that has become too opaque and not 
accountable enough to the people it is meant to serve.

In voting to leave the EU, it is vital to stress there is no need for haste, 
and as the prime minister has said, nothing will change in the short term 
except how to give effect to the will of the people and to extracate this 
country from the supranational system. There is no need to invoke article 50.

And to those who may be anxious both at home and abroad, this does not mean 
that the United Kingdom will be in anyway less united, it does not mean it will 
be any less European. I want to speak directly to the millions of people who 
did not vote for this outcome, especially young people who may feel that this 
decision involves somehow pulling up the drawbridge because i think the very 
opposite is true.

We cannot turn our backs on Europe we are part of Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, our children and our 
grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans, travelling 
to the continent, understanding the languages and the cultures that make up our 
common European civilisation, continuing to interact with the peoples of other 
countries in a way that is open and friendly and outward looking. And I want to 
reassure everyone Britain will continue to be a great European power, leading 
discussions on defence and foreign policy and the work that goes on to make our 
world safer.

But there is simply no need in the 21st century to be part of a federal 
government in Brussels that is imitated nowhere else on Earth. It was a noble 
idea for its time but it is no longer right for this country. It is the essence 
of our case that young people in this country can look forward to a more secure 
and more prosperous future, if we take back the democratic control which is the 
foundation of our economic prosperity. We have a glorious opportunity, to pass 
our laws and set our taxes entirely according to the needs of the UK, we can 
control our borders in a way that is not discriminatory but fair and balanced 
and take the wind out of the sails of the extremists and those who would play 
politics with immigration.

Above all we can find our voice in the world again, a voice commensurate with 
the fifth biggest economy on earth. Powerful, liberal, humane, an extraordinary 
force for good in the world. The most precious thing this country has given the 
world is the ide aof parliamentary democracy. Yesterday, I beleive the British 
people have spoken up for democracy in Britain and across Europe and we can be 
proud of the result.

The sun in shining in Clacton, Essex, and the mood in Ukip’s heartland is just 
as upbeat.

In the seaside town’s centre, Rob Blyth, 53, said he was delighted by the vote.

“I don’t want to sound racist, but I think there are just too many people 
coming into the country. I moved out here from Dagenham four years ago, because 
Dagenham was looking like a foreign country.”

Blyth, who works on the London Underground, said that many people had moved 
out to Clacton from London, but “there was nowhere further for them to go now”.

“Dagenham just became a dumping ground,” said Blyth. “They weren’t doing it to 
Surrey, just Dagenham. People have had enough.”

Joe Liff, 67, said he was very pleased by the result of the vote. 

He was also concerned about immigration. 

“The thing is, it’s like if you’ve got the Hilton hotel and a greasy spoon 
caff,” said the pensioner. “We’re the Hilton and Bulgaria’s the greasy spoon, 
so of course they all want to come here.”

Jackie Collins, 53, housewife said she was “shocked” the country had voted for 
Brexit.

“I didn’t think we’d actually do it. I think that’s how a lot of people feel 
shocked by it. I’m pleased though, I’m pleased for Britain.”

Watching her grandchildren play in the fountains, she said it was important 
for their generation.

“I think it’s going to be tough for a while. I haven’t got a clue what happens 
next,” she said. “I did it for my grandchildren. I think my age range will 
suffer, but it will be better for them.”
 
The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has rejected 
suggestions that Brexit will trigger the end of theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. Asked whether British withdrawal would 
bring the end of the EU, he gave a one-word answer: “No.” Officials at the 
press conference burst into applause.

Juncker stressed the British government must start negotiations to terminate 
Britain’s relationship with the EU “as soon as possible, however painful that 
process might be”. But it is not obvious that the EU has any legal means to 
compel the UK to start negotiations, under the article 50 procedure.

“I expect France and Germany to take a very clear position, as it is clear and 
obvious to everyone that this situation of unertainty that we are in now cannot 
last too long. We have to speed things up.”

The veteran EU leader was speaking after a meeting with the EU’s other three 
presidents: Donald Tusk of the European council, Martin Schulz of the European 
parliament and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who is chairing the EU’s 
rotating presidency.

Juncker said he was “personally sad” about the UK’s decision to leave, but 
insistedEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> would stand 
strong and united.

“This is an unprecedented situation but we are united in our response. We will 
stand strong and uphold the EU’s core values of promoting peace and the 
well-being of its peoples.”
 
Now it’s German chancellor Angela Merkel’s turn to react. “There is no way 
around it. This is a blow toEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>,” she says.

“What happens in the next days, months, years - will depend on what we, the 
remaining 27 EU nations are able and willing to do.”
 
Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has said: “The British 
people have expressed their wish to leave. We regret this decision but respect 
it.”

Sturgeon says a second independence referendum is “highly likely”. She wants 
to explore all options to stay in the EU.
 
Sturgeon says the option of a second Scottish independence referendum is on 
the table. There are many people who voted against independence who are 
reassessing their decision in the light of vote to leave the EU, Sturgeon says.

She adds: “My priority will be to act in the best interest of Scotland. I’m 
proud of Scotland and how we voted yesterday. We said clearly we don’t want to 
leave theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”
 
Sturgeon says she intends to explore all means possible of maintaining 
Scotland’s place in the EU. She has called for an urgent meeting with the 
president of the European commission.

Sturgeon says she has talked to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who shares her 
views about London’s place in the EU.
 
Nicola Sturgeon is now giving her reaction. She says the vote in favour in 
Scotland was “significant” as it came after positive case for immigration. The 
vote is a sign of divergence between Scotland and the rest of the UK, she adds.

She says taking the UK out of the EU against the will of Scots is 
“democratically unacceptable”.

Brexit represents a material change to the terms under which Scotland voted 
against independence.
 
The president of the EU commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, says there will be no 
re-negotiation on Britain’s membership of the EU.
 
Michael Gove <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> also pays 
tribute to Cameron, who he says should be remembered as a “great prime 
minister”.

He says the vote to leave is the start to a process. Officials and diplomats 
can start to scope out the best possible terms for Britain, Gove says.

Britain is embarking on a new chapter that is inline with its traditions of 
openness and tolerance, Gove insists.

Our liberal democratic tradition are being renewed, Gove adds. 

“Britain can move forward in the spirit of the warm, humane and generous 
values that are the best of Britain,” Gove says.
