 on Wednesday.

“I have enjoyed my time at the club and I am looking forward to the challenges 
of being a Football League manager.”

Feeney, the former Linfield manager, joined the club as assistant manager last 
October and now becomes the Welsh club’s fifth manager in less than a year.

Newport, who are 20th League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball>, are three points 
above the relegation zone and Feeney will take charge of Saturday’s game at 
their fellow strugglers York City.

Feeney said: “I believe we have a committed group of players here, that are 
more than capable of staying clear of the relegation places this season.

“We have showed that we have the quality in this squad to match the best teams 
in this division and now the focus must be on hitting a consistent level of 
performance.

“We have some crucial games coming up, so all of the efforts will be focused 
on preparation for those games and picking up the points we need to help us 
move further away from the bottom two.

Feeney will be assisted by the former Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers 
defender Andy Todd, whom he worked alongside at Linfield.

Feeney, a former Northern Ireland international, added: “He is somebody I know 
very well. His knowledge and experience of the game will be a great help to me 
and the squad.”

Michael Flynn will remain the first-team coach at the club.
