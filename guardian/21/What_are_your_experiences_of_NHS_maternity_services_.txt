In a study of 2,500 women who have given birth since 2014, half were found to 
have experienced at least one “red flag” event such as not getting timely 
access to pain relief due to insufficient staffing levels.

In October data suggested that maternity care at almost three-quarters of local
NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> groups in England needs to 
improve. In total, 209 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were rated, of 
which 144 needed improvement, with 11 registering the greatest need for 
improvement, according to NHS England. Just one group, West Kent, was ranked as 
top performing, while a further 53 were classed as performing well.

It comes amid planned cuts, with government transformation plans leading to 
the closure of maternity units. Campaigners are concerned that this means 
mothersmay be forced to travel miles for care
