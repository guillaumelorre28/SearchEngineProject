At a time of year when the TV schedules are as cold and bleak as a weekend 
break in Albert Square, it was rather lovely to wake up to news of impending 
comfort TV – the return of The Great Comic Relief Bake Off on BBC1. It’s my 
favourite of all theComic Relief 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/comic-relief> TV spin-offs, because 
there truly is nothing that warms the cockles quite like watching celebrities 
being rubbish at baking.

It’s the fourth year we’ve been treated to a Comic Relief/Sport Relief 
Celebrity Bake Off, broadcast over four nights beginning on 11 February. Each 
episode sees four celebrities create the usual three bakes under the watchful 
eye of judges Paul and Mary, before one is crowned starbaker. For some reason 
this year there’s no grand final, where the heat winners compete for the 
overall title. Presumably this is because it’s not actually about winning, but 
demonstrating where you rank on theCelebrity

Like Star In A Reasonably Priced Car, but with sponge.

Last year’s Sport Relief Bake Off was packed with joyous moments, including 
Johnny Vaughan behaving like a Haribo-fuelled hyperactive toddler from start to 
finish, and Michael Ball piping “I love Mary” on to his doughnuts. Pop star 
Jamelia lost the plot, and was reduced to swigging Amaretto out of the bottle 
and (in a novel Bake Off twist) trimming her layer cake with scissors. But it 
was Bonnie Wright (aka Harry Potter’s Ginny Weasley) who shone in the Bake Off 
tent, especially with her utterly wizard sailing regatta showstopper.

Comic Relief Bake Off 2013 featured Jo Brand’s unforgettable Black Forest 
Cake, inexplicably in the shape of Desmond Tutu’s face. Presumably this is the 
moment that the producers knew that Jo was wasted on the judging panel of ITV’s 
dreadful Splash! and lured her over to host the new Bake Off spin-off Extra 
Slice instead.

Like any show where celebrities are trapped in a confined space for a day, 
there is a certain amount of how-useless-am-I camera mugging and slapstick to 
wade through before you get to any actual baking. But Paul and Mary play it 
straight and leave the comedy to Mel and Sue, with a satisfying result that is 
usually a nice balance of giddily flaky and tongue-in-cheek tart.

This year’s celeb line-up is looking like a rather promising recipe – blend 
together a few comedy stalwarts including David Mitchell, Jennifer Saunders, 
Joanna Lumley,Dame Edna Everage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dame-edna-everage> and Victoria Wood, then 
gently fold in the likes of Lulu, Gok Wan, Jonathan Ross, Alexa Chung, 
Strictly’s Abbey Clancy and actor Michael Sheen. Sprinkle in YouTube Star 
Zoella and Radio 1’s Chris Moyles and Jameela Jamil for the young ’uns, then 
garnish with Gordon Brown’s wife, Sarah.

Who knows if this year’s Great Comic Relief Bake Off will rise to the occasion 
or suffer a soggy bottom, but for the first time in celebrity-challenge-TV-show 
history I’ve actually heard of 15 of the 16 contestants. Someone’s going to 
have to help me out with Kayvan Novak, but I’ll take a slice nonetheless.
