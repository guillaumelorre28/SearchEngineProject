The Southern Football League Premier Division side Hitchin hold Barker’s 
registration, though the midfielder has been playing on loan at Langford and 
Codicote.

Hitchin issued a statement on Wednesday announcing they were “terminating 
Alfie Barker’s registration and relationship with the club with immediate 
effect” because of the player’s “irresponsible and anti-social behaviour”.

One of Barker’s messages, sent as Arsenal drew level, said: “atleast you 
didn’t lose your kid.” It was then followed by another tweet reading: “big hype 
just for a disappointment like the 9 months leading up to your childs birth.” 
On Wednesday, Barker issued an apology, writing: “Im sorry for every comment 
made , id

like to apologise to harry arter and his family , for such disgraceful 
comments and im sorry… from the bottom of my heart.”

The Spartan South Midlands League Division One side Codicote later issued a 
statement which labelled Barker’s comments “irresponsible” and said they would 
be terminating their relationship with the player.

Arter has a tattoo on the inside of his right forearm which is dedicated to 
his daughter Renée, who was stillborn on 10 December 2015.

Speaking to the Guardian in December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/08/harry-arter-bournemouth-daughter>
 Arter said: “Every day I think of her. And it’s strange because there are days 
when I feel like a normal person, or how someone who hasn’t lost a baby would 
feel. But then it will just hit you, driving along and suddenly you see 
something that triggers your mind.

“It’s such a weird feeling and one that I don’t mind any more. Even when I’m 
sad I enjoy that feeling.”

The 27-year-old’s fiancee Rachel is pregnant and due to give birth to a girl 
in February.
