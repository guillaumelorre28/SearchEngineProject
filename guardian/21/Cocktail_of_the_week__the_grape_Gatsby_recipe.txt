One of my all-time favourites, and a great substitute for gin and tonic: 
invigorating and fragrant. Serves one.

6 white grapes
4 sprigs fresh marjoram, 3 picked 
50ml gin
20ml lemon juice, plus 1 slice to garnish
20ml sugar syrup
20ml egg white
Soda, to top

Muddle the grapes and marjoram in a shaker, add the gin, juice, syrup and egg, 
and shake hard over ice for four seconds. Strain, shake again without ice, then 
double strain into a highball glass filled with ice. Top with soda, and garnish 
with the remaining marjoram sprig and a lemon slice.
