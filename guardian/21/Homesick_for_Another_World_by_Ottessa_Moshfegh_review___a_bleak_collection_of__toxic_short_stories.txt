These cynical tales of toxic masculinity probably won’t appeal to anyone who 
found Ottessa Moshfegh’s Booker-shortlisted debutEileen boring or repulsive, 
and might even give her admirers pause. With settings from China to Hollywood 
(where Moshfegh lives), they attack “swipe-left” misogyny while at the same 
time exploiting its gamey tang. “She wasn’t as fat as other women I’ve seen … 
but I hadn’t found her attractive for years,” says a widower of his wife. The 
theme of male entitlement is occasionally played for laughs - someone bankrupts 
himself buying used furniture in the belief it will help him seduce a vintage 
upcycler - but more often it’s just creepy: in Mr Wu, a violent fantasist plots 
how to snare the woman he’s eyeing from afar. Best in small doses, the 
collection as a whole leaves you wondering if Moshfegh’s bleak vision is 
already at risk of congealing into an affectation.
