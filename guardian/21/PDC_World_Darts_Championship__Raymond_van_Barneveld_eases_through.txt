With his opponent producing a three-dart average of only 90.08, the 2007 
winner, Van Barneveld, was able to cruise to victory, dropping only two legs in 
the process. A 156 checkout in a 12-dart leg set the No12 seed from the 
Netherlands on his way during the first set and the tournament debutant Green 
never looked like getting on terms.

On a night without a notable upset, Australia’s Simon Whitlock beat Dragutin 
Horvat – who had overcome Boris Koltsov 2-1 in a qualifier earlier in the 
evening – 3-0. The 2010 runner-up, Whitlock, never looked like dropping a set 
against his German opponent and produced the moment of the night as he hit the 
bullseye to complete a 170 checkout in the third set.

Brendan Dolan overcame Christian Kist 3-1 in the most keenly contested game of 
the evening. Dolan averaged more than 100 as he took the first set 3-0 but the 
Dutchman responded by taking the second without dropping a leg.

However, the Northern Irishman responded to win the next two sets and progress 
to the last 32.
