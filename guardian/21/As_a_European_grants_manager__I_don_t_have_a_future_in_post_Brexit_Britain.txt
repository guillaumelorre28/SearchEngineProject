Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

I work as a European grants manager. My position, although probably OK for the 
next couple of years, doesn’t have a future in post-Brexit Britain. To add to 
this, I don’t particularly enjoy the job and it isn’t a career I would have 
chosen. I did an arts degree and took temping work in the public sector to pay 
the bills alongside the unpaid or poorly paid work I was doing for a small 
theatre company.

Nearly 10 years later, I feel stuck in this line of work but my field is 
drying up fast and will probably end as our ties with the EU are severed. Along 
the way, I have had experience in project management, financial planning, 
communication, training, events and marketing, but transferable skills seem to 
be a thing of the past and the creative sector I long to work in seems to be a 
tightly guarded door.

Taking a pay cut isn’t viable with my current mortgage payments and although I 
have looked into getting some career coaching, the costs are out of my reach 
and the results seem to be hit and miss.
