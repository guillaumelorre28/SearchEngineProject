"There's cobras in the mosh pit, finally we lost it, everyday is brutal, now 
we're being watched byGoogle <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google>."

There are several lessons to be learned from the lyrics of Kasabian's new 
single 'eez-eh', including not venturing down the front at one of their gigs 
without a snake hook or trained mongoose to hand.

The suggestion that we're being watched by Google is unlikely to come as a 
startling revelation to anyone aware of the company's advertising-based 
business model. It's a relatively rare example of this being addressed in song.

However, Google isn't a stranger to popular music: whether it's backing up 
brags from rappers, turning up as an aid to modern romance, or directing fans 
to Verne Troyer's post-Austin-Powers post-clothed-on-camera career.

Here are some prominent examples of how musicians are addressing the internet 
giant:

The 'We Knew We Were Being Watched By Google Before You Did, Kasabian' Angle

M.I.A. got in early with 2010's The Message, with its nagging refrain of 
"Connected to the Google / Connected to the government", managing to foreshadow 
Edward Snowden's NSA revelations by three years.

As a bonus, blending it with the traditional "head bone connects to the neck 
bone" song offers potential for future digital privacy lessons in primary 
schools:

Pincers widened the argument to include one of Google's biggest rivals in the 
technology industry, albeit like an online commenter switching sides midway 
through their thought: "Internet is the new Eden / Your thoughts are Apple's, 
your thoughts are Apple's / Google is your God, his hand the cursor":

The 'Google as Romantic / Stalking Aid' angle

Once upon a time, blind dates really were blind: until the person turned up, 
you'd have no idea what they were like. Nowadays, of course, you'd just search 
for them on Google and Facebook. Pop culture has taken notice of search 
technology's role in modern romance:

"I Google you / Late at night when I don't know what to do / And I'm pleased 
your name is practically unique / It's only you and a would-be pHD in 
Chesapeake" sang Neil Gaiman in I Google You, a song written with his other half
Amanda Palmer <https://www.theguardian.com/music/amanda-palmer> (31.8m results 
in a Google search, if you're wondering):

On a more sexual-safety tip, Garfunkel and Oates (no, not that Garfunkel or 
that Oates – although that's quite a thought) suggested in their song Google 
that"Everybody Googles each other / Everybody does their Facebook research / 
It's how we get to know one another / To make sure that we don't get raped":

The 'Seriously, You Can Answer That Question Yourself With a Search Engine, 
Stop Bothering me' Angle

When someone asks you an easy question, the ideal passive-aggressive response 
is to send them a link to Let Me Google That For You. Or you can write a song, 
of course.

Perhaps not quite as rudely as Taryn Southern's Just Google That Shit, mind. 
"When you need to know something that you don't already know / Don't ask me for 
the answer just go / And Google that shit, yo! Google that shit / Google that 
shit, don't ask me bitch":

Although Taryn isn't the only musician driven to potty-mouthed rage at 
people's inability to use a simple search engine."If you really want to know 
something you'll look it up," suggested The Acacia Strain in their song Cthulhu.

"If you really want to know something you'll do the fucking research / Google, 
Youtube, W dot something / The future is at your finger tips".And while the 
advice doesn't kick in until a minute into this video, you really won't want to 
miss the build-up:

The 'I'm Quite Famous, Look, You Can Even FIND ME ON A SEARCH ENGINE' Angle

From Ice Cube <https://www.theguardian.com/music/icecube> advising potential 
romantic conquests to "Google me bitch" in Urbanian to Method Man & Redman's "
Ain't with the tomfoolery, Meth, if you don't know that / I'm a bet on what to 
do with me, yet, go ahead and Google me" on I'm Dope Nigga, there's a 
longstanding tradition of Google as reputation-prover.

Hats off to Kitty Pryde, too, for combining two Google services AND an 
inventive rhyme in Smiledog.jpg:"I'm the kitten kaboodle and now I'm all over 
Google / And I am very Youtubeable":

The 'You Probably Shouldn't Google Yourself If You're Famous' Angle

If you're young, female and making music, there are plenty of trolls out there 
putting you down. Best not search for your own name, then.

“I get tired and upset / And I'm trying to care a little less / When I Google 
I only get depressed / I was taught to dodge those issues” explained Eliza

The 'I Know Google's Business Has Now Diversified Far Beyond Just A Search

buzz bigger than Google Earth," he explains in Top of the World:
