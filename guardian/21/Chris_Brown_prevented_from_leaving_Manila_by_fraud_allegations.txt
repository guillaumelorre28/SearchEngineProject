Grammy award-winning singer Chris Brown’s departure from Manila was delayed on 
Wednesday because of fraud allegations against him and his promoter for a 
cancelled concert last New Year’s Eve.

The recording artist, who performed at a packed concert on Tuesday night in 
Manila, was prevented from leaving on a private plane on Wednesday pending 
clearance by the Bureau of Immigration.

The religious group that owns the New Year’s Eve concert venue petitioned the 
Department of Justice for help prosecuting Brown. It was not immediately clear 
whether a formal complaint was filed.

Bureau of Immigration spokeswoman Elaine Tan said Brown and his promoter, John 
Michael Pio Roda, were placed on the bureau’s “lookout bulletin” on the 
instruction of the Department of Justice.

 Tan said a lookout bulletin was not on its own a bar to departure, unlike a 
hold departure order.

She said the justice department order directs the bureau to “take prudent 
steps to verify on the status of the criminal case against the subjects”.

“If the concerned agency raises no objection to the departure, then we will 
allow the subject to leave,” Tan said.

The singer cancelled a New Year’s Eve concert at the 55,000-seat Philippine 
Arena at the last minute, reportedly because he lost his passport the day 
before the scheduled event.

The legal counsel of the religious group Iglesia ni Cristo and its Maligaya 
Development Corporation (MDC), which manages the Philippine Arena, wrote on 
Tuesday to the justice secretary, Leila de Lima, to ask for assistance in 
prosecuting the criminal complaint of fraud that the MDC is filing against 
Brown and Pio Roda.

The letter said that after making representations that Brown would perform at 
the concert, and after having fully paid for the two men’s services, Brown 
failed to appear and perform at the concert, to the damage and prejudice of MDC.
