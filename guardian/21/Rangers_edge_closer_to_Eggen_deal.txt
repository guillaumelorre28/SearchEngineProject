Alaves <https://www.theguardian.com/football/alaves> defender Dan Eggen could 
still be on his way to Rangers after the Spanish club dropped demands for a 
transfer fee in favour of a friendly against the Glasgow club.

Rangers manager Alex McLeish withdrew from the deal for the Norwegian earlier 
this week over Alaves' demands for a fee.

But the Spaniards insist the deal can now be concluded for the player, who 
impressed during the winter break trip to Dubai.

"The deal is done as far as we are concerned and it's up to the player to 
agree personal terms with Rangers," said an Alaves spokesman.

"We have removed the demands of £200,000 for the player and, in return, 
Rangers have agreed to play a friendly against us in the summer.

"From our point of view," he told the Scottish Sun, "the player is now free to 
leave."

However, Rangers' hopes of taking full-back Jerome Bonnissel from Bordeaux 
have hit a snag after the French club asked for a fee - believed to be £300,000 
- for the 29-year-old.

"Jerome has told me that he wants to go to Glasgow and we won't stand in his 
way as long as Rangers can agree a fee with ourselves," said Bordeaux coach 
Elie Baup, speaking in the Daily Express.

"He still has six months left on his contract and we will not be letting him 
leave the club for nothing before then.

"If Rangers want to offer him a pre-contract that is up to them but, unless 
they meet our asking price, he won't be going anywhere - especially not on 
loan."
