Well, if the entire of Europe is writing you off, your two main rivals are 
snapping at your heels like sharks and you’re facing a total collapse in the 
league, you may as well go out and beat Deportivo 8-0 to let everyone know 
quite how wrong they are. Suarez was sensational - three assists and a 
hat-trick. Wow.

Peep, peep!

There’s just time for Suarez to whistle a shot over the bar, before the 
referee blows the final whistle on the dot of 90 minutes, putting the home side 
out of their misery without a second of injury time.

89 min: Neymar attempts to lift the ball over the Deportivo defence and 
Sidnei, for about the first time in the match, decides to track the runner - 
Messi, in this case - and shepherds him out of play. Deportivo have been awful 
in the second half but could have had goals in the first.

86 min: On the bench, Barcelona’s substitutes are asking what the score is in 
Bilbao. 1-0, they’re told, to Atlético. And despite the fact their side are 8-0 
up and having a ball, Barcelona’s subs look tense and taut on the bench, 
frustrated that they’ve let themselves get in this position.

GOAL! Deportivo 0-8 Barcelona (Neymar, 80 min)

Messi to Saurez, Suarez across the box to Neymar and, cantering across the 
area, the Brazilian smashes the ball home. Imagine being Real Madrid in the 
changing room now thinking they’ve got to match it.

GOAL! Deportivo 0-7 Barcelona (Bartra, 78 min)

This is getting silly, Bartra, the central defender, simply runs the ball from 
the centre circle right through the middle of the Deportivo defence and slides 
the ball home from 15 yards. Ridiculously good goal, ridiculously poor 
defending.

76 min: The goals might come at the other end, that said. Laure is again free 
up the right and again crosses well. This time he finds Gutierrez, who heads 
over from not very far out at all. Depotivo could very easily have four, if not 
five goals. Barcelona’s front three (well, maybe not Neymar) might be back on 
track, but their defence isn’t.

74 min: This isn’t over yet by a long chalk, and it’s telling that Luis 
Enrique has used all his substitutions (having used none against Valencia) but 
left his three frontmen on. He’s keen to make a statement here.

69 min: Lucas misses a sitter. Laure, unmarked on the right wing, pings in a 
great cross to the middle and finds the striker alone in the middle. From five 
yards, he manages to knock the ball high over the bar. Probably wouldn’t have 
changed the way the game is going but still.

GOAL! Deportivo 0-5 Barcelona (Suarez, 63)

A long ball is launched into the Depor box and Neymar is on the end of it. He 
runs rapidly into the box and with the goal at his mercy … passes to Suarez 
when he could have scored himself. Suarez has one shot, which Laure blocks, 
then another which goes into the back of the net.

ball wide then cross. It’s made them look a touch more threatening in the last

59 min: Lucas, by far Deportivo’s most threatening player, thwacks a fierce 
shot at theBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> goal from 
12 yards or so. Bravo makes another good stop, his palms stinging as though 
they’ve been flayed and dipped in Deep Heat no doubt.

“I’ve come to this late, but from what I can see Depor seem to be taking their 
duties as hosts exceptionally seriously,” writes Charles Antaki. “I don’t think 
I’ve seen more generosity on a football pitch all season. Are they resting for 
some other event coming up?

58 min: Substitution o’clock. The central defender Navarro is hoiked by 
Deportivo and is replaced by Fayçal Fajr, an attacking, creative midfielder. 
Yet to see how they’re going to reshuffle that. Next, Cani jogs off for Fede 
Cartabia. ForBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>,

56 min: A quick corner from Deportivo catches the referee off guard but not 
Barcelona. They whizz the ball around the edge of theBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> box, before attempting to play 
a Messi-esque ball into Lucas (on a Suarez-esque run). They don’t get the same 
result, though do get a corner.

54 min: That was like something from the training ground, with Deportivo’s 
defence playing a wonderful supporting role as a bunch of cones. Suarez gave 
and went, via Messi, and not a single Deportivo defender bothered to track him 
into the box. Incredible, really.Barcelona

Suarez to Messi, Messi to Saurez with the Uruguayan free and clear of the 
Deportivo defence with not a single one of them picking him up, and he slots it 
home from the penalty spot. Shocking defending from Deportivo.

51 min: Alves rakes a long ball into the box, which is instantly controlled by 
Suarez. Again he cuts back to Messi but he can’t get a shot away. There’s some 
dillying and dallying frmoBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, and eventually Deportivo 
force them back out and up the pitch. Oddly flat at the Riazor, noise-wise. 
Well, perhaps not that oddly, given their side are 0-3 down.

49 min: Dani Alves heaves a cross into the box, which is nodded back out by 
Mosquera but only to Rakitic. His shot this time is not remarkably efficient, 
it is in fact a blooter that goes well wide of Manu’s left hand post.

48 min: An exquisite goal, really. So fast, so simple and so deadly with 
Suarez’s cross over the top of the Deportivo defence a sign of such awareness 
and Rakitic’s finish remarkably efficient. A moment later, they nearly do it 
again with Suarez cutting the ball back to Messi, who strikes wide (Suarez was 
offside too).

GOAL! Deportivo 0-3 Barcelona (Rakitic, 45 min)

Neymar whizzes into the box, offloads to Suarez on the left, who picks out 
Rakitic completely unmarked over the other side of the area and he knocks it 
home first time. Is that the end of Barça’s blip?

Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> get the second half 
started. Messi is fit enough after his little twist and shake at the end of the 
first half and trots out much as if nothing had happened.

Well, if the entire of Europe is writing you off, your two main rivals are 
snapping at your heels like sharks and you’re facing a total collapse in the 
league, you may as well go out and beat Deportivo 8-0 to let everyone know 
quite how wrong they are. Suarez was sensational - three assists and a 
hat-trick. Wow.

Luis Suárez scores four as Barcelona rout Deportivo La Coruña 8-0

There’s just time for Suarez to whistle a shot over the bar, before the 
referee blows the final whistle on the dot of 90 minutes, putting the home side 
out of their misery without a second of injury time.
 
89 min: Neymar attempts to lift the ball over the Deportivo defence and 
Sidnei, for about the first time in the match, decides to track the runner - 
Messi, in this case - and shepherds him out of play. Deportivo have been awful 
in the second half but could have had goals in the first.
 
87 min: Is there time for another goal? What’s the betting Suarez would be 
involved if there was:

Luis Suárez has made La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> history today: 4 goals 
and an assists hat-trick 😱

<https://twitter.com/MisterChiping/status/722873431340015616>  
86 min: On the bench, Barcelona’s substitutes are asking what the score is in 
Bilbao. 1-0, they’re told, to Atlético. And despite the fact their side are 8-0 
up and having a ball, Barcelona’s subs look tense and taut on the bench, 
frustrated that they’ve let themselves get in this position.
 
85 min: There hasn’t been a goal in the last few minutes. People want their 
money back. Fede attempts one, striking from 30 yards, but Bravo catches the 
ball dismissively.
 
82 min: Lucas rifles in a shot at the other end, perhaps just to show he’s not 
down and out yet. His team are, however. What a silly game of football.
 
Messi to Saurez, Suarez across the box to Neymar and, cantering across the 
area, the Brazilian smashes the ball home. Imagine being Real Madrid in the 
changing room now thinking they’ve got to match it.

This is getting silly, Bartra, the central defender, simply runs the ball from 
the centre circle right through the middle of the Deportivo defence and slides 
the ball home from 15 yards. Ridiculously good goal, ridiculously poor 
defending.

76 min: The goals might come at the other end, that said. Laure is again free 
up the right and again crosses well. This time he finds Gutierrez, who heads 
over from not very far out at all. Depotivo could very easily have four, if not 
five goals. Barcelona’s front three (well, maybe not Neymar) might be back on 
track, but their defence isn’t.
 
74 min: This isn’t over yet by a long chalk, and it’s telling that Luis 
Enrique has used all his substitutions (having used none against Valencia) but 
left his three frontmen on. He’s keen to make a statement here.
 
So simple. Suarez checks inside and darts into the box, crosses to Messi (who 
had lost Sidnei) with ease and he passes the ball into the next from 10 yards.

71 min: More substitutions: Adriano replaces Jordi Alba at left back and 
Rafinha comes on for Sergio forBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. For Depor, the former 
Newcastle man Jonas Gutierrez replaces Celso Borges and that’s three 
substitutions each.
 
69 min: Lucas misses a sitter. Laure, unmarked on the right wing, pings in a 
great cross to the middle and finds the striker alone in the middle. From five 
yards, he manages to knock the ball high over the bar. Probably wouldn’t have 
changed the way the game is going but still.
 
67 min: Atlético aren’t taking the title race lying down either, they’ve just 
scored through Torres and lead Athletic 1-0 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/2016/apr/20/athleticbilbao-v-atleticomadrid>
.
 
66 min: Deportivo aren’t entirely lying down and taking this, and trot up the 
other end following the fifthBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> goal. Oriel Riera has a decent 
chance but complains (with some justification) that he was pulled over. He wins 
a corner but little comes of it from the home side’s point of view.
 
64 min: Neymar could certainly have scored there - are Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> now simply teeing Suarez up so 
that he wins the Pichichi? Stranger things have happened.
 
A long ball is launched into the Depor box and Neymar is on the end of it. He 
runs rapidly into the box and with the goal at his mercy … passes to Suarez 
when he could have scored himself. Suarez has one shot, which Laure blocks, 
then another which goes into the back of the net.

62 min: The Depor defence stands off Rakitic, inviting him to shoot so he does 
- high and wide. A minute later …
 
61 min: Deportivo have changed tack, the plan now appears to be to get the 
ball wide then cross. It’s made them look a touch more threatening in the last 
few minutes with Laure clumping a decent ball over from the right.
 
59 min: Lucas, by far Deportivo’s most threatening player, thwacks a fierce 
shot at theBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> goal from 
12 yards or so. Bravo makes another good stop, his palms stinging as though 
they’ve been flayed and dipped in Deep Heat no doubt.

“I’ve come to this late, but from what I can see Depor seem to be taking their 
duties as hosts exceptionally seriously,” writes Charles Antaki. “I don’t think 
I’ve seen more generosity on a football pitch all season. Are they resting for 
some other event coming up?
 
58 min: Substitution o’clock. The central defender Navarro is hoiked by 
Deportivo and is replaced by Fayçal Fajr, an attacking, creative midfielder. 
Yet to see how they’re going to reshuffle that. Next, Cani jogs off for Fede 
Cartabia. ForBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, 
Iniesta trots off and is replaced by Sergi Roberto.
 
56 min: A quick corner from Deportivo catches the referee off guard but not 
Barcelona. They whizz the ball around the edge of theBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> box, before attempting to play 
a Messi-esque ball into Lucas (on a Suarez-esque run). They don’t get the same 
result, though do get a corner.
 
54 min: That was like something from the training ground, with Deportivo’s 
defence playing a wonderful supporting role as a bunch of cones. Suarez gave 
and went, via Messi, and not a single Deportivo defender bothered to track him 
into the box. Incredible, really.Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are coasting now (cue five 
goals from Deportivo).
 
Suarez to Messi, Messi to Saurez with the Uruguayan free and clear of the 
Deportivo defence with not a single one of them picking him up, and he slots it 
home from the penalty spot. Shocking defending from Deportivo.

51 min: Alves rakes a long ball into the box, which is instantly controlled by 
Suarez. Again he cuts back to Messi but he can’t get a shot away. There’s some 
dillying and dallying frmoBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, and eventually Deportivo 
force them back out and up the pitch. Oddly flat at the Riazor, noise-wise. 
Well, perhaps not that oddly, given their side are 0-3 down.
 
49 min: Dani Alves heaves a cross into the box, which is nodded back out by 
Mosquera but only to Rakitic. His shot this time is not remarkably efficient, 
it is in fact a blooter that goes well wide of Manu’s left hand post.
 
48 min: An exquisite goal, really. So fast, so simple and so deadly with 
Suarez’s cross over the top of the Deportivo defence a sign of such awareness 
and Rakitic’s finish remarkably efficient. A moment later, they nearly do it 
again with Suarez cutting the ball back to Messi, who strikes wide (Suarez was 
offside too).
 
Neymar whizzes into the box, offloads to Suarez on the left, who picks out 
Rakitic completely unmarked over the other side of the area and he knocks it 
home first time. Is that the end of Barça’s blip?
 
46 min: Deportivo come out all guns blazing, shoving three up front. For a 
brief minute in the opening moments, it looks as if it might work but then …
 
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> get the second half 
started. Messi is fit enough after his little twist and shake at the end of the 
first half and trots out much as if nothing had happened.
 
The last time these sides met, in December, Deportivo came right back from 2-0 
down and won it. Second half coming up shortly but, here’s some reading in the 
general area of comebacks:
