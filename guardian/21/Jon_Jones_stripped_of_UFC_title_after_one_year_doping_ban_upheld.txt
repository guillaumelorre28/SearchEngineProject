Jon Jones has been stripped of the UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 
interim light heavyweight championship after an arbitration panel denied his 
appeal of a positive test and upheld a doping ban that will run through July.

Widely considered the world’s best pound-for-pound fighter, Jones was pulled 
from a July bout against Daniel Cormier at UFC 200 shortly after news about the 
positive drug test.

Jones claimed to have taken a sexual-enhancement pill but ended up testing 
positive for two banned anti-estrogen agents.

“Jon Jones has blown it in every way shape and form a guy with that much 
talent can blow it,” UFC president Dana White told ESPN. “Greatest talent ever 
and the biggest screw-up ever.”

The 29-year-old won the newly created interim title in April when he defeated 
Ovince St Preux at UFC 197.

The US Anti-Doping Agency, which handles UFC testing, declared Jones 
ineligible. He took the case to arbitration and that panel delivered the 
maximum one-year suspension, saying Jones’ “degree of fault verged on the 
reckless”.

Jones is eligible again on 7 July 2017.

UFC issued a statement saying it was aware of the one-year ban, which began on 
6 July.

“While the decision indicates no evidence of Jones’ intentional use of banned 
substances, it does highlight the care and diligence that is required by 
athletes competing in the UFC to ensure that no prohibited substances enter 
their system,” the UFC statement says.
