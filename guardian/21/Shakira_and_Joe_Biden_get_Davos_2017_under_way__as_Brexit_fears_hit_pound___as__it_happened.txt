WEF founder: We must stay optimistic
 Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPA 
Hello again. Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> has been busy 
tonight with meetings, nobnobbing, some exclusive private dinner, and plenty of 
armed police to deter anyone from sneaking around where they shouldn’t.

But before that all started, WEF’s founder, Klaus Schwab, told delegates that 
they need to up their game and deliver responsive and responsible leadership 
(the theme of this year’s Forum).

Schwab said:

“Responsive means that we listen to and interact with those who have entrusted 
us with leadership.

It is always important to prioritize the public social good over our own 
interests. We must emphasize humanization over robotization.”

Schwab is hoping that this week’s meeting will find ways to reform capitalism 
and boost growth, adding:

“Sometimes it seems that the world is overwhelmed by pessimism and cynicism. 
But we have to look in a confident way into the future.”

Full marks for optimism, after a year that has demolished the Davos world 
view. We’ll find out this week if WEF can rise to the challenge.... Goodnight!

Elsewhere in Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos>, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers has reported that many bosses are losing faith in 
globalisation (a journey that many people took a while ago).

My colleague Larry Elliott explains:

Executives running the world’s leading companies share public scepticism about 
the benefits of globalisation and doubt whether breaking down barriers to trade 
has helped tackleclimate change 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change> or inequality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report>
.

The annual health check of global boardrooms conducted by the consultancy firm 
PwC 
<http://www.thenewsmarket.com/global/latest-news/all/ceo-confidence-rises-despite-new-risks-and-uncertainty/s/c70b0fb6-8b74-4db4-b3c4-54db866bb3de>
 found the mood more upbeat than a year ago, despite the shockwaves caused in 
2016 by the vote forBrexit <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> 
and the victory ofDonald Trump  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>in the US presidential 
election.

But the survey, published to coincide with the World Economic Forum in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/14/davos-issues-trump-capitalism-china-brexit>
, found that the bullishness about the benefits of globalisation had diminished 
in the 19 years since PwC first polled executives at the end of the 1990s.

WEF’s final Crystal Award goes to actor Forest Whitaker, for his work on 
conflict resolution in the developing world.

The star of The Last King of Scotland explains that his Foundation helps young 
people to become the change they want to see in the world (hat-tip to Gandhi).

These ‘youth peacemakers’ are working on the front line to achieve 
humanitarian breakthroughs. For example, in Uganda, former child soldiers are 
now setting up electronics shops and salons.

In Mexico, they are leading skills-building sessions in prisons and tackling 
bullying in schools.

And in one case (I missed the country, sorry), they even negotiated with an 
army occupying a school, persuading them to leave.
Forest Whitaker (@ForestWhitaker) 
Very honored to receive the Crystal Award at the World Economic Forum tonight!

Shakira: More support for child education needed
 Photograph: Ruben Sprich/Reuters 
Shakira, the Columbian performer and singer, also receives a Crystal Award 
from WEF for her humanitarian work.

She talks about the crisis of child poverty in her country.

Children who don’t receive the food and stimulation they need, who aren’t 
played with and read to, will never reach their full potential, she says.

This means that being born into poverty means never getting out of it.


In Columbia, there are 250 million children trapped in poverty -- that’s 
almost the population of the United States. Today’s babies will create 
tomorrow’s businesses and solve tomorrow’s problems; but those who are 
economically disadvantaged need more help to succeed and achieve their 
potential.

Those with power, and money, cannot simply sit back and leave this to 
governments, she continues.

Shakira says her Foundation has achieved “jaw-dropping” results by funding 
schools in the most remote parts of Columbia. Students responded academically 
‘so well’, so that children who would have joined the guerillas are heading to 
university instead.

Investment in education can create miracles -- it’s a better feeling than 
winning a Grammy, she jokes.

And she wants those at WEF to help provide more funding for ECD (early 
childhood development), and to ‘invest in humans’.

“It’s the smart thing to do, the strategic thing to do, and the just thing to 
do.”

She says that music can play a role in making a better, more peaceful world as 
it has no ideology.

Then she turns to the world’s hunger crisis; 24 children have died through 
malnutrition in the last four minutes. Eight million people die from hunger 
each year; that’s one every three seconds.

She reminds the audience that the UN’s sustainable development goals includes 
the total eradication of hunger by 2030. but not enough is being done.

There’s no shortage of talk, Mutter says pointedly, as:

If one could eat resolutions and words, no-one would starve.

Everyone in this audience can help, she concludes. You must ignore the sirens 
of ever greater wealth, and instead do more to protect the poor and the weak.

Joe Biden: I pray my successor will keep up the fight against cancer
 Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images 
Outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden is telling the World Economic Forum that 
he’s optimistic that cancer can be beaten.

On his final overseas trip as VP, Biden is updating Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> on the Cancer Moonshot - his 
effort to dramatically boost the fight against cancer. He says that the 
initiative has made real progress, by bolstering collaboration between research 
groups, doctor and drugs companies.


Biden says there is an ‘enormous’ opportunity to build on this collaboration; 
he hopes that other countries will provide more support to help “double-down” 
on the battle.

And Biden also hopes that his successor, Mike Pence, will continue this work.

I’ve already spoken to the vice-president elect who is a good man, about my 
willingness to continue to work with him and the incoming administration, to be 
as committed and enthusiastic as we are about the goal of ending cancer as we 
know it.

My prayer is that they will do that as well.

Whatever happens, Biden continues, those in the private sector, 
philanthropists, academics will continue to work together as there’s just ‘too 
much momentum’, thanks to the improved collaboration between cancer centres, 
researchers, the government, etc.

 Biden insists that he’s optimistic, thanks to the “absolute commitment and 
sheer brilliance” of the researchers, scientists and institutions he’s worked 
with. In time, more people will get the right cure first time, cancer 
prevention will be improved, and care will be personalised.

“The one thing i can tell you, there’s hope.” 

Biden’s son, Beau, died of brain cancer in 2015. And the VP ends his speech 
today by citing JFK’s dream of putting a man on the moon:

Biden concludes saying just as President Kennedy was "unwilling to postpone" 
sending man to moon so too should pursuit of ending cancer

Over in Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos>, the 2017 World 
Economic Forum is now getting underway.

The biggest global gathering of world leaders and business chiefs will be 
formally opened at 6.15pm Swiss time by Klaus Schwab, who founded WEF back in 
the 1970s.

WEF will also award its traditional Crystal Awards, to violin Anne-Sophie 
Mutter, singer and performer Shakira and actor Forest Whitaker.

That will tee up four days of meetings, speeches and behind-the scenes talk 
about issues like Donald Trump, Britain’s exit from the EU, populism, climate 
change, artificial intelligence, and a lot more, under extra-tight security.

The pound has stabilised a little after its plunge to a three month low 
earlier in the day. But the fears of a hard Brexit, prompted by comments from 
the UK government ahead of prime minister Theresa May’s speech on Tuesday, mean 
that sterling is still down around 1% against the dollar.

It is currently down 0.8% at $1.2078 against the dollar and 0.6% against the 
euro at €1.1384.

But despite the boost to overseas earners from the weak pound, the FTSE 100 
has fallen back from its record intra-day level and is now down 0.11% at 7327. 
If the index closes lower it will end an unprecedented winning streak, with 12 
successive days of record closes and fourteen days of rises. Financial shares 
are leading the fallers, hit by worries that a hard Brexit would cause problems 
for their ability to operate in Europe in the future.

On that note, we’ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back 
later with the first reports from this year’sDavos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> gathering.

The UK Treasury has welcomed the upgrade to its forecasts by the IMF. It said:

The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, and today’s IMF forecasts 
confirm their view that the UK was the fastest-growing major advanced economy 
last year. We have reduced the deficit by almost two thirds, cut taxes for 
millions of working people, and employment is at a near-record high. The Autumn 
Statement reaffirmed the government’s commitment to return the public finances 
to balance as soon as practicable, while providing flexibility to support the 
economy as we exit the EU.

Britain’s business community has weighed into the Brexit debate ahead of an 
update by Theresa May on Tuesday:

Britain risks a “disorderly crash landing” if it assumes it can safely walk 
away from troublesome Brexit talks, business leaders have said, in a last-ditch 
plea for a negotiated settlement withEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

As Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> prepares to 
reveal an uncompromising set of UK objectives on Tuesday, pressure is mounting 
on the prime minister to take a firm line with other member states and 
ultimately fall back on World Trade Organisation tariffs if no deal can be 
agreed.

But the CBI is calling on politicians to wake up to the limitations of the WTO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/wto> and dangers of a disorderly or “train 
crash” Brexit, despite the long and painful concessions that may be necessary 
if the UK is to obtain a replacement free-trade agreement when it leaves the 
single market.

“The practicalities of a disorderly crash-landing need to be understood,” said 
Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, in an interview with the 
Guardian. “We have had conversations with some of the proponents of just 
walking away and we will again talk to them about what we see from our members 
about the consequences of that.

“An exit into WTO at the stroke of midnight without the proper planning and 
preparation in place would be very serious for the UK economy. There are some 
signs that there is more conversation around that being an outcome. Our job is 
to demonstrate how difficult that would be because of all of these unanswered 
questions.”

Hello again. Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> has been busy 
tonight with meetings, nobnobbing, some exclusive private dinner, and plenty of 
armed police to deter anyone from sneaking around where they shouldn’t.

But before that all started, WEF’s founder, Klaus Schwab, told delegates that 
they need to up their game and deliver responsive and responsible leadership 
(the theme of this year’s Forum).

Schwab said:

“Responsive means that we listen to and interact with those who have entrusted 
us with leadership.

It is always important to prioritize the public social good over our own 
interests. We must emphasize humanization over robotization.”

Schwab is hoping that this week’s meeting will find ways to reform capitalism 
and boost growth, adding:

“Sometimes it seems that the world is overwhelmed by pessimism and cynicism. 
But we have to look in a confident way into the future.”

Full marks for optimism, after a year that has demolished the Davos world 
view. We’ll find out this week if WEF can rise to the challenge.... Goodnight! 
GW
 
Elsewhere in Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos>, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers has reported that many bosses are losing faith in 
globalisation (a journey that many people took a while ago).

My colleague Larry Elliott explains:

Executives running the world’s leading companies share public scepticism about 
the benefits of globalisation and doubt whether breaking down barriers to trade 
has helped tackleclimate change 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change> or inequality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report>
.

The annual health check of global boardrooms conducted by the consultancy firm 
PwC 
<http://www.thenewsmarket.com/global/latest-news/all/ceo-confidence-rises-despite-new-risks-and-uncertainty/s/c70b0fb6-8b74-4db4-b3c4-54db866bb3de>
 found the mood more upbeat than a year ago, despite the shockwaves caused in 
2016 by the vote forBrexit <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> 
and the victory ofDonald Trump  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>in the US presidential 
election.

But the survey, published to coincide with the World Economic Forum in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/14/davos-issues-trump-capitalism-china-brexit>
, found that the bullishness about the benefits of globalisation had diminished 
in the 19 years since PwC first polled executives at the end of the 1990s.

Here’s the full story:

WEF’s final Crystal Award goes to actor Forest Whitaker, for his work on 
conflict resolution in the developing world.

The star of The Last King of Scotland explains that his Foundation helps young 
people to become the change they want to see in the world (hat-tip to Gandhi).

These ‘youth peacemakers’ are working on the front line to achieve 
humanitarian breakthroughs. For example, in Uganda, former child soldiers are 
now setting up electronics shops and salons.

In Mexico, they are leading skills-building sessions in prisons and tackling 
bullying in schools.

And in one case (I missed the country, sorry), they even negotiated with an 
army occupying a school, persuading them to leave.
Forest Whitaker (@ForestWhitaker) 
Very honored to receive the Crystal Award at the World Economic Forum tonight!

Shakira, the Columbian performer and singer, also receives a Crystal Award 
from WEF for her humanitarian work.

She talks about the crisis of child poverty in her country.

Children who don’t receive the food and stimulation they need, who aren’t 
played with and read to, will never reach their full potential, she says.

This means that being born into poverty means never getting out of it.


In Columbia, there are 250 million children trapped in poverty -- that’s 
almost the population of the United States. Today’s babies will create 
tomorrow’s businesses and solve tomorrow’s problems; but those who are 
economically disadvantaged need more help to succeed and achieve their 
potential.

Those with power, and money, cannot simply sit back and leave this to 
governments, she continues.
David Risher (@davidrisherWR) 
Today's babies will solve tomorrow's problems. All of us must pick up where 
governments leave off.@shakira <https://twitter.com/shakira> @wef

Shakira says her Foundation has achieved “jaw-dropping” results by funding 
schools in the most remote parts of Columbia. Students responded academically 
‘so well’, so that children who would have joined the guerillas are heading to 
university instead.

Investment in education can create miracles -- it’s a better feeling than 
winning a Grammy, she jokes.

And she wants those at WEF to help provide more funding for ECD (early 
childhood development), and to ‘invest in humans’.

“It’s the smart thing to do, the strategic thing to do, and the just thing to 
do.”
 
Over in the WEF congress hall, violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter is receiving a 
crystal award from the Forum for her work helping young musicians.

She says that music can play a role in making a better, more peaceful world as 
it has no ideology.

Then she turns to the world’s hunger crisis; 24 children have died through 
malnutrition in the last four minutes. Eight million people die from hunger 
each year; that’s one every three seconds.

She reminds the audience that the UN’s sustainable development goals includes 
the total eradication of hunger by 2030. but not enough is being done.

There’s no shortage of talk, Mutter says pointedly, as:

If one could eat resolutions and words, no-one would starve.

Everyone in this audience can help, she concludes. You must ignore the sirens 
of ever greater wealth, and instead do more to protect the poor and the weak.

Outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden is telling the World Economic Forum that 
he’s optimistic that cancer can be beaten.

On his final overseas trip as VP, Biden is updating Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> on the Cancer Moonshot - his 
effort to dramatically boost the fight against cancer. He says that the 
initiative has made real progress, by bolstering collaboration between research 
groups, doctor and drugs companies.


Biden says there is an ‘enormous’ opportunity to build on this collaboration; 
he hopes that other countries will provide more support to help “double-down” 
on the battle.

And Biden also hopes that his successor, Mike Pence, will continue this work.

I’ve already spoken to the vice-president elect who is a good man, about my 
willingness to continue to work with him and the incoming administration, to be 
as committed and enthusiastic as we are about the goal of ending cancer as we 
know it.

My prayer is that they will do that as well.

Whatever happens, Biden continues, those in the private sector, 
philanthropists, academics will continue to work together as there’s just ‘too 
much momentum’, thanks to the improved collaboration between cancer centres, 
researchers, the government, etc.

 Biden insists that he’s optimistic, thanks to the “absolute commitment and 
sheer brilliance” of the researchers, scientists and institutions he’s worked 
with. In time, more people will get the right cure first time, cancer 
prevention will be improved, and care will be personalised.

“The one thing i can tell you, there’s hope.” 

Biden’s son, Beau, died of brain cancer in 2015. And the VP ends his speech 
today by citing JFK’s dream of putting a man on the moon:

Over in Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos>, the 2017 World 
Economic Forum is now getting underway.

The biggest global gathering of world leaders and business chiefs will be 
formally opened at 6.15pm Swiss time by Klaus Schwab, who founded WEF back in 
the 1970s.

WEF will also award its traditional Crystal Awards, to violin Anne-Sophie 
Mutter, singer and performer Shakira and actor Forest Whitaker.

That will tee up four days of meetings, speeches and behind-the scenes talk 
about issues like Donald Trump, Britain’s exit from the EU, populism, climate 
change, artificial intelligence, and a lot more, under extra-tight security.

Oxfam has the set the scene, with its warning that eight billionaires own as 
much net wealth as the poorest half of the country.

And WEF itself is pushing for more inclusive, socially beneficial economic 
policies - having calculated that average incomes in many countries have shrank 
since 2008 (see earlier post 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/16/pound-falls-to-lowest-level-since-flash-crash-on-brexit-worries-business-live?page=with:block-587cbfb9e4b0f10ba20b8cbe#block-587cbfb9e4b0f10ba20b8cbe>
).

 
The pound has stabilised a little after its plunge to a three month low 
earlier in the day. But the fears of a hard Brexit, prompted by comments from 
the UK government ahead of prime minister Theresa May’s speech on Tuesday, mean 
that sterling is still down around 1% against the dollar.

It is currently down 0.8% at $1.2078 against the dollar and 0.6% against the 
euro at €1.1384.

But despite the boost to overseas earners from the weak pound, the FTSE 100 
has fallen back from its record intra-day level and is now down 0.11% at 7327. 
If the index closes lower it will end an unprecedented winning streak, with 12 
successive days of record closes and fourteen days of rises. Financial shares 
are leading the fallers, hit by worries that a hard Brexit would cause problems 
for their ability to operate in Europe in the future.

On that note, we’ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back 
later with the first reports from this year’sDavos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> gathering.
 
The UK Treasury has welcomed the upgrade to its forecasts by the IMF. It said:

The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, and today’s IMF forecasts 
confirm their view that the UK was the fastest-growing major advanced economy 
last year. We have reduced the deficit by almost two thirds, cut taxes for 
millions of working people, and employment is at a near-record high. The Autumn 
Statement reaffirmed the government’s commitment to return the public finances 
to balance as soon as practicable, while providing flexibility to support the 
economy as we exit the EU.
 
Britain’s business community has weighed into the Brexit debate ahead of an 
update by Theresa May on Tuesday:

Britain risks a “disorderly crash landing” if it assumes it can safely walk 
away from troublesome Brexit talks, business leaders have said, in a last-ditch 
plea for a negotiated settlement withEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

As Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> prepares to 
reveal an uncompromising set of UK objectives on Tuesday, pressure is mounting 
on the prime minister to take a firm line with other member states and 
ultimately fall back on World Trade Organisation tariffs if no deal can be 
agreed.

But the CBI is calling on politicians to wake up to the limitations of the WTO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/wto> and dangers of a disorderly or “train 
crash” Brexit, despite the long and painful concessions that may be necessary 
if the UK is to obtain a replacement free-trade agreement when it leaves the 
single market.

“The practicalities of a disorderly crash-landing need to be understood,” said 
Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, in an interview with the 
Guardian. “We have had conversations with some of the proponents of just 
walking away and we will again talk to them about what we see from our members 
about the consequences of that.

“An exit into WTO at the stroke of midnight without the proper planning and 
preparation in place would be very serious for the UK economy. There are some 
signs that there is more conversation around that being an outcome. Our job is 
to demonstrate how difficult that would be because of all of these unanswered 
questions.”
