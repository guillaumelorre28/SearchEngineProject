The year 2016 was supposed to be when the tech bubble 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/04/is-dotcom-bubble-about-to-burst-again>
finally <http://www.wsj.com/articles/this-tech-bubble-is-bursting-1462161662> 
burst 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-09/san-francisco-is-bracing-for-life-after-this-tech-bubble>
. Instead the world blew up.

Amid Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, and the increasingly catastrophic 
consequences 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/14/it-was-too-hot-even-to-leave-home-stories-from-the-worlds-hottest-year>
 ofclimate change 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/14/2016-will-be-the-hottest-year-on-record-un-says>
, the dominance of a handful of technology companies over society became 
increasingly obvious – from Facebook’s troubling impact on democracy to Elon 
Musk’s plan to colonize a new planet before we destroy this one.

Still, if there’s one thing we can learn from this year in technology, it’s 
that no matter how bad things get, someone in Silicon Valley will make money 
off it.

Here’s our list of tech’s biggest winners and losers of 2016:

 Mark Zuckerberg: steering the world’s most powerful (not a) media company. 
Photograph: Mariana Bazo/Reuters 
 There’s no arguing with world domination. The social network continued its 
relentless campaign to swallow the internet whole, racking up almost $6bn in 
profit in the first three quarters of the year and soaring to 1.79 billion 
monthly active users.

With its “walled garden” approach and obscure algorithms, Facebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> has control over the 
information reaching a quarter of the world’s population. The company that 
claims not to be a media company has become the most powerful media company in 
the history of the world. Surely nothing will go wrong.

Thiel began 2016 by revealing himself as the secret funder of a lawsuit

 against the publication (Gawker) that outed him as gay. He ended the year on 
the verge of translating his long-shot bet on Donald Trump’s election campaign 
into serious power. Thiel represents the unvarnished right-wing libertarianism

Not everything went perfectly this year for the engineer with a near messianic 
cult of admirers. There was Tesla’s disclosure of thefirst known fatality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk>
 caused by a self-driving car, plus concerns about hiscorporate maneuvers

But with global temperatures

social network lost control over its own narrative.

2016: the year Facebook became the bad guy

This was the year Facebook became a villain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/facebook-2016-problems-fake-news-censorship>
, and not just your run-of-the-mill, money-grubbing corporate bad guy, but an 
honest-to-God threat to democracy and civil society. Facebook is finally being 
called to account for the algorithms that cater to our worst instincts, trap us 
inideological bubbles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/facebook-bias-bubble-us-election-conservative-liberal-news-feed>
, and feed us misinformation.

After a year of floundering from one PR crisis to another with little 
indication that it was taking legitimate concerns seriously, let’s hope 
Facebook begins to grapple with its power and responsibility in 2017.

Did anyone really expect 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/18/twitter-reinvent-sale-jack-dorsey>
 that the return of co-founder Jack Dorsey as chief executive of Twitter would 
right the ship for the struggling social network? Maybe, but after a full year 
with Dorsey at the helm, Twitter is still flailing.

Users have plateaued, a buyout fell through 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/18/did-trolls-cost-twitter-35bn>
, and hundreds have beenlaid off 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/27/twitter-layoffs-financial-report>
. The company still hasn’t gotten a handle on abuse, has been blamed for 
helping to elevate the “alt-right” movement of white nationalist internet 
trolls, and killed off one tinybeacon of creative brilliance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/27/vine-twitter-discontinues-service-best-videos>
 in the internet’s morass of vitriol: Vine.

With its unerring instinct for fixing things that aren’t broken and breaking 
things that work, we can only assume that 2017 will seeTwitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> reach new heights of 
innovation in alienating its loyal users.

It took 13 years for Stanford dropout Elizabeth Holmes to build her 
blood-testing startup into a $9bn unicorn with outrageouslyglowing press 
<http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/blood-simpler>. It took less than 
a year for the whole house of cards to come tumbling down.

in a series of remarkable articles 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901>

It’s all good news for the self-driving evangelists who foresee fewer 
fatalities from collisions, but what about all the millions of people who drive 
professionally?

There are 3.5m truck drivers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/17/self-driving-trucks-impact-on-drivers-jobs-us>
 in the US, according to the American Trucking Association. Add in the hundreds 
of thousands of people who drive taxis, Ubers, limousines, buses, and 
ambulances, and we’re looking at mass displacement of working-class jobs that 
could dwarf thepost-Nafta loss of manufacturing jobs
