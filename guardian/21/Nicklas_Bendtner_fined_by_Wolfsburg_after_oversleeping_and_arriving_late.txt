The former Arsenal forward, who does not appear to have a future at the 
Bundesliga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> club 
having been dropped from the squad entirely for recent games, has been fined 
€2,250 (£1,770) – 50 for every minute of his arrears.

“I just slept in and didn’t hear my alarm,” the Denmark international told 
Bild. “It’s my mistake.”

Bendtner, 28, has scored twice for Wolfsburg this season although he has been 
left out of the match‑day squad for the past six games with the coach, Dieter 
Hecking, admitting he was no longer under consideration.

His contract still has more than a year left to run but Wolfsburg will be 
looking to offload Bendtner, who won a Serie A title while on loan at Juventus, 
this summer.
