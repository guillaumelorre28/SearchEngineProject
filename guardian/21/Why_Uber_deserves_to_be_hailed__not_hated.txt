I am very happy that the rights of Uber drivers are being protected by the 
courts, but it is worth remembering that Uber isn’t just successful because it 
is cheap, it also offers a remarkably convenient service which is head and 
shoulders above what was available before (Uber is misleading drivers about its 
legal defeat, claims union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/uber-is-misleading-drivers-about-its-legal-defeat-claims-union>
, 30 October). 

It is a joy to be able to see my car coming down the street rather than 
wandering the high street looking for a black cab or engaging in repeat 
conversations with a minicab operator (“he’s just coming, love – he’ll be there 
in three minutes, definitely”), followed by a 25-minute wait, occasionally a 
total no show. It is amazing to be driven from point A to point B in a foreign 
city without having to have the right cash or speak the language. I was wary at 
first, because of the social implications of the gig economy, but conversations 
with drivers have all been remarkably positive too.

They cite a lower per-mile payment, but many more fares than working for a 
minicab company and control over their hours, meaning you can pick your kids up 
from school and refuse to work on a Friday night if that’s what suits you and 
yours. I have no problem with fares going up to a level that covers workers’ 
rights – for me the level of convenience provided by the app is priceless.
