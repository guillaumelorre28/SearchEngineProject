Barcelona moved within touching distance of a fifth La Liga title in seven 
years when Pedro scored a late stunner to seal a nervous 2-0 win at home toReal 
Sociedad <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad>, before Real 
Madrid then dropped two points with a surprise 2-2 draw at home to Valencia.

The results stretched treble-chasing Barça’s lead over second-placed Real to 
four points. Barça have 90 points with two games left, including a trip to the 
champions, Atlético Madrid, next weekend, with Real on 86, 10 ahead of 
third-placed Atlético, who play at Levante on Sunday.

Sociedad’s Argentinian goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli was on sparkling form and 
conjured up a series of superb saves to deny Barça’s attacking trident of 
Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez before the first of these finally found 
the net after 51 minutes.

The Sociedad defender Mikel González attempted a clearance but the ball fell 
kindly for the Brazil forward and he nodded home to settle the home fans’ 
jangling nerves.

Neymar, who claimed Barça’s third goal in Wednesday’s 3-0 Champions League 
semi-final, first leg win over Bayern Munich, has scored in his last six 
appearances in all competitions, equalling his best run since joining from 
Santos in 2013.

Pedro’s playing time has been limited this season but he scored one of the 
goals of the season four minutes from time shortly after replacing Rafinha. The 
ball looped up in the penalty area and the Spain international sent it arrowing 
into the roof of the net with an acrobatic overhead kick.

Barça play their Champions League return leg at Bayern on Tuesday and will 
seek a record-extending 27th Copa del Rey triumph against Athletic Bilbao in 
the final at the end of the month.
