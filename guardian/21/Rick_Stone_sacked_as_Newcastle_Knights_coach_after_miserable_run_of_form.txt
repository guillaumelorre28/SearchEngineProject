Newcastle coach Rick Stone has been sacked with Danny Buderus to take over the 
strugglingNRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> club.

The Knights announced on Monday afternoon that the position of Stone had 
become “untenable” following the club’s 52-6 thrashing by South Sydney on 
Saturday, the club’s 12th loss in 14 matches.


Stone’s assistant and club legend Buderus will take over in the interim as 
Newcastle begin the search for a new coach for the 2016 season.


“We thank Rick for his efforts and loyalty over a long period of time and 
while these decisions are never easy, it was made in the best interests of the 
club,” chief executive Matt Gidley said in a statement.


“The club will now undertake a formal review process of our entire football 
operations, of which the playing group are a key part, and all have the 
opportunity to demonstrate over the next seven weeks why they should retain 
their position.


“The club strives to build a consistent, competitive and entertaining team and 
this formal review process will help us achieve this.”


After winning their first four games of the season, the Knights have enjoyed 
just two victories since and sit second last on the NRL ladder.
