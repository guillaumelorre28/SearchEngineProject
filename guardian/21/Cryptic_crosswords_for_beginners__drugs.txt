The intoxicants most associated with crosswords are tea and coffee (for 
solvers) and ale (formany

). Both groups, though, need to talk like a drug dealer, or one of his or her 
customers, if they want to expand their cryptic minds.


Cryptic clues are all about seeming to say one thing when you in fact mean 
another. And so slang has long been part of the language of crosswords, and 
that includes all that drug slang, which allows you to refer to various 
substances with less chance of anyone who overhears you knowing what you’re on 
(about).

Here are some examples of the crosswords’ favourite controlled substances. For 
the benefit of newcomers, cryptic clues typically contain two routes to the 
answer: a definition (look out for words inbold type in the examples below) and 
some wordplay.

And here we are going to be looking at clues in isolation. A genuine puzzle 
environment would also give you some letters from other clues, making the solve 
easier again.

Some examples

 ...

15d Expressing contempt for cocaine taking? (8)
[ slang term for the ingestion of cocaine ]

... you’re looking for a word used by benzoylmethylecgonine aficionados, clued 
more straightforwardly as “expressing contempt for”: SNORTING. Here’s the same 
drug again ina clue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/24801#2-down> from Rover ...

2d Cocaine involved in increasing dependency (9)
[ slang for ‘cocaine’ inside a word for ‘increasing’ ]
[ C inside ADDITION ]

... where we put one part of the wordplay inside another (as explained here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/apr/19/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-containers>
) and end up with a satisfying ADDICTION.

Those single-letter abbreviations are very useful ways of indicating, well, 
single letters – and so we have heroin as H inthis clue

 ...

16ac Dope and heroin in film like Women In Love? (7)
[ synonym for ‘dope’ + abbreviation for ‘heroin’ inside synonym for ‘film’ ]
[ SAP + H inside PIC ]

... where the word “dope” refers to a SAP rather than to anything illegal, and 
the definition (“like women in love”) gives SAPPHIC. And of course there’s E 
for ecstasy, as inthis one 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26305#6-down> from Brendan ...

6d Two chaps with ecstasy, one preferring grass (9)
[ two male names + abbreviation for ‘ecstasy’ ]
[ HERB + IVOR + E ]

... where again the grass is the perfectly legal kind preferred by a 
HERBIVORE. A warning, though: setters will not always specify ketamine (K), 
heroin (H) and so on: it may be the word “drug” alone that should get you 
thinking through your Ks and your Hs, your Cs and your Es.

It’s not always that simple

There are also the longer slang terms, so you might encounter a clue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25437#12-across> like Rufus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/feb/22/meet-the-setter-rufus>

12ac Leading lady cut short with smack (6)
[ synonym for ‘leading lady’ with last letter missing ]

... who takes you from HEROINE to HEROIN, or Imogen’s devious indication 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/26237#17-down> ...

17d Coke party that’s thrown by children (8)
[ slang term for ‘coke’ + synonym for ‘party’ ]
[ SNOW + BALL ]

... of SNOWBALL. Traces of cocaine can also be found under Chambers 
Dictionary’s headwords ICE, CANDY, READY-WASH, BLOW and, of course, CHARLIE, 
and while a crosswording “horse” might be a gee-gee (GG), it could also be H 
(“heroin” also suggesting JUNK, SUGAR and SNOW).

One last tip: there’s a word that refers not to the drugs themselves, but to a 
person. Vowels have a habit of appearing in words, and so setters find 
themselves needing, more often than you normally might, to use words with 
shapes like U_E_. (There’sa primer on the words that crossword setters find 
themselves returning to here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/feb/08/crossword-blog-word-puzzle-setters-love>
.)

UREA is not something that you want to mention too often (the American setter 
Merl Reagle discusses the vowelly URINE and ENEMA here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2015/aug/24/crossword-blog-merl-reagle>
), so expect to see the word ...

21d Junky delivering final bits of The Walrus and the Carpenter (4)
[ last two letters of WALRUS + last two letters of CARPENTER ]
[ US + ER ]

... USER often, clued above
