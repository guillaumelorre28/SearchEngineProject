, has stepped down for personal reasons.

“This decision has come with a heavy heart,” the 46-year-old said. “I have had 
to make this tough call for personal reasons and I request everyone respects 
that. I would like to personally thank the players, directors, staff and 
especially, all the supporters of this great club for my time here.”

Lowes’ assistant, Matt Diskin, has been placed in temporary charge for this 
weekend’s league game against Workington, only five days after being appointed 
as Batley’s coach for 2017.

A statement from Bradford said: “It is with much sadness and reluctance the 
club has received and accepted the resignation of James Lowes, who has stepped 
down for personal reasons. The club puts on record its gratitude for the 
significant contribution James has made as head coach during his 22 months at
Bradford Bulls <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradfordbulls> and we wish 
him every success in the future.

“Matt Diskin, with the support of Chev Walker, will act as interim head coach 
as the process of seeking a replacement begins immediately.”

Lowes, the former Great Britain hooker who spent eight seasons as a player 
with Bradford after joining them from Leeds in 1996, quit as the coach of 
Yorkshire Carnegie to return to the Provident Stadium 22 months ago.

Unable to save them from relegation, Lowes watched Bradford miss out on an 
immediate return to Super Leaguewhen they lost to Wakefield

 in the £1m match last September and is thought to have been unhappy for some 
time.

The Bulls suffered a surprise Challenge Cup defeat against Dewsbury and are 
fourth in the Championship after winning five of their first nine matches.
