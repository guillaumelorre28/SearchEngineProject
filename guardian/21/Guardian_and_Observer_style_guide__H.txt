hazard or risk?

with risk than hazard, the distinction is worth bearing in mind

HBOS

HDTV, HD DVD

head-butt
but butt should normally suffice

headdress, headhunter, headroom
but head-on

headed or heading?
The former is most commonly used as past tense (“we headed for the exit”) and 
the latter as present participle (“we are heading in the right direction”); try 
not to mix them up – “we are headed in the right direction” sounds inelegant at 
best

headlines
What makes a great, or at least memorable, headline? They can be historic 
(“Man walks on Moon”), campaigning (“He lied and lied and lied”), classical 
(“Between Cilla and Charybdis”), subtle (“Flo quiets the Dons”), funny (“Super 
Caley go ballistic – Celtic are atrocious”), notorious (“Gotcha!”), scurrilous 
(“Zip me up before you go-go”), or downright absurd (“Freddie Starr ate my 
hamster”). There is no magic formula but here are a few guidelines.

Use active verbs where possible, particularly in news headlines: “Editor 
updates style guidelines” is much better than “Style guidelines updated”.

Avoid tabloid cliches such as bid, brand, dub and slam, and their broadsheet 
counterparts such as insist, signal and target. Imagining that you are 
describing an event, in words, to real people, is a good antidote to 
journalese: no one in a pub says “Did you see that Brown slammed Blair in a 
dramatic power bid?”

Just as we would in copy, we need to take care with words such as debacle, 
farce and fiasco, especially when combined, which we contrived to do in the 
headline “Hips fiasco descends into farce”– the fact that “Hips farce descends 
into fiasco” would work just as well tells you something is probably wrong here.

Strive to be fresh: tired plays on the phrase “Mind the gap”, heard only 
occasionally these days by passengers on the London underground, have become 
tedious, as well as either baffling or infuriating to readers who do not happen 
to live in the capital.

Take care over ambiguity:” Landmine claims dog UK arms firm”, which appeared 
in the paper, contains so many successive nouns, some of which may or may not 
be verbs, that you have to read it several times to work out what it means.

Exclamation marks – look, I’ve written something funny! – should never be 
used. Question marks are also to be avoided, as are quotation marks, unless 
essential to signify a quote or for legal reasons. And we should resist the 
temptation to save space by replacing “and” with a comma: “Blair and Brown 
agree euro deal” not “Blair, Brown agree euro deal”.

Puns are fine – “Where there’s muck there’s bras”, about a farmer’s wife who 
started a lingerie business from a barn, was voted headline of the year by our 
staff – but do not overuse, or resort to tired puns such as “flushed with 
success”(this story has got a plumber in it).It is possible to try just a 
little too hard (“To baldly grow where no mane’s grown before”). In the 1970s 
and 80s the Guardian suffered from a reputation for excruciating puns; today, 
we want to be known for clever, original and witty headlines.

Unexpected twists, or subtle plays on words and phrases, show the subeditor’s 
craft at its best: a power failure in a theatre became, in the Guardian, “Bad 
lights stop play”. A light touch can work beautifully: “Drop dead, gorgeous”, 
on a story about office jealousy, added one comma to a well-known film title to 
create the perfect headline. When Tate Modern exhibited a giant sun, to create 
its own indoor climate, the beautiful headline written by the Guardian’s Steve 
Chamberlain – “But is it weather?” (a rare example of a question mark being 
required) – deserved to be framed and exhibited in a gallery in its own right.

Be careful when making references to popular culture: “Mrs Culpepper’s lonely 
hearts club banned” works, because most people are familiar with the Beatles’ 
Sgt Pepper album, but allusions to your favourite obscure prog-rock LP are 
likely to pass over most readers’ heads. Long after most people had forgotten 
the 1960s movie Charlie Bubbles, tabloid sports subeditors continued to mystify 
their readers by using the headline “Charlie bubbles” whenever anyone called 
Charlie scored a goal. “Book lack in Ongar”, about a shortage of resources in 
Essex libraries, remains one of the all-time great headlines, but it only works 
if you get the reference to John Osborne’s 1956 play Look Back in Anger (or at 
least it did until Oasis helpfully recorded a song called Don’t Look Back in 
Anger).

It’s time for some formulaic headlines to be given a decent burial, or at 
least a long rest. “The kids are alright”(based on a song by the Who, and 
subsequently a film) crops up, with minor variations, on a weekly and sometimes 
daily basis in British newspapers: “The kids are alright online”, “The kids are 
all right (and left)“,”The kids are all right, left and centre”, and so on.

Even more ubiquitous are “Size isn’t everything” and its close relative “Size 
doesn’t matter”, used to refer to a car (in two different newspapers), school 
uniforms, the actor Simon Callow’s height, a hotel in Turkey, new houses, 
national economies, motorbikes, a footballer, the gallery following a golf 
tournament, and – once – penis size.

The ever-popular “Brighton rocks” and its variations are an allusion, still 
common, to the Graham Greene novel and subsequent film, both more than 50 years 
old. How many people still understand the reference? “So lucky, lucky, lucky”, 
a recent headline we used above a photograph of Kylie Minogue, quoted lyrics 
from a hit she had in nearly 20 years ago. How many of our readers would be 
aware of this? You have to use your judgment.

If you are quoting, be sure to get it right. “Talkin’ about their generation”, 
from a classic 1960s song by the Who, fails as a headline because it literally 
lacks rhythm (it should be “Talkin’ ‘bout”). We claimed that Millwall fans sing 
“No one likes us and we don’t care”; they don’t sing that, and the mistake made 
it look as if we don’t care.

As always, the most important thing is to think of the readers and remember 
that we are writing headlines for their benefit, not for our own amusement or 
to show how clever we are.

headquarters
can be used as a singular (“a large headquarters”) or plural (“our 
headquarters are in London”); HQ, however, takes the singular

headteacher

Teachers

Health and Safety Executive

Heathrow airport
or simply Heathrow; not “London’s Heathrow”

heatwave

heave
There is confusion about the past tense, which is heaved in the senses of “she 
heaved a sigh of relief as he heaved the knife away” but hove in other senses: 
“they hove into view, hove up the anchor and hove alongside.” In all the above 
cases, the present tense is heave or heaves, so it would be “they heave into 
view”

heaven

hectares
should be converted to acres in brackets at first mention by multiplying by 
2.47, so 10 hectares is 24.7 acres; to convert acres to hectares, multiply by 
0.4, so 10 acres is 4 hectares (we get this the wrong way round embarrassingly 
often)

height
in metres with imperial conversion, eg 1.68 metres (5ft 7in)

heir apparent

taken out of the will; don’t use to mean likely successor

high net worth individual
classification used by the financial services industry. The figure differs by 
institution and region, but the most commonly quoted is $1m in liquid financial 
assets (below that you are merely “affluent”). More than $50m in wealth 
classifies someone as “ultra high net worth”.

Unless specifically referring to such a classification, terms such as “rich 
person” or “wealthy people” should suffice

hippopotamus
plural hippopotamuses not hippopotami

hippy
plural hippies

Hirst, Damien

historic or historical?
A historic event is notable, a historical event simply something that happened 
in the past. So someone might be accused of historical crimes that happened 
years earlier.

It’s not necessary to use the word “historical” when the event is clearly in 
the past, so this was doubly wrong and “historic” should have been deleted: 
“Detectives were already investigating allegations of historic child sexual 
abuse from more than 30 years ago.”

Note that it’s A not “an”, unless directly quoting: “an historic” is 
considered old-fashioned, and in modern English “a historic”, “a hotel” and so 
on sound more natural. Before silent H, the opposite applies: an heir, an 
honest man, etc

Historic England
Government service, formerly part of English Heritage, dealing with listing, 
planning, grants and heritage research and advice

HIT Entertainment

hitchhiker, hitchhiking
no hyphens

hi-tech, hi-vis

“Aids test”; an HIV-positive man (hyphen) is HIV positive (no hyphen)

HM
or Her Majesty for the Queen, not HRH

HMS
Her Majesty’s Ship: does not need the definite article, so it is “HMS 
Pinafore” rather than “the HMS Pinafore”

hoard or horde?
a hoard of treasure; a horde (or hordes) of tourists. Often confused


hobnob
as in “she likes to hobnob with the rich and powerful”; Hobnobs biscuits

Hobson’s choice
a “choice” between taking what is offered and nothing at all

Ho Chi Minh City
formerly Saigon

hockey mom
We “translated” this to describe Sarah Palin as a “hockey mum”, which sounds 
daft

hoi polloi

of ancient Greek

holidaymaker

Holland
should not be used to mean the Netherlands (of which it is a region), with the 
exception of the Dutch football team, who are conventionally known as Holland

Holocaust
Do not trivialise by comparing piles of cattle during a foot-and-mouth 
outbreak to the Holocaust, or through phrases such as “Belsen-skinny” which, 
incredibly, found its way one into of our stories about Kate Winslet

holy communion, holy grail
but Holy Land, Holy See, Holy Week

Holyrood
home of Scotland’s parliament, in Edinburgh

Holyroodhouse

not hone in on, which suggests you need to hone your writing skills

homeland
but home town

homemade

Home Office
but home secretary (although the official title is “Secretary of State for the 
Home Department”)

for the former, which means of the same kind, uniform


“homosexual rape”
is rape (or male rape if necessary)

honeybee

Hongkongers
one word

Hong Kong names
like Taiwanese and Korean names, Hong Kong names are written in two parts with 
a hyphen, eg Tung Chee-hwa (Tung after first mention)

hon members
of parliament

honorarium
plural honorariums

honorary knights
are not given titles, so it is still plain Geldof rather than Sir Bob

honorifics
Use just surname after first mention, except in leader columns. 

So: David Cameron at first mention, thereafter Cameron; Harriet Harman at 
first mention, subsequently Harman; Sir Richard Branson at first mention, 
thereafter Branson; Sayeeda Warsi at first mention, then Lady Warsi, and 
subsequently Warsi (see entry on Peers); Prof John Wells at first mention, 
thereafter Wells; Dr Bill Bailey (and all other medical and scientific doctors 
and doctors of divinity) at first mention, subsequently Bailey; the Rev George 
Herbert at first mention, thereafter Herbert, etc.

As always, use common sense: in a story where two people have the same name 
(eg a court case about a husband and wife or brothers), it may be necessary to 
use Mr and Mrs or Ms, or forenames. In news stories particularly we should use 
an honorific if it sounds jarring or insensitive not to do so – for example, a 
woman whose son has been killed on active duty in Iraq should be “Mrs Smith” 
and not “Smith”. We need to use our judgment and be guided by the tone of the 
piece.

Follow traditional Guardian style in leading articles (but not other comment 
pieces and columns on leader pages): use honorifics after first mention, unless 
writing about an artist, author, journalist, musician, criminal or dead person; 
use Ms for women on second mention unless they have expressed a preference for 
Miss or Mrs.

So: at first mention David Cameron, Harriet Harman, Sir Richard Branson, Lady 
Warsi, Prof John Wells, Dr Bill Bailey, the Rev George Herbert; thereafter Mr 
Cameron, Ms Harman, Sir Richard, Lady Warsi, Prof Wells, Dr Bailey, Mr Herbert, 
etc.

Under-18s should normally be referred to by their first names

honour
When Hamlet says that a custom is more honoured in the breach than the 
observance, he means that it is more honourable to break than to keep it; the 
phrase is often misused to mean a rule that is more often broken than observed

“honour” killings
always in quotes; as a reader says: “There is no honour involved in these 
murders and calling them honour killings belittles the victims and plays down 
the crime”

HONY
Humans of New York website

hoodie
a hooded top, as well as someone who wears one

Hoover
TM; say vacuum cleaner unless you are sure it is a Hoover (uc); but lc for 
figurativehoovering up (eg “the Guardian website hoovered up all the awards”)

hopefully
Like many other adverbs, such as frankly, happily, honestly and sadly, 
hopefully can be used as a “sentence adverb” indicating the writer’s view of 
events – “hopefully, we will reach the summit” – or as a “manner adverb” 
modifying a verb – “we set off hopefully for the summit”. Why some people are 
upset by “hopefully we will win” and not “sadly we lost” is a mystery

horrendous
sounds like a rather ugly combination of horrific and tremendous, but is in 
fact from the Latin for fearful; horrific is generally preferable

horticulturist
not horticulturalist

hospitalised
do not use; say someone was taken (never “rushed”) to hospital

hospitals
lc for the generic part, eg Derby district general hospital, Great Ormond 
Street children’s hospital, Royal London hospital

hospital trusts
As with hospitals, lc for everything that is generic: hospital, hospitals, 
healthcare, partnership, etc, plus foundation (which can normally be omitted) 
and trust.

A few examples:
Papworth hospital
Papworth hospital NHS foundation trust (if you want to give the full name), 
Papworth hospital NHS trust (normal style on first mention), the trust 
(subsequent mentions).
Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS trust
Colchester hospital university NHS trust
North Essex partnership university NHS trust
Sheffield children’s NHS trust
South Devon healthcare NHS trust

hostelling
two Ls

hotdog, hotpot

hotels
a hotel not “an”; do not cap up “hotel”: the Dorchester, the Ritz, the Grand 
hotel, Brighton, etc (but don’t be silly and lowercase Hotel California)

hotline, hotspot

hot-water bottle

houseboat, housebreaker, housebuyer, householder, housekeeper

housebuilding

househusband, housewife
should be used with care; avoid sexist stereotyping such as lower food prices 
being “good news for housewives” (it’s good news for shoppers)

House Un-American Activities Committee (Huac)
anti-communist investigating body of the House of Representatives, often 
associated with “McCarthyism”, although Joseph McCarthy was in fact head of the 
Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations

hove
past tense and past participle of heave used in a nautical context, literally 
or metaphorically (they hove into view, hove up the anchor and hove alongside); 
so do not write, for example, “Woods and Mickelson had only to hove into view” 
(should be heave) or “Sweeney Todd now hoves into view” (should be heaves).

In other contexts, use heaved: she heaved a sigh of relief as he heaved the 
weapon away

hoverboard
also known as a self-­balancing scooter, e-board or swegway.

Note that swegway is a lowercase generic term, while some of the many brands 
of board include SwegWay, Swagway, iSwegway etc

hovercraft

Howards End

<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-s#sexing>

hyperthermia
hot; hypothermia cold

hyphens
Our style is to use one word wherever possible. Hyphens tend to clutter up 
text (particularly when the computer breaks already hyphenated words at the end 
of lines). This is a widespread trend in the language: “The transition from 
space to hyphen to close juxtaposition reflects the progressive 
institutionalisation of the compound,” as Rodney Huddleston puts it, in his 
inimitable pithy style, in his Introduction to the Grammar of English.

Inventions, ideas and new concepts often begin life as two words, then become 
hyphenated, before finally becoming accepted as one word. Why wait? “Wire-less” 
and “down-stairs” were once hyphenated, and some old-fashioned souls still 
hyphenate e-mail.

Words such as chatroom, frontbench, gameplan, housebuyer and standup are all 
one word in our publications, as are thinktank (not a tank that thinks), 
longlist (not necessarily a long list) and shortlist (which need not be short).

There is no need to use hyphens with most compound adjectives, where the 
meaning is clear and unambiguous without: civil rights movement, financial 
services sector, work inspection powers, etc. Hyphens should, however, be used 
to form short compound adjectives, eg two-tonne vessel, three-year deal, 
19th-century artist. Also use hyphens where not using one would be ambiguous, 
eg to distinguish “black-cab drivers come under attack” from “black cab-drivers 
come under attack”. A missing hyphen in a review of Chekhov’s Three Sisters led 
us to refer to “the servant abusing Natasha”, rather than “the servant-abusing 
Natasha”.

Do not use hyphens after adverbs ending in -ly, eg a hotly disputed penalty, a 
constantly evolving newspaper, genetically modified food, etc, but hyphens are 
needed with short and common adverbs, eg ever-forgiving family, much-loved 
character, well-established principle of style (note, however, that in the 
construction “the principles of style are well established” there is no need to 
hyphenate).
-
When an adverb can also be an adjective (eg hard), the hyphen is required to 
avoid ambiguity – it’s not a hard, pressed person, but a hard-pressed one; an 
ill-prepared report, rather than an ill, prepared one.

Use a hyphen in verbs where necessary to stop this kind of thing happening:

Motorists
told: don’t
panic buy
petrol

(While not panicking may well have been advisable, they had actually been told 
not to panic-buy.)

Prefixes such as macro, mega, micro, mini, multi, over, super and under rarely 
need hyphens: examples are listed separately.Follow Collins
