In Cardiff, Welsh assembly politicians and their aides were hammering out 
deals, exchanging insults in the press and attempting to compromise on a 
deadlock that has prevented the creation of a new government.

Twenty miles down the road, at the Lion Inn in Treorchy, high in the Rhondda 
valley, drinkers were frankly baffled that their new constituency member, the
Plaid Cymru <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/plaid-cymru> leader Leanne 
Wood, had very nearly become first minister despite only having a fifth of the 
assembly in her party.

“It all seems a little rum to me,” said Jezz Jones, a young builder enjoying a 
pint in the sunshine. “We don’t often talk politics when we’re working but we 
were today. We can’t make head nor tail of it. Plaid in cahoots with Ukip and 
the Tories? It doesn’t seem right. What’s that about? You tell me.”

Plaid would be horrified at the idea of being in league with parties it sees 
as being far to its right. But an extraordinary, unprecedented situation arose 
following last week’s Welsh assembly vote.Labour had won 29 of the 60 seats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/labour-wales-plaid-cymru-takes-rhondda-plaid-cymru>
 and it was widely assumed its leader and the current first minister, Carwyn 
Jones, would head a minority government.

But Plaid Cymru, despite winning only 12 seats, put forward its leader for the 
first minister’s job on Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/carwyn-jones-leanne-wood-tied-welsh-first-minister>
 and thanks to support from the Conservatives and Ukip, which took seats at the 
assembly for the first time, the vote was tied. The assembly broke up and, if a 
deal cannot be brokered, there is a prospect of the election being re-run.

Plaid loyalists, who last week were celebrating after Wood won a constituency 
seat in what is traditionally aLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> stronghold, admitted people were 
puzzled.

The councillor Emyr John Webster said he had had to explain that Plaid were 
not in any sort of coalition with the Tories, let alone Ukip. “It’s simply that 
they voted for Leanne. It was all about Plaid showing Labour that they wouldn’t 
be taken for granted.”

Webster’s mum, Gaynor, still has a poster of Wood fixed to the side of her 
house. “She’s lovely. She would make a great first minister. She has put the 
Rhondda on the map as it is. I’m going to keep that poster up for ages.”

In Cardiff, Labour and Plaid accused each other of arrogance. 

Alun Davies, the Labour assembly member for Blaenau Gwent 
<http://senedd.assembly.wales/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=225>, said with 29 seats his 
party had the right and mandate to govern. He said: “How we do that is an 
entirely different question. We need to be more open, transparent, inclusive. 
We have to reach out.”

He said it had taken Plaid, the second biggest party, only a week to start 
working with Ukip – which they had promised voters they would never do.

Davies pointed out that Plaid had put forward candidates for both presiding 
officer and first minister. “I think that smacks of an arrogance that the 
people ofWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> simply will not tolerate.

“I’m not interested in playing these games. I’m interested in delivering for 
the people who voted for me last week. I’m interested in the future of the 
steel industry, in creating jobs, in investing in infrastructure. I don’t want 
to be sitting in Cardiff Bay twiddling my thumbs, waiting for Plaid Cymru to 
get off their high horse.”

Before the election, polling put Wood as the most popular leader in Wales. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/25/plaid-cymru-leanne-wood-most-popular-leader-in-wales-poll>
 A former probation officer, she was one of the star performers during last 
year’s UK general election campaign, winning fans for slapping down Ukip’s 
Nigel Farage during a leaders’ debate. Any perceived link to Ukip and the 
Tories now may harm her image.

The Plaid AM Simon Thomas said the party had acted as it did to “check” 
Labour. He said: “We did offer Labour the chance to delay this vote to allow 
for proper talks to take place. It was Labour’s arrogant decision to press 
ahead. They assumed they would march back into government and they have been 
checked.

“The first thing we want to achieve is that Labour is checked and reminded 
that it doesn’t have a majority and has to work with other parties. The second 
thing we want is proper discussions. We’ve heard a lot of talk from Labour 
about their programme of government. What programme of government? They don’t 
have a mandate simply to press ahead with their manifesto.

“Simply turning up at the assembly and nominating Carwyn Jones without a word 
over what sort of government he will be leading, what programme he will be 
putting together, I think that is simply not good enough and it is not 
respectful of all parties in the assembly.”

The number of votes for Jones and Wood on Wednesday was tied on 29 each 
(neither the presiding officer nor the deputy votes). Had Kirsty Williams, the 
last remaining Liberal Democrat in the assembly, voted with Plaid and the 
Tories, Wood would have become the first minister despite Labour being by far 
the largest party.

Ukip won seven seats at the assembly and by backing Wood is already making 
good on its promise to shake up what it sees as a “cosy” assembly. The former 
Tory MP Neil Hamilton is group leader but there are already signs there will be 
splits within the group and some may soon back Carwyn Jones as the new first 
minister.

Roger Scully, professor of political science at Cardiff University, said the 
clear winners of the first minister vote were the Tories and Ukip.

“They managed both to give Labour a very uncomfortable time in the assembly 
and then give Plaid a good kicking afterwards. It’s job done as far as they are 
concerned. I think Plaid were a bit naive.”

But he said what had happened exposed important strategic issues. 

At the last assembly Labour had half the seats. Scully said to get its 
majority on the important votes it could reach out to either the Liberal 
Democrats or Plaid Cymru and play the two off against one another and get away 
with pretty minimal concessions.

Scully said in the current assembly, where Labour is two off a majority and 
the Lib Dems have only one member left, Plaid Cymru seems to be in a strong 
bargaining position. On the other hand, every time it sides with the other 
opposition parties, Labour will be able to “smash Plaid over the head” with the 
criticism that it is lining up with the Tories and Ukip.

Scully said last week had been good for Wood and this one was not turning out 
so well, but he did not think she had been badly damaged.

He said: “Some way of retreat will be found for Plaid and this will all be 
forgotten in a while. Clearly Carwyn is going to be appointed first minister, 
probably next Tuesday.”

Which would suit Dom, 75, who runs the station cafe next to the Plaid office 
in Treorchy, which has been in the family since the 1930s. “Carwyn doesn’t do a 
bad job,” said Dom, even though he voted for Wood. “He’s presentable. He’s 
pretty good for Wales.”
