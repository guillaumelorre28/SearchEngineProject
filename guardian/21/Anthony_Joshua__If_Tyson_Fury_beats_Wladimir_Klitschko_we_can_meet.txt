Fury had given up that belt

when he opted for a rematch with Klitschko rather than a mandatory defence 
against the IBF’s appointed challenger.

Fury will face Klitschko again on 9 July at the Manchester Arena

 and Joshua is keen for his chance to fight his fellow Briton.

Joshua said: “I wish him all the best. I want Tyson to win, obviously, because 
it’s good for the British market, good for the British boxing scene.

“And then that lines something up for me and him some time in the future. He 
seems to be very keen as well.”

Fury has already engaged in verbal sparring with Joshua on Twitter, labelling 
his rival as a “weightlifter” in a reference to his toned body.

When asked about Fury’s comments, Joshua added: “I said I can give him some 
tips if he wants that beach body. He’s welcome to pop down my gym.

“Good luck to him, what he’s doing seems to be working so I’m not going to 
take anything away from him.”
