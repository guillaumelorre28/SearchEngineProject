Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here 
are two similar dilemmas – what are your thoughts?

I have worked in the business of employment advice so long I have become 
disillusioned about what transferable skills I have. I have dealt with 
customers who have been unemployed for decades, and helped those with severe 
disabilities and that are suicidal and in need of mental health assessments.

I first thought I could go into recruitment but after about six interviews I 
got told by every company that I am either “not hungry enough” or that I am 
“too nice” for recruitment.

My current job is not giving me the hours and I’m looking over my shoulder 
every day waiting for the boss to say “well this is your last day, they pulled 
the plug.”

I have all the experience in the world but not one qualification to my name. I 
have been promised qualifications many times but when I have asked about them 
the answer is usually “we’re trying to get the funding”.

Where else do I fit, what else can I do? I love helping people but recruitment 
thinks I’m not evil enough.

Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a
