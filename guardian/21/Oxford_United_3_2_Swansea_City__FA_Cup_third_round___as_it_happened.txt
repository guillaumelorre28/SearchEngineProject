What an extraordinary game that was. Oxford didn’t just pull down the pants of 
a supposedly superior opponent with underhand tactics and skullduggery, but by 
playing superb football and being much the better side. Maguire and Roofe were 
both superb, and Oxford fully deserve their place in the fourth round. Lovely 
stuff.

89 mins: Gomis thinks he’s in on goal, but the linesman’s flag goes up. 
Replays suggest that was level, though.

Final sub for Oxford, as Roofe goes off to a standing ovation, and is replaced 
by Patrick Hoban.

88 mins: “This is a sensational game of football, innit? Finally, a glimpse of 
the fabled magic...” writes Thabo Mokaleng. Quite so, Thabo.

The ball drops to Kingsley just outside the area, and while he does well to 
create a bit of space for a shot, the effort itself is limp and goes straight 
at Slocombe.

87 mins: Maguire - him again - chases back and tackles Kingsley as he tries to 
attack down the left. A brilliant all-round performance from the Rotherham 
loanee here.

85 mins: Big chance for Swansea now. Barrow uses his pace down the right, he 
cuts in then squares to Gomis, but his shot is blocked brilliantly by Mullins 
and it sails over the bar.

84 mins: All Oxford, here. O’Dowda cuts in from the left and shoots towards 
the top corner, but Nordfeldt does brilliantly to tip it over the bar. It’s not 
quite so much that Swansea can’t get in the game, more that they aren’t being 
allowed to.

78 mins: Maguire again threatens, but his low cross from the right is blocked. 
Oxford aren’t sitting back and defending this lead, which is probably a shrewd 
option - if they just defended, Swansea would probably manage to pick them 
apart.

75 mins: Big chance for Swansea on the counter. Shelvey plays a nice pass 
inside Baldock for Montero, who just sorts his feet out in time to shoot, but 
Slocombe does well to make the save.

“Is it me,” asks Alys, “or does this game epitomise the best and worst of 
football? I mean, it’s exciting and all, but I have literally watched 
Barnstaple Town play better than both of these teams.”

Bit harsh on Oxford, that. They’ve played some lovely stuff in spells.

74 mins: Shelvey loops a cross to the back post which drops in no-man’s land, 
but that’s partly because Montero didn’t move his arse in time to get there. 
It’s headed back to the keeper.

72 mins: Free-kick in a dangerous spot for Swansea, around 25 yards out to the 
right of centre. Grimes lines it up, but it flicks off the top of the wall, 
removing whatever sting was in the shot, and the save for Slocombe is made easy.

70 mins: Maguire cuts inside from the left, stumbles but immediately wins the 
ball back. He’s been excellent - Rotherham, from whom he’s on loan, only gave 
him permission to play in this game at the last minute.

69 mins: MacDonald tries to get around Kingsley on the right, but the sub 
offers rather more resistance than his predecessor in that position, the 
truculent Tabanou, and blocks him off.

66 mins: Lovely goal to get Swansea back into the game. Gomis gets the ball on 
the left corner of the box, passes inside the Cork them immediately goes for 
the return pass, which arrives post-haste, Gomis controls, opens his body and 
side-foot half-volleys into the far corner.

64 mins: Free-kick for Swansea out on the right, which Shelvey crosses over, 
but it loops past Bartley and Amat can’t direct it anywhere near the goal.

63 mins: “Hi there, how is Kristoffer doing it?” writes Max from Sweden, 
asking after young Nordfeldt. “Saw him break as a youngster in Brommapojkarna 
(west of Stockholm), his debut was a complete disaster, but he put that aside 
and worked on, which earned him a place in the national team. Strange decision 
to move to Swansea and warming the bench though.”

Well, it’s not going brilliantly so far, Max.

59 mins: Scenes! From the second corner, Oxford counter at some pace, firstly 
through Maguire, who squares to Roofe. He shoots, it’s half-saved by Nordfeldt 
but it loops up in the air and drops gently over the line.

56 mins: Roofe breaks into the area from the left and goes down under pressure 
from Bartley, but there was no foul there. In fact, Roofe was lucky not to be 
booked for diving, there. The ball returns to midfield and Shelvey goes in the 
book for a studs up challenge on Maguire, who’s still limping.

55 mins: Lundstrom embarks on an exercise to test the reflexes of his 
goalkeeper with a header back that dropped between Slocombe and Gomis, but the 
Oxford stopper got there just in time.

53 mins: Gomis picks the ball up just outside the area, turns and...well, 
technically that will be classed as a shot, but it dribbled rather 
apologetically wide.

51 mins: Swansea try to build something and get back into the game, but 
Tabanou gives the ball away and boots Roofe up in the air in trying to retrieve 
it. Actually, he had no hope of retrieving anything there, that was just 
pointless. He’s booked.

49 mins: What a goal that is! A long clearance falls to Taylor, who spreads to 
the left for Roofe. He cuts inside onto his right foot and he passes the ball 
into the far corner from the edge of the box. Lovely stuff.

46 mins: And we’re away. And Jordi Amat is in bother straight away for rather

Just a point of interest is that Swansea lobbied the relevant authorities to 
put their midweek game against Sunderland, scheduled for Tuesday, back a day on 
the basis they were playing today. And then they made ten changes for this 
game, which you’d assume they’ll change back for the league game. Hmmmm.

A most entertaining game so far. And now they’re playing ‘Don’t Stop Me Now’ 
by Queen over the PA. What more could you ask for? Well, ‘Good Old Fashioned 
Lover Boy’, perhaps.

challenge and went down, but was he touched? Possibly not. The penalty was 
straight down the middle, and Nordfeldt nearly got a trailing leg to it as he 
dived left, like Bodo Illgner vs Stuart Pearce in 1990.

player so far, and he wins a corner on the left.

41 mins: Good bit of scrapping in midfield sets up a chance for Roofe to run 
at the Swansea defence. He drifts past Tabanou like he wasn’t there, but the 
chipped cross goes into space, and behind a couple of attackers.

That’s all from this one, as the Kassam goes berserk.

Now it’s over to Alan Smith for Chelsea v Scunthorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jan/10/chelsea-v-scunthorpe-fa-cup-third-round-live>
 - will there be an upset there too? Find out. Please. If you want.
 
What an extraordinary game that was. Oxford didn’t just pull down the pants of 
a supposedly superior opponent with underhand tactics and skullduggery, but by 
playing superb football and being much the better side. Maguire and Roofe were 
both superb, and Oxford fully deserve their place in the fourth round. Lovely 
stuff.

They’ve done it!
 
90 mins + 3: Timmy Mallet checks his watch in the crowd. Genuinely. 
 
90 mins + 2: Oxford keeping the ball around the Swansea area brilliantly here. 
Hoban, Hilton, O’Dowda and Maguire all keep it out of harm’s way.
 
90 mins: Five minutes of added time. Sheesh. Tension, tension, tension. 
 
89 mins: Gomis thinks he’s in on goal, but the linesman’s flag goes up. 
Replays suggest that was level, though.

Final sub for Oxford, as Roofe goes off to a standing ovation, and is replaced 
by Patrick Hoban.
 
88 mins: “This is a sensational game of football, innit? Finally, a glimpse of 
the fabled magic...” writes Thabo Mokaleng. Quite so, Thabo.

The ball drops to Kingsley just outside the area, and while he does well to 
create a bit of space for a shot, the effort itself is limp and goes straight 
at Slocombe.
 
87 mins: Maguire - him again - chases back and tackles Kingsley as he tries to 
attack down the left. A brilliant all-round performance from the Rotherham 
loanee here.
 
85 mins: Big chance for Swansea now. Barrow uses his pace down the right, he 
cuts in then squares to Gomis, but his shot is blocked brilliantly by Mullins 
and it sails over the bar.
 
84 mins: All Oxford, here. O’Dowda cuts in from the left and shoots towards 
the top corner, but Nordfeldt does brilliantly to tip it over the bar. It’s not 
quite so much that Swansea can’t get in the game, more that they aren’t being 
allowed to.
 
83 mins: Baldock plays in from the right, for Sercombe in the box, but his 
shot on the turn never looked likely to threaten, and it loops over the bar.
 
81 mins: Oxford really aren’t just defending. Sercombe attacks down the right, 
but Bartley swoops over like an eagle, but an eagle wearing football boots, to 
mop up and clear.
 
79 mins: Another sub for Oxford, with Taylor coming off, and Danny Hilton 
coming on.

Meanwhile, yer man Alan Smith (not the former Arsenal striker, nor the love 
rat former Leeds forward) is on the MBM for Chelsea v Scunthorpe. Have Chelsea

78 mins: Maguire again threatens, but his low cross from the right is blocked. 
Oxford aren’t sitting back and defending this lead, which is probably a shrewd 
option - if they just defended, Swansea would probably manage to pick them 
apart.
 
77 mins: Quick detail on Maguire here, who was just doing keepy-uppies in his 
own corner before clearing...

@NickMiller79 <https://twitter.com/NickMiller79> Rotherham gave him permission 
to play once they crashed out of the cup themselves at the resurgent Leeds 
United yesterday.

76 mins: Sub for Swansea - Grimes is off, Modou Barrow is on. 
 
75 mins: Big chance for Swansea on the counter. Shelvey plays a nice pass 
inside Baldock for Montero, who just sorts his feet out in time to shoot, but 
Slocombe does well to make the save.

“Is it me,” asks Alys, “or does this game epitomise the best and worst of 
football? I mean, it’s exciting and all, but I have literally watched 
Barnstaple Town play better than both of these teams.”

Bit harsh on Oxford, that. They’ve played some lovely stuff in spells. 
 
74 mins: Shelvey loops a cross to the back post which drops in no-man’s land, 
but that’s partly because Montero didn’t move his arse in time to get there. 
It’s headed back to the keeper.
 
72 mins: Free-kick in a dangerous spot for Swansea, around 25 yards out to the 
right of centre. Grimes lines it up, but it flicks off the top of the wall, 
removing whatever sting was in the shot, and the save for Slocombe is made easy.
 
71 mins: Change for Oxford - MacDonald off, Callum O’Dowda on. 
 
70 mins: Maguire cuts inside from the left, stumbles but immediately wins the 
ball back. He’s been excellent - Rotherham, from whom he’s on loan, only gave 
him permission to play in this game at the last minute.
 
69 mins: MacDonald tries to get around Kingsley on the right, but the sub 
offers rather more resistance than his predecessor in that position, the 
truculent Tabanou, and blocks him off.
 
67 mins: What. A. Game. 
 
66 mins: Lovely goal to get Swansea back into the game. Gomis gets the ball on 
the left corner of the box, passes inside the Cork them immediately goes for 
the return pass, which arrives post-haste, Gomis controls, opens his body and 
side-foot half-volleys into the far corner.
 
GAME ON!

64 mins: Free-kick for Swansea out on the right, which Shelvey crosses over, 
but it loops past Bartley and Amat can’t direct it anywhere near the goal.
 
63 mins: “Hi there, how is Kristoffer doing it?” writes Max from Sweden, 
asking after young Nordfeldt. “Saw him break as a youngster in Brommapojkarna 
(west of Stockholm), his debut was a complete disaster, but he put that aside 
and worked on, which earned him a place in the national team. Strange decision 
to move to Swansea and warming the bench though.”

Well, it’s not going brilliantly so far, Max. 
 
61 mins: The Roofe, the Roofe, the Roofe is on fire.

(SPICY LANGUAGE WARNING - IT’S THE BLOODHOUND GANG)
 
60 mins: Change for Swansea, and Tabanou - taken off possibly before he’s sent 
off - is replaced by Stephen Kingsley.
 
59 mins: Scenes! From the second corner, Oxford counter at some pace, firstly 
through Maguire, who squares to Roofe. He shoots, it’s half-saved by Nordfeldt 
but it loops up in the air and drops gently over the line.
 
Well, well, well.

58 mins: Corner for Swansea on the left, which Shelvey skims over, and Cork 
heads, but it’s tipped over.
 
56 mins: Roofe breaks into the area from the left and goes down under pressure 
from Bartley, but there was no foul there. In fact, Roofe was lucky not to be 
booked for diving, there. The ball returns to midfield and Shelvey goes in the 
book for a studs up challenge on Maguire, who’s still limping.
 
55 mins: Lundstrom embarks on an exercise to test the reflexes of his 
goalkeeper with a header back that dropped between Slocombe and Gomis, but the 
Oxford stopper got there just in time.
 
53 mins: Gomis picks the ball up just outside the area, turns and...well, 
technically that will be classed as a shot, but it dribbled rather 
apologetically wide.
 
51 mins: Swansea try to build something and get back into the game, but 
Tabanou gives the ball away and boots Roofe up in the air in trying to retrieve 
it. Actually, he had no hope of retrieving anything there, that was just 
pointless. He’s booked.
 
49 mins: What a goal that is! A long clearance falls to Taylor, who spreads to 
the left for Roofe. He cuts inside onto his right foot and he passes the ball 
into the far corner from the edge of the box. Lovely stuff.

46 mins: And we’re away. And Jordi Amat is in bother straight away for rather 
pointlessly kicking out at Taylor after conceding a foul, for which he’s booked.
 
We’re back out for the second half. The sun is shining, the smell of blood 
remains in the air.
 
Just a point of interest is that Swansea lobbied the relevant authorities to 
put their midweek game against Sunderland, scheduled for Tuesday, back a day on 
the basis they were playing today. And then they made ten changes for this 
game, which you’d assume they’ll change back for the league game. Hmmmm.
 
A most entertaining game so far. And now they’re playing ‘Don’t Stop Me Now’ 
by Queen over the PA. What more could you ask for? Well, ‘Good Old Fashioned 
Lover Boy’, perhaps.
 
Peeeeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins + 2: Oxford attack again, which fizzles out but they’re very clearly 
worth being level at the break.
 
45 mins: Looking at the replay of the penalty decision there didn’t look to be 
a great deal of contact - MacDonald hurdled an admittedly rash looking 
challenge and went down, but was he touched? Possibly not. The penalty was 
straight down the middle, and Nordfeldt nearly got a trailing leg to it as he 
dived left, like Bodo Illgner vs Stuart Pearce in 1990.
 
And he sticks it away.

Bartley takes down MacDonald, and Oxford have a chance to equalise...

43 mins: More good work from Maguire, who has been Oxford’s most threatening 
player so far, and he wins a corner on the left.
 
41 mins: Good bit of scrapping in midfield sets up a chance for Roofe to run 
at the Swansea defence. He drifts past Tabanou like he wasn’t there, but the 
chipped cross goes into space, and behind a couple of attackers.
 
39 mins: Grimes drives towards goal, gets to the edge of the area and goes 
over the leg of Wright, but the referee deems it a dive and books the Swansea 
man.
