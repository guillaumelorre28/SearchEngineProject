Goals from Lionel Messi and Gerard Piqué enabled Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> to come from behind to beat 
Sevilla 2-1 at the Camp Nou and equal a Spanish record of 34 games without 
defeat in all competitions.

The visitors took the lead through Vitolo’s volley but a superb free-kick from 
Messi levelled the scores on the half-hour mark, and the Argentinian then laid 
on a pass for Piqué to put the Catalans in charge early in the second half.

Although Sevilla <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> continued to 
cause Barça problems, they held on to stay eight points ahead of Atlético 
Madrid at the top of the Primera División as well as drawing level with the 
unbeaten record set by Leo Beenhakker’s Real Madrid side in 1989.

Gary Neville’s four-game winning streak with Valencia came to an abrupt end 
with a 3-0 defeat toAthletic Bilbao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/athleticbilbao> following seven frantic 
minutes late in the second half.

Sabin Merino broke the deadlock in a tense and even game on 73 minutes and 
Iker Muniain and the formerValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> striker Aritz Aduriz added to 
the visitors’ lead in quick succession.

Neville, who called the referee a “joke” after the match for waving away two 
penalty appeals from Valencia, had seen his side beat Espanyol and Granada in 
the league and enjoyed back-to-back victories over Rapid Vienna in the Europa 
League but the late onslaught was too much to overcome.

José González made an immediate impact as Granada coach as his side lifted 
themselves off the bottom of the table with a 1-0 win over Deportivo La Coruña.
