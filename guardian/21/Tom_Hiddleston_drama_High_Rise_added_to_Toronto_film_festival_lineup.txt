The film, set in the 1970s, stars Tom Hiddleston as a doctor who moves into a 
luxurious yet isolated tower block, only to find the building is beset by a 
dangerous class divide that threatens to break out into violence. Sienna 
Miller, Jeremy Irons andElisabeth Moss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/elisabeth-moss> also star.

It’s the biggest project yet from Wheatley, who has received plaudits for Kill 
List, Down Terrace and A Field In England. In aninterview with io9 
<http://io9.com/doctor-who-director-says-capaldi-brings-back-the-classi-1515244187>
 in 2014, he described the style of High-Rise:

“I mean it’s going to look like the 70s,” he said. “It’s going to be very 
styled in that way. We’re looking at the Ridley Scott adverts of that period. 
It’s going to be modern in a way that the 70s looked ... back then they had a 
real idea of what the future was going to be like, and it was much more 
stylish.”

The film is part of the latest announcement of titles heading to Toronto, 
which also includes the world premieres of Sky, starring Diane Kruger and Lena 
Dunham, and second world war drama Land of Mine. These three films will join 
nine others in Platform <http://tiff.net/whats-on/news-events/platform-festival>
, a new juried programme that will result in an overall prize winner.

They all join previously announced films, including Lance Armstrong biopic The 
Program and Jake Gyllenhaal drama Demolition.
