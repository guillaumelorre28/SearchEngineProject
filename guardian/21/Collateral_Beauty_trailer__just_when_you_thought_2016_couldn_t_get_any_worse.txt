This has been an awful year. The world has taken one hopelessly regressive 
step after another. Everyone you admired has died. At times, it has felt like 
things couldn’t possibly get any worse.

And then the second trailer for the forthcoming Will Smith movie Collateral 
Beauty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/07/collateral-beauty-trailer-for-the-will-smith-movie-with-kate-winslet-video>
 was released. And now things are much worse than anyone could have imagined.

Collateral Beauty comes from the writer of the film where Kevin James became a 
cage-fighter, as well as the film where Jason Bateman gets drunk and 
artificially inseminates Jennifer Aniston with his sperm by mistake. But 
Collateral Beauty is different to those films.Collateral Beauty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/collateral-beauty> is, by some distance, 
stupider than those films. Look, here’s the trailer.

Meet Will Smith. He’s just been through an unthinkable tragedy. You know, just 
like the man Will Smith played in the Will Smith movieSeven Pounds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/16/seven-pounds-film-review>. The 
tragedy has caused him to ride his bike aimlessly around the city while saying 
things like “I’m trying to fix my mind” in such a halting way that it’s natural 
to assume that he’s some kind of savant.

Called it. However, unlike the Rubik’s Cube-loving savant that Will Smith 
played in the Will Smith movieThe Pursuit of Happyness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jan/12/willsmith.drama>, this Will Smith 
savant loves dominoes instead, which makes it a completely different movie. Why 
dominoes? At a guess, it’s because he’ll get to push them all over at the end 
of the film in a grindingly literal moment of sledgehammer symbolism.

Another way that this Will Smith savant differs from any past Will Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/willsmith> savants is that he writes letters. 
Not letters to people, you understand. No, he writes letters to abstract 
concepts like time and death and love. And then he posts them.

But the funniest thing happens. Somehow, just by writing the word “Death” on 
an envelope and posting it, the letter manages to get all the way toHelen Mirren
 <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/helen-mirren>. She miraculously knows 
where to find Will Smith and, even though she doesn’t actually ever open the 
envelope or read the letter or anything, she’s able to offer him a series of 
annoying platitudes about the nature of tragedy.

And then Time shows up too! His method of identification, as with Death, just 
involves showing Will Smith the letter he wrote. This either means that Will 
Smith’s pain has caused a rupture so profound that it’s allowed universal 
concepts to take on corporeal forms, or that a bunch of guys at the sorting 
office have decided to screw with him for kicks.

Annoyed that he’s inadvertently made a film about the benefits of Cosmic 
Ordering, which basically makes Collateral Beauty a terrible sort of Noel 
Edmonds: The Motion Picture, Will Smith gets on his bike and rides around some 
more.

“Don’t you understand?” Keira Knightley shouts while pulling that face again. 
“This whole thing is just an aggressively dopey remake of A Christmas Carol 
that lacks all the charm of the original because Will Smith wasn’t in the 
original, and Will Smith’s production company didn’t make the original, so
Dickens <https://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens> was never handed a 
set of notes suggesting that Ebenezer Scrooge should also be some sort of 
Beautiful Mind-style adorable genius whose skills manifest themselves in an 
advanced affinity for childrens’ toys. Also, in A Christmas Carol, every third 
line spoken by a side character didn’t reinforce the mistaken notion that 
Scrooge was some sort of troubled genius. Also, nobody in A Christmas Carol 
pulled a face that made them look as if they were going ‘BUHHH?’ whenever they 
spoke. That’s what I’m doing all the time! This is a stupid film and you should 
be genuinely ashamed of yourself.”

And then Kate Winslet <https://www.theguardian.com/film/katewinslet> does this 
with her face, because she’s in this film too. They’ve all clearly learned 
important lessons from this experience, apart from Will Smith who sneaks off to 
option a script about a dyslexic murderer who’s really good at Pop-Up Pirate or 
whatever.
