The Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> captain Tom Cairney 
admits that Newcastle should have had a penalty in the first half when Ryan 
Tunnicliffe blocked a Matt Ritchie cross with his arm, and that will surely be 
what Rafa Benítez reflects on after the game. Newcastle will feel hard done by, 
but at the same time they didn’t create enough clear chances to win the game.
 Plenty for Rafa to think about as he leaves the field at the end of the game.

A brilliant boost for Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> to 
pick up all three points.Goalscorer Matt Smith speaks: “I was delighted to see 
it hit the back of the net. We believed in ourselves, we setup very well 
defensively, and most importantly we defended well from set-pieces. It’s a 
benchmark, it’s something to work off, and it kickstarts our season.”

90+4 mins: Free-kick for Newcastle, surely their final chance... Shelvey 
drills a low ball at Armstrong who can only control the ball straight off the 
field for a goal-kick. That might just be that.

90 mins: Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> have the ball. 
Newcastle are running out of time and don’t look very threatening right now. 
Christensen runs the ball high up the pitch and wins a throw-in for the home 
side, to a huge cheer.

88 mins: Another penalty shout for Newcastle, another turned down by Simon 
Hooper. Dwight Gayle laid the ball off neatly for Matt Ritchie who smashed a 
shot at goal, but Kalas blocked the effort with his arms – which in fairness 
were tucked into his chest. Ritchie is fuming.

86 mins: Odoi breaks free from a tight space down the right and drills a pass 
into Christensen in the box. The teenager pauses, losing his man in the 
process, before slicing a shot high over the crossbar when he really should 
have tested Sels in the Newcastle goal.

74 mins: Ayite shows a flash of magic feet on the edge of the box before 
trying to bend a finish into the far corner, but his shot is plucked by Sels in 
the Newcastle goal. “In mitigation, and as Benitez made sure to remind everyone 
in his press conference before the game, it’s not amount you pay out that 
counts but rather thenet spending,” emails David Wall. “Clearly Newcastle 
should be considered underdogs for the season rather than favourites. Fact (not 
a fact).”

72 mins: Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> have briefly 
stemmed the flow of attacks from their visitors. Odoi charges down the right 
and is clattered to the floor by an overeager Dummett, who is booked.

68 mins: Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> are under huge 
pressure now. Another couple of whipped balls are dealt with, first by the 
excellent Madl and then by keeper Button. Jokanovic makes two changes: Matt 
Smith is replaced by the 21-year-old Lasse Vigen Christensen, and the 
35-year-old Scott ‘Scotty’ Parker comes on for Ryan Tunnicliffe.

66 mins: Kalas clobbers Ayoze Perez to the ground to hand Newcastle a 
free-kick 40 yards out. The forward dusts himself down before delivering a 
Harry-Kane-Euro-2016 sort of ball to nobody. A few moments later a much better 
cross finds Aarons, who chests it down eight yards out but totally miskicks his 
finish.

64 mins: Aarons takes up his place on the left wing, with Anita moving to the 
centre of Newcastle’s midfield. His first pass from the middle finds Matt 
Ritchie 25 yards out, who is allowed time to turn and flash a shot with that 
powerful left foot, but Button gets behind the strike and gathers into his 
chest.

61 mins: Newcastle go on the attack once more. Ritchie gets on the ball and 
puts his foot down, powering into the box before clipping a cross to Perez on 
the penalty spot, but the striker is under pressure and can only glance a 
header wide.

57 mins: Newcastle flood forward as Perez holds up the ball. He uses Janmaat 
on the overlap but the full-back’s cross is overhit and Fulham can 
counterattack. They move the ball quickly before a floated cross finds Matt 
Smith. The goalscorer rises and guides a header towards the arriving Aluko but 
it’sjust too far in front of the striker who is put off by Hanley. Had Aluko 
reached the ball there, six yards out,Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> would surely be two up.

54 mins: It should be level and Matt Ritchie knows it. Anita scurried down the 
left and pulled a bobbler back to the penalty spot for the arriving Scotland 
winger, but his low shot was blocked by the feet of Button. A good save, but 
the keeper shouldn’t have been allowed the chance to make one.

Peeeeep! Simon Hooper gives his whistle a puff and Fulham

second half. No changes at the break, although it appears Matt Ritchie has 
switched Newcastle’s right wing with Anita moving to the left.

“So Simon Hooper’s reffing this one, huh?” emails J.R. in Illinois. “Did you 
know he has refereed exactly one Premier League match? It was on opening day 
last season and I saw it. It was one of the worst refereeing performances I 
have ever seen. I guess maybe that’s why that was his one and only time in 
charge of a Premier League match. For the curious, the match he butchered was 
Norwich v Crystal Palace. Remember that overhead kick goal by Cameron Jerome he 
disallowed? And that was not his only horrible call. Among others, he also 
failed to award Norwich a penalty in extra time when Wickham absolutely 
steamrollered through Bassong’s back in the box. I’m keeping an eye on him. And 
right on cue he misses a stone cold hand ball penalty! Wow!” Refereeing is a 
sod of a job, let’s not forget, but it’s fair to say Mr Hooper hasn’t burnished 
his reputation with that call.

Half-time: Fulham 1-0 Newcastle

Simon Hooper blows his whistle, and that’s the perfect end to a pretty dreary 
half forFulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham>, a half in which 
Ryan Tunnicliffe was very fortunate not to concede a penalty. Things couldn’t 
have gone much worse for Rafa Benítez, who trudges off with a scratch of the 
nose. He has work to do at the break.

Matt Smith’s winner for Fulham ends Newcastle’s hopes on opening night

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/fulham-newcastle-united-championship-match-report> 
The Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> captain Tom Cairney 
admits that Newcastle should have had a penalty in the first half when Ryan 
Tunnicliffe blocked a Matt Ritchie cross with his arm, and that will surely be 
what Rafa Benítez reflects on after the game. Newcastle will feel hard done by, 
but at the same time they didn’t create enough clear chances to win the game.
 Plenty for Rafa to think about as he leaves the field at the end of the game.

A brilliant boost for Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> to 
pick up all three points.Goalscorer Matt Smith speaks: “I was delighted to see 
it hit the back of the net. We believed in ourselves, we setup very well 
defensively, and most importantly we defended well from set-pieces. It’s a 
benchmark, it’s something to work off, and it kickstarts our season.”
 
The whistle blows, and Fulham have stunned the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> favourites!
 
90+4 mins: Free-kick for Newcastle, surely their final chance... Shelvey 
drills a low ball at Armstrong who can only control the ball straight off the 
field for a goal-kick. That might just be that.
 
90+2 mins: A brilliant weaving run by Aarons bamboozles the Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> defence and he dinks a cross 
towards the back post, but Button does well to get a couple of fingertips to 
the ball and tip it clear.
 
90 mins: Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> have the ball. 
Newcastle are running out of time and don’t look very threatening right now. 
Christensen runs the ball high up the pitch and wins a throw-in for the home 
side, to a huge cheer.
 
88 mins: Another penalty shout for Newcastle, another turned down by Simon 
Hooper. Dwight Gayle laid the ball off neatly for Matt Ritchie who smashed a 
shot at goal, but Kalas blocked the effort with his arms – which in fairness 
were tucked into his chest. Ritchie is fuming.
 
86 mins: Odoi breaks free from a tight space down the right and drills a pass 
into Christensen in the box. The teenager pauses, losing his man in the 
process, before slicing a shot high over the crossbar when he really should 
have tested Sels in the Newcastle goal.
 
84 mins: Odoi shows another moment of high confidence, chesting the ball back 
to his goalkeeper cooly when defending at the back post.Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> make their final change of the 
night: Tim Ream replaces Scott Malone at right-back.
 
82 mins: “We are top of the league, we are top of the league!” sing the Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> fans.
 
80 mins: Odoi has just pulled off one of the skills of the season. Admittedly 
there are a few months left to go, but his control off back to get around Paul 
Dummett will take some beating.
 
78 mins: After a better spell by Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham>, Newcastle come forwards. 
Armstrong is looking particularly lively but lashes a long-range shot well wide.
 
76 mins: Isaac Hayden’s work is done, and he is replaced by Jonjo Shelvey in 
the Newcastle midfield, who swaggers on like he owns the place.

74 mins: Ayite shows a flash of magic feet on the edge of the box before 
trying to bend a finish into the far corner, but his shot is plucked by Sels in 
the Newcastle goal. “In mitigation, and as Benitez made sure to remind everyone 
in his press conference before the game, it’s not amount you pay out that 
counts but rather thenet spending,” emails David Wall. “Clearly Newcastle 
should be considered underdogs for the season rather than favourites. Fact (not 
a fact).”
 
72 mins: Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> have briefly 
stemmed the flow of attacks from their visitors. Odoi charges down the right 
and is clattered to the floor by an overeager Dummett, who is booked.
 
70 mins: Benítez makes a change of his own, with the teenager Adam Armstrong 
replacing the ineffective Ayoze Perez.
 
68 mins: Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> are under huge 
pressure now. Another couple of whipped balls are dealt with, first by the 
excellent Madl and then by keeper Button. Jokanovic makes two changes: Matt 
Smith is replaced by the 21-year-old Lasse Vigen Christensen, and the 
35-year-old Scott ‘Scotty’ Parker comes on for Ryan Tunnicliffe.
 
66 mins: Kalas clobbers Ayoze Perez to the ground to hand Newcastle a 
free-kick 40 yards out. The forward dusts himself down before delivering a 
Harry-Kane-Euro-2016 sort of ball to nobody. A few moments later a much better 
cross finds Aarons, who chests it down eight yards out but totally miskicks his 
finish.
 
64 mins: Aarons takes up his place on the left wing, with Anita moving to the 
centre of Newcastle’s midfield. His first pass from the middle finds Matt 
Ritchie 25 yards out, who is allowed time to turn and flash a shot with that 
powerful left foot, but Button gets behind the strike and gathers into his 
chest.
 
62 mins: Rolando Aarons replaces a fairly miffed Jack Colback. 
 
61 mins: Newcastle go on the attack once more. Ritchie gets on the ball and 
puts his foot down, powering into the box before clipping a cross to Perez on 
the penalty spot, but the striker is under pressure and can only glance a 
header wide.
 
59 mins: Ayite zooms down the left wing and guides another flat, hanging cross 
for Smith but it’s just too high and Sels can come out of his goal to gather.

57 mins: Newcastle flood forward as Perez holds up the ball. He uses Janmaat 
on the overlap but the full-back’s cross is overhit and Fulham can 
counterattack. They move the ball quickly before a floated cross finds Matt 
Smith. The goalscorer rises and guides a header towards the arriving Aluko but 
it’sjust too far in front of the striker who is put off by Hanley. Had Aluko 
reached the ball there, six yards out,Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> would surely be two up.
 
54 mins: It should be level and Matt Ritchie knows it. Anita scurried down the 
left and pulled a bobbler back to the penalty spot for the arriving Scotland 
winger, but his low shot was blocked by the feet of Button. A good save, but 
the keeper shouldn’t have been allowed the chance to make one.
 
52 mins: Two awful short corners end Newcastle’s spell of pressure and Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> break. They slow the play before 
McDonald and Aluko link. The former tries to scoop a pass towards Smith at the 
far post but Janmaat is under the ball to head clear.
 
50 mins: Dwight Gayle, who has been notably quiet so far, brings a cheer from 
the visiting fans with a some headed keepy-uppies. Newcastle eventually work 
the ball to the right where Gayle hustles a corner.
 
48 mins: Grant Hanley momentarily loses the ball under himself in the 
Newcastle box trying to clear a cross, but Aluko isn’t close enough to pounce 
on the mistake.
 
47 mins: Newcastle have started the half with plenty of purpose, and the Fulham
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> captain Cairney is forced into a 
misplaced pass off the pitch under pressure.
 
Peeeeep! Simon Hooper gives his whistle a puff and Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> get the ball rolling in the 
second half. No changes at the break, although it appears Matt Ritchie has 
switched Newcastle’s right wing with Anita moving to the left.
 
“So Simon Hooper’s reffing this one, huh?” emails J.R. in Illinois. “Did you 
know he has refereed exactly one Premier League match? It was on opening day 
last season and I saw it. It was one of the worst refereeing performances I 
have ever seen. I guess maybe that’s why that was his one and only time in 
charge of a Premier League match. For the curious, the match he butchered was 
Norwich v Crystal Palace. Remember that overhead kick goal by Cameron Jerome he 
disallowed? And that was not his only horrible call. Among others, he also 
failed to award Norwich a penalty in extra time when Wickham absolutely 
steamrollered through Bassong’s back in the box. I’m keeping an eye on him. And 
right on cue he misses a stone cold hand ball penalty! Wow!” Refereeing is a 
sod of a job, let’s not forget, but it’s fair to say Mr Hooper hasn’t burnished 
his reputation with that call.
