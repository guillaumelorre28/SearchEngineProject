Karl Robinson has been sacked by MK Dons following talks with the chairman, 
Pete Winkleman, on Sunday. Robinson had insisted he would not desert the club 
after the 3-0 home defeat against Southend on Saturday left MK Dons 19th in
League One <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> and without 
a win in four matches.

Robinson was expected to lead MK Dons into a promotion battle this term, but 
instead the club have struggled and the 36-year-old finalised his departure on 
Sunday.

“Milton Keynes Dons Football Club and Karl Robinson have today [Sunday] parted 
company by mutual consent,” read a club statement.

Richie Barker, the head of coaching, will step in as caretaker manager while 
MK Dons seek Robinson’s replacement.

Robinson became the Football League’s youngest manager aged 29 in 2010, later 
guiding the club to the Championship. But after four wins in 15 league matches 
this term, the MK Dons have moved to unseat the popular manager.

“The start to the Sky Bet League One campaign has been disappointing with 
results this season not matching the desired standard,” the statement said. 
“Therefore chairman Pete Winkelman and Robinson have agreed it is in the best 
interest of both parties to go their separate ways.

“Everyone at MK Dons <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> would like 
to thank Karl for his immense contribution – he will always remain a respected 
and significant figure at Stadium MK.”
