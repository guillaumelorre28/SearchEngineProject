A mostly youthful Chelsea side defeated Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> 5-0 in Matt Bloomfield’s 
testimonial at Adams Park.

Patrick Bamford, who ended last season on loan at Derby, scored the only goal 
of the first half after Nathan Aké’s assist but Wanderers could not stop the 
visitors extending the margin in the second half.

The teenagers Jay Dasilva and Isaiah Brown combined when the latter made it 
2-0 shortly after half-time before John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic, two of 
the more established players given a run-out by theChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> manager, José Mourinho, 
converted set pieces from Jeremie Boga.

Brown clinched his second goal of the night late on.

The Wycombe midfielder Bloomfield had said before the match that his 
testimonial would evoke memories of a highlight of his career. The 30-year-old, 
who joined Wycombe from Ipswich in 2003, was part of the Chairboys side that 
held Chelsea to a 1-1 draw in a League Cup semi-final first-leg tie in 2007. 
Chelsea went on to win the return game 4-0.
