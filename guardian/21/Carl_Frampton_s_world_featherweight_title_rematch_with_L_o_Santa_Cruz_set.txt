Carl Frampton will defend his WBA world featherweight title against Léo Santa 
Cruz at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on 28 January next year.

The two-weight world champion had announced the rematch for his WBA world 
featherweight belt with Santa Cruz last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/20/carl-frampton-wba-world-featherweight-title-rematch-leo-santa-cruz-boxing>
, but did not reveal the details of the fight in terms of date or venue.

However, Frampton confirmed the news on his Twitter account, saying: “It’s 
official! The rematch vs @leosantacruz2 is set for MGMGrand Las Vegas, January 
28th. WE’RE BRINGING AN ARMY #AndStill.”

Frampton followed the post with a video of him singing a rendition of Elvis 
Presley’s ‘Viva Las Vegas’

defeated Santa Cruz on a majority decision at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn 
in July

.

The fight was Frampton’s first at featherweight, where he became Northern 
Ireland’s first world champion at two weight divisions.

Frampton initially wanted the rematch to take place in his hometown of 
Belfast, but acknowledged that it may have been a struggle to secure a venue 
big enough for the event before announcing the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

Frampton took his first world title when he beat Spain’s Kiko Martínez on a 
points decision

 in their super bantamweight IBF title fight in September 2014.
