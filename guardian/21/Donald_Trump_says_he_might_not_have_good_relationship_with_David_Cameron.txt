Donald Trump has said he might not have a “very good relationship” with David 
Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron>, after the prime 
minister described his proposal to ban Muslims from the US as “stupid”.

The US presidential hopeful also sniped at the new London mayor, Sadiq Khan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan>, for comments he made after 
being elected and warned him: “I will remember those statements.” He challenged 
Khan to “take an IQ test” after the mayor called him ignorant.

Clinton in November’s presidential election, wasspeaking to Piers Morgan

Last week Khan said Trump was ignorant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/sadiq-khan-i-dont-want-ignorant-donald-trump-to-make-me-an-exception>
 in his views on Islam and risked harming security on both sides of the 
Atlantic. Trump said in response: “When he won I wished him well, and now I 
don’t care about him. Let’s see how he does, let’s see if he’s a good mayor.

“He doesn’t know me, hasn’t met me, doesn’t know what I’m all about. I think 
they were very rude statements and frankly, tell him I will remember those 
statements. They are very nasty statements.”

Trump also attacked Cameron’s comments on his proposed “Muslim ban”, which the 
prime minister had called “divisive, stupid and wrong”.

Sadiq Khan: Donald Trump’s views on Muslims are ignorant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/16/sadiq-khan-donald-trump-muslims-ignorant-video>
Trump said: “Honestly, I don’t care, it doesn’t matter. It looks like we’re 
not going to have a very good relationship. I hope to have a good relationship 
with him, but it sounds like he’s not willing to address the problem either.

“Number one, I’m not stupid, I can tell you that right now, just the opposite. 
I don’t think I’m a divisive person, I’m a unifier, unlike our president now.”

The Republican indicated his continued support for the campaign for Britain to 
leave the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-brexit-uk-leaving-european-union>
. “A lot of the migration and a lot of the acceptance of people is because of 
the European Union, I think that’s been a disaster,” he said.


“I think if I was from Britain I would want to go back to a different system. 
I’ve dealt with the European Union and it’s very bureaucratic. Personally, in 
terms of Britain, I would say: what do you need it for?”

He rebuffed Barack Obama’s claim that the UK would be at the “back of the 
queue” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/barack-obama-brexit-uk-back-of-queue-for-trade-talks>
when it came to making a new trade deal with the US. “You have to make your own 
deal,” he said. “Britain’s been a great ally. They’ve been such a great ally 
they’ve gone into things they shouldn’t have gone into, for example going into 
Iraq. With me, they’ll always be treated fantastically.

“I’m not going to say front of the queue but it wouldn’t make any difference 
to me whether they were in the EU or not. You would certainly not be back of 
the queue, that I can tell you.”

Downing Street said Cameron stood by past criticisms of Trump but added he 
would seek to maintain the UK’s close relationship with the US even if Trump 
becomes president.

The prime minister’s spokesman said: “The PM has made his views on Donald Trump
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> very clear. He disagrees 
with them. He continues to believe that preventing Muslims from entering the US 
would be divisive, stupid and wrong.

“He has also been clear that he will work with whoever is president of the 
United States.”

Asked whether the special relationship would continue, the spokesman added: 
“He is committed to continuing the special relationship.”

Khan’s spokesman said on Monday morning. “Donald Trump’s views are ignorant, 
divisive and dangerous – it’s the politics of fear at its worst and will be 
rejected at the ballot box just as it was in London.

“Sadiq has spent his whole life fighting extremism, but Trump’s remarks make 
that fight much harder for us all – it plays straight into the extremists’ 
hands and makes both our countries less safe.”

He said the mayor would not accept Trump’s offer that the two should compare 
IQ scores. “Ignorance is not the same thing as lack of intelligence.”

Later, Khan himself, speaking to journalists about London’s housing crisis, 
said he was not interested in “picking a fight” with Trump but he still 
believed the Republican was ignorant.

“Donald Trump said I would be the exception to his rule, that I would be the 
one Muslim that would be allowed to go to America,” he said. “The point I made 
about Donald Trump making me the exception was that there is nothing 
exceptional about me.

“What about my friends and family, what about business people who want to go 
and do business in America and happen to be Muslim? What about young people who 
want to be students in America and happen to be Muslim? What about people who 
want to go on holiday to America and visit Disneyland? The views of Donald 
Trump and his advisers on Islam are ignorant.”

A spokesperson for Hillary Clinton attacked Trump for “cast[ing] aside our 
most important allies when their leaders criticize his dangerous proposals” and 
said: “Trump continues to demonstrate that his reckless, shoot-from-the-hip 
approach to foreign policy would make the country and the world far less safe.”
