The 19-year-old has attracted the interest of several Premier League clubs and 
the Norwich manager, Alex Neil, told his club’s official website: “We’re 
delighted to sign James as he is a fantastic prospect who has already made a 
mark at Coventry at such a young age.

“He has real potential to develop, making this deal one we’re really pleased 
to get over the line. James will return on loan to Coventry for the rest of the 
season to continue his development before joining up with us on a full-time 
basis in the summer.”

Maddison is Norwich’s eighth signing of the winter transfer window, following 
Matt Jarvis, Ivo Pinto, Timm Klose, Steven Naismith and Patrick Bamford, plus 
future prospects Ben Godfrey and Ebou Adams.
