According to the very first words in your front-page story (Chancellor to 
crack down on letting fees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/22/philip-hammond-letting-fees-ban-autumn-statement-affordable-housing>
, 23 November) “millions of families” are to be offered relief from spurious 
letting charges. Funny, I hadn’t realised that the measure was targeted only at 
families – I guess this must mean that people living alone, house-sharers and 
childless couples will have to go on paying the fees? Can you please make an 
effort not to bandy about the word “families” as though it were a synonym for 
“people”?

• I was leaning on a gate the other day, looking at the view, trying to figure 
out why November can often seem the best autumn month. Paul Evans expressed 
these feelings so beautifully (Country Diary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/23/all-colours-november-evening-country-diary-wenlock-edge>
, 23 November). Wonderful!

• I was intrigued by the term “Ukip doner” in your piece “Farage fans toast 
golden year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/23/the-shambassadors-reception-tycoons-are-spoiling-nigel-farage>
” (24 November, early editions). Given that Ukip and fellow Brexiters have 
thoroughly kebabbed much of the economy, is this an example of a Freudian typo?

• “Scientists alarmed at record Arctic temperatures” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/22/extraordinarily-hot-arctic-temperatures-alarm-scientists>
, 23 November). Why are our politicians not alarmed?

• The far right is getting a lot of press these days – a lot more coverage 
than movements around which people can resist this drift to the right. Words 
like “dismay”, used to describe the feelings of the unfeeling, dismay me. The 
far right are “not happy”, “disgruntled”, “angry”. I don’t want to know about 
their “dismay” (Donald Trump’s ‘alt-right’ supporters express dismay at 
disavowal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/alt-right-supporters-donald-trump-backlash-disavow-reddit-4chan>
, theguardian.com, 23 November). I don’t want to find myself inadvertently 
feeling sorry for them.

• I scanned your online front page on Friday: uncontrollable climate change, 
impossible crises, Brexit, Trump et al. I’d like to congratulate your staff 
on just getting up in the morning.
