A family from Oldham have been bombarded with phone calls from Soulja Boy fans 
after the rapper inadvertently featured their number in his recent song,Kiss Me 
Thru the Phone <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDFV0QqP57Q>.

"It's easy to understand that, isn't it? When you look at me, I've got the 
perfect profile for a rapper," joked 54-year-old Oldham native Gerry Matley. 
His wife, Catriona Smith, said: "They have asked if I am his girlfriend but I 
think I am a bit too old, even forSoulja Boy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/soulja-boy>."

According to the couple, theirs is the 12-digit number that features in the 
opening lines of Kiss Me Thru the Phone, which reached No 6 in the UK charts in 
May. The number is ex-directory, and the couple have no idea how it came to 
feature in the song of a 18-year-old rapper from Atlanta. "It's like winning 
the lottery, but we haven't got any money for it."

Despite receiving calls around the clock, sometimes as late as 3am, the couple 
have reacted to the bizarre event with good humour. "One of my daughter's 
friends thinks he's living in the loft," said Smith.

There has been no comment from Soulja Boy as to why the couple's number 
appears in his song or whether he has a particular fondness for Oldham.
