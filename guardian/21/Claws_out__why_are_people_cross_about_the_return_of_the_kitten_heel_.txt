Kitten heels are back. Vogue has said so 
<http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/kitten-heels-are-back-in-fashion-vogue>, and 
Twitter has howled in laughter 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4087632/Vogue-ridiculed-declaring-kitten-heels-making-comeback.html>
. Maybe it’s the memory of all those prissy ladies-who-lunch heels. Although 
they never really left, especially not in branches of LK Bennett. Or maybe 
Theresa May is responsible for this distaste. Shedebuted her leopard-print 
kitten back in 2002 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/12/the-not-so-hidden-meaning-of-theresa-may-s-leopard-print-kitten-heels.html>
 when the heel shape was still in its prime. But still, no one wants to wear 
the same shoes as the PM, and I say that as someone who shared with Margaret 
Thatcher a predilection for theSalvatore Ferragamo Vara 
<http://www.ferragamo.com/shop/en/uk/women/shoes/pumps-3074457345616735320--1/vara-539449--1>
.

But despite the protestations kitten heels are not only back, they are back in 
the places that count.

At Gucci, there is a kitten heel that looks like a bamboo spindle 
<https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/product/810126?cm_mmc=ProductSearchPLA-_-GB-_-Pumps-Gucci-Google&cm_mmc=GoogleUK--c-_-NAP_EN_UK_PLA-_-UK+-+GS+-+Designers+-+Med--Gucci-_-__pla-67370328471_INTL&gclid=CjwKEAiA79zDBRCgyf2FgeiY-CESJABzr0BM-ZuduH6anRXTKZlq5efJe7g4k0CsOIv5Dl0aIJCTWRoC2IXw_wcB>
, a short, sharp twist of cane. Vetements has collaborated with Manolo Blahnik, 
to create a beautiful satin kitten shape with a cutaway slingback heel. And 
Dior has what was once called – and presumably this sounded OK back in the days 
when language was less aspirational – a “toilet pan heel”.


There is no point getting angry now. It is too late.


In fact, the kitten has been coming for a while, having crept back into 
fashion via the mid-heel, which has broken out every few years over the past 
decade, in forms ranging from a block to a low wedge.

Is it the harmlessness of kitten heels that makes them so scorned? Though 
Amber Rudd probably doesn’t see them as entirely innocuous 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/10/curse-home-secretarys-shoe/> after 
getting hers stuck in the paving outside No10 earlier this week. Generally, 
though, a stiletto is a weapon, while a kitten seems boringly safe. The 
practical advantages that might recommend them also make them seem dull. But 
here goes anyway: you can walk for hours in them without getting foot-ache, and 
they give more of a lift than flats. They can look sportive – they work well 
with joggers – and I think they have more sense of humour than a pair of 
stilettos.

That Gucci bamboo, for instance, is a narrow exclamation mark of a heel, a 
point that can’t be missed if you take in the two red jewels on the front like 
a pair of steroidal strawberries. The Dior slingbacks are appealing partly 
because of the “J’ADIOR” logo that decorates the ribbon ties, an amusing riff 
on “J’ador Dior”.


It is a feat of engineering to go from the width of a woman’s heel to a 
pinhead in just an inch or two. Getting there – whether it’s in a narrow stack 
as at Gucci, or the sleek cursive of Balenciaga’s slanting kitten – is all part 
of the fun.
