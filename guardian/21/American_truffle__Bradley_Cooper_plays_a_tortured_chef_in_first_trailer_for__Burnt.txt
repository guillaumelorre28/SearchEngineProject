After Oscar nominations for three years running, Bradley Cooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradley-cooper> is hoping to impress the 
Academy again with a lead role in Burnt.

Originally titled Chef, before Jon Favreau stole his thunder, and then the 
rather bland Adam Jones, Cooper’s latest film sees him star as a chef at the 
top of his game who then loses it all. In an attempt to regain his reputation, 
he works his way back to the top with a new restaurant in London.

The first trailer hints at a major focus on food porn (every other shot looks 
like an Instagram post) and a starry supporting cast, including Cooper’s 
American Sniper wife Sienna Miller, Jamie Dornan, Uma Thurman,Emma Thompson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-thompson>, Alicia Vikander, Omar Sy and 
Daniel Brühl. Cooper’s played a chef before, in the failed 2005 series Kitchen 
Confidential, but he’s hoping this one doesn’t get sent back with complaints.

His preparation for the film has veered from reportedly getting lessons from 
Gordon Ramsay

It’s directed by John Wells, whose last film was Oscar bait drama August: 
Osage County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/23/august-osage-county-review> and 
scripted by Steven Knight, who was most recently behind the Tom Hardy thriller
