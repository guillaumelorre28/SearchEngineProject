The former Italy manager Cesare Prandelli will take charge of Valencia after 
agreeing a contract until 2018. The Italian has been in negotiations with
Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> in the last week and 
finalised a deal with the La Liga club’s president Lay Hoon Chan on Saturday.

He will watch Sunday’s La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> game against Atlético 
Madrid at the Mestalla before being presented to the media on Monday, after 
which he will take his first training session.

“I’m very happy to be here in Valencia at a glorious club. I’m looking forward 
to starting work,” Prandelli said. The caretaker manager Voro González, who has 
guided the team to consecutive wins over Alaves and Leganes since temporarily 
succeeding sacked coach Pako Ayestaran, will take charge against Atlético.

Valencia have six points from six games this season. 

A European Cup winner with Juventus as a player, Prandelli’s professional 
coaching career spans almost two decades since he took charge of the Italian 
club Lecce in 1997.

His appointment, Valencia’s eighth since parting ways with Unai Emery in 2012, 
represents a break from the club’s recent habit of hiring coaches with limited 
experience.

Ayestaran had just three years’ experience as a first-team coach in Mexico and 
Israel, while Gary Neville, who took charge in December 2015and was sacked four 
months later 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/30/gary-neville-leaves-valencia-immediate-effect>
, had never been a first-team coach before.

Prandelli’s longest club spell was with Fiorentina, between 2005 and 2010, 
after which he became Italy manager, guiding the team to the Euro 2012 final 
which they lost 4-0 to Spain.

Under him, Italy failed to qualify from their group in the 2014 World Cup and 
Prandelli resigned immediately after their elimination.

He became Galatasaray’s manager in July 2014 but was sacked by the Turkish 
club four months later.
