Leicester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity> have 
signed the Japanese striker Shinji Okazaki from Mainz, subject to a work permit 
and international clearance. The 29-year-old moves to the King Power Stadium 
for an undisclosed fee.

He becomes Leicester’s third summer signing after Robert Huth and Christian 
Fuchs. Okazaki has signed a four-year deal. He has scored 43 goals in 93 games 
for Japan and struck nine times in the Bundesliga for Mainz last season.

Okazaki told Leicester’s website: “I am very happy to be here. To play in the 
Premier League is my dream and I will make every effort to help the team here 
at Leicester City. I will do my best to show how I can play and try to make a 
lot of goals for the supporters.

“I watched every match [last season] in the Premier League. Not all of them 
are easy. There were hard games.

“In the last few games the crowd were great and the players responded. It was 
an amazing result at the end of the season.”
