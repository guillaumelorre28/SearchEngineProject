The number of workers taking claims of unfair dismissal or discrimination to 
employment tribunals has slumped since charges came into force, a study has 
revealed.

Unfair dismissal claims have fallen by 73% and there have been huge reductions 
in discrimination cases on grounds of sex (71%), race (58%) and disability 
(54%), since charges of up to £1,200 were introduced, the Trades Union Congress 
said.

The number of workers taking claims to a tribunal averaged 16,000 a month in 
2012-13, but that figure fell to 7,000 in the past year, the TUC said.

The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “These figures show a huge 
drop in workers seeking justice when they’ve been unfairly treated. Now bosses 
know they can get away with it, discrimination at work can flourish unchecked 
and people can be sacked without good reason.

“The evidence is there for all to see. These fees – of up to £1,200, even if 
you’re on the minimum wage – are pricing out thousands each month from pursuing 
cases.

“Theresa May has repeatedly said she wants to govern for ordinary working 
people. Here is a perfect opportunity. She could reverse employment tribunal 
fees, and make sure workers can challenge bad employers in court.”

The government is being urged to abolish the fees in this month’s autumn 
statement.
