Graham Westley, the Stevenage <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stevenage> 
manager, has revealed that police are looking into an accusation from the 
defender Ronnie Henry that he was bitten on the hand by the Dagenham & 
Redbridge midfielder Joss Labadie in their 1-0 home defeat on Saturday.

Labadie served a 10-match ban and was fined £2,000 in March 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/12/joss-labadie-biting-ban-torquay>
 for biting Chesterfield’s Ollie Banks in a League Two match while playing for 
Torquay - a charge which he denied.

Westley claimed Henry was “horrified” by Saturday’s alleged incident which 
happened shortly before full-time and said: “I think it has become a police 
matter and when it becomes a police matter anybody in a responsible position 
should let it be dealt with by the authorities.

“So, in passing comment, word is around the place that there’s been an 
incident and the police are involved.

“He’s [Henry] not in a good situation, he’s in the treatment room and he’s 
suffered quite a nasty injury.

“Ronnie was in a state of shock, you don’t go on a football pitch expecting to 
lose your finger and Ronnie was horrified by what has gone on because it’s a 
football match and he’s nearly lost his finger.”

The game had already threatened to boil over before Labadie and Henry’s clash 
due to the nature of Dagenham’s winning goal.

Labadie was clearly offside when a long ball was played forwards in his 
direction yet he did not touch it, Christian Doidge took over and crossed for 
Dean Howell to score.

But only after long consultation with his assistant did the referee Dean 
Whitestone award the goal.
