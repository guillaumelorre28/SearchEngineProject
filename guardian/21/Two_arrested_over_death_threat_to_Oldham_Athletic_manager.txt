Police were called to Boundary Park stadium on Monday after the club received 
the letter which threatened Darren Kelly.

Kelly, who is from Northern Ireland, has denied claims that he is a supporter 
of the IRA since he was appointed manager at the League One club last week.

Two men, aged 27 and 42, were arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill 
and remain in custody, Greater Manchester police said.

“The letter sent to the club made some extremely serious threats to a number 
of individuals and we are treating this matter with the utmost seriousness,” DI 
Jason Byrne said.

“We are also aware of equally vitriolic comments that have been made on social 
media and this too forms part of our investigation.

“We have made two arrests and anticipate more. Another man knows we are keen 
to speak to him and I would stress that it is in his best interests to come 
forward.

“I would also ask anyone who has information about the letter or those behind 
it to contact us.”

Some fans have threatened to boycott Oldham’s matches following the decision 
to employ Kelly.

Oldham caused controversy in December when the club was in talks to sign 
convicted rapist Ched Evans

, before pulling out of the deal after a number of sponsors threatened to 
withdraw their backing.
