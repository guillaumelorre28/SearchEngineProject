I have just scoured eight pages of your Climate Change supplement (7 
December). I found not a single reference to one of the key drivers of climate 
change, the relentless increase of population, now scheduled to be 11.5 billion 
by 2100. Whatever action we take to reduce emissions, those efforts will be 
negated by the births of 4 billion more people who, even in the old “third 
world”, will want to be consumers.

• Theresa May is right to dislike acronyms (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/07/theresa-may-criticises-civil-servants-for-not-speaking-their-minds>
, 8 December) but it’s time she considered her cliches. I suggest she takes a 
blue pencil to her sentence “I’m talking about ordinary working people for whom 
life is a bit of struggle …”. There are people who are too old or otherwise 
unable to work for whom life is a struggle. And who are ordinary people? I 
would hope they are those who do not have to struggle to make ends meet.

• In the interest of good taste (no pun intended), wasn’t it a bit insensitive 
to publishSuzanne Moore’s article 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/07/politicians-have-got-what-they-wanted-more-uk-workers-in-poverty-than-ever-before>
 explaining how “more UK workers live in poverty than ever before” on page 5 of 
G2 (8 December) – with its photo of a food bank – and then, on page 9, have
Tamal Ray recommend a panettone from Selfridges costing £24.99

• “The problem has arisen as a result of an explosion in the numbers of 
diamondback moths arriving in the UK from Europe” (Brussels sprout ‘super pest’ 
threatens Christmas dinner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/07/uk-brussels-sprout-harvest-hit-by-super-pest-moths>
, 8 December). Ah yes, those European moths, coming over here, eating our good 
old British sprouts.
