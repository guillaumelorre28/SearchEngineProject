Atlético Madrid got their league season back on track with a 2-0 victory over 
Espanyol on Sunday.

Atlético lost 3-1 at Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> 
before the international break to leave the defending champions in fifth place, 
but goals from Tiago and Mario Suárez ensured they returned to winning ways.

The victory saw Atlético move up to fifth with 17 points from eight games, 
whileEspanyol <https://www.theguardian.com/football/espanyol> slipped to 10th.

Sevilla sit second after second-half goals from Carlos Bacca and Kevin Gameiro 
saw them beatElche 2-0 and take full advantage of Valencia’s 3-0 defeat away to 
Deportivo La Coruña.

Unai Emery’s men managed just three shots on target all game against a 
determined Elche side but took the lead just before the hour mark, Bacca 
knocking a rebound over the line following a well-struck free-kick from Gerard 
Deulofeu.

Gameiro, on as a substitute, then put the game out of the hosts’ reach by 
nodding in a cross from Denis Suárez with 17 minutes to go.

That result came after Deportivo had stunned Valencia. Victor Fernández’s men 
had taken just four points from their first sevenLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> matches, losing four 
games in a row, while the visitors had not lost.

The Riazor stadium, though, was celebrating as an own goal from Valencia 
defender Jose Gaya put the home side ahead on 36 minutes, with midfielder Lucas 
Pérez adding a second just before the break.

The substitute Jose Toché wrapped things up late in the second half to move 
Deportivo out of the bottom three.

Ikechukwu Uche scored twice as Villarreal moved up to sixth with a 2-0 win over
Almería.
