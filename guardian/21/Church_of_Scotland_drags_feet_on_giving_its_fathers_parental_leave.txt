leave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/05/shared-parental-leave-slow-take-up-fathers-paternity>
, 5 April) was a welcome read. I am a Church of Scotland minister. I applied 
for shared parental leave (hoping to become one of the 2%-8% in the UK), and my 
wife and I had made plans accordingly. The church refused on the grounds that 
the general assembly had not yet voted on the legislation. I am informed that 
it will vote in May 2016, but that the parental right to shared leave will not 
be backdated to include me. At least the parish and congregation have been 
understanding and I am able to work “flexi-time” to try to fit work with 
parenting responsibilities. It is not quite the same as shared parental leave, 
but it seems this is the best we can hope for in the church for the time being.
