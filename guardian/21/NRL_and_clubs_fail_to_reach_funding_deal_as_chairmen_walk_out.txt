The NRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> has failed to close a damaging 
rift with clubland after four club chairmen walked out on talks at Rugby League 
Central on Wednesday.

The meeting looked ill-fated when North Queensland’s Laurence Lancini, 
Cronulla’s Damian Keogh, Canterbury’s Ray Dibb and Melbourne’s Bart Campbell 
left a meeting of the game’s heavy hitters after just 30 minutes.

It is thought the move came after the governing body took off the table a 
proposal to fund clubs 130% of the salary cap from 2018 onwards.

The NRL, represented by ARL commission chairman John Grant and chief executive 
Todd Greenberg, reasoned it should concentrate on the collective bargaining 
agreement and setting the salary cap before tackling club funding.

Its position was there was little point negotiating club funding as a 
proportion of the salary cap while it’s unknown how much the salary cap will be.

Last December the NRL and its clubs agreed in principle to that increased 
funding in exchange for signing perpetual licences, which would eliminate the 
possibility of a Super League-style breakaway competition.

However clubs have since baulked at proposed terms including that they 
contribute to a sinking fund which would bail out clubs that go into 
receivership.

The NRL’s inability to come to an agreement over the last 11 months has become 
a source of concern and frustration with some clubs.
