Bradford’s chairman Marc Green has revealed the Bulls have been placed into 
administration. The Championship club faced a winding-up petition by HM Revenue 
and Customs last month due to a tax dispute.

“I have been talking to a number of serious investors and purely the pressure 
from HMRC has forced the club to be put into this position to save its future,” 
Green said ina statement published on the club’s official website

“There is a dispute between ourselves and HMRC which we have been working hard 
to resolve since the winding-up petition was issued and despite two 
adjournments from the courts to resolve this matter we have been unable to do 
so. We were concerned over the ability to secure a third adjournment and 
therefore this action became unavoidable to protect the club.

“I will be working closely with the administrators over the coming weeks and 
it is my intention to regain this club from them within the shortest 
practicable time frame.”

He further stated: “Regardless of whether I remain at the helm of this great 
club, I will ensure all memberships already purchased for next season will 
remain valid, as will the offer under which they were purchased. I believe the 
future ofBradford Bulls <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradfordbulls> is 
still strong.”
