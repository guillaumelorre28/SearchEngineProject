Lewandowski, who scored five times in nine minutes after coming on as a 
substitute against Wolfsburg last Tuesday, struck again in the 63rd minute, 
rounding the home goalkeeper Loris Karius for his 10th goal in seven matches, a 
feat only achieved in the past by Gerd Müller in the 1968-69 and 1977-78 
seasons. The winger Kingsley Coman added Bayern’s third five minutes later.

Bayern, who play Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League at the Allianz Stadium 
on Tuesday, are top of the table on 21 points with Borussia Dortmund, who play 
Darmstadt on Sunday, in second place on 16.
