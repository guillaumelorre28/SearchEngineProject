Winds of up to 94mph have damaged properties, torn down trees and caused 
travel problems in parts ofWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>.

Aberystwyth, on the mid-Wales coast, was worst affected when powerful gusts 
swept across the area, resulting in road closures.

Police said no injuries were reported, but a number of caravans were 
overturned and several roofs were left damaged.

The Met Office and Meteogroup said they had yet to confirm reports that a 
tornado had hit the area.

Smashed windows and the wreckage of one overturned caravan were pictured on 
social media, while a video showed a metal frame being blown down some steps.

Absolute carnage. Emergency services on scene. Everyone is safe though.

Trees and roof tiles were blown on to roads, with several having to be closed, 
Dyfed-Powys police said.

The Aberystwyth lifeboat station recorded winds of 82 knots (94mph) shortly 
after 10.30am on Thursday.

Although 94mph is a higher windspeed than the 74mph required to be classed as 
a hurricane <http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php>, forecasters said the wind 
came in surges and did not last long enough to be described as such.

Meteogroup said the “extreme winds” swept inland across mid Wales towards 
Shrewsbury over the course of Thursday.

In the village of Shawbury, Shropshire, wind speeds of 84mph were recorded.

Meanwhile, forecasters said snow could arrive

 in parts of the UK overnight, with several centimetres expected in the 
Pennines.
