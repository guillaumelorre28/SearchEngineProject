Fury agreed to fight the Ukrainian again, which meant he was stripped of the 
IBF title for failing to face its mandatory challenger, although an original 
date in July had to be scrapped after the 28-year-old picked up an ankle injury.

It has been a long road to get the two back into the ring again, with 
Klitschko recently revealing he intended to go to court over the negotiations 
of a rematch with the controversial Fury.

Shortly after Fury postponed the original date due to his ankle problem, the 
Sunday Mirror reported the 28-year-old had been the subject of a doping 
investigation last year– something the heavyweight strenuously denied in a 
statement.

In August UK Anti-Doping revealed Fury had been provisionally suspended in 
June over the presence of a prohibited substance, althoughthe ban had been 
lifted pending an independent hearing

.

Fury has been back in training since late August and alluded to the 29 October 
date, that has now been confirmed.
