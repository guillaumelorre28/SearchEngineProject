Several correspondents in France have referred to the owls which find the 
trenches such profitable mouseries that they hunt by day. The latest note on 
the subject comes from one of our south coast camps, where a light brown owl – 
probably a barn owl – found daylight sport anything but peaceful. The lads who 
were watching it were not the trouble, but a number of gulls resented its 
presence, “and flew excitedly around it,” though apparently they did not 
venture to attack the unusual-looking bird. Then a rook, no doubt attracted by 
the calls of the gulls, came along, flying above the owl. It darted upon the 
mouse-hunter, striking it on the back with its beak, and down fell the owl. “We 
saw it no more,” writes my correspondent, but it does not follow that the owl 
was slain; a rook coming down with wings half-closed, “stooping” like a falcon, 
is certainly a formidable foe, but the feathers on an owl’s back are 
wonderfully thick and soft, and would act as an elastic cushion protecting the 
body.

A small bird which “seems to fly in jumps” has puzzled the same correspondent; 
it is black and white with “a black boomerang band on its white throat” and 
white streaks – outer feathers – on its tail. Undoubtedly our friend the pied 
wagtail; many of these birds are now wintering on our southern shores.
