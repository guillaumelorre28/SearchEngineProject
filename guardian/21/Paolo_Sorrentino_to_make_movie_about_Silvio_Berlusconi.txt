Paolo Sorrentino, who won an Academy Award for The Great Beauty and whose work 
has often focused on the loneliness of ageing playboys with enormous power, is 
to make a film aboutSilvio Berlusconi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi>.

According to Variety 
<http://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/italian-director-paolo-sorrentino-to-make-film-about-silvio-berlusconi-exclusive-1201852332/>
, the director is currently working on a screenplay for Loro, which they 
speculate may shoot as early as summer 2017. Loro translates as “them”, but it 
also sounds in Italian like “l’oro”, which means gold.

The film will be in Italian; Sorrentino’s most recent big screen outing, last 
year’sYouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine>
, was his second in English and, likeThis Must Be the Place 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/05/this-must-be-the-place-review> 
(2011), less well-received than efforts in his native tongue.

Jude Law in The Young Pope: watch the exclusive trailer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/sep/03/jude-law-the-young-pope-extended-trailer-video>
However, The Young Pope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/03/the-young-pope-review-jude-laws-sleek-pontiff-shines-in-sorrentinos-twin-peaks>
, his 10-part series for HBO starring Jude Law as an American pontiff, is also 
in English. The first two episodes of that programme premiered at the Venice 
film festival last week, toan ecstatic reception 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/03/the-young-pope-review-jude-laws-sleek-pontiff-shines-in-sorrentinos-twin-peaks>
.

Sorrentino’s most pointed previous portrayal of a high-ranking politician was 
2008’sIl Divo <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/20/il-divo-film-review>
, whose subject wasGiulio Andreotti 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/06/giulio-andreotti-italian-pm-dies>
, perhaps the most prominent post-war statesman in the country, who served as 
prime minister seven times. That film starredToni Servillo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/29/great-beauty-toni-servillo-sorrentino>
; also the lead in 2004’s The Consequences of Love, 2007’s Gomorrah and of The 
Great Beauty. No casting has yet been announced for Loro, but Servillo would be 
the natural frontrunner.

The Great Beauty: watch the trailer for Paolo Sorrentino’s new film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/may/21/great-beauty-trailer> 
Berlusconi turns 80 next month and is expected to soon retire from the 
political arena after a volatile career. Last month, he announced his intention 
to sell all shares in ACMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, 
the football club he has owned for 30 years. He was the subject of Nanni 
Moretti’s The Caiman (2006), in which a B-movie director makes a satire about 
the leader.

Variety reports that Sorrentino’s “is expected to be a depiction of 
Berlusconi’s world, but not a scathing sterile criticism”.
