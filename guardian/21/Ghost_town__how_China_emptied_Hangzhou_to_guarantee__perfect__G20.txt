The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has wrapped up his country’s first G20 
summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/no-10-theresa-may-rules-out-points-based-immigration-system-for-britain-brexit>
 by urging the thousands of foreign journalists who flocked to east China for 
the event to carve out a special place in their hearts for the host city.

And visiting correspondents are unlikely to forget Hangzhou any time soon.

In recent days, foreign journalists have been astonished and bewildered at how 
China’s authoritarian rulers have managed to transform a usually bustling 
metropolis of 6 million inhabitants into a virtual ghost town to guarantee a 
trouble-free summit.

More than a third of Hangzhou’s population were reportedly “convinced” to 
leave town as part of what Chinese state media calleda massive exodus 
<http://www.china.org.cn/china/2016-08/31/content_39202979.htm> that saw cars 
forced off the roads and a seven-day public holiday declared.

Thousands of residents were ordered to vacate the towering apartment blocks 
that surround the conference centre where world leaders had gathered, to 
prevent an assault from above.

Dissidents were placed under house arrest or forced to leave the city by 
security agents.

And entire neighbourhoods were left deserted after migrant workers were pushed 
out of the city when factories and building sites where they work were ordered 
to shut down in a bid to cut pollution.

Foreign journalists have spent days trudging through Hangzhou’s eerie and 
empty backstreets – anxious Communist party security agents trailing their 
every step – ina luckless quest to find interviewees 
<https://twitter.com/TheJohnSudworth/status/771698365155246080>. 

Wu Yuhua, a 43-year-old DIY store owner, said he had decided to abandon the 
city after his customers, most of whom are migrant workers, stopped coming in 
the days leading up to theG20 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20>. “There’s 
no business,” he complained. “But you still have to pay the rent.”

Li Yindeng, a noodle shop owner, told the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/world/asia/china-g20-summit-hangzhou.html> 
she had been ordered to shut up shop. “They told us, this is a 
once-in-a-lifetime thing, and if anything happens while Obama is here, the 
officials could be sacked, so they said, ‘Please close.’”

Forcing the masses to leave town has not been the only tactic employed to 
ensure that China’s G20 debut, which Beijing sees as a chance to bolster its 
reputation as a great power, went off without a hitch.

A vast security operation has also been rolled out, with armed special forces 
guarding the entrances to the city and Swat teams policing intersections across 
town.

Some 760,000 citizen volunteers – many of them senior citizens in bright red 
armbands – have been deployed to keep tabs on the city.

Even in Beijing, more than (745 miles) 1,200km north of Hangzhou, groups of 
elderly “public security volunteers” can be seen milling around at bus shelters 
or lurking under trees. Since world leaders began assembling inChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> last week, they have spent their days 
gossiping about friends and relatives, while simultaneously keeping an eye out 
for potential terrorists and spies.

On Monday evening, Xi declared his government’s mammoth effort a resounding 
success.

“You have recorded the exciting moments of China’s G20 presidency,” he told 
reporters who had gathered in this strangely empty megacity. “You have conveyed 
to the world the success of the summit … [and] it is your hard work that has 
helped to seal China’s mark on the G20.”

Foreign correspondents left the announcement still trying to make sense of 
what they had seen.
