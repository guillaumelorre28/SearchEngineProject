The Wycombe manager, Gareth Ainsworth, has defended Matt McClure after the 
striker was sent off within 70 seconds of coming on as a substitute in their 2-1
League Two <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> win at 
Tranmere.

The bizarre cameo unfolded when McClure replaced Sam Saunders after 67 
minutes. Moments later he went up for an aerial challenge with Tranmere’s Adam 
Dugdale and was shown an instant red.

Ainsworth told the Bucks Free Press 
<http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/sport/11831153.Wanderers_manager_defends_McClure_after_sending_off/>
: “I think he’s led with his arm but he hasn’t meant to elbow the guy in any 
way. I know Matty McClure very well and he would never try and hurt anyone but, 
if he has caught him in the mouth with his arm, then it’s a red card. It’s 
unfortunate but it happens.”

Wycombe’s Twitter feed, meanwhile, tracked the action live – estimating 
McClure’s night’s work at only five seconds.

McClure’s feat does not earn him a place in the record books, though. The 
record for the fastest red earned by a substitute on the field of play stands 
at zero seconds – shared by Swansea’s Walter Boyd (2000) and Sheffield United’s 
Keith Gillespie (2007), who were both sent off before play had restarted.
Gillespie went for elbowing Stephen Hunt in the face

 Keith Gillespie’s instant red in 2007 
Among football’s other famous red card feats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/07/1> is that of the Cross Farm 
Park Celtic striker Lee Todd, who was sent off only two seconds into a game in 
2000 for foul language. Todd had his back to the referee at the start of the 
Sunday league game against Taunton East Reach Wanderers, and was startled by 
the force with which the whistle was blown for kick-off. He muttered: “Fuck me, 
that was loud,” and was dismissed.

“I wasn’t swearing at the ref or anyone else,” he said afterwards. “Anyone 
else would have done the same – he nearly blew my ear off.”
