The La Liga leaders, Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>, turned up the pressure on 
Barcelona when the in-form Karim Benzema scored twice to lead the club's 5-1 
win against Granada.

The victory extended Madrid's advantage over their rivals to six points ahead 
of Barcelona's Catalan capital derby at Espanyol on Sunday.

Benzema opened the scoring at the Bernabéu in the 19th minute. Granada 
equalised three minutes later, but Madrid went on to dominate, with goals by 
Sergio Ramos, Gonzalo Higuaín, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.

The France striker Benzema, who scored the winner in Madrid's 3-2 victory 
against Málaga in the Copa del Rey this week, has scored 10 league goals this 
season.
