It’s heating up in Cannes, quite literally today, but we’re still avoiding the 
beach and any beach-related sports for stuffy screenings and stilted press 
conferences. Go us!

More stars are arriving, more films are unspooling (including some biggies) 
and more disdainful looks from peeved locals are making us feel awkward. It’s 
interesting how much this small resort town tries to include film in every 
place possible, to appeal to the swarm of movie types. This morning, Catherine 
Shoard found a very dedicated and glitzy shoe shop:

After delving into impressively and inventively odd territory in Dogtooth and 
Alps, there was plenty of excitement over the new film fromYorgos Lanthimos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/11/greek-director-yorgos-lanthimos> 
although, given its starry cast (Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz), some trepidation 
over whether he would soften his sharp claws for the masses. The Lobster, which 
screened this morning, is a dystopian tale of a future where single people must 
find a mate in a creepy hotel within a certain time or face transformation into 
wild animals and, even those who didn’t like it, can hardly call it a bid for 
the mainstream.

It’s a fascinatingly strange and smart film that studies the differences 
between being single and being in a relationship in a warped and often gruesome 
manner.Peter Bradshaw awarded it three stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/the-lobster-review-cannes-film-festival-2015>
, calling it “bizarre and hilarious” but felt it ran out of ideas by the end. 
Others agreed that the ending took the bisque-it while some believed it might 
snatch the Palme Thermid’Or:

THE LOBSTER: Premise and first two thirds are deadpan absurdist excellence, 
then it meanders through a lesser third act. Still pretty swell.

Henry Barnes headed along to the press conference this morning and discovered 
a rather unlikely inspiration for the film. According to Lanthimos, he 
binge-watched Channel 4 reality series The Hotel, which helped inform the 
script. Which came as a surprise to us as we were expectingPhoebe Buffay 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKBovKaCUHQ> to get a name-check. So Henry 
asked, of course, and was met with a sea of blank looks. Sounds pretty 
shellfish not to give Friends some credit, if you ask us...

Road screening. Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage 
It’s one of the few blockbusters being shown during this year’s festival and 
last night’s out of competition screening ofMad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mad-max-fury-road> brought out a parade of 
stars. As well as the cast, including Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy and Nicholas 
Hoult, the red carpet was also graced by Julianne Moore, Jack O’Connell and 
Michelle Rodriguez among others.

The film itself went down a storm. Yesterday’s press screening boasted three 
different sets of rabid applause throughout the film and after a 99% rating on 
Rotten Tomatoes,The Hollywood Reporter is even touting it as a potential Oscar 
contender 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-2015-mad-max-oscar-795696>. Not 
sure if we quite agree just yet, although its a shoo-in for some of the 
technical categories, but it’ll be interesting to see which other films emerge 
from the fest as awards contenders outside of Cannes.Carol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/13/patricia-highsmith-film-adaptation-carol-only-openly-lesbian-novel-cannes-cate-blanchett>
, starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, is looking like a potential Academy 
favourite, at least on paper.

We nipped along to yesterday’s Mad Max press conference and heard star 
Charlize Theron <https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlize-theron> discuss the 
very real edge to the film’s grim view of the future. “It felt very grounded in 
real events,” said Theron. “The idea of globalisation and global warming and 
drought and the value of water, and leadership becoming completely out of 
hand.” The success of the film also led director George Miller to talk about 
sequels and a live action show. Our working title for the sequel is 
2Max2Furious in case anyone’s interested.

Woody Allen has had mixed fortunes on the Croisette in recent years with the 
acclaim for Vicky Cristina Barcelona almost eradicated by the arrival ofTo Rome 
With Love 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/13/to-rome-with-love-review> four 
years later. This year, it looks like Allen will be ending up somewhere between 
the two with the world premiere of Irrational Man. Joaquin Phoenix stars as a 
professor engaging in an affair with student Emma Stone which leads to murky 
and possibly murderous territory. The press screening has just let out and 
reactions are mixed.Peter Bradshaw gave it a mere two stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/irrational-man-review-woody-allen-joaquin-phoenix>
, calling it “amiable but forgettable” and here’s what other critics had to say:

In more important news, Catherine Shoard spent some time with Woody this 
morning and while in the room, she was given the great pleasure of watching him 
order his lunch. He went for “chicken with mustard on any bread” despite her 
recommending fish. He ordered a ginger ale alongside. Not sure yet if she was 
able to watch him eat but awkward video footage will follow, if so.

The early favourite
 Acclaimed German drama Son of Saul. 
Away from the starrier movies on offer, a challenging second world war drama 
has quietly emerged as one of the festival’s biggest breakouts, despite a 
hugely difficult subject matter. Son of Saul focuses on a Jewish prisoner who 
helps carry the bodies from the gas chambers to the pyres to be burned but once 
he finds his young son, he begins a mission to give him a proper burial.Peter 
Bradshaw gave it the full five stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/son-of-saul-review-an-outstanding-excoriating-look-at-evil-in-auchwitz>
, calling it “devastating and terrifying”. It’s playing in competition so we’re 
pegging this one as an early favourite for the big prize.

While we’re still waiting for an invite to a yacht party, we’ve spent the 
first few days cruelly taunted by the impressive array of boats within swimming 
distance of the beach. According toForbes 
<http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimdobson/2015/05/14/the-billionaire-superyacht-showdown-whos-who-at-the-cannes-film-festival/>
, the yachts potentially mooring at the festival include ones owned by 
entertainment industry mogul David Geffen (worth $6.9 billion), Microsoft 
co-founder Paul Allen ($17.5 billion) and Louis Vuitton’s French CEO Bernard 
Arnault ($37 billion). The owner of the flat we’re staying in may well be a 
yacht fan but we’re not sure:

Last night, Catherine and Peter headed along to a presentation from Harvey 
Weinstein on The Weinstein Company’s upcoming slate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/14/harvey-weinstein-ive-been-married-to-quentin-tarantino-for-22-years-the-best-marriage-of-my-life>
. Actors including jury members Jake Gyllenhaal and Sienna Miller as well as Ex 
Machina’s breakout star Alicia Vikander joined him on stage. Here were the 
highlights:

 * Adam Jones - Bradley Cooper plays a chef, his poor American Sniper wife 
Sienna Miller returning to play what appears to be another thankless wife role. 
As Peter says: “Will Harvey get Miller a lead or not?” 
 * Southpaw - Harvey was really pushing this Jake Gyllenhaal boxing drama and 
is confident that he will be getting some Oscar attention next year. He also 
claimed that it was supposed to be in the Cannes official competition but he 
withdrew it as there would be a conflict, given Gyllenhaal’s spot on the jury 
 * Carol - the Cate Blanchett/Rooney Mara romance is one of the buzziest films 
of the festival and a handsome trailer showed off some “meticulous 50s 
locations” 
 * The Hateful Eight - the first real look at Quentin Tarantino’s new western. 
Weinstein is fully behind this one and shared the following hefty statement: 
“I’ve been married to Quentin Tarantino for 22 years: the best marriage of my 
life.”

 Tom Hardy breaking the Cannes law with a fan last night. 
After Salma Hayek bravely broke festival head Thierry Frémaux’s no selfie rule 
at the Tale of Tales press conference,Tom Hardy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hardy> has become the latest star to defy 
the Cannes law. On last night’s Mad Max red carpet, he posed with a fan who may 
or may not be a Frémaux plant. The naming and shaming shall continue.

The “wait, what?” film
 ‘Fire burns ... lava bites’ Photograph: PR 
The B-movies continue to impress at this year’s market with today’s choice 
bringing together two words that really make zero sense next to each other, in 
an attempt to whip up some ironic Sharknado success. The plot of Lavalantula 
follows a washed-up action star who hasn’t yet been cast but we’re guessing a 
washed-up action star will probably take the role.
