The two sides met in the Premier League as recently as 2001, but have both 
fallen into the third tiers amid growing unrest over management of the clubs 
off the field. Charlton were relegated from the Championship last season and 
had won two of their 11 league fixtures before Saturday’s game, which they won 
3-0, while Coventry, who spent a season in exile at Northampton’s Sixfields 
ground in 2013-14, are bottom ofLeague One

against Duchâtelet and Katrien Meire, the club’s chief executive. In March, 
fans staged a mock “funeral” for the club before the win over Middlesbrough, and
threw beach balls on to the pitch
