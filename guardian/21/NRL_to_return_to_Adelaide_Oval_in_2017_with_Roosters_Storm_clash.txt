The date and round of the clash between the Storm and the Roosters will be 
confirmed when the 2017 draw is finalised.

“Adelaide Oval is one of our country’s most iconic grounds and to have the 
opportunity to play at the ground is something we’re all really looking forward 
to,” Roosters coach Trent Robinson said.

The most recent NRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> match for 
premiership points in South Australia was between Canterbury and the Storm in 
2011.

The Roosters will host 10 of their 12 home matches next year at Allianz 
Stadium, with the other two taking place at Central Coast Stadium and Adelaide 
Oval.
