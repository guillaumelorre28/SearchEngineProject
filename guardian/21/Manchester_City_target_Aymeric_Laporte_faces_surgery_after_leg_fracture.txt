The Athletic Bilbao <https://www.theguardian.com/football/athleticbilbao> 
defender Aymeric Laporte, reportedly a summer target of Manchester City, is 
likely to face a long period out after his club confirmed he had sustained a 
broken leg and dislocated ankle.

Laporte, who has been mooted as a long-term replacement for Vincent Kompany

 and is known to havebeen considered by Manchester United

 in the past, was injured playing for France’s Under-21s against Scotland on 
Thursday. He was carried off after his right leg was hurt in a tackle and 
Athletic announced on Friday that the problem is serious.

“After the first scan Aymeric Laporte has been diagnosed with a 
fracture-dislocation of the fibula and right ankle,” a club statement read. “On 
his return to Bilbao he will be subjected to further tests after which the 
extent of his injury and his period of absence will be determined.”

The 21-year-old centre-back who came through Athletic’s youth system, has a 
release clause of €50m in his current contract

 but any continuation of Pep Guardiola’s interest may be contingent on his 
successful recovery from this lay-off. It already looks certain that Laporte 
will miss the rest of a campaign in which Athletic are seventh in La Liga and 
facing a Europa League last-eight tie with Sevilla.
