Jeremy Corbyn has again floated the idea that Labour might support a policy of 
a national maximum earnings cap

.

On the radio this morning Corbyn declined to put a precise figure on the idea, 
but suggested it would be a vital step in tackling inequality in the UK.

“I would like there to be some kind of high earnings cap, quite honestly,” he 
told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I can’t put a figure on it and I don’t 
want to at the moment. The point I’m trying to make is that we have the worst 
levels of income disparity of most of the OECD countries.”

Would you support a maximum earnings figure? Do you think it should be applied 
across the board, or should a cap be set at different levels for different 
occupations? Do you think the figure should be different for the private sector 
and the public sector?

If the policy was implemented, at what level should the cap be set? Please let
