 N - style guide illustrations Photograph: Jakob Hinrichs 
Nabokov, Vladimir
(1899-1977) Russian-born author of Lolita; not Nabakov

nailbomb

naive, naively, naivety
 no accent

Nakba
 the Palestinian “catastrophe”

Naked Rambler
real name Stephen Gough

names
Prominent figures can just be named in stories, with their function at second 
mention: “George Osborne said last night ... “ (first mention); “the chancellor 
added ... “ (subsequent mentions)

Where it is thought necessary to explain who someone is, write “Chris Wilder, 
the Sheffield United manager, said” or “the Sheffield United manager, Chris 
Wilder, said”, etc.

In such cases the commas around the name indicate there is only one person in 
the position, so write “the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said” (only one 
person in the job), but “the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock said” (there 
have been many).

Do not leave out the definite article in such constructions as “style guru 
David Marsh said ... “ It should be “The style guru David Marsh” (if there are 
other style gurus) or “David Marsh, the style guru, ... “ (if you feel only one 
person merits such a description)

Nanjing
not Nanking

Napoleon Bonaparte

narrowboat
the popular type of British canal boat, 7ft wide and up to 70ft long – do not 
call it a barge. A wider version (typically 10-14ft wide) is a broadbeam 
narrowboat

Nasa
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, but no need to spell out

nation
should not be used to mean country or state, but reserved to describe people 
united by language, culture and history so as to form a distinct group within a 
larger territory.

Beware of attributing the actions of a government or a military force to a 
national population (“the Israelis have killed 400 children during the 
intifada”). Official actions always have opponents within a population; if we 
don’t acknowledge this, we oversimplify the situation and shortchange the 
opponents

national anthem

National Archives
the former Public Record Office, now merged with the Historical Manuscripts 
Commission

National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers
(NASUWT) call it “the union” after first mention if you want to avoid using 
these unlovely initials; note that an “and” seems to have gone missing somewhere

National Audit Office
NAO or audit office after first mention

national curriculum

National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts
Nesta after first mention

National Grid
transmits gas as well as electricity

National Health Service

national insurance
lc; abbreviate national insurance contributions to NICs after first mention

(Northern Ireland)

for workers over 24. In quotes at first mention to avoid confusion with the 
living wage, as advocated by the Living Wage Foundation

national lottery

National Offender Management Service
formed in 2004 from a merger between the prison and probation services, it

system)

may be abbreviated to NS&I

national service
peacetime conscription in the UK lasted from 1949 until 1960

Naypyidaw

Nazi, neo-Nazi
but lowercase for nazism and in such phrases as grammar nazi (which should be 
used very sparingly)

‘Ndrangheta
Calabrian version of the mafia

Neanderthal man
scientific name and style is Homo neanderthalensis. While it may be tempting 
to describe certain attitudes or, say, politicians as neanderthal, we should 
bear in mind that archaeologists have known for many years that Neanderthal man 
was not stupid. British Archaeology magazine has complained about the media’s 
use of neanderthal as a term of abuse

nearby
one word, whether adjective or adverb: the nearby pub; the pub nearby

nearsighted

negligent
careless; negligible slight


nemesis
an agent of retribution and vengeance, not a synonym for enemy

neocon, neoconservative, neoliberal

snooker”, “Barnsley is the new Tuscany”, etc

Nepalese
for the people and their language, not Nepali

nerve-racking

Nestlé

Netanyahu, Benjamin


Netherlands, the
not Holland, which is only part of the country; use Dutch as the adjective. 
Exception: the Dutch football team is generally known as Holland

Never Never Land
or simply Neverland (JM Barrie used both in his Peter Pan works)

nevertheless

new
often redundant, as in “a new report said yesterday”

new age travellers

newbie

Newcastle-under-Lyme
hyphens

Newcastle upon Tyne
no hyphens

New Deal
capped up, whether you are talking about Franklin D Roosevelt’s job creation

newfound

New Labour

news agency

newsagent, newsprint, newsreel

Nigerian names

Nissan
cars; Nissen hut

nitric, nitrogen or nitrous?
nitric oxide (chemical name NO) and nitrogen dioxide (chemical name NO2) are 
both found in diesel fumes and are collectively referred to as nitrogen oxides, 
or NOx. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide cause inflammation of the 
airways and can also react to form other secondary pollutants, such as ozone, 
which create their own health problems.

nitrous oxide (N2O), laughing gas, is not found in diesel fumes

No 1
in the charts, the world tennis No 1, etc

No 10
Downing Street

no
the plural is noes

Nobel prize
a Nobel prize winner, a Nobel prize-winning author, etc

Nobel peace prize, Nobel prize for literature, etc

no-brainer
means something along the lines of “this is so obvious, you don’t need a brain 
to know it”, not “only someone with no brain would think this”

no campaign, yes campaign
not No campaign, “no” campaign or any other variant

no doubt that, no question that
are opposites: “There was no doubt that he was lying” means he was lying; 
“There was no question that he was lying” means he wasn’t; the two are 
routinely confused

Noel
no accent on Noel as in Christmas (The First Noel, not Nowell); use an accent 
if that’s how the person spells his or her name: Noël Coward had one, Noel 
Edmonds doesn’t

no-fly zone

noisome
Nothing to do with noise, it means offensive or evil-smelling. Looking at what 
has happened to fulsome, it seems likely that lazy people will start using 
noisome as a fancy way to mean noisy, which would be a shame

no man’s land
no hyphens

noncommissioned officer

nonconformist

none
It is a (very persistent) myth that “none” has to take a singular verb: plural 
is acceptable and often sounds more natural, eg “none of the current squad are 
good enough to play in the Premier League”, “none of the issues have been 
resolved”

nonetheless

noon
not 12 noon, 12am or 12pm

no one
not no-one

Nordic countries
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland

normal
normalcy was popularised in the US by Warren G Harding’s “return to normalcy” 
1920 campaign slogan; normality is the British English version. But “back to 
normal” is preferable to either


north
north London, north Wales, north-west England, the north-west, etc

North America

north-east England
Tyneside (Newcastle), Wearside (Sunderland), Teesside (Middlesbrough); we 
often confuse these or get them wrong in some way that makes it look as if the 
farthest north-east Guardian journalists have ventured is Stoke Newington

northern hemisphere

northern lights
also known as aurora borealis; the southern hemisphere counterpart is aurora 
australis

north of the border
avoid this expression: we work on national newspapers

north pole

Northumbria
an ancient Anglo-Saxon kingdom, a university and a police authority; the 
county, however, is Northumberland

North-West Frontier province
one of the four provinces of Pakistan, now known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

between Pickering and Grosmont

nosy
not nosey

notebook, notepaper

not-for-profit
as an adjective, as in “not-for-profit organisation”

noticeboard


Nottingham Forest, Notts County
the former should never be abbreviated to “Notts Forest”

Notting Hill carnival

nous
common sense

Nouse
York University student newspaper

novel psychoactive substances (NPSs)
formerly known as legal highs, but now illegal


now
occasionally useful for emphasis, but is now used far too often

npower
retail arm of RWE npower; nothing to do with nuclear power

‘NSync
not *NSync or *NSYNC or *N Sync or ’N Sync

numbers
Spell out from one to nine; numerals from 10 to 999,999; thereafter use m, bn 
or tn for sums of money, quantities or inanimate objects in copy, eg 5m tonnes 
of coal, 30bn doses of vaccine, £50tn; but million or billion for people or 
animals, eg 1 million people, 25 million rabbits, the world population is 7 
billion, etc; in headlines always use m, bn or tn

numbskull

numeracy
Numbers have always contained power, and many a journalist will tremble at the 
very sight of them. But most often the only maths we need to make sense of them 
is simple arithmetic. Far more important are our critical faculties, all too 
often switched off at the first sniff of a figure.

It’s easy to be hoodwinked by big numbers in particular. But are they really 
so big? Compared with what? And what is being assumed? A government 
announcement of an extra £Xm a year will look far less impressive if divided by 
60 million (the British population) and/or 52 (weeks in the year). That’s quite 
apart from the fact that it was probably trumpeted last week already, as part 
of another, bigger number.

Never invent a big figure when a small one will do. Totting jail sentences 
together (“the six men were jailed for a total of 87 years”) is meaningless as 
well as irritating. Similarly, saying that something has an area the size of 
150 football pitches, or is “eight times the size of Wales”, is cliched and may 
not be helpful.

Here is an easy three-point guide to sidestepping common “mythematics” traps:

1 Be careful in conversions, don’t muddle metric and imperial, or linear, 
square and cubic measures. Square miles and miles square are constantly 
confused: an area 10 miles square is 10 miles by 10 miles, which equals 100 
square miles.

2 Be extremely wary of (or don’t bother) converting changes in temperature; 
you run the risk of confusing absolute and relative temperatures, eg while a 
temperature of 2C is about the same as 36F, a temperature change of 2C 
corresponds to a change of about 4F.

3 When calculating percentages, beware the “rose by/fell by X%” construction: 
an increase from 3% to 5% is a 2 percentage point increase or a 2-point 
increase, not a 2% increase

Nuremberg

N-word
to be spelt out only if essential to a story (for example, when quoting 
someone accused of using it)
