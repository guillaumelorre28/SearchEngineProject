The lifesaving charity the RNLI  
<https://rnli.org/support-us/give-money/donate?&gclid=CKPf5LSkvNECFQs4GwodMloH7w>
has been criticised after the cost of a new base soared to double the original 
estimate even as a much-loved all-weather lifeboat covering the same stretch of 
coast was being withdrawn from duty.

As the finishing touches are put to a lifeboat station at Swanage  
<http://swanagelifeboat.org.uk/>on Dorset’s Jurassic coast, the RNLI has 
confirmed to the Guardian that the total bill will be £8.1m. It had initially 
said it needed to raise £3.5m for the station.

Meanwhile many people a few miles along the coast in Poole are mourning the 
loss of the town’s all-weather lifeboat, City of Sheffield, 
<https://rnli.org/news-and-media/2016/november/02/new-era-for-poole-rnli-as-volunteers-say-farewell-to-their-all-weather-lifeboat>
which was taken out of service at the end of last year after a distinguished 
career in which it had helped save hundreds of lives.

City of Sheffield is currently high and dry at the RNLI’s headquarters waiting 
to be sold off and two much smaller boats with more limited ranges are now 
stationed atPoole <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/poole>.

The RNLI argues the new boathouse at Swanage, where one of the new generation 
of all-weather boats, the Shannon class, will be stationed, plus the new lineup 
of vessels at Poole will make the coastline safer. It says that the problems 
which have led to the overspend, including a large borehole on the construction 
site, could not be foreseen. And it insists the cost of the station and the 
removal of the lifeboat are not linked. Still, many people, including some RNLI 
volunteers, are seething.

Carol Evans, a former Poole mayor and ex-member of the Royal Navy, described 
the spending at Swanage as “scandalous”. She said: “The RNLI volunteers and 
crews do brilliant work – nobody doubts that – but you do wonder about the 
bosses. They sit in their ivory towers and seem to make decisions that really 
do not make sense. It’s shocking that the Swanage lifeboat station is costing 
so much more than was planned.”

Evans said she was deeply upset at the loss of City of Sheffield. “Poole is 
busy with commercial and leisure vessels. I do worry that there is no 
all-weather lifeboat stationed here.” City of Sheffield was more than a boat, 
Evans said – it was a valued member of the community. “Generations of families 
have been involved in the Poole lifeboat. There is a lot of upset here.”

John Buckby, a former Poole lifeboatman, expressed concern at the retirement 
of the all-weather lifeboat, pointing out that vessels as large as 
cross-channel ferries used the harbour. “They say Swanage will be able to cover 
but if something major happens in Poole harbour it is obviously going to take 
them longer to get here.”

Several volunteers directly involved with Poole lifeboat station said they 
were angry and worried, although they asked to remain anonymous. One said: 
“Losing the big boat feels like a bereavement. It is a bitter pill to swallow. 
The bosses looked at their charts and their stats and decided the best value 
for money was for her to go.” The volunteer pointed out that the cost of the 
overspend at Swanage could have paid for two brand new Shannon-class boats, 
which cost £2.2m each.

Another factor that worries some is the loss of the coastguard helicopter from 
Portland in Dorset, which goes this year as part of the government’s 
reorganisation of search and rescue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/31/search-rescue-helicopters-privatisation-fears>
.

“There is concern about the loss of that helicopter as well as of the boat,” 
said a second volunteer. “It feels like lots of changes take place. We’ll see 
how it plays out but there is concern. Time will tell whether these are good 
decisions or not.”

Over at RNLI headquarters, which are coincidentally in Poole, Glen Mallen, the 
lifesaving manager responsible for the south-east, a patch that begins in 
Swanage and ends in Essex, said he understood the sadness in Poole.

“It’s a very emotional thing to lose a boat,” said Mallen, who spent nine 
years as a volunteer on the Poole lifeboat. “There is an adjustment to be made 
but Poole still has two fully operational lifeboats.”

Two much smaller boats are now tied up at Poole lifeboat station instead of 
the 14-metre Tyne class Sheffield, which had a range of 240 nautical miles. 
Mallen said the boats, the B class Atlantic 85 RIB (rigid inflatable) and the D 
class inflatable, were both well-suited to the shallow water of Poole harbour.

He said the deeper water of Poole bay would now be covered by the new Shannon 
<https://rnli.org/what-we-do/lifeboats-and-stations/our-lifeboat-fleet/shannon-class-lifeboat>
 from Swanage, which is faster than the Tynes and – propelled by water jets 
rather than propellers – more manoeuvrable, along with boats stationed at 
Mudeford near Christchurch and Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight.

George Rawlinson, the RNLI’s operations director was to be found not in an 
ivory tower but out on a new Shannon class boat that is undergoing testing 
before being sent to Llandudno in north Wales. He said the changes had been 
made following a coast review process.

Rawlinson explained that one of the factors that had led to the changes were 
what was going on in Poole harbour and out in the bay. He said more people were 
using the water for leisure compared with 20 years ago and there were fewer 
commercial fishermen. This meant that more rescues were taking place in the 
harbour and closer to the coast rather than way out to sea. Having an 
all-weather boat which can operate 100 miles off the coast was deemed 
unnecessary.

He said the entrance to Poole harbour was five miles from the Swanage slipway 
– 12 minutes for the Shannon class. “We aim to reach at least 90% of all 
casualties within 10 nautical miles of the coast, within 30 minutes of a 
lifeboat launch in any weather,” he said. “To achieve that we have to make 
objective choices.”

 RNLI accepts the overspend at Swanage is unfortunate but pointed out that 
this was the first slipway it has built for a Shannon class vessel and was 
hampered by problems including a deep borehole that it had not been aware of 
until construction began. It also said the new slipway would be in place for 
the next century.

Visitors to Poole quay seemed forgiving.

“I’m a lifelong supporter,” said Jan Davies as she pushed some coins through 
the letterbox of the lifeboat museum. “It is a shame about Swanage and I’ll 
miss the sight of the big lifeboat here. It was so comforting. But everyone 
gets some things wrong but I’ve got faith that most of the time the RNLI does 
get it right.”

said the D class boat at Poole was a rigid inflatable. This has been corrected.
