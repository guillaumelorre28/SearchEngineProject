 The video is arranged to mirror the painting Sleep, by realist artist Vincent 
Desiderio.Warning: this video contains depictions of nudity. 
Donald Trump lies naked with Taylor Swift 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift>, Kim Kardashian, Bill Cosby 
and Kanye West in a grainy video released with West’s new single, Famous, in a 
line-up of wax models the rapper says is “a comment on fame”.

West released the video on Friday night in conjunction with a party in Los 
Angeles and an interview inVanity Fair 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/06/kanye-famous-video-interview>. In 
the video, the models lie as if sleeping amid crumpled white sheets on an 
enormous bed, as a camera pans slowly over their faces and bodies, pausing over 
each famous figure and parts of their anatomy.

George W Bush appears near Trump, then fashion editor Anna Wintour, followed 
by Rihanna and Chris Brown, Swift, West and Kardashian. Then the camera shows 
Ray J, Amber Rose,Caitlyn Jenner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/caitlyn-jenner> and Bill Cosby.

The composition is arranged to mirror the painting Sleep, by realist artist 
Vincent Desiderio. The video was filmed over three months with collaborators, 
according to the magazine.

Nearly all the figures in the video have some kind of history with West. He 
married Kardashian and Jenner is a former in-law. He dated Amber Rose, and 
Kardashian featured in a sex tape with Ray J. West has collaborated with 
Rihanna, who dated Brown, whopleaded guilty to assaulting her 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/23/chris-brown-pleads-guilty>. 

West and Swift have an on-off feud of dubious authenticity dating back to 
2009, when Weststormed an awards ceremony stage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/12/kanye-west-claims-taylor-swift-came-up-with-famous-diss-lyric>
 during Swift’s acceptance speech. (In the song, West sings: “I made that bitch 
famous.”)

In the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, West said: “George Bush doesn’t care 
about black people.” The former president laterdescribed it as the worst moment 
of his eight years

The rapper told Vanity Fair: “Maybe in some alternative universe me and George 
Bush <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-bush> could have been friends. 
I could have been his OJ Simpson black friend on the golf course.”

Trump has praised 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-kanye-west-loves-trump-n421182>
 West, who he said “loves Trump 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-kanye-west-loves-trump-n421182>
”. Westjoked <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9x92nwGf_M> at an awards 
ceremony last year that he may run for president in 2020.

In the magazine interview, West said the video was not meant to show support 
or opposition to any of the people depicted.

“It’s a comment on fame,” he said.

In April, Wintour described West’s fashion as “migrant chic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/15/anna-wintour-under-fire-for-migrant-chic-comments>
”. The same month, Westtweeted 
<https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/697199554807099394?lang=en> “BILL COSBY 
INNOCENT !!!!!!!!!!” after court proceedings began against the comedian, who is
charged with drugging and sexually assaulting a woman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/bill-cosby-trial-sexual-assault-charges-pennsylvania-temple>
.

West has claimed 
<https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/709409643387297792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw> 
his tweets are a form of performance art.
