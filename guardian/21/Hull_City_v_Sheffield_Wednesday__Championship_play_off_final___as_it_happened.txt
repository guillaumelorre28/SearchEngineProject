Full-time: HULL CITY ARE BACK IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE!

For the third time in the last eight years Hull have been promoted to the 
top-flight! They thoroughly deserved it here: they were the more accomplished 
team in an admittedly scruffy match that Diamé embellished with a sweet winning 
goal. Hats of to Hull. Guardiola, Mourinho, Klopp, Wenger, Pochettino, Koeman, 
Conte: Steve Bruce is coming for you all!

90+4 min: Dawson hurls himself in front of a half-volley by Joao. It bashes 
against the defender’s arm but there’s no way the ref can award a penalty for 
that as there was no way the defender could have got out of the way.

90+1 min: Wednesday go Route 1 at last, ballooning a long diagonal bal towards 
Nuhiu. The striker challenges for it with Jakupovic, who, for once, decides to 
catch rather than punch. And then just to sicken Wednesday fans even further, 
he holds his head as if seriously hurt by Nuhiu’s honest jump, and the ref, as 
always, buys it and awards a freekick.

86 min: Often when teams deploy a giant targetman, they begin banging the ball 
at him with lazy predictability. Wednesday have done the opposite so far, 
practically ignoring Nuhiu entirely since his introduction.

84 min: Lee slips a nice pass through to Forestieri, who had invited the pass 
with a clever run into the let-hand side of the box. Forestieri swipes the ball 
back across the face of goal, but Hull clear.

83 min: Here comes one of those counter-attacks Wednesday must fear. Diamé 
strides forward from midfield before playing a simple ball through to 
Hernandez, who takes a needless touch and the swings his foot at the ball with 
undue nonchalance, wafting it six yards wide of the target.

78 min: Yet another wasteful pass by Wednesday when in a promising position. 
This time Hooper was the culprit but they’ve all been guilty at some point in 
this game. And they may be punished again here as Hull roll forward anew. 
Huddlestone clips a dinky pass over to Odubajo, who lets fly from 16 yards. 
Into the sidnetting.

attacking. That gives Wednesday a colossal target up front, off whom Forestieri

73 min: That goal was completely at odds with nearly everything that had 
preceded it in a scruffy game. Wednesday are now going to summon something 
similar if they are to get back into this, while remaining vigilant against 
Hull counters. Steve Bruce’s side have one foot back in the Premier League...

GOAL! Hull 1-0 Wednesday (Diamé 72)

That’s a heck of a way to beat Westwood! Hull won a breaking ball after a punt 
from the back and they fed Diamé, who shuffled to make room for a shot and then 
curled an exquisite effort beyond the keeper from 23 yards!

sent on to do. But Wednesday’s attack peters out because of yet more slovenly 
passing.

64 min: Odubajo has been Hull’s main source of danger in the second half, 
regularly charging down the right. He embarks on another run now, making it all 
the way into the box before Pudil steals the ball with a well-timed sliding 
tackle.

61 min: Corner to Wednesday as Forestieri’s shot is deflected wide. He would 
have been been better advised to pass to Hooper, who was providing an overlap. 
The corner sails across to the far post, from where Pudil sends a looping 
header towards goal. Again Jakupovic makes a needless hullabaloo of it, 
punching imprecisely rather than simply catching the ball.

58 min: Bannan goes walkabouts and leaves Odubajo in acres of space to gallop 
down the right. The full-back presents an impeccable low cross to Robertson, 
who had sprinted all the way up from the other full-back slot to find himself 
in front of goal with a wonderful chance to give his team the lead. That’s meat 
and drink to a striker, but not to Robertson, alas, as he makes a dog’s dinner 
of it. He shanks the ball high and wide.
 Andrew Robertson wildly misses the best chance of the game so far.

56 min: Wednesday take charge again - this has been an almost total reversal 
of the first half so far, even though Hull have had the best chance of this 
period too. But Wednesday’s final pass remains faulty, which is why they still 
have’t really troubled Jakupovic.

53 min: Hull emerge from the box that Wednesday had forced them into in the 
early part of the second half. Snodgrass wins a corner. Much scruffiness ensues 
but eventually the ball finds its way over to Dawson, in an alarming amount of 
space just beyond the far post, some eight yards out. Westwood again reacts 
sharply, dashing off his line to smother another shot.

50 min: Bannan wriggles his way into space mid-way inside the Hull half, then 
slips the ball into Wallace, who miscontrols. That’s been one of the major 
themes of this match: sloppiness right at the moment when precision could lead 
to a real chance.

46 min: No substitutions by either side. This game is going to be settled by 
the keepers, isn’t it? And that’s ominous for Hull ...

Half-time: Hull 0-0 Wednesday

It’s mostly been tight but Westwood has had to make a couple of decent saves 
to keep out Hull, who enjoyed the majority of possession. Carvalhal will be 
pleased to have made it to the break on level terms but must know he’ll have to 
find a way of getting Bannan, in particular, more involved if Wednesday are to 
reverse the flow of play in the second period. Otherwise they’ll have to rely 
on sporadic counter-attack and more fine goalkeeping.

45 min: There’ll be just one more minute. Carvalhal looks nervous at the 
prospect. But he relaxes when he sees Robertson goofily concede a corner. It’s 
delivered to the back post, where Loovens heads it towards goal from six yards 
but not with enough power to worry Jaukpovic.

44 min: A freekick and some relief for Wednesday. Wallace tries to curl it 
into the Hull box from the right. Loovens and Lees both try to get on the end 
of it but it’s fractionally too high.

41 min: Wednesday look like they just want to get back into the dressing room 
at level pegging. But Hull are determined to make this pressure pay. Elmohamady 
plays a delightful ball through to Odubajo, who made an enterprising run up the 
right - but the full-back’s first touch is gauche, allowing Westwood to smother 
his eventual shot.

38 min: Bannan gets on the ball deep in his own half - but Hull quickly 
converge on him and relieve him of it. Then they work it out Diamé, who sells a 
couple of lollipops to befuddled defenders at the edge of the area and then 
bounds into the box. Westwood starts to run out to him but Diamé goes for an 
early left-footed shot - and crashes out off the post!

35 min: Hull are enjoying a spell of dominance. They’re grinding their way 
forward and now spending most of the time probing just outside Wednesday’s box. 
Carvalhal’s side are holding firm for now but their breaks are becoming rarer 
and they haven’t been able to get Bannan on the ball at all so far.

32 min: What a save! Elmohamady won possession in midfield and fed Diamé, who 
pinged it 20 yards forward towards Hernandez. Pudil tries to cut it out but 
only slows it down. That momentary delay allowed Westwood to surge off his line 
and he makes a terrific block from Hernandez’s 16-yard shot. And that’s why 
he’ll likely go to the Euros with Ireland (though not as no1).

26 min: How costly will that mistake from Westwood be? He carried the ball 
over his own byline under token pressure from Snodgrass, giving away a corner. 
Wednesday’s defending from the corner is equally sloppy, as Davies is allowed 
to meet it with a free header near the penalty spot. It’s a powerful downward 
effort ... but Lee is well positioned on the line and blocks it before Hooper 
completes the clearance as Dawson tried to bundle the ball into the net.

20 min: Robertson raids forward for the first time, cutting in from the left 
and trying to hook up with Hernandez in the middle. But Loovens steps out to 
intercept his pass. Suddenly Hooper is charging into the Wednesday half with 
menace again. The move founders when his pass to Wallace goes awry, but the 
pattern of play is clear and it’s pleasing the Wednesday fans, who are far 
noisier and more numerous than Hull’s.

fairly gripping game, though not exactly an action-packed one.

14 min: Wallace sends a curling shot at goal from a 25-yard freekick. It’s not 
travelling fast and should be caught easily but Jakupovic, but instead the 
keeper decides to punch it away. He could be made to pay for that, as Wallace 
regains possession and chips a cross towards the back post. But Hull’s 
defenders do what the keeper should have done and clear the danger decisively.

11 min: Foresteiri tries to score direct from the freekick despite the acute 
angle. They’ve evidently been told to test this keeper early doors, but 
Jakupovic deals with this effort as he should, punching it away without trouble.

10 min: Dawson makes the clearest case you’ll ever see for a yellow card, 
chopping down Foresteiri as the striker hurtled away from him down the left. 
The ref duly books the defender, who trots back into the middle to await the 
delivery of a freekick from a threatening position.

8 min: Livermore tries to make a burst from central midfield but is foiled. 
Then Huddlestone tries to do the same, but he too is denied, as Huthcinson 
wraps as leg around him and nicks the ball away. It’s keenly contested in 
midfield, almost bogged down.

6 min: Dawson pings a superb diagonal ball from deep to Snodgrass on the left. 
The Scot takes it in his stride and then cracks a low cross into the danger 
zone - but there was no team-mate there, Hernanadez having hung deep at the 
edge of the area. Wednesday clear.

4 min: Huddlestone makes a perfect connection with a shot from 20 yards, 
tonking ful-force at goal. It was straight at Westwood but the keeper had to

3 min: After a low-key couple of minutes, Wednesday decide it’s time to start 
posing a threat. Wallace receives the ball midway inside the Hull half and 
takes the opportunity to test Jakupovic - but his shot is charged down by a 
defender so we’ll have to wait a while longer to see what sort of form the 
keeper’s in.

1 min: It’s on! Hull spent the first minute giving each other some settling 
touches, and Wednesday are happy to let them so long as they don’t try to enter 
the Wednesday half.

Formalities completed, all that remains is for fans to jubilate before 
kickoff. They’re signing, whooping and chucking balloons and other inflatables 
about: it’s all going to end in tears for one set of fans so they might as well 
enjoy it now.

Here come the teams, both clad in their traditional garb – minus any headwear, 
alas, but otherwise this description from a match report in 1876 is close 
enough to Wednesday’s current get-up: “blue striped jerseys and smuggler’s 
caps, looking all the world like Dutch sailors.”

Carvalhal is speaking to Sky Sports. Unfortunately it’s not a full-body shot 
so we can’t see what he’s wearing on his lower limbs, which is a pity because 
Ian Holloway, a-punditing like only he can, has said “his short trousers are 
amazing, I don’t know how he gets away with it”. Carvalhal is not asked about 
that, only about the football, and he says: “We feel absolutely confident. WE 
have grown up like a team, from 19th position to the playoffs. We beat 
Brighton, who came third and had 15 points more than us, with our style and our 
football. We are underdogs but that doesn’t mean we don’t have ambitions to 
win. Our players know exactly what to do.”

He also suggests that he selected Sam Hutchinson to give the team extra muscle 
in midfield.

The man team news for Hull, then, is that Allen McGregor is still out with 
back knack so Eldin Jakupovic will continue in goal. The Swiss will be in for a 
busy afternoon if Wednesday play with the attacking brio they’ve honed under 
Carvalhal this season, helped in part by several canny signings, including 
Bannan, Wallace and Forestieri. Given the herocis of the last of that trio, we 
should pay tribute to the first foreigner to sign for Wednesday. Ante Mirocevic 
wasn’t exactly a success at Hillsborough but he paved the way for everyone from 
Di Canio to Forestieri. And he did score this, too.

Preamble:

Hello and welcome to the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> playoff final, a whole 
other kind of Moneyball: today’s winners will gain between £170m and £200m from 
promotion to the Premier League while the losers will get a pat on the head, a 
deep pain in their gut and an invitation to begin preparing for another 46 (or 
49)-match campaign in the second tier. Those are some high stakes.


But forget about the money and think of the glory: that’s what we’re really 
interested in here. One of these clubs will rejoin the elite next season after 
waits of varying length and hardship. Hull, having been a lower-league side for 
over a century, have been yo-yoing between the top-flight and their more usual 
station since 2009 and have a strong yearning to establish themselves properly 
in the Premier League: a good chunk of the team that Steve Bruce will send out 
today have spent most of their careers in the top division and will feel that’s 
where they belong, especially as they finished two places and nine points ahead 
of today’s opponents in the regular season, even if both games between Hull and 
Wednesday teams ended in draws.


Ah, Wednesday. They used to be somebody, you know. Four times champions of 
England, three times FA Cup winners and one-time raisers of the League Cup. But 
they dropped out of the Premier League in 2000 and straight into a kinghell 
mess made by assorted suits of dubious intellect or intent. But now, as the 
Wednesday fans sing, the club in on the way back. They were (a) rescued by 
Milan Mandaric and then (b) sold to a Thai mogul and have now (c) made great 
strides under a manager from whom few people were expecting anything good: that 
sequence of events ring any bells? Dilly ding, dilly dong? Are Wednesday in the 
process of doing a Leicester? Will Carlos Carvalhal end today being almost as 
feted as Claudio Ranieri? Or will jovial Steve Bruce have the last laugh?


The answer to that will depend on many things. Will the Hull that turns up be 
the one that battered Derby County 3-0 in the semi-final first leg or the one 
that nearly threw that lead away in the second-leg after being afflicted by a 
bad dose of the yips? Carvalhal has shown himself to be a canny and bold 
tactician this season and is capable of doing what Alex Neil’s Norwich did to 
Middlesbrough in last year’s final, taking them by surprise to land decisive 
early blows, probably through the deadly Fernando Forestieri (who is also apt 
to fall rather cheaply, according to Robet Snodgrass, who has advised today’s 
ref to keep a close eye on the striker - as should Hull’s defenders). There’ll 
be twists and turns in this for sure, and possibly also triple pikes and 
somersaults, if Snodgrass is right. Stay tuned!

For the third time in the last eight years Hull have been promoted to the 
top-flight! They thoroughly deserved it here: they were the more accomplished 
team in an admittedly scruffy match that Diamé embellished with a sweet winning 
goal. Hats of to Hull. Guardiola, Mourinho, Klopp, Wenger, Pochettino, Koeman, 
Conte: Steve Bruce is coming for you all!

90+4 min: Dawson hurls himself in front of a half-volley by Joao. It bashes 
against the defender’s arm but there’s no way the ref can award a penalty for 
that as there was no way the defender could have got out of the way.
 
90+1 min: Wednesday go Route 1 at last, ballooning a long diagonal bal towards 
Nuhiu. The striker challenges for it with Jakupovic, who, for once, decides to 
catch rather than punch. And then just to sicken Wednesday fans even further, 
he holds his head as if seriously hurt by Nuhiu’s honest jump, and the ref, as 
always, buys it and awards a freekick.

90 min: Wednesday have four minutes in which to do something that they haven’t 
even come close to doing in the previous 90 ...
 
Hull’s last substitution: Maguire on for Diamé, who gets rapturous 
congratulations from the Hull fans, who are hugely outnumbered by Wednesdayites 
but look set to be signing for much longer tonight.
 
Wednesday’s last substitution: Joao on for Pudil. With yet another striker on 
the pitch, will Wednesday get the equaliser they crave? Will they even get a 
shot on target?
 
86 min: Often when teams deploy a giant targetman, they begin banging the ball 
at him with lazy predictability. Wednesday have done the opposite so far, 
practically ignoring Nuhiu entirely since his introduction.
 
Hull substitution: Meyler on for Hernandez. 
 
84 min: Lee slips a nice pass through to Forestieri, who had invited the pass 
with a clever run into the let-hand side of the box. Forestieri swipes the ball 
back across the face of goal, but Hull clear.
 
83 min: Here comes one of those counter-attacks Wednesday must fear. Diamé 
strides forward from midfield before playing a simple ball through to 
Hernandez, who takes a needless touch and the swings his foot at the ball with 
undue nonchalance, wafting it six yards wide of the target.

82 min: Hull substitution: Clucas on for Snodgrass, who makes no attempt to 
pretend he isn’t disgusted at the decision.
 
81 min: It’s just not happening for Wednesday. But it wasn’t really happening 
for Hull either until Diamé stepped up and produced the game’s one real moment 
of class.
 
78 min: Yet another wasteful pass by Wednesday when in a promising position. 
This time Hooper was the culprit but they’ve all been guilty at some point in 
this game. And they may be punished again here as Hull roll forward anew. 
Huddlestone clips a dinky pass over to Odubajo, who lets fly from 16 yards. 
Into the sidnetting.
 
Wednesday substitution: Nuhio on for Hutchinson as Wednesday go more 
attacking. That gives Wednesday a colossal target up front, off whom Forestieri 
and Hooper may feed.
 
73 min: That goal was completely at odds with nearly everything that had 
preceded it in a scruffy game. Wednesday are now going to summon something 
similar if they are to get back into this, while remaining vigilant against 
Hull counters. Steve Bruce’s side have one foot back in the Premier League...
 
That’s a heck of a way to beat Westwood! Hull won a breaking ball after a punt 
from the back and they fed Diamé, who shuffled to make room for a shot and then 
curled an exquisite effort beyond the keeper from 23 yards!

69 min: Helan gets Odubajo going backwards, which is presumably what he was 
sent on to do. But Wednesday’s attack peters out because of yet more slovenly 
passing.
 
66 min: The game enters another sloppy phase. 
 
64 min: Odubajo has been Hull’s main source of danger in the second half, 
regularly charging down the right. He embarks on another run now, making it all 
the way into the box before Pudil steals the ball with a well-timed sliding 
tackle.
 
Wednesday substitution: Helan on for Wallace. The Frenchman’s speed could make 
a difference here.
 
61 min: Corner to Wednesday as Forestieri’s shot is deflected wide. He would 
have been been better advised to pass to Hooper, who was providing an overlap. 
The corner sails across to the far post, from where Pudil sends a looping 
header towards goal. Again Jakupovic makes a needless hullabaloo of it, 
punching imprecisely rather than simply catching the ball.
 
58 min: Bannan goes walkabouts and leaves Odubajo in acres of space to gallop 
down the right. The full-back presents an impeccable low cross to Robertson, 
who had sprinted all the way up from the other full-back slot to find himself 
in front of goal with a wonderful chance to give his team the lead. That’s meat 
and drink to a striker, but not to Robertson, alas, as he makes a dog’s dinner 
of it. He shanks the ball high and wide.
 Andrew Robertson wildly misses the best chance of the game so far.

56 min: Wednesday take charge again - this has been an almost total reversal 
of the first half so far, even though Hull have had the best chance of this 
period too. But Wednesday’s final pass remains faulty, which is why they still 
have’t really troubled Jakupovic.
 
53 min: Hull emerge from the box that Wednesday had forced them into in the 
early part of the second half. Snodgrass wins a corner. Much scruffiness ensues 
but eventually the ball finds its way over to Dawson, in an alarming amount of 
space just beyond the far post, some eight yards out. Westwood again reacts 
sharply, dashing off his line to smother another shot.
 
52 min: Splendid tackle by Davies to prevent Forestieri from getting off a 
shot after a long ball was allowed to run through to him!

Hewitt/Getty Images  
50 min: Bannan wriggles his way into space mid-way inside the Hull half, then 
slips the ball into Wallace, who miscontrols. That’s been one of the major 
themes of this match: sloppiness right at the moment when precision could lead 
to a real chance.
 
48 min: Wednesday have started the half on the front foot, spending the 
opening two minutes deep in opposition territory. Without hinting at creating a 
chance.
 
46 min: No substitutions by either side. This game is going to be settled by 
the keepers, isn’t it? And that’s ominous for Hull ...
 
It’s mostly been tight but Westwood has had to make a couple of decent saves 
to keep out Hull, who enjoyed the majority of possession. Carvalhal will be 
pleased to have made it to the break on level terms but must know he’ll have to 
find a way of getting Bannan, in particular, more involved if Wednesday are to 
reverse the flow of play in the second period. Otherwise they’ll have to rely 
on sporadic counter-attack and more fine goalkeeping.
 
45 min: There’ll be just one more minute. Carvalhal looks nervous at the 
prospect. But he relaxes when he sees Robertson goofily concede a corner. It’s 
delivered to the back post, where Loovens heads it towards goal from six yards 
but not with enough power to worry Jaukpovic.
 
44 min: A freekick and some relief for Wednesday. Wallace tries to curl it 
into the Hull box from the right. Loovens and Lees both try to get on the end 
of it but it’s fractionally too high.
 
41 min: Wednesday look like they just want to get back into the dressing room 
at level pegging. But Hull are determined to make this pressure pay. Elmohamady 
plays a delightful ball through to Odubajo, who made an enterprising run up the 
right - but the full-back’s first touch is gauche, allowing Westwood to smother 
his eventual shot.

38 min: Bannan gets on the ball deep in his own half - but Hull quickly 
converge on him and relieve him of it. Then they work it out Diamé, who sells a 
couple of lollipops to befuddled defenders at the edge of the area and then 
bounds into the box. Westwood starts to run out to him but Diamé goes for an 
early left-footed shot - and crashes out off the post!

Hewitt/Getty Images  
35 min: Hull are enjoying a spell of dominance. They’re grinding their way 
forward and now spending most of the time probing just outside Wednesday’s box. 
Carvalhal’s side are holding firm for now but their breaks are becoming rarer 
and they haven’t been able to get Bannan on the ball at all so far.
 
32 min: What a save! Elmohamady won possession in midfield and fed Diamé, who 
pinged it 20 yards forward towards Hernandez. Pudil tries to cut it out but 
only slows it down. That momentary delay allowed Westwood to surge off his line 
and he makes a terrific block from Hernandez’s 16-yard shot. And that’s why 
he’ll likely go to the Euros with Ireland (though not as no1).

29 min: Dawson is ambushed by two Wednesday player just outside hiw own box. 
Forestieri tries to punish him by firing into the top corner immediately ... 
but his sights are woefully misaligned and he sends the ball towards Wembley 
Park tube station instead.
 
26 min: How costly will that mistake from Westwood be? He carried the ball 
over his own byline under token pressure from Snodgrass, giving away a corner. 
Wednesday’s defending from the corner is equally sloppy, as Davies is allowed 
to meet it with a free header near the penalty spot. It’s a powerful downward 
effort ... but Lee is well positioned on the line and blocks it before Hooper 
completes the clearance as Dawson tried to bundle the ball into the net.

23 min: Hmmn. The game is in danger of sinking into a stalemate, primarily 
because both sides lack the final touch when they get into a position to make a 
breakthrough.
 
20 min: Robertson raids forward for the first time, cutting in from the left 
and trying to hook up with Hernandez in the middle. But Loovens steps out to 
intercept his pass. Suddenly Hooper is charging into the Wednesday half with 
menace again. The move founders when his pass to Wallace goes awry, but the 
pattern of play is clear and it’s pleasing the Wednesday fans, who are far 
noisier and more numerous than Hull’s.
 
17 min: Hull are having the lion’s (or tiger’s) share of possession but mainly 
far from the Wednesday goal. Once they enter the final third their caught in 
Wednesday’s snare and the Owls try to break with speed. It’s making for a 
fairly gripping game, though not exactly an action-packed one.
 
14 min: Wallace sends a curling shot at goal from a 25-yard freekick. It’s not 
travelling fast and should be caught easily but Jakupovic, but instead the 
keeper decides to punch it away. He could be made to pay for that, as Wallace 
regains possession and chips a cross towards the back post. But Hull’s 
defenders do what the keeper should have done and clear the danger decisively.

11 min: Foresteiri tries to score direct from the freekick despite the acute 
angle. They’ve evidently been told to test this keeper early doors, but 
Jakupovic deals with this effort as he should, punching it away without trouble.
 
10 min: Dawson makes the clearest case you’ll ever see for a yellow card, 
chopping down Foresteiri as the striker hurtled away from him down the left. 
The ref duly books the defender, who trots back into the middle to await the 
delivery of a freekick from a threatening position.

8 min: Livermore tries to make a burst from central midfield but is foiled. 
Then Huddlestone tries to do the same, but he too is denied, as Huthcinson 
wraps as leg around him and nicks the ball away. It’s keenly contested in 
midfield, almost bogged down.
 
6 min: Dawson pings a superb diagonal ball from deep to Snodgrass on the left. 
The Scot takes it in his stride and then cracks a low cross into the danger 
zone - but there was no team-mate there, Hernanadez having hung deep at the 
edge of the area. Wednesday clear.
 
4 min: Huddlestone makes a perfect connection with a shot from 20 yards, 
tonking ful-force at goal. It was straight at Westwood but the keeper had to 
show sure hands to hold it, which he did.
 
3 min: After a low-key couple of minutes, Wednesday decide it’s time to start 
posing a threat. Wallace receives the ball midway inside the Hull half and 
takes the opportunity to test Jakupovic - but his shot is charged down by a 
defender so we’ll have to wait a while longer to see what sort of form the 
keeper’s in.
 
1 min: It’s on! Hull spent the first minute giving each other some settling 
touches, and Wednesday are happy to let them so long as they don’t try to enter 
the Wednesday half.
 
Formalities completed, all that remains is for fans to jubilate before 
kickoff. They’re signing, whooping and chucking balloons and other inflatables 
about: it’s all going to end in tears for one set of fans so they might as well 
enjoy it now.

Here come the teams, both clad in their traditional garb – minus any headwear, 
alas, but otherwise this description from a match report in 1876 is close 
enough to Wednesday’s current get-up: “blue striped jerseys and smuggler’s 
caps, looking all the world like Dutch sailors.”
 
Carvalhal is speaking to Sky Sports. Unfortunately it’s not a full-body shot 
so we can’t see what he’s wearing on his lower limbs, which is a pity because 
Ian Holloway, a-punditing like only he can, has said “his short trousers are 
amazing, I don’t know how he gets away with it”. Carvalhal is not asked about 
that, only about the football, and he says: “We feel absolutely confident. WE 
have grown up like a team, from 19th position to the playoffs. We beat 
Brighton, who came third and had 15 points more than us, with our style and our 
football. We are underdogs but that doesn’t mean we don’t have ambitions to 
win. Our players know exactly what to do.”

He also suggests that he selected Sam Hutchinson to give the team extra muscle 
in midfield.
 
The man team news for Hull, then, is that Allen McGregor is still out with 
back knack so Eldin Jakupovic will continue in goal. The Swiss will be in for a 
busy afternoon if Wednesday play with the attacking brio they’ve honed under 
Carvalhal this season, helped in part by several canny signings, including 
Bannan, Wallace and Forestieri. Given the herocis of the last of that trio, we 
should pay tribute to the first foreigner to sign for Wednesday. Ante Mirocevic 
wasn’t exactly a success at Hillsborough but he paved the way for everyone from 
Di Canio to Forestieri. And he did score this, too.
 
Hello and welcome to the Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> playoff final, a whole 
other kind of Moneyball: today’s winners will gain between £170m and £200m from 
promotion to the Premier League while the losers will get a pat on the head, a 
deep pain in their gut and an invitation to begin preparing for another 46 (or 
49)-match campaign in the second tier. Those are some high stakes.


But forget about the money and think of the glory: that’s what we’re really 
interested in here. One of these clubs will rejoin the elite next season after 
waits of varying length and hardship. Hull, having been a lower-league side for 
over a century, have been yo-yoing between the top-flight and their more usual 
station since 2009 and have a strong yearning to establish themselves properly 
in the Premier League: a good chunk of the team that Steve Bruce will send out 
today have spent most of their careers in the top division and will feel that’s 
where they belong, especially as they finished two places and nine points ahead 
of today’s opponents in the regular season, even if both games between Hull and 
Wednesday teams ended in draws.


Ah, Wednesday. They used to be somebody, you know. Four times champions of 
England, three times FA Cup winners and one-time raisers of the League Cup. But 
they dropped out of the Premier League in 2000 and straight into a kinghell 
mess made by assorted suits of dubious intellect or intent. But now, as the 
Wednesday fans sing, the club in on the way back. They were (a) rescued by 
Milan Mandaric and then (b) sold to a Thai mogul and have now (c) made great 
strides under a manager from whom few people were expecting anything good: that 
sequence of events ring any bells? Dilly ding, dilly dong? Are Wednesday in the 
process of doing a Leicester? Will Carlos Carvalhal end today being almost as 
feted as Claudio Ranieri? Or will jovial Steve Bruce have the last laugh?


The answer to that will depend on many things. Will the Hull that turns up be 
the one that battered Derby County 3-0 in the semi-final first leg or the one 
that nearly threw that lead away in the second-leg after being afflicted by a 
bad dose of the yips? Carvalhal has shown himself to be a canny and bold 
tactician this season and is capable of doing what Alex Neil’s Norwich did to 
Middlesbrough in last year’s final, taking them by surprise to land decisive 
early blows, probably through the deadly Fernando Forestieri (who is also apt 
to fall rather cheaply, according to Robet Snodgrass, who has advised today’s 
ref to keep a close eye on the striker - as should Hull’s defenders). There’ll 
be twists and turns in this for sure, and possibly also triple pikes and 
somersaults, if Snodgrass is right. Stay tuned!
