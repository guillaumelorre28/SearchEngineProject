 against Chelsea since Robin van Persie in 2011, using his left foot, right 
foot and head.

GOALS OF THE DAY

only to betotally overshadowed one minute 56 seconds later 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/12/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report>
 by £36m nipperAnthony Martial. Elsewhere, it wasn’t worth much, but Chelsea’s 
Nemanja Maticthumped a thunderous inside-out left-foot drive past Tim Howard at 
Goodison Park.

MOST LOP-SIDED 

Arsenal’s near-monstering of Stoke. They fired in 29 shots, more than any 
other team in any other top-flight game this term, 23 from inside the area, and
scored only twice

SCUFFLE OF THE DAY

Pardew v Pellegrini, round two. This season’s set-to lacked the 
expletive-laden snarl of last season’s bout, but it made for decent early drama 
at Selhurst Park.

AWAY DAY OF THE DAY

League One Peterborough just love life without a manager – thumping Oldham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/oldham> 5-1 away in their first game 
since Dave Robertson’s sacking. It gave Oldham’s board ideas – they sacked 
Darren Kelly moments after the final whistle.
