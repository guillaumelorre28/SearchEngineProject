last month, City have identified the 21-year-old as their top defensive target 
for new coach Pep Guardiola despite the centre-half being ruled out until 
August with a broken leg and dislocated ankle.

The club’s sporting director Txiki Begiristain was pictured in Bilbao last

 reporting that City have told Athletic officials that they are willing to meet 
his release clause. “It is a specific request of Pep Guardiola,” read the 
report.

Laporte, who moved to Athletic as a 16-year-old, has signed four contract 
extensions since December 2013 as his status as one of the world’s best young 
defenders has grown.
