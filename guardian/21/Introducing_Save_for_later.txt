Our apps visitors have been using this feature for a while, and we hope our 
visitors on the web will find it useful too. Anything you save will be 
accessible through any other device, as long as you have signed in to the 
Guardian.

Here are a few scenarios where you might find it handy to use ‘save for later’:


Create a reading list for the day

There is a lot to read on the Guardian website and our homepage often changes. 
You may see a number of articles on a front page that you want to read. You can 
save these directly as soon as you see them by clicking on the ‘save’ icon and 
read them at your leisure throughout the day.

Not the right moment

There might be a long read 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read> or a video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/video> you can’t enjoy to its fullest right now as 
you’re on a busy commute. Why not save it on your mobile device, then sit back 
to enjoy it on a larger screen later?

Favourites

Try using the ‘save for later’ feature to build a list of favourite recipes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tone/recipes>, films you want to watch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film+tone/reviews> or books you want to read  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books+tone/reviews>so that you can refer back to 
them at a later date.
