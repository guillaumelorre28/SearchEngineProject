Real made a blistering start and Ronaldo opened the scoring after three 
minutes, attacking from the left, cutting inside Xabier Etxeita and beating 
Gorka Iraizoz for his 15th goal in 14 matches.

Athletic replied in kind, hitting Real with a string of counter-attacks and 
were level seven minutes later when the midfielder Javier Eraso pounced on a 
poor back pass from Raphaël Varane to Keylor Navas and made the most of the 
gift.

James Rodríguez restored Real’s lead in the 37th minute with a ferocious shot 
from the edge of the box that the Colombian, who has struggled for form and 
goals, celebrated with clenched fists.

Real led by two goals at half-time after Toni Kroos scored from Ronaldo’s pass 
in added time.

“If it had been 1-1 at the break, it would have been possible to get a good 
result. When we were at our best, they scored two goals,” Eraso told reporters.

Athletic were equal to Real in the first half and Aritz Aduriz hit the bar in 
the 28th minute but the home side controlled play after the interval and 
cruised to victory.

Real had Varane sent off for a second booking after he elbowed striker Aduriz 
for the second time in the match as they went for a high ball.

The game ended in a flurry with Ronaldo scoring his 21st league goal in the 
87th minute, Iraizoz denying him a hat-trick with a save a minute later and 
Athletic pulling another back with substitute Gorka Elustondo’s header in added 
time.
