The victory will also be a boost before their trip to Hertha Berlin in the 
semi-final of the DFB-Pokal on Wednesday, with the prospect still alive of them 
meeting Bayern in the final.

In the other game on Sunday, Cologne came from behind to defeat Mainz and deal 
a blow to their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season with a 
3-2 win.

After Jhon Córdoba and Leon Balogun gave Mainz a two-goal lead, Martin 
Schmidt’s players were within a point of fourth-placed Hertha Berlin.

However, a second-half collapse allowed Cologne to turn the game on its head 
and goals from Marcel Risse, Milos Jojic and Anthony Modeste earned them a win 
which should be enough to secure their place in the top flight next season.
