The Guardian <https://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian> is to join up 
with Vice as part of a content partnership which will include reports that will 
air on its nightly news programme in the US and UK.

The deal, the first of its kind that Vice News has struck with another news 
organisation, will see a small team of Guardian journalists based at Vice’s 
offices in east London.


The Guardian will bring its news expertise to the partnership, and in turn 
will be able to access Vice’s video production skills with content distributed 
to its millennial-skewed global audience.

“This partnership provides a test case for the way forward in multi-platform 
exploitation of content,” said Shane Smith, co-founder and chief executive of 
Vice’s parent company,Vice Media <https://www.theguardian.com/media/vice-media>
. “And when that content is the foremost investigative news in the business it 
becomes even more imperative. Real, fact-based, trusted news has never been 
more important and this partnership, I am very excited to say, will provide 
just that.”
