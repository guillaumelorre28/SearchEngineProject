Elsewhere in the group ...

Monaco have beaten CSKA Moscow 3-0, which means Spurs are now third in the 
group, two points behindBayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> and in something of a 
pickle regarding qualification for the last 16. I suspect Mauiricio Pochettino 
will have a long sleepless night puzzling over what the devil went wrong with 
his team tonight. It was a very peculiar performance and far from the ideal 
preparation ahead of his side’s trip to the Arsenal on Sunday.

Full-time: Spurs 0-1 Bayer Leverkusen

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over. Tottenham Hotspur have lost 1-0 following 
an uncharacteristically dreadful performance. It was downright weird, truth be 
told - almost all their players were terrible. We all have bad days at the 
office, but this one was as bad a one as I’ve seenTottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> endure since Mauricio 
Pochettino took over. They were very, very lucky to get away with a 1-0 defeat.

90+4 min: Great play from Volland, who runs the ball into the corner to hold 
it up and waste time. He wins a corner off Dele Alli, right in front of the 
Leverkusen fans. It’s played short, obviously, then Bayer win another corner, 
followed by a throw-in. This is a masterclass in running down the clock and 
their fans are loving it!

90+2 min: N’Koudou scorches down the left flank, but overcooks his cross. It 
soars over the heads of everyone in the penalty area.

88 min: Tottenham charge forward with Kyle Walker on the ball, but he’s 
dispossessed andBayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> advance in the other 
direction with Wendell putting in the hard yards. More and more empty seats can 
be seen in the previously full stadium and Tottenham’s remaining supporters are 
sitting in silence. Their team could still rescue a point they scarcely 
deserve. If they play like this against Arsenal on Sunday at lunchtime, they 
will get slaughtered.

76 min: Victor Wanyama throws a mini-strop when a throw-in deep inside the 
Spurs half doesn’t go his team’s way.Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> take it, the ball finds 
its way to Hernandez on the edge of the box and his shot is blocked by Ben 
Davies. The Spurs defender goes down injured, with the force of Little Pea’s 
piledriver having apparently damaged his ankle. Meanwhile in the stands, 
Tottenham fans are beginning to leave.

72 min: With the thick end of 20 minutes to go, it’s Bayer Leverkusen’s 
supporters who are making the most noise at Wembley, where the official 
attendance is 85,512. Many of them will be scratching their heads in 
bewilderment at a bizarre Tottenham performance. They’ve been weirdly out of 
sorts, but could still rescue something from this match.

66 min: Spurs have been riding their luck here and they’re finally punished. 
Kampl takes advantage after a couple of deflections off assorted Spurs 
defenders to slot the ball just inside the left upright from close range after 
the Spurs back four had failed to clear a Charles Aranguiz shot from distance. 
Kyle Walker with the assist there, on an evening when he and some of his 
colleagues are playing as if they’ve been drugged.

GOAL! Spurs 0-1 Bayer Leverkusen (Kampl 65)

of hair on his head, opens the scoring after Tottenham’s defence are finally 
punished for an uncharacteristically awful performance.

62 min: More comedy defending from Spurs and again Leverkusen fail to take 
advantage. Eric Dier miscontrols a dropping ball, then completely undercooks a 
headed backpass towards Hugo Lloris in his attempts to redeem himself.
He’s mugged of possession, the ball is squared for Hernandez and the Mexican 
misses with two consecutive shots. The first is blocked by Vertonghen, while he 
shoots the second straight at Lloris. How did he not score?

messes up a pass into Vincent Janssen at the near post. Jonathan Tah is on hand

56 min: After a lively start to the second half, in which Spurs initially 
looked a lot more impressive, the game has died a bit of a death. Word in 
Guardian Towers is that the FC Copenhagen v Leicester match is even worse, 
which I suppose is some small consolation.

51 min: Son skips down the left touchline and tries to cross the ball, but 
it’s put out for a corner by Benjamin Henrichs. Ben Davies swings the ball into 
the mixer, where Bernd Leno gathers.

48 min: Christian Eriksen pulls the ball inches wide of the left upright 
seconds after it looked as if Dele Alli was tripped just inside the Leverkusen 
penalty area by Oliver Toprak. So close from Eriksen, but should Tottenham have 
had a penalty? Replays are inconclusive, which shows just how difficult it is 
for referees these days.

(now corrected), due to an inability to read my own increasingly bad 
handwriting, hacks the ball down the field. Spurs clear.

Second half: Spurs 0-0 Bayer Leverkusen

46 min: The players get the second half started and I don’t think it’s an 
exaggeration to say that several Tottenham players looked very sheepish indeed 
as they walked out to resume play. They were dreadful in that first half and 
are very lucky not to be a couple of goals down.

Half-time: Spurs 0-0 Bayer Leverkusen

Spurs get the ball into the Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> goal courtesy of Dele 
Alli after Janssen had a shot saved, but it’s disallowed for a foul in the 
build-up. The sides go in at the break with the deadlock unbroken, a state of 
affairs that will please Spurs no end, considering the number of mistakes 
they’ve made in possession of the ball in front of their own goal. Some of 
their play has been breathtakingly bad and a less toothless team would have 
punished them severely. As things stand, however, it’s all to play for.

43 min: What a miss! Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> miss a glorious 
opportiunity to open the scoring, when Julian Brandt pounces to catch Kyle 
Walker dozing in possession on the edge of his own penalty are. He’s tackled by 
Vertonghen and the ball breaks to Hernandez, who pulls a low drive wide of the 
upright from the edge of the area when he looked certain to score. Actually, it 
took a deflection off Jan Vertonghen, but I’d have put the farm on Hernandez 
scoring from there. Woeful stuff from Walker. Spurs have been dreadful in 
possession around their own penalty area.

41 min: Spurs win a throw-in on the halfway line, which Walker chucks towards 
Vincent Janssen. Yep, it’s that exciting. We’ve had one attempt on goal so far, 
a shot straight at Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Lend by Christian Eriksen.

39 min: Walker plays the ball down the right wing with Moussa Sissoko in hot 
pursuit. There’s a mite too much welly on it and Leverkusen central defender 
Omer Toprak comes across to clear.

300,000 at the ‘23 cup final? Or does that not count as a ‘club match’?”

33 min: Christian Eriksen stings the palms of Bernd Leno with a rasping shot 
from about 30 yards. He was bearing down on the Leverkusen penalty area with 
options to his left and right, but decided to shoot as the opposition defenders 
were backing off him. Leno can only parry the ball straight in front of him, 
but there’s no Tottenham player on hand to capitalise on his error.

30 min: Tottenham substitution: Mousa Dembele off, Vincent Janssen on. Is 
Dembele injured? I think so, but can’t be sure. He has a long chat with 
Pochettino as he leaves the field, but doesn’t look angry at being taken off.

Our match report:

Bayer Leverkusen’s Kevin Kampl takes advantage of out-of-sorts Tottenham
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/02/tottenham-bayer-leverkusen-champions-league-match-report> 
Monaco have beaten CSKA Moscow 3-0, which means Spurs are now third in the 
group, two points behindBayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> and in something of a 
pickle regarding qualification for the last 16. I suspect Mauiricio Pochettino 
will have a long sleepless night puzzling over what the devil went wrong with 
his team tonight. It was a very peculiar performance and far from the ideal 
preparation ahead of his side’s trip to the Arsenal on Sunday.
 
Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over. Tottenham Hotspur have lost 1-0 following 
an uncharacteristically dreadful performance. It was downright weird, truth be 
told - almost all their players were terrible. We all have bad days at the 
office, but this one was as bad a one as I’ve seenTottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur> endure since Mauricio 
Pochettino took over. They were very, very lucky to get away with a 1-0 defeat.

90+4 min: Great play from Volland, who runs the ball into the corner to hold 
it up and waste time. He wins a corner off Dele Alli, right in front of the 
Leverkusen fans. It’s played short, obviously, then Bayer win another corner, 
followed by a throw-in. This is a masterclass in running down the clock and 
their fans are loving it!
 
90+2 min: N’Koudou scorches down the left flank, but overcooks his cross. It 
soars over the heads of everyone in the penalty area.
 
90 min: There’ll be five minutes of added time. Spurs win a free-kick deep in 
their own half asBayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> commit an infringement 
while attempting to run down the clock and secure their first win on English 
soil.
 
88 min: Tottenham charge forward with Kyle Walker on the ball, but he’s 
dispossessed andBayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> advance in the other 
direction with Wendell putting in the hard yards. More and more empty seats can 
be seen in the previously full stadium and Tottenham’s remaining supporters are 
sitting in silence. Their team could still rescue a point they scarcely 
deserve. If they play like this against Arsenal on Sunday at lunchtime, they 
will get slaughtered.
 
86 min: Bayer Leverkusen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen>
 substitution: Charles Aranguiz off, Kai Havertz on. Both Aranguiz and Kampl 
limped off with injuries.
 
85 min: Bayer Leverkusen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen>
 substitution: goal-scorer Kevin Kampl off, Kevin Volland, the club’s record 
signing, on.
 
84 min: Now it’s Ben Davies’s turn to go close as he pulls a left-footed shot 
inches wide of the upright.
 
82 min: So close! Eric Dier takes the free-kick and rattles the crossbar with 
a loud clang. The ball bounces down and back into play, but there’s nobody in a 
Spurs shirt on hand to poke the ball home with theBayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> defence in complete 
disarray.

81 min: Dele Alli wins a free-kick on the edge of the Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> penalty area, well right 
of centre.
 
80 min: Calhanoglu plays the ball to the far post, where Omer Toprak’s looping 
header threatens to drop under the cross-bar, but eventually lands on the roof 
of the goal.
 
79 min: Mehmedi plays the ball wide to Kampl, who gets forward. Bayer 
Leverkusen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> win a corner.
 
76 min: Victor Wanyama throws a mini-strop when a throw-in deep inside the 
Spurs half doesn’t go his team’s way.Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> take it, the ball finds 
its way to Hernandez on the edge of the box and his shot is blocked by Ben 
Davies. The Spurs defender goes down injured, with the force of Little Pea’s 
piledriver having apparently damaged his ankle. Meanwhile in the stands, 
Tottenham fans are beginning to leave.
 
73 min: Spurs use their final substitution: Son makes way for Georges-Kevin 
N’Koudou.
 
72 min: With the thick end of 20 minutes to go, it’s Bayer Leverkusen’s 
supporters who are making the most noise at Wembley, where the official 
attendance is 85,512. Many of them will be scratching their heads in 
bewilderment at a bizarre Tottenham performance. They’ve been weirdly out of 
sorts, but could still rescue something from this match.

67 min: Spurs substitution: Christian Eriksen off, Harry Winks on. Bayer 
Leverkusen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> substitution: 
Julian Brandt off, Hakan Calhanoglu on.
 
66 min: Spurs have been riding their luck here and they’re finally punished. 
Kampl takes advantage after a couple of deflections off assorted Spurs 
defenders to slot the ball just inside the left upright from close range after 
the Spurs back four had failed to clear a Charles Aranguiz shot from distance.

colleagues are playing as if they’ve been drugged.
 
The man with the white bandage, which is in fact a thick peroxide blond thatch 
of hair on his head, opens the scoring after Tottenham’s defence are finally 
punished for an uncharacteristically awful performance.

62 min: More comedy defending from Spurs and again Leverkusen fail to take 
advantage. Eric Dier miscontrols a dropping ball, then completely undercooks a 
headed backpass towards Hugo Lloris in his attempts to redeem himself.
He’s mugged of possession, the ball is squared for Hernandez and the Mexican 
misses with two consecutive shots. The first is blocked by Vertonghen, while he 
shoots the second straight at Lloris. How did he not score?
 
60 min: Kyle Walker redeems his first half indiscretions with a driving run 
through the inside right of the Leverkusen penalty area, before squaring the 
ball across the face of goal. Vincent Janssen can’t reach it.

59 min: Another counter-attack from Spurs comes to naught when Ben Davies 
messes up a pass into Vincent Janssen at the near post. Jonathan Tah is on hand 
to clear up for Leverkusen.
 
58 min: Kyle Walker blocks from Kevin Kampl as the winger with the white 
bandage on his head attempts a shot from distance.
 
56 min: After a lively start to the second half, in which Spurs initially 
looked a lot more impressive, the game has died a bit of a death. Word in 
Guardian Towers is that the FC Copenhagen v Leicester match is even worse, 
which I suppose is some small consolation.
 
53 min: Good ball through the inside left channel into the Spurs penalty area 
from Brandt to Kampl. He crosses for Hernandez, who is penalised for a foul.
 
51 min: Son skips down the left touchline and tries to cross the ball, but 
it’s put out for a corner by Benjamin Henrichs. Ben Davies swings the ball into 
the mixer, where Bernd Leno gathers.
 
48 min: Christian Eriksen pulls the ball inches wide of the left upright 
seconds after it looked as if Dele Alli was tripped just inside the Leverkusen 
penalty area by Oliver Toprak. So close from Eriksen, but should Tottenham have 
had a penalty? Replays are inconclusive, which shows just how difficult it is 
for referees these days.

47 min: Bernd Leno, who I spent the first half referring to as Bernd “Lend” 
(now corrected), due to an inability to read my own increasingly bad 
handwriting, hacks the ball down the field. Spurs clear. 
 
46 min: The players get the second half started and I don’t think it’s an 
exaggeration to say that several Tottenham players looked very sheepish indeed 
as they walked out to resume play. They were dreadful in that first half and 
are very lucky not to be a couple of goals down.
 
Meanwhile in the south of France: Group leaders Monaco are leading CSKA Moscow 
3-0.
 
Spurs get the ball into the Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> goal courtesy of Dele 
Alli after Janssen had a shot saved, but it’s disallowed for a foul in the 
build-up. The sides go in at the break with the deadlock unbroken, a state of 
affairs that will please Spurs no end, considering the number of mistakes 
they’ve made in possession of the ball in front of their own goal. Some of 
their play has been breathtakingly bad and a less toothless team would have 
punished them severely. As things stand, however, it’s all to play for.
 Alli scores, but it’s disallowed. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters  
43 min: What a miss! Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> miss a glorious 
opportiunity to open the scoring, when Julian Brandt pounces to catch Kyle 
Walker dozing in possession on the edge of his own penalty are. He’s tackled by 
Vertonghen and the ball breaks to Hernandez, who pulls a low drive wide of the 
upright from the edge of the area when he looked certain to score. Actually, it 
took a deflection off Jan Vertonghen, but I’d have put the farm on Hernandez 
scoring from there. Woeful stuff from Walker. Spurs have been dreadful in 
possession around their own penalty area.

41 min: Spurs win a throw-in on the halfway line, which Walker chucks towards 
Vincent Janssen. Yep, it’s that exciting. We’ve had one attempt on goal so far, 
a shot straight at Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Lend by Christian Eriksen.
 
39 min: Walker plays the ball down the right wing with Moussa Sissoko in hot 
pursuit. There’s a mite too much welly on it and Leverkusen central defender 
Omer Toprak comes across to clear.
 
35 min: “Please remind the mailers and wikileaks that 87.000 comes nowhere 
near the record attendance,” writes Patrick D’Arcy in Germany. “What about the 
300,000 at the ‘23 cup final? Or does that not count as a ‘club match’?”

33 min: Christian Eriksen stings the palms of Bernd Leno with a rasping shot 
from about 30 yards. He was bearing down on the Leverkusen penalty area with 
options to his left and right, but decided to shoot as the opposition defenders 
were backing off him. Leno can only parry the ball straight in front of him, 
but there’s no Tottenham player on hand to capitalise on his error.

32 min: Meanwhile in the south of France, Monaco are now leading CSKA Moscow 
2-0.
 
30 min: Tottenham substitution: Mousa Dembele off, Vincent Janssen on. Is 
Dembele injured? I think so, but can’t be sure. He has a long chat with 
Pochettino as he leaves the field, but doesn’t look angry at being taken off.

29 min: Spurs win a corner, which Bayer Leverkusen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> clear as far as Kyle 
Walker. He loses possession with a poor pass to Dele Alli, inviting Leverkusen 
to gallop clear on the counter. Mousa Dembele, who appears to be injured, 
sprints back to prevent Julian Brandt teeing up Mehmedi.
 
28 min: Having been contentiously left out, it looks as if striker Vincent 
Janssen is about to come on for Spurs.
