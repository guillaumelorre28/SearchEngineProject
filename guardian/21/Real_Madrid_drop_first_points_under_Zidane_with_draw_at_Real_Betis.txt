Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> dropped their 
first points under Zinedine Zidane in a 1-1 draw at Real Betis on Sunday.

Real could muster only a goal by Karim Benzema after 71 minutes to cancel out 
Alvaro Cejudo’s brilliant seventh-minute goal, leaving them in third place, 
four points behind Barcelona, the leaders, and Atlético Madrid.

Zidane had overseen two lopsided home wins but Real’s slip in Seville showed 
he has not cured their away ills. Zidane shrugged off his first setback since 
taking over from the sacked Rafa Benítez.

Betis withstood waves of attacks throughout the match, with the goalkeeper 
Antonio Adán, a former Real player, on sparkling form and Cristiano Ronaldo, 
Benzema and Pepe wasteful in front of goal. Zidane said his team had deserved 
more than a point.

Barça, who have a game in hand and host Atlético next weekend, lead on goal 
difference. “We will follow our working plan and we’re on the right track,” 
Zidane said. “You have to focus on the positive,” added Zidane, who was 
promoted from B team coach whenBenítez was abruptly fired

 this month.

“We dropped two points and that is the negative part but we have to think that 
we can get over this and that you have to fight for the league until the end.”

Real have what should be two relatively easy La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> games at home to Espanyol 
and away to Granada before they host Athletic Bilbao on 13 February.

They travel to the Italian capital to play Roma in the Champions League last 
16 four days later.

Zidane said Real had made things difficult with a slow start to Sunday’s game. 
“After that, with the match we played we deserved a lot more. But that’s 
football. When you have chances you have to take them. We didn’t have any luck.”
