Why do we recommend browsers?

Our site uses modern web standards to give the best possible reading 
experience for our visitors. Although we aim to be readable on all possible 
devices and browsers, not all are capable of running the full set of features.

Therefore, we currently provide the opportunity to disable certain behaviours 
while retaining the core group of navigation, article and video content.

To find out more information and how to switch these features on and off 
please see the preferencepage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/sep/22/making-theguardiancom-work-best-for-you>
.

If you are not sure which browser you are using, you can find out at 
whatbrowser.org <http://whatbrowser.org/>, where you can also find out how to 
upgrade it if necessary.
