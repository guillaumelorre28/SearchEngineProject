Residents of the Alaskan city of Barrow (due to change its name to Utqiaġvik 
on 1 December) would normally be looking out across a frozen harbour by now,but 
this year the sea is reluctant to freeze 
<http://seaice.alaska.edu/gi/observatories/barrow_webcam>.

Barrow’s average temperature for October 2016 was a balmy -1C, significantly 
warmer than the long-term average of around -8C. And over the North Pole the 
air has been a full 10C warmer than average of late.

Much of the reason for these warm temperatures and the sluggish rate of 
sea-ice formation is the exceptional summer sea-ice melt that occurred this 
year. By 10 September theNational Snow and Ice Data Center <https://nsidc.org/> 
reported that Arctic sea-ice had shrunk to an area of just 4.14m square 
kilometres – tying with 2007 for second lowest sea-ice extent on record, and 
some 740,000 square kilometres short of the record set in 2012.

The rapid melting of this ice earlier in the season gave plenty of time for 
the surface waters of the Beaufort, Chuckchi, Barents and Kara Seas to warm up, 
and it is these warm waters, combined with persistently warm dry weather 
blowing up from the south, that have boosted air temperatures andslowed the 
progress of fresh sea-ice formation <https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/>.

Summer sea-ice has been diminishing for a number of years in this region now, 
andresearch recently published in Nature Climate Change 
<http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3136.html> 
indicates that this change may be responsible for shunting the Arctic polar 
vortex towards the Eurasian continent during winter. The resulting change in 
atmospheric circulation patterns may be causing a cooler end to winter over 
parts of the Eurasian and North American continents.
