What a difference a decade makes. Back in the 00s, the corset was worn by 
women such as Christina Aguilera, Anastasia andBritney Spears 
<https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/5e/67/d3/5e67d3b5b4f26ba428026f5cff6cfb75.jpg>
, with oiled-up skin, the lowest of lowslung jeans and chokers. It was part of 
a look where sexiness was the ultimate goal. Fast forward to 2016, and the 
chokers are still there but the corset is in different territory: it’s gone 
high fashion. How? By ditching the skin. To wear the corset in the right way 
now, it needs a shirt layered underneath it.

This trend, as so often, can be traced back to the Prada catwalk. For the 
autumn/winter collection,Prada sent models down the catwalk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/25/prada-thinks-differently-at-milan-fashion-week-with-commentary-on-glamour>
 wearing all sorts of things – blazers, cloaks, patterned shirts, blouses, 
brocade dresses, coats – mostly with corsets worn over the top. It looked less 
Britney and more bag lady, and therefore way more fashion. Trust Prada to take 
something associated with sex and seduction and turn it into something 
cerebral. It’s an oddly chaste take on underwear as outerwear.

The corset-over-things trend continued at other collections: Victoria Beckham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/14/victoria-beckham-2016-fall-winter-collection>
, where they were worn over jumpers; Loewe, where a leather corset was worn 
over a T-shirt; Preen, with a floaty chiffon under a corset. These looks all 
managed to appear interesting and new in a catwalk-worthy way, while 
simultaneously showing off how trim the wearer’s waist was. Ultimately, of 
course, that is what corsets are designed to do.

This is a combination that celebrities are into. Gigi Hadid

, in herrecent superhero moment v a fan at Milan fashion week 
<https://twitter.com/HardysCloset/status/778960846219255808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
, looked the part wearing a pinstriped corset over a heavy metal T-shirt 
(remember, Wonder Woman wears what is basically a corset and pants). And Kim 
Kardashian is very familiar with the corset, having shown her preference for the
waist-trainer on Instagram <https://www.instagram.com/p/uvjQoGOS6e/>. If that 
all sounds a bit like a modern dayScarlett O’Hara in pursuit of an 18½in waist 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6zQrcQ9YE>, Kardashian has taken to the 
corset-over-shirt thing, wearing it over a chambray number back in August.

While it might be a stretch to compare Kardashian to Catherine de Medici, the 
latter had the same kind of influence in the 1500s – and all without social 
media. It was thanks to de Medici that the corset became fashionable in the 
first place, when she was the queen of France from 1547. Kardashian’s take-up 
of the corset-over-shirt trend may well have the same effect in 2016. It’s 
already been featured on theBlonde Salad 
<http://www.theblondesalad.com/fashion/trends/fall-2016-trends-hail-to-the-corset.html>
 andVogue’s website 
<http://www.vogue.com/13407416/fall-2016-rtw-corset-prada-market/>. Nearly 500 
years after de Medici, and more than 10 after Spears, the corset is back. Just 
remember the shirt underneath to keep it fashion.
