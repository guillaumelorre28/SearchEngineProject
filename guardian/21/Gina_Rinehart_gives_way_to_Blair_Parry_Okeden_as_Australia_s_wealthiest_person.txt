Gina Rinehart <https://www.theguardian.com/business/gina-rinehart> is no 
longer Australia’s richest person.

In the past five years Rinehart has topped Forbes Australia’s rich list but 
this year she has been unseated by another woman, the reclusive US-born heiress 
and longtime Australian resident Blair Parry-Okeden.

Parry-Okeden’s net worth of $12.49bn makes her the country’s richest person 
while Rinehart has fallen to second place with a net worth of $12.07bn .

Forbes says Parry-Okeden, who grew up in Hawaii and moved to her ex-husband’s 
country of birth decades ago, was recently confirmed to be an Australian 
citizen. After her mother’s 2007 death she inherited a quarter of the US media 
conglomerate Cox Enterprises.

Forbes ranks Parry-Okeden as the 16th richest woman in the world, but was 
unable to source a photograph of her for itsgallery of the top 20

Rinehart’s wealth has slipped $4.55bn in the past year, Forbes says, mainly 
due to falling iron ore prices and a legal ruling which impacted her 
shareholding in Hancock Prospecting.

The property baron Harry Triguboff ranks No 3 on this year’s list, with a net 
worth of $9.79bn.

Rising rents and increased demand for his Sydney apartments helped drive up 
Triguboff’s fortune by $1.85bn, according to Forbes.

Property sales of his apartment tower development company, Meriton, are 
expected to rise 70% this year.
