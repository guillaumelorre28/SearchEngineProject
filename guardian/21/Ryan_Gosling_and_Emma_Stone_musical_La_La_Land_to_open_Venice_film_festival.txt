The film reunites Crazy, Stupid, Love stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, and 
is pitched as a tribute to Hollywood’s golden age of musicals but will have a 
contemporary setting. It will premiere in competition on 31 August. This year’s 
jury will be headed up bySam Mendes

.

Gosling will play a jazz pianist who falls for Stone’s aspiring actor but the 
two face problems when they become more successful. JK Simmons, who won an 
Oscar for his role inWhiplash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/whiplash-review>, and the singer 
John Legend also star.

“La La Land is a film that does not merely reinvent the musical genre, it 
gives it a brand new start,” said Alberto Barbera, Venice artistic director, in 
a statement. “If Whiplash was the revelation of a new filmmaker,La La Land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/la-la-land> is his definitive, albeit 
precocious, consecration among the great directors of Hollywood’s new 
firmament.”

Last year’s festival was opened by the survival drama Everest, which received 
middling reviews and box office, but previous years have seen Oscar winners 
Birdman and Gravity kick things off.

The 31-year-old Chazelle made his name with the acclaimed drama Whiplash, 
which won three Oscars and was nominated for two more, including best picture. 
He also co-wrote the hit sci-fi thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane.

Gosling was most recently seen in action comedy The Nice Guys
