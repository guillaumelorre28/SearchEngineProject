Marine experts have warned beachgoers to avoid jellyfish-like portuguese man 
o’war that have washed up in south-west England, as they can inflict a very 
painful and potentially fatal sting.

The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said it had verified half a dozen photos 
submitted by members of the public from beaches in Cornwall and the Scilly 
Islands, but the oceanic creatures could soon appear across a much wider area 
based on previous strandings.


The last big arrivals of portuguese man o’war (Physalia physalis) in the UK 
were in 2009 and 2012, when they were reported across the English and Welsh 
coastline, as far north as the Isle of Man and as far east as the Isle of Wight.

“They are potentially hazardous so people should know they’re out there,” said 
Dr Peter Richardson, head of the MCS’s biodiversity programme. “If people are 
going to the beach this weekend and taking their kids they shouldn’t touch 
these balloon-like creatures.”


Despite looking like a jellyfish, the bright blue creatures are actually a 
floating colony of tiny organisms known as hydrozoa that behave collectively. 
The tentacles that hang off the balloon-like sac are what deliver the sting.


“It feels a bit like an electric shock, and can leave red welts on your skin. 
In some cases, but not in the UK, the stings have proved fatal, when someone 
has been stuck on the tentacle and stung repeatedly,” said Richardson.


It is not known exactly why the portuguese man o’war, which is blown by the 
wind as its flotation sac lies above the water, periodically washes up on UK 
beaches. Richardson said one theory was that they were pushed up by cyclical 
movements of oceanic water moving northwards from the equator, triggered by 
climate conditions.
