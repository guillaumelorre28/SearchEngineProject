Yeovil Town <https://www.theguardian.com/football/yeoviltown> have sacked 
their manager Gary Johnson after a grim run of results left them bottom of 
League One. Terry Skiverton takes over as caretaker until further notice, with 
Darren Way as his assistant.

Johnson was appointed for a second spell in charge of Yeovil in January 2012 
and led them to promotion, but his side struggled badly since beingrelegated 
from the Championship last season

. They are currently four points from safety with only six wins in 28 games.

Yeovil’s chairman, John Fry, told the club’s website: “The decision to relieve 
Gary of his management duties is the hardest I have been involved in during my 
23 years at Huish Park.

“I cannot speak too highly of the man who in the past brought so much success 
to our club. We part company on good terms and I would like personally to wish 
him well for the future.

“Gary took the Glovers from the Conference to the Championship and is regarded 
as one of the best managers in the Football League. More importantly, he is one 
of the most successful managers in Yeovil Town’s 119-year history.

“Unfortunately, ours is a business that depends on good results, and at this 
stage of the season the facts speak for themselves. Following our relegation 
from the Championship, we are now bottom of League One.

“After considerable discussion regarding the best way forward, the club’s 
directors decided to terminate Gary’s contract and to pursue alternative 
managerial options. I sincerely hope our incredibly loyal fans understand our 
decision.”

Johnson’s side were knocked out of the FA Cup in January
