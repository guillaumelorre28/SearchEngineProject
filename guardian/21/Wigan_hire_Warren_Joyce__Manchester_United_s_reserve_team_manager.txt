Wigan Athletic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wiganathletic> have 
announced the appointment of Manchester United’s reserve-team manager, Warren 
Joyce, as their new manager.

Joyce had been at Old Trafford since 2008, sharing the responsibility with Ole 
Gunnar Solskjaer for the first two years, and is credited with aiding the 
development of players such as Danny Welbeck, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard 
who have progressed through the academy in recent years.

The 51-year-old Joyce has signed a 3½-year deal with Wigan and replaces Gary 
Caldwell at the DW Stadium after the Scot was sacked 14 games into the
Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> season. 
“Warren has everything we are looking for,” David Sharpe, the chairman, said on 
Wigan’s official website.

“He is an exceptional coach who has a reputation within the game for being 
among the very best at bringing through young players, as his record at
Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
shows. But more than that, he has a winning mentality which transmits to his 
players and he has achieved great success in his time at United. It’s the 
perfect combination.

“Warren has had several high-profile opportunities but wants to move back into 
management and it is a measure of how highly we rate him that we are making 
such a long-term commitment.”

Joyce appeared for Bolton Wanderers and Preston North End during his playing 
days and held managerial positions at Hull City and Royal Antwerp as well as 
coaching positions at Leeds United, Stockport County and Tranmere Rovers.

He joins Wigan with the club still in the relegation zone in what is their 
final year of Premier League parachute payments.
