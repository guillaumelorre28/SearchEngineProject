 If you're someone with a penchant for scented candles and slow-dissolving bath 
salts, there's a good chance you are also the kind of person who likes to wrap 
yourself naked in a fake-fur throw, the Nineties equivalent of the sheepskin 
rug. Soft, furry, seductive and available in cheap form from any high-street 
store, it is the Diana Dors of soft furnishings. It appeals to people who have 
the works of Cecille B De Mille on video and would, given the chance, opt for a 
full-scale white wedding. It also works for people whose mothers wore 
rabbit-fur trims on their camel-hair Sunday best coat.
 The throw gets laid, pride of place, on top of the satin-effect duvet cover 
or back lit across the two-seater, black leatherette bed settee. More upmarket 
versions, such as the Calvin Klein winter-collection model, come with a silk 
trim and matching cushion covers. Downmarket options have 'extremely flammable' 
printed on the label and end up covered with fag burns.

 But by far its biggest fans are aging DJs who in their youth achieved 
small-town notoriety on the Wigan Soul Scene playing remixes of the Isaac 
Hayes' Shaft. For them, the fake-fur throw is a religious icon, an object to be 
worshipped, the only thing they take to the dry cleaners. In short, it is the 
Olympic gold of sexual trophies.
