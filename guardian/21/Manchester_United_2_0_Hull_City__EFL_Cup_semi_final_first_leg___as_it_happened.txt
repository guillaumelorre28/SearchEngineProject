Mourinho talks a bit, and says he wasn’t very impressed with the fans (or the 
players, or himself):

I was expecting a difficult match, I was not expecting to win four or five. 
1-0 for me would be always a good result, but 2-0 obviously is better. We are 
not at Wembley, but the second goal maybe is the important goal. I was a bit 
disappointed with the first half. Of course they were well organised 
defensively like I was expecting, and it wasn’t easy for us, but I think we 
were a bit sloppy, complicated things, taking an extra touch, always delaying 
the decision, giving them time to regroup. It was not our best first half. The 
players had to do better, I had to do better, the fans also could do better. 
The second half we improve just a little bit. Sunday, the players need to do 
better, I need to do better and the stadium needs to do better too.

And with that, I bid you adieu. Thanks for your eyes and your attention. It’s 
been totally adequate. Bye!

Chris Smalling says some stuff:

I think we all knew at half-time the first-half performance was not good 
enough. To come away with a 2-0 win after not the best of performances is 
pretty good. We knew how well they’d set up, but in the end second half we 
played with more tempo and got what we deserved.

Hull fought hard and admirably, creating a couple of chances and restricting 
United’s, but 2-0 reflects the match pretty accurately, really.

Final score: Manchester United 2-0 Hull City

The biggest cheer of stoppage time comes when the ball is cleared off the 
pitch and Mourinho catches it. And his is the last touch of the night, with the 
whistle coming before the throw-in can be taken.

89 mins: 2-0 was the very least that Mourinho would have considered acceptable 
from this game. He’ll probably be reasonably content now it has been achieved. 
It very nearly becomes three, but Martial’s volley is pushed away by Jakupovic.

GOAL! Manchester United 2-0 Hull City (Fellaini, 87 mins)

That’s a superb header! Martial does well to keep the ball after he falls on 
the left touchline, Darmian crosses and Fellaini, at full leap and beyond the 
far post, heads it back across goal, high and wide of Jakupovic, and in at the 
far post!

84 mins: It’s not necessarily a foregone conclusion, though: Snodgrass’s cross 
is headed away from Clucas by Valencia at full stretch. Then the corner is 
flicked on at the near post, but doesn’t land at any Tiger feet.

80 mins: There’s a slight air of will-this-do? about all of this. The crowd 
are largely quiet once again, and United are still attacking, but they aren’t 
really creating much. Their latest ends when Rashford runs onto the ball near 
the byline, but his cut-back finds only Jakupovic.

70 mins: Valencia goes down just outside the penalty area, on the right, after 
Mason tickles his ankles. Free kick, in a dangerous area.

68 mins: Looks like Mata was offside when Mkhitaryan sent in his header, and 
thus the goal shouldn’t have stood.

65 mins: Maybe not! Clucas cross to the far post, and Diomandé acrobatically

GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Hull City (Mata, 56 mins)

Valencia’s looping cross didn’t look particularly threatening, but Mkhitaryan 
jumps well, beats Meyler to it and though his header is floating wide, it 
floats straight to Mata, who taps in from two yards!

51 mins: Ooooh! Rooney comes ever so close to a 250th United goal! He’s picked 
out by Pogba’s fabulous pass, runs into space on the right of the penalty area, 
controls well, and then lashes the ball just wide of the far post.

50 mins: A nice move from Hull ends with Clucas clipping a cross into an 
excellent area, perfect for the striker running towards the far post to head 
in. Sadly, however, the striker is running towards the near post.

46 mins: Chance for United! Pogba plays the ball forward and both Rashford and 
Mkhitaryan sprint towards it. The Englishman eventually decides to leave it and 
impede Meyler instead, leaving Mkhitaryan free to burst into the area. Sadly 
his first touch was so poor the ball went straight to Jakupovic, but the 
referee, Kevin Friend, would probably have given a free kick if it hadn’t been.

Half time: Manchester United 0-0 Hull City

45+5 mins: A match that has so far hovered a little bit above the merely

end.

45 mins: A lovely run from Mkhitaryan, who bursts from midfield, flies towards 
the area and then picks out Rashford, who takes a touch to control the ball, 
pulls back his left foot, and then brings it down again into the calf of 
Meyler, who had got between the United man and the ball in the intervening 
moment.

43 mins: Pogba has another shot from outside the area, and though this one was

Jakupovic to get to.

rather than diving), and earns the night’s first booking.

37 mins: Replays suggest that when Diomandé was given offside, he a) wasn’t, 
and b) the touch was off a United head anyway, so he double wasn’t. So it’s 
just as well the ball didn’t go in, or we’d all be convulsed with ref-rage.

for Snodgrass to feel he could bother De Gea. He bothers the wall.

across goal and, with De Gea beaten, gently against the woodwork.

Mourinho talks a bit, and says he wasn’t very impressed with the fans (or the 
players, or himself):

I was expecting a difficult match, I was not expecting to win four or five. 
1-0 for me would be always a good result, but 2-0 obviously is better. We are 
not at Wembley, but the second goal maybe is the important goal. I was a bit 
disappointed with the first half. Of course they were well organised 
defensively like I was expecting, and it wasn’t easy for us, but I think we 
were a bit sloppy, complicated things, taking an extra touch, always delaying 
the decision, giving them time to regroup. It was not our best first half. The 
players had to do better, I had to do better, the fans also could do better. 
The second half we improve just a little bit. Sunday, the players need to do 
better, I need to do better and the stadium needs to do better too.

And with that, I bid you adieu. Thanks for your eyes and your attention. It’s 
been totally adequate. Bye!

Chris Smalling says some stuff:

I think we all knew at half-time the first-half performance was not good 
enough. To come away with a 2-0 win after not the best of performances is 
pretty good. We knew how well they’d set up, but in the end second half we 
played with more tempo and got what we deserved.
 
Hull fought hard and admirably, creating a couple of chances and restricting 
United’s, but 2-0 reflects the match pretty accurately, really.
 
The biggest cheer of stoppage time comes when the ball is cleared off the 
pitch and Mourinho catches it. And his is the last touch of the night, with the 
whistle coming before the throw-in can be taken.
 
90+4 mins: And United seem intent on spending every one of them passing the 
ball around midfield.
 
90+1 mins: There’ll be about four minutes of stoppage time.
 
90 mins: The match ends with another potential injury for Hull: Tymon limps 
off after receiving treatment for a couple of minutes, supported by two 
physios, and James Weir replaces him.
 
89 mins: 2-0 was the very least that Mourinho would have considered acceptable 
from this game. He’ll probably be reasonably content now it has been achieved. 
It very nearly becomes three, but Martial’s volley is pushed away by Jakupovic.

That’s a superb header! Martial does well to keep the ball after he falls on 
the left touchline, Darmian crosses and Fellaini, at full leap and beyond the 
far post, heads it back across goal, high and wide of Jakupovic, and in at the 
far post!

84 mins: It’s not necessarily a foregone conclusion, though: Snodgrass’s cross 
is headed away from Clucas by Valencia at full stretch. Then the corner is 
flicked on at the near post, but doesn’t land at any Tiger feet.
 
83 mins: Now Rashford races down the right, but this time his pull-back finds 
Meyler.
 
80 mins: There’s a slight air of will-this-do? about all of this. The crowd 
are largely quiet once again, and United are still attacking, but they aren’t 
really creating much. Their latest ends when Rashford runs onto the ball near 
the byline, but his cut-back finds only Jakupovic.
 
79 mins: United make their final substitution, taking Mata off and bringing 
Fellaini on.
 
75 mins: Robertson gets down the left, feeds the ball inside and after a 
helpful ricochet it rolls to Maloney, whose first touch is a 25-yarder that 
rolls wide.
 
74 mins: Hull make a change, bringing Shaun Maloney on for Diomande.
 
73 mins: Pogba hits the post! The keeper is totally and emphatically beaten, 
but the ball curls away from him and into the meat of the post before bouncing 
clear!

73 mins: United have another free kick, more dangerous than the last, from 
which it looks like either Pogba or Mata will shoot.

 
71 mins: United’s second substitution sees Jesse Lingard replace Mkhitaryan.
 
70 mins: Which is passes towards Martial, but intercepted and booted upfield.
 
70 mins: Valencia goes down just outside the penalty area, on the right, after 
Mason tickles his ankles. Free kick, in a dangerous area.
 
68 mins: Looks like Mata was offside when Mkhitaryan sent in his header, and 
thus the goal shouldn’t have stood.
 
65 mins: Maybe not! Clucas cross to the far post, and Diomandé acrobatically 
and viciously volleys high at the far post. He was marked by Valencia, who made 
only the most half-hearted attempt to stop him.
 
63 mins: Snodgrass’s free kicks are just about Hull’s only source of 
goalscoring optimism, but his latest gets headed away simply enough.
 
59 mins: It may well, but Mourinho feels the game needs a touch of Anthony 
Martial, who comes on in place of Rooney.

@Simon_Burnton <https://twitter.com/Simon_Burnton> I think the game needs a 
touch of Michael Carrick..

Valencia’s looping cross didn’t look particularly threatening, but Mkhitaryan 
jumps well, beats Meyler to it and though his header is floating wide, it 
floats straight to Mata, who taps in from two yards!

55 mins: Another nearly-chance for United, with Pogba’s shot from just inside 
the area being blocked by Maguire.
 
54 mins: Sadly it does. I wouldn’t say the match is sad, it’s just pre-happy.

@Simon_Burnton <https://twitter.com/Simon_Burnton> Seems like you like the 
word "Sadly". Either that or the state of the match is truly sad.#notwatching

51 mins: Ooooh! Rooney comes ever so close to a 250th United goal! He’s picked 
out by Pogba’s fabulous pass, runs into space on the right of the penalty area, 
controls well, and then lashes the ball just wide of the far post.

50 mins: A nice move from Hull ends with Clucas clipping a cross into an 
excellent area, perfect for the striker running towards the far post to head 
in. Sadly, however, the striker is running towards the near post.
 
46 mins: Chance for United! Pogba plays the ball forward and both Rashford and 
Mkhitaryan sprint towards it. The Englishman eventually decides to leave it and 
impede Meyler instead, leaving Mkhitaryan free to burst into the area. Sadly 
his first touch was so poor the ball went straight to Jakupovic, but the 
referee, Kevin Friend, would probably have given a free kick if it hadn’t been.
 
46 mins: Peeeep! Hull get half two under way.

There’s surely a goal coming for United here, though Mourinho may well have a 
plan to expedite it. There’s been way too much random shooting from distance, 
though, which Hull will be pretty happy with.
 
“If it was twice as well regarded it would still be a two bob trophy” – nice 
line.

45+5 mins: A match that has so far hovered a little bit above the merely 
interesting but some way bellow the genuinely thrilling comes to a temporary 
end.
 
45+3 mins: Mourinho’s already gone down the tunnel.

45+2 mins: Meanwhile we’re in stoppage time, and there’ll be at least four 
minutes of it.
 
45 mins: A lovely run from Mkhitaryan, who bursts from midfield, flies towards 
the area and then picks out Rashford, who takes a touch to control the ball, 
pulls back his left foot, and then brings it down again into the calf of 
Meyler, who had got between the United man and the ball in the intervening 
moment.
 
43 mins: Pogba has another shot from outside the area, and though this one was 
on target – curling just inside the post, in fact – it was slow enough for 
Jakupovic to get to.
 
43 mins: I’m only watching on the telly, but this certainly seems true. A goal 
might help.

42 mins: Suddenly, down the other end, Snodgrass finds Hernandez, whose 
optimistic low shot from an angle rolls straight into De Gea’s gloves.
 
41 mins: Valencia crosses from the right and it looks perfect for Pogba, but 
at the last second he leans out of the way of the ball, and behind him Herrera 
is too astonished to do anything.
 
40 mins: Maguire takes out Mkhitaryan on the left wing (strictly speaking he 
doesn’t touch him, but the United player could have been getting out of the way 
rather than diving), and earns the night’s first booking.

37 mins: Replays suggest that when Diomandé was given offside, he a) wasn’t, 
and b) the touch was off a United head anyway, so he double wasn’t. So it’s 
just as well the ball didn’t go in, or we’d all be convulsed with ref-rage.
 
35 mins: Hull win another free-kick, this time just about close enough to goal 
for Snodgrass to feel he could bother De Gea. He bothers the wall.
 
33 mins: Herrera has a go at shooting high from outside the penalty area.
 
31 mins: The linesman ended the attack with his flag in the air, so the goal 
may not have stood had there in fact been one.
 
31 mins: Hull hit the post! It’s another free-kick, deep on the left this 
time, and it flicks off a head to Diomandé at the far post, who sends it back 
across goal and, with De Gea beaten, gently against the woodwork.
