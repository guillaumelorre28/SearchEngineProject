An American consortium led by John Jay Moores and Charles Noell had been in 
discussions to finalise a £50m deal with Hasawi, who made the announcement on 
Friday night that talks had “come to an end”.

“It is with great regret and disappointment that the club announces today 
that, despite much speculation in the media, all negotiations in regard to a 
partial sale of the club to US owners have come to an end,” said Hasawi.

“We feel strongly that we have acted in good faith on behalf of the club and 
its fans and that such a deal as it stands is not in the interests of the 
long-term future of our club. Thank you for your continued support at this 
difficult time for the club.”

Hasawi bought Nottingham Forest in 2012 with high hopes of promotion to the 
Premier League. However, the club have stagnated and currently lie in 20th 
place in the Championship, just two points above the relegation zone. The 
club’s manager, Philippe Montanier, was appointed in the summer and is the 
eighth different head coach to serve under Hasawi’s tenure.
