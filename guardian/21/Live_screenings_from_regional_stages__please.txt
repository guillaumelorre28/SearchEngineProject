Your correspondents are too quick to praise live screenings (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/01/shifty-shades-of-grey-and-yellow-wagtails>
, 2 August). Live screenings may be a valid experience when I see overprovided 
and oversubsidised London audiences flocking to performances beamed from 
Newcastle, Wakefield, Truro etc, where costs are cheaper and where professional 
theatre is comparatively rare. The present arrangement is a stale excuse from 
so-called national companies to avoid their responsibilities to those of us for 
whom London is not accessible.

• What constitutes high quality? What if I don’t like opera (OK, I quite like 
Carmen) and only drink beer? Does that make me a northern heathen? Any road up, 
it’ll be reet when I see Gandalf and Jean-Luc Picard at’t Lyceum next Tuesday. 
No wine at the interval!

• Maybe this hand-washing thing (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/02/tips-for-when-the-phone-scammers-call>
, 3 August) comes from the US. WH Auden criticised “the American habit of 
washing one’s hands after pissing, as if the penis were an object, too filthy 
for any decent person to touch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/26/auden-diary-bought-british-library>
”. Americans do seem particularly enthusiastic about it, often scrubbing up as 
if they were about to carry out open-heart surgery.

• Regarding “Honestly, you really must come round for dinner soon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/sincerity-english-lying-decency-sweden>
” (30 July). I did once hear the Swedish language referred to as ordfattig 
(word poor). That apart, I loved Andrew Brown’s article and please do insist he 
drops round for supper – anytime.

• Samantha Cameron’s stylist and George Osborne’s aide are in line for OBEs on 
top of generous salaries (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/31/remain-campaign-leaders-tory-donors-honours-david-cameron>
, 1 August). No award forJosh Coombes, a young barber who gives free haircuts 
to the homeless in Exeter

, there no doubt thanks to Cameron’s and Osborne’s austerity measures.

• So the Guardian is encouraged to drop titles and stick to the given name and 
surname (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/02/david-cameron-dishonourable-list-devalues-true-service>
, 3 August). An excellent idea. Quakers have been doing this for more than 350 
years.
