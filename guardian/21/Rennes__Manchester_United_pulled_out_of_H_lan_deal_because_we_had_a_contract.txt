The Rennes general manager, Pierre Dréossi, has said that Manchester United 
had initially tried to sign the teenage defender Jérémy Hélan, the subject of a 
complaint by the French club to Fifa. The world governing body is investigating 
Manchester City over claims by Rennes that they illegally poached the 
17-year-old in February. City haveinsisted they acted within the rules

 and did not induce the player to breach his contract.

"United understood that it was impossible to make a deal as they didn't want 
to steal the player from us," Dréossi said. "They stepped back.

"We asked Fifa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa> to intervene on 19 
March, after City took him from us at the end of January. City had the feeling 
that the player was free, but we had told them that he was under contract with 
us for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 seasons.

"We think that City should have got more information before trying to sign 
him."

The dispute between Rennes <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rennes> and 
Hélan is currently going through the French courts.

"The player didn't want to stay at Rennes and wanted to go to City so he asked 
all the French league's commissions to rule in his favour," Dréossi said. "He 
even went before the French Olympic Committee and every time his request was 
denied. So he decided to refer the matter to the French labour courts."

City claimed the dispute pre-dated their interest in Hélan. "City obviously 
cannot comment on the case until the French judicial process has run its 
course," a spokesman for thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> club said. "However, we 
are comfortable that we have acted within the rules throughout the process and 
in no way induced any breach of contract by Jérémy Hélan."
