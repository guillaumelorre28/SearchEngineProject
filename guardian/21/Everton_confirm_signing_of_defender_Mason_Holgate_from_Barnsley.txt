The manager, Roberto Martínez, said Holgate, who has made 22 senior 
appearances for Barnsley since making his debut last December, was an exciting 
prospect and intends to develop him .

“With Mason, an opportunity came up and we didn’t want to lose out,” Martínez 
said. “He is a young man with a very impressive future.

“His development is going to be important and it will be interesting to see 
how quickly he can have an impact on the first team. But he is not a player who 
I would expect to perform straight away in the Premier League – that would be 
very unfair.

“Mason, already at 18, has played 20 games in League One, which shows his 
incredible potential. I feel that we are the perfect place in order for Mason 
to develop into a top footballer. I know that he is a player who can bring us 
something quite unique, so we are excited about that possibility, even though 
he is one for the future rather than now.”
