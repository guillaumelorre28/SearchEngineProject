 with their biggest league win of the season to move seven points ahead of 
their city rivals, who will have a chance to make up some ground when they face 
bottom-placed Levante in Valencia on Wednesday.

Against ninth-placed Sociedad, Atlético took the lead after eight minutes when 
a cross from Keko was turned into his own net by the midfielder Diego Reyes. 
However, it took them until just after half-time to double their lead, the 
striker Luciano Vietto latching on to a poor clearance and pulling the ball 
back for Saúl Ñíguez to shoot past Gerónimo Rulli

The French international Antoine Griezmann, whose goal had earned the win over 
Real, completed the scoring with a 61st-minute penalty against his former club, 
after he had been brought down by Alberto de la Bella.

Sociedad almost pulled a goal back two minutes later but Jonathas headed 
against the post from Ruben Pardo’s cross.
