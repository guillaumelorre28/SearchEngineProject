Sony Music Entertainment’s Twitter account was hacked on Monday, publishing 
fake statements that pop music iconBritney Spears 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/britneyspears> had died.

Sony Music, a unit of Sony <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sony> Corp, 
said in a short statement that its social media account was “compromised” but 
that the situation “has been rectified”.

 The company said it “apologizes to Britney Spears and her fans for any 
confusion”.

A Sony spokeswoman refused to comment further. A Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> spokesman did not return 
emails seeking comment.

 The 35-year-old international superstar and Grammy award winner “is fine and 
well”, Spears’ manager Adam Leber told CNN.

 In the first of several false tweets on Monday, the company’s Sony Music 
Global Twitter account published a short message reading “RIP @britneyspears” 
and “RIPBritney 1981-2016”, along with a teary-eyed emoji, Variety and 
Billboard magazines reported.

 The fake tweets were soon removed. In some tweets, the group OurMine took 
responsibility, Billboard reported.

 The Twitter account of folk music icon Bob Dylan may also have been subjected 
to a hoax, Billboard reported, when it sent out a now-deleted tweet reading 
“Rest in peace @britneyspears”.

 The Sony spokeswoman confirmed that Dylan is also a Sony artist and that the 
company’s statement “holds true for what’s happened”.

 Another unit of Sony, Sony Pictures Entertainment, was the victim of a 
devastating cyber-attack in November 2014, which the FBI concluded wasthe work 
of North Korea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/08/fbi-north-korea-accusation-sony-pictures-hack>
. That hack came a month before Sony Pictures was due to release the film The 
Interview, about two journalists recruited by the CIA to assassinate North 
Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
