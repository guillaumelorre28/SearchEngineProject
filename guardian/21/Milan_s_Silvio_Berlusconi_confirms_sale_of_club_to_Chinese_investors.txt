Berlusconi, who bought the club in 1986, has been negotiating for more than a 
year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/02/milan-silvio-berlusconi-milan-chinese-takeover>
 with various interested parties but is now confident that a deal will now be 
completed after he was released from hospital on Tuesday after heart surgery.

“I had a period of 26 years which then became 30. My concern is that during 
the last four years, I have not managed to do things as I did in the past,” he 
said.

“The choice I am making is an important one. I want to deliver AC Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> to people who can make the club 
a major force again not only in Italy but in Europe and the world.

“There is a commitment from the new investors to pay €400m over the next two 
years and I’m selling the club to people who can bring it back to where it 
belongs.”

Milan, who reported a loss of €93.5m last year, appointed Vincenzo Montella 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/29/milan-vincenzo-montella-new-head-coach>
 as their new coach last week. They finished seventh in the league last season 
and will miss out on Europe for a third successive campaign.

Robin Li, the founder of search engine Baidu and rated as China’s 
sixth-richest man, is believed to be leading the consortium, which will 
purchase a 70% share in the club.

If completed, they will become the latest group of investors from China to buy 
a stake in a European club. In December, Manchester City’s holding company City 
Football Group announced a $400m (£265m) investment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/01/manchester-city-265m-deal-chinese-investment-group>
 from a Chinese consortium, CMC, while property group Dalian Wanda bought a 20% 
stake in Champions League finalists Atlético Madrid last year.
