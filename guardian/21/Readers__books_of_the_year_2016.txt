<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/371176/?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
 by Erwin James (Bloomsbury Circus)

Of the many books that have engaged me this year, three stand out: James shows 
in a brutally honest memoir how someone can be saved, andThe Year of the 
Runaways 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/19/the-year-of-the-runaways-sunjeev-sahota-review-political-novel>
 by Sunjeev Sahota (Picador) depicts a life that many of us choose to ignore. 
More recently I have been transported to Cumbria by Sarah Hall’sThe Wolf Border 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/01/the-wolf-border-by-sarah-hall-review>
 (Faber), which has all the ingredients to keep you reading and wondering if it 
might actually come true.

Looking to Heaven 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/looking-to-heaven.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
by Stanley Spencer and John Spencer (Unicorn)

The first volume of Spencer’s autobiography, edited by his grandson, tells the 
story of his early years and how his life and paintings were transformed by his 
war experiences. The writing conveys both his sympathy for the plight of the 
men who had endured the war and its longer term consequences, and the book 
marks the period in his life when he moved from being a good artist to a great 
one.

The Marches  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/18/the-marches-rory-stewart-review-brian-border-england-scotland>
by Rory Stewart (Jonathan Cape)

A chance encounter with Stewart on Radio 4 led me to one of the most 
unexpected and enjoyable reads of 2016. Stewart embarks on walks along 
Hadrian’s Wall and from his home in the Lake District to his family 
“parklet”(!) in Crieff. The book fizzes with erudition and is delightfully 
leavened by the companionship of his aged and doughty father, who infuriates 
and is deeply loved in equal measure.
Kate Anderson, Sheffield

David Astor  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/18/david-astor-a-life-in-print-jeremy-lewis-review-biography>
by Jeremy Lewis (Jonathan Cape)

Like previous books by this biographer Lewis’s David Astor is well researched, 
and an absorbing read for those, like me, brought up in the 50s and 60s on the 
Observer, when Astor was editor. It also shows how much Astor helped friends in 
need, such as George Orwell.

The Joyce Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/12/the-joyce-girl-annabel-abbs-review>
by Annabel Abbs (Impress)


Lucia is the daughter of novelist James, a black hole who swallows both the 
world’s attention and domestic affection in industrial quantities. Dancing for 
the audiences of avant-garde Paris offers young Lucia an outlet, while her 
father’s friend Samuel Beckett offers romantic promise. But what begins as 
amusing scattiness starts tipping towards something darker and sadder. Abbs 
handles the parabola of this real life story with tremendous assurance.

Vinegar Girl: The Taming of the Shrew Retold  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/12/anne-tyler-vinegar-girl-review-taming-shrew-update>
by Anne Tyler (Hogarth)

This retelling of Shakespeare’s most problematic play, from a feminist point 
of view, features prickly, no-nonsense Kate Battista. She reluctantly agrees to 
a marriage of convenience to her father’s gifted eastern European lab 
assistant, Pytor Cherbakov, so he can get a green card and stay in the US. Much 
to everyone’s surprise, including her own, Kate is won over by Pytor and 
becomes his Katya. Tyler serves up a sweetly rendered, thoroughly modern love 
story.

Being a Beast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/03/being-beast-charles-foster-review-man-whoate-worms-like-badger>
 by Charles Foster (Profile)

Foster’s attempts to live like various animals is my book of the year. Funny, 
exuberant and courageous, nudging closer and closer to how it might feel to 
enter the non-human world. Two memoirs have made me laugh and cry: Chris 
Packham’sFingers in the Sparkle Jar

A Country Road, a Tree 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/27/a-country-road-a-tree-by-jo-baker-review>
 by Jo Baker (Doubleday)

Baker’s fictionalised account 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/27/a-country-road-a-tree-by-jo-baker-review>
 of Samuel Beckett’s time in France during the occupation and his work for the 
resistance gives us an insight into his development as a writer. What I admired 
most was Baker’s ability to convey a sense of Beckett’s own writing without 
imitating it.

Respectable: The Experience of Class  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/14/respectable-by-lynsey-hanley-review-class>
by Lynsey Hanley (Allen Lane)

Hanley’s study is about the effect of social mobility on the individual, the 
anxiety and loneliness and at times the absurdity of getting from “there” to 
“here”. It may sound dry and dusty, but it is actually amusing and emotionally 
gripping, especially for those of us who have travelled a similar route.

 edited by Nikesh Shukla (Unbound)

This collection of essays by 21 BAME writers voices a plea for nuance in our 
discourse on diversity. Variously funny, poignant, polemical and 
anger-inducing, the collection is existentially challenging to the status quo. 
It could not be more timely.Breach

Off the Shelf: A Celebration of Bookshops in Verse 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ibw-carol-ann-duffy-collection.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
 edited by Carol Ann Duffy (Picador)

There is nothing more enjoyable than browsing in a bookshop and my choices 
this year are concerned with them. Duffy’s anthology has a post-apocalyptic 
bookshop, a flooded bookshop, a visit to Bookbarn International, but what 
shines through is a love for bookshops and reading. Jorge Carrión’sBookshops 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bookshops.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
, translated by Peter Bush, (MacLehose) is not just a travelogue around amazing 
bookshops of the world, but also a history of bookshops and their importance.

Treasure Palaces 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/14/treasure-palaces-great-writers-visit-great-museums-maggie-fergusson-review>
edited by Maggie Fergusson (Economist/Profile)

As a coping strategy for the events of 2016, rather than hiding under the 
duvet, I gratefully dip into this collection of essays in which great writers 
recount their visits to great museums. This is a beautifully produced book with 
illustrations by Steve Panton. The writers range from Jacqueline Wilson via 
Andrew Motion to Roddy Doyle. The destinations include Kabul, Dove Cottage and 
the National Gallery of Victoria. Perhaps most fittingly for 2016, Aminatta 
Forna describes the Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb. But there’s also 
Matthew Sweet’s view of Abba: The Museum in Stockholm, so thank you for the 
music to lift our spirits.

Worktown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/16/worktown-astonishing-story-mass-observation-david-hall-review>
 by David Hall (Weidenfeld & Nicolson)

This is the revealing story of the birth of Mass Observation. In the first 
project of its kind, the anthropologist Tom Harris son took privileged 
university boys and girls north to late 1930s Bolton, to live in a chaotic 
terraced house where they studied the lives of the community, much to the 
amusement of the townsfolk. With teaching the history of art no longer under 
threat in our schools I would also recommend putting a copy of Will Gompertz’s 
What Are You Looking At? 150 Years of Modern Art in the Blink of an Eye 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/29/what-are-you-looking-at-by-will-gompertz-review-modern-art-duchamp>
 (Penguin) on the new syllabus. It’s both jargon-free and accessible.

The Vanishing Man: In Pursuit of Velázquez  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/08/vanishing-man-velazquez-laura-cumming-review>
by Laura Cumming (Chatto & Windus)

In 1845 John Snare, a Reading bookseller, acquired for £8 a portrait of 
Charles I undertaken shortly before he became king. It was supposedly painted 
by Velázquez in 1629. Snare’s endeavours to authenticate “whodunit” create a 
gripping tale with as many twists and turns as a detective story, and 
ultimately his obsession becomes his downfall. Cumming’s investigation is 
immaculately researched and told. She has also woven into her text a 
masterclass on the life and works of Velázquez.

Tim Winton, best known for his award-winning novels, enhanced his reputation 
withIsland Home: A Landscape Memoir 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/08/island-home-tim-winton-review-love-song-to-australia>
 (Picador). This succinct volume is part childhood recollection and partcri de 
coeur against our rampant addiction to materialism. Although set in Australia 
with vivid wilderness descriptions, his theme that you “attempt to tame nature 
at your peril” is universal.
David Fothergill, Pocklington, Yorkshire

The Big Book of Science Fiction, edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer (Vintage)

This 1,200-page chronological survey of the genre includes many freshly 
translated foreign language stories from countries as diverse as Argentina, 
Russia and China, and strong feminist and social themes. One of the best is 
“Story of Your Life” by Ted Chiang, which melds physics and linguistics in a 
most intelligent way and was the basis of the recent filmArrival

Commonwealth  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/29/commonwealth-ann-patchett-review>
by Ann Patchett (Bloomsbury)

At the heart of the novel is a family story that is appropriated by another 
character – an author – the consequences of which ripple out to every family 
member. I was also utterly absorbed byThe Underground Railroad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/09/the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead-review-american-slavery>
 by Colson Whitehead (Fleet), the nail-biting story of a woman’s escape from 
life as a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Cora is transported via the 
metaphorical underground railroad, which the author has transformed into a 
literal network of secret tunnels and stations across America.
Nicola Gooch, York

The Silk Roads: A New History of the World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/29/silk-roads-peter-frankopan-review>
 by Peter Frankopan (Bloomsbury)

A big book like this would have taken the whole year to read if I had followed 
up every reference that piqued my interest. A compendium of Eurasian trade in 
goods, technology and ideas over millennia, it really does give a history of 
the world, up to the present war in Syria. If Frankopan does not write much 
about South America, the continent is the core of The Invention of Nature 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/13/the-invention-of-nature-the-adventures-of-alexander-von-humboldt-andrea-wulf-review>
 (John Murray), Andrea Wulf’s comprehensive narrative of Alexander von 
Humboldt’s life and works. While stylishly revealing his amazing insights and 
discoveries, including the concept of ecology, her account portrays a genuinely 
nice man.
Catriona Graham, Edinburgh




The Underground Railroad  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/09/the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead-review-american-slavery>
by Colson Whitehead

Two wholly different American novels gave me the “can’t go on, must go on” 
sensation this year. Whitehead’s novel tells a moving story about slavery and 
the possible routes of escape. In complete contrast was Jonathan Moore’s The 
Poison Artist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/28/poison-artist-jonathan-moore-thriller-review>
 (Orion). This equally compelling but much less salubrious novel is convoluted 
and complex, revealing the seedy links between the key character, Dr Caleb 
Maddox, absinthe and derangement. Avoid them in real life but enjoy them in 
fiction.
Kate Johnson, Mirfield, West Yorkshire

Black Out 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/blackout-470244.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
by Ragnar Jonasson (Orenda)

The third of Jonasson’s Dark Iceland series to be translated into English (by 
Quentin Bates) and easily the best yet. Mostly set in Siglufjörður, an isolated 
town in the north surrounded by mountains and facing out into a loch just 
outside the Arctic Circle, it is beautifully written and elegantly paced with a 
plot that only gradually becomes visible, as if the reader had been staring 
into the freezing fog waiting for shapes to emerge. In joyous contrast, the 
disarming illustrations and informative and witty words of Matt Sewell’sA Charm 
of Goldfinches & Other Collective Nouns 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/charm-of-goldfinches-and-other-collective-nouns.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
(Ebury) is utterly delightful. Find out why it’s a “deceit” of lapwings. 
Fabulous!

Spitalfields: The History of a Nation in a Handful of Streets 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/spitalfields.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
 by Dan Cruickshank (Random House)

This book is not just about a fascinating area of London but, in the era of 
Brexit, it provides an account of how immigration shaped the history of the UK 
in every aspect, and how without it we would be a lesser people. Cruickshank 
narrates a story of immense change which continues to this day, and calls for a 
response to the destruction of not only a way of life but of memory by forces 
that are not benign and affect us all.
Cyril Kavanagh, Kingston

Agatha: The Real Life of Agatha Christie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/02/agatha-real-life-christie-review-anne-martinetti-guillaume-lebeau-alexandre-franc-self-made-hero>
 by Anne Martinetti, Guillaume Lebeau and Alexandre Franc (SelfMadeHero)

Graphic novels have never appealed to me, but as I’m a Christie enthusiast I 
thought I’d try this, and I was bowled over. It tells Christie’s life in 
pictures and with simple dialogue, but what makes it special is that her 
detectives appear occasionally as real people with whom she has conversations, 
not always amiable. This is a tender, moving tribute to a great author.
Anne Kirkman, Cambridge

The Noise of Time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/22/the-noise-of-time-by-julian-barnes-shostakovich-stalin-review>
 by Julian Barnes (Jonathan Cape)

Other authors have tackled Stalinist Russia through fiction but Barnes’s book 
about Shostakovich, of whom I knew very little, taught me much about power, 
bravery and compromise in lives lived under the Stalinist terror.

The Gustave Sonata  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/13/the-gustav-sonata-by-rose-tremain-review>
by Rose Tremain (Chatto & Windus) is a compelling read and a deeply moving 
story about friendship and a life apparently unfulfilled. A man who repeatedly 
saves people, but who cannot accept being loved until late in life gives those 
of us in that age group hope that we may not be completely emotionally and 
psychologically set.

Kate Latham, St Ann’s Chapel, Cornwall

And the Sun Shines Now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/01/and-the-sun-shines-now-hillsborough-aiden-tempany-review>
 by Adrian Tempany (Faber)


Written by a journalist and survivor of Hillsborough, this is a lucid, honest, 
captivating and sensitive account of the tragedy in April 1989, its aftermath 
and repercussions, both for the victims and for football in general. To be read 
by everyone, but especially younger people who want to know how the game 
became, certainly in England, the money-soaked commercial enterprise it is 
today.

The Holy Roman Empire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/01/holy-roman-empire-peter-wilson-europe-charlemagne>

Two outstanding transnational histories were published this year: The Holy

<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/04/the-pursuit-of-power-europe-penguin-richard-j-evans>
(Allen Lane). A great deal more than the sum of national parts, these 
multi-layered works impress in erudition and judgment. How apt they should have 
appeared in the year of the Brexit referendum. Science continues to be well 
served and I doubt we shall get a better written and informed account of the 
ubiquitous microbial world than Ed Yong’sI Contain Multitudes: The Microbes 
Within Us and a Grander View of Life

The Lesser Bohemians 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/02/the-lesser-bohemians-by-eimear-mcbride-review>
by Eimear McBride (Faber)

Two books by Irish writers helped me see the world with new eyes. McBride’s 
novel is about the raw exhilaration of youth. It charts the ordinary chaos and 
joy of early adulthood in an extraordinary fashion. The other – Seamus 
O’Mahony’sThe Way We Die Now 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/way-we-die-now-472724.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
 (Head of Zeus ) – is about kindness and courage in the face of death. The 
authoris a doctor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/21/death-not-a-medical-problem-but-part-of-life>
, critical of contemporary attitudes, who wants to see death reclaimed from the 
medics. I don’t agree with everything in it, but it left me both unsettled and 
strangely reinvigorated.

<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dashing-for-the-post.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
edited by Adam Sisman (John Murray)


Like many people, my introduction to Leigh Fermor was A Time for Gifts. These 
letters cover the years from 1940 to 2010 and provide a fascinating and 
engaging sort of autobiography full of the charm found in his travel writings. 
Wonderful to dip into.

A Very English Scandal: Sex, Lies and a Murder Plot at the Heart of the 
Establishment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/09/very-english-scandal-jeremy-thorpe-john-preston>
 by John Preston (Viking)

Wonderfully illuminating and entertaining. Preston ignites the familiar, but 
still extraordinary, account of Jeremy Thorpe’s rise and fall with pace, humour 
and colour. The supporting cast is rich and varied too. Thorpe’s status as a 
major figure of the establishment was in his favour. Ranks closed to protect 
him all the way to his trial.

The Essex Serpent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/16/the-essex-serpent-sarah-perry-review-novel>
 by Sarah Perry (Serpent’s Tail)

Immersing myself in Perry’s outstanding novel was certainly one this year’s 
highlights. Also, Olivia Laing’s fascinating study of metropolitan alienation in
The Lonely City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/19/the-lonely-city-the-art-of-being-alone-olivia-laing-review>
(Canongate). Plus, a terrific anthology ofEnglish Renaissance Poetry (NYRB) 
edited by John Williams and Frances Wilson’s biography of Thomas De Quincey,
Guilty Thing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/23/guilty-thing-frances-wilson-review-thomas-de-quincey-biography>
 (Bloomsbury).

A Life Discarded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/03/a-life-discarded-18-diaries-found-in-a-skip-alexander-masters-review-fourth-4th-estate-dido-davies>
 by Alexander Masters (4th Estate)

I was intrigued and entertained by Masters’ endeavours as he seeks to 
understand and then identify the author of a lifetime’s diaries found in a 
skip. The small but beautifully formedMothering Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/mothering-sunday-a-romance-by-graham-swift-review>
 by Graham Swift (Scribner), demonstrates both the social hierarchy of the time 
and how much life can change in a single day. I was entertained by Ian McEwan’s
Nutshell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/27/nutshell-by-ian-mcewan-review> 
(Jonathan Cape), an eventful tale of a dysfunctional family told from the 
viewpoint of an unborn child.
Katharine Robbins, Leeds

The Visiting Privilege 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/26/the-visiting-privilege-new-and-selected-stories-by-joy-williams-review>
 by Joy Williams (Tuskar Rock)

Williams’s short stories portray the edges of modern life in vivid, staccato 
detail and make for compelling reading. The narrative threads move forward in 
unpredictable, exciting and often unsettling detail. Bernard O’Donoghue’s 
latest collection of poems,The Seasons of Cullen Church 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/30/the-saturday-poem-the-will-by-bernard-o-donoghue>
(Faber), captures the landscape and people of County Cork in a delicate, moving 
way, blending classical and middle English texts with contemporary experience. 
The poems have a warmth of recollection tinged with sadness.
Ross Settles, St Leonards-on-Sea

The Gustav Sonata by Rose Tremain 

This will not disappoint those of us who enjoy and admire Tremain’s novels. 
Although most of the story is set in Switzerland and covers the period around 
the second world war, there is a masterly section describing Gustav’s first 
journey out of the country, visiting Paris as a 50-year-old at the end of the 
last century. This sense of place is almost as important to the novel as its 
central relationship between Gustav and Anton. Such is the gentle power of the 
last scene that I feel these characters will remain with me for a long time.

Mrs Engels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/25/mrs-engels-gavin-mccrea-review-historical>
 by Gavin McCrea (Scribe)

I’m not sure what I feel about bio-fiction (novelists using the best bits of 
people’s lives as inspiration and making up the rest), but I lovedMrs Engels. 
It’s based on the real-life Lizzie Burns, an illiterate mill worker from 
Manchester’s Irish slums who moved to London with her lover Friedrich Engels in 
1870. Historians have put her in the margins, like so many women: here she 
tells her own story. It’s refreshingly original and beautifully written, and a 
sardonic take on the limited place for women in Marx and Engels’ brave new 
world.
Ann Kennedy Smith, Cambridge

Cyclogeography 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/11/cyclogeography-jon-day-review-bike-courier-london>
 by Jon Day (Notting Hill Editions)

This year I’ve been lucky and hit a run of gems. Cyclogeography is an 
enjoyable account of a hair-raising life as a London cycle courier interspersed 
with two-wheeled philosophical digressions. US journalist William Finnegan’s 
story of his surfing travels inBarbarian Days  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/14/barbarian-days-surfing-life-william-finnegan-review>
(Corsair) left me wishing I’d spent my 20s rather differently, but then 
Jonathan Bennett’sAround the Coast in 80 Waves  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/around-the-coast-in-eighty-waves.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
(Sandstone), a tale of the frustrations and highs of surfing every nook of 
Britain’s coastline, provided inspiration to ensure I make up for it in my 50s. 
Best of all, the first two volumes ofThe Arab of the Future by Riad Sattouf 
(Two Roads), an engaging and moving graphic memoir of growing up in 1980s 
Syria, have lingered long in my mind’s eye – brilliant. I hope Santa brings Vol 
3.

The Glorious Heresies  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/01/the-glorious-heresies-lisa-mcinerney-review-sweary-lady>
by Lisa McInerney (John Murray)

I hugely enjoyed Lisa McInerney’s dark but tender debut novel with its vivid 
portrayal of the life and times of Ryan, a teenage gangster in the making. 
Alexandra Shulman’s frank, funny diaries,Inside Vogue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/16/inside-vogue-alexandra-shulman-review-british>

Peacock & Vine: Fortuny and Morris in Life and at Work  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/01/peacock-and-vine-by-as-byatt-review-mariano-fortuny-william-morris>
by AS Byatt (Chatto & Windus)

A beautifully illustrated meditation on two of the 19th century’s greatest 
exponents of textile arts, Mariano Fortuny and William Morris. The politics of 
Morris underpins Sheila Rowbotham’sRebel Crossings: New Women, Free Lovers and 
Radicals in Britain and the United States 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rebel-crossings.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
 (Verso), in which she charts the lives of four women and two men as they 
journey from the 19th to the 20th century, in their search for self-fulfilment 
and equality, struggling to combine personal happiness with radical social 
commitment.
Martin Stott, Oxford

Elegy  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/323581/?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
by Andrew Roberts (Head of Zeus)


The centenary of the battle of the Somme was widely commemorated. Roberts 
focuses simply on the events of the first day, and perfectly captures the 
tragedy and heroism of this terrible moment in our history. Meanwhile, Louis de 
Bernieres’ family saga The Dust That Falls from Dreams (Vintage) manages to 
find charm and deep poignancy as it charts the effects of the war on 
middle-class England.
Simon Surtees, London

Razor Girl 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/razor-girl.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
by Carl Hiaasen (Sphere)

Hiaasen’s novels are always fast-moving, bizarre and bawdy. Razor Girl, full 
of eccentric characters, mistaken identities, coincidences and farce, follows a 
similar format. It is set in Hiaasen’s native Florida where bigots, corrupt 
lawyers, politicians and pharmaceutical companies, the mafia and red-neck 
reality shows are all lampooned.
Dorrie Swift, London

Big History: Our Incredible Journey, from Big Bang to Now (DK)

A mind-expanding and brilliantly illustrated book that attempts to explain the 
entire story of the cosmos from the big bang to the emergence of life and human 
society.Aliens: Science Asks: Is Anyone Out There? (Profile), edited by Jim 
Al-Khalili, is a thought-provoking collection of essays providing a rational, 
scientific discussion of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
Dave Taylor, Purbrook, Hampshire




Mothering Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/mothering-sunday-a-romance-by-graham-swift-review>
 by Graham Swift

Centred on the titular day in 1924, the book describes the last meeting of 
lovers: a maid, Jane Fairchild, and upper-class Paul Sheringham from the 
neighbouring estate. It is emotionally intelligent, expertly achieved and 
beautifully written.
Lynne Taylor, Burnley, Lancashire

At the Existentialist Café  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/17/at-the-existentialist-cafe-by-sarah-bakewell>
by Sarah Bakewell (Chatto & Windus)

This reconnected my younger idealistic self to the more floundering me of 
today; I fell in love with 20th-century philosophy all over again. A book 
that’s too grim to recommend in the usual way is Hanya Yanagihara’sA Little Life
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/05/a-little-life-hanya-yanagihara-review>
(Picador), but it’s unlikely I’ll forget its relentless story or regret reading 
it.

The Prophets of Eternal Fjord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/16/the-prophets-of-eternal-fjord-kim-leine-review-novel>
 by Kim Leine (Atlantic)

I much admired two books about indigenous peoples and colonial histories. 
Danish novelist Leine, translated by Martin Aitken, chronicles a haunting and 
extraordinarily visceral journey into the wilderness of 18th-century Greenland. 
Indigenous London 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/indigenous-london.html?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article>
 by Coll Thrush (Yale) reverses the colonial narrative, looking at the history 
of London through the eyes of travellers from British colonies over 500 years. 
They include Hawaiian royalty, Inuit children, Aboriginal diplomats, a Native 
American missionary and Pocahontas herself. It’s salutary to read just how many 
visitors were repulsed by the dire poverty and moral turpitude they 
encountered. Nothing new there, then.This was also the year when Christopher 
Logue’sIliad adaptation War Music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/29/war-music-christopher-logue-life-work-homer-iliad>
 finally became available in its entirety (Faber). It is magnificent.

The Outrun  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/22/the-outrun-amy-liptrot-review-by-will-self>
by Amy Liptrot (Canongate)

When I finish a book I give it a rating. This year just three received five 
stars. Liptrot’s was the hardest to read, combining the brutal honesty of a 
sober alcoholic with the love for an Orcadian idyll. Jessie Burton’s The Muse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/25/the-muse-jessie-burton-review-novel>
(Picador) shifted between 60s London and Malaga at the time of the Spanish 
civil war, but was really a novel about the creative process and two female 
protagonists who are different aspects of Jesse herself.The Improbability of 
Love 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/20/the-improbability-of-love-hannah-rothschild-review-baileys-prize>
by Hannah Rothschild (Bloomsbury) was a story about a painting rather than an 
artist; a beautiful satire of the contemporary art world. These three books 
made my literary year.
Dave Weller, Pinner, Middlesex

If This Is a Woman: Inside Ravensbrück: Hitler’s Concentration Camp for Women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/01/if-this-woman-ravensbruck-hitler-camp-sarah-helm-review>
 by Sarah Helm (Abacus)

Most accounts of the second world war devote little space to women; Helm helps 
to restore the balance. The female prisoners included members of the Russian 
armed forces, of resistance movements and religious opponents of the Nazis. 
Tens of thousands of them died.
Terry Ward, Wickford, Essex

1971 - Never a Dull Moment: Rock’s Golden Year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/05/1971-never-dull-moment-rocks-golden-year-david-hepworth-review>
 by David Hepworth (Bantam)

One of the perennial questions for rock fans is which is the most important 
year in its history? Music journalist Hepworth makes a compelling case for 
1971. “If all we had of David Bowie was his work from 1971, that would be 
enough,” he argues. This was the year that also gave us the best work by Nick 
Drake, Led Zeppelin, Carly Simon and Don McLean. Hepworth sets the music in 
historical and cultural context in an insightful and funny book.
Cavan Wood, Lindfield, West Sussex
