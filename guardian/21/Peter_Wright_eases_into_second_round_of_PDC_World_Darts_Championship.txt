The Netherlands’ Hendricks, who earlier booked his place in the first round 
with a 2-0 preliminary-round victory over Warren Parry, had a chance to take 
the second set but was left to regret missed doubles, allowing Wright, who lost 
in the 2014 final to Michael van Gerwen, safe passage into round two.

Gerwyn Price became the first seed to exit the competition, as Jonny Clayton 
ousted the No19 3-1 at Alexandra Palace. However, the 27th seed Steve Beaton 
did reach the second round with a 3-1 win over Devon Petersen in Friday’s other 
match.

“I nearly lost the game,” Beaton told Sky Sports. “I thought, ‘I’ve got to do 
something here.’ I had to have a serious head on and get myself out of trouble. 
You play all year for this tournament and I’ve never had a very good year at 
Ally Pally.”
