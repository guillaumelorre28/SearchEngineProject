The number of billionaires living in Britain has risen at its slowest pace 
since the financial crisis after some of the country’s richest people saw their 
fortunes plummet over the past year.

Those who built their wealth on commodities such as oil and steel suffered 
multi-billion pound falls as rock-bottom prices ate into their personal assets.

But there were big rises for property tycoons, including the latest 
table-toppers, the Reuben brothers, while the list was gatecrashed by new 
entrants such asFormula One world champion Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> and Sacha Baron-Cohen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/sachabaroncohen>, the comedian and actor 
behind Ali G and Borat.

Sibling property investors David and Simon Reuben, who made their first 
fortune purchasing Russian aluminium before buying up large tracts of London’s 
landmark buildings, reached the summit of the annualSunday Times 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/sundaytimes> rich list of Britain’s 1,000 
wealthiest people with a combined fortune of £13.1bn, after climbing four 
places in a year.


Sri and Gopi Hinduja 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/01/armstrade.india> – also brothers 
– finished a close second with £13bn, leapfrogging last year’s richest man, the 
Warner Music Group owner,Len Blavatnik 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/len-blavatnik>. The tycoon, born in 
Odessa, Ukraine, fell two places to third as his wealth slumped by £1.6bn to 
£11.6bn.

While the combined worth of Britain’s billionaires grew by nearly 6% to 
£344bn, Blavatnik’s fate was mirrored by a host of ultra-wealthy business 
people.

Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lakshmi-mittal> and family, who in 2008 
boasted a £27.7bn fortune that outstripped any in British history, saw his 
wealth decline by £2bn last year to £7.1bn.

Mittal’s wealth was affected by the ongoing crisis in the steel industry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/20/how-the-uk-steel-crisis-unfolded>
, which has claimed more than 5,000 jobs in Britain alone over the past year.

The Chelsea FC owner, Roman Abramovich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/roman-abramovich>, who made his fortune 
through his Russian oil business Sibneft, witnessed his worth fall by £890m to 
£6.4bn.

The Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley, who has been rocked 
by aGuardian investigation into working conditions in his retail empire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay>
, was among the biggest losers, as his personal pot shrank by £1.1bn to £2.4bn.

Fellow retail tycoon Sir Philip Green suffered a £280m decline to £3.2bn after 
a year in which he sold theBHS high street chain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/20/bhs-landlords-vote-company-voluntary-agreement-pension-fund>
 for £1, only to watch it plummet towards an administration process likely to 
begin on Monday.

The single biggest loss of wealth affected Carrie and François Perrodo and 
family, whose value is built on Franco-British oil firm Perenco. Their combined 
assets tumbled £2.45bn to £3.35bn amid persistently low oil prices.

Hefty losses among some of Britain’s richest people meant that the number of 
billionaires in the UK increased by just three to 120, the slowest rate of 
growth since the financial crisis, when their ranks dwindled from 75 to 43 in 
2009.

And while London remains the world’s preferred playground for billionaires 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/11/britain-worlds-most-billionaires-per-capita>
, boasting more than any other city, there were three fewer than last year at 
77.

The annual list of Britain’s ultra-wealthy also boasted some spectacular 
rises, such as that ofSir James Dyson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/james-dyson>, the inventor famed for 
his bagless vacuum cleaner, among other creations. His household goods and 
technology business reported profits of £448m last year, with salaries and 
dividends boosting the Dyson family’s wealth by £1.5bn to £5bn.

Perhaps the most remarkable rise was staged by the little-known brothers 
Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who were leasing a single dilapidated garage in Bury 
just 15 years ago. The pair have since built an empire worth £700m by buying 
and renovating service stations to create a 341-strong chain of Euro Garages. 
They soared 473 places to 164th as their fortune increased by £550m to £700m.

Britain’s richest woman is Kirsty Bertarelli, the former Miss UK and would-be 
pop star 
<http://ttp://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2013/mar/04/kirsty-bertarelli-richest-woman-pop>
 who, with her husband, the pharmaceutical billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli, has 
a combined worth £9.8bn, making them the richest husband and wife team.

The wealthiest self-made businesswoman in the UK is Denise Coates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/08/denise-coates-woman-bet365-gambling>
, who built the Bet365 business with her family, amassing a combined worth of 
nearly £3.8bn.

The Queen, who celebrated her 90th birthday last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2016/apr/21/the-queens-90th-birthday-celebrations-in-pictures>
, saw her wealth remain flat at £340m but dropped 17 places in the list to 
equal 319th.

The sum puts her on level pegging with the entertainment mogul Simon Cowell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/simoncowell>, the man behind The X Factor 
and Britain’s Got Talent.

New entries included Baron-Cohen, who made his name with his Ali G character 
and this year released Grimsby, his first film in a decade. Together with his 
wife, the former soap opera star Isla Fisher, the 44-year-old is worth £105m, 
putting him 936th in Britain.

Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> was another 
new entry and Britain’s richest sportsman with a fortune of £106m.

£106m fortune. Photograph: Diego Azubel/EPA 
Pop star Adele <https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele> saw her personal 
worth soar by £35m to £85m, while there was no surprise that thewealthiest band 
were One Direction <https://www.theguardian.com/music/one-direction>, worth a 
combined £132m.

Overall, the 1,000 wealthiest people in Britain are worth a combined £576bn, 
an increase of £28.5bn on last year, which equality campaigners said amounted 
to an increase of £901 every second.

The Equality Trust <https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/> pointed out that the 
wealth of the richest 1,000 was the same as that owned by the poorest 40% in 
the UK.

They said the increase in the worth of rich list members could have paid for 
everyone in Britain’s council tax, a year’s rent for 3m households or 1.8m jobs 
on the living wage.

“The level of inequality in the UK is both completely unjustifiable and hugely 
damaging for society,” said John Hood, acting director.

“A wealth of evidence now shows us that living in a more unequal country means 
you’re more likely to suffer from poor mental and physical health, have poorer 
education, trust people less, be the victim of violent crime and even die 
earlier. It’s not good enough for politicians to repeatedly fail to act on 
this.”

Many of the rich list members chose to use their wealth to fund the 
Conservative party, with only eight out of the top 50 political donors spurning 
the Tories.

But the Conservatives were denied the two biggest political donations, with 
the media mogul Richard Desmond handing £1m to Ukip and EuroMillions lottery 
winners Colin and Chris Weirgiving £1m of their £153m winnings to the Scottish 
National party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/15/lottery-winners-scottish-national-party-1m-gift-independence>
