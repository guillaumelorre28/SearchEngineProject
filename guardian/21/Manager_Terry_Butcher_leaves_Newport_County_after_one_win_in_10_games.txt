Newport County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/newport-county> and Terry 
Butcher have “parted company” after one win in 10 games left them bottom of 
League Two.

The former England international defender was appointed in April 2015 to 
succeed Jimmy Dack, but failed to produce consistent form, with Tuesday’s 3-0 
home defeat by Crawley prompting the club to act.

A statement on County’s website 
<http://www.newport-county.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-2721787.aspx> 
said: “In addition to Terry’s departure, Russell Osman [assistant manager] and 
Steve Marsella [chief scout] have also left the club. Newport County AFC would 
like to thank Terry and his staff for their efforts during their time at the 
club, and wish them every success for the future. The club hopes to make an 
announcement on a successor prior to Saturday’s fixture against Exeter City.”

Speaking after the Crawley defeat, Butcher said

: “I can only apologise to the fans, they are used to seeing us play some 
decent football and they’ll have expected a much, much better performance. It 
was like we picked up a bunch of strangers on the M6 and they played like it.

“We were second best all night. I can’t complain about the result, I’m glad it 
was only 3-0.”
