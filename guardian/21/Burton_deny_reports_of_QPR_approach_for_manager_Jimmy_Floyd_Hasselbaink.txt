Burton have dismissed reports of an approach from QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> for Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.

QPR parted company with Chris Ramsey

 at the start of the month and Hasselbaink has been linked with the Loftus Road 
job after winning the League Two title with Burton last season and guiding them 
to fourth in League One this season.

The Burton chairman, Ben Robinson, said: “We have not had an approach from 
QPR. The team and the manager have done fantastically well over the last 12 
months and that inevitably means there will be speculation when vacancies arise.

“We have not had an approach from QPR and Jimmy remains focused on two 
important League One games coming up against Bury and Wigan.”

QPR would be the second Championship club this season to express an interest 
in Hasselbaink after Rotherham requested permission to speak with the 
43-year-old former Leeds and Chelsea striker in October.
