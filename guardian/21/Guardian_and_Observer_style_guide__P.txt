pace
Latin tag meaning “by the leave of”, as a courteous nod to the views of a 
dissenting author, or “even acknowledging the existence of”, not a clever way 
to say “such as”

paean
song of praise; paeon metrical foot of one long and three short syllables; 
peon peasant

palate, palette or pallet?
The palate is the roof of the mouth or sense of taste; an artist mixes paint 
on a palette; a pallet is one of those wooden frames you see on a forklift truck

palazzo
plural palazzos

pale
The expression “beyond the pale”, meaning unacceptable, outside the boundary, 
has nothing to do with buckets; it is derived from the Latinpalus, a stake used 
to support a fence, from which palisade is also derived

Palestine
is best used for the occupied territories (the West Bank and Gaza); if 
referring to the whole area, including Israel, use “historic Palestine” (but 
Palestine for historical references to the area before 1948)

Palestinian Authority
the authority, rather than PA, on second reference

palindrome
A man, a plan, a canal. Panama!

Palme d’Or
at the Cannes film festival

Palme, Olof
(1927-86) Swedish prime minister who was assassinated in a Stockholm street 
(not Olaf)

panacea
a remedy for all ills; so it’s a misuse of the word to say (as we did) that 
“exercise is no panacea for depression”

panama hat

P&O

Pandora’s box

panelled, panelling, panellist
two Ls

panic buy
noun; panic-buy verb

Paralympic Games
 or just Paralympics, or the Games

paraphernalia

set

parent-teacher association
abbreviation PTA

parentheses
If the sentence is logically and grammatically complete without the 
information contained within the parentheses (round brackets), the punctuation 
stays outside the brackets.

(A complete sentence that stands alone in parentheses starts with a capital 
letter and ends with a stop.)

“Square brackets,” the grammarian said, “are used in direct quotes when an 
interpolation [a note from the writer or editor, not uttered by the speaker] is 
added to provide essential information”

Parker Bowles, Camilla
normally referred to as Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall on first mention; 
thereafter the duchess or, informally, Camilla

Parkinson’s disease

language, eg Bundestag, Duma, Folketing, Knesset

PLP after first mention

If you must, it is partakes of, not partakes in, but it sounds pompous and 
quaint


Parthenon marbles
official name, recognised by both Britain and Greece, for the Elgin marbles

party
lc in name of organisation, eg Conservative party, Monster Raving Loony party

passive voice
active verbs are much more effective, especially in headlines: compare “my 
hamster was eaten by Freddie Starr” with “Freddie Starr ate my hamster”

Passport Office
formerly the Identity and Passport Service

password

past or last?
interchangeable in such phrases as “six times in the last week”, “twice in the 
past year”.
But last means “most recent” in this sentence:
“United have beaten Wednesday five times in their last six meetings”
whereas past refers to the past as a whole in this sentence:
“United have beaten Wednesday five times in their past six meetings” 
(suggesting they have only ever played each other six times)

paté
no circumflex accent needed, but keep the acute to avoid confusion with pate


Patent Office
now the Intellectual Property Office, responsible for copyright, designs, 
patents and trademarks

patients
are discharged from hospital, not released

twerp

plural pedalos

pedro giménez
white grape grown in South America

pedro ximénez
white grape grown in Spain (and type of sherry)

peers
Our style is to refer to peers by the name by which they are most widely 
known, which in most cases will be the one they had before their peerage. Use 
this at first mention, a simple title (Lord or Lady) at second mention, and 
thereafter surname only. Some examples:

Andrew Adonis (first mention), Lord Adonis (second mention), Adonis 
(thereafter).
Paddy Ashdown, Lord Ashdown, Ashdown.
Sebastian Coe, Lord Coe, Coe.
Norman Foster, Lord Foster, Foster.
Tony Hall, Lord Hall, Hall.
Greville Janner, Lord Janner, Janner.
Jenny Jones, Lady Jones, Jones.
Martha Lane Fox, Lady Lane-Fox (note hyphen), Lane Fox.
Andrew Lloyd Webber, Lord Lloyd-Webber (note hyphen), Lloyd Webber.
Peter Mandelson, Lord Mandelson, Mandelson.
David Owen, Lord Owen, Owen.
John Prescott, Lord Prescott, Prescott.
John Reid, Lord Reid, Reid.
Richard Rogers, Lord Rogers, Rogers.
Chris Smith, Lord Smith, Smith.
Sayeeda Warsi, Lady Warsi, Warsi.

For people who were not widely known before becoming peers, or who are better 
known by their title, use a simple title at first mention, and thereafter 
surname only. Examples:

Lord Sewel (first mention), Sewel (thereafter).
Lady Stowell, Stowell.

Even if you claim to be on good terms with the peer in question, avoid such 
constructions as “Lady Helena Kennedy” or “Baroness Shirley Williams”: call 
them Helena Kennedy QC at first mention, then Lady Kennedy, then Kennedy; 
Shirley Williams, then Lady Williams, then Williams.

Do not use Baron, Baroness etc unless there is a particular reason to do so – 
for example, for satirical or ironic purposes (“Baron Mandelson of Foy in the 
county of Herefordshire and Hartlepool in the county of Durham”).

Where two or more peers share the same name, make it clear which one you are 
writing about, for example:
Lola Young, the former actor, artist and academic (first mention), Lady Young 
of Hornsey (second mention), thereafter Young.
Barbara Young, a former chief executive of the Environment Agency and Care 
Quality Commission (first mention), Lady Young of Old Scone (second mention), 
thereafter Young.

Peers in historical pieces should be given their titles only if they had 
received them at the time, for example Herbert Asquith’s Liberal government and 
Margaret Thatcher’s Tory government (not Lord Asquith’s, Lady Thatcher’s) – 
they had not yet been given peerages

peewit

peking duck

pendant
 noun; pendent adjective

peninsula
noun; peninsular adjective

penknife

penny, pence
1p is one penny, not “one pence”

pensioners
 not “old age pensioners” or “OAPs”; older people is preferable to “elderly 
people” or (even worse) “the elderly”.

While this term is useful in headlines, it should be avoided in text as a 
description of an individual. As one of our readers notes: “This usage defines 
older people by their non-participation in the workforce and immediately 
typifies them as dependents or drains on the public purse. Rupert Murdoch and 
Michael Caine are never described as ‘pensioners’ because they are perceived as 
still contributing to the economy, so does the term only apply to the little 
people?” Reporters should ask what job people used to do and then describe them 
as a retired banker/powerboat racer or former whatever (including homemaker)

peony
flower

people-smuggling
The hyphen helps to clarify such sentences as: “The problem of people 
smuggling between north Africa and Europe has increased”

Pepsi-Cola
TM; a brand of cola; the company is PepsiCo

per
avoid; use English: “She earns £30,000 a year” is better than “per year”. If 
you must use it, the Latin preposition is followed by another Latin word, eg 
per capita, not per head. Exception: miles per hour, which we write mph

per cent
% in headlines and copy

percentage rises
seem to give us a lot of problems: an increase from 3% to 5% is a 2 percentage 
point increase or a 2-point increase, not a 2% increase; any sentence saying 
“such and such rose or fell by X%” should be considered and checked carefully

peremptory
not open to challenge; perfunctory careless: if you carry out a task in a 
perfunctory way, you may face peremptory dismissal

Pérez de Cuéllar, Javier
Peruvian diplomat and former UN secretary general

perfect storm
a perfect cliche, best avoided

performance-related pay

Performing Right Society
not Rights

permissible

Peronists
supporters of the nationalist/populist ideology of the late Argentinian 
president Juan Domingo Perón

personal equity plans
were known as Peps

persons
are people in our papers, even if they are the luckiest persons in the world

Perspex
TM

perspicacious
shrewd; perspicuous easily understood

peruse
Some maintain that to peruse is to scrutinise or study carefully, rather than 
browse or skim, although Samuel Johnson defined it in the latter sense. So if 
you use it your meaning will be unclear and, even if you are being ironic, you 
will sound pretentious

peshmerga
Kurdish armed fighters (it means “those who face death”)

Peterhouse, Cambridge
not “Peterhouse College”

PETN
pentaerythritol tetranitrate, a powerful explosive favoured by terrorists 
because its colourless crystals are hard to detect in a sealed container

PhD

phenomenon
plural phenomena

Philippines
inhabited by Filipinos (male) and Filipinas (female); adjective Filipino for 
both sexes, but Philippine for, say, a Philippine island or the Philippine 
president

Philips
electronics company; Phillips auctioneers, screwdriver

philistine
lc unless you are talking about the Old Testament Philistines

Phnom Penh

phone hacking
no hyphen for the noun, but hyphenated when used adjectivally, eg the PCC 
responded with its customary vigour to the phone-hacking scandal

phoney
not phony

phosphorus
not phosphorous

photocall, photocopy, photofit, photojournalism, photoshoot

photo-finish

photo opportunity

pi
the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, as every 
schoolgirl knows

picaresque or picturesque?
A picaresque novel is one in which the hero is a rogue who has a series of 
adventures, for example Henry Fielding’sThe Adventures of Tom Jones, a Foundling
 (1749) or John Kennedy Toole’sA Confederacy of Dunces (1980). Nothing to do 
with picturesque, which meansvisually pleasing

picket
noun (one who pickets), not picketer; picketed, picketing

pick-me-up
You might pick yourself up with one

piecework

pigeonhole
verb or noun: I will not be pigeonholed as someone who puts everyone in a 
pigeonhole

Pigs
should not be used as an acronym for Portugal, Ireland (or Italy), Greece and 
Spain in stories about eurozone countries whose economies are deemed more 
embattled than others

pigsty
plural pigsties

pilates
fitness exercises developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century


the pill
contraceptive


pillbox

Pimm’s
the most popular version is Pimm’s No 1 cup, which has gin as its base (the 
others are or were No 2, whisky; No 3, brandy; No 4, rum; No 5, rye; and No 6, 
vodka)

pin
or pin number (we realise pin stands for personal identification number), not 
Pin or PIN number

Pinocchio

pinstripe
suit, not pinstriped

Pipa
Protect Intellectual Property Act

pipebomb, pipeline

Pissarro, Camille
(1830-1903) French impressionist painter; his son Lucien (1863-1944) was also 
an artist

or computer screen, or to display a person or object in pixels to disguise 
their identity

detectives

plane
a higher plane, not a higher plain (unless literally)

planets
take initial cap: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, 
Neptune (note that Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet, along with Ceres 
and Eris); the sun and the Earth’s moon are lc, but named moons are capped up,: 
Europa, Io, etc

planning
not “forward planning”

Planning Inspectorate
handles planning inquiries and appeals in England and Wales

plaster of paris

plateau
plural plateaux

plateglass

platform 2, platform 9¾, etc

platypus
plural platypuses

TM but you can say play-dough

play down
although “downplay” is becoming increasingly popular

an overused phrase

pleasantry
a playful word or joke, not just something pleasant

plebeian
not plebian

pluses
rather than plusses

pocketbook, pocketknife
but pocket money

poet laureate
Carol Ann Duffy took over from Andrew Motion in 2009

‘poet laureate of punk’
a cliche best avoided, not least because we have used it to describe the 
following people: Patti Smith (who has perhaps the best claim to the title), 
John Cooper Clarke, Ian Dury, Elvis Costello, Iggy Pop, Dee Dee Ramone, Katie 
Harkin (Sky Larkin, Sleater-Kinney) and Tim “TV” Smith (the Adverts)

poetry
Ideally, run line by line, as it was written:

I struck the board and cry’d, ‘No more;
I will abroad.’
What, shall I ever sigh and pine?
My lines and life are free; free as the rode,
Loose as the winde, as large as store.

If you don’t have room to run it line by line, separate the lines with spaces 
and a slash:

I struck the board and cry’d, ‘No more; / I will abroad.’ / What, shall I ever 
sigh and pine? / My lines and life are free; free as the rode, / Loose as the 
winde, as large as store.

Italics are acceptable, though not essential

point-to-point

pointe
(ballet); on pointe, not on point or en pointe

Pokémon
singular and plural

Polari
A form of language used mostly by gay men and lesbians, derived in part from 
slang used by sailors, actors and prostitutes and popularised in the 1960s BBC 
radio comedy Round the Horne by the characters Julian and Sandy. Example: “Vada 
the dolly eke on the bona omee ajax” (Look at the gorgeous face on that nice 
man over there); “naff” is an example of Polari that has passed into more 
general use, as are “butch”, “camp” and “dizzy”

Polaroid

pole position
The fastest qualifier in a motor race starts from pole position or on pole, 
alongside one other driver (on occasion, two or more others) on the front row 
of the grid.

Take care if using metaphorically, and do not spell it “poll position”, even 
in election stories, as we have been known to do

Police Federation
Normally no need to use its full title, the Police Federation of England and 
Wales, but note initial caps. The style for individual force federations is 
Metropolitan police federation, Essex police federation, etc.

It’s fine to use “the federation” after first mention but make it clear 
whether you are referring to the national body or a local one

police forces
Metropolitan police (the Met after first mention), West Midlands police, New 
York police department (NYPD at second mention), etc, but note Royal Military 
Police.

Police forces are normally plural: Kent police are investigating, etc, but 
note that while the Metropolitan police are plural, the Met is singular, as is 
Police Scotland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI at second 
mention)

police ranks
Use abbreviation at first mention, then just surname, eg DCI Jane Tennison, 
thereafter Tennison.

Other abbreviations: PC (for both male and female police constables), Sgt, DS 
(Detective Sergeant), Insp, DI, Ch Insp, DCI, Supt, Ch Supt, Det Supt 
(Detective Superintendent), DCS.

Do not abbreviate commissioner, commander, etc

police units
lc: anti-terrorist branch, flying squad, fraud squad, special branch, vice 
squad, etc

policyholder, policymaker, policymaking

“Polish death camps”
and similar phrases confusing location with perpetrator should not be used 
when referring to countries occupied by Nazi Germany during the second world 
war; the appropriate phrase here would be “Nazi death camps in German-occupied 
Poland” or similar

politburo

political correctness
a term to be avoided on the grounds that it is, in Polly Toynbee’s words, “an 
empty rightwing smear designed only to elevate its user”

political language
Use quotation marks around partisan or questionable phrases such as “big 
society” (at first mention), “broken Britain” and “death tax”

political parties
Always lowercase for the word “party”: Labour party, Green party, Communist 
party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist), UK Independence party, etc.


Note that it is Scottish National (not “Nationalist”) party; Plaid Cymru; and 
in the US, Democratic (not “Democrat”) party, although its supporters are 
Democrats.


Abbreviate where appropriate (for example, election results) as follows: Con, 
Lab, Lib Dem, Green, SNP, PC, Ukip.

In Northern Ireland: Social Democratic and Labour party (abbreviation: SDLP), 
Sinn Féin (SF), Alliance party, Democratic Unionist party (DUP), Ulster 
Unionist party (UUP).


Political parties are normally singular, eg Labour is promising to raise 
taxes, the Conservative party is not very compassionate; but the Conservatives 
are the nasty party, the Liberal Democrats lost most of their seats, etc


pollack
not pollock


pomp or prime?
We should say that someone is “in his prime” rather than the football 
commentator’s cliche “in his pomp”


poncey
not poncy

pond
not a terribly witty way to refer to the Atlantic (“on the other side of the 
pond”) which, in the words of one Guardian writer, is “smug, hackneyed, 
old-fashioned, inaccurate and generally crap”

Pontins

poo
what George W Bush’s dog did on the White House lawn, but you might pooh-pooh 
someone’s ideas

pop art

pope, the
and papacy, pontiff; not always necessary to give his name in full

poppadom

poppers
alkyl nitrite, not nitrate

popular
liked; populist wants to be liked: a party’s policies may be populist, but its 
politicians may remain unpopular

pore or pour?
You might pore over the style guide after pouring a cup of coffee


pornography
is preferable, as a term, to “porn”

Portakabin, Portaloo
TM; say portable building, portable toilets, or you are certain to receive a 
letter from the Portakabin lawyers pointing out the error of your ways

Porthmadog
not Portmadoc

Portland stone
comes from the Isle of Portland in Dorset; portland cement doesn’t

Port of London authority
 PLA on second mention

portuguese man o’war
not strictly a jellyfish, although jelly-like; lowercase P unless you are 
writing about the 15th-century Portuguese navy.

As with, say, bass, deer and sheep, the plural is the same word as the 
singular: one portuguese man o’war, two portuguese man o’war, etc, unless you 
really are talking about ships, in which case it’s men o’war

possessive gazetteer
“A BBC newsreader was heard to announce that a detective had flown from 
Singapore’s Raffles hotel to London’s Heathrow to continue inquiries in 
London’s Mayfair.
“The possessive gazetteer – Birmingham’s New Street, Liverpool’s Mersey, 
Brighton’s pier, Cornwall’s St Ives, etc – is now in use everywhere, except in 
the everyday English used by newspaper readers.
“It has no purpose and doesn’t save space (Birmingham’s New Street is in fact 
one en longer than New Street, Birmingham).”
Keith Waterhouse

postal workers
not postmen

postcode

Postcomm
UK postal services regulator; its full name (which you do not need to use) is 
Postal Services Commission

postgraduate

Post-it
TM

postmodern, postmodernist

postmortem
one word, as adjective or noun

postnatal

Post Office
cap up the organisation, but you buy stamps in a post office or sub-post office

postwar
but make it clear if you are referring to the second world war

potentially
rarely necessary: verbs such as could and might already convey potentiality, 
so “could potentially” and “might potentially” are tautologous, as well as 
clumsy

pound
in text, symbol £ only when figures are used (Britain saves the pound; Oliver 
saved £1; pound (weight) abbreviates to lb, eg 2lb

POV
abbreviation for point of view

Pov
term coined by a Guardian journalist to depict laboured attempts to produce 
synonyms by writers seeking what Fowler called “elegant variation” (and Orwell 
“inelegant variation”), often descending into cliche or absurdity. Thus Dalí 
becomes “the moustachioed surrealist” and Ireland “the cockatoo-shaped 
landmass”. Pov, incidentally, stands for “popular orange vegetable”

PoW
abbreviation for prisoner of war

Powergen

powerpop
one word; musical genre defined by nostalgia for the 60s, in the form of 
chiming electric guitars and vocal harmonies. Its proponents often profess to 
being inspired by the Beatles and the Byrds, but are never as good as either

practice
noun; practise verb

practising homosexual
Do not use this expression, or the equally grotesque “active homosexual”; 
where it is necessary to discuss someone’s sex life, for example a story about 
gay clergy, it is possible to use other expressions, eg the Anglican church 
demands celibacy from gay clergy but permits the laity to have sexually active 
relationships

pre-
redundant in such newly fashionable words as pre-booked, pre-reserved, 
pre-ordered, and even pre-rehearsed

precede
go before; proceed go ahead

precipitate
sudden; precipitous steep

precis
singular and plural

predilection
not predeliction

pre-eminent

prefab, prefabricated

premier
should be used only when constitutionally correct (eg leaders of Australian 
states or Canadian provinces), therefore not for Britain – do not use in 
headlines for British prime minister.

The Chinese traditionally give their prime minister the title of premier, eg 
Premier Wen Jiabao. Bermuda also has a premier rather than a prime minister

premiere
no accent

Premier League
(no longer FA Premier League or Premiership) in England; its equivalent in 
Scotland is the Scottish Premiership

premises
of buildings and logic

premium bonds

prenuptial
or (if you must) prenup

prepositions
appeal against, protest against, over or at, not “appealed the sentence”, 
“protested the verdict”, etc.

Schoolchildren used to be told (by English teachers unduly influenced by 
Latin) that it was ungrammatical to end sentences with a preposition, a fallacy 
satirised by Churchill’s “this is the sort of English up with which I will not 
put” and HW Fowler’s “What did you bring me that book to be read to out of for?”

Take care after phrases following “to”: the subheading “to we Conservatives, 
Labour looks as if it’s heading back to the old horrors of the winter of 
discontent” drew numerous protests from readers pointing out that it should 
have been “to us Conservatives … “ (The mistake was ours, not the shadow 
cabinet minister who wrote the piece)

prepubescent

pre-Raphaelite

prescribe, prescriptive
do something; proscribe, proscriptive don’t: prescriptive grammarians love to 
tell you what to do and to proscribe things they disapprove of

presently
What exactly does this mean? I will tell you presently – soon – is the 
traditional British English usage, whereas in American English it means at 
present, and is usually redundant (“we are presently third in the table”). To 
avoid ambiguity, saysoon when you mean soon, and don’t say anything when you 
mean now.


There is a similar problem with momentarily, which means for a moment or 
briefly in British English, and very soon to American (and some British) 
speakers. Best avoided


president
lc except in title: President Obama, but Barack Obama, the US president

president-elect

press, the
singular: eg the British press is a shining example to the rest of the world

Press Complaints Commission
PCC on second mention

Press Gazette
formerly UK Press Gazette

pressure
Use put pressure on or pressed to mean apply pressure, ie not “the Baggies 
pressured [or pressurised] the Wolves defence”

prestigious
For centuries this meant deceptive, as in a conjuring trick 
(prestidigitation). The modern meaning is having prestige or status


Pret a Manger
food

prêt-à-porter
fashion

preteen

pretext
by its nature false, so while it may or may not be true that Tony Blair went 
to war on a pretext, it is tautologous to say he did so on a false one

prevaricate or procrastinate?
The former, which means speaking or acting with intent to deceive, is often 
confused with the latter, which means putting something off. So don’t delay: if 
you do, you are quite likely to be accused by a newspaper of being a liar.


Those contemplating the use of prevaricate should consider whether equivocate 
(using ambiguous language to avoid speaking directly) or vacillate (being 
indecisive) may be closer to the meaning they wish to convey

preventive
rather than preventative

prewar
but make clear which war you are talking about

PricewaterhouseCoopers
PwC after first mention; PwC Consulting, which for some reason was widely 
ridiculed for changing its name to Monday, was bought by IBM

prima donna
plural prima donnas

prima facie
not italicised

primary care trusts
abolished in 2013 as part of the top-down reorganisation of the NHS that the 
Conservative party had promised would not happen; their work was taken over by 
clinical commissioning groups

primate
another word for archbishop; primate of All England: archbishop of Canterbury; 
primate of England: archbishop of York; but “the primate” on second reference

primates
higher members of the order Primates, essentially apes and humans

prime minister
David Cameron, the prime minister; not prime minister David Cameron or “prime 
minister Cameron”

primitive
should not be used to describe tribal people
See Stone age 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-s#stone>

Prince Charles
or the Prince of Wales at first mention; thereafter the prince

Prince’s Trust

principal
first in importance; principle standard of conduct: “a vital principle, 
perhaps my principal rule in life, is to always split the infinitive”

principality
should not be used to describe Wales

prior to, previous to
the word you want is “before”

prise
apart, open (not prize)

prisoners
not inmates

prison officer
not warder, a term that the Prison Officers’ Association regards as 
“degrading, insulting and historically inaccurate” (the Home Office changed it 
from warder in 1922)

Prison Service
but immigration service lc (it is properly called the Immigration and 
Nationality Directorate)

pristine
If you restore something to pristine splendour, you have returned it to its 
original state, not just given it a bit of a clean

private finance initiative
PFI on second mention

private member’s bill
plural: private members’ bills

privy council
but privy counsellor

prizefighter series

prize money

prizes
Man Booker prize, Nobel prize, Whitbread prize, etc

prizewinner, prize winner
One word for prizewinners in general, two words if referring to a specific 
prize:
The six prizewinners included a Nobel peace prize winner, a Man Booker prize 
winner and a Whitbread prize winner

prize-winning
a prize-winning author, the Nobel peace prize-winning campaigner, etc

proactive
jargon word, best avoided

probe
a dental implement, not an inquiry or investigation

pro-choice

Procter & Gamble

procurator fiscal
Scottish public prosecutor; the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service 
(COPFS), in Scotland, more wide-ranging than the Crown Prosecution Service in 
England and Wales, is responsible for the prosecution of crime, investigation 
of sudden or suspicious deaths, and investigation of complaints against the 
police

prodigal
means wasteful or extravagant, not a returned wanderer; the confusion arises 
from the biblical parable of the prodigal son, but he was prodigal because he 
wasted his inheritance, not because he wandered off.


 Thus a prodigal striker is one who misses lots of chances to score goals, not 
one who has played for lots of clubs (who will also invariably be described as 
“much-travelled”)

profession
Strictly, to enter a profession you need a specific qualification, such as 
that acquired by a doctor, lawyer, social worker or teacher. As anyone with a 
mobile, a laptop and a bit of cheek can be a journalist, or at least claim to 
be one, journalism is not a profession but a trade, craft or racket. Much the 
same applies to politics

profile
a noun, not a verb

program
in Australia and the US, and for computer programs everywhere; otherwise 
programme in the UK: “I saw a fascinating TV programme about computer programs”

prohibition
lc for US prohibition (1920-33), a result of the 18th Amendment

pro-life
should not be used to mean anti-abortion

prolific
means abundant or fruitful, so a “prolific striker” scores lots of goals; it 
is a positive attribute, and phrases such as “one of Britain’s most prolific 
paedophiles” (which we used) strikes completely the wrong tone

seafronts

prone

pros and cons

prostitution
When reporting on women and men who work in the sex industry it is Guardian 
policy that they be identified as individuals first, not by the way they earn 
money.

So for example say police are investigating the murder of three women rather 
than “three prostitutes”

protagonist
The person who drives the action, from the ancient Greek meaning “first 
actor”. Not the same as adversary or rival, so strictly you can’t have “two 
protagonists”

protege
male and female, no accents

protest
against, over or about – not, for example, “protest the election result”, 
which has appeared on our front page

Protestant

protester
not protestor

proven
proved is the past tense of prove; beware the creeping “proven”, a term in 
Scottish law (“not proven”) and in certain English idioms, eg “proven record”

provinces of Ireland, comprising nine counties – six in Northern Ireland, and 
three in the Republic of Ireland (Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan)

Pwllheli

pygmy

pyrrhic
A pyrrhic victory is not a hollow one, as often assumed, but one achieved at 
great cost. King Pyrrhus of Epirus defeated the Romans twice, in 280BC and 
279BC, but suffered such heavy losses that he said one more such victory would 
undo him
