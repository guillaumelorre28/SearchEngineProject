The 46-year-old Scot said in a statement on the club’s official website: “I 
would like to place on record my thanks to the owners, and especially the 
players, staff and fans for the tremendous backing and support I have received 
since I arrived.

“It’s a brilliant club, with great people, and I wish it every success in the 
future. For now, I remain fully focused and determined to try to win the final 
two games of the season, starting this Saturday against Rotherham.”

the club in November and wish him well for the future,” said the club in a 
statement. “The club will begin its search for a new manager with immediate 
effect.”
