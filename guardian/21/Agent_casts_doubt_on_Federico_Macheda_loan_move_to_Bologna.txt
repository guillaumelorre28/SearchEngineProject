Federico Macheda's agent says Bologna want to take the young Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> striker back to Italy 
on a loan deal, although he is not confident it will happen.

Macheda burst on to the scene last year when he scored a stoppage-time winner 
against Aston Villa on his debut. The teenager then scored again less than a 
minute into his second match for United as a second-half substitute at 
Sunderland.

However, Macheda has not made a Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> appearance this season and 
Sir Alex Ferguson could consider loaning out the 18-year-old for him to gain 
more first-team experience.

The Serie A strugglers Bologna <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bologna> 
have made a move for Macheda but his agent Giovanni Bia feels the English 
champions will not agree to a move.

"Bologna have asked for him but we have to evaluate things with Manchester 
United," he told Tuttomercatoweb. "This afternoon I have a telephone 
appointment with them, but it will be difficult for them to let him go. If they 
will do it, it would be on loan."

Reports have also linked the Italy Under-21 international with a move to Real 
Zaragoza but Bia insists the Spanish club have not contacted him.

Macheda, a former youth-team player at Lazio, moved to United in 2007 and 
signed a new four-year contract at Old Trafford last December.
