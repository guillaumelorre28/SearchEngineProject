As world exclusive album reviews go, “middle of the road” isn’t one you’re 
likely to see quoted on billboards. But that’s how Damon Albarn described 
Adele’s 25 in September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/10/damon-albarn-new-adele-album-very-middle-of-the-road>
, when he said that their writing sessions were unlikely to emerge, accusing 
the singer of being “very insecure”.

That was the opening shot, but this week we have had a salvo from the other 
side 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/03/adele-i-regret-working-with-damon-albarn>
, with Adele describing their collaboration as “one of those ‘don’t meet your 
idol’ moments”. “The saddest thing was that I was such a big Blur fan growing 
up,” she told Rolling Stone. “But it was sad, and I regret hanging out with 
him.”

This isn’t the first studio-based falling out. Whatever happened to counting 
to 10 and having a nice biscuit? Recording studios always have nice biscuits.

She might be the go-to hit writer of the modern age but Sia’s had so many 
songs rejected in recent years thatshe has compiled an album, This Is Acting, 
of her own versions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/nov/04/sia-shares-new-song-and-release-date-for-upcoming-album-this-is-acting>
. First single Alive was originally written for Adele; the album’s second song, 
Caged Bird, was written for, er, Adele as well, who later said that her working 
relationship with Sia hingedon the pair “just fucking being bossy” 
<http://www.vulture.com/2015/11/heres-sias-other-adele-song-bird-set-free.html> 
with each other — maybe Adele was to blame for the Damon sessions not working 
out? Then again …

After scrapped recording sessions in 2012, Orbit noted that Damon was “kinda a 
shit to the rest of Blur” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/24/blur-album-sessions-william-orbit>
. Still, maybe he’ll work with them again? “Put it this way, I’m not going to 
work with them again.” Oh dear. “Damon was really awful,” Orbit continued. 
“That’s all I’ll say.” (That’s not all he said: he went on to claim that he 
hadn’t even been paid.)

 Not happy – Ke$ha. Photograph: Matt Baron 
Even when artists get on, other egos can intervene. Mr Flaming Lips had 
happily been making an album with Ke$ha, but in 2013 tweeted: “As of now … 
Sadly there will be no Lip$ha ... I can’t say why ... It is sad …” A year later,
 he decided he could say why 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/24/wayne-coyne-kesha-dr-luke-collaborating>
: “I think we did, like, four or five songs, and then Ke$ha would remind me: 
‘Wayne, I can’t put this music out, Dr. Luke will kill me.’” Ke$ha is currently 
suing Dr Luke for alleged sexual and emotional abuse; Dr Luke is countersuing 
for breach of contract and defamation.

The electronic duo Amorphous Androgynous weren’t happy when Noel claimed, of 
the album they recorded together, that he “couldn’t be arsed” releasing it.
Garry from AA talked of how he had to “work around [Noel’s] limitations” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/07/noel-gallagher-oasis-amorphous-androgynous-too-afraid-to-be-weird>
, claimed Oasis’s lyrics were “all surface and no depth”, and added: “His 
rebuttal … is a disgrace. It’s doing me a lot of damage. He became too afraid 
to be weird.”

It’s hard to believe happy-go-lucky songsmith Azealia Banks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/13/azealia-banks-feuding-stone-roses-disclosure-perez-hilton>
 didn’t make this collaboration work, but here we are. And it all started so 
well. “Just had an amazing session with @disclosure !!!!” she tweeted on 24 
June 2013 <https://twitter.com/azealiabanks/status/349230368546762752>. After 
Disclosure played down the session in a radio interview, Banks declared: “They 
were, like, really rude in an interview, so I canned it.” When Banks threatened 
to leak the song as “an F-side, a fuck-you side”, Disclosure shrugged that she 
could do what she wanted. The song has yet to appear.
