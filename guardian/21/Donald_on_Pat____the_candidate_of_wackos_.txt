 A headline-grabbing battle between Donald Trump and Pat Buchanan for the 
Reform party's presidential nomination next year moved slightly out of the 
realm of fantasy yesterday.
Just hours before Mr Buchanan announced that he was quitting the Republican 
party, the much married property and casino millionaire beat him to the punch 
amid the strongest hints so far that he, too, intends to be a contender for the 
Reform nomination.

"It's a very great possibility that I will run," Mr Trump said, as he 
announced that he was resigning from the Republican party and would join the 
Reform party.

The businessman has never fought an election but he wasted no time in 
launching a sound-bite offensive against the radical conservative Mr Buchanan, 
denouncing him as the candidate of "the really staunch wacko vote".

"He doesn't like the blacks, he doesn't like the gays. It's just incredible 
that anybody could embrace this guy," Mr Trump said on NBC television.

He insisted he was "very, very serious" about a possible presidential bid, but 
then added that he would "only do this if I felt I could win the election".

Recent opinion polls give Mr Trump only a slight chance of winning the Reform 
nomination, let alone the presidency.
