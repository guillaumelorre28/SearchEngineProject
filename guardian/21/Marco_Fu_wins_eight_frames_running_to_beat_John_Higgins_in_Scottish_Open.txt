The Hong Kong player had it all to do in Glasgow after Higgins, the home 
favourite, began in blistering fashion with three successive centuries, of 126, 
101 and 100, to build a 4-1 lead.

Fu battled back, though, and took the next three to level proceedings before 
the evening session.

The 38-year-old picked up where he left off, sealing the third ranking title 
of his career which means he jumps from 14th in the world to eighth.

Fu, who collected a first prize of £70,000, told Eurosport: “It is probably 
the best win of my career.”
