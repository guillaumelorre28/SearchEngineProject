75 min: A superb challenge from Rose on the edge of the area denies Kiessling

49 min: It goes down as a sensational save from Lloris, who made a couple of 
incredibly quick scrambles to keep the ball out, and a poor miss from 
Hernandez, who should not have given the keeper any chance.

48 min: GOAL! Surely? A move that started with Toprak slipping as he took a 
free-kick in his own half ended with Hernandez looking to tap home from five 
yards out. The ball goes under Lloris and in. Surely? Technology says no.

46 min: Oof. The referee does very well to spot a trip on Lloris as he came 
out of his area to clear. Hernandez unintentionally nudged him with his knee, 
the keeper went down and the ball broke to Mehmedi, who stroked it into the 
empty net. But the whistle had gone.

combative all-action Baumgartlinger replacing the more creative (and 
out-of-sorts) Calhanoglu.

38 min: How has this not gone in? Toprak produces another brilliant block on 
the edge of the box to deny Alli but the ball breaks to Spurs on the edge of 
the area. The cross comes back in and Janssen, eight yards out plops his header 
on to the bar. The ball drops loose AGAIN and Lamela hooks goalwards only for 
Leno to recover and tip over.

35 min: Mehmedi neatly finds the onrushing Calhanoglu … who watches the ball

Well, that was a pretty entertaining affair all told. Certainly far more 
enjoyable than another 0-0 this week.
 
Peep! PEEP!! PEEEEEEP!!! All over. Spurs pick up what could be a very valuable 
point in this group. Leverkusen will look back in frustration yet again.

90+3 min: Brandt’s effort from the edge of the box is scuffed through to 
Lloris. And that should be just about that.
 
90+2 min: A solid header from Trippier denies Kiessling in front of goal.

90+1 min: Three minutes of added time to play, folks.
 
90 min: Onomah replaces Son, who gets whistled off by the Bayer fans.
 
89 min: Monaco have equalised against CSKA in the other game in this group. 
 
87 min: Leverkusen will be furious if they fail to nick a winner here. They 
feel they should have won both their two previous games in this group. This 
would make it three.
 
86 min: the substitute Brandt breaks brilliantly from a Spurs corner and feeds 
Kiessling … who falls over.
 
85 min: Hernandez off, Brandt on for Leverkusen.
 
84 min: Kiessling misses a sitter. Kampl again does wonderfully on the left 
and clips in a cross-shot, which the big striker shins wide from close range.
 
82 min: Eriksen skips in from the right but can only plant his cross at the 
otherwise underemployed Leno.
 
81 min: … which Leverkusen clear after a bit of a scramble.
 
80 min: Sissoko wins his side a rare corner …
 
79 min: Excellent defending from Vertonghen as Kampl whips in a delicious 
cross. Kiessling was loitering with intent at the back post but the Spurs 
defender did well to get their first.

77 min: Eriksen almost finds Sissoko but Henrichs does enough to block the 
former Newcastle man. Spurs have improved in the past few minutes.
 
75 min: A superb challenge from Rose on the edge of the area denies Kiessling 
as he lines up an effort. But at the other end Jedvaj gets back quickly to deny 
Eriksen.
 
74 min: Leverkusen make their second change – Bender goes off, Jedvaj comes 
on. The captain had been struggling with injury in the buildup to this game, so 
that probably explains a like-for-like switch at right-back at this stage.
 
73 min: And they survive again, but only just. Lloris flaps at a corner and 
the ball drops to Toprak, who chests down but pokes well wide under pressure.

72 min: In the other game, I should mention, CSKA lead Monaco 1-0. So as it 
stands, four teams will be on four points, with Bayer bottom on three. Still 20 
minutes for Spurs to survive though.
 
71 min: Sissoko replaces Lamela as Tottenham look to wrest some semblance of 
control from the hosts.
 
70 min: Aranguiz slips as he looks to clip a free-kick at goal. Into the Spurs 
wall.
 
69 min: … won cleanly by Toprak five yards out but straight at Lloris. That 
was another fine chance. Spurs are on the ropes and have been for 25 minutes.
 
68 min: Kampl, who has caught the eye tonight, cleverly drifts into space and 
feeds the ball into Kiessling, who forces Lloris to turn away at his near post. 
Corner …
 
67 min: An excellent tackle from Tah (I thin) denies Spurs as Eriksen breaks 
at pace.
 
65 min: Janssen is replaces by Mousa Dembele, which presumably will mean Son 
moving into a central attacking position.
 
64 min: Penalty shout for Leverkusen as a scuffed corner bounces on to Rose’s 
upper arm. I think I might have given that. Referee Cakir says no. And he 
probably matters more.
 
63 min: Baumgartlinger has made a real difference, sitting deep and breaking 
things up very effectively.
 
62 min: Another fine save from Lloris, this time to deny Mehmedi from the edge 
of the area.
 
61 min: Spurs get a bit of possession without creating too much but at least 
it relieves the pressure.
 
58 min: This is incredible. After stunning work from Kiessling on the left, 
Rose clears a shot off the line then reacts brilliantly to deflect Hernandez’s 
volley over the bar.

57 min: Another decent stop from Lloris as Aranguiz hammers a low free-kick at 
goal from distance. Leverkusen have been the better side since the break.
 
56 min: We’ve just seen a replay from the goalline camera of that Lloris save. 
Just astonishing, a) to get there in the first place and b) to effectively roll 
along the line with the ball bobbling around and over and under his chest.
 
55 min: … zipped in by Aranguiz and nodded over by the aforementioned 
Kiessling.
 
54 min: Kiessling goes down a little easily – as he has a tendency to do – 
under challenge from Rose. Dangerous free-kick for the hosts on the right 
touchline …
 
53 min: Son looks to be brought down by Bender but the referee, who has been 
flawless so far to be fair, says no.
 
51 min: Hernandez attempts an optimistic shot from the edge of the box, but he 
clumps it into a Spurs defender.
 
49 min: It goes down as a sensational save from Lloris, who made a couple of 
incredibly quick scrambles to keep the ball out, and a poor miss from 
Hernandez, who should not have given the keeper any chance.
 
48 min: GOAL! Surely? A move that started with Toprak slipping as he took a 
free-kick in his own half ended with Hernandez looking to tap home from five 
yards out. The ball goes under Lloris and in. Surely? Technology says no.

46 min: Oof. The referee does very well to spot a trip on Lloris as he came 
out of his area to clear. Hernandez unintentionally nudged him with his knee, 
the keeper went down and the ball broke to Mehmedi, who stroked it into the 
empty net. But the whistle had gone.
 
Peep! Off we go again. Leverkusen have made a change in midfield, with the 
combative all-action Baumgartlinger replacing the more creative (and 
out-of-sorts) Calhanoglu.
 
A half-time email

So this has been especially nice one for those with black and white 
televisions as the teams are in all black and all white,” writes Jeremy 
Dresner. “No neon tonight folks.
“Makes me wonder there are 10,000 people, apparently, who still watch black 
and white TV in the UK Statistically someone reading must know someone.
“Why do they do it? Just obsessed with getting best perceived value from 
auntie?”

 
Peep! And it’s a quiet one. That’s half-time. Spurs will be reasonably 
satisfied after a worrying start. They’ve been much the better side since 
around the 15-minute mark.
 
45 min: Just one minute of added time to play.
 
44 min: Henrichs and Kampl combine nicely on the left, with the ball slipped 
inside to Hernandez. His poked effort from 20 yards is just wide but had Lloris 
worried for a moment.
 
43 min: Janssen does Tah on the left and crosses low. It requires a sharp 
intervention from Henrichs to clear.
 
42 min: Leverkusen fashion a half-chance, Kampl curling well wide from the 
edge of the box.
 
41 min: … one from the training ground as Eriksen picks out Son, who wins a 
corner. Which comes to nothing.

40 min: Another booking – Bender pulls back Rose rather cynically. Spurs 
free-kick …
 
38 min: How has this not gone in? Toprak produces another brilliant block on 
the edge of the box to deny Alli but the ball breaks to Spurs on the edge of 
the area. The cross comes back in and Janssen, eight yards out plops his header 
on to the bar. The ball drops loose AGAIN and Lamela hooks goalwards only for 
Leno to recover and tip over.

37 min: This is scrappier than Scooby Doo’s nephew at the moment. All very 
scruffy but Spurs still on top.
 
35 min: Mehmedi neatly finds the onrushing Calhanoglu … who watches the ball 
ping away off his shins. He’s having a bit of a mare at the moment.
 
34 min: This is a lull (but it won’t hurt you).
 
32 min: Calhanoglu wastes a free-kick, overhitting the ball to the back post. 
On commentary Owen Hargreaves has described the Turkish player as “the best 
free-kick taker in Europe” but he’s fluffed a couple already this evening.
 
30 min: Kiessling is the latest Leverkusen to claim to be the victim of a 
flailing Spurs arm. But he’s quickly up again when he realises his side have 
the ball and are on the attack.
