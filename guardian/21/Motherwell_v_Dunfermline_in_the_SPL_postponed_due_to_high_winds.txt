Strong winds have forced the postponement of Motherwell's SPL game against 
Dunfermline <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dunfermline> on Wednesday 
night.

The winds have caused structural damage to Fir Park which it was feared could 
put spectators at risk. The match has already been rescheduled for Tuesday 24 
January, kicking off at 7.45pm.

The Motherwell <https://www.theguardian.com/football/motherwell> chief 
executive, Leeann Dempster, said: "We were obviously desperate to get the game 
on but there has been significant structural damage to the ground.

"That could have posed a risk to supporters so with that in mind, we have 
agreed with Dunfermline to postpone the fixture and replay it at the earliest 
opportunity."
