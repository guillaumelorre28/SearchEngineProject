In the statement, Moyes said: “I am disappointed to have left Real Sociedad. 
When I accepted the job as manager of La Real last November, my remit was to 
avoid relegation and retain the club’s La Liga status. We succeeded in 
attaining that target.

“I made a firm promise to Real Sociedad to honour my contract and it is 
disappointing not to be able to fulfil this commitment especially when I have 
turned down a number of job opportunities in recent months.”

“I would like to thank the club and the President for giving me the 
opportunity to manage in Spain, at a club with such a rich history of employing 
British managers.

“I would also like to thank the players, staff and my assistant, Billy 
McKinlay, for their support and the wonderful people of San Sebastian.”
