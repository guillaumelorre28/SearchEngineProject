Donald Trump's flagship casino business yesterday filed for bankruptcy as part 
of a financial restructuring aimed at easing $1.8bn (Â£1m) debt.

The property tycoon whose brash attitude has made him a celebrity, was 
typically upbeat.

"I don't think it's a failure," he said. "It's a success. In this case, it was 
just something that worked better than other alternatives. It's really just a 
technical thing."

The restructuring will cut Mr Trump's stake in the business from 56% to 27%. 
Under the proposal, bondholders will exchange their debt for $74m in cash, 
$295m in shares and $1.25bn in new publicly traded debt.

This is the second time Trump casinos have filed for bankruptcy. The business 
first entered Chapter 11 protection from creditors in 1992, then struggling 
with more than $1bn of debt.

The company's chief assets are three properties in Atlantic City in New 
Jersey: the Trump Marina, Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza. Mr Trump will remain 
chairman and chief executive.

"The future looks very good," he said. "We have one of the most powerful 
gaming companies. There's no way we could have done that without the 'B' word."
