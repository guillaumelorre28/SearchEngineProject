We must keep our views in proportion. The terrorist attack in Berlin (Nine 
dead in Berlin truck horror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/19/berlin-truck-crashes-into-christmas-market>
, 20 December) was awful, but why are we more upset about it than when a boat 
full of refugees sinks in the Mediterranean? I wonder how many lives have been 
saved by Germany’s open door to refugees? How many lost because of our closed 
door?

• After attracting several verbal greetings with additional hand signals as I 
chug through east Cheshire, I am very relieved to read in your letters (

<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/dec/20/lozzuck-brings-delight-to-this-dialectologist>
) that the local youth were probably calling me a “lozzucker”.

• Hanging around on the pit top to go underground, you would often get from 
the shift coming out of the pit “Atha laykin lads”. You can still hear it today 
in some parts of South Yorkshire.

• I am an 86-year-old widow. I voted remain. One son voted remain, the 
other for Brexit. We brought them up to think for themselves, hence no conflict 
at Christmas (Letters

, 23 December).

• Every day you bring me wit, intelligence and thoughtfulness, without which 
my life would be very much the poorer. I know I might seem uncaring, never 
having told you before, but I just want you to know that I do love you. Will 
you marry me? Your devoted friend,
Peter Hanson
