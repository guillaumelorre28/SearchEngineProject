Britain's high streets are cutting prices as the slow-down in the economy 
takes its toll of jobs and businesses, according to surveys which were released 
yesterday.

 The British Retail Consortium said prices in shops dropped by 0.3 per cent in 
January to stand at a level only 0.4 per cent higher than a year earlier.

 The organisation's quarterly economic monitor said that prices fell as a 
result of heavy discounting in the January sales, which it said 'reinforce the 
retail industry's key role in keeping inflation down'.

 Although the Government's unemployment figures showed the number out of work 
and claiming benefit fell in December, the monthly survey by the Federation of 
Recruitment and Employment Services, FRES, reported a fourth consecutive fall 
in the number of people placed in permanent jobs.

 Press recruitment advertising is 11 per cent down on a year ago, with skill 
shortages and pay pressures easing. FRES said that pay pressure for both 
temporary and permanent staff had slowed to the weakest seen since the survey 
began, 16 months ago.

 Accountants PriceWaterhouseCoopers said 13,769 firms went bust in 1998, with 
insolvencies hitting a three-year high in the fourth quarter of last year.

 The firm estimates that insolvencies will rise to around 16,000 this year and 
19,000 in 2000, the highest level since 1993. This assumes that a recession is 
avoided and the downturn this year is short-lived, with output growth of 1 per 
cent and 2 per cent next year.
