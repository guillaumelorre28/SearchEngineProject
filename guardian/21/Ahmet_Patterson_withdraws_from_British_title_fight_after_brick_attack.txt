Ahmet Patterson has been forced to withdraw from his British title fight 
against Liam Williams on Saturday because of injuries sustained in a street 
attack.

The 29-year-old Dulwich super-welterweight suffered injuries to his head and 
right eye after being struck by a brick while running past a group of men in 
London on Thursday night.

Patterson said: “I was doing my road work when I noticed a group of men 
gathering on the pavement around 50 yards in front of me. I tried to run around 
them but they moved in front of me and blocked my path.

“As I ran around them one of the men struck me in the face with a brick and we 
got in a scuffle. Once I started defending myself they ran off.”

The injuries sustained left Patterson with no choice but to withdraw from his 
challenge for the Lonsdale Belt at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff. Welshman 
Williams will now face Hungary’s Gabor Gorbics on the same bill.
