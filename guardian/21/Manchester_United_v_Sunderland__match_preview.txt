Given the season it would be heartening to witness David Moyes receive a warm 
reception fromManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> fans on his first 
return to Old Trafford since his sacking two years ago. This is as far as 
goodwill can extend of course as on the field the supporters only wish to see 
Sunderland beaten to make it four consecutive Premier League victories for José 
Mourinho’s side.Jamie Jackson
