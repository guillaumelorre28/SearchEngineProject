named as a substitute forLeague Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> Stevenage on Saturday, 
at the age of 55.

If he had been called into action, Beasant, who is the club’s goalkeeping 
coach, would have become English football’s oldest ever professional, beating 
the record of Neil McBain, the manager of New Brighton, who in 1947 played in 
goal against Hartlepool at the age of 51 due to a spate of injuries.

Beasant was called into the squad following an injury to his son, Sam, who has 
shared goalkeeping duties with Chris Day this season. However, he was not 
brought on during his side’s 3-0 defeat.

Beasant, who made his professional debut 35 years ago, for Wimbledon in 1979, 
last played professionally for Brighton in 2003 – and made an appearance for 
North Greenford United in the Southern Football League last year.
