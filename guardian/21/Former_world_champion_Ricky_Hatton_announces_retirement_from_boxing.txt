Ricky Hatton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rickyhatton>, Britain's former 
two-weight world champion, has announced his retirement from boxing.

The 32-year-old has refused to confirm his retirement since his last fight two 
years ago when he lost to Manny Pacquaio.

Hatton has been linked with several big-name fighters since, most notably the 
only two men to beat him – Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr – but he now 
appears ready to call time on his 14-year professional career.

The Manchester Evening News reported that the Stockport-born fighter will 
announce his retirement on Thursday afternoon signalling the end of a dramatic 
career that has seen him achieve success at welterweight and light-welterweight 
level.

Hatton beat Jon Thaxton to become the British light-welterweight champion in 
2000 and went on to dominate the division, with his most notable victory at 
that weight coming in 2005 against the IBF champion Kostya Tszyu.

Hatton then beat Carlos Maussa before moving up to welterweight where he 
defeated Luis Collazo to claim the WBA world title.

Rapidly earning a reputation as one of Britain's most popular sportsmen, 
Hatton went on to challenge Mayweather in Las Vegas. Billed as the defining 
fight of his career, watched by millions around the world, Hatton failed to 
take the American's WBC welterweight title after being knocked out in the 10th 
round.

Undeterred by his first loss in boxing, Hatton returned to winning ways with 
victories over Juan Lazcano and Paulie Malignaggi before calling out Pacquiao.

The two met at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in May 2009, when Hatton was knocked 
out cold in the second round to leave the Mancunian with a 45-2, 32KOs record.
