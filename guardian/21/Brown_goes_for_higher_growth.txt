Gordon Brown, the chancellor, last night disclosed that his pre-budget report 
in November would focus on reforming labour, capital and product markets in an 
effort to transform Britain into a higher growth economy.

Mr Brown made his comments to delegates at the annual meeting of the IMF, in 
which he laid out his ambitions for the economy.

He said: "I believe the British economy has the potential to reach the upper 
end of our growth ranges" without compromising inflation targets.

Mr Brown said he now expected growth this year to reach 1.4%, which is close 
to the top of the 1.5% forecast in his March budget. He also noted that the 
public finances were in good shape, arguing that public borrowing had been 
reduced by Â£31bn over the past two years.
As evidence of the increased credibility of policymaking, he pointed to the 
shrinking differential between ten-year interest rates in Britain and those in 
Germany. When Labour came to office it was 1.7%, now this difference has been 
narrowed to 0.7 of a percentage point.

The chancellor's speech was his third address in the past 24 hours. On Monday 
he was in Bournemouth speaking to the Labour faithful. Yesterday he was back in 
the swing as chairman of the IMF's steering committee addressing delegates from 
around the world on debt and then the British economy.
