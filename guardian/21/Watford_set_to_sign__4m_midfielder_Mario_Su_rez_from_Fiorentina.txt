Watford are set to sign the Spanish midfielder Mario Suárez from Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> for an undisclosed fee, 
believed to be around £4m.

The 28-year-old, who has three caps for Spain, only signed for the Serie A 
side last summer but has failed to settle in Italy.

Suárez and Quique Sánchez Flores worked together at Atlético Madrid and the 
Watford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> manager believes he can 
get the midfielder’s career back on track. Suárez has started only eight league 
games for Fiorentina this season, but while at Atlético he collected six 
trophies and made his Spain debut in 2013.

The player is set to have a medical in London on Thursday and, if he passes 
that, sign a three-and-a-half year contract at Vicarage Road. Suárez would be 
Watford’s third January signing, following the arrivals ofNordin Amrabat

 andCostel Pantilimon

.

“Mario Suárez is close but it is not finished,” Flores said. “At the moment I 
don’t have official notice from the club that it is done. But he is the kind of 
quality we are looking for.

“He is experienced and he plays very well. In the last year he has been 
unlucky a little bit as he hasn’t been able to keep up the level of the first 
eight years of his career, but now it is very important for him to recuperate. 
We have the tools to recuperate this player and when Mario Suárez recuperates 
his level he will be amazing for Watford.”

Flores, who refused to rule out bringing in a fourth new face during the 
window, also admitted Watford had been interested in Emmanuel Adebayor,who 
opted to join Crystal Palace on Tuesday

.

“We had our turn with the player but he didn’t find enough reasons to come 
here so we can’t do anything. I am not disappointed because we love to have 
players in the squad who want to come here to Watford. This is a project, and 
an amazing place.”

Watford face Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup on Saturday before taking on 
Chelsea in the league on Wednesday.
