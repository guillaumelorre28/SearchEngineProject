Borussia Dortmund’s alarming Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> form continued with a 
1-0 loss at home to previously winless Hamburg. Pierre-Michel Lasogga’s 
35th-minute goal after neat build-up play from Nicolai Müller was enough for 
Hamburg to claim their first win of the season. It was Lasogga’s first goal of 
the season and just Hamburg’s second of the entire campaign.

The hosts posed little threat for much of the game and left it late to push 
for the equaliser. They failed, however, to beatHamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> keeper Jaroslav Drobny in a 
frantic finale, with the 34-year-old also doing well to deny Adrián Ramos from 
point blank-range in the 72nd minute.

Dortmund, who were whistled by the home crowd at the end of the game, have 
fallen ten points behind leaders Bayern Munich. They have now lost four 
Bundesliga matches this season, and are without a win in their last four games.
