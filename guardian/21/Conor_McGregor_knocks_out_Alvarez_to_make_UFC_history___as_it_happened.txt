Les Carpenter

The Garden crowd waited all night to erupt for McGregor, and he did not 
disappoint. Though his fight with Alvarez looked so easy there were no huge 
roars, they did explode when he started demanding theUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> to bring out his second belt.

And when he said: “I want to apologize … to absolutely no one!” the fans 
howled. Much of the crowd had already headed for the exits and he was still 
walking around the octagon holding his two belts aloft. He cackled all the way 
into the tunnel. He sure acts like he runs the show here.

Round two: McGregor v Alvarez

Alvarez walking towards McGregor’s power is an egregious mistake. Just awful. 
And he kept doing it.

Alvarez kicks high and it’s blocked. He’s survived Round 1, and that’s a bit 
of a victory.

10-8 McGregor.

A takedown attempt by Alvarz is shucked off. No sweat for McGregor. Another 
left hand bounces off Alvarez’s jaw. He’s still standing though, and the last 
thing you can do with Alvarez is give him life. A right hand by Alvarez scores.

Another big left and down goes Alvarez. This is what McGregor does. The 
challenger is one top of Eddie. This grappling might be the best thing for 
Alvarez.

Back to the feet. McGregor in complete control.

Alvarez bobbing up and down, changing levels. He’s circling to McGregor’s 
powerhand and eats a left hand that drops him. Exactly how it couldn’t go. But 
Alvarez pops up.

Alvarez again circling towards McGregor’s left.

Alvarez sweeps McGregor off his feet with a low kick to the inside of the 
Irishman’s lead leg. That’s a good way to prevent a left hand from scoring.

McGregor walks to the center of the Octagon, arms outstretched, completely, 
utterly confident. Amazing man to watch fight. Alvarez is pacing, anxious. He’s 
surely ready.

The champion, Eddie Alvarez, enters the arena at Madison Square Garden with 
his title to lose, and everything else to gain. A huge, huge, huge opportunity 
for a man who has done everything the right way throughout his distinguished 
14-year career.

McGregor could very well be his best at 155lbs. Absent the draining weight cut 
down to 145, he looks strong and agile and relaxed. Potent fighter.

intending to do something no one else has: hold championships in two weight 
classes at the same time.

Fans at the Garden do not seem to like Tyron Woodley, profiled here in The 
Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/10/tyron-woodley-ufc-205-activist-voice-ferguson>
 – they booed through his interview and also booed the indecision about whether 
Woodley won the fight or if it was a majority draw They clearly favored 
Thompson before the fight and warmed to the way Thompson fought back after it 
looked like Woodley was about to put him away early in the fight.

Chants of “Wonderboy” rose from the fans and Thompson was cheered at the end 
when he was interviewed.

It’s time for tonight’s main event. The Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> show, co-starring Eddie 
Alvarez.

The expectation is this will be an action fight. McGregor will feel like he 
can pinpoint left hands to Alvarez’s chin. Eddie will feel like he can walk 
McGregor down and hunt him with pressure, while mixing in wrestling.

Some sloppy handling of the scoring here. Buffer gets back on the mic to 
properly call it a majority draw. Woodley still retains. “The Chosen One” damn 
near looked like he was going to have a heart attack.

Woodley still the champion!

Judges: 47-47, 47-47, 48-47 for Woodley. Buffer called it a split decision, 
but that’s a majority draw.

Don’t be shocked if this ends in a draw. Woodley did much more damage but he 
took rounds off and it will depends on if judge saw the first or the fourth as

Woodley taking a sort of desperate straight ahead move that yielded nothing. 
He seems to be spent. Thompson is outscoring Woodley in the fifth. This 
decision will be tight. 10-9 Thompson in R5. 48-46 Woodley.

Two low kicks from Woodley. Thompson unfurls a spinning wheel kick that’s 
blocked. Solid right to the face by Thompson. Under two minutes remaining here. 
Fifth is still a tossup. Woodley is either gassed or he’s waiting for a big 
moment. He just took a hard low kick, then countered with a right hand to the 
jaw.

Woodley working his guard. If he can avoid taking punishment here it could be 
a 10-8 round. That’s the fourth. Thompson helps Woodley stand. Terrific.

39-36 Woodley. Give R4 to Woodley 10-8.

Woodley drops to guard and and squeezes as hard as he can. This is a deep, 
deep guillotine. Woodley giving it everything he has.

If Thompson survives this might prove to be a major mistake by Woodley. Huge 
burst of energy and his arms have to be getting heavy.

Now Woodley is on his back and Thompson’s head is clear with a minute 
remaining in R4.

punch of the fight and Thompson was put down. Another big right hand by Woodley

punches against the challenger’s face.

Round four: Thompson v Woodley

Woodley’s failure to mix in wrestling after R1 makes little sense. Right hand 
lead by Thompson scores.

Another McGregor milestone tonight. He can do no wrong in the Octagon, can he?
 
The Garden crowd waited all night to erupt for McGregor, and he did not 
disappoint. Though his fight with Alvarez looked so easy there were no huge 
roars, they did explode when he started demanding theUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> to bring out his second belt.

And when he said: “I want to apologize … to absolutely no one!” the fans 
howled. Much of the crowd had already headed for the exits and he was still 
walking around the octagon holding his two belts aloft. He cackled all the way 
into the tunnel. He sure acts like he runs the show here.
 
Peak Conor McGregor <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> in that 
postfight victory speech. He will be incredibly difficult for the UFC to 
dictate to, not that he isn’t now. But this is next level.

Official time of the fight is 3:04 of round two. Winner by knockout: Conor 
McGregor <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor>.
 
Four punches by McGregor put Alvarez down for good. Two more lefts and John 
McCarthy called it. That’s not even textbook. Perfection.
 
Solid takedown defense by McGregor here. A big test for him in this fight. 
He’s passing. They disengage and McGregor scores with a knee to the body. 
McGregor kicks to Alvarez’s midsection.

A combination from McGregor plasters Alvarez. He follows with two more shots 
and that’s it. The referee calls it.Conor McGregor is the UFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> lightweight and featherweight champion. 
Totally impressive.

A solid left hand counter by McGregor. Beautiful. Maybe the best weapon in MMA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mma>.
 
Alvarez walking towards McGregor’s power is an egregious mistake. Just awful. 
And he kept doing it.
 
Alvarez kicks high and it’s blocked. He’s survived Round 1, and that’s a bit 
of a victory.

10-8 McGregor.
 
A takedown attempt by Alvarz is shucked off. No sweat for McGregor. Another 
left hand bounces off Alvarez’s jaw. He’s still standing though, and the last 
thing you can do with Alvarez is give him life. A right hand by Alvarez scores.
 
Another big left and down goes Alvarez. This is what McGregor does. The 
challenger is one top of Eddie. This grappling might be the best thing for 
Alvarez.

Back to the feet. McGregor in complete control. 
 
Alvarez bobbing up and down, changing levels. He’s circling to McGregor’s 
powerhand and eats a left hand that drops him. Exactly how it couldn’t go. But 
Alvarez pops up.

Alvarez again circling towards McGregor’s left.
 
Alvarez sweeps McGregor off his feet with a low kick to the inside of the 
Irishman’s lead leg. That’s a good way to prevent a left hand from scoring.
 
We have a touch of the gloves.
 
McGregor walks to the center of the Octagon, arms outstretched, completely, 
utterly confident. Amazing man to watch fight. Alvarez is pacing, anxious. He’s 
surely ready.

The champion, Eddie Alvarez, enters the arena at Madison Square Garden with 
his title to lose, and everything else to gain. A huge, huge, huge opportunity 
for a man who has done everything the right way throughout his distinguished 
14-year career.
 
McGregor could very well be his best at 155lbs. Absent the draining weight cut 
down to 145, he looks strong and agile and relaxed. Potent fighter.
 
UFC featherweight champion Conor McGregor is making the walk to the cage 
intending to do something no one else has: hold championships in two weight 
classes at the same time.

Fans at the Garden do not seem to like Tyron Woodley, profiled here in The 
Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/10/tyron-woodley-ufc-205-activist-voice-ferguson>
 – they booed through his interview and also booed the indecision about whether 
Woodley won the fight or if it was a majority draw They clearly favored 
Thompson before the fight and warmed to the way Thompson fought back after it 
looked like Woodley was about to put him away early in the fight.

Chants of “Wonderboy” rose from the fans and Thompson was cheered at the end 
when he was interviewed.

 
It’s time for tonight’s main event. The Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> show, co-starring Eddie 
Alvarez.

The expectation is this will be an action fight. McGregor will feel like he 
can pinpoint left hands to Alvarez’s chin. Eddie will feel like he can walk 
McGregor down and hunt him with pressure, while mixing in wrestling.
 
Some sloppy handling of the scoring here. Buffer gets back on the mic to 
properly call it a majority draw. Woodley still retains. “The Chosen One” damn 
near looked like he was going to have a heart attack.

welterweight championship.

Judges: 47-47, 47-47, 48-47 for Woodley. Buffer called it a split decision, 
but that’s a majority draw.
 
Some discussion over the scoring happening. Bruce Buffer began to read the 
scores then was called out by the New York State Athletic Commission. Here he 
comes.
 
Thompson and Woodley show respect as we await the judges.
 
Don’t be shocked if this ends in a draw. Woodley did much more damage but he 
took rounds off and it will depends on if judge saw the first or the fourth as 
a 10-8.
 
Woodley taking a sort of desperate straight ahead move that yielded nothing. 
He seems to be spent. Thompson is outscoring Woodley in the fifth. This 
decision will be tight. 10-9 Thompson in R5. 48-46 Woodley.
 
Two low kicks from Woodley. Thompson unfurls a spinning wheel kick that’s 
blocked. Solid right to the face by Thompson. Under two minutes remaining here. 
Fifth is still a tossup. Woodley is either gassed or he’s waiting for a big 
moment. He just took a hard low kick, then countered with a right hand to the 
jaw.
 
Thompson once again walking Woodley back to the fence. One punch could change 
this whole fight.
 
Woodley working his guard. If he can avoid taking punishment here it could be 
a 10-8 round. That’s the fourth. Thompson helps Woodley stand. Terrific.

39-36 Woodley. Give R4 to Woodley 10-8.
 Stephen Thompson: bloodied. Photograph: Al Bello/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images  
Woodley drops to guard and and squeezes as hard as he can. This is a deep, 
deep guillotine. Woodley giving it everything he has.

If Thompson survives this might prove to be a major mistake by Woodley. Huge 
burst of energy and his arms have to be getting heavy.

Now Woodley is on his back and Thompson’s head is clear with a minute 
remaining in R4.
 
Woodley going for the finish here. Knees from Woodley. Thompson dives in and 
exposes his neck. Woodley is looking for a guillotine and defends. Big burst by 
Woodley.
 
Straight left by Thompson and Woodley eats it. But Woodley scores his best 
punch of the fight and Thompson was put down. Another big right hand by Woodley 
drops Thompson along the fence. They’re on the ground now. Woodley is peppering 
punches against the challenger’s face.
 
Woodley’s failure to mix in wrestling after R1 makes little sense. Right hand 
lead by Thompson scores.
 
Woodley slugs Thompson with a right hand before the bell. Very close third 
round. If this goes the distance it may prove to be the difference.29-28 
Woodley.
