Cole has made seven appearances for Coventry, scoring once, and their manager, 
Tony Mowbray, has praised the midfielder’s impact on the League One promotion 
hopefuls. Mowbray said: “Since he joined the club, I’ve really enjoyed working 
with Joe and am delighted to see him sign on for the rest of the season.

“Our staff have worked hard with him to build up his fitness and physicality, 
and we’ve seen Joe really buy into what we’re trying to do here. He’s great to 
have around the dressing room and the rest of the squad feed off his 
experience, and I’m sure it’ll have a positive impact on our younger players as 
well.

“I only see his performances for the club getting better and he is a fantastic 
option to have from now until the end of the season.”

Cole played 16 times for Villa after being released by West Ham in 2014 – his 
second spell at Upton Park – but had only made one appearance for them this 
season.
