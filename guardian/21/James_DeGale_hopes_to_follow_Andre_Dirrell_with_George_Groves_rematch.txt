James DeGale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> has targeted a 
rematch with George Groves if he beats Andre Dirrell in their IBF 
super-middleweight title fight next Saturday.

DeGale, who made his name at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics.boxing>, is attempting 
to become the first man to win gold for Britain and go on to claim a world 
title. Dirrell has lost only one of his 25 bouts –against Carl Froch in 2009  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/18/carl-froch-beats-andre-dirrell>– 
but DeGale is confident of overcoming the American and has already begun 
considering future opponents.

The 29-year-old London fighter lost to Groves on points in 2011  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/22/james-degale-george-groves-boxing>
but hopes a rematch will be possible. “That’s a fight I would like,” said 
DeGale. “I’ve just got to win this world title, then I can start half-calling 
the shots.

“A lot of people talk about Groves and Froch, I do like those fights because 
they sell bigger here, but I want to fight the best. I want to fight Andre 
Ward, Arthur Abraham, Gilberto Ramírez, I want to box the best.

“Once I win this fight I’m going to get a lot more respect. Andre Dirrell is 
known to be a good fighter. Winning over there will make all the difference to 
me.”

Of his rivalry with Groves, DeGale added: “Of course, it means something to 
beat George Groves to winning a world title. I’m too good to get too many 
chances at titles, people aren’t going to fight me for a voluntary defence, so 
I have to take this opportunity against a good opponent.”
