Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has had a 
difficult start to the G20 summit as President Barack Obama said the UK would 
not be the priority for a US trade deal and Japan issued an unprecedented 
15-page warning about the consequences of Brexit.

The prime minister had been hoping to pitch the UK as a global leader in free 
trade during her first major outing on the world stage at theG20 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20> summit in Hangzhou.

However, she was immediately confronted with harsh warnings about the 
consequences of leaving the EU and diplomatic tensions with the Chinese over 
her concerns about their involvement in UK nuclear power.

After her first bilateral meeting with Obama, May was warned that the US 
wanted to focus on trade negotiations with the EU and a bloc of pacific nations 
before considering a deal with the UK.

This was swiftly followed by a message from Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> to the UK that there could be a 
string of corporate exits from the UK unless some of the privileges that come 
with access to the single market are maintained.

The lengthy document from Tokyo gives a list of possible consequences of 
Brexit and a series of specific requests from Japanese businesses. About half 
of Japanese investment in the EU comes to the UK, including from companies such 
as Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nomura and Daiwa.

“Japanese businesses with their European headquarters in the UK may decide to 
transfer their head-office function to continentalEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> if EU laws cease to be 
applicable in the UK after its withdrawal,” the report concludes.

It says: “In light of the fact that a number of Japanese businesses, invited 
by the government in some cases, have invested actively to the UK, which was 
seen to be a gateway to Europe, and have established value-chains across 
Europe, we strongly request that the UK will consider this fact seriously and 
respond in a responsible manner to minimise any harmful effects on these 
businesses.”

Earlier, Obama had promised to work hard to stop “adverse effects” of Brexit 
and assured the UK there was still a “very special relationship” between the 
two nations.

But he also raised the risk of some trading relations unraveling and made 
clear that it “would not make sense to put aside” existing negotiations with 
big blocs of countries in order to do an immediate deal with the UK.

Asked whether he stood by his warnings against Brexit and claim that Britain 
would go to the back of the queue when it comes to trade deals, Obama repeated 
his belief that the world would benefit from the UK being a member of the EU.

“I’ve committed to Theresa that we will consult closely with her as she and 
her government move forward on Brexit negotiations to make sure we don’t see 
adverse effects in our trading and commercial relationship. Obviously there is 
an enormous amount of trade that already takes place ... That is not going to 
stop. And we are going to do everything we can to make sure the consequences of 
the decision don’t end up unravelling what is already a very strong and robust 
economic relationship.

“But first things first. The first task is figuring out what Brexit means with 
respect to Europe. And our first task is making sure we go forward on TTIP 
negotiations in which we have already invested a lot of time and effort.”

It comes after the prime minister warned on her flight to China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> that there would be “difficult times 
ahead” for the economy after leaving the EU.

The prime minister said the economy was in better shape than some had 
predicted following the vote for Brexit. However, May said she was not 
expecting an easy ride, as her ministers examine the possibility of a “fiscal 
reset” at the autumn statement –
potentially abandoning some of the financial strategies and targets of former 
chancellor George Osborne.

Speaking on the flight to Hangzhou, May said: “We have seen figures giving 
some different messages in relation to the economy. The reaction of the economy 
has been better than some had predicted post the referendum.

“But I won’t pretend it is all going to be plain sailing. There will be some 
difficult times ahead. We will be looking ahead to the autumn statement. So in 
terms of how we are going to position things, the detail will be coming out 
then. What I’m clear about is I am going to continue as we have done in 
government over the last six years ensuring we are going to live within our 
means.”

May also has to contend with diplomatic tensions with China over the country’s 
proposed multibillion investment in UK nuclear energy. She angered Beijing by 
placing the French and Chinese-backed Hinkley Point nuclear project under 
review in July, apparently over security concerns about Beijing’s involvement.

Since then, there has been a suggestion that she could be happy for the 
Chinese to be a passive investor in Hinkley Point nuclear power station in 
Somerset but does not want the country to have a more active role in developing 
a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk or Bradwell in Essex.

On the way to Hangzhou, she confirmed that she would go to her first meeting 
as prime minister with the Chinese president,Xi Jinping 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping>, on Monday without having come 
to a decision about allowing Chinese investment in nuclear power to go ahead.

“I am going to be talking to President Xi about a whole range of issues. I am 
not going to be taking the Hinkley decision until ... it’s not going to be 
taken now. It is going to be taken later this month. I am clear that what I am 
doing is looking at the evidence.”

It is possible May is delaying the decision until after the issue can be 
discussed fully at the next national security council meeting of top spy and 
defence chiefs.

Asked whether she trusted the Chinese, the prime minister gave an unclear 
answer. “Of course we have a relationship with them,” she replied. “We are 
working with them. And we have seen significant Chinese investment into the 
United Kingdom. What I want to do is build on that relationship. But I also 
want to be able to build on relationships with other countries. I want to be 
unashamedly open to free trade and a global leader in free trade.”

May was at pains to stress that she wanted to talk to many other world 
leaders, not just the Chinese, in a signal that she does not intend to place 
such a heavy emphasis on the “golden era” of relations proposed by Cameron and 
Osborne.

“What’s happened in the last few years is that the government has built a new 
strategic partnership with China, the golden era of relationships,” she said. 
“We will want to continue to build on that.

“I will be meeting President Xi and talking to him but I will be meeting other 
world leaders as well and wanting to talk to them about the opportunities we 
can develop looking at free trade. We’ve already seen with some of the early 
conversations their interest in talking about trading arrangements, the 
Australians for example.”

May embarked on her first trip to China on the new prime ministerial plane 
used just once by David Cameron before he was replaced. After landing, she 
headed to the summit for meetings with Obama, the Saudi deputy crown prince, 
and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, before the first official session at 
the summit on the economy.

May stressed that Britain was “open for business” and wanted to promote free 
trade but also argued world leaders must be mindful of concerns about 
globalisation leaving some people behind while others flourish.

“I want to be talking about the opportunities for free trade around the world, 
about how Britain can seize those opportunities and I want us to be a global 
leader in free trade. But we can’t ignore as we look at the G20 the fact there 
is a sentiment out there in a number of countries that is anti-globalisation,” 
she said. “That is something else we need to consider, looking at whether when 
we put these free trade agreements in place they are going to work for 
everyone.”

A UK official source said the meeting between May and Obama had been
warm, with both sides agreeing that officials would start talking about some 
of the issues around post-Brexit trade. Asked about the priority given to trade 
deals with other blocs, the source said: “He is a president who has invested a 
lot of
time in multilateral trade deals. I don’t think him talking up those and the 
focus and effort the US have put into those is that much of a surprise.”

On the Japanese warning, the source added it was “not unhelpful” to understand 
where the UK’s trading partners have concerns.
