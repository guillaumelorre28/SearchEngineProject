Calvary <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGM5rq_vX4U> (15) 
(John Michael McDonagh, 2014, Ire) Brendan Gleeson, Chris O'Dowd, Kelly 
Reilly, Dylan Moran, M Emmet Walsh. 101 mins

McDonagh crafts a cracking thriller that's both comical and spiritual, 
distinctively Irish but in no way oblivious to its country's flaws. Gleeson 
bears the film, and the cross, magnificently. His small-town priest is informed 
he'll be murdered in a week's time. He knows who's going to do it, but we 
don't. The potential suspects reflect a society shattered by faith, and lack of 
it.

The Raid 2 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG9uFX3uYq4> (18) 
(Gareth Jones, 2014, Ind/US) Iko Uwais, Arifin Putra, Tio Pakusadewo. 150 mins

Anyone wanting more after the original Indonesian gangster epic is guaranteed 
to get it here: more budget, more action, more story. It's exhilarating, 
exhausting and excessive.

Khumba: A Zebra's Tale <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3QPsQEaonQ> (U) 
(Anthony Silverston, 2013, SA) Jake T Austin, Liam Neeson, Steve Buscemi. 85 
mins

Animated tale about a zebra who's different – but, ironically, it fails to 
stand out from the pack.

The Quiet Ones <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GNyQusclgw> (15) 
(John Pogue, 2014, US) Jared Harris, Sam Claflin, Olivia Cooke. 98 mins

Appropriately retro horror from Hammer, in which Harris's 70s academic seeks 
scientific explanations, and applications, for Cooke's apparent possession.

Pioneer <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovau-abWNlQ> (15) 
(Erik Skjoldbjærg, 2013, Nor/Ger/Swe/Fra/Fin) Aksel Hennie, Wes Bentley, 
Stephen Lang. 111 mins

The 1980s North Sea oil boom is the setting for this paranoid thriller, set 
for a George Clooney remake. A fatal accident leaves Hennie's diver doubting 
his Norwegian and American colleagues, and his sanity.

The Lunchbox <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn6nVJHyfM> (PG) 
(Ritesh Batra, 2013, Ind) Irrfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur, Denzil Smith. 105 mins

A misdelivered lunchbox leads to an intimate, anonymous connection in this 
generous Mumbai story, carried by charming performers and mouthwatering food 
porn.

The Strange Colour Of Your Body's Tears 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYXXpT11WtM> (18) 
(Hélène Cattet, Bruno Forzani, 2013, Fra) Klaus Tange, Ursula Bedena, Joe 
Koener. 99 mins

Another exercise in aestheticised dream-horror from the makers of Amer, though 
the flimsy, fragmented plot leaves it little more than an exercise.

Half Of A Yellow Sun <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xrdaf2pq3Q> (15) 
(Biyi Bandele, 2013, Nig/UK) Chiwetel Ejiofor, Thandie Newton, John Boyega. 
111 mins

Nigeria almost gets its Gone With The Wind, with a handsome melodrama viewing 
the Biafra conflict through the eyes of two sisters. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 
novel is condensed, though.

The Last Days On Mars <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6JiCJ5x3Qw> (15) 
(Ruairi Robinson, 2013, UK/Ire) Liev Schreiber, Olivia Williams, Romola Garai. 
98 mins

Life and death on Mars in a thriller that has the ingredients of a good sci-fi 
movie, mainly because it's borrowed them from other good sci-fi movies.

The King And The Mockingbird <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvlw5X2ru8c> (U) 
(Paul Grimault, 1980, Fra) Jean Martin, Raymond Bussières, Pascal Mazzotti. 84
