Manny Pacquiao will return to the ring April 9 for the first time since losing 
toFloyd Mayweather <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/floyd-mayweather>, and it 
will be against a familiar foe.

Promoter Bob Arum said that Pacquiao will fight Timothy Bradley at the MGM 
Grand in Las Vegas for a third time in his first bout since losing a decision 
to Mayweather in the richest fight ever. Pacquiao reinjured a shoulder in that 
fight and was ineffective against Mayweather in dropping the unanimous decision.

Technically, the fight with Bradley will be the rubber match of their 
three-fight series. However, most in boxing believe Pacquiao won the first 
fight in 2012 easily – the judges gave it to Bradley – and was largely dominant 
in the rematch, which he won by decision.

Top Rank spokesman Lee Samuels said the pay-per-view fight has not officially 
been signed, but that both fighters had agreed to terms and would be signing 
soon. Pacquiao was given a $2m advance on his guaranteed $20m purse, Samuels 
said.

The fight will not be marketed as Pacquiao’s last fight, though he had talked 
previously about just one more fight before running for Senate in his native 
Philippines. Pacquiao is currently a congressman in the Philippines.

Bradley (33-1-1, 13 knockouts) is coming off an impressive win over Brandon 
Rios last month in Las Vegas. Bradley signed up with noted trainer Teddy Atlas 
before that bout, which was seen as one of his best performances.

Pacquiao (57-6-2, 38 knockouts) had surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in 
his right shoulder after the Mayweather fight. It wasn’t disclosed before the 
fight, but Pacquiao hurt the shoulder in training and then reinjured it during 
the fight.
