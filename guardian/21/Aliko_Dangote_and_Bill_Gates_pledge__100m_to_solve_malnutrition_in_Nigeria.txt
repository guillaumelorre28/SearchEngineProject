 Aliko Dangote and the tech billionaire Bill Gates have announced plans for a 
$100m (£70m) scheme to cut malnutrition in Nigeria, the continent’s most 
populous nation.

Dangote said the partnership between his Dangote Foundation and the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation would address the problem, which affects roughly 11 
million children in northernNigeria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria>.

The announcement was made in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, a day after both men 
signed a deal to ramp up immunisation programmes in the northern states of 
Kaduna, Sokoto and Kano, where Dangote is from.

Are Gates and Rockefeller using their influence to set agenda in poor states?

The US philanthropist Gates, who also met President Muhammadu Buhari, said 
Nigeria’s key resource is its young population. About 44% of the country’s 
population of 170 million are aged under 14. The Microsoft founder said their 
prospects would be “greatly damaged if we don’t solve malnutrition”.

The new scheme will fund programmes to 2020 and beyond, using local groups in 
the north-west and north-east. The north-east has for the past seven years been 
ravaged by Boko Haram’s Islamic militant insurgency.

Dangote and Gates have previously worked together on polio eradication 
programmes, which resulted in the country being taken off the global list of 
endemic countries last year.

Nigeria is Africa’s leading economy and number one oil exporter, but poverty 
remains acute for all but a fraction. Average life expectancy is 52 – five 
years fewer than the overall rate for sub-Saharan Africa – and mortality rates 
for infants and children under five are high. About 31% of Nigerian children 
under the age of five were deemed underweight in 2013, the12th worst
