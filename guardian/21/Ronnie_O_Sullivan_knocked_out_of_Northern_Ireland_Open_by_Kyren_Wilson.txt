Ronnie O’Sullivan has been knocked out of the Northern Ireland Open after 
Kyren Wilson secured a thrilling 4-3 victory on Thursday evening.

Englishman Wilson, meeting O’Sullivan for the first time in his career, 
marched into a 3-0 lead only for his countryman to level the last-16 encounter 
courtesy of three brilliant century breaks.

But Wilson held his nerve in the seventh and deciding frame to make a break of 
70 and secure a surprise victory over O’Sullivan, the world number eight, and 
progress to the quarter-finals in Belfast.

“I was sat there at three-all and thinking I haven’t done much wrong here,” 
Wilson told Eurosport. “I was just glad I managed to bring the best out of him 
and that was a bit of a feather in my cap.

“You are the underdog against Ronnie, and you are expected to lose by 
everybody so I was on a win-win really.

“It is nice that I have only played Ronnie once and got the win. There are not 
many players that can say they have done that.”

Wilson, 24, will now face Mark Williams in the last eight after the Welshman 
beat an in-form John Higgins earlier on Thursday.

Higgins, who recorded a maximum 147 break in Belfast on Wednesday, was on the 
wrong end of a 4-1 defeat.
