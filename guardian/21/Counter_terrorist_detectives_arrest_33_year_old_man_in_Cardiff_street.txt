Counter-terrorism detectives investigating fears about planning for a 
terrorist attack have arrested a man in a Cardiff street.

The man, 33, was detained in the third operation in a month to lead to an 
arrest in Britain to disrupt an alleged Islamist plot.

 The arrest was made by detectives from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism 
command.

 Two addresses were being searched in the Welsh capital, at least one of which 
is residential and linked to the arrested man.

 The man was arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and 
instigation of terrorist acts under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

 Under the provision “a constable may arrest without a warrant a person whom 
he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist”.

 The intelligence development underpinning the investigation was led by the 
domestic intelligence service, MI5. Counter-terrorism detectives from London 
and Wales were also involved in an operation described as “pre-planned and as a 
result of a pro-active investigation”.

 Last month, police made arrests in Birmingham amid fears of a potential 
attack plot, leading to four people being charged, and earlier this month 
detectives made arrests in London, leading to one person being charged.

 In a statement about the Cardiff arrest, police said: “The arrest, which took 
place in the street in Cardiff, was pre-planned and as a result of a pro-active 
investigation by the Metropolitan police service counter-terrorism command 
supported by the Wales extremism and counter-terrorism unit.”

 The UK threat level from Islamist terrorism has been at severe since 2014, 
meaning an attack is assessed as being highly likely. The main reason for the 
heightened level of threat is the potency of Islamic State and its desire to 
stage attacks against western targets.
