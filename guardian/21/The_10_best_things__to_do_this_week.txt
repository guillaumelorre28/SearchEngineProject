The annual World Of Music Arts And Dance has long been the favourite of 
middle-class dads but its lineups are increasingly eclectic, not just for range 
of styles but the balance of contemporary and heritage acts. This year you can 
see John Grant and Portuguese guitarist Lula Pena, or the Congotronic Konono No 
1 and Afro-futurists Auntie Flo, all alongside French disco don François K and 
Guide synthpop faves the Invisible.

Now in its eighth year, this Sheffield festival has always been strong on 
fostering new talent but a little more shaky at the top end of the bill – 
Reverend And The Makers have headlined not once, but twice. Yet this year’s 
lineup is an impressive one:Dizzee Rascal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dizzeerascal>, Kelis and, like ’em or not, 
the inescapable Catfish And The Bottlemen lead the line, while further down you 
can find Young Fathers, George Clinton (pictured, right) and Parliament 
Funkadelic and Novelist.

Adapting Dahl can be a tricky task, given how peculiar and lived-in the 
author’s worlds seem. Sensibly, Steven Spielberg has made his BFG as much about 
the relationship between girl and giant as it is about CGI whizz-bangery. Lead 
Mark Rylance finds charm and pathos behind the motion capture.

Cinema Rediscovered 
<http://www.watershed.co.uk/news/cinema-rediscovered-great-films-back-on-big-screens>

True gourmet fare for cinephiles, this new Bristol-based event allows 
film-goers to take in rarities and old favourites. That means a premiere for 
the restoration of historical drama (and influence on TV drama Empire) The Lion 
In Winter, a rare screening of Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, a lost drama from 
African-American director Kathleen Collins, Losing Ground (pictured), as well 
as an Andrei Tarkovsky season.

Doctor Who fans, rejoice: your fave toffish Doc Matt Smith and ex-Who companion
Billie Piper <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/billie-piper> are both 
in the West End this summer for vastly different ways of exercising the thesp 
muscle. Smith is at the Royal Court in Unreachable, an improv comedy about 
misfits making a film, while Piper stars in Yerma, a play about a childless 
woman with the sort of twist that’s expected from young-gun director Simon 
Stone.

Exhibitions

Yayoi Kusama <http://www.victoria-miro.com/artists/31-yayoi-kusama/>

It’s the final full week for the scarlet-bobbed artist’s latest exhibition 
(Victoria Miro, N1, & Victoria Miro Mayfair, W1, to 30 Jul) and what must be 
the most Instagrammed pumpkins ever. It’s free to get in, too, which is why the 
London queues have been eye-popping, but at least you can spend that time 
choosing the perfect filter.

Her association with the Tate goes back to its beginnings – Louise Bourgeois’ 
Maman, a 30ft-high bronze spider, loomed above the Turbine Hall crowds at the 
gallery’s opening. 16 years later, Tate Modern has a new extension and a 
year-long home for some of the French sculptor’s works, as part of its Artist 
Rooms series.

Colour And Vision 
<http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/colour-and-vision-exhibition.html>


Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones awarded the Natural History Museum five 
stars for this “mind-expanding peepshow of nature”. The vivid new exhibition, 
which opened last Friday, is dedicated to showcasing the kaleidoscope of colour 
that makes up the outside world and explaining it; from how pigments are used 
as warning signs to how shades have influenced centuries of art and design. It 
also features more than 350 rarely seen species – from birds and butterflies to 
lizards – and lets you see through the eyes of a snail.

A sprawling and highly evocative work, Jon Savage’s recent book 1966: The Year 
The Decade Exploded felt as if it could do with some sort of visual 
accompaniment. Here, belatedly, is one, as Savage narrates a companion episode 
of Arena. His argument – that political and even existential uncertainty over 
Vietnam and an apocalyptic arms race provided the perfect backdrop for a 
cultural flowering – is augmented with a fever dream-like assortment of archive 
clips. Everything from LSD use and pandemonium over the Beatles to the BBC’s 
horrifying depiction of nuclear destruction in The War Game is touched upon, 
making for both nostalgic and unsettling viewing.

Comedy

The Comedian’s Comedian  <http://www.comedianscomedian.com/>

The standups on Stuart Goldsmith’s podcast tend to bare all – most interviews 
end up resembling gag-heavy therapy sessions. Trawl the archives for their 
musings on life and death (the real and comedy kind).
