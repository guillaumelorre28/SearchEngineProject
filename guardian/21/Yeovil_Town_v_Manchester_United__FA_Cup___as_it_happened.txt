Credit to Yeovil, they were committed and organised in defence and had a 
chance to edge in front but blew it. Before Herrera’s wonder-strike, United 
didn’t look like scoring: Steer was rarely troubled. Once United had the lead 
though, they were able to kill the game with possession, and capitalised as 
Yeovil threw men forward.

Yeovil’s fans rightfully applaud their team. It’s selfie and shirt-swapping 
time.

Full-time: Yeovil 0-2 Manchester United

It could have been so different if Moore had buried that chance at 0-0!

90+2 min: The wind has visibly been knocked out of Yeovil. United could make 
it three, with a swerving shot from Herrera on the edge, but Steer is able to 
palm it away.

Blackett wins the first ball from the Yeovil free kick and Rooney has time to 
get his head up. What follows next is clinical – nearly every Yeovil player is 
forward so Rooney hits a quiet magnificent pass lofted over Yeovil’s one-man 
defence. Di Maria races clear, and dinks it over the oncoming Steer. Game over.

86 min: United have heeded Giggs’s advice, they are keeping the ball. Yeovil’s 
midfield are knackered, and who can blame them.

82 min: It’s been a scrappy few minutes. In many ways, this game is 
reminiscent of the Yeovil v LiverpoolFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> game back in 2004. Yeovil 
impressed in the opening stages, conceded a goal (Emile Heskey) just after the 
hour mark, before another goal by Danny Murphy killed the game as they pressed 
forward for an equaliser.

77 min: United just have to keep the ball now to tire and frustrate Yeovil but 
the away side are giving it away too easily. Blackett sends a hopeful and 
aimless ball forward which allows Nugent to collect and start another Yeovil 
attack.

75 min: United counter-attack and McNair gets forward for the first time down 
the right hand side. It’s a low cross, which catches the Yeovil defence 
off-balance, and Rooney arrives late but his shot is skewed high and wide. 
Rooney looks to the heavens, you would have expected him to at least hit the 
target.

73 min: Herrera is dispossessed in midfield by Foley and he releases Moore, 
who is one-on-one with Smalling. There is no real intent with his dribble, and 
he is forced inside into traffic. If only he had been more direct with his 
running.

71 min: Eaves miscontrols on the left, but manages to win a corner off McNair. 
It is flicked on at the near post, and Edwards dives in for a header at the 
back post. Cleared off the line by Di Maria!

69 min: Twumasi gets his feet in a muddle on the edge of his own box, and Di 
Maria pickpockets him before being brought down. Rooney is over the free kick, 
just to the left of the goal – we have seen him bury so many from here over the 
years, but he curls it over the bar. Poor.

66 min: Yeovil are not going to have to come out and attack, which could be 
very dangerous. Tom Eaves, on loan from Bolton. He was hyped as the next big 
thing in the lower leagues a few years ago when at Oldham but after his move to 
Bolton, it hasn’t quite happened for him. Standing at 6ft5in, Yeovil have a 
very large front pair (with Moore) to now aim for.

Fletcher probes on the edge of the area, his pass is half-intercepted but the 
ball falls to Herrera, who swivels on the turn and hits an dipping volley first 
time into the top right hand corner of the net. Steer had no chance, and 
United’s travelling fans go absolutely nuts. Van Gaal puffs out his cheeks in 
relief on the United bench.

Herrera is booked for his celebrations: he did a little Temur Ketsbaia kick at 
the advertising hoardings there and embraced the crowd.
 Ander Herrera, celebrates with the crowd, the referee issued a yellow card.

58 min: Di Maria on for Falcao. The Colombian has had a poor game. United 
again shift their formation. Yeovil have dropped deeper and deeper into their 
half too, a worrying trend.

56 min: Terrible foul on Herrera by Edwards which is surely a booking, but 
again Pawson plays the advantage. He doesn’t however, come back and book the 
Yeovil captain when the ball goes dead. That’s a pretty shocking decision.

54 min: Huge chance for Yeovil! Ooooo, was that their moment?! Cross from the 
right is angled into the box, Evans manages to head his head on it, but is only 
able to flick it into the path of Moore, with Smalling off balance. Moore 
controls on his chest, and swing with his right on the six-yard box but the 
gets the connection all wrong! Easy save for De Gea. Head in hands time.

51 min: Herrera is also looking a lot more assured in this formation. Rooney 
is clattered by Edwards but Craig Pawson plays a good advantage, with Blackett 
breaking forward, but his cross is just too deep for Wilson.

47 min: Smith sends in a fantastic cross from the left to the back post, and 
Evans is forced to stoop to head out. That had real pace on it, which meant De 
Gea couldn’t come for it.

Teams are back out, Jonny Evans and that man Juan (Mata) are coming on. Evans 
is on for Shaw, which suggests United are changing to a back four, while Mata 
is on for Rafael. Interesting changes, as the wing backs gave United a threat 
going forward in the first half. McNair is at right-back, Blackett at left 
back, with Evans and Smalling in the middle.

No changes for Yeovil as yet.

Gary Johnson: “Delighted so far. We’re shutting them down with a high press.”

The game is crying out for Juan Mata. Would expect to see him on very soon, 
especially as Yeovil tire.

Credit to Yeovil, they were committed and organised in defence and had a 
chance to edge in front but blew it. Before Herrera’s wonder-strike, United 
didn’t look like scoring: Steer was rarely troubled. Once United had the lead 
though, they were able to kill the game with possession, and capitalised as 
Yeovil threw men forward.

Yeovil’s fans rightfully applaud their team. It’s selfie and shirt-swapping 
time.

It could have been so different if Moore had buried that chance at 0-0!
 
90+2 min: The wind has visibly been knocked out of Yeovil. United could make 
it three, with a swerving shot from Herrera on the edge, but Steer is able to 
palm it away.

Blackett wins the first ball from the Yeovil free kick and Rooney has time to 
get his head up. What follows next is clinical – nearly every Yeovil player is 
forward so Rooney hits a quiet magnificent pass lofted over Yeovil’s one-man 
defence. Di Maria races clear, and dinks it over the oncoming Steer. Game over.
 
There is that Danny Murphy goal I was talking about...

88 min: Free-kick for Yeovil. They are throwing everyone forward for this, a 
set-piece looks like their best chance now.
 
87 min: Yeovil bring on two subs: Berrett for Dawson and experienced forward 
James Hayter on for Foley. Kitchen sink time.
 
86 min: United have heeded Giggs’s advice, they are keeping the ball. Yeovil’s 
midfield are knackered, and who can blame them.
 
82 min: It’s been a scrappy few minutes. In many ways, this game is 
reminiscent of the Yeovil v LiverpoolFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> game back in 2004. Yeovil 
impressed in the opening stages, conceded a goal (Emile Heskey) just after the 
hour mark, before another goal by Danny Murphy killed the game as they pressed 
forward for an equaliser.
 
80 min: Co-commentator Michael Owen keeps talking about “pass appreciation.” 
Anyone got any idea what that means?
 
78 min: Giggs comes off the United bench and shouts “keep the ball!” Yep.
 
77 min: United just have to keep the ball now to tire and frustrate Yeovil but 
the away side are giving it away too easily. Blackett sends a hopeful and 
aimless ball forward which allows Nugent to collect and start another Yeovil 
attack.

You have to say his tinkering has worked on this occasion. They’ve looked a 
lot better in this second half.
 
75 min: United counter-attack and McNair gets forward for the first time down 
the right hand side. It’s a low cross, which catches the Yeovil defence 
off-balance, and Rooney arrives late but his shot is skewed high and wide. 
Rooney looks to the heavens, you would have expected him to at least hit the 
target.
 
73 min: Herrera is dispossessed in midfield by Foley and he releases Moore, 
who is one-on-one with Smalling. There is no real intent with his dribble, and 
he is forced inside into traffic. If only he had been more direct with his 
running.
 
71 min: Eaves miscontrols on the left, but manages to win a corner off McNair. 
It is flicked on at the near post, and Edwards dives in for a header at the 
back post. Cleared off the line by Di Maria!

69 min: Twumasi gets his feet in a muddle on the edge of his own box, and Di 
Maria pickpockets him before being brought down. Rooney is over the free kick, 
just to the left of the goal – we have seen him bury so many from here over the 
years, but he curls it over the bar. Poor.
 
66 min: Yeovil are not going to have to come out and attack, which could be 
very dangerous. Tom Eaves, on loan from Bolton. He was hyped as the next big 
thing in the lower leagues a few years ago when at Oldham but after his move to 
Bolton, it hasn’t quite happened for him. Standing at 6ft5in, Yeovil have a 
very large front pair (with Moore) to now aim for.
 
Fletcher probes on the edge of the area, his pass is half-intercepted but the 
ball falls to Herrera, who swivels on the turn and hits an dipping volley first 
time into the top right hand corner of the net. Steer had no chance, and 
United’s travelling fans go absolutely nuts. Van Gaal puffs out his cheeks in 
relief on the United bench.

Herrera is booked for his celebrations: he did a little Temur Ketsbaia kick at 
the advertising hoardings there and embraced the crowd.

60 min: Twumasi has got a dead leg and receives treatment, allowing his 
teammates to get a well-earned breather and drink. The right-back is back on.
 
58 min: Di Maria on for Falcao. The Colombian has had a poor game. United 
again shift their formation. Yeovil have dropped deeper and deeper into their 
half too, a worrying trend.
 
56 min: Terrible foul on Herrera by Edwards which is surely a booking, but 
again Pawson plays the advantage. He doesn’t however, come back and book the 
Yeovil captain when the ball goes dead. That’s a pretty shocking decision.
 
54 min: Huge chance for Yeovil! Ooooo, was that their moment?! Cross from the 
right is angled into the box, Evans manages to head his head on it, but is only 
able to flick it into the path of Moore, with Smalling off balance. Moore 
controls on his chest, and swing with his right on the six-yard box but the 
gets the connection all wrong! Easy save for De Gea. Head in hands time.

51 min: Herrera is also looking a lot more assured in this formation. Rooney 
is clattered by Edwards but Craig Pawson plays a good advantage, with Blackett 
breaking forward, but his cross is just too deep for Wilson.
 
49 min: Mata gets his first touches and releases Falcao, but Arthurwoory again 
has the legs on him, and gets to the ball first.
 
47 min: Smith sends in a fantastic cross from the left to the back post, and 
Evans is forced to stoop to head out. That had real pace on it, which meant De 
Gea couldn’t come for it.
 
46 min: United seem to have set up with a diamond in midfield. Fletcher at the 
base, with Mata and Herrera in front, and with Rooney at the tip.
 
Peeeep, we’re back underway!
 
Teams are back out, Jonny Evans and that man Juan (Mata) are coming on. Evans 
is on for Shaw, which suggests United are changing to a back four, while Mata 
is on for Rafael. Interesting changes, as the wing backs gave United a threat 
going forward in the first half. McNair is at right-back, Blackett at left 
back, with Evans and Smalling in the middle.

No changes for Yeovil as yet.

Gary Johnson: “Delighted so far. We’re shutting them down with a high press.”
 
FA Cup third-round entertainment.

Yes, this may be from last year. Yes, this has nothing to do with Yeovil or 
Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>. But 
what a scramble.
 
Here’s an interesting little snippet to pique your interest.

 that never happened…
 
The game is crying out for Juan Mata. Would expect to see him on very soon, 
especially as Yeovil tire.

PICS: It's been arduous so far for Rooney, Rafael, Falcao, Herrera and co. 
Here's to a better second half.#mufclive
