Chelsea had sent out a defiant message to their title rivals by comfortably 
beating Bournemouth without Diego Costa and N’Golo Kanté.

Two goals from Pedro Rodríguez and a penalty from Eden Hazard gave Chelsea a 
3-0 home victory

 – their 12th league win in a row. It moved them seven points clear at the top, 
although Liverpool will reduce that to six if they win at home against Stoke 
City on Tuesday. Chelsea are two short of Arsenal’s Premier League record of 14 
consecutive victories but Conte insisted his focus was on accumulating points.

“I think a lot of people had been waiting for this game where we played 
without two important players,” Conte said. “They hope it would be a moment 
when we could lose points. It didn’t happen and I am pleased. I hope to 
continue to win until the end of this season.

“The record is only important for the table because with these 12 wins in a 
row our position is fantastic. A record is not important if, at the end, you 
don’t do something important in your championship. But myself and the players 
are proud of the record we have and we want to continue in this way. But it 
won’t be easy.”

Costa and Kanté were suspended after incurring their fifth yellow cards of the 
seasonagainst Crystal Palace

. Conte said he would take the week to assess his options and he opted not to 
start with his £33m summer signing Michy Batshuayi but with a more flexible and 
experienced three of Hazard, Pedro and Willian. They terrorised Bournemouth in 
the second half and Conte said his decision had been vindicated, but he denied 
he would let striker Batshuayi go on loan in January.

“I think Eden and Pedro and Willian played really well,” he said. “After 
Palace I said we had a week to find the right solution to play for the first 
time without Diego and Kanté. After a week of work I decided to choose this 
type of solution and I’m pleased for the performance of these players.

“I think Michy is a really good player but he’s a young player, he’s trying to 
adapt his football to this league and I try to make the best decision for the 
team. I’m sure Michy will have the opportunity to show his talent at this level.

“I wouldn’t let him on loan because he’s a new player for Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> and for him to go on loan is a 
defeat for the club. Now it’s important to be focused and to improve. I want to 
win and every decision I make is only because I want to win.”

As for signings during the transfer window, Conte remained tight-lipped. “For 
this topic I think it’s better to talk with the club,” he said. “We always try 
to take the best decision to improve the situation if there is the possibility. 
But at the same time today we had two players from our academy – Nathaniel 
Chalobah and Ola Aina – to come on. I think this is also important. But for the 
transfer situation it’s important I talk with the club.”

Chelsea’s next game is at home against Stoke on New Year’s Eve. If they win, 
the chance to make it 14 victories will come in the derby against Tottenham 
Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 4 January.
