About eight weeks ago, we created a couple of prototype chatbots and quietly 
promoted them on our social channels. We’ve received very positive feedback 
from users. Our data provides further evidence people found them useful. We 
thought now was the right time to release our Guardian news bot into the wild.

Messaging apps account for a disproportionate amount of time we spend on our 
phones. Whatsapp has over one billion active users per month.Facebook Messenger 
also achieved this milestone in July 
<http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/07/thank-you-messenger/>. There a number of 
other messaging apps with huge followings too - such as WeChat, Kakao, LINE and 
Viber. Usage is nowsurpassing social networks

Chatbots are not a new thing, but have started to be more widely discovered. 
For example, WeChat hasexploded in the last three years 
<https://www.statista.com/statistics/255778/number-of-active-wechat-messenger-accounts/>
. It’s success has fundamentally changed in the way people interact with the 
Internet - from hailing a taxi to shopping for clothes. This has not gone 
unnoticed by their competitors and many have built chatbot capabilities into 
their products.

We have chosen to launch on Facebook Messenger to engage with our established 
community on Facebook and the capabilities of the platform. Depending on the 
success of the Guardian bot on Messenger, we will look to introduce it to 
messaging platforms.

Get your morning briefing when you want it

Once you’ve said hello to our bot <https://www.messenger.com/t/theguardian>, 
it will ask you whether you would like to subscribe and when you would like it 
delivered. The next day, look out for your morning briefing. Our journalists 
will be curating the briefing each day from Monday 7th November in the UK (US 
and Australia will be available soon).

You can change the time, change the edition or unsubscribe at any time. If 
you’re a jet-setter, the bot will do its best to send the briefing at the 
appropriate timezone.

Check-in for the latest headlines or most popular

Ask the bot for “headlines” or “most popular” and it will message you back 
with the top 5 stories. Ask for your favourite topic / section by messaging the 
name of it, like “football” or “lifestyle”.
