2017 is upon us and wintry conditions will be dominating the northern 
hemisphere in the weeks ahead. Meanwhile the southern hemisphere will be 
basking in summer sunshine and the heat that goes with it. So what sort of 
wildlife will we all discover on our doorsteps? We’d love to see your photos of 
the January wildlife near you.

Share your photos and videos with us and we’ll feature our favourites on the 
Guardian site.
