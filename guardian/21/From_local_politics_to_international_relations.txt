It might well be that politics would run a bit better if politicians thrust 
into the Whitehall limelight had previous experience of running something (

, 21 May). New Labour might well have understood better how to actually change 
things if Tony Blair had run a city administration beforehand, for example. EP 
Thompson, in his essayHomage to Tom Maguire 
<http://www.independentlabour.org.uk/main/2016/01/03/new-pamphlet-homage-to-tom-maguire/>
, made the point that the labour movement in the later 19th century was built 
precisely not in London trade union HQs but in those “shadowy parts” known as 
the provinces where leaders had to prove themselves in practice to win support 
and power.

• Martin Rowson’s apposite cartoon

 satirising the campaigns of both sides in the EU debate (23 May) reminds me of 
the slogan used by the yes campaign to win in 1975:“Jobs for the boys” 
<http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/european-referendum-1975.-a-group-of-5-printed-p-285-c-58942bd85b>
, accompanied by a photo of nice young males. I know of no evidence that 
membership of the EU provides much work for young people and have since 
wondered whether this campaign was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the rich 
pickings for politicians at Brussels and Strasbourg?

• Perhaps it’s the million extra women in employment since 2009 who have 
“taken our jobs”, not the migrants after all (Employment rises to new high as 
women wait for retirement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/18/uk-job-numbers-boosted-by-women-delaying-retirement-lydia-ons-employment-rate>
, 19 May). What will happen when both men and women can’t retire till 67, I 
wonder?

• So the chancellor thinks a fall in house prices is bad news (House prices 
face 18% hit if Britain quits EU – Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/eu-referendum-george-osborne-house-prices-brexit>

vote remain!

• Annual NHS deficit = £2.4bn (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/20/nhs-in-england-reveals-245bn-record-deficit>
, 21 May). Annual cost of useless Trident weapons of mass destruction = £2.4bn. 
Solution = somewhat obvious.
