Relations Commission.

Paramedic unions say they raised concerns with NSW Ambulance a year ago about 
new summer, long-sleeved overshirts, which are up to 65% polyester, after 
receiving complaints from paramedics that the shirts were causing rashes and 
overheating.

The Australian Paramedics Association NSW and the Health Services Union

 are supporting members who stop wearing the overshirt, with the APA saying in 
a statement it provided employees with short-term solutions for heatwave 
conditions owing to inaction from NSW Ambulance.

“Paramedics have a choice between wearing a summer shirt, which has been 
likened to a shower curtain, or their heavy winter long-sleeve shirt,” said the 
APA NSW president, Steve Pearce. “We don’t want a dehydrated paramedic 
suffering heatstroke and becoming another emergency case.”

The case will be heard by the commission on Wednesday after an earlier hearing 
on Monday.

NSW Ambulance said the commission had recommended on Monday that paramedics 
continue to wear the prescribed uniform while on duty for safety and for easy 
identification.

The uniform was necessary to ensure staff met work health and safety 
requirements, it said.
