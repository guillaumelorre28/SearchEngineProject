Full time: Hull City 2-2 Everton

Peep peep! That was highly enjoyable Friday-night fare, though the result 
isn’t much use to either side – especially as they can both make a decent 
argument that they should have won. Thanks for your company, goodnight!

90+1 min Tom Davies falls over in the Hull area and is angry when the 
assistant referee gives a goalkick. It looked a dive at first - and he’s been 
booked - but replays suggested Clucas was holding his shirt. Where’s Mike Dean 
when you need him?

90 min What a chance for Calvert-Lewin! Coleman’s superb cross came to him 
eight yards out, and he planted his header just wide of the near post.

GOAL! Hull City 2-2 Everton (Barkley 84)

Ross Barkley equalises! Baines beat Snodgrass on the left and coaxed a fine, 
dipping cross towards the far post. Barkley, unmarked six yards out, planted a 
good downward header to the left of Marshall and into the net.

77 min If there was a Pound for Pound league table, Hull would be challenging 
for the title. There is so much to admire about them, most notably a spirit 
that is exemplified by players like Dawson and Davies.

75 min Barkley goes around the houses, from centre to right, before driving a 
really dangerous low cross into the six-yard box. Lukaku is poised to do the 
necessary when Dawson stretches to make a vital clearance. Moments later, 
Barkley’s fierce shot from 15 yards is beaten away by Marshall. Hull break and 
Tom Davies is booked for a tug on Snodgrass.

GOAL! Hull City 2-1 Everton (Snodgrass 65)

... and this time he scores! It was another booming, dipping strike that Joel 
could only push into the net as he leapt to his right. He should probably have 
saved it but it was still a lovely free-kick from a high-class footballer.

61 min Dawson almost gets his second! Snodgrass’s corner was half cleared to 
Elmohamady, who wafted an excellent ball over the top as theEverton

controlled it superbly beyond the far post before rattling a low shot that was 
pushed away by Joel.

55 min Hull get a free-kick 25 yards from goal, just to the right of centre. 
That makes it perfect for the left foot of Snodgrass - and he curls a beautiful 
shot off the crossbar! Joel was nowhere near it.

53 min Coleman’s long ball is headed on by Lukaku to put Barkley away just 
inside the box. As Davies comes across he tries a first-time sidefoot that is 
too close to Marshall, who claims it at the second attempt.

52 min Barkley plays a sharp pass out to Mirallas, who comes infield from the 
left and hits a low shot that is too close to Marshall and comfortably held.

49 min That really was a brilliant save. Lukaku’s shot from just inside the 
area took a sharp deflection off Dawson and was arrowing towards the top corner 
before Marshall leapt to his left to tip it onto the bar.

Everton’s Ross Barkley denies Hull rare win after Robert Snodgrass magic

Peep peep! That was highly enjoyable Friday-night fare, though the result 
isn’t much use to either side – especially as they can both make a decent 
argument that they should have won. Thanks for your company, goodnight!
 
90+1 min Tom Davies falls over in the Hull area and is angry when the 
assistant referee gives a goalkick. It looked a dive at first - and he’s been 
booked - but replays suggested Clucas was holding his shirt. Where’s Mike Dean 
when you need him?
 
90+1 min There will be four additional minutes.
 
90 min What a chance for Calvert-Lewin! Coleman’s superb cross came to him 
eight yards out, and he planted his header just wide of the near post.
 
88 min Coleman’s attempted hooked clearance smashes into his own confused 
coupon and behind for a corner. It comes to nowt.
 
86 min Now Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> make a 
change: Funes Mori replaces Mirallas. That means a switch to a back three.
 
85 min A Hull substitution: Tom Huddlestone replaces Diomande.
 
Ross Barkley equalises! Baines beat Snodgrass on the left and coaxed a fine, 
dipping cross towards the far post. Barkley, unmarked six yards out, planted a 
good downward header to the left of Marshall and into the net.

84 min Hull are really struggling to get out of their own half now. This’ll be 
a long last few minutes for them.
 
83 min Mirallas is put in the ejector seat by Maguire, 30 yards from goal. 
Maguire is booked.
 
82 min That penalty appeal could have gone either way. It definitely hit 
Snodgrass’s chest, and maybe his left arm as well as that was tight to his 
side. It’s hard to call it definitively even after a few replays.
 
81 min Tom Davies’s cross hits the arm of a Hull defender in the box, 
prompting a huge shout for a penalty from theEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> fans. Jon Moss isn’t interested.
 
80 min Coleman gets into the area on the right after a misjudgement from 
Diomande. His fierce cross is headed behind by Davies, and then Barkley’s 
corner is headed away by Dawson.
 
78 min In the Hull dugout, Mike Phelan is reclining in his chair like he’s 
just had Christmas lunch and is settling in for a James Bond marathon. He’s 
almost horizontal!
 
77 min If there was a Pound for Pound league table, Hull would be challenging 
for the title. There is so much to admire about them, most notably a spirit 
that is exemplified by players like Dawson and Davies.
 
75 min Barkley goes around the houses, from centre to right, before driving a 
really dangerous low cross into the six-yard box. Lukaku is poised to do the 
necessary when Dawson stretches to make a vital clearance. Moments later, 
Barkley’s fierce shot from 15 yards is beaten away by Marshall. Hull break and 
Tom Davies is booked for a tug on Snodgrass.
 
74 min Another Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> change: 
the disappointing Valencia is replaced by Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
 
74 min Barkley tries to wriggle away from Maguire, ends up on his backside and 
complains to the referee. I think Maguire got the ball.

72 min Hull certainly aren’t sitting on their lead at the moment. In fact 
Everton have hardly been out of their own half since the goal. Joel punches 
away Robertson’s dangerous cross, but the ball keeps coming back atEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton>.
 
70 min Snodgrass could play for any team in this league. He is such a lovely 
footballer.
 
68 min Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> will be 
aggrieved at the award of the free-kick for that goal. It was pretty soft.
 
67 min An Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> substitution: 
the Guardian’s own Tom Davies replaces Gareth Barry.
 
... and this time he scores! It was another booming, dipping strike that Joel 
could only push into the net as he leapt to his right. He should probably have 
saved it but it was still a lovely free-kick from a high-class footballer.

curls in. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images  
64 min Maguire goes off on another Beckenbauer tribute run before being fouled 
by Baines, 25 yards out. Well, a foul was given but there wasn’t much in it. 
Snodgrass is poised for another crack...
 
62 min Elmohamady is booked for offending the referee Jon Moss’s sensibilities.
 
61 min Dawson almost gets his second! Snodgrass’s corner was half cleared to 
Elmohamady, who wafted an excellent ball over the top as theEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> defence pushed out. Dawson 
controlled it superbly beyond the far post before rattling a low shot that was 
pushed away by Joel.
 
59 min Jagielka is booked for a rib-ticklingly inept hack at Mbokani. That 
came straight out of 1984.
 
56 min A Hull substitution: Sam Clucas replaces David Meyler.
 
55 min Hull get a free-kick 25 yards from goal, just to the right of centre. 
That makes it perfect for the left foot of Snodgrass - and he curls a beautiful 
shot off the crossbar! Joel was nowhere near it.

the post. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters  
53 min Coleman’s long ball is headed on by Lukaku to put Barkley away just 
inside the box. As Davies comes across he tries a first-time sidefoot that is 
too close to Marshall, who claims it at the second attempt.
 
52 min Barkley plays a sharp pass out to Mirallas, who comes infield from the 
left and hits a low shot that is too close to Marshall and comfortably held.
 
50 min This has been an ominous start to the second half for Hull. Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> have been excellent and Lukaku 
is starting to really threaten.
 
49 min That really was a brilliant save. Lukaku’s shot from just inside the 
area took a sharp deflection off Dawson and was arrowing towards the top corner 
before Marshall leapt to his left to tip it onto the bar.
 
48 min Marshall makes a great save, tipping Lukaku’s deflected shot onto the 
bar!
