“Spikes of interest in a word are usually triggered by a single event,” said 
Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large for Merriam-Webster. “So what’s truly 
remarkable this year about ‘surreal’ is that so many different stories led 
people to look it up.

“Historically, ‘surreal’ has been one of the words most searched after 
tragedy, most notably in the days following 9/11. But it was associated with a 
wide variety of stories this year.”

Merriam-Webster determines the popularity of words in terms of increases in 
look-ups in total volume and year on year.

2016 has been seen as a year of unusually bad news around the world, including 
aterrorist attack in Nice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/bastille-day-truck-attack>, an attempted 
coup inTurkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey-coup-attempt> and the 
deaths of beloved figures such asDavid Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie>, Prince 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince>, Leonard Cohen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/leonard-cohen> and the astronaut John Glenn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/08/john-glenn-obituary>.

Merriam-Webster, however, said the biggest spike in look-ups for “surreal” 
came after Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November.

The surge in look-ups of “fascism” in 2016 was also fuelled by the rise of 
Trump, as well as Britain’s “Brexit” vote to leave the European Union and other 
rightwing populist victories or movements, such as that of Marine Le Pen in 
France.

Last month, Merriam-Webster used its Twitter feed 
<https://twitter.com/MerriamWebster/status/803674255732813825> to suggest users 
look up alternatives to “fascism”, proffering the word “flummadiddle 
<https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flummadiddle>” – meaning, according 
to its own definition, “something foolish or worthless” – as a possible 
alternative.


In 2015, Merriam-Webster’s most looked-up word was “socialism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/16/socialism-most-looked-up-word-2015-merriam-webster-bernie-sanders>
”, thanks to the rise of Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont 
who went on to lose the Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton.


However, with searches for “fascism” also surging as Trump campaigned for the 
Republican nomination, the publisher made “ism” its word of the year, the first 
time the honour had gone to a suffix.

Announcing “surreal” as the 2016 word of the year, Kory Stamper, associate 
editor at Merriam-Webster, said: “Events often have specific words tied to 
them, and it’s always fascinating to see which of those words people latch on 
to.


“You can get a sense as to how people are responding to an event by the words 
that are looked up again and again.”

Other surging words in 2016 included “bigly”, a word associated with Trump 
but, according to Merriam-Webster, less often used by the president-elect than 
the phrase “big league”.

In September, Clinton used the phrase “basket of deplorables 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables>
” to describe some of Trump’s supporters, a gaffe that wasseized upon by Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-elitist-deplorables-comment>
 and used as a badge of honourby some of his followers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/donald-trump-supporters-door-to-door-campaign-pennsylvania>
.


“‘Deplorable’ is defined as an adjective but Clinton’s unfamiliar use of the 
word as a noun may have sent people to the dictionary for clarification,” the 
publisher said.

Other publishers have recognised other political words. Oxford Dictionaries 
made “post-truth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/15/post-truth-named-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-dictionaries>
” its word of the year; Dictionary.com went for “xenophobia 
<http://time.com/4583809/xenophobia-word-of-the-year-2016/>”; Collins gave its 
honour to “Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/03/brexit-named-word-of-the-year-ahead-of-trumpism-and-hygge>
”.

“Alt-right” and “Trumpism” featured strongly in many such surveys.

Away from politics, Merriam-Webster said, Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar-winning 
role fuelled a rise in searches for the word “revenant”, while the death of 
Prince boosted look-ups for “icon”.


The return of the TV series Gilmore Girls, the publisher said, prompted 
searches for the Latin motto “‘in omnia paratus’, which means ‘ready for all 
things’”.
