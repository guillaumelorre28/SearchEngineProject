Virgin Trains gift Villa an open goal

An attempt by the train operator to have a little fun at Aston Villa’s expense 
in October didn’t quite pan out as planned. It began with Virgin tweeting a 
picture of an empty train accompanied by the caption: “With Roberto Di Matteo 
leaving, the next batch of potential#AVFC 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/AVFC?src=hash> managers have just left for 
Birmingham New Street …”

On what was clearly a slow day at the office in the Villa Park comms 
department, the club shot back: “Would our managerial candidates actually get 
here for interviews on time if they arrived via@VirginTrains 
<https://twitter.com/VirginTrains>?”

Still, Virgin’s response was a “boast” as inept as it was underwhelming: 
“We’ve had more trains arrive on time in the last week than you’ve had wins in 
12 months,” it trilled. The number of wins Villa had recorded in the preceding 
year had been a princely four, so it’s debatable whether commuters would be 
enormously impressed that the train operator, which runs hundreds of services 
across the UK each week, seemed happy enough thatat least four of those 
hundreds had been punctual.

Villa missed that particular open goal, instead snapping back with “1 European 
Cup, 7 League Championships, 7 FA Cups, 5 League Cups”, though Virgin are not 
believed to have entered any of those competitions. The social media equivalent 
of bald men fighting over a comb.

The wheels come off for Lescott

It’s been quite the year for Aston Villa and social media embarrassment; who 
can forgetJoleon Lescott’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/16/joleon-lescott-aston-villa-relief-relegation>
 sensitive reminder that though he was embroiled in a humiliatingly doomed 
battle against relegation, and his team had just lost 6-0 to Liverpool, he was 
still getting around in style:

Whether this was more of a gaffe than his subsequent explanation – “I would 
like to add that the tweet sent out from my account involving a picture of a 
car was totally accidental, it happened whilst driving and my phone was in my 
pocket” – is for others to decide.

Benteke blames it on the little guy

If you’re going to begin an exciting new chapter at a club whose plans impress 
you etc etc, best get their name right. Christian Benteke inexplicably got 
Croydon confused with east Lancashire when he signed for Crystal Palace in 
August, changing the club details on his Twitter biography to “Burnley FC”. He 
swiftly apologised, with the explanation that “the person that manages myTwitter
 <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> got a little confused”.

Anichebe and Sunderland show their working

It may shatter our innocence, smash our fragile faith in the game’s beauty and 
honesty, to discover that not all social media comments by footballers are 
spontaneous outbursts of passion and honesty. As Sunderland fans, and others, 
discovered aftertheir defeat by West Ham in October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/west-ham-united-sunderland-premier-league-match-report>
. As the Black Cats slid to another loss, what was actually an internal PR memo 
was tweeted from the account of their striker Victor Anichebe: “Can you tweet 
something like Unbelievable support yesterday and great effort by the lads! 
Hard result to take but we go again!” Going again, being something that someone 
in Sunderland’s PR department may have had to do come the Monday morning.

LA Galaxy take it all too lightly

When you’re getting shellacked 4-0, it’s always best for a club’s social media 
face to remain stern and serious. Alas, LA Galaxy’s people enraged fans by 
declining to take the fact of their 4-0 leathering by Santos Laguna seriously 
enough, with this self-deprecating tweet:
LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ #SANvLA <https://twitter.com/hashtag/SANvLA?src=hash>

<https://twitter.com/LAGalaxy/status/704884908846493701> 
It drew a furious reaction from angry fans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/02/la-galaxy-bruce-arena-concacaf-champions-league>
 and the club’s account later apologised to the LA Riot Squad and the AC 
Brigade, the Galaxy’s two main supporters’ groups.

Cellino’s family fight back against Leeds fans

The massively unpopular Massimo Cellino continued to be a target of Leeds 
fans’ ire over his chaotic chairmanship at Elland Road, inevitably coming under 
fire on social media. Whether he needed his sons to fight his battles for him 
was another matter, as Ercole and Edoardo bit back at critical supporters: 
Ercolestepped down as a club director 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/10/ercole-cellino-steps-down-leeds-united-director-nazi>
 after calling one woman a “whale” and told her to stop eating in an exchange 
on Instagram, and alsodescribed his haircut on Instagram thus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/29/leeds-massimo-cellino-son-nazi-references>
: “Alternative lunch break.... Yes I did... Welcome to Calabria 
#gestapo#ss#army#military#guerilla#warrior.” “It was not my intention to offend 
anyone,” he inevitably added later.

While in a separate exchange on Facebook, of which the Daily Mail has 
photographs, Edoardo called another fan a “moron” during a heated exchange and 
also used another derogatory term. He later apologised: “I believe the messages 
were private but I know I should not have done this. I did not fully understand 
the severity of the words used as English is not my first language. Again, I 
can only apologise.”

Brondby chairman’s messageboard mess

Managers can expect to be criticised on fan forums – everyone can expect to be 
criticised on fan forums – which exist after all to give disenfranchised 
punters the chance to let off steam. Chairpeople, on the other hand, have 
other, more powerful means of expressing their displeasure. You would have 
thought so, anyway. Brondby’s chairman, Jan Bech Andersen, however, slummed it 
with the online herd by logging on to the club’s forum, SydSiden Online, using 
his son’s account and a pseudonym, to let rip on the performance of his coach, 
Thomas Frank. Andersen fessed up and apologised, but Frank, unsurprisingly, 
decidedthat this felt like the right time to call it quits 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/brondby-thomas-frank-chairman-online-forum>
. Andersenfollowed him out the door 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/30/brondby-president-quits-caught-criticising-own-coach-fans-forum>
 shortly afterwards.

Barton rubs Old Firm up the wrong way

Joey Barton apologises ‘unreservedly’ after being sent home by Rangers

The phrase “Joey Barton Twitter storm” is pretty much a tautology, so it was 
no surprise that his decision to sign for Rangers in May had social media in a 
kerfuffle when his 2012 tweet – “I am a Celtic fan” – was dredged up so that it 
might be subject to calm and sober scrutiny from all concerned. To the surprise 
of no one, it didn’t work out so well for Barton at Rangers. A training ground 
set-to following September’s drubbing by Celtic led to a classic Barton 
apology, laced with the qualifier:“I cannot apologise for caring deeply about 
winning.” <https://twitter.com/RangersCulture/status/776531021743398912> His 
suspension, then his departure, followed swiftly.

Charlton’s war on dissent

Grumbling about your team’s performances – alongside making things up and 
shouting about them – is one of the reasons social media was invented. So you’d 
think posting critical comments about football clubs would not constitute a 
Twitter gaffe, but it does if you’re a Charlton fan. Supporters of the 
crisis-hit League One club found themselves being told that the success of 
their season ticket applications was contingent on them not being too unkind 
towards the owners.

Neymar’s impeccable timing

The Brazilian caught the mood by responding to Barcelona’s surprise defeat to 
Alavés in September by assuring fans he would be releasing a single the 
following Wednesday on Facebook: “We will have #Neymusico. Share it,”he tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/neymarjr/status/774973782389886976>.

And praise the Lord …

“#thelordisdead”, “therebootison” were the characteristically humble Instagram 
hashtags <https://www.instagram.com/p/BKDw9EKgPsP/> with which Nicklas Bendtner 
chose to trumpet his arrival at Nottingham Forest in September, stressing he 
was at the City Ground for the love of the sport, not “fast cash”. He has 
scored two goals from 12 appearances thus far.
