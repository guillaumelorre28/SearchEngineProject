James DeGale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> on Sunday 
expressed his delight after becoming the first British boxer to win both an 
Olympic gold and a professional world title.

The 29-year-old beat Andre Dirrell of the US on points in Boston to claim the 
vacant IBF super-middleweight belt. “Please tell me it wasn’t a dream!? I don’t 
have to dream any more … I did it! Can’t thank you enough for your support”, he 
tweeted.

The boxer, who won a middleweight gold medal at the 2008 Games, won a 
unanimous points decision against his 31-year-old opponent. DeGale said on Sky 
Sports after the fight: “I’ve finally done it. It’s an unbelievable feeling, 
I’m world champ. I made history. I will take on any super-middleweight in the 
world. I’m hard to beat when I’m at my best.”

DeGale floored Dirrell in the second round with a left to the chin but the 
31-year-old beat the count and recovered to pose a real challenge in the later 
rounds. A flurry from DeGale in the final round made sure that the victory was 
his, however. The US judge Daniel Fitzgerald and British judge Howard Foster 
scored the fight as 114-112, while Canada’s Alan Davis scored it 117-109.
