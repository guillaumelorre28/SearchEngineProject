Diego Simeone's side struggled to break down bottom-placed Betis until Bryan 
Rodríguez was shown a second yellow card for swiping at the ball with his hand 
in the 55th minute. Gabi opened the scoring three minutes after the 
sending-off, the Atlético midfielder smashing a swerving drive beyond Antonio 
Adán from 10 yards outside the area.

Diego Costa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/diego-costa> made it 2-0 in 
the 64th minute after Koke headed on for the Spain striker to fire home his 
23rd league goal and 31st in all competitions.

While Atlético's season-long surge sees no signs of dipping with nine rounds 
left, last-placed Betis are running out of time to avoid relegation after 
falling nine points from safety.

Sunday's results mean Atlético top the table from Madrid on head-to-head 
records, with Barcelona a point behind them. It is shaping up to be the closest

years.
