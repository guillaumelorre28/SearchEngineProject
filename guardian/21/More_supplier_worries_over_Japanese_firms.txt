Andrew Cook is right (Letters, 13 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/british-components-for-british-trains>
), Japanese policy is worse for us than cheap Chinese manufactured goods. Those 
Hitachi trains are hi-tech products and Japanese companies have a policy that 
no risk will be taken with manufacturing abroad, hence all components must come 
from Japan. My company, EI Tec GmbH, designs, manufactures, installs and 
commissions industrial exhaust gas cleaning systems. When installing in the UK, 
for instance, we use local labour, local steel manufacturing, locally supplied 
components. Only key equipment, software, one supervision and thereafter one 
commission engineer is sent. For us to quote in Japan is “no way”. And, for EI 
Tec to quote pollution control units for new Japanese factories being built in 
Europe, the same story; the Japanese only allow suppliers to quote who have 
sold to them in Japan already. In fact, they install exact copies of Japanese 
factories. This is politics and this is also where government lobbying should 
step in. This concerns all established tech companies in European countries 
like Germany and UK.
