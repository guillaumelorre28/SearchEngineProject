The news that the clincher determining the award of Child Genius 2016 (Too 
young to push? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/06/how-pushy-should-parents-be-child-genius-2016-rhea>
, 6 August) was the ability to spell “eleemosynary” reawakened an ancient sense 
of impotent fury. Aged about 11 I had used this very word in a school essay, 
only to be rewarded with the English teacher’s sarcastic marginal comment: 
“Where did you find this horror?” The answer was in ashort story

 by O Henry, of whom he doubtless hadn’t heard either. Mind you, I have rarely 
come across the term in the nearly seven decades that have passed since then.

• Good to see the Guardian reflecting the diverse views of octogenarians – 
though Clint Eastwood’s abrasive denial of the very idea of racism (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/03/clint-eastwood-donald-trump-racism-esquire-interview>
, 5 August) is a far less compelling argument for the rewards of longevity than 
Paul Nicolson’s quiet humanity in opposing the taxation of benefits (Retired

• It is correct that Ceredigion, Gwynedd and Monmouthshire voted remain and 
are rural areas (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/brexit-and-the-future-of-farming-in-the-uk>

though some of us have learnttipyn bach o Gymraeg (little bit of Welsh). Hwyl!

• Very helpful armchair guide to the Olympics (Sport, 6 August) informing us 
that due to time difference in Rio the action kicks off at 12:30 in England. 
What time does it start in the rest of the UK?
