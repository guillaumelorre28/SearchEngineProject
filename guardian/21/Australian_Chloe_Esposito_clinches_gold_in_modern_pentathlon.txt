Chloe Esposito has won Australia’s first Olympic medal in women’s modern 
pentathlon in a thrilling finale at the Rio Games.

Esposito, 24, won the final event by 16 seconds, overtaking Poland’s Oktawia 
Nowacka with one of the four laps remaining in the combined run-and-shooting 
event.

She had been placed seventh at the start of the last stage of the competition, 
which combines a 3200m cross-country run with pistol shooting, starting 45 
seconds behind the leader.

Esposito’s time of 12:10.19 added up to 1372 points overall: not only ahead of 
Elodie Clouvel of France, who won silver with 1356, and Nowacka, who won bronze 
with 1349, but an Olympic record.

It is Australia’s eighth gold medal of the Rio 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rio-2016> Olympics and propelled the nation 
into eighth place on the overall medal table.

Esposito’s father Daniel, an Olympian in the sport in 1984, served as her 
coach. Her brother Max goes in the men’s modern pentathlon tomorrow.


Modern pentathlon combines fencing, 200m freestyle swimming, show jumping, and 
a final combined event of pistol shooting and a cross-country run.

Born in Camden, New South Wales, Esposito missed out on a spot for the Beijing 
Games, but qualified for the London Olympics in 2012, where she finished 
seventh.

Esposito moved to Hungary in 2014 with her brother and father specifically to 
work on fencing, considered her weakest discipline.

She finished well within the top half of contenders in fencing this year.
