Real Madrid have now scored 12 goals and conceded none. They’ve moved top of 
the table, at least temporarily, with Barcelona due to host Levante on Sunday 
at the Camp Nou.

Full-time: Real Madrid 1-0 Granada

Well, it’s not one for the history books. Hard to say if it will be remembered 
next month let alone years from now. But these three points, earned through a 
mostly plodding 1-0 win over Granada today, count just as much the others.

90 min+1: Real Madrid seem more than content to sit back and string together 
short passes with the three points within touching distance. Can Granada upset 
the proceedings with a moment of inspiration?

79 min: Good chance by Isco but he’s hacked down in the area and Madrid is 
appealing for a penalty. Probably should have been given to be fair but the 
referee will not point to the spot.

76 min: The pace has settled somewhat with Granada failing to match their 
inspired play of the first half. Madrid now look like the champion boxer 
plodding their way to a 15-round unanimous decision, though Granada no doubt 
have the proverbial puncher’s chance.

30 min: Just like that Ronaldo moves quickly with the ball into the left side 
of the area and finds an onrushing Modric with a perfect pass. Modric fires it 
onto the goal and Fernandez deflects the shot away. What a chance!

24 min: Granada showing incredibly well so far, particularly after last year’s

16 min: Ronaldo dribbling toward the goal on the edge of the area when he goes

8 min: A moment of danger for the hosts as a quick Granada counter-attack ends 
when the ball skids perilously across the mouth of the goal. It’s Marcelo who 
swoops in to clear it.

6 min: Marcelo moves up the left flank with the ball and finds Benzema darting 
into the area, a wonderful cross that Benzema just misses. The replay confirms 
he was offside anyway, though it wasn’t called.

Welcome to today’s match between Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> and Granada at the Bernabeu, 
where Cristiano Ronaldo enters on the brink of history. The Portuguese striker, 
who has found the net eight times in the past two matches to climb to 321 
career goals, can eclipse Raul (323 goals) to become Madrid’s all-time leading 
goalscorer with a hat trick.

The hosts will be missing Gareth Bale and Sergio Ramos, who both picked up 
injuries during Tuesday’s Champions League match against Shakhtar Donetsk, not 
to mention James Rodriguez and Danilo, who are both dealing with nagging 
ailments from the international break. But they’ll enter comfortable favorites 
regardless after winning this fixture 9-1 last season.

While we wait for the sides to emerge from the tunnel, here’s a look at 
today’s teams.

Real Madrid: Navas; Carvajal, Varane, Pepe, Marcelo; Kroos, Modric; Lucas 
Vázquez, Benzema, Isco; Ronaldo

Granada: Fernandez; Lopes, Doria, Lomban, Biraghi; Krhin, Marquez; Edgar, 
Success, Rochina; El-Arabi

That’s all for now from the Bernabeu, where today it was Karim Benzema’s goal 
that made the difference for Los Blancos. Check back later for a full match 
report and thanks as always for following along with us.
 Karim Benzema’s goal earned three points for the hosts.  
Real Madrid have now scored 12 goals and conceded none. They’ve moved top of 
the table, at least temporarily, with Barcelona due to host Levante on Sunday 
at the Camp Nou.
 
Well, it’s not one for the history books. Hard to say if it will be remembered 
next month let alone years from now. But these three points, earned through a 
mostly plodding 1-0 win over Granada today, count just as much the others.
 
90 min+1: Real Madrid seem more than content to sit back and string together 
short passes with the three points within touching distance. Can Granada upset 
the proceedings with a moment of inspiration?
 
90 min: Fourth official signals for four minutes of stoppage time.
 
88 min: It’s taken by Marquez and disappointingly caroms off the first 
defender in the wall.
 
87 min: Now this is interesting. El-Arabi is hacked down by Pepe and wins a 
free kick in a dangerous spot on the edge of the area. A free kick to come.
 
83 min: Madrid’s final sub is a clear defensive move with Casemiro entering 
for Isco.
 
80 min: Krhin shown yellow for an overzealous challenge.
 
79 min: Good chance by Isco but he’s hacked down in the area and Madrid is 
appealing for a penalty. Probably should have been given to be fair but the 
referee will not point to the spot.
 
78 min: A pair of substitutions now. For Granada’s third and final switch, 
Nico Lopez enters for Edgar. Madrid subs for a second time when the goal-scorer 
Benzema exits for Denis Cheryshev.
 
76 min: The pace has settled somewhat with Granada failing to match their 
inspired play of the first half. Madrid now look like the champion boxer 
plodding their way to a 15-round unanimous decision, though Granada no doubt 
have the proverbial puncher’s chance.
 
72 min: Moments after a Ronaldo free kick from 30 yards slams into the wall of 
defenders, Granada win their first corner of the match. Alas, it comes to 
nothing.
 
70 min: Granada’s Javi Márquez shown yellow.
 
68 min: Granada’s attack has slowed to a standstill since the goal. Even more 
so since Success exited, with Ibanez having failed to make an impact.
 
65 min: Another sub for Granada as Fran Rico enters for the captain Rochina. 
Moments later Madrid wins another corner, but it’s cleared harmlessly.
 
62 min: Real Madrid makes their first sub of the match as Mateo Kovačić comes 
on for Toni Kroos.
 
61 min: Navas turns away another effort by El-Arabi, who is making his 100th 
appearance for Granada today.
 
59 min: As we approach the hour mark, the first substitution of the game will 
be made by Granada: Robert Ibanez entering for Isaac Success.
 
57 min: Marcelo wins a free kick when his pacy run up the left flank is 
interrupted by a clattering Miguel Lopes challenge.
 
Karim Benzema opens the scoring with a clinical header at the far post off a 
perfectly played cross from Isco.
 Benzema opens the scoring for Real Madrid.  
51 min: Another chance wasted by Granada. Success runs onto a wonderfully 
played back heel by a team-mate but rather than try to kick it around the 
keeper, the Nigerian’s flick sails over the crossbar.
 
48 min: Benzema plays the ball to the left of the area, then passes to Isco, 
whose set-up pass for Ronaldo is off target. Madrid continue to probe but with 
nothing to show for it.
 
46 min: We’re off and running in the second half. No changes for either side 
during half-time.
 
There’s the half-time whistle and the clubs will break at nil-nil, the slight 
din of jeers and whistles coming down from the stands at the Bernabeu.
 
43 min: Isco into the book, shown yellow for a late challenge on a Granada 
midfielder.
 
41 min: Now it’s Madrid who just miss out on opening the scoring when an Isco 
shot is fired wide.
 
38 min: Another fine chance for Granada. It’s Success who nearly puts Granada 
on the board when a deep cross to the far post lands at his feet, but Navas is 
there to turn it away.
 
36 min: A Ronaldo shot finds the post with a resounding thud, but he’s offside 
anyway. Madrid becoming gradually more calibrated in attack.

Soriano/AFP/Getty Images  
33 min: Edgar Mendez shown yellow for taking down Marcelo.
 
30 min: Just like that Ronaldo moves quickly with the ball into the left side 
of the area and finds an onrushing Modric with a perfect pass. Modric fires it 
onto the goal and Fernandez deflects the shot away. What a chance!
 
27 min: The pace has slowed a bit here as the teams trade possession in 
midfield.
 
24 min: Granada showing incredibly well so far, particularly after last year’s 
9-1 pasting here. Now it’s Krhin who nearly scores with a header toward the 
back post before Navas intervenes.
 
21 min: Sharp incisive sequence of passess up the right flank for Granada ends 
when El-Arabi runs onto a cross and fires it into the back of the net! But the 
flag is up! And the replay confirms he was indeed offside.
 
19 min: After a rapid counter-attack Isco threads a gorgeous ball through to 
Ronaldo, who rifles a shot that demands Fernandez’s best in making the save.

18 min: Best chance of the match for either side as Success runs onto a pass 
from El-Arabi but bottles it thanks to a clumsy first touch. Really should be 
1-0 to Granada.

 
16 min: Ronaldo dribbling toward the goal on the edge of the area when he goes 
down. Appeals for a foul but it’s not given. Replay confirms contact was 
incidental.
 
13 min: Madrid starting to knock on the door here with a pair of half-chances 
in the past minute, but nothing that’s really put Fernandez to the test.
 
11 min: Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> win a 
corner, their first. Played short but they’re quickly dispossessed and Granada 
are on the counter-attack again.
 
8 min: A moment of danger for the hosts as a quick Granada counter-attack ends 
when the ball skids perilously across the mouth of the goal. It’s Marcelo who 
swoops in to clear it.
 
6 min: Marcelo moves up the left flank with the ball and finds Benzema darting 
into the area, a wonderful cross that Benzema just misses. The replay confirms 
he was offside anyway, though it wasn’t called.
 
3 min: Gorgeous conditions for today’s match, a sun-splashed Saturday in 
Madrid. A patient build-up from the back by Madrid here.
 
1 min: We’re underway from the Bernabeu with Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> attacking from left to right 
in classic all-white kits.
