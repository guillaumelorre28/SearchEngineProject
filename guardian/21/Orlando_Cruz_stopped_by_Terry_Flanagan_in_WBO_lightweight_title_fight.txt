The British fighter, who now has a 32-0 record in his professional career, 
made a successful fourth defence of the belt he won last summer by knocking 
Cruz to the canvas twice in the same round in Cardiff, and the referee, Steve 
Gray, called a halt to proceedings after a powerful right hand from Flanagan.

Cruz, a 35-year-old Puerto Rican, had come out as gay in 2012 and this was his 
10th bout since his announcement, though his first in this weight class, and he 
was unable to pose many problems for the Manchester fighter Flanagan on the 
night.
