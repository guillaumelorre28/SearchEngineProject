, had completed scenes on Star Wars: Episode VIII, which is set for release in 
December – including, apparently, reunions with Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker 
and her son, Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver.

Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds's deaths were tragic coincidence – but we're 
suckers for a story

But the character will reportedly play an even larger part in the following 
film, which is scheduled to shoot early in 2018 before release at Christmas 
2019. This supposition would tally with the $50m insurance payout that Disney 
will collect following Fisher’s death.

 paraphrases insiders who says Episode IX’s writer/director, Colin Trevorrow, 
is to meet with executive producer Kathleen Kennedy to see what adjustments to 
the script are required. This may in turn mean reshoots on director Rian 
Johnson’s Star Wars: Episode VIII, to adjust its conclusion.

The studio is said to be less wary of the risks of extensive post-production 
adjustments following the healthy reception for Rogue One, of which up to a 
reported 40% was reshot. Another key element of that film – the CGI 
resurrection of Peter Cushing’s character and, in a final scene, Fisher’s – may 
also play a part in papering over the plot.

But both the ethics and logistics of such a move are said to be capping the 
extent of CGI that Disney would tolerate: incidental moments are thought to be 
acceptable, but having a computer-generated version of Fisher simply speak the 
lines designed for her in Episode IX is thought to be unlikely.

Fisher and her mother, Debbie Reynolds, were buried in a private, joint 
service in Los Angeles on 6 January. Earlier this week, apetition was launched 
on Change.org 
<https://www.change.org/p/the-walt-disney-company-make-leia-an-official-disney-princess>
 to lobby Disney to make Leia an “official” Disney princess. It so far has more 
than 53,000 signatures.
