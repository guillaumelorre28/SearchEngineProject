Adrian Lewis, twice a winner of the PDC World Darts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/darts> Championship, eased into the second 
round with a 3-0 victory over the Swede Magnus Caris. Despite missing 14 
doubles inside the opening six legs, Lewis saw off Caris with little fuss, 
hitting five maximums as he lost only four legs.

Indeed even with his early problems finishing, the 31-year-old fifth seed from 
Stoke threw a three-dart average of 93.25. Lewis will now face Joe Cullen, who 
beat the Australian Corey Cadby.

Cullen progressed past the first round for the first time at Alexandra Palace 
when he fought back after losing the first set to triumph 3-1 after a match in 
which there were 11 180s.

He took the second set with a 117 check-out and, although his 21-year-old 
opponent, who had recorded a highest ever preliminary-round three-dart average 
of 102.48 in a straight-set win over China’s Qiang Sun, took the first leg of 
the third against the throw, he won the next three to set up victory in the 
fourth.

There had been drama earlier when Mervyn King was almost dumped out at the 
first hurdle by the debutant Steve West on a night when the Professional Darts 
Corporation chairman, Barry Hearn, revealed that the 2017 winner will receive 
prize money of £400,000, an increase of £50,000.

The 22nd seed was facing a whitewash when, with West having been on a 
nine-darter, he produced a 136 checkout to rescue and then edge the third set, 
and then levelled at 2-2 with 140, 95 and 106 finishes.

In an epic tie-break during which both men struggled to hit their doubles – 
West missed with two match darts in the sixth leg – it was King who eventually 
edged home 6-4 to his immense relief.
