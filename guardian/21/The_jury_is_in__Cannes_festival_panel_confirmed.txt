The Cannes film festival has announced the full lineup of the jury 
<http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/61318.html> for its forthcoming 68th 
edition.

Joining Joel and Ethan Coen, the previously announced joint jury presidents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/20/coen-brothers-heads-of-2015-cannes-film-festival-jury>
, will be seven other entertainment industry figures who will vote on the 
festival’s main awards, including the Palme d’Or.

Four jury members are women: actors Sienna Miller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/sienna-miller> and Rossy de Palma (from the 
UK and Spain respectively), French actor-director Sophie Marceau, and Malian 
musician Rokia Traoré.

The three remaining jurists are Mexican director Guillermo del Toro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/guillermodeltoro>, US actor Jake Gyllenhaal, 
and 26-year-old Canadian film-maker Xavier Dolan.

The jury members hold a press conference at the start and end of the festival 
and will watch the 17 films in the competition – though more may be added in 
the next few days. On the festival’s closing night, the presidents will lead an 
awards ceremony handing out gongs including the Palme d’Or and the Caméra d’Or.


The Un Certain Regard section has its own jury, of which actor Isabella 
Rossellini has already been named president

The Cannes film festival <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival> 
runs from 13-24 May.

“actor-writer”. This has now been corrected.
