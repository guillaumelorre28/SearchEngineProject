The emails allegedly show confirmation of Taupau’s release from the Tigers, 
where he was signed until the end of 2016, and the confirmation of a four-year 
contract at Manly.

Taupau’s player agent Darryl Mather, described news of Nestruck’s revelation 
as “extraordinarily frustrating”, but he was leaving further comment to the two 
clubs. “I’ll allow both the Wests Tigers and Martin Taupau to make any official 
comment they might want to make on this matter,” Mather said. “I’ll be guided 
by Phil Moss [Tigers football manager] and the Wests Tigers on the matter.”


Both clubs declined to comment, saying they were looking into the matter. 
Taupau had been linked to the Sea Eagles, with Manly looking to add another 
forward to their rebuilt pack alongside Nate Myles, Lewis Brown, Darcy Lussick 
and Matt Parcell who they have already signed for next season.

The Tigers are also known to be attempting to fix their dire salary cap 
situation, following on from the attempted release of Robbie Farah in August. 
The 25-year-old Taupau is in the UK touring with the New Zealand side who face 
England in Hull on Sunday.
