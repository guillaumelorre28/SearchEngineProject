Balkan countries once divided by war, nationalism and religion have been 
quietly uniting to confront a common foe: rubbish.


Under the rubric of the Let’s Do It campaign <https://www.letsdoitworld.org/>, 
Albanian and Kosovar activists jointly cleared their border area and the 
polluted Lake Vermica last April, in a Wombles-style campaign that has involved 
more than 5% of Albania’s population, and 7% of Kosovo’s.

Even more impressively, almost 14% of Slovenia’s population 
<http://www.slovenia.si/slovenia/country/environment/lets-clean-slovenia-to-make-a-nicer-world/>
 was mobilised to clear illegal landfills in the world’s largest action of its 
kind four years ago.Trash activists in Romania too claim to have 
<https://www.letsdoitworld.org/2016/07/creating-modern-revolution-romania-fighting-trash-activizing-people/>
 created the biggest national civic movement since the revolution.

Jaka Kranjc, a spokesman for Slovenia’s Ecologists Without Borders said that 
the symbol of waste left by past generations had a special meaning in the 
region.

“The best thing about this movement is that it bridges borders and breaks 
national barriers,” he said. “When Bosnia had a clean up, they had to talk to 
several regional administrations and all the minorities cooperated, even though 
the country had been a war zone just ten years ago.”

Bosnia is one of several Balkan countries that now has annual clean up 
actions. InAlbania <https://www.theguardian.com/world/albania>, the issue has 
become so fashionable that events are now organised every six months.

One of the few Balkan countries not well represented in the clean up campaign 
is Serbia, even though it was represented at the 2011 conference, which first 
brought the region’s activists together.

“Serbian volunteers started preparing their actions afterwards but then the 
government realised this was a good idea and hijacked it,” Kranjc said. “The 
activists were shut out and it turned into a one-off public programme that was 
never repeated.”

Since its inception in Estonia in 2008, Lets Do It claims to have mobilised 
over 16m people in 113 countries. Its next global clean upplanned for September 
2018 <https://www.letsdoitworld.org/about/overview/world-cleanup-day-2016/> 
could exceed even those high numbers.

Sitting outside a cafe in Zagreb, Helena Traub, a Croatian waste activist, 
told the Guardian that the mobilisation would be “the greatest cleanup event 
yet”.

“Institutions are not enough.” she said. “The importance of civic movements is 
that they educate. When people really put their hands in the dirt, they realise 
what they are dealing with.”

School students made up most of the 55,000 volunteers who helped clear an 
estimated 37,000 tonnes of rubbish from forests, rivers, mountains and beaches 
inCroatia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/croatia> four months ago.

Recovered items from popular land cavity dump sites included sofa’s, 
unexploded ordnance and, in Zagreb last year, even a dead body, Traub said.

Not all waste reduction activism is so organised. 

In the village of Litoric on Croatia’s forested border with Slovenia, Igor 
Barbara has just returned from his daily trip to scatter past-expiry date 
bananas, watermelon and apples for the brown bears and other animals which roam 
his territory.

“We put food out for the bears every day,” he said. “We have automatic feeders 
that dispense food every month and we also do planting and seeding and we 
secure peace in this area from poachers.”

The head of the local Jelenski Harak hunting club, Barbara describes himself 
an environmentalist and the 2m tonnes of food that he gleans from local 
supermarkets, are his weapons in the war against food waste.

“Annually we get around two tonnes of food for the bears, wild boars, red deer 
and roe deer to eat. This is just a supplement to what these animals can find 
in the forest, but it prevents problems between villagers and bears,” he said.

Wild boars have caused the biggest headache for local people but two young 
male bears also sparked alarm this summer, after raiding garbage bins left 
outside houses. Scared villagers reacted by calling hunters, who shot one of 
the animals.

“A good way to prevent the bears from coming into the villages is to leave 
apples out for them in the forest,” Barbara said.
