After more than 10 years of marriage the actor Gwyneth Paltrow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow> and British rock star Chris 
Martin have announced that they are to split up.

A statement on Paltrow's website, Goop, announced on Tuesday that the couple 
were embarking on a"Conscious Uncoupling"

.

"It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate," the 
couple wrote.

"We have been working hard for well over a year, some of it together, some of 
it separated, to see what might have been possible between us, and we have come 
to the conclusion that while we love each other very much we will remain 
separate."

It went on: "We are, however, and always will be a family, and in many ways we 
are closer than we have ever been. We are parents first and foremost, to two 
incredibly wonderful children and we ask for their and our space and privacy to 
be respected at this difficult time. We have always conducted our relationship 
privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and coparent, we will be 
able to continue in the same manner."

The message was signed simply, "Love, Gwyneth & Chris."

Paltrow, 41, who won a best actress Academy award for Shakespeare in Love, and 
British singer Martin, 37, were married in December 2003, and have two 
children, Apple and Moses.

Last month, the editor of the influential US magazine Vanity Fair penned a 
1,500-word article 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/feb/18/graydon-carter-gwynethpaltrow>
 to explain to readers why he had not published an article about Paltrow.

The Los Angles-born actress, named by alternative US magazines as the "most 
hated celebrity" and the "world's most beautiful woman", had been engaged in a 
dispute for almost a year with the magazine, which was said to have been 
planning to run an essay on "the Gwyneth Paltrow love/hate phenomenon".
