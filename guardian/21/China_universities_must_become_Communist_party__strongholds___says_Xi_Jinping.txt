Chinese authorities must intensify ideological controls on academia and turn 
universities into Communist party “strongholds”, PresidentXi Jinping 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping> has declared in a major address.

“Higher education ... must adhere to correct political orientation,” Xi said 
in a high-profile speech to top party leaders and university chiefs that was 
delivered at a two-day congress on “ideological and political work” in Beijing.


Universities must be transformed into “strongholds that adhere to party 
leadership” and political education should be made “more appealing”, the 
president ordered,according to Xinhua, China’s official news agency 
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-12/09/c_135891337.htm>. Experts have 
described it as the latest phase of Beijing’s bid to rein in opposition to its 
rule.

Xi, a populist strongman who recently reaffirmed his political authority by 
being declared the party’s “core leader” 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-communist-party.html>
, said teachers needed to be both “disseminators of advanced ideology” and 
“staunch supporters of [party] governance”.

Echoing a 1932 speech by Joseph Stalin 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/05/soviet-russia-stalin-westerman> the 
Chinese president told his audience teachers were“engineers of the human soul 
<http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2016-12-08/doc-ifxypizi9988442.shtml>” whose “sacred 
mission” was to help students “improve in ideological quality, political 
awareness, moral characteristics and humanistic quality”.

“Party authorities should increase their contact with intellectuals in 
colleges, befriend them and sincerely listen to their opinions,” Xi added, 
pointing out that the party’s education policies “must be fully carried out”.

Carl Minzner, an expert in Chinese law and politics from Fordham University in 
New York, said Xi’s speech appeared to signal the next phase of a decade-long 
campaign to wrest back control of areas it feared were “getting out of control” 
such as the media, public interest law and academia.

What you are seeing is a reassertion of ideological control
Carl Minzner, Fordham University 
“What you are seeing is a reassertion of ideological control because they feel 
that colleges and schools are the hotbeds for ideas that potentially could be 
problematic; ideas of constitutionalism, ideas of liberalism. This is an effort 
to figure out, ‘How do we get a tighter control over that?’ and it looks like 
this is definitely going to be rolling through all of China’s colleges over the 
next couple of years. This is a big deal.”

Universities have been coming under increasing pressure since 2014, when a 
party-run newspaper sent its reporters into classrooms andaccused Chinese 
academics of not giving enough support to the country’s political system 
<http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/newspaper-calls-on-chinese-academics-to-cut-the-criticism/?_r=0>
.

“The atmosphere in higher education has been getting progressively colder over 
the last couple of years … I think people have already begun getting the 
message: ‘You need to watch yourself,’” said Minzner. “[But] this is a signal 
that things are about to go to the next level.”

The American scholar predicted the brunt of Xi’s ideological offensive would 
be felt by social science departments. The result would be growing 
self-censorship, the avoidance of politically sensitive research topics and a 
proliferation of academic studies into the speeches and policies of Xi, who 
became China’s top leader in November 2012.

But the moves could also affect international schools in China, which have 
been facinggrowing scrutiny as part of a push to counter the propagation of 
western ideas

, and the flow of Chinese students to higher education institutions in 
countries such as the US and Britain.

“I think that you might start to see Chinese officials begin to think that 
this is not such a good thing, and begin to decide that it is less desirable 
and to begin to discourage that in certain ways,” Minzner said. “There is a 
fundamental contradiction between [the expansion of international education] 
and the current direction in which the party is going.”

Qiao Mu, an outspoken professor from Beijing Foreign Studies University, 
questioned whether Xi’s commands would have a “real impact” on campus life but 
said they were likely to influence Communist party officials working in 
universities.

Qiao, one of the victims of the crackdown on academia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/06/china-xi-jinping-crackdown-liberal-academics-minor-cultural-revolution>
, said Chinese students had long had “socialist values” drilled into them by 
teachers. “They’re already used to it.”

These days, however, the greatest influence on China’s youth was not socialism 
but social media, the scholar added.
