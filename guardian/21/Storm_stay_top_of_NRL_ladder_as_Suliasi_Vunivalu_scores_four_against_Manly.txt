A historic four-try haul to rookie Suliasi Vunivalu fired Melbourne to a testy 
38-18 victory over Manly, keeping them on track to claim theNRL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> minor premiership. Vunivalu’s 30-minute 
quartet on Saturday evening lifted his tally to 21 in just 16 games, equalling 
the rookie record set by former Storm star and eventual dual-code international 
Israel Folau back in 2007.

The win, the Storm’s seventh in their past eight games, consolidates their 
spot on top of the competition ladder, three points ahead of Cronulla, who face 
South Sydney on Monday night.

In front of a modest crowd of 8,241 at Brookvale Oval – their second smallest 
of the season – the Sea Eagles simply had no answer to Vunivalu’s try-scoring 
potency as the Storm cruised to a 26-6 half-time lead.


However, as they have for most of the year, Manly refused to throw the towel 
in after the break, with another rookie Brad Parker completing a brace and 
Jorge Taufua crossing in his 100th NRL game.


Taufua’s 62nd-minute effort reduced the gap to 14 with just under 20 minutes 
remaining and, while tempers flared a number of times in the closing stages, 
the Storm held on to claim their 18th win of the year.


Melbourne prop Felise Kaufusi sealed victory with a try on full-time, set up 
by Cooper Cronk’s 25th try assist of the year, the most of any player in the 
NRL.


Vunivalu became the first player to bag four in one half since former Sea 
Eagles winger David Williams did it in 2012, and just the sixth Storm player to 
achieve the feat.


His first came when Cameron Munster darted a pass in the 10th minute, and 
bagged his second when he chased through a Cronk bomb that neither Tom 
Trbojevic nor Jorge Taufua wanted a part of in the 26th minute.


The Fijian scored his third and fourth in the space of just two minutes, 
taking another long ball from Munster in the 38th minute before finishing off a 
Cronk banana kick to give the Storm a 20-point half-time lead.


While Vunivalu scored the tries, Munster, Cronk and Dale Finucane were also 
immense for the Storm, who were able to rest captain Cameron Smith for the 
final 10 minutes of the match.

North Queensland powered to a 34-6 victory over the Warriors to snap their 
three-game losing streak. The Cowboys ran away with the match in the first half 
in Townsville, opening up a 22-6 lead by the break.

The result keeps the premiers firmly in the hunt for a top-four finish, and 
they are just two points behind the fourth-placed Canterbury before a clash 
with the Bulldogs next Thursday.


But defeat came at heavy cost for the Warriors, whose finals hopes hang by a 
thread after back-to-back defeats. They are ninth on the ladder on 24 points 
and three behind eighth-placed Gold Coast with just two rounds remaining.

To add insult to injury, the Warriors had two of their key backs join hooker 
Issac Luke (knee) in the casualty room. Top try-scorer Solomone Kata 
(hamstring) failed to start the match, while big winger Ken Maumalo (hamstring) 
limped off midway through the opening half.

After losses to Melbourne, Wests Tigers and the Sydney Roosters, the Cowboys 
wasted no time getting back to their best. Kyle Feldt scored two tries in quick 
succession off Michael Morgan kicks, and Jason Taumalolo added a third 
four-pointer in the 23rd minute to race to a 16-0 lead.

In a rare bright spot for the Warriors, teenager Ata Hingano made an instant 
impact on his NRL debut by sending skipper Ryan Hoffman over for the visitors’ 
only try of the night.


Tries to Justin O’Neill, Ray Thompson and Michael Morgan completed the rout 
for the Cowboys as the Warriors were held scoreless in the second half.

Gold Coast took another step towards securing their first NRL finals berth in 
six years with a comfortable 26-6 victory over last-placed Newcastle at Hunter 
Stadium.

The Titans (27 points) consolidated eighth spot on the ladder with two games 
remaining against Penrith (home) and North Queensland (away), and extended the 
Knights’ club-record losing streak to 16.

The only concern for the Titans was when code-hopping recruit Jarryd Hayne was 
helped off in the 65th minute after taking a head knock in a tackle involving 
fellow Fijian international Jacob Saifiti.

Hayne, who took no further part in the match, had played a mostly supporting 
role in his third game back in the NRL, taking a back seat to his forwards who 
scored all four tries for the Titans.

Co-captain Ryan James, a controversial inclusion, crashed over twice in the 
first 20 minutes as the Titans raced to an 18-0 lead.

James was considered fortunate to have been on the field, having been found 
guilty of a grade-two careless high tackle that broke Wests Tigers fullback 
James Tedesco’s jaw. The fiery front-rower was cleared to play after the 
judiciary panel downgraded his charge to grade one.

Former Queensland utility forward Chris McQueen scored in the 16th minute as 
the Titans threatened to hand the Knights another thrashing on home turf, but 
winger Nathan Ross responded with a 90-metre intercept try in the 28th minute, 
cutting the deficit to 18-6 at halftime.

Titans prop Luke Douglas burrowed over from a quick tap to score in the 50th 
minute, extending the visitors’ lead to 24-6, then former Knights halfback 
Tyrone Roberts added a penalty goal five minutes from full-time.

After missing the past two games because of a knee injury, Roberts returned 
against his old club in place of regular playmaker Ash Taylor, who was rested 
to recover from several niggles.

Chasing their first win in 133 days, and only their second of the season, 
Newcastle (seven points) remain anchored at the bottom of the ladder and will 
collect their second-successive wooden spoon.

The Knights were always at long odds to end their four-month losing streak but 
their chances were not enhanced by the late withdrawal of Jarrod Mullen (knee) 
and Sione Matautia (concussion).
