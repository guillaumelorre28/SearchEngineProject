Dreamworld has reopened its premier thrill-seeker attraction, the Tower of 
Terror, for the first time since an accident at theGold Coast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gold-coast> theme park killed four 
people.

Another of the park’s nine thrill-seeker rides, the Tail Spin, was also 
reopened on Thursday after passing a number of independent safety reviews.

It means just three high-intensity rides remain closed after the park was shut 
for more than a month following thetragedy in October on the now-defunct 
Thunder River Rapids ride

Each ride in the park was forced to undergo an extensive, three-tiered testing 
process after the accident.

After first being passed by the park’s internal engineering review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/31/dreamworld-orders-review-of-all-mechanical-rides-but-remains-closed>
, they were then the focus of a Workplace Health and Safety audit, and an 
independent peer review by a British theme park.

Since reopening on 10 December, attendances and profits have been 
significantly down at what is traditionally one of the Gold Coast’s biggest 
attractions.

A trade update for the park this month revealed that profits had dropped 
$3.6m, or 63%, between its reopening and 31 December against the same period in 
2015. It has led to the park offering discount tickets to try to entice locals 
and tourists back through the gates.

The park’s owner, Ardent Leisure, has previously stated it expects all rides 
to be operating by the end of the month.
