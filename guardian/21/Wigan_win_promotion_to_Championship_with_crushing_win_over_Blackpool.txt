Wigan Athletic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wiganathletic> confirmed 
their immediate return to the Championship with a 4-0 win at Blackpool. The 
result also means that their fellow former Premier League club are left 
clinging to their third-tier status by a thread.

Chris McCann, the first-half substitute Yanick Wildschut twice and Will Grigg 
all scored in the second half, after the two teams had turned around 0-0. The 
result means that only Burton Albion can catch the league leaders, if they beat 
Gillingham later on Saturday. Even then, Wigan’s goal difference is superior by 
21 so their title is all but secured.

Blackpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/blackpool> cannot be relegate 
this weekend. However Fleetwood, the only team who could replace them in the 
bottom four, will be safe if they beat Walsall on Monday. That match has 
implications on the promotion chase as well, as a Burton win combined with a 
Walsall defeat would also see the Brewers promoted.

Before the match Blackpool supporters staged a protest against the club’s 
owners, the Oyston family, which included the now seemingly obligatory banner 
flown over the ground.
