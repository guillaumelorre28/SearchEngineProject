Kick It Out has criticised the Port Vale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portvale> owner Norman Smurthwaite for 
the “outrageous” decision to overlook Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink as manager over 
fears the decision to appoint him would lead to racist abuse from the club’s 
own supporters.

Having put the League One club up for sale earlier in the week

, the Port Vale owner told the The Sentinel he turned down the chance to 
appoint the former Holland international,now manager at QPR

.

Port Vale were given a warning by the Football Association in 2013 following 
an investigation into racist chanting in a home match with Bradford and 
Smurthwaite did not take Hasselbaink “because of the racial issue the club had 
got”.

“I didn’t think it was fair on him,” he told The Sentinel. “Can you imagine 
the poor bloke getting abuse, along with the normal abuse if results were going 
against him?

“He would have been right for the club without doubt but I don’t think the 
club would have been right for him. Ninety-nine per cent of our fans are 
excellent but a small minority leave us with policing and other issues.”

They are comments that have been criticised by football’s anti-discrimination 
campaign Kick It Out and its chairman Lord Herman Ouseley.

“This is outrageous that we have an owner admitting he wanted to protect a 
manager because of the possibility of abuse, he has discriminated against 
Hasselbaink and denied him the opportunity of being Port Vale manager,” he said 
in a statement.

“If there’s a problem then it needs to be addressed and tackled. If education 
is needed then let’s do something about it.

“It is a sad day for Port Vale Football Club in 2015 when a football club 
owner admits this. Are black managers not capable of protecting themselves? The 
main criteria should be the best person for the job. Owners and decision makers 
at football clubs have a duty of care to appoint the best candidate.”
