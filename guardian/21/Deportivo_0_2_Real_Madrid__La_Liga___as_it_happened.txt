Well, it always looked like fantasy to hope Barcelona would slip up at 
Granada, butReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> put 
in a dominant display here. Ronaldo scored twice, hit the woodwork twice, and 
Isco, Marcelo and Bale all went close in the second half. It could have been 
more, although Rober did miss a sitter for Depor with 20 minutes left. It was 
all rather anti-climactic, but there we go: such is football, I suppose.

Real wrap up second place, although they have the chance to win another 
Champions League in 10 days’ time against Atléti. If they play as they did 
today they’ll be tough to beat.

some decent stops today, and he had to be down quickly to deny Marcelo again! 
Marcelo’s been eating his oatmeal: where does he get his energy from?!

83 min: Ack, Luis Alberto dallied when he should have shot, and the chance is 
lost. But Depor come again, and they force a corner on the left. It’s cleared, 
but Depor knock it back in, and then Sidnei is narked off when the linesman 
says he took the ball over the byline. I’m not sure he did.

82 min: Pletikosa saves with his feet to deny Marcelo! Terrible defending by 
Fede Cartabia, and Marcelo poked it goalwards, but Pletikosa did well to save. 
Real have just perked up in these last 10 minutes or so: the substitutes have 
had an effect.

77 min: Great chance for James! Saved by Pletikosa, but it was flagged 
offside, and it wouldn’t have counted. James was all alone on the right side of 
the box, and he tried to place it past the Croatian keeper, but the accuracy 
was lacking. Actually, that was a poor decision: James was level.

two-one. What a chance that was for Rober! Mosquera from long range, but it’s

72 min: What a save from Keylor Navas! Lucas Perez’s cross, and it was Rober, 
the substitute with a free header in the six-yard box! The Real defence went 
missing, and Rober was totally free, but he planted it at straight at Navas, 
who came up big and kept it out! Superb reactions, but, boy, Rober should have 
scored. That might even have been his first touch.

unfolded:

Thanks for reading. Bye!
 
Well, it always looked like fantasy to hope Barcelona would slip up at 
Granada, butReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> put 
in a dominant display here. Ronaldo scored twice, hit the woodwork twice, and 
Isco, Marcelo and Bale all went close in the second half. It could have been 
more, although Rober did miss a sitter for Depor with 20 minutes left. It was 
all rather anti-climactic, but there we go: such is football, I suppose.

Real wrap up second place, although they have the chance to win another 
Champions League in 10 days’ time against Atléti. If they play as they did 
today they’ll be tough to beat.

Luis Suarez has finished the season with 40 goals. Madon!
 
Well, Real finish with a 12th straight victory, but Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have wrapped up a 3-0 victory 
at Granada, and the title is theirs. Congratulations to Luis Enrique and his 
team!
 
That’s the whistle, and it’s official: Real finish second in La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>.
 
90 min: Good defending from Sidnei to prevent the corner. We’re into stoppage 
time. Honestly, what’s the point?

87 min: Well, that’s that. Luis Suarez completes his hat-trick, Barcelona

title will not be coming to Madrid. More here:

85 min: Pletikosa had a pretty terrible World Cup two years ago, but he’s made 
some decent stops today, and he had to be down quickly to deny Marcelo again! 
Marcelo’s been eating his oatmeal: where does he get his energy from?!
 
83 min: Ack, Luis Alberto dallied when he should have shot, and the chance is 
lost. But Depor come again, and they force a corner on the left. It’s cleared, 
but Depor knock it back in, and then Sidnei is narked off when the linesman 
says he took the ball over the byline. I’m not sure he did.
 
82 min: Pletikosa saves with his feet to deny Marcelo! Terrible defending by 
Fede Cartabia, and Marcelo poked it goalwards, but Pletikosa did well to save. 
Real have just perked up in these last 10 minutes or so: the substitutes have 
had an effect.
 
80 min: It looks like it’s Barca’s title, doesn’t it? Real have done so well 
to yank themselves back into contention, but it was always a tall order. Can 
Granada find two goals in the last 10 minutes?
 
79 min: Oh, that would have been a brilliant goal by Isco. Wonderful disguised 
pass to Benzema, and he went for the return cross, but his header was just 
wide. Football to savour from the bearded duo.
 
77 min: Great chance for James! Saved by Pletikosa, but it was flagged 
offside, and it wouldn’t have counted. James was all alone on the right side of 
the box, and he tried to place it past the Croatian keeper, but the accuracy 
was lacking. Actually, that was a poor decision: James was level.

75 min: Double change for Depor: Oriol Riera is on for Fajr, and Borges 
replaces Mosquera. Also, that’s Bale’s day done: Jese is on in his place.

74 min: So finally Depor are showing signs of life, and it really should be 
two-one. What a chance that was for Rober! Mosquera from long range, but it’s 
high.
 
72 min: What a save from Keylor Navas! Lucas Perez’s cross, and it was Rober, 
the substitute with a free header in the six-yard box! The Real defence went 
missing, and Rober was totally free, but he planted it at straight at Navas, 
who came up big and kept it out! Superb reactions, but, boy, Rober should have 
scored. That might even have been his first touch.
 
71 min: A bit more space now, and Pepe has to be watchful to stop Lucas Perez 
going beyond. Corner to Depor.
 
70 min: Great vision from Modric to find Carvajal in the penalty area with a 
round-the corner pass, but he can’t find the cross. First change for Depor: 
Arribas off, Rober on.
