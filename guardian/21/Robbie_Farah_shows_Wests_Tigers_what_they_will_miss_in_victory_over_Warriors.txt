 management red-faced after leading his side to a 50-16 NRL win over the 
Warriors at Campbelltown Stadium. After being told he was unwanted by the club 
next year, Farah starred with a try and set up another two on Sunday as the 
Tigers lifted themselves off the bottom of the ladder.

“Robbie” chants sprang up regularly, including when he was replaced midway 
through the second half, as the 6,711 fans in attendance showed their 
appreciation. They also let Tigers coach Jason Taylor know their feelings 
towards him, roundly booing him as he came from the field following the warm up.

The match was likely Farah’s last in the black, white and orange at 
Campbelltown after being given an ultimatum: find another club or play reserve 
grade next year.

The loss was the Warriors’ seventh in a row and looks set to be the last game

The Tigers ensured Keith Galloway and Pat Richards’ final home games for the 
club were memorable with a nine-tries-to-three romp.

The Tigers’ outside men including Tim Simona and Kevin Naiqama dined out in 
the second half while young halves Luke Brooks and Mitchell Moses had their 
best games all year. However, it was Farah who led the charge, putting in a 
strong audition for any club who might be interested in his services.

After the Warriors snatched an early 6-0 lead through Albert Vete, it was all 
Tigers for the rest of the half as Farah sparked them to life. A “Robbie” chant 
went up around Campbelltown Stadium when Farah burrowed over on the back of a 
Simona break down the left edge.

He then set up the Tigers’ next two tries to give them an 18-6 advantage at 
the break. After putting Curtis Sironen through a hole, he backed up and 
produced a sensational flick pass to put Brooks over. Five minutes later, he 
stabbed the ball into the in-goal for Dene Halatau as the home side took the 
ascendancy.

The second half was just six minutes old when James Tedesco put Simona into a 
hole and proceeded to make Tomkins – who left the field soon after – look 
ordinary by running around him with ease.

It was a steady procession of Tigers tries for the rest of the half as 
Naiqama, David Nofoaluma, Richards and Martin Taupau were able to get on the 
scoreboard. The Warriors will also be facing a nervous wait over Charlie Gubb 
after he was put on report for two shoulder charges.

In the late game, mercurial forward Dave Taylor gave a glimpse of what could 
have been in his final NRL home match for Gold Coast. The giant forward secured 
a match-winning try in his last outing at CBUS Super Stadium, crashing over to 
secure the Titans a 28-26 victory on Sunday over St George Illawarra.

Taylor’s match-winner came when the former Queensland and Australian 
representative burrowed over from dummy-half. It was the second try of the 
match for Taylor, who – after a Gareth Widdop breakaway try for St George 
Illawarra – also took the ensuing crucial kick-off which went over the deadball 
line and forced the Dragons into a line dropout.

It was a display tinged with some regret for rugby league fans, however, with 
Taylor set to head to France at the end of the season to join Super League side 
Catalans Dragons.


The defeat will be a concern for Dragons coach Paul McGregor, with 
ninth-placed Manly still a mathematical chance of pushing them out of the eight 
in the final weekend of the regular season.


The Dragons had held a 20-12 half-time lead and would have expected to take 
the points against a Titans team which suffered a blow before kick-off with 
captain Nate Myles (thumb) ruled out.


The hosts also spent most of the second half down to just one fit player on 
the bench with Beau Falloon (knee), Eddy Pettybourne (ankle) and Lachlan Burr 
(hip) all picking up knocks.


But a second-half double by David Mead and Taylor’s second of the match sealed 
the win and gave the Titans hope of avoiding the club’s second wooden spoon in 
five seasons.
