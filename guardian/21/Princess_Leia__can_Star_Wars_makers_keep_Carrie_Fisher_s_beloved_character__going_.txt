<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/27/carrie-fisher-celebrity-tributes>
 has not just left Star Wars fans heartbroken – it may thrust the Disney film 
studio into a dilemma over the fate of her iconic character Princess Leia as it 
moves forward with the film franchise.


Fisher, 60, enjoyed a new round of fame when Princess Leia, Harrison Ford’s 
Han Solo and Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker were reunited on screen for 2015’s
Star Wars: The Force Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii>, which sold more than 
$2bn in tickets at the global box office.

Fisher had finished filming for the 2017 release of Star Wars: Episode VIII 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars--episode-viii>, Disney said. Plot 
details have remained a closely guarded secret.

 Fisher was also expected to play a key role in the ninth instalment of the 
sci-fi saga, due for release in 2019.

 A Disney spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment on whether Leia would 
appear in films beyond Episode VIII.

Star Wars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> director Colin Trevorrow 
had said in a January 2016 interview that he was excited “to find new places 
that we can take” the characters of Princess Leia and her on-screen twin 
brother Luke Skywalker.

 “They are icons but they’re also people that have suffered tremendous loss 
and challenge over the course of all these films,” Trevorrow told celebrity 
news outlet Entertainment Tonight.

 Carrie Fisher’s original audition for the role of Princess Leia. 
Amid grieving over Fisher’s death, Star Wars fans have speculated on how the 
battle between good and evil in the Galactic Empire could continue without 
Fisher playing Leia, a fearless Rebel Alliance fighter who in The Force Awakens 
had become a general.

Leia appears briefly in the standalone movie now in theatres, Rogue One: A 
Star Wars Story <https://www.theguardian.com/film/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story>, 
as a digital recreation of the young princess. The late British actor Peter 
Cushing, who died in 1994, is also brought back to life as Death Star commander 
Grand Moff Tarkin for Rogue One using computer generated imagery (CGI).

Under a 1985 California law filmmakers must get permission from the estate of 
a celebrity to use his or her image for up to 70 years after death.


 Other possibilities include redrafting the plot of Episode IX, reshooting 
scenes from Episode VIII, or casting someone else, as the makers of Harry 
Potter did when Richard Harris, who played headmaster Albus Dumbledore, died 
after filming the first two movies.

 Some fans have suggested that singer Stevie Nicks 
<http://heavy.com/news/2016/12/carrie-fisher-death-dead-affect-star-wars-episode-8-9-filming-production-delay-leia-organa-role/>
 could play Leia in future movies. But others said the character should be 
given a glorious screen death.

 “I swear they better find a way to write Princess Leia out of the movies, 
cause if they try and recast there will be hell to pay,” a fan identified as 
Kaitlin tweeted.
