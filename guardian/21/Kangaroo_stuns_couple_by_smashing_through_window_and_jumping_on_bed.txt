A Victorian couple was left stunned when a kangaroo landed on their bed after 
crashing through the window of their Torquay home.

Bill and Norma McConnell were enjoying a Sunday morning lie-in when the 
kangaroo bounced on to their bed.

“It’s obviously had the momentum to jump through the window and virtually land 
on top of Norma, only a few feet from her face,” Bill McConnell told 3AW radio.

The kangaroo kept going, bounding off the bed, through the bedroom door and 
down the passageway. “It took a while to realise it was, in fact, a kangaroo,” 
McConnell said.

He gave chase, watching the marsupial bang into furniture as it tried to 
escape through closed windows. “I picked up a chair, like a lion tamer, to 
protect myself just in case,” McConnell said. “It then hit the TV … and then it 
just sat behind a chair”.

After getting its bearings, the roo found the back door open and skipped off 
into the morning light, sailing over a two-metre fence on its way.

“I am just lucky we weren’t hurt,” McConnell said.
