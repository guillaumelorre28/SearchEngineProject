coin was allegedly thrown at them from an away supporters’ section of the 
stadium.

Following the game Rangers issued a statement that read: “Queen’s Park Rangers 
Football Club is aware ofa coin throwing incident

 that took place during the first half of today’s fixture against Birmingham 
City.

“A coin from the School End stand, in which the visiting supporters were 
situated, was thrown towards the Rangers players as the Rs celebrated their 
second goal in our Sky Bet Championship fixture at Loftus Road.

“The club will continue to review video footage and liaise with the 
Metropolitan and West Midlands police. The club will be making no further 
comment at this time.”

A Birmingham spokesman said: “If anybody is found to have thrown a coin we 
will take the strongest possible action. As a club we utterly condemn that sort 
of behaviour.

“We will be liaising with the relevant bodies, including West Midlands Police, 
to investigate such allegations.”
