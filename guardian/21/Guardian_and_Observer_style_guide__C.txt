cabby
not cabbie, but the plural is cabbies

cabin attendant, crew, staff
not air hostesses

cabinet, shadow cabinet
but Cabinet Office

caddie
tee; caddy tea

Cádiz

Caernarfon
place; Lord Carnarvon person (he lives at Highclere Castle in West Berkshire)

caesarean section
Julius Caesar is not thought to have been born by C-section (because his 
mother survived his birth)

caesar salad
attributed to the restaurateur Caesar Cardini

Caesars Palace
hotel and casino in Las Vegas; this one really is named after Julius Caesar

Cafcass
Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service

cafe
no accent

Calais refugee camp


instead of the “Jungle”. While the “Jungle” is recognised as the camp’s name, 
it is a derogatory term so its use should be limited


Calcutta
now Kolkata

calf leather
but calf’s liver

Californian
a person; the adjective is California, which is why Brian Wilson did not write 
a song called Californian Girls; the same rule applies to other US states, so a 
“Texan drilling for Texas tea” is an oilman

call girl
like “vice girl”, an old-fashioned term encountered only in the tabloids, 
where it is always the 1950s

callous
adjective, meaning hardened, metaphorically or literally; callus (plural 
calluses) noun, meaning hard area of skin.

The correct word to use to mean “covered in calluses” is in fact calloused, 
from the medical verb, to callous; although callused is often seen

Calor
TM

Cambodian names
Normally, family name is followed by given name, eg Lim Samnang on first 
mention, thereafter Lim

Cambridge Union Society, Durham Union Society, Oxford Union
are debating societies, not to be confused with Cambridge University students’ 
union, Durham students’ union, or Oxford University student union

Campaign for Better Transport
formerly Transport 2000

Campari
TM

can not, cannot
are not the same: note the difference between “you can not eat if you don’t 
want to” and “you cannot eat porridge with a knife”

Canal+
French TV channel, formerly Canal Plus

canal boats
A narrowboat is the popular type of British canal boat, 7ft wide and up to 
72ft long – do not call it a barge; a wider version (typically 10-14ft wide) is 
a broadbeam narrowboat. A barge is a broader (10-14ft wide) cargo-carrying boat 
- normally towed but sometimes self-powered. The version with accommodation is 
usually a Dutch barge. A cruiser is the white-hulled GRP (glass-reinforced 
plastic) style of boat, more commonly seen on rivers; smaller versions are 
cabin cruisers.

The difference between narrowboat and barge is important, particularly if you 
don’t want to get stuck in a narrow lock somewhere outside Birmingham

Canary Wharf
the whole development, not the main tower, which is 1 Canada Square

Cancún
city in Mexico

cannabis
people smoke cannabis rather than “experiment” with it, despite what 
politicians and young members of the royal family might claim

canon
cleric, decree, principle, body of writings, type of music; cannon something 
you fire (plural: cannon, not cannons)

Canute
(c994-1035) Danish king of England, Denmark and Norway who commanded the tide 
to turn back, so the legend says – not in a vain attempt to exercise power over 
nature, but to prove to his toadying courtiers that he was not all-powerful

canvas
tent, painting

canvass
solicit votes

CAP
common agricultural policy

capitals
“I am a poet: I distrust anything that starts with a capital letter and ends 
with a full stop” (Antjie Krog)

Times have changed since the days of medieval manuscripts with elaborate 
hand-illuminated capital letters, or Victorian documents in which not just 
proper names, but virtually all nouns, were given initial caps (a Tradition 
valiantly maintained to this day by Estate Agents).

A look through newspaper archives would show greater use of capitals the 
further back you went. The tendency towards lowercase, which in part reflects a 
less formal, less deferential society, has been accelerated by the explosion of 
the internet: some web companies, and many email users, have dispensed with 
capitals altogether.

Our style reflects these developments. We aim for coherence and consistency, 
but not at the expense of clarity. As with any aspect of style, it is 
impossible to be wholly consistent – there are almost always exceptions, so if 
you are unsure check for an individual entry in this guide. But here are the 
main principles:

jobs all lc, eg prime minister, US secretary of state, chief rabbi, editor of 
the Guardian.

titles cap up titles, but not job description, eg President Barack Obama (but 
the US president, Barack Obama, and Obama on subsequent mention); the Duke of 
Westminster (the duke at second mention); Pope Francis but the pope.

government departments in English-speaking countries
Initial capitals when full name is used, eg Home Office, Foreign Office, 
Ministry of Justice (UK), Department of Defense, Department of Homeland 
Security (US), Department of Immigration and Border Protection (Australia), 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural 
Resources (Irish Republic), Ministry of Railways (India).
Lowercase when abbreviated or paraphrased, eg justice ministry, defense 
department, Australia’s immigration department, Canadian fisheries ministry, 
Indian railway ministry, etc.
Lowercase for translations of government departments in non-English-speaking 
countries, eg French foreign ministry, Russian ministry of emergency 
situations, etc.

See departments of state 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-d#departments> for a 
full list of British ones

government agencies, public bodies, quangos initial caps, eg Crown Prosecution 
Service, Equality and Human Rights Commission, Heritage Lottery Fund, Revenue & 
Customs.

acts of parliament initial caps (but bills lc), eg Official Secrets Act, Child 
Poverty Act 2010, local government bill.


airports cap the name but lc the generic part (if necessary at all), eg 
Heathrow, Gatwick (no need for “airport”), Liverpool John Lennon airport.

artistic and cultural names of institutions, etc, get initial caps, eg British 
Museum, National Gallery, Royal Albert Hall, Tate Modern. Books, films, music, 
works of art, etc have initial caps except a, an, and, at, for, from, in, of, 
the, to (except in initial positions or after a colon), eg There is a Light 
That Never Goes Out.

bridges initial caps, eg Brooklyn Bridge, Sydney Harbour Bridge, Waterloo 
Bridge.

churches, hospitals and schools cap up the proper or placename, lc the rest, 
eg St Nicolas church, Newbury; Great Ormond Street children’s hospital; Ripon 
grammar school, Vernon county primary school.

epochs initial caps, eg Anthropocene, Mesolithic, Palaeolithic.

geographical features lc, eg river Thames, Sydney harbour, Monterey peninsula, 
Bondi beach, Solsbury hill (but Mount Everest).

parliamentary committees, reports and inquiries
all lc, eg trade and industry select committee, royal commission on long-term 
care for the elderly, Jenkins report.

universities and colleges of further and higher education caps for 
institution, lc for departments, eg Sheffield University department of medieval 
and modern history, Oregon State University, Free University of Berlin, 
University of Queensland school of journalism, London College of Communication.

words and phrases based on proper names that have lost connection with their 
origins (alsatian dog, cardigan, cheddar cheese, french windows, swiss roll, 
wellington boots, yorkshire pudding and many others) are lc.

Those that retain a strong link, which may be legally recognised, include 
Cornish pasty, Melton Mowbray pork pies, Parma ham and Worcestershire sauce, 
and take initial cap.

Although champagne and scotch are legally required to come from Champagne and 
Scotland, they are almost universally regarded as lc

cappuccino

captions
Captions are an opportunity to give readers further information, rather than 
insulting their intelligence by stating the obvious.

A photograph illustrating an election in Croatia, say, may show a woman 
pushing a pram past a hoarding covered with candidates’ posters. The caption 
tells us: ‘A woman pushes a pram past a hoarding covered with election posters 
in Zagreb,’ whereas it might say: ‘Polls indicate that women’s votes will be a 
deciding factor in the Croatian election.’

There is no need to put (left) after one of the names in a caption showing, 
say, Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa or William Hague and Angelina Jolie

car bomb, car park
but carmaker

carcass
plural carcasses

cards
scratchcard, smartcard, swipecard but credit card, debit card, sim card

careen
to sway or keel over to one side; often confused with career, to rush along

career girl, career woman
We don’t use these sexist labels

care home
rather than “old people’s home”

carer
an unpaid family member, partner or friend who helps a disabled or frail 
person with the activities of daily living; not someone who works in a caring 
job or profession. The term is important because carers are entitled to a range 
of benefits and services that depend on them recognising themselves as carers

Caribbean

Carlos the Jackal
real name Ilich Ramírez Sánchez

carmaker

cartel
It is dangerous to call a group of companies a cartel unless you want to hear 
from ...

Carter-Ruck
You might think that, given this law firm’s close relationship with 
newspapers, everyone would know that it’s hyphenated. You would, sadly, be wrong

Casanova
cap up, whether you are talking about the original (Giacomo Girolamo Casanova 
de Seingalt, 1725-98), or any latterday womaniser (“he is the Casanova of the 
Observer”)

casbah
rather than kasbah

cashflow


cash for honours
noun but cash-for-honours should, like similar phrases, be hyphenated when 
used adjectivally (the cash-for-honours scandal)

cashmere
fabric

caster

casting director
sometimes mistakenly referred to as a “casting agent”

castoff
one word (noun, adjective); cast off two words (verb)

she’s been taken to casualty (though normally called A&E)

Cat scan
or CT scan; it stands for computerised (axial) tomography

Catalonia
adjective Catalan

catch-22
lc unless specifically referring to Joseph Heller’s 1961 novel Catch-22, which 
explained the dilemma thus: “Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane 
if he didn’t, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was 
crazy and didn’t have to; but if he didn’t want to he was sane and had to”

catchphrase

catchup TV
not catch-up or catch up

cathedrals
cap up, eg Béziers Cathedral (its full name is Cathédrale 
Saint-Nazaire-et-Saint-Celse de Béziers)

is now acceptable to use them to mean abstaining from sexual intercourse

cellphone
mobile phone in British English

celsius

-3C (27F), etc; to convert celsius to fahrenheit, multiply by 9, divide by 5, 
then add 32; to convert fahrenheit to celsius, subtract 32, divide the answer 
by 9, then multiply by 5 (or use one of the many online calculators)

Celtic
not Glasgow Celtic

cement or concrete?
not interchangeable terms: cement is an ingredient of concrete, which is a mix 
of aggregates (sand and gravel or crushed stone) and paste (water and portland 
cement); so a “cement mixer” should always be referred to as aconcrete mixer

cenotaph
“empty tomb” in Greek; there are many, all over the world, but the Cenotaph in 
Whitehall takes a capital C

CFC
chlorofluorocarbon

chablis
wines from Chablis

cha-cha-cha
the dance, not cha-cha

chair
acceptable in place of chairman or chairwoman, being nowadays widely used in 
the public sector and by organisations such as the Labour party and trade 
unions (though not the Conservative party, which had a “chairman” in kitten 
heels); if it seems inappropriate for a particular body, use a different 
construction (“the meeting was chaired by Ian” or “Kath was in the chair”)

Chakrabarti, Shami
director of Liberty

champ at the bit
not chomp

champagne

Champions League

Champs Élysées

chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, chancellor of the exchequer

changeable

Channel, the

bailiwicks, each with its own bailiff (chief justice): Jersey (comprising the 
island of Jersey) and Guernsey (comprising the islands of Guernsey, Alderney, 
Sark, Herm, Jethou and Brecqhou).

The other crown dependency is the Isle of Man

Channel tunnel
not Chunnel

chaos theory
is not a synonym for chaos. It describes the behaviour of dynamic systems that

chardonnay

Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy

often mistakenly called “rules”. There is just one, namely: “When a meeting,

use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of 
the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.” Chatham 
House is more formally known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, 
based at Chatham House in London

chief rabbi
lc, a style consistent with that followed by Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post

chief secretary to the Treasury, chief whip

child abuse images
rather than “child pornography”, “child porn” and especially the tabloid 
“kiddy porn”.

The NSPCC says that such terms give “a misleading and potentially trivialising 
impression of what is a very serious crime”, and favours the term “child abuse 
images”.

The Internet Watch Foundation says: “The IWF uses the term ‘child sexual abuse 
content’ to accurately reflect the gravity of the images we deal with. Please 
note that child pornography, child porn and kiddy porn are not acceptable terms”

childcare, childminder

childish or childlike?
Laughing when someone breaks wind is childish; laughing when someone is flying 
a kite is childlike

ChildLine

child sexual abuse
rather than “child sex”; so for example we would refer to a “child sexual 
abuse ring” rather than a “child sex ring”

chilli

Chinese names
Mainland China: in two parts, eg Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Jiang Zemin. Hong 
Kong, Taiwan: in two parts with hyphen, eg Tung Chee-hwa, Chiang Kai-shek 
(exception: when a building, park or the like is named after a person it 
becomes three parts, eg Chiang Kai Shek Cultural Centre); note also that Korean 
names are written the same way, eg Kim Il-sung. Singapore, Malaysia: in three 
parts, eg Lee Kuan Yew.

For people with Chinese names elsewhere in the world, follow their preference 
– but make sure you know which is the surname

family name)

acceptable to refer to variant CJD as the human form of BSE, but not “the human 
form of mad cow disease”

Clapham Junction
and Clapham are two distinct, separate areas of south London.

Clapham Junction should be called just that: it is not only a railway station 
but an area in its own right with its own shopping street. It is part of 
Battersea and comes under Wandsworth council.

Clapham is about a mile and a half away, also has its own high street, and is 
part of Lambeth council

class A drugs

classic or classical?
The latter is best reserved for ancient Greece or Rome or in the phrase 
“classical music”. The former is used to describe a notable example of a 
particular era or style.

The Goths sacked Rome in classical times; Temple of Love by the Sisters of 
Mercy is a goth classic

Concerto No 2; Schubert’s Sonata in A minor for Piano, D845

far)

cliches
Overused words and phrases to be avoided, some of which merit their own 
ignominious entry in this guide, include: ahead of, back burner, boost (massive 
or otherwise), bouquets and brickbats, but hey ... , controversial, count ‘em, 
drop-dead gorgeous, elephant in the room, famous, fit for purpose, flagship, 
landmark, key, major, massive, meanwhile, ongoing, politically correct, raft of 
measures, special, stepchange, to die for, upcoming, upsurge; verbs overused or 
misused in headlines include: bid, boost, downplay, fuel, hike, insist, probe, 
quiz, set to, signal, spiral, target, unveil.

A survey by the Plain English Campaign found that the most irritating phrase 
in the language was “at the end of the day”, followed by (in order of 
annoyance): at this moment in time, like (as in, like, this), with all due 
respect, to be perfectly honest with you, touch base, I hear what you’re 
saying, going forward, absolutely, and blue sky thinking; other words and 
phrases that upset people included 24/7, ballpark figure, bottom line, diamond 
geezer, it’s not rocket science, ongoing, prioritise, pushing the envelope, 
singing from the same hymn sheet, and thinking outside the box

cliffhanger
one word

Climate Camp
disbanded in March 2011; its full name was Camp for Climate Action

climate change denier
The OED defines a sceptic as “a seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not 
yet arrived at definite conclusions”.

Most so-called “climate change sceptics”, in the face of overwhelming 
scientific evidence, deny that climate change is happening, or is caused by 
human activity, so denier is a more accurate term

coconut

coexist

cohabitant
not cohabitee

cold war

Coliseum
London theatre; Colosseum Roman amphitheatre

collectible

collective nouns
Nouns such as committee, family, government, jury, squad and team take a 
singular verb or pronoun when thought of as a single unit, but a plural verb or 
pronoun when thought of as a collection of individuals:

The committee gave its unanimous approval to the plans;

The committee enjoyed biscuits with their tea.

The family can trace its history back to the middle ages;

The family were sitting down, scratching their heads.

The squad is looking stronger than for several seasons;

The squad are all very confident that they will win promotion this season

collector’s item

College of Arms

colleges
take initial caps, eg West Kent College; but not when college forms part of 
the name of a school, eg Bash Street sixth-form college, Eton college

Colombia
South American country that we frequently misspell as “Columbia”

colon
Use between two sentences, or parts of sentences, where the first introduces a 
proposition that is resolved by the second, eg Fowler put it like this: to 
deliver the goods invoiced in the preceding words.

A colon, rather than a comma, should be used to introduce a quotation: “He was 
an expert on punctuation,” or to precede a list – “He was an expert on the 
following: the colon, the comma and the full stop.”

Use before quotes when the quote could stand on its own as a sentence. He 
said: “You’ll never take me alive.”

When a colon is used in a headline, the next word is lowercase, eg Osborne: 
there is no plan B.

This 2010 example from the Guardian is an awful (but by no means isolated) 
example of the tendency to use a semicolon where only a colon will do (all the 
more unfortunate for distracting the reader from a funny sentence): “Here’s a 
task for the new coalition government; set up a Drumming Taskforce today, and 
appoint a Snare Tsar.”

We are in danger of losing the distinction between colon and semicolon; many 
writers seem to think they are interchangeable but to make it clear: they are 
not.

See semicolon

colonel
Colonel Napoleon Bogey, subsequently Bogey (Col Bogey in leading articles)

Columbus Day (12 October, marking the date Christopher Columbus landed in the 
West Indies in 1492); Columbus is also the state capital of Ohio

comedian
male and female; do not use comedienne

commando
plural commandos

commas
Use a comma to help the reader by inserting breathing space into a sentence: 
“When the Dutch reflect on their performance in the World Cup final, they will 
not find it hard to see why their aggressive tactics lost them many friends in 
2010.”

“The editor, Alan Rusbridger, is a man of great vision” – commas if there is 
only one editor.

“The subeditor Amelia Hodsdon is all style and no substance” – no commas if 
there is more than one subeditor.

A misplaced comma can sabotage a sentence, as in this example from the paper: 
“Neocon economists often claim a large, black economy turbo-powers growth ...” 
(the writer was talking about a big black economy, not a big and black one, 
which is not the same at all).

A comma is also crucial to avoid ambiguity in examples such as this: “Part of 
the report will heavily criticise a so-called power culture among the Dublin 
bishops who have been accused of not taking the allegations seriously.” We 
should have inserted a comma after “bishops” to make clear that all the Dublin 
bishops have been accused; as published, the sentence implies that only some of 
the bishops have.

See Oxford comma

Commonwealth War Graves Commission

communique
no accent

communism, communist
lc, except in name of party, eg Communist party of Great Britain 
(Marxist-Leninist)

community
the subediting community is encouraged to weed out examples of this shockingly 
overused word

community charge
what no one, apart from a handful of Conservative ministers, called the poll 
tax

company names
A difficult area, as so many companies have adopted unconventional typography 
and other devices that, in some cases, turn their names into logos. In general, 
we use the names that companies use themselves: c2c, Capgemini, easyJet, eBay, 
ebookers, iSoft Group, etc. Some of these look odd, particularly when used as 
the first word in a headline, although some are becoming more familiar with 
time.<br

Exceptions include Adidas (not adidas), ABN Amro (not ABN AMRO), BAE Systems 
(not BAE SYSTEMS), BhS (no italicised H), Toys R Us (do not attempt to turn the 
R backwards), Yahoo (no exclamation mark).

Company names are always singular

compare to or with?
The former means liken to, the latter means make a comparison: so unless you 
are specifically likening someone or something to someone or something else, 
use compare with.

A former lord chancellor compared himself to Cardinal Wolsey because he 
believed he was like Wolsey; I might compare him with Wolsey to assess their 
relative merits.

As so often, we are indebted to Prince for the grammatically immaculate 
Nothing Compares 2U

compass points
lc for regions: eg the north, the south of England, the south-west, north-east 
Scotland, south Wales.

The same applies to geopolitical areas: the west, western Europe, the far 
east, south-east Asia, etc.

Cap up, however, when part of the name of a county (eg West Sussex, East 
Riding of Yorkshire) or province (East Java, North Sulawesi, etc).

Note the following: East End, West End (London), Middle East, Central America, 
North America, South America, Latin America

Competition and Markets Authority
formerly the Competition Commission (and yes, there is still only one)

complement, compliment, complimentary
to complement is to make complete: “the two strikers complemented each other”; 
to compliment is to praise; a complimentary copy is free

complacent
self-satisfied

complaisant 
obliging

complicit
You can be complicit in a crime, for example, if you know about it but fail to 
report it

comprise, consist, compose or constitute?
Tricky, but to get these right, just remember that comprise or consist of mean 
“made up of” while compose and constitute mean “make up”.

So you might say a band comprises guitar, bass, drums and keyboards or that it 
consists of guitar, bass, drums and keyboards. You can also say the band is 
composed of those instruments. Alternatively, you could say guitar, bass, drums 
and keyboards compose or constitute the band.

The one thing to avoid, unless you want people who care about such things to 
give you a look composed of, consisting of and comprising mingled pity and 
contempt, is “comprised of”

Concord
town in Massachusetts; Concorde plane

confidant
male; confidante female

congestion charge

Congo-Brazzaville

1832, which joined the Presbyterian Church of England in 1972 to form the

congressman, congresswoman, congressional

conjoined twins
not Siamese twins

conman

connection
not connexion

Conservative central office, Conservative party

consortium
plural consortiums not consortia

constitution
lc as in the US constitution

Consuelo
not Consuela; from a reader: “I really have had enough of show-off ignoramuses 
messing up my name. Consuelo is a Spanish abstract noun, masculine, invariable. 
Pilar and Mercedes are also Spanish female names derived, like Consuelo, from 
titles of the Virgin Mary”

consult
not consult with

consumer price index
forms the basis for the government’s inflation target and other 
inflation-linked tools; CPI after first mention

21st-century clothes

contemptible

contemptuous
displaying contempt

continent, the
but mainland Europe is preferable

continual or continuous?
the former refers to things that recur repeatedly but not constantly; the 
latter indicates an uninterrupted sequence: “My car continually breaks down 
because the radiator leaks continuously”

contractions
Do not overuse contractions such as aren’t, can’t, couldn’t, hasn’t, don’t, 
I’m, it’s, there’s and what’s (even the horrific “there’ve” has appeared); 
while they might make a piece more colloquial or easier to read, they can be an 
irritant and a distraction, and make a serious article sound frivolous. They 
also look horrible

controversial
overused, typically to show that the writer disapproves of something (“the 
government’s controversial free schools scheme”); like “famous”, it can 
normally be safely removed from copy to allow readers to make up their own minds

convener
not convenor

conversions
We give metric measures and convert on first mention only to imperial in 
brackets (exceptions: miles and pints); if a rough figure is given in metric, 
do not convert it into an exact figure in imperial, and vice versa, eg if 
someone says the towns are about 50km apart, convert to 30 miles, not “31.07 
miles”; the same goes for rough amounts of currencies, though don’t round up 
£3.6bn to £4bn

convertible
not -able

convince or persuade?
Having convinced someone of the facts, you might persuade them to do 
something, although you can be persuaded to do something without necessarily 
being convinced that it’s the right thing

attack on Clegg’s advisers”

cosmetic surgery

treated for deformity or illness

Council of Europe
not an EU institution so not to be confused with the European council, which is

councillor or counsellor?
A councillor serves on a local council; a counsellor offers advice. 

Just to confuse everyone, a member of the privy council is a privy counsellor

councils
Only the placename takes a capital: Lancaster city council, London borough of 
Southwark, Kent county council, etc; it is normally sufficient to say Lancaster 
council, Southwark council, etc

count ‘em
cliche often seen in parenthesis after a number is mentioned. For example, an 
article referred to “the seminal Andrex puppy advent calendar with 25 – count 
‘em – puppy pictures ... “

The Isle of Man and the bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel 
Islands. They are self-governing possessions of the crown recognised 
internationally as “territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible”.

Each has a chief minister as head of government and a legislative assembly 
which can pass laws subject to royal assent through the privy council.

Do not confuse them with the 14 British overseas territories (BOTs)

crucifix

crucifixion, the

Crufts

cruise missile

Crusades, the

Cruz, Penélope

cryonics and cryogenics
Cryonics is the broad term for the freezing of human or animal corpses in the 
hope of restoring them to life in future; cryogenics is the more specific 
scientific study of the production of very low temperatures and how materials 
behave at these temperatures. As an example, a person can announce they wish to 
be cryogenically frozen, but their decision may restart the debate about the 
ethics of cryonics.

cubism, cubist

Cub scouts
boys (and now girls) aged from eight to 10, organised in packs but no longer 
known as “Wolf Cubs”; avoid dated “Dyb Dyb Dyb, Dob Dob Dob” jokes but if 
relevant, it is spelt thus (it stands for “do your best” and we will “do our 
best”), and not “Dib”

cuckoo clock
originated in Germany, not Switzerland

cucumiform
cucumber-shaped

cull
means pick or choose as in “culled from the best authors”. It doesn’t mean 
killed, axed or massacred (though you cull sheep in order to kill them). So a 
jobs cull does not mean the same as mass sackings

Cultural Revolution
launched by Mao Zedong in China in 1966

CULV
consumer ultra-low voltage

cum
Latin for “with”, seen in such placenames as Chorlton-cum-Hardy, and phrases 
such as cross-cum-shot (in football) and cookbook-cum-autobiography – 
unfortunately, we wrote “cookbook-come-autobiography”

Cumberland sausage
It now has protected status, and must be made in Cumbria; hence capital C

Cummings, EE
US poet (1894-1962) who, despite what many people think, used capitals in his 
signature – so don’t call him “ee cummings”

Cup, FA
after first mention it is the Cup; but other cups are lc on second mention

cupful
The plural is cupfuls, as with spoonfuls, but it’s three cups full, three 
spoons full

curate’s egg
Used nowadays to mean good in parts (“this was a curate’s egg of a match”), 
the expression originally, and more subtly, meant to deliberately gloss over 
the truth – the curate was trying to spare his bishop’s feelings, or perhaps 
his own embarrassment, when served a bad egg, by saying: “Oh no, My Lord, I 
assure you! Parts of it are excellent!” (cartoon in Punch, 9 November 1895)

curb
restrain; kerb pavement

currencies
When the whole word is used it is lc: euro, pound, sterling, dong, etc. 
Abbreviate dollars like this: $50 (US dollars); A$50 (Australian dollars); 
HK$50 (Hong Kong dollars).

Convert all foreign amounts to sterling in brackets at first mention, but use 
common sense – there is no need to put £500,000 in brackets after the phrase “I 
feel like a million dollars.”

Take care when converting old money to new: some of our attempts have been 
meaningless, in that they have ignored the relative value of sums involved. We 
said in an obituary, for example, that Ronnie Barker was paid £1 9s (£1.45) a 
week for his first job in 1947 – a comparison of average earnings would convert 
that to around £113 today.

Similarly, in converting the price of a “four shilling dish of rice and 
vegetables” in 1967 to 20p in today’s money we forgot to allow for its relative 
value; taking into account changes in the retail price index it would now be 
worth £2.23.

There are some excellent websites to assist with such conversions

currently
“now” is usually preferable, if needed at all

cusp
a place where two points meet (eg “on the cusp of Manchester and Salford”, “on 
the cusp of Taurus and Gemini”), which may be extended metaphorically to a 
place or time where two things or groups of things come into contact, as in 
this elegant example from the Review: “It was a world caught on the cusp 
between postwar recession, stasis and a dying moral code, and the colour, 
mobility and licence of the 60s.”

Writers who use cusp under the impression that it is a clever way to say on 
the brink of or about to (“on the cusp of adolescence”, “on the cusp of the 
final”, “tanker drivers are on the cusp of striking over a coming 
supermarket-led cut in their wages”, “the garlic was on the cusp of bursting 
into a constellation of white stars”) are, sadly, mistaken

custody
since the 1989 Children Act the correct term for what used to be known as 
custody in cases involving care of children is residence

Customs, Revenue & Customs

cutbacks
avoid; cuts will suffice

in the trial of a footballer accused of calling a rival player a “black cunt”)

Cyprus
Cyprus, properly known as the Republic of Cyprus, joined the EU in 2004, 30 
years after Turkey invaded the northern part of the island, which should be 
referred to as “Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus” (the self-styled “Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus” is recognised only by Turkey)
