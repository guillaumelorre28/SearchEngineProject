'Jeremy Corbyn is not going to be the next prime minister'

John Harris

The Labour Party will not win the next general election, but that isn’t the 
right way of looking at the problem. Labour is in the midst of the same crisis 
as its sister social-democratic parties across Europe, with one twist: as 
evidenced by all those new members, it is also home to the kind of new, 
insurgent politics we’ve seen with Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, the 
Bernie Sanders campaign in the US etc. Time spent this week at Momentum’s A 
World Transformed event in Liverpool reminded me that a great deal ofLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> and the left’s future lies with 
some of the people involved (I’ve written a column about this, out later 
today), but a watershed moment is probably going to be a long time coming.

As things stand, most of what we know takes the form of negatives: that the 
politics of New Labour are dead, that Labour is dangerously estranged from its 
old working class base, that the party is pretty much finished in Scotland. 
What happens next is unclear: my own belief is that it will have involve Labour 
embracing changing the voting system, creating a politics beyond work and the 
worker, and understanding that amassing a critical mass of support will involve 
other forces and parties. All this will take time.

For now, maybe think about it like this. Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> is not going to be the 
next prime minister. In an alternate reality, the same would apply to Owen 
Smith, Angela Eagle, David Miliband, Yvette Cooper, or any one else who might 
be mentioned as some kind of fantasy contender. It is time we all got our heads 
around the politics of the long haul, which entails thought, patience - and an 
ability to think beyond five-year electoral cycles.

'The future of British politics is coalitions'

James Walsh

Can Labour win without electoral reform? Certain prominent Labour MPs have 
been convinced of the merits of proportional representation, and Chris, a 
reader from Exeter, thinks Labour needs to be thinking in terms ofa progressive 
alliance. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/26/caroline-lucas-labour-jeremy-corbyn-progressive-alliance-green-party>


The future of British politics is coalitions and he can lead a combination of 
Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> / Lib Dem and Greens with 
support from SNP. He can reach out to those who are outside the current voting 
patterns and disenfranchised - which is a far greater number is the vote for 16 
year olds can be passed.


What really needs to change is our voting system so it takes account of 
proportional representation. A system where a government is formed out of 40% 
choice is not representative and also unfair to smaller parties

I think there is hope. Corbyn’s conference speech was an attempt to reach out 
to his critics

Abi Wilkinson

Looking at the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party in 
its current state – confused, conflict-ridden and in desperate need of coherent 
strategy – it would be easy to assume that electoral success is off the cards 
for the foreseeable future. Certainly, current polling suggests the party is on 
track to lose dozens of seats unless something changes.

It’s fairly widely accepted that Labour is in need of some new ideas for the 
21st century. Encouragingly, these issues do seem to be being discussed. The 
Momentum conference fringe event was buzzing with energy and many speakers were 
tackling difficult topics such as automation and the possibility of a citizens 
income. Many politicians are also keen to explore similar themes, Jonathan 
Reynolds MP immediately springs to mind.

The question is: how can this sort of radical thinking be combined with 
in-depth understanding of voter preferences and electoral strategy to come up 
with a plausible program for government?

I think there is hope. Corbyn’s conference speech was an attempt to reach out 
to his critics within Labour and many some to have responded in kind. There 
seems to be a growing awareness that different factions need to work together 
for the good of the party and the people it represents.

How will the triggering of article 50 affect Labour’s chances? If Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> are to benefit from Conservative 
turmoil over Europe, what line should the party take on negotiations? Jamie, 
37, from Sheffield, sees opportunities:


Corbyn undoubtedly needs to reach out to the political centre. But we should 
not underestimate the trouble brewing for the Tories. This is Theresa May’s 
honeymoon period but already the cracks are beginning to show. Brexit, 
specifically the failure to trigger article 50, is a time bomb waiting to go 
off for the Conservative party. With a slim majority, a Eurosceptic rebellion 
could see off this government at any moment.
A Labour majority is difficult to imagine. But a coalition with Labour as the 
largest party? Entirely achievable.

A more optimistic view from a commenter, who believes the terms of the debate 
- particularly on austerity - have shifted to the extent that Labour’s only 
viable future is one where it tacks to the left.

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4647441> queequeg7  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4647441> 29 September 2016 1:24pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84291250> 
Before Corbyn, Labour is going the way of PASOK in Greece - a pro-austerity 
embarrassment of a Party surviving on the remembered fumes of the Trade Union 
movement. Since Corbyn became Labour the membership has doubled and the Party 
has shifted the debate inexorably to the Left. Austerity, as a proclaimed 
intent, is finished. Not even the Tories can promote themselves as the Party of 
inequality and free enterprise. Of course, it'll take time for the ideas which 
have reclaimed the Labour Party to percolate outwards, and it won't be a smooth 
transition as the Right doing everything in their power to stopLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>, but it's a start of something 
better.

'We need to change the narrative on the economy'

James Walsh

Readers responding to our form have been making the point that until Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> moves public opinion on key 
narratives, it’s going to be very difficult for them to make electoral headway. 
How can the party develop a reputation for economic competence when many voters 
still blame them for the 2008 economic crash?

Here’s the view of Martin, a registered Labour supporter in Sheffield:


The SNP have shown that the country is ready to elect an anti-austerity 
government. A government that actually provides excellent public services will 
find a public willing to bear the cost up to point.


There is a lot that needs to go their way - but I still feel that the main 
challenge is to change the narrative on the economy. Until we can change the 
narrative that investment can be positive for the economy, or that cuts aren’t 
effective in dealing with debt it will be difficult to get anywhere with 
undecided voters.

Corbyn is great at preaching to the converted, but that won't help win 
elections

Sarah Marsh

This is an interesting comment – making points about the fact that Jeremy 
Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> spent his career on 
backbenches. What do you think? Is he not very good at preaching to the 
non-converted? Or is he a man of the people?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4619109> pinkerp  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4619109> 29 September 2016 12:54pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84288698> 
No one would think of appointing a CEO of a major company who had no 
experience at a relatively senior management level, yet this is what theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> Party has done with Jeremy Corbyn 
– and Leader of the Opposition is at least as demanding a role as leading a 
global corporation in terms of the organisational and negotiating skills, 
strategic vision, stamina, drive, pragmatism and media savviness required.

Corbyn looks like what he is – someone who has spent his entire career on the 
backbenches, free to follow his own principles and unaccustomed with the burden 
of having to make compromises and prioritise. And who is now out of his depth.

The Corbyn camp continues to do its best to paint the situation as a battle 
for the soul of the Labour Party, but the truth is much more prosaic. How many 
widespread MP rebellions have there been on policy issues? Have there been any? 
Instead the disquiet comes from Corbyn's perceived lack of leadership skills – 
that he has no coherent media policy, that shadow cabinet meetings are a 
shambles, that communication within the party is poor, that he lacks drive, 
that no one is really clear what they're supposed to be doing, and, worst of 
all, that there is a lack of solid, well-thought-through policy.

Corbyn is great at preaching to the converted, but the converted aren't enough 
to win a general election. The only way I can see it working is if he displays 
a bit of humility and accepts advice, help and direction from others in the 
party outside of his narrow circle, especially those with ministerial, 
leadership and media experience. But for all the talk of him being a 'man of 
the people', it's not clear that humility is one of his natural characteristics.

A commenter below the line makes the reasonable point that it’s all far too 
early to tell. Given the upheavals seen in domestic and international politics 
over the past few years, predicting the 2020 election is very difficult - 
particularly with the full effects of Brexit still to come.

The next election is most likely three and a half years away during which time 
we will experience the unprecedented upheaval of leaving the EU. There is also 
issues around boundary changes, scottish independence, the relevance of UKIP, 
whether labour can resolve their internal issues and divisions within the tory 
government. So on that basis nobody can say that Labour are not going to win 
the next election.
In the run up to the 2010 election the tories managed to paint the 2008 crash 
as caused by Labour and argued they were not economically responsible, yet 
could not win outright power. And against Gordon Brown of all people.
During the 2015 election campaign the tories maintained the argument, cast Ed 
Miliband as the son of Britain hater, glorified their own work on the economy 
since 2010, scapegoated the Lib Dems and saw the SNP all but obliterateLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> in Scotland, yet only managed a 
17 seat majority.
Who wins the next election is pure guesswork, mine is that nobody wins 
outright.

What can Labour do to win… one reader's view

Possible path to victory. 
1. An electoral pact. The right win because they always vote together as one 
big monolith. Our turn. The scare of a small handful of Tories going over to 
UKIP was enough to panic Cameron into a Brexit referendum. I'm in a supposed 
Tory safe seat but the truth is that if you counted the Lib Dem and Labour vote 
together, we would comfortably win. That's repeated up and down the country. An 
electoral pact means not standing candidates against the most likely to win. It 
also means people can vote strategically yet maintain allegiance with the party 
of their conscience.
2. Stand a Labour candidate in Northern Ireland to recover ground lost in 
Scotland
3. Try and win over the 40% of non-voters.
4. As far as immigration is concerned, it really isn't rocket science. Saying 
Labour will build 60k new council homes a year is great but it is also 
arbitrary.Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> should go a bit 
further and say "we will institute whatever policy is necessary and build 
however many homes are required to make sure that house and rent prices don't 
outstrip wages, and if we can't achieve that, we'll look to reduce immigration"

One repeated criticism of Corbyn’s electoral strategy is that he doesn’t do 
enough to reach out to the centre: the kind of voters with no fixed political 
allegiance, the kind of voted for Blair in 1997 but were more convinced by 
David Cameron in 2015.

One ready, a 46 year old Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
member from Brighton, got in touch to say there’s another way of winning: by 
reaching out to those who don’t currently vote.


At the moment more that 35% of the eligible voters in the UK don’t vote. This 
is equal to or more than the number of eligible voters that voted Tories to win 
the last election. Most of these people are mostly not taken into account by 
pollsters. In my view, Corbyn is connecting with this group of eligible voters. 
If he can bring them into play in a large number, together with the traditional 
labour voters that remain loyal to the party, he has a credible path to victory.

What can Corbyn do to change doubter's minds?

Guardian readers

An interesting comment from a reader below the line who suggests Corbyn does 
something to surprise voters.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11399875> crashball123  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11399875> 29 September 2016 12:23pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84285896> 
For Corbyn to win he will need to do something big to convince enough Tories, 
Liberals and swing voters to vote for him - that's just the mathematical 
reality. It will be painful for him and his loyal membership perhaps, but he'll 
need to have at least one or two proposals that make this voting group sit up 
and say 'wow, I wouldn't have expected him to say that!', it's called cognitive 
dissonance and is used in advertising to cut through a crowded market place and 
change brand perceptions.

New Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> understood this; the 
end of Clause 4, being relaxed about the filthy rich, keeping to Tory spending 
plans for two years, and making the BoE independent all raised hell in the 
party, but were highly effective in changing damaging perceptions very quickly 
and forced the wider electorate to reconsider the brand. There is a downside of 
course; he will get slated by many on his own side and that hurts, but he has 
their votes already, he needs to hold his nose and put forward policies that 
appeal directly to the voters of his opposition.

'Corbynism makes too much of its principles, too little of practical politics'

Michael White

In a year when Donald Trump’s campaign for the White House has moved from ugly 
fantasy to likely outcome it would take a very rash old political hack to say 
without reservation: “Labour cannot win a general election withJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> as its leader.”

That’s what I think, of course. I do so on the basis of 40 years watching 
mainstream British politics from a ringside seat inside what my Twitter 
detractors routinely call the “Westminster bubble” - as if Momentum activists 
or Ukip Brexiteers don’t live in a tiny confirmation biased bubble of their own.

But I won’t say it categorically here out of respect for the thousands of 
decent people who have joinedLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> because they like what Jeremy 
says and how he says it; also because I know his party opponents have got a lot 
wrong in the recent past. They deserve what so many of them demand: hope, but 
not zeal.

Yet Corbynism makes too much of its principles, too little of the practical 
politics they so despised in Blair and Brown. This week’s speeches have been 
strong on “should,” pretty hopeless on “how.” Try as they may to be “21st 
century” their version of left populism soundsvery old fashioned: more like 
unpopulism, not just on immigration either.

Forget familiar clichés about a snap election in 2017. 2020 allows dangerously 
little time in which Corbyn’s Marxist minders can be persuaded to forge 
realistic compromises with the electorate. There is a voter market for leftwing 
statist economics and selective pacifism with a dash of vegetarian teetotalism 
thrown in. It could be as high as 20%. Think about it.

We’ve been hearing from Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
members on whether they think the party can turn around its electoral fortunes 
- keep the views coming, though we’re happy to hear from non-Labour members 
too. What would it take for you to vote for the party under Corbyn, and what 
put you off voting for them in 2015?


On opinion, we hear from a Labour member who vows to be more engaged in 
communicating the party message.


Our engagement isn’t just about reassuring the Labour faithful. The polls are 
a stark reminder of just how much work there is to do. We must turn the party 
into a movement that can be radical, and can win. As Corbyn said in his speech 
at conference, this wave of new members is in fact a “vast democratic resource” 
– not, as some people see it, a threat.

New Labour members like me need to do more - it’s time to get involved

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gave his keynote speech to conference on 
Wednesday, relaunching his stewardship of the partyby outlining his agenda for 
the country under a Labour government. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/corbyn-urges-labour-mps-to-end-trench-warfare-and-back-socialist-vision-for-uk>

Responding to critics who accuse Corbyn of being more interested in 
campaigning than the more complicated and compromise-strewn business of winning 
general elections, Corbyn said:

“Most of all it’s about winning power in local and national government to 
deliver the real change our country so desperately needs.”

He did also acknowledge that Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> has an “electoral mountain to 
climb”, but called for the party to unite and take the fight to Theresa May’s 
Conservatives.

Does Corbyn have a reasonable chance of becoming our next prime minister? 
Certainly,the polls are against him 
<https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/09/23/labours-losing-leave-voters/> - though, 
of course, polls have been wrong before. The party still facing splits over 
policies ranging from how to respond to the Brexit vote, Trident renewal, and 
how to frame the party’s migration policy.


But in a year that has seen the hugely unexpected vote for Brexit, it would be 
unwise to rule out the unexpected. Gathering strength during an often bitterly 
fought leadership campaign, Labour under Corbyn has increase its membership base
to over half a million people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/jeremy-corbyn-stands-defiant-after-labour-membership-surge>
.


Can the parliamentary party and its new, extended member base overcome their 
differences and form a new and powerful political force? Or is the task too 
difficult, particularly given the party’s dire electoral situation in Scotland 
and impending boundary changes?

Most importantly of all, can the party win the next election?

close  
We’re going to close comments shortly - thanks for taking part in the debate 
today. We’ll have another one next Thursday lunchtime.

 
The Labour Party will not win the next general election, but that isn’t the 
right way of looking at the problem. Labour is in the midst of the same crisis 
as its sister social-democratic parties across Europe, with one twist: as 
evidenced by all those new members, it is also home to the kind of new, 
insurgent politics we’ve seen with Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, the 
Bernie Sanders campaign in the US etc. Time spent this week at Momentum’s A 
World Transformed event in Liverpool reminded me that a great deal ofLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> and the left’s future lies with 
some of the people involved (I’ve written a column about this, out later 
today), but a watershed moment is probably going to be a long time coming.

As things stand, most of what we know takes the form of negatives: that the 
politics of New Labour are dead, that Labour is dangerously estranged from its 
old working class base, that the party is pretty much finished in Scotland. 
What happens next is unclear: my own belief is that it will have involve Labour 
embracing changing the voting system, creating a politics beyond work and the 
worker, and understanding that amassing a critical mass of support will involve 
other forces and parties. All this will take time.

For now, maybe think about it like this. Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> is not going to be the 
next prime minister. In an alternate reality, the same would apply to Owen 
Smith, Angela Eagle, David Miliband, Yvette Cooper, or any one else who might 
be mentioned as some kind of fantasy contender. It is time we all got our heads 
around the politics of the long haul, which entails thought, patience - and an 
ability to think beyond five-year electoral cycles.
 
Can Labour win without electoral reform? Certain prominent Labour MPs have 
been convinced of the merits of proportional representation, and Chris, a 
reader from Exeter, thinks Labour needs to be thinking in terms ofa progressive 
alliance. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/26/caroline-lucas-labour-jeremy-corbyn-progressive-alliance-green-party>


The future of British politics is coalitions and he can lead a combination of 
Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> / Lib Dem and Greens with 
support from SNP. He can reach out to those who are outside the current voting 
patterns and disenfranchised - which is a far greater number is the vote for 16 
year olds can be passed.


What really needs to change is our voting system so it takes account of 
proportional representation. A system where a government is formed out of 40% 
choice is not representative and also unfair to smaller parties

 
Thanks everyone, we now have 10 minutes left to discuss. Please get any final 
points in while you can.
 
Looking at the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party in 
its current state – confused, conflict-ridden and in desperate need of coherent 
strategy – it would be easy to assume that electoral success is off the cards 
for the foreseeable future. Certainly, current polling suggests the party is on 
track to lose dozens of seats unless something changes.

It’s fairly widely accepted that Labour is in need of some new ideas for the 
21st century. Encouragingly, these issues do seem to be being discussed. The 
Momentum conference fringe event was buzzing with energy and many speakers were 
tackling difficult topics such as automation and the possibility of a citizens 
income. Many politicians are also keen to explore similar themes, Jonathan 
Reynolds MP immediately springs to mind.

The question is: how can this sort of radical thinking be combined with 
in-depth understanding of voter preferences and electoral strategy to come up 
with a plausible program for government?

I think there is hope. Corbyn’s conference speech was an attempt to reach out 
to his critics within Labour and many some to have responded in kind. There 
seems to be a growing awareness that different factions need to work together 
for the good of the party and the people it represents.

 
How will the triggering of article 50 affect Labour’s chances? If Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> are to benefit from Conservative 
turmoil over Europe, what line should the party take on negotiations? Jamie, 
37, from Sheffield, sees opportunities:


Corbyn undoubtedly needs to reach out to the political centre. But we should 
not underestimate the trouble brewing for the Tories. This is Theresa May’s 
honeymoon period but already the cracks are beginning to show. Brexit, 
specifically the failure to trigger article 50, is a time bomb waiting to go 
off for the Conservative party. With a slim majority, a Eurosceptic rebellion 
could see off this government at any moment.
A Labour majority is difficult to imagine. But a coalition with Labour as the 
largest party? Entirely achievable.

 
A more optimistic view from a commenter, who believes the terms of the debate 
- particularly on austerity - have shifted to the extent that Labour’s only 
viable future is one where it tacks to the left.

Before Corbyn, Labour is going the way of PASOK in Greece - a pro-austerity 
embarrassment of a Party surviving on the remembered fumes of the Trade Union 
movement. Since Corbyn became Labour the membership has doubled and the Party 
has shifted the debate inexorably to the Left. Austerity, as a proclaimed 
intent, is finished. Not even the Tories can promote themselves as the Party of 
inequality and free enterprise. Of course, it'll take time for the ideas which 
have reclaimed the Labour Party to percolate outwards, and it won't be a smooth 
transition as the Right doing everything in their power to stopLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>, but it's a start of something 
better.
 
Readers responding to our form have been making the point that until Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> moves public opinion on key 
narratives, it’s going to be very difficult for them to make electoral headway. 
How can the party develop a reputation for economic competence when many voters 
still blame them for the 2008 economic crash?

Here’s the view of Martin, a registered Labour supporter in Sheffield:


The SNP have shown that the country is ready to elect an anti-austerity 
government. A government that actually provides excellent public services will 
find a public willing to bear the cost up to point.


There is a lot that needs to go their way - but I still feel that the main 
challenge is to change the narrative on the economy. Until we can change the 
narrative that investment can be positive for the economy, or that cuts aren’t 
effective in dealing with debt it will be difficult to get anywhere with 
undecided voters.

 
This is an interesting comment – making points about the fact that Jeremy 
Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> spent his career on 
backbenches. What do you think? Is he not very good at preaching to the 
non-converted? Or is he a man of the people?

No one would think of appointing a CEO of a major company who had no 
experience at a relatively senior management level, yet this is what theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> Party has done with Jeremy Corbyn 
– and Leader of the Opposition is at least as demanding a role as leading a 
global corporation in terms of the organisational and negotiating skills, 
strategic vision, stamina, drive, pragmatism and media savviness required.

Corbyn looks like what he is – someone who has spent his entire career on the 
backbenches, free to follow his own principles and unaccustomed with the burden 
of having to make compromises and prioritise. And who is now out of his depth.

The Corbyn camp continues to do its best to paint the situation as a battle 
for the soul of the Labour Party, but the truth is much more prosaic. How many 
widespread MP rebellions have there been on policy issues? Have there been any? 
Instead the disquiet comes from Corbyn's perceived lack of leadership skills – 
that he has no coherent media policy, that shadow cabinet meetings are a 
shambles, that communication within the party is poor, that he lacks drive, 
that no one is really clear what they're supposed to be doing, and, worst of 
all, that there is a lack of solid, well-thought-through policy.

Corbyn is great at preaching to the converted, but the converted aren't enough 
to win a general election. The only way I can see it working is if he displays 
a bit of humility and accepts advice, help and direction from others in the 
party outside of his narrow circle, especially those with ministerial, 
leadership and media experience. But for all the talk of him being a 'man of 
the people', it's not clear that humility is one of his natural characteristics.
 
We’re trying out a new poll tool. Let us know what you think in the comments - 
and don’t forget to vote!

 
A commenter below the line makes the reasonable point that it’s all far too 
early to tell. Given the upheavals seen in domestic and international politics 
over the past few years, predicting the 2020 election is very difficult - 
particularly with the full effects of Brexit still to come.

The next election is most likely three and a half years away during which time 
we will experience the unprecedented upheaval of leaving the EU. There is also 
issues around boundary changes, scottish independence, the relevance of UKIP, 
whether labour can resolve their internal issues and divisions within the tory 
government. So on that basis nobody can say that Labour are not going to win 
the next election.
In the run up to the 2010 election the tories managed to paint the 2008 crash 
as caused by Labour and argued they were not economically responsible, yet 
could not win outright power. And against Gordon Brown of all people.
During the 2015 election campaign the tories maintained the argument, cast Ed 
Miliband as the son of Britain hater, glorified their own work on the economy 
since 2010, scapegoated the Lib Dems and saw the SNP all but obliterateLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> in Scotland, yet only managed a 
17 seat majority.
Who wins the next election is pure guesswork, mine is that nobody wins 
outright.

Possible path to victory. 
1. An electoral pact. The right win because they always vote together as one 
big monolith. Our turn. The scare of a small handful of Tories going over to 
UKIP was enough to panic Cameron into a Brexit referendum. I'm in a supposed 
Tory safe seat but the truth is that if you counted the Lib Dem and Labour vote 
together, we would comfortably win. That's repeated up and down the country. An 
electoral pact means not standing candidates against the most likely to win. It 
also means people can vote strategically yet maintain allegiance with the party 
of their conscience.
2. Stand a Labour candidate in Northern Ireland to recover ground lost in 
Scotland
3. Try and win over the 40% of non-voters.
4. As far as immigration is concerned, it really isn't rocket science. Saying 
Labour will build 60k new council homes a year is great but it is also 
arbitrary.Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> should go a bit 
further and say "we will institute whatever policy is necessary and build 
however many homes are required to make sure that house and rent prices don't 
outstrip wages, and if we can't achieve that, we'll look to reduce immigration"
 
One repeated criticism of Corbyn’s electoral strategy is that he doesn’t do 
enough to reach out to the centre: the kind of voters with no fixed political 
allegiance, the kind of voted for Blair in 1997 but were more convinced by 
David Cameron in 2015.

One ready, a 46 year old Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
member from Brighton, got in touch to say there’s another way of winning: by 
reaching out to those who don’t currently vote.


At the moment more that 35% of the eligible voters in the UK don’t vote. This 
is equal to or more than the number of eligible voters that voted Tories to win 
the last election. Most of these people are mostly not taken into account by 
pollsters. In my view, Corbyn is connecting with this group of eligible voters. 
If he can bring them into play in a large number, together with the traditional 
labour voters that remain loyal to the party, he has a credible path to victory.

 
An interesting comment from a reader below the line who suggests Corbyn does 
something to surprise voters.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11399875> crashball123

For Corbyn to win he will need to do something big to convince enough Tories, 
Liberals and swing voters to vote for him - that's just the mathematical 
reality. It will be painful for him and his loyal membership perhaps, but he'll 
need to have at least one or two proposals that make this voting group sit up 
and say 'wow, I wouldn't have expected him to say that!', it's called cognitive 
dissonance and is used in advertising to cut through a crowded market place and 
change brand perceptions.

New Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> understood this; the 
end of Clause 4, being relaxed about the filthy rich, keeping to Tory spending 
plans for two years, and making the BoE independent all raised hell in the 
party, but were highly effective in changing damaging perceptions very quickly 
and forced the wider electorate to reconsider the brand. There is a downside of 
course; he will get slated by many on his own side and that hurts, but he has 
their votes already, he needs to hold his nose and put forward policies that 
appeal directly to the voters of his opposition.
 
In a year when Donald Trump’s campaign for the White House has moved from ugly 
fantasy to likely outcome it would take a very rash old political hack to say 
without reservation: “Labour cannot win a general election withJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> as its leader.”

That’s what I think, of course. I do so on the basis of 40 years watching 
mainstream British politics from a ringside seat inside what my Twitter 
detractors routinely call the “Westminster bubble” - as if Momentum activists 
or Ukip Brexiteers don’t live in a tiny confirmation biased bubble of their own.

But I won’t say it categorically here out of respect for the thousands of 
decent people who have joinedLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> because they like what Jeremy 
says and how he says it; also because I know his party opponents have got a lot 
wrong in the recent past. They deserve what so many of them demand: hope, but 
not zeal.

Yet Corbynism makes too much of its principles, too little of the practical 
politics they so despised in Blair and Brown. This week’s speeches have been 
strong on “should,” pretty hopeless on “how.” Try as they may to be “21st 
century” their version of left populism soundsvery old fashioned: more like 
unpopulism, not just on immigration either.

Forget familiar clichés about a snap election in 2017. 2020 allows dangerously 
little time in which Corbyn’s Marxist minders can be persuaded to forge 
realistic compromises with the electorate. There is a voter market for leftwing 
statist economics and selective pacifism with a dash of vegetarian teetotalism 
thrown in. It could be as high as 20%. Think about it.

We’ve been hearing from Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
members on whether they think the party can turn around its electoral fortunes 
- keep the views coming, though we’re happy to hear from non-Labour members 
too. What would it take for you to vote for the party under Corbyn, and what 
put you off voting for them in 2015?


On opinion, we hear from a Labour member who vows to be more engaged in 
communicating the party message.


Our engagement isn’t just about reassuring the Labour faithful. The polls are 
a stark reminder of just how much work there is to do. We must turn the party 
into a movement that can be radical, and can win. As Corbyn said in his speech 
at conference, this wave of new members is in fact a “vast democratic resource” 
– not, as some people see it, a threat.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gave his keynote speech to conference on 
Wednesday, relaunching his stewardship of the partyby outlining his agenda for 
the country under a Labour government. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/corbyn-urges-labour-mps-to-end-trench-warfare-and-back-socialist-vision-for-uk>

Responding to critics who accuse Corbyn of being more interested in 
campaigning than the more complicated and compromise-strewn business of winning 
general elections, Corbyn said:

“Most of all it’s about winning power in local and national government to 
deliver the real change our country so desperately needs.”

He did also acknowledge that Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> has an “electoral mountain to 
climb”, but called for the party to unite and take the fight to Theresa May’s 
Conservatives.

Does Corbyn have a reasonable chance of becoming our next prime minister? 
Certainly,the polls are against him 
<https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/09/23/labours-losing-leave-voters/> - though, 
of course, polls have been wrong before. The party still facing splits over 
policies ranging from how to respond to the Brexit vote, Trident renewal, and 
how to frame the party’s migration policy.


But in a year that has seen the hugely unexpected vote for Brexit, it would be 
unwise to rule out the unexpected. Gathering strength during an often bitterly 
fought leadership campaign, Labour under Corbyn has increase its membership base
to over half a million people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/jeremy-corbyn-stands-defiant-after-labour-membership-surge>
.


Can the parliamentary party and its new, extended member base overcome their 
differences and form a new and powerful political force? Or is the task too 
difficult, particularly given the party’s dire electoral situation in Scotland 
and impending boundary changes?

Most importantly of all, can the party win the next election?
