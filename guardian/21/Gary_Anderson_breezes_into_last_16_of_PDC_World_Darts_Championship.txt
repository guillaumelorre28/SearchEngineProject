The defending champion, Gary Anderson, eased into the last 16 of the World 
Darts <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/darts> Championship with a convincing 
4-0 win over Andrew Gilding at Alexandra Palace.

The 46-year-old second seed, who has won the competition for the past two 
years, never looked in danger of an early exit as he won each set 3-1 to secure 
a quick passage to the next round.

Last yearâ€™s runner-up, Adrian Lewis, champion in 2011 and 2012, joins Anderson 
in progressing after he saw off Joe Cullen. The fifth seed began in blistering 
fashion and ended with an average of just under 103 as he also secured a 4-0 
whitewash.

The 11th seed, Michael Smith, survived a scare as he fought back from 
surrendering a two-set lead to scrape a thrilling 4-3 victory over Mervyn King. 
The 26-year-old, who produced 14 maximums, was cruising at 3-1 but wasted five 
darts for the match before finally seeing off King 4-2 in the deciding set.

Benito van de Pas also came through a tense seven-leg match to beat Terry 
Jenkins 4-3 while Darren Webster averaged 104 as he produced a stunning 
performance to demolish the 17th seed, Simon Whitlock, 4-0.

Ian White was the first man through to the last 16 after he comfortably beat 
Jonny Clayton 4-1 in the opening match of the day.
