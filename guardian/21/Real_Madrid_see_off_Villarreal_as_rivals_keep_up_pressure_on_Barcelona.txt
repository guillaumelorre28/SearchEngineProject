Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> registered wins on 
Thursday night, meaning Barcelona – who dismantled Deportivo La Coruña 8-0 at 
Estadio Riazor – stay ahead of Atlético by virtue of their superior 
head-to-head record and Real by one point.

Atlético overcame Athletic Bilbao 1-0 as Fernando Torres continued his recent 
resurgence with his fifth goal in as many matches. Torres wassent off against 
Barcelona

 in the Champions League earlier this month but he has since scored in league 
games against Espanyol, Granada and now Bilbao, the Spaniard’s 38th-minute 
header proving the difference at the San Mames Stadium.

Real kicked off later than both their title rivals but Zinedine Zidane’s side 
showed no signs of feeling the pressure as they strolled to a 3-0 home win over
Villarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal>.

Karim Benzema broke the deadlock with a header, heading home after Sergio 
Asenjo parried Cristiano Ronaldo’s cross, before Lucas Vázquez and Luka Modric 
added two quick goals in the second half.

The only concern on an otherwise straightforward night for Real was the sight 
of Ronaldo walking off the pitch clutching his hamstring late on.

Zidane can ill-afford to lose the Portugese star, with a trip to Rayo 
Vallecano to come on Saturday before their Champions League semi-final first 
leg at Manchester City next week.
