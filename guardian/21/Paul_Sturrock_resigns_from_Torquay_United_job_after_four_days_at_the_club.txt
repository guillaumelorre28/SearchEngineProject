Paul Sturrock has left his job at the Conference club Torquay United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torquay-united> after just four days, 
having been offered a permanent position elsewhere.

Sturrock, the 58-year-old former Plymouth manager, was hired on 5 April to 
work alongside manager Chris Hargreaves in an advisory role – with Hargreaves 
welcoming the appointment: “The process of planning for the future has to begin 
now … The summer is our chance to reflect, refresh and rebuild.”

However, Sturrock chose not to stay after being offered another position at an 
unnamed club, reportedly Yeovil Town. Torquay’s vice-chairman, Bill Phillips,
said in a statement 
<http://www.torquayunited.com/news/article/sturrock-offered-another-job-2383982.aspx>
: “I am very disappointed but we wish Paul the very best of luck in his new job.

“We still believe in the principle of someone to work with Chris and to 
provide an additional sounding board for ideas, both tactically and in terms of 
recruitment. I also genuinely believe Chris endorses that view.

“Paul Sturrock fitted the bill because he lives locally but I wish him well in 
his new job. Events can take over the best-laid plans but we have to find 
someone comparable with Paul.

“The principle is there and now it’s finding the right person. The basis of 
the idea is to do everything we can to help Chris achieve great success as the 
manager of Torquay United.”

Sturrock’s four-day stay at the club does not represent the fastest ever exit 
at Plainmoor, however, with Leroy Roseniorlasting just 10 minutes

manager in 2007.
