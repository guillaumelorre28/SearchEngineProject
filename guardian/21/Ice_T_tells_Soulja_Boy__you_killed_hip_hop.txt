Critics, grandfathers and little boys 
<http://music.theguardian.com/news/story/0,,2267993,00.html> aren't the only 
ones who hate US rapper Soulja Boy. Hip-hop royalty has now entered the fray, 
and Ice T is spitting mad.

"Fuck Soulja Boy <https://www.theguardian.com/music/soulja-boy>," declares Ice 
T on the Black Ice Urban Legends mixtape, released this week by DJ Cisco. 
"Soulja Boy, I know you're young enough to be my kid but you single-handedly 
killed hip-hop, man."

Ice T, born Tracy Lauren Marrow, is famous not just as the star of Law & 
Order: Special Victims Unit, but for writing some of the hardest, meanest lines 
of the gangsta-rap era. Soulja Boy, meanwhile, is a MySpace-fuelled phenomenon 
whose catchy Superman song (and Soulja Boy dance) has taken over many 
middle-school gymnasia.

And Ice T's not happy about it.

"That shit is such garbage," he says on Black Ice Urban Legends. "We came all 
the way from [iconic rapper] Rakim, we came all the way from Das EFX, we came 
all the way from motherfuckers flowing like Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube, and 
you come with that Superman shit?"

Nor will Ice T refrain from just insulting Soulja Boy's music. He's also got 
some words for the Soulja haircut. "Take them fucking beads out your fucking 
hair, kid," he says, as if at wits' end. "You niggas are making me feel really 
fucking bad about this shit. Fix bikes or somethin'."

If Soulja Boy's reading, our chain came off last night.
