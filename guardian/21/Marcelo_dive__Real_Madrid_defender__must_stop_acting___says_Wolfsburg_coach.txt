Wolfsburg stunned Real Madrid with two goals in seven first-half minutes to 
take control of theirChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> quarter-final, leaving 
Real, 10-time winners of the competition, facing an uphill task to progress to 
the last four.

Much of the talk afterwards, though, focused on the Madrid defender Marcelo. 
In the 70th minute, he was seen to kick out at the Wolfsburg scorer Maximilian 
Arnold, beforeheadbutting him in the chest then collapsing

Zidane: Real Madrid must stay calm after 2-0 defeat at Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/apr/07/zidane-real-madrid-must-stay-calm-after-2-0-defeat-wolfsburg-video>
“Marcelo is an actor. I have told him to stop his acting”, the Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> manager, Dieter Hecking, told 
the German media. “It doesn’t belong here and it’s unsportsmanlike.”

Arnold, who scored the goal that made it 2-0 in the 25th minute, was shown a 
yellow card by the referee Gianluca Rocchi, but seemed calm afterwards.

“I just told him that I would have liked to have hair as beautiful hair as 
his”, the 21-year-old told Sky.
