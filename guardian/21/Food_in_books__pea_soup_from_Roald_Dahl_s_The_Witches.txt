‘Today there is green-pea soup to start with, and for the main course you have 
a choice of either grilled fillet of sole or roast lamb.’

The next moment, one of the cooks came along with a gigantic saucepan of 
steaming green soup and poured the whole lot into the silver basin. He put the 
lid on the basin and shouted, ‘Soup for the big party all ready to go out!’


The Witches <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witches_(novel)>, Roald Dahl

---

Roald Dahl has been on my mind lately. Perhaps it was this glorious piece by 
Sophie Dahl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/13/my-grandfather-cast-a-spell-over-my-childhood>
, or the fact that, in recognition of his centenary last week, my nannying 
charges came home with Dahl-themed homework. Or maybe it’s the change of 
season; at this time of year my thoughts always turn to Danny, the Champion of 
the World, to game, roasts and scrumping. Whatever the reason, you have another 
Dahl recipe this week, and an old favourite.

Though none of his other books mean as much to me as Matilda and Danny, I do 
have particularly vivid memories of The Witches. I was young when I read it, 
and it terrified me. I have always been a proper scaredy-cat, wide awake at 
night because of something I’ve seen, or heard, or imagined. I feigned illness 
at a sleepover when I was 14, when the girls from school decided we were going 
to watch Sleepy Hollow. I stopped drinking water before bed for weeks after 
watching The Sixth Sense, terrified that I would encounter ghosts if I had to 
find my way to the toilet on my own. A ghost story told by a family friend 
about a woman and her cat, bricked up behind a wall in an old house, featured 
in my nightmares for months. And The Witches stayed with me for years. Women 
who wore gloves on hot days, or walked awkwardly in pointy-toed shoes, were 
given a generous berth. And I have never stopped thinking about the girl who 
disappeared into the painting.

My mum’s is the best pea soup in the world, made with the ham bone we have 
left over every Christmas, and frozen in batches until autumn hits. It is a 
rich, unctuous split pea soup, the kind that coats the roof of your mouth and 
warms you from the inside out. It has scraps of ham stirred through it and is 
reassuringly beige in colour. But it is a soup you eat on the sofa, not one you 
order in a seaside hotel. This soup, on the other hand, is green pea soup. It 
is bright, fresh and summery; a soup that can be eaten cold, on a stifling hot 
day. It can also be eaten as the witches do – at the end of the summer, piping 
hot and spiked with Formula 8 delayed-action mouse-maker.

You can, of course, use fresh peas straight from their pods instead of the 
frozen variety. If you can get them in season, very soon after they’re been 
picked, they are sweet and delicious. Mum would often sit my vegetable-fearing 
sister with a pile of pods to open, knowing that for every pea that would make 
it into the bowl, one would make it into Lucy’s mouth. However, their season is 
short, and peas are one of the few vegetables that truly are just as good from 
the freezer. It also means this dish can be on the table in less than 15 
minutes: ideal for a weekend lunch or speedy dinner.

Pea soup

Serves 4 (or 6 for a starter)

Ingredients 
1tbsp butter
 2 shallots (finely sliced)
 750ml vegetable stock (or ham stock, if you have it)
 400g frozen peas (petit pois are lovely here)
 3 sprigs mint 
Freshly ground pepper and flaky sea salt 
Squeeze of lemon
 4tsp crème fraîche

Equipment 
Knife and chopping board 
Medium saucepan 
Wooden spoon 
Blender

1. Melt the butter in the saucepan, and add the finely sliced shallots. Fry 
them over a low heat, stirring frequently to ensure they don’t brown. Once they 
are translucent, add the stock. Bring the stock to the boil.

2. Tip the peas into the stock, and bring it back to the boil. As soon as it 
is boiling, tip the contents of the pan into the blender and add all but a 
couple of the mint leaves. Blitz to a consistency you like – I prefer to still 
have the texture of the peas in the soup, but you might prefer a smoother 
consistency – if so, blitz for a good few minutes.

3. Taste the soup for seasoning, and add salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon. 
Pour the soup back into the pan, warm it through, and then serve up with some 
crème fraîche and a sprig of mint. Eat immediately.
