Full time: Real Betis 1-6 Real Madrid

Madrid end their run of three league draws with a thumping victory at the 
Estadio Benito Villamarín, Isco bagging two goals including the finishing touch 
to a wonderfully flowing counterattack. That puts Real level at the top of the 
table with Atlético on 18 points and should silence a few critics – they are on 
a 22-game unbeaten run after all. Plenty of work for Gus Poyet in the coming 
weeks after a terrible first-half display, although the second was more 
promising. That’s all from me, thanks for reading.

Cristiano Ronaldo puts icing on cake as Real Madrid put six past Betis

90+1 mins Petros is booked for a rugby tackle on Asensio. He should have no 
complaints, though somehow he has come up with a few. Ronaldo slaps the 
free-kick high over the bar. He hasn’t been quite at his best tonight though 
his goal was wonderfully taken.

87 mins Joaquín wriggles into the box and draws the keeper before pulling the 
ball back towards the penalty spot, but no one in green and white is near 
enough to apply the finishing touch.

Goal! Real Betis 1-6 Real Madrid (Ronaldo, 78)

Ronaldo collects the ball a long way from goal, passes into Morata’s feet and 
gets his zoom on. The Portuguese sprints into the box collecting the return 
pass as he goes, and buries a low finish past Adán.

71 mins Ceballos’s first contribution is to turn down a golden chance to shoot 
and instead deliver a disguised dink into the middle, which none of his 
team-mates had any hope of reading. At the other end Cristiano Ronaldo skies a 
header from just a couple of yards. It’s not often Real score this many with 
Ronaldo on the pitch and without him on the scoresheet.

Goal! Real Betis 1-5 Real Madrid (Isco, 62)

This is a sumptuous finish. Isco collects a loose ball on the left side of the 
box after Ronaldo’s cross, and shapes his shot inside the far post to leave an 
out-of-position Antonio Adán with no hope of getting near it.

off the pitch. He’s fuming, the crowd behind the goal are fuming, but the 
assistant referee runs away as quick as he can sidestep.

and Joaquín and Cejudo either side. It seems much more effective.

57 mins Although it was a careless pass by Pepe, Betis deserve credit for 
pressing high and forcing the issue, something they didn’t do in the first 
half. A period of home control ends with a slack pass in the final third and 
it’s Madrid’s turn to counter through Ronaldo – but it comes to nothing.

Strangely it feels as though Joaquín has been the best player on the pitch, 
despite being 4-0 down and contributing heartily to one of those goals against 
his team. The guy is brilliant on the ball though and seems to make the right 
decision nine times from ten – it just happened that the tenth was catastrophic 
in this particular half. And he can move:

“Hi Lawrence,” John McEnerney sends from his iPad. “Real of late making hard 
work of the run of the mill teams like Betis thatLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> is full of bit like Andy 
Murray at a Grand Slam 5 setters against lads ranked 100 places below him. 
Kroos is a joy to watch when he’s on bit like Xavi & Iniesta. 5-0 away win! 
Enjoy the rest of it! Top coverage as always.” In fairness I think this email 
was sent before the last couple of goals, but 5-0 is now looking pretty

Goal! Real Betis 0-4 Real Madrid (Isco, 45)

This is as ruthless a team goal as you are likely to see. From a Betis corner, 
Madrid break. Five or six stream forward as Pepe finds Kovacic who plays in 
Benzema. The striker power through the middle before feeding Ronaldo on the 
left of the box, who plays the ball first time across the area to the back post 
for Pepe arriving. If that pass hadn’t befuddled the Betis defence then his 
layoff for Isco certainly does, who sweeps the ball into an empty net. The goal 
was scored in about a hundredth of the time it took me to type it out. Quick, 
one-touch, incisive stuff. Great to watch, unless you’re Gus Poyet.

42 mins Isco is retrospectively booked for a high boot into Durmisi’s 
sensitive area. The left-back shakes it off and is OK to continue.

41 mins Madrid stream forward on the counterattack and had Carvajal’s cross 
been better, they might be four goals clear. Instead it’s too deep and Betis 
eventually get the ball safe.

Goal! Real Betis 0-3 Real Madrid (Marcelo, 39)

There is some fortune about this with Benzema’s deflected shot crashing 
against Marcelo’s shoulder, spinning up into the air and sitting perfectly for 
him to hit from eight yards. The shot is a little lucky too, scuffed into the 
ground and over the diving Adán, but I’m sure the left-back won’t be too 
fussed. This could be a long night for Betis.

34 mins Joaquín turns on the style this time, dribbling down the right and 
feeding Piccini inside him. The right-back fires a shot towards goal and it is 
only narrowly over.

Goal! Real Betis 0-2 Real Madrid (Benzema, 31)

My Joaquín eulogy was ill-timed. He tries to dribble through three Madrid 
players, loses the ball and they quickly break. Kroos feeds Karim Benzema who 
pulls off to the left in some space and strokes the ball past Adán with ease.

29 mins Good football from the home side who build up neatly to find Castro in 
some space lurking on the left of the box. He opens his body and bends the ball 
around the reaching Navas, but the shot flies just around the frame of the goal 
too.

27 mins Joaquín looks superb, picking the ball up in the final third and 
shaking off purple shirts before playing into a team-mate’s feet and looking 
for the return. Unfortunately the ball is bouncing off their boots like a 
trampoline – the return ball just never comes.

19 mins The problem with these sort of games for a side like Betis is that you 
don’t get many chances so when one comes along, you must take it. Unfortunately 
on this occasion Castro decides to shoot from 30 yards rather than play in a 
team-mate and that might be their best opening of the half gone.

16 mins Zinedine Zidane and Gus Poyet both prowl the edge of what must be the 
largest technical areas in European top-flight football. I don’t have the stats 
to back that claim up, but take my word for it – they are huge.

14 mins It should be two! Gareth Bale gets on the end of Kroos’s cross and 
attacks it at the back post with a diving header. The ball crashes against 
post, then goalkeeper, before running away for a corner. Bale was ready to 
celebrate.

in his teenage years, bursting through the middle of the pitch. Only a 
last-ditch tackle denies the midfielder but Madrid get a corner and are turning 
up the heat on Betis.

Goal! Real Betis 0-1 Real Madrid (Varane, 4)

Kroos bends the ball beautifully towards the penalty spot, but even so the 
Betis marking is woeful. A queue of purple shirts line up to head the ball home 
and Raphaël Varane is the lucky man, burying it into the top-right corner.

start alongside Rubén Castro in attack, meaning Joaquín will play in midfield.

Will Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> miss Sergio 
Ramos? He is expected to be out for about six weeks after picking up an injury 
playing for Spain, but in truth the captain has made some costly errors already 
this season and the combination of Pepe and Raphaël Varane isn’t too shabby. 
Luka Modric and Casemiro are still a way from returning and James Rodriguez 
remains on the road to recovery, so Madrid’s midfield continues to be a patched 
up job. On the plus side, Marcelo returns to the side after his injury.

Preamble

Right about now Atlético Madrid are rounding off a heavy win against Granada, 
a result which leavesReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> needing a big win of their 
own at the Estadio Benito Villamarín tonight if they are to return to the top 
of La Liga. Real’s smooth start to the season has quickly turned into what on 
their planet is considered something of a crisis: the run of four draws in all 
competitions before the international break has raised plenty of probing 
questions over whether they can cope without long-term absentees Luka Modric 
and Casemiro and, more significantly, how exactly a Zinedine Zidane team is 
meant to play.

That run must end tonight against Real Betis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realbetis> but in Madrid’s way stands a 
manager energised by his new challenge in Spain, and a team spearheaded by the 
goals of Rubén Castro and the guile of Joaquín – a forward duo with a combined 
age of 70 but still with the ability to threaten defences. Gus Poyet’s side are 
performing at about par so far, beating struggling Valencia and Malaga but 
“swallowing six” – in the manager’s words – from Barcelona. Any Betis result 
tonight will be hard for Zidane to swallow, especially with their rampant city 
neighbours at the top of La Liga. Expect a response from Real.

Kick-off: 7.45pm BST

Madrid end their run of three league draws with a thumping victory at the 
Estadio Benito Villamarín, Isco bagging two goals including the finishing touch 
to a wonderfully flowing counterattack. That puts Real level at the top of the 
table with Atlético on 18 points and should silence a few critics – they are on 
a 22-game unbeaten run after all. Plenty of work for Gus Poyet in the coming 
weeks after a terrible first-half display, although the second was more 
promising. That’s all from me, thanks for reading.

Cristiano Ronaldo puts icing on cake as Real Madrid put six past Betis

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/real-betis-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report> 
90+1 mins Petros is booked for a rugby tackle on Asensio. He should have no 
complaints, though somehow he has come up with a few. Ronaldo slaps the 
free-kick high over the bar. He hasn’t been quite at his best tonight though 
his goal was wonderfully taken.
 
89 mins Álvaro Cejudo flashes a low shot the wrong side of the near post. 
Moments later Joaquín flips a clever pass for Castro whose header is well-held 
by Navas.
 
87 mins Joaquín wriggles into the box and draws the keeper before pulling the 
ball back towards the penalty spot, but no one in green and white is near 
enough to apply the finishing touch.
 
85 mins The game has opened out and there is another goal in it if someone 
wants to score. Lucas feeds Ronaldo but his left footed shot flies high over 
the bar.
 
82 mins Betis win a free-kick 25 yards from goal but try to work an 
overelaborate training move when the baying crowd wanted a thwack at goal.
 
80 mins Bale is replaced by Marco Asensio in Madrid’s final change. 
 
Ronaldo offers a muted celebration with good grace and humility.
 
Ronaldo collects the ball a long way from goal, passes into Morata’s feet and 
gets his zoom on. The Portuguese sprints into the box collecting the return 
pass as he goes, and buries a low finish past Adán.
 
76 mins ...Whose shot clatters into the Betis wall. The home side try to break 
but end up losing possession and Roman Zozulya is booked trying to win it back.
 
75 mins Morata is immediately felled on the edge of the box. Free-kick. He 
picks up the ball only to have it swiped from his grasp by Cristiano Ronaldo...
 
73 mins Benzema is replaced by Álvaro Morata.
 
71 mins Ceballos’s first contribution is to turn down a golden chance to shoot 
and instead deliver a disguised dink into the middle, which none of his 
team-mates had any hope of reading. At the other end Cristiano Ronaldo skies a 
header from just a couple of yards. It’s not often Real score this many with 
Ronaldo on the pitch and without him on the scoresheet.
 
68 mins Betis’s vim has been sapped by that fifth goal. It’s all gone a little 
flat.
 
66 mins Betis make their final change: Jonas Martin is replaced by the 
20-year-old Dani Ceballos.
 
64 mins Kovacic’s night is done and he is replaced by Lucas Vázquez.
 
This is a sumptuous finish. Isco collects a loose ball on the left side of the 
box after Ronaldo’s cross, and shapes his shot inside the far post to leave an 
out-of-position Antonio Adán with no hope of getting near it.
 
61 mins Joaquín crosses from the byline but is adjudged to have taken the ball 
off the pitch. He’s fuming, the crowd behind the goal are fuming, but the 
assistant referee runs away as quick as he can sidestep.
 
59 mins Poyet has shuffled the pack with Castro attacking through the middle 
and Joaquín and Cejudo either side. It seems much more effective.
 
57 mins Although it was a careless pass by Pepe, Betis deserve credit for 
pressing high and forcing the issue, something they didn’t do in the first 
half. A period of home control ends with a slack pass in the final third and 
it’s Madrid’s turn to counter through Ronaldo – but it comes to nothing.
 
Pepe gives away a sloppy ball at the back and Betis take advantage with three 
slick passes setting Álvaro Cejudo in on goal, who takes a touch before firing 
low past Navas.
 
53 mins Betis have made two changes with Roman Zozulya and Álvaro Cejudo 
replacing Álex Alegría and Darko Brasanac.
 
51 mins A moment later Betis are at it again through Castro down the right. 
Joaquín has a chance with his head from the penalty spot with the goalkeeper 
stranded, but three purple shirts get in between the Betis captain and the goal 
and make the block.
 
49 mins Betis pinch the ball in midfield and start a counter. They work it 
wide for Castro who curls a deep cross into the area, but it’s cooly defended 
by Pepe on the chest.
 
47 mins Betis are noticeably snappier at the start of this half, yapping at 
ankles and clattering into legs. Isco gets hammered in a sandwich of challenges 
and Germán Pezzella is booked.
 
The second half is under way. 
 
Strangely it feels as though Joaquín has been the best player on the pitch, 
despite being 4-0 down and contributing heartily to one of those goals against 
his team. The guy is brilliant on the ball though and seems to make the right 
decision nine times from ten – it just happened that the tenth was catastrophic 
in this particular half. And he can move:
 
“Hi Lawrence,” John McEnerney sends from his iPad. “Real of late making hard 
work of the run of the mill teams like Betis thatLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> is full of bit like Andy 
Murray at a Grand Slam 5 setters against lads ranked 100 places below him. 
Kroos is a joy to watch when he’s on bit like Xavi & Iniesta. 5-0 away win! 
Enjoy the rest of it! Top coverage as always.” In fairness I think this email 
was sent before the last couple of goals, but 5-0 is now looking pretty 
conservative.
 
Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are much better 
at football than Real Betis.
 
This is as ruthless a team goal as you are likely to see. From a Betis corner, 
Madrid break. Five or six stream forward as Pepe finds Kovacic who plays in 
Benzema. The striker power through the middle before feeding Ronaldo on the 
left of the box, who plays the ball first time across the area to the back post 
for Pepe arriving. If that pass hadn’t befuddled the Betis defence then his 
layoff for Isco certainly does, who sweeps the ball into an empty net. The goal 
was scored in about a hundredth of the time it took me to type it out. Quick, 
one-touch, incisive stuff. Great to watch, unless you’re Gus Poyet.
 
42 mins Isco is retrospectively booked for a high boot into Durmisi’s 
sensitive area. The left-back shakes it off and is OK to continue.
 
41 mins Madrid stream forward on the counterattack and had Carvajal’s cross 
been better, they might be four goals clear. Instead it’s too deep and Betis 
eventually get the ball safe.
 
There is some fortune about this with Benzema’s deflected shot crashing 
against Marcelo’s shoulder, spinning up into the air and sitting perfectly for 
him to hit from eight yards. The shot is a little lucky too, scuffed into the 
ground and over the diving Adán, but I’m sure the left-back won’t be too 
fussed. This could be a long night for Betis.

 
36 mins Madrid pass, pass, and pass some more. Frustrating for Betis. 
 
34 mins Joaquín turns on the style this time, dribbling down the right and 
feeding Piccini inside him. The right-back fires a shot towards goal and it is 
only narrowly over.
 
My Joaquín eulogy was ill-timed. He tries to dribble through three Madrid 
players, loses the ball and they quickly break. Kroos feeds Karim Benzema who 
pulls off to the left in some space and strokes the ball past Adán with ease.
 
29 mins Good football from the home side who build up neatly to find Castro in 
some space lurking on the left of the box. He opens his body and bends the ball 
around the reaching Navas, but the shot flies just around the frame of the goal 
too.
 
27 mins Joaquín looks superb, picking the ball up in the final third and 
shaking off purple shirts before playing into a team-mate’s feet and looking 
for the return. Unfortunately the ball is bouncing off their boots like a 
trampoline – the return ball just never comes.
 
25 mins Ronaldo collects the ball with his back to goal, spins along the edge 
of the box and fires a low shot straight at Adán. He’s getting more and more 
involved.
 
23 mins Bale takes the ball on the right and this doesn’t look much fun for 
the Betis left-back, Durmisi, but Bale runs the ball off the pitch.
 
21 mins Bale whips in a ball towards Cristiano Ronaldo who doesn’t make 
contact and it runs through to Adán in goal. Ronaldo might feel he should have 
taken that chance, and graciously applauds Bale’s ball.
 
19 mins The problem with these sort of games for a side like Betis is that you 
don’t get many chances so when one comes along, you must take it. Unfortunately 
on this occasion Castro decides to shoot from 30 yards rather than play in a 
team-mate and that might be their best opening of the half gone.
 
16 mins Zinedine Zidane and Gus Poyet both prowl the edge of what must be the 
largest technical areas in European top-flight football. I don’t have the stats 
to back that claim up, but take my word for it – they are huge.
 
14 mins It should be two! Gareth Bale gets on the end of Kroos’s cross and 
attacks it at the back post with a diving header. The ball crashes against 
post, then goalkeeper, before running away for a corner. Bale was ready to 
celebrate.
 
12 mins Toni Kroos settles a bit of pinball with a 25-yard header back to 
Navas which Castro threatened to intercept, but doesn’t quite manage to.
 
10 mins Kovacic makes the sort of sudden impact that made him such a prospect 
in his teenage years, bursting through the middle of the pitch. Only a 
last-ditch tackle denies the midfielder but Madrid get a corner and are turning 
up the heat on Betis.
 
8 mins Joaquín works a one-two in midfield before breaking towards the right 
wing. He feeds a lovely weighted pass behind Marcelo for the right-back Piccini 
to chase, but his low cross is well-defended by Varane.
 
6 mins The crowd’s initial, excitable buzz has been replaced by boos and 
whistles as Madrid come forward again. Isco delivers a cross to the far post 
and Ronaldo must score, but somehow bumps the ball over the bar from a couple 
of yards with what was near enough an open goal.
 
Kroos bends the ball beautifully towards the penalty spot, but even so the 
Betis marking is woeful. A queue of purple shirts line up to head the ball home 
and Raphaël Varane is the lucky man, burying it into the top-right corner.

Luka Modric and Casemiro are still a way from returning and James Rodriguez 
remains on the road to recovery, so Madrid’s midfield continues to be a patched 
up job. On the plus side, Marcelo returns to the side after his injury.

Preamble

Right about now Atlético Madrid are rounding off a heavy win against Granada, 
a result which leavesReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> needing a big win of their 
own at the Estadio Benito Villamarín tonight if they are to return to the top 
of La Liga. Real’s smooth start to the season has quickly turned into what on 
their planet is considered something of a crisis: the run of four draws in all 
competitions before the international break has raised plenty of probing 
questions over whether they can cope without long-term absentees Luka Modric 
and Casemiro and, more significantly, how exactly a Zinedine Zidane team is 
meant to play.

That run must end tonight against Real Betis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realbetis> but in Madrid’s way stands a 
manager energised by his new challenge in Spain, and a team spearheaded by the 
goals of Rubén Castro and the guile of Joaquín – a forward duo with a combined 
age of 70 but still with the ability to threaten defences. Gus Poyet’s side are 
performing at about par so far, beating struggling Valencia and Malaga but 
“swallowing six” – in the manager’s words – from Barcelona. Any Betis result 
tonight will be hard for Zidane to swallow, especially with their rampant city 
neighbours at the top of La Liga. Expect a response from Real.

Kick-off: 7.45pm BST
