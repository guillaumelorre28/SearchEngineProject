A five-part autobiographical movie series might sound like the last word in 
self indulgence, but this (part two) leaves you wanting more. Charting 
Jodorowsky’s artistic awakening in 1940s Chile, it’s less psychedelic and more 
accessible than his celebrated 1970s works, but still one step removed from 
reality. It’s a cornucopia of wonders, filled with wise truths, bohemian 
romance and theatrical flourishes, not to mention punk poets, clowns, giants, 
puppets and menstruating dwarves. You never know what’s coming next.

A forensic, discomfiting investigation into the Stuxnet virus 
<https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/>: an unfathomably 
complex piece of programming whose purpose, targets and origins were initially 
a complete mystery. There’s little solace when the answers do come, either in 
terms of who the “bad guys” really are, or in Stuxnet’s implications: that such 
viruses could easily cripple industrial civilisation. Gibney suggests this is 
nothing short of a new form of warfare, which we’re only just getting to grips 
with.

Scorsese’s epic but austere study of faith in crisis

17th-century Japan, where Christians are being tortured and persecuted – a true 
test for missionariesAndrew Garfield

, especially considering their predecessor (Liam Neeson

welcomed by the underground Christians, they’re soon tracked down by the local 
inquisitor. Will God hear their prayers?

An outer planet in the Star Wars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> 
galaxy in terms of story significance (it effectively ends whereA New Hope 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/> begins), this is nonetheless rendered 
with the requisite attention to design, spectacle and pacing fans expect.
Felicity Jones <https://www.theguardian.com/film/felicity-jones> is the rebel 
with a cause, marshalling her motley (overwhelmingly male) crew into an 
apparent suicide mission to the dark side.

A boy-and-his-monster tale that treads familiar emotional ground, but takes 
care with its storytelling and especially its marvellous special effects. This 
kid (Lewis MacDougall) is faced with a dying mum (Felicity Jones), a distant 
dad, and a hard-knock school life –until a giant tree creature from the pages 
of his sketch book comes to life
