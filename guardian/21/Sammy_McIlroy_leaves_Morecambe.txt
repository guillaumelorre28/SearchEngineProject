Morecambe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/morecambe> have parted company 
with their manager, Sammy McIlroy, and his assistant, Mark Lillis, by mutual 
consent following the club's disappointing 20th-placed finish in League Two.

The former Manchester United and Northern Ireland midfielder, 56, had been in 
charge of the Shrimps since 2005, initially in a caretaker role before he was 
appointed on a long-term deal.

In his first full season McIlroy won Morecambe promotion to the Football 
League for the first time in their history with a 2-1 victory over Exeter in 
the 2007 Conference play-off final at Wembley.

Last season saw them reach the League Two play-offs but they have failed to 
build on that progress and the chairman, Peter McGuigan, said: "Sammy and Mark 
steered the club into the Football League and led us to a play-off spot last 
season which was a fantastic achievement.

"This season has been disappointing but everyone at the club will always 
recognise the fantastic contribution they both made to its success and we thank 
them for all their hard work and commitment."

McIlroy, who had previously managed Norwich Victoria, Macclesfield, Stockport 
and Northern Ireland, said: "We spoke about a new deal but I just thought it 
was better for me and for the club that I looked for a new challenge and the 
club brought in a fresh face."
