South Sydney’s NRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> season is all but 
over after a toothless 20-0 defeat to North Queensland extended their losing 
run to five.


The Rabbitohs rarely fired a shot at the defending premiers in front of a 
strong crowd at Barlow Park in Cairns, who instead watched Cowboys skipper 
Johnathan Thurston put on a signature clinic.


The Queensland State of Origin star scored a try and had a hand in another, 
helping the visitors consolidate their spot in the top four before getting a 
well-deserved early mark in the 75th minute.

For the Rabbitohs however, the defeat continues their miserable 2016 campaign 
and leaves them with the near-impossible task of winning all eight of their 
remaining games to make the finals.


Led by James Tamou and Matt Scott, the Cowboys forwards strolled through the 
Rabbitohs middle with concerning ease, paving the way for Thurston and company 
to ruin John Sutton’s 250-game celebrations.


Greg Inglis and Luke Keary tried hard for the visitors, as did Sam Burgess, 
although the star forward succumbed to a knee injury midway through the second 
half.


The game started horribly for the home side after winger Joe Burgess was 
trapped in his in-goal following Kyle Feldt’s trademark towering kick-off.


From there it was all the Cowboys, who used a 65% possession rate in the first 
half to lay on tries for Thurston and Scott and take a comfortable 14-0 lead at 
the break.


A try to Javid Bowen, deputising for the injured Kane Linnett, kicked the 
advantage to three tries early in the second half before the Cowboys closed out 
the match by keeping an opposition side scoreless for the third time this year.

Canberra staged another great escape to beat Newcastle 29-25 earlier on 
Sunday, a miraculous try to Jordan Rapana in golden point the difference as the 
Raiders closed in on the NRL’s top four.

Down 22-0 just before half-time, the Raiders looked destined for an 
unthinkable loss to the competition cellar-dwellers at GIO Stadium. But four 
unanswered tries – including a double to skipper Jarrod Croker – in the final 
41 minutes of regular time set them up for a grandstand finish in front of 
9,731 fans.

Locked up at 24-24 with less than five minutes remaining, five-eighth Blake 
Austin kicked what looked to be the match-winning field goal inside the final 
90 seconds. But the Knights regained possession from a short kick-off and 
captain Trent Hodkinson replied moments later with a field goal of his own to 
send the game to golden point.

It’s the second time this season the teams have played beyond the 80 minutes, 
having drawn 24-24 in round three. On that occasion there were seven missed 
attempts at a field goal, but there were only four on Sunday.

The last wayward kick was by Austin, on which Rapana – who injured his 
shoulder earlier – somehow pounced to score and seal the victory.

It was the Raiders’ fifth win in the past five games and puts them just one 
point outside the top four. For the last-placed Knights it marks their 10th 
successive loss. They’ll have a much-needed bye next week while the Raiders 
host North Queensland next Monday.
