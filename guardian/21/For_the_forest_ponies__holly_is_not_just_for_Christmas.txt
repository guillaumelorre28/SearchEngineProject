As we press on along the ridge above the wood, on the north side of the path 
we find ponies raising the browse line as they stretch high into the hollies. A 
large white one strains every muscle in its neck to get at the most tender 
branch-end leaves.Forest ponies 
<http://www.thenewforest.co.uk/discover/new-forest-ponies.aspx> eat a huge 
quantity of holly during the cold weather. People often cut branches to make 
life easier for them, but this group don’t need any help.


On the other side, we spot one of the woodland’s giants that has come to 
grief. Possibly dating from the origins ofRed Shoot Wood 
<http://www.streetmap.co.uk/place/Red_Shoot_Wood_in_Hampshire_529611_219611.htm>
 in the 17th and 18th centuries, this huge oak has been caught by some 
vortex-wind, and lifted enough to break the myriad of cable-like roots 
anchoring it into the shallow clay that coats the underlying gravels.

Its fall was not long ago in forest time, yet far enough back for the first 
bracket fungi to form along the shattered boughs, and for the creamy powder 
from the holes of tiny woodboring beetles to hang in balls on the spider-webs 
below, as though nature has created seasonal baubles.

Reaching the valley bottom, we come to the small pond by Lindford Brook 
<http://www.strollingguides.co.uk/books/newforest/walks/linford.php>. In 
summer, water lilies add colour; now their decaying leaves paint an oily sheen 
on its surface. We cut back across the heart of the wood, following a route 
that appears clearly marked on the Ordnance Survey sheet.

We feel confident for a while, but then unease creeps in. Just where are we? 
We have become completely lost in a confusing maze of footpaths. With my GPS 
still at home, and two smartphones that cannot agree where north is, we have to 
work by instinct.

As we make slow progress, we notice that we are being watched with interest by 
aroe buck <http://www.roedeer.com/>. He doesn’t move as we study each other for 
several minutes, nor when we go on. If we hadn’t got lost, we wouldn’t have 
seen him. Something positive to ease our embarrassment.
