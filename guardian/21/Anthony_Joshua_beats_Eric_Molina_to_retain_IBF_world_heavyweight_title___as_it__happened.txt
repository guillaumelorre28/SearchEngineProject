Here’s AJ: “[Molina] was trying to throw a few haymakers, excuse the pun... 
someone who’s waiting on the back foot, you just have to be patient and take 
your chances. I’m consistent, I’m not at my peak yet, I have to keep working.”

Here’s Eddie Hearn – and he’s bringing Wladimir Klitschko into the ring! 
Klitschko has the mic, pacing around in his shirt. It’s all a bit WWE, with 
mutual respect instead of trash talk. Boooo! The upshot is this: the fight is 
official.April 29th, Wembley Stadium. Joshua v Klitschko. That will be a lot 
better than this was. Thanks for joining me; here’s the reports.Goodnight.

Anthony Joshua retains his IBF world heavyweight title!

Molina just beats the count, but it’s a matter of time and Joshua pounces, a 
series of left hooks forcing Molina back onto the ropes. The referee stops the 
fight, which has been entirely one-sided.

Round 2 of 12: As Haye points out, Joshua will have had tougher sparring 
sessions than that first round. Molina edges forward, but he is understandably 
unwilling to take any chances. The Texan has said all week he’s looking for one 
big punch... but he’s causing Joshua no problems so far, save for a solid 
defence against Joshua’s big right hand.

Round 1 of 12: McCracken tells Joshua to take his time, and the champion, in 
red and white shorts, keeps his distance against Molina, in black shorts and 
keeping his guard up. Molina takes a full two minutes to throw a punch, with a 
looping right to Joshua’s hip. Joshua retaliates with a couple of crunching 
blows, then a left-right combination. Molina doesn’t look up for this, to be 
honest.

Molina enters, looking pensive as he makes his way to the ring. He’s had a 
long time to think about this, while Joshua felt confident enough to watch 
Whyte and Chisora in action. Here comes Joshua, emerging from between giant, 
flaming initials. He looks ready to put on a show. He is led into the ring by 
trainer Rob McCracken, his Olympic coach and a new addition to his professional 
team.

The big names ringside can’t agree – Froch and Haye say draw, Bellew says 
Chisora, others are saying Whyte. Here are the judges’ scores:115-114 Chisora, 
115-113 Whyte, 115-114 Whyte. Dillian Whyte wins by split decision! There’s a 
brief hug, although an aggrieved Chisora isn’t in the mood. Anyone for a 
rematch?

Round 12: Whyte has shaded the last two rounds – a final assault could tip it 
in his favour. Chisora is hanging on early in the round, but goes down under 
pressure as he tries to retaliate. No count, so it must have been seen as a 
slip by the referee. Whyte on top in a bruising round – but Chisora spins his 
opponent with a big shot – then Whyte lands with a right! Chisora needs time to 
gather his senses, but he has Whyte reeling again with seconds to go. Both men 
last the distance after a cracking final round.

Round 11: Chisora heads straight into the corner and indulges in a spot of 
play-acting, winding up Whyte and running down the clock. He looks to be trying 
to hang on to a narrow advantage, with Whyte still landing the cleaner 
combinations. A left uppercut rocks Chisora momentarily – he’s looking very 
tired. Such a close fight, and it could still conceivably go either way.

Round 10: Still up for grabs with three rounds to go, and Chisora attacks 
early this time – but Whyte is boxing clever, well-timed jabs upsetting his 
opponent’s rhythm. He lands with a big right, Chisora a hefty left hook. Whyte 
gets Chisora on the ropes, but is still struggling to land really damaging 
blows. Ringside, Memphis Depay’s look is Bruno Mars/matador:

Round 9: Chisora seems to have the crowd’s support now, but is feeling the 
effects of that onslaught, allowing Whyte to land a few tentative jabs. He’s 
gearing up for another attack, and swings a tired left hook, trying to back 
Whyte up in the final minute. Whyte takes the round, but Chisora finishes well, 
landing a right hook as Whyte swings and misses.

Round 8: David Haye, on co-commentary for this match, has just called Tony 
Bellew ‘Tony Bellend’. That’s a shame. Back to the boxing, and again it’s Whyte 
on the ropes, with Chisora trying to find a second wind. A wild uppercut 
misses, but Whyte wobbles under a flurry of right-hand blows. There’s the first 
sign of needle as the two men keep tussling after the bell goes.

Round 7: Joshua is backstage watching the fight, looking like he doesn’t have 
a care in the world. So far, David Haye and Carl Froch have Chisora edging 
ahead on their unofficial cards. He’s slowed down in the last couple of rounds, 
and is looking across to his corner for inspiration. A scrappy round ends in a 
flurry of jabs, not quite connecting but getting the crowd on their feet.

Round 6: Whyte is benefiting from Chisora’s efforts in the last round, using 
his superior reach to back Chisora into a corner, where he’s less effective. 
Chisora finds a right hook, but both men are feeling the pace and leaning on 
each other as we reach the halfway mark.

Round 5: Chisora lands a big right hook, and soaks up Whyte’s counters, 
getting his opponent back onto the ropes and lands a couple of looping left 
hooks – but Whyte rallies at the end of the round after looking in real 
trouble. That’s another round for Chisora, but the biggest surprise so far is 
that it’s been a good, clean fight.

Round 4: Chisora continues to have the edge, his trademark pressing causing 
Whyte plenty of discomfort – although a counter-punch to the body takes the 
wind from his sails late on. Signs that Whyte is getting back into this after 
another very close round.

Dont have to like Chisora's behavior--who could--but he always turns up...

Round 3: Chisora still having plenty of joy with body shots, and a big left 
hook puts him on top late in the round. It’s been a cleaner fight than anyone 
expected early on, and Whyte is having to be patient, hoping he’ll have the 
stamina to battle back.

Round 2: Whyte threatens to take control of the round with his cleaner 
hitting, but Chisora soaks them up and forces Whyte onto the ropes. It’s a 
scrappier affair than the first round, which suits Chisora, although he doesn’t 
land anything to really trouble his opponent.

Round 1 of 12: The fighters touch gloves ahead of a bout that’s no longer a 
British title fight, thanks to Chisora’s antics. It is still an eliminator for 
a shot at a world title, along with all the personal beef. Whyte is the 
pre-fight favourite, but Chisora starts strongly, firing in body shots and 
keeping his opponent on the back foot. Whyte is countering cleanly, connecting 
with Chisora’s chin three times in a lively first round.

After nearly coming to blows in a Sky TV studio, and again at this week’s 
press conference, it’s time for Dillian Whyte and Dereck Chisora to throw hands 
in the ring. This time, it’s for money. Brixton’s Whyte, aka the Body Snatcher, 
enters to Back in Black, Finchley’s ‘Del Boy’ Chisora to the more leisurely 
strains of Hotel California.

Obenauf, who has lost one of her 10 fights, is struggling with Taylor’s 
superior fitness, with more blows landing from the Irish fighter. A looping 
right-hander keeps Taylor guessing, but the Brazilian has a cut over her eye, 
and will do well to go the distance.

A dominant start from Taylor, finding gaps in Obenauf’s defences early and 
forcing a count in the second round with a swinging left hook. Backstage, 
Molina is strapped and shadow boxing in his dressing room. There’s still 
potentially 12 rounds of Whyte and Chisora before the main event.

Cayetano takes increasing punishment from Quigg, and he gets forced into a 
corner early in the ninth. A big right-hander puts Cayetano out for the count, 
and it’s a convincing win for Quigg on his comeback.

Wladimir Klitschko is in the building, keen to take in Joshua’s moves from 
ringside. In the ring, Birmingham’sKal Yafai is fighting for the WBA 
super-flyweight title against Panama’s Luis Concepción, who arrived as champion 
but vacated his belt after failing to make the weight. Only Yafai can become 
champion – and he’s on his way, dominating his opponent after nine rounds.

While Fury watches on in Manchester, the WBO heavyweight belt he vacated in 
October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/tyson-fury-vacated-wbo-wba-world-heavyweight-titles-treatment>
 has been won by New Zealand’sJoseph Parker, a name that may be more familiar 
to British audiences in a year’s time. Here’s AAP’s take on his win over Andy 
Ruiz:

Kiwi boxer Joseph Parker is the new heavyweight champion of the world after 
edging Andy Ruiz Jr by majority decision in Auckland. The fight for the WBO 
belt went down to the most slender of margins on Saturday night, withParker 
earning a 115-113 victory from two judges and a 114-114 draw from the third.

Parker, 24, started the fight slowly but grew into the contest, dominating the 
closing rounds as his stocky opponent began to tire. And his superior fitness 
and punching power told in the end, making him the first Kiwi to be crowned 
heavyweight world champion. He’s likely to seek a unification fight overseas in 
2017 or a bout with former champion Tyson Fury.

The story so far

While most of the attention has been on the crowd, with Tyson Fury, David Haye 
and Tony Bellew sitting in dangerously close proximity, there has been plenty

Local boy Marcus Morrison beat Harry Matthews on points in a middleweight bout,
Conor Benn knocked out Steve Backhouse in just over one minute, and heavyweight 
Dave Allen couldn’t live with Cuba’sLuis Ortiz, with the referee stepping in at 
the end of the seventh round.

Fight of the night so far saw Frank Buglioni force a 12th-round stoppage to 
beat Hosea Burton and take the British light-heavyweight title, before rising 
super-middleweight starCallum Smith was made to work by Luke Blackledge, before 
delivering a 10th-round knockout.

Preamble

This could have been a far more daunting date for Anthony Joshua 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anthony-joshua>, with Wladimir Klitschko 
originally planned for the opposite corner. Another Klitschko injury, and the 
powers-that-be dragging their heels, has bought Joshua some useful extra 
preparation time after powering to a world heavyweight title in just 34 rounds.

 Even an ageing Klitschko will offer a significant upgrade on Joshua’s 
opponents thus far, so tonight’s challenger brings some useful experience, if 
not the same pedigree. Eric Molina has previously rattled WBC world champion 
Deontay Wilder, but doesn’t seem to fancy his chances of going the distance, 
instead training to land one big knockout blow on Joshua’s largely untested 
chin.

Molina, who teaches children with disabilities

 outside of the ring, has matched Joshua inan agreeable build-up  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/09/anthony-joshua-eric-molina-muhammad-ali-ibf-champion>
that has failed to oil the hype machine. The Texan is a 12-1 outsider to shock 
the champion, but there are still reasons for Joshua to be apprehensive; Molina 
has the experience and power to truly test him, for the first time since an 
emotional scrap with Dillian Whyte in January.

Whyte is working towards a world title shot of his own, and takes on Dereck 
Chisora in an eliminator that’s the highlight of a packed undercard. While the 
main event could be a classy, clinical show, this world title eliminator will 
bring the beef, afterthe table-flipping antics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/dec/07/dereck-chisora-throws-table-at-dillian-whyte-before-title-fight-in-manchester-video>
 of the pre-fight press conference.

Ring walks are due at 10.30pm GMT, with Whyte v Chisora coming up shortly, and 
a host of heavyweight stars in attendance at the Manchester Arena. It’s 
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday...

Here’s AJ: “[Molina] was trying to throw a few haymakers, excuse the pun... 
someone who’s waiting on the back foot, you just have to be patient and take 
your chances. I’m consistent, I’m not at my peak yet, I have to keep working.”

Here’s Eddie Hearn – and he’s bringing Wladimir Klitschko into the ring! 
Klitschko has the mic, pacing around in his shirt. It’s all a bit WWE, with 
mutual respect instead of trash talk. Boooo! The upshot is this: the fight is 
official.April 29th, Wembley Stadium. Joshua v Klitschko. That will be a lot 
better than this was. Thanks for joining me; here’s the reports.Goodnight.

Dillian Whyte beats Dereck Chisora on split decision after epic fight

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/11/dillian-whyte-beats-dereck-chisora-heavyweight-boxing> 
Molina just beats the count, but it’s a matter of time and Joshua pounces, a 
series of left hooks forcing Molina back onto the ropes. The referee stops the 
fight, which has been entirely one-sided.
 
Round 3 of 12: Joshua goes on the attack from the bell, landing blows at will 
– one huge right, and Molina is down, and struggling to get back up...
 
Round 2 of 12: As Haye points out, Joshua will have had tougher sparring 
sessions than that first round. Molina edges forward, but he is understandably 
unwilling to take any chances. The Texan has said all week he’s looking for one 
big punch... but he’s causing Joshua no problems so far, save for a solid 
defence against Joshua’s big right hand.
 
Round 1 of 12: McCracken tells Joshua to take his time, and the champion, in 
red and white shorts, keeps his distance against Molina, in black shorts and 
keeping his guard up. Molina takes a full two minutes to throw a punch, with a 
looping right to Joshua’s hip. Joshua retaliates with a couple of crunching 
blows, then a left-right combination. Molina doesn’t look up for this, to be 
honest.
 
The fighters touch gloves, the referee goes through the basics, and we’re off.
 
Both fighters are in the ring, and Buffer is doing his thing. Molina in the 
red corner, Joshua in the blue corner. Let’s adequately prepare ourselves to 
rumble.

Molina enters, looking pensive as he makes his way to the ring. He’s had a 
long time to think about this, while Joshua felt confident enough to watch 
Whyte and Chisora in action. Here comes Joshua, emerging from between giant, 
flaming initials. He looks ready to put on a show. He is led into the ring by 
trainer Rob McCracken, his Olympic coach and a new addition to his professional 
team.
 
“Let’s get this party started” cries  David Brent  Michael Buffer. The ring 
walks are about to begin...
 
Next up, just an hour and a half late, it’s Anthony Joshua v Eric Molina.
 
The big names ringside can’t agree – Froch and Haye say draw, Bellew says 
Chisora, others are saying Whyte. Here are the judges’ scores:115-114 Chisora, 
115-113 Whyte, 115-114 Whyte. Dillian Whyte wins by split decision! There’s a 
brief hug, although an aggrieved Chisora isn’t in the mood. Anyone for a 
rematch?
 
Round 12: Whyte has shaded the last two rounds – a final assault could tip it 
in his favour. Chisora is hanging on early in the round, but goes down under 
pressure as he tries to retaliate. No count, so it must have been seen as a 
slip by the referee. Whyte on top in a bruising round – but Chisora spins his 
opponent with a big shot – then Whyte lands with a right! Chisora needs time to 
gather his senses, but he has Whyte reeling again with seconds to go. Both men 
last the distance after a cracking final round.

Round 11: Chisora heads straight into the corner and indulges in a spot of 
play-acting, winding up Whyte and running down the clock. He looks to be trying 
to hang on to a narrow advantage, with Whyte still landing the cleaner 
combinations. A left uppercut rocks Chisora momentarily – he’s looking very 
tired. Such a close fight, and it could still conceivably go either way.
 
Round 10: Still up for grabs with three rounds to go, and Chisora attacks 
early this time – but Whyte is boxing clever, well-timed jabs upsetting his 
opponent’s rhythm. He lands with a big right, Chisora a hefty left hook. Whyte 
gets Chisora on the ropes, but is still struggling to land really damaging 
blows. Ringside, Memphis Depay’s look is Bruno Mars/matador:

<https://twitter.com/iammoallim/status/807730971076362241>  
Round 9: Chisora seems to have the crowd’s support now, but is feeling the 
effects of that onslaught, allowing Whyte to land a few tentative jabs. He’s 
gearing up for another attack, and swings a tired left hook, trying to back 
Whyte up in the final minute. Whyte takes the round, but Chisora finishes well, 
landing a right hook as Whyte swings and misses.
 
Round 8: David Haye, on co-commentary for this match, has just called Tony 
Bellew ‘Tony Bellend’. That’s a shame. Back to the boxing, and again it’s Whyte 
on the ropes, with Chisora trying to find a second wind. A wild uppercut 
misses, but Whyte wobbles under a flurry of right-hand blows. There’s the first 
sign of needle as the two men keep tussling after the bell goes.

Round 7: Joshua is backstage watching the fight, looking like he doesn’t have 
a care in the world. So far, David Haye and Carl Froch have Chisora edging 
ahead on their unofficial cards. He’s slowed down in the last couple of rounds, 
and is looking across to his corner for inspiration. A scrappy round ends in a 
flurry of jabs, not quite connecting but getting the crowd on their feet.
 
Round 6: Whyte is benefiting from Chisora’s efforts in the last round, using 
his superior reach to back Chisora into a corner, where he’s less effective. 
Chisora finds a right hook, but both men are feeling the pace and leaning on 
each other as we reach the halfway mark.
 
Round 5: Chisora lands a big right hook, and soaks up Whyte’s counters, 
getting his opponent back onto the ropes and lands a couple of looping left 
hooks – but Whyte rallies at the end of the round after looking in real 
trouble. That’s another round for Chisora, but the biggest surprise so far is 
that it’s been a good, clean fight.

Round 4: Chisora continues to have the edge, his trademark pressing causing 
Whyte plenty of discomfort – although a counter-punch to the body takes the 
wind from his sails late on. Signs that Whyte is getting back into this after 
another very close round.

2016 <https://twitter.com/ProfRayKinsella/status/807725784920166400>  
Round 3: Chisora still having plenty of joy with body shots, and a big left 
hook puts him on top late in the round. It’s been a cleaner fight than anyone 
expected early on, and Whyte is having to be patient, hoping he’ll have the 
stamina to battle back.
 
Round 2: Whyte threatens to take control of the round with his cleaner 
hitting, but Chisora soaks them up and forces Whyte onto the ropes. It’s a 
scrappier affair than the first round, which suits Chisora, although he doesn’t 
land anything to really trouble his opponent.
 
Round 1 of 12: The fighters touch gloves ahead of a bout that’s no longer a 
British title fight, thanks to Chisora’s antics. It is still an eliminator for 
a shot at a world title, along with all the personal beef. Whyte is the 
pre-fight favourite, but Chisora starts strongly, firing in body shots and 
keeping his opponent on the back foot. Whyte is countering cleanly, connecting 
with Chisora’s chin three times in a lively first round.

After nearly coming to blows in a Sky TV studio, and again at this week’s 
press conference, it’s time for Dillian Whyte and Dereck Chisora to throw hands 
in the ring. This time, it’s for money. Brixton’s Whyte, aka the Body Snatcher, 
enters to Back in Black, Finchley’s ‘Del Boy’ Chisora to the more leisurely 
strains of Hotel California.
Dereck Chisora throws table at Dillian Whyte before title fight in Manchester

Taylor can’t force a stoppage, but wins comfortably, Obenauf offering a peck 
on the cheek to congratulate her as the bell goes. It’s her second professional 
win as she moves towards a world title shot. Now – it’sWhyte v Chisora...
 
Obenauf, who has lost one of her 10 fights, is struggling with Taylor’s 
superior fitness, with more blows landing from the Irish fighter. A looping 
right-hander keeps Taylor guessing, but the Brazilian has a cut over her eye, 
and will do well to go the distance.
 
A dominant start from Taylor, finding gaps in Obenauf’s defences early and 
forcing a count in the second round with a swinging left hook. Backstage, 
Molina is strapped and shadow boxing in his dressing room. There’s still 
potentially 12 rounds of Whyte and Chisora before the main event.

Michael Buffer is in the ring to introduce Ireland’s Katie Taylor, as the 2012 
Olympic gold medallist takes on Brazil’s Viviane Obenauf in a bout of six 
two-minute rounds. Taylor walked out to this, earning instant appreciation from 
the Manchester crowd:
 
Cayetano takes increasing punishment from Quigg, and he gets forced into a 
corner early in the ninth. A big right-hander puts Cayetano out for the count, 
and it’s a convincing win for Quigg on his comeback.

 and a long recovery from a broken jaw. He’s taking on Jose Cayetano, and is 
comfortable in the opening rounds against a stoic opponent.
 
We are behind schedule here, with Joshua and Molina set to take their ring 
walks after 11pm GMT. Here’s a slice of Mancunian magic to pass the time...
 
Kal Yafai is crowned WBA world super-flyweight champion, after easing to a 
unanimous points victory over Luis Concepción, who failed to make the weight 
and was under-par tonight, getting knocked down in the 10th on his way to 
defeat. Coming up: Katie Taylor v Viviane Obenauf, and Dillian Whyte v Dereck 
Chisora...
 
Anthony Joshua <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anthony-joshua> is also in

super-flyweight title against Panama’s Luis Concepción, who arrived as champion

champion – and he’s on his way, dominating his opponent after nine rounds.

While Fury watches on in Manchester, the WBO heavyweight belt he vacated in 
October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/tyson-fury-vacated-wbo-wba-world-heavyweight-titles-treatment>
 has been won by New Zealand’sJoseph Parker, a name that may be more familiar 
to British audiences in a year’s time. Here’s AAP’s take on his win over Andy 
Ruiz:

Kiwi boxer Joseph Parker is the new heavyweight champion of the world after 
edging Andy Ruiz Jr by majority decision in Auckland. The fight for the WBO 
belt went down to the most slender of margins on Saturday night, withParker 
earning a 115-113 victory from two judges and a 114-114 draw from the third.

Parker, 24, started the fight slowly but grew into the contest, dominating the 
closing rounds as his stocky opponent began to tire. And his superior fitness 
and punching power told in the end, making him the first Kiwi to be crowned 
heavyweight world champion. He’s likely to seek a unification fight overseas in 
2017 or a bout with former champion Tyson Fury.
 
The story so far

While most of the attention has been on the crowd, with Tyson Fury, David Haye 
and Tony Bellew sitting in dangerously close proximity, there has been plenty 
of action in the ring too.
