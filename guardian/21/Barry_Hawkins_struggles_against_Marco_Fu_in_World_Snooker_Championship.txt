, Barry Hawkins came crashing down to earth on Tuesday at the Crucible.

Hawkins withstood a stirring fightback by O’Sullivan from 12-9 to win a 
final-frame decider on Monday night and reach a World Championship 
quarter-final against Marco Fu. But it was a case of after the lord mayor’s 
show as he fell 7-1 behind in Tuesday afternoon’s opening session.

He had warned after his win over O’Sullivan: “I’ve got another really tough 
game against Marco so I will just concentrate on that. If Marco gets going he 
can score as well as anybody.”

So it proved as Fu swept the four frames before the interval, with breaks of 
73 in the first and 76 in the fourth, Hawkins having potted only 10 balls with 
his highest break to that point just 13. When Hawkins missed a simple red early 
in the first frame back, Fu cleared with 81 to go 5-0 up, before Hawkins got on 
the board in frame six.

A 66 and a 50 clearance clinched frame seven for Fu and he added the last of 
the session for a comprehensive lead.

On the other table, John Higgins, a 13-8 winner over Ricky Walden in the last 
16, came from behind to lead his fellow Scot Alan McManus 5-3. After an opening 
63 from Higgins, McManus led 3-1 at the interval, helped by a 114 in frame two 
and a 95% pot success rate.

Higgins levelled, though, before a 75 break took him 4-3 ahead and he also 
took frame eight in two visits.
