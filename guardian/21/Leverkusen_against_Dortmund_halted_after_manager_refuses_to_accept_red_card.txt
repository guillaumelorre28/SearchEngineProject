After waving away calls for a foul on Stefan Kiessling, the visitors broke and 
took the lead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

Dortmund’s goal infuriated Leverkusen and Schmidt was ordered to leave the 
dugout. He refused and in response the referee, Felix Zwayer, took the players 
off the pitch.

Dortmund were clearly perplexed by the decision judging by their Twitter post 
of “??? b04bvb 0-1” and both sets of players returned to the dressing room.

After talks, the teams came out without Schmidt and the match resumed around 
eight minutes after the impromptu break started.
