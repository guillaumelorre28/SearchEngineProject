, which expanded by more than 2,000 theaters on Friday after opening in limited 
release. Rogue One brought in $21.97m over the weekend. Hidden Figures 
collected $21.8m.

The animated animal musical Sing came in third, taking in another $19.5m for a 
three-week haul of $213.3m. Underworld: Blood Wars debuted in fourth place with 
$13.1m, followed by the musical La La Land with $10m.

“It’s a great weekend for space movies,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media 
analyst for box office tracker comScore, noting that the Jennifer 
Lawrence-Chris Pratt space story Passengers also remains among the top 10.

Rogue One, though, has been unstoppable, Dergarabedian said, and is expected 
to top Finding Dory as the biggest box-office success of 2016.

Final figures will be released on Monday.
