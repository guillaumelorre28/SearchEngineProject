Full-time: Chelsea 3-1 Milan

And that’s it. A comfortable win for Chelsea. The game was even - in scoreline 
and performances - at half-time butChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> were by far the better team in 
the second 45 minutes, with Oscar and Hazard in particular causing problems for 
the Italians.

GOAL! Chelsea 3-1 Milan (Oscar 86 min)

And Oscar gets his second. He scampers between his markers on to a ball from 
Cuadrado and beats Donnarumma at his near post with a low shot. Nice finish, 
and a great appearance from the bench for Oscar.

66 min: Cahill rises to meet a (who else?) Willian corner but he gets under 
the ball and the law of physics state the ball must go up and up and up. WHich 
is good news for the laws of the universe but bad news for Chelsea’s hopes of 
taking the lead.

58 min: Willian goes on an unopposed run down the right and crashes in a shot 
at Donnarumma, who leaves a little too much room at the near post. But the 
keeper makes up for it, regaining his positioning to pull off a great 
one-handed save.

48 min: Oh! Chance for Milan! Niang holds the ball up on the edge of the area 
with impressive strength and squares it to Abate but it doesn’t come off. Then 
Niang has another chance but his shot flashes wide. Two good chances, with 
Niang at the centre of both of them butMilan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> can’t exploit either.

Half-time: Chelsea 1-1 Milan

The ref decides there was seven seconds of added time, which seems fair. Or 
maybe he just wants to get out and see the treats that Minneapolis has to 
offer. Anyway, 1-1 is a fair scoreline at the half -Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> dominated early with Moses and 
Traore offering plenty of attack but that lovely free-kick boosted Milan as the 
clock ticked down.

GOAL! Chelsea 1-1 Milan (Bonaventura 39)

This time Courtois can’t do anything about Milan’s shot though. A brilliant 
free-kick from Bonaventura curls round the wall and beats the Belgian at his 
near post. Not much Courtois could have done about it though - it was a 
stunning shot.

32 min: Milan enjoy a reasonable bout of pressure - their best of the match - 
and a good cross is played into Niang. Aina gets to the ball first though and 
heads over his own bar.Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> 
much the sharper team both in defence and in attack at the moment. Azpilicueta 
then tries a long-range shot, which is beautifully struck, but drifts wide of 
the post.

29 min: It looks like Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> 
may score again but a) it’s offside and b) Matic’s volley is well saved. A 
quick free-kick from Fabregas created the chance, the Milan players seemed to 
be having a pre-season nap at the time.

GOAL Chelsea 1-0 Milan (Traore 25)

Little surprise it’s Traore with the first goal. A long throw is played on to 
Moses, whose low shot is parried by Donnarumma. Traore is unmarked and taps the 
ball into an empty net.

19 min: After that scare, Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are content to pass the ball 
around at the back. Are they playing for a draw already? In a pre-season 
friendly?

16 min: Milan drift a shot across the Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> goal but no one is there to tap 
the shot in. “I can safely say you’ve got at least two people following this 
match. One’s in Canada and the other’s in Australia,” says Salman Amjad. “I 
guess we could call that a global audience.” And I’m in the US so we only need 
another 190 or so and we have the UN. If Donald Trump still thinks the US 
should be in the UN.

13 min: Costa is nearly in but Palette scoots in quick to clear for a throw 
in. A free-kick ensues and it’s a beautifully flighted ball on to the head of 
Costa, who is five yards out. His header fails to cause any problems though - a 
bad miss.

9 min: The teams exchange blows in midfield but the pace is slow as the game 
takes shape. Tom Maxwell has some consoling words in my soon to be 16 hour day: 
“I’d just sack it off personally... Surely anyone who really cares about the 
match enough to stay up until 3-4AM to watch it, is probably actually watching 
it? Beer and bed I reckon.” Sack it off? When there’s the possibility of this 
going to penalties? Never!

3 min: Diego Costa gets a blow to the head, which takes the “friendly” out of 
this pre-season friendly pretty damn sharpish. Everyone stays friends for now

1 min: And we’re off at the MetLife, Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> with an early attack down the 
left and Courtois has to save well from Paletta. I would bring you in-depth 
analysis of the build-up to this match but I was watching the Mets-Yankees game 
until about 10 minutes ago when I was called in as a last-minute sub when our 
other writer’s internet failed. I can, however, tell you that the Mets are 
unable to manufacture a run with runners in scoring position. Pathologically so.

Hello, and apologies for the late start. Internet issues mean Aaron is unable 
to do tonight’s report, so I’m stepping in. I started work 14 hours ago, so you

Aaron will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s Paul Doyle on Chelsea’s 
outlook for the new season:

Chelsea did not defend their title last season so much as prosecute it for 
fraud, so it is going to be fascinating to see what sort of case they put 
forward this time. Their new manager,Antonio Conte 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/14/antonio-conte-john-terry-winning-title-working-hard-being-a-tailor-chelsea-manager>
, has a gleaming record, a shrewd approach to tactics and a maniacal will to 
win, but it is not yet clear that he has the players to make good on his 
declared intention to transform Chelsea into a “little war machine”.

Some players appeared on their last legs last season while others seemed plain 
lily-livered or had their hearts and minds elsewhere. Conte will have to wring 
improved performances from at least some of those or promote from the youth 
ranks and use the transfer market. Probably he will try to do all three in 
varying doses; if he gets it right in a division in which all rivals also 
appear to have flaws, thenChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>
 could conceivably be champions again. But if he doesn’t find a winning formula 
quickly, then they could remain estranged from the top four, a currently 
high-flying manager could be sent on his bike and there will be a belated mass 
purge at Stamford Bridge.

Two causes for optimism arrived in the persons of Chelsea’s two major player 
recruits,Michy Batshuayi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/03/chelsea-announce-signing-michy-batshuayi>
 andN’Golo Kanté 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/16/chelsea-confirm-signing-ngolo-kante-leicester-city>
, both of whom look well suited to Conte’s forceful style. Paying £33m for a 
striker who is not fully polished shows the level to which inflation has 
climbed but Batshuayi has the potential to make a big impact on the Premier 
League and does not seem inclined to distract himself with senseless spoiling 
for a fight, which gives him an edge on Diego Costa for one.

One thing that seems certain about Conte’s planned formation is that it will 
include two strikers, as the manager ends Chelsea’s long preference for a lone 
forward fulcrum. The Italian has also hinted that he is open to ending Costa’s 
tetchy relationship with the club, a move that seems in everyone’s interests, 
and that could lead to Batshuayi being partnered by a new arrival – or a 
returnee if Chelsea prise back Romelu Lukaku from Everton. Conte would then 
have to demonstrate his coaching skills by honing the two young Belgians into a 
consistently deadly strikeforce; and if the manager can do likewise with the 
gifted Bertrand Traoré, thenChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> would have fearsome and very 
fast attacking options before there is any need to wonder about Loïc Rémy’s 
ability to contribute.

And that’s it. A comfortable win for Chelsea. The game was even - in scoreline 
and performances - at half-time butChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> were by far the better team in 
the second 45 minutes, with Oscar and Hazard in particular causing problems for 
the Italians.
 
90 min: Two minutes of added time.
 
And Oscar gets his second. He scampers between his markers on to a ball from 
Cuadrado and beats Donnarumma at his near post with a low shot. Nice finish, 
and a great appearance from the bench for Oscar.
 
85 min: Batshuayi finds space in the area but he loses control, lunges for the 
ball and fouls his marker.
 
82 min: I’m not saying the amount of subs in these games are ridiculous but 
Maldini, Costacurta, Baresi, Rivera and Tassotti come on forMilan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>. Or so it seems.
 
78 min: Hazard’s nose looks fine! So he has failed to break his own nose. A 
good failure all in all.
 
76 min: Unfortunate Injuries Department: Hazard blasts the ball in the general 
direction of theMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> goal, the 
shot is blocked and rebounds back into his face. He goes down with what looks 
like a broken nose. At least he knows he has a powerful shot though.
 
73 min: Hazard is starting to stretch the Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> defence - he’s fouled twice in 
the space of two minutes, and in a Champions League game the challenges would 
have resulted in yellows.
 
Oscar makes no mistakes: he steps up, stops, starts ... and blasts the ball 
home.
 
Azpilicueta’s cross is handled and the ref points to the spot!
 
66 min: Cahill rises to meet a (who else?) Willian corner but he gets under 
the ball and the law of physics state the ball must go up and up and up. WHich 
is good news for the laws of the universe but bad news for Chelsea’s hopes of 
taking the lead.
 
62 min: Abate is off and is replaced by Montolivo. In non-substitution news, 
the excellent Niang gets free and squares the ball across the face of goal but 
noMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> players attack the space 
and the danger passes.
 
59 min: Fabregas comes off for Oscar. 
 
58 min: Willian goes on an unopposed run down the right and crashes in a shot 
at Donnarumma, who leaves a little too much room at the near post. But the 
keeper makes up for it, regaining his positioning to pull off a great 
one-handed save.
 
54 min: Abate scurries up the right flank but Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> stop him before he can cause too 
much damage. Or any damage.
 
51 min: Hazard and Kante are on for Traore and Moses, who both had good first 
halfs.
 
48 min: Oh! Chance for Milan! Niang holds the ball up on the edge of the area 
with impressive strength and squares it to Abate but it doesn’t come off. Then 
Niang has another chance but his shot flashes wide. Two good chances, with 
Niang at the centre of both of them butMilan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> can’t exploit either.
 
46 min: And we’re back again. “I confess to having no interest in this match 
or the two teams involved,” says Phil Withall. “However I feel obliged to 
follow it now in solidarity with you. I’m a sucker for overworked journalists, 
they’re like pictures of sad puppies.”
 
The ref decides there was seven seconds of added time, which seems fair. Or 
maybe he just wants to get out and see the treats that Minneapolis has to 
offer. Anyway, 1-1 is a fair scoreline at the half -Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> dominated early with Moses and 
Traore offering plenty of attack but that lovely free-kick boosted Milan as the 
clock ticked down.

<https://twitter.com/ACMilanSverige/status/761026264505331713>  
43 min: Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> seem to have been 
revived by that goal and are finishing the half the stronger team.
 
This time Courtois can’t do anything about Milan’s shot though. A brilliant 
free-kick from Bonaventura curls round the wall and beats the Belgian at his 
near post. Not much Courtois could have done about it though - it was a 
stunning shot.
 
35 min: Courtois has a little trouble tracking a swirling shot from Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>, but just about punches it to 
safety.
 
32 min: Milan enjoy a reasonable bout of pressure - their best of the match - 
and a good cross is played into Niang. Aina gets to the ball first though and 
heads over his own bar.Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> 
much the sharper team both in defence and in attack at the moment. Azpilicueta 
then tries a long-range shot, which is beautifully struck, but drifts wide of 
the post.
 
29 min: It looks like Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> 
may score again but a) it’s offside and b) Matic’s volley is well saved. A 
quick free-kick from Fabregas created the chance, the Milan players seemed to 
be having a pre-season nap at the time.
 
27 min: Milan try to hit back quickly – they win a corner but Azpilicueta is 
fouled in theChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> area and 
the Blues are free to clear.
 
Little surprise it’s Traore with the first goal. A long throw is played on to 
Moses, whose low shot is parried by Donnarumma. Traore is unmarked and taps the 
ball into an empty net.
 
23 min: Corner for Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, 
which Fabregas fires across but Cahill is called for the foul and Milan can 
clear.
 
21 min: Traore, who has looked good for Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> tonight, tries a first-time shot 
and Donnarumma eventually handles it safely. Not the most convincing of saves.
 
19 min: After that scare, Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are content to pass the ball 
around at the back. Are they playing for a draw already? In a pre-season 
friendly?
 
16 min: Milan drift a shot across the Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> goal but no one is there to tap 
the shot in. “I can safely say you’ve got at least two people following this 
match. One’s in Canada and the other’s in Australia,” says Salman Amjad. “I 
guess we could call that a global audience.” And I’m in the US so we only need 
another 190 or so and we have the UN. If Donald Trump still thinks the US 
should be in the UN.
 
13 min: Costa is nearly in but Palette scoots in quick to clear for a throw 
in. A free-kick ensues and it’s a beautifully flighted ball on to the head of 
Costa, who is five yards out. His header fails to cause any problems though - a 
bad miss.
 
9 min: The teams exchange blows in midfield but the pace is slow as the game 
takes shape. Tom Maxwell has some consoling words in my soon to be 16 hour day: 
“I’d just sack it off personally... Surely anyone who really cares about the 
match enough to stay up until 3-4AM to watch it, is probably actually watching 
it? Beer and bed I reckon.” Sack it off? When there’s the possibility of this 
going to penalties? Never!
 
6 min: Traore causes some problems on the edge of the area, and wins a 
free-kick and a ripped shirt. Willian takes the set piece but it’s handled 
easily enough byMilan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan>.
 
3 min: Diego Costa gets a blow to the head, which takes the “friendly” out of 
this pre-season friendly pretty damn sharpish. Everyone stays friends for now 
and no punches, kicks or headbutts are exchanged.
 
1 min: And we’re off at the MetLife, Milan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> with an early attack down the 
left and Courtois has to save well from Paletta. I would bring you in-depth 
analysis of the build-up to this match but I was watching the Mets-Yankees game 
until about 10 minutes ago when I was called in as a last-minute sub when our 
other writer’s internet failed. I can, however, tell you that the Mets are 
unable to manufacture a run with runners in scoring position. Pathologically so.

Hello, and apologies for the late start. Internet issues mean Aaron is unable 
to do tonight’s report, so I’m stepping in. I started work 14 hours ago, so you 
can imagine this is an absolute thrill for me. Go Chelsea!
 
Aaron will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s Paul Doyle on Chelsea’s 
outlook for the new season:

Chelsea did not defend their title last season so much as prosecute it for 
fraud, so it is going to be fascinating to see what sort of case they put 
forward this time. Their new manager,Antonio Conte 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/14/antonio-conte-john-terry-winning-title-working-hard-being-a-tailor-chelsea-manager>
, has a gleaming record, a shrewd approach to tactics and a maniacal will to 
win, but it is not yet clear that he has the players to make good on his 
declared intention to transform Chelsea into a “little war machine”.

Some players appeared on their last legs last season while others seemed plain 
lily-livered or had their hearts and minds elsewhere. Conte will have to wring 
improved performances from at least some of those or promote from the youth 
ranks and use the transfer market. Probably he will try to do all three in 
varying doses; if he gets it right in a division in which all rivals also 
appear to have flaws, thenChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>
 could conceivably be champions again. But if he doesn’t find a winning formula 
quickly, then they could remain estranged from the top four, a currently 
high-flying manager could be sent on his bike and there will be a belated mass 
purge at Stamford Bridge.

Two causes for optimism arrived in the persons of Chelsea’s two major player 
recruits,Michy Batshuayi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/03/chelsea-announce-signing-michy-batshuayi>
 andN’Golo Kanté 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/16/chelsea-confirm-signing-ngolo-kante-leicester-city>
, both of whom look well suited to Conte’s forceful style. Paying £33m for a 
striker who is not fully polished shows the level to which inflation has 
climbed but Batshuayi has the potential to make a big impact on the Premier 
League and does not seem inclined to distract himself with senseless spoiling 
for a fight, which gives him an edge on Diego Costa for one.

One thing that seems certain about Conte’s planned formation is that it will 
include two strikers, as the manager ends Chelsea’s long preference for a lone 
forward fulcrum. The Italian has also hinted that he is open to ending Costa’s 
tetchy relationship with the club, a move that seems in everyone’s interests, 
and that could lead to Batshuayi being partnered by a new arrival – or a 
returnee if Chelsea prise back Romelu Lukaku from Everton. Conte would then 
have to demonstrate his coaching skills by honing the two young Belgians into a 
consistently deadly strikeforce; and if the manager can do likewise with the 
gifted Bertrand Traoré, thenChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> would have fearsome and very 
fast attacking options before there is any need to wonder about Loïc Rémy’s 
ability to contribute.
