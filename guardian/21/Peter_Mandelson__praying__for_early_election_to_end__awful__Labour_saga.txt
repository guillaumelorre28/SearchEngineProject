quickest way of oustingJeremy Corbyn

party.

Appearing at a Royal Television Society conference in London, the former 
cabinet minister was asked how likely it would be for Theresa May to call an 
early election in an attempt to increase the Conservative party’s majority.

“Bring it on so we can deal with the awful situation in the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party earlier than 2020,” he said.

Mandelson, a close ally of Tony Blair and architect of New Labour, suggested 
he was hoping for an early defeat for Labour underits newly re-elected leader

.

Mandelson didn’t mention Corbyn by name, but on the question of whether there 
would be an early election, he said: “I get up every day and pray that will be 
the case.”

Speaking at a session on the impact of the UK’s vote to leave the EU, 
Mandelson said both Conservative and Labour politicians were over-reacting to 
the apparent unpopularity of European migration.

He said: “Because of the revolution in identity politics that we saw engulfing 
the country during the course of the referendum – affecting not just the 
Conservatives but Labour too – there are many, many politicians who are so 
running scared of freedom of movement that they are showing signs of being 
prepared to sacrifice any national economic interest just to meet the public’s 
concern over freedom of movement.”

He added: “People are saying ‘let’s throw all the rules up in the air, it 
doesn’t matter where they land, as long as we don’t have freedom of movement’ – 
that would be taking Britain to hell in a handcart.”

The former European trade commissioner said he feared the government would opt 
for hard Brexit, with no freedom of movement. But he said he was encouraged that
the government itself appeared torn on the issue

.

“The government is still negotiating with itself and it hasn’t begun 
negotiating with anyone else. Behind the appearance of calm there is tremendous 
turmoil going on. I would draw encouragement from that because positions and 
different approaches are still being contested.”

Mandelson argued that a more pragmatic approach to Brexit “could result in our 
creating an entirely new, positive and cooperative relationship with Europe”.

But he added that hardliners in the cabinet “fear that with every month that 
passes in which article 50 is not triggered clever civil servants are going to 
come up with some more sensible alternative for the country. And they don’t 
want it.”

Mandelson said leaving the EU will be “the most complex policy exercise 
mounted in peace time”.

He added: “Our economy after 40 years of close progressive integration has 
become almost entirely reshaped around the opportunity offered by Europe’s 500 
million [population] single market. We are talking about nearly half our trade 
in this one European market. So you are talking potentially about a loss of 
access, loss of funding, loss of access to talent and loss of influence over 
regulation, which even if you are outside the EU you will still be exposed to 
because you are offering services to that market.”
