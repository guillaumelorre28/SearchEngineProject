Well I asked for a festival of goals, and it egged all over me. Lovely. Result 
of the night unmistakably wasPeterborough 2-3 Kidderminster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/14/peterborough-kidderminster-harriers-fa-cup-third-round-replay>
, shame the TV cameras didn't take a punt on the non-league boys, instead of a 
boringFulham 3-0 Norwich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/14/fulham-norwich-city-fa-cup-third-round-replay>
 affair.

Bye!

Still, thanks for all your emails and that. Congrats to B-Russ for the 
half-time pub quiz victory and if you were wondering ...

Full time: MK Dons 1-3 Wigan

The holders are through after an extra-time win!

10.13pm GMT 

113 min: Wigan coasting now. Reports are coming in that they are going to sign 
Nicky Maynard to replace the outgoing Grant Holt. Looks a decent bit of 
business, that. He scored a lot of goals for a poorBristol City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolcity> side a couple of years back 
in the Championship.

10.08pm GMT 

Bit of news from Rene Meulensteen at Fulham press conference following their 
3-0 win over Norwich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/14/fulham-norwich-city-fa-cup-third-round-replay>
.

Manager confirmed they have made West Ham an offer for Ravel Morrison. It has 
been turned down, apparently. That £67,500 has really gone to their heads.

. Enjoy.

10.03pm GMT 

Goal! MK Dons 1-3 Wigan (Fortuné 105)

Looks like game over in Milton Keynes, the holders are through to home tie 
against Crystal Palace. No penalty eggs for me. Or you. Not sure how that would 
play out on an MBM actually.

Updated at 10.05pm GMT

10.02pm GMT 

Whilst I'm waiting for MK Dons <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> v 
Wigan updates - let's reflect on Kidderminster, without doubt the result of the 
night. Congrats! Joe Lolley got the winner for the Harriers, but is reportedly 
on his way to Huddersfield.

"We're in discussions and feel we're very close to concluding a deal," 
Huddersfield chairman Dean Hoyle confirmed. Booo! Surely stick around for 
Sunderland?

9.51pm GMT 

95 min: I've only really seen Wigan in the Europa League this season, but Nick 
Powell, on loan from Man Utd, has impressed me every time. That's his ninth of 
the season from midfield.

9.49pm GMT 

Goal! MK Dons 1-2 Wigan (Powell 93)

Powell gets his second of the game! If only that were a silver egg, Wigan 
would only have 12 mins to see out until half-time extra-time.

Hooper aside, this was a strong side but they were toothless after the first

They have just signed Jonás Gutiérrez on loan though ...

Norwich's (now more than three, apparently) bellow out: "City til I die, I'm 
City til I die!" Steve must be pissed.

9.14pm GMT 

Goal! Fulham 3-0 Norwich (Sidwell 68)

Game over. Simple cross, again from Norwich's left, is curled to the back post 
and Steve Sidwell rises well above David Fox to head past Bunn. Sidwell has 
been excellent today, tackling as hassling all of Norwich's midfield three and 
looking composed on the ball.

Honourable mentions for the Half-time pub quiz go to David Hopkins, Peter 
Burden, Jonathan Hawke, Matt Shelton and Tom Carding who were all correct, but 
slower than B-Russ.

Half time pub quiz

There are eight cities in England with more than one Premier League/Football

Half time.

At least at Craven Cottage. After a bright Norwich start, Fulham have settled, 
their two goals coming from good work down the right. 2-0. 

Updated at 8.42pm GMT

8.29pm GMT 

Goal! Fulham 2-0 Norwich (Dejagah 41)

A very similar goal to the first. This time Kacaniklic is given a slide rule 
pass down Norwich's left - the Swede looks up and squares across the six-yard 
box to Dejagah to tucks an easy finish past Bunn. That was too easy, and 
Norwich are looking completely devoid of confidence.

This seems as good a time as any to post this ...

28 min: It's been all Fulham since the goal. Kacaniklic is being a particular 
thorn in Norwich side, and a stud in Russell Martin's leg as the Swede follows 
through on a tackle.

Goal! Fulham 1-0 Norwich (Bent 14)

That record looks set to continue. Bent scores a typical poachers finish, 
Kasami cutting the ball back down the right, and Norwich's defence deciding 
they didn't want to get anywhere near Bent, who lashed* home from about 8 
yards. Bent scored at Carrow road as well.

Taarabt (on the bench) so Kasami steps up. Straight at Bunn in the Norwich goal.

PRESSURE

Mark Judd piles on the pressure. 'I think you’ll find that as soon as fans 
discover the match is subject to MBM coverage then they will eschew the lure of 
watching the game live and follow the match via the magic prose of The Guardian 
MBMer. No pressure.'

7.49pm GMT 

2 min: Norwich are off to a flyer! Nathan Redmond has a shot well saved by 
Maarten Stekelenburg with Snodgrass collecting the rebound, cutting in on that 
lovely left, and bends one onto the crossbar! Very close

Peep peep!

Team news - Fulham

As mentioned, for the smaller teams, replays are another payday, for the 
larger ones, another 90mins to knacker out what is left of your injury-prone 
and knackered squad – Fulham travel to top of the table Arsenal on Saturday in 
the Premier League and that's reflected by leaving out both Berbs and Scott 
Parker tonight.

Particularly interesting is their centre-back pairing - Hangeland returning to 
the side for the first time in three months partners Dan Burn, just his second 
appearance for Fulham following his debut in the1-1 FA Cup draw against Norwich

7.11pm GMT 

In my mind, the only silver goal/replay alternatives are:

'The Rouge', from the Sheffield Rules of 1862: in the event of a draw, an 
additional goal area is designated on either side of the goalposts, marked by 
flags. Teams would then score points for any shots passing through the area 
between the post and the flags.

or ... 

NASL shootoff. Basically a one-on-one competition in which a player has five 
seconds to score from 35 seconds. Simple, but class. Finished compeitively in 
1999.

Question ... <http://youtu.be/PJKze_ukrXY?t=18s>

How do y'all feel about replays anyway? It's an FA Cup tradition as old as 
time, but personally, I am a BIG fan of single legs and extra time, where the 
game is either stretched beyond all realms of tactical intention, or attack v 
defense, the latter holding out for the promised land of a penalty shootout.

Apart from the choice I make when I draw with one of my mates playing FIFA, it 
is a decision I have little control over, but if I had my way, I'd bring back 
the silver goal. Not as finite as the golden egg, but a hammerblow nonetheless. 
I may or may not be referring to goals as eggs for the remainder of the evening.

The Euro 2004 semi-final between Greece and Czech Republic remains the only 
competitive match to have been decided by a silver goal. My reckoning is that 
if there had been a replay, the Greeks would probably never have lifted the 
trophy that year.

Do you prefer the golden egg? Do you enjoy the replay? Have you any replay 
memories from yesteryear? Holla.

Preamble

£67,500. That's the amount of FA prize money on offer for each team for 
winning tonight. That will only help Fulham payDimitar Berbatov's wages 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/30/fulham-manchester-united-dimitar-berbatov>
 for just over four days if they can beat Norwich tonight but for the likes of 
Kiddersminster and Macclesfield (who need £150,000 before the end of the season 
to remain afloat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/04/macclesfield-town-sheffield-wednesday-fa-cup>
), it would mean considerably more.

Last year's triumph for Wigan aside, the FA Cup is less romance and less 
magic; more cold, hard cash. The money from TV, from MBMs (cough) and from 
attendances in stadia far greater than their own is all a big lovely carrot for 
the boardrooms of the non-league (and lower league) lads.

But, rejoice! We are not chairmen of such teams (if you are, how's it going? 
Do get in touch)! We are the fans, who care of nothing else than GOALS GOALS 
GOALS, living and breathing every kick from the comfort of our sofas/train 
seats/beds, unless you are reading this on your phone from the terraces tonight 
(if so, how's it going? Do get in touch).

So get comfortable, pray that tonight's defenders are so tired from the 
congested fixture list that they forget how to defend, and enjoy this 
(potential) festival of goals, or at least a goalless draw that goes to 
penalties.
