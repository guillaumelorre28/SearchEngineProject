 leapfrogged them with wins later in the evening.

Madrid were without Ronaldo and Benzema because of hamstring problems. “We’ve 
been suffering with injuries, but the team has responded well,” said Sergio 
Ramos. “The players who have come in have played well, this has been key for 
us.”


Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> dominated from 
the start but had difficulties getting past Sociedad’s Argentine goalkeeper 
Gerónimo Rulli. “We knew it was going to be a difficult match, but we went for 
the win from the start,” Ramos said. “We created a lot of chances but just 
couldn’t capitalise on them.”

Bale had already missed a few good opportunities before finally scoring the 
winner in the northeastern city of San Sebastián. His best chance had been in 
the 57th, when he got to a loose ball inside the area but his low shot from 
near the penalty spot was blocked by Rulli.

Bale finally broke through by jumping highest to meet Vázquez’s cross from the 
right, sending the ball into the top corner.

Victories for La Liga’s top three leaves the title race impossibly tight with 
two matches remaining. Barcelona and Atlético are locked on 85 points – but 
Barça have a better head-to-head record – with Real a point further behind.
