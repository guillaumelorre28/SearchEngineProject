I think the Press Association’s man on the scene had a good time.

That's it. Curzon 3 Wimbledon 4. One of the most amazing football matches I've 
ever seen.

Tom Elliott talks to BT Sport

I’ve got no works for this. It was a hard game. They had their game plan and 
brought it to us and fair play to them, they went three goals up. We’ve dug 
deep, and we’re in the third round. That’s what the club’s built on – 
comebacks, never giving up, determination, motivation.

Final score: Curzon Ashton 3-4 AFC Wimbledon

That has got to hurt. Neal Ardley doesn’t just shake the hand of his opposite 
number, John Flanagan, but full-on embraces him. Incredible drama, but that was 
sheer cruelty.

GOAL! Curzon Ashton 3-4 AFC Wimbledon (Elliott, 94 mins)

With perhaps the last kick of the game, Wimbledon win it! They have a 
free-kick on the half-way line which is punted into the box, and Elliott leaps 
to flick it perfectly into the corner of the net! And he was looking the other 
way as he did it!

90+4 mins: A sniff of a chance for Reeves at the death, but Woodford defends 
it excellently, and then dummies two Wimbledon players to stroll out of 
defence. That was classy.

GOAL! Curzon Ashton 3-3 AFC Wimbledon (Barnett, 82 mins)

And this one’s just quality! Reeves crosses from the right, and Barnett heads 
it perfectly back across goal and in at the far post! The comeback is complete, 
and it didn’t take long!

GOAL! Curzon Ashton 3-2 AFC Wimbledon (Poleon, 82 mins)

And they get another! It’s almost identical to their first, though this corner 
is from the other flank. Again Burton comes for it, again he doesn’t reach it, 
and again it’s an easy finish!

GOAL! Curzon Ashton 3-1 AFC Wimbledon (Elliott, 80 mins)

Another corner, and Burton comes out in a mad dash for this one, tries a 
one-handed superman leap in an attempt to punch it clear with his left fish, 
misses it completely and from that moment if it fell to any Wimbledon player a 
goal was inevitable. It lands at the feet of Elliott, who turns it in.

79 mins: Burton have just hogged the ball for about two minutes, playing out 
of defence, working the ball to the left wing, passing it about a bit and then 
finally crossing too close to Shea, who collects. Lovely play.

76 mins: Ashton might have got a penalty there! The ball’s played in to 
Cummins, who is taken down in the area. The referee insists Robertson got some 
of the ball as he slid in – and replays suggest he was right, as well.

73 mins: How did Wimbledon not score here? From the corner Howard blocks, 
Robinson heads the rebound towards goal, it’s stopped on the line – well, 
halfway over it – and then amid a massive scramble a follow-up shot hits Burton 
in the leg as it also headed towards goal!

72 mins: Another long ball by Wimbledon, flicked on towards the penalty area, 
and this time Burton comes and doesn’t get there. It’s all a bit of a muddle, 
but the ball ends up deflected behind for a corner.

69 mins: Strange, this. Does this fan normally come to matches hoping they’re 
nice and boring? Should they perhaps take up fishing instead?

excitement. We've always said Curzon gets your heart racing!

GOAL! Curzon Ashton 3-0 AFC Wimbledon (Morgan, 63 mins)

From nowhere, a third! Excellent work here from Guest, who turns what is at 
best a 50/50 ball bouncing down the left flank into a fine chance. He jumps 
ahead of Fuller, runs clear down the left, looks up and picks out Morgan, who 
sidefoots in from 10 yards!

60 mins: Missed chance! A long ball is flicked on to Taylor, whose half-volley 
from 15 yards flies wide of the near post! A good chance that, although had he 
shot towards the other corner it would probably have hit the defender 
desperately throwing himself in his direction.

59 mins: Guest gives the ball away to Parrett, and then hacks the player down 
in his desperation to get it back. Ashton can’t string two passes together at 
the moment.

58 mins: Super save! The corer ends up at the feet of Reeves, just outside the

53 mins: Wimbledon are doing plenty of attacking, but mess things up once they 
get close to goal. First someone tries an ambitious backheel, which a defenders 
gets to first and boots clear, and then Elliott hits a shot over the bar from 
an acute angle.

50 mins: Fuller gets to the right byline, but Hampson gives his arm a bit of a 
yank as he goes by and Fuller’s cross isn’t exactly helped by the fact he was 
falling over when he hit it, and goes out of play.

AFC Wimbledon score four times in final 10 minutes to foil Curzon Ashton

I think the Press Association’s man on the scene had a good time.
Mark Staniforth (@markstani1) 
That's it. Curzon 3 Wimbledon 4. One of the most amazing football matches I've 
ever seen.
 <https://twitter.com/markstani1/status/805410985762848768> December 4, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/markstani1/status/805410985762848768>  
Elliott was excellent with his head all day, a veritable fountain of 
flick-ons. But talk about saving the best till last …
 
Tom Elliott talks to BT Sport

I’ve got no works for this. It was a hard game. They had their game plan and 
brought it to us and fair play to them, they went three goals up. We’ve dug 
deep, and we’re in the third round. That’s what the club’s built on – 
comebacks, never giving up, determination, motivation.
 
That has got to hurt. Neal Ardley doesn’t just shake the hand of his opposite 
number, John Flanagan, but full-on embraces him. Incredible drama, but that was 
sheer cruelty.
 
With perhaps the last kick of the game, Wimbledon win it! They have a 
free-kick on the half-way line which is punted into the box, and Elliott leaps 
to flick it perfectly into the corner of the net! And he was looking the other 
way as he did it!

Richard Sellers/PA  
90+4 mins: A sniff of a chance for Reeves at the death, but Woodford defends 
it excellently, and then dummies two Wimbledon players to stroll out of 
defence. That was classy.
 
90+2 mins: What a chance! And the ball rolls inches wide! A mistake on the 
Ashton left allows Taylor to run down the right and cross low towards Barnett, 
who turns the ball just wide of the back stick!
 
90+1 mins: The fourth official raises his board, and there’ll be four added 
minutes, or thereabouts.
 
90 mins: According to BBC statistics, Wimbledon lead the corner count 14-1, 
which feels about right. They’ve had alot of them.
 
88 mins: Great save by Burton! A long throw bounces up and from close range 
Elliott heads high towards the far post, over Burton, but he tips it away and 
Poleon fluffs the rebound!
 
87 mins: Wimbledon’s three goals came within the space of two minutes and 43 
seconds.
 
86 mins: And now Alex Brown is going off, and Chris Rowney comes on.
 
84 mins: Ashton take off Guest, and bring on Jordan Wright.
 
And this one’s just quality! Reeves crosses from the right, and Barnett heads 
it perfectly back across goal and in at the far post! The comeback is complete, 
and it didn’t take long!

And they get another! It’s almost identical to their first, though this corner 
is from the other flank. Again Burton comes for it, again he doesn’t reach it, 
and again it’s an easy finish!
 Dominic Poleon scores his side’s second goal Photograph: Craig Brough/Reuters  
Another corner, and Burton comes out in a mad dash for this one, tries a 
one-handed superman leap in an attempt to punch it clear with his left fish, 
misses it completely and from that moment if it fell to any Wimbledon player a 
goal was inevitable. It lands at the feet of Elliott, who turns it in.
 
79 mins: Burton have just hogged the ball for about two minutes, playing out 
of defence, working the ball to the left wing, passing it about a bit and then 
finally crossing too close to Shea, who collects. Lovely play.
 
76 mins: Ashton might have got a penalty there! The ball’s played in to 
Cummins, who is taken down in the area. The referee insists Robertson got some 
of the ball as he slid in – and replays suggest he was right, as well.
 
73 mins: How did Wimbledon not score here? From the corner Howard blocks, 
Robinson heads the rebound towards goal, it’s stopped on the line – well, 
halfway over it – and then amid a massive scramble a follow-up shot hits Burton 
in the leg as it also headed towards goal!
 
72 mins: Another long ball by Wimbledon, flicked on towards the penalty area, 
and this time Burton comes and doesn’t get there. It’s all a bit of a muddle, 
but the ball ends up deflected behind for a corner.
 
69 mins: Strange, this. Does this fan normally come to matches hoping they’re 
nice and boring? Should they perhaps take up fishing instead?
Curzon Ashton Live (@CurzonLive) 
A Curzon fan has had to leave the stadium because he cannot cope with the 
excitement. We've always said Curzon gets your heart racing!

<https://twitter.com/CurzonLive/status/805398675325325313>  
65 mins: Confidence boosted, Ashton play some lovely stuff inside the 
Wimbledon half, though in the end nothing comes of it.
 
From nowhere, a third! Excellent work here from Guest, who turns what is at 
best a 50/50 ball bouncing down the left flank into a fine chance. He jumps 
ahead of Fuller, runs clear down the left, looks up and picks out Morgan, who 
sidefoots in from 10 yards!

Sellers/PA  
60 mins: Missed chance! A long ball is flicked on to Taylor, whose half-volley 
from 15 yards flies wide of the near post! A good chance that, although had he 
shot towards the other corner it would probably have hit the defender 
desperately throwing himself in his direction.
 
59 mins: Guest gives the ball away to Parrett, and then hacks the player down 
in his desperation to get it back. Ashton can’t string two passes together at 
the moment.
 
58 mins: Super save! The corer ends up at the feet of Reeves, just outside the 
area, and he sends a left-footed curler floating towards goal, but Burton tips 
it over!
 
57 mins: Poleon has a half-chance, but a defender throws himself in the way. 
And then another, which is also blocked.
 
56 mins: Three minutes of pressure from the visitors, who have had a corner 
from the left, a corner from the right and a long throw from the left. But no 
chances.
 
53 mins: Wimbledon are doing plenty of attacking, but mess things up once they 
get close to goal. First someone tries an ambitious backheel, which a defenders 
gets to first and boots clear, and then Elliott hits a shot over the bar from 
an acute angle.
 
50 mins: Fuller gets to the right byline, but Hampson gives his arm a bit of a 
yank as he goes by and Fuller’s cross isn’t exactly helped by the fact he was 
falling over when he hit it, and goes out of play.
 
46 mins: Wimbledon attack, 30-odd seconds into the half, but there’s no repeat 
of the first-half theatrics as Burton gets out well to grab the ball ahead of 
Poleon.
 
46 mins: Peeeeeeeep! The home side get the ball rolling in half two.
 
The players are coming back out. We’re 45 minutes away from a potentially 
hefty upset. Can the home side hold on? We’re about to find out!
 
45+3 mins: And that’s it for half one. The dream is on here. I’ll be back in a 
few moments.
 
45+2 mins: Parrett runs onto a bouncing ball in the penalty area, but then 
Woodford arrives and clears out both ball and player. Proper meaty challenge, 
that.
