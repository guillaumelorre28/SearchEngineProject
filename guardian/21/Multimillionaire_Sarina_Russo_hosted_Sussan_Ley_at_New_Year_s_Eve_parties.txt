Ley said the 2013 New Year’s Eve trip was “for a business lunch” and the 2014 
trip was to attend the businesswoman’s “annual New Year’s Eve event”.

In a statement on Monday, Russo backed Ley’s account and said “every time I 
met with her it related to her portfolio or the government at hand”.

Under the Abbott government Sarina Russo Job Access won two major federal 
government contracts with the department of education and training through open 
tender.

The contracts in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory were 
worth $41.2m

 and$4.4m respectively 
<https://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.cn.view&CNUUID=011E98ED-0F4E-8857-D4DC18EDF6485EF1>
. They began in June and July 2015 and expire in June 2018.

Sarina Russo Job Access is a provider of Jobactive services, which include job 
placement and the work for the dole scheme. The contractsreportedly helped 
Russo expand her business

 from 25 to 95 offices to provide Jobactive and apprenticeship programs for job 
seekers.

In her statement, Russo heaped praise on Ley saying she respected and admired 
her, and Ley had “worked diligently in every portfolio and has made a 
difference”.

“Our focus should be to continue to make AUSTRALIA [sic] great and this is 
what the minister has always done.”

Russo said she was happy to support the investigation into Ley’s travel 
expenses, if required.

In June 2015 Russo posted a photo of herself with Ley, commenting that the 
then health and sport minister was “a great believer that health equates to 
loving your job or at least having a job”.

In 2015 BRW listed Russo on its Rich Women list 
<http://www.afr.com/leadership/brw-lists/brw-rich-women-2015-20160303-gn9ekf>, 
ranking her 13th with wealth of $103m. Russo’s companies have donated to both 
major political parties. Most recently, Sarina Russo Job Accessmade two $1,100 
payments <http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/Returns/56/TQFV3.pdf> to the 
Labor Party in 2014-15, listed as other receipts.

In June 2010 Sarina Russo Job Access donated $20,000 to the federal Liberal 
party <http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/Returns/24/NZPD1.pdf>.

Asked at a press conference in Albury about the purpose of the 2013 meeting on 
the Gold Coast with the businesswoman, Ley said it was to discuss the incoming
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> government’s 
“agenda around particular education and training issues”.

She said the meeting had “reflected on what the government could do to make 
sure that we recognised the needs of everyone in these important areas”.

“So what I’m saying is they were business conversations and they were 
important conversations to the future of our government’s agenda.”

Ley said she was “very confident” the investigation would show she had not 
broken travel entitlement rules, including that the two New Year’s Eve trips 
were for government business. The investigation was sparked after the 
revelation Ley had charged taxpayers for a trip to the Gold Coast for 
government business during which she boughta $795,000 apartment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/06/sussan-ley-bought-apartment-impulse-taxpayer-funded-trip>
 as an investment property.

The trip brought to light extensive taxpayer-funded travel to the Gold Coast 
by the health minister, including 37 nights’ accommodation since 2013 and 27 
flights in and out of the Gold Coast over the same period.

Ley apologised and offered to pay back travel claims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/08/sussan-ley-apologises-over-gold-coast-luxury-apartment-scandal>
 for the trip on which she bought the apartment and three travel expenses on 
other trips to the Gold Coast.
