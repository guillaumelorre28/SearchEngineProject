Buffon overtook Sebastiano Rossi’s previous record of 929 minutes for Milan, 
set in the 1993-94 season, in the fourth minute although he was finally beaten 
early in the second half when Andrea Belotti converted a penalty forTorino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino>.

Belotti’s goal meant that Buffon’s run ended at 974 minutes but Juventus were 
already 2-0 ahead by then thanks to a free-kick by Paul Pogba and a breakaway 
goal by Sami Khedira before half-time.

Maxi López was denied an equaliser for Torino when his effort was ruled out 
for offside and Álvaro Morata added two more for Juventus, who are chasing a 
fifth successive title. Juventus moved on to 70 points, six clear of 
second-placed Napoli going into their match with Genoa later on Sunday.
