 season.

The visitors hit the woodwork through Martin Woods but the midfielder lost 
possession in the 36th minute to allow 18-year-old Greg Kiltie to pounce and 
score the opening goal.

The Staggies in-form striker Liam Boyce equalised in the 63rd minute with his 
seventh goal in seven games when he met a Marcus Fraser cross at the near post. 
He then set up substitute Rocco Quinn, on at the interval for Woods, to make it 
2-1 in the 77th minute to leave the Dingwall club three points clear of Killie.

St Mirren exited the Premiership with a 1-0 defeat at Hamilton in Gary Teale’s 
final game in charge before Ian Murray takes up the managers position at the 
Buddies. A clinical finish from Ali Crawford low past Marian Kello seven 
minutes from the final whistle was enough for Martin Canning’s men to secure 
victory in what has been a solid first season back in the top-flight.

Motherwell played out a goalless draw at home to Partick Thistle with 
Motherwell’s John Sutton and Thistle’s Gary Fraser the only players to 
seriously threaten a goal.

Motherwell’s manager, Ian Baraclough, made nine changes as he rested the 
majority of his experienced players for Thursday’s first leg play-off final at 
Rangers.

“We’ll go there with a belief that we can come away with something to go for 
in the second leg,” Baraclough told BBC Scotland. “The players need to come 
away from both games knowing that they could not have given any more.”
