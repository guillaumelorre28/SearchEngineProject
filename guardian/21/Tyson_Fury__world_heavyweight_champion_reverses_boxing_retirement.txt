Having first announced he was retiring from boxing on Monday, Tyson Fury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tyson-fury> then claimed he was “here to 
stay” just hours later after an apparent change of heart.

The reigning world heavyweight champion, who last month pulled out of his 
proposed rematch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/tyson-fury-wladimir-klitschko-rematch-called-off>
 with Wladimir Klitschko citing mental health issues, tweeted on Monday that he 
will retire despite never having defended his titles.

He said on Twitter that “Boxing is the saddest thing I ever took part in,” 
before claiming it was “all a pile of shit”. In the same tweet, he then 
apparently hung up his gloves: “I’m the greatest, & I’m also retired, so go 
suck a dick, happy days”.

However the 28-year-old then released another tweet three hours later which 
reversed his decision, while also criticising the media for reporting his 
earlier announcement. “Hahahaha u think you will get rid of the GYPSYKING that 
easy!!! I’m here to stay. #TheGreatest just shows u what the Medea [sic] are 
like. Tut tut,” he wrote.

Peter Fury, his trainer and uncle, said last Sunday that the boxer is 
receiving professional help for issues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/25/tyson-fury-peter-fury-wladimir-klitschko>
 that have arisen as a result of what he called a “witch-hunt” against him 
following his victory.

On Friday it was reported that Fury had failed a drugs test after a random 
urine test on 22 September tested positive for the substance benzoylecgonine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/tyson-fury-tests-positive-cocaine-unlikely-to-be-banned>
, the central compound found in cocaine. Fury pulled out of the rematch against 
Klitschko a day after the test.

Fury also responded to the reports about that positive test on Twitter by 
posting a cryptic photograph 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/01/tyson-fury-cocaine-al-pacino-scarface-tony-montana-tweet>
. It showed Al Pacino’s character from the film Scarface, Tony Montana, sitting 
with a pile of cocaine on a table in front of him. Fury superimposed his face 
on to the picture, with the hashtag #Tysonmontana, which did little to clear up 
the confusion surrounding the reports.

Fury, who was stripped of his IBF title when it became clear he planned to 
face Klitschko again instead of the mandatory challenger Vyacheslav Glazkov, 
had postponed the first defence of his WBO and WBA titles from July because of 
an ankle injury. By that point he had already offended many by making sexist, 
homophobic and antisemitic comments, but he apologised for those andinsisted he 
is “in no way a racist or bigot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/16/tyson-fury-aplogises-offensive-comments>
”.

Since his ankle injury, Fury’s career – which held such promise in his 
position as the world’s leading heavyweight – has suffered significant damage. 
Reports emerged thatalleged he had failed a test  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/26/tyson-fury-heavyweight-champion-baffled-drugs-test-nandrolone>
for the banned substance nandrolone, allegations he denied and responded to 
through his legal team,who spoke of plans to sue UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/02/tyson-fury-suing-uk-anti-doping-over-nandrolone-allegations>
.

He missed a press conference last month to promote his rematch with Klitschko, 
when his manager, Mick Hennessy,said his car had broken down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/tyson-fury-wladimir-klitschko> 
and his mobile phone had run out of battery.

At that time Klitschko cast doubt over the 29 October date taking place, with 
a hearing for his alleged doping violation scheduled for November, before 
insisting he was prepared to wait for their rematch. Fury then withdrew from 
the fight amid doubts over whether he would consequently be stripped of his WBO 
and WBA titles, and most recently it was reported he had tested positive for 
cocaine.

It remains to be seen whether, as a high-profile and talented fighter, he can 
be tempted to return to a sport in which he retains a high value. The 
revelation will simplify the dilemma faced by sanctioning bodies the WBO and 
WBA. In retirement, Fury’s titles routinely become vacant, increasing the 
likelihood Klitschko will fight for them.

Early indications suggest Anthony Joshua could fight Klitschko  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/anthony-joshua-wladimir-klitschko-heavyweight-unification-fight-barry-hearns>
for one or more of Fury’s belts in what would be an unexpected multi-title 
world heavyweight fight potentially slated for November.
