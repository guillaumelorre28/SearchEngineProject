Second-placed Borussia Dortmund 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund> beat their hosts Mainz 
05 2-0 on Friday in their coach Thomas Tuchel’s return to his former club, 
ending their three-game winless run in the Bundesliga as they closed the gap on 
Bayern Munich.

Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead in the 18th minute but the Germany 
international, criticised for a string of weak performances recently for club 
and country, saw his second-half penalty saved as Dortmund wasted several good 
chance to score.

They had to wait until Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s close-range effort in the 82nd 
minute to make the points safe.

Dortmund’s first league win since 23 September took them to 20 points, four 
behind Bayern who take on Werder Bremen on Saturday.

It was the first time back at Mainz for Tuchel, who had a successful five-year 
spell at the club with two Europa League qualifications before an acrimonious 
split last season and a one-year sabbatical.

But the 42-year-old Dortmund coach had to endure a nervous game with his 
players wasteful once more this season and Mainz hitting the woodwork.

Reus put the visitors ahead with his third goal of the season after a fine 
combination between Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who missed out on 
setting a league record of scoring in 11 consecutiveBundesliga

Instead of adding another, the out-of-form Reus had his penalty saved by 
Mainz’s Loris Karius and the player, along with Aubameyang and Shinji Kagawa, 
squandered half a dozen more opportunities before Mkhitaryan rounded the keeper 
to seal their sixth victory in nine matches eight minutes from time.
