Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> blasted 
hapless Hamburg 8-0 to maintain their eight-point cushion at the top of the 
Bundesliga.

Thomas Müller, Arjen Robben and Mario Götze each scored twice, while Robert 
Lewandowski and Franck Ribéry grabbed the others to sinkHamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg>, who were beaten 9-2 in the same 
fixture two seasons ago. Saturday’s win was Bayern’s biggest in the league for 
30 years and Hamburg’s heaviest-ever top-flight defeat.

Müller, Götze and Robben put Bayern 3-0 up midway through the first half in 
front of a 75,000 full house at the Allianz Arena, and after the break the home 
side ran riot. Robben scored moments into the half before Müller doubled his 
tally with a fine long-range strike and Lewandowski joined the party with a tap 
in.

Ribéry scored the seventh after coming on as a substitute on his return from 
injury before Götze completed the rout with a superb right-foot shot a couple 
of minutes from time.

Bayern will travel to Shakhtar Donetsk in confident mood for the first leg of 
their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday. Pep Guardiola, the Bayern coach, 
said: “We played well. Our build-up was quicker than in the last couple of 
games. I’m happy that we’re back to our way of playing. Now we’re focusing on 
the Champions League.”

“When you play like that … it’s enjoyable,” said the Bayern midfielder Bastian 
Schweinsteiger. “We worked well, kept it simple and moved well and that makes 
it easier.”

Josef Zinnbauer, the Hamburg coach, said it was “a day I won’t forget for my 
whole life”.
