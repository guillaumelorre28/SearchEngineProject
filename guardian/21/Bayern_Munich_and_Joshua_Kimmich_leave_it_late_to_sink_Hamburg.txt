Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> needed an 
88th-minute winner by Joshua Kimmich to win 1-0 at Hamburg and protect the 
champions’ three-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga.

Struggling Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> had battled 
hard to protect a goalless draw and end a three-game losing run, with the 
goalkeeper René Adler making a string of key saves before Kimmich drilled in a 
Franck Ribéry cutback at the far post.

The result lifted Bayern to 15 points, three ahead of Borussia Dortmund, who 
beat Freiburg 3-1 on Friday.

Bayern, who take on Atlético Madrid in the Champions League next week, faced a 
determined Hamburg team, who were looking to turn their season start around, 
pressing them high and allowing just three shots on target in the first half.

The champions’ first big chance came after almost an hour with Javi Martínez’s 
effort cleared on the line by Adler, who was also on hand to save a curled 
David Alaba free-kick 10 minutes later.

The Bayern coach, Carlo Ancelotti, brought on Ribéry and the Frenchman added 
instant pace down the left wing but neither Thomas Müller nor Robert 
Lewandowski could beat Adler from close range.

The keeper was finally beaten when Ribéry launched another trademark run, cut 
across the goalmouth and Kimmich slipped in to score the winner to extend 
Bayern’s perfect start to the season with their fifth win in five matches.
