The president of Nigeria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria> has 
joined politicians, environmental activists and others to pay tribute to Ken 
Wiwa, the Ogoni leader and critic of Shell and other western oil companies in 
the Niger delta, who has died from a stroke in London.


Wiwa, the eldest son of Nigerian author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was executed in 
1995 after leading a peaceful uprising by the Ogoni people to stop Shell from 
polluting their oil-rich area of the delta, was a journalist with the Guardian 
who later became an adviser to three Nigerian presidents.

“Wiwa was an ardent believer in the unity, progress and stability of his 
community. I urge family, friends and associates to honour his memory by making 
his dream of an environmentally safe, secured and prosperous Ogoniland a 
reality,” said President Muhammadu Buhari.


As an aide to ex-presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umaru Yar’Adua and Goodluck 
Jonathan, Wiwa, 47, raised international awareness of the scale of devastation 
in the delta and helped secure international funding to clean it up.

Wiwa and the families of the other eight Ogoni leaders who were also executed 
by the Nigerian government in 1994,won $15.5m from Shell in 2009 as 
compensation for their deaths

Last year, he wrote in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/10/ken-saro-wiwa-father-nigeria-ogoniland-oil-pollution>
: “If my father were alive today he would be dismayed that Ogoniland still 
looks like the devastated region that spurred him to action. There is little 
evidence to show that it sits on one of the world’s richest deposits of oil and 
gas.”


A 2011 UN report said Nigeria’s Ogoniland region could take 30 years to 
recover fully 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/04/niger-delta-oil-spill-clean-up-un>
 from the damage caused by 50 years of oil spills. The study said complete 
restoration could entail the world’s “most wide-ranging and long-term oil 
clean-up”.


Goodluck Diigbo, president of Ogoni Central Indigenous Authority, said: “The 
perspective of ‘junior’, as he was popularly addressed by the Ogoni, was that 
every problem and every conflict has a solution. This belief guarded his own 
quiet approach in tackling the dilemma of the Ogoni people.”
