All the world likes to quiz, but Britain does it differently. It is the only 
place where quizzes, attempted purely for pride, are given prime-time viewing 
slots. People sign up for Mastermind, University Challenge, Only Connect and 
their like for the intellectual challenge, rather than the hope of a large cash 
prize.

If you want to win a quiz, one of the best things you could do to prepare is 
to read the newspaper. Every day. A good quizmaster will use the media as a 
benchmark for what contestants are likely to know and what is likely to flummox 
them. Getting into the habit of reading widely will help you to brush up on 
names of national capitals, medal-winners and electoral outcomes – all 
stalwarts of the general knowledge quiz – or to notice things that might catch 
the quizmaster’s eye, such as the recent appearance of the island nation 
Kiribati at international sporting events. Mug up on quizzing staples: longest 
rivers, regnal years and FA Cup finalists. And, remember, information is always 
more memorable if you come across it an interesting context – so make it fun!

If you’re setting a quiz, don’t copy other people’s questions and use a 
reliable source or better still, two: the Guardian, say, or the Oxford 
Dictionary of Quotations or Wisden. The local library is your friend. Facile 
questions are no fun – contestants want to feel some achievement. But asking 
for information that is too obscure leaves them despairing, feeling as though 
there’s no point in trying. Be careful to phrase questions to allow only one 
answer wherever possible.

“Audience”, finally, is a useful word to bear in mind. Extra facts about the 
answers, a lightly witty phrasing every now and then and a friendly (but not 
overly friendly) bearing will mean they want you to do it all over again.

How to Google-proof your quiz

Who cheats in a quiz? Bad people do, and sometimes good people whose moral 
compass has become damaged by alcohol and competitiveness. In the age of 
smartphones, the music round is not safe (apps such as Shazam can identify a 
song), nor the picture round (thanks to reverse image searching). Machines can 
“see” and “hear” – but they cannot yet smell, taste or touch, which is why I’ve 
been known to ask contestants to identify slices of cheese.

Music and picture rounds can be saved, too: slowed-down songs, or images not 
of famous people, but of their lookalikes in the form of wax or Lego – or 
familiar faces chopped up, blurred or otherwise distorted.

Use the kind of thinking computers aren’t good at: interesting connections 
(see right), odd ones out, or cryptic definitions. And perhaps that’s the 
future for quizzing. As we rely more on technology to recover information, then 
quizzes that celebrate roundabout ways of remembering might be just what we all 
need.

I have always been good at storing up useless info. My wife accuses me of 
showing off, of always having an answer to everything. I say to her, “I 
remember what I’m interested in.” I can’t remember the birthdays of anyone in 
my family, or the names of my cousins. My wife has a vast store of knowledge 
like that, but she doesn’t consider it knowledge because it doesn’t come up in 
Trivial Pursuit. It’s no less valid.

My knowledge is brown, pink and yellow – anything in the cultural end. Sport 
and geography I can’t get a handle on. I’ve done Pointless, QI, University 
Challenge and Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. That was the scariest one. We got 
up to £64,000, then we screwed up on “the winter war”. I’ll never forget when 
USSR invaded Finland again.

You can’t prepare for a quiz. Trying to learn the stuff that might come up is 
a waste of time, because you don’t know. The one thing you can learn is how to 
answer quickly. On University Challenge, it came down to whoever got an inkling 
of the answer as soon as Jeremy Paxman started talking and buzzed – that gets 
you 10 points. You have to trust your instincts; it’s amazing what you come out 
with under pressure. We got to the final that way.

I’m part of a long-running pub quiz at the Tufnell Park Tavern in north 
London. Good pub quiz questions should make you think. There is no intrinsic 
interest in knowing a country’s flag colours. But ask me which disease unites a 
group of celebrities, and I’m interested. People don’t cheat – they’re not 
sneaking off to the loo to check their iPhones. They’re there because they like 
doing quizzes. The most we won was £900. Of course, that was the money we’d 
spent turning up.
