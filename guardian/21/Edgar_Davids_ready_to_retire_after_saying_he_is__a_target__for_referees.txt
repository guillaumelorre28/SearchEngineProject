Barnet's player-manager Edgar Davids is ready to end his playing career in 
protest at being made "a target" by referees, after he was shown his third red 
card in eight league appearances.

The 40-year-old former Holland international, sent off in the 2-1 defeat at 
Salisbury after he picked up two yellow cards – the second for kicking out at 
an opponent –told local media

: "I don't think I am going to play any more because they are taking away the 
fun.

"I think I know for definite now that the league is targeting Barnet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnet>. I don't know how many games we 
have played now but there is weird decision-making all the time. It is 
ridiculous, especially the first [yellow card] because everyone can see I 
cleared the ball. That was an absolute disgrace. The other one for the red card 
was also a disgrace.

"I am a target … I want the team to do well. If you look at the red cards, 
some are definitely red cards and some are exaggerated. It is hard to complete 
our tasks when a lot of decisions are against you."

Barnet are ninth in the Conference, three points from the play-offs.
