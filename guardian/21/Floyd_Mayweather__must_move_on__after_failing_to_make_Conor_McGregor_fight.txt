It would come as no surprise if Floyd Mayweather Jr, the five-division world 
champion who announced he was quitting boxing after aunanimous-decision win 
over Andre Berto last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/13/floyd-mayweather-finishes-up-unbeaten-after-one-sided-victory-over-andre-berto>
, came out of retirement for another eight-figure payday.

The undefeated Mayweather walked away last September as the world’s 
highest-paid athlete 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/08/cristiano-ronaldo-highest-paid-athlete-messi-lebron-james>
 and boxing’s pound-for-pound best – and many ringside observers simply refuse 
to believe he will retire when his earning power is so high.

But it won’t come against UFC featherweight champion Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor>.

Mayweather said he attempted to make a fight with the popular mixed martial 
arts champion but the sides were unable to come to terms.

“I tried to make the fight happen between me and Conor McGregor,” Mayweather 
told FightHype.com <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alOujmk3OAA> on Saturday. 
“We wasn’t able to make the fight happen, so we must move on.”

He added: “I feel honored to be the biggest name in MMA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mma> and in boxing and I don’t even compete 
no more.”

Rumblings of a potential showdown between Mayweather and McGregor had started 
before the Irishman suffered his first loss in five years to Nate Diaz in a 
non-title fight in March, a blemish he avenged in last month’s rematch.
