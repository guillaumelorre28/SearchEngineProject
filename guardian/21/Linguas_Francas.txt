Why only use the Latin plurals of neuter nouns ending in -um (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/aug/26/tube-setter-degrees-media>
, 26 August)? What about digital camerae and bankers' boni? And why limit it to 
nominative, vocative and accusative plurals? Why not other cases such as "I was 
in the museo", "the owner of the stadii" or "The Carnival of the Animalium"? 
And why are only Latin nouns are picked on? Why not pizze, fjorder and 
orang-orang-utan? Nouns from isolating languages like Chinese should not change 
in the plural, as in "two sampan" or "a bowl of lychee". Words derived from 
Arabic that begin with al, which means the, should lose the prefix when 
referring to an indefinite item, as in "a cove".

I think not. Knowledge of foreign grammar should not be a prerequisite for 
speaking or writing correct English. Perhaps we need a citizenship test for 
foreign words. If they want to come over here and join our language, we expect 
them to play by our rules!
