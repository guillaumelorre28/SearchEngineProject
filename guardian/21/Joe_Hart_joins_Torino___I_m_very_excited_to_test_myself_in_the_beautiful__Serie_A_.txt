The 29-year-old left the England training camp on Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/30/joe-hart-torino-manchester-city-loan>
 to finalise terms and undergo a medical, and Torino confirmed the deal was in 
place on Wednesday. The move should ensure regular action for Hart after he 
slipped further down the pecking order at the Etihad Stadium following the 
signing of Claudio Bravo from Barcelona.

Hart told Torino’s website: “Torino’s offer came at the right moment for me, 
in the right manner, and I’m very excited to test myself in an important and 
beautiful league such as Serie A.

“Everyone knows the history of goalkeepers in Italy, and I’m sure I can learn 
inTorino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino>. That’s why I accepted 
President Cairo’s proposal.

“I already know [assistant manager] Attilio Lombardo, we won a lot working 
together in Manchester and I hope to experience the same success this year. The 
coach here wants humility and ambition. I like that. That’s how I want to be.”

Urbano Cairo, the Torino president, said the transfer “makes us proud, and 
demonstrates our willingness to build a more competitive team … It’s not only 
his talent – Hart also brings with him humility and enthusiasm.”

With Pep Guardiola making clear his preference for a ball-playing keeper, 
Willy Caballero was preferred to Hart for the opening three Premier League 
matches of the season by the new manager, with the arrival of Bravo then in 
effect pushing Hart down to third place.

Torino emerged as his most likely destination after Everton and Sevilla 
distanced themselves from the player and Sunderland’s reported interest was not 
reciprocated.

Hart had been at City 10 years and been at the centre of all their success in 
recent seasons, including the Premier League title wins of 2012 and 2014.
