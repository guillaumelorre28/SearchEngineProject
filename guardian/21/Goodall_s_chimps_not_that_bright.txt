What is surprising about Jane Goodall's discovery that chimpanzees, like man, 
are toolmakers (Comment, 26 September) is the slightness of their achievement. 
If genes truly determine behaviour, surely the fact that chimps share more than 
99 per cent of their genes with Homo sapiens should have led to greater 
abilities than the winkling out of termites with customised twigs.

There is a crow that modifies twigs to prise grubs from rotting timber, and a 
finch on the Galapagos Islands that pulls the same trick with cactus spines or 
thorns. As most of us share considerably less than 99 per cent of our genes 
with the average bird, the interesting observation is: What is it about the 
less than 1 per cent of our genes not shared with chimps that has enabled us to 
end up probing the internet as opposed to probing termite mounds?

You reported John Sulston as saying that the work being carried out on the 
sequencing of human chromosome 22 'will have set in motion a scientific 
revolution as profound as learning... that we are descended from apes' (News, 
last week).

I should like to correct the commonly believed notion that humans are 
descended from apes. This misunderstanding has done much to obstruct acceptance 
of Darwin's theory of evolution. We are no more descended from apes than they 
are from us. Both apes and man share a common ancestor - neither man nor ape, 
but an animal whose ancestral lineages led in two separate directions to us 
both.
