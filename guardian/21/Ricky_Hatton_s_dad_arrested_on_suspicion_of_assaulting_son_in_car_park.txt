The father of Ricky Hatton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rickyhatton> was 
arrested for attacking the former world champion the day before the British 
boxer announced his comeback.

It is understood Ray Hatton, 61, was arrested by police on suspicion of common 
assault of his son and given a caution after a heated argument in a car park.

The incident occurred outside a gym in Manchester on Thursday, the day before 
the younger Hatton announced he was coming out of retirement, more than three 
years after his last fight.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: "Shortly before 11.45am on 
Thursday, police received reports that there had been a fight involving two men 
outside a health and fitness club on Market Street, Hyde.

"A 33-year-old man was assaulted by a 61-year-old man, who was arrested on 
suspicion of common assault and subsequently given a police caution."

Police say the 33-year-old Hatton was not injured in the incident with his 
father. Hatton won world titles in the welterweight and light-welterweight 
divisions and has a 45-2 record.
