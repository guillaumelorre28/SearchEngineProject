Words most commonly heard on the streets of Hong Kong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong> and Singapore such as “yum cha” 
and “wah” have been included in the Oxford English Dictionary’s latest update.

The terms – a type of Chinese breakfast and an expression of delight, 
respectively – enter, along with phrases such as “dai pai dong”, “ang moh” and 
“chilli crab” (an open-air food stall, a light-skinned person, and a regional 
delicacy).

Other new entries used by English-speakers in east Asia include “compensated 
dating”, a Hong Kong phrase that refers to a relationship provided in return 
for cash or gifts, and “Chinese helicopter”, a Singaporean who was educated in 
Mandarin and has little knowledge of English.

The update to the OED, which styles itself as the definitive record of the 
English language, includes about 500 new words and phrases from around the 
world, such as “vlog”, “bro-hug” and “Dad’s Army”.

The update brought an “alphabet of newly added terms from world English to 
explore”,said the OED senior assistant editor Jonathan Dent 
<http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/march-2016-update/new-words-notes-march-2016/>
.

He cited “killer litter” – a Singaporean phenomenon of rubbish falling from a 
height – and “guanxi”, the Chinese term for personal connections that help 
facilitate business dealings.

The dictionary records south-east Asian influences on English stretching back 
to 1555.
