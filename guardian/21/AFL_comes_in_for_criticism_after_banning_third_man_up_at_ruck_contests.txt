“No 3rd man ???? Ridiculous,” Hodge messaged.

The ban follows an increased use of the tactic, where an extra team-mate would 
jump at a ball up around the ground or a throw in.

The AFL said it decided to ban the tactic after looking at ruck contests over 
the last two seasons.

“Eliminating the third man up at ruck contests will support the recruitment of 
tall players and ensure our game continues to be played at the elite level by 
players of various sizes and differing abilities,” AFL football operations 
manager Mark Evans said.

Only nominated players can now compete in any ruck duel.

The league also announced a stricter interpretation on deliberate rushed 
behinds and it has also moved to simplify the interpretation around 
high-contact free kicks.

Also, the AFL match review panel will crack down on so-called tummy taps next 
season, with players more likely to be suspended for punches to the midriff.
