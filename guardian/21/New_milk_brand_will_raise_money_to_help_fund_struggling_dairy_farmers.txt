A new milk brand will launch this week in Victorian supermarkets to raise 
funds for struggling dairy farmers in south-eastern Australia, as pressure 
mounts on retailers and processors to pay more for milk.

Farmers’ Fund milk will be produced by Murray Goulburn Co-operative and Coles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/coles> under licence from the Victorian 
Farmers Federation. Forty cents from every two-litre bottle will go to a fund 
that supplies grants of up to $20,000 to dairy farmers hit by falling milk 
prices.


Coles flagged the idea in June but the Victorian Farmers Federation’s 
announcement is the first detailed information on how the milk will directly 
help farmers.

Consumer-led boycotts have hit Coles and Woolworths private-label milk, as the 
retail giants continue to sell the milk at $1 a litre, the same price since 
2011.


This year Murray Goulburn, a dairy cooperative that supplies milk across 
Australia, retrospectively slashed how much it paid farmers for their milk, 
leaving many to pay back the difference to the company.


The company cut the price after its predictions the milk market would recover 
from a global glut failed to materialise. Its predicted price paid to farmers 
of $6.05 a kilogram in July 2015 fell to between $4.75 and $5.00 a kilogram in 
April 2016.

The first round of grants will be delivered in mid-October.
