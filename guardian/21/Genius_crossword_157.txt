Half the solutions are to be entered in a 10 across manner. Ambiguities about 
some entries are resolved by the appearance of four names with something in 
common appearing in the completed grid.

Deadline for entries is 23:59 GMT on Saturday 30 July. You need to register 
once and then sign in to theguardian.com to enter our online competition for a 
£100 monthly prize.
