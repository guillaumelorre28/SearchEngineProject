A study has found that bumblebees have distinct personalities. 

Some bees play it safe by returning to the same flowers again and again while 
others search for new sources of nectar, scientists found.

The researchers, from Queen Mary University of London, tracked four bumblebees 
from birth to death, recording a total of 244 flights covering a distance of 
more than 110 miles.

Each bee had a tiny aerial attached to its body that allowed the scientists to 
follow its movements using radiosignals. Individual bees differed greatly in 
the way they foraged for food.

Dr James Makinson, one of the researchers, said: “One bee was something of a 
lifelong vagabond, never settling down on a single patch of flowers.

“In contrast, another of our bees was exceptionally diligent, quickly 
switching after only three flights from exploration of the surrounding 
environment to focusing exclusively on a single forage location for six 
consecutive days.

“After six days this bee switched her attention to a closer forage source. She 
was able to do this without re-exploring her environment, suggesting she had 
remembered the location from her initial explorations.

“Our other two bees interspersed foraging for a single location with 
exploratory flights throughout their life.”

The study’s coordinator, Prof Lars Chittka, said: “For the first time, we have 
been able to record the complete ‘life story’ of a bee.”
