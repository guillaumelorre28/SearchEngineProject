Ponga made his NRL debut on the wing in the Cowboys’ finals win over Brisbane 
in September as a replacement for the injured Antonio Winterstein. He played in 
the preliminary final loss to Melbourne a week later.

North Queensland boss Peter Parr is all but resigned to losing the young star. 
“We face a tough battle to keep Kalyn with the money that is being offered,” 
Parr told News Corp.

“We are bracing for the fact we can’t compete with what’s on offer at other 
clubs.”

As a junior, Ponga was chased by six clubs and four sports including 
Australian rules and rugby union before committing to the Cowboys.
