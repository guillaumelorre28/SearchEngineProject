FULL TIME: Peterborough United 1-1 West Bromwich Albion (aet; WBA win 4-3 on 
pens)

Such a brave effort from the League One side, who were every inch the 
entertainers their goal record suggested they would be. They were 19 minutes 
from victory, but West Brom fought their way back into it, battled through 
extra time, and held their nerve when it mattered. No, not quite the goalfest 
we hoped for, but end-to-end fun of the highest order. Congratulations to West 
Brom; commiserations to Posh. The FA Cup: it’s still got it, you know.

United 3-4 West Bromwich Albion: Angol has to score to keep Posh in it. A lazy, 
shuffling, stuttering run, and this one’s straight at Foster too. Underhit. He 
looks devestated. The Premier League side survive, and make it through to the 
fifth round!

EXTRA TIME, FULL TIME: Peterborough United 1-1 West Bromwich Albion

And that’s the last amazing act of an amazing game. Had Berahino scored, it 
would have been undeserved heartbreak forPeterborough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/peterborough>, who have been magnificent 
against Premier League opposition. As it is, we’re going to penalties! Who’ll 
be travelling to Reading for the fifth round? We’ll find out soon enough!

ET 30 min: They should have. Gardner curls high towards the far post. Alnwick 
comes to claim, but misses. Berahino, next to the left-hand post, must head 
home. But he heads down, across the face of goal, and wide right! What an 
astonishing miss!

ET 29 min: Sessegnon burns down the right and forces Fox into a cynical 
tug-back. Fox is booked. This is a free kick in a very dangerous position. Can 
West Brom do what West Ham did last night?

ET 28 min: Maddison powers down the left but can’t find a cross. Then a throw 
from the right, Angol backing into Olsson and claiming a penalty kick. Nope! 
Finally Maddison dinks a ball down the middle, very nearly springing Oztumer 
clear. Foster is out to the edge of his box to claim. Penalties are looming, 
but you wouldn’t bet against someone finding a dramatic winner.

ET 26 min: Gardner floats a long free kick into the Posh box from a central 
position. The ball drifts a little to the left. Olsson heads over from close 
range. This is wonderfully tense fun.

ET 24 min: How did this stay out?! Gardner, just inside the area, to the left 
of the D, lashes a rising shot goalwards. It looks unstoppable, but it gets 
stopped all right: Zakuani, on the line, gets a strong head to it, and clears! 
That would have put lesser men in a brace. What a clearance!

ET 23 min: And out of the maelstrom, a moment of near-genius. Samuelson keeps 
the ball in down the right wing; it looked like he had no chance of keeping 
that alive. Maddison is sent scampering down the wing. He makes to shoot hard, 
but then floats a clever chip from 25 yards. It beats Foster and very nearly 
drops in! Wow. That took super-cool nerves.

of the park.

ET 20 min: Maddison causes bother as he cuts inside and into the Baggies box 
from the left. His hard, low cross is blocked. Samuelson tries to re-ignite the 
move down the right, but can’t glide into the area.

ET 18 min: A tired Forrester comes crashing in on Gardner. It’s clumsy rather 
than malicious. Gardner wants him sent off, but it’s just a yellow. It’s 
awarded after play was waved on, as there’s a chance for Berahino on the edge 
of the Posh box. To the left of the D, he curls for the top right. But it’s 
overcooked.

ET 16 min: Sessegnon drives down the middle of the park, displaying some fine 
close control. He slips the ball to his left for Rondon, who blooters over from 
distance. Not good. Sessegnon has every right to have a moan, but keeps 
admirably quiet.

EXTRA TIME, HALF TIME: Peterborough United 1-1 West Bromwich Albion

Samuelson has a lot of space in the middle of the park, and two team-mates on 
his left. Only one West Brom defender. But the pass out wide is lumped into the 
stand. Rondon bursts up the other end down the left. He enters the box but is 
stopped by a stunning last-ditch tackle by the ever-heroic Bostwick. Then the 
new boy Maddison makes off down the Posh left, but his low cross through the 
Baggies box is ahead of everyone. And that’s that for the first half of extra 
time. This game took a long time to warm up, but it’s hot, hot, hot now. Not 
quite the goalfest we predicted, but more than entertaining enough. Can anyone 
become a hero in the last period of extra time, or are we going to penalties?

ET 13 min: A long ball down the inside-right channel. Rondon chests down, 
turns, and whistles a screamer inches wide of the bottom-left corner. That’s a 
wonderful effort, carved out of nothing.

ET 11 min: McClean has been relentless down this left wing. He reaches the 
byline, steps back upfield, turns, and lashes a low shot towards the bottom 
left. Bostwick blocks bravely.

ET 9 min: Samuelson is brilliant. He Ricky Villas his way down the right at an 
insouciant speed. Four West Brom players try to get the ball off him. None 
succeed. He eventually works space for a shot from the edge of the box. His 
vicious riser only just clears the bar. What a run that was.

ET 7 min: Peterborough are riding their luck a little right now. McClean once 
again causes mayhem down the left. He finds Rondon in the box. Rondon pulls the 
ball back for Gardner, whose shot is blocked. The goal was gaping for a second 
there.

ET 6 min: McClean cuts in from the left and lays off to Fletcher, whose shot 
is deflected and loops up absurdly. Alnwick comes off his line and through a 
crowd. His punch clear doesn’t connect properly, but Bostwick is on hand to 
help with a header away from danger.

ET 4 min: Taylor is in an effervescent mood. He fizzes in from the left, his 
dribbles causing the West Brom back line all sorts of anxiety. He can’t quite 
work room for a shot this time, but the visitors can’t keep letting him run 
hither and yon like this.

high and wide left.

ET 2 min: McClean cuts inside from the left and looks to have been bundled to 
the floor by Baldwin, but he’s not getting anything. That’d have been a free 
kick in a testing position.

And we're off again!

West Brom kick off, and Fletcher immediately gifts the ball to Taylor, who 
advances on the box but is bundled out of it. West Brom go up the other end, 
thought McClean down the left, and his low cross is guided left of the target 
by the in-rushing Sessegnon. What a pleasantly loose start to extra time!

FULL TIME: Peterborough United 1-1 West Bromwich Albion

Sessegnon executes a ludicrous dive as he attacks the Posh box from the right. 
Nope! Then up the other end, Samuelson tries a hail-mary shot from 35 yards. 
Nope! And that’s that! We’re going to extra time. Which was a prospect that 
didn’t seem too tasty after the first half, but that second period was 
brilliant fun, and the next 30 promises to be equally entertaining.

Such a brave effort from the League One side, who were every inch the 
entertainers their goal record suggested they would be. They were 19 minutes 
from victory, but West Brom fought their way back into it, battled through 
extra time, and held their nerve when it mattered. No, not quite the goalfest 
we hoped for, but end-to-end fun of the highest order. Congratulations to West 
Brom; commiserations to Posh. The FA Cup: it’s still got it, you know.

And that’s the last amazing act of an amazing game. Had Berahino scored, it 
would have been undeserved heartbreak forPeterborough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/peterborough>, who have been magnificent 
against Premier League opposition. As it is, we’re going to penalties! Who’ll 
be travelling to Reading for the fifth round? We’ll find out soon enough!
 
ET 30 min: They should have. Gardner curls high towards the far post. Alnwick 
comes to claim, but misses. Berahino, next to the left-hand post, must head 
home. But he heads down, across the face of goal, and wide right! What an 
astonishing miss!
 
ET 29 min: Sessegnon burns down the right and forces Fox into a cynical 
tug-back. Fox is booked. This is a free kick in a very dangerous position. Can 
West Brom do what West Ham did last night?
 
ET 28 min: Maddison powers down the left but can’t find a cross. Then a throw 
from the right, Angol backing into Olsson and claiming a penalty kick. Nope! 
Finally Maddison dinks a ball down the middle, very nearly springing Oztumer 
clear. Foster is out to the edge of his box to claim. Penalties are looming, 
but you wouldn’t bet against someone finding a dramatic winner.
 
ET 26 min: Gardner floats a long free kick into the Posh box from a central 
position. The ball drifts a little to the left. Olsson heads over from close 
range. This is wonderfully tense fun.
 
ET 24 min: How did this stay out?! Gardner, just inside the area, to the left 
of the D, lashes a rising shot goalwards. It looks unstoppable, but it gets 
stopped all right: Zakuani, on the line, gets a strong head to it, and clears! 
That would have put lesser men in a brace. What a clearance!
 
ET 23 min: And out of the maelstrom, a moment of near-genius. Samuelson keeps 
the ball in down the right wing; it looked like he had no chance of keeping 
that alive. Maddison is sent scampering down the wing. He makes to shoot hard, 
but then floats a clever chip from 25 yards. It beats Foster and very nearly 
drops in! Wow. That took super-cool nerves.
 
ET 22 min: It’s getting tense. A lot of hectic 50-50 challenges in the middle 
of the park.
 
ET 20 min: Maddison causes bother as he cuts inside and into the Baggies box 
from the left. His hard, low cross is blocked. Samuelson tries to re-ignite the 
move down the right, but can’t glide into the area.
 
ET 18 min: A tired Forrester comes crashing in on Gardner. It’s clumsy rather 
than malicious. Gardner wants him sent off, but it’s just a yellow. It’s 
awarded after play was waved on, as there’s a chance for Berahino on the edge 
of the Posh box. To the left of the D, he curls for the top right. But it’s 
overcooked.

ET 16 min: Sessegnon drives down the middle of the park, displaying some fine 
close control. He slips the ball to his left for Rondon, who blooters over from 
distance. Not good. Sessegnon has every right to have a moan, but keeps 
admirably quiet.
 
Peterborough <https://www.theguardian.com/football/peterborough> make another 
change: Oztumer comes on for the impressive but tiring Taylor.

Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images  
Samuelson has a lot of space in the middle of the park, and two team-mates on 
his left. Only one West Brom defender. But the pass out wide is lumped into the 
stand. Rondon bursts up the other end down the left. He enters the box but is 
stopped by a stunning last-ditch tackle by the ever-heroic Bostwick. Then the 
new boy Maddison makes off down the Posh left, but his low cross through the 
Baggies box is ahead of everyone. And that’s that for the first half of extra 
time. This game took a long time to warm up, but it’s hot, hot, hot now. Not 
quite the goalfest we predicted, but more than entertaining enough. Can anyone 
become a hero in the last period of extra time, or are we going to penalties?
 
ET 13 min: A long ball down the inside-right channel. Rondon chests down, 
turns, and whistles a screamer inches wide of the bottom-left corner. That’s a 
wonderful effort, carved out of nothing.
 
ET 12 min: Sessegnon busily wins a corner down the right. It’s whipped to the 
near post, where Olsson tries to bundle home. No.
 
ET 11 min: McClean has been relentless down this left wing. He reaches the 
byline, steps back upfield, turns, and lashes a low shot towards the bottom 
left. Bostwick blocks bravely.
 
ET 10 min: Beautyman is replaced by Maddison. The home support are in buoyant 
mood. They’re enjoying their side’s very entertaining display. West Brom have, 
for the most part tonight, been second best.
 
ET 9 min: Samuelson is brilliant. He Ricky Villas his way down the right at an 
insouciant speed. Four West Brom players try to get the ball off him. None 
succeed. He eventually works space for a shot from the edge of the box. His 
vicious riser only just clears the bar. What a run that was.
 
ET 7 min: Peterborough are riding their luck a little right now. McClean once 
again causes mayhem down the left. He finds Rondon in the box. Rondon pulls the 
ball back for Gardner, whose shot is blocked. The goal was gaping for a second 
there.
 
ET 6 min: McClean cuts in from the left and lays off to Fletcher, whose shot 
is deflected and loops up absurdly. Alnwick comes off his line and through a 
crowd. His punch clear doesn’t connect properly, but Bostwick is on hand to 
help with a header away from danger.
 
ET 4 min: Taylor is in an effervescent mood. He fizzes in from the left, his 
dribbles causing the West Brom back line all sorts of anxiety. He can’t quite 
work room for a shot this time, but the visitors can’t keep letting him run 
hither and yon like this.
 
ET 3 min: Taylor goes on a George Best-style dribble from the right wing to 
the left of the Baggies D. He lays off to Coulibaly, whose ambitious shot flies 
high and wide left.
 
ET 2 min: McClean cuts inside from the left and looks to have been bundled to 
the floor by Baldwin, but he’s not getting anything. That’d have been a free 
kick in a testing position.
 
West Brom kick off, and Fletcher immediately gifts the ball to Taylor, who 
advances on the box but is bundled out of it. West Brom go up the other end, 
thought McClean down the left, and his low cross is guided left of the target 
by the in-rushing Sessegnon. What a pleasantly loose start to extra time!
 
Sessegnon executes a ludicrous dive as he attacks the Posh box from the right. 
Nope! Then up the other end, Samuelson tries a hail-mary shot from 35 yards. 
Nope! And that’s that! We’re going to extra time. Which was a prospect that 
didn’t seem too tasty after the first half, but that second period was 
brilliant fun, and the next 30 promises to be equally entertaining.
