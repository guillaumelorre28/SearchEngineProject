Paris Saint-Germain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> 
suffered a hiccup in their bid for a fourth straight Ligue 1 title when the 
promoted club Angers denied them a 10th consecutive win in a goalless draw.

PSG, who had won all their league games since 22 September, had the best 
chances but the Angers goalkeeper, Ludovic Butelle, put in an impressive 
display at the Jean-Bouin stadium.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic started on the bench as Laurent Blanc opted to field 
Edinson Cavani as a lone striker, with Lucas and Ángel Di María on the flanks. 
Cavani was wasteful and smashed Butelle’s post with an early header. Di María 
also hit the woodwork in the 33rd minute with a fierce shot from just inside 
the box.

Angers had their best opportunity when Romain Thomas’s header hit the crossbar 
seven minutes before half-time and they had Butelle to thank for making superb 
saves to deny Serge Aurier and Adrien Rabiot. Ibrahimovic replaced Lucas in the 
72nd minute but had little impact.

PSG have 42 points from 16 games and lead second-placed Caen, who travel to 
Monaco on Wednesday, by 14 points. Angers are third on 27 points. Nice remained 
fourth on 25 points after being held to a 0-0 draw at mid-table Lorient.
