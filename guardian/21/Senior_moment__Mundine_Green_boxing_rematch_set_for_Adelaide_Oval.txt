The much-hyped and seemingly viable boxing rematch between Anthony Mundine and 
Danny Green will be held in Adelaide next year. Mundine, 41, won a points 
decision over the West Australian when the pair fought in 2006.

Mundine predicted a win by stoppage in the rematch on February 3 at Adelaide 
Oval, saying he had overcome hip issues that have plagued his recent career. 
The bout will be fought at the catch weight limit of 83kg.

“I’ve been fighting with a bad hip – a very bad hip – for the last seven, 
eight years,” Mundine told a press conference on Tuesday. “That’s fixed now. I 
feel my feet are back, my movement’s back.

“I just want to put this shit to rest, that I’m the better man. Skills pay the 
bills. I’m going to be as sharp as I was in 2006.”

Both fighters indicated the fight could be the last of their careers, with 
Green saying beating Mundine would be a perfect send off. He was confident he 
would be able to stop Mundine. “You hit me with everything you had with two 
hips. I didn’t stop marching forward,” Green said.

Mundine hasn’t fought since he suffered a TKO loss to American Charles Hatley 
in November last year, while 43-year-old Green defeated Kane Watts on points 
last August to win the vacant Australian cruiserweight title.
