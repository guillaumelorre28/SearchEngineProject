1) England v Scotland is the oldest game in international football, older even 
than the tradition of embroidering poppies on to football shirts. Here’s Barry 
Davies talking us through the 1921 altercation, played at Hampden Park andwon 
3-0 by the home side <https://youtu.be/QQNpXEfsZgY?t=1m19s>. Seven years later, 
Scotland arrived at Wembley to field a curious, controversial team, whereupona 
dazzlingly technical and imaginative performance devastated England to the tune 
of 5-1 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLueW3V-Bgo>, making the Wembley 
Wizards immortal. But they were rivalled in 1967 when England, protecting an 
unbeaten run stretching back 19 games,were despatched 3-2 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSfA7xxBM3w> by a team inspired by the 
righteous indignation of Denis Law. Scotland declared themselves unofficial 
world champions, the game further entrenched in folklore thanks toJim Baxter’s 
need to rub it in <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px9_0d6I0qY>. And then there 
are the off-pitch incidents:Nick Collins pratfalling 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2re46lFKuc> in 2013, the Irn Bru advert 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSUJmqTDWpw> of 2014 and, extremely 
tangentially,Burnistoun on the Wayne Rooneys of this world 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=entup0bSYjw>.

2) Barry Davies, you say? No, Barry Davies we say, and here are some of his 
finest moments:“Leeds will go mad and they’ve every right to go mad” 
<https://youtu.be/hBhpJZJ8O6U?t=5m30s>; “Interesting ... very interesting!” 
<https://youtu.be/NS8eH1g3u9I?t=24s>; ya dun know 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BWAL7ADsi0>; Micky Walsh 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnKBwYHAbE4>; “Oh! Ohh whatagoal!” 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wk34X94Whk>; “Test of his pace, now test of 
his finish <https://youtu.be/hUUMktpsQAQ?t=4m8s>; on Toto Schillaci 
<https://youtu.be/8cZAvRvZgNQ?t=3m2s>; “I bet even he can’t believe it” 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYGSW7PGLVg>; “Giggs ... still Giggs” 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwylRw6Q_oI>; exhibition turd polishing 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=I5KKu1_TIRM#t=3792>; 
“Gazza!” <https://youtu.be/EIkDl3DyQJg?t=1m30s>; the ultimate goalgasm 
<https://youtu.be/AXQwBEv9vg4?t=11s>. And, as an extra treat, here’s a 
collection of everyone <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6A9YYnaYg>.

3) Complicated times call for simple brilliance. Thus consider the free-kicks 
of Juninho Permanbucano <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesfdRNtwsE>, 75 of 
them between 1994 and 2012 includingthis one against Sedan 
<https://youtu.be/NesfdRNtwsE?t=4m>, which bends twice and in opposite 
directions. And, while we’re at it, here’sBranco’s fluke for Genoa against 
Liverpool <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WT_2SkiGhw>, captured by the most 
telling angle in the history of cinematography.

4) The Grand Slam of Darts gets underway this weekend. Here’s the joy of Peter 
Wright’s walk-on <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjrl9B8u2E> at last week’s 
World Series final. And here’sAdrian Lewis throwing a blind 180 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8MArgBgMxY>, with a bunch he missed ready to 
be enjoyedhere <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFU6f1ZZ2Jg>. Meanwhile, here’s 
Phil Taylor chucking two nine-darters 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEruRUfLfIg> in the Premier League final of 
2010, as wondrously narrated by the late, great Dave Lanning and the late, 
great Sid Waddell, both of whom can be enjoyed inUniversal’s new documentary, 
House of Flying Arrows <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOPACWnJWGU>, a clip of 
which can be enjoyed here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLliC_n729o>.

5) Steph Curry is a record breaker 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlVGtx-MQTg>. Dedication, ooh dedication 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GilqqHC0SQ8>. 

6) There’s a fair amount of skill on show in this squash rally
