Chris Brown <https://www.theguardian.com/music/chris-brown> has been named as 
a suspect in an alleged assault during a basketball game on Monday 4 May.

According to police, a man claimed an argument started at the Palms Casino 
Resort in Las Vegas, which then led to a fight. The reported victim was treated 
for injuries at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center.

“A verbal altercation on the court led to a physical fight and the victim was 
punched by another male subject who was later identified as 25-year-old 
recording artist Chris Brown,” police said.

Brown’s publicist, Nicole Perna, denied these accusations. “Chris is currently 
in Las Vegas as he is performing at Drai’s on 5 May and receiving a Key to the 
Strip that day as well,” said Perna ina statement

to come play. An unruly individual showed up uninvited and was removed from the 
premises. Chris was not in an altercation with this person.”
