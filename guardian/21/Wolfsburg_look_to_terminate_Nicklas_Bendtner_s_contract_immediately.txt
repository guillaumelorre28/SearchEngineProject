Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> are hoping to end 
Nicklas Bendtner’s time at the club by terminating his contract 15 months early.

The Danish striker joined on a free transfer from Arsenal in 2014 but has 
failed to make an impact and has had several disciplinary issues this season, 
including being fined for oversleeping and being late for training.

Bendtner has been training on his own for the past two weeks and the club’s 
sporting director, Klaus Allofs, said on Thursday that they are hoping to let 
the striker go as soon as possible.

“We have attempted to hold talks with his advisers and have discussed a 
solution. I think that there will be a decision soon,”Allofs told the German 
newspaper Bild

has been training on his own recently was not something we wanted to carry on.”

The 28-year-old Dane has scored three goals in 31 league appearances since
