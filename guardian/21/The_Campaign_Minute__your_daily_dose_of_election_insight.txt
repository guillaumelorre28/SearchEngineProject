launch of theCampaign Minute – a daily digest of all the things you may have 
missed from the campaign trail.The Minute will bring you up to speed on the 
political circus quickly… and with a few laughs to boot. Available across the 
Guardian, and via special alerts from our Android and iOS apps, theCampaign 
Minutewill be published every weekday at approximately 4pm ET.

The Campaign Minute is, first and foremost, brief. An experimental format, 
it’s a mobile-first, immersive experience that occupies your attention for a 
short space of time. It blends news, insight and commentary with multimedia 
content, in an easy to read, visually engaging, full-screen format, catching 
you up on the day in politics.

The Campaign Minute is a fast, fun new way to catch up on everything you need 
to know about the presidential election each day: who’s up, who’s down, what 
Marco Rubio’s wearing today, who’s feeling the Bern. And of course some of the 
weird things Donald Trump said just now.

As an experimental format, we’ll evolve the Campaign Minute as the 
election-cycle continues. It aims to add personality, context and speed to the 
flood of daily headlines, giving time-starved, news-hungry readers a digested 
take of everything you need to know … and jokes.
