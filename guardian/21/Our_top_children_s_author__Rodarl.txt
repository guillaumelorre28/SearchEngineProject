When I took the 11-plus in 1960, more girls than boys got high scores (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/13/a-generation-of-children-failed-by-the-11-plus>
, 13 September). To keep the numbers of boys and girls equal in grammar 
schools, boys with lower scores were admitted, while many of their 
higher-scoring sisters went to secondary moderns. Will this happen again?

• Your lovely coverage, via various articles and the cryptic crossword, of the 
centenary of the birth of Roald Dahl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl> reminded me of a survey a 
colleague and I undertook, back in the 1990s, of the reading habits of 250 
year-7 students. Roald Dahl was by far the favourite author, but with 28 
versions of the spelling of his name. Our favourite was the splendidly succinct 
Rodarl.

• A friend who joined the BBC with me in 1960 was given a warning by one of 
his public school masters when he told him of his success. He should be 
careful, he was told, as he might find himself working with men who, how could 
his master put it, wore corduroy trousers (Letters

• Peter Mason says Prince Buster (Obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/08/prince-buster-obituary-ska-musica-jamiaca>
, 10 September) was the first Jamaican to have a British Top 20 hit in 1965 
with Al Capone. In fact it was a hit in 1967 and the first solo British chart 
hit by a Jamaican was My Boy Lollipop by Millie in 1964. The half British/half 
Jamaican foursome the Southlanders went to No 17 with Alone in 1957.

• Good that David Willetts appears to have read Wittgenstein (Pass notes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/shortcuts/2016/sep/11/bring-backery-theresa-may-grammar-school-ban>
, G2, 12 September). He wasn’t taking credit for the metaphor “repairing a 
spider’s web with one’s own hands”. Was he?

• What joy to read Nancy Banks-Smith again (G2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/13/nancy-banks-smith-on-the-archers-trial-is-it-safe-to-come-out-now>
