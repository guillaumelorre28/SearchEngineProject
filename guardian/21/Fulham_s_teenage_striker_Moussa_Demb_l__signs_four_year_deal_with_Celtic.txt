Dembélé, 19, has signed a four-year contract at Parkhead after leaving Fulham

scored 17 goals for the Championship side last season but was out of contract.

He joined Fulham from Paris Saint-Germain as a 16-year-old and made his debut

Hotspur

 but chose to join the Scottish champions.

“It’s a massive thing to come to this club and to be Brendan Rodgers’ first 
signing is something unreal for me,” he told Celtic’s website.

“The manager told me that Celtic is a good team for me. When I come here I 
will have game-time but I have to show that I can stay in the team, and it’s a 
good way for me to progress here with a massive stadium and the fans and the 
city. Everyone lives for Celtic and for me it’s unbelievable to play for a 
massive club like this.

“As a young footballer you have to get as much experience as you can to get to 
the next level and at Celtic I know I can win trophies and play European 
football, and it’s a massive club as well, so it feels good.”

Fulham will be due compensation but it is expected to be a minimal fee.
