The German second division side are on their winter break, allowing the former 
Los Angeles Galaxy player to come to Merseyside.

Buddle is represented by the same agent as the Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> goalkeeper Tim Howard and the 
on-loan Galaxy forward Landon Donovan, both fellow Americans.

He scored 42 times in 87 appearances for the Galaxy between 2007 and 2010 and 
has six goals in 17 league appearances for Inglostadt this season.

Buddle's representative Richard Motzkin, managing executive of Wasserman Media 
Group Global Football Group, confirmed on Twitter: "For those asking, my client 
Edson Buddle will be on trial this week at Everton FC."
