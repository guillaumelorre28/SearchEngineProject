Former AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> star Colin Sylvia is 
recovering in hospital after a fall from a balcony at the weekend that he says 
resulted in a fractured neck and bleeding to the brain.

The former Melbourne player posted a photograph of himself covered in blood 
after the incident and another in a neck brace at the Alfred Hospital, saying 
it was “not an ideal start to the weekend” for him.

A hospital spokesperson confirmed on Monday the 31-year-old remained at the 
Alfred in a stable condition.

Sylvia hung up his boots after after just one year with Fremantle, but it was 
at Melbourne where he spent the majority of his career and made a name for 
himself.

The midfielder played over 150 games for the Demons between 2004 and 2013, 
kicking over 100 goals during his 10-year spell with the club.

He announced his retirement from the game after failing to prove his fitness 
before the start of the Dockers’ 2015 season.
