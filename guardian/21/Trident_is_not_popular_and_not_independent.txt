Rafael Behr’s article (The schism at the heart of Corbynism is now clearly 
visible 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/corbyn-leader-progress-schism--trident>
, 28 September) assumes that Trident renewal is popular and that Trident is an 
independent nuclear deterrent.

The ORB poll for the Independent in January showed that 51% favour nuclear 
weapons and 49% either favour keeping Trident without nuclear weapons or oppose 
any replacement of Trident. YouGov polls in November 2015 show a majority 
against replacingTrident <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> and for 
either a cheaper option or no replacement. I wonder just how enthusiastic the 
public will be when the cost goes over the £100bn mark.

The codes for arming Trident’s nuclear weapons are held by the Americans. In 
what sense is Trident independent? Behr talks of “forcing” Corbyn to test his 
appeal with a wider electorate” – but exactly who is out of step with public 
opinion?

I have never supported unilateralism, but I find it perverse when the right 
slag off theLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> left for 
advocating borrowing money to invest in our economic infrastructure but have no 
problem in spending billions on Trident renewal.
