The nail in the coffin of what could be the end of the skinny jean was 
Victoria Beckhamâ€™s bow at her New York Fashion Week show. The former poster 
girl for skin-pinching skinnies wore a baggy pair ofloose linen trousers

 with sandals that seemed to signal the end of the closely cropped silhouette. 
Although Beckham wasnâ€™t wearing jeans, the message was clear: as soon as the 
skinny jean became the new normal, fashion got bored and moved on.

 The designerâ€™s trouser choice chimed with where jeans have been heading for a 
while. In terms of life cycles, the skinny jean has been gradually succeeded by 
a baggier, softer silhouette. First came the dysfunctional family of jeans (the
boyfriend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jun/21/how-to-dress-slim-boyfriend-jeans>
 and the mom), then thecrop step 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/08/here-come-the-cropstepper-the-new-raw-denim-look>
 and the Vetements-style deconstructed jean. Unlike the spider-like skinny, 
these jeans are wider and looser. Less OMJeggings and more chicGarÃ§onne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/27/governmental-garcons-how-politics-turned-french-style-on-its-head>
.

But the rise of athleisure and the Monica Rose/Kardashian look 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/09/over-the-knee-boots-set-to-be-the-shoe-of-the-decade>
 has seen a sharper focus on a fit of denim that is more body conscious. Not 
skinny but sculpted, likethe wedgie

, which rose to prominence earlier this year.

Khloe Kardashianâ€™s collaboration with Good American 
<https://www.goodamerican.com/> jeans points to this new look: figure-hugging 
yet inclusive, taking the emphasis away from a sculptured high-fashion look and 
towards an emphasis on comfortable chic, having your skinny cake and eating it, 
too. Well not eating it, but definitely take a Instagram friendly photo of it 
at least. The bodycon jean significantly plays to the athleisure crowd, made to 
replicate the relaxed feel of the trackie bottom/Lululemon yoga pant, 
highlighted by the fabric blends (cotton, wool, linen), which give a softer 
feel. Post-skinny jean, the bodycon jean is a perfect hybrid for now â€“ half 
athleisure half figure hugger.
