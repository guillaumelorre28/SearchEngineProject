manager, has left the Conference club with immediate effect for personal 
reasons, it was announced on Tuesday.

"It is with much regret we announce, by mutual consent, and as a result of 
genuine personal circumstances unrelated to his tenure as manager of Luton Town 
Football Club, Paul Buckle has, with immediate effect, parted company with the 
football club," a statement said.The 42-year-old is a former manager of Torquay 
United and Bristol Rovers. He took over at Luton in April 2012. Buckle led his 
team to a famous FA Cup victory over the Premier League side Norwich City last 
month before they were knocked out in the fifth round by Millwall at Kenilworth 
Road on Saturday.

"The reasons for Paul's departure are fully understood by the board, who 
sincerely regret that he is leaving," the club said. "We are fully aware that 
achieving managerial stability will create the conditions necessary for success 
on the football pitch." Luton, just outside the Conference promotion play-off 
positions, were playing at Macclesfield last night. The club statement added: 
"Paul has built the foundations necessary for Luton Town to achieve the board's 
desire of returning to the Football League as soon as possible."
