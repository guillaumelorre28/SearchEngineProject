 because he was mentally incompetent when he fatally stabbed his father at the

 but the case is now likely to be put to rest for some time.

In the supreme court on Tuesday, Justice Anne Bampton formally committed Walsh 
to detention in an Adelaide mental health facility until further order.

Walsh appeared in court via video link in a neat white shirt with a light-blue 
tie and his dark hair parted. He did not speak during the brief hearing.

Bampton could have released him on licence but after reviewing psychiatric and 
next-of-kin reports she accepted the crown’s recommendation to detain him.

Walsh was suffering a psychotic episode as a result of undiagnosed 
schizophrenia when he stabbed his father 20 times with a hunting knife, the 
court ruled in September.

Court documents have revealed the extent of his mental health problems, which 
started in 2011 as he was backpacking around the world.

He heard voices he believed were from another dimension, and at times he 
believed his father was the devil.

But he was not intoxicated by any drugs at the time of the stabbing, forensic 
reports showed.

Phil’s wife, Meredith, said she and her daughter were left heartbroken but she 
would continue to love and support her son.

She said there was a lack of information available to families like hers, 
calling for increased mental health research and awareness.

“We now all live the devastating consequences of a mental illness that was not 
understood,” she said in her victim impact statement.
