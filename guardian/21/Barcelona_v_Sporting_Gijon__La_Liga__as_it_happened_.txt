Full-time: Barcelona 6-0 Sporting Gijon

The referee puts Sporting out of their misery. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> go top after being off the 
perch for around six hours. Suárez scored four for a second game running after 
a much-improved second-half performance in which Sporting just ran out of gas. 
Vranjes should appeal against his sending off, though. He didn’t even appear to 
foul Neymar for the third penalty so a booking was a very harsh decision. They 
remain in the bottom three. What a strange game. It didn’t look like it was 
going to turn into a shellacking. It did. Football is a cruel world. Suárez has 
now scored 54 goals in all competitions too. Not bad. Thanks for your emails. 
Goodnight.

90 min: There’ll be two more minutes of suffering for Sporting. Poor Halilovic 
has had his confidence shredded by his parent club.

Goal! Barcelona 6-0 Sporting Gijon (Suárez 88)

Suárez scores four goals for a second game running. This is ugly for Sporting, 
though. They’re all over the place. Messi zips a pass into the box, where 
Suárez is free. He takes one touch and looks to curl it around Cuellar but 
instead whips it in off the near post. This is a proper mauling now.

Goal! Barcelona 5-0 Sporting Gijon (Neymar 86 pen)

Neymar stutters as he runs up and and scuffs a weak penalty somewhere between 
the middle of the goal and the left-hand corner. It dinks into the keeper’s 
legs and goes in. That didn’t deserve a goal.
 Barcelona’s Neymar is congratulated by team-mate Luis Suarez after scoring.

Penalty for Barcelona … again!

Vranjes touches Neymar ever so lightly as the two jump for a header in the 
box. Neymar appeals for a penalty, and gets it. Soft decision. Vranjes is sent 
off for a second bookable offence too. That’s dreadful. Poor sod.

83 min: Castro is on for Guerrero. Sporting look absolutely shot. Earlier, 
when Perez went off after about 60 minutes, he’d already run 8.5km. That kind 
of figure is usually seen after around 80 minutes.

79 min: “I’m sitting at home nursing my vocal chords after shouting myself 
hoarse at Rayo Vallecano,” begins Christian Dugdale Astbury. “It was absolutely 
rocking in the ground and in the first half I and thought they were going to do 
it after an incredible start. No-one throws a two goal lead away quite like 
Rayito though and sadly it ended the way Rayo games often do … losing to a late 
winner after a howling error. I think I might have pulled the girl who sits 
near me though. I’ve fancied her all season. Rayista love would make up for 
Rayista defeat.” What a lovely tale Christian. Barça fans are doing the Mexican 
wave. They’re in a loving mood again all right. Their team are toying with 
Sporting now.

Goal! Barcelona 4-0 Sporting Gijon (Suárez 76 pen)

It’s No32 in the league for the season for Suárez and his hat-trick. That 
takes him above Ronaldo. Oh Ronaldo will love that. This time Suárez goes down 
the middle as Cuellar dives in the direction of his last penalty. A game that 
was over is even more over.

Another penalty to Barcelona!

Sanabria elbows Neymar off the ball in the box. It’s daft rough-house stuff. 
Suárez to take it again …

Goal! Barcelona 3-0 Sporting Gijon (Suárez 74 pen)

Suárez curls it into the top-right corner in a style reminiscent of Danny 
Murphy. You don’t stop them. Penalties eh?Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are usually so bad at them. 
The penalty was given for handball when Alves lofted the ball into the raised 
arm of a Sporting defender whose name escapes me. Sorry. It was no more a 
penalty than the last two.

later Neymar shows some silky skills with a little touch and dink to set Messi 
free in the box, but he slams the ball into an onrushing Sporting defender.

67 min: Two days ago an emotional Suárez received a shirt from a young 
Phenylketonuria sufferer. He said he would dedicate a goal to her if he scored. 
He did just that by displaying the T-Shirt with a supportive message on it 
after his goal. Well done Luis.

65 min: There was a hint of offside about Suárez but it was just that, a hint. 
The angle didn’t make it clear. Some housekeeping, Perez is off for Sporting 
and Sanabria is on. And Pique is off forBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> and Bartra is on in his stead.

Goal! Barcelona 2-0 Sporting (Suárez 63)

Well, this is more like vintage Barça. Busquets picks up possession deep in 
the Barça half. He finds Messi in space in the centre circle. Messi scurries 
forwards and draws two Sporting players out of defence, and then plays in 
Iniesta on the left side of the penalty area, who picks out Suárez at the far 
post with a low cross. It’s a lovely sweeping move. Well done everyone.

58 min: Neymar is picked out on the far side of the box. His first touch is 
hesitant as he shifts the ball on to his right foot and, well, you know the 
rest. Cuellar saves and Neymar continues to splutter like a petrol car running 
on diesel.

57 min: Well this is weird. Barça should have a penalty. A strike, by Rakitic 
I think, clatters into a Sporting defender’s arm and out for a corner. No Barça 
player even appeals for a penalty. Strange.

55 min: Barça are getting up a head of steam here. Iniesta, who has been quiet 
tonight, blasts over and then Messi finds his turbo button and darts into the 
box, where he dares a Sporting defender to tackle him before shifting the ball 
on to his wand of a left foot and drivingjust wide.

53 min: Neymar is sent scuttling free down the inside-left channel again. This 
time he picks out a decent ball inside the backtracking Sporting defence. Messi 
dummies the ball and lets it roll through to Suárez behind him. The Uruguayan 
has a bit of time but chooses to loft the ball towards the far corner (badly) 
when thwacking it as hard as he could was surely the better option. Wasteful.

52 min: It’s a big night for potato snacks. “Eating too much cake and crisps 
at a birthday party,” splutters Henry Carter. “Trying to follow the football at 
the same time!” Are you eight years old Henry? Shouldn’t you be in bed?

leather lederhosen or platform soles. Perhaps it took Luis Enrique the length

48 min: Alves crosses into the box but Suárez jumps into Cuellar and a 
free-kick is given against the Sporting keeper. There are 21,000 empty seats at 
the Camp Nou tonight. There’s still 77,000 there, mind.

45 min: Dani Alves is on in place of Sergi Roberto. Presumably Luis Enrique 
has now forgiven him for pretending to be his own girlfriend in a video playing 
down the club’s Champions League elimination. He’s a colourful fella, for sure.

Here’s a grab of the Pique ‘handball’. Seen here it looks like a penalty 
should be given. But when you see it in motion it’s less clearcut.

What are you doing this Saturday evening, I asked. Here’s what you are doing …

“My evening has been spent comforting Evertonians,” deadpans Ian Copestake.

“Saturday afternoon (Americas time), writing my usual 15,000 word report to 
clients on the week’s events in my boring corner of the business world. 
Guardian MBM keeps me from falling asleep at the keyboard. You think your life 
is boring,” asks Mark Turner. 15,000 words Mark? That’s truly horrible. Sorry 
to hear that.

“I’m eating crisps,” offers John Carnie. Erm, OK John. What flavour?

Half-time

Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> dominated but it 
could easily be 1-1. This hasn’t been a classic Barça display at all and 
Sporting deserve credit for making the Spanish champions struggle. They’ve been 
stubborn opponents who are willing to break. There’s a reason for that. They’re 
fighting for their life at the bottom. They need something from this.

45 min: Sporting claim a handball against Pique as the half draws to a close. 
Bravo makes a hash of trying to claim a low, whipped-in cross from the left. 
Mascherano clears off the line and then the impressive Halilovic keeps it alive 
by knocking the ball across the box, where it bounces into what looks like a 
combination of Pique’s arm and midriff. It’s a decent penalty shout but I can 
understand why it wasn’t given on first viewing. And peep! That’s that for the 
half.

42 min: Messi shapes to dink a ball over the top to Neymar before instead 
conjuring a delightful low pass inside Vranjes to find Neymar in the same 
position as he was in just a a moment ago. The Brazilian is one-on-one with 
Cuellar, but he hesitates and the Sporting keeper smothers the ball. The angle 
was tight, mind.

40 min: Now Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> create 
something. Neymar times his run behind Vranjes perfectly and is picked out 
brilliantly by Rakitic. He cuts inside and shapes to shoot, one, two, three 
times, as he dances across the box and allows at least five Sporting defenders 
to get in front of him, before pulling the ball back to Suárez, whose shot from 
10 yards is deflected over. Neymar really should have just let one go then.

38 min: Sporting have had a decent spell of it in the past 10 minutes. For all 
Barça’s possession they’ve created very little and Sporting have looked to 
break when they can.

33 min: Sporting have some success on the left as first Vranjes gets forward 
and tries to cut a ball back into the box that is cut out – and then Menéndez 
flashes a shot wide after a delicious, whipped-in ball finds him at the far 
post but it bounces up wickedly as he shapes to hit it and makes taming it 
near-impossible.

30 min: Mascherano sends Neymar scurrying off up the left wing. He cuts inside 
and works himself into a decent position but his cross is misplaced and 
Sporting clear. Neymar’s just a little out of tune with the rest of his 
team-mates at present. Has he had something to do with Barça’s poor form before 
the Deportivo game? Everything seems to be bouncing off him like the Neymar 
that everyone was critical of before he became the Neymar that everybody lauded.

27 min: Sporting win a free-kick wide on the right in a promising position. 
The free-kick is so bad that the clearance almost sends Messi, Neymar and 
Suárez through on goal in the other direction. Are set-piece crosses and 
corners much worse these days or do players try too hard to whip the perfect 
ball in to the box instead of just a decent one?

23 min: Neymar rolls around a bit after what looked on first viewing like a 
reasonable tackle from Vranjes. On second viewing he actually follows through 
after deflecting the ball out for a throw-in and you don’t seem to be able to 
do that in professional football any more. Oh well. Vranjes is then booked 
after trying to undress Neymar as we was accelerating away from the full-back a 
moment or two later.

22 min: … where the tricky Croatian Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> loanee Halilovic shows 
commendable youthful exuberance by jinking left and right before having a go 
from 30 yards. It’s a decent hit that is deflected over. Corner for Sporting. A 
corner that is woefully underhit.

18 min: Sid Lowe has a little more news on the Diego Simeone sending off. It 
wasn’t actually the Atlético manager who threw a second ball on to the pitch, 
as was reported earlier.
Sid Lowe (@sidlowe) 
Simeone says ref right to send him off, although it was ball boy by bench who 
threw ball on (not him or his staff). Seems to expect a ban.

16 min: Cuellar shows a much better skillset now, as Messi latches on to a 
knockdown from Suárez and fizzes a low shot towards the bottom corner that the 
goalkeeper does very well to keep out with a strong left arm.

14 min: It was an awful bit of goalkeeping by Cuellar. He came out under a bit 
of pressure from Suárez to punch clear a lofted ball into the box but only 
palmed it into the ground where it bounced up to Messi just inside the box, who 
headed over the stranded goalkeeper. How much do Gijon lament that miss now? 
Cuellar actually looked a bit scared and had an odd body shape with his knee 
raised. He claimed his ankle had been caught by Suárez after he saw the ball 
sail over him. The crowd then stand as one and applaud in the 14th minute to 
honour Johan Cruyff.

9 min: Sporting have a great chance to go a goal up but don’t take it. 
Guerrero nicks the ball past Pique, who showed a lack of awareness and rushed 
out of defence to nick the ball, but was second in the race with the Sporting 
forward. Guerrero scampered forwards and squared the ball to Menendez, just 
outside the six-yard box, but he sidefooted his shot straight at Bravo. The 
ball was just behind him, in fairness.

7 min: Barcelona are, as you’d expect, dominating possession but Sporting 
aren’t making it easy for them. They’re snapping away and pushing high up to 
try to nick possession. It could be costly if Barça can pick a ball in behind 
them, but this has been a decent and energetic start by the struggling visitors.

5 min: Busquets is lucky not to be booked for a stupid, late tackle on 
Lichnovsky. His trailing leg caught the Sporting player and knocked him to the 
turf. There are ways to show you care. That wasn’t one of them.

3 min: Sergi Roberto, who has taken a bit of flak for his defensive 
performances, plays instead of Dani Alves again tonight. He is allowed acres of 
space on the right, where he gathers possession and whips a dangerous ball 
behind the Sporting defence only for Messi to head over. It was too high for 
him, mind.

Peep!

1 min: We’re under way. Barcelona in their usual home ‘hoops’ are kicking from 
left to right on my screen. Sporting, in bright yellow, are going t’other way.
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have a brief foray 
forwards but it comes to nothing and it’s a goal-kick. It’ll get better. Don’t 
worry.

reasonably heartily too. Maybe the fans are up for this one. We’re almost ready

For all the intimidating vastness of the Camp Nou, it’s never the noisiest 
place for matches thatBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>
 are fully expected to win, such as tonight’s. Will that be different given 
that Barça are now, after today’s results, lagging behind the Madrid clubs? It 
would help if when noise is generated, it didn’t drift off up into the air and 
disappear. The club has a remedy for that. An expensive one. Barça are going to 
add a further 5,000 seats and put a snazzy roof on the stadium. It will look 
mighty impressive. Here’s a very nice video showing how the work will be done 
as the team continues to play throughout the four seasons of work.

Atlético Madrid have beaten Málaga 1-0 and are now top of La Liga on 82 points.
 Real Madrid are second on 81 points andBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are third on 79 points. Right, 
now that bit of admin is out of the way I can now confirm Barça need to win to 
go top on their head-to-head record against Atlético.

That Atlético win may come at a cost to their manager, Diego Simeone, who will 
could face a suspension for the rest of the season after trying to halt a late 
Málaga counter-attack by kicking a second ball on to the field. That’s such a 
Simeone thing to do.

Anything goes at Atleti. Malaga break quickly, so the home bench throws a ball

Hello. The bad news for Barcelona is that they are no longer top of La Liga. 
The Madrid clubs have made the most of Barça’s form dropping off a cliff after 
their clásico defeat and have overhauled them. Real Madrid came from two goals 
down to beat Rayo Vallecano 3-2 earlierthanks to Gareth Bale doing a good 
Cristiano Ronaldo impression 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/23/rayo-vallecano-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report>
. Atlético are still in action against Málaga as I type but if they draw or win 
that game (they’re currently 1-0 up) then Luis Enrique’s side will be third and 
need a victory regardless. The good news for Barcelona is that they are playing 
third-bottom-of-the-league Sporting Gijon and the Catalans come into this game
on the back of an 8-0 win 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/20/deportivo-la-coruna-barcelona-la-liga-match-report>
 against poor old Deportivo. If they’d have spread those goals around a bit 
over their previous four league games they wouldn’t be in a sprint to win the 
title, they’d be wearing their slippers, strolling along puffing on their pipe, 
easy as you like. But they’re not.

Lionel Messi hasn’t suffered any lasting damage after being kicked around the 
Riazor like a bean bag, so he starts. But Luis Enrique is without the injured 
Sandro Ramirez, Thomas Vermaelen and Jeremy Mathieu. Sporting Gijon enjoyed a 
fine victory over Sevilla last time out and will have at least a smidgin of 
confidence coming into this.

The referee puts Sporting out of their misery. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> go top after being off the 
perch for around six hours. Suárez scored four for a second game running after 
a much-improved second-half performance in which Sporting just ran out of gas. 
Vranjes should appeal against his sending off, though. He didn’t even appear to 
foul Neymar for the third penalty so a booking was a very harsh decision. They 
remain in the bottom three. What a strange game. It didn’t look like it was 
going to turn into a shellacking. It did. Football is a cruel world. Suárez has 
now scored 54 goals in all competitions too. Not bad. Thanks for your emails. 
Goodnight.
 
90 min: There’ll be two more minutes of suffering for Sporting. Poor Halilovic 
has had his confidence shredded by his parent club.
 
Suárez scores four goals for a second game running. This is ugly for Sporting, 
though. They’re all over the place. Messi zips a pass into the box, where 
Suárez is free. He takes one touch and looks to curl it around Cuellar but 
instead whips it in off the near post. This is a proper mauling now.

Neymar stutters as he runs up and and scuffs a weak penalty somewhere between 
the middle of the goal and the left-hand corner. It dinks into the keeper’s 
legs and goes in. That didn’t deserve a goal.

Vranjes touches Neymar ever so lightly as the two jump for a header in the 
box. Neymar appeals for a penalty, and gets it. Soft decision. Vranjes is sent 
off for a second bookable offence too. That’s dreadful. Poor sod.
 
83 min: Castro is on for Guerrero. Sporting look absolutely shot. Earlier, 
when Perez went off after about 60 minutes, he’d already run 8.5km. That kind 
of figure is usually seen after around 80 minutes.
 
81 min: Surprising stat of the day …
OptaJose (@OptaJose) 
1 - Iniesta hadn't delivered an assist at Camp Nou in La Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> since March 2014 (vs 
Celta). Return
 <https://twitter.com/OptaJose/status/723965211925946368> April 23, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/OptaJose/status/723965211925946368>  
79 min: “I’m sitting at home nursing my vocal chords after shouting myself 
hoarse at Rayo Vallecano,” begins Christian Dugdale Astbury. “It was absolutely 
rocking in the ground and in the first half I and thought they were going to do 
it after an incredible start. No-one throws a two goal lead away quite like 
Rayito though and sadly it ended the way Rayo games often do … losing to a late 
winner after a howling error. I think I might have pulled the girl who sits 
near me though. I’ve fancied her all season. Rayista love would make up for 
Rayista defeat.” What a lovely tale Christian. Barça fans are doing the Mexican 
wave. They’re in a loving mood again all right. Their team are toying with 
Sporting now.
 
It’s No32 in the league for the season for Suárez and his hat-trick. That 
takes him above Ronaldo. Oh Ronaldo will love that. This time Suárez goes down 
the middle as Cuellar dives in the direction of his last penalty. A game that 
was over is even more over.

Alex Caparros/Getty Images  
Sanabria elbows Neymar off the ball in the box. It’s daft rough-house stuff. 
Suárez to take it again …
 
Suárez curls it into the top-right corner in a style reminiscent of Danny 
Murphy. You don’t stop them. Penalties eh?Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are usually so bad at them. 
The penalty was given for handball when Alves lofted the ball into the raised 
arm of a Sporting defender whose name escapes me. Sorry. It was no more a 
penalty than the last two.
 
It’s a handball. Well one was going to be given eventually wasn’t it?
 
71 min: Hernández is booked for getting a handful of Neymar’s shirt. A moment 
later Neymar shows some silky skills with a little touch and dink to set Messi 
free in the box, but he slams the ball into an onrushing Sporting defender.
 
69 min: If it was all Barcelona before that second goal, it’s even more all 
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> now. Rakitic hits a 
swerving shot towards the top-left postage stamp but it dips just wide. Back 
they come …
 
67 min: Two days ago an emotional Suárez received a shirt from a young 
Phenylketonuria sufferer. He said he would dedicate a goal to her if he scored. 
He did just that by displaying the T-Shirt with a supportive message on it 
after his goal. Well done Luis.

PKU” in support of young patients of Phenylketonuria. Photograph: Alex 
Caparros/Getty Images  
65 min: There was a hint of offside about Suárez but it was just that, a hint. 
The angle didn’t make it clear. Some housekeeping, Perez is off for Sporting 
and Sanabria is on. And Pique is off forBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> and Bartra is on in his stead.
 
Well, this is more like vintage Barça. Busquets picks up possession deep in 
the Barça half. He finds Messi in space in the centre circle. Messi scurries 
forwards and draws two Sporting players out of defence, and then plays in 
Iniesta on the left side of the penalty area, who picks out Suárez at the far 
post with a low cross. It’s a lovely sweeping move. Well done everyone.

61 min: Barça win a corner after Messi drives an optimistic free-kick into the 
top of the wall from all of 30 yards.
 
58 min: Neymar is picked out on the far side of the box. His first touch is 
hesitant as he shifts the ball on to his right foot and, well, you know the 
rest. Cuellar saves and Neymar continues to splutter like a petrol car running 
on diesel.
 
57 min: Well this is weird. Barça should have a penalty. A strike, by Rakitic 
I think, clatters into a Sporting defender’s arm and out for a corner. No Barça 
player even appeals for a penalty. Strange.

for the ball. Photograph: Alex Caparros/Getty Images  
55 min: Barça are getting up a head of steam here. Iniesta, who has been quiet 
tonight, blasts over and then Messi finds his turbo button and darts into the 
box, where he dares a Sporting defender to tackle him before shifting the ball 
on to his wand of a left foot and drivingjust wide.

goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar and Igor Lichnovsky. Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters  
53 min: Neymar is sent scuttling free down the inside-left channel again. This 
time he picks out a decent ball inside the backtracking Sporting defence. Messi 
dummies the ball and lets it roll through to Suárez behind him. The Uruguayan 
has a bit of time but chooses to loft the ball towards the far corner (badly) 
when thwacking it as hard as he could was surely the better option. Wasteful.
 
52 min: It’s a big night for potato snacks. “Eating too much cake and crisps 
at a birthday party,” splutters Henry Carter. “Trying to follow the football at 
the same time!” Are you eight years old Henry? Shouldn’t you be in bed?
 
50 min: “Dani Alves on - disappointingly wearing the Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> kit, and not a silver wig, 
leather lederhosen or platform soles. Perhaps it took Luis Enrique the length 
of the first half to persuade him to take them off,” honks Charles Antaki.
 
48 min: Alves crosses into the box but Suárez jumps into Cuellar and a 
free-kick is given against the Sporting keeper. There are 21,000 empty seats at 
the Camp Nou tonight. There’s still 77,000 there, mind.
 
46 min: Sporting have been trying to ape the Rory Delap throw-in tactic 
tonight. The few they have had in forward positions on the right have been 
flung in at high velocity and flat towards the penalty spot by Hernández. They 
haven’t really got the giants in the box to really botherBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, though.
 
45 min: Dani Alves is on in place of Sergi Roberto. Presumably Luis Enrique 
has now forgiven him for pretending to be his own girlfriend in a video playing 
down the club’s Champions League elimination. He’s a colourful fella, for sure.
 
“I’m eating Quavers,” responds John Carnie, a man of few words and a fan of 
snacks with few calories. Not a particularly satisfying Saturday night treat 
John.
 
Here’s a grab of the Pique ‘handball’. Seen here it looks like a penalty 
should be given. But when you see it in motion it’s less clearcut.

What are you doing this Saturday evening, I asked. Here’s what you are doing …

“My evening has been spent comforting Evertonians,” deadpans Ian Copestake.

“Saturday afternoon (Americas time), writing my usual 15,000 word report to 
clients on the week’s events in my boring corner of the business world. 
Guardian MBM keeps me from falling asleep at the keyboard. You think your life 
is boring,” asks Mark Turner. 15,000 words Mark? That’s truly horrible. Sorry 
to hear that.

“I’m eating crisps,” offers John Carnie. Erm, OK John. What flavour? 
 
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> dominated but it 
could easily be 1-1. This hasn’t been a classic Barça display at all and 
Sporting deserve credit for making the Spanish champions struggle. They’ve been 
stubborn opponents who are willing to break. There’s a reason for that. They’re 
fighting for their life at the bottom. They need something from this.
 
45 min: Sporting claim a handball against Pique as the half draws to a close. 
Bravo makes a hash of trying to claim a low, whipped-in cross from the left. 
Mascherano clears off the line and then the impressive Halilovic keeps it alive 
by knocking the ball across the box, where it bounces into what looks like a 
combination of Pique’s arm and midriff. It’s a decent penalty shout but I can 
understand why it wasn’t given on first viewing. And peep! That’s that for the 
half.
 
42 min: Messi shapes to dink a ball over the top to Neymar before instead 
conjuring a delightful low pass inside Vranjes to find Neymar in the same 
position as he was in just a a moment ago. The Brazilian is one-on-one with 
Cuellar, but he hesitates and the Sporting keeper smothers the ball. The angle 
was tight, mind.
 
40 min: Now Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> create 
something. Neymar times his run behind Vranjes perfectly and is picked out 
brilliantly by Rakitic. He cuts inside and shapes to shoot, one, two, three 
times, as he dances across the box and allows at least five Sporting defenders 
to get in front of him, before pulling the ball back to Suárez, whose shot from 
10 yards is deflected over. Neymar really should have just let one go then.
 
38 min: Sporting have had a decent spell of it in the past 10 minutes. For all 
Barça’s possession they’ve created very little and Sporting have looked to 
break when they can.
 
33 min: Sporting have some success on the left as first Vranjes gets forward 
and tries to cut a ball back into the box that is cut out – and then Menéndez 
flashes a shot wide after a delicious, whipped-in ball finds him at the far 
post but it bounces up wickedly as he shapes to hit it and makes taming it 
near-impossible.
 
30 min: Mascherano sends Neymar scurrying off up the left wing. He cuts inside 
and works himself into a decent position but his cross is misplaced and 
Sporting clear. Neymar’s just a little out of tune with the rest of his 
team-mates at present. Has he had something to do with Barça’s poor form before 
the Deportivo game? Everything seems to be bouncing off him like the Neymar 
that everyone was critical of before he became the Neymar that everybody lauded.
 
27 min: Sporting win a free-kick wide on the right in a promising position. 
The free-kick is so bad that the clearance almost sends Messi, Neymar and 
Suárez through on goal in the other direction. Are set-piece crosses and 
corners much worse these days or do players try too hard to whip the perfect 
ball in to the box instead of just a decent one?
 
25 min: There’s a lull. What are you doing with your Saturday night? Go on, 
make me jealous.
 
23 min: Neymar rolls around a bit after what looked on first viewing like a 
reasonable tackle from Vranjes. On second viewing he actually follows through 
after deflecting the ball out for a throw-in and you don’t seem to be able to 
do that in professional football any more. Oh well. Vranjes is then booked 
after trying to undress Neymar as we was accelerating away from the full-back a 
moment or two later.
 
22 min: … where the tricky Croatian Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> loanee Halilovic shows 
commendable youthful exuberance by jinking left and right before having a go 
from 30 yards. It’s a decent hit that is deflected over. Corner for Sporting. A 
corner that is woefully underhit.
 
20 min: Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are 
starting to turn up the pressure here. Rakitic tries to loft a ball over the 
Sporting defence to Neymar, but it’s just cut out before the Brazilian can get 
to it. Sporting break …

18 min: Sid Lowe has a little more news on the Diego Simeone sending off. It 
wasn’t actually the Atlético manager who threw a second ball on to the pitch, 
as was reported earlier.
Sid Lowe (@sidlowe) 
Simeone says ref right to send him off, although it was ball boy by bench who 
threw ball on (not him or his staff). Seems to expect a ban.

16 min: Cuellar shows a much better skillset now, as Messi latches on to a 
knockdown from Suárez and fizzes a low shot towards the bottom corner that the 
goalkeeper does very well to keep out with a strong left arm.
 
14 min: It was an awful bit of goalkeeping by Cuellar. He came out under a bit 
of pressure from Suárez to punch clear a lofted ball into the box but only 
palmed it into the ground where it bounced up to Messi just inside the box, who 
headed over the stranded goalkeeper. How much do Gijon lament that miss now? 
Cuellar actually looked a bit scared and had an odd body shape with his knee 
raised. He claimed his ankle had been caught by Suárez after he saw the ball 
sail over him. The crowd then stand as one and applaud in the 14th minute to 
honour Johan Cruyff.

Gea/Reuters  
And that’s his 40th of the season. 
 
9 min: Sporting have a great chance to go a goal up but don’t take it. 
Guerrero nicks the ball past Pique, who showed a lack of awareness and rushed 
out of defence to nick the ball, but was second in the race with the Sporting 
forward. Guerrero scampered forwards and squared the ball to Menendez, just 
outside the six-yard box, but he sidefooted his shot straight at Bravo. The 
ball was just behind him, in fairness.
 
7 min: Barcelona are, as you’d expect, dominating possession but Sporting 
aren’t making it easy for them. They’re snapping away and pushing high up to 
try to nick possession. It could be costly if Barça can pick a ball in behind 
them, but this has been a decent and energetic start by the struggling visitors.
 
5 min: Busquets is lucky not to be booked for a stupid, late tackle on 
Lichnovsky. His trailing leg caught the Sporting player and knocked him to the 
turf. There are ways to show you care. That wasn’t one of them.
 
3 min: Sergi Roberto, who has taken a bit of flak for his defensive 
performances, plays instead of Dani Alves again tonight. He is allowed acres of 
space on the right, where he gathers possession and whips a dangerous ball 
behind the Sporting defence only for Messi to head over. It was too high for 
him, mind.
 
1 min: We’re under way. Barcelona in their usual home ‘hoops’ are kicking from 
left to right on my screen. Sporting, in bright yellow, are going t’other way.
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> have a brief foray 
forwards but it comes to nothing and it’s a goal-kick. It’ll get better. Don’t 
worry.
 
The Barcelona anthem <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1_XM6MKZ88> quivers 
through the Catalan evening air as the teams emerge at Camp Nou. It’s sung 
reasonably heartily too. Maybe the fans are up for this one. We’re almost ready 
for kick off.
 
For all the intimidating vastness of the Camp Nou, it’s never the noisiest 
place for matches thatBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>
 are fully expected to win, such as tonight’s. Will that be different given 
that Barça are now, after today’s results, lagging behind the Madrid clubs? It 
would help if when noise is generated, it didn’t drift off up into the air and 
disappear. The club has a remedy for that. An expensive one. Barça are going to 
add a further 5,000 seats and put a snazzy roof on the stadium. It will look 
mighty impressive. Here’s a very nice video showing how the work will be done 
as the team continues to play throughout the four seasons of work.
Barcelona reveal Camp Nou’s transformation plan – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/apr/21/barcelona-reveal-plan-for-camp-nous-transformation-video> 
Matchday omen alert! “I would like to point out that each time Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> lost in the last three league 
games the opposition had beaten Sevilla right before,” points out Animesh Joshi 
. “4-1 to Madrid. 2-1 to Sociedad. 2-1 to Valencia. Odds on a Gijon win by one 
goal?”
 
Atlético Madrid have beaten Málaga 1-0 and are now top of La Liga on 82 points.
 Real Madrid are second on 81 points andBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are third on 79 points. Right, 
now that bit of admin is out of the way I can now confirm Barça need to win to 
go top on their head-to-head record against Atlético.

That Atlético win may come at a cost to their manager, Diego Simeone, who will 
could face a suspension for the rest of the season after trying to halt a late 
Málaga counter-attack by kicking a second ball on to the field. That’s such a 
Simeone thing to do.

Anything goes at Atleti. Malaga break quickly, so the home bench throws a ball

Hello. The bad news for Barcelona is that they are no longer top of La Liga. 
The Madrid clubs have made the most of Barça’s form dropping off a cliff after 
their clásico defeat and have overhauled them. Real Madrid came from two goals 
down to beat Rayo Vallecano 3-2 earlierthanks to Gareth Bale doing a good 
Cristiano Ronaldo impression 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/23/rayo-vallecano-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report>
. Atlético are still in action against Málaga as I type but if they draw or win 
that game (they’re currently 1-0 up) then Luis Enrique’s side will be third and 
need a victory regardless. The good news for Barcelona is that they are playing 
third-bottom-of-the-league Sporting Gijon and the Catalans come into this game
on the back of an 8-0 win 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/20/deportivo-la-coruna-barcelona-la-liga-match-report>
 against poor old Deportivo. If they’d have spread those goals around a bit 
over their previous four league games they wouldn’t be in a sprint to win the 
title, they’d be wearing their slippers, strolling along puffing on their pipe, 
easy as you like. But they’re not.

Lionel Messi hasn’t suffered any lasting damage after being kicked around the 
Riazor like a bean bag, so he starts. But Luis Enrique is without the injured 
Sandro Ramirez, Thomas Vermaelen and Jeremy Mathieu. Sporting Gijon enjoyed a 
fine victory over Sevilla last time out and will have at least a smidgin of 
confidence coming into this.
