Rennes <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rennes>, the French club furious 
at what they believe to be Manchester City's poaching of their young talent, 
have been found guilty of exactly the same offence.

The Ligue 1 side want a transfer ban to be imposed on the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> club after the Under-16 
international Jérémy Hélan was lured to England. However they now face a fine 
themselves from France's Ligue de Football Professional (LFP) after Tongo Hamed 
Doumbia joined them from Châteauroux in June.

Châteauroux's administrative director, Bruno Allegre, accused Rennes of double 
standards. "There are certain people who hand out lessons in morality to others 
but do not practice what they preach," he told the Independent. "Rennes like to 
think of themselves as an exemplary club, a moral leader which lectures others 
but, at the moment, they are not capable of sticking to those lessons. Either 
that or they are completely incapable of training young players because they 
seem to have to take them from other clubs."

Doumbia, who was 19 when he moved, had been at Châteauroux for two years and 
was on an amateur contract at the club. Allegre claimed the player was obliged 
to sign full terms with the club.

Rennes are now liable to pay an undisclosed sum in compensation to Doumbia's 
former Ligue 2 club.
