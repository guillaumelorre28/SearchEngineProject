Ángel Di María’s volleyed winning goal was the highlight of an otherwise poor 
game as Paris Saint-Germain defeated Rennes to extend their lead at thetop of 
Ligue 1 to 10 points <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football/table>
.

Chances were few and far between as a PSG side without Edinson Cavani and 
Zlatan Ibrahimovic struggled to break down a resilient home defence.

Perhaps with one eye on Tuesday’s trip to Real Madrid in the Champions League 
the PSG coach, Laurent Blanc, opted to rest his two main strikers but another 
of his stars won the game in the 75th minute.

Di María found the back of the net with a left-foot shot after Marco Verratti 
released Lucas Moura with a superb long-range pass and he flicked the ball back 
to the arriving Argentinian for his third league goal for the club he joined in 
the summer from Manchester United.

Ezequiel Lavezzi was a threat early on and he went close with a long-range 
free-kick before forcing the goalkeeper to tip a shot over the bar. Benoît 
Costil was called on again just before half-time to deny Lucas after Di María 
had led a swift counterattack.

PSG dominated possession in the second half but they lacked a cutting edge as 
Cavani and Ibrahimovic became even more conspicuous by their absence.

However, the introduction of Verratti and Thiago Motta after 66 minutes helped 
change that as the champions asserted themselves during the later stages.

Verratti instantly made an impact as Blaise Matuidi just failed to get on the 
end of his pass before the Italian’s excellent pass led to the goal. Verratti’s 
ball was taken down by Lucas and he set up Di María, who drilled a first-time 
shot into the bottom right-hand corner of Costil’s net.

Pedro Henrique went close late on but PSG held on for a sixth successive league 
win and maintained their unbeaten start to the season.
