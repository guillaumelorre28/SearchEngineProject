each other or one another?
Some traditionalists say the former should apply only to two people (“Iniesta 
and Xavi hugged each other”) and the latter to more than two (“all 11 Spanish 
players hugged one another”). HW Fowler was unimpressed by this argument and in 
practice very few people make the distinction.

The possessive is singular: they shook each other’s hand

EADS
European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company; the group includes the aircraft 
manufacturer Airbus and is the major partner in the Eurofighter consortium

lc: editor of the Observer, editor of the Bromley, Bexley and Eltham Leader

editors
An editor is to newspaper or website as a captain is to ship.

“Editors are craftsmen, ghosts, psychiatrists, bullies, sparring partners, 
experts, enablers, ignoramuses, translators, writers, goalies, friends, 
firemen, wimps, ditch diggers, mindreaders, coaches, bomb throwers, muses and 
spittoon – sometimes all while working on the same piece” (Gary Kamiya, 
Salon.com).

“Trust your editor, and you’ll sleep on straw” (John Cheever)

educationist
not educationalist

attendee, escapee, etc

eerie
weird; Erie North American lake; eyrie of eagles

effect or affect?
See affect <https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a#affecr>

effectively
This adverb is best kept simply to describe how something was done: “Anna 
managed the department effectively.” Confusion arises when it is used instead 
of “in effect”, which describes something that has the effect of, even if the 
effect was unintended or unofficial: “Her boss was off, so in effect Anna was 
the manager of the department” is clearer than “Her boss was off, so 
effectively Anna was the manager of the department.”

Sometimes effectively is used in neither of these ways, but just to pad out a 
sentence in a feeble attempt at adding emphasis, in which case it can be safely 
deleted

effete
The traditional meaning is exhausted, spent or worn out, but nowadays you 
rarely see this word used to mean anything other than effeminate or foppish. 
Baroness Orczy used it in this sense in The Scarlet Pimpernel as long ago as 
1905: “Those happy days of courtship, before he had become the lazy nincompoop, 
the effete fop, whose life seemed spent in card and supper rooms”

efit
(electronic facial identification technique) program used to create police 
drawings

eg
no full points

EGM
extraordinary general meeting

Eid al-Adha
(Festival of Sacrifice) Muslim festival laid down in Islamic law, celebrates 
the end of the hajj. Note that eid means festival, so it is tautologous to 
describe it as the “Eid festival”

Eid al-Fitr
Muslim festival of thanksgiving laid down in Islamic law, celebrates the end 
of Ramadan (al-fitr means the breaking of the fast)

eid mubarak
not a festival but a greeting (mubarak means “may it be blessed”)

Eiffel Tower

Eire
no: say Republic of Ireland or Irish Republic

eke out
This used to mean making a small amount go further, as in “she eked out her 
rations by serving string instead of spaghetti”. It was a bit extra – note that 
eke meant “also” as used by Chaucer.

The word has come to mean something rather different, namely scraping by, as 
in “she eked out a living doing the occasional subbing shift at the Sunday 
Times”

elan
no accent

ElBaradei, Mohamed
former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, ElBaradei

or older people, not “the elderly”; do not use to describe anyone under 75

El Dorado

Electoral Reform Services provides an independent balloting and polling service 
to political parties, trade unions and other organisations

electra complex
the female equivalent of oedipal complex

electrocution
death by electric shock, so don’t say survivors of torture were “electrocuted” 
during their ordeal - rather that they were given electric shocks

elegy
poem of mourning; eulogy speech of praise.

The adjective elegiac, sometimes misspelt “elegaic”, is very popular with 
writers on upmarket newspapers seeking an alternative to “sad”

elemental
basic; elementary simple

Elephant and Castle 
area; Elephant & Castle station


elephant in the room
Like governments and reality TV series, metaphors that we once welcomed into 
our lives as refreshing can become all too familiar, to the point of tedium – 
and this cliche is a fine example.

At its height, elephants were not only in the room, but had taken over the 
whole house: “elephants in the room” included trade figures, policy, lack of 
policy, climate change, Iraq, the US, Europe, anti-Americanism, men, women, 
single women, a new French football league, race, religion, Islam, Catholicism, 
Tessa Jowell, Andrew Neil, Jimmy Greaves, fatness, thinness, Stalinism, Hitler 
and Tony Blair’s departure from office.

The phrase seemed destined for the elephants’ graveyard but there is evidence 
that, used imaginatively, it may still be effective: “There’s only so long they 
can ignore this elephant in the room [the Iraq war] before it takes a dump on 
the carpet” (Gary Younge, 5 July 2010); and, from the same writer: “Money in 
American politics was already an elephant in the room. Now the supreme court 
has given it a laxative, taken away the shovel, and asked us to ignore both the 
sight and the stench” (30 January 2012)

elision
means omission, not the conflation of one or more thing

elite

ellipsis

them), in copy and headlines: “She didn’t want to go there ... ” There is no 
need for a full point

Élysée Palace

email

emanate
is intransitive; use exude if you need a transitive verb

Embankment, the
in London; the tube station is just Embankment

embargo
plural embargos

embarrass, embarrassment

embassy
lc, eg British embassy; not necessarily an excuse to use the Ferrero Rocher 
joke yet again

emigrate
leave a country; immigrate arrive in one.
Hence emigrant and immigrant, emigration and immigration

émigré

Emin, Tracey

emoji
plural emojis

emotional
showing emotion; emotive causing emotion.
“Badger culling is an emotive issue. No wonder people get emotional about it.”

“Tired and emotional” is a euphemism for drunk

empathic
not empathetic

Empire State Building

empires
British empire (but British Empire Medal), Roman empire, etc

employment tribunal
not industrial tribunal

EMS
European monetary system

Emu
economic and monetary union

emulate
The traditional meaning of emulate is to attempt to equal or surpass, so “try 
to emulate” is strictly tautologous. But nowadays if you say “he emulated 
Thatcher”, everyone will think you mean that he succeeded, so you do need to 
qualify it: “He sought to emulate Thatcher, but ended up doing a poor imitation 
of Major”

enamoured of
not by or with

enclave
a piece of land totally surrounded by a foreign territory, eg San Marino and 
Vatican City, both enclaved within Italy; anexclave is politically attached to

is is bounded by Armenia, Iran and Turkey

encyclopedia
not encyclopaedia

enervate
to deprive of strength or vitality

enforce, enforceable

England, English
should not be used when you mean Britain or British, unless you are seeking to 
offend readers from other parts of the UK (we published a map of England’s best 
beaches, with the headline “Britain’s best beaches”)

See Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-s#scotland>

to be confused with Historic England

English Nature

monstrous or wicked, such as a massacre, and is not just another word for “big”

enquiry
use inquiry

two words, whatever estate agents might claim

ensure
make certain; insure against risk; but you can assure someone’s life by taking 
out an insurance policy

enthral, enthralling

entr’acte

E.ON

epicentre
point on the Earth’s surface directly above the focus of an earthquake or 
underground explosion; frequently misused to mean the centre or focus itself 
and is also not a synonym for “dead centre”.

After one of our misuses in 2010 a reader (for more than 60 years) wrote: “How 
is it that so many highly educated people, whose business is words and 
communication, do not understand that a prefix such as epi is there for a 
purpose: it changes the meaning of the root word”

epilepsy
A person with epilepsy might have a seizure, rather than a fit.

Seizures are epileptic, people are not – we do not define people by their 
medical condition; so say (if relevant) “Joe Bloggs, who has epilepsy” not “Joe 
Bloggs, an epileptic”

epinephrine autoinjector
device for injecting epinephrine (adrenaline), most often used for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis; normally abbreviated to EpiPen

epithalamium

other endurance sports

“His temperament, like the climate, was equable. None the less, he demanded a 
more equitable share of the proceeds”

Equality, the Disability Rights Commission, and the Equal Opportunities 
Commission; may be called EHRC, or simply the commission, after first mention

formerly Spanish Guinea, a country in central Africa that became independent 
in 1974; do not confuse with Guinea or Guinea-Bissau, other African former 
colonies

Erdoğan, Recep Tayyip
Turkish politician, elected prime minister in 2003

ere or e’er?
ere long (soon), ere now (before); e’er, which you might come across in an old 
poem, is an abbreviation of ever

Eriksson, Sven-Göran

ERM
exchange rate mechanism, the system that preceded Emu and the single currency

Ernie
electronic random number indicator equipment: the machine that picks winning 
premium bond numbers

erupt 
burst out; irrupt burst in

escapers
not escapees, despite the apparently unstoppable advance of the -ee suffix 
(can it be long before readers become “readees”?)

Eskimo
is a language spoken in Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Siberia. Note that it 
has no more words for snow than English does for rain. The people are Inuit 
(singular Inuk), not “Eskimos”

especially or specially?
The former means particularly (“he was especially fond of crab”) or in 
particular (“this policy is aimed at Ukip voters, especially those in marginal 
seats”).

The latter means for a special reason (“she made crab sandwiches specially for 
him”). If a company claims a product has been designed “especially for you”, it 
hasn’t

eSport

espresso
not expresso

establishment, the

estuary English

Eta
Basque separatists; ETA estimated time of arrival

etc
no full point

ethnic
never say ethnic when you mean ethnic minority, which leads to such nonsense 
as “the constituency has a small ethnic population”

ethnic cleansing
should not be used as a euphemism for genocide unless quoting someone

EU
European Union (no need to spell out at first mention); formerly EC (European 
Community); before that EEC (European Economic Community)

EU presidents
There are three, so don’t say “EU president” or “president of the union” 
without making clear which you mean: president of the European commission 
(currently Jean-Claude Juncker), president of the European parliament 
(currently Martin Schulz), or president of the European council (sometimes 
referred to as president of the EU), appointed for a two-and-a-half-year term 
with the possibility of renewal once (currently Donald Tusk).

To add to the confusion, there is also a presidency of the council of the 
European Union, held by a national government, which rotates among member 
states every six months


euro
currency; plural euros and cents

Euro
should not be used as a prefix to everything European, but Euro-MP is an 
acceptable alternative to MEP

Euro Disney
runs what is now called Disneyland Paris

Eurogroup

euroland, eurozone

Europe
includes Britain, so don’t say, for example, something is common “in Europe” 
unless it is common in Britain as well; to distinguish between Britain and the 
rest of Europe the phrases “continental Europe” or “elsewhere in Europe” may be 
useful

central Europe, eastern Europe, western Europe

European commission
the commission after first mention; do not abbreviate to EC

European convention on human rights

European council
EU institution; not to be confused with the Council of Europe

European court of human rights
nothing to do with the EU: it is a Council of Europe body; sits in Strasbourg. 
To avoid confusion, call it the “Strasbourg court” or the “human rights court” 
after first mention rather than the “European court”

Luxembourg

European stability mechanism
ESM for short

Eurosceptic
sceptical about Europe, not just the euro

Eurovision song contest

evacuated of thousands of people” and “thousands of people were evacuated from 
the islands” are both correct

evangelical
fundamentalist wing of Christianity

evangelist
someone who spreads the gospel

eventually
often unnecessary, as in “the FTSE 100 drifted back, eventually closing 33.9 
points lower at 5244.2”; the stock market always closes eventually

every day
adverb meaning daily: it happens every day

everyday
adjective meaning commonplace: an everyday mistake

every parent’s nightmare
avoid this cliche

evoke or invoke?
If you invoke the spirit of Picasso, you’re trying to summon his soul up from 
the grave; if your paintings evoke the spirit of Picasso, it means their style 
reminds viewers of that artist’s work

exalt
praise someone; exult rejoice
“Tony Blair was exalted as exultant New Labour supporters exulted”

exceptional 
above average; exceptionable something you take exception to
“The roast beef was exceptional, the yorkshire pudding exceptionable”

exchequer, the

exclamation marks
Use sparingly! (As Scott Fitzgerald said, it is like laughing at your own 
jokes)

exclusive
term used by tabloid newspapers to denote a story that is in all of them

execution
the carrying out of a death sentence by lawful authority, so a terrorist, for 
example, does not “execute” someone

exhausting
tiring; exhaustive thorough

ex officio
by right of position or office; ex parte on behalf of one party only

exorcised
having had evil spirits removed; often used erroneously for exercised having 
one’s passions inflamed by something

expat, expatriate
not ex-pat or expatriot; this is “ex” meaning “out of” (as in export, 
extract), not “ex-” meaning “former” (as in ex-husband).

The term is redolent of the days of empire and used only to describe Brits 
abroad, who might more accurately be termed emigrants

explained
“said” is normally sufficient

exploitative
rather than exploitive

Export Credits Guarantee Department
ECGD at second mention

exposé

extracurricular, extramarital, extraterrestrial, extraterritorial

“extrajudicial killing”
should be used only when quoting someone

extrovert
not extravert

eye level
no hyphen

eyes
is being used increasingly for “considers”, but it doesn’t mean that. You 
might get away with “BoS eyes up Abbey” meaning considers it as a takeover 
target, but not “BoS eyes online insurance” meaning BoS is considering setting 
up an online sales operation

eye-watering
The pace at which a fresh metaphor becomes a tired cliche seems to have 
increased in recent years; this one saw a huge increase in 2009 – although 
curiously, while “eye-watering” is only ever applied to money (“eye-watering 
sums”), its adverbial near relative is more versatile (“an eye-wateringly 
beautiful woman”, “an eye-wateringly sharp sauvignon” and so on). The danger, 
as ever, is that the expression loses its force from overuse

eyewitness
one word, but witness is preferable, except in the Guardian’s Eyewitness 
picture spread

Eyjafjallajökull
Icelandic volcano that brought peace to the skies for a short time in 2010
