MK Dons’ first game at Stadium MK was against a Chelsea XI back in the summer 
of 2007, a friendly the hosts won 4-3, and they have come a long way since 
then. The majority in a full house will cheer on Karl Robinson’s Championship 
side, struggling in the second tier with this occasion presumably a welcome 
relief, against the Premier League champions whose interim manager, Guus 
Hiddink, is hoping to claim this trophy for a second time.Chelsea

their best chance of silverware this season.Dominic Fifield
