Klavan impressed against Liverpool for the Bundesliga side in both legs of 
last season’s Europa League tie which the Merseysiders won 1-0 on aggregate.

At present Klopp has only two fit first-team centre-halves in Joel Matip and 
Dejan Lovren and even Matip limped off with an ankle injury during Liverpool’s 
2-0 friendly win overWigan Athletic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wiganathletic> on Sunday. The manager 
insisted afterwards that the former Schalke defender was “fine” but is well 
aware he needs defensive reinforcements.

The game, at the DW Stadium, was won with second-half goals from Danny Ings 
and 16-year-old Ben Woodburn. It was also notable for Philippe Coutinho’s 
return to the starting lineup following his Copa América exertions.

The Brazilian enjoyed a 45-minute run-out in the Wigan sunshine as Ings – who 
missed much of the last campaign with a knee injury – scored his second goal of 
pre-season in the 70th minute. Soon afterwards Woodburn continued his 
impressive friendly form with the second goal.

Liverpool started the game with Roberto Firmino and the recent £30m signing 
Sadio Mané in attack. There was also a glimpse of Liverpool’s forgotten man 
Lazar Markovic, who arrived in the second period.
