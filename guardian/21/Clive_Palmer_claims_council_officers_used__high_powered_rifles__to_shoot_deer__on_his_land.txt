Clive Palmer <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/clive-palmer> has 
refused to back down over accusations Gold Coast council officers used 
“high-powered rifles” to kill deer on his land and sold the meat to local 
restaurants.

The Queensland businessman

 wrote about the “potentially murderous actions” on his Facebook page on 
Saturday morning.

Palmer said staff and consultants observed the officers entering his property, 
killing the livestock and “endangering human life”.

“They removed the carcasses of at least 10 red deer from inside my property 
boundary and investigations have revealed they sold the meat from those animals 
to Gold Coast restaurants at up to $40 per kilogram,” he said.

Palmer accused council officers of endangering the lives of his children.

“Small children and families should be able to play in their backyard without 
fear the government will fire guns in or on their property,” he said.

 Palmer said he would contact police and pursue the matter through the courts 
and also threatened to return to politics if no action was taken to investigate.

The Gold Coast mayor, Tom Tate, denied officers had been shooting deer on 
Palmer’s land.

Palmer said he was “convinced” Tate and the council had told the truth but 
that they had been misled.

“I’m also convinced they have been unknowingly misled by council officers who 
have discharged high-powered rifles in residential areas for their own criminal 
purposes,” he said.

“My staff and other witnesses will co-operate with the council and support Tom 
Tate’s leadership to ensure the safety of all the residents of the Gold Coast.”
