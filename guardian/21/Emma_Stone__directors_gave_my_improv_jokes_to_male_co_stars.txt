“I hesitate to make it about being a woman, but there have been times when 
I’ve improvised, they’ve laughed at my joke and then given it to my male 
co-star. Given my joke away.

“Or it’s been me saying, ‘I really don’t think this line is gonna work,’ and 
being told, ‘Just say it, just say it, if it doesn’t work we’ll cut it out’.

“And they didn’t cut it out, and it really didn’t work!”
