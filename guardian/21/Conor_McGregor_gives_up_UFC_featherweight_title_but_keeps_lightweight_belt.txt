Conor McGregor <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> has vacated 
his featherweight title, ending his time as a two-division champion, UFC has

 in December 2015 but has never defended the belt. The move means Aldo reclaims 
the title – he had previously threatened to leave UFC after he failed to land a 
rematch with McGregor.

McGregor remains the lightweight title holder, after beating Eddie Alvarez in 
New York

 earlier this month. McGregor had spoken of his desire to keep hold of both 
belts. Last week his agent, Audie Attar, was asked if his client would fight 
any attempt to take one of his titles. “He’s a businessman, so he is going to 
make business decisions,” Attar said. “No matter what happens, nobody will ever 
be able to take those belts away from him. Nobody has beat him for those belts. 
So the way I look at it is, whatever business decision Conor decides to make, 
it’s a smart one. We have proven that to date. If a belt is taken or what have 
you, it’s figurative. He still keeps that win. Nobody beat him to dethrone him.

The UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> president, Dana White, says 
McGregor is unlikely to fight before May 2017, with his partner, Dee Devlin, 
expected to give birth to their first child early next year. “He’s good. He 
should take time off,” White said. “He has been fighting nonstop. Nothing wrong 
with him taking time off. It’s good for him and [Devlin], and it’s good for the 
baby.”
