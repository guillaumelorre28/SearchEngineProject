Wests Tigers <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wests-tigers> prop Matthew 
Lodge has been stood down by the NRL club over allegations of domestic 
violence, including stalking, intimidation and assault. Lodge was arrested in 
Marayong on Thursday and taken to Blacktown police station.

He has been charged with six counts of common assault, malicious damage, and 
stalking and intimidation, and was served with a provisional apprehended 
domestic violence order.

The offences are alleged to have occurred between August 8 and 20. He was 
granted strict bail conditions and is due in Blacktown Court on Wednesday.

It is the second set of domestic violence charges currently levelled against an
NRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> player, with Sydney Roosters player 
Shaun Kenny-Dowall facing a string of allegations in regard to his former 
girlfriend Jessica Peris.

The Tigers released a statement on Friday saying they were aware of the 
allegations.

“Wests Tigers have been advised this morning of incident involving Matthew 
Lodge,” the statement read.

“The club is currently working with the NRL Integrity Unit to acquire details 
of the incident. Lodge has been stood down until the Club and NRL Integrity 
Unit receive all the facts.”

Kenny-Dowall’s matter is due to be heard again in court on September 17. He 
has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Lodge has a history of drama with the 
NRL.

In May last year he was banned for three matches for wearing an obscenity 
written on his wrist strapping in an under-20s State of Origin match.

Lodge was stood down by the Tigers in March for a match and fined $5,000 after 
he was arrested for failing to leave a Kings Cross nightclub in January.
