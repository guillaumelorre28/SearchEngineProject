The Left Book Club <http://www.leftbookclub.com/> has launched a crowdfunding 
appeal backed by Noam Chomsky to find aspiring new writers from all branches of 
the left, and create a network of left-leaning reading groups around Britain.

Organisers are looking for £25,000 <http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/leftbookclub> 
to develop its website as a hub for radical writers and book groups, and have 
raised more than £1,000 in 24 hours. The not-for-profit collective, which has 
produced a series of books on welfare, housing and Greece since launching in 
2015, argues that “publishing great radical books – and facilitating 
conversation about the ideas they contain – [is] vital for the development of 
progressive politics in Britain”.

This is our contribution to the struggle against exploitation, oppression, 
war, and climate catastrophe

Founded by a group of writers, activists, publishers, booksellers and trade 
unionists, in partnership withPluto Press <http://www.plutobooks.com/>, the 
initiative is modelled on Victor Gollancz’s subscription-based literary and 
social movement of the same name, which once boasted a membership of 57,000. 
The original Left Book Club published a book a month between 1936 and 1948, 
including George Orwell’sThe Road to Wigan Pier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/20/orwell-wigan-pier-75-years> and 
Edgar Snow’sRed Star Over China 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Star_Over_China>. It also held an annual 
rally and encouraged subscribers to set up their own local book clubs, with 
1,200 groups meeting around the UK by 1939.

As well as aiming to set up reading groups in communities across Britain for 
people to “engage in the ideas and arguments being formed as part of the latest 
explosion in interest in left-wing ideas”, the new Left Book Club is also 
hoping to find “aspiring writers from all branches of the left and progressive 
movements, and those involved in activism and struggle”, which it will publish 
under its imprint with Pluto Press.

 “We want to publish books from new authors about world-changing ideas,” said 
director Neil Faulkner. “We will create a network of reading groups to debate 
them and a digital hub to sustain and broaden that debate. This is our 
contribution to the struggle against exploitation, oppression, war, and climate 
catastrophe.” Upcoming titles include Here We Stand: Women Changing The World, 
Faulkner’s own A People’s History of the Russian Revolution, andSound System:

 Video: Noam Chomsky on the search for new voices on the left 
Noam Chomsky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/22/noam-chomsky-no-individual-changes-anything-alone>
 called the Left Book Club, which is independent of any political party, vital 
for “laying the groundwork for effective practice”, and urged readers “to join 
in these very promising and critically important efforts”.

Jeremy Corbyn said the club’s relaunch was “a terrific and timely idea, 
[which] will give intellectual ballast to the wave of political change sweeping 
Britain and beyond, encouraging informed and compassionate debate”.
