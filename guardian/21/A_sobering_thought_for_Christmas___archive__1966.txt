If you must drink and drive, drink milk first. This message of hope for the 
approaching festivities is eagerly seized on by the National Dairy Council on 
the authority of an article in “Nature,” published today.

The article reports the results of experiments carried out in the department 
of nutrition of Queen Elizabeth College, University of London, by Mr D. S. 
Miller, Mr J. S. Stirling, and Professor John Yudkin. Five men and five women 
were, on two occasions, given a dose of 25 ml of ethyl alcohol (the equivalent 
of one double whisky) after first taking, in the one case 11 pints of water and 
in the second, the same quantity of milk.


Change recorded
The effect of the milk was to reduce the average maximal concentration of 
alcohol by nearly 50 per cent. The article says:

“No attempt was made accurately to assess the effects of the alcohol on the 
signs or symptoms of intoxication. Obvious changes, however, were recorded, and 
it was clear that these reflected the levels of alcohol in the blood. Since the 
amount of alcohol given to all subjects was the same, the effects on both blood 
alcohol concentrations and degree of intoxication were roughly inversely 
proportional to body weight, and were, for example, less in the heavy males 
than in the lighter females.


Without milk, all the female subjects and three of the male subjects showed 
signs of intoxication, from a slight feeling of dizziness or sleepiness to 
uncontrollable giggling and laughter, and inability to focus.”


When the alcohol was taken after the milk, it adds, the effects were reduced 
in all the eight affected subjects; no effect was seen at all in, five of them 
and only mild sleepiness in three.
