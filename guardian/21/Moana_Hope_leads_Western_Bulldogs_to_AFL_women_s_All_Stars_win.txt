The Bulldogs proved the better of the teams on show on the night, pulling away 
from the Demons after half-time, with marquee signings Ellie Blackburn and 
Katie Brennan also enjoying stellar performances.

“I see a future in which girls know that they can not only just watch the game

teams – the standard’s been spectacular.

“It’s a dream come true, really. It couldn’t be better.”
