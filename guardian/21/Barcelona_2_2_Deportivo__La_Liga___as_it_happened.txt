What an incredible turnaround. Deportivo looked dead and buried, but found 
something from somewhere, and for the second straight season, they’ve come away 
from Camp Nou with a 2-2.Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> were cruising, Luis Enrique 
made a raft of substitutions, they lost their rhythm, and some bad defending 
allowed Deportivo in. A really enjoyable game, and huge credit to the visitors: 
they deserve a point for showing some considerable gumption.

90 min +4: Ooh, Lucas went too early, and the offside flag is up. If he’d held 
his run, he was completely through on goal.

90 min +2: That could have been a free-kick on Iniesta, right on the edge of 
the box. Neymar, sitting high in the stands, is irritable. How have Barca 
managed to blow this lead?

90 min +1: Cardoso got excited in the box there: again, Depor broke forward 
with pace and purpose, but Cardoso shot for goal instead of looking for a 
team-mate, and the results were predictable. High, wide, horrible.

90 min: Depor have nine men back behind the ball now. Atlético Madrid will be 
hoping they stay solid. Four minutes of injury time.

88 min: Where have this Depor been hiding all match?! This past 20 minutes has 
been excellent: they’ve looked so dangerous on the break. For Mathieu it’s been 
a horror show. Can Barca nab one in the last two minutes?

86 min: This is insane. Deportivo streaked forward again, Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> were all over the place, and 
Lucas fed Alex, who had come up in support from his defensive midfield role, 
and he just lashed one past Bravo as Mathieu tried in vain to block! Brilliant 
strike, much like Rakitic’s earlier. Really pure and clean, and what a comeback 
this is! Luis Enrique looks seriously pissed.

84 min: Deportivo stream forward again with four attackers, but Fajr’s curler 
from 20 yards is too high. They could have made more of that; they had a man 
over and Barca were short.

81 min: I’d have to see it again on replay, but I think Mathieu made a mistake 
by not going back with Lucas just then: it was the wrong decision to try to 
play offside. Depor have found their mojo, and Cardoso is free at the back 
post, but his shot is high. This isn’t over yet.

home! Then at the other end, Messi is inches away from connecting with Suarez’s 
clever pass. This game has suddenly got interesting.

78 min: Mathieu had literally just jogged on to the pitch, and he tried to 
step up as Lucas ran on to Cardoso’s pass – but the Frenchman got it wrong, 
Lucas was in, and his left-foot shot was beautiful: he waited for Bravo to 
move, and then passed it beyond him. Game on!
 Lucas Perez grabs the ball after scoring and celebrates with Cardoso.

76 min: Goal for Depor? No! Offside. Cardoso’s shot deflected up and on to the 
bar with Bravo beaten, and Lucas headed in the rebound, but he’d gone a 
fraction too early, and it was the right call. Such a shame for Depor, and for 
Lucas, who’s been the visitors’ standout player.

Final change for Barcelona: Mathieu on for Jordi Alba. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> happy with what they have.

74 min: Lux comes out decisively to catch Messi’s cross. But Barca are 
attacking in waves, and Iniesta finds Suarez in the penalty box, with a chance 
to shoot – it’s offside.

72 min: The shaven-headed Lauré is called for a foul, and was that a card? 
It’s another good position for Barca. And another change: Sergi Roberto in for 
Rakitic, who gets a standing ovation.

69 min: Messi looks as though he fancies another goal or two. His hunger and 
desire to score goals and play football is just so admirable. Final change for 
Deportivo, and Cardoso replaces Juanfran.

67 min: Very tough for Depor to come back from this, although they did it last 
season, I suppose.Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> 
have climbed aboard their passing carousel, and it’s great to watch.

Change for Barca: Sandro, who has done well, is replaced by Munir.

64 min: He’s such a classy player, isn’t he, Rakitic? Makes it look easy. 
Could have played international football for Switzerland, of course, but 
Croatia must be delighted Slaven Bilic got to him early.

63 min: That was a lovely pure strike – really one for the purists. Depor had 
men back, but no one pressed the ball, and when Rakitic received it 25 yards 
from goal, he took a touch, had time, and speared one past Lux. A beautiful 
clean hit, and he didn’t try to blast the cover off it: a hint of bend, and, 
again, Lux clutched thin air. Superb.

Messi goes for goal after gliding past two defenders, but he’s just eased off 
it, and it’s over the bar.

56 min: On replay, that was probably the right decision. Alba looked onside as 
he ran on to Messi’s pass, but Suarez had probably strayed. Just. But it was 
really close.

Change for Depor: Luis Alberto in for Jonathan, who was game, but could have 
made more of that opportunity at 0-0.

55 min: Suarez has the ball in the net … but it’s offside! Messi’s dink over 
the top for Jordi Alba is inch-perfect, and Alba’s square pass finds Suarez all 
alone in front of goal, but it looks like the Uruguayan went too early, and 
it’s no goal. That was extremely close.

54 min: Oh, Alves let one slip under his foot, and Jonathan was away – but his 
pass for Lucas was overhit. That was an opportunity: Depor had two v two there.

52 min: Oh, Sandro looked certain to score after brilliant work from Suarez by 
the touchline, but a Depor collective do just enough to get there first. Alex 
Bergantinos, I think it was, with the crucial intervention.

49 min: Deportivo’s third forward burst in this second half, and Fajr’s 
wonderful pass releases the substitute Juando down the left, and that’s a fine 
cross for Jonathan, but he can’t keep his effort down. Another chance!

We're back

46 min: Depor get us under way, and immediately they’re on the attack, with 
Lucas marauding at pace, but Jonathan’s shot with the outside of the right foot 
is feeble, and Bravo saves comfortably.

Here’s Michael Hollitscher: “I remember watching the Super Depor team 
absolutely batter Barca at the Camp Nou sometime about 02-03. Barca were 
absolute garbage that year, at least until they bought Davids at the Christmas 
window. They were somewhere around 15th at the break, something we’ll never say 
about Barca again.”

Yeah, what a Deportivo team that was. They won 4-2 at Camp Nou in April 2003, 
when Roy Makaay scored two in one of the best performances from a visiting team 
in that grand old stadium. The season after, Depor won 2-0 in the November, but
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> loaned in Davids in 
the January window, went on an incredible tear, finished second, and Frank 
Rijkaard kept his job. The rest is history, etc etc.

Messi’s been the difference. Barca started like a train, but Depor settled 
into the game, and had frustratedBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> with their defensive block, 
but then Messi showed why he’s so good: a free kick for the ages, and the 
league leaders are ahead.

See you shortly.

44 min: Pique slides in to win it, but it breaks kindly for Fajr in midfield, 
and Depor have a chance to break. The Moroccan’s forward pass is overhit, 
however, and it’s out for a goal kick. Shame.

41 min: That was so good. Depor had dug in, and Barca were finding it tricky 
to break them down, but a piece of individual brilliance and the hosts are 
ahead. That’s Messi’s fifth league goal of the season.

39 min: Oh my: what a goal! Just brilliant. Thirty yards out, to the right of 
centre, and Messi just curls one, with fizz and dip and supreme accuracy, into 
the top corner. Lux grasped thin air, like a drunk pursuing a bus. Amazing from 
Messi!

37 min: Suarez goes down, and cries out as though the pain is unimaginable, 
but he’s OK, and gets the free kick. Chance for Barca here.

35 min: Alves fires one in from distance, but it’s over the top, and he looks 
up to the heavens for succour. Richard Dawkins won’t like that!

Thanks for reading. Bye.
 
What an incredible turnaround. Deportivo looked dead and buried, but found 
something from somewhere, and for the second straight season, they’ve come away 
from Camp Nou with a 2-2.Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> were cruising, Luis Enrique 
made a raft of substitutions, they lost their rhythm, and some bad defending 
allowed Deportivo in. A really enjoyable game, and huge credit to the visitors: 
they deserve a point for showing some considerable gumption.

That’s it!
 
90 min +4: Ooh, Lucas went too early, and the offside flag is up. If he’d held 
his run, he was completely through on goal.
 
90 min +3: Deportivo have erected a wall on the edge of their box, and 
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> can’t find a way 
through. A minute left.
 
90 min +2: That could have been a free-kick on Iniesta, right on the edge of 
the box. Neymar, sitting high in the stands, is irritable. How have Barca 
managed to blow this lead?
 
90 min +1: Cardoso got excited in the box there: again, Depor broke forward 
with pace and purpose, but Cardoso shot for goal instead of looking for a 
team-mate, and the results were predictable. High, wide, horrible.
 
90 min: Depor have nine men back behind the ball now. Atlético Madrid will be 
hoping they stay solid. Four minutes of injury time.
 
88 min: Where have this Depor been hiding all match?! This past 20 minutes has 
been excellent: they’ve looked so dangerous on the break. For Mathieu it’s been 
a horror show. Can Barca nab one in the last two minutes?
 
86 min: This is insane. Deportivo streaked forward again, Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> were all over the place, and 
Lucas fed Alex, who had come up in support from his defensive midfield role, 
and he just lashed one past Bravo as Mathieu tried in vain to block! Brilliant 
strike, much like Rakitic’s earlier. Really pure and clean, and what a comeback 
this is! Luis Enrique looks seriously pissed.
 
Unbelievable!

84 min: Deportivo stream forward again with four attackers, but Fajr’s curler 
from 20 yards is too high. They could have made more of that; they had a man 
over and Barca were short.
 
83 min: Luis Enrique, arms folded, looks jumpy. Iniesta is down briefly after 
being caught late, but he’ll be OK.
 
81 min: I’d have to see it again on replay, but I think Mathieu made a mistake 
by not going back with Lucas just then: it was the wrong decision to try to 
play offside. Depor have found their mojo, and Cardoso is free at the back 
post, but his shot is high. This isn’t over yet.
 
80 min: Ooh, Depor were nearly in again down the right. Mathieu was sleeping, 
Juando, I think it was, got to the byline and crossed, but no one could turn it 
home! Then at the other end, Messi is inches away from connecting with Suarez’s 
clever pass. This game has suddenly got interesting.
 
78 min: Mathieu had literally just jogged on to the pitch, and he tried to 
step up as Lucas ran on to Cardoso’s pass – but the Frenchman got it wrong, 
Lucas was in, and his left-foot shot was beautiful: he waited for Bravo to 
move, and then passed it beyond him. Game on!

Brilliant from Lucas!
 
76 min: Goal for Depor? No! Offside. Cardoso’s shot deflected up and on to the 
bar with Bravo beaten, and Lucas headed in the rebound, but he’d gone a 
fraction too early, and it was the right call. Such a shame for Depor, and for 
Lucas, who’s been the visitors’ standout player.

Final change for Barcelona: Mathieu on for Jordi Alba. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> happy with what they have.
 
74 min: Lux comes out decisively to catch Messi’s cross. But Barca are 
attacking in waves, and Iniesta finds Suarez in the penalty box, with a chance 
to shoot – it’s offside.
 
72 min: The shaven-headed Lauré is called for a foul, and was that a card? 
It’s another good position for Barca. And another change: Sergi Roberto in for 
Rakitic, who gets a standing ovation.
 
70 min: Cardoso looks to made an immediate impact, but his shot bobbles wide. 
It’s the 21-year-old’sLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> debut. What a place to 
make it!
 
69 min: Messi looks as though he fancies another goal or two. His hunger and 
desire to score goals and play football is just so admirable. Final change for 
Deportivo, and Cardoso replaces Juanfran.
 
67 min: Very tough for Depor to come back from this, although they did it last 
season, I suppose.Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> 
have climbed aboard their passing carousel, and it’s great to watch.

Change for Barca: Sandro, who has done well, is replaced by Munir.
 
64 min: He’s such a classy player, isn’t he, Rakitic? Makes it look easy. 
Could have played international football for Switzerland, of course, but 
Croatia must be delighted Slaven Bilic got to him early.
 
63 min: That was a lovely pure strike – really one for the purists. Depor had 
men back, but no one pressed the ball, and when Rakitic received it 25 yards 
from goal, he took a touch, had time, and speared one past Lux. A beautiful 
clean hit, and he didn’t try to blast the cover off it: a hint of bend, and, 
again, Lux clutched thin air. Superb.

58 min: Barca cranking it up, and it’s a corner. Rakitic takes it short, and 
Messi goes for goal after gliding past two defenders, but he’s just eased off 
it, and it’s over the bar.

56 min: On replay, that was probably the right decision. Alba looked onside as 
he ran on to Messi’s pass, but Suarez had probably strayed. Just. But it was 
really close.

Change for Depor: Luis Alberto in for Jonathan, who was game, but could have 
made more of that opportunity at 0-0.
 
55 min: Suarez has the ball in the net … but it’s offside! Messi’s dink over 
the top for Jordi Alba is inch-perfect, and Alba’s square pass finds Suarez all 
alone in front of goal, but it looks like the Uruguayan went too early, and 
it’s no goal. That was extremely close.
 
54 min: Oh, Alves let one slip under his foot, and Jonathan was away – but his 
pass for Lucas was overhit. That was an opportunity: Depor had two v two there.
 
52 min: Oh, Sandro looked certain to score after brilliant work from Suarez by 
the touchline, but a Depor collective do just enough to get there first. Alex 
Bergantinos, I think it was, with the crucial intervention.
 
50 min: Juando, incidentally, is in for Luisinho, which probably means more of 
an attacking threat from Depor.
 
49 min: Deportivo’s third forward burst in this second half, and Fajr’s 
wonderful pass releases the substitute Juando down the left, and that’s a fine 
cross for Jonathan, but he can’t keep his effort down. Another chance!
 
48 min: Bravo claims easily. That was a waste.
 
47 min: But Depor come forward again, and force a corner, their second. Chance 
from the set piece?
 
46 min: Depor get us under way, and immediately they’re on the attack, with 
Lucas marauding at pace, but Jonathan’s shot with the outside of the right foot 
is feeble, and Bravo saves comfortably.
 
Here’s Michael Hollitscher: “I remember watching the Super Depor team 
absolutely batter Barca at the Camp Nou sometime about 02-03. Barca were 
absolute garbage that year, at least until they bought Davids at the Christmas 
window. They were somewhere around 15th at the break, something we’ll never say 
about Barca again.”

Yeah, what a Deportivo team that was. They won 4-2 at Camp Nou in April 2003, 
when Roy Makaay scored two in one of the best performances from a visiting team 
in that grand old stadium. The season after, Depor won 2-0 in the November, but
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> loaned in Davids in 
the January window, went on an incredible tear, finished second, and Frank 
Rijkaard kept his job. The rest is history, etc etc.
 
Messi’s been the difference. Barca started like a train, but Depor settled 
into the game, and had frustratedBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> with their defensive block, 
but then Messi showed why he’s so good: a free kick for the ages, and the 
league leaders are ahead.

See you shortly.
 
That’s the half.
 
44 min: Pique slides in to win it, but it breaks kindly for Fajr in midfield, 
and Depor have a chance to break. The Moroccan’s forward pass is overhit, 
however, and it’s out for a goal kick. Shame.
 
43 min: The goal has sapped Depor’s energy. They want half-time.
 
41 min: That was so good. Depor had dug in, and Barca were finding it tricky 
to break them down, but a piece of individual brilliance and the hosts are 
ahead. That’s Messi’s fifth league goal of the season.
 
39 min: Oh my: what a goal! Just brilliant. Thirty yards out, to the right of 
centre, and Messi just curls one, with fizz and dip and supreme accuracy, into 
the top corner. Lux grasped thin air, like a drunk pursuing a bus. Amazing from 
Messi!

What a free kick!

37 min: Suarez goes down, and cries out as though the pain is unimaginable, 
but he’s OK, and gets the free kick. Chance for Barca here.
 
35 min: Alves fires one in from distance, but it’s over the top, and he looks 
up to the heavens for succour. Richard Dawkins won’t like that!
 
33 min: This is good from Deportivo. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> aren’t having it all their own 
way, and the visitors have an intermittent but significant threat on the break.
 
31 min: Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> force a 
corner, but they can’t make anything of it. Alves’s cross from the right finds 
Suarez free in the box, who leapt well, but his header is too high.
