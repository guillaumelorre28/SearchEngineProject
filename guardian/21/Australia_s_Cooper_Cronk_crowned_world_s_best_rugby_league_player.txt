The Golden Boot is decided by a panel of experts including ex-winner Darren 
Lockyer.


It completes a superb season by Cronk. He won his second Dally M Medal in 
2016, sharing top honours with Taumalolo.

Cronk, 33, was a key to Melbourne clinching the NRL

the grand final to Cronulla.


He also featured in Queensland’s State of Origin series triumph and was named 
player of the tournament after steering Australia to Four Nations success at 
the end of year.


Cronk also became the 25th member of the NRL’s 300-game club in 2016, his 13th 
season.
