A concussion to Kyle Turner soured South Sydney’s thrilling 20-16 win over a 
brave Penrith side at ANZ Stadium on Sunday evening. Appearing in his firstNRL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> match since breaking his neck in 
February, Turner was felled in an attempted tackle on Panthers prop Jeremy 
Latimore early in the second half.

Play was stopped for almost five minutes before the promising second-rower 
slowly got to his feet and walked from the field. Turner, who was concussed 
four times in 2014, was later cleared of any further damage to his neck 
although failed to return to the field.

An upset looked to be on the cards when Penrith, who had seven first-choice 
starters on the sideline, shot to a 12-nil lead inside the half hour mark. But 
the defending premiers moved quickly to level the score by half-time and then 
nudged ahead early in the second half before holding on for a well-earned 
victory.

Not long after Turner came from the field to a standing ovation from the 
crowd, halfback Adam Reynolds kicked the go-ahead penalty in the 48th minute.


Rabbitohs centre Dylan Walker looked to have sealed the win on a well-executed 
right-side sweep in the 67th minute, only for Lewis Brown to set up a 
grandstand finish with a long-range try in the 74th.


The Panthers had numerous opportunities to steal a win in the closing stages 
but the defending premiers held firm to consolidate their spot in the top four. 
The loss all but ends Penrith’s finals hopes.

James Segeyaro took advantage of the Panthers’ bright start to the match by 
opening the scoring with a trademark burrow from dummy half in the 16th minute. 
And an upset looked possible when Bryce Cartwright powered over from close 
range six minutes later.

But the Rabbitohs responded quickly and assertively, levelling the game in the 
space of just eight minutes. First John Sutton crashed through on a Luke Keary 
no-look pass in the 26th, before Glenn Stewart picked off Lewis Brown in front 
of his sticks for Alex Johnston to cross four minutes later.

St George Illawarra revived their NRL season, jumping back into the top eight 
with a comeback 46-24 win over Newcastle at Jubilee Oval.


The Knights were unable to capitalise on the emotion of club legend Danny 
Buderus’s first game as interim coach after Rick Stone’s sacking during the 
week as they slumped to their 13th loss from their last 15 matches.

Dragons five-eighth Gareth Widdop was the conductor on Sunday, having a hand 
in three of his side’s five second-half tries. He crossed himself in the 45th 
minute, as well as booting nine from nine.

But the game may be best remembered for Benji Marshall’s contender for try of 
the season in which the No7 touched the ball three times. After his attempted 
kick was charged down, he regathered, threw a textbook dummy and fell over the 
line after latching onto a looping Hail Mary pass from Mitch Rein.

In front of a 10,236-strong crowd at Kogarah, Paul McGregor’s side broke their 
seven-game losing streak to reignite their semi-final hopes with five rounds 
remaining.


Widdop orchestrated a second-half fightback after the Knights took a 20-14 
lead into the sheds.

The Dragons looked to be cruising after jumping out to a 12-0 advantage after 
13 minutes. However there was little joy for them for the rest of the half as 
the visitors piled on four unanswered tries in 18 minutes.

Knights prop Kade Snowden spent most of the game on the sideline with a 
concussion after being collected high by Dragons prop Leeson Ah Mau, who was 
put on report.
