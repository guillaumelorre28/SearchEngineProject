<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/27/qpr-coin-throwing-allegations-birmingham-city>
 following their defeat at Queens Park Rangers.

The Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> side have 
reiterated they have a zero tolerance policy over any violence but are unhappy 
with Rangers and the police.

Birmingham insisted they were not consulted by the Metropolitan police or 
Rangers before statements were issued on Saturday, while they are also 
concerned by some of the stewarding at Loftus Road following their 2-0 defeat.

Rangers players were celebrating a Junior Hoilett penalty after 39 minutes 
when a coin was allegedly thrown at them from an away supporters’ section of 
the stadium.

“We note allegations of coin throwing arising from the match at QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> on Saturday and we stress that the 
club will take the strongest possible action in dealing with any individual 
found to have indulged in such a deplorable act,” a statement read.

“The club also wishes to express its extreme disappointment that statements 
were released to the media during and after the match by QPR and Metropolitan 
police without consultation withBirmingham City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/birminghamcityfc> FC or West Midlands 
police.

“A number of issues have since been brought to our attention from Saturday’s 
match in regard the stewarding and policing that are of concern to the club and 
our supporters.

“We read from the Metropolitan police’s statement that three men were 
arrested, one for pitch encroachment. The QPR supporter who walked round 
pitchside to confront Birmingham City supporters was, we understand, not 
arrested.

“We will be making official representation to QPR, Metropolitan police and 
West Midlands police about these issues in order to ascertain the full facts of 
Saturday’s events and gather evidence.

“As a club we abhor violence and anti-social behaviour at football matches and 
we will co-operate fully with the relevant authorities to ensure that the 
necessary and just punishments will be meted out to those responsible.”

The incident is one in a number of recent flashpoints with objects allegedly

The Football Association has been investigating each of the incidents and 
pledged to do all it can to assist the clubs involved and police.

It is understood that no action is likely to be taken by the FA against any of 
the clubs, because it is accepted that it is impossible for clubs to fully 
safeguard against individuals throwing coins onto the pitch.
