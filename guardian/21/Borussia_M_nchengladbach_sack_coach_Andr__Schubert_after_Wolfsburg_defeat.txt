Borussia’s sporting director, Max Eberl, said: “We have held a lot of talks in 
recent days, analysed our on-the-pitch development and discussed the situation 
in detail, and together with André we have come to the conclusion that it is 
better for both sides to call an end to our collaboration.

“André helped us a great deal last season, when he led the team from the last 
place in the table to fourth place and the playoffs at the start of this season 
into the Champions League. But the development has stalled for various reasons. 
We decided to refresh things with another coach.”

Schubert said: “This change could be the right way to bring the club, which is 
always more important and bigger than any individual, back to success. I’m 
grateful for a great experience with great people.”
