Who is he?

A writer/director whose film debut, a black comedy called The Guard, opens the 
Edinburgh film festival next week.Brendan Gleeson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/brendan-gleeson> stars as an acid‑dropping, 
evidence-destroying, un-PC cop in a sleepy Galway town.

He's not by any chance related to Martin McDonagh, director of the Brendon 
Gleeson-starring black comedy In Bruges, is he?

They're brothers. Martin has an exec producer credit on The Guard. "That 
basically meant he gave Brendan Gleeson the script and got him to read it," 
John says. Don Cheadle co-stars as a humourless FBI agent parachuted in to 
smash an international cocaine smuggling ring.

How does The Guard compare to In Bruges?

It's cut from the same cloth, certainly. The script contains some cracking 
one‑liners. Here's an ex-IRA man to Gleeson, surprised to learn the Provos 
recruited gay men: "Sure, it was the only way we could successfully infiltrate 
MI5." The film belongs to the unstoppable Gleeson: deadpan, antagonistic and 
fractionally melancholic. McDonagh says he could relate to the character's 
end‑of‑his‑tether state of mind.

Why? Did he used to be an acid-dropping Galway cop?

No. He was born and brought up in London, by Irish parents. But for years he 
struggled as a screenwriter. "I had got to that point in the film business – I 
was so pissed off and angry that all of that stuff came out in a sublimated 
way."

What next?

Directing Gleeson again, in film about a small-town priest whose community 
turns on him: "It's basically Bresson with gags."
