FULL TIME: Wycombe Wanderers 1-1 Aston Villa

There’s time for one last Villa corner, Ayew applying pressure down the left 
and earning something from nothing. It’s hit deep. Lyden tries to salvage it, 
but it’s no good, and the full-time whistle goes. Wycombe celebrate a brilliant 
draw - a fair result on balance - and the teams will be going back to Villa 
Park for a replay. That’s something for Gareth Ainsworth to celebrate - and he 
does, in the expansive style, on the pitch - but more frustration for Remi 
Garde, who has now gone 10 games without getting that precious first win as 
Villa boss. The replay, perhaps. Meanwhile the last word to Jonny Mills, who 
has a message for Mac‘Fisheries’ <http://www.macfisheries.co.uk/> Millings: “He 
may be interested to know that, in Serie A,Carpi have just scored 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/3890918>.”

90 min: It’s all Villa. Ayew, Gueye and Bacuna combine well down the left. 
Eventually Ayew breaks into the area and reaches the byline, but his chipped 
cross is plucked from the sky by Lynch. There will be three added minutes.

86 min: Veretout burns down the left, but his low cross is hacked clear by 
Pierre. Then Gueye has a shot from 25 yards, but it’s easily gathered by Lynch. 
Villa are pressing hard.

83 min: On the left-hand edge of the Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> D, Gestede takes a snap shot. 
His effort clips off Stewart’s boot, loops over Lynch, and off the crossbar! 
The ball flies out for a corner, from which Gestede sees another effort 
deflected over the bar, this one a header. The second set piece comes to 
naught, Ayew flashing the ball harmlessly out of play.

80 min: Ayew drives down the right wing, twists Harriman this way and that, 
enters the area, then drags a shot across Lynch and inches wide of the 
left-hand post. A decent run, and not far away at all.

78 min: Gueye strides down the middle of the park and slips a pass right for 
Bacuna, who batters a shot goalwards from 25 yards. It’s deflected out for a 
corner on the right, from which Gestede flashes a header meant for the 
top-right corner wide of the target.

77 min: Villa have certainly rediscovered the concept of energy, though. An 
increase in the tempo of their passing appears to be unsettlingWycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> a little. Problem for Villa is, 
some of that high-tempo passing isn’t that accurate, and a couple of decent 
periods of possession peter out harmlessly when simple balls fly into touch.

75 min: Richardson bursts with some vigour down the left and earns Villa a 
corner off McCarthy. Villa load the box. Richards flashes a header goalwards 
but it’s blocked and cleared easily enough. A bit better from Villa, though.

73 min: Villa have quelled much of the energy shown by Wycombe since the 
restart. Most of the play now is in the Wycombe half. But the men in yellow are 
doing very little creatively with the ball. For all Villa’s possession and 
territorial advantage,Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> 
are very comfortable right now.

71 min: Amadi-Holloway is replaced by Ugwu. Meanwhile a double change for 
Villa: Sinclair off for Ayew, and Gil swapped for Veretout. That’s a very 
strange decision by Garde: Gil has been Villa’s star turn this afternoon. Time 
for the away fans to dip once more into the Great Villa Songbook: “You don’t 
know what you’re doing.”

66 min: Gil has been Villa’s best player by a long chalk. Busy left, right and 
centre, he looks for a one-two with Richards down the right wing, but the pass 
doesn’t come back where he wants it. The pair gesticulate at each other in the 
wake of a simple misunderstanding. The pressure showing.

63 min: A gorgeous back-flick by Thompson very nearly releases Amadi-Holloway 
into space down the left. Not quite. But they come again to win a corner down 
the same flank. Jacobson’s delivery isn’t quite so good this time, which isn’t 
to take anything away from Okore’s clearing header.

60 min: A much rowdier atmosphere at Adams Park in this second half, 
reflecting the home side’s performance and the resulting change to the 
scoreline. Villa haven’t done much since the restart.

58 min: Harriman very nearly powers past Richards down the right. He can’t do 
enough to break into the box, but does win a corner. From the set piece,Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> work some space on the right. 
Harriman crosses. Bunn comes out and clatters into Pierre, and is ludicrously 
awarded a free kick, the pressure relieved. Had the referee not blown his 
whistle, Wood had a free shot at an unguarded goal.

57 min: Aston Villa look a little rattled here. A lot of frowning going on. 
Wycombe are first to most of the balls in midfield. Bunn launches a drop kick 
down the park, miles over everyone’s head, and out of play for a goal kick to
Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe>. Quite a bit of ironic 
cheering. The confidence gained by a decent first half already looks to have 
gone south.

55 min: Bacuna gets a fine effort up and down, over the wall, the ball heading 
towards the bottom left. Lynch gets down to grab, which he does at the second 
attempt, Sinclair sniffing around at the loose ball. Fine keeping from the 
young man.

51 min: How are Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> not 
ahead?! Thompson tears down the right and scoops a brilliant cross to the far 
post. On the left-hand edge of the six-yard box, Wood creams a volley towards 
the bottom right. Bunn is beaten, but Okore clears off the line. Wonderful play 
all round.

GOAL! Wycombe Wanderers 1-1 Aston Villa (Jacobson 50)

Jacobson has fired some delicious corners into the mixer today. He’s dead-eyed 
from the spot, too, blasting confidently into the left-hand portion of the goal 
with Bunn diving the other way. This is on!

Penalty to Wycombe!

48 min: The home side have come out with renewed vigour. A high ball down the 
right. Just inside the box, Westwood goes up with Bloomfield. He’s all over the
Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> man’s back, and clatters 
his arm into his face too. The referee instantly points to the spot. Villa 
argue quite a lot, but they’ll not be changing his mind. Westwood is booked, 
too.

47 min: Wood whips a cross in deep from the left. Bloomfield, at the far post, 
opts to head back inside towards Harriman instead of taking the ball down and 
blootering goalwards. Wrong choice. Villa mop up.

And we're off again!

After warming up with some elaborate high kicks, Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> get the ball rolling for the 
second half. Bloomfield very nearly bustles his way clear down the right, but 
Okore puts a stop to his gallop.

HALF TIME: Wycombe Wanderers 0-1 Aston Villa

A flurry of activity at the end of the half. Gil, Bacuna and Gueye take turns 
to dribble across the front of theWycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> area. None of them can work an 
opening for a shot. O’Nein blocks and clears. Then there’s a free kick for 
Villa down the right, but Gil sends the ball harmlessly out of play to the 
right. And finally Bloomfield has a chance to release Wood clear on goal down 
the inside-left, but plays the pass too strongly and too far ahead of his 
team-mate. The whistle goes at the end of an entertaining half. Villa 
deservedly in front, but the League Two side have done enough at a couple of 
corners for a little succour. It should be a cracking second half!

42 min: From the retake, Jacobson - whose delivery has been consistently 
excellent - finds the head of Pierre, six yards out. He should score, but 
blasts a horrible effort over the bar. Pierre has the good grace to look 
utterly livid with himself as he trots back upfield.

39 min: It’s lashing down. Gana jigs down the left and earns Villa a corner. 
The ball’s hit deep. Gestede flicks on. Richards tries to connect at the far 
post, but he’s tugged back by Stewart. It’s only a light yank, but you’ve seen 
them given. However, Richards doesn’t really claim the penalty kick, and the 
referee waves play on.

37 min: Wycombe have picked up the pace a bit. Wood whips a low cross into the 
Villa box from the left. Harriman, coming in from the right, should meet it and 
shoot from 12 yards out, level with the right-hand post. But he decides to 
shuffle his feet before taking the shot, and the over-elaborate set-up allows 
Richardson to slide in and batter the ball clear. What a chance spurned. 
Brilliant sliding tackle, mind; if he’d got that wrong,Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> would be looking to equalise 
from the spot.

There’s time for one last Villa corner, Ayew applying pressure down the left 
and earning something from nothing. It’s hit deep. Lyden tries to salvage it, 
but it’s no good, and the full-time whistle goes. Wycombe celebrate a brilliant 
draw - a fair result on balance - and the teams will be going back to Villa 
Park for a replay. That’s something for Gareth Ainsworth to celebrate - and he 
does, in the expansive style, on the pitch - but more frustration for Remi 
Garde, who has now gone 10 games without getting that precious first win as 
Villa boss. The replay, perhaps. Meanwhile the last word to Jonny Mills, who 
has a message for Mac‘Fisheries’ <http://www.macfisheries.co.uk/> Millings: “He 
may be interested to know that, in Serie A,Carpi have just scored 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/3890918>.”

90 min +2: Villa press and press, but Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> are holding firm on the edge of 
their own area. The Premier League side don’t have the wit to open them up.

90 min +1: Harriman is booked for tugging Richardson’s shirt.
 
90 min: It’s all Villa. Ayew, Gueye and Bacuna combine well down the left. 
Eventually Ayew breaks into the area and reaches the byline, but his chipped 
cross is plucked from the sky by Lynch. There will be three added minutes.
 
88 min: Ayew, who has looked purposeful since coming on, bombs down the right 
but is brushed off the ball by Pierre, who shepherds it out of play to great 
cheers. Meanwhile there’s a suspicion that Mac Millings hasn’t been totally 
gripped by this afternoon’s action. “Steve Guppy used to play forWycombe

Zinsardine Zidanchovy.
 
86 min: Veretout burns down the left, but his low cross is hacked clear by 
Pierre. Then Gueye has a shot from 25 yards, but it’s easily gathered by Lynch. 
Villa are pressing hard.
 
84 min: Lyden comes on for his Villa debut, replacing Richards. Pierre has 
injured his head, and gets it wrapped in a Terry Butcher tribute bandage.
 
83 min: On the left-hand edge of the Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> D, Gestede takes a snap shot. 
His effort clips off Stewart’s boot, loops over Lynch, and off the crossbar! 
The ball flies out for a corner, from which Gestede sees another effort 
deflected over the bar, this one a header. The second set piece comes to 
naught, Ayew flashing the ball harmlessly out of play.
 
81 min: Bloomfield is replaced by McGinn.
 
80 min: Ayew drives down the right wing, twists Harriman this way and that, 
enters the area, then drags a shot across Lynch and inches wide of the 
left-hand post. A decent run, and not far away at all.
 
78 min: Gueye strides down the middle of the park and slips a pass right for 
Bacuna, who batters a shot goalwards from 25 yards. It’s deflected out for a 
corner on the right, from which Gestede flashes a header meant for the 
top-right corner wide of the target.
 
77 min: Villa have certainly rediscovered the concept of energy, though. An 
increase in the tempo of their passing appears to be unsettlingWycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> a little. Problem for Villa is, 
some of that high-tempo passing isn’t that accurate, and a couple of decent 
periods of possession peter out harmlessly when simple balls fly into touch.
 
75 min: Richardson bursts with some vigour down the left and earns Villa a 
corner off McCarthy. Villa load the box. Richards flashes a header goalwards 
but it’s blocked and cleared easily enough. A bit better from Villa, though.
 
73 min: Villa have quelled much of the energy shown by Wycombe since the 
restart. Most of the play now is in the Wycombe half. But the men in yellow are 
doing very little creatively with the ball. For all Villa’s possession and 
territorial advantage,Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> 
are very comfortable right now.
 
71 min: Amadi-Holloway is replaced by Ugwu. Meanwhile a double change for 
Villa: Sinclair off for Ayew, and Gil swapped for Veretout. That’s a very 
strange decision by Garde: Gil has been Villa’s star turn this afternoon. Time 
for the away fans to dip once more into the Great Villa Songbook: “You don’t 
know what you’re doing.”

68 min: Sinclair dribbles into the Wycombe box from the right. He nearly works 
space to shoot, but Stewart and Pierre both close him down.Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> go up the other end, Wood shoved 
to the floor by Okore. A free kick, which Wood swings onto Stewart’s head. A 
powerful effort from the edge of the box flies over the bar.
 
66 min: Gil has been Villa’s best player by a long chalk. Busy left, right and 
centre, he looks for a one-two with Richards down the right wing, but the pass 
doesn’t come back where he wants it. The pair gesticulate at each other in the 
wake of a simple misunderstanding. The pressure showing.
 
63 min: A gorgeous back-flick by Thompson very nearly releases Amadi-Holloway 
into space down the left. Not quite. But they come again to win a corner down 
the same flank. Jacobson’s delivery isn’t quite so good this time, which isn’t 
to take anything away from Okore’s clearing header.
 
60 min: A much rowdier atmosphere at Adams Park in this second half, 
reflecting the home side’s performance and the resulting change to the 
scoreline. Villa haven’t done much since the restart.
 
58 min: Harriman very nearly powers past Richards down the right. He can’t do 
enough to break into the box, but does win a corner. From the set piece,Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> work some space on the right. 
Harriman crosses. Bunn comes out and clatters into Pierre, and is ludicrously 
awarded a free kick, the pressure relieved. Had the referee not blown his 
whistle, Wood had a free shot at an unguarded goal.
 
57 min: Aston Villa look a little rattled here. A lot of frowning going on. 
Wycombe are first to most of the balls in midfield. Bunn launches a drop kick 
down the park, miles over everyone’s head, and out of play for a goal kick to
Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe>. Quite a bit of ironic 
cheering. The confidence gained by a decent first half already looks to have 
gone south.
 
55 min: Bacuna gets a fine effort up and down, over the wall, the ball heading 
towards the bottom left. Lynch gets down to grab, which he does at the second 
attempt, Sinclair sniffing around at the loose ball. Fine keeping from the 
young man.

54 min: Gil tries to burst down the inside-left channel and is blocked by 
Bloomfield. A free kick in a fairly dangerous position, 25 yards from theWycombe
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> goal in a fairly central 
position.
 
52 min: An over-eager Amadi-Holloway is quite correctly booked for a high knee 
on Richards.
 
51 min: How are Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> not 
ahead?! Thompson tears down the right and scoops a brilliant cross to the far 
post. On the left-hand edge of the six-yard box, Wood creams a volley towards 
the bottom right. Bunn is beaten, but Okore clears off the line. Wonderful play 
all round.
 
Jacobson has fired some delicious corners into the mixer today. He’s dead-eyed 
from the spot, too, blasting confidently into the left-hand portion of the goal 
with Bunn diving the other way. This is on!

48 min: The home side have come out with renewed vigour. A high ball down the 
right. Just inside the box, Westwood goes up with Bloomfield. He’s all over the
Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> man’s back, and clatters 
his arm into his face too. The referee instantly points to the spot. Villa 
argue quite a lot, but they’ll not be changing his mind. Westwood is booked, 
too.

47 min: Wood whips a cross in deep from the left. Bloomfield, at the far post, 
opts to head back inside towards Harriman instead of taking the ball down and 
blootering goalwards. Wrong choice. Villa mop up.
 
After warming up with some elaborate high kicks, Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> get the ball rolling for the 
second half. Bloomfield very nearly bustles his way clear down the right, but 
Okore puts a stop to his gallop.

A flurry of activity at the end of the half. Gil, Bacuna and Gueye take turns 
to dribble across the front of theWycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> area. None of them can work an 
opening for a shot. O’Nein blocks and clears. Then there’s a free kick for 
Villa down the right, but Gil sends the ball harmlessly out of play to the 
right. And finally Bloomfield has a chance to release Wood clear on goal down 
the inside-left, but plays the pass too strongly and too far ahead of his 
team-mate. The whistle goes at the end of an entertaining half. Villa 
deservedly in front, but the League Two side have done enough at a couple of 
corners for a little succour. It should be a cracking second half!
 
44 min: It’s really quiet at Adams Park. A result of Villa being in control of 
this game, a couple of set pieces apart. But those set pieces will giveWycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> hope for the second half.

42 min: From the retake, Jacobson - whose delivery has been consistently 
excellent - finds the head of Pierre, six yards out. He should score, but 
blasts a horrible effort over the bar. Pierre has the good grace to look 
utterly livid with himself as he trots back upfield.
 
41 min: Blooomfield and Amadi-Holloway combine well down the right to earn 
anotherWycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> corner. Jacobson 
takes. Stewart skies a shot from six yards, but they’ll get another go because 
there’s been a bit of tugging before the referee blew his whistle.
 
39 min: It’s lashing down. Gana jigs down the left and earns Villa a corner. 
The ball’s hit deep. Gestede flicks on. Richards tries to connect at the far 
post, but he’s tugged back by Stewart. It’s only a light yank, but you’ve seen 
them given. However, Richards doesn’t really claim the penalty kick, and the 
referee waves play on.
 
37 min: Wycombe have picked up the pace a bit. Wood whips a low cross into the 
Villa box from the left. Harriman, coming in from the right, should meet it and 
shoot from 12 yards out, level with the right-hand post. But he decides to 
shuffle his feet before taking the shot, and the over-elaborate set-up allows 
Richardson to slide in and batter the ball clear. What a chance spurned. 
Brilliant sliding tackle, mind; if he’d got that wrong,Wycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> would be looking to equalise 
from the spot.
