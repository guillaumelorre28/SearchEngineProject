The sweater in this picture looks fairly unremarkable, right? Wrong. According 
toBenetton <http://gb.benetton.com/shop/gb_en/women/knitwear.html>, the TV31100 
(as it is known) is the design to fulfil all your sweater needs in winter, when 
getting dressed in the morning requires giving thought to the temperature 
outside.

Named after the postcode in Italy’s Treviso, where Benetton was founded, the 
TV31100 is 90% merino wool, 10% cashmere. At £69, it isn’t cheap but it is 
likely to last. It comes in a version for men and women in a choice of six 
colours, ranging from mustard yellow to can’t-go-wrong black like the one I am 
wearing above. It’s even waste-free, being produced without seams on machines 
in Benetton’s Treviso factory, with each sweater taking an hour to knit. Even 
those less fussed about sustainability will be pleased to hear that you can 
also stick it in a 30-degree wash. Convenience scores on most people’s idea of 
the perfect sweater.

Benetton has been around for more than 50 years and knitwear was central to 
its origins: the first Benetton clothes were knitted. A Benetton sweater – with 
that friendly knitting-stitch logo – became a must-have for slightly upscale 
teenagers everywhere in the 80s. The brand still has knitwear at its core but 
has since seen competition from other brands including Gap, John Smedley and
Uniqlo <http://www.uniqlo.com/uk/store/goods/179476>, where another version of 
the perfect sweater exists for £24.90.

So does this Benetton’s version live up to its promise? The tag boasts that it 
is “designed to provide a perfect fit and absolute freedom of movement”. I 
would back that up after trying one for a day. The wool/cashmere combo makes it 
feel lovely to wear, with a T-shirt underneath or without. It’s very light and 
free of that overheating thing that proper wool does. I wore it in a men’s 
medium because I like my knitwear slouchy, but it would work just as well more 
fitted.

Of course, the perfect sweater is – if we’re honest – pretty unremarkable. 
It’s about as far away from statement knitwear as it is possible to be; instead 
it’s the kind ofZuckerberg-approved generic item 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/26/mark-zuckerberg-back-to-work-grey-wardrobe-stylewatch>
 that the Facebook founder might buy in bulk. And that, of course, may be part 
of its perfection. Real “look-at-me” items need a counterweight of boring to 
make them work, and this is an item of clothing that you’ll wear over and over 
again this winter, layered-up as the temperature drops, slung over shorter 
lengths when spring finally comes along. It’s useful, it fulfils its function 
and, even in the most boring way, that makes it pretty perfect.
