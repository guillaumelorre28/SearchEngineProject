Tony Pulis has confirmed Saido Berahino was offered a new deal by West 
Bromwich Albion <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom> this week but 
the striker has so far refused to sign it.

Berahino, whose contract at The Hawthorns is due to expire in June, has played 
only 245 minutes for Albion in the Premier League so far this season having 
been frozen out of the first team squad since October.

“The club has offered him a new contract not just this week, but in previous 
months too, so they’ve been in negotiations with Saido, so we’ll just see how 
that pans out,” said Pulis. “The deals have been on the table for the boy and 
his agent – we’ll see how that pans out. Again, we’ve hit the funny month. He’s 
only got one more month left of this if he doesn’t sign, so that’s probably a 
bonus for me.

“If we sell him we will work very hard to get a replacement in. If we don’t 
sell him, we’ll have to work very hard to get him back to what he was 18 months 
ago.”

Earlier on Friday, the 23-year-old posted a message on Instagram in which he 
hit back at suggestions by Pulis he is not in condition to play. “They say i 
aint fit #ok,” he wrote, accompanied by two angry face emoticons. The message 
was later deleted.
