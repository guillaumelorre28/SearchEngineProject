How many people reading this can say, hand on heart, that they are 100% 
confident about all aspects of English grammar? I'm assuming only a small 
minority have raised a hand. For the rest, our webchat withDavid Marsh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidmarsh>, editor of the Guardian Style 
Guide <https://twitter.com/guardianstyle>, may provide some help.

If you're one of those who have sweated over unwittingly showing your 
ignorance of "correct English" by misusing a comma or hyphen in an email to, 
say, a potential employer, or perhaps worse, in a tweet to the whole world, 
then this is your moment. And while we're on the subject; what is the correct 
way to begin an email to a potential boss? Dear? To? Hi? And can I begin this 
sentence with "and"?

Join Marsh on Friday 1 November, for answers all your questions on the 
subject. His masterclass starts at 12noon (GMT) but you are welcome to start 
posting your question in the thread below, and then come back on Friday to join 
in the conversation.

We have posted the questions and answers here to make the conversation easier 
to follow:


MythicalMagpie asked 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28437314>:

And, am I allowed to start a sentence with 'so'?

And, am I allowed to start a sentence with 'and'?

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28473782>:

You can begin a sentence with any word you like, including "And" and "So".

And I am sure William Blake ("And did those feet in ancient times?") would 
agree with me.

So one reason to buy the book is that it may help people to stop fretting 
about "rules" that aren't really rules at all.

bf2142 asked <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28470802>:

Doth thou still use whilst?

David Marsh replied: 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474070>:

Verily, I think that whilst, like amongst, is best reserved for old-fashioned 
poetry and, perhaps, greeting cards.

For some reason this reminds me that when I joined the Guardian in 1996, the 
then stylebook had the following two entries:

AMOK
See amuck

AMUCK
See amok

Katy Quigley asked 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28464576>:

Is he also in charge of spelling?!

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28473963>:

Hi Katy. Yes he is, I'm afraid.

The first thing we do with new journalists nowadays is explain carefully that 
it's spelt G-U-A-R-D-I-A-N, not "Grauniad", so I feel we are making progress.

metalvendetta asked 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474623>:

Is the less/fewer distinction still enforced?

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474788>:

In these parts, yes it is. I go round the office slapping people with a ruler 
if they get it wrong.

There was a successful campaign a few years ago to persuade Tesco to say "five 
items or fewer" rather than "less", which gives me hope that my own campaign to 
persuade the biggest supermarket in the UK to put an apostrophe in "Mens" and 
"Womens" may yet prove effective.

sirenabergman asked 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474379>:

Not strictly a grammar question but I hope you'll accept some semantics. How 
do you feel about the new definition of 'literally' being effectively (with an 
e) synonymous with 'figuratively'?

And where to go with the erosion of the last refuge of the modest and 
chaste-souled when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively 
invaded?

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474662>:

Many grammarians have no problem with this as they see it as just another 
example of language change.

To me it seems perverse to use a word to mean something like its opposite. The 
literal meaning of literally can be quite useful â€“ "I've literally not eaten 
all day" means you are likely to be ravenous, not that you feel a bit peckish.

Figurative use of the word may also distract the reader by sounding comical, 
as in "United literally came back from the dead" or "he literally exploded into 
action".

chrisiswonderful asked 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28454500>:

Dear Dave

I would love to know the correct usage of affect and effect. As they're both 
verbs and nouns and just one vowel between the two I'm left affecting that my 
grammatical effects have the correct affect on the reader. Did it effect them? 
Are they affected? Is the event the effect and the affect the effect of affects?

I'm in the dark

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474238>:

Dear Chris,

To quote from the book that you are generously allowing me to plug:

affect (verb): have an impact on; effect (noun): impact.

Overwork was affecting his health but had little effect on his bank balance.

To make it interesting, effect is also a verb, meaning make something happen:

I hope my book will effect a change in standards of reading and writing.

You can also "affect", say, a posh accent, which may lead to people describing 
you as "affected".

Yours, Dave

Lindsey Clark asked 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28465154>:

Could you tell me why we say...

'He walked until he had reached the garden.'

instead of (or as well as)

'He walked until he reached the garden.'

I know it's something to do with the time conjunction 'until', as the same 
thing can happen after 'when'. Grammar books 'explain' this use of the past 
perfect after time conjunctions as 'something that happens sometimes', which is 
hardly satisfactory. I'm an English teacher and it's very confusing for 
students as we tell them that the past perfect is the 'past of the past', but 
in this case reaching the garden clearly happens AFTER walking, not before.

Could you shed some light on it? Thanks!

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475012>:

Lindsey, I've been wrestling with this one since you posted it yesterday. 
Which shows what an exciting life I lead.

Anyway, I have come to the conclusion that, while we could have an interesting 
discussion about the tiny difference in meaning between the two versions, life 
is too short to worry about it. Most native English speakers would make no 
distinction between the two.

See my remarks elsewhere about Tesco's use of the apostrophe. There are more 
important things to worry your students about than arcane stuff about tenses. I 
can see the value of reported speech, and fight a constant (usually losing) 
battle to persuade Guardian journalists to use it properly, but I reckon that 
if even an English teacher doesn't understand the difference in your examples, 
and I don't either, your students are highly unlikely to grasp it.

saynotoidiocy asked 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474688>:

Is it subeditor, or sub-editor?

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475133>:

We spell it subeditor (cf subcontinent, subcommittee). I have to say, however, 
that hardly anyone has copied us since I dropped the comma at least a dozen 
years ago. The same applies to thinktank. Perhaps the Guardian is just too far 
ahead of its time. Or wrong.

Shakaroo asked <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474819>:

Is HMRC plural? Whenever I write "HMRC is looking into it" someone changes it 
to "HMRC are looking into it".

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475244>:

Colloquially, most normal people would probably use the plural: the government 
say we are all in it together, HMRC are cracking down on tax avoidance, Tesco 
are going to take my advice over using the apostrophe, etc.

Formally, most newspapers treat such organisations as singular: HMRC is, the 
government is, Tesco is, etc. Although sports teams are plural: Wednesday are 
certain to get relegated this season, etc.

Opimian asked <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474722>:

Could you put something in the Guardian Style Guide about the correct use of 
'former' and 'latter'?
So many Guardian writers say "the latter" after a list of more than two. If 
there are two nouns in the preceding sentence you can say 'former' and 
'latter'; more than two and it becomes 'first' and 'last'.

(I sneaked a semi-colon in there. I love semi-colons.)

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475611>:

Thank you, Opimian, for reminding me that I meant to do this, but forgot.

It is, however, in the book:

Saying an item is "the latter" of more than two things is not only annoying 
but wrong. In such cases, it should be "last". It's best to treat latter as I 
have done in this chapter, and use it only in contrast with former.

Cormaic asked <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476101>:

Following on from the not quite literal use of "literally", is there any 
chance of the word "quite" getting one standard definition rather than two 
opposite ones?

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476263>:

I quite agree that it's quite tricky. From the book:

"I'm quite tired" means "I'm fairly tired."
"Have you quite finished?" means "have you completely finished?" and comes 
with a built-in note of irritation.
"Quite!" means "I agree!"
This is a word that you can use in all innocence in an email only to discover 
later that you have offended the recipient, so it might be better to say 
completely, fairly or something else less prone to ambiguity.

alicepleasanceliddel asked 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475557>:

Any thoughts on the use of 'he was sat at the table' over 'he was sitting at 
the table'?

"was sat' seems to be everywhere, I've even heard teachers using it. Many 
writers use it now. Is this a change we should just put up with?

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476088>:

Why, friend, there is a section on this very verb in For Who the Bell Tolls. 
So why haven't you bought a copy? Anyway, this is what it says:

You add the infinitive, sit, the present participle, sitting, or the past 
participle, sat, to an auxiliary verb to get the right tense.

I may have sat at the table in the past, but now I am sitting there.

Participles are tricky, which explains why Ernie Wise got so many laughs from 
the phrase "the book what I wrote".

ID473520 asked <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475871>:

Hi David,

Any thoughts on Russell Brand's recent outpourings in which he used the word 
"normalcy". Or in his interview when he used "alternate" to mean "alternative"? 
Are these acceptable?

Finally, what do you think of the current trend of asking questions by adding 
the question word to the end of a phrase? E.g. "Are these acceptable, why?"

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476670>:

You just have to accept that that's how he talks, listen to his message and 
decide what you think about it. He's probably on the way to becoming a 
"national treasure". As with John Prescott, the idiosyncratic way he expresses 
himself is what you get, loathe it or loathe it [sic].

brokenbra asked <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475887>:

Do you ever see the day when the misspelling of your to mean you're becomes so 
prolific that it is accepted as correct?

Is this an example of language evolving?

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28477259>:

Apostrophes are the difference between feeling you're nuts and feeling your 
nuts, and that's why we need them, and will continue to do so.

Chutzpah asked <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475985>:

Is it just me that hates the use of "multiple" to mean "many"?

"Many" means lots of things whereas "multiple" used to mean something that is 
manifold or in more than one state. Now multiple seems to mean many - so what 
does many mean? And what do we use when we actually mean multiple?

Thanks - indulge me with your take on this one.

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476208>:

No, I hate it too. I suggest the reason is that people think, wrongly, that 
the longer word sounds more impressive than the shorter one. Politicians and 
business people are perhaps the worst offenders. Funny how they are the very 
two groups that are always banging on about falling standards of English among 
school leavers and students.

PommieBarsteward asked 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476765>:

Sir Timothy Berners-Lee not only invented the World Wide Web but he also gave 
it to the world on a royalty-free basis. If it wasn't for him the questions 
being asked and answered above would only be thoughts in peoples' heads.

That so, why does the style guide insist on a lower case w in Web when Sir Tim 
specifically mentions that people should use a capital W? It just seems a bit 
lame to ignore his wishes.

David Marsh replied 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28477516>:

I take your point but calling it the "Web", as some American newspapers still 
do, looks old-fashioned and quaint. We used to have "Television" and 
"Wire-less" and for all I know the people who invented them used a capital T 
and W.

When it comes to a house style, you can't just follow people's own preferences 
because you would end up with a total mishmash, which would defeat the point of 
the whole exercise. (And I'd be out of a job.)
