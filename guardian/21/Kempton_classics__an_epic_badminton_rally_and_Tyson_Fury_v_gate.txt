1) The world of horse racing is still stunned by the news that the owners of 
Kempton Park are proposing to demolish the course. Kempton is, of course, the 
home of the ever popular Boxing Day meet that features the King George VI Chase 
– won by Desert Orchid in1986 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U6FfMeDkiw>, 
1988,1989 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcCuIVn6egM> and 1990 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11PdQF3OOEI> and four times in a row – and 
five times in total – by Kauto Star 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTS1g4_Acvo>. Kempton, lest we forget, also 
hostedthis historic occasion in June 2010

2) Unfortunately no one has yet seen fit to put all of Wayne Rooney’s 249 
goals for Manchester United on the internet,so you’ll have to make do with a

No2 and No3 for that matter <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtwiGBn1BQw>. And 
one more (non-United) goal for luck –remember the name …
