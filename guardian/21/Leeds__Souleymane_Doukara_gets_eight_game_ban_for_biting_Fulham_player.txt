The Leeds United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leedsunited> forward 
Souleymane Doukara has been banned for eight matches by the Football 
Association for biting.

The incident happened early in the second half of the home match against Fulham
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> in February. The defender 
Fernando Amorebieta was the victim and was shown a yellow card for his 
reaction. He was later sent off for a second bookable offence.

An FA statement said: “Souleymane Doukara will serve an eight-match suspension 
with immediate effect after he was found to have committed an act of violent 
conduct. The Leeds United forward was charged following an incident which 
occurred in the 54th minute of the game against Fulham on 23 February, 2016.

“The breach of FA rule E3, which the player denied at an independent 
regulatory commission hearing, was considered a non-standard case given the 
seriousness and both unusual and violent nature of the misconduct. Mr Doukara 
was also warned as to his future conduct and fined £5,000.”

Leeds have nine Championship games left, beginning against their Yorkshire 
rivals Rotherham on Saturday. Doukara, who has scored five goals in 27 
appearances this term, will be eligible to return for their final Championship 
game of the season, at Preston on 7 May.

Leeds said in a statement: “The club is unable to comment on this matter in 
any further detail until the full written judgment is released. Suffice to say, 
however, the club is disappointed with the outcome and the length of the ban 
given to Souleymane Doukara.”
