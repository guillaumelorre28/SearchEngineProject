So a seventh 1-0 win of the season, an eighth by just one goal and an tenth in 
which Inter have scored a single goal and no more. Still, it’s working, as this 
victory takes them three points clear of Fiorentina at the top ofSerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> - at least until they 
play Sampdoria later.

90 mins + 5: Inter have an attack, the two choices for Perisic and then 
Kondogbia to either shoot or keep the thing in the corners, but they choose 
mystery option No.3, which is ‘give it away pointlessly.’

90 mins +3: Weird how you only get cramp in the last minute when you’re 
defending a lead. Murillo goes down with a particularly convenient case, and 
this time is replaced by Ranocchia.

90 mins + 2: Padelli seems to be on some sort of mission to make this even 
more difficult for himself and his team. He dribbles around Perisic as the 
Inter man tries to close him down, and while he just about manages it, that 
was...risky.

89 mins: Padelli and two of his defenders have just spent the last 30 seconds 
passing it rather dangerously around between themselves. Dangerous enough at 
the best of times, but rather baffling when they’ve just brought a big lump on 
to aim at up top.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino>, as Vives finds some room and 
breaks in from the left, but Handanovic dashes out and smothers his shot 
excellently. The Inter keeper has been immense today.

80 mins: Big chance for Torino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino>. 
Baselli clips a lovely ball over the top, Quagliarella’s first touch isn’t 
great as it stops his forward motion and has to dig out the shot rather, but he 
does and skids it towards the near-post, and Handanovic gets down well to shove

74 mins: Nice try, Peres. He stretches to take Nagatomo down as he breaks on 
the left, then tries to garner sympathy and avoid a booking by claiming he’s 
injured/has cramp. It doesn’t work, and the yellow is duly flashed.

68 mins: Perisic causes problems straight away on the left of the Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> area, but his cross is blocked 
and put behind for a corner. Meanwhile Murillo is on the turf, after what 
looked like a clash of knees. Painful, but you’d reckon he’ll be fine

66 mins: Howls for a penalty from the home crowd as the newly-introduced Lopez 
tumbles in the box, but despite a vague hint of a touch from behind by Jesus 
(leave it), the ref was right not to give that one.

65 mins: Kondogbia belts through towards the penalty area, pulls back his foot 
to take his shot but Glik puts in the meatiest challenge you can while still 
being fair and saves his team. What a tackle that was.
 Geoffrey Kondogbia is denied by a terrific last-ditch tackle from Kamil Glik.

63 mins: Benassi tries to break in from the left, but Medel takes him down

59 mins: Nagatomo goes up for a header and lands bloody hard on his 
back/neck/head. Play goes on, but Torino’s attack peters out as Handanovic 
claims. Fortunately it looks like Nagatomo is OK, but that was a nasty fall.

53 mins: If Big Ron was commentating on this game he’d say Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> are ‘knocking on the door’. 
Belotti goes down and stays there, but the ball breaks to Peres on the right 
who fires in a most dangerous low cross, but Quagliarella can’t get there to 
turn it home.

50 mins: Two more quick saves from Handanovic - firstly from Belotti again, 
and then from Quagliarella as the veteran forward breaks in from the right.
Torino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> have come out from the 
break very much in the mood. Mancini is extremely cross on the touchline, 
looking as fierce as a man wearing a tank top and a light scarf can do.
 Inter boss Roberto Mancini looks on, and doesn’t like what he sees.

48 mins: How on earth did that stay out? The corner is cleared, but Molinaro 
clips a cross over from the right which finds Quagliarella in an absurd amount 
of space around eight yards from goal. His flick is saved, it falls to Belotti 
who’s in similarly generous room but he can’t force it over the line, 
Handanovic making a superb save and getting a boot to the mush for his troubles.

Decent half, that. Inter didn’t exactly start like a train and haven’t really 
dominated, but they deserve the 1-0 lead. Icardi has looked a little more 
dangerous and while Torino’s biggest threat has come from their midfield, 
they’ve been kept relatively quiet thus far.

45 mins + 2: Half chance for Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> after Quagliarella flicks one on 
at the near-post, but there’s nobody around to capitalise. Meanwhile, there are 
some half-appeals at the other end for a penalty after Icardi played the ball 
onto Vives’s forearm, but that would have been hugely harsh.

So a seventh 1-0 win of the season, an eighth by just one goal and an tenth in 
which Inter have scored a single goal and no more. Still, it’s working, as this 
victory takes them three points clear of Fiorentina at the top ofSerie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball> - at least until they 
play Sampdoria later.

.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
90 mins + 7: Molinaro on the left, his chance to put a cross into a dangerous 
area...but instead he hoys it over the bar.
 
90 mins + 6: Perisic again, the ball in the corner, but he runs it out of play.
 
90 mins + 5: Inter have an attack, the two choices for Perisic and then 
Kondogbia to either shoot or keep the thing in the corners, but they choose 
mystery option No.3, which is ‘give it away pointlessly.’
 
90 mins +3: Weird how you only get cramp in the last minute when you’re 
defending a lead. Murillo goes down with a particularly convenient case, and 
this time is replaced by Ranocchia.
 
90 mins + 2: Padelli seems to be on some sort of mission to make this even 
more difficult for himself and his team. He dribbles around Perisic as the 
Inter man tries to close him down, and while he just about manages it, that 
was...risky.
 
90 mins: Six (6!) minutes of added time. Quite where that has come from is 
unclear.
 
89 mins: Padelli and two of his defenders have just spent the last 30 seconds 
passing it rather dangerously around between themselves. Dangerous enough at 
the best of times, but rather baffling when they’ve just brought a big lump on 
to aim at up top.
 
88 mins: Another chance for Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino>, as Vives finds some room and 
breaks in from the left, but Handanovic dashes out and smothers his shot 
excellently. The Inter keeper has been immense today.
 
87 mins: Hard man Medel goes down clutching his face as if taken down with a 
mighty axe, when in reality he received a brief brush from Vives’s hand.
 
85 mins: Glik clips a long ball aiming for the big man, Amauri heads it down 
for Quagliarella around 30 yards out but he bloots the thing well over.
 
82 mins: Change for Torino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino>, as 
Baselli comes off, replaced by the old boy Amauri. Three up top for the home 
side, and they have a combined age of 98.
 
81 mins: Inter counter, and Ljajic cuts in with plenty of space on the edge of 
the box, but he spoons his shot miles, miles over.
 
80 mins: Big chance for Torino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino>. 
Baselli clips a lovely ball over the top, Quagliarella’s first touch isn’t 
great as it stops his forward motion and has to dig out the shot rather, but he 
does and skids it towards the near-post, and Handanovic gets down well to shove 
it away.
 
78 mins: Benassi can’t get any satisfaction as his low, cut-back cross from 
the right is behind the waiting attackers and is cleared.
 
77 mins: Looks like Mancini is happy with another 1-0 win, which will be their 
seventh of the season if they hold on. Change forTorino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino>, as Peres goes off and the 
splendidly-named Davide Zappacosta comes on.
 
76 mins: Ranocchia has his trackie back on, disappointingly. Instead, Adem 
Ljajic replaces Palacio.
 
74 mins: Nice try, Peres. He stretches to take Nagatomo down as he breaks on 
the left, then tries to garner sympathy and avoid a booking by claiming he’s 
injured/has cramp. It doesn’t work, and the yellow is duly flashed.
 
71 mins: Another Torino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> penalty 
shout - this time after Murillo (back on for now) falls to the floor and heads 
the ball from there, with the home lot trying to convince everyone he’d used 
his hands. He had not.
 
70 mins: Actually, Murillo might not be fine. Andrea Ranocchia is readying 
himself to come on, which should introduce a little chaos to things.
 
68 mins: Perisic causes problems straight away on the left of the Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> area, but his cross is blocked 
and put behind for a corner. Meanwhile Murillo is on the turf, after what 
looked like a clash of knees. Painful, but you’d reckon he’ll be fine 
eventually.
 
67 mins: Change for Inter - Icardi comes off, interestingly. Ivan Perisic 
comes on.
 
66 mins: Howls for a penalty from the home crowd as the newly-introduced Lopez 
tumbles in the box, but despite a vague hint of a touch from behind by Jesus 
(leave it), the ref was right not to give that one.
 
65 mins: Kondogbia belts through towards the penalty area, pulls back his foot 
to take his shot but Glik puts in the meatiest challenge you can while still 
being fair and saves his team. What a tackle that was.

63 mins: Benassi tries to break in from the left, but Medel takes him down 
with a mixture of his arm and leg. Just to make sure, like. A booking, you 
won’t be stunned to learn.
 
62 mins: Change for Torino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> - 
Belotti is off, and Maxi Lopez comes on. The home crowd don’t sound at all 
delighted about the man coming off.
 
61 mins: Quieter period now. Inter try to reclaim something approaching 
control by knocking the thing around the back, and for the momentTorino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> seem happy to let them.
 
59 mins: Nagatomo goes up for a header and lands bloody hard on his 
back/neck/head. Play goes on, but Torino’s attack peters out as Handanovic 
claims. Fortunately it looks like Nagatomo is OK, but that was a nasty fall.
 
57 mins: Nagatomo wins a free-kick on the right in a rare foray into the Torino
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> half.
 
54 mins: Inter look in some bother here as another nascent Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> attack is just about repelled. 
They need a stern ticking off from the man in the smart casual attire.
 
53 mins: If Big Ron was commentating on this game he’d say Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> are ‘knocking on the door’. 
Belotti goes down and stays there, but the ball breaks to Peres on the right 
who fires in a most dangerous low cross, but Quagliarella can’t get there to 
turn it home.
 
50 mins: Two more quick saves from Handanovic - firstly from Belotti again, 
and then from Quagliarella as the veteran forward breaks in from the right.
Torino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> have come out from the 
break very much in the mood. Mancini is extremely cross on the touchline, 
looking as fierce as a man wearing a tank top and a light scarf can do.
 Inter boss Roberto Mancini looks on, and doesn’t like what he sees.

48 mins: How on earth did that stay out? The corner is cleared, but Molinaro 
clips a cross over from the right which finds Quagliarella in an absurd amount 
of space around eight yards from goal. His flick is saved, it falls to Belotti 
who’s in similarly generous room but he can’t force it over the line, 
Handanovic making a superb save and getting a boot to the mush for his troubles.
 
47 mins: Benassi pulls Nagatomo’s pants down on the Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> right and drives down the flank, 
his cross put behind for a corner.
 
46 mins: And we’re away. Murillo hoofs a long one up to Icardi, but he fouls 
Glik and that’s that one done.
 
The players are back out, the ref is checking his call centre-esque mic and 
earpiece.
 
Meanwhile, in nonsense...

Decent half, that. Inter didn’t exactly start like a train and haven’t really 
dominated, but they deserve the 1-0 lead. Icardi has looked a little more 
dangerous and while Torino’s biggest threat has come from their midfield, 
they’ve been kept relatively quiet thus far.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins + 2: Half chance for Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino> after Quagliarella flicks one on 
at the near-post, but there’s nobody around to capitalise. Meanwhile, there are 
some half-appeals at the other end for a penalty after Icardi played the ball 
onto Vives’s forearm, but that would have been hugely harsh.
 
45 mins: Chance for Torino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/torino>, but 
Belotti’s shot is charged down with some gusto by Murillo. Two minutes of added 
time to be played.
 
44 mins: Nagatomo whips the free-kick into the box, but Padelli does his Lidl 
Superman act, dives out and punches clear.
 
43 mins: Nagatomo is wrestled to the ground by Peres near the corner flag, and 
there’s a free-kick in a dangerous position =here for Inter.
 
41 mins: Big penalty shout for Torino as Belotti tumbles to the turf under a
