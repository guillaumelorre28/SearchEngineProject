deal that will run until 22 November.

“I’m delighted to welcome such a high-calibre player to the club,” Mowbray 
said on Coventry’s official website.

“Joe has a great pedigree, both on the domestic and international stage, and 
I’m sure he’ll have a fantastic impact during his time at the club.

“I’ve met with Joe and he has watched us play several times this season. He 
likes the way we play the game and because of that, he has shown a real 
enthusium to come and play for the club.

Sky Blues.”
