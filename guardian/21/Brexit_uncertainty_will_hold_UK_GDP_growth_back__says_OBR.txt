Weaker business spending and a squeeze on consumers from higher inflation will 
dent the UK economy next year, but warnings for a post-referendum recession 
should prove unfounded, according to the government’s independent forecasters.

The Office for Budget Responsibility 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/office-for-budget-responsibility> was 
forced to revise down its prediction made before the Brexit vote that GDP would 
rise 2.2% next year. It now sees the economy expanding by only 1.4% and warns 
there will be a knock-on effect on the public finances.


That forecast 
<http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2016/>
 was a touch more positive than the picture painted by other forecasters such 
as the International Monetary Fund, and the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond,was 
quick to point out in his autumn statement that it would leave Britain 
outperforming France and Italy next year

 and possibly Germany too.

The OBR said the main factors behind its gloomier outlook for growth next year 
and in 2018 stemmed from Brexit vote effects, including the pound’s sharp drop 
since the referendum, which has raised the cost of imports to the UK.

Presenting the fiscal watchdog’s first set of forecasts since March’s budget, 
OBR chairman Robert Chote highlighted that they were subject to a large degree 
of uncertainty as the UK prepares to embark on Brexit negotiations.

In order to factor in the impact of that process and of the UK eventually 
leaving the EU, the OBR had made some “broad brush judgments”, he said. Those 
included an assumption that the UK would leave the bloc in April 2019 and that 
the Brexit process would hit net migration and trade.

“We expect the quarterly growth rate of GDP to continue slowing into next 
year, as uncertainty over the UK’s future trade and migration regime delays 
business investment and as the fall in the pound squeezes real consumer 
spending by pushing up inflation,” said Chote.

“But growth remains positive – we have not assumed more aggressive job 
shedding or a jump in precautionary saving, both of which pose downside risks 
if the road to Brexit is bumpy.”

The growth forecast for 2018 was cut to 1.7% from 2.1% back in March, but 
growth is expected to recover to 2.1% in 2019 and 2020, the same as previous 
forecasts.

Chote noted that the OBR’s outlook was more optimistic than the average of 
other forecasters. The Bank of England, for example, alsopredicts growth will 
slow to 1.4% next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation>
 but then sees barely any improvement in 2018, with GDP expanding just 1.5%.The 
IMF forecasts UK growth of 1.1% next year

.

The tone reflects signs of resilience in the early economic indicators since 
the Brexit vote. Consumer spending has continued to grow apace, economic growth 
was stronger than expected and unemployment has dropped to an 11-year low.

Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said the OBR’s outlook reflected 
that picture.

“The OBR sees Brexit taking a smaller chunk out of UK growth than many feared 
in the wake of the referendum. The fact that the OBR’s growth forecast for 
2017, at 1.4%, is above current market estimates and twice as high as the 
market expected in July, testifies to the resilience of the UK economy,” he 
said.

But the group Economists for Brexit was critical of the OBR’s outlook as too 
downbeat.

“Whilst it acknowledges the fact that the decision of the government’s chosen 
path is uncertain, it then applies what amounts to an arbitrary Brexit penalty 
on the UK economy without any proper justification,” said Patrick Minford, the 
group’s co-chair.

 “Why does it assume lower productivity, a spending slowdown due to 
uncertainty and lower immigration?”

The OBR said in its assumptions around Brexit that productivity growth – 
already an area where the UK underperforms other big economies – would be hurt 
by weaker investment. It also flagged that the outlook for productivity growth 
remained the biggest and most important uncertainty around its projections for 
the government coffers.

“For all the attention it will receive now, Brexit has not supplanted this 
uncertainty. It has simply added to it,” said Chote.

On trade, the OBR predicts the weak pound will boost net trade over the next 
two years, with UK exports more competitive in overseas markets and imports to 
the UK less attractive relative to domestically produced goods and services. 
But longer-term it warns exiting the EU will reduce growth in exports and 
imports.

The OBR also sees the UK adopting tighter immigration controls and becoming 
less attractive as a destination for immigrants, with knock-on effects for 
economic growth and the public finances. “Our net inward migration assumption 
is unchanged since March, but we would have increased it by about 80,000 a year 
in the absence of the referendum,” said Chote.

Such an increase in net migration “would have boosted tax revenue by more than 
it would have raised spending”, he said.
