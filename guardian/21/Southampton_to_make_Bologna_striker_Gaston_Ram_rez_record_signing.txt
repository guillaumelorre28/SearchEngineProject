Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are set to 
announce a club record signing after tying up a deal to bring the Bologna 
striker Gaston Ramírez to the newly promoted Premier League club.

Ramírez, 21, has been linked with moves to both Liverpool and Tottenham this 
summer but has chosen to move to St Mary's Stadium instead.

The Uruguay international has admitted he can't wait to get started in the 
Premier League for Nigel Adkins's side, for whom the signing is a sizeable, and 
unexpected, capture.

"They believe in me in every way," Ramírez told the Italian newspaper, 
Corriere dello Sport. "And above all I have said that they are going to grow.

"Southampton is a newly promoted team in the English top flight, but they have 
the means to stand tall in a few years. And with me they are going to build. 
It's all very stimulating – even if it is a little strange."

The forward scored eight goals in Serie A last season and gives Adkins another 
option up front with the Saints manager having already signed Jay Rodriguez 
from Burnley this summer.
