All you need for the grand final of cult quiz show Only Connect is an in-depth 
knowledge of the noble gases, all the lyrics to the Madonna hit Vogue and, of 
course, an intimate knowledge of oceans that no longer exist.

In the series final of the BBC2 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc2> show 
presented by the Guardian and Observer columnist, Victoria Coren Mitchell, on 
Monday night, the String Section overtook their rivals the Wayfarers in the 
very last round to win the coveted title.


String Section, made up of American studies graduate and museum volunteer 
Tessa North, actor and musician Pete Sorel-Cameron and captained by secondary 
school teacher Richard Aubrey, failed to spot that the words foke, Hombay, 
egantic and leakfast are, of course, reversedportmanteau words

 (instead of smog, Bollywood, ginormous and brunch respectively).


But they managed to beat the Wayfarers in the final round by 15 points to 12, 
despite their opposition’s in-depth knowledge of celebrity tattoos (correctly 
spotting that Winston Churchill had an anchor inked on his forearm).


The show, considered by quiz aficionados to be one of the most difficult on 
television,made the move from BBC4 to BBC2 in September

 2014 after earning a cult following among fans of finding complex connections 
amid obscure patterns.

Since the move, Only Connect has regularly attracted more than 2 million 
viewers, with last year’s final attracting viewing figures of just over 2.5 
million.


String Section said at the beginning of the show that they were “just 
impressed to be here” after slogging it out against other logicians in the 
earlier rounds.


The show prides itself on the obscurity of the questions

 and with this year’s finalists expected to realise that the sequence AGG, GGW, 
VEG should be followed by EGE to indicate a full set of threesomes of British 
monarchs, the show’s fans can rest assured the series is not dumbing down to 
pander to its primetime slot.


Despite correctly connecting four Sanskrit words in the connecting wall round, 
where teams have to find four sets of four-word connections in a wall of words, 
the Wayfarers, made up of accountant Gerard Mackay, retired NHS secretary 
Barbara Thompson and IT consultant Matt Beatson, could not hold off their 
opposition in the final missing vowel round, where contestants have to identify 
linked phrases among a scramble of consonants.


Although there is no cash prize, flash car, or even cuddly toy for the 
winners, the kudos of winning a quiz that leaves viewers by turns flummoxed, 
headachey and feeling intellectually inferior is probably reward enough.
