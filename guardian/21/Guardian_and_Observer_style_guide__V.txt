vagina or vulva?
The vagina is an internal organ, the muscular tubular organ that connects the 
genitals to the uterus; not the same thing as the vulva, the female genitals.

As the reader who pointed out one of the many examples of our getting this 
wrong said: "I am sure an article that used the term testicles to describe the 
penis would be corrected. Why do you accept this error for women?"

All editors are journalists but not all journalists are editors. In the same

are shopworkers; some are police officers"
