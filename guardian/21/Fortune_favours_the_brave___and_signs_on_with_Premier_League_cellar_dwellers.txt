West Bromwich Albion <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom> have 
further boosted their attacking options by making Marc-Antoine Fortune their 
second January signing. The French-Guyana forward has moved to The Hawthorns on 
loan for the rest of the season from the French top-flight side Nancy, and the 
Midlands club have an option to make the switch permanent in the summer.

The 27-year-old striker, who cannot be recalled by his parent club during the 
loan, could make his debut for West Bromwich during their home encounter with 
Middlesbrough on Saturday, although the club will have to seek international 
clearance from Fifa before he is allowed to play.

Fortune's arrival comes after West Bromwich sealed the loan signing of 
Arsenal's Jay Simpson on New Year's Eve, with the 20-year-old forward scoring 
his first goal in Baggies colours in theirFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> win at Peterborough on Tuesday.

Fortune joined Nancy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nancy> in 2007 and 
his six goals last term helped them to finish fourth and qualify for the Uefa 
Cup. He began his career with a four-year stint at the French side Angoulême 
and has also enjoyed spells with Lille, Rouen (loan), Brest and FC Utrecht.

He will be competing with the current strikers Roman Bednar, Luke Moore and 
Craig Beattie plus Simpson for a starting place at West Bromwich Albion, and 
the club's manager, Tony Mowbray, is also interested in adding the Paris St 
Germain striker Péguy Luyindula and the Benfica forward Ariza Makukula to his 
squad.

Mowbray is desperate to improve a disappointing record of just 17 goals in 21 
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> games – a 
major reason why his side are languishing at the foot of the table.
