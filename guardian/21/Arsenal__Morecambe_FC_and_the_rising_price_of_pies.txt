A BBC survey into the price of football has, unsurprisingly, got people 
talking. Of course, they're mentioning the extortionate price of tickets 
(winner: Arsenal, £100 for a matchday ticket), but the real talking point has 
proved to be the price of pies. To be specific, it is the price of an Arsenal 
pie at a whopping £4. Rumours that they're made from focaccia have been 
quashed, but it still raises the question: how good are they? And, more 
specifically, are they better thanMorecambe

visitor to that team's Globe Arena will attest. In June, the club's chicken, 
ham and leek pie (chef Graham Aimson pictured) won the title of supreme 
champion at the British Pie awards. And all for £2.50. That's one footie 
accolade the Gunners won't be winning.
