Spending a busy train journey without a seat, crushed up against other 
commuters in the aisle, or crouched uncomfortably in the luggage compartment is 
an all-too-common experience for many. But you don’t expect to spot the leader 
of the opposition on the floor of a train on your way to work.

Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>, famed for 
standing up for his principles, sat down for them last week, along with 20 
other seatless commuters on a train journey from London to Newcastle.

, Corbyn is seen sitting on the floor of the train, a coffee and brown paper 
bag at his feet, readingPrivate Eye 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/private-eye>. The freelance filmmaker Yannis 
Mendez, who has been following Corbyn and works for his campaign, filmed the 
footage.

From his spot on the floor, which he chose rather than upgrading to first 
class, Corbyn turns to the camera and says: “This is a problem that many 
passengers face every day, commuters and long-distance travellers. Today this 
train is completely ram-packed. The staff are absolutely brilliant, working 
really hard to help everybody.

“The reality is there are not enough trains, we need more of them – and 
they’re also incredibly expensive.” He said the whole experience was a good 
case for public ownership.

Corbyn declined an invitation to first class from Virgin Trains staff and was 
seated about 45 minutes into the three-hour journey when staff upgraded other 
passengers.

Later, Corbyn said: “Is it fair that I should upgrade my ticket whilst others 
who might not be able to afford such a luxury should have to sit on the floor? 
It’s their money I would be spending after all.”

Ellen, a mother-of-two who travelled on the same train and and also had no 
seat, said: “It was a surprise to see him there, but it was refreshing. It made 
me realise that it shouldn’t be a surprise to see a politician travelling 
alongside average commuters. They should be on the same level as the general 
public.”

It is not the first time Corbyn has experienced the reality of Britain’s 
transport woes. During the 2015 leadership campaign he was spotted on a night 
bus after a day’s campaigning:
