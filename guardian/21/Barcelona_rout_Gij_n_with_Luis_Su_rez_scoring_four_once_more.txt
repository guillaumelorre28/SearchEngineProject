<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> remain La Liga leaders, on a 
day when the top three all won but in contrasting fashions.

Suárez scored his eighth goal in four days to fuel a 6-0 rout of Sporting 
Gijón, following another four-goal outing inthe 8-0 destruction of Deportivo La 
Coruña

.

Lionel Messi opened the scoring after only 12 minutes but it stayed 1-0 until 
the 63rd. Suárez doubled the advantage, before converting two penalties in 
quick succession for his hat-trick.

Barcelona were then awarded another penalty but this time the honour fell to 
Neymar, who made it 5-0 in the 85th minute. Suárez was not to be denied, 
however, and scored his fourth with a couple of minutes left.

Earlier, Gareth Bale scored twice, including a late winner, as Real Madrid 
came from 2-0 downto win 3-2 at Rayo Vallecano

.

Barcelona lead Atlético on the basis of their head-to-head record, with Real 
one point behind. Barcelona holds tiebreakers against both challengers.

Suárez, who surpassed his 31 for Liverpool that led the English Premier League 
in 2013-14, said he was “surprised” by his recent scoring run. He also gave 
credit to Messi.

“Leo is the one who knows what the team needs at all times,” Suárez said. “His 
magic is always there and he showed it tonight.”

Suárez’s goals at the Camp Nou, which all came in the second half and twice 
from the penalty spot, took him to the top of the Spanish league scorers’ list 
with 34, moving past Ronaldo’s 31.
