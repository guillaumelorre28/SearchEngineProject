The 26-year-old Senegalese joined Everton in February of last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/01/everton-oumar-niasse-lokomotiv-moscow>
 on the final day of the winter transfer window in a £13.5m deal from Lokomotiv 
Moscow but the move turned into a nightmare. Under Roberto Martínez, the club’s 
manager at the time, he appeared for only 152 minutes across seven fixtures 
before his situation worsened significantly over the summer.

Ronald Koeman, who succeeded Martínez, decided almost immediately that he did 
not want Niasse; he stripped him of his first-team squad number and ordered him 
to train with the club’s under-23s. When a move away from Goodison Park did not 
happen before the summer deadline, Niasse was integrated into the under-23 
team. He has scored seven goals in eight matches for them.

Niasse has been determined to show his ability to supporters in England and, 
in an interview with the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/everton-oumar-niasse-ronald-koeman-roberto-martinez>
 last October, he made it perfectly clear that if things did not work out for 
him at Everton, he would want his next club to be in the Premier League. He is 
about to get his wish at Hull.
