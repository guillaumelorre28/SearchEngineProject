It has taken Daniele Padelli some time to establish himself as Torino’s No1 
goalkeeper after a career that began in Sampdoria in 2006 but which has 
involved a variety of loans and a lot of time sitting on the bench.

Having finally earned himself a regular starting berth at Torino in Serie A 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball>, he may well find himself 
back on the bench though after an inexplicable own goal in which he took 
delivery of a simple back pass from a defender, then turned calmly to slice it 
straight into his own net.

Incredible own-goal howler from Torino's keeper as he passes the ball into the 
back of his own net.http://t.co/Vy1nOqjILf <http://t.co/Vy1nOqjILf>

The own goal gave Empoli <https://www.theguardian.com/football/empoli> a 1-0 
victory and Padelli acknowledged his mistake with an apologetic wave to the 
crowd.

The much-travelled goalkeeper played one match for Liverpool while on loan 
there in 2007. The club elected not to make his deal permanent after he 
conceded two goals in his only appearance – a 2-2 draw with Charlton which was 
Robbie Fowler’s final match for the club.
