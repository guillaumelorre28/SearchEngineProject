The heavyweight division won’t get exciting just yet

We have a new heavyweight champion after a decade of Klitschko dominance, so 
things are about to get interesting, right? Sadly, no. Batman (well, Tyson Fury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/12/tyson-fury-fighter-of-year-ring-magazine>
) is set for an April or May rematch with Wladimir Klitschko, a fight he is not 
certain to win. American hopeDeontay Wilder fights Artur Szpilka 
<http://www.barclayscenter.com/events/detail/deontay-wilder-vs-artur-szpilka> 
on Saturday, but I doubt they’ll be taking him and his precious belt anywhere 
near a live body anytime soon. Meanwhile, David Haye is having a comeback 
against a nobody on a TV channel that advertises itself as “the home of witty 
banter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/06/david-haye-fight-uktv-dave-mark-de-mori>
”, and youngsters Anthony Joshua and Joseph Parker aren’t quite ready for the 
big time. The heavyweight division is definitely going to heat up, but not 
until 2017.

Gennady Golovkin will continue to wait

Poor old GGG: always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Rumour has it that newly 
crowned middleweight champion Saul “Canelo” Alvarez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/22/canelo-alvarez-takes-middleweight-title-after-epic-against-miguel-cotto>
 will face either Gabe Rosado or Willie Monroe Jr in May. Now, where do I 
remember those names from? Oh, that’s right, they’re famous for being wrecked 
by Golovkin. The Mexican might be keen, but his team will want nothing to do 
with Golovkin in 2016, so the Kazakh killer will be forced to tread water for 
yet another year.

Oleksandr Usyk will become the next cult star

With his pay-per-view debut last year, street art tributes and even an 
appearance in an Apple commercial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWsSxVDJKIk>
, Golovkin is beginning to lose his cult status. Enter 2012 Olympic gold 
medalist, Cossack-dancing, forelock-sporting, one-time ice cream vendor 
Oleksandr Usyk. He’s big, he’s bad and he has asense of humour 
<http://bulbanews.ru/en/main/usyk-eng> (as well as a mandatory shot at the belt 
held by No1 cruiserweight contender Krzysztof Glowacki).

OK, you don’t exactly need a crystal ball for this one. One-time heavyweight 
hope Ibeabuchi is 43 and hasn’t had a fight in 17 years. The idea that he could 
pick up where he left off in the late 1990s is fanciful, but, like Agent Fox 
Mulder, it seems a lot of people want to believe. He looks likely to appear on 
theManny Pacquiao v Timothy Bradley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/31/manny-pacquiao-april-fight-timothy-bradley>
 undercard in April, pending commission approval, so we’ll find out then.

Nothing will happen at light heavweight

I know, I know. Andre Ward has signed a deal to meet Sergey Kovalev later in 
the year. I just can’t bring myself to believe it will be that easy. Something 
will go wrong, whether it’s business-related, injury-related or some other kind 
of entirely new snafu.

Adrien Broner will do something dumb

Yeah I know. Call me Nostradamus.

All signs point to the little dudes finally making it happen (again) in 2016. 
“Chocolatito” is fighting Giovanni Segura in March (a bit of a “meh” fight) but 
he’s talking the talk about the rematch after previously demanding more money. 
It might not move the needle much for casuals, but hardcore fans will go wild. 
In terms of technique, offence and skills, it just doesn’t get any better.

With Manny Pacquiao set to retire after fighting Timothy Bradley in April 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/31/manny-pacquiao-april-fight-timothy-bradley>
 and Floyd Mayweather already out to pasture (at least officially), you could 
be forgiven for thinking that boxing is on the cusp of a new era. Not quite. 
There will be much speculation about a September return for Mayweather and a 
rematch with Pacquiao is even a possibility. Let me put it this way: if both 
men stay retired, I will walk across theSydney Harbour Bridge naked
