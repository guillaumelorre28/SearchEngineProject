, Eubank Jr responded: “I’ve tried reaching out since you woke. Haven’t heard 
anything back from you or your team. I hope there’s no hard feelings.”

Within minutes Blackwell replied: “No hard feelings, we were both there doing 
a job and it was unfortunate for what happened but I hope your OK champ.”

And he then confirmed he would not step back into the ring, when asked by 
another account what was next.
