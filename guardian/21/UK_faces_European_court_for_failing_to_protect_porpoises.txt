The UK will be hauled before the European court of justice for failing to 
provide safe habitats for harbour porpoises, theEuropean commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission> said on Thursday.

Harbour porpoises resemble bottlenose dolphins, with small rounded heads, flat 
foreheads and a black-lipped mouth that curves upwards, as if smiling.

The mammals are endemic to the North Atlantic, but their numbers have been 
falling in the Baltic, Mediterranean and the east of the English Channel.

Mortalities from fishing net accidents in areas such as the Celtic Sea, west 
of Cornwall, havecast doubt on the species’ sustainability 
<http://seawatchfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Harbour_Porpoise.pdf>
, and the commission has awarded them an “unfavourable” conservation status.

Under EU law, the UK should have drawn up a list of conservation areas for the 
porpoises, but has so far formally proposed just one small site in the Skerries 
and Causeway conservation area, in Northern Ireland.

A second “special area of conservation” was created 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-37466649> in the Inner 
Hebrides and Minches last weekendafter warnings 
<http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-35362640> from 
conservationists that Scotland was lagging in conservation efforts.

Lyndsey Dodds, WWF’s head of marine policy, said: “The UK has so far failed to 
designate enough protected areas for these charismatic, intelligent and highly 
social marine mammals, despite the requirement to do so under the EU habitats 
directive.

“We welcome the recent proposal to designate the Hebrides and Minches 
protected area but more needs to be done to ensure there is a coherent network 
of sites and to ensure they are properly managed.”





The commission noted the move in the Hebrides and Minches, but said: “The 
[UK’s] continued failure to propose and designate sufficient sites leaves the 
areas where the species occurs in greatest densities without the protection 
required.”

 Potential damage to porpoises from offshore windfarm construction, oil and 
gas exploration and fishing, has not been adequately assessed, the commission 
judged.

At loud levels, underwater noise can injure or even kill porpoises, but it is 
more likely to lead them to abandon an area.

 A WWF report on Friday will say that an eight decibel reduction in noise from 
offshore windfarms – by means such as “bubble curtains” – could cut the chance 
of porpoise population declines by 96% .

 Earlier this year, the government designated 23 new areas 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/blue-belt-extended-to-protect-8000-square-miles-of-uk-waters>
 as marine conservation zones, in an extension of a claimed “blue belt” across 
one-fifth of the UK’s waters.

A UK government spokesperson said: “We are committed to protecting our marine 
environment, which includes appropriate protection for harbour porpoise.That is 
why we already have two Special Areas ofConservation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation> for this important 
species, and earlier this year consulted on another five possible sites.”

 The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) argues that it 
is difficult to identify suitable habitats for the porpoises, but this is 
disputed by conservationists.

Melissa Moore, the policy chief at the Marine Conservation Society said: 
“There are large areas where you have harbour porpoises feeding and breeding in 
which protected sites need to be established. The UK has consulted and should 
be in the process of designating them.”
