Augsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> confirmed on their 
official website: “Augsburg and Chelsea have agreed on an immediate transfer of 
left-back Baba Rahman. Both clubs have agreed not to disclose the fee.”

The German club’s general manager, Stefan Reuter, said: “Baba Rahman has 
developed tremendously in his year with us and made a great leap. It’s not just 
reward for his achievements but also for our work, if international giants like
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are interested in 
signing him.”

Rahman played 31 games for Augsburg last season after joining from the German 
second division side Greuther Furth.

He said: “I thank all those responsible, the coaches and fans of Augsburg, for 
their support last year. I have to take this chance to play at a top club in 
England, although I was actually set on a long-term stay in Augsburg a year 
ago. I felt very comfortable in the team.”
