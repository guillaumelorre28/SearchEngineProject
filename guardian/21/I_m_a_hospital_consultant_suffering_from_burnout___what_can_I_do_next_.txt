Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

I am a hospital consultant in a cancer-related speciality. I am writing 
because I am suffering from complete career burnout and don’t know what to do 
next.

I am in my mid-40s and, to my sadness, I have lost interest in the job that 
has always been stressful but rewarding over the 20 years or so since I left 
medical school. It has been a long hard road starting as a busy junior doctor, 
coping with multiple exams and failures, but eventually making it as a 
consultant 10 years ago.

Even then, the job continued to be exceptionally busy and challenging 
work-wise and emotionally, and I now feel that I missed so many important 
things, particularly a significant part of my boys’ childhood.

I feel listless and tired all the time, and find it difficult to get 
enthusiastic about professional development and milestones.

What other career options do I have apart from medicine that would pay equally 
well? I still have to get three children through school and university.
