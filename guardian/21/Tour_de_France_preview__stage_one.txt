William Fotheringham's preview

An opening road race stage rather than a brief prologue time trial is becoming 
a regular feature in the Tour. This Corsican one has a flat finale with Mark 
Cavendish's name written all over it; the Manxman is well aware of that and has 
had his sights set on the yellow jersey since finishing the Giro d'Italia. 
Before the sprint finish? A hilly opening section where a doomed escape will 
form, and a flatter finale before the plunge down to the chequered flag.
