The 18-year-old, a Spain Under-17 international, will officially join the 
Hammers on a three-year contract on 1 July but is already training with his 
future team-mates.

Martínez, a prolific goalscorer for Valencia’s youth team, will initially link 
up with West Ham’s development squad but hopes to break into the first team and 
run out at the Olympic Stadium next season.

He told the club website: “For me, it’s a great opportunity to be here and I 
hope to make the most of being at such a big club. I joined West Ham because of 
the progress that the club is making. The decision to come here was made 
because it is a brilliant opportunity to join an interesting club in the 
Premier League.

“The prospect of playing in front of 60,000 people next year really catches my 
attention, and it is a stadium that has so much history. I am hoping to be able 
to get the opportunity to do that and I hope that it will be soon.”
