Aritz Aduriz scored a hat-trick to lead Athletic Bilbao's 4-0 rout of 10-man 
Granada on Friday, as the Basque side strengthened their hold on Spain's last 
Champions League berth for next season.

Aduriz headed home Markel Susaeta's cross in the sixth minute to open the 
scoring at San Mamés Stadium. He bettered that with a long-range blast that 
went in off the frame of the goal in the 18th and converted a penalty in the 
72nd after Diego Mainz was sent off for fouling Aduriz with only the goalkeeper 
to beat.

The Bilbao defender Carlos Gurpegi capped the win in the 80th with a volley 
from outside the box. Granada did not muster a shot on goal and would have lost 
by a wider margin had it not been for the performance of Roberto Fernández in 
goal.

Bilbao's first victory in their last three home games left them fourth in La 
Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>, seven points ahead 
of Villarreal and Real Sociedad before they play their matches on Sunday.

Real Madrid lead the table by three points from Atlético Madrid and Barcelona, 
with Bilbao a further 10 points adrift.

"I'm happy the team won again," Aduriz said. "To stay at the top you have to 
keep winning week after week. There is a long way to go and it will be very 
tough, because there are some good teams in the fight but we will give it our 
all to stay in fourth place."

Granada's fifth consecutive defeat away from home leaves them perilously 
placed five points off the relegation zone.
