The Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> forward 
apologised for his actions but after being given a warning by his club over his 
future conduct, Low has now told him not to show up for international duty.

“I made it clear to Max Kruse last week what I expect from him, both on and 
off the field,” said Löw on the German Football Association’s website.

“I want players who focus on football and the European Championship, even 
between matches.

“Last weekend’s incident goes against my expectations. Max has once again 
behaved unprofessionally and I don’t accept that.

“Euro 2016 is on the horizon and we have big goals as a team there. We need 
players who are focused and aware of their status as a role model.”

The Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> squad is due to 
congregate in Berlin on Tuesday with 26 players rather than the originally 
summoned 27 expected.
