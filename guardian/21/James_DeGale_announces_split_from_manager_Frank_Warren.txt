The Olympic gold medallist James DeGale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> is to split from manager Frank 
Warren, it was announced on Friday.

The 24-year-old boxer shot to prominence four years ago by winning 
middleweight gold at the Beijing Games in 2008.

DeGale turned pro later that year and joined Warren's promotional stable along 
with fellow Olympians Billy Joe Saunders and Frankie Gavin.

However, DeGale has now confirmed his split from Warren in a statement 
released by the boxer's solicitors, Blick & Co.

The European super-middleweight champion from Harlesden, London, said in the 
short statement: "I think it is time for both of us to move on."
