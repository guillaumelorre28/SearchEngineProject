seek a way out of their late season woes.

Sosaia Feki could also make his return from injury.

The Sharks have crashed to three successive losses, putting their chances of a 
top-two finish in doubt despite a club record 15 straight wins earlier this 
season.

Cronulla sit in second place, two points ahead of third-placed Canberra, and 
need to win both of their final games against the Roosters and Melbourne to 
confirm a home match in week one of the finals.

Skipper Gallen sat out the Sharks 12-6 loss to South Sydney at ANZ Stadium due 
to a calf injury, which had also forced him to miss the loss to St George 
Illawarra the round before.

Hooker Michael Ennis admitted the Sharks missed Gallen in the loss to Souths.

“That is two big bodies we had out with him and Sam Tagataese (both not 
playing),” he told AAP.

“We could have used them against that big Souths pack.

“I believe he will be back. I hope so.”

Feki missed the round 24 match with the Rabbitohs due to a groin injury picked 
up the week before in the loss to St George Illawarra.

Prop Tagataese might not play against until the finals due to a shoulder 
injury.

Cronulla will also be boosted by the Roosters’ poor recent record at Shark 
Park. The Tricolours have won one of their past six matches in the Shire.

Sharks coach Shane Flanagan was attempting to stay positive.

“It’s not going to be easy. We know that,” he said.

“We’re trying really hard, we’re trying our butts off and things just aren’t 
working at the moment.

“It’s not hard for me to be positive about it. That’s my job to make sure we 
work hard and we’re in good shape when we get to the semi-finals.”
