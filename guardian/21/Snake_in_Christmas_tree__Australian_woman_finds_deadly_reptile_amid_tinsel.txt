It’s no partridge in a pear tree but a Melbourne woman got a seasonal surprise 
when she found a tiger snake entwined among the tinsel on herChristmas

The Frankston woman discovered the snake in her tree on Sunday morning and 
called in professional snake catcher Barry Goldsmith.

“It’s one of the more different ones, but we find them in all sorts of 
places,” Goldsmith said. “Tiger snakes are very good climbers.”

Goldsmith, who runs Snake Catcher Victoria, said the woman did the right thing 
by taking a photo of the snake then closing off the room until a professional 
arrived.

With the warmer weather, snakes are more active, but people should leave them 
alone and not try to kill them, Goldsmith said. “It’s dangerous, it’s illegal, 
and it’s cruel.”
