Marco Silva takes charge of his first Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> match hoping for a miracle 
with his team bottom. Abel Hernández, last season’s top scorer, who has missed 
half of Hull’s league matches, is fit and the new arrival Oumar Niasse could 
also feature. Bournemouth will also have fresh legs, having rested their entire 
team for the embarrassing FA Cup defeat against Millwall. Simon Francis is 
suspended but Ryan Fraser has recovered from a calf injury.Paul MacInnes
