Grigg, who did not play a single minute for his country at Euro 2016 became 
one of the names of the tournament after the 1996 song Freed From Desirewas 
adapted in his honour

. Will Grigg’s On Fire reached No6 in the iTunes chart.

However, that and the 24-year-old’s 25 goals for Wigan in League One were not 
quite enough for him to be included on the 10-man shortlist for the prize, 
which is voted for by journalists from each of Uefa’s 55 member associations.

Gareth Bale is one of four players from the European champions Real Madrid to 
make the cut, along withCristiano Ronaldo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ronaldo>, Pepe and Toni Kroos. The Italy 
goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, Antoine Griezmann of Atlético Madrid and France, 
Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez are joined by Thomas Müller and Manuel 
Neuer of Bayern Munich on the list, which features no players from the Premier 
League.

The Leicester duo Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy just missed out, with West 
Ham’s Dimitri Payet in 13th position.

The list will be whittled down to three players at the start of August, with 
Uefa’s jury to decide on the eventual winner during the Champions League group 
stage draw in Monaco on 25 August.

Last year’s winner Messi will be hoping to collect his third award after 
claiming the inaugural prize in 2011.
