The US dictionary Merriam-Webster <http://www.merriam-webster.com/> has 
implored word-lovers to help prevent “fascism” becoming its word of the year.

The Twitter feed for the dictionary, which picks its word of the year 
according to popularity in online search, announced: “There’s still time to 
look something else up.”

'Fascism' is still our #1 lookup.

# of lookups = how we choose our Word of the Year. 

There's still time to look something else up.

People responded by suggesting other, more cheering, terms to look up:

<https://twitter.com/samanthavicent> I've searched "puppies" 523 times in the 
past 30 minutes. Anything change?

Meanwhile, one tweeter spoke for many when she wrote: “I wish people had 
looked it [fascism] up a month ago”. (The dayafter the EU referendum vote in 
the UK, the search term “what is the EU?” brieflyspiked on Google search

Merriam-Webster suggested 
<https://twitter.com/MerriamWebster/status/803697843395579905> that people 
might wish to look up “flummadiddle” en masse to push fascism from the number 
one spot. According to the Merriam-Webster website, Flummadiddle means 
“nonsense” or “trash”. There was no word on whether this was a more oblique 
response to the US president-elect’s policies.

Global politics has influenced other dictionaries’ words of the year. Oxford 
Dictionaries’ choice, which was “post-truth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/15/post-truth-named-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-dictionaries>
”, is defined as: “Relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective 
facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion 
and personal belief”.

Dictionary.com’s word of the year 
<http://time.com/4583809/xenophobia-word-of-the-year-2016/> – just as 
depressing a result as fascism would be – was “xenophobia”.


Cambridge Dictionary went for “paranoid”. Collins plumped for Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/03/brexit-named-word-of-the-year-ahead-of-trumpism-and-hygge>
.

Other shortlisted terms from various dictionaries included 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/collins-dictionarys-10-word-of-the-year-from-brexit-and-snowflake-generation-to-jomo-a7395121.html>
 “alt-right”, “Trumpism” and “snowflake generation”. It all seems a world away 
from Oxford Dictionaries’word of the year for 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/17/oxford-dictionary-emoji-word-of-the-year-crying-face>
 which was actually an emoji: tears of joy.
