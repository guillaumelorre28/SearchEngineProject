Full-time: Burton Albion 0-5 Liverpool

It was as straightforward as it looks, to be honest. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> go through thanks to goals 
from Origi, Firmino, a Naylor own goal and two from Sturridge. They were never 
in any form of trouble, and it was all very flat really. Mane was excellent 
though, in particular, and all of Klopp’s players can regard that as a job well 
done.

90+2 min: Mignolet flaps at a corner and Matip has to head away from near the 
goal-line. Along with that effort from Akins, it’s as near to an alarm as
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have had.

88 min: Big positives for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>? If we want one that really 
might mean something, it’s the form of Mane. He’s been brilliant tonight and, 
while perhaps not up against much, has certainly started his career with the 
club well. A negative? Origi is not coming back on. Hmmm.

Goal! Burton 0-5 Liverpool (Sturridge 83)

Well tough luck, as it’s 5-0. Mane, who has been electric all night, surges 
into the box from a standing start on the right and feeds Sturridge, who takes 
one touch to set himself and then, from 15 yards, cracks one low into the 
corner. A beautifully conceived, and finished, strike.

Goal! Burton 0-4 Liverpool (Sturridge 78)

Burton can’t clear a set-piece properly, Milner picks the ball up and plays a 
give-and-go with Mane down the right. He whizzes a cross-shot past Bywater and 
Sturridge is on hand to tap home at the back stick. You can’t say this isn’t a 
fair reflection of the game.

77 min: A Burton free-kick is hooked back very well from the byline by Naylor 
and Stewart is sharp to get the ball away for a corner. Burton fans appeal 
half-heartedly for a penalty after Mane collides with Harness, but nothing 
doing.

64 min: Akins has Burton’s best effort of the night, latching onto a long 
pass, powering beyond Milner and blazing over from an angle. Then Lallana goes 
off, and Wijnaldum comes on.

Goal! Burton 0-3 Liverpool (Naylor o.g. 61)

The corner is swirled in superbly by Milner, a really wicked delivery, and it 
flicks off a body and cannons off Naylor. With Bywater in no man’s land, it 
flies into the empty net. If you had any remote doubts about this game’s 
outcome then you weren’t paying attention, but please do dispel them now.

Lallana, who then wins a corner.

60 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are going 
through the motions now, if you couldn’t tell. Getting to the stage where 
everyone just wants to play this one out. Klopp will probably want the 
intensity to ramp up for rather longer, although perhaps a change or two would 
help that.

54 min: Celtic have just conceded an absolute laugh of a goal in Israel, so

as we are watching this one.

47 min: It’s worth noting that Burton have a big, big league game against 
Derby here on Friday night. The “Nigel Clough derby”, if you will. Kind

the status quo remains.

Any hope for Burton here, anyway? It’d be good to see them come out flying and 
give it a shot early on. It’s coming up in a minute or two...

Half-time: Burton 0-2 Liverpool

Origi, Firmino, and as straightforward as you like really. I’ll be back in a 
bit. Go and find that Dundalk goal.

45 min: Mane gets away again now from a longer ball, and goes down under 
McFadzean’s challenge. Penalty? Red card? Neither, and the defender is lucky 
there – he’s tried to get a foot on the ball and kicked Mane on the achilles.

44 min: Williamson gives the ball away and, from the counter, Mane seems to be 
put clear on goal. But his first touch doesn’t bring the ball under his spell, 
and he is crowded away.

42 min: A bit of pressure from Burton as Akins gets towards the line, his 
cross is cleared and Firmino fouls McFadzean in a dangerous position. 
Williamson’s delivery is looped high and wide by that man McFadzean.

39 min: Mignolet gets to spread himself about, falling onto an Irvine flick 
before anyone else can get there. At the other end, Henderson dabs a foot at an 
Origi cross but can’t really get near it.

33 min: Burton getting some ball now, but it’s all inside their own half. 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> don’t look like 
giving much away and the home team probably need to get in at half-time without 
further damage, regroup and decide just how much to go for this.

30 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are pop,

But doesn’t this first half-hour vindicate Klopp’s decision to go strong?

score. The atmosphere is not exactly white hot here and unless Burton find 
something before half-time this will start to resemble a friendly.

Goal! Burton 0-2 Liverpool (Firmino 22)

Oh no. Bywater tries to throw the ball out to Dyer but he needed to chuck it a 
fair distance and it only reaches Mane. He quickly finds the overlapping Clyne 
down the right, and the full-back’s cross for Firmino – who again can barely 
miss – is pinpoint. A header, a bulging net, 2-0.

Thanks for your company, anyway! And for your emails and other chatter. We’ll 
talk again soon – for now, enjoy the rest of your evening/afternoon/morning. 
Bye!
 
It was as straightforward as it looks, to be honest. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> go through thanks to goals 
from Origi, Firmino, a Naylor own goal and two from Sturridge. They were never 
in any form of trouble, and it was all very flat really. Mane was excellent 
though, in particular, and all of Klopp’s players can regard that as a job well 
done.
 
90+2 min: Mignolet flaps at a corner and Matip has to head away from near the 
goal-line. Along with that effort from Akins, it’s as near to an alarm as
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have had.
 
90 min: “You’ll never walk alone” rings out from the visitors among a crowd 
that has just been given as 6,450. That’s 462 short of a full house, according 
to the official capacity. For a bit more housekeeping, know that we have three 
added minutes to go.
 
88 min: Big positives for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>? If we want one that really 
might mean something, it’s the form of Mane. He’s been brilliant tonight and, 
while perhaps not up against much, has certainly started his career with the 
club well. A negative? Origi is not coming back on. Hmmm.

87 min: Origi is struggling now and the physio is on. All three Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> subs have been used. Could be 
cramp, hopefully.
 
Well tough luck, as it’s 5-0. Mane, who has been electric all night, surges 
into the box from a standing start on the right and feeds Sturridge, who takes 
one touch to set himself and then, from 15 yards, cracks one low into the 
corner. A beautifully conceived, and finished, strike.

82 min: You’re not missing a huge amount. Everyone will take 4-0 now. Me 
included.
 
Burton can’t clear a set-piece properly, Milner picks the ball up and plays a 
give-and-go with Mane down the right. He whizzes a cross-shot past Bywater and 
Sturridge is on hand to tap home at the back stick. You can’t say this isn’t a 
fair reflection of the game.
 
77 min: A Burton free-kick is hooked back very well from the byline by Naylor 
and Stewart is sharp to get the ball away for a corner. Burton fans appeal 
half-heartedly for a penalty after Mane collides with Harness, but nothing 
doing.
 
74 min: I’m labouring the point, I know, but this game has had no intensity 
whatsoever since the first goal.
 
72 min: Daniel Sturridge, who I should have said came on for Firmino a few 
minutes back, has a 20-yarder parried by Bywater. Can, still in pain, is 
replaced by Kevin Stewart, a former loanee at Burton.

69 min: Can is receiving some treatment; Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> won’t want any collateral 
damage from tonight but he seems to have rocked his knee and is hobbling to the 
sideline.
 
66 min: Local lad Ben Fox now replaces the willing but very quiet Dyer. Akins 
has gone off too, replaced by Marcus Harness.
 
64 min: Akins has Burton’s best effort of the night, latching onto a long 
pass, powering beyond Milner and blazing over from an angle. Then Lallana goes 
off, and Wijnaldum comes on.
 
The corner is swirled in superbly by Milner, a really wicked delivery, and it 
flicks off a body and cannons off Naylor. With Bywater in no man’s land, it 
flies into the empty net. If you had any remote doubts about this game’s 
outcome then you weren’t paying attention, but please do dispel them now.

61 min: Now Williamson is booked. That was definitely for a tug, this one on 
Lallana, who then wins a corner.
 
60 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are going 
through the motions now, if you couldn’t tell. Getting to the stage where 
everyone just wants to play this one out. Klopp will probably want the 
intensity to ramp up for rather longer, although perhaps a change or two would 
help that.
 
57 min: Choudhury is booked for ... errr ... something. Tugging a shirt I 
think.
 
56 min: Another Burton corner after Lovren and Lallana cross wires in their 
own box.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have 
switched off slightly. This one comes in from the left and Mignolet is out to 
punch acrobatically away. Good work from him.

54 min: Celtic have just conceded an absolute laugh of a goal in Israel, so 
make sure you find that one later too. 5-4 on aggregate now. But concentrate, 
as we are watching this one.
 
52 min: Palmer outswings it from the right but Lovren atones with a thumping 
header clear. The ball is put back in, spins around for a while and Burton get 
another corner. It’s headed away by Matip this time.
 
50 min: Under pressure from Akins, Lovren skews out an attempted backpass for 
a corner...
 
49 min: A slow start to the half. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> won’t mind. You can hear the 
players shouting to one another, you can’t hear a lot else.
 
47 min: It’s worth noting that Burton have a big, big league game against 
Derby here on Friday night. The “Nigel Clough derby”, if you will. Kind 
scheduling, there. So they might judge that it’s not worth going too hard if 
the status quo remains.
 
Let’s go!
 
A half-time change for Burton: Matty Palmer replaces Jackson Irvine in 
midfield.
 
Any hope for Burton here, anyway? It’d be good to see them come out flying and 
give it a shot early on. It’s coming up in a minute or two...
 
Rather than me going off on how fun all the other games look, let Simon 
Burnton take you through them here:

Origi, Firmino, and as straightforward as you like really. I’ll be back in a 
bit. Go and find that Dundalk goal.
 
45 min: Mane gets away again now from a longer ball, and goes down under 
McFadzean’s challenge. Penalty? Red card? Neither, and the defender is lucky 
there – he’s tried to get a foot on the ball and kicked Mane on the achilles.
 
44 min: Williamson gives the ball away and, from the counter, Mane seems to be 
put clear on goal. But his first touch doesn’t bring the ball under his spell, 
and he is crowded away.
 
42 min: A bit of pressure from Burton as Akins gets towards the line, his 
cross is cleared and Firmino fouls McFadzean in a dangerous position. 
Williamson’s delivery is looped high and wide by that man McFadzean.
 
40 min: The tempo has certainly dropped now. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> probably wouldn’t say no to 
another goal or two but they don’t need to do anything daft. It all feels 
fairly relaxed.

39 min: Mignolet gets to spread himself about, falling onto an Irvine flick 
before anyone else can get there. At the other end, Henderson dabs a foot at an 
Origi cross but can’t really get near it.
 
37 min: Firmino arrives onto yet another right-sided delivery but this time – 
and not before time – Akins is alertly positioned to prevent a clean contact.
 
35 min: Tell you what, Dundalk’s goal was an absolute belter. Try and catch 
it. Ahem. We are still here and Burton have a throw-in deep inLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> territory. It’s something.
 
33 min: Burton getting some ball now, but it’s all inside their own half. 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> don’t look like 
giving much away and the home team probably need to get in at half-time without 
further damage, regroup and decide just how much to go for this.
 
31 min: Firmino stretches out a leg in hope more than expectation as Mane puts 
in a high, long cross and plops the ball only a foot or two wide.
 
30 min: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are pop, 
pop, popping the ball about and this might be a long night for everyone now. 
But doesn’t this first half-hour vindicate Klopp’s decision to go strong?
 
29 min: Bywater is now 35, wow. I make Burton his 15th club. His previous one 
was Kerala Blasters.
 
27 min: Origi spins on the edge of the box and has another go, but Bywater 
fields his daisycutter.
 
26 min: The Champions League play-offs look interesting. Dundalk and Hapoel 
Beer Sheva have both reduced their deficits. But stay here! Anything could 
happen!
 
24 min: I doubt it’ll carry on in this vein, but if it does it could be any 
score. The atmosphere is not exactly white hot here and unless Burton find 
something before half-time this will start to resemble a friendly.
 
Oh no. Bywater tries to throw the ball out to Dyer but he needed to chuck it a 
fair distance and it only reaches Mane. He quickly finds the overlapping Clyne 
down the right, and the full-back’s cross for Firmino – who again can barely 
miss – is pinpoint. A header, a bulging net, 2-0.

to Burton’s one so far.
