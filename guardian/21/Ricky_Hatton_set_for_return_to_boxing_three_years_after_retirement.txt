Ricky Hatton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rickyhatton> is set to bring 
an end to his three-year retirement by announcing his return to the ring at a 
press conference in Manchester on Friday.

Hatton, who turns 34 in October, issued a press release promising a "major 
announcement" â€“ believed to be details of his first fight since a brutal 
second-round knockout by Manny Pacquiao in May 2009.

Hatton has shed almost three stones in training this year, sparking rumours of 
an imminent comeback, which is expected to take place at the MEN Arena in 
Manchester on 24 November.

Since losing to Pacquiao, Hatton has established his own promotions company 
but ran into problems in May when he lost his television deal with Sky.
