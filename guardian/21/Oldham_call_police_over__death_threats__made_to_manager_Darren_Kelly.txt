Oldham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/oldham> have called in police 
amid reports a death threat was sent to their new manager, Darren Kelly.

The League One club appointed Kelly last week but the 35-year-old from 
Northern Ireland has since had to deny claims that he is a supporter of the IRA.

A club statement on Monday afternoon read: “Oldham Athletic AFC are aware of 
threats made against individuals connected with the club.

“These matters have been passed to the police and the club will be making no 
further comments on this subject.”

Some fans have threatened to boycott Oldham’s matches following the decision 
to employ Kelly.

The Latics caused controversy in December when they were in talks to sign 
convicted rapist Ched Evans, before pulling out of the deal after a number of 
sponsors threatened to withdraw their backing.
