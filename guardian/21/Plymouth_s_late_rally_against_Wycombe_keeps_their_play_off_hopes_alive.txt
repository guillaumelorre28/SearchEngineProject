Wycombe bolstered their reputation as English football’s away-day kings with a 
3-2 victory in the first leg of theirLeague Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> play-off semi-final at 
Home Park. But it should have been far better for Wycombe as Plymouth scored 
twice inside the last four minutes to keep alive their hopes of a Wembley final 
appearance.

Gareth Ainsworth’s side won 13 times on the road in the regular league season 
and picked up more points than any of the other 91 sides in the top four 
divisions away from home.

One of those wins came at Plymouth in September and Paul Hayes, scorer in a 
1-0 success that night, putWycombe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> on the way to victory again with 
his 14th goal of the season after 10 minutes.

Aaron Holloway grabbed a controversial second after 22 minutes with Steven 
Craig adding another seven minutes after the restart and Thursday night’s 
second leg at Adams Park looked little more than a formality.

But Plymouth scored twice in a dramatic finale as substitutes Zak Ansah and 
Jason Banton left Wycombe with work still to do if they are to meet Southend or 
Stevenage at Wembley.

“There are 90 minutes left and we have to win. We are a goal down in a cup 
tie. It will be a great occasion and we have to go there and maximise it,” said 
Argyle manager John Sheridan.
