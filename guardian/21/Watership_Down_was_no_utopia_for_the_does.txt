Trevor Masters (Reasons to be cheerful about the world in 2016 <http:>, 
Letters, 31 December) thanks the Guardian for being here to help us retain our 
sanity in the coming year, and cites examples of content to back up the claim. 
I would like to add the Letters page, for the breadth of expertise, acumen, 
humanity, culture, wisdom and laugh-out-loud wit that reflects your readership. 
Thank us all in the fight ahead.

• The rabbits of Watership Down do indeed send a warning (Loose canon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/29/watership-down-richard-adams>
, 30 December), namely that when the bucks seek sex, they abduct some nearby 
does and rape them. Once more it seems that the male utopia is the female’s 
dystopia. I suggest Giles Fraser read Nadia Khomami’s report “British woman’s 
tale of captivity ‘shows reality of UK slavery’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/29/story-of-woman-held-captive-in-uk-shows-how-real-slavery-is>
” in the same issue.
