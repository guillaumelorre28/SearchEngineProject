They already have a strong relationship and Joshua, a regular at Great Britain 
training camps, flew to Rio in the summer to support the Olympic boxing squad.

“I have remained close to Rob and the GB Boxing squad since 2012,” Joshua said 
on Thursday. “I have consistently turned to him for advice and guidance so I am 
really excited to have him in my corner.

“I would like to put on record my thanks to Tony Sims, who will remain in my 
corner working with Rob, as he did to such [effect] with Carl Froch.”

McCracken said: “Anthony is a special talent and I am looking forward to 
working with him on the next stage of his career as he looks to defend his 
titles and, ultimately, to unify the heavyweight division.

“I know from working with Carl that combining my work coaching a top 
professional boxer with the role of GB performance director has mutual benefits 
and that having a world champion in the gym has a very positive impact on the 
whole of the squad.

“It gives the boxers an insight into what it takes to be the best in the world 
and provides top-class training opportunities that will help to develop and 
improve the heavyweight and super-heavyweight boxers in the squad.”
