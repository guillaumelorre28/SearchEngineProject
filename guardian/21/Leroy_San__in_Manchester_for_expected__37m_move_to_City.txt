Leroy Sané has arrived at Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> to complete his move from 
Schalke. The fee is expected to be £37m, rising to just over £40m with add-ons.

Pep Guardiola confirmed last month that City were in talks with the forward  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/21/pep-guardiola-loss-bayern-munich-first-game-manchester-city>
but said the transfer was being held up over the player’s valuation. At the 
same time Schalke’s sporting director, Christian Heidel, said Sané, who scored 
eight goals last season as the Bundesliga club finished fifth in the league, 
had asked for a transfer.

On Monday Schalke tweeted: “Leroy Sané is currently in Manchester and will not 
be travelling withSchalke <https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke> to the 
training camp.”

The 20-year-old, who has been on City’s radar since 2013, made his debut for 
Germany against France last year and was in the squad for Euro 2016 though he 
played only 11 minutes,against France in the semi-final 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/07/germany-france-euro-2016-match-report>
, which his side lost 2-0.

He could make his debut against Arsenal in a friendly in Gothenburg on Sunday.

Schalke are closing in on completing the season-long loan signing of the 
Chelsea defender Baba Rahman. The Ghana full-back met up with the squad for 
pre-season training, before completing the formalities on his loan switch from 
Stamford Bridge.

They retain an interest in John Stones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/29/manchester-city-everton-valuation-john-stones>
 but are reluctant to meet Everton’s £50m valuation for the 22-year-old 
defender, setting their target figure at around £40m plus add-ons.
