The Guardian’s chess columnist, Leonard Barden, has recently broken another 
record,according to a report on Chess Base 
<http://en.chessbase.com/post/leonard-barden-still-going-strong-at-87>.

It points out that Barden’s 61-year stint as the paper’s columnist - 
uninterrupted since September 1955 - has overtaken the 60 years and six months 
record set by Tom Widdows, who wrote weekly for the Worcester News from October 
1945 until April 2006.

Barden, 87, had already secured the record as the longest continuous daily 
chess columnist. He wrote his first London Evening Standard column in June 
1956, which remained in print until July 2010 (54 years, 1 month) and has run 
ever sinceon the paper’s website 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/staticpage/chess/chess-with-leonard-barden-a1939236.html>
.

In so doing, he overtook the one written by George Koltanowski for the San 
Francisco Daily Chronicle, which lasted 51 years 9 months, until his death.

Chess <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chess> Base’s Frederic Friedel 
believes Barden’s Standard column may well be the longest running daily column 
by a single journalist in any field of journalism. Challenges to this claim 
are, of course, welcome.

Of Barden’s weekly Guardian chess column 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/leonard-barden-chess>, Friedel writes:

“Leonard’s observations on the contemporary chess scene are well written and 
meticulously researched, and each column contains a game and, very enticingly, 
an entertaining and instructive chess puzzle Visit the Guardian chess page on 
Friday – you will never regret it”.

At the risk of irritating everyone with an outrageous pun (but I can’t help 
it), Barden’s columns never go stale, mate. Sorry.
