The government plans to reintroduce controversial laws to limit the legal 
standing of conservation groups mounting court cases if it thinks the new 
Senate will support them, Malcolm Turnbull has revealed.

At a press conference in Sydney on Monday Turnbull expressed concern that 
“systematic, well-funded” environmental campaigns were targeting major projects 
and flagged a renewed attempt to pass the law.

In August 2015 the Abbott government announced

 it would remove the right of most environmental organisations to challenge 
developments under federal laws unless they could show they were “directly 
affected”.

The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act allows any Australian citizen 
or resident who has engaged in conservation activities in the previous two 
years to bring a legal challenge to government environmental decisions.

The proposed changes followed a federal court decision 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/05/approval-for-adanis-carmichael-coalmine-overturned-by-federal-court>
 that the then environment minister, Greg Hunt, had not properly considered all 
advice in his approval of Adani’s $16.6bn Carmichael coalmine.

After becoming prime minister Turnbull unexpectedly retained plans to 
introduce the laws

 limiting legal standing.

On Monday Turnbull said: “We have a robust democracy and people are entitled 
to bring their cases before the courts.

“But there is no doubt there has been very systematic, very well-funded 
campaigns against major projects so it’s right to express concern about that.

“We did present some legislation in the last parliament but it was 
unsuccessful and we’ll obviously reassess the tenor of the new Senate to see 
whether it would have the appetite for supporting it in the new environment.”

The Greens environment spokeswoman, Senator Larissa Waters, said: “Stopping 
ordinary Australians from enforcing our environment laws would be a 
capitulation to the hard right inside the Coalition and yet another win for 
Tony Abbott.”

She added: “Gutting public enforcement of environmental laws is an attack on 
democracy and the rule of law.

“When governments fail to enforce or comply with their own laws, it falls to 
community groups to hold them to account.”

Waters said there were already strict rules that limit which cases go to court 
and frivolous or vexatious claims could be struck out.

On Tuesday a United Nations special rapporteur, Michel Forst, criticised the 
proposed law 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/australia-should-urgently-improve-whistleblower-protection-un-expert-says>
 after a two-week visit to Australia investigating protections for human rights 
defenders, including environmentalists.

Forst noted the push to limit access to courts by environmental organisations 
seeking to enforce the law and said it was “fortunate” it had been blocked.

He said government officials had used “vitriolic language” to “unjustifiably” 
paint environmental organisations as “radical activists” engaged in “vigilante 
litigation”.

The former prime minister Tony Abbott accused environmental groups of engaging 
in “sabotage” of investment and jobs and the government dubbed the use of the 
courts to challenge mining projects as “lawfare”.

Forst said there were already significant obstacles to environmental 
litigation including complexity and the risk of a costs order if a case was 
unsuccessful.

An Australian Conservation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation> Foundation campaigner, 
Basha Stasak, welcomed the UN rapporteur’s findings that environmental 
campaigners had been “vilified” for legitimate legal action.

She called on the government to “take on board the recommendations that 
environmental groups have a legitimate interest in decision making and in the 
courts” and withdraw amendments to deny them standing and deprive them of 
tax-deductible status.
