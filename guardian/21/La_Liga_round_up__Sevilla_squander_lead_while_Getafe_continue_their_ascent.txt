Sevilla squandered a two-goal lead as the home side, Real Valladolid, hit back 
to claim a 2-2 draw with two goals in three minutes, leaving Unai Emery's side 
still searching for their first win on the road since September 2012.

The visitors appeared on course for a regulation victory when they eased into 
a commanding lead inside half an hour with goals from Carlos Bacca and Alberto 
Moreno. But Manucho got one back in the 81st minute before Patrick Ebert struck 
in the 84th as the hosts somehow clawed their way back into a gameSevilla

Getafe profited from the Granada defender Pape Diakhaté's first-half dismissal 
to claim a fourth successive win and move up to fifth place. A Jeison Murillo 
own-goal and Pedro León's third goal of the season shortly after half-time 
sealed a 2-0 win to continue Getafe's flying start.

Ten-man Elche survived a late onslaught from Real Betis to record their third 
win in a row. The visitors scored twice in quick succession in the first half 
through Manu del Moral and Fidel Chaves before Jorge Molina's goal put Pepe 
Mel's side back in contention. Soon after the break Dominga Cisma was sent off 
following a second yellow card but, even with an extra player, Betis could not 
find an equaliser.

A late free-kick from Alejandro Gálvez gave 10-man Rayo Vallecano a 1-0 
success atAlmería. The centre-back struck the Madrid side's winner on 78 
minutes not long after Saúl Níguez had been sent off for two bookings.
