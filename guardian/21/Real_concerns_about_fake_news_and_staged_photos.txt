How can you run news items and comment on false news (A challenge to 
Facebook’s reach and power is overdue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/08/challenge-facebook-reach-power-overdue-mark-zuckerberg>
, 9 December), while the front page of the very same edition bears afalse photo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/08/artist-alison-jackson-self-publishes-spoof-trump-photos-despite-fear-of-being-sued>
 of the US president-elect cavorting with, apparently, Ku Klux Klan members? 
Donald Trump may or not be a supporter of this organisation and they in turn 
may or may not be supporters of his. But the clear message of the photo, 
without any prominent indication that it is false, presents unambiguous 
positive answers to these implied questions.

I fly no flag for Trump, whatever the answers are in truth, but as a signed-up 
supporter of your publication’s objective of “producing quality, independent 
journalism, which discovers and tells readers the truth”, I would have expected 
better of you. Or are we all (subscribers, supporters, casual front page 
headline readers) supposed to know the speciality of Alison Jackson’s work?

• Isn’t the front page prominence given to a photo of Donald Trump apparently 
embracing Klan members an instance of the fake news the pope is warning about? 
I have no time for the man and his methods but I would not stoop to copying his 
tactics. As the pope pungently puts it, that way coprophilia lies (Pope Francis 
compares fake news consumption to eating faeces 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/pope-compares-fake-news-consumption-to-eating-faeces-coprophilia>
, 8 December). The world’s media should not be used as a tool to defame rivals 
with the disinformation that Orwell warned us of.

• So, let me get this post-truth idea straight in my head: if you agree with 
the sentiments behind a faked photo you put it on the front page, where it 
might easily be mistaken for a photo of a genuine event, and you hail it as 
satire. If you don’t agree with the sentiments behind a fake/untrue news story 
(eg the misleading Brexit bus slogan) you condemn the use of it utterly. Hmmmm 
– the word hypocrisy comes to mind I’m afraid.

• I would not wish to dissent from any of John Harris’s observations on 
Facebook’s shortcomings. A former councillor colleague told me: “I useFacebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> and Twitter but I make sure 
that I keep the politics quite separate from them.”

My council had to teach me how to tweet but I do not send instant messages 
from the midst of an event. I want to think carefully about my 140 characters 
before I put a message out there, even if at first glance it seems harmless. 
So most of my tweets go out at the end of the working day.

Meanwhile my charity for the year is Young Minds, focusing on the mental 
health and wellbeing of children and young people. I believe that we are in 
urgent need of research into the ways Facebook experiences can contribute to 
the mental suffering of a significant proportion of 16- to 25-year-olds.

• Fake news may be endangering our democratic systems, but thoughtless 
denigration of politicians who are trying to make those systems work is equally 
reckless. Thus Alan Sillitoe implies that all MPs break all of their promises (
Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/dec/06/zac-goldsmith-some-kind-of-record-breaker>
, 7 December) andJohn Crace’s sketches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/the-politics-sketch> routinely 
depict MPs as stupid, venal and inhuman. These fake opinions may be thought 
witty enough for you to publish, but they pander to a general view of standard 
politics as contemptible. Figures like Farage and Trump reap the short-term 
benefit; more insidiously, the belief grows that democracy itself is worthless.

• Fake news is of very real concern. There have been seven recessions in the 
UK since the second world war. Five have been under Conservative governments. 
That party has also presided over all four separate periods of 
quarter-on-quarter fall in growth during the 2010s. By contrast, there was no 
recession on the day of the 2010 general election.

And now, the Conservatives have more than doubled the national debt. The Major 
government also doubled the national debt. Yet the Conservatives’ undeserved 
reputation for economic competence endures. They are subjected to absolutely no 
scrutiny by the fake news detractors of their opponents.

Other examples of fake news include the official versions of events in 
relation to Orgreave, Westland, and Hillsborough; thealleged murder of 100,000 
military age males in Kosovo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/18/balkans3>; the existence of 
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and their capacity for deployment within 
45 minutes;Saddam Hussein’s feeding of people into a giant paper shredder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/25/iraq.iraqandthemedia>, and 
his attempt to obtain uranium from Niger; an imminent genocide in Benghazi;
Gaddafi’s feeding of Viagra to his soldiers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/29/diplomat-gaddafi-troops-viagra-mass-rape>
 in order to encourage mass rape, and his intention to flee to Venezuela; an 
Iranian nuclear weapons programme. In every case, that was fake news. Or, in 
plain English, lies.
