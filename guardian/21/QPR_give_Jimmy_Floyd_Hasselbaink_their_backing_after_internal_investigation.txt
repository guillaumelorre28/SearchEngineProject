 and Rangers, who said they had not been provided with information requested 
from the newspaper, have backed him.

“Throughout the comprehensive investigation, the club contacted and 
communicated with all the major parties involved, including the Telegraph, who 
failed to provide the club with the information requested,” the clubsaid in a 
statement

.

“Despite a number of requests from the club and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink’s 
legal team for the information relating to the inferences made on September 
28th, including video footage and a full transcript of the discussions that 
took place, nothing has been forthcoming.

“As a result, and in the absence of any further evidence, the board fully back 
QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and his explanations relating to these 
inferences.

“Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink openly admitted he was naive and, as such, has been 
reminded of his roles and responsibilities as manager of Queens Park Rangers. 
He remains fully focused on his job as QPR manager, and he does so with the 
board’s unanimous support.”
