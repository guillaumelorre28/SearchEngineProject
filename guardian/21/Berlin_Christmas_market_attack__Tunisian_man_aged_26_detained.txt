German authorities say they have taken a 26-year-old Tunisian man into custody 
and are investigating whether he played a role in the truck attack that killed 
12 people in Berlin before Christmas.

On Tuesday evening, police searched the room of the man, who had dinner with 
the Tunisian main suspect, Anis Amri, 24, a day before Amri ploughed a truck 
through a Christmas market on 19 December, a spokeswoman for the chief federal 
prosecutor said.

“This contact person is a 26-year-old Tunisian. We are investigating him for 
possible participation in the attack,” she told reporters.

The spokeswoman said there was not sufficient evidence at this point to charge 
the man for any role in the attack.

However, the Berlin state prosecutor’s office said in a separate statement 
that it had detained the 26-year-old man on Tuesday evening for fraud involving 
social benefits.

The chief federal prosecutor’s spokeswoman said authorities were evaluating 
communications devices seized during that raid and the search of an apartment 
belonging to another man who also had contact with Amri.
