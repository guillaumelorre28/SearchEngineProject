‘I want to be doing this for the next 20 or 30 years’

Nicola Griffin, 56, is a model. She lives in Nottingham and is signed to the 
Grey Model Agency <http://www.greymodelagency.com/>.

I can pinpoint exactly when my life turned around. It was four years ago when 
I was in a queue at a bank and a woman tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I 
would be involved in a photo shoot for White Hot Hair, a shampoo company for 
grey hair. I wasn’t sure but I ended up ringing them and little did I know it 
would be a life-changing moment.

I didn’t get paid for it but it was a great afternoon with about 10 other 
women. At the end of the day I thought that was the end of that. Then about six 
months later, the company emailed me asking if I would be the poster girl for 
their big campaign. It was paid. I thought, now you’re talking. I took the day 
off from my job – I worked for a French company organising for students to come 
over on school trips – and went to the studio.

Some models are 85 – I'm one of the young ones

The campaign was everywhere and from then onwards, the work just rolled in. I 
ended up being represented by an agency. Things spiralled when I was featured 
in Sports Illustrator; I was the oldest woman to appear in a swimsuit in it. 
Well, everything went mad. I was on TV shows in the US, then all over the media 
here in the UK. It led to more work. My children think it’s amazing.

It’s been wonderful, it’s so much fun. It’s just a giggle – today I was doing 
a shoot and could barely do it for laughing. It’s not like a job. There are 
downsides, of course – I sometimes have to get up at 4am and catch a flight at 
6am and can be travelling all day, but I’m not going to moan. I want to be 
doing this for the next 20 or 30 years. Some of the models are 85, there are 
people likeDaphne Selfe <http://www.daphneselfe.com/> around. That’s what I 
aspire to. I’m one of the young ones.

‘I’m doing what I should have been doing for years’

Kathy Trevelyan <http://www.kathytrevelyan.com/> is an actress living in 
London. She had a portfolio career before she took the plunge and studied at 
drama school in her 50s.

I always had a desire to be an actor. Instead I had a portfolio career – I was 
a teacher and a tour guide, but every five years or so that deep desire would 
run through me. At 36, I rang up a couple of drama schools to enquire about 
studying and they told me not to bother – I was too old. I ended up becoming an 
extra, which certainly isn’t a way in to acting. You’re just like the 
furniture. But this feeling wouldn’t go away. It was kicked over the edge when 
I went to see Henry VI Parts 1, 2 and 3 all in one day. I came out in tears – I 
just thought I have to do this.

I found a drama course on a Saturday run by a wonderful guy called Simon, and 
he gave me the confidence to believe I could become an actor. With his 
encouragement, I went on to drama school for two years in Wapping. The teachers 
were incredible. We performed in a play at the end of every term and then in 
the second year we did fringe theatre. I loved the adrenaline.

As soon as I finished, I found an agent and the next thing I was touring with 
a children’s theatre group in Spain and Germany and cast as the nurse in Romeo 
and Juliet at a festival play. I’ve also played witches in a documentary for 
Channel 5. I’m about to head to Liverpool to play a woman who has dementia.

I’m so fulfilled now. I’m doing what I should have been doing for years. I 
wish I’d done it a long time ago, but then in your twenties I hear it can be 
soul-destroying as so many women are competing. I was far too vulnerable then. 
I’m not making big bucks but over half my work last year was through acting – 
I’m still a tour guide when I’m not acting. I won’t work for free. I’m going to 
keep going; my dream is to work with the Royal Shakespeare Company.

 ‘My job came out of my hobby’ says John Parnell, AKA The Hoop Guy. Photograph:

John Parnell <http://s555060974.initial-website.co.uk/>, 63, moved into 
children’s entertainment after being made redundant from his job as a senior 
technical instructor. He lives in Nuneaton.

I was in my mid-fifties when I was made redundant from my job, which often 
involved 16-hour days, staying in lots of hotels and delayed flights. It was so 
tiring I’d been thinking that I couldn’t go on doing this much longer anyway, 
but it was 2008 – when the recession hit – and I thought, well what chance have 
I got of getting another job now? I certainly didn’t want to retire. So my next 
job sort of came out of my hobby.

I'm in my late 40s and need a new career – but what?

I’d learnt to juggle at 41 and soon afterwards I started a local juggling 
club. The following year I learnt to ride the unicycle and walk on stilts. At 
53, I learnt how to hula hoop. I’d actually been running adult hula hoop 
classes the year before I lost my job. So when I was made redundant, I became 
self-employed and my hobby became my work.

I began visiting schools teaching kids how to hula hoop. The kids love it and 
it’s good exercise for them. I’m also an entertainer. I’m always booked up over 
the Christmas period; so far I’m booked to dress up as Santa on stilts and an 
elf on stints. I earn a lot less than I used to but I’m paid to have fun. I’m 
63 now. I hope to still be doing this at 73.
