Sampdoria have already expressed their interest in bringing Balotelli back to 
the league where he has represented both Internazionale and Milan, and now 
Bologna’s director of sport, Pantaleo Corvino, has hinted at a loan deal.

“I would take him, he would be highly motivated here,” Corvino told the 
Corriere dello Sport. “Of course,Bologna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bologna> have to respect certain 
financial parameters, but for the right price I would even look at the 
possibility of buying him outright.”

Bologna, who are currently coached by Delio Rossi, have just returned from a 
season in Serie B. They finished fourth in the second division but beat Pescara 
to promotion by winning a two-legged play-off final in June.
