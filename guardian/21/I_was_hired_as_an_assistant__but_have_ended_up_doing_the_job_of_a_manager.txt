Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.


Six months ago I joined a small company as an area assistant. Two months after 
starting, my area manager was made redundant and I ended up with his workload 
as well as my own.

He was asked to leave because our company has been purchased by a 
multinational. The new boss of our company has been working with me for the 
past few months and I’ve been praised for my work many times.

However, my duties are obviously way beyond what I was hired to do and I have 
landed up with an incredible amount of responsibility. I am now doing exactly 
the same job as the “redundant” area manager but am still, on paper, an 
“assistant”.

My co-workers also seem to resent the fact I have a good relationship with the 
boss and I feel this gets in the way of my work. I suppose this is a hangover 
from the takeover, which caused a lot of worry and was unsettling for everyone.

I like my position and the upside is that I get to learn and be challenged 
more than before. However, not surprisingly, I want a pay rise. My boss seems 
reluctant to discuss this. I only mentioned it once, saying I expected a rise 
at some point, but that’s all.

What should I do? I can get another job for double the money (I am not 
exaggerating!) but I enjoy what I do.
