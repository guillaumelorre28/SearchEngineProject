Marseille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> coach Marcelo 
Bielsa has tendered his resignation to club president Vincent Labrune, minutes 
after a 1-0 home defeat by Caen in their first Ligue 1 game of the season.

Bielsa was quoted by the club’s Twitter feed 
<https://twitter.com/OM_Officiel/status/630125451315408897> as announcing: “I 
have just resigned from my job as OM coach … I have completed my work here. I 
put everything into this job.”

On Thursday Bielsa denied he was set to take over as manager of Mexico, who 
sacked coach Miguel Herrera in July after he was accusedof punching a 
commentator

“I haven’t spoken with anyone at the Mexican Federation,” he said. “It is only 
a hypothesis, and I never discuss a hypothesis.”
