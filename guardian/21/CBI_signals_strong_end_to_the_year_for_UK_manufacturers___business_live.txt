US oil rig

American drillers added oil rigs for the seventh week in a row last week.

The Baker Hughes rig survey showed 12 oil rigs and one gas were added, as the 
crude price recovery encouraged further drilling activity. Oil rigs have been 
added in 26 of the past 29 weeks.

<https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/809822391341826048> 
So far the rig news has had little impact on the oil price, with Brent crude 
still up around 1.7% at $54.95 a barrel.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back on Monday.

European markets end higher

Despite US markets coming off their best levels - perhaps following a report 
China seized an underwater US drone in the South China Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/16/china-seizes-us-underwater-drone-south-china-sea?CMP=twt_gu>
 - European shares have ended the week on a fairly positive note. The final 
scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 12.63 points or 0.18% to 7011.64, the first time 
it has closed above 7000 since 25 October 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.33% to 11,404.01 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.29% to 4833.27 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB edged up 0.11% to 19,014.75 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.77% to 9412.8 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 4.22% to 639.64 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 27 points at 
19879 having earlier reached 19,923.

Meanwhile the pound is up 0.46% to $1.2471 but is still trading close to a 
three week low after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and 
thus boosted the US currency.

More on S&P maintaining its Triple A rating on Germany. The agency said:

We think Germany’s highly diversified and competitive economy will continue to 
sustain its current growth momentum, backed by strong domestic demand and 
resilient exports against an increasingly challenging international backdrop.

Germany’s surpluses on its external and fiscal balance sheet will enable the 
country to weather external shocks, while ultralow interest rates and strong 
tax revenue growth continue to benefit its public-sector balance sheet.

We are affirming our ‘AAA’ long-term and ‘A-1+’ short-term sovereign credit 
ratings on Germany.

The stable outlook reflects our view that over the next two years Germany’s 
public finances and strong external balance sheet will continue to withstand 
potential financial and economic shocks.

Markets remain in positive territory, although they are off their best levels. 
But the recent rally could continue next week, analysts believe. Chris 
Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

 The week ends with gains across the board, although the Dow Jones remains 
tantalisingly short of the 20,000 target. Still, a good performance from the 
Russell 2000 this afternoon bodes well for the week ahead. Santa definitely 
arrived early this year, but perhaps we’ll get another rally next week. The 
FTSE seems happy enough to move above 7000, and it is entirely plausible that 
the index will touch new all-time highs before everyone sets off for Christmas. 
It will just require a little sprinkling of festive spirit, and hopefully a 
good performance from miners, which have been a little under pressure since the 
Fed announced its plan to raise rates three times next year.

The coming week is not exactly busy, as might be expected, but one area of 
interest will be the Bank of Japan. The yen has taken a hammering since the 
election, which has done wonders for the Japanese stock market, but we should 
not rule out a statement that gives the currency a breathing space. Everyone 
seems to be long the US dollar, so it wouldn’t take much of a change to spark 
some interesting moves in the week ahead.

Oil is moving higher on hopes that producers will stick to their deal to cut 
output.

Ahead of the latest Baker Hughes survey of US rigs, Brent crude has climbed 
1.7% to $54.94 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate is up 1.57% to $51.70 as 
Russia said all of its oil companies had agreed to reduce output.

Helena Smith

Back with Greece, and ahead of the Merkel-Tsipras meeting, the German finance 
ministry has said an assessment report on Tsipras’ surprise relief package is 
not going to make for rosy reading, reports Helena Smith:

Athens’ lender institutions have assembled a report into whether the Greek 
prime minister’s unilateral measures violate his country’s bailout obligations 
and while preliminary “it is quite critical,” a German finance ministry 
announced today.

The report, requested by Berlin, will be evaluated in full next week. 
Particular focus will be paid to Tsipras’ surprise bonanza for low-income 
pensioners in the form of a pre-Christmas bonus, in effect a 13th payment.

Germany’s hardline stance – at least from it’s uncompromising finance minister 
Wolfgang Schäuble - has triggered mounting speculation that the politician is 
now bent on ousting the leftist leader and replacing him with the head of the 
main opposition centre right New Democracy party, Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

“It is obvious that [he] wants to overturn the government and replace it with 
one that has New Democracy at its core,” said Stelios Kouloglou, a Euro MP 
representing Greece’s governing Syriza party. “After [French president] 
Hollande … and [Italian PM] Renzi he wants to be done with whatever trace of 
the left has remained in Europe.”

Wall Street opens higher

US markets are heading higher as the expectation of stimulus measures from the 
new President continues to provide support.

The three main indices are on track for weekly rises and are all near record 
highs, even as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and hinted at three 
more to come in 2017. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently up 42 points 
at 19,894, is close to breaching the 20,000 barrier for the first time. 
Meanwhile the S&P 500 has opened up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.26% 
higher. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:

The big question on most people’s lips at the moment is whether the Dow can 
manage to nibble away at the 20,000 level that it has been flirting with this 
week. Thus far it has fallen short and the likelihood is that the opportunity 
to do it this week has passed.

Even if we fall short we’ve still seen a decent week for US equities, trading 
as they continue to do at record levels. The big question is how a strong US 
dollar and a strong US equity market can co-exist at a time when all we have 
had at the moment is promises of fiscal action, and higher rates.

Since the 8th November the Dow has rallied 9%, the S&P 00 over 6% and the 
Russell 2000 has gained over 14%; how much of market expectations of what 
President elect Trump can deliver are now priced in?

The typical UK household spends more than £2,000 a month, but in December - in 
the run-up to Christmas - it spends an extra £500, according to the Bank of 
England.

And the biggest increase is not, as you might expect, on alcohol but on books, 
the Bank says.

And over the past three years, the value of online shopping has doubled, and 
now accounts for £1 in every £8 spent.

More on Greece, and some comments from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and 
German chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of their talks.

Tsipras has said he would tell the chancellor about the positive momentum in 
the Greek economy and the “spectacular overachievement of revenue targets.”

European markets are at 11-month highs, partly on the back of a weaker euro 
and expectations for stronger growth in the US next year.

Reuters quotes Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets:

 Stocks are continuing to get a boost from a weaker euro and the notion that 
the United States, the world’s largest economy, will experience an uptick in 
growth once President-elect Donald Trump has started implementing his new 
policies.

Bank of Greece calls for an end to the standoff with creditors
 Parliament building in Athens, Greece 

Greece’s central bank has appealed for an end to the standoff between the 
government and the country’s creditors.

If follows the decision by prime minister Alexis Tsipras to award low income 
pensioners with a pre-Christmas bonus - a move which angered Greece’s 
international lenders.

The Guardian’s Helena Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helenasmith> 
reports from Athens:

Hours after the Greek parliament approved Tsipras’ package of relief measures, 
the country’s central bank has stepped in, urging an end to the dispute and 
appealing for differences to be “worked out at the negotiations table in a 
genuine spirit of co-operation with the institutions and our partners.”

Predicting the economy will expand by 2.5% next year – a jump from just 0.1 % 
this year - the Bank of Greece called for “pragmatism and flexibility” in its 
interim monetary policy report released today.

This emerging positive momentum in the economy needs to be supported and 
consolidated through adherence to the programme targets and an accelerated 
implementation of the reforms and privatisations agreed on.

Specifically, the Bank of Greece expects GDP to grow by a marginal 0.1% in 
2016, before picking up to 2.5 % in 2017 and further to 3% in 2018 and 2019, 
supported by investment, consumption and exports.

But an ongoing review of the debt-stricken country’s creditor-mandated reforms 
would have to be wrapped up quickly, the bank said, so that Greece could take 
the next step towards inclusion in the European Central Bank’s QE bond-buying 
programme.

There is not much time left, in the light of upcoming national elections in a 
number of euro area countries.

Progress, it added, would be easier if lenders also agreed to lower 
expectations of Athens achieving a primary budget surplus of 3.5 % by 2018.

Tsipras is expected to raise this issue – and the decision by the euro zone’s 
bailout agency, or ESM, to put short-term debt relief measures for Athens on 
hold - when he holds talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin this 
evening.

Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics>, says the CBI surveys suggests 
the weaker official manufacturing data for October will prove to be a blip.

[It] suggests that the 1% monthly fall in manufacturing output in October, as 
revealed by the ONS figures earlier this month, was just a temporary blip. 
Accordingly, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced 
over the coming quarters.

Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says 2017 could be a tougher 
year for manufacturers.

Despite the decent December CBI industrial trends survey, there are 
significant potential problems for the manufacturing sector that look likely to 
build up in 2017.

In particular, business confidence is likely to be hampered by mounting 
uncertainty over the Brexit process, constraining investment plans and limiting 
demand for capital goods.

It also looks inevitable that consumers will become markedly less able (due to 
diminishing purchasing power) and likely more reluctant to buy big ticket 
consumer durable items over the coming months.

American drillers added oil rigs for the seventh week in a row last week.

The Baker Hughes rig survey showed 12 oil rigs and one gas were added, as the 
crude price recovery encouraged further drilling activity. Oil rigs have been 
added in 26 of the past 29 weeks.

China seized an underwater US drone in the South China Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/16/china-seizes-us-underwater-drone-south-china-sea?CMP=twt_gu>
 - European shares have ended the week on a fairly positive note. The final 
scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 12.63 points or 0.18% to 7011.64, the first time 
it has closed above 7000 since 25 October 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.33% to 11,404.01 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.29% to 4833.27 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB edged up 0.11% to 19,014.75 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.77% to 9412.8 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 4.22% to 639.64 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 27 points at 
19879 having earlier reached 19,923.

Meanwhile the pound is up 0.46% to $1.2471 but is still trading close to a 
three week low after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and 
thus boosted the US currency.
 
More on S&P maintaining its Triple A rating on Germany. The agency said:

We think Germany’s highly diversified and competitive economy will continue to 
sustain its current growth momentum, backed by strong domestic demand and 
resilient exports against an increasingly challenging international backdrop.

Germany’s surpluses on its external and fiscal balance sheet will enable the 
country to weather external shocks, while ultralow interest rates and strong 
tax revenue growth continue to benefit its public-sector balance sheet.

We are affirming our ‘AAA’ long-term and ‘A-1+’ short-term sovereign credit 
ratings on Germany.

The stable outlook reflects our view that over the next two years Germany’s 
public finances and strong external balance sheet will continue to withstand 
potential financial and economic shocks.

Markets remain in positive territory, although they are off their best levels. 
But the recent rally could continue next week, analysts believe. Chris 
Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

 The week ends with gains across the board, although the Dow Jones remains 
tantalisingly short of the 20,000 target. Still, a good performance from the 
Russell 2000 this afternoon bodes well for the week ahead. Santa definitely 
arrived early this year, but perhaps we’ll get another rally next week. The 
FTSE seems happy enough to move above 7000, and it is entirely plausible that 
the index will touch new all-time highs before everyone sets off for Christmas. 
It will just require a little sprinkling of festive spirit, and hopefully a 
good performance from miners, which have been a little under pressure since the 
Fed announced its plan to raise rates three times next year.

The coming week is not exactly busy, as might be expected, but one area of 
interest will be the Bank of Japan. The yen has taken a hammering since the 
election, which has done wonders for the Japanese stock market, but we should 
not rule out a statement that gives the currency a breathing space. Everyone 
seems to be long the US dollar, so it wouldn’t take much of a change to spark 
some interesting moves in the week ahead.
 
Oil is moving higher on hopes that producers will stick to their deal to cut 
output.

Ahead of the latest Baker Hughes survey of US rigs, Brent crude has climbed 
1.7% to $54.94 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate is up 1.57% to $51.70 as 
Russia said all of its oil companies had agreed to reduce output.
 
Back with Greece, and ahead of the Merkel-Tsipras meeting, the German finance 
ministry has said an assessment report on Tsipras’ surprise relief package is 
not going to make for rosy reading, reports Helena Smith:

Athens’ lender institutions have assembled a report into whether the Greek 
prime minister’s unilateral measures violate his country’s bailout obligations 
and while preliminary “it is quite critical,” a German finance ministry 
announced today.

The report, requested by Berlin, will be evaluated in full next week. 
Particular focus will be paid to Tsipras’ surprise bonanza for low-income 
pensioners in the form of a pre-Christmas bonus, in effect a 13th payment.

Germany’s hardline stance – at least from it’s uncompromising finance minister 
Wolfgang Schäuble - has triggered mounting speculation that the politician is 
now bent on ousting the leftist leader and replacing him with the head of the 
main opposition centre right New Democracy party, Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

“It is obvious that [he] wants to overturn the government and replace it with 
one that has New Democracy at its core,” said Stelios Kouloglou, a Euro MP 
representing Greece’s governing Syriza party. “After [French president] 
Hollande … and [Italian PM] Renzi he wants to be done with whatever trace of 
the left has remained in Europe.”
 
US markets are heading higher as the expectation of stimulus measures from the 
new President continues to provide support.

The three main indices are on track for weekly rises and are all near record 
highs, even as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and hinted at three 
more to come in 2017. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently up 42 points 
at 19,894, is close to breaching the 20,000 barrier for the first time. 
Meanwhile the S&P 500 has opened up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.26% 
higher. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:

The big question on most people’s lips at the moment is whether the Dow can 
manage to nibble away at the 20,000 level that it has been flirting with this 
week. Thus far it has fallen short and the likelihood is that the opportunity 
to do it this week has passed.

Even if we fall short we’ve still seen a decent week for US equities, trading 
as they continue to do at record levels. The big question is how a strong US 
dollar and a strong US equity market can co-exist at a time when all we have 
had at the moment is promises of fiscal action, and higher rates.

Since the 8th November the Dow has rallied 9%, the S&P 00 over 6% and the 
Russell 2000 has gained over 14%; how much of market expectations of what 
President elect Trump can deliver are now priced in?
 
The typical UK household spends more than £2,000 a month, but in December - in 
the run-up to Christmas - it spends an extra £500, according to the Bank of 
England.

And the biggest increase is not, as you might expect, on alcohol but on books, 
the Bank says.

And over the past three years, the value of online shopping has doubled, and 
now accounts for £1 in every £8 spent.

US housing starts fell by more than expected in November, falling from a nine 
year high.

They dropped 18.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09m units, below 
expectations of a figure of 1.23m. October’s number was revised up from 1.32m 
to 1.34m, the highest since July 2007.
 
More on Greece, and some comments from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and 
German chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of their talks.

Tsipras has said he would tell the chancellor about the positive momentum in 
the Greek economy and the “spectacular overachievement of revenue targets.”

European markets are at 11-month highs, partly on the back of a weaker euro 
and expectations for stronger growth in the US next year.

Reuters quotes Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets:

 Stocks are continuing to get a boost from a weaker euro and the notion that 
the United States, the world’s largest economy, will experience an uptick in 
growth once President-elect Donald Trump has started implementing his new 
policies.
 
Europe’s main markets are up across the board:

 * FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,019 
 * Germany’s DAX: +0.6% at 11,437 
 * France’s CAC: +0.6% at 4,850 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 19,064 
 * Spain’s IBEX: +0.4% at 9,377 
 * Europe’s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 360   Parliament building in Athens, Greece 

Greece’s central bank has appealed for an end to the standoff between the 
government and the country’s creditors.

If follows the decision by prime minister Alexis Tsipras to award low income 
pensioners with a pre-Christmas bonus - a move which angered Greece’s 
international lenders.

The Guardian’s Helena Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helenasmith> 
reports from Athens:

Hours after the Greek parliament approved Tsipras’ package of relief measures, 
the country’s central bank has stepped in, urging an end to the dispute and 
appealing for differences to be “worked out at the negotiations table in a 
genuine spirit of co-operation with the institutions and our partners.”

Predicting the economy will expand by 2.5% next year – a jump from just 0.1 % 
this year - the Bank of Greece called for “pragmatism and flexibility” in its 
interim monetary policy report released today.

This emerging positive momentum in the economy needs to be supported and 
consolidated through adherence to the programme targets and an accelerated 
implementation of the reforms and privatisations agreed on.

Specifically, the Bank of Greece expects GDP to grow by a marginal 0.1% in 
2016, before picking up to 2.5 % in 2017 and further to 3% in 2018 and 2019, 
supported by investment, consumption and exports.

But an ongoing review of the debt-stricken country’s creditor-mandated reforms 
would have to be wrapped up quickly, the bank said, so that Greece could take 
the next step towards inclusion in the European Central Bank’s QE bond-buying 
programme.

There is not much time left, in the light of upcoming national elections in a 
number of euro area countries.

Progress, it added, would be easier if lenders also agreed to lower 
expectations of Athens achieving a primary budget surplus of 3.5 % by 2018.

Tsipras is expected to raise this issue – and the decision by the euro zone’s 
bailout agency, or ESM, to put short-term debt relief measures for Athens on 
hold - when he holds talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin this 
evening.

Greece under fire over Christmas bonus for low-income pensioners

Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics>, says the CBI surveys suggests 
the weaker official manufacturing data for October will prove to be a blip.

[It] suggests that the 1% monthly fall in manufacturing output in October, as 
revealed by the ONS figures earlier this month, was just a temporary blip. 
Accordingly, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced 
over the coming quarters.

Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says 2017 could be a tougher 
year for manufacturers.

Despite the decent December CBI industrial trends survey, there are 
significant potential problems for the manufacturing sector that look likely to 
build up in 2017.

In particular, business confidence is likely to be hampered by mounting 
uncertainty over the Brexit process, constraining investment plans and limiting 
demand for capital goods.

It also looks inevitable that consumers will become markedly less able (due to 
diminishing purchasing power) and likely more reluctant to buy big ticket 
consumer durable items over the coming months.
