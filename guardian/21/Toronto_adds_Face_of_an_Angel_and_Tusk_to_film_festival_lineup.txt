Winterbottom's entry is The Face of an Angel, a crime thriller inspired by the 
Amanda Knox/Meredith Kercher murder case,

 with Daniel Br√ºhl as a film-maker researching a film adaptation of a book 
written by Kate Beckinsale's author. Winterbottom leads a small charge of UK 
film-makers who had been conspicuous by their absence in Toronto's initial 
announcement. He will be joined by Berberian Sound Studio director Strickland, 
whose third film, The Duke of Burgundy, is to receive its world premiere. 
Starring Borgen's Sidse Babett Knudsen, it promises to be an intense 
Bergmanesque study of the relationship between two women.

Other Brits who have world premieres in the lineup include Broomfield, whose 
Tales of the Grim Sleeper is a study of the notorious serial killings in Los 
Angeles in the 1980s and 2000s, and MirrorMask director Dave McKean, whose 
part-animated Luna follows the hallucinatory grief of a couple who have lost 
their baby.

Smith's new film, Tusk, also has a UK connection, in that it was inspired by a 
Gumtree advert seeking a flatmate prepared to dress as a walrus.

 Smith's film is a horror comedy starring Michael Parks, featuring the actor, 
in Smith's words, reciting"some Lewis Carroll and The Rime of the Ancient 
Mariner to some poor motherfucker sewn into a realistic walrus costume".

Toronto also sees a raft of international and North American premieres of 
films previously picked for other festivals. Frederick Wiseman's National 
Gallery, Gabe Polsky's Red Army, Abderrahmane Sissako's Timbuktu and Andrey 
Zvyagintsev's Leviathan have already shown at Cannes, while Act of Killing's 
Joshua Oppenheimer's latest, The Look of Silence, and Roy Andersson's A Pigeon 
Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence will come straight from the Venice film 
festival. Hyena, which opened the Edinburgh film festival in June, has also 
been given a slot.
