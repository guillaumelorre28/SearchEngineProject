“The integrity unit has completed its inquiry into the Jarryd Hayne video,” an 
NRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> spokesman said. “No action will be 
taken but the integrity unit has sent Jarryd a letter reminding him not to 
associate with anyone who would damage the image of the game.”

Hayne met with NRL officials in September after the social media video showed 
Hayne with alleged Hell’s Angels member and former Titans Under-20 player Chris 
Bloomfield at an end-of-season party.


The code-hopping star appears to hand Bloomfield a wad of cash in the footage. 
However Hayne claimed he had never previously met Bloomfield and did not give 
him the money, a version the Integrity Unit accepted.

Bloomfield is facing extortion charges at Southport Magistrate Court and said 
to be a bikie according to detectives from Queensland’s Taskforce Maxima. He 
has pleaded not guilty to the charges.


The outcome comes after the NRL repeatedly warned players this year not to 
consort with bikies and known or accused criminals.
