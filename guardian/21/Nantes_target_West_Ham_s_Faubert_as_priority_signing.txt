The Nantes <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nantes> coach Elie Baup has 
earmarked the signing of West Ham's Julien Faubert as "a priority" as the club 
attempt to pull away from the relegation zone in the French First Division. The 
France international, a Â£6m signing from Bordeaux 18 months ago, is available 
for transfer as Gianfranco Zola moves to trim his squad in response to the 
effects of the credit crunch.

Faubert suffered a ruptured achilles tendon in pre-season last term which 
denied him a debut for six months and he has been used as a utility player over 
the current campaign, filling in at full-back as well as in his favoured 
attacking midfield role. Yet, after only 19Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> starts, he expressed a 
desire to return to France, with Nantes prepared to fight Lyon and Bordeaux for 
his signature. "In my mind, if I could sign anyone, the priority would be 
Julien Faubert," said Baup.

Marseille hope to sign the former Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United 
striker Henrik Larsson on a six-month contract.
