Of the 28 solutions to clues provided, 14 are to be entered vertically and 14 
horizontally: all of them to be entered centripetally. Solutions to numbered 
clues 1 to 20 are placed in the grid where the numbers 1 to 20 are to be found 
on a standard dartboard.

Solutions to the remaining eight (unnumbered) clues are to be entered 
jigsaw-wise wherever they will fit. The remaining two (unclued) solutions are 
items regularly found in a kitchen: OXO and AGA and are not clued. L (for 50, 
the bullseye) should be entered at the centre of the dartboard.
