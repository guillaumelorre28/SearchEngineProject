 America's most towering ego, Donald Trump, threw his hat into the presidential 
election ring yesterday by announcing a possible run for the White House next 
year.
"I will be forming a presidential exploratory committee, effective tomorrow," 
the millionaire financier and property magnate told CNN's Larry King.

His top choice as vice-presidential running mate would be the television 
talkshow host Oprah Winfrey. "She is terrific," he said. A spokeswoman said 
Winfrey was not interested.

Mr Trump's announcement is the latest bizarre turn in an election where 
celebrity is beginning to rival political experience as the key qualification.

The actor Warren Beatty has already flirted with a presidential run next year, 
while such personalities as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cybill Shepherd and Jerry 
Springer have also publicly toyed with the possibility of relaunching 
themselves as politicians.

But the Trump declaration is part of a process of political manoeuvring in and 
around the Reform party, which was formed in 1992 by the Texas billionaire Ross 
Perot.

Mr Perot is believed to favour the disenchanted Republican maverick Pat 
Buchanan as the party's nominee next year. But Mr Perot's chief rival in the 
Reform party, the ex-wrestler turned Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura, is 
afraid that Mr Buchanan might do well enough next year to encourage him to have 
a further run in 2004, when Mr Ventura would like to run.

As a result, Mr Ventura has been casting around for a high-profile ego who 
could plausibly take on Mr Buchanan.

Mr Trump would be "a better fit" for the Reform party, the governor said 
yesterday. "I think that he's more socially liberal, fiscally conservative, 
which is what I believe the Reform party is."
