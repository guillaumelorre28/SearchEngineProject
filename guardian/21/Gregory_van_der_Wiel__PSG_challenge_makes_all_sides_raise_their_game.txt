The Paris Saint-Germain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> 
defender Gregory van der Wiel has warned his side every team they face are 
raising their game in the hope of causing an upset.

The Ligue 1 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> champions 
travel to Rennes on Saturday knowing victory would put them top of the table.

Rennes are one point behind and the Dutchman told his club's website: “We are 
expecting a tough match. It’s never easy playing againstRennes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rennes>. In France, all the clubs want to 
beat Paris, so they will be playing with a lot of heart. We have to stay 
focused 100% to get a result from a match that won’t be easy.”

PSG will be without the defender David Luiz, who took a knock to his knee 
while playing for Brazil against Colombia.

The Rennes manager, Philippe Montanier, said PSG are an even stronger side 
this season. Speaking onwww.ligue1.com <http://www.ligue1.com/>, he said: “I 
think the Parisians will be even harder to beat this season but the teams that 
manage to do that will get even more credit. I hope that we’ll be part of that 
group. We want to play well at home, show our best face.”
