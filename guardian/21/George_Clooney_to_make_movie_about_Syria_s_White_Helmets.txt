White Helmets <http://variety.com/t/the-white-helmets/>, which was released in 
September and is on this year’s Oscar shortlist.

The White Helmets, whose work has come to wider attention during the fallout 
from the civil war that began in 2011, is credited with saving around 60,000 
people. The group has lost around 150 of their own members.

“In the White Helmets, we have a motto: to save one life is to save humanity,” 
says one volunteer in the documentary.

Last year, Clooney told the BBC  
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32791065>that he wanted to try 
and do more to help the people of Syria, but without moving formally into 
politics. In 2005, the actor won an Oscar for his role as a CIA operative in 
Syriana, which was set in an unnamed state in the Persian Gulf.

He and producing partner Heslov won the best picture Oscar for Argo in 2012.
