The Melburnian took gold in the quad singles in Rio, as well as quad doubles 
alongside Heath Davidson.

The three-time Paralympian also became one of a handful of Australians to win 
gold medals in two sports, after switching from wheelchair basketball.

The 25-year-old won gold with the Rollers in Beijing in 2008 at age 17 and 
silver with them again in London.

Alcott was also nominated for The Don award for Australia’s sportsperson of 
the year.
