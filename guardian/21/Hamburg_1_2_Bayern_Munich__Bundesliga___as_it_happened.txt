Well, a just-about deserved win for Bayern, and they move 11 points clear at 
the top.Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> battled well, 
and had a 10-minute spell in the second half where they caused Bayern problems, 
but once Lewandowski had restored Bayern’s lead with a slightly fortunate 
deflection, the champions looked comfortable, and David Alaba was close to 
making it 3-1 with a wonderful free kick that hit the bar.

Commiserations to Hamburg, but the Bayern winning machine does it again. 
Thanks for reading – goodbye.

90 min: Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> playing it 
long, but Badstuber has been dominant, and he heads another one away. But 
Robben, who’s in for Douglas Costa, is called for a trip on Gregoritsch, and 
this is a free kick 30 yards from goal. Chance for Hamburg! Three minutes of 
added time.

88 min: This could be red for Nicolai Muller, who’s already on a booking: he 
was high on Xabi Alonso as the Bayern midfielder went to head it, but no card 
from Felix Zwayer, and probably the right decision: it looked as though it was 
a genuine attempt to win the ball. No further punishment for the HSV player.

82 min: Gregoritsch, the substitute on for Ilicevic, takes it, and it’s into

Final change for Hamburg: Gideon Jung on for Kacar.

80 min: Great save from Adler! Vidal pulled it back from the right, Thiago 
struck it goalwards, and Adler came up big on the deflected shot! It looked 
like it skipped up off Cleber, but the keeper did very well to tip it over.

78 min: Good defending from Diekmeier to stop Costa. Now Rudnevs is clear on 
the right hand side, but his ball in is really disappointing. Good turn from 
the substitute but the cross was subpar.

76 min: Great chance for a third Bayern goal, but Douglas Costa gets his shot 
wrong! Coman absolutely burned Djourou down the right side, and crossed for 
Costa, who ran into the area unchecked, but Costa’s volleyed effort was well 
off target! So off target, in fact, that it never went out of play, and Coman 
collected before it ran for a throw.

Change for Hamburg: Rudnevs in for Lasogga.

74 min: We also think that Hamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> goal is down as a Xabi Alonso 
own goal. He must have got the slightest deflection – all three players 
(Lasogga, Xabi and Hunt) had a claim to it.

Neuer quickly off his line to claim Hunt’s cross.

73 min: Just to confirm: Lewandowski did get the second goal. Muller’s shot – 
turned in by Lewandowksi. I make that 17 league goals for the season for the 
Pole.

68 min: Bayern have settled down again after that brief flurry from the home 
side. The visitors look composed in possession again, and that’s close from 
Lewandowski! On the volley, from Thiago’s pass, 
David-Platt-against-Belgium-style, but just wide of the post. Super effort.

66 min: Such a wonderful free kick from Alaba: he struck it so nicely, with 
the side of his foot, and it came back flush off the post. Really unlucky.

64 min: Now Bayern are back on top, and Nicolai Muller gives away another free 
kick in a dangerous area. Alaba looks like he fancies this.

62 min: Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> are fuming, but 
that’s a seriously good decision from the linesman. Bayern wanted a penalty 
after Lewandowski was tripped in the box, but the ref said no. Bayern played 
on, and Muller shot for goal: it looked as though it was heading wide, but 
Lewandowski just reacted quickest, poked out a leg, and diverted it past Adler! 
It looked offside, but it wasn’t: great call from the official, and Bayern are 
ahead again!
 Robert Lewandowski celebrates after scoring his second goal of the game.

GOAL! Hamburg 1-2 Bayern (Lewandowski 61)

But it doesn’t matter, because Lewandowski, the ur-poacher, has Bayern back in 
front.

55 min: It was a lovely ball in from Hunt – and did Lasogga actually get a 
touch? I think he missed it. That should be Hunt’s goal. Or maybe a Xabi Alonso 
own goal? Bayern were possibly a bit slack with the marking but the cross was 
delicious: very difficult to defend against.

More bad news for Bayern: Boateng went down and immediately gestured to the 
bench. It looks like his groin, and Javi Martinez is on in his stead.

54 min: That’s so crazy. Bayern were all over Hamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg>, but Lasogga won a free kick 
about 40 yards from goal, and Hunt’s ball in was a beauty: left-footed, 
inswinging, and Lasogga stole in and got an extremely faint touch to help it 
beyond Neuer. Game on!

51 min: Coman’s ball in, and Thiago, breaking from midfield, arrives late and 
pushes a header towards goal, but his header is over! That’s at least four 
attempts on goal from Bayern in the first six minutes of the half.

48 min: Great long pass from Xabi, first time, to Costa, wide on the left, 
who’s in absolutely acres of space. He takes a touch, and it sits up nicely, 
but his left-foot blast is just over the bar. Decent effort, but he might have 
made more of that: Diekmeier was nowhere near him.

against Djourou, and he cuts inside and fires on with his left. Adler should 
hold it, but he can’t, and it’s a corner.

Ah yes! Ulrich Meise is so right: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the 
Bundesliga’s leading scorer with 18. Lewandowski has 16. Thanks Ulrich!

Bayern well on top: they’ve had about a million percent possession, and lead 
from Lewandowski’s penalty after Adler’s clumsy foul on Muller.Hamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> were decent for half an hour, 
but then they lost a bit of discipline: they keep giving away free kicks!

Reasonably entertaining, anyway. See you in 15.

42 min: Now Nicolai Muller is booked for another trip on Coman. Honestly, 
Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> must have conceded six 
or seven free kicks in this area already. They need to cool their jets, as they 
say. From thedelivery, Muller heads just over! Close.

Incidentally, Muller wanted another penalty just before that, and quite right: 
watching the replay he was tripped again in the box! No call, though. I guess 
it would have been a bit much to give two penalties in five minutes – and on 
the same player – but that was a clear trip.

38 min: Lots going on in that sequence: Felix Zwayer played an excellent 
advantage, and Xabi, I think it was, released Muller with a ball over the top. 
Muller ran beyond the defence, and Adler, the keeper, rushed out – and was late 
on the Bayern player as he tried to lift it over him. The shot bounced wide, 
but Muller was clearly tripped, and there wasn’t much argument fromHamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg>, to be honest.

Lewandowski converted it coolly, and Bayern lead. Credit to the referee for 
allowing play to continue in the first place.
 Robert Lewandowski puts Bayern Munich ahead from the penalty spot.

his cross is too close to Adler. Looks as though Coman will be OK.

Well, a just-about deserved win for Bayern, and they move 11 points clear at 
the top.Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> battled well, 
and had a 10-minute spell in the second half where they caused Bayern problems, 
but once Lewandowski had restored Bayern’s lead with a slightly fortunate 
deflection, the champions looked comfortable, and David Alaba was close to 
making it 3-1 with a wonderful free kick that hit the bar.

Commiserations to Hamburg, but the Bayern winning machine does it again. 
Thanks for reading – goodbye.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/22/hamburg-bayern-munich-bundesliga-report-robert-lewandowski> 
That’s it!
 
90 min +3: Badstuber heads away again, and that’s probably it.
 
90 min +2: Time for one last Hamburg attack, but they give it away to Xabi 
Alonso. Lewandowski trips Ostrzolek andHamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> send everyone forward.
 
90 min+1: It’s Gregoritsch with it … and it’s just wide! Neuer probably had it 
covered.
 
90 min: Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> playing it 
long, but Badstuber has been dominant, and he heads another one away. But 
Robben, who’s in for Douglas Costa, is called for a trip on Gregoritsch, and 
this is a free kick 30 yards from goal. Chance for Hamburg! Three minutes of 
added time.
 
88 min: This could be red for Nicolai Muller, who’s already on a booking: he 
was high on Xabi Alonso as the Bayern midfielder went to head it, but no card 
from Felix Zwayer, and probably the right decision: it looked as though it was 
a genuine attempt to win the ball. No further punishment for the HSV player.
 
87 min: The sprightly Rudnevs is always looking to run in beyond, but Javi 
Martinez is quickly across to see the danger.
 
86 min: Lewandowski does very well to win a throw by the corner flag. But 
Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> win it back, and send it 
long.
 
84 min: Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> pushing here. 
Five minutes to go. Can they do it?
 
82 min: Gregoritsch, the substitute on for Ilicevic, takes it, and it’s into 
the wall. Gregoritsch again – and into the wall again. A waste.

Final change for Hamburg: Gideon Jung on for Kacar.
 
81 min: Ooh, that’s a foul right on the edge of the box: Rudnevs nipped in and 
Alonso was ball-watching – a yellow card for the Bayern player and a big chance 
forHamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg>.
 
80 min: Great save from Adler! Vidal pulled it back from the right, Thiago 
struck it goalwards, and Adler came up big on the deflected shot! It looked 
like it skipped up off Cleber, but the keeper did very well to tip it over.
 
78 min: Good defending from Diekmeier to stop Costa. Now Rudnevs is clear on 
the right hand side, but his ball in is really disappointing. Good turn from 
the substitute but the cross was subpar.
 
76 min: Great chance for a third Bayern goal, but Douglas Costa gets his shot 
wrong! Coman absolutely burned Djourou down the right side, and crossed for 
Costa, who ran into the area unchecked, but Costa’s volleyed effort was well 
off target! So off target, in fact, that it never went out of play, and Coman 
collected before it ran for a throw.

Change for Hamburg: Rudnevs in for Lasogga.
 
74 min: We also think that Hamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> goal is down as a Xabi Alonso 
own goal. He must have got the slightest deflection – all three players 
(Lasogga, Xabi and Hunt) had a claim to it.

Neuer quickly off his line to claim Hunt’s cross.

 
73 min: Just to confirm: Lewandowski did get the second goal. Muller’s shot – 
turned in by Lewandowksi. I make that 17 league goals for the season for the 
Pole.
 
70 min: Bayern change: Vidal is on for Muller.
 
69 min: Bayern looking for a third, and Coman’s ball in is headed behind by 
Djourou.
 
68 min: Bayern have settled down again after that brief flurry from the home 
side. The visitors look composed in possession again, and that’s close from 
Lewandowski! On the volley, from Thiago’s pass, 
David-Platt-against-Belgium-style, but just wide of the post. Super effort.
 
66 min: Such a wonderful free kick from Alaba: he struck it so nicely, with 
the side of his foot, and it came back flush off the post. Really unlucky.
 
65 min: It’s Alaba, and it’s off the post! So unlucky! Adler was beaten.
 
64 min: Now Bayern are back on top, and Nicolai Muller gives away another free 
kick in a dangerous area. Alaba looks like he fancies this.
 
62 min: Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> are fuming, but 
that’s a seriously good decision from the linesman. Bayern wanted a penalty 
after Lewandowski was tripped in the box, but the ref said no. Bayern played 
on, and Muller shot for goal: it looked as though it was heading wide, but 
Lewandowski just reacted quickest, poked out a leg, and diverted it past Adler! 
It looked offside, but it wasn’t: great call from the official, and Bayern are 
ahead again!

But it doesn’t matter, because Lewandowski, the ur-poacher, has Bayern back in 
front.
 
60 min: Corner for Bayern now – and is that a penalty? No! That looked dead-on!
 
58 min: Diekmeier goes down the right and wins a corner off Xabi, but they 
inexplicably go short! Bayern win it back, break at speed, and suddenlyHamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> are stretched, but Lewandowski’s 
effort is wide. Gormlessness of the highest order from the hosts – but they got 
away with it.
 
57 min: That goal’s really perked Hamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> up. They started this second 
period at half-pace, but now there’s a spring in their step, and the HSV fans 
are singing loudly.
 
55 min: It was a lovely ball in from Hunt – and did Lasogga actually get a 
touch? I think he missed it. That should be Hunt’s goal. Or maybe a Xabi Alonso 
own goal? Bayern were possibly a bit slack with the marking but the cross was 
delicious: very difficult to defend against.

More bad news for Bayern: Boateng went down and immediately gestured to the 
bench. It looks like his groin, and Javi Martinez is on in his stead.
 
54 min: That’s so crazy. Bayern were all over Hamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg>, but Lasogga won a free kick 
about 40 yards from goal, and Hunt’s ball in was a beauty: left-footed, 
inswinging, and Lasogga stole in and got an extremely faint touch to help it 
beyond Neuer. Game on!
 
Wow! Where did that come from?
 
51 min: Coman’s ball in, and Thiago, breaking from midfield, arrives late and 
pushes a header towards goal, but his header is over! That’s at least four 
attempts on goal from Bayern in the first six minutes of the half.
 
49 min: Now Lewandowksi goes for goal on the half-turn. Adler saves, but 
Bayern have started in this second half like a train.
 
48 min: Great long pass from Xabi, first time, to Costa, wide on the left, 
who’s in absolutely acres of space. He takes a touch, and it sits up nicely, 
but his left-foot blast is just over the bar. Decent effort, but he might have 
made more of that: Diekmeier was nowhere near him.
 
47 min: The corner is half-cleared, and it falls to Boateng on the edge of the 
box, but his left-foot shot is miles over.
 
46 min: Coman, starting on the right this half, is suddenly free, one v one 
against Djourou, and he cuts inside and fires on with his left. Adler should 
hold it, but he can’t, and it’s a corner.
 
46 min: And we’re underway in the second period.
 
Ah yes! Ulrich Meise is so right: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the 
Bundesliga’s leading scorer with 18. Lewandowski has 16. Thanks Ulrich!
 
Bayern well on top: they’ve had about a million percent possession, and lead 
from Lewandowski’s penalty after Adler’s clumsy foul on Muller.Hamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> were decent for half an hour, 
but then they lost a bit of discipline: they keep giving away free kicks!

Reasonably entertaining, anyway. See you in 15.
 
That’s the whistle.
 
45 min: A minute of stoppage time. And Lewandowski races clear, and shows 
great pace to go past Diekmeier, butHamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> funnel back and do enough to 
regain it.
 
44 min: Yellow card for Lahm on Ilicevic. He won the ball, but it was from 
behind. It’s getting feisty!
 
42 min: Now Nicolai Muller is booked for another trip on Coman. Honestly, 
Hamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> must have conceded six 
or seven free kicks in this area already. They need to cool their jets, as they 
say. From thedelivery, Muller heads just over! Close.

Incidentally, Muller wanted another penalty just before that, and quite right: 
watching the replay he was tripped again in the box! No call, though. I guess 
it would have been a bit much to give two penalties in five minutes – and on 
the same player – but that was a clear trip.
 
40 min: Hamburg concede another free kick in that right-back slot, but again 
Xabi Alonso can’t make it count. Bayern pressing here, though.Hamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> can’t get on the ball.
 
38 min: Lots going on in that sequence: Felix Zwayer played an excellent 
advantage, and Xabi, I think it was, released Muller with a ball over the top. 
Muller ran beyond the defence, and Adler, the keeper, rushed out – and was late 
on the Bayern player as he tried to lift it over him. The shot bounced wide, 
but Muller was clearly tripped, and there wasn’t much argument fromHamburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg>, to be honest.

Lewandowski converted it coolly, and Bayern lead. Credit to the referee for 
allowing play to continue in the first place.

And Bayern’s leading scorer sends Adler the wrong way.
 
Drama! Adler on Muller.
 
35 min: Coman, who is so quick one-on-one, goes by Diekmeier with ease, but 
his cross is too close to Adler. Looks as though Coman will be OK.
