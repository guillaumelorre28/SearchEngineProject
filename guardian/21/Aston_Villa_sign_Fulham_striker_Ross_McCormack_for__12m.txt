Aston Villa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> have signed the 
Fulham striker Ross McCormack for £12m. He has agreed a four-year deal and will 
link up with Roberto Di Matteo’s squad before the Sheffield Wednesday game away 
on Sunday.

The fee is the second-highest transfer in the club’s history, with Darren Bent 
being Villa’s record signing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/18/darren-bent-aston-villa-sunderland>
 at £24m in 2011.

Di Matteo told the Aston Villa website 
<https://www.avfc.co.uk/News/2016/08/04/mccormack-confirmed>: “I’m delighted to 
bring Ross on board. He’s a player with proven track record and plenty of 
experience in the division.

“He is a player whose goalscoring record has been excellent everywhere he has 
been and we feel he can be an important addition.”

McCormack, 29, who joined Fulham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham> 
in 2014 from Leeds United for £11m, scored 23 goals for the Cottagers last 
season and leaves having bagged 42 in his two-year spell.

Norwich had been interested in the 29-year-old Scotland international but 
failed to agree a fee with Fulham, who accepted Villa’s bid on Wednesday.

McCormack becomes Di Matteo’s fourth summer buy after Tommy Elphick, Aaron 
Tshibola and Pierluigi Gollini as the club prepare for their first season 
outside the top flight since 1987.
