Chelsea were far too good for MK Dons in the end. Oscar’s hat-trick did most 
of the damage in what was a bizarre first half littered with fine saves and 
terrible misses. The second period was a little calmer but the Blues were 
always in control and progress to the fifth round.Join me here right now for 
the draw!

82 mins: Pass, pass, pass, pass. Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are set on cruise control. 
Suddenly Fabregas launches a ball forwards and Baba Rahman is in behind the 
Dons defence, but he’s tugged back by Spence who is booked. Forster-Caskey 
tries another long-range effort at the other end but it flies over the 
crossbar. Local boy Daniel Powell replaces Curruthers.

63 mins: Hazard gamely chased a high ball all the way to the byline where he 
kept it in and looked for a team-mate. Bertrand Traore promptly arrived and 
Hazard fed the forward who swept the ball first-time into the far corner with 
his left foot from around 10 yards. A very well-taken goal by the 20-year-old.

60 mins: The Dons keep coming forwards but they are a little short of ideas 
when they arrive in the final third. Hall tries an effort from range and 
Courtois tips over.

57 mins: Hazard collected a return pass on the run and seemed to get a bit of 
a raking down the back of the calf by Potter in the area. Oscar wanted to take 
the penalty from Hazard but captain, leader, legend John Terry settled the 
argument, and Hazard slotted his first of the season. Costa is replaced by 
Bertrand Traore.

GOAL! MK Dons 1-4 Chelsea (Hazard pen, 55)

Hazard steps up and cooly passes the ball into the bottom-left corner, sending 
Martin the wrong way.

53 mins: Hazard and Oscar work a nice one-two on the edge of the area but the 
Belgian can’t take control of the return pass.

51 mins: Costa chases a long ball over the Dons defence but Martin rushes out 
of goal and just nips in to grab the ball before the striker could get there. 
The frantic first half has been replaced by a more steady and methodical 
second, this far anyway.

49 mins: Better from the hosts who work down the left and earn a corner. 
Murphy bends a dangerous ball to the penalty spot but Ivanovic is able to clear 
unimpeded.

47 mins: MK Dons <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> start the 
second half a little less gung-ho than their strategy for the majority of the 
first. This might just be the way to go. The game’s tempo has slowed a little 
though, so there isn’t much to report.

Peeeeep! The players are back out and the second half is under way. The MK Dons
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> official twitter feed described 
Chelsea’s first-half performance as ‘clinical’. Interesting interpretation.
MK Dons FC (@MKDonsFC) 
Applause from the home fans as the players head off. Dons have played some 
good stuff but@ChelseaFC <https://twitter.com/ChelseaFC> have been clinical. 1-3

An MK Dons <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> FA Cup tie is always 
valid excuse to wheel out Dele Alli’s first professional goal. He’ll make a 
decent player one day.

Re J’s email (see 2 mins), apologies for letting a game of football get in the 
way of a good MBM. Back on topic... does Oscar look a bit like Danger Mouse? 
Only when he smiles, obviously. Danger Mouse always smiles.

Half-time: MK Dons 1-3 Chelsea

Oscar’s hat-trick puts Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> 
in total control at the break in what has been a remarkably open, slightly 
farcical and thoroughly entertaining half.

45 mins: Oscar dribbled down the left and then changed direction, cutting 
inside along the box. He was under pressure, but only the sort of light 
badgering that you or I might buckle under, not a real professional footballer. 
Oscar is unmoved and carries the ball all the way to the centre of the pitch 
before curling a well-placed finish beyond Martin.

Chelsea were far too good for MK Dons in the end. Oscar’s hat-trick did most 
of the damage in what was a bizarre first half littered with fine saves and 
terrible misses. The second period was a little calmer but the Blues were 
always in control and progress to the fifth round.Join me here right now for 
the draw!

Bye, and thanks for reading.
 Oscar celebrates with the matchball at the end. Photograph: John 
Sibley/Reuters  
Jon Moss blows his whistle and that’s that. 
 
90 mins: There will be one more minute for MK Dons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> to endure.
 
89 mins: Willian takes a whack on the toe and he’s down on the ground in a bit 
of pain.
 
87 mins: It’s a record attendance tonight at Stadium MK, by the way, of 28,127 
– higher than the number that attended their League Cup win against Manchester 
United last season.
 
85 mins: Powell jinks into the box and lets fly, and his low shot is saved by 
the feet of Courtois.
 
82 mins: Pass, pass, pass, pass. Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are set on cruise control. 
Suddenly Fabregas launches a ball forwards and Baba Rahman is in behind the 
Dons defence, but he’s tugged back by Spence who is booked. Forster-Caskey 
tries another long-range effort at the other end but it flies over the 
crossbar. Local boy Daniel Powell replaces Curruthers.
 
79 mins: Traore probably should have his second but slips as he shoots in the 
box and his effort bobbles wide.
 
76 mins: Willian lines up a tempting free-kick but can only hit the wall. Dean 
Bowditch, who hasn’t seen much of the ball up front forMK Dons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> today, is replaced by Nicky 
Maynard.
 
74 mins: Fabregas takes a pass from Pedro in the box and tries to squeeze the 
ball past Martin from a tight angle but the goalkeeper traps it between turf 
and shin pad.
 
72 mins: Pedro dribbles through the middle and feeds Ivanovic out on the 
right, who drills a low cross to nobody when Pedro was screaming for a return 
pass.
 
70 mins: Loftus-Cheek brings the ball down brilliantly with his chest and 
starts movingChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> forwards 
again. They win a corner which Willian whips in, but the danger is dealt with.
 
67 mins: Jonny Williams replaces the quietly impressive Josh Murphy on the 
wing forMK Dons <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons>.
 
65 mins: Good news for MK Dons: Oscar and Hazard are off! Bad news for MK 
Dons: Pedro and Willian are on!
 
63 mins: Hazard gamely chased a high ball all the way to the byline where he 
kept it in and looked for a team-mate. Bertrand Traore promptly arrived and 
Hazard fed the forward who swept the ball first-time into the far corner with 
his left foot from around 10 yards. A very well-taken goal by the 20-year-old.
 
Lovely finish from the substitute and he opens his Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> account.

61 mins: Murphy wants a penalty from a robust Rahman challenge but Jon Moss 
isn’t interested, and rightly so.
 
60 mins: The Dons keep coming forwards but they are a little short of ideas 
when they arrive in the final third. Hall tries an effort from range and 
Courtois tips over.
 
57 mins: Hazard collected a return pass on the run and seemed to get a bit of 
a raking down the back of the calf by Potter in the area. Oscar wanted to take 
the penalty from Hazard but captain, leader, legend John Terry settled the 
argument, and Hazard slotted his first of the season. Costa is replaced by 
Bertrand Traore.
 
Hazard steps up and cooly passes the ball into the bottom-left corner, sending 
Martin the wrong way.

55 mins: Hazard breaks into the box and Potter clumsily catches the winger... 
Penalty to Chelsea!
 
53 mins: Hazard and Oscar work a nice one-two on the edge of the area but the 
Belgian can’t take control of the return pass.
 
51 mins: Costa chases a long ball over the Dons defence but Martin rushes out 
of goal and just nips in to grab the ball before the striker could get there. 
The frantic first half has been replaced by a more steady and methodical 
second, this far anyway.
 
49 mins: Better from the hosts who work down the left and earn a corner. 
Murphy bends a dangerous ball to the penalty spot but Ivanovic is able to clear 
unimpeded.
 
47 mins: MK Dons <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> start the 
second half a little less gung-ho than their strategy for the majority of the 
first. This might just be the way to go. The game’s tempo has slowed a little 
though, so there isn’t much to report.
 
Peeeeep! The players are back out and the second half is under way. The MK Dons
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> official twitter feed described 
Chelsea’s first-half performance as ‘clinical’. Interesting interpretation.

Applause from the home fans as the players head off. Dons have played some 
good stuff but@ChelseaFC <https://twitter.com/ChelseaFC> have been clinical. 1-3

Half-time entertainment

An MK Dons <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons> FA Cup tie is always 
valid excuse to wheel out Dele Alli’s first professional goal. He’ll make a 
decent player one day.

Re J’s email (see 2 mins), apologies for letting a game of football get in the 
way of a good MBM. Back on topic... does Oscar look a bit like Danger Mouse? 
Only when he smiles, obviously. Danger Mouse always smiles.
 
Oscar’s hat-trick puts Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> 
in total control at the break in what has been a remarkably open, slightly 
farcical and thoroughly entertaining half.
 
45 mins: Oscar dribbled down the left and then changed direction, cutting 
inside along the box. He was under pressure, but only the sort of light 
badgering that you or I might buckle under, not a real professional footballer. 
Oscar is unmoved and carries the ball all the way to the centre of the pitch 
before curling a well-placed finish beyond Martin.
 
Oscar goes on a lovely weaving run before bending the ball into the far corner 
for his hat-trick.
