And that’s your lot from this one. The Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> season is underway, the sun 
is shining, the Leeds fans are unhappy with their club. Everything in its right 
place.

Very impressive that from QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>, even 
if Leeds were a complete non-entity, a few brief flashes aside. Chery, Polter, 
Luongo and Shodipo all excellent, and they kick off the season in fine style.

90 mins + 4: Battering ram stuff from Polter. A long diagonal into the Leeds 
box is not dealt with properly by Coyle, Polter bullies him off the ball then 
absolutely leathers a shot into the top corner from a tight angle. Woofety 
woof. Coyle shouts at his colleagues, seemingly under the impression that was 
someone else’s fault.

90 mins + 3: Coyle does well down the right and clips a cross to the back 
stick, which Antonsson controls and shoots left-footed, but hits it over. A 
chant of ‘Massimo, time to go’ starts up from the away end.

which would have been much better had he not fairly blatantly controlled the

clean through on goal, Smithies seems to come out too far and gives Antonsson 
the option of either dinking it over or going round him, but he elects for a

81 mins: A long ball down the field is chased down at pace by Polter, who 
charges towards Green, but the keeper just calmly takes a step to one side, the 
ball coming with him, and clears back from whence it came. Almost makes up for 
the flapping for the goal, that.

69 mins: El-Khayati is in amongst it straight away, but tries a shot when 
there were passes on from the left of the box. The ball breaks for Chery with a 
slightly better angle, and his effort is beaten away by Green at the near post.

51 mins: Hall pumps a long ball towards the Leeds goal and breath is held as 
Green comes out to take the catch...but take it he does, with an 
uncharacteristic lack of fuss.

49 mins: Grimes hits it with plenty of swerve and dip, but just not enough of 
either and it drops just over the bar. The Leeds fans behind the goal give some 
very vocal ‘encouragement’ to former Huddersfield keeper Smithies as he takes 
the goal kick.

So QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> lead thanks to that shambles 
of an early goal, but they fully deserve to be ahead. Leeds have been a 
complete non-entity, with nothing from Dallas or Roofe out wide. Alex Mowatt is 
on the bench, so he might provide a bit of invention.

And that’s your lot from this one. The Championship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> season is underway, the sun 
is shining, the Leeds fans are unhappy with their club. Everything in its right 
place.
 
Very impressive that from QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>, even 
if Leeds were a complete non-entity, a few brief flashes aside. Chery, Polter, 
Luongo and Shodipo all excellent, and they kick off the season in fine style.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
90 mins + 4: Battering ram stuff from Polter. A long diagonal into the Leeds 
box is not dealt with properly by Coyle, Polter bullies him off the ball then 
absolutely leathers a shot into the top corner from a tight angle. Woofety 
woof. Coyle shouts at his colleagues, seemingly under the impression that was 
someone else’s fault.
 
Woof.
 
90 mins + 3: Coyle does well down the right and clips a cross to the back 
stick, which Antonsson controls and shoots left-footed, but hits it over. A 
chant of ‘Massimo, time to go’ starts up from the away end.
 
90mins + 2: This Sacko lad looks sparky - he speeds down the right, puts in a 
nice cross from the byline and there are some handball claims against Luongo, 
but nothing doing there.
 
90 mins: Polter harasses Bartley into conceding a late corner, from the QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> left. That’s wasted, but there are 
four minutes of added time to come.
 
88 mins: An appearance money change for QPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr>, as James Perch replaces Chery with 
two minutes remaining.
 
87 mins: Sacko smacks a nice finishing into the net from the edge of the area, 
which would have been much better had he not fairly blatantly controlled the 
ball with his arm. Not sure why he wasn’t booked for that.
 
85 mins: Chery tries to, erm, well, but a cherry on top by opening up his body 
and trying to curl a left-footed shot into the top corner, but it’s too close 
to Green who makes an easy save.
 
82 mins: Huge chance for Antonsson - he springs the offside trap and is put 
clean through on goal, Smithies seems to come out too far and gives Antonsson 
the option of either dinking it over or going round him, but he elects for a 
placed shot, which he places wide of the post.
 
81 mins: A long ball down the field is chased down at pace by Polter, who 
charges towards Green, but the keeper just calmly takes a step to one side, the 
ball coming with him, and clears back from whence it came. Almost makes up for 
the flapping for the goal, that.
 
80 mins: Sacko seems to have at least injected a little urgency into Leeds: he 
wins the ball and drives down the right, then slips a delicate pass into 
Antonsson’s path, but his attempted swept shot it deflected behind for a corner.
 
78 mins: No. Messing.
Sky Sports EFL (@SkySportsEFL) 
WATCH: That is clinical. Time for QPR to dream this season? Chery converts 
from the penalty spot. More on SS1 now.https://t.co/znfSmuxgEO

77 mins: Imagine how you’d feel if you disappointed Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in 
any way. Strikes you as the sort who wouldn’t shout, just sadly shake his head. 
And that would be so much worse.
 
75 mins: Sub for Leeds - Hadi Sacko comes on for Roofe, who has been quiet on 
day-boo.
 
74 mins: That should be that. Leeds have been better after the break, but they 
haven’t turned this improvement into goals or ever really many proper chances.

Garcia/BPI/REX/Shutterstock  
72 mins: Well, perhaps Cousins won that one, but he was clumsily barged into 
by Vieira and the referee points to the spot.
 
69 mins: El-Khayati is in amongst it straight away, but tries a shot when 
there were passes on from the left of the box. The ball breaks for Chery with a 
slightly better angle, and his effort is beaten away by Green at the near post.
 
68 mins: Change for QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> - Shodipo 
(quiet in the second half after an excellent first) is replaced by Nasser 
El-Khayati.
 
67 mins: Leeds try to work a short corner but their efforts are rendered 
nought after Dallas commits a stupid foul.
 
64 mins: Onouha goes in heavily on Taylor, but nothing doing from the 
officials there. He’s back up in rapid order, mind.
 
63 mins: Chery cuts in from the right and tries a left-footed shot, which 
looks to be sizzling goalwards but it takes a deflection and loops over. Corner 
ball.
 
61 mins: Sub for Leeds - Grimes is off, and new signing Marcus Antonsson comes 
on, probably to play up top with Wood.
 
60 mins: Leeds have definitely been better since the break, although that 
wasn’t saying a great deal.
 
59 mins: Roofe finally gets some sort of decent involvement by dispossessing 
Onouha and driving towards theQPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> 
area, but he has few options and his left-footed shot from just inside the area 
is blocked by a sliding Hall.
 
57 mins: Grimes goes into the book for a sort of high challenge on Shodipo, 
although he didn’t really make much contact and theQPR 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> man made no protest.
 
56 mins: Change for QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> - Gladwin, 
who had been walking a fine line with some of his fouls - is replaced by Jordan 
Cousins, the summer signing from Charlton and a splendid young midfielder.
 
55 mins: Coyle cuts in from the right but his shot is deflected behind for a 
corner. That cross is put to the back post, it drifts towards the other flank 
where Bamba fouls Polter, pointlessly.
 
54 mins: ...but if his aim was to disrupt that wall, he fails, as Wood shoots 
straight into it.
 
53 mins: Another free-kick for Leeds as Gladwin takes out Vieira, this time 
more to the left - Grimes and Wood have their beady ones on this one. The 
referee takes a moment to tell off Bartley, who tries to get in and around the 
wall, Clive.

51 mins: Hall pumps a long ball towards the Leeds goal and breath is held as 
Green comes out to take the catch...but take it he does, with an 
uncharacteristic lack of fuss.
 
49 mins: Grimes hits it with plenty of swerve and dip, but just not enough of 
either and it drops just over the bar. The Leeds fans behind the goal give some 
very vocal ‘encouragement’ to former Huddersfield keeper Smithies as he takes 
the goal kick.
 
48 mins: Free-kick for Leeds about 30 yards out, to the right of centre, which 
Grimes and Dallas are lining up....
 
46 mins: Leeds knock the ball around for a bit...and then give it away 
carelessly. Not the greatest start.
 
And we’re back. Leeds are on the pitch, which is a start. Let’s see if they 
can do anything more advanced than that.
 
So QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> lead thanks to that shambles 
of an early goal, but they fully deserve to be ahead. Leeds have been a 
complete non-entity, with nothing from Dallas or Roofe out wide. Alex Mowatt is 
on the bench, so he might provide a bit of invention.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins: One minute of added time. Leeds gently, gently, gently creeping back 
into it. A bit.
 
43 mins: Taylor slings over a cross looking for Wood in the middle, he misses 
it but so does Bidwell and it makes its way through to Dallas, who leans back 
and smacks his shot over the bar. It was miles over, but that was their best 
moment of the half by quite some distance.
