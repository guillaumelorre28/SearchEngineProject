William Fotheringham's preview

Surprisingly hard for the Tour's first Sunday, a brief run across the middle 
of Corsica with a second category col topping out at almost 1,200m. This will 
be eventful, because the field will have fresh legs; anyone who can climb a 
little bit will have ambitions. Expect at least one favourite to lose time in 
some kind of incident. The obvious candidates for victory are the Slovak Peter 
Sagan or Philippe Gilbert of Belgium, from a largish group of the contenders 
and their lieutenants.
