Day in, day out despite the huge pressure on the NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs>, healthcare professionals change 
patientsâ€™ lives.

In a recent interview, journalist and broadcaster Nick Robinson spoke of how 
grateful he was to the speech and language therapist who helped him get his 
voice back after his vocal cord was damaged in an operation to remove a lung 
tumour.

As well as benefitting from her professional knowhow, Robinson said she was a 
huge emotional support and went above and beyond to help him recover, being 
there to listen to his fears as well as directing him while on air.

At this time of giving and as the new year approaches, we want to highlight 
the work that, day in and day out, healthcare professionals do.
