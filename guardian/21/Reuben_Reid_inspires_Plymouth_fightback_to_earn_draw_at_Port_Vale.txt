Plymouth Argyle <https://www.theguardian.com/football/plymouthargyle> fought 
back from two goals down at Port Vale, leaving Brighton & Hove Albion unsure of 
their fourth-round opponents.

Vale led 2-0 at the interval courtesy of headed goals from Gavin Tomlin and 
Tom Pope but League Two Plymouth responded impressively against a team who play 
one division above them. Goals from Reuben Reid and Ben Purrington mean the 
sides face a replay for the right to host Brighton.

Plymouth came close to a dramatic injury-time winner when Lewis Alessandra's 
pass set up Andres Gurrieri for a shot that beat Vale's goalkeeper, Chris Neal, 
but came back off a post.
