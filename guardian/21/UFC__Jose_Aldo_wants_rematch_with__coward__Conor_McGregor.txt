13 seconds, wants another shot at the Irishman – because he lost his crown “by 
accident”.

The 30-year-old Brazilian said of McGregor: “It’s not my fault that he’s a 
coward. He was never the champion.”

The UFC announced over the weekend that McGregor was vacating the 
featherweight title 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/27/conor-mcgregor-gives-up-ufc-featherweight-title-jose-aldo>
 he won by beating Aldo in December, ending his spell as a two-division 
champion. McGregor never defended the belt, which means Aldo reclaims the title 
– but Aldo said he wouldn’t be satisfied without a rematch.

The Brazilian said: “I knew for certain that this would happen [McGregor 
giving up his belt]. In my opinion, I never stopped being the champion. I lost 
that fight because of an accident.”

Aldo, speaking in Portuguese, told UFC 
<http://www.ufc.com.br/news/nunca-deixei-ser-campao-jose-aldo>: “I knew that I 
would win a rematch and would become champion again. It’s not my fault that 
he’s a coward. He was never the champion. I don’t see myself losing to anyone 
in my weight class or any other one.”

McGregor remains the lightweight title holder. But Aldo said he is happy to 
move up to the 155lb class for a rematch.

“It’s logical that I give a lot of thought to that rematch, and it’s a 
certainty that it will happen,” he said. “But I want to defend my 
[featherweight] belt first. Then I can start preparing to face McGregor [at 
lightweight].”

Aldo defeated Frankie Edgar for the interim featherweight title at UFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 200 in July. Before he can get a 
rematch with McGregor, he will most likely fight Max Holloway or Anthony Pettis 
to unify the featherweight championship.

Holloway and Pettis square off at UFC 206 in Toronto on 10 December.
