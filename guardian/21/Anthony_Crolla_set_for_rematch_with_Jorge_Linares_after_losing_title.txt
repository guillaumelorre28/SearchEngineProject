 in Manchester on Saturday night.

The Venezuelan Linares produced a classy performance to see off the popular 
Mancunian boxer, and appeared to be in control throughout the fight despite 
being taken 12 rounds for the first time in his career.

Eddie Hearn, the promoter, revealed after the fight that a rematch had already 
been agreed for next year, and Crolla appeared to rule out a domestic fight 
against Terry Flanagan in favour of claiming back his title.

He told Sky Sports: “I think it will be Linares next year, in February/March. 
It was a tough old fight, I’ll have a little rest and then we’ll do it again. I 
think you saw last night, the attendance and the turnout was amazing and 
hopefully we’ll get something similar if not better after the fight that was 
put on last night.”

Crolla had brief moments of encouragement throughout, landing a right hand in 
the fifth that cut Linares’s right eye, but he suffered a crucial blow in the 
sixth as the challenger landed a big right to leave Crolla struggling.

That punch, Crolla admitted later, changed the course of the fight. “I thought 
I was in control and had him where I wanted him,” he said.

“I took that right hand and I felt that it gave him that feeling that he knew 
he could hurt me, and could do it again. That played a big part in the fight. I 
recovered and won the next round, but I think it was a big point in the fight.”

He added: “I took a very good shot and after that, I knew where I was and what 
I was doing but my legs were trying to tell me different.”
