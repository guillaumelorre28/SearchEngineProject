Given the history between Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> and Nate Diaz, it was little 
surprise that Wednesday’s press conference to promote their fight at UFC 202 
descended into unedifying chaos - once the Irishman had bothered to turn up.

McGregor was 30 minutes late for the press conference in Vegas, but didn’t 
seem too repentant when he arrived. “The Vegas traffic is heavy this time of 
the day,” he joked. “There must be a McGregor show going on because the place 
is packed out.”

McGregor’s tardiness appeared to irk the UFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> president, Dana White, but it was Diaz 
who was most angry: the Californian walked out shouting at his opponent as he 
went.

“Hey, fuck your whole team, how about that?” shouted Diaz.

“Fuck your whole team,” McGregor replied. “You’ll do nothing. Shut your 
fucking mouth. You’ll do nothing. You’ll do fucking nothing. Not one of you 
will do nothing. Get the fuck out of here.” Diaz appeared to throw a water 
bottle at the Irishman, with McGregor throwing some in return.

UFC was recently sold for $4bn

and the spectacle was hardly the image an organization moving further into the 
mainstream may want to present - although it will no doubt bring publicity to 
an event that has been overshadowed by this month’s Olympics. White, for his 
part, had had enough. “That’s a wrap. Get them out of here,” he said.

McGregor has previously clashed with UFC over media coverage and promotion. 
Earlier this year,he announced he would retire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/19/ufc-star-conor-mcgregor-i-have-decided-to-retire-young>
 after becoming angry at what he saw as excessive demands on his time around 
fight promotion. He has since been decided to return.

Diaz beat McGregor in a non-title fight at UFC 196 in March. The pair clashed 
before that fight too with security forced to break up trouble at a press 
conference.
