· Replace GCSEs, A-levels and vocational qualifications with a new single 
diploma over 10-year period of reform.

· Slash the number of exams pupils have to take.

· Replace all coursework with a single extended project. Some hands-on 
courses, such as art and design, would still have project-based work, but this 
would be done in school - rather than independently - to reduce cheating. 
Cheats would also be weeded out when they had to sit an oral exam.

· The diploma would come at four levels: entry (equivalent to pre-GCSEs), 
foundation (GCSEs at grade D-G), intermediate (GCSE A*-C) and advanced 
(A-level).

· Students would be able to progress at their own rate, paving the way for 
mixed-aged classes.

· Advanced-level students would be able to sit extra hard questions to get 
even higher marks than are currently available under the A-level system to add 
extra "stretch". These would be introduced to A-levels as A-plus and A-double 
plus before the diploma was introduced.

· The diploma would be made up of the modules, which would be adapted from the 
existing A-level and GCSE modules.

· Students could pick their own combination (open diploma) or opt for one of 
the 20 pre-designed combinations (specialised diploma). This should give 
stronger and more respected vocational qualifications.

· Introduce a new "core" which all pupils would have to do to pass the 
diploma, made up of: "functional" - maths, ICT and communication skills, an 
extended essay, and "wider activities" - work experience, paid jobs, voluntary 
work and family responsibilities.

· "Graduates" of the diploma would be given a transcript of their 
achievements, including a breakdown of individual module marks, which would be 
available to employers and universities online.
