Veteran back-rower Sam Thaiday will undergo surgery in London on Tuesday after 
fracturing his cheekbone and eye socket during Australia’s win over England.

Thaiday, sustained the injury in a collision with England prop James Graham in 
the second half of the 38-16 win at the London Stadium and immediately left the 
field.

The Queensland and Brisbane NRL star will miss Sunday’s final against New 
Zealand at Anfield and becomes the second player in the Kangaroos squad to 
suffer a tournament-ending injury.

Josh Mansour was finally able to fly home last week after sustaining torn 
anterior cruciate ligaments during a training collision with Josh Dugan at 
Burton a fortnight ago.

Thaiday, 31, will rejoin the squad in Liverpool later this week and it is 
hoped he will be passed to fit fly back to Australia next Monday (Tuesday AEDT) 
when the team returns home after almost six weeks in the UK.

The head of Canterbury skipper Graham also inflicted a similar injury to his 
England teammate Sam Burgess during the 2014 NRL grand final.

Thaiday has come off the interchange bench in every game of the tournament and 
his spot is likely to be taken by either Shannon Boyd or young Manly back-rower 
Jake Trbojevic.
