hopes the non-Labour parties refuse to back down.

This tweet, from April last year, is being cited as evidence that Plaid has 
broken a promise not to do a deal with the Tories.
Plaid Cymru (@Plaid_Cymru) 
.@LeanneWood <https://twitter.com/LeanneWood>: Plaid Cymru would not do any 
deal that would prop up another Conservative government. Wales has never given 
Tories a mandate
 <https://twitter.com/Plaid_Cymru/status/593896647781969920> April 30, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/Plaid_Cymru/status/593896647781969920> 
But this is about Plaid propping up a Tory government. Today the Tories were 
voting for Plaid’s Leanne Wood to head a Plaid-led coalition, which is not 
quite the same thing.

Labour claims Plaid can no longer claim to be progressive party

Labour politicians are furious with Plaid Cymru

longer claim to be a progressive party. Here is some Twitter reaction from MPs

Welsh secretary

Wonder what people in the Rhondda will think of @LeanneWood

Labour Government? I think it stinks.

Tories and UKIP.

where Plaid’s Leanne Wood is the AM
Chris Bryant MP (@RhonddaBryant) 
The idea that @LeanneWood <https://twitter.com/LeanneWood> does a sordid deal 
with Tories and UKIP for her own career just stinks.

Statement from Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives

Here is the statement from Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives.

Last week less than 16% of voters backed the status quo and another five years 
ofLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

Having seen their share of the vote drop by 8%, many voters across Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> moved away from Labour last week and, 
crucially, the party did not win a majority at the 2016 election.

As such, Labour had no divine right to assume the first membership today.

It is for new assembly members to explore, and discuss, the best way forward 
for the Welsh nation, which has for too long fallen behind the rest of the UK.

Certainly, I sense an appetite for a new kind of collaborative Welsh politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/wales>, and would welcome further 
discussions to build on those which led to today’s vote.

Our ambitous manifesto was packed full of ideas we believe could make a 
difference to people across the country.

As we analyse the impact of the new election results on Wales, Welsh 
Conservatives remain steadfastly committed to delivering for communities across 
the country.

Under the Welsh assembly’s rules, if it has not elected a first minister 
within 28 days of the election, there has to be another one.

This is from the Welsh election study’s Roger Scully.
Roger Scully (@roger_scully) 
Various people have said kind things about the election coverage last week. 
But none said they liked it so much they wanted another election

Kirsty Williams, the one Lib Dem member of the assembly, backed Labour’s 
Carwyn Jones <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/carwyn-jones> for first 
minister. This is what she said afterwards.

I was not re-elected into the national assembly to support a ragtag coalition 
made up of Ukip assembly aembers who at the moment can’t even agree with each 
other. That is not my politics and not something I will even contemplate.

I am disappointed that Plaid seem to think that is a viable option. The 
reality that we have to face is thatLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> have 29 assembly members.

It is therefore clear that they have the strongest mandate from the people of 
Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>.

For the record, here are the numbers in the Welsh assembly after last week’s 
elections. There are 60 AMs (assembly members).

Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> - 29

Plaid Cymru <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/plaid-cymru> - 12

Conservatives - 11

Ukip - 7

Lib Dems - 1

UPDATE: Plaid’s Elin Jones was elected presiding officer earlier today. 
Labour’s Ann Jones was elected deputy presiding officer. They do not vote, 
which is why today’s votes were tied 29/29.

Plaid blames Labour for refusing to negotiate

Here is the statement from Plaid Cyrmu on today’s developments in the Welsh 
assembly.

On May 5th, Wales chose not to elect one single party to govern Wales with a 
majority. As is the convention, the biggest party were given an opportunity to 
reach an agreement on forming a government which could leadWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> with the support of the majority of 
members in the national assembly. They took the decision not to pursue that 
option, and were not prepared to give the process of negotiation any further 
time.

As a result, the Plaid Cymru group followed normal parliamentary protocol and 
nominated Leanne Wood for first minister.Carwyn Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/carwyn-jones> was informed of this 
decision yesterday. Since that time, and as far as Plaid Cymru is aware, there 
have been no formal discussions, agreements or deals pursued between any party.

This afternoon, the assembly failed to reach agreement on who should become 
first minister and form the next government. It is now for the parties to 
discuss this matter further in order to seek the best outcome for Wales.

Andrew Tyrie goes next.

Osborne says he thinks the economy can be as strong as it is today with net 
migration below 100,000.

He says if you bring the right migrants in, the economy can be as strong with 
fewer people.

Plaid, Tories and Ukip unite to block Carwyn Jones's re-election as Welsh 
first minister

Turning away from the committee for a moment, in Wales Plaid Cymru, the 
Tories, and Ukip have united to block Labour’s Carwyn Jones being re-appointed 
as first minister. They tried to get Plaid’s leader Leanne Wood elected, but 
that was blocked too.As the BBC reports 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-36269820> currently there is a 
stalemate, and the Welsh assembly does not have a first minister.

For no other reason Leanne, Andrew RT, Neil - stand firm.

This tweet, from April last year, is being cited as evidence that Plaid has 
broken a promise not to do a deal with the Tories.
Plaid Cymru (@Plaid_Cymru) 
.@LeanneWood <https://twitter.com/LeanneWood>: Plaid Cymru would not do any 
deal that would prop up another Conservative government. Wales has never given 
Tories a mandate

But this is about Plaid propping up a Tory government. Today the Tories were 
voting for Plaid’s Leanne Wood to head a Plaid-led coalition, which is not 
quite the same thing.
 
Labour politicians are furious with Plaid Cymru

Here is the statement from Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives.

Last week less than 16% of voters backed the status quo and another five years 
ofLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

Having seen their share of the vote drop by 8%, many voters across Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> moved away from Labour last week and, 
crucially, the party did not win a majority at the 2016 election.

As such, Labour had no divine right to assume the first membership today.

It is for new assembly members to explore, and discuss, the best way forward 
for the Welsh nation, which has for too long fallen behind the rest of the UK.

Certainly, I sense an appetite for a new kind of collaborative Welsh politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/wales>, and would welcome further 
discussions to build on those which led to today’s vote.

Our ambitous manifesto was packed full of ideas we believe could make a 
difference to people across the country.

As we analyse the impact of the new election results on Wales, Welsh 
Conservatives remain steadfastly committed to delivering for communities across 
the country.

Since it is hard to read in this form, I will post the quotes separately in a 
moment.
 
Under the Welsh assembly’s rules, if it has not elected a first minister 
within 28 days of the election, there has to be another one.

This is from the Welsh election study’s Roger Scully.
Roger Scully (@roger_scully) 
Various people have said kind things about the election coverage last week. 
But none said they liked it so much they wanted another election

<https://twitter.com/roger_scully/status/730414358241681408>  
Kirsty Williams, the one Lib Dem member of the assembly, backed Labour’s 
Carwyn Jones <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/carwyn-jones> for first 
minister. This is what she said afterwards.

I was not re-elected into the national assembly to support a ragtag coalition 
made up of Ukip assembly aembers who at the moment can’t even agree with each 
other. That is not my politics and not something I will even contemplate.

I am disappointed that Plaid seem to think that is a viable option. The 
reality that we have to face is thatLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> have 29 assembly members.

It is therefore clear that they have the strongest mandate from the people of 
Wales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>.

For the record, here are the numbers in the Welsh assembly after last week’s 
elections. There are 60 AMs (assembly members).

Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> - 29

Plaid Cymru <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/plaid-cymru> - 12

Conservatives - 11

Ukip - 7

Lib Dems - 1

UPDATE: Plaid’s Elin Jones was elected presiding officer earlier today. 
Labour’s Ann Jones was elected deputy presiding officer. They do not vote, 
which is why today’s votes were tied 29/29.
 
Here is the statement from Plaid Cyrmu on today’s developments in the Welsh 
assembly.

On May 5th, Wales chose not to elect one single party to govern Wales with a 
majority. As is the convention, the biggest party were given an opportunity to 
reach an agreement on forming a government which could leadWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> with the support of the majority of 
members in the national assembly. They took the decision not to pursue that 
option, and were not prepared to give the process of negotiation any further 
time.

As a result, the Plaid Cymru group followed normal parliamentary protocol and 
nominated Leanne Wood for first minister.Carwyn Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/carwyn-jones> was informed of this 
decision yesterday. Since that time, and as far as Plaid Cymru is aware, there 
have been no formal discussions, agreements or deals pursued between any party.

This afternoon, the assembly failed to reach agreement on who should become 
first minister and form the next government. It is now for the parties to 
discuss this matter further in order to seek the best outcome for Wales.

Andrew Tyrie goes next.

Osborne says he thinks the economy can be as strong as it is today with net 
migration below 100,000.

He says if you bring the right migrants in, the economy can be as strong with 
fewer people.
 
Turning away from the committee for a moment, in Wales Plaid Cymru, the 
Tories, and Ukip have united to block Labour’s Carwyn Jones being re-appointed 
as first minister. They tried to get Plaid’s leader Leanne Wood elected, but 
that was blocked too.As the BBC reports 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-36269820> currently there is a 
stalemate, and the Welsh assembly does not have a first minister.
