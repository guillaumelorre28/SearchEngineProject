“Delighted to have signed for @s04 new chapter, new beginnings,” tweeted 
Bentaleb <https://twitter.com/nabilbentaleb42/status/768751140418777088> after 
the move had been confirmed.

The Algerian was a regular starter for Spurs during the 2014-15 campaign and 
signed a new five-year deal last season. But Bentaleb has found himself 
training exclusively with the club’s Under-21s during the summer after Mauricio 
Pochettino decided he was not part of future first-team plans.

“If you are not part of my plans, why are you training with us? He understands 
very well, like any other player. It is not a big issue, not a problem,” said 
the manager. “Sometimes it looks like a big, big issue, but it is very normal 
in football.”

The 21-year-old made 66 appearances for Tottenham after joining the club’s 
academy in January 2012 but started only twice in the league last season.
