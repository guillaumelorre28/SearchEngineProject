Thomas Müller scored a disputed last-minute penalty for Bayern Munich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> as they beat Augsburg 2-1 
and maintained their 100% start to the season.

Alexander Esswein stunned Bayern when he struck for Augsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> two minutes before the break 
but Robert Lewandowski equalised in the 77th and Müller made no mistake from 
the spot after Markus Feulner was adjudged to have fouled Douglas Costa.

Video replays showed it was a soft decision with the Bayern player running 
into Feulner and then falling. “I don’t like to win like that,” the Bayern 
coach Pep Guardiola said.

The Bayern players took to the field holding hands with children on either 
side, a migrant youngster on one side, in what the club said was “a symbol for 
the integration of refugees” and the home side dominated possession but 
struggled to make leeway early on.

Müller twice went close before Marwin Hitz made a great save to deny Thiago 
Alcântara. Esswein struck for Augsburg with what was the visitors’ only shot on 
target. They had four shots altogether, compared to 27 for Bayern.

Guardiola brought the France Under-21s winger Kingsley Coman on for his 
Bundesliga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> debut in 
the second half but the 19-year-old who claimed on Thursday he could “make the 
difference in every minute” failed to back up his words.

Bayern increased the pace and Lewandowski finally made the breakthrough when 
he stabbed home from close range after Hitz blocked Müller’s initial effort. 
The German international made sure after Costa’s late fall that Bayern kept 
pace with Dortmund at the top.
