I see that Alex Thomson 
<http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2016/12/12/vendee-globe-center-low/>, who is 
sailing solo around the world in theVendée Globe 
<http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/> race, has taken all of Bernard Cornwell’s 
Sharpe novels <http://www.bernardcornwell.net/about-the-sharpe-books/> on his 
Kindle. What other books would readers pack for the three-month, 26,000-mile 
race?
