2) Jermaine Beckford and Eoin Doyle’s in-house dust-up 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUuGANG2Ic0> last weekend joined a long list 
of team-mate set-tos, led by the ripped-shirt 2005 genre definer,Dyer versus 
Bowyer <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GclRO0NcBk>. Other big moments of team 
spirit spilling over: Placido de Castro team-matesFabio Junior and Uilian 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfWQbtwhUeA> going at it in 2015; Grobbelaar v 
McManaman <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFqYv27kHc8> in 1993; Batty v Le Saux

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wxy4xNnA3Y> in 2008, as described by Mark 
Lawrenson: “It’s a case of plenty of slap and no tickle.”

3) Stronger stuff here. After last month’s David Haye v Tony Bellew 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/nov/30/david-haye-tony-bellew-press-conference-boxing-video>
 press conference stage-fight and this week’sDillian Whyte v Dereck Chisora 
<https://twitter.com/SheldanKeay/status/806495834548346880> PR-savvy 
table-tossing, some more classic set pieces:Danny Williams versus Audley 
Harrison <https://youtu.be/7CA2ah6FoBM?t=1m11s> in 2006; Riddick Bowe versus 
Larry Donald <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5LxagKJ1PA> in 1994; and Mike 
Tyson v Lennox Lewis <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N1gloofI1o> in 2002. 
Among other out-of-the-ring confrontations worth a watch: Trevor Berbick and 
Larry Holmes taking their rowoutside on to the street 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zlQqSCzRrA> in 1991; and some slow-burn 
wrestling: Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazierget physical 
<https://youtu.be/0-u_Q3eVYU0?t=1m30s> in the ABC Wide World Of Sports studio 
in 1974.

4) “I just come over here to win the tournament, we done that, I’m player of 
the tournament on top, it’s just brilliant.” Great stuff fromjunior Joe Cole 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOvryIk9jVM>, in action for West Ham in the 
1991 Dale Farm Milk Cup. And here’s more Milk Cup vintage footage:Beckham,

Town,still has a few tricks up his sleeve 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYpGNuaDs1E>. Plus more highlights from the 
week in football: a barely believablegoal-line miss in Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/dec/07/striker-thwarted-by-defender-on-goal-line-in-greek-football-match-video>
, a65-yard volley in Chile

Fabricio to tears <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72D-o-FBfAM>.

6) And here’s Oakland Raiders kicker and fan favourite Marquette King earning 
a penalty,doing a dance with the penalty flag 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eDRjT7JWeM> and conceding a penalty.

Highlights from last week’s blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/01/del-potros-tweener-rabona-of-the-week-and-managers-making-it-up>

2) Isaiah Thomas scores with an outrageous trick shot 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0b7zpM9cWM&feature=youtu.be>... after the 
whistle blows. It’s beena rough week 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybuu5dCjvJE> for Boston Celtics fans.

3) Toulouse manager Pascal Dupraz’s reaction to being brushed by a paper plane 
was bad enough; now compare it to Washington Capitals coach Barry Trotz after 
beingstruck by an ice hockey puck <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKrU6_yOoD8>.

4) Enjoy Bristol City v Wolves in ITV’s 1976 show All in the Game
