More than 2 million people had to wait more than four hours at A&E units last 
year, a sharp rise on the previous year, officialNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> figures have shown.

The latest annual data from NHS Digital shows that more people than ever 
before were treated at an accident and emergency unit in England last year – 
the first time the figure has risen above 20m – which suggests shortstaffed 
units are under increased pressure.

In 2015-16, 20,457,805 people attended either an emergency department at an 
acute hospital or an urgent care centre or walk-in centre. That was about 
900,000, or 4.6%, more than the previous year.

The NHS experienced a surge in demand last winter, similar to the one this 
year which has prompted widespread claims from medical groups that the service 
is in crisis.

While A&E attendances between April and December 2015 rose by just 2.2% to 
15.2m, compared with the same period a year earlier, they shot up by 12.2% 
between January and March 2016 to 5.2m, again compared with the same quarter in 
2015.

More patients are waiting longer before they leave A&E. In 2015-16 a total of 
2,090,200 people were not dealt with for at least four hours and one minute, 
well up on the 1,638,058 seen the year before. Last year, 5.2 million people 
waited between three and four hours for care, up from the 2.4 million who did 
so in 2007-08, and the 4.9 million who did so in 2014-15.

The figures, which underline the relentless and ongoing increase in demand for 
A&E care, come a day after the health secretary sparked a huge political row by 
vowing towater down the NHS’s commitment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/09/labour-party-jeremy-hunt-nhs-waiting-time>
 to treat and then admit, transfer or discharge 95% of patients within four 
hours of their arrival.

Jeremy Hunt told MPs: “This government is committed to maintaining and 
delivering that vital four-hour commitment to patients. But since it was 
announced in 2000 there are nearly 9m more visits to our A&Es, up to 30% of 
whom NHS England estimate do not need to be there. And the tide is continuing 
to rise.


“So, if we are to protect our four-hour standard, we need to be clear it is a 
promise to sort out all urgent health problems within four hours, but not all 
health problems, however minor.”

Labour and the Liberal Democrats said Hunt was letting down patients by saying 
that the four-hour pledge – which has existed since 2004 though initially with 
a target of 98% – should not apply to the 30% of people who attend A&E with a 
minor ailment.

Theresa May’s spokeswoman insisted on Tuesday that Hunt had made no change to 
the four-hour pledge when he addressed MPs.


“The point that the health secretary was making in the house yesterday is a 
point that the government has made before, which is about making sure that A&E 
is there for people for what it says on the tin – accident and emergency. It’s 
not about non-urgent care,” she said when asked if Hunt had weakened the target.

There was, the spokeswoman said, “more to be done to make sure that the public 
understand” when they should go to A&E departments. Hunt had briefed the 
cabinet on Tuesday about the pressures facing A&E, she added.

“The target is a target for accident and emergency,” she said. “I understand 
what accident and emergency should be about. If I have a cold, I’m not going to 
go to accident and emergency and expect to be treated for a cold within four 
hours.”


Asked whether the four-hour target originally featured this distinction, she 
said: “There’s a commitment that accident and emergency is for emergency care.”

NHS organisations say inadequate GP and social care services outside 
hospitals, including sometimes long waits to see a family doctor, are prompting 
more and more people to use A&E.

Growing numbers of patients who arrive at hospital through A&E are having to 
be admitted as a medical emergency, with 4.1m such cases last year. But that 
remains about one in five of all attenders, and not a growing proportion, 
despite the growing numbers of older people and the often complex medical 
conditions with which they present.

Four million (19.8%) other patients were discharged to be followed up by their 
GP, and 2.6m (12.7%) were referred to a specialist clinic or outpatients 
department, NHS Digital’s data shows.

NHS England also produces data on A&E activity. While it covers every type-one 
unit, urgent care centre and walk-in centre in England, NHS Digital’s figures 
are based on just 87% of such places, though they do include every hospital 
emergency department.

“This report confirms what we have been saying, that hospitals are coming 
under increasing pressure but in the main are continuing to cope,” said a 
spokesman for NHS England.

“In fact, these figures show that last year the median time to assessment was 
11 minutes and, on average, patients left A&E just two hours and 40 minutes 
after arriving. This shows the fantastic job staff are doing in ensuring 
patients get the urgent care they need.”

NHS England repeated its plea to the 30% of people believed to be turning up 
at A&E unnecessarily to seek care elsewhere, such as with a GP, pharmacist or 
NHS111.
