The Screen Actors Guild has announced its award nominations, a key indicator 
of who will be in favour when theOscars

Manchester by the Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/manchester-by-the-sea-review-kenneth-lonergans-morose-echo-of-margaret>
 is leading the film nomination list with four nods: Casey Affleck (best male 
actor), Lucas Hedges (best male supporting), Michelle Williams (best female 
supporting) and best ensemble. Both the leads ofLa La Land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone>
, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, were nominated, as were Natalie Portman and 
Denzel Washington forJackie

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/10/manchester-by-the-sea-clip-kenneth-lonergan-casey-affleck-video>
However, there were one or two surprise inclusions: Emily Blunt was handed a 
best female actor nod forThe Girl on the Train 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/09/the-girl-on-the-train-review-emily-blunt-paula-hawkins>
, while Viggo Mortensen added to his unheralded Golden Globes nomination by 
receiving another here, for best male actor in Captain Fantastic. Having been 
handed a best actor (comedy/musical) nomination by the Globes, Hugh Grant was 
given a best supporting nomination by SAG for his role inFlorence Foster Jenkins
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/13/florence-foster-jenkins-review-meryl-streep-hugh-grant-stephen-frears>
.

Conversely, Martin Scorsese’s clerical passion project Silence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/10/silence-review-the-last-temptation-of-liam-neeson-in-scorseses-shattering-epic>
 found itself excluded again (though star Andrew Garfield was nominated for
Hacksaw Ridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/04/hacksaw-ridge-review-mel-gibson-finds-a-conscience-in-gruesome-war-story>
) – but rather more surprisingly, so was interracial-marriage dramaLoving 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/loving-review-civil-rights-tale-marries-heartfelt-drama-with-too-much-restraint>
, whose two leads, Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton, each received Golden Globe 
nods.

In the TV nominations, three series each received three nods: Stranger Things 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/15/stranger-things-review-a-shot-of-80s-nostalgia-right-to-your-heart-winona-ryder>
,The People v OJ Simpson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/the-people-v-oj-simpson-episode-by-episode>
 andWestworld <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld>. The People 
v OJ Simpson is perhaps the most eye-catching, with three lead actors 
nominated: Sterling K Brown, Courtney B Vance and Sarah Paulson.

The Screen Actors Guild award winners will be announced on 29 January 2017.
