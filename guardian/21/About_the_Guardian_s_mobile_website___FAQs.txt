In November 2012 we redesigned our mobile website from the ground up to 
radically improve the user experience, reliability and download speeds. Usage 
of mobiles and tablets to browse the web is increasing fast and we want to 
ensure you have the best possible experience when looking at the Guardian on a 
tablet or mobile.

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions:

How do I give feedback?
The best way to leave feedback is via the link at the foot of every page. Or 
send us a tweet@guardianmobile <http://www.twitter.com/guardianmobile>. You can 
also emailuserhelp@theguardian.com <mailto:userhelp@theguardian.com>.

Is the site just for mobile phones?
The site is designed to be responsive and is currently optimised for mobiles 
and small tablets. We've specifically designed for devices up to 7" and will 
continue to evolve the design for larger screens. Our framework will allow us 
to easily scale up to large desktop screens - but we have some design 
challenges to work on before we get there.

You can also download our apps for iPhone

What has happened to bookmarks and favourites?
We were not able to redirect all pages from the old mobile site because of the 
way the links were structured. If you find yourself on an empty page, we have 
added links to the most popular sections on the new site to try and help you 
find what you are looking for.

We are not currently offering on-site tools to save pages as favourites, but 
will monitor user feedback on this. For now, please use your device browser to 
save pages as bookmarks. You can also expand or hide the home page sections 
depending on your interests.

Are any sections missing?
You should find all sections that are currently on the desktop site - tap or 
click on the menu button in the top right corner of the home page. A list of 
the main sections will appear, if you don't find what you are looking for, 
select "All sections" to see the full list.

If you are looking for a section that appears in the Guardian or Observer 
newspaper, the articles will be listed in their relevant section, eg Film or 
Fashion, rather than "The Guide" or "Weekend magazine".

Can I personalise the homepage?
You can currently choose to hide a section that doesn't interest you. If you 
accept cookies in your phone browser's settings, this preference will be stored 
for you when you visit again.

What if I would rather view the desktop site on my smartphone or tablet?
We currently redirect users accessing us on mobile phones and tablets up to 7" 
to the mobile optimised site. If you would rather view the desktop site, simply 
tap or click on "Desktop version" at the bottom of the page. If you would like 
us to remember this preference, please ensure your device browser is set to 
accept cookies, then visit the mobile site home page and tap or click on 
"desktop version".

What about sharing articles from the site via social media?
You can share a page on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ using the "share" 
buttons. You can also share a page via email, SMS and any social media channels 
to which you are subscribed, using the "share" tools built in to your phone or 
device. We are monitoring demand for additional "share" buttons.
