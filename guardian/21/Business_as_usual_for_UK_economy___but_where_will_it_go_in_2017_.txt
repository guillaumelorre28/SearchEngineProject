So far, so good. That sums up the performance of the UK economy in the first 
three months after theBrexit  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>referendum in June.

In normal times, a quarterly growth rate of 0.6% would be wholly unexceptional 
for Britain and hardly worthy of comment. The economy has tended to expand by 
about 2.0% to 2.5% a year, so 0.6% over three months is about par for the 
course.

These, though, were not normal times. The expectation of the Bank of England

was that a vote to leave the EU would result in instant economic carnage. 
Threadneedle Street predicted that the economy would barely grow in the third 
quarter. George Osborne talked about a year-long DIY recession.

As it happens, the economy grew at precisely the same rate in the third 
quarter as in the second quarter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/23/uk-gdp-growth-brexit-industrial-services-construction-wages>
. Not only was there no recession, there was no slowdown either.

By and large it was business as usual, with the economy displaying all its 
traditional strengths and weaknesses. Consumers carried on spending as if 
nothing had happened and imports were sucked in as a result, leading to a 
deterioration in the balance of payments. Manufacturing performed badly but 
financial and business services did well. In the circumstances, the small rise 
in business investment was both surprising and encouraging.

The signs are that the final three months of 2016 will see more of the same. 
Retail sales have remained strong, the service sector continues to expand while 
industry struggles. Between 2015 and 2016 the economy will grow by about 2%.

A number of conclusions can be drawn from this data. One is that the economy 
would probably have grown even faster had it not been for the referendum. 
Instead of cutting interest rates, the Bank would probably have raised them by 
now.

A second is that there is no guarantee that the solid performance in the 
second half of the year will continue. Inflation is poised to rise sharply 
early in 2017 and that will lead to a slowdown in consumer spending.

Finally, any satisfaction to be gleaned from the economy outperforming the 
expectations of the IMF, the Treasury et al has to be tempered by the fact that 
the UK is still running a quarterly balance of payments deficit of 5% of gross 
domestic product. That’s far too high for comfort.
