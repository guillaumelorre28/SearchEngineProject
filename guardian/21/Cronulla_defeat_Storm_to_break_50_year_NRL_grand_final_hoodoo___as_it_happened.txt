That’s 2016 done and dusted, folks. The Sharks are premiers. It’ll take a 
while to get used to the sound of that.

Thanks for your eyeballs. They were round. Cheerio and good night.

Here’s Sam Perry’s match report:

And now Gallen takes to the stage. He polarises opinion, for good reason, but 
you can’t say he hasn’t given his all for his club. And they love him for it.

Gallen signed for the Sharks in 1999. Seventeen years later he made his first 
grand final. And made the most of it. Good things come to those who wait.

Gallen congratulates “Cameron” and the “terrific Storm” side, one that “just 
kept coming”. “To our boys, our coaching staff, thanks for the year. To all the 
boys, we’ve played for each other all year. To all you fan, you’ve waited 50 
years for this! For all you former players, blokes like ET, guys who busted 
their backsides for the club and never got to enjoy a moment like this, I hope 
you enjoy it. To all you people back in the Shire, turn your porch lights off 
cause we’re coming home with the trophy!”

Gallen hoists the trophy, his teammates pile in, and confetti rains from the 
sky. The drought has well and truly broken.

The Sharks players come up one by one to accept their winners’ medals and the 
overwhelming contingent of Sharks supporters —who haven’t left early to beat 
the traffic— give each one a mighty roar.

And here’s Matt Prior, a journeyman forward who is now a dual premiership 
winner (having won one with the Dragons in 2010). More premierships than Matt 
Rogers has Matt Prior. Sport does your head in sometimes.

Sharks coach Shane Flanagan takes the stage where he’s embraced by Andrew 
Ettingshausen and congratulated byNRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> 
CEO Todd Greenberg. “Premiership winning coach!” the announcer says and 
Flanagan can’t help but pump his fists. Could he ever have envisaged this 
moment in 2014 when he was suspended from club duties after the much talked 
about supplements scandal that all but tore Cronulla in two? It’s incredible 
that he is here now, on this stage, alongside his premiership-winning team.

Cameron Smith is called to the dais and a few boos ring out, but they seem to 
be drowned out by applause. He starts by congratulating the Sharks. He must be 
very disappointed. His team won the minor premiership and, their defence aside, 
they never really clicked in this game. But still they could have won it which 
speaks volumes.

Sharks captain Paul Gallen, now a bonafide Cronulla immortal, is lifted from 
the ground by Andrew Johns. He has tears in his eyes. “I can’t tell you how 
proud I am of these blokes,” he says, choking back sobs. “What they did 
tonight! Oh my God! They’re the best blokes. So good. I can believe it because 
of the hard work we’ve put in but to do this! I’m so happy, I’m so proud.”

Michael Ennis has a go but is barely coherent: “I thought we were ‘gorn’ when 
Chambers scored. But Fifita, Fifita! I can’t believe it! We created a heap of 
chances. The Storm are champions, they just recover, recover, recover.”

Some classy words from the losing captain, Cameron Smith: “I think everyone 
that follows rugby league has to be happy for the Sharks. They’ve waited a long 
time for this. It would have been nice to win tonight and it won’t take away 
the bitter disappointment we all feel, but I’m happy for the Sharks and all of 
their fans that they get a premiership.”

Fulltime: Melbourne 12-14 Cronulla

The crowd have gone Herbie Goes Bananas while Ennis, Gallen, Lewis and Co. 
bawl and whoop and holler. After 50 years Cronulla finally have something to 
put in their trophy cabinet. “Up, Up, Cronulla” reverberates around the stadium!

Credit to the Storm. What a defensive effort, what spirit to not just stay in 
the game but hit the lead.

79 min: Oh my goodness, what a final minute! The Storm work their way 70m down 
field, Koroibete and Vunivalu making huge inroads. The refuse to be tackled. 
It’s offload after offload and they wind ever closer to the Sharks’ line. Just 
when they appear to be through the line closes. And finally, it finds Koroibete 
who races over the 10m line after the hooter sounds...

78 min: Chambers is running out but he kicks inside for himself and regathers. 
He takes the tackle but missed Cronk unmarked on his inside! Cronk would have 
scored. The Storm then shift it left and play hot potato, but they can’t 
fashion a break. So it’s a grubber but it runs dead!

Maloney down before he gets a kick away. But the Storm are on their own 10m

75 min: An ordinary Storm set ends in an ordinary Cronk kick. But the Sharks 
allow it to bounce and it bounces into the in-goal, past Barba who is beaten by 
the leg break. But he recovers to bat the ball dead ahead of Chambers!

73 min: The Storm go the short side inside the Sharks’ 20m but Cronk’s kick is 
caught beautifully by Bird. Mark Waugh would have been pleased with that.

Moments later, however, Maloney kicks out on the full. His only false step all 
night. Melbourne to come again.

Conversion! Melbourne 12-14 Cronulla (Maloney)

He doesn’t miss and the Sharks have poked their noses in front. Ten minutes 
between them and their first premiership. Can they do it?

Yes, it’s a try all right, and the Sharks will go ahead unless Maloney misses

70 min: Possible try to Fifita!

Ennis finds Fifita on the charge and he manages to keep the ball in one mitt 
amid four tacklers. He spins, he drives, he reaches out and seems to have 
planted the ball cleanly!

67 min: The Storm won this year’s minor premiership on the back of their 
defence, one that conceded a mere 12.5 points a game. Could that same defence 
be about to win them their third premiership crown?

Not yet. Penalty to Cronulla for holding down and Townsend kicks for touch. 
Cronulla to begin a set on the Storm’s 40m.

Try! Melbourne 10-8 Cronulla (Chambers 65)

And the Storm are ahead for the first time tonight! From 20m out, in midfield, 
Cronk passes right to Hampton to Chambers and, after taking a bump from Beale, 
Chambers recalibrates and continues running, slicing through two tacklers to 
dive over!

63 min: This will help the Storm. Townsend, looking for touch, I think, 
grubbers the ball dead from 35m. As good as the Storm’s defence has been, the 
Sharks’ attack has looked, dare I say, a little toothless.

61 min: Barba weaves dangerously and gets the Sharks on the attack again. On 
the last Maloney goes left with a cut-out to Leutele but Vunivalu cleans up a 
short kick and the Storm survive another Shark attack.

59 min: Cheyse Blair catches a Maloney kick centimetres inside the field of 
play and Luke Lewis drags him to ground in the in-goal. Another Storm drop-out, 
but another Sharks set where they didn’t really look like breaking the Storm 
line.

57 min: Making the most of their seven tackles (due to Smith kicking dead) the 
Sharks run it deep and the Storm can only knock on a Maloney cross-field kick 
close to their own line.

55 min: The Storm are gathering momentum now, making good metres in attack. On 
the last, from midfield and 20m out, Cameron Smith picks up from dummy half and 
kicks the ball dead with no Storm player in sight. That’s the kind of boo-boo 
Smith doesn’t tend to make.

54 min: Barba flies high to take a Cronk kick on his own 20m. He, Feki and 
Holmes have been wonderful tonight.

Play is stopped as Bukuya is being treated for a head knock, the result of an 
awkward attempt at tackling Proctor. He’s going off and won’t be off, allowing 
Tagataese to get on the park.

What a boost that try will be for Melbourne. Smashed all game and now, after

50 min: A McLean charge is halted centimetres from the line. From the 
play-the-ball Jesse Bromwich hits it up, spins at the line, and appears to get 
the ball down in traffic!

48 min: An awful grubber from Townsend, intended for his outside backs, gifts 
the ball to a relieved Storm on their 20m. Hmm. The Sharks aren’t applying the 
killer touch just yet. Will they? And now another penalty to the Storm.

46 min: And though the Storm do get deep into Sharks’ territory two poor kicks 
by Cronk don’t help matters for the men in purple. He’s been unusually 
ineffective tonight, Cronk, though the Sharks are applying a lot of pressure 
when he gets the ball.

44 min: The Sharks aren’t trying anything too expansive —though perhaps they 
should be by now. Another of their sets —this one ended with a poor Ennis kick— 
is foiled by more excellent Storm defence.

And here’s penalty to the Storm to give them a fast track out of their own 
half.

That’s 2016 done and dusted, folks. The Sharks are premiers. It’ll take a 
while to get used to the sound of that.

Thanks for your eyeballs. They were round. Cheerio and good night.

Here’s Sam Perry’s match report:

And now Gallen takes to the stage. He polarises opinion, for good reason, but 
you can’t say he hasn’t given his all for his club. And they love him for it.

Gallen signed for the Sharks in 1999. Seventeen years later he made his first 
grand final. And made the most of it. Good things come to those who wait.

Gallen congratulates “Cameron” and the “terrific Storm” side, one that “just 
kept coming”. “To our boys, our coaching staff, thanks for the year. To all the 
boys, we’ve played for each other all year. To all you fan, you’ve waited 50 
years for this! For all you former players, blokes like ET, guys who busted 
their backsides for the club and never got to enjoy a moment like this, I hope 
you enjoy it. To all you people back in the Shire, turn your porch lights off 
cause we’re coming home with the trophy!”

Gallen hoists the trophy, his teammates pile in, and confetti rains from the 
sky. The drought has well and truly broken.

The Sharks players come up one by one to accept their winners’ medals and the 
overwhelming contingent of Sharks supporters —who haven’t left early to beat 
the traffic— give each one a mighty roar.

And here’s Matt Prior, a journeyman forward who is now a dual premiership 
winner (having won one with the Dragons in 2010). More premierships than Matt 
Rogers has Matt Prior. Sport does your head in sometimes.
 
Sharks coach Shane Flanagan takes the stage where he’s embraced by Andrew 
Ettingshausen and congratulated byNRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> 
CEO Todd Greenberg. “Premiership winning coach!” the announcer says and 
Flanagan can’t help but pump his fists. Could he ever have envisaged this 
moment in 2014 when he was suspended from club duties after the much talked 
about supplements scandal that all but tore Cronulla in two? It’s incredible 
that he is here now, on this stage, alongside his premiership-winning team.
 
Cameron Smith is called to the dais and a few boos ring out, but they seem to 
be drowned out by applause. He starts by congratulating the Sharks. He must be 
very disappointed. His team won the minor premiership and, their defence aside, 
they never really clicked in this game. But still they could have won it which 
speaks volumes.
 
The presentations have begun and the first act is to announce the Clive 
Churchill Medal winner for man of the match. It’s veteran backrower Luke Lewis, 
who won a premiership with Penrith in 2003.
 
Sharks captain Paul Gallen, now a bonafide Cronulla immortal, is lifted from 
the ground by Andrew Johns. He has tears in his eyes. “I can’t tell you how 
proud I am of these blokes,” he says, choking back sobs. “What they did 
tonight! Oh my God! They’re the best blokes. So good. I can believe it because 
of the hard work we’ve put in but to do this! I’m so happy, I’m so proud.”

Michael Ennis has a go but is barely coherent: “I thought we were ‘gorn’ when 
Chambers scored. But Fifita, Fifita! I can’t believe it! We created a heap of 
chances. The Storm are champions, they just recover, recover, recover.”

 
Some classy words from the losing captain, Cameron Smith: “I think everyone 
that follows rugby league has to be happy for the Sharks. They’ve waited a long 
time for this. It would have been nice to win tonight and it won’t take away 
the bitter disappointment we all feel, but I’m happy for the Sharks and all of 
their fans that they get a premiership.”
 
The crowd have gone Herbie Goes Bananas while Ennis, Gallen, Lewis and Co. 
bawl and whoop and holler. After 50 years Cronulla finally have something to 
put in their trophy cabinet. “Up, Up, Cronulla” reverberates around the stadium!

Credit to the Storm. What a defensive effort, what spirit to not just stay in 
the game but hit the lead.

80 min: But he’s dragged to ground and that’s it! The Sharks have won it! Turn 
the porch light off! Harold Holt is home! Okay, he’s not. But turn the porch 
light off! It doesn’t matter any more!
 
79 min: Oh my goodness, what a final minute! The Storm work their way 70m down 
field, Koroibete and Vunivalu making huge inroads. The refuse to be tackled. 
It’s offload after offload and they wind ever closer to the Sharks’ line. Just 
when they appear to be through the line closes. And finally, it finds Koroibete 
who races over the 10m line after the hooter sounds...
 
79 min: Townsend finds touch as the clock enters the final minute. The Storm 
will feed the scrum inside their own 20m.
 
78 min: Chambers is running out but he kicks inside for himself and regathers. 
He takes the tackle but missed Cronk unmarked on his inside! Cronk would have 
scored. The Storm then shift it left and play hot potato, but they can’t 
fashion a break. So it’s a grubber but it runs dead!
 
76 min: Four minutes for the Sharks to hang on. And on the last, Cronk scythes 
Maloney down before he gets a kick away. But the Storm are on their own 10m 
line.
 
75 min: Maloney’s drop-kick sails over the halfway line, and on the second 
tackle Bromwich knocks on!
 
75 min: An ordinary Storm set ends in an ordinary Cronk kick. But the Sharks 
allow it to bounce and it bounces into the in-goal, past Barba who is beaten by 
the leg break. But he recovers to bat the ball dead ahead of Chambers!
 
73 min: The Storm go the short side inside the Sharks’ 20m but Cronk’s kick is 
caught beautifully by Bird. Mark Waugh would have been pleased with that.

Moments later, however, Maloney kicks out on the full. His only false step all 
night. Melbourne to come again.
 
72 min: Luke Lewis cops a shoulder to the head. His head didn’t need that. In 
profile he looks like a boxer with far too many unsuccessful rounds under his 
belt.
 
He doesn’t miss and the Sharks have poked their noses in front. Ten minutes 
between them and their first premiership. Can they do it?
 
Yes, it’s a try all right, and the Sharks will go ahead unless Maloney misses 
from right in front.
 
Ennis finds Fifita on the charge and he manages to keep the ball in one mitt 
amid four tacklers. He spins, he drives, he reaches out and seems to have 
planted the ball cleanly!

68 min: On the fifth tackle, 10m out and in front, Christian Welch flops on 
top of Townsend who was already well tackled. D.U.M.B. The Sharks don’t, of 
course, take the certain two points. They’ll run it...
 
67 min: The Storm won this year’s minor premiership on the back of their 
defence, one that conceded a mere 12.5 points a game. Could that same defence 
be about to win them their third premiership crown?

Not yet. Penalty to Cronulla for holding down and Townsend kicks for touch. 
Cronulla to begin a set on the Storm’s 40m.
 
Smith pops it over and yes, the game HAS turned on its head.
 
And the Storm are ahead for the first time tonight! From 20m out, in midfield, 
Cronk passes right to Hampton to Chambers and, after taking a bump from Beale, 
Chambers recalibrates and continues running, slicing through two tacklers to 
dive over!

match. Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images  
63 min: This will help the Storm. Townsend, looking for touch, I think, 
grubbers the ball dead from 35m. As good as the Storm’s defence has been, the 
Sharks’ attack has looked, dare I say, a little toothless.
 
61 min: Barba weaves dangerously and gets the Sharks on the attack again. On 
the last Maloney goes left with a cut-out to Leutele but Vunivalu cleans up a 
short kick and the Storm survive another Shark attack.
 
60 min: And again the Storm hold firm.

59 min: Cheyse Blair catches a Maloney kick centimetres inside the field of 
play and Luke Lewis drags him to ground in the in-goal. Another Storm drop-out, 
but another Sharks set where they didn’t really look like breaking the Storm 
line.
 
57 min: Making the most of their seven tackles (due to Smith kicking dead) the 
Sharks run it deep and the Storm can only knock on a Maloney cross-field kick 
close to their own line.
 
55 min: The Storm are gathering momentum now, making good metres in attack. On 
the last, from midfield and 20m out, Cameron Smith picks up from dummy half and 
kicks the ball dead with no Storm player in sight. That’s the kind of boo-boo 
Smith doesn’t tend to make.
 
54 min: Barba flies high to take a Cronk kick on his own 20m. He, Feki and 
Holmes have been wonderful tonight.

Play is stopped as Bukuya is being treated for a head knock, the result of an 
awkward attempt at tackling Proctor. He’s going off and won’t be off, allowing 
Tagataese to get on the park.
 
53 min: Has the game now turned on it’s head? The Storm are up in the Sharks’ 
faces as the Shiremen try to run it out from their own line. The Sharks’ set 
ends with Leutele left-footing it downfield where Munster picks it up in his 
own 10m.
 
What a boost that try will be for Melbourne. Smashed all game and now, after 
Smith’s successful conversion, they’re just two down. They’ll have a spring in 
their sprigs now.
 
Yes he does, despite three tacklers on him.

50 min: A McLean charge is halted centimetres from the line. From the 
play-the-ball Jesse Bromwich hits it up, spins at the line, and appears to get 
the ball down in traffic!
 
48 min: An awful grubber from Townsend, intended for his outside backs, gifts 
the ball to a relieved Storm on their 20m. Hmm. The Sharks aren’t applying the 
killer touch just yet. Will they? And now another penalty to the Storm.

47 min: Chambers is penalised for lifting the tackled player above the 
horizontal and Maloney, taking the kick for touch, takes play over the half.
 
46 min: And though the Storm do get deep into Sharks’ territory two poor kicks 
by Cronk don’t help matters for the men in purple. He’s been unusually 
ineffective tonight, Cronk, though the Sharks are applying a lot of pressure 
when he gets the ball.
 
44 min: The Sharks aren’t trying anything too expansive —though perhaps they 
should be by now. Another of their sets —this one ended with a poor Ennis kick— 
is foiled by more excellent Storm defence.

And here’s penalty to the Storm to give them a fast track out of their own 
half.
