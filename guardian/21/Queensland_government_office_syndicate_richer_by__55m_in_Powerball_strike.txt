A Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> 
government department could be looking for more than a dozen new employees 
after an office syndicate claimed the $55m Powerball jackpot.

Twenty-one workers, believed to be from the Department of Education, will each 
pocket $2.6m after buying the winning ticket for Thursday night’s draw. The 
syndicate’s leader said the money would mean something different for each of 
her colleagues, whose ages range from 23 to 60.

“I’ll be able to buy a house and get my teeth fixed – I’ll be able to afford 
braces,” she said. “For some they may retire, others will clear debts and pay 
off mortgages and others have told me they will help their family.

“I’m sure there will be a few holidays as well.”

The woman said one of the syndicate’s members had boldly announced on the day 
of the draw that they were going to win but the reality was yet to sink in for 
her.

“I just went to work this morning like normal and now this has happened, it’s 
just incredible – we’re multimillionaires,” she said.

The winning ticket was sold at Casino News on George Street in Brisbane’s city 
centre. The manager Cindy Lynch said it was the third division one entry sold 
at the store.

“To have changed not one life but 21 lives is fantastic,” Lynch said. “I have 
goosebumps just thinking about it.

“I wish it was me, but this is still so exciting.”

It is the second largest win on a single ticket in Powerball history – the 
record was set in January last year when a $70m jackpot was won by grandparents 
in Hervey Bay.
