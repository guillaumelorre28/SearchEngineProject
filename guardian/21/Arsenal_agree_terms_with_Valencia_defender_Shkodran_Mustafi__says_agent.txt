Ali Bulut told the German website Spox 
<http://www.spox.com/de/sport/fussball/international/england/1608/News/fc-arsenal-skhodran-mustafi-verhandlungen-vor-durchbruch.html>
 that a deal for the 24-year-old had been agreed in principle. “It now just 
remains for the teams to come to an agreement over the fee,” he said.

If the deal goes through, Mustafi – valued by Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> at £25m – would replace 
Arsenal’s long-term injury victims Per Mertesacker and Gabriel Paulista.

Gabriel faces up to two months out with an ankle injury suffered in the 
pre-season friendly against Manchester City in Sweden, while Mertesacker will 
be missing for four to five months with a knee problem. Laurent Koscielny, 
meanwhile, is not yet match fit after his involvement in France’s run to the 
Euro 2016 final.

The defensive crisis had left Arsène Wenger with a dilemma over his selection

 for Sunday’s Premier League season opener at home to Liverpool – with Calum 
Chambers likely to partner Nacho Monreal, and Kieran Gibbs at left-back.

Mustafi joined Valencia in 2014 for €8m having impressed at Sampdoria. He had 
previously spent an unhappy three years at Everton, having moved to England 
aged 17.
