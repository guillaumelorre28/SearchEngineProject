Despite leading 2-1 after the first leg of their rematch of last year’s final, 
Bilbao dominated most of the first half and took a 1-0 lead on the night after 
Inaki Williams’s 12th-minute goal.

The second half, however, was all Barcelona’s after Suárez calmed the home 
fans with the equaliser in the 53rd minute.

Visibly tired from their first-half efforts, Bilbao wilted before Gerard Piqué 
and Neymar scored to make it 5-2 on aggregate with less than 10 minutes left.

“We went out with a good advantage but then conceding made it complicated for 
us,” Suárez said. “It was a poor first half from us but then we went out with a 
different attitude and that made the difference.”
