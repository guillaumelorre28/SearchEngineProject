“What I am saying is right. I mean I am just stating the truth, what the Bible 
says,” he said during training in his hometown of General Santos. The 
37-year-old added that his only mistake this week had been to compare people to 
animals.Nike ended its commercial deal with the Filipino after his comments, 
calling them “abhorrent”.

Pacquiao had apologised on Facebook, saying he was sorry for hurting people 
and was “not condemning LGBT” but was still against gay marriage.

But Pacquiao’s Instagram account seemed to back up his initial comments as a 
Bible quote appeared, reading: “If a man has sexual relations with a man as one 
does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be 
put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.”

The post was up for around two hours and received more than 18,000 likes 
before being deleted. The Filipino news agency ABS-CBN captured a screenshot of 
the post before it was removed.

However, Pacquiao – still wearing his Nike sports gear – insisted the row had 
not affected him.

“I’m happy. I’m always happy because God is with me,” he said.

Pacquiao, who was beaten by Floyd Mayweather last year in the “fight of the 
century”, is due to face Timothy Bradley Jr in April and will then step up his 
career in politics.
