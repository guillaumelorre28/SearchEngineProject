Micronesia

off-licence

Oh not O


except in phrases of invocation or hymn titles, eg O God, Our Help in Ages Past

oilfield, oilwell

oil painting

oil production
platform for production of oil oil rig for exploration and drilling oilseed 
rape

OK 
is OK; okay is not 

Old Etonian

old Labour 
but New Labour

old master 
lowercase for paintings as well as ageing schoolteachers 

Old Testament 

olé!
needs the accent to stop it reading like “ole”

O-levels
GCE O-levels and CSEs were combined in 1986 to become GCSEs

Olympic Games
or just Olympics, or the Games 

omelette
not omelet 

omertà
code of silence; note accent

onboard
one word: “Once onboard, they got so drunk that the onboard explosion went 
undetected.”

Avoid “aboard” except in the phrase “All aboard!”

one
One should find an alternative, preferably you (unless one is making fun of 
one’s royal family).

If you do use it, the possessive has an apostrophe: “the ones in the window 
are one’s favourites”

one in six, one in 10
Phrases of this sort should be treated as plural. There are good grammatical 
and logical reasons for this. Compare “more than one in six Japanese is 65 or 
older … “ with “more than one in six Japanese are 65 or older … “

Grammatically, we are talking not about the noun “one” but the noun phrase 
“one in six”, signifying a group of people. Logically, the phrase represents a 
proportion – just like “17%” or “one-sixth”, both of which take plural verbs. 
“Two out of every seven” and “three out of 10” take plurals too, functioning 
identically.

“One in six is … “ is also unnecessarily (and possibly misleadingly) specific, 
implying that of any six people from the group you take, exactly one will be as 
described. “One in six” means one-sixth on average over the whole group, and a 
plural verb better reflects this. We wouldn’t say “Only 1% of Republican voters 
is able to point to Iraq on a map” just because there’s a “one” in there

one-nation politics
but one nation Tory

one-stop shop

Onetel
UK telecom company, not One.Tel, which is Australian 

ongoing
Bureaucrats and business people love this jargon word and associated phrases 
such as “ongoing situation” or “on an ongoing basis”. Even some journalists are 
oddly fond of it, although the story has yet to be written that cannot be 
improved by removing it. “The case continues” is preferable to “the trial is 
ongoing”


online

only
can be ambiguous if not placed next to the word or phrase modified: “I have 
only one ambition” is clearer than “I only have one ambition”; however, be 
sensible: do not change the song title to I Have Eyes for Only You.

Say “the only” or “one of the few” rather than “one of the only”, which has 
found its way into the paper

on side or onside?
The referee kept the home crowd on side by ruling the goal onside 

on stage
two words unless used adjectivally, for example in the phrase “her onstage 
persona”

on to not onto
Kingsley Amis, perhaps slightly overstating the case for this, argued: “I have 
found by experience that no one persistently using onto writes anything much 
worth reading”

See into <https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-i#into> 

00 gauge
(model railways) – the number 0, not the letter O, though pronounced 
“double-O” (as in Hornby Dublo)

oohing and aahing, oohs and aahs

Op 58, No 2
for classical music 

Opec Organisation
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, but not necessary to spell out 

opencast mine

ophthalmic

opossum

opposition, the

or
need not be used when explaining or amplifying – rather than “the NUT, or 
National Union of Teachers” say “the NUT (National Union of Teachers)“ or, even 
better, “the National Union of Teachers” at first mention and then just “the 
NUT” or “the union”

orangutan
one word 

orchestras
take initial capitals, eg London Symphony Orchestra (LSO after first mention), 
Berlin Philharmonic, etc

ordinance
decree

Ordnance Survey
Britain’s national mapping agency (ordnance because such work was originally 
undertaken by the army)

oriented, disoriented
not orientated, disorientated

Orkney
not “the Orkney Isles” or “the Orkneys” 

Ottakar’s bookshop
taken over by Waterstones

O2, the
(cap O, not the number 0) is the name of the former Millennium Dome 

Ötzi
the Iceman Europe’s oldest natural human mummy (dated to about 3300BC), found 
in the Alps in 1991

Ouija
TM; the generic name most commonly used, though not very satisfactory, is 
“talking board”

outback
(Australia)

outed, outing
take care with these terms: if we say, for example, that a paedophile was 
outed, we are equating that with a gay person being outed; use exposed or 
revealed instead

outgrow, outgun, outmanoeuvre

outpatient
St Thomas’ hospital in south London boasts the following styles, all on signs 
within a few yards of each other: Out Patients, Out-Patients, Outpatients, and 
outpatients. Across London, Barts adds Out-patients and OUTPATIENTS to the 
eclectic mix. In a further development, the NHS has all but eradicated the 
apostrophe

outre
no accent 

outside
not “outside of”

outward bound
outdoor adventure or adventure training are safer terms: we have been sued 
twice for reporting that people have died on “outward bound” courses that were 
nothing to do with the Outward Bound Trust

over
is already an adverb, so “overly” is unnecessary. The same applies to 
“regardlessly” (regardless of how you feel about it), last, not “lastly”, and 
least, not “leastly”

overestimate, overstate
are frequently confused with underestimate or understate 

overreact, override, overrule
and most other words with the prefix “over” do not need a hyphen

oxen
rather than “oxes” is the plural of ox 

oxi
not strictly a transliteration of the Greek for no, but this is what we use

Oxford comma 
a comma before the final “and” in lists: straightforward ones (he ate ham, 
eggs and chips) do not need one, but sometimes it can help the reader (he ate 
cereal, kippers, bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade, and tea).

Sometimes it is essential: compare 
I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis, and JK Rowling
with 
I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis and JK Rowling 

oxymoron
does not just vaguely mean self-contradictory; an oxymoron is a figure of 
speech in which apparently contradictory terms are used in conjunction, such as 
bittersweet, compassionate conservatism, “darkness visible” (Paradise Lost), 
“the living dead” (The Waste Land); one of Margaret Atwood’s characters thought 
“interesting Canadian” was an oxymoron
