The British Boxing <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing> Board of Control 
has withdrawn the licence of trainer Liam Wilkins and suspended the licence of 
boxer Hasan Karkardi for six months following the unsanctioned sparring session 
which left Nick Blackwell in a coma with swelling on his brain in November.

Blackwell’s boxing licence had been withdrawn before November’s ill-advised 
sparring session, after collapsing at the end ofhis defeat by Chris Eubank Jnr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/19/nick-blackwell-boxing-chris-eubank-jr-no-hard-feelings>
 in March. On that occasion he was found to have suffered a bleed on the skull 
and was put into an induced coma. Blackwell then made a full recovery and 
subsequently announced his retirement from the sport.

Following his sparring session, Blackwell regained consciousness from a coma 
just before Christmas and was said to be “smiling again”, according to his 
brother Daniel.
