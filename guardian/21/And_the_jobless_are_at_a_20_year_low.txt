Strengthening economic growth sent unemployment crashing to a 19-year low last 
month, but there was scant evidence of an acceleration in wage inflation.

The data left open the question of whether the Bank of England was right to 
increase interest rates last week to cap inflationary pressures.

While headline average earnings rose 4.6% in the three months to July from 
4.4% in June, it masked a falling trend, with the year-on-year rate in July 
dropping to 4.4% from 5.2%.

However, some City analysts remained convinced that the tightening labour 
market would eventually stoke higher pay settlements.

"Less slack in the economy implies growing upside risk to the medium-term 
inflation outlook.We therefore expect the MPC to raise rates by 0.25% points in 
the fourth quarter and another 0.25% points in the first quarter of next year," 
said Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.

The data, published by the Office for National Statistics, showed the number 
of people out of work and on benefits fell by 22,300 in July to 1,211,500, the 
lowest level since April 1980. The ILO measure, which includes those seeking 
work but not on benefit, fell 86,000 between May and July, taking the 
unemployment rate to 5.9% of the workforce, the lowest recorded since the 
statistical series began in 1984.
