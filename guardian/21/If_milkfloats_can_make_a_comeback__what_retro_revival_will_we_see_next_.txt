The past is a place containing no small level of misery. The patience required 
to exist in pre-modern times, to say nothing of the immune system, means that 
the present is preferable, and the future seems inviting. There’s never that 
much chance to halt change: there are aspects to life today that will give 
birth to the smiles that will form the wrinkles of our old age, while some 
features will be replaced, rendered redundant by social or technological 
progress.

Occasionally we dive back into some element of the past, or refuse to let go 
of some cherished bit of the old. The survival of milkfloats and the resurgence 
of old-fashioned foil-toppedmilk bottles 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ethical-hipsters-are-driving-return-of-electric-milk-floats-6cdv5tdjw>
 in London is a testament to an age in which we didn’t have convenience stores, 
a time when our goods and services came from people with whom we had a personal 
connection. What would you bring back if you could? Some modest suggestions for 
anyone feeling nostalgic:

When did everything become so ephemeral? Child exploitation and working 
conditions in the rest of the world now mean many people would rather swing by 
the shops than learn to sew on a button. Stores such asPrimark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/primark> exist to allow people to buy a 
shirt, wear it a few times, then bin it. Few things are built to be more than 
merely disposable. Our expectations have been slowly eroded, as “make do and 
mend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/04/fashion-on-the-ration-make-do-and-mend-wartime-style>
” has been replaced by the ability to buy everything from power tools to beach 
towels at a price that makes them expendable. It can’t be too much to expect 
goods built to last, and yet nothing ever seems to survive longer than a year 
or two.

There was a more romantic time when it was the norm for people to stare at 
each other intently across the table, lit only by the warm light of candles. 
Today, the faces of your dining companions are more likely to be illuminated by 
the screens of their smartphones. Of coursemillennials 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2016/apr/15/what-does-millennial-mean-is-it-vague-lazy-and-meaningless>
 prefer bottomless brunch to supper: in the morning an iPhone still has some 
juice left in it. Ditch Tinder and get a box of matchsticks: we wouldn’t get on 
each other’s wick by constantly checking Twitter if we returned to a more 
refined age of social interaction.

Given up on finding a legal aid lawyer? Frustrated by the inefficiencies of 
the court process? A braver government would allow the return of trial by 
combat between consenting adults. Cheaper, faster and more entertaining than 
normal legal proceedings, it would also help to undermine our pernicious safety 
culture. If both parties agree, who are we to stand in the way?

We are losing sight of the idea of good faith. The notion of respecting those 
who act out of a sense of public duty has been all but erased. Division along 
cultural and political lines has sharpened, to the point at which many actually 
doubt the sincerity and basic humanity of their political opponents. Shrill 
screeching has replaced dignified political discourse. Our default position 
towards almost anyone in a position of authority is jaded cynicism. We have 
lost faith in the idea of public service. Instead many attack cultural and 
political elites, believing that by angrily dragging public life down to the 
lowest common denominator that they will achieve something. The result so far 
looks like a potential Donald Trump nomination.

We don’t have to go back to rationing to get on an even keel with food, but 
between the 3 million tonnes of perfectly good food we throw away each year and 
the61.7% of adults 
<http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/loseweight/Pages/statistics-and-causes-of-the-obesity-epidemic-in-the-UK.aspx>
 who are overweight or obese, somewhere along the line we lost control of our 
relationship with food. It’s cheap, easy, too unhealthy and we consume far too 
much of it. The old-fashioned approach which saw the war generation cooking 
what was available, using leftovers, and controlling their portion sizes was 
more sustainable, and would cut levels of obesity.

The gold standard of entertainment is two dimensions. The third dimension 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/11/3d-no-better-than-2d> is just 
irritating peripheral blurriness at an increased cost. Why would anyone want to 
wear pinching plastic goggles when they could just employ both their 
imagination and their awareness of three-dimensional spaces? We never needed 
three dimensions to make sense of TV and cinema before now, we haven’t suddenly 
become confused about the conventions of film.

It doesn’t seem all that long ago that the Labour party was a force to be 
reckoned with. It’s surely due a retro revival?
