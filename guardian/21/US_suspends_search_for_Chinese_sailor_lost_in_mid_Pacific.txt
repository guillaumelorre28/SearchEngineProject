The US Coast Guard has suspended its search for a Chinese sailor who lost 
contact with his team on Tuesday during an attempt to break the world record 
for a solo crossing of the Pacific.


 Rescuers boarded Guo Chuan’s drifting yacht and found his lifejacket but he 
was not there, they said.

Guo “was a professional mariner with a deep passion for sailing”, Captain 
Robert Hendrickson said. “Our deepest condolences go out not only to his family 
and friends but also to his racing team and the sailing community.”

Footage released showed Guo’s 30-metre (97ft) trimaran, Qingdao China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china>, drifting across the waves hundreds 
of miles west of Hawaii, its red sail emblazoned with the words “Peace and 
Sport”.

A US navy helicopter crew and a Coast Guard Hercules aircraft flying over the 
vessel were unable to contact Guo.

In 2013 Guo, 51, became the first Chinese sailor to complete a non-stop solo 
circumnavigation of the globe. He set off from San Francisco on 18 October in 
an attempt to set a record crossing of the Pacific, but his team lost contact 
with him on Tuesday afternoon. They alerted US authorities, and rescuers from 
the USS Makin Island reached the Qingdao China on Thursday.

“The boat crew confirmed Chuan was not on the vessel although his life jacket 
remains aboard,” the Coast Guard said.

They lowered the mainsail and left the Qingdao China – originally built as the 
Idec 2 for the French yachtsman Francis Joyon – at sea, it added, saying his 
racing team was arranging to salvage the vessel.

On a verified Weibo social media account the team said Guo’s personal items 
had been recovered.

In a sailing diary entry for 20 October, posted by his team, he said listening 
to a recording of his two sons’ laughter on his computer was “the world’s most 
beautiful song, the song that puts me most at ease”.

Guo had previously said his greatest fear was to fall in the water, China’s 
official Xinhua news agency reported, citing him as saying: “I fear being 
separated from the ship when I am sailing solo.”

Guo’s team said they had observed his speed slowing on Tuesday and attempted 
to contact him, but he did not answer either satellite calls or internet 
communication. The US searchers had found a broken sail in the water, they 
added.

Chinese fans expressed fear for the mariner, with one writing that it was 
“likely he was adjusting or repairing the sail when he was struck or an 
accident occurred and he fell”.

The US Coast Guard said it was called when Guo’s team had not received 
notification from him for 24 hours. The sailor had previously been “in constant 
contact” with his shore team and family and was “not likely to miss scheduled 
calls”, it said.

The search covered an area of about 4,600 sq miles (12,000 sq km) over two 
days.
