I’m about to take a two-day break but I can’t go without mentioning a superb 
headline I came across in today’sIrish Times 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/irish-times>.

It was over a fairly routine story about research at Galway university into 
the declining numbers of the “dark European honey bee” (apis mellifera 
mellifera, in case you wondered). 

Evidently, according to Grace McCormack, professor of molecular evolution and 
systematics laboratory at NUI Galway, a subspecies in Ireland“is likely to be 
the last stronghold of this species.”

Their population has decreased because many beehives suffer from infection 
with the varroa mite, necessitating chemical treatment that is itself harmful 
to the bees’ health. So what’s the solution?

McCormack believes wild bees are resistant to the mites that affect 
beekeepers’ hives so she came up with a plan. She and her her team would find 
wild bee colonies that are naturally resistant to such infections.

And the newspaper’s headline (in print) was perfect: “University researchers 
come up with plan bee.” Online, where SEO rules, I am delighted to report that 
the pun survived in a slightly more awkward form: “NUIG researchers come up 
with plan bee for survival.”

But let’s appreciate the skills of the subeditor who wrote it originally. And 
no, I do not intend to come up with a responding pun. I leave that to my 
readers. Instead, I will go off to the Isle of Innisfree... See you again on 
Friday.
