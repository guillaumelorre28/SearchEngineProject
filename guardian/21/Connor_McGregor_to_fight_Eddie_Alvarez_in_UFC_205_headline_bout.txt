The 28-year-old McGregor, who became featherweight champion when he knocked 
out José Aldoin just 13 seconds

 last December, has yet to defend that title.

He set his sights on the lightweight title, but his plans to take that title 
were scuppered when then-champion Rafael Dos Anjos had to pull out of a 5 March 
fight in Las Vegas due to injury. Since then Brazilian Dos Anjos has lost the 
title to American Alvarez, while McGregor engaged in two epic welterweight 
battles against Nate Diaz, losing for the first time in the UFC in Marchbefore 
gaining his revenge in August

.

The lightweight fight is the third on the UFC 205 card, which also features 
Tyron Woodley against Steven Thompson for the welterweight title, and a women’s 
strawweight matchup between Joanna Jedrzejczyk and Karolina Kowalkiewicz.
