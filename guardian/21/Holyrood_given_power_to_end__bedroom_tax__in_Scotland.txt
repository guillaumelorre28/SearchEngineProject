The UK government has moved to neutralise the impact of the bedroom tax on the 
Scottish independence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence> referendum by 
handing powers to the Scottish government that will allow it to mitigate the 
measure.

The Scotland Office has informed the Scottish government that it will transfer 
the power to set the cap on discretionary housing payments (DHP) to help people 
on housing benefit who need extra help. The change will mean the Scottish 
government will, in effect, be able to end the bedroom tax inScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>. Holyrood will not receive any extra 
resources from London and will have to fund any changes from its budget.

The change, which was pushed strongly in London by Nick Clegg, Danny Alexander 
and Alistair Carmichael, is designed to undermine the claim by the SNP that the 
bedroom tax can only be ended by taking Scotland out of the UK.

David Mundell, the Tory Scotland Office minister, said: "I believe that 
transferring this power to the Scottish government is the correct thing to do. 
The UK government believes in taking a pragmatic approach to devolution and we 
believe in a United Kingdom that gives Scotland the best of both worlds."

The SNP hailed the announcement as a victory. Linda Fabiani, an SNP member of 
the Scottish parliament's welfare reform committee, said: "After months of 
ignoring our requests to lift the cap on discretionary housing payments 
Westminster has finally listened. This is a victory for those affected by the 
hated bedroom tax."
