 cut short a training session after suffering a headache in the weeks before 
the fatal fight, it has emerged.

Gym owner and promoter Alex Morrison said the headache had forced Mike Towell 
to stop sparring as he prepared for Thursday’s bout with Dale Evans.

The boxer’s “heartbroken” partner, Chloe Ross, said Towell, from Dundee, had 
been suffering from headaches in the weeks before the fight.

Morrison told the Scottish Sun on Sunday: “He was sparring with a guy called 
Stewart Burt but he stopped because of the headache. I never paid any attention 
as he looked OK. When he told the guys he wasn’t feeling too good, they advised 
him not to box.”

The boxer’s management team have said they were not aware of any headache 
complaints as politicians and doctors questioned the safety of the sport.

The 25-year-old welterweight, known as “Iron Mike Towell”, was stretchered 
from the ring after a fifth-round loss to Evans in a St Andrew’s Sporting Club 
fight in Glasgow.

He was taken to Queen Elizabeth University hospital, diagnosed with severe 
bleeding and swelling to his brain, and died shortly after 11pm on Friday, 12 
hours after being taken off life support.

Ross, his partner of eight years, wrote on Facebook: “I’m absolutely 
heartbroken to say my annoying best friend passed away tonight at 11.02 very 
peacefully. Michael had severe bleeding and swelling to his brain. He had been 
complaining of headaches for the last few weeks but we put it down to migraines 
with the stress of his fight.

“It has been the longest 24 hours of our lives. My baby has lost his daddy. 
But he will be so so proud of his dad in what he achieved. Once he was taken 
off his life support he managed 12 hours, 12 whole rounds off his life support. 
He fought right to the end and he’s done us all so proud.”

The boxer’s family were at his bedside in his final hours and were joined by 
his manager, Tommy Gilmour, and St Andrew’s Sporting Club owner, Iain Wilson.

A spokesman for the club said nobody in Towell’s management team was aware of 
any headache problems leading up to the fight.

Gilmour said the world of boxing had lost both a top fighter and a “very 
special man”, describing him as one of the best he had ever worked with. Wilson 
said the club has lost “one of our favourite sons and boxing has lost an 
explosive talent”.

The eliminator for the British welterweight title at the Radisson Blu hotel, 
Glasgow, was being broadcast on STV Glasgow when Towell was fatally injured.

Evans is yet to comment on his opponent’s death, but described Towell as a 
“true warrior” in a statement issued after he was taken to hospital. He said: 
“I never wanted to see my opponent being stretchered out of the ring. Who would 
ever want that sight? That was so hard for his family and my heart goes out to 
them.”

An appeal set up by former world champion boxer Ricky Hatton to raise money 
for Ross, and the couple’s young son, Rocco, has passed its £20,000 target.

The British Boxing <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing> Board of 
Control, the sport’s governing body and licensing authority, is yet to comment.
