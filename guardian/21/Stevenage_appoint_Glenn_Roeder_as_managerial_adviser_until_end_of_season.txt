.

The chairman, Phil Wallace, said: “Darren Sarll is an excellent young coach 
who has the respect of the players and understands the DNA of the club but 
obviously has limited experience as a professional manager.

“Rather than throw away his energy, dedication and skill set to get results, 
we are instead introducing top-level managerial experience and tuition to the 
management structure and Glenn, having managed in the Premier League, is a 
fantastic addition to our team.

“Glenn will start today and will be at the heart of everything we do until the 
end of the season. We hope this exciting appointment gives the whole club a 
lift and sees us start to climb the table in our remaining nine games.”

Roeder’s most recent role was as an adviser at Sheffield Wednesday.
