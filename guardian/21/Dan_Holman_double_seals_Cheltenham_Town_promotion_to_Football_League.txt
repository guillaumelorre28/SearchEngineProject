Cheltenham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cheltenham> Town sealed 
promotion back to the Football League after a comfortable 2-0 win at home to 
Halifax.

Dan Holman also became the National League’s top goalscorer with his 27th and 
28th goals of the season, which came in the first half.

The first was a curled effort from the edge of the box after a good through 
ball by Asa Hall. The striker, who joined in January from Woking, then slotted 
home a penalty following a handball in the box by James Bolton.

Cheltenham played within themselves in the second half, and news of Forest 
Green’s loss sent the Whaddon Road crowd into jubilation. A 22-match unbeaten 
league run through the winter was the key for Gary Johnson’s men, who fully 
deserve to have secured top spot and return to League Two after only one season 
away.
