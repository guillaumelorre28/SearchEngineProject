Clint Eastwood’s Oscar-winning, box office-topping drama American Sniper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-sniper> was a worldwide hit, but 
even its most fervent fans were unable to take the film’s clearly fake baby 
very seriously.

Star Bradley Cooper has now addressed the use of a doll, calling the 
experience “nuts”during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuT0Cfu-j5o>.

“I literally couldn’t believe it,” he said. “Like I couldn’t believe we were 
working with the plastic baby.”

The film features a scene where Cooper holds his newborn son and attempts to 
move the plastic doll with his thumb. It became the subject of ridicule during 
the film’s release. Screenwriter Jason Hall claimed that the real baby showed 
up with a fever and the second choice was a no-show, so Eastwood resorted to 
desperate measures.

“I was like, ‘This is nuts,’” Cooper said of the experience, “Eat your heart 
out, Muppets. I have to say, I grew to be very fond of that [doll]. I fell in 
love with that plastic thing.”

Cooper’s American Sniper co-star Sienna Miller also spoke to Ellen recently 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2j1D4r5YNs> about the baby, claiming that it 
“looked like something from Alien”.

The pair were both promoting their new film together, food drama Burnt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/burnt-trailer-bradley-cooper-tortured-culinary-genius-sienna-miller>
, where Cooper plays a chef trying to rebuild his reputation. Cooper will also 
be seen in Miracle Mop biopicJoy
