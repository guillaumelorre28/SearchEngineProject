Emergency services in New South Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> and the Australian 
Capital Territory have predicted a worse than usual bushfire season, as this 
week’s heatwave breaks December records in south-eastern Australia.

The NSW Rural Fire Service warned that drier than average conditions made NSW 
“extremely vulnerable” to bushfires this summer, while fire bans were declared 
in parts of NSW, Victoria andSouth Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> for Tuesday and 
Wednesday.


On Tuesday afternoon residents in Neath and Abermain, near Cessnock in the NSW 
Hunter Valley, were warned to take shelter as 80 firefighters assisted by 
water-dropping aircraft fought two fires in the area.

Residents in several streets were told it was too late to leave their homes. 
Others were advised it might not be safe to return home.

Temperatures were expected to exceed 33C in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/weather/melbourne> and Adelaide concurrently, 
which has not occurred in December since 1965. Tuesday was forecast to be 
Sydney’s hottest December night since 1972.


The deputy commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, Rob Rogers, said he was 
concerned about the December to February period.

“We’ve had some really significant rainfall west of the ranges over winter 
which has caused a huge amount of grass growth west of the Great Dividing 
Range. This is quite concerning for us regarding the potential for significant 
grass fires over the summer,” he said.

The RFS has extended the lease of one of its 44,000 capacity fire-fighting air 
tankers as an extra precaution. “It only takes a day or two of warm weather,” 
Rogers said.

His concerns echoed  a recent report 
<https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/uploads/49c0afa455d0f6bcb7dd909dba303935.pdf>
 from the Australian Climate Council which predicted “tinderbox conditions” for 
NSW and the ACT and “above average” bushfire potential for parts of Western 
Australia and Queensland.

“The trend of warmer and drier than average weather conditions mean both NSW 
and the ACT are extremely vulnerable to bushfires this summer,” it said.

“We had one of the wettest springs on record and then one of the driest 
Octobers on record, so we’ve got a lot of grass there that is very, very dry. 
That provides a very dangerous level of fuel,” Prof Lesley Hughes said.

She linked the report’s findings to climate change and urged the government to 
take immediate local action as well as working globally to curb emissions.


“The most important message to get across is that climate change is with us 
now. We’re already getting more extreme hot weather and we will continue to see 
this risk of bushfires increasing”, she said.

“We need to make sure our emergency services are adequately resourced, and 
that that increases as the risk from climate change increases. Long term, we 
fundamentally have to control our emissions and work with the rest of the world 
to do that.Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/weather/australia> is widely 
recognised as lagging sadly behind.”


The chief officer of the Victorian Country Fire Association, Steve Warrington, 
also noted concern over grass fires, but said the summer was otherwise “looking 
like a traditional fire season”.


“We think it will be short and sharp”, he said. “The focus this year will be 
on the grasslands and the scrub coastal areas around Victoria”.

But he said homeowners and municipalities should take extra precautions due to 
recent weather fluctuations.

“Normally we would have a lead-in time – but we’ve almost turned the tap on 
overnight, we’ve gone from rain and cold and floods to heat and fire almost 
within a week,” he said. “The time that people normally have to clean up their 
property isn’t there.”

Fire services advised vulnerable homeowners to prepare a bushfire survival 
plan, clean out gutters and remove combustibles such as wood piles from around 
their homes.

In NSW, with temperatures nudging 40C in some areas, severe fire warnings were 
in place in the north, south and eastern Riverina and the lower Central West 
Plains, with total fire bans in seven districts.

The RFS put out isolated spot fires throughout the day and instructed farmers 
in several regions to cease harvesting.

Two helicopters were on standby in strategic areas.

The RFS dispatched an air tanker to Oakland in the Riverina to control a fire 
that had broken out.

In South Australia, total fire bans were declared in 10 districts as the 
Bureau of Meteorology forecast temperatures in the low 40s in some parts of the 
state. On Tuesday morning firefighters were tackling a bushfire across 3,300 
hectares between the Nullarbor Roadhouse and the Western Australian border.

In Victoria a total fire ban was declared in three districts, with very high 
to severe conditions across the state.

The RPSCA warned pet owners against a potential “epidemic of heat 
stress-related injuries and possible death” for dogs during the hot spell.

“It only takes six minutes for an animal to die from heat stroke,” said RSPCA 
NSW chief inspector David OShannessy. He urged dog owners not to leave their 
pets unattended in cars and to take extra precautions in providing water and 
shade.
