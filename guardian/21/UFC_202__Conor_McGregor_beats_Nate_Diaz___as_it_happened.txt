Post-fight thoughts

McGregor showed his class. There’s no doubting his determination and ability. 
He put together a plan and executed it, forcing Diaz to give everything he had. 
It’s difficult to argue against the judges call for a majority decision in 
McGregor’s favor. The bout was that tight, and the action and output was 
furious. A third contest at 155 changes the game quite a lot. Diaz will get a 
chance to compete at a weight he most often fights at, and McGregor won’t have 
to navigate a path to victory in a division he does not seem built for. We’ve 
seen many trilogies in theUFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc>, though 
perhaps none as intoxicating as what McGregor and Diaz appear on the verge of 
producing.

Les Carpenter

The crowd came for blood tonight and they got blood. From the moment the fight 
started this place was loud – louder than the MGM Grand Garden was for 
Diaz-McGregor I. Everyone knew they were watching a great fight and they 
reacted accordingly Lots of singing of “Ole Ole Ole” from the Irish fans and 
“USA USA USA” chants for Diaz. They roared on every flurry of punches and they 
cheered the decision. When Diaz was asked if he wanted a Diaz-McGregor III 
everyone screamed. Everyone, it seemed, thinks there should be a third meeting.

Then as soon as both fighters left the arena (McGregor limping badly as soon 
as he got off the arena floor and into he tunnel) everyone got up and left. Ten 
minutes after the fight, the arena was empty.

Diaz: “Hey good job today, Conor, but we’re going for three. For real. Until 
then I ain’t coming back.” Diaz said he thought he won. It was very close. A 
war for sure.

McGregor calls for a rematch

McGregor wants a trilogy and calls for it to be at 155 pounds. “I proved the 
class difference but that toughness and durability crept in the later rounds.”

End of round five: McGregor v Diaz

They are grinding so hard. Giving everything. What a worthy performance by 
both men. Diaz is putting his weight on McGregor and finally gets a takedown. 
The bell sounds with Diaz on top throwing blows. Worth the wait. Worth every 
penny.

Unofficial Guardian scorecard for round five: Diaz 10-9 (48-47 Diaz)

Diaz walks McGregor back to the fence. You get the feeling there will be 
another big burst from these two. Diaz scores with a solid elbow. McGregor 
again denies a takedown. But this is good control for Diaz. The fifth is tight 
with 60 seconds remaining.

Diaz looks for a double leg takedown. Was close but outstanding defense by 
McGregor to prevent it. There hasn’t been a bit of groundfighting yet. Diaz 
scores a strong combination and McGregor moves away. We’re midway through round 
five.

Round five: McGregor v Diaz

Diaz’s eyes are a mess. He stands and flexes in his corner. McGregor is 
countering well and got a big gut shot with a jumping knee. Diaz presses the 
featherweight champion into the fence. McGregor turns and they’re at distance 
again in the center of the cage.

What a bloody mess of a fight. They’re both scoring on the inside. McGregor is 
working for everything. He’s not backing down despite the pressure, and Diaz 
doesn’t seem affected other than the damage to his face.

McGregor is hurting in his corner. His eyes are closed. Trainer John Kavanagh 
tells his charge he’s winning the clinch every time. McGregor is most certainly

As McGregor runs Diaz is pointing and laughing. The Irishman scores with two 
kicks, but they don’t have the oomph of earlier blows. Diaz continues to walk 
through McGregor’s strikes. A minute remaining in the third and Diaz scores 
with a 1-2. Diaz is laying it on McGregor now. Diaz is going after the 
featherweight champion.

Off the break Diaz lands a right hook. McGregor returns the favor. Diaz slaps 
McGregor and drives the smaller man into the fence. This is a great fight. Diaz 
tries for a double leg takedown and misses. This clinch work certainly favors 
Diaz. McGregor has gotten away from the leg kick and scoring at distance.

Diaz is clearly laboring on that lead leg. McGregor is moving away and Diaz is 
starting to plow forward. For the first time McGregor is taking punches. A 
strong combination by Diaz puts McGregor into the fence. finally a fight is 
materializing. Diaz scores on the inside. The clinch is serving him well. 
Terrific round and Diaz talks trash as they head back to their corners.

You get the sense that Diaz just needs a moment to turn this around. But at 
this point he hasn’t found it. McGregor lands another big left on Diaz’s 
bloodied face midway through Round 2. Diaz jabs at McGregor’s stomach. He tries 
another and is clipped by a left hand over the top.

Round 2: McGregor v Diaz

First kick is checked. Next one lands. A big left drops Diaz. McGregor backs 
away and they’re standing again. Diaz is getting plastered. Another shot puts 
the American down on the canvas. McGregor predicted a stoppage within two 
rounds. He’s on his way. Diaz has to find a home for his punches. He hasn’t 
done much yet.

So Diaz has to sort out the leg kicks. This has been a weakness in his game 
for a long time. McGregor is comfortable, barely breathing in his corner as 
John Kavanagh speaks to him about the technical difference being the reason he 
wins over the next four rounds.

Round one: McGregor v Diaz

Diaz flexes as his name is announced. The fighters move to the center of the 
cage for final instructions. A bevy of Nevada inspectors step between them and 
there’s no touch of the gloves. The southpaws move to face one another. For 
Diaz it’s about dictating range. For McGregor it’s about not forcing anything. 
In the first minute McGegor has looked for leg kicks. Kicks were the obvious 
tactic McGregor could add for this fight. And Diaz finally checks a kick. A few 
defensive moves like that and McGregor won’t want to kick much more. McGregor 
unloads a left hand that cracks Diaz. Another left puts Diaz on the ground. 
Nate stands as the Irishman backs off. This is a much more measured McGregor. 
McGregor digs with a lead uppercut. Diaz hasn’t found the range yet. Hard kicks 
from McGregor. Diaz scores with punches. Again the California fighter lands. 
McGregor slips beautifully and counters over the top. The featherweight 
champion is very calm. No extra exertion on anything. Diaz hasn’t moved to 
grapple yet. He just ate a hard low kick. Very damaging. McGregor scores on a 
combination as the first round closes.

Guardian unofficial scorecard: 10-9 McGregor

Relative to their first clash, McGregor should be smarter and Diaz should be 
sharper. It’s a fascinating contest. Bruce Buffer is going though his 
introductions.

The lights dim inside T-Mobile Arena. Now it’s Nate Diaz’s turn. In many ways 
Diaz has picked up the promotional mantel from McGregor for this rematch, and 
seems to have thrived despite the brighter lights. Diaz looks in fantastic 
condition at 170, the best he has at this weight. At the age of 31, about to 
step into his 30th pro fight, having been in theUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> for a decade, Nate is not one to feel 
like this will be too big for him, or that he’ll have to do something out of 
his comfort zone.

Thus far UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 202 has brought violence 
and generally one-sided competition. As the main event approaches, violence 
surely seems in the offing. Competitive? Well we can only hope. McGregor is 
about to make his way to the cage. He has placed an immense amount of pressure 
on himself in the lead up to this rematch, which must be viewed at as a crucial 
moment in his career even though no belt is on the line and he’s fighting 25lbs 
above his championship weight. This is all about reputation. Is Mac still 
mystic?

It’s a drunk, edgy and star-studded crowd at T-Moblie Arena. Everywhere you 
turn you see...somebody. Of course I nearly ran over Mike Tyson earlier in the 
night (or more like I almost raninto Mike Tyson which would have caused some 
kind of trouble. But aside from the various local celebrities andUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> stars (they STILL boo Daniel Cormier 
here), there are enough bold faced names. Dwight Howard is here, Keviin Garnett 
is too.

Now that the stands are full it appears to be a half-McGregor and half-DIaz 
crowd. There is not the huge contingent of Irish fans who have flown in just of 
the fight as there have been for some of his earlier Las Vegas fights.

Johnson is just ferocious. Win after win puts what Daniel Cormier did to him 
in perspective. Props to the current champion for not only taking Johnson’s 
best, but turning it around and finding a finish.The official time of the fight 
is 0:13 of Round 1. Knockout. Anthony “Rumble” Johnson. That was Johnson’s 11th
UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> knockout, tying him for second 
behind Vitor Belfort.

“I wasn’t surprised he put pressure on me,” said Johnson. “I can fight going 
backwards. I can fight going forwards. Damn, I can fight.”

On fighting for the title: “I’m working hard to get to the title. I’ve been 
busting my but off to get to the title. And Daniel: You’re the man baby but I’m 
coming for you.”

Two heavy hitters hit the cage now. Light heavyweight contenders Anthony 
“Rumble” Johnson and Glover Teixeira should produce a compelling bout. There 
are paths to victory on either side. Both can get knocked out. If there’s an 
edge in one department it belongs to Teixeira should action hit the ground. His 
top game is heavy, and he could manage a submission especially if Johnson shows 
any signs of fatigue.

For the third fight in a row Donald Cerrone looked spectacular at 170 pounds. 
The veteran “Cowboy” lit up Rick Story to score a technical knockout at 2:02 of 
Round 2. After a long campaign in the lightweight division, Cerrone’s move to 
welterweight has him looking like a world beater. But he said he intends to do 
his next beating at 155, challenging champion Eddie Alvarez.
“I got a thing I gotta do at 155. Eddie Alvarez has a thing that belongs to 
me. Let’s go, Madison Square Garden. Me and Eddie.”
Based on his recent efforts, Cerrone (31-7) is more appealing to watch as a 
welterweight. There’s a long line of fighters wanting and deserving a crack at 
Alvarez, and it’s difficult to make a good case for Cerrone to get another shot 
at the lightweight belt considering he hasn’t fought in the division in nine 
months, and the last time he did he was flattened by then champion Rafael dos 
Anjos.

Bettors interested in Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> tonight appear to have no 
interest in what pundits or fighters are saying. Despite the result in March. 
Despite a full training camp. Despite the fact that McGregor is not a man with 
a welterweight frame. The Irishman continues to be the odds on favorite to make 
good his retribution. Smart money? We’ll see soon enough. Two more bouts to go 
before the big main event. Up next, Rick “Horror” Story against Donald Cerrone.

Not all late replacements are made the same. While Sabah Homasi was chopped up 
by Tim Means, UFC debutant Mike Perry made the most of his experience. South 
Korean Hyun Gyu Lim, 31, was set to fight Dagestan’s Sultan Aliev, however an 
injury wiped that bout from the books and the 24-year-old Floridian Perry got 
the call. He looked comfortable from the start, walloping Lim with punches that 
sent him sprawling to the canvas on several occasions. Referee John McCarthy 
stepped in to call a halt to the action at 3:38 of Round 1. With his firstUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> win in the books, Perry improved his 
record to 7-0. Lim’s second straight loss dropped him to 13-6-1.

Sabah Homasi is not on Team Means’ level. That was obvious from the outset of 
their opening pay-per-view bout as Homasi, a late replacement for the injured 
Sean Strickland, struggled to do what he wanted and took an assortment of 
punishment. As Means usually does, he operated with extreme effectiveness on 
the inside. For such a long fighter, his elbow and clinch game is beautiful to 
watch—unless you’re on the opposite end of it. Homasi hoped to takedown and 
control Means, but he never managed the latter part of that. Instead Means 
(26-7-1) busted up Homasi (11-6) with elbows that opened him up and covered his 
face with blood. Referee Herb Dean took pity on Homasi, calling the fight for 
Means at 2:56 of Round 2.

Tim Means has beaten Sabah Homasi after the referee stopped the fight in the 
third round Homasi couldn’t raise his hands to stop Means’s punches and took a 
serious beating. A big cut opened up on his forehead and Means targeted it so 
much that both fighters were soon covered in Homasi’s blood. Means had to wipe 
his bloody gloves on his shorts.

As he left the cage, Means gave fist bumps to the writers on the first row of 
the ringside press table. Given the bloody mess they had been Im happy to be 
sitting in the third row.

Wondering why Conor McGregor is taking on a fight he has a good chance of 
losing? Well,according to ESPN 
<http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/17355975/conor-mcgregor-3-million-purse-nate-diaz-fight-ufc-202-richest-history>
 he’s likely to earn $3m from this one, $2m than he got for the first meeting 
with Diaz. Diaz is likely to get $2m tonight. Still far short of anything 
boxers would earn in a fight of a similar stature but the two fighters will 
make more in pay-per-view bonuses.

The pay-per-view portion of UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 202 is 
a mixed bag. While the focus is rightly centered on the main event between two 
men spoiling for a brawl, the four bouts preceding Diaz-McGregor 2 also seem 
matched to bring action.

Save the co-main between “Rumble” Johnson and Glover Teixeira, the main card 
features four welterweight contests.

Diaz and McGregor should probably face off at 155 instead of 170 but 
welterweight it’ll be. McGregor is due some credit for feeling like if he 
bothered to chase down Diaz again he had to take the rematch at the weight he 
faltered in March.

Meanwhile, Tim Means and Sabah Homasi open the main card, followed by Hyun Gyu 
Lim and Mike Perry, and a highly intriguing contest pitting Rick Story and 
Donald Cerrone.

Story-Cerrone is difficult to breakdown. Cerrone looked great moving up to 170 
in his last contest stopping Patrick Cote in the third round. Story is a 
durable and strong grinder who may be too big and too strong for the swift and 
accurate striker.

The final three bouts of the pay-per-view certainly make for good viewing.

So I got up from my ringside press seat to get some food before the main event 
and walked straight into a clot of people who seemed to not be moving. With 
hunger getting the best of me, I pushed into the throng hoping I would be able 
to squeeze through. I moved through the first line of people and into the 
middle of the circle until I noticed who it was they surrounded. Lets just say 
I’d recognize that face tattoo anywhere.

Needless to say, I did not shove past Mike Tyson. I wasn’t THAT hungry...or 
stupid. And he appeared to be in a good mood, kind of like in that scene at the 
end of The Hangover.

Cody Garbrandt sent another message to the UFC bantamweight division. In the 
main preliminary bout ofUFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 202, 
Garbrandt improved his record to 10-0 when he plastered veteran Japanese 
fighter Takeya Mizugaki with a right hand and followed with a series of punches 
that forced referee John McCarthy to intervene 48 seconds into the opening 
round.

Speaking about UFC bantamweight champion Dominck Cruz, who stopped Mizugaki in 
61 seconds in 2014, the 25-year-old Garbrandt left nothing to the imagination: 
“I just knocked him out faster than you. I’m going to break your jaw. I’m going 
to show you who your daddy is for real.”

Les Carpenter

In an especially bloody bout, Artem “The Russian Hammer” Lobov beat Chris 
Avilia in a unanimous decision. Several times during the fight Lobov dared 
Avilia to hit him, which Avilia was able to do once, opening a gash in his 
forehead. But even with the blood on his face, Lobov still dominated the fight.

Lobov, who trains with Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> drew many “olé!” chants from 
the Irish fans in the crowd. After the fight, he grabbed the microphone and 
thanked them.

“In times of war, my brothers never let me down, the Russian and Irish,” he 
said.

He then offered an opinion – albeit biased – on who will win the top fight of 
the night.

“Watch McGregor beat in him in the third round,” he said.

Hello and welcome

Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor>
 will renew their rivalry tonight at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The 
pressure is squarely on McGregor, who seeks revenge following a March contest 
in which Diaz upended the fiery Irishman with a rear-naked choke finish in the 
second round. Their first bout – made on 11 days’ notice after McGregor’s 
original opponent, then UFC lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos fell out due 
to injury – took place at 170lbs and set a UFC pay-per-view record. The fallout 
was almost as captivating as the match itself, and unfolded in such a way as to 
bring the pair together in another major showcase at UFC 202.

Will Diaz prove his point? Will McGregor accomplish what he dedicated himself 
to since March 4? Whatever happens, it sets up as highly entertaining.

UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 202 is dotted with fights worth 
watching – led by the co-main event featuring a light heavyweight title 
eliminator between Anthony “Rumble” Johnson and Glover Teixeira for the right 
to meet Daniel Cormier later this year – yet the heat of the main event, which 
has gone nuclear several times, soaked up the vast majority of fan and media 
attention.

Conor McGregor beats Nate Diaz in UFC 202 epic and calls for rematch
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/ufc-202-conor-mcgregor-nate-diaz-fight-report-rematch> 
McGregor showed his class. There’s no doubting his determination and ability. 
He put together a plan and executed it, forcing Diaz to give everything he had. 
It’s difficult to argue against the judges call for a majority decision in 
McGregor’s favor. The bout was that tight, and the action and output was 
furious. A third contest at 155 changes the game quite a lot. Diaz will get a 
chance to compete at a weight he most often fights at, and McGregor won’t have 
to navigate a path to victory in a division he does not seem built for. We’ve 
seen many trilogies in theUFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc>, though 
perhaps none as intoxicating as what McGregor and Diaz appear on the verge of 
producing.
 
The crowd came for blood tonight and they got blood. From the moment the fight 
started this place was loud – louder than the MGM Grand Garden was for 
Diaz-McGregor I. Everyone knew they were watching a great fight and they 
reacted accordingly Lots of singing of “Ole Ole Ole” from the Irish fans and 
“USA USA USA” chants for Diaz. They roared on every flurry of punches and they 
cheered the decision. When Diaz was asked if he wanted a Diaz-McGregor III 
everyone screamed. Everyone, it seemed, thinks there should be a third meeting.

Then as soon as both fighters left the arena (McGregor limping badly as soon 
as he got off the arena floor and into he tunnel) everyone got up and left. Ten 
minutes after the fight, the arena was empty.
 
Diaz: “Hey good job today, Conor, but we’re going for three. For real. Until 
then I ain’t coming back.” Diaz said he thought he won. It was very close. A 
war for sure.
 
McGregor wants a trilogy and calls for it to be at 155 pounds. “I proved the 
class difference but that toughness and durability crept in the later rounds.”

Judges: 48-47 McGregor, 47-47, 48-47 McGregor. Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> wins a majority decision.
 
They are grinding so hard. Giving everything. What a worthy performance by 
both men. Diaz is putting his weight on McGregor and finally gets a takedown. 
The bell sounds with Diaz on top throwing blows. Worth the wait. Worth every 
penny.

Unofficial Guardian scorecard for round five: Diaz 10-9 (48-47 Diaz)
 
Diaz walks McGregor back to the fence. You get the feeling there will be 
another big burst from these two. Diaz scores with a solid elbow. McGregor 
again denies a takedown. But this is good control for Diaz. The fifth is tight 
with 60 seconds remaining.
 
Diaz looks for a double leg takedown. Was close but outstanding defense by 
McGregor to prevent it. There hasn’t been a bit of groundfighting yet. Diaz 
scores a strong combination and McGregor moves away. We’re midway through round 
five.
 
Diaz’s eyes are a mess. He stands and flexes in his corner. McGregor is 
countering well and got a big gut shot with a jumping knee. Diaz presses the 
featherweight champion into the fence. McGregor turns and they’re at distance 
again in the center of the cage.
 
McGregor has moved much better in the fourth round. A hard jab by Diaz brings 
cheers from the crowd. That’s the bell for Round 4.

Unofficial Guardian scorecard for round four: 10-9 McGregor (Diaz 38-38 
McGregor)
 
What a bloody mess of a fight. They’re both scoring on the inside. McGregor is 
working for everything. He’s not backing down despite the pressure, and Diaz 
doesn’t seem affected other than the damage to his face.
 
McGregor unfurls a hard right hand and Diaz slaps him back. Solid leg kick by 
McGregor. Blood is flowing freely from Diaz’s face. He’s cut under his right 
eye. Strong jab by McGregor. They’re locked against the fence at the midway 
point of Round 4. Diaz is digging to McGregor’s body.
 
McGregor is hurting in his corner. His eyes are closed. Trainer John Kavanagh 
tells his charge he’s winning the clinch every time. McGregor is most certainly 
not.
 
Tremendous work here. A huge body shot by Diaz. McGregor is laboring. There’s 
the bell for the third. Big round for Diaz.

Unofficial Guardian round three scorecard: Diaz 10-9 (Diaz 29-28 McGregor)
 
As McGregor runs Diaz is pointing and laughing. The Irishman scores with two 
kicks, but they don’t have the oomph of earlier blows. Diaz continues to walk 
through McGregor’s strikes. A minute remaining in the third and Diaz scores 
with a 1-2. Diaz is laying it on McGregor now. Diaz is going after the 
featherweight champion.
 
Off the break Diaz lands a right hook. McGregor returns the favor. Diaz slaps 
McGregor and drives the smaller man into the fence. This is a great fight. Diaz 
tries for a double leg takedown and misses. This clinch work certainly favors 
Diaz. McGregor has gotten away from the leg kick and scoring at distance.
 
McGregor opens with a hard low kick.The next one is checked and Diaz scores 
with a left hand. A jab lands. Diaz is pressing forward and is enjoying 
himself. He pointed and smiled at McGregor, then moved into the clinch. 
McGregor turns Diaz into the fence but only for a second. The crowd is cheering 
for Diaz.
 
Diaz is clearly laboring on that lead leg. McGregor is moving away and Diaz is 
starting to plow forward. For the first time McGregor is taking punches. A 
strong combination by Diaz puts McGregor into the fence. finally a fight is 
materializing. Diaz scores on the inside. The clinch is serving him well. 
Terrific round and Diaz talks trash as they head back to their corners.

Unofficial Guardian scorecard for Round 2: 10-9 Diaz (Diaz 19-19 McGregor)
 
You get the sense that Diaz just needs a moment to turn this around. But at 
this point he hasn’t found it. McGregor lands another big left on Diaz’s 
bloodied face midway through Round 2. Diaz jabs at McGregor’s stomach. He tries 
another and is clipped by a left hand over the top.
 
First kick is checked. Next one lands. A big left drops Diaz. McGregor backs 
away and they’re standing again. Diaz is getting plastered. Another shot puts 
the American down on the canvas. McGregor predicted a stoppage within two 
rounds. He’s on his way. Diaz has to find a home for his punches. He hasn’t 
done much yet.
 
So Diaz has to sort out the leg kicks. This has been a weakness in his game 
for a long time. McGregor is comfortable, barely breathing in his corner as 
John Kavanagh speaks to him about the technical difference being the reason he 
wins over the next four rounds.
 
Diaz flexes as his name is announced. The fighters move to the center of the 
cage for final instructions. A bevy of Nevada inspectors step between them and 
there’s no touch of the gloves. The southpaws move to face one another. For 
Diaz it’s about dictating range. For McGregor it’s about not forcing anything. 
In the first minute McGegor has looked for leg kicks. Kicks were the obvious 
tactic McGregor could add for this fight. And Diaz finally checks a kick. A few 
defensive moves like that and McGregor won’t want to kick much more. McGregor 
unloads a left hand that cracks Diaz. Another left puts Diaz on the ground. 
Nate stands as the Irishman backs off. This is a much more measured McGregor. 
McGregor digs with a lead uppercut. Diaz hasn’t found the range yet. Hard kicks 
from McGregor. Diaz scores with punches. Again the California fighter lands. 
McGregor slips beautifully and counters over the top. The featherweight 
champion is very calm. No extra exertion on anything. Diaz hasn’t moved to 
grapple yet. He just ate a hard low kick. Very damaging. McGregor scores on a 
combination as the first round closes.

Guardian unofficial scorecard: 10-9 McGregor
 
Relative to their first clash, McGregor should be smarter and Diaz should be 
sharper. It’s a fascinating contest. Bruce Buffer is going though his 
introductions.

 
The lights dim inside T-Mobile Arena. Now it’s Nate Diaz’s turn. In many ways 
Diaz has picked up the promotional mantel from McGregor for this rematch, and 
seems to have thrived despite the brighter lights. Diaz looks in fantastic 
condition at 170, the best he has at this weight. At the age of 31, about to 
step into his 30th pro fight, having been in theUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> for a decade, Nate is not one to feel 
like this will be too big for him, or that he’ll have to do something out of 
his comfort zone.

 
McGregor moves with swagger around the cage. He looks at ease.

 
Thus far UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 202 has brought violence 
and generally one-sided competition. As the main event approaches, violence 
surely seems in the offing. Competitive? Well we can only hope. McGregor is 
about to make his way to the cage. He has placed an immense amount of pressure 
on himself in the lead up to this rematch, which must be viewed at as a crucial 
moment in his career even though no belt is on the line and he’s fighting 25lbs 
above his championship weight. This is all about reputation. Is Mac still 
mystic?

Up next: A man who knows something about 13-second knockouts. Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> seeks vengeance against Nate 
Diaz in short order.
 
It’s a drunk, edgy and star-studded crowd at T-Moblie Arena. Everywhere you 
turn you see...somebody. Of course I nearly ran over Mike Tyson earlier in the 
night (or more like I almost raninto Mike Tyson which would have caused some 
kind of trouble. But aside from the various local celebrities andUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> stars (they STILL boo Daniel Cormier 
here), there are enough bold faced names. Dwight Howard is here, Keviin Garnett 
is too.

Now that the stands are full it appears to be a half-McGregor and half-DIaz 
crowd. There is not the huge contingent of Irish fans who have flown in just of 
the fight as there have been for some of his earlier Las Vegas fights.

Johnson is just ferocious. Win after win puts what Daniel Cormier did to him 
in perspective. Props to the current champion for not only taking Johnson’s 
best, but turning it around and finding a finish.The official time of the fight 
is 0:13 of Round 1. Knockout. Anthony “Rumble” Johnson. That was Johnson’s 11th
UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> knockout, tying him for second 
behind Vitor Belfort.

“I wasn’t surprised he put pressure on me,” said Johnson. “I can fight going 
backwards. I can fight going forwards. Damn, I can fight.”

On fighting for the title: “I’m working hard to get to the title. I’ve been 
busting my but off to get to the title. And Daniel: You’re the man baby but I’m 
coming for you.”
 
Round 1: Johnson comes out winging his right hand. And BANG! A right hand 
touches Teixeira’s chin and the Brazilian is knocked out cold. Johnson unloaded 
a sneaky uppercut that hammered Teixeira.
 
Two heavy hitters hit the cage now. Light heavyweight contenders Anthony 
“Rumble” Johnson and Glover Teixeira should produce a compelling bout. There 
are paths to victory on either side. Both can get knocked out. If there’s an 
edge in one department it belongs to Teixeira should action hit the ground. His 
top game is heavy, and he could manage a submission especially if Johnson shows 
any signs of fatigue.

For the third fight in a row Donald Cerrone looked spectacular at 170 pounds. 
The veteran “Cowboy” lit up Rick Story to score a technical knockout at 2:02 of 
Round 2. After a long campaign in the lightweight division, Cerrone’s move to 
welterweight has him looking like a world beater. But he said he intends to do 
his next beating at 155, challenging champion Eddie Alvarez.
“I got a thing I gotta do at 155. Eddie Alvarez has a thing that belongs to 
me. Let’s go, Madison Square Garden. Me and Eddie.”
Based on his recent efforts, Cerrone (31-7) is more appealing to watch as a 
welterweight. There’s a long line of fighters wanting and deserving a crack at 
Alvarez, and it’s difficult to make a good case for Cerrone to get another shot 
at the lightweight belt considering he hasn’t fought in the division in nine 
months, and the last time he did he was flattened by then champion Rafael dos 
Anjos.

Bettors interested in Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> tonight appear to have no 
interest in what pundits or fighters are saying. Despite the result in March. 
Despite a full training camp. Despite the fact that McGregor is not a man with 
a welterweight frame. The Irishman continues to be the odds on favorite to make 
good his retribution. Smart money? We’ll see soon enough. Two more bouts to go 
before the big main event. Up next, Rick “Horror” Story against Donald Cerrone.
 
Say what you will about Conor McGregor’s ... interesting persona but you 
cannot deny the man is very well dressed.

Not all late replacements are made the same. While Sabah Homasi was chopped up 
by Tim Means, UFC debutant Mike Perry made the most of his experience. South 
Korean Hyun Gyu Lim, 31, was set to fight Dagestan’s Sultan Aliev, however an 
injury wiped that bout from the books and the 24-year-old Floridian Perry got 
the call. He looked comfortable from the start, walloping Lim with punches that 
sent him sprawling to the canvas on several occasions. Referee John McCarthy 
stepped in to call a halt to the action at 3:38 of Round 1. With his firstUFC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> win in the books, Perry improved his 
record to 7-0. Lim’s second straight loss dropped him to 13-6-1.
 
Sabah Homasi is not on Team Means’ level. That was obvious from the outset of 
their opening pay-per-view bout as Homasi, a late replacement for the injured 
Sean Strickland, struggled to do what he wanted and took an assortment of 
punishment. As Means usually does, he operated with extreme effectiveness on 
the inside. For such a long fighter, his elbow and clinch game is beautiful to 
watch—unless you’re on the opposite end of it. Homasi hoped to takedown and 
control Means, but he never managed the latter part of that. Instead Means 
(26-7-1) busted up Homasi (11-6) with elbows that opened him up and covered his 
face with blood. Referee Herb Dean took pity on Homasi, calling the fight for 
Means at 2:56 of Round 2.
 
I particularly enjoy the difference in excitement levels between the two 
fighters in this tweet:

Tim Means has beaten Sabah Homasi after the referee stopped the fight in the 
third round Homasi couldn’t raise his hands to stop Means’s punches and took a 
serious beating. A big cut opened up on his forehead and Means targeted it so 
much that both fighters were soon covered in Homasi’s blood. Means had to wipe 
his bloody gloves on his shorts.

As he left the cage, Means gave fist bumps to the writers on the first row of 
the ringside press table. Given the bloody mess they had been Im happy to be 
sitting in the third row.

Wondering why Conor McGregor is taking on a fight he has a good chance of 
losing? Well,according to ESPN 
<http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/17355975/conor-mcgregor-3-million-purse-nate-diaz-fight-ufc-202-richest-history>
 he’s likely to earn $3m from this one, $2m than he got for the first meeting 
with Diaz. Diaz is likely to get $2m tonight. Still far short of anything 
boxers would earn in a fight of a similar stature but the two fighters will 
make more in pay-per-view bonuses.
 
The pay-per-view portion of UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 202 is 
a mixed bag. While the focus is rightly centered on the main event between two 
men spoiling for a brawl, the four bouts preceding Diaz-McGregor 2 also seem 
matched to bring action.

Save the co-main between “Rumble” Johnson and Glover Teixeira, the main card 
features four welterweight contests.

Diaz and McGregor should probably face off at 155 instead of 170 but 
welterweight it’ll be. McGregor is due some credit for feeling like if he 
bothered to chase down Diaz again he had to take the rematch at the weight he 
faltered in March.

Meanwhile, Tim Means and Sabah Homasi open the main card, followed by Hyun Gyu 
Lim and Mike Perry, and a highly intriguing contest pitting Rick Story and 
Donald Cerrone.

Story-Cerrone is difficult to breakdown. Cerrone looked great moving up to 170 
in his last contest stopping Patrick Cote in the third round. Story is a 
durable and strong grinder who may be too big and too strong for the swift and 
accurate striker.

The final three bouts of the pay-per-view certainly make for good viewing.
 
So I got up from my ringside press seat to get some food before the main event 
and walked straight into a clot of people who seemed to not be moving. With 
hunger getting the best of me, I pushed into the throng hoping I would be able 
to squeeze through. I moved through the first line of people and into the 
middle of the circle until I noticed who it was they surrounded. Lets just say 
I’d recognize that face tattoo anywhere.

Needless to say, I did not shove past Mike Tyson. I wasn’t THAT hungry...or 
stupid. And he appeared to be in a good mood, kind of like in that scene at the 
end of The Hangover.
 
Cody Garbrandt sent another message to the UFC bantamweight division. In the 
main preliminary bout ofUFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 202, 
Garbrandt improved his record to 10-0 when he plastered veteran Japanese 
fighter Takeya Mizugaki with a right hand and followed with a series of punches 
that forced referee John McCarthy to intervene 48 seconds into the opening 
round.

Speaking about UFC bantamweight champion Dominck Cruz, who stopped Mizugaki in 
61 seconds in 2014, the 25-year-old Garbrandt left nothing to the imagination: 
“I just knocked him out faster than you. I’m going to break your jaw. I’m going 
to show you who your daddy is for real.”
 
Some early results:

Bantamweight: Raquel Pennington def. Elizabeth Phillips (unanimous decision) 3R

Featherweight: Artem Lobov def. Chris Avila (unanimous decision) 3R

Strawweight: Cortney Casey def. Randa Markos (armbar) 4:34 R

Welterweight: Lorenz Larkin def. Neil Magney (TKO) 4:08 R1

Welterweight: Colby Covington def. Max Griffin (TKO) 2:18 R3

Middleweight: Marvin Vettori def. Alberto Uda (guillotine choke) 4:30 R1
 
In an especially bloody bout, Artem “The Russian Hammer” Lobov beat Chris 
Avilia in a unanimous decision. Several times during the fight Lobov dared 
Avilia to hit him, which Avilia was able to do once, opening a gash in his 
forehead. But even with the blood on his face, Lobov still dominated the fight.

Lobov, who trains with Conor McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor> drew many “olé!” chants from 
the Irish fans in the crowd. After the fight, he grabbed the microphone and 
thanked them.

“In times of war, my brothers never let me down, the Russian and Irish,” he 
said.

He then offered an opinion – albeit biased – on who will win the top fight of 
the night.

“Watch McGregor beat in him in the third round,” he said. 
 
Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/conor-mcgregor>
 will renew their rivalry tonight at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The 
pressure is squarely on McGregor, who seeks revenge following a March contest 
in which Diaz upended the fiery Irishman with a rear-naked choke finish in the 
second round. Their first bout – made on 11 days’ notice after McGregor’s 
original opponent, then UFC lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos fell out due 
to injury – took place at 170lbs and set a UFC pay-per-view record. The fallout 
was almost as captivating as the match itself, and unfolded in such a way as to 
bring the pair together in another major showcase at UFC 202.

Will Diaz prove his point? Will McGregor accomplish what he dedicated himself 
to since March 4? Whatever happens, it sets up as highly entertaining.

UFC <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc> 202 is dotted with fights worth 
watching – led by the co-main event featuring a light heavyweight title 
eliminator between Anthony “Rumble” Johnson and Glover Teixeira for the right 
to meet Daniel Cormier later this year – yet the heat of the main event, which 
has gone nuclear several times, soaked up the vast majority of fan and media 
attention.
 
Josh will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s a preview of tonight’s fight:
