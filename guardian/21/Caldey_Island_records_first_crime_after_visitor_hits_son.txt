A small island off the Welsh coast <http://www.caldey-island.co.uk/monks.htm> 
famed for its order of perfume-making monks and sense of tranquility has 
recorded its first crime in living memory.

Police were called to Caldey Island (population: 40) off Pembrokeshire in 
south-westWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> after an incident at the 
chocolate makers.

The officers had to be taken on an RNLI lifeboat to the island, 2 miles off 
the resort of Tenby, to make an arrest.

This person was a visitor and is a sign of the modern world, I expect

The crime was revealed when a visitor on a day trip from Dudley, West 
Midlands, appeared in Haverfordwest magistrates court on the mainland to admit 
assault. The man was visiting the island when he struck his “misbehaving” 
seven-year-old son during a visit to the “chocolate factory”, a large kitchen 
where some of the monks produce handmade treats.

John Cattini, 65, the island’s commercial manager, said: “This is the first 
crime in court I can recall and I’ve been here more than 40 years.

“I’m glad to say I didn’t witness it but I’m sorry to say I was told about it. 
It is very sad. We are happy to say we live here very peacefully. This person 
was a visitor and is a sign of the modern world, I expect.”

 The monks were described as being concerned by the assault. 

Caldey, which is a mile and a half long, has been a religious retreat since 
the first monastery was set up there 1,500 years ago. The monks take vows of 
poverty, chastity and obedience and observe a rule of silence between the hours 
of 7pm to 7am.

Before the assault, the crime rate was zero. Traffic offences are also at 
zero, unsurprisingly given there is only 300 metres of road.

During the court hearing, Dennis Davies, prosecuting, said other visitors told 
police that the father attacked the boy as they stood outside the chocolate 
factory.

“The man was said to be shouting at the boy before lifting him up with an 
outstretched arm by the throat.” He then put him down, slapped him on the back 
of the head and “frogmarched” him away.

The court heard that another visitor shouted: “That’s child abuse.” 

The father, 45, told police his son was “being naughty and wouldn’t listen”, 
and almost fell down the steps at the chocolate factory. Davies said: “He told 
police that in no way did he intend to hurt him, but accepted that he had been 
unreasonable.”

The defence solicitor, Mike Kelleher, said: “The boy said that his daddy 
hadn’t put his hands around his throat and that he was really good to him. The 
father is deeply upset and didn’t want to hurt his son.” The father was 
released on bail until next month for reports to be prepared.

After the hearing, a spokesman for Dyfed-Powys police said: “We acknowledge 
that the crime rate on Caldey Island is very low, but we take all reports of 
crime seriously and as such investigate them thoroughly.”

 The island is home to nine monks in the monastery and a handful of farmers. 
It hosts more than 3,000 people between April and October, who visit to sample 
the home-made chocolate, perfume and shortbread made by the Cistercian monks.
