<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/19/us/families-speak-as-green-river-killer-gets-48-life-terms.html>
, America’s most prolific serial killer.

Ridgway, a trucker who carried out the majority of his crimes during the early 
1980s, claimed to have killed as many as 71 women, but also said during police 
questioning that he had “lost count”. He was convicted of murdering 49 women in 
2003, and was spared the death sentence through a plea deal by which he agreed 
to lead the police to the remains of missing victims.

Sheen, who wrote the film, will also star as Ridgway. His screenplay is based 
on the graphic novelGreen River Killer: A Detective Story 
<http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11489682-green-river-killer>, which was 
written by Jeff Jensen, the son of Tom Jensen, a detective who spent 20 years 
on the case.

“This is a dark story but one that ultimately finds hope and meaning in that 
darkness,”said Sheen in a statement

. “The story of Tom and Gary, and how they are bound together in time, pulled 
me in from the beginning and wouldn’t let go. I hope that by now bringing it to 
life on screen, it can make audiences feel the same way.”

Sheen, the star of the Showtime series Masters of Sex
