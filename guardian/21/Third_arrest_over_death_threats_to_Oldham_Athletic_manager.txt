A third man has been arrested after a death threat letter was sent to the new 
manager ofOldham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/oldham> Athletic 
football club.

Darren Kelly, who was made boss at the League One club last week, rejected 
claims that he supported the IRA after he reportedly called the Sinn Féin 
politician and Northern Ireland deputy first minister,Martin McGuinness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/martin-mcguinness>, “a legend” on Twitter.

Kelly, 35, from Northern Ireland, was said to have made the comment as he 
retweeted a photograph of his mother meeting McGuinness, a former IRA 
commander, at an event marking the anniversary of Bloody Sunday.

On Monday, police were called to Oldham’s SportsDirect.com Park ground after 
the club received the letter.

A 27-year-old man and a 42-year-old man were subsequently arrested on 
suspicion of making threats to kill

 and later bailed until 15 June, pending further inquiries. On Thursday, a 
31-year-old man was detained on suspicion of making threats to kill. He remains 
in police custody for questioning.

Det Insp Jason Byrne, of Greater Manchester police, said: “The letter sent to 
the club made some extremely serious threats to a number of individuals and we 
are treating this matter with the utmost seriousness.

“We are also aware of equally vitriolic comments that have been made on social 
media and this too forms part of our investigation. We have now made three 
arrests after a third man that we were keen to speak to handed himself in to a 
police station yesterday.”
