To my mind spring drinking is all about optimism: as the days slowly, almost 
imperceptibly, become longer and flowers start to bud and bloom, you want to 
cast off the dark beers, red wines and unctuous brown spirits for a drink that 
feels as fresh and new as the season itself.


1. A better spritz

Future cocktail historians may well date peak Aperol spritz to the summer of 
2015-16. The drink has become so trendy in Australia it has been made with 
Moët, not prosecco, at the spring races – a tragic betrayal of the drink’s 
demotic nature.

Of course, this spritz fever is understandable. It’s hard to shake a taste for 
the spritz once it has been acquired – just ask the Venetians, who have been 
putting them away for almost a century. But just because the Aperol spritz is 
halfway to becoming the pumpkin spice latte of the cocktail world doesn’t mean 
you can’t enjoy a cheeky spritz or two this spring: just swap out the Aperol 
for another Italian aperitivo bitter.

Select, the Venetian bitter that claims to be the original spritz base, makes 
an excellent spritz: dryer than Aperol with a hint of extra bitterness and a 
whisper of ginger on the palate. The wine-based Cappelletti gives a rounder, 
smoother spritz, and Amaro Montenegro makes a spritz loaded with tempting 
citrus and rosewater aromas.

For varsity-level spritz variations, pick up a copy of Talia Baiocchi and 
Leslie Pariseau’s bookSpritz: Italy’s Most Iconic Aperitivo Cocktail 
<https://www.amazon.com/Spritz-Italys-Aperitivo-Cocktail-Recipes/dp/1607748851>
, which features more spritz twists than you might ever have thought possible – 
including a frankly incredible mai tai spritz from Martin Cate, the man behind 
the acclaimed San Francisco rum barSmuggler’s Cove 
<http://www.smugglerscovesf.com/>.

Make it at home: spritz Veneziano

60ml aperitivo bitter of your choice (Select, Campari, Cappelletti, etc)
90ml prosecco
30ml sparkling water

Build all ingredients in a tumbler or wine glass. Add ice. Garnish with green 
olives on a skewer and a slice of orange.

2. White vermouth

If you’ve been mainlining single malts (Scottish, Japanese or otherwise) over 
the winter, your liver could probably do with a break from big, boozy drinks. 
If you’re not already aboard the vermouth train, now’s the perfect time to get 
on: a sweet white or “blanc” vermouth with its low-ABV balance of sweetness and 
bitterness just begs to be consumed on the balcony in the first warm evenings 
of the season.

Just pour a nice slug of it (60ml or so) over ice, add a slice of orange and a 
splash of soda to taste, and enjoy. If you’re after something a little more 
fancy, try it in the classic Cuban cocktail el presidente, below.

Tip: At the bottle shop, make sure you’re getting a sweet white rather than a 
dry vermouth – it’s easy to mix up the two. Casa Mariol’s vermut blanco, 
Dolin’s blanc vermouth and Regal Rogue’s bianco vermouth are all worth seeking 
out.

Build all ingredients in a mixing glass. Add ice, stir and strain into a 
chilled cocktail coupe. Express the oils from a twist of orange peel over the

3. White port

If you’ve acquired a taste for port over the colder months, you don’t need to 
bid it farewell at the approach of warmer weather: just switch from red to 
white.

White port (the proper Portuguese kind, that is) has to be one of the most 
misunderstood products out there, which is a pity because it’s tremendously 
delicious, with loads of nectarine, apricot and lemon blossom on the palate, 
and is very easy to drink.

To bring a slice of Portuguese sunshine into your life, try a good splash of a 
young, dryish white port (again, 60ml or so) with tonic water over ice and a 
slice of lemon.

4. Spanish cava

While we’re on the subject of unfairly neglected drinks, the emergence of 
Italian prosecco as a market force (sales of it overtook French champagne for 
the first time in England last year) has seen Spanish cava languishing here in 
Australia.

This is a shame, because a well-made cava – particularly one made from the 
traditional Catalonian grape varieties macabeu, parellada and xarel·lo – can be 
a delight: as dry as champagne without the French stuff’s sometimes overbearing 
acidity, with a funk and complexity from resting on its lees that most Italian 
proseccos can’t match (excluding the trendy col fondo style).

I adore Celler de Can Suriol’s brut nature, with its brioche notes and hint of 
funk from wild yeasts, and Vallformosa’s MVSA brut, which is loaded with crisp 
white apple and and straw characteristics. The best thing to do with it is to 
pop it open and drink it straight – but if you want to mix it up, try it in 
Alexandra Raij’s original cocktailthe Montserrat 
<http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017600-the-montserrat>.

30ml Aperol
30ml sweet red vermouth (preferably Casa Mariol)
Cava, to top

Build Aperol and vermouth in shaker. Add ice and shake to chill. Double strain 
into a chilled cocktail coupe. Top with cava. Garnish with a green olive and a 
brandied kumquat, if you have one to hand.

5. Russian spring punch

Whatever style of bubbly wine you prefer, for an easy crowdpleaser mix it up 
with some vodka, lemon juice, crème de cassis and sugar to make a Russian 
spring punch.

Created by the late and very great bartender Dick Bradsell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/25/dick-bradsell-obituary> 
(who was also responsible for the espresso martini, the bramble and the 
treacle), it was originally served as a BYO proposition: guests arrived to 
discover a flute preloaded with vodka, cassis, lemon juice and sugar, to which 
they could add their own sparkling wine. AsBradsell recalled 
<https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/1720/russian-spring-punch>: 
“People got to drink their whole bottle of champagne and however many shots of 
vodka they felt they could manage. It was lethal, that thing.”

If you don’t want your guests preparing their own deaths, it’s more sensible 
to mix it up in individual portions. Then raise your glass not only in memory 
of Bradsell but also to welcome the return of warm weather and long evenings.
