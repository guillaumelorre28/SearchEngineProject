Wrexham became the first Welsh club to win the FA Trophy after a thrilling 
Wembley final against their Blue Square Premier rivalsGrimsby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> was decided in a penalty 
shoot-out.

The teams could meet again in the play-offs to reach the Football League and, 
were that to occur, Grimsby would want their goalkeeper, James McKeown, to 
match the outstanding form that restrictedWrexham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wrexham> to a single goal – and that from 
a penalty – until they scored all four of their spot kicks in the shoot-out.

Adrian Cieslewicz, Danny Wright and Chris Westwood scored before Johnny Hunt 
converted the trophy-clinching spot-kick. Sam Hatton hit the post and Richard 
Brodie fired over for Grimsby, whose only successful penalty came from Joe 
Colbeck.

Grimsby had earlier gone ahead in the 71st minute when Colbeck sprinted down 
the right and crossed to Andy Cook, who saw his first shot parried by Chris 
Maxwell before sidefooting in when the ball came back to him.

Wrexham levelled from a penalty awarded with nine minutes remaining when Dean 
Keates was brought down by Shaun Pearson and Kevin Thornton converted.

The former Manchester City junior Cieslewicz was denied by two fine saves from 
McKeown in extra time, the first from a 30-yard volley on the turn and the 
second from a sweet, curling strike. The goalkeeper also repelled a fierce 
volley from Wright.

Grimsby faded as an attacking force and that extended into the shoot-out as 
they missed their first two kicks.

The large Wrexham contingent in a crowd of 35,266, and player-manager Andy 
Morrell, were soon celebrating silverware.
