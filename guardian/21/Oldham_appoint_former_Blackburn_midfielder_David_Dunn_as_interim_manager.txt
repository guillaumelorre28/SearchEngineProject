Oldham Athletic have appointed the former England and Blackburn Rovers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blackburn> midfielder David Dunn as their 
interim manager following the departure of Darren Kelly.

The 35-year-old joined the League One club on a one-year deal in July, making 
eight appearances during Kelly’s short reign at the club. He has now been given 
an opportunity to turn the Latics’ fortunes around after the Northern Irishman
Kelly’s 131-day tenure ended abruptly

 after a 5-1 home defeat to Peterborough.

A statement on the club website on Sunday read: “Oldham Athletic can confirm 
that, with immediate effect, David Dunn will take charge of all first-team 
matters on an interim basis.”

The former Carlisle and York defender Kelly, 36, was handed his first senior 
managerial post in May asOldham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/oldham> 
sprang a surprise with a left-field appointment.

Kelly admitted he would have to prove himself to supporters upon taking the 
position but after securing one win from nine games, he did little to win them 
over.

Saturday’s thrashing by Posh, who are themselves managerless, proved to be the 
final straw and the Latics soon confirmed they were moving on from Kelly, who 
left them 19th in theLeague One 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> table with seven 
points from as many games, and after two cup exits.

Dunn’s first assignment as Oldham manager will be supervising next weekend’s 
trip to Doncaster, with games against Wigan, Port Vale and Gillingham, the 
current leaders, to follow.
