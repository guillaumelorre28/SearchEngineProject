Watzke was responding to a report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/12/usain-bolt-feel-good-because-know-done-it-clean>
 in the Guardian that Bolt planned to train with Dortmund, one of the top 
Bundesliga teams.

Dortmund and Bolt are both sponsored by the same Germany-based sports goods 
company Puma, whose president contacted Dortmund to say that Bolt had asked 
about training with the team.

“We decided this some time ago,” Watzke said. “Puma CEO Bjorn Gulden, who is 
member of our board, has told us that Usain is highly interested in practising 
with us.

“For us that’s no problem. Our coach Thomas Tuchel likes the idea as well. Of 
course he won’t visit us in an important week with Champions League matches but 
maybe in the pre-season. We are delighted and take this as an honour.’

Asked if Bolt could have a future in Dortmund, Watzke replied: “We don’t even 
need to talk about it.”
