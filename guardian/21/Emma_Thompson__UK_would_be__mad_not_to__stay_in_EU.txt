Emma Thompson called for Britain to stay in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, saying the UK would be “mad not to”. 
Describing Britain as “a tiny little cloud-bolted, rainy corner of sort-of 
Europe, a cake-filled misery-laden grey old island”, Thompson said she “just 
felt European” and would “of course” vote to remain in the EU in the upcoming 
referendum. “We should be taking down borders, not putting them up.”

Thompson was speaking at a press conference in Berlin for the world premiere 
of Alone in Berlin, the screen adaptation of Hans Fallada’s 1947 novel about a 
German act of resistance to the Nazis in wartime Berlin. She plays Anna Quangel 
who, with her husband Otto (played by Brendan Gleeson), distributes anonymous 
handwritten postcards containing anti-Nazi messages around the city. Based on 
the real-life case of Otto and Elise Hampel, Alone in Berlin was republished in 
an English-language translation in 2009 and became a bestselling book in the UK 
and US. The new film, directed by Vincent Pérez, is also in English.

In regard to the decision to shoot the film in English, Thompson said: “One of 
the reasons we did it is because it is a European story – it should apply, and 
feel relevant, to all of us whatever language it is in, whether French or 
Portuguese, or whatever.”

Thompson also talked about how what she described as “England’s fascistic 
side” affected the UK’s view of Germany and the second world war. “If you 
consider I was born in 1959, it’s only 14 years after the war ended. All the 
films I saw while growing up about Germans were about the war and us being 
marvellous and beating the Nazis. I was completely brainwashed, I realise.” 
Citing Sebastian Haffner’s Defying Hitler, she said: “It wasn’t until I started 
reading about it, and reading about that many Germans felt they had been 
invaded by the Nazis as much as anyone else. That was for me was key.”
