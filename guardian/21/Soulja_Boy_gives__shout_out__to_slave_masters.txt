Tell 'Em is an expert in race relations. At BET's Hip-Hop Awards wrap event 
last week, the 18-year-old Atlanta rapper shocked the crowd by coming out in 
favour of slavery.

The shock statement came when BET correspondent and former Rolling Stone 
contributor, Touré, asked various stars which historical figure they most 
hated. After Soulja Boy failed to give a response, Touré tried to prompt him, 
saying "Others have said Hitler, bin Laden, the slave masters ... " at which 
pointSoulja Boy <https://www.theguardian.com/music/soulja-boy> said: "Oh wait! 
Hold up! Shout out to the slave masters! Without them we'd still be in Africa. 
We wouldn't be here to get this ice and tattoos."

The stars were answering questions based on the Proust Questionnaire, a series 
of questions popularised by French writer Marcel Proust. An adapted version 
appears regularly in Vanity Fair magazine.

"I thought [the Proust Questionnaire] would be a way to get beyond image and 
into who they really are," wrote Touré on hisDaily Beast blog 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-10-30/a-rapper-salutes-the-slave-trade/>
. "Most of the guys gave good, thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive answers."

The rapper's fans have claimed Soulja Boy's youth as an excuse, although many 
bloggers have been more critical. As 4 Cryin Out Loud asks, "How old was Ice 
Cube when he first emerged and was writing rhymes for Eazy - like 16?"
