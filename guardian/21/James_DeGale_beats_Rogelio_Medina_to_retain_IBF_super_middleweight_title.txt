The Briton was in control for the majority of the 12 rounds but ultimately 
failed in his pre-fight promise of a knockout, instead taking victory on a 
unanimous decision, with a 115-113 and two 117-111 cards.

It looked as if it would be a short evening’s work for DeGale after some 
dazzling early rounds but his Mexican opponent showed incredible durability to 
stay in the bout, taking punishment throughout.

Medina improved as it went on and briefly flirted with the idea of causing an 
upset as DeGale failed to get the job done, although the judges eventually 
scored heavily in the champion’s favour.

DeGale extends his winning record to 23-1 and held up his part of the bargain 
before a potential unification fight with the WBC champion, Badou Jack.

“He’s a very tough fighter, he has obviously got a lot stronger and better 
over the last year and a half,” DeGale told Sky Sports 2. “But skills pay the 
bills.

“I’m a bit disappointed. I should be taking out people like Medina, that’s no 
disrespect to him, but I’m still learning. But the main thing is I am still 
champ. I’ve got to work on things still.”
