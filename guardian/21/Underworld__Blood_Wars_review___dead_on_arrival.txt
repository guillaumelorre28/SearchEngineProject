Only diehard fans will have kept count of how many films there have been in 
the Underworld series – this is the fifth – and even they will be increasingly 
hard pressed to tell them apart.Underworld: Blood Wars shares the same sooty 
palette, the same slice-and-dice aerial action sequences and it proves, yet 
again, that nobody can kick ass in a breathable PVC bodysuit quite likeKate 
Beckinsale <https://www.theguardian.com/film/kate-beckinsale>.

The war between the vampires and Lycans rages on. In this instalment, the 
tables have turned. The Lycans have spent the intervening period stockpiling 
increasingly sophisticated weaponry. The vampires, meanwhile, seem to have been 
concentrating on internecine treachery and grooming products. Death-dealer 
Selene (Beckinsale) has been cast out by her own kind after killing a vampire, 
but in desperation, the committee of vampire elders reaches out to her to train 
their fighters. Not all, however, have noble motives and not all can forgive 
and forget. This slick, violent but insubstantial picture will sate existing 
fans but has little chance of connecting with new ones.
