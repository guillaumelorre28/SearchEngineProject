That left North Melbourne, Geelong, Richmond, St Kilda and West Coast Eagles 
disappointed.

The remaining men’s teams – Sydney, Hawthorn, Port Adelaide, Gold Coast and 
Essendon – did not enter a submission.

AFL chairman Mike Fitzpatrick confirmed the five teams missing out would be 
granted provisional licences, with a view to possible expansion as early as 
2018.

“Our game is on the cusp of changing forever and changing for the better,” 
Fitzpatrick said at the announcement at the MCG.

“The concept of a national competition has been put together in short space of 
time but this day has been a long time coming.


“The number of women and girls playing club football has doubled over the past 
five years.”

Details of the format of the competition were to be discussed later on 
Wednesday.

Melbourne captain Daisy Pearce said: “We’ve seen on so many issues that sport 
is a powerful vehicle. To see women out there playing a really physical sport, 
at our most powerful, will [encourage change] across all of society.”

The women’s competition will run for eight weeks, in February and March 2017.
