The Tottenham defender Ramon Vega has joined Celtic on loan until the end of 
the season and could earn a permanent move if he impresses his new manager 
Martin O'Neill.

The 29-year-old Switzerland international, who recently lost his Spurs place 
to the 20-year-old Alton Thelwell, could make his Celtic debut at home to 
Aberdeen today.

Celtic have taken over Vega's Spurs contract, which expires in the summer. "He 
is free to speak to anyone he wants in January and it is the little period 
before Christmas that is important to us," O'Neill said. "Then after the break 
we will take it on from there."

Celtic have defensive injury problems as they prepare for five matches before 
the winter break. Vega's time at White Hart Lane was badly affected by injuries 
but O'Neill said: "Hopefully that's behind him."

Watford's manager Graham Taylor has signed Carlton Palmer on a three-month 
loan from Coventry. The midfielder won all 18 of his England caps under Taylor 
and arrives as Watford look to end a run of five successive defeats.

"I am looking for what I consider to be leaders," Taylor said. "This kind of 
player and person is more and more difficult to find these days."

Arsenal have sold the Liberian striker Christopher Wreh to the Saudi Arabian 
club Al-Hilal Al Saudi for an undisclosed fee. They have also loaned the 
20-year-old forward Graham Barrett to Bristol Rovers.

The former Leeds goalkeeper Mark Beeney, who retired 18 months ago because of 
an achilles problem, has joined the Conference side Doncaster.

Uefa has finalised rules that will allow it to force clubs found guilty of 
promoting or allowing racist behaviour to play matches behind closed doors. 
"This is a very strong signal that Uefa is not willing to show leniency when 
these incidents occur," said Uefa's general secretary Gerhard Aigner.

Cowdenbeath have sacked their manager Peter Cormack after only 10 days in 
which he did not take charge of a match. The club said it would not discuss the 
reasons because the matter could go to an industrial tribunal.

Greenock Morton have been put into administration by their owner Hugh Scott. 
The Scottish Football Association is to investigate Arbroath after the club 
fielded two ineligible players in a Scottish Cup first-round game against
