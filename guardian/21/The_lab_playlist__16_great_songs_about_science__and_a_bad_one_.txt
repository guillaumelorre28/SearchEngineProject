It’s the year 2033, and human beings have forgotten how to have sex; this is 
the premise behind one of the late Starman’s finest sci-fi singles. Also worthy 
of mention areTVC15 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFO323uDkSQ>, about a man 
cuckolded by a television, and of courseSpace Oddity 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYMCLz5PQVw>, in which the astronaut Major Tom 
loses touch with planet Earth forever.

Not all astronomical activity is thrilling, as Robert Smith reminds us in this 
gloomy tale of romantic disappointment. The song recalls his experience of 
watching the remnants ofthe Shoemaker-Levy comet crashing into Jupiter in 1994 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiLNxZbpP20>: a much-anticipated cosmic event 
at the time. “Was that it?” asks Smith’s love-interest, “kinda wasn’t quite 
what I’d hoped for”.

Diana Ross - Chain Reaction

Despite the chemistry-suggesting title, the reactions taking place in this 
Motown classic are decidedly biological, dealing with what we might delicately 
call experiments in carnal cause-and-effect. “Nature has a way of yielding 
pleasure”, Ross reassures us, semi-scientifically. Written by the Bee Gees, it 
surely ranks as one of the filthiest songs to becovered by Steps 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsuRgxsd6bk>.

This moving, celebratory single from ‘Hounds of Love’ is inspired by the 
Austrian radical scientistWilhelm Reich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/wilhelm-reich-free-love-orgasmatron>
. Having been a respected psychoanalyst, Reich’s psychosexual experiments 
became increasingly eccentric, and in the 1950s he invented a ‘cloudbuster’, a 
machine designed to induce rain. Bush tells the story from the perspective of 
Reich’s son, Peter, recalling his father’s eventual arrest.

Blackalicious - Chemical Calisthenics

Gift of Gab, the verbally agile rapper in the hip-hop duo Blackalicious, takes 
the listener on a kaleidoscopic journey round the periodic table in this track 
from 2002’s ‘Blazing Arrow’. The dizzying catalogue of of chemistry-inspired 
metaphor includes the confusing assertion: “You’re on trans iridium, if you’re 
always uranium; molecules, spontaneous combustion, pow!”

The 1999 album ‘The Soft Bulletin’ contains numerous dreamy experiments in 
scientific speculation, including this so-called ‘Untested Hypothesis 
Suggesting That the Chemical [In Our Brains] by Which We Are Able to Experience 
the Sensation of Being in Love Is the Same Chemical That Caused the “Big Bang” 
That Was the Birth of the Accelerating Universe’. The song itself is a 
typically wide-eyed and questing reverie.

In 2011 the Icelandic innovator released ‘Biophilia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/09/bjork-biophilia-review>’; an 
album comprised of profoundly science-influenced meditations, with each track 
accompanied by an immersive mobile-app. Other tracks tackled quantum physics, 
conservation and crystallography, while ‘Mutual Core’ considers plate 
tectonics; an area not often addressed in rock music. “What you resist, 
persists”, warns the knowing, sensual vocalist.

Kate and Anna McGarrigle - NaCl

Kate McGarrigle, that late figurehead of folk royalty, wrote NaCl for the 1978 
album Pronto Monto. Rather than applying science to human love, as other 
songwriters on this list have, McGarrigle does the reverse, telling the story 
of the romantic courtship of a chlorine and a sodium atom, who marry and become 
sodium chloride. “Think of the love you eat”, she sings, “when you salt your 
meat.”

Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Higgs Boson Blues

“I’m goin’ down to Geneva, baby”, whispers Cave threateningly, presumably en 
route to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The song was written after the 2012 
discovery of the ‘god particle’, and beckons us into a skewed and ghoulish 
dystopia where physics seems somehow unreliable, and fact and fiction are 
blurred.

Josh Ritter - The Temptation of Adam

One of Ritter’s great story-songs, The Temptation of Adam tells of a love 
affair between two scientists inside an underground atomic weapons silo, 
peppered with nuclear physics-related wordplay. “Our love would live a 
half-life on the surface” fears the increasingly-mournful narrator, as he 
considers pressing the “great big button” to ensure their love will never die.




Ella Fitzgerald - How High the Moon

Nancy Hamilton’s jazz standard, sung energetically by Ella Fitzgerald 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ella-fitzgerald>, expresses love as a 
condition of cosmic wonder and uncertainty, staring at the moon in child-like 
bafflement. Though not the most factually knowledgeable song on the list - 
“does it reach to Mars?” asks Ella - it articulates that most important 
scientific characteristic: curiosity.

Jarvis Cocker - Quantum Theory

“Somewhere everyone is happy”, sings Jarvis on his first solo album 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/oct/15/shopping.popandrock>, “somewhere 
fish do not have bones”. He thereby expresses the poignancy of the multiverse: 
a perfect world exists somewhere among infinite inaccessible alternatives, but 
that knowledge is scant consolation to Jarvis Cocker, struggling with 
disappointment, grief, and presumably a few too many bones in his haddock.

During the naughties, the always-lovable indie duo TMBG turned their hands to 
making educational albums for children, explaining literacy and numeracy in 
cheerful and irreverent terms. The third such album was ‘Here Comes Science’, 
and featured this catchy number - the only song on our list to feature the word 
‘pachycephalosaurus’.

Arcade Fire - Reflektor

Worrying about the dangers of technological progress has become something of a 
hobby-horse for the Québécois rockers, and their latest album,Reflektor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/27/arcade-fire-reflektor-review>, 
continued this vein. Its title single (with a spooky backing-vocal from Bowie 
himself) decried the narcissism and alienation brought about by the internet 
age. “We’re so connected”, the song agonises, “but are we even friends?”

Joanna Newsom - Emily

Emily, the first of only five tracks on Newsom’s second album 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/oct/15/shopping.classicalmusicandopera>
, is a yearning, 12-minute love-letter to her sister Dr Emily Newsom, an 
astrophysicist. The long, meandering song expresses Joanna’s abject amazement 
at Emily’s brilliance, and the strange divisions between them as artist and 
scientist respectively. During the chorus, Newsom wrongly defines the word 
‘meteoroid’, illustrating her failure to fully grasp her sister’s knowledge -
fans are divided <http://drownedinsound.com/community/boards/music/1359079> 
over whether or not the error is deliberate.

The scientist Simon Singh rewrote the lyrics to Katie Melua’s Nine Million 
Bicycles <https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/sep/30/highereducation.uk>
, after he objected to her suggestion that the estimated size of the universe 
was “a guess”. Very sportingly, Melua agreed to re-record the offending lyrics 
for the Today programme, including the line “with the available information I 
predict that I will always be with you”.

And finally...

Last month, the Georgia rapper decided that the Earth was flat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/25/bob-rapper-flat-earth-twitter>, 
tweeting that humanity had been ‘tremendously deceived’. A rap-battled ensued 
between him and outraged TV scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson, which resulted in 
this maniacal regurgitation of conspiracy theories - a rare example of 
anti-science in music. “Use your common sense!” he urges, before pledging his 
support forDavid Irving <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/irving>, the noted 
holocaust-denier.
