Barcelona made smooth progress in their bid for a fourth Copa del Rey triumph 
in eight years when Munir el Haddadi and Neymar struck in a 2-1 success at
Athletic Bilbao <https://www.theguardian.com/football/athleticbilbao> in their 
quarter-final, first leg on Wednesday.

Barça have beaten Bilbao three times in the final since 2009, including last 
season, and the Spanish and European champions made light of the absence of 
Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez to gain the upper hand before the return game at 
the Nou Camp in a week’s time.

Messi was rested as a precaution after he had to come off at half-time in 
Sunday’s 6-0 victory at home to Bilbao in La Liga and Suárez was suspended for 
his part in a fracas after the last 16, first-leg game at Espanyol.

Bilbao, who had their goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz sent off in the fourth minute 
on Sunday

, made a strong start at their San Mames stadium in the Basque country but fell 
behind following a flowing Barça move in the 18th minute.

Arda Turan sent Ivan Rakitic clear down the right and his perfectly executed 
cross was turned past the Bilbao goalkeeper Iago Herrerín by Munir, his fifth 
in the competition this term.

Slapstick defending allowed Barça to make it 2-0 seven minutes later. Herrerín 
fluffed a clearance and Aymeric Laporte slipped over, leaving Neymar to tap the 
ball into an empty net.

The Barça goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen pulled off a fine reaction save to 
keep out Sabin Merino’s 81st-minute header but Bilbao pulled a goal back a 
minute from time.

The forward Aritz Aduriz found space in the penalty area and his first-time 
shot flew into the corner.

Ter Stegen had to be alert again a minute later to deal with a deflected 
effort that he tipped over the bar.

“The Bilbao goal could complicate the tie but we played a great game and now 
we have to close it out in the return,” Neymar told Spanish television.

“But their goal could be dangerous as they are a good team with players who 
can be decisive,” added the Brazil forward. “So we will have to be careful.“
