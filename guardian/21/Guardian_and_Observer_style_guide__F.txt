 F - style guide illustrations Photograph: Jakob Hinrichs 

Fàbregas, Cesc
a Catalan, not Spanish, name; note the accent

facade
no cedilla

Facebook
no need to call it “the social networking site” every time – we know what it is

facelift

factchecker, factchecking

factoid
not a trivial fact, but a mistaken assumption repeated so often that it is 
believed to be true (a word coined by Norman Mailer, who defined it as 
“something that everyone knows is true, except it ain’t!”)

FA Cup
the Cup (the cap C is hallowed by convention); all other cups lc at second 
mention

fahrenheit
use in brackets, without degree symbol, after celsius figure, eg 37C (98.6F); 
to convert, multiply the celsius temperature by 1.8, then add 32; 
alternatively, double the celsius figure, subtract one-tenth of that figure, 
and add 32; or you could save yourself the bother by using a conversion website

Fáilte Ireland
Ireland’s tourism authority

Fairtrade
The Fairtrade mark is a certification system run by the Fairtrade Foundation; 
products are entitled to be called Fairtrade (cap F) if they meet the following 
criteria: a price that covers producers’ costs, a premium for producers to 
invest in their communities, and long-term and more direct trading relations; 
fair trade refers to the movement as a whole, eg only fair trade will enable 
farmers in developing countries to become self-sufficient

fairytale
noun and adjective; but fairy story

faith schools
may be called religious schools without fear of divine retribution

“Fake Sheikh”

falafel

fallopian tubes

fallout

Falluja

families
word favoured by politicians to make them sound caring and concerned 
(“hard-working families”), which doesn’t mean we have to do so, as in this 2010 
Guardian splash headline: “Families face nuclear tax on power bills”.

As a reader pointed out: “So don’t older people, single people, etc, face the 
same tax? ... the implicit attitude [is] that those not part of families are of 
secondary significance.” Quite

family-size, fun-size
not family-sized, fun-sized

famous, famously
If something’s famous, you don’t need to tell people; if you need to tell 
people something’s famous, it isn’t.

“Famously” is typically used to mean one of two things:

I know everyone knows this, but I can’t think of an original way to start so I 
am going to say it anyway.
Harold Macmillan, asked what the biggest challenge is for any leader, famously 
replied: “Events, my dear boy, events.”

You don’t know this? I do. That shows I am clever and know lots of stuff you 
don’t.
Reich famously declined to continue in academia, preferring to support himself 
via a series of blue-collar jobs.

From a reader: “Please can you rein in the many writers who insist on dropping 
the word famously into their copy ... as in famously overused, famously 
redundant or famously not really famous at all.”

A preferable alternative to “famously” is “memorably”, which at least suggests 
that you remember it, rather than assuming that everyone does or should

fanbase, fanbelt, fanclub, fanmail

Faragists
if you describe Ukip supporters in this way (not Farageists, even though they 
are followers of Nigel Farage)

far away
adverb; faraway adjective: she moved to a faraway place, and now lives far away

failure)

(eg farther away, the farthest point north): “a few miles farther, and we will 
reach the farthest point”.

further and furthest are the comparative and superlative of far as in degree 
(eg further discussion, the candidate furthest to the left)

fascism, fascist
not facism, facist, careless but common errors

fashion
collections should be spelled out with slashes (spring/summer 2014 or 
autumn/winter 2013) everywhere except captions and web furniture, where SS14 
and AW13 are acceptable if necessary.

companies are singular: Temperley has presented full-length silk gowns; Dolce 
& Gabbana is hiring a new chief financial officer, etc.

fashion weeks like this: London fashion week, Milan fashion week, etc

fast track
noun; fast-track verb

fatal
deadly; fateful momentous
“The fateful game arrived. It was to prove fatal for Wednesday’s hopes of 
promotion”

fatality
a fatality is worse than death, and like most euphemisms best avoided

fat cats
should be used sparingly, even if writing about overweight moggies

father of two, mother of two
etc (no hyphens); only describe people in this way if relevant

Father’s Day

fatwa
an edict, not necessarily a death sentence

fayre
a fete worse than death

fazed
overwhelmed; phased stage
“Everything seemed to faze him, but it was just a phase”


FBI
Federal Bureau of Investigation; no need to spell out

FDA
what the former First Division Association now calls itself; you will need to 
say it is the senior civil servants’ union or no one will know who you are 
talking about; note that FDA also stands for the US food and drug administration

fedayeen
Arab fighters (the word means those who risk their lives for a cause); can be 
capped up when referring to a specific force, eg the Saddam Fedayeen militia, 
which fought coalition forces in the 2003 Iraq war

Federal Reserve
at first reference, the Fed thereafter

fed up with

female genital mutilation
not “female circumcision”

ferment or foment?
You ferment alcohol, but foment unrest

ferris wheel
no need for a cap F, although the first was built by George Washington Gale 
Ferris Jr for the World’s Fair in Chicago in 1893

Edinburgh festival fringe, London jazz festival, etc

fete
no accent

Spell out from one to nine; numerals from 10 to 999,999; thereafter 1m, 3.2bn

rather than firstly, secondly, thirdly, etc; spell out up to ninth, then 10th,

(the clue is in the name); the second floor is the one above that

first-hand

first lady

first minister

first name, forename, given name
not Christian name. 

Use one on first mention, but not subsequently, except for people under 18.

Avoid just initials, unless that is how a person is known – TS Eliot, DBC 
Pierre, etc.

In stories about more than one member of a family, for example where two 
brothers appear in a court case, first names can be used to distinguish between 
them.

Occasionally, using first names in features or interviews will strike the most 
appropriate tone

first world war, second world war

fission or fusion?
In nuclear fission, the nucleus of an atom splits to produce two smaller 
elements often releasing free subatomic particles and energy.
In nuclear fusion, two or more atomic nuclei come together and combine. In the 
process some of their mass is converted into large amounts of energy. Fusion is 
the reaction that powers the sun

fit for purpose
cliche that quickly proved itself unfit for the purpose of good writing

fit the bill
not fill the bill

FKA twigs
Do not abbreviate to “twigs” on second mention

flagship
a flagship is a ship, a “flagship store” would be a store where one bought 
flagships, and a “flagship local authority” is a cliche

flak
not flack

flammable
rather than inflammable (although, curiously, they mean the same thing); the 
negative is non-flammable

flash memory
computer memory that can be erased and reprogrammed, used for example in 
mobile phones, digital cameras and MP3 players

flashmob

flatmate, flatshare

Flat racing

“flatscreen TV”
All TVs nowadays are flatscreen, so the adjective is unnecessary

flaunt or flout?
to flaunt is to make a display of something, as in flaunting wealth; to flout 
is to show disregard for something, as in flouting the seatbelt law.

Think of Max Bialystock in The Producers admiring a white Rolls-Royce in the 
street: “That’s it, baby, when you’ve got it, flaunt it, flaunt it!” Then think 
of Bialystock and Bloom, his partner, flouting the law – as well as the 
principles of good taste – by staging Springtime for Hitler

fledgling
not fledgeling

flexitime

flip-flops

flood water, flood waters
but rainwater, wastewater

floor
Normally indoors, apart from in expressions such as forest floor and ocean 
floor. If, say, a policeman knocks you over, you fall on to the ground, not the 
floor, although you might say you have been floored.

In the UK, the ground floor is at street level and the first floor is one 
level up

Florence + the Machine
not “and” or “&”

flotation
whether in a tank, or on the stock market

(originally a variant of jettison) is stuff that has been thrown overboard.

abbreviation of forecastle, and a surviving entry from the 1928 “Style-book of 
the Manchester Guardian”

font
receptacle for baptism, digital file (originally a foundry) that contains a 
typeface;fount of all knowledge and wisdom

food bank

foodie

foolproof

foot-and-mouth disease

footie
abbreviation for football, but note that in Australia (particularly Victoria), 
footy is what they call Australian rules football

for all its worth
but for what it’s worth
The former means for all (of) its worth (of is implied), as in for all (of) 
its value; the latter is a contraction of for all it is worth

forbear
refrain; forebear ancestor: “I forbear from blaming my forebears for my 
family’s lack of ambition”

foreign accents
Use accents on French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Irish Gaelic words – 
and, if at all possible, on people’s names in any language, eg Sven-Göran 
Eriksson (Swedish), Béla Bartók (Hungarian). This may be tricky in the case of 
some languages but we have had complaints from readers that it is disrespectful 
to foreign readers to, in effect, misspell their names

foreign names
The French (or French origin) de or le and the Dutch van are normally 
lowercase when the name is full out: eg Charles de Gaulle, Graeme le Saux, 
Giovanni van Bronckhorst; but De Gaulle, Le Saux, Van Bronckhorst when written 
without forenames.

Note that the Belgian president of the European council is Herman Van Rompuy 
(uppercase V), and the French Front National leaders are Marine Le Pen and 
Jean-Marie Le Pen (uppercase L).


The Italian De or Di is normally uppercase, eg Antonio Di Natale

Foreign Office
abbreviated to FCO not FO, as its official name is Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office

foreign placenames
Style for foreign placenames evolves with common usage. Leghorn has become 
Livorno, and maybe one day München will supplant Munich, but not yet. Remember 
that many names have become part of the English language: Geneva is the English 
name for the city that Switzerland’s French speakers refer to as Genève and its 
German speakers call Genf.

Accordingly, we opt for locally used names, with these main exceptions (the 
list is not exhaustive, apply common sense): Archangel, Basel, Berne, Brittany, 
Catalonia, Cologne, Dunkirk, Florence, Fribourg, Genoa, Gothenburg, Hanover, 
Kiev, Lombardy, Milan, Munich, Naples, Normandy, Nuremberg, Padua, Piedmont, 
Rome, Sardinia, Seville, Sicily, Syracuse, Turin, Tuscany, Venice, Zurich.

The late Muammar Gaddafi renamed Libya “The Great Socialist People’s Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriyya”, but it never really caught on


foreign secretary

foreign words and phrases
Italicise, with roman translation in brackets, if it really is a foreign word 
or phrase and not an anglicised one, in which case it is roman with no accents 
(exceptions: exposé, lamé, paté, résumé, roué). Remember Orwell: do not use a 
foreign word where a suitable English equivalent exists

forensic
is not a synonym for scientific. It derives from forum (Latin for court) and 
that is what it means: all evidence in court is forensic. A forensic scientist 
is one whose work is done for legal purposes (so a page 1 headline in which we 
referred to “new forensic evidence” should have said “new scientific 
evidence”). Forensic medicine means medical jurisprudence


foresee, foreseeable

forests
take initial capital, eg Black Forest, Epping Forest, New Forest

forest fires
in the UK; elsewhere, use the term that is most common, eg bushfires in 
Australia, wildfires in the US. If you’re not sure about other countries, use 
wildfires as the default

forever
continually: he is forever changing his mind

for ever
for always: I will love you for ever

for free
avoid: we said police recruits might be forced to work “for free”; it would 
have been more elegant to say “for nothing”

forgo
go without; past tense forwent, past participle forgone

forego
go before; forego, past tense forewent, past participle foregone (as in 
“foregone conclusion”)

forklift truck

formally
in a formal manner; formerly in the past: “He formerly dressed formally, but 
now he’s a slob.”

Everyone knows this, but they are frequently mixed up

former Soviet republics
These are: 

Armenia adjective Armenian 
Azerbaijan adjective Azerbaijani (though there are ethnic Azeris in, eg, 
Armenia)
Belarus adjective Belarusian 
Estonia adjective Estonian (Estonia did not join the Commonwealth of 
Independent States)
Georgia adjective Georgian 
Kazakhstan adjective Kazakh 
Kyrgyzstan adjective Kyrgyz 
Latvia adjective Latvian (not in the commonwealth) 
Lithuania adjective Lithuanian (not in the commonwealth) 
Moldova adjective Moldovan 
Russia adjective Russian 
Tajikistan adjective Tajik 
Turkmenistan adjective Turkmen (its citizens are Turkmen, singular Turkman) 
Ukraine adjective Ukrainian (not “the Ukraine”) 
Uzbekistan adjective Uzbek

Formica
TM

formula
plural formulas, but formulae in a scientific context

Formula One
in copy; F1 is fine in headlines and standfirsts

fortuitous
by chance, not by good fortune. The same football commentators who ruled that 
deflections must always be described as “wicked” also decided that fortunate or 
lucky does not sound as impressive as fortuitous.


If we use the word correctly, it is entirely fortuitous


fosbury flop

founder or flounder?
A business will typically founder (think of a sinking ship) because its 
managers flounder (think of a drowning man)

fount
(not font) of knowledge

organisation has decided to style itself “fpa” (lc, no definite article) in its 
literature and on its website

FRA
fellow of the Royal Academy; FRS fellow of the Royal Society

fractions
two-thirds, five-eighths, etc, but two and a half, three and three-quarters, 
etc.

However, use 1⁄3, 3⁄4 in tables, recipes, etc.

Do not mix fractions and percentages in the same story

 français, Français
le français is the French language, le Français the French man 

Frankenstein
the monster’s creator, not the monster

Frankenstein food
has become a cliche to describe GM food; do not use

Frappuccino
TM

fraud squad

freedom of information
 But Freedom of Information Act. FoI when abbreviated

freefall

free rein
as in giving free rein to one’s ideas – the expression comes from holding a 
horse’s reins loosely

free schools
Even if you disapprove of them, there is no need to use quotation marks or 
call them “so-called free schools” in news stories.

Free schools are outside local authority oversight, not “local authority 
control”. No schools are directly under local authority control, although local 
authorities oversee admissions and standards at some schools

french fries, french horn, french kiss, french letter, french polish, french 
toast, french window

French Guiana
an overseas département of France on the Caribbean coast of South America; do 
not confuse with Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, or Guinea-Bissau, which are all in 
Africa, or Guyana, which is also in South America

French Revolution

Freud, Lucian
British artist, not Lucien

fRoots
folk and roots music magazine. Do not delete the f

frostbite, frostbitten

FTSE 100

fuchsia
a word frequently misspelt (in the Guardian and elsewhere) as “fuschia”; it 
may help to note that it is named after a botanist called Fuchs

fuck
not “a good, honest old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon word” (as it is often described) 
because there is no such thing as an Anglo-Saxon word (they spoke Old English) 
and, more important, its first recorded use dates from 1278.
Use only when relevant, typically when quoting someone; can be spelt out in 
full, although “the F-word” offers an alternative

See swearwords 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-s#swearwords>

fuel
overused as a verb, although handy in headlines

Fulbright scholarship
not Fullbright

fulfil, fulfilling, fulfilment

“full-time mother”
(or for that matter “full-time father”) should be avoided, as it implies that 
parents who go to work aren’t full-time parents

fulsome
Not a fancy word for full, it indicates cloying, lavish excess, as in this 
eloquent description in the London Review of Books, by Rosemary Hill, of books 
about the Queen Mother: “His biography was pious to a degree and, like his 
equally fulsome edition of her letters, much too long.”

This sorely misused word is most often seen in the phrase “fulsome praise”, 
which should not be used in a complimentary sense

fundraiser, fundraising

fungus
plural fungi
