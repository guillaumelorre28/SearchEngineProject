The parliamentary party needs to understand it can’t - and shouldn’t - oust 
Corbyn by force. As such, it will need to reconcile itself to the new status 
quo, which is very different to that of the previous two decades.

Equally, the Corbyn camp has some major introspection to do. Rebellious MPs 
aside, their main problem is public perception. While the PLP can help this by 
not constantly undermining their own leader, Corbyn needs to be more proactive.

Instead of letting his movement fall constant victim to media narratives, he 
needs to be confident and extrovert, embrace his own humour and humanity. It 
may be that too much damage has been done, and that Corbyn really is now 
unelectable.
This may be a reality his camp will have to accept, and discussions may need 
to begin to find a successor, allowing Jeremy to step down on his own terms.

‘Things can’t go on like this’


I don’t see how the current situation is viable. What happens if May does call 
a snap election or if some Brexit-related crisis provides her with an ideal 
pretext? Do 80% of the parliamentary party seek reelection on the basis that 
they don’t think their leader is very good, they’ve tried to get rid of him but 
in the meantime would we mind making him prime minister?


Given that the party is so deeply and fatally divided I think it might as well 
split. I don’t think it will happen, they’ll struggle on to the bitter end, but 
I’d like to see the 172 MPs who voted against Corbyn resign the whip and form a 
new ‘Real Labour’ or ‘Social Democratic Labour’ grouping at Parliament.I 
suspect they would have the majority ofLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> voters behind them.

 ‘Corbyn has inspired me to get involved in politics’ Photograph: Tamsin Collett
I am not part of a rabble, nor a thug, nor an internet troll. I am a poor 
postgraduate student who has been let down immensely by previous governments, 
and who is sick of young people being left out of political debate. Corbyn has 
inspired me to get involved in politics more than anyone before him, with his 
fairness and kindness and his policies that really are looking out for 
everyone, not just himself.


The PLP should unite around their leader and get back to doing what they 
should be doing, which is fighting the Tories. The government has made a lot of 
mistakes this year, and yet because the party seems to prefer fighting their 
own leader than doing their jobs, the Tories have been let off scot free. They 
need to focus on proving that the government is not doing what is best for 
everyone, and showing the country that their solutions are better and worth 
voting for.

 ‘I want working class people to become MPs’. Photograph: Karen Bell 
I voted for Jeremy because I trust him to lead the party to victory in the 
next election. The British population has lurched to the left since the 2008 so 
called ‘credit crunch’. People have seen that austerity has not worked, 
inequality had got worse, employment has become more precarious, mental health 
is declining and so on. We no longer believe that there is no alternative to 
the same old policies of the past.

Those in the party who find it impossible to be led by someone whose views are 
strongly opposed to theirs will have to leave, as I had to leave the party when 
it was led by Blair.


There are plenty of people who would take their place should they decide to 
leave. Corbyn wants to train up working class people to become MPs. I welcome 
that. We need people who can represent the vast majority of people in this 
country, who have an idea of what our lives are like and who are motivated by 
the desire to make a difference - that is, to change the way things are.

‘A new form of politics is emerging’


With progressive parties like Syriza and Podemos, as well as the movements in 
the US around Bernie Sanders’ campaign to win the Democratic nomination, a new 
form of politics is emerging.

As a society we have two choices - pander to ideologies that support the 
capitalistic status quo and the idea that ‘national sovereignty’ will provide 
for the needs of our citizens - or reject such introspection and look to a more 
diverse and inclusive set of ideas that recognise that real progress is in the 
struggle of a whole range of global communities that are taking on the big 
corporations at source.


For me Mr Corbyn is closer to the second of these ideas and his “electability” 
to a leadership role in Westminster, while desirable, is not the be all and end 
all. It’s the movement of peoples that put him there that will sustain progress 
over and above the fate of any one personality.

I didn’t vote for a man, I voted for an approach: a human, reasoned, 
principled approach to politics that doesn’t rely on how polished your speeches 
are, or which school you attended, but on the experiences of people who are 
impacted by policy.

Despite how much I yearn for the same change in how politics is run as Jeremy, 
he has some pretty major flaws when it comes to execution. He and his team need 
to focus on improving their media strategy and invite his detractors to be a 
part of the change of the Labour party from an elitist, technocratic party to a 
participatory social democratic movement.

‘Let’s not vilify those who didn’t vote for Jeremy’

 ‘I wouldn’t support deselection’. Photograph: James Wood 
I am desperately worried about how fragmented the opposition to the government 
is. While we squabble among ourselves, May and her colleagues will get away 
with imposing more and more draconian policies that will serve to damage the 
most vulnerable.

The coup was launched at a ridiculous time and, while I wouldn’t support 
deselection, those MPs who have been against Jeremy since day one really need 
to think long and hard about how they’re acting.


I would offer this appeal to those who also voted for Jeremy: let’s not vilify 
those who did not.


There are some among his supporters who are unwilling to accept any criticism 
of him whatsoever and I don’t think this is the right thing to do in order for 
us to stand any chance of winning the next election. This attitude of ‘you’re 
either with us or against us’ really has to stop.

I truly hope that the party unites. I feel that Corbyn is genuine and can be 
trusted, but I do recognise that he is not perfect - the PLP are probably not 
without cause for their dislike for him, this is why he will need to recognise 
where he needs to change.

I don’t know if Corbyn can win a general election, but for the first time in 
as long as I can remember there is, at least, a choice.

The members are not deluded or without their own doubts. We are also not 
extremists as we are often portrayed. It hurts when I read articles that accuse 
us of anti-semitism, sexism and of not wanting to win.

Whenever I see comments that are from Corbyn supporters that are aggressiveor 
threatening, I feel ashamed. I also know that they are not the majority and 
there are people like this everywhere.

‘Theresa May must be feeling very cheerful’

 ‘I found the whole leadership contest profoundly depressing’. Photograph:

The Labour Party is currently in a perilous state. There has been a failure of 
leadership and as we stand we are unelectable, which means condemning Britain 
to a long period of Tory rule which will hurt the vulnerable the most.Owen Smith
 <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith> was brave to take this 
challenge on and I am proud to have voted for him, even though I found the 
whole leadership contest profoundly depressing. I have always considered myself 
on the left of the party and yet now am a ‘Red Tory’ in the eyes of many.

We have to find a way of coming together, of recovering respect for each 
other. I genuinely do not know how the former shadow cabinet members can return 
to the front bench after all that has gone on. Teresa May must be feeling very 
cheerful indeed.

‘Radical change is necessary in this country’


I voted for Owen Smith. I support most of what Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> says but am worried about 
claims about his ability to get the best out of a ministerial team on a day to 
day basis. Also I think he is too closely associated with the trade union 
movement to be able to really reach out to the country as a whole.

Radical change is necessary in this country. The Brexit decision seems 
symptomatic of this. We are in particular failing to create equal opportunities 
for young people. Now he has won, existing MPs should be ready to support 
Corbyn.
