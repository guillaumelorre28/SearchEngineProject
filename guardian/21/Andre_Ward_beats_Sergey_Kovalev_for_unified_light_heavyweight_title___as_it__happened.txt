“It was the wrong decision,” says Kathy Duva, who promotes Kovalev. “It was 
quite clear it was the wrong decision. Although I think Ward would have a great 
career in the UFC. I haven’t seen so much wrestling since Conor McGregor was 
fighting. Ridiculous.”

Duva says Kovalev will be exercising his rematch clause.

“This is a beautiful thing,” Ward said. “We did it, baby. This is what we set 
out to do. I’m a five-time world champion in two different weight classes. Man, 
it’s amazing.”

Says Ward’s trainer Virgil Hunter: “This is a good feeling. We were a little 
careless with that knockdown in the second round. But we landed the cleaner 
punches. Kovalev was aggressive but not effective. That’s why we won.”

Round 12 (Ward 10-9)

Ward knows he needs the round, probably more. He’s fighting like it. But 
Kovalev is ust too big, too strong. He’s found a second wind and is really 
looking to close the show. Ward does enough to take the round but – at least on 
our unofficial scorecard – it won’t be enough. Waiting on the scores that 
matter.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 9-10 Ward (Kovalev 115-112 Ward)

Round 11 (Kovalev 10-9)

Now it’s Kovalev who is rejuvenated! He lands a series of hard left jabs. He’s 
back to stalking Ward around the ring and has Ward fighting on the back foot 
for the first time in a few rounds. But Ward fires back and it’s going to be a 
close round. Almost too close to call. I’ve got to tip it to Kovalev, who 
landed the harder shots. One more round and the only certainty is, barring a 
knockout, the outcome will be controversial.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 106-102 Ward)

Round 10 (Kovalev 10-9)

More good work from Ward here, working from behind the jab. Some devastating 
two-way action here, both fighters trading serious punches. Ward’s body work 
seems to give him the edge, but it’s Kovalev who bites back in the final 30 
seconds, landing a big shot that moves Ward back. That was the best round of 
the fight and it goes to Kovalev.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 96-93 Ward)

Round 9 (Ward 10-9)

Andre Ward! His jab is finding the target with greater frequency. Kovalev 
appears to be tiring but he’s landing punches and in the fight. Ward with a 
bolo punch! Kovalev clearly frustrated with Ward’s holding. The American is the 
busier and more accurate fighter from bell to bell. The round ends with 
practically all of the 13,310 spectators on their feet!

Round 8 (Ward 10-9)

Another round for Ward, whose current strategy can be accurately summed up as 
punch-and-hold. A bit cynical, but referee Robert Byrd doesn’t seem too overly 
interested in breaking them up. Ward, true to form, is doing whatever it takes. 
Remember, it’s been nearly 20 years since he lost a fight on any level. Ward 
wins it on body shots. Kovalev looking a buit slower and more tentative. This 
could be shaping up for a highly interesting finish.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 9-10 Ward (Kovalev 77-74 Ward)

Round 7 (Ward 10-9)

Best round of the fight for Ward, who caught Kovalev flush with a jab and a 
hook that really brought the crowd back into it. He’s moving well and finding 
the target with crisp shots, working nicely behind the jab. Kovalev seems to be 
slowing a bit here but he rallies late and tags Ward a few times. Not enough to 
steal the round.

Round 6 (Kovalev 10-9)

A left-right combo from Kovalev. Ward jabs to the body to keep Kovalev at bay. 
Ward circling and turning Kovalev as much as possible, but the Russian really 
cutting off the ring effectively. Kovalev just misses with a heat-seeking 
right. Big combination from Kovalev! Ward’s movement so much better here than 
in the opening rounds, but Kovalev did more than enough to take that one.

Round 5 (Ward 10-9)

Some nice work from Ward here. He connects with a jab and a straight right, 
then a body shot. But these punches don’t seem to have any effect on Kovalev, 
who looks so calm and composed. It’s unnerving, really. Lower output from 
Kovalev here. He needs to be careful to not reduce pressure and give Ward any 
confidence. He’s just let Ward nick that round.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 9-10 Ward (Kovalev 49-45 Ward)

Round 4 (Kovalev 10-9)

Ward lunges forward and Kovalev makes him pay with a short counter, then he 
lands an uppercut that snaps Ward’s head back. Kovalev doing this all behind 
the jab. For all the talk of his concussive power, he’s a truly underrated 
boxer. He’s making the most of his reach and moving so well. Ward holding every 
time he goes inside. Another Kovalev round, easier to call than the third.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 40-35 Ward)

Round 3 (Kovalev 10-9)

Ward simply too easy to hit right now. Perhaps the ring rust – he’s fought 
only four times in the last 50 months due to injuries and a promotional spat – 
has something to do with it. But Kovalev is really bullying him around and 
walking him down, moving the fight where he wants. The discrepancy in power is 
really the story of the opening act. Now Ward lunges forward and snaps 
Kovalev’s head back with sharp jab. A very close round, almost too close to 
call – but Kovalev nicks it from my vantage point.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 30-26 Ward)

Round 2 (Kovalev 10-8)

A right hand then a left by Kovalev and Ward staggers backward again. Ward 
trying to work the jab and enjoying modest success. And down goes Ward! A 
left-right combination but it was the concussive right hand that did it! Ward 
smiles as he beats the count but he is hurt and in trouble! He’s saved by the 
bell and the crowd roars in approval. Ward seemingly can’t deal with the power 
of Kovalev, who is applying intelligent pressure.

Round 1 (Kovalev 10-9)

A measured opening as the both men feel one another out. Chants of S-O-G! 
S-O-G! for Ward, a nod to his nickname (Son of God). Ward measuring distance 
and keeping out of range as Kovalev stalks, a predator in wait. Then Kovalev 
lunges forward and connects with a jab – he’s hurt Ward with that jab! – and 
Ward practically doubles over to wrap him up. Ward staggered backward and did 
not take that punch well. A nice uppercut inside by Ward, but that’s a Kovalev 
round as the bell rings. Both fighters trying to operate with the jab but 
Kovalev was dominant with his.

Andre Ward has just made his ringwalk wearing a mostly black poncho. Still 
strange to see a guy who’s been a champion for so long enter the ring first. 
Now it’s Kovalev, wearing a wide smile and trailed by a cluster of seconds 
holding his belts aloft.

Ward closes as a -200 favorite at the MGM Grand sports book, Kovalev at +160.

A pitch-perfect finish to a fairly dreadful undercard 
<https://twitter.com/timdahlberg/status/800190489014116354>: Maurice Hooker and 
Darleys Perez have fought to a split draw that prompts boos from the crowd. One 
judge had it 97-93 for Hooker, another 97-93 to Perez with the third handing 
down a score of 95-95. Now that’s a grim decision. Perez won the fight easily – 
I had it 97-93 – but Hooker is the fancied prospect and Perez is the journeyman 
and you can do the math.

Official scorecard from that Hooker-Perez fight. A robbery in broad daylight.

Consider that Perez landed 146 of 413 punches (35.4%), compared to 104 of 485 
for Hooker (21.4%). Perez even managed to outjab his taller opponent. Sad!

The T-Mobile Arena is starting to fill up as Hooker and Perez plod along into 
the eighth round of their 10-rounder. Lots of boos for Kovalev when he is 
showed on the big screen in his locker room between rounds. There’s little 
doubt who will be the crowd favorite tonight, though I spotted more than a few 
clusters of well-lubricated Kovalev supporters when taking a walk through the 
concourse an hour ago.

Oleksandr Gvozdyk, a fancied light heavyweight prospect from Ukraine, improved 
to 12-0 with 10 knockouts with an eighth-round stoppage of Isaac Chilemba. 
That’s particularly impressive considering Chilemba had gone the distance only 
a few months ago with Kovalev, who had stopped 26 of 30 opponents inside the 
distance before they met. Gvozdyk was busier, connected more frequently and 
landed the harder punches.

“I’m very excited and happy,” said Gvozdyk, who turned pro after winning an 
Olympic bronze medal in London. “What more can I say? This is the best feeling!”

Said a despondent Chilemba: “I am devastated. If I hadn’t hurt my right arm in 
the third round it would have been a completely different outcome. I was in an 
incredible amount of pain from the third round through the rest of the fight.”

Only one more undercard fight before the main event: a 10-round junior 
welterweight tilt between Maurice Hooker and Darleys Perez.

Claressa Shields, who became the first American boxer to win consecutive 
Olympic gold medals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/claressa-shields-boxing-gold-medal-rio-2016-olympics>
 in August, made her professional debut earlier tonight and it was a smashing 
success.The 21-year-old from Michigan cruised to a four-round 
unanimous-decision win over amateur rival Franchon Crews in an entertaining 
fight.

“It feels so good to have just made my pro debut,” said Shields, who landed 76 
of 214 punches (35.5%), compared to 27 of 182 (14.8%) for her opponent. “This 
is what I’ve been training for. I’m faster and I hit harder. And I’m the better 
fighter. But Crews brought 100% and I respect her for that.”

Curtis Stevens opened tonight’s televised pay-per-view undercard with a 
10-round unanimous-decision win over James De La Rosa by scores of 98-90 and 
96-92 (twice).Stevens dropped his opponent in the first and nearly ended it in 
the third, but an apparently injured left hand in the fourth slowed his 
momentum gave De La Rosa a chance to recuperate.

“I give myself a C minus,” said Stevens (29-5, 21 KOs). “Could have thrown my 
jab a little more. I am glad I got the W but I am a little disappointed in 
myself. The jab was good but I could have popped that shit a little more. Hurt 
my left hand in the fourth round. He’s got a hard-ass head. But I am glad I got 
the win.”

Good evening and welcome to tonight’s light heavyweight title fight between 
Sergey Kovalev and Andre Ward. Normally in sports, the best going against the 
best is a matter of routine. It’s kind of the point, really. But there’s 
nothing normal about boxing, where great fighters in or around the same weight 
class in the same era can go their entire careers without facing off for a 
myriad of reasons, none of them particularly compelling. That’s what makes 
tonight’s rare matchup of undefeated fighters in their prime so exceptional. 
Remember all the hand-wringing over how much better last year’s overhyped 
superfight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao would have been if they 
had fought years earlier when they were closer to their physical peaks? 
Consider that if they had fought in January 2011, they would have been 32 and 
33 years old ... the same as Ward and Kovalev tonight.

We’re currently in the eighth fight of a nine-bout undercard leading up to the 
main event, which should go off in about 90 minutes’ time. Here’s a look at the 
results so far.

 * Curtis Stevens UD 10 James De La Rosa, middleweights 
 * Darmani Rock UD 4 Brice Ritani-Coe, heavyweights 
 * Claressa Shields UD 4 Franchon Crews, women’s super middleweights 
 * Tyler McCreary MD 8 Vincent Jennings, featherweights 
 * Sonny Fredrickson UD 8 Gabriel Deluc, junior welterweights 
 * Bakhram Murtazaliev TKO 2 Botirsher Obidov, middleweights 
 * Meirim Nursultanov UD 6 Henry Beckford, middleweights Facebook

Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a look at his take 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/18/andre-ward-sergey-kovalev-boxing-las-vegas>
 on what tonight’s main event could mean to the challenger.

Four years ago, Andre Ward was poised to succeed Floyd Mayweather’s spot as 
the best prizefighter in the world, regardless of weight. The Olympic champion 
from Oakland had cleaned out the talent-stacked super middleweight division 
with a string of clinical victories over Mikkel Kessler, Allan Green, Sakio 
Bika, Arthur Abraham, Carl Froch and Chad Dawson. He offered a fresh-faced 
alternative to Mayweather’s pantomime villain: a happily married devout 
Christian with four children,Michael Jordan’s endorsement 
<http://blog.oregonlive.com/playbooksandprofits/2005/11/a_left_hook_from_jordan.html>
, a level-headed personality and talent to burn.

It was all there for the taking – until it wasn’t. Ward’s clear path to 
mainstream stardom was interrupted by a host of injuries and a promotional spat 
that conspired to limit him to four fights in the last 50 months, during which 
he’s all but disappeared from public consciousness.

That could all change on Saturday night when Ward steps in with current WBA, 
WBO and IBF light heavyweight champion Sergey Kovalev at the T-Mobile Arena in 
Las Vegas. It is the biggest fight of the year, and perhaps the best that can 
be made in boxing today. Both Ward, who is 32, and Kovalev, 33, are undefeated 
and in their primes. Both appear in the top five of virtually every 
pound-for-pound list. It’s the rare high-profile pay-per-view headliner worthy 
of the price tag, even if it’s drawn a sliver of the attention generated by 
last year’s overhyped blockbuster between Mayweather andManny Pacquiao

Kovalev landed 126 of 474 punches (26%), compared to 116 of 337 for Ward 
(34.4%). But the only numbers that matter are 114-113: the score on all three 
official cards.

 <https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/800218137471746048> November 20, 2016
 <https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/800218137471746048>  
“It was the wrong decision,” says Kathy Duva, who promotes Kovalev. “It was 
quite clear it was the wrong decision. Although I think Ward would have a great 
career in the UFC. I haven’t seen so much wrestling since Conor McGregor was 
fighting. Ridiculous.”

Duva says Kovalev will be exercising his rematch clause.
 
“This is a beautiful thing,” Ward said. “We did it, baby. This is what we set 
out to do. I’m a five-time world champion in two different weight classes. Man, 
it’s amazing.”

Says Ward’s trainer Virgil Hunter: “This is a good feeling. We were a little 
careless with that knockdown in the second round. But we landed the cleaner 
punches. Kovalev was aggressive but not effective. That’s why we won.”

 
In a surprise decision, Ward has won a unanimous decision and is the new WBA, 
WBO and IBF light heavyweight champion. All three judges turned in scores of 
114-113. You could hear the reactions of disbelief in the crowd.
 
Ward knows he needs the round, probably more. He’s fighting like it. But 
Kovalev is ust too big, too strong. He’s found a second wind and is really 
looking to close the show. Ward does enough to take the round but – at least on 
our unofficial scorecard – it won’t be enough. Waiting on the scores that 
matter.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 9-10 Ward (Kovalev 115-112 Ward)
 
Now it’s Kovalev who is rejuvenated! He lands a series of hard left jabs. He’s 
back to stalking Ward around the ring and has Ward fighting on the back foot 
for the first time in a few rounds. But Ward fires back and it’s going to be a 
close round. Almost too close to call. I’ve got to tip it to Kovalev, who 
landed the harder shots. One more round and the only certainty is, barring a 
knockout, the outcome will be controversial.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 106-102 Ward)
 
More good work from Ward here, working from behind the jab. Some devastating 
two-way action here, both fighters trading serious punches. Ward’s body work 
seems to give him the edge, but it’s Kovalev who bites back in the final 30 
seconds, landing a big shot that moves Ward back. That was the best round of 
the fight and it goes to Kovalev.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 96-93 Ward)

 
Andre Ward! His jab is finding the target with greater frequency. Kovalev 
appears to be tiring but he’s landing punches and in the fight. Ward with a 
bolo punch! Kovalev clearly frustrated with Ward’s holding. The American is the 
busier and more accurate fighter from bell to bell. The round ends with 
practically all of the 13,310 spectators on their feet!


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 9-10 Ward (Kovalev 86-84 Ward)
 
Another round for Ward, whose current strategy can be accurately summed up as 
punch-and-hold. A bit cynical, but referee Robert Byrd doesn’t seem too overly 
interested in breaking them up. Ward, true to form, is doing whatever it takes. 
Remember, it’s been nearly 20 years since he lost a fight on any level. Ward 
wins it on body shots. Kovalev looking a buit slower and more tentative. This 
could be shaping up for a highly interesting finish.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 9-10 Ward (Kovalev 77-74 Ward)
 
Best round of the fight for Ward, who caught Kovalev flush with a jab and a 
hook that really brought the crowd back into it. He’s moving well and finding 
the target with crisp shots, working nicely behind the jab. Kovalev seems to be 
slowing a bit here but he rallies late and tags Ward a few times. Not enough to 
steal the round.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 9-10 Ward (Kovalev 68-64 Ward)
 
A left-right combo from Kovalev. Ward jabs to the body to keep Kovalev at bay. 
Ward circling and turning Kovalev as much as possible, but the Russian really 
cutting off the ring effectively. Kovalev just misses with a heat-seeking 
right. Big combination from Kovalev! Ward’s movement so much better here than 
in the opening rounds, but Kovalev did more than enough to take that one.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 59-54 Ward)
 
Some nice work from Ward here. He connects with a jab and a straight right, 
then a body shot. But these punches don’t seem to have any effect on Kovalev, 
who looks so calm and composed. It’s unnerving, really. Lower output from 
Kovalev here. He needs to be careful to not reduce pressure and give Ward any 
confidence. He’s just let Ward nick that round.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 9-10 Ward (Kovalev 49-45 Ward)
 
Ward lunges forward and Kovalev makes him pay with a short counter, then he 
lands an uppercut that snaps Ward’s head back. Kovalev doing this all behind 
the jab. For all the talk of his concussive power, he’s a truly underrated 
boxer. He’s making the most of his reach and moving so well. Ward holding every 
time he goes inside. Another Kovalev round, easier to call than the third.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 40-35 Ward)
 
Ward simply too easy to hit right now. Perhaps the ring rust – he’s fought 
only four times in the last 50 months due to injuries and a promotional spat – 
has something to do with it. But Kovalev is really bullying him around and 
walking him down, moving the fight where he wants. The discrepancy in power is 
really the story of the opening act. Now Ward lunges forward and snaps 
Kovalev’s head back with sharp jab. A very close round, almost too close to 
call – but Kovalev nicks it from my vantage point.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 30-26 Ward)
 
A right hand then a left by Kovalev and Ward staggers backward again. Ward 
trying to work the jab and enjoying modest success. And down goes Ward! A 
left-right combination but it was the concussive right hand that did it! Ward 
smiles as he beats the count but he is hurt and in trouble! He’s saved by the 
bell and the crowd roars in approval. Ward seemingly can’t deal with the power 
of Kovalev, who is applying intelligent pressure.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-8 Ward (Kovalev 20-17 Ward)
 
A measured opening as the both men feel one another out. Chants of S-O-G! 
S-O-G! for Ward, a nod to his nickname (Son of God). Ward measuring distance 
and keeping out of range as Kovalev stalks, a predator in wait. Then Kovalev 
lunges forward and connects with a jab – he’s hurt Ward with that jab! – and 
Ward practically doubles over to wrap him up. Ward staggered backward and did 
not take that punch well. A nice uppercut inside by Ward, but that’s a Kovalev 
round as the bell rings. Both fighters trying to operate with the jab but 
Kovalev was dominant with his.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Kovalev 10-9 Ward (Kovalev 10-9 Ward)
 
The fighters are getting their final instructions after being announced. We’ll 
pick it up from here with round-by-round coverage. See you on the other side!
 
Andre Ward has just made his ringwalk wearing a mostly black poncho. Still 
strange to see a guy who’s been a champion for so long enter the ring first. 
Now it’s Kovalev, wearing a wide smile and trailed by a cluster of seconds 
holding his belts aloft.

Ward closes as a -200 favorite at the MGM Grand sports book, Kovalev at +160.

A pitch-perfect finish to a fairly dreadful undercard 
<https://twitter.com/timdahlberg/status/800190489014116354>: Maurice Hooker and 
Darleys Perez have fought to a split draw that prompts boos from the crowd. One 
judge had it 97-93 for Hooker, another 97-93 to Perez with the third handing 
down a score of 95-95. Now that’s a grim decision. Perez won the fight easily – 
I had it 97-93 – but Hooker is the fancied prospect and Perez is the journeyman 
and you can do the math.

Consider that Perez landed 146 of 413 punches (35.4%), compared to 104 of 485 
for Hooker (21.4%). Perez even managed to outjab his taller opponent. Sad!

The T-Mobile Arena is starting to fill up as Hooker and Perez plod along into 
the eighth round of their 10-rounder. Lots of boos for Kovalev when he is 
showed on the big screen in his locker room between rounds. There’s little 
doubt who will be the crowd favorite tonight, though I spotted more than a few 
clusters of well-lubricated Kovalev supporters when taking a walk through the 
concourse an hour ago.
 
Oleksandr Gvozdyk, a fancied light heavyweight prospect from Ukraine, improved 
to 12-0 with 10 knockouts with an eighth-round stoppage of Isaac Chilemba. 
That’s particularly impressive considering Chilemba had gone the distance only 
a few months ago with Kovalev, who had stopped 26 of 30 opponents inside the 
distance before they met. Gvozdyk was busier, connected more frequently and 
landed the harder punches.

“I’m very excited and happy,” said Gvozdyk, who turned pro after winning an 
Olympic bronze medal in London. “What more can I say? This is the best feeling!”

Said a despondent Chilemba: “I am devastated. If I hadn’t hurt my right arm in 
the third round it would have been a completely different outcome. I was in an 
incredible amount of pain from the third round through the rest of the fight.”

Only one more undercard fight before the main event: a 10-round junior 
welterweight tilt between Maurice Hooker and Darleys Perez.

 in August, made her professional debut earlier tonight and it was a smashing 
success.The 21-year-old from Michigan cruised to a four-round 
unanimous-decision win over amateur rival Franchon Crews in an entertaining 
fight.

“It feels so good to have just made my pro debut,” said Shields, who landed 76 
of 214 punches (35.5%), compared to 27 of 182 (14.8%) for her opponent. “This 
is what I’ve been training for. I’m faster and I hit harder. And I’m the better 
fighter. But Crews brought 100% and I respect her for that.”

Curtis Stevens opened tonight’s televised pay-per-view undercard with a 
10-round unanimous-decision win over James De La Rosa by scores of 98-90 and 
96-92 (twice).Stevens dropped his opponent in the first and nearly ended it in 
the third, but an apparently injured left hand in the fourth slowed his 
momentum gave De La Rosa a chance to recuperate.

“I give myself a C minus,” said Stevens (29-5, 21 KOs). “Could have thrown my 
jab a little more. I am glad I got the W but I am a little disappointed in 
myself. The jab was good but I could have popped that shit a little more. Hurt 
my left hand in the fourth round. He’s got a hard-ass head. But I am glad I got 
the win.”

Good evening and welcome to tonight’s light heavyweight title fight between 
Sergey Kovalev and Andre Ward. Normally in sports, the best going against the 
best is a matter of routine. It’s kind of the point, really. But there’s 
nothing normal about boxing, where great fighters in or around the same weight 
class in the same era can go their entire careers without facing off for a 
myriad of reasons, none of them particularly compelling. That’s what makes 
tonight’s rare matchup of undefeated fighters in their prime so exceptional. 
Remember all the hand-wringing over how much better last year’s overhyped 
superfight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao would have been if they 
had fought years earlier when they were closer to their physical peaks? 
Consider that if they had fought in January 2011, they would have been 32 and 
33 years old ... the same as Ward and Kovalev tonight.

We’re currently in the eighth fight of a nine-bout undercard leading up to the 
main event, which should go off in about 90 minutes’ time. Here’s a look at the 
results so far.

 * Curtis Stevens UD 10 James De La Rosa, middleweights 
 * Darmani Rock UD 4 Brice Ritani-Coe, heavyweights 
 * Claressa Shields UD 4 Franchon Crews, women’s super middleweights 
 * Tyler McCreary MD 8 Vincent Jennings, featherweights 
 * Sonny Fredrickson UD 8 Gabriel Deluc, junior welterweights 
 * Bakhram Murtazaliev TKO 2 Botirsher Obidov, middleweights 
 * Meirim Nursultanov UD 6 Henry Beckford, middleweights  
Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a look at his take

 on what tonight’s main event could mean to the challenger.

Four years ago, Andre Ward was poised to succeed Floyd Mayweather’s spot as 
the best prizefighter in the world, regardless of weight. The Olympic champion 
from Oakland had cleaned out the talent-stacked super middleweight division 
with a string of clinical victories over Mikkel Kessler, Allan Green, Sakio 
Bika, Arthur Abraham, Carl Froch and Chad Dawson. He offered a fresh-faced 
alternative to Mayweather’s pantomime villain: a happily married devout 
Christian with four children,Michael Jordan’s endorsement 
<http://blog.oregonlive.com/playbooksandprofits/2005/11/a_left_hook_from_jordan.html>
, a level-headed personality and talent to burn.

It was all there for the taking – until it wasn’t. Ward’s clear path to 
mainstream stardom was interrupted by a host of injuries and a promotional spat 
that conspired to limit him to four fights in the last 50 months, during which 
he’s all but disappeared from public consciousness.

That could all change on Saturday night when Ward steps in with current WBA, 
WBO and IBF light heavyweight champion Sergey Kovalev at the T-Mobile Arena in 
Las Vegas. It is the biggest fight of the year, and perhaps the best that can 
be made in boxing today. Both Ward, who is 32, and Kovalev, 33, are undefeated 
and in their primes. Both appear in the top five of virtually every 
pound-for-pound list. It’s the rare high-profile pay-per-view headliner worthy 
of the price tag, even if it’s drawn a sliver of the attention generated by 
last year’s overhyped blockbuster between Mayweather andManny Pacquiao
