Surrey, December 21 
Rabbits could be seen playing in the meadow at the bottom of the down right up 
to the time when darkness came. There was no evening. The afternoon sky was 
just tinged with a strip of dull red in the west, and this patch of colour 
moved a little towards the north; then it died out. Nothing was visible except 
a planet and a few stars shining faintly, and seemingly very far away. Clouds 
in the higher sky came and completely blotted them; you lost all sense of 
direction; a mist began to spread upward; it was only by the tread of grass 
underfoot you had knowledge of being on the earth at all. The light, cold air 
died away; there seemed to be nothing but a chill, dead vacancy for almost an 
hour. Then a rustle, very slight, came moving along low down, as of something 
creeping over the meadow face. Bending, it was possible to discover that this 
was but the first movement of a light wind, just playing along the grass and 
hardly to be felt a few feet above the ground. But before the top of the down 
could be reached it could be heard sweeping among the elms a few yards on the 
other side; it had driven off the mist, and the great limbs could just be 
perceived swaying now this way and now the other. In the bottom, by the 
farmstead, strangely, a barnyard cock crowed hoarsely and twice, with a long 
pause in between. After another interval a bantam sounded a long shrill note. 
The wind dropped. But this morning it was wild again, scurrying heavy rain 
through the bare hazels. We knew then why the rabbits had been so frolicsome.
