Carwyn Jones <http://www.carwynjonesam.co.uk/>, the first minister of Wales, 
has warned that the UK faces being broken up if the four parliaments are not 
given a final say on any Brexit deal.

Jones, who leads Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> in 
Wales, said his country would not approve any Brexit deal that did not include 
guaranteed access to the single market.

The first minister, who is in the US to strengthen trade links, said he 
believed the interests of Wales were well served by membership of the UK, that 
the UK was better and stronger for encompassingWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales>, a view he claimed was shared by a large 
majority of Welsh people.

He said: “I believe the process of withdrawal must be accompanied by a 
reformed governance of the UK for the long term. There can be no return to the 
old constitutional status quo, where the UK was one of the most centralised 
states in the developed world. But we have to embrace the new reality with 
fresh constitutional thinking if our British union is to survive the new 
tensions created by EU exit.

 “Unless we take this seriously, nothing – up to and including the break-up of 
the UK into its component parts – would be inconceivable. Let me emphasise: 
that is not something I wish to happen. Far from it. But scenarios that seemed 
little more than political fantasies a few years ago could become plausible if 
we fail to make the radical changes necessary to put the UK’s constitution on a 
sustainable footing.”

The position of Jeremy Corbyn on access to the single market came under 
scrutiny this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/jeremy-corbyn-says-uk-should-reject-key-aspects-of-single-market-after-brexit>
 after a senior Labour party source said the leader wanted to ditch some of the 
rules, such as when governments could bail out failing companies, which other 
member countries viewed as integral parts of the single market.

Corbyn clarified his position by releasing a statement in which he said he 
would be “pressing for full access to the European single market” for Britain’s 
firms. But he added: “There are directives and obligations linked to the single 
market, such as state aid rules and requirements to liberalise and privatise 
public services, which we would not want to see as part of a post-Brexit 
relationship.”

Jones said that Wales would suffer economic hardship if it did not have access 
to the single market. He said: “I believe that the interests of Wales and the 
UK were best served by remaining in the EU. The people took a different view, 
albeit by a fairly narrow margin. Of course, I respect the result of the 
referendum. However, I am absolutely clear that Wales is, and will remain, 
‘open for business’.

 “I believe it is absolutely vital that when we leave the EU the UK must 
retain access to the single market. Without that guarantee we risk inflicting 
needless economic harm on our country, and on our citizens.

 “I have absolutely no intention of allowing Wales’ fate to be left to chance, 
for us to be passive observers in this most momentous of decisions. Wales and 
the other devolved nations must play a full and active role in the negotiations 
to leave the EU, to ensure our interests are fully protected.

 “If this becomes a two-way dialogue between Brussels and London it will fail. 
Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast must also have seats at the table. Whatever deal 
is finally negotiated, its acceptance should be subject to the support of the 
four parliaments that now legislate for the UK.

 “I cannot envisage consent being given by Wales unless the UK both secures 
access to the single market and delivers solid assurances to our citizens from 
other EU countries.”
