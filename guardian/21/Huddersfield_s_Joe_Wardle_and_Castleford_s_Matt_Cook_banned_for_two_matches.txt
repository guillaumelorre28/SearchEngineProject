Wardle was punished for the high tackle on the Catalans Dragons prop Rémi 
Casty during the Giants’ 46-26 home defeat by the French club that earned him a 
red card. He will now sit out their trip to Wakefield on Friday as well as 
Monday’s home game against Salford.

Cook will miss his club’s derby with Leeds on Thursday as well as their trip 
to France to face the Dragons after admitting a grade B dangerous tackle on

Both players were also fined £300 by the Rugby Football League’s disciplinary 
panel, as was the Catalans centre Krisnan Inu, who was given a three-match ban 
for a grade D dangerous throw on the Huddersfield prop Eorl Crabtree.

The London Broncos captain Wes Naiqama has also received a three-match ban for 
grade D dangerous contact on the Dewsbury back-rower Luke Adamson during his 
side’s Kingstone Press Championship game at Ealing. Naiqama, who pleaded 
guilty, was also fined £100.
