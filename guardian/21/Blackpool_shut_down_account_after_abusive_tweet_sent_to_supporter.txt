themselves from an abusive tweet from one of their official accounts that 
called a supporter an “arsehole wanker” during an argument over the state of 
the Bloomfield Road pitch.

The account – @CommercialBFC – goaded a supporter, who in July had pledged to 
give £20 to charity if the Blackpool pitch proved playable for their first home 
match of the season, Saturday’s 2-0 defeat to Rochdale, after pictures emerged 
of damage to the surface following a Neil Diamond concert.

The supporter replied, saying he would follow through with his donation as it 
“was for a good cause” but the account hit back with: “Back track, typical 
arseholr wanker”, before tangling with another fan about the state of the club.

Blackpool moved quickly to announce that the account in question had been shut 
down, adding it was not being used by an employee and had not been for some 
time.

A club statement read: “The club has been made aware of comments emanating 
from a Twitter account overnight that has previously advertised commercial 
opportunities. This account has not been utilised for promotional purposes by 
the club for some time and is not accessible to any current employees.

“The club does not condone the views expressed and has since had this account 
removed. The only official account for football club business on Twitter is 
@blackpoolfc, while hotel enquiries can be directed to @bfchotel.”

It is however the latest incident to affect Blackpool

, who were relegated to League One last season and whose chairman, Karl Oyston, 
was banned from all football activity for six weeks in June after sending 
messages of an abusive nature to a supporter.
