The Rugby Football League has launched an investigation into alleged racial 
chanting during the Super 8s qualifiers match between Wakefield and Bradford at 
Belle Vue last Saturday.

Wakefield said this week they were looking into “misconduct and unacceptable 
behaviour of spectators” and now the governing body is to look into a number of 
incidents after receiving a report from its match commissioner.

An RFL spokesman confirmed an investigation has begun.

The Wakefield chairman, Michael Carter, said his club would work with their 
stewarding company, West Yorkshire police and the RFL to identify the 
perpetrators and ban them for life.

“We have received reports of alleged disorder during the game on Saturday. As 
a club we will not tolerate such things and will cooperate fully with any 
investigation,” he said. “It is extremely sad in this day and age that a small 
minority can tarnish the event.”

Earlier this year, Wakefield were fined £1,000 after fans threw smoke bombs on 
to the pitch during their opening match of the season at Castleford.
