James DeGale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> retained his 
European super-middleweight title but was pushed to his limits in a unanimous 
points victory over Hadillah Mohoumadi at Bluewater in Kent.

DeGale, fighting for the first time this year under new promoter Mick 
Hennessy, took some heavy punishment from his French opponent but the 2008 
Olympic middleweight champion upped the tempo in the closing stages.

The 26-year-old improved his record to 13 wins with one defeat thanks to 
scores of 119-109, 117-111 and 116-112.

DeGale admitted he had contemplated retiring but has rediscovered his love for 
the sport after splitting from promoter Frank Warren and aligning himself with 
Hennessy.

He started well, landing some crisp combinations against Mohoumadi in the 
first round and then showing his versatility with a range of shots in the next. 
The tall southpaw seemed content to fight off the ropes, a position he would 
find himself throughout the fight, although DeGale did not seem too troubled by 
the barrage.

He continued to invite the pressure in the fourth but exploded off the ropes 
in the fifth and a snapping left hook found its mark, rocking back Mohoumadi's 
head.

The 32-year-old, who had been beaten twice in his 16-fight career before 
Saturday's fight but had never been stopped, continued to pin DeGale on the 
ropes, and was successful in landing a couple of decent right hands.

Mohoumadi was very aggressive but was coming off second best when DeGale boxed 
at range. Several powerful punches wobbled his opponent in the 10th rounds and 
another burst in the 12th saw him stun Mohoumadi once more in a very strong 
finish that would see him to victory.
