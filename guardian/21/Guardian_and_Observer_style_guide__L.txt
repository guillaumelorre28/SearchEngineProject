occasional variations such as Mtsenk

(and other ladies) not Baroness

lag
pipes are lagged; other things lag behind

New York airport

laid-back
He is laid-back, she is a laid-back boss

Lailat al-Miraj
Islamic holy day; Lailat al-Qadr Islamic holy day, time for study and prayer

laissez-faire
not laisser

Lake District
or the Lakes or Lakeland. Note that, with the exception of Bassenthwaite Lake, 
bodies of water in the Lake District do not have “lake” in their names (eg 
Buttermere, Derwent Water, Ullswater, Windermere)

lakes
capital L: Lake Baikal, Lake Erie, etc


lamb’s lettuce, lamb’s wool

German state of Hesse”


landmark
overused as an adjective, randomly strewn through stories, perhaps as an 
alternative to flagship

landmine

Land Registry
government department that registers title to land in England and Wales; the 
Scottish equivalent is Registers of Scotland

La’s, the
defunct Liverpool rock band; keep apostrophe (abbreviation for Lads)

lasagne

laser
word dating from 1960 formed from the phrase “light amplification by 
stimulated emission of radiation”, and an example of why not all acronyms need 
to be capped up

lasso
noun (plural lassos) and verb: you lasso a horse with a lasso

last or past?
interchangeable in such phrases as “six times in the last week”, “twice in the 
past year”.

But last means “most recent” in this sentence:
“United have beaten Wednesday five times in their last six meetings” 
whereas past refers to the past as a whole in this sentence:
“United have beaten Wednesday five times in their past six meetings” 
(suggesting they have only ever played each other six times)

Last Night of the Proms

last post

last rites
are given, not “read” (although someone might read you your rights if you were 
being arrested)

later
often redundant as context will inform the reader: “They will meet this month” 
rather than “They will meet later this month”

Latin
”Away with him! Away with him! He speaks Latin” (Shakespeare, Henry VI Part 2)

Some people object to, say, the use of “decimate” to mean destroy on the 
grounds that in ancient Rome it meant to kill every 10th man; some of them are 
also likely to complain about so-called split infinitives, a prejudice that 
goes back to 19th-century Latin teachers who argued that as you can’t split 
infinitives in Latin (they are one word) you shouldn’t separate “to” from the 
verb in English. Others might even get upset about our alleged misuse of 
grammatical “case” (including cases such as dative and genitive that no longer 
exist in English).

As our publications are written in English, rather than Latin, do not worry 
about any of this even slightly

latitude
like this: 21 deg 14 min S

latter
Use only in contrast with former. Saying an item is “the latter” of more than 
two things is not only annoying but wrong. In such cases, it should be “the 
last”


launderette
but Stephen Frears’ 1985 film was My Beautiful Laundrette

law lords
formerly “lords of appeal in ordinary”, they became justices of the supreme 
court when it was established in 2009.

They are referred to as Lord Sumption, Lady Hale etc (and not “Lord Justice” 
or “Lady Justice”, titles applied to court of appeal judges).

Note that the former Lord Justice Leveson is now Sir Brian Leveson. He is 
president of the Queen’s Bench division of the high court

lawsuit

lay bare
(revealed) past tense laid, not lay: so “almost a decade after the human 
genome project lay bare ...” should have read “laid bare”

layby
plural laybys

lay off
does not mean to sack or make redundant, but to send workers home on part pay 
because of a temporary lack of demand for their product

lay waste
a hurricane can lay waste an island, or lay an island waste, but it does not 
lay it to waste or lay waste to it (the word comes from the same root as 
devastate)

lbw
leg before wicket

lc
abbreviation for lowercase

Lea or Lee?
the river Lea flows to the Thames; the Lee Navigation canal incorporates part 
of it; the Lee Valley park is the site for much of the 2012 Olympic development

leach or leech?
leach (verb): percolate, remove with a percolating liquid
leech (noun): a bloodsucking worm, or used figuratively to describe, say, 
bankers

Lead Belly
(1888-1949) US musician, real name Huddie Ledbetter

leader of the house
or leader of the Commons

Learjet

learned
not learnt, unless you are writing old-fashioned poetry (he learned his 
tables, a message well learned, etc)

least bad
is the least bad option, rather than “least worst”

Lebanon
no definite article

le Carré, John

Le Corbusier
Swiss-French architect (1887-1955), real name Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris

led or lead?
In all but the present tense, the verb form is led. This does not stop 
otherwise normal, sensible people writing things like “he was led to the 
slaughter” or “the singing will be lead by Cliff Richard”. If this is just a 
slip of the keyboard, it’s a frequent slip

the left, left wing, leftwinger, lefty, lefties, hard left, soft left, old left
nouns; leftwing adjective

left field, left-field
two words as a noun: “this idea comes out of left field”
hyphenated as an adjective: “a left-field idea”

legal highs
are now illegal in the UK, which makes them novel psychoactive substances 
(NPSs), or for variation you could call them formerly legal highs

Legal Services Commission
responsible for legal aid in England and Wales; in Scotland it is the Scottish 
Legal Aid Board

legal terms
In England and Wales, in camera is now known as in secret and in chambers in 
private; a writ is a claim form and a plaintiff a claimant; leave to appeal is 
permission to appeal. Since the Children Act 1989, access has been known as 
contact and custody is known as residence; do not use the older terms

legend, legendary
Johnny Cash, say, may be a country music legend, but he is not legendary; the 
adjective is better reserved for mythical figures or events that have perhaps 
grown exaggerated in the telling: King Arthur was a legendary figure, Oliver 
Reed’s alcohol consumption was legendary, etc


legionnaires’ disease
named after an outbreak at a conference of American Legionnaires

Leibovitz, Annie
US photographer

lent
past tense of lend; we sometimes misspell it as “leant” as in “a gritty drama, 
leant added authenticity by Jean Tournier’s monochrome photography ... “

Leonardo da Vinci
Leonardo on second mention; “da Vinci” refers to the Vinci district near 
Florence – it is not his surname

lepers
a term now regarded as inappropriate and stigmatising; say people with leprosy 
or, if they are being treated, leprosy patients

Lesbos
not Lesvos

lese-majesty

less or fewer?
less means smaller in quantity, eg less money; fewer means smaller in number, 
eg fewer coins.

This is not just about supermarket signs that say “7 items or less”: it can 
make a real difference in meaning. These statements all say something different:

For less bad things to happen, fewer bad people need to be involved.
For fewer bad things to happen, less bad people need to be involved.
For fewer bad things to happen, fewer bad people need to be involved.
For less bad things to happen, less bad people need to be involved.

Note also the difference between “do you have less able children in your 
class?” (children who are less able) and “do you have fewer able children in 
your class?” (not so many able ones)

letdown, letup
nouns

let down, let up
verbs

level crossing

Leveson, Sir Brian
president of the Queen’s Bench Division; no longer Lord Justice Leveson (and 
he never was “Lord Leveson”)

Levi’s
jeans; the company is Levi Strauss

Lévi-Strauss, Claude
(1908-2009) French anthropologist

Lévy, Bernard-Henri
French philosopher

LGBT
abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/transexual; it is not 
normally necessary to spell it out. Other abbreviations exist, including LGBTI 
(intersex) and LGBTQ (queer), but LGBT is preferred


liaise, liaison

Lib Dems
for Liberal Democrats after first mention and in headlines

libretto
plural librettos

licence or license?
In British English, licence is the noun and license the verb. So you need a 
licence to run a licensed bar, or you may need to visit the off-licence

Liechtenstein

lie
(tell an untruth), past tense lied.
lie (down), past tense lay: he lay there for an hour.
lay (a table, an egg, put something down), past tense laid

lied
German musical setting for a poem, plural lieder

Liège
but the adjective is Liégeois

lifeguard, lifejacket, lifelong, lifesize

lift
Do not use as a verb to mean increase; the headline “Bank should lift interest 
rate next month” suggests that the Bank is going to remove interest rates 
altogether

lightbulb

lightening or lightning?
Your hair may be lightening in colour, but that electrical stuff in the sky is 
lightning


lighthearted

lightsaber
as in the official Jedi spelling

light year
a measure of distance, not time; Buzz Lightyear

likable
not likeable

like or as if?
Using like as a preposition (“ride like the wind”) is uncontroversial. Using 
it as a conjunction, introducing a clause that contains a verb (“ride like 
you’re riding a motorbike”, “he behaved like he was drunk”) will annoy many 
readers.

The simple way to keep everyone happy is to use like when the verb is followed 
by a noun (“he ran like a girl”) and as if when the verb is followed by a 
clause (“he ran as if he had seen a ghost”).

Ogden Nash pointed out that it’s As You Like It, not Like You Like It, 
although Shakespeare in fact did use like as a conjunction

like or such as?
“Cities like Manchester are wonderful” suggests the writer has in mind, say, 
Sheffield or Birmingham; it’s clearer to say “cities such as Manchester” if 
that is what she means.

Do not, however, automatically change “like” to “such as” - the following 
appeared in the paper: “He is not a celebrity, such as Jesse Ventura, the 
former wrestler ... “

likely
In the UK, if not the US, using likely in such contexts as “they will likely 
win the game” sounds unnatural at best; there is no good reason to use it 
instead of probably. If you really must do so, however, just put very, quite or 
most in front of it and all will, very likely, be well.

lilliputian

lilo
something you take to the beach to lie or float on; LiLo Lindsay Lohan

limpid
means clear or transparent, not limp

linchpin
not lynchpin

lineup, lineout
(as nouns)

link
(noun) takes the reader to a related reference on the Guardian or the web; 
(verb) to insert such a reference into an article or blog

LinkedIn
social networking site aimed at business people

lip-synch, lip-synching

liquefy
not liquify

liquorice
not licorice

listed buildings
In England and Wales, Grade I-listed (note cap G, roman numeral I) buildings 
are of exceptional interest; Grade II* are particularly important buildings of 
more than special interest; Grade II are of special interest, warranting every 
effort to preserve them.

In Scotland and Northern Ireland these categories are replaced by the more 
logical Grade A, Grade B and Grade C

lists

literally
a term used, particularly by sports commentators, to denote an event that is 
not literally true, as in “Manchester City literally came back from the dead”
See ironic, ironically 
<https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-i#ironic> 

Liu Xiaobo
Chinese winner of the 2010 Nobel peace prize

live blog
noun; liveblog verb

Liverpool John Lennon
airport

living wage
as advocated by the Living Wage Foundation and paid by some employers; it is 
important to differentiate this from the“national living wage” (in quotes at 
first mention), introduced by George Osborne in the 2015 budget to replace the 
minimum wage for workers over 24

Lloret de Mar
not del Mar

Lloyd’s of London
Lloyd’s names are lc; Lloyds TSB bank

Lloyd Webber or Lloyd-Webber?
Andrew Lloyd Webber at first mention, Lord Lloyd-Webber (with hyphen) at 
second mention, thereafter Lloyd Webber

loan
noun; the verb is lend

loathe
(rhymes with clothe) detest; loth (rhymes with oath) reluctant: 
“I’m loth to do anything he says because I loathe him so much.”

 You sometimes see loth spelt as loath, which is not incorrect, but only adds 
to the confusion with loathe

lobby
requires great care: unless you are writing about, say, the parliamentary 
lobby or US lobby system, it will at best sound vague and patronising, and at 
worst pejorative or offensive (“the Jewish lobby”). If you are talking about 
specific pressure groups, say who they are

local
a pub, not a person: talk about local people rather than “locals”

loch
Scottish; lough Irish

In either case, capital L in the name: Loch Ness (but Loch Ness monster), 
Lough Neagh, etc


Lockerbie bombing
in December 1988 killed 270 people; the two Libyans eventually put on trial 
for murder were Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah. Megrahi was 
convicted in 2001 and jailed for 27 years, but was released in 2009; his 
co-accused was acquitted

lock-in, lockout
nouns; lock in, lock out verbs

logbook, logjam

log in, log on, log out, log off
verbs

login, logon
nouns (“I’ve forgotten my login/logon”)

London
Surprising as it may be to some London-based journalists, most of our readers 
do not work or live in the capital (or, indeed, the UK). So give location, not 
just name: ie King’s Cross, north London, not just King’s Cross; there is a 
Victoria station in Manchester as well as in London, so make clear which one 
you mean

London assembly
elected body of 25 members whose role is to hold the mayor of London to 
account. Together, assembly and mayor constitute the Greater London authority 
(GLA); note there is no such organisation as the “Greater London assembly”

London boroughs and counties
Parts of the traditional counties of Essex, Middlesex, Kent and Surrey that 
are close to London retain the county link in their postal address (eg Bromley, 
Kent), even when they are administratively part of a London borough (eg the 
London borough of Bromley), and represented in the London assembly. This leads 
to inconsistencies, as when we refer to “Chingford, Essex” in one story and 
“Chingford, east London” in another.

It is hard to be totally consistent - the preferences even of people who live 
in such places may vary (according to how long they have lived there, for 
example).

In general, use London rather than the traditional counties - Ilford, east 
London; Bexley, south-east London, etc - unless a group or organisation 
specifically includes a county designation in its title

Londonderry
use Derry and County Derry (first mention, thereafter Co Derry)

London Eye
official name of the millennium wheel

London’s
do not say “London’s Covent Garden” (or London’s anything else); it is Covent 
Garden, London, etc

London School of Economics
abbreviated to LSE after first mention

London Stock Exchange
is also abbreviated to LSE, and there is no real way round this (especially 
for headlines); the context should make clear which we are talking about

chancellor also became secretary of state for justice

lord chief justice

Lord Haw-Haw
Nazi radio propagandist, real name William Joyce, hanged for treason in 1946

lord lieutenant
plural lord lieutenants: they are lieutenants, not lords (just as lord mayors 
are mayors, not lords). The official site of the royal household says: “Her 
Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenants are the representatives of the Crown for each county 
in the United Kingdom”

Lords, House of Lords
but the house, not the House; their lordships

Lord’s
cricket ground

lottery, national lottery
but Lotto and National Lottery Commission

lyrics
As with poetry, run song lyrics line by line if space permits:

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?

If you don’t have room to do this, separate the lines with spaces and a slash:

Sex and drugs and rock’n’roll / Is all my brain and body need. / Sex and drugs 
and rock’n’roll / Are very good indeed.

Italics are acceptable, though not essential
