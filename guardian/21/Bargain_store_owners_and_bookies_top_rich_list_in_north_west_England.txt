The list was compiled by valuing stakes in public companies at the end of July 
2016, according to prevailing prices in the Financial Times. Private companies 
were valued according to their sector rating or latest profits.

In 1976, aged 21, Tom Morris used a bank overdraft to start his business. 
Today TJ Morris Ltd, which runs Home Bargains, employs 17,000 staff across 400 
stores and has plans to expand to 30,000 staff in 800 outlets.

B&M Retail floated in 2014 with a valuation of £2.7bn and is now worth 
£2.58bn. The Arora brothers took over the then struggling business in December 
2004 and it has since seen significant growth, acquiring a number of former 
Kwik Save, Woolworths and Au-Naturale stores.

According to separate research by The Local Data Company

and Sainsbury – grew by 33% in the same period.
