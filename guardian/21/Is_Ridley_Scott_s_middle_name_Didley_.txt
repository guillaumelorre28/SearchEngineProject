This is a transcript of the questions Richard Ayoade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/richard-ayoade> set for the Tri-Annual 
Quiz-A-Thon held by the British Independent First Feature in A Realist 
Tradition awards (the Biffarts).

Tragically, halfway through James Nesbitt’s opening monologue, a highly 
localised fire sparked. In an attempt to avert disaster, one prominent jury 
member stripped to the waist and frenziedly wafted the flames with her jacket. 
Unfortunately, Tilda’s tunic was made of a highly flammable midnight-blue crêpe 
and went up like a hairball. The jacket contained the answers to the quiz.

Luckily, Nesbitt was still in possession of the questions, and was willing to 
license them back to us for a moderate fee. Here they be:

• What is Steven Spielberg’s preferred method of birth control?

• Who is director Steve McQueen’s famous namesake?

• Why won’t Quentin Tarantino eat guacamole after dusk?

• In what way is Mike Leigh different from a cult leader?

• True or false: Ridley Scott’s middle name is Didley?

• Which leading figure in the film industry likes hearing jokes at their 
expense?

• Can you name one successful and respected screenwriter?

• Whatever happened to the actor Tom Hanks?

• From what source does Robert Rodriguez get his confidence?

• What actor, aside from Sean Connery, could get away with doing the same 
accent his whole career?

• Why do people think it’s possible to make a good Godzilla film?

Ayoade also acted as question master for the Halloween quiz-off at the

Skype, on 31 October 2013. Ayoade was offline for the actual quiz, but 
personally posted the following message via his nephew.
