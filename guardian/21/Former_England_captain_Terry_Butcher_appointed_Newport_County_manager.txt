Newport County <https://www.theguardian.com/football/newport-county> have 
appointed the former England captain Terry Butcher as their new manager.

The League Two <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> club, 
who sit ninth in the table but are unable to reach the play-off positions on 
the final day of the season, have been supervised by the caretaker manager 
Jimmy Dack since Justin Edinburgh joined Gillingham in February.

But the 56-year-old Butcher has now been asked to lead the Exiles for the next 
two years.

He told the club’s official website: “I’m delighted to be given the 
opportunity to work for a fantastic club like Newport. I have met a lot of 
great people at the club already and have seen the passionate fans for myself 
at recent games.

“I look forward to the new challenge and I’m looking forward to working 
together with everyone at a club that has great aspirations for the future.”

Butcher earned 77 caps for England and was a long-term fixture at centre-back 
for Ipswich and Rangers. His management career includes spells with Sunderland, 
Brentford and Inverness and has also taken him to Australia with Sydney FC, 
while he was most recently in charge at Hibernian.

The Newport director Howard Greenhaf said: “We were extremely impressed with 
Terry when we spoke to him. He is very thorough and professional in his 
approach and we are sure we have the best man for the job.

“As soon as Terry was connected to the job he came and watched us himself 
several times and also sent people to our games on his behalf. He already knows 
the team in good detail and has firm plans on what he wants for next season.”

Newport host Oxford at Rodney Parade on Saturday afternoon, but Butcher will 
have only a watching brief.
