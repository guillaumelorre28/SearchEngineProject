André Gomes was twice denied by Andrés either side of the Granada defender 
Ricardo Costa’s header at the other end, which was turned away by Valencia 
goalkeeper Diego Alves.

Alves kept out the Granada striker Rubén Rochina’s low shot five minutes into 
the second half before Valencia went ahead when Parejo drilled the ball into 
the bottom corner following Alcacer’s assist.

Valencia made sure of the points in the 90th minute through Mina’s neat low 
finish but were given a late scare three minutes later when Granada substitute 
Méndez headed in Rochina’s cross.
