The International Association of Athletics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/athletics> Federations has laid out 
guidelines for Russian athletes who wish to take part in international 
competition this year.

The Russian Athletics Federation remains suspended over state-sponsored 
doping, with the head of theIAAF <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/iaaf> 
taskforce set up to assess Russia’s anti-doping progress, Rune Andersen, 
reporting last month the country was not ready to return to the fold.

Russian athletes can apply to the IAAF for individual permission to compete, 
as the long jumperDarya Klishina did at the Rio Olympics last summer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/09/ioc-rio-ban-failure-russia-doping-scandal>
, albeit with the aid of the court of arbitration for sport.

The IAAF has sent updated guidelines for such athletes to the Russian 
Athletics Federation. Athletes have to prove they are “not directly implicated 
in any way (knowingly or unknowingly) by their national federation’s failure to 
put in place adequate systems to protect and promote clean athletes”.

Other criteria include: whether a member of an athlete’s entourage has ever 
been implicated in doping; how many anti-doping samples an athlete has 
provided; if there has been any time when they were not subject to testing by a 
recognised body; if there have been any concerns about their biological 
passport profile; if they have any historical samples being retested.

The IAAF said it has been sent around 200 names of Russian athletes by the 
McLaren investigation team, who uncovered the extent of the country’s doping 
programme across sport.

It added it would “assess the evidence and intelligence from the McLaren 
report and elsewhere in respect of any athlete who applies for neutral athlete 
status”.

The IAAF said athletes applying for the right to compete did not necessarily 
have to have been tested outside of Russia, but stressed they “must have been 
part of a recognised, independent and fully Wada code-compliant drug-testing 
programme for a sufficiently long period to provide substantial objective 
assurance of integrity”.

There are now more than 60 Russian athletes in the IAAF International 
Registered Testing Pool – for athletes who have been satisfactorily tested by 
the IAAF and/or other independent testing agencies – but being part of that 
does not guarantee athletes permission to compete.

Applications for permission will be considered by the IAAF’s doping review 
board.
