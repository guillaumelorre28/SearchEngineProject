In Star Wars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> she was our great and 
powerful princess – feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more 
difficult than most people might think. My heart and prayers are with Billie, 
Debbie and all Carrie’s family, friends and fans. She will be missed by all.”

Steven Spielberg also paid tribute: “I have always stood in awe of Carrie. Her 
observations always made me laugh and gasp at the same time. She didn’t need 
The Force. She was a force of nature, of loyalty and of friendship. I will miss 
her very much.”

Other members of the original Star Wars cast – including Billy Dee Williams, 
who played Lando Calrissian, and Anthony Daniels, who played C-3PO – paid their 
respects on Twitter.

I thought I had got what I wanted under the tree. I didn't. In spite of so 
many thoughts and prayers from so many. I am very, very sad.

her truth with us all with her trademark wit and irreverence.”

He added: “Millions fell in love with her as the indomitable Princess Leia; 
she will always have a special place in the hearts of Star Wars fans as well as 
all of us who were lucky enough to know her personally. She will be sorely 
missed, and we join millions of fans and friends around the world who mourn her 
loss today.”

Sharon Horgan, who convinced Fisher to play the role of her mother-in-law on 
her sitcom Catastrophe, posted a tribute on Instagram.

Carrie was my friend. It took me three series but I got her in the end. She 
was the most generous, fun, gifted, smart, kind, funny funny funny person I've 
ever met. She certainly wasn't ready to go. I'm so glad we became pals. I'm so 
devastated at her loss. I want to write about her more but I can't process yet.

Carrie Fisher was smart, funny, talented, surprising, and always a hell of a 
fun time to be around. Family Guy will miss her immensely.

Fisher earned a 2007 Emmy nomination for her role as an out-of-sorts comedy 
writer on 30 Rock, and Tina Fey, the show’s creator,released a statement 
<http://time.com/4618491/carrie-fisher-dead-tina-fey/> on Fisher’s influence:


“Carrie Fisher meant a lot to me. Like many women my age, Princess Leia 
occupies about sixty percent of my brain at any given time. But Carrie’s honest 
writing and her razor-sharp wit were an even greater gift. I feel so lucky that 
I got to meet her. I’m very sad she is gone.”

Speaking to the Guardian, two directors who worked with Fisher on early films 
also paid tribute. Woody Allen, who directed Fisher in 1986’s Hannah and Her 
Sisters – in which she plays the more successful best friend of Dianne Weist – 
called her “one of the brightest and wittiest actresses I worked with”. “Such a 
tragic loss,” he added.

Meanwhile John Landis, in whose Blues Brothers Fisher featured as the violent 
former girlfriend of John Belushi, said he and his wife, Deborah, were both 
“heartbroken over Carrie’s passing”.

Other stars including Whoopi Goldberg, Stephen Fry and comedian Margaret Cho 
also posted about Fisher’s death.
