What is the benefit cap?

The benefit cap sets a limit on the total amount in benefits that most 
working-age people can claim.

How much is the cap?

The benefit cap will be reduced from 7 November 2016.

The total amount a couple or a single parent can receive in benefits will be:

 * £442.31 a week, or £1,916.67 per month within London. 
 * £384.62 a week, or £1,666.67 per month outside London. 
The total amount a single person who doesn’t have children, or doesn’t have 
children living with them can receive in benefits will be:

 * £296.35 a week, or £1,284.17 per month within London. 
 * £257.69 a week, or £1,116.67 per month outside London. 
The current cap is:


 * £500 per week for single parents and couples. 
 * £350 per week for single people who don’t have children, or don’t have 
children living with them. 
What effect will the cap have?

Before the reduction, households affected were predominantly clustered in 
London, due to higher housing costs: the move to a regional rate, as well as a 
reduction for all claimants who reach the cap means far more people will have 
their benefits cut.

The Department for Work and Pensions states that between the introduction of 
the cap in April 2013 and May 2016,76,200 households had their benefits capped

. Most of these households were in London, and most capped households included 
children.

The cap applies to people who are not in work – households are exempted from 
the cap ifeither of the following apply 
<https://www.gov.uk/benefit-cap/overview>:

 * The claimant or their partner are eligible for working tax credit. 
 * The claimant or their partner get universal credit, and their household 
income is more than £430 a month after tax and national insurance. 
Who will be affected?

Analysis by the Chartered Institute of Housing 
<http://www.cih.org/news-article/display/vpathDCR/templatedata/cih/news-article/data/New_benefit_cap_will_have_widespread_and_severe_impact_-_new_research>
 (CIH) shows the households affected by the existing cap are those living in 
particularly high cost areas. Almost 9,000 of those affected live in London, 
with a further 2,000 living in the south-east. It has also had an impact on 
larger than average families, with the CIH estimating that 5,000 families with 
four children have been affected and nearly 7,000 with five or more children.

The reduced cap will have much wider effect, as the impact of the cap will no 
longer be limited to London. At present, 586 households in Wales are caped – 
from 7 November, 5,844 families will be capped: in the east Midlands, Scotland 
and the north-east, the number of families capped rises almost ten-fold.

. 
The larger the family, the bigger the proportionate impact. The household cap 
is not tapered by number of children in the family, so a family of five will be 
capped at the same rate as a single parent family, if their benefits and 
housing benefit reach the cap.

The CIH research estimates that 319,000 children live in houses that will be 
affected by the reduction in benefits. Even in the parts of the country where 
housing is cheapest, Wales and the north-east, there are over 12,000 
one-to-four child families affected.

 Impact of lower benefit cap by family size. 
What is the likely effect?

As the cap to benefits is usually applied through a reduction in housing 
benefit the CIH report says that:

 * Many three-child families will face substantial shortfalls, for example, 
those that rent privately stand to lose more than £100 per week in half of all 
local authority areas if they are a couple, or a quarter of all areas if they 
are a lone parent. 
 * Council tenants will face losses of more than £25 a week in almost all 
areas if they are a couple, although this falls to 20%of areas if they are a 
lone parent. 
 * In the private rented sector, many two child families will also face 
significant shortfalls in more expensive parts of the country. These will 
exceed £25 per week in 40% of local authority areas for couples and in 20% for 
lone parents.

CIH’s chief executive, Terrie Alafat says the organisation’s research on the 
cap isextremely worrying 
<https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/nov/01/housing-benefit-cap-homelessness-children-government-plans>
. It shows that the reduction in total benefits is going to hit some of the 
most vulnerable families of all sizes across England, Scotland and Wales. 
“These families will lose out when the cap comes into effect from 7 November 
and in many cases will straight away face a substantial gap between their rent 
and the help they receive to pay for their housing.”
