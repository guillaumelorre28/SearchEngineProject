to last night’s sixth and last episode than watched the X Factor final on ITV 
an hour later. Occasionally, the series strayed into the anthropomorphic, but 
it was endlessly surprising, often astonishing, as technological advance 
brought intimacy to the struggle for life. Heartstopping sequences were cut as 
drama. Viewers wept forthe iguana that lost against the racer snakes

 and the turtle hatchlings misled by artificial light into a busy Barbados 
road. The last episode revealed how in some of the world’s busiest urban areas 
the relationship between man and nature is being reversed. City life hones wits 
and the most successful animals – like theHanuman langurs 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04kcc96> in Jodhpur in northern India – that 
have migrated from their remote jungles are exploiting man as a wasteful 
consumer, thieving and charming their way to unprecedented levels of fertility. 
But what really marked out this series was the great Sir David Attenborough’s 
willingness to remind the viewers of the consequences of our greed and 
selfishness for the rest of our planet’s life. If only he had been more 
confrontational. We are wrecking the planet, and asSir David said

 as he wrapped what must be almost his last television series, it is up to us, 
and only us, to stop it.
