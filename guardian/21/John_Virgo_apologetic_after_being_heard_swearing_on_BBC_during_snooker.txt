John Virgo has apologised after he was heard swearing on air during a 
semi-final at the WorldSnooker <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/snooker> 
Championship. The 70-year-old thought he was holding an off-microphone 
conversation but could be heard muttering during the match between Mark Selby 
and Marco Fu.

He said during BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> One’s live 
mid-afternoon broadcast: “I wanted to watch a bit of racing this afternoon. 
I’ll be lucky to watch some fuckingMatch of the Day.”

His comments came while Selby and Fu were contesting the longest frame in 
Crucible history, which ran to one hour and 16 minutes. IMG Media produces the 
BBC’s Crucible coverage, and its managing director for global production, 
Graham Fry, said Virgo would continue to work at the tournament but had been 
spoken to about the incident.

Fry said of the former UK champion: “It was off-mic, the mics weren’t switched 
on and it somehow got picked up. It was a mistake and I’ve spoken to him about 
it. He’s embarrassed and apologetic.”

Virgo was snooker’s UK Championship winner in 1979 but is equally well known 
as a television personality, having presented the popular BBC One showBig Break 
alongside Jim Davidson from 1991 to 2002.
