This match – along with Southampton’s duel with Everton on 2 January – will 
have a bearing on which side collects the notional ‘best of the rest’ award at 
the end of the season for finishing just below thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> title-chasers. Southampton 
are likely to have most of the ball against West Brom but Claude Puel’s side 
are still struggling to find sharpness so the well organised visitors will 
fancy their chances of pinching a win.Paul Doyle
