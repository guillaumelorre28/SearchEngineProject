 D - style guide illustrations Photograph: Jakob Hinrichs 
dachshund 

Dad or dad?
capital D if it’s just Dad, eg “I’ll have to ask Dad”; otherwise lowercase, eg 
“my dad was a dustman, what does your dad do?” etc

dadaism, dadaist

Dáil Éireann
lower house of parliament in the Irish Republic, normally just the Dáil

DaimlerChrysler

Dakar
capital of Senegal; Dhaka capital of Bangladesh

dal
not dhal

Dalai Lama
no abbreviation: he is always the Dalai Lama

Dalek
takes initial cap, whether used literally (as in referring to Doctor Who), or 
figuratively (as in describing, say, your boss)

Dalí, Salvador
(1904-89) Spanish surrealist

dancefloor
one word (thanks to Arctic Monkeys for this one)

dangling participles
(also known as hanging participles)

Avoid constructions such as “having died, they buried him”; the pitfalls are 
nicely highlighted in Mark Lawson’s novel Going Out Live, in which a TV critic 
writes: “Dreary, repetitive and well past the sell-by date, I switched off the 
new series of Fleming Faces.”

Another example, from a leading article: “Due out in January as a white paper, 
Ms Kelly may be unable to overcome Mr Blair’s apparent determination to stick 
with A-levels.”

And this particularly exotic dangling participle somehow found its way into 
the paper: “Though long-legged and possessing a lovely smile, gentleman 
journalists aren’t looking up her skirt and wouldn’t even if she weren’t gay”

danish pastry

DA notices
issued by the Defence, Press and Broadcasting Advisory Committee, “advising” 
that the media do not publish sensitive information; formerly D notices

Daraa 
Syrian city, 90km from Damascus, not to be confused with Darayya, a suburb of 
Damascus, also sometimes described as a city

dark ages

darknet

dashcam

dashes
A single dash can add a touch of drama – like this. But use sparingly. 

A pair of dashes are an alternative to commas or brackets for parenthesis when 
you want to draw the reader’s attention to something surprising or unusual. An 
example from the paper of how not to do it: “Many neighbours in the block – 
which sits close to the banks of the Thames – were visibly shaken.” The block’s 
innocuous location does not need underlining with dashes. Commas would suffice.

Beware sentences – such as this one – that dash about all over the place – 
commas (or even, very occasionally, brackets) are often better; semicolons also 
have their uses.

Dashes should be en dashes rather than em dashes or hyphens

data
takes a singular verb (like agenda), though strictly a plural; you come across 
datum, the singular of data, about as often as you hear about an agendum


datacentre, dataset

dates
Our style is: 21 July 2016 (day month year; no commas).

21 July-6 August, 6-10 August, etc.

In the 21st century but 21st-century boy; fourth century BC; AD2007, 2500BC, 
10,000BC.

Use figures for decades: the 1960s, the swinging 60s, etc.

Should you have occasion to say 2016 out loud, for example in a podcast, 
pronounce it “twenty sixteen”, not “two thousand and sixteen”

daughter of, son of
Think twice before referring to people in these terms. Often only the person’s 
father is described and such descriptions can smack of snobbery as well as 
sexism.

Simplistic labels may also be misleading: we published a clarification after 
calling Captain James Cook the son of a Scottish farm labourer. True enough, 
but Cook’s mother was a Yorkshire woman and he is a famous son of Yorkshire

Davison, Emily
suffragette who died four days after stepping in front of George V’s horse at 
the 1913 Derby

daybreak, daydream

DayGlo
TM; but note the X-Ray Spex hit The Day the World Turned Day-Glo

Day Kundi
province in Afghanistan

daylong, daytime
but month-long, year-long, night-time

day trip
two words, eg Day Trip to Bangor by (trivia question) ... Fiddler’s Dram

D-day
6 June 1944, or used figuratively (“Monday is D-day for the Blades’ promotion 
hopes”)

deaf ears
Avoid or say “closed ears”; the phrase is not just a rather lazy cliche but 
offensive to many deaf people. For the same reason, do not use “dialogue of the 
deaf”: most deaf people are perfectly capable of conducting a dialogue using 
BSL and other sign languages. The term “deaf mute” is also outdated and 
offensive; “deaf”, where relevant, will suffice.

Note that a hearing aid is not a “deaf aid” (although we contrived to use the 
phrase in a crossword in August 2012)

deathbed
but death row

debacle
no accents; like farce and fiasco, to be used sparingly in news reporting

debatable

decades
1950s, etc; use figures if you abbreviate: roaring 20s, swinging 60s, a woman 
in her 70s, the first reader’s email of the 00s (pronounced, unfortunately, 
“noughties”)

deceptively
ambiguous (in one survey, half the respondents thought “deceptively easy” 
meant easy, and half thought it meant hard), and therefore best avoided – 
advice unlikely to be heeded, sadly, by estate agents

decimate
nowadays used to mean destroy (yes, we know it originally meant to kill one in 
10)
See Latin <https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-l#latin> 

declarations
lc, eg Laeken declaration on the future of Europe

decorations
no need normally to put OBE, KCMG, etc after people’s names

decry
condemn; descry discover
You only ever see descry when someone uses it wrongly to mean decry


deep south
of the US

defensible

definite, definitely, definitive, definitively
”For me, this is definitely the definitive style guide”


defriend
or unfriend (Facebook)

defuse
render harmless; diffuse spread about

Degas, Edgar
(1834-1917) French artist

de Gaulle, Charles
(1890-1970) French military leader and statesman; De Gaulle on second mention

degrees
like this: my sons all got firsts, but I only got a second – although it was a 
2:1 – and I did go on to a master’s

deja vu
defined as the phenomenon of having the strong sensation that an event or 
experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past 
(whether it has actually happened or not). So watching England underperforming 
and being knocked out of a major football tournament at an early stage, for 
example, might be said to induce a sense of deja vu

Delevingne, Cara

Delhi
unless specifically referring to the small area of the city that is New Delhi

delivery
the arrival of a baby, letter or parcel; also widely found in such gruesome 
examples of marketing-speak as “delivering care” or “delivering quality and 
value”

Deloitte
not Deloittes, Deloitte Consulting, or Deloitte & Touche

delphic

deltas
are, like other geographical features, lc: Nile delta, Okavango delta, etc

delusion or illusion?
“That the sun moves round the Earth was once a delusion, and is still an 
illusion” (Fowler)

dementia
not “senile dementia”. 

We should take care to refer to a person or people with dementia, or living 
with dementia, not as a “dementia sufferer” or “victims of dementia”.

Dementia is an umbrella term that refers to various conditions. Some of the 
more common types of dementia include Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, 
Lewy Body dementia, and fronto-temporal dementia (eg Pick’s disease). Respect 
people’s choices about how they identify themselves, for example as someone 
with Alzheimer’s disease rather than dementia

DeMille, Cecil B
(1881-1959) Hollywood producer and director; the B stood for Blount

Democrat, Democratic
In American politics, Democrat is a noun, Democratic an adjective: Hillary 
Clinton is a Democrat, and a member of the Democratic party.

The distinction is important because the Republicans use “Democrat” as an 
adjective, eg “Democrat party”, in a pejorative way

the Democratic Republic of the Congo
DRC on second mention; not to be confused with its smaller neighbour 
Congo-Brazzaville (which is also known as the Republic of the Congo); both 
countries border the Congo river. DRC, formerly the colony of Belgian Congo and 
then Zaire, is the second largest country in Africa by area and the fourth most 
populated

Dench, Dame Judi
not Judy

Deng Xiaoping

denier
one who denies, as in “Holocaust denier”; there is no such word as “denialist”.

The OED defines a sceptic as “a seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not 
yet arrived at definite conclusions”, which is highly flattering to “climate 
change sceptics” who are literally in denial about the overwhelming scientific 
evidence and deny that climate change is happening or is caused by human 
activity, so denier is the more accurate, and our preferred, term.


denier is also a unit of weight for fibre, eg 10-denier tights

De Niro, Robert

denouement
no accent

departments of state
British government ministries (but not ministers) take initial caps, as 
follows:

Cabinet Office (but the cabinet) 
Home Office 
Foreign Office (abbreviate to FCO – for Foreign and Commonwealth Office – 
after first mention)
Treasury 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) 
Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) 
Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) 
Department for Education (DfE) 
Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) 
Department for International Development (DfID) 
Department for Transport (DfT) 
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) 
Department of Health (DH) 
Ministry of Defence (MoD) 
Ministry of Justice (MoJ) 
Office of the Leader of the House of Commons 
Northern Ireland Office 
Scotland Office not Scottish Office 
Wales Office not Welsh Office 

Use the abbreviations in brackets sparingly, especially the clumsy ones: 
business department, culture and sport department, and so on are fine, or just 
the department, the ministry, etc.

Departments and ministries of other English-speaking countries also take an 
initial capital, eg US Department of State, Indian Ministry of Railways.

Departments and ministries of non-English-speaking countries are lc, eg French 
ministry of the interior, Iraqi foreign ministry

dependant
noun; dependent adjective; dependence
His dependants were dependent on him for everything


depositary
person; depository place

deprecate
express disapproval; depreciate reduce in value.
Hence self-deprecating humour or remark, not “self-depreciating”

derby
as in Everton v Liverpool or Newbury FC v Thatcham Town; it is not normally 
necessary to include the word “local”

de rigueur
the two Us are de rigueur

derisive or derisory?
The former means contemptuous, as in a yell of derision; the latter means 
unworthy of serious discussion, as in a derisory offer


derring-do
not daring-do

Derry, Co Derry
(County Derry at first mention) not Londonderry, Co Londonderry

descendants
come after ancestors; you wouldn’t think we would get this simple thing wrong 
as often as we do

deselect

desiccated
not dessicated

despoil
but despoliation

dessert
pudding, but just deserts

Dettol
TM

developing countries
rather than third world

devil, the

de Villepin, Dominique
Villepin on second mention

DeVito, Danny

diabetes
a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood sugar (glucose) level to 
become too high. The hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas, is responsible 
for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood.

There are two types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2, and it is important to 
distinguish between the two.

Type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas does not produce any insulin, comprises 
about 10% of cases but is the most common type of childhood diabetes. Type 1 is 
an auto-immune disease, cause unknown (although genetics is believed to play a 
part). Weight is not a factor

Type 2 diabetes, where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the 
body’s cells don’t react to insulin, comprises about 90% of adult cases. 
Obesity, lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet have contributed to an increase 
in the number of adults developing type 2 diabetes

Diabetes UK
formerly known as the British Diabetic Association

Diaghilev, Sergei
(1872-1929) Russian impresario; founder of the Ballets Russes

dialects
cockney, estuary English, geordie, scouse

diamond jubilee

diaspora

DiCaprio, Leonardo

Dictaphone
TM

die
is what people do in the Guardian (not “passed away”, “shuffled off this 
mortal coil” or any other euphemism)

diehard
although the film series is Die Hard

dietitian
must be trained and qualified in dietetics, and registered with the Health 
Professionals Council; not the same as a nutritionist, a less precise term 
(although some nutritionists are also registered dietitians)

different from
is traditionally the correct form; different to is widely accepted nowadays, 
but note the difference between:

She looked very different to those who came before (to the people who came 
before, she looked very different).

She looked very different from those who came before (she did not look like 
the people who came before).

Different than is frowned on, at least in British English; and it’s always 
differs from, not differs to

digital rights management
can be abbreviated to DRM after first mention

digitalise
administer digitoxin (extracted from foxglove leaves) to treat heart 
conditions;digitise transcribe data into digital format

dignitary, dignitaries

dijon mustard

dilapidated

dilemma
Not just a posh word for decision. It suggests a choice between two difficult 
choices of action. Perhaps the best known dilemma is “to be or not to be”


dilettante

dim sum

Dinky Toys
TM

dinner ladies
are generally known as school meals supervisors these days

diphtheria

diplomatic service

director general

direct speech
People we write about are allowed to speak in their own, not necessarily our, 
style, but be sensitive: do not, for example, expose someone to ridicule for 
dialect or grammatical errors.

Do not attempt facetious phonetic renditions such as “oop north”, “fooking” 
and “booger” when interviewing someone from the north, or “dahn sarf” when 
writing about south London

dire straits
not straights

disabled people
not “the disabled” 

We aim to use positive language about disability, avoiding outdated terms that 
stereotype or stigmatise.

Terms to avoid, with acceptable alternatives in brackets, include victim of, 
suffering from, afflicted by, crippled by (prefer person who has, person with); 
wheelchair-bound, in a wheelchair (uses a wheelchair); invalid (disabled 
person); mentally handicapped, backward, retarded, slow (person with learning 
difficulties or disabilities); the disabled, the handicapped, the blind, the 
deaf (disabled people, blind people, deaf people); deaf and dumb (deaf and 
speech-impaired, hearing and speech-impaired)

disassemble
take apart; dissemble conceal

disburse
give out money; disperse scatter a crowd


disc
rotating optical disc: CD, CD-Rom, DVD, etc; disk rotating magnetic disc: disk 
drive, floppy disk

discernible
not discernable

discharged

from jail

discolour
but discoloration

discomfit
(verb) to make uncomfortable or uneasy (its older meaning, to thwart or 
frustrate, has largely fallen into disuse);discomfort (noun) inconvenience, 
distress or mild pain


discreet
circumspect; discrete separate

disfranchise
not disenfranchise

disfigured, disfigurement 
rather than deformed, deformity

disinterested
means free from bias, objective (the negative form of interested as in 
“interested party”); often used incorrectly instead ofuninterested, not taking 
an interest (the negative form of interested as in “interested in football”). 
So disinterest is impartiality, not a lack of interest.


The distinction is one we should strive to maintain because it is not helpful 
to readers if we use disinterested and uninterested to mean the same thing


Disneyland
(California)

Disneyland Paris
(formerly Euro Disney)

Disney World
(Florida)

disoriented
not disorientated

dispatch, dispatch box
(Commons), dispatched; not despatch, despatched

not disassociate, disassociation

distinct or distinctive?
There’s a distinct possibility that he will insist on showing you the 
distinctive birthmark on his left buttock


distributor

ditching
not a synonym for crashing: if you ditch a helicopter, you make a controlled 
landing on the water after an emergency – we have got this wrong several times

divorcee
a divorced person, male or female

divvy up, divvying up
The BBC used the grotesque “divi’ing up”

yorkshire terrier; but note German shepherd, Irish setter, old English sheepdog

singer-songwriter (born 1988)

doll’s house

dome, the
Millennium Dome at first mention, thereafter the dome; now the O2

Domesday Book
but doomsday scenario

domestic violence/family violence
Both terms are acceptable, but a mention of domestic violence at some point is 
helpful for clarity. (It is also preferred by some advocacy groups.) Always 
include helpline numbers

domestic violence victims/survivors
The term victim is used for those in a violent situation or at risk of 
violence. The term survivor is used for people who have experienced domestic 
violence in the past. Give priority to the preferences of the person we are 
writing about

Dominica
former British colony in the Windward Islands, south-east of Dominican Republic

Dominican Republic
independent Spanish-speaking country that shares the island of Hispaniola with 
Haiti

doubledecker
bus; Double Decker chocolate bar

doughnuts
despite Dunkin’ Donuts

dove
a bird, not the past tense of dive, which is dived

dover sole

Dow Jones industrial average

downmarket

downplay
play down is preferable

downriver, downstream

Down’s syndrome
say (if relevant) a baby with Down’s syndrome, not “a Down’s syndrome baby” – 
we wouldn’t say “a cerebral palsy baby”. The diagnosis is not the person

downtown

down under
a term Australians themselves rarely use, and best avoided

doyen, doyenne
the senior member of a group, eg “she was the doyenne of ballet critics.” It 
once meant a leader or commander of 10 men

dozen
precisely, not approximately, 12

Dr
at first mention for medical and scientific doctors and doctors of divinity 
(not, for example, a politician who happens to have a PhD in history); 
thereafter, just use surname except in leading articles

draconian

draft
document; draught current of air

draftsman, draftswoman
of documents; draughtsman, draughtswoman of drawings

dreamed
not dreamt

DreamWorks

dressing room
two words

drier, dryer
this shirt will only get drier after an hour in the tumble dryer (while I use 
the hairdryer)

drily
not dryly

drink
past tense drank, past participle drunk: he drinks too much – last night he 
drank 10 pints, the least he has drunk on any night this week

drink-driver, drink-driving, drunk-driving
The limits are breath: 35 micrograms per 100 millilitres; blood: 80 milligrams 
per 100 millilitres; urine: 107 milligrams per 100 millilitres.

If a breath test is positive, but less than 50 micrograms per 100 millilitres, 
then a blood or urine test is needed before a prosecution can be brought; above 
50, a breath test alone is strong enough to be used as evidence

driving licence
not driver’s licence in British English

drone
honeybee whose function is to mate with the queen, and by extension therefore 
someone who lives off the work of others (the worker bees); however, it seems 
to be used increasingly to mean something like an obedient, unimaginative 
worker (“office drone”)

drug companies, drug dealer, drug raid, drug squad, drug tsar
not drugs raid, etc

drug use
a more accurate and less judgmental term than “drug abuse” or “misuse” (often 
all three terms have been scattered randomly through the same reports)

druid

drum’n’bass

drunkenness

DSG International
the former Dixons; owns Currys and PC World. DSG stands for Dixons Store 
Group, but in June 2010 the company, belatedly realising that no one in the 
world was aware of this, decided to change back to Dixons

dub
Avoid such tabloidese as “he has been dubbed the nation’s leading expert on 
style” (even if true)

duct tape
not duck tape

due to or owing to?
Traditionalists argue that “due to” should only be used when it is the 
complement of the verb “to be”, and could be replaced by “caused by”; 
otherwise, use “owing to” or “because of”:

The train’s late arrival was due to [caused by] leaves on the line; the train 
was late owing to [because of] leaves on the line.

The distinction, once routinely taught in primary schools but now assailed on 
all sides, especially by train and tube announcers, is being lost.

There is no such controversy about “due to” in other contexts – rent is due to 
the landlord, we are due to arrive in 10 minutes, etc


duffel bag, duffel coat
The fabric was named after Duffel, a town in Belgium

dugout

Duke and Duchess of Cambridge
(or wherever), first mention; thereafter the duke and duchess.

Variations on “Prince William and Kate” or “Kate and William” are fine for 
headlines. “Princess Kate” is wrong

Duke of York
first mention; thereafter Prince Andrew or the prince

dumb
do not use when you mean speech-impaired

du Pré, Jacqueline
(1945-87) English cellist, Du Pré at second mention

the surrounding buildings

dynamo
plural dynamos

Dynamo
football teams from the former Soviet Union are Dynamo; teams from Romania are 
Dinamo

dyslexia
write “Paul has dyslexia” rather than labelling him “a dyslexic” or saying he 
“suffers from” dyslexia
