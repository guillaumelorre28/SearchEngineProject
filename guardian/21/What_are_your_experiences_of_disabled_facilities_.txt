The athlete and disabilities campaigner was left to urinate on herself because 
the accessible toilet was out of order. A staff member suggested she could get 
off the train at a station to use the disabled toilet there and then wait for 
the next train. This would have delayed her journey but, she was unable to get 
off the train in any case as there were no staff at the station to help her.

Despite feeling humiliated, Wafula Strike said she felt she had to speak out 
to expose some of the injustice faced by people living with disabilities.

“I’ll probably be remembered as that woman who wet herself on the train. I 
could have kept quiet but I hope that by speaking out other wheelchair users 
who use public transport won’t be subjected to the same experience I had.”

We want to hear from people with disabilities about access to toilets, 
transport and other facilities in public. Have you ever found that services 
aimed at disabled people are inadequate? What about parking when you’re out 
shopping? Have you found accessibility an issue elsewhere? Did you complain and 
if so, how were your concerns responded to? In general, how accessible is 
public transport in your area?
