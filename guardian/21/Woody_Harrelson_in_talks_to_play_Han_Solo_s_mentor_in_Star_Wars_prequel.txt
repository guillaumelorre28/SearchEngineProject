Other confirmed cast members include Donald Glover, who will play a young

focus on the early years of the notorious space smugglers and how they became 
“scoundrels on the rise”.

It would mark another franchise role for Harrelson, who has played a similar 
role in The Hunger Games series and recently starred in his second Now You See 
Me film. He’s also coming off the back of an acclaimed supporting role in The 
Edge of Seventeen and festival buzz for LBJ.

Wars Story, which has already made over $800m at the global box office in less 
than a month. This year sees the launch ofStar Wars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> Episode VIII, which will follow on 
from the events of The Force Awakens.
