Most employers expect to boost job numbers in the new year as the 
post-referendum panic fades.

ManpowerGroup, the recruitment agency, said its quarterly survey of employers 
found theyhave shrugged off concerns about the impact of Brexit

 to report an improved outlook for the first three months of 2017.

The survey, which is based on responses from 2,104 UK employers, reported a 
rise of two points in its employment index to +7%, the highest level of 
optimism in two years.

Mark Cahill, the managing director of ManpowerGroup UK, said: “Employers are 
still unsure about what exactly Brexit will mean, but are not letting that 
uncertainty deter them from hiring.”

In a warning to ministers keen to clamp down on immigration, he said: “Some 
employers may be looking to bring in talent before any curbs to freedom of 
movement across the European Union come into effect, as more than half of all 
the jobs created by UK employers this year went to EU workers.”

He said transport jobs were hit by a ruling against the ride-hailing app 
company Uber

 that appeared to put dampener on the demand for private hire drivers. But 
construction workers were expecting a bumper pay day as the government prepared 
to increase spending on infrastructure projects andboost housebuilding

, with scaffolders commanding salaries of £50,000 a year or more in the east of 
the UK.
