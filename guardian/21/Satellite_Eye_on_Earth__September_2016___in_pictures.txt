This striking image shows the Caspian Sea, with shallow waters surrounding the 
Tyuleniy archipelago revealing dark green vegetation on the sea floor. Ocean 
scientist Norman Kuring of Nasa’s GoddardSpace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/space> Flight Center found a puzzling 
feature in the image – lines crisscrossing the sea bottom. What caused those 
lines? Similar lines show up in the world’s oceans because of trawling. But the 
scientific literature and a January satellite image suggest that a majority of 
the marks in the images were gouged by ice. In January, blocks of ice stand at 
the leading end of many lines, most notably in the north-east corner of the 
image. By April, ice has melted and only the scour marks persist.

In late September , the clouds around South Georgia Island parted to reveal a 
large bright-white iceberg floating in the Atlantic Ocean just north-west of 
the island. After calving, icebergs can travel many hundreds of miles from 
their calving front, moving most rapidly during the austral summer when sea ice 
melts and open water becomes more prevalent. Icebergs are named based on the 
Antarctic quadrant in which they originated and the order in which they were 
discovered. This iceberg, A66, was the 66th iceberg named which originated from 
the Bellingshausen/Weddell Sea.

The Ténéré region in north-eastern Niger is one of the hottest and driest 
regions in the Sahara desert, with average maximum temperatures above 40C 
between May and September and average annual precipitation 20–25mm. It is also 
one of the sunniest regions on Earth, clocking up about 4,000 hours of sunshine 
a year. The region’s geography largely consists of planes with sand dunes 
(ergs), seen as yellow areas in the upper image, that are oriented 
perpendicular to the persistent north-easterly wind (Harmattan) that blows sand 
and dust, visible here as faint feather-like structures.

In mid-September, wildfires continued to burn in Siberia amid an active fire 
season for the region – huge plumes of smoke can be seen here streaming toward 
the north-west. Areas in red show where Modis detected unusually warm 
temperatures associated with fire. Other data revealed that smoke from the 
fires was lofted high into the atmosphere, with the tops of the smoke plumes 
reaching an altitude of 9km (30,000ft).

Although it may appear as a watercolour painting, this image is a 
natural-colour capture of a plankton bloom in the Barents Sea. Plankton, the 
most abundant type of life found in the ocean, are microscopic marine plants 
that drift on or near the surface of the sea. They are sometimes referred to as 
“the grass of the sea” because they are the basic food on which all other 
marine life depends. Plankton are able to convert inorganic compounds such as 
water, nitrogen and carbon into complex organic materials. With their ability 
to ‘digest’ these compounds, they are credited with removing as much carbon 
dioxide from the atmosphere as their counterparts on land. As a result, the 
oceans have a profound influence on climate.

Some algae species are toxic or harmful. If they surge out of control during 
optimal blooming conditions they can exhaust the water of oxygen and suffocate 
larger fish. This phenomenon has dramatically increased in recent decades, and 
is particularly dangerous to fish farms because the fish cannot flee affected 
areas. Early warning of harmful blooms from satellites can help to prevent fish 
deaths.

Plumes of dust pour across northern Libya and the Mediterranean Sea in early 
September. Dust storms are a common occurrence and the primary natural hazard 
in Libya. They are often driven by hot, dry south or southeasterly wind known 
as the ghibli. Strong winds and dust storms can occur any time of the year, but 
are more common in the spring and fall.

Late on 21 September, a fire at a power plant substation in southern Puerto 
Rico triggered a cascade of problems across the island’s ageing electrical 
grid. The event knocked out power to nearly 1.5 million customers. According to 
news reports, the collapse of the power system caused widespread losses of 
water and air conditioning, traffic jams, and business and school closures.

From space, the effects appeared dramatic, as these nighttime images taken 
before and after the outage illustrate. The upper image was acquired at 2.50am 
local time on 21 September; the lower image at 2.31am local time the following 
day.

Both images were captured by a “day-night band,” which detects light in a 
range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques 
to observe signals such as gas flares, city lights, and reflected moonlight. 
Note that the brightness of the ocean surface varies between the images due to 
slightly different angles of moonlight on the water.

As nations develop their economies, younger generations are drawn from rural 
areas into cities seeking work. Urban growth rates in recent years have been 
particularly pronounced in lower and middle-income countries. Africa depicts 
this global migration trend in high relief. Nairobi is a prime example, with 
its population pushing upward and its boundaries pushing outward.

At the time of the last official government census in 2009, the population of 
Kenya numbered more than 38 million people, with 3.5 million housed in Nairobi 
– more than double the 1986 population. The images above, acquired in 1986 and 
2016, show the expansion of Kenya’s capital in the past three decades.

While such migration often mirrors economic advancement, it also presents 
socioeconomic and environmental challenges. Rapid urban growth strains existing 
infrastructure. Conservationists also note that it discourages the preservation 
of natural habitat in favor of building more developments. In Nairobi, 
urbanisation has caused the city to encroach on former green spaces such as the 
nearby national parks and forests.

Population density in Nairobi varies greatly, peaking in the city’s slums, 
which house roughly 2.5 million people in about 200 settlements. Roughly 60% of 
Nairobi’s population occupies just 6% of the land. The city’s largest slum, 
Kibera (the light-coloured patch north of Nairobi national park) is made up of 
small, tightly packed structures.

Although both of the images above were taken at a similar time of the year, 
the more recent one depicts greener vegetation, the result of a rainy El Niño 
cycle.
