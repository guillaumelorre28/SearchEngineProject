Summary

 * The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has promised to raise taxes on businesses 
to fund an overhaul of the UK’s educational system, promising employers they 
would see a return on the investment, with a future workforce that would be 
more skilled. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-tax-business-national-education-service-labour-conference>
 AsJessica Elgot reports, in an uncompromising speech, Corbyn also outlined 
plans for a surge of council house building funded by the removal of borrowing 
caps on local councils, a broad programme of public investment and a 
reinstatement of some trade union rights. Corbyn said he was offering “a new 
deal for rebuilding Britain”, including borrowing to invest billions in 
infrastructure, which he said would benefit businesses. However, he said, he 
wanted to see business play its part in return, by paying more tax to fund a 
proposed “national education service” – a lifelong service from preschools to 
adult education. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

And here’s an extract, from Aditya’s article.

At the heart of today’s speech Corbyn was making a big new argument, one I 
haven’t heard from a Labour leader’s speech in my entire working life. In just 
over a year, the Labour party has gone from a being desiccated husk of 
worn-down old leftists and elbows-out young Blairites to being a mass movement. 
At half a million members, it is the biggest party in Europe – at a time when 
other political parties are dying. To use business terminology, we have 
witnessed something akin to a reverse takeover of theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party. It is incomplete and it is 
certainly contested, but it is real.

And what the head of this new movement – confirmed as its leader twice in 12 
months – was sketching out today was the potential for a social movement in 
electoral politics. By invoking the victories ofSadiq Khan in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/sadiq-khans-first-100-days-as-london-mayor-how-is-he-doing>
 andMarvin Rees in Bristol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/marvin-rees-the-bristolian-bearing-the-weight-of-labour-hopes>
, he was showing that a social movement can yield victory at the ballot box.

Business groups express doubts about Corbyn's vision

Here is some business reaction to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

From Josh Hardie, the CBI’s director general

The CBI shares much of Labour’s vision for a fairer society underpinned by 
good business. But without an open dialogue there is a risk that some of their 
policies could take us backwards.

With such significant economic challenges ahead, the UK needs a strong 
opposition firing on all cylinders and providing progressive, practical new 
ideas.

The focus on research and development, infrastructure and education is 
encouraging, but artificially hiking wages and changing corporation tax could 
be investment dampeners, not drivers.

Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is certainly laying out a 
new way forward and we urge them to iron out inconsistent messages - especially 
the relationship between state and industry - and clarify policies that are 
sometimes hard to see delivered and paid for.

From Simon Walker, the Institute of Directors’ director general

A credible opposition is crucial in keeping the Government on its toes. We 
will need an effective Labour party challenging the Conservatives during Brexit 
negotiations to get a deal in the best interests of the country. WhileJeremy 
Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> did touch upon 
important areas for future economic success, like skills and infrastructure, he 
is not yet putting forward a plan which looks like a platform for government. 
The basic question is, how will he pay for these mammoth spending plans?

The problem for business is that it simply does not see the world in the same 
way as the Labour leader. The IoD does not think companies are beyond reproach, 
we have been publically critical of Mike Ashley and Philip Green, but in this 
speech business was presented as a comic-book villain. Over 80% of people work 
in the private sector and there are more than five million businesses in the 
UK. They are the source of the nation’s prosperity, the generators of 
employment and the funders of our public services. They are not a problem to be 
solved.

From Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation

Whilst it is welcome to hear the leader of the Opposition talking about the 
importance of industrial strategy and, the importance of manufacturing, his 
credentials are far from established in terms of demonstrating an understanding 
of the overwhelming benefits of liberal capitalism and the society he claims to 
support.

Corbyn's speech in numbers

The Press Association has filed some statistics about Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

There were a total of five mentions of either “socialism” or “socialist”. It 
was the first time socialism has been mentioned in a leader’s speech at the
Labour conference <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference> since 
2010, when Ed Miliband included it in a reference to his father.

“Deficit” was not mentioned once. 

A “Labour government” was mentioned eight times, while there were 13 
references to “the Tories”.

Corbyn referred to “the privileged few” on six occasions.

Other common words were “investment” (13 mentions), “workers” (10), 
“communities” (eight) and “housing” (seven).

Scotland was mentioned just once. 

Labour’s plan for a “national education service” received five mentions. 

Gordon Brown was the only former Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leader to get a namecheck in the 
speech.

Totalling just under 6,000 words, the speech was the shortest delivered by a 
Labour leader at conference since Tony Blair in 2006.

On the subject of Scotland, my colleague Libby Brooks has posted this on 
Twitter.
Libby Brooks (@libby_brooks) 
Also: no reference to Kezia Dugdale or Carwyn Jones in Corbyn's speech. Think 
that only Scot mentioned was Bill Shankley...#Lab16

Corbyn urges Labour MPs to 'end the trench warfare' as he sets out socialist 
vision

Anushka Asthana

Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> called on 
Labour MPs to “end the trench warfare” and get behind his socialist vision for 
Britain under which he would allow councils to borrow more, raise taxes on 
business to fund education and suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

Setting out a radical leftwing agenda that secured rapturous applause from 
supporters in the hall but a sceptical response from someLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs, Corbyn also hit back at 
critics who say he is uninterested in winning elections.

“Yes, our party is about campaigning and it’s about protest too but most of 
all it’s about winning power in local and national government to deliver the 
real change our country so desperately needs,” he said, in a speech widely seen 
as having been delivered confidently.

At the end of five days of continued infighting after his second convincing 
victory among Labour members, Corbyn used the speech to assert his authority 
but did admit that Labour had an “electoral mountain to climb”.

Addressing the issue of disunity in the party, he said: “Let’s be frank, no 
one will be convinced of a vision promoted by a divided party. We all agree on 
that.

“So I ask each and every one of you - accept the decision of the members, end 
the trench warfare and work together to take on the Tories.

“Anything else is a luxury that the millions of people who depend on Labour 
cannot afford.

The party leader set out key policies to the conference including:

 *  scrapping the local borrowing cap, which would allow councils to use their 
existing housing stock to raise money that could be ploughed back into 
housebuilding. 
 * raising corporation tax by up to 1.5% to fund an education maintenance 
allowance for college students as part of a national education service. 
 * Banning arm sales where there are credible reports of human rights abuses 
or war crimes being committed, “starting with Saudi Arabia”, which he said 
committed repeated violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes. 
“Britain continues to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, a country that the United 
Nations says is committing repeated violations of international humanitarian 
law, war crimes.

“In Yemen, just as we have seen taking place in Syria,” he said, leading to 
one of a number of standing applauses.

Perhaps the loudest and longest cheer came when Corbyn told the audience that 
he believed recent wars had spread terrorism, sectarianism and violence.

“That is why it was right to apologise on behalf of the party for the Iraq 
war, right to say that we have learned the lessons, and right to say that such 
a catastrophe must never be allowed to happen again,” he said as most of the 
audience rose to its feet but a few members walked out in anger at what they 
saw as an attack of the former Labour leader, Tony Blair.

The speech and response was in stark contrast to that delivered by the deputy 
leader, Tom Watson, a day earlier in which he urged delegates to stop “trashing 
the record” of Blair and Gordon Brown.

Pat McFadden, the Labour MP and former shadow Europe minister who now 
campaigns for Open Britain, said in a statement thatLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> should commit to keeping the UK 
in the single market. He said:

EU trade and EU immigration are issues that must be considered together, not 
apart.

Britain needs to be part of the EU Single Market, while recognising concerns 
over migration and seeking reform.

So while I welcome Jeremy’s support for the return of the Migration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration> Impact Fund, other changes must 
be considered. And Labour must wholeheartedly back Britain’s place in the 
single market.

Here is Ukip’s Tim Aker on Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

Today has confirmed that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has nothing to offer the 
millions of decent patrioticLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>
 supporters who voted Leave and want to see levels of migration brought down.

Several times Corbyn spoke about trust, but how can the voters ever trust 
Labour again when millions voted on June 23rd for control of their borders, yet 
Labour are determined to keep free the movement of people?

The Bank of England has confirmed that free movement of people has driven down 
wages for the working classes. Labour’s addiction to uncontrolled mass 
immigration makes them no friend to Britain’s lowest paid.

Many Labour MPs should be worried. The patriotic working class are leaving 
them in droves to Ukip and Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership will swell the ranks of 
Ukip as we grow and offer a genuine alternative to those who are worried about 
cuts to vital services, over development and Tory flip-flopping on Brexit.

Here is Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, on Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

Corbyn’s speech shows Labour’s proble. The last time I saw ovations like that 
was Iain Duncan Smith’s Blackpool conference speech. Here was a quiet man 
turning down the volume, especially on Europe. He barely mentioned Brexit and 
said nothing on the importance of the Single Market. It is clear that the 
Liberal Democrats are the only pro-European party now.

Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> are now two parties, one 
that wants to win but is being suffocated by Corbyn and his clique who just 
want to debate the issues of the day and seem to love the politics of the 
placard.

 This speech shows how Labour is trapped and there is no way out of their 
nightmare.

Patrick McCloughlin, the Conservative chairman, has issued this response to 
Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

This Conference has shown Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
are too divided, distracted and incompetent to build a country that works for 
everyone.

They would spend, borrow and tax even more than they did last time, support 
unlimited immigration, and cannot be trusted to keep our country safe.

They are not a credible alternative government and they have nothing to offer 
as we work to build a country that works for everyone.

Richard Adams

The pledge of £160m for an “arts pupil premium” will make some teachers happy, 
but it was unusual for Corbyn to offer it to “every primary school in England 
and Wales,” since education policy and funding in Wales is devolved to the 
assembly in Cardiff. Presumably a Labour-run Westminster government could send 
cheques to every Welsh primary school if it wished but would be unable to 
dictate how it was used.

But even if the £160m only went to English primary schools, it equates to £35 
for each of the four and a half million primary school pupils - enough for a 
school trip or two, perhaps, or a few music lessons.

This is from Sam Freedman, a former Department for Education official who is 
now a director at Teach First.
Sam Freedman (@Samfr) 
Why not just add £160m to the pupil premium? It can already be used for arts. 
Let schools decide their spending priorities.https://t.co/J8vagEm73H

Corbyn's speech - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about Jeremy 
Corbyn’s speech. Generally, the verdict is very positive – at least by 
comparison with previous Corbyn speeches.

From ITV’s Robert Peston:
Robert Peston (@Peston) 
This is certainly the most relaxed and assured performance I have seen by 
@jeremycorbyn <https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn> - so far #Lab16 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lab16?src=hash>

From ITV’s Paul Brand:

This is best delivery I've seen from Corbyn. Many in his own party say he's no 
Prime Minister, but he looks more like a leader today#Lab16

Quick take -Corbyn much better delivery vs last year. asserts mandate in 
party, trying to bend anti-elite/establishment political wave left

From the Times’s Patrick Kidd:
Patrick Kidd (@patrick_kidd) 
Almost an hour-long speech by Corbyn, very well received and much much better 
delivered than before. Fair bit of ideology, but not much meat

From the Herald’s Iain McWhirter:
Iain Macwhirter (@iainmacwhirter) 
Corbyn's speech was moderate, even pro-business at times. Nothing about 
Trident or reversing Brexit. No class struggle rhetoric. Wilsonite.

Have to beware the soft bigotry of low expectations when judging Corbyn, but 
that was up there with some of Ed Miliband's off year efforts

From the Guardian’s Rafael Behr:
Rafael Behr (@rafaelbehr) 
That speech was shrewdly crafted to please both Momentummy audience and a lot, 
maybe majority of pre-CorbynLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>
. Unity of soft-left.

From LBC’s Iain Dale:
Iain Dale (@IainDale) 
Very well delivered & well crafted speech by @jeremycorbyn 
<https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn>. Not sure 'Socialism for the 21st Century' 
is an election winning slogan, though!

Very good speech. Corbyn's best delivery - will tempt back some of PLP's soft 
centre and reassure members worried about competence.

A well-delivered speech from Jeremy with a firm direction. Let's all do what 
we can to help tackle the 'electoral mountain' he identifies.

 * The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has promised to raise taxes on businesses 
to fund an overhaul of the UK’s educational system, promising employers they 
would see a return on the investment, with a future workforce that would be 
more skilled. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-tax-business-national-education-service-labour-conference>
 AsJessica Elgot reports, in an uncompromising speech, Corbyn also outlined 
plans for a surge of council house building funded by the removal of borrowing 
caps on local councils, a broad programme of public investment and a 
reinstatement of some trade union rights. Corbyn said he was offering “a new 
deal for rebuilding Britain”, including borrowing to invest billions in 
infrastructure, which he said would benefit businesses. However, he said, he 
wanted to see business play its part in return, by paying more tax to fund a 
proposed “national education service” – a lifelong service from preschools to 
adult education. 
That’s all from me for today.

<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-party-conference-panel-views>
And here’s an extract, from Aditya’s article.

At the heart of today’s speech Corbyn was making a big new argument, one I 
haven’t heard from a Labour leader’s speech in my entire working life. In just 
over a year, the Labour party has gone from a being desiccated husk of 
worn-down old leftists and elbows-out young Blairites to being a mass movement. 
At half a million members, it is the biggest party in Europe – at a time when 
other political parties are dying. To use business terminology, we have 
witnessed something akin to a reverse takeover of theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party. It is incomplete and it is 
certainly contested, but it is real.

And what the head of this new movement – confirmed as its leader twice in 12 
months – was sketching out today was the potential for a social movement in 
electoral politics. By invoking the victories ofSadiq Khan in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/sadiq-khans-first-100-days-as-london-mayor-how-is-he-doing>
 andMarvin Rees in Bristol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/marvin-rees-the-bristolian-bearing-the-weight-of-labour-hopes>
, he was showing that a social movement can yield victory at the ballot box.
 
Here is some business reaction to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

From Josh Hardie, the CBI’s director general

The CBI shares much of Labour’s vision for a fairer society underpinned by 
good business. But without an open dialogue there is a risk that some of their 
policies could take us backwards.

With such significant economic challenges ahead, the UK needs a strong 
opposition firing on all cylinders and providing progressive, practical new 
ideas.

The focus on research and development, infrastructure and education is 
encouraging, but artificially hiking wages and changing corporation tax could 
be investment dampeners, not drivers.

Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is certainly laying out a 
new way forward and we urge them to iron out inconsistent messages - especially 
the relationship between state and industry - and clarify policies that are 
sometimes hard to see delivered and paid for.

From Simon Walker, the Institute of Directors’ director general

A credible opposition is crucial in keeping the Government on its toes. We 
will need an effective Labour party challenging the Conservatives during Brexit 
negotiations to get a deal in the best interests of the country. WhileJeremy 
Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> did touch upon 
important areas for future economic success, like skills and infrastructure, he 
is not yet putting forward a plan which looks like a platform for government. 
The basic question is, how will he pay for these mammoth spending plans?

The problem for business is that it simply does not see the world in the same 
way as the Labour leader. The IoD does not think companies are beyond reproach, 
we have been publically critical of Mike Ashley and Philip Green, but in this 
speech business was presented as a comic-book villain. Over 80% of people work 
in the private sector and there are more than five million businesses in the 
UK. They are the source of the nation’s prosperity, the generators of 
employment and the funders of our public services. They are not a problem to be 
solved.

From Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation

Whilst it is welcome to hear the leader of the Opposition talking about the 
importance of industrial strategy and, the importance of manufacturing, his 
credentials are far from established in terms of demonstrating an understanding 
of the overwhelming benefits of liberal capitalism and the society he claims to 
support.
 
The Press Association has filed some statistics about Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

There were a total of five mentions of either “socialism” or “socialist”. It 
was the first time socialism has been mentioned in a leader’s speech at the
Labour conference <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference> since 
2010, when Ed Miliband included it in a reference to his father.

“Deficit” was not mentioned once. 

A “Labour government” was mentioned eight times, while there were 13 
references to “the Tories”.

Corbyn referred to “the privileged few” on six occasions.

Other common words were “investment” (13 mentions), “workers” (10), 
“communities” (eight) and “housing” (seven).

Scotland was mentioned just once. 

Labour’s plan for a “national education service” received five mentions. 

Gordon Brown was the only former Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leader to get a namecheck in the 
speech.

Totalling just under 6,000 words, the speech was the shortest delivered by a 
Labour leader at conference since Tony Blair in 2006.

On the subject of Scotland, my colleague Libby Brooks has posted this on 
Twitter.
Libby Brooks (@libby_brooks) 
Also: no reference to Kezia Dugdale or Carwyn Jones in Corbyn's speech. Think 
that only Scot mentioned was Bill Shankley...#Lab16

Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> called on 
Labour MPs to “end the trench warfare” and get behind his socialist vision for 
Britain under which he would allow councils to borrow more, raise taxes on 
business to fund education and suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

Setting out a radical leftwing agenda that secured rapturous applause from 
supporters in the hall but a sceptical response from someLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs, Corbyn also hit back at 
critics who say he is uninterested in winning elections.

“Yes, our party is about campaigning and it’s about protest too but most of 
all it’s about winning power in local and national government to deliver the 
real change our country so desperately needs,” he said, in a speech widely seen 
as having been delivered confidently.

At the end of five days of continued infighting after his second convincing 
victory among Labour members, Corbyn used the speech to assert his authority 
but did admit that Labour had an “electoral mountain to climb”.

Addressing the issue of disunity in the party, he said: “Let’s be frank, no 
one will be convinced of a vision promoted by a divided party. We all agree on 
that.

“So I ask each and every one of you - accept the decision of the members, end 
the trench warfare and work together to take on the Tories.

“Anything else is a luxury that the millions of people who depend on Labour 
cannot afford.

The party leader set out key policies to the conference including:

 *  scrapping the local borrowing cap, which would allow councils to use their 
existing housing stock to raise money that could be ploughed back into 
housebuilding. 
 * raising corporation tax by up to 1.5% to fund an education maintenance 
allowance for college students as part of a national education service. 
 * Banning arm sales where there are credible reports of human rights abuses 
or war crimes being committed, “starting with Saudi Arabia”, which he said 
committed repeated violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes. 
“Britain continues to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, a country that the United 
Nations says is committing repeated violations of international humanitarian 
law, war crimes.

“In Yemen, just as we have seen taking place in Syria,” he said, leading to 
one of a number of standing applauses.

Perhaps the loudest and longest cheer came when Corbyn told the audience that 
he believed recent wars had spread terrorism, sectarianism and violence.

“That is why it was right to apologise on behalf of the party for the Iraq 
war, right to say that we have learned the lessons, and right to say that such 
a catastrophe must never be allowed to happen again,” he said as most of the 
audience rose to its feet but a few members walked out in anger at what they 
saw as an attack of the former Labour leader, Tony Blair.

The speech and response was in stark contrast to that delivered by the deputy 
leader, Tom Watson, a day earlier in which he urged delegates to stop “trashing 
the record” of Blair and Gordon Brown.

Pat McFadden, the Labour MP and former shadow Europe minister who now 
campaigns for Open Britain, said in a statement thatLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> should commit to keeping the UK 
in the single market. He said:

EU trade and EU immigration are issues that must be considered together, not 
apart.

Britain needs to be part of the EU Single Market, while recognising concerns 
over migration and seeking reform.

So while I welcome Jeremy’s support for the return of the Migration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration> Impact Fund, other changes must 
be considered. And Labour must wholeheartedly back Britain’s place in the 
single market.

Here is Ukip’s Tim Aker on Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

Today has confirmed that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has nothing to offer the 
millions of decent patrioticLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>
 supporters who voted Leave and want to see levels of migration brought down.

Several times Corbyn spoke about trust, but how can the voters ever trust 
Labour again when millions voted on June 23rd for control of their borders, yet 
Labour are determined to keep free the movement of people?

The Bank of England has confirmed that free movement of people has driven down 
wages for the working classes. Labour’s addiction to uncontrolled mass 
immigration makes them no friend to Britain’s lowest paid.

Many Labour MPs should be worried. The patriotic working class are leaving 
them in droves to Ukip and Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership will swell the ranks of 
Ukip as we grow and offer a genuine alternative to those who are worried about 
cuts to vital services, over development and Tory flip-flopping on Brexit.
 
Here is Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, on Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

Corbyn’s speech shows Labour’s proble. The last time I saw ovations like that 
was Iain Duncan Smith’s Blackpool conference speech. Here was a quiet man 
turning down the volume, especially on Europe. He barely mentioned Brexit and 
said nothing on the importance of the Single Market. It is clear that the 
Liberal Democrats are the only pro-European party now.

Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> are now two parties, one 
that wants to win but is being suffocated by Corbyn and his clique who just 
want to debate the issues of the day and seem to love the politics of the 
placard.

 This speech shows how Labour is trapped and there is no way out of their 
nightmare.
 
Patrick McCloughlin, the Conservative chairman, has issued this response to 
Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

This Conference has shown Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
are too divided, distracted and incompetent to build a country that works for 
everyone.

They would spend, borrow and tax even more than they did last time, support 
unlimited immigration, and cannot be trusted to keep our country safe.

They are not a credible alternative government and they have nothing to offer 
as we work to build a country that works for everyone.
 
The pledge of £160m for an “arts pupil premium” will make some teachers happy, 
but it was unusual for Corbyn to offer it to “every primary school in England 
and Wales,” since education policy and funding in Wales is devolved to the 
assembly in Cardiff. Presumably a Labour-run Westminster government could send 
cheques to every Welsh primary school if it wished but would be unable to 
dictate how it was used.

But even if the £160m only went to English primary schools, it equates to £35 
for each of the four and a half million primary school pupils - enough for a 
school trip or two, perhaps, or a few music lessons.

This is from Sam Freedman, a former Department for Education official who is 
now a director at Teach First.
Sam Freedman (@Samfr) 
Why not just add £160m to the pupil premium? It can already be used for arts. 
Let schools decide their spending priorities.https://t.co/J8vagEm73H

Mainly Corbyn's greatest hits in terms of policies - his 10 commitments (not 
the ten commandments)

Nick Robinson (@bbcnickrobinson) 
It's his party now. @jeremycorbyn <https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn> looks at 
ease giving leader's speech. Clearly got a new scriptwriter & has practised 
with autocue 1/2

'16 Corbyn - "21st century socialism" 
'06 Blair - we won because had "courage to be true to our values"
Same sentiment but so different

From the Herald’s Iain McWhirter:
Iain Macwhirter (@iainmacwhirter) 
Corbyn's speech was moderate, even pro-business at times. Nothing about 
Trident or reversing Brexit. No class struggle rhetoric. Wilsonite.

From the Spectator’s James Forsyth:
James Forsyth (@JGForsyth) 
Have to beware the soft bigotry of low expectations when judging Corbyn, but 
that was up there with some of Ed Miliband's off year efforts

From the Guardian’s Rafael Behr:
Rafael Behr (@rafaelbehr) 
That speech was shrewdly crafted to please both Momentummy audience and a lot, 
maybe majority of pre-CorbynLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>
. Unity of soft-left.

From LBC’s Iain Dale:
Iain Dale (@IainDale) 
Very well delivered & well crafted speech by @jeremycorbyn 
<https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn>. Not sure 'Socialism for the 21st Century' 
is an election winning slogan, though!

From the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush:
Stephen Bush (@stephenkb) 
Very good speech. Corbyn's best delivery - will tempt back some of PLP's soft 
centre and reassure members worried about competence.

Crickey! Even John Woodcock has found something positive to say about the 
speech.
John Woodcock (@JWoodcockMP) 
A well-delivered speech from Jeremy with a firm direction. Let's all do what 
we can to help tackle the 'electoral mountain' he identifies.

Woodcock is a Blairite MP who has been one of Jeremy Corbyn’s fiercest critics.

Corbyn's speech was apparently the joint work of aides Seumas Milne and Andrew 
Fisher, if you're the sort of person who likes to know that.
