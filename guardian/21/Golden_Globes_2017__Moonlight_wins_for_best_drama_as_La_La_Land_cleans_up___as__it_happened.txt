So here’s what we can learn from tonight:

 * La La Land is the film to beat at this stage and Hollywood does love to 
reward a musical so it’s likely to win the most Oscars next month but … 
 * Moonlight sneaking in with a surprise win for best motion picture drama 
does suggest that it could be an Oscars contender too 
 * Manchester by the Sea has lost a bit of steam after tonight with Casey 
Affleck still the favourite for best actor, but Michelle Williams and director 
Kenneth Lonergan likely to miss out on Oscars 
 * Isabelle Huppert is now the not-so-dark horse for a best actress win, but 
will the Academy reward such a difficult film? 
 * The night was a fitting finale for a great year for diversity on the small 
screen with Atlanta, its star Donald Glover and Tracee Ellis Ross all winning 
 * HFPA voters like them some Tom Ford perfume

WINNER: Moonlight, best motion picture – drama

Benjamin Lee

Success! Despite being shut out of all the other awards, Moonlight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/moonlight> has won the main award of the 
night and it’s a hugely deserving win.

A standing ovation from the audience implies that it’s also a popular result 
at the ceremony. Barry Jenkins, as eloquent as ever, will hopefully be 
accepting an Oscar next month. And that’s the last award of the night!

WINNER: Isabelle Huppert (Elle), best actress in a motion picture – drama

Benjamin Lee

Woah! Insane and brilliant surprise here that Huppert wins for her performance 
in the pitch black rape revenge comedy from Paul Verhoeven. She is equally 
shocked and it’s a fascinatingly barmy choice from the HFPA. She was an 
outsider for an Oscar nomination but now this seems like it will happen for 
sure.

Isabelle Huppert totally guffawed at Leonardo DiCaprio’s pronunciation of her 
name as well which needs a gif right away. Oh and she carried on talking even 
after the sound cut out.

WINNER: Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea), best actor in a motion picture 
– drama

Benjamin Lee

The favourite for the award has managed to combat negative publicity from 
sexual harassment claims made back in 2010 to win big tonight and may well 
continue to do the same at the Oscars next month.

He’s already apologised for his bedraggled appearance on the red carpet, which 
is for a film he is currently shooting. He likened it to looking like a 
caveman. Awkward music cutting him off again.

WINNER: La La Land, best motion picture – comedy or musical

Benjamin Lee

And there you are. The Globes does love a chance to justify the addition of 
the word “musical” to this category but it’s also a deserving winner.

Every single winner from the film has crowbarred in a narrative about how 
daring the film is and what a risk it was to make it. But, come on, it’s a 
starry musical, a genre that typically picks up awards and scores well at the 
box office. So lay off that one, yeah?

WINNER: Emma Stone (La La Land), best actress in a motion picture – comedy or 
musical

Benjamin Lee

More La La Land! A very deserving Emma Stone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-stone> whose performance in the musical 
is a real career highlight. She’s tearful and genuine and it helps her path to 
winning the best actress Oscar but that also depends on who wins the Globe for 
best actress in a drama ...

WINNER: Donald Glover (Atlanta), best actor in a TV series – comedy or musical

Benjamin Lee

More love for Atlanta! A refreshing change here for a category that often 
cheats by giving the award to Jeffrey Tambor for starring in Transparent, a 
drama with comedic elements.

Glover is overwhelmed again. He said: “I grew up in a house where magic wasn’t 
allowed so everyone in here is magic.” He talks about doing things that he 
never thought possible. Good speech and shows that the small screen choices 
continue to be a tad more daring than the movie picks.

WINNER: Damien Chazelle (La La Land), best director

Benjamin Lee

And yeah, we saw this one coming. It’s a big night for the romantic musical 
and the 31-year-old picks up his second award for the night. He got played off 
with a musical cue, which seemed a tad harsh.

Which also means that it looks as if Moonlight might go away empty-handed 
tonight, despite being the most rewarded film of the season so far from the 
critics circles. It also means thatLa La Land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/la-la-land> has really improved its chances 
at the Oscars.

So here’s what we can learn from tonight:

 * La La Land is the film to beat at this stage and Hollywood does love to 
reward a musical so it’s likely to win the most Oscars next month but … 
 * Moonlight sneaking in with a surprise win for best motion picture drama 
does suggest that it could be an Oscars contender too 
 * Manchester by the Sea has lost a bit of steam after tonight with Casey 
Affleck still the favourite for best actor, but Michelle Williams and director 
Kenneth Lonergan likely to miss out on Oscars 
 * Isabelle Huppert is now the not-so-dark horse for a best actress win, but 
will the Academy reward such a difficult film? 
 * The night was a fitting finale for a great year for diversity on the small 
screen with Atlanta, its star Donald Glover and Tracee Ellis Ross all winning 
 * HFPA voters like them some Tom Ford perfume  
Success! Despite being shut out of all the other awards, Moonlight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/moonlight> has won the main award of the 
night and it’s a hugely deserving win.

A standing ovation from the audience implies that it’s also a popular result 
at the ceremony. Barry Jenkins, as eloquent as ever, will hopefully be 
accepting an Oscar next month. And that’s the last award of the night!
 
Woah! Insane and brilliant surprise here that Huppert wins for her performance 
in the pitch black rape revenge comedy from Paul Verhoeven. She is equally 
shocked and it’s a fascinatingly barmy choice from the HFPA. She was an 
outsider for an Oscar nomination but now this seems like it will happen for 
sure.

Isabelle Huppert totally guffawed at Leonardo DiCaprio’s pronunciation of her 
name as well which needs a gif right away. Oh and she carried on talking even 
after the sound cut out.
 
We are all Denzel right now:

The favourite for the award has managed to combat negative publicity from 
sexual harassment claims made back in 2010 to win big tonight and may well 
continue to do the same at the Oscars next month.

He’s already apologised for his bedraggled appearance on the red carpet, which 
is for a film he is currently shooting. He likened it to looking like a 
caveman. Awkward music cutting him off again.
 
RECORD ALERT: La La Land is now the most awarded film 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/la-la-land-breaks-golden-globe-winners-record-wins-961526>
 in Golden Globes history. It has picked up seven awards, beating the previous 
shared record of six wins by One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Midnight 
Express.
 
Here’s Peter Bradshaw’s five-star review of La La Land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/la-la-land> from its debut at last year’s 
Venice film festival:

La La Land review: Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone shine in a sun-drenched musical 
masterpiece
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone> 
And there you are. The Globes does love a chance to justify the addition of 
the word “musical” to this category but it’s also a deserving winner.

Every single winner from the film has crowbarred in a narrative about how 
daring the film is and what a risk it was to make it. But, come on, it’s a 
starry musical, a genre that typically picks up awards and scores well at the 
box office. So lay off that one, yeah?

Streep isn’t the only actor to call out Trump tonight. Viola Davis also had 
this to say:

Viola Davis also addressed Trump backstage, FYI. Here’s what she said about 
ensuring we don’t lose the social progress we’ve made:pic.twitter.com/CqFlN5vZeZ

And here’s the speech that everyone will be talking about tomorrow:

More La La Land! A very deserving Emma Stone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-stone> whose performance in the musical 
is a real career highlight. She’s tearful and genuine and it helps her path to 
winning the best actress Oscar but that also depends on who wins the Globe for 
best actress in a drama ...

People are ANGRY about Moonlight <https://www.theguardian.com/film/moonlight> 
being left out in the cold:

I did promise you this and now you can take a look. The funniest moment from 
tonight’s largely not-that-funny show: Kristen Wiig and Steve Carell talking 
about divorce and dead pets:
 
More love for Atlanta! A refreshing change here for a category that often 
cheats by giving the award to Jeffrey Tambor for starring in Transparent, a 
drama with comedic elements.

Glover is overwhelmed again. He said: “I grew up in a house where magic wasn’t 
allowed so everyone in here is magic.” He talks about doing things that he 
never thought possible. Good speech and shows that the small screen choices 
continue to be a tad more daring than the movie picks.
 
And yeah, we saw this one coming. It’s a big night for the romantic musical 
and the 31-year-old picks up his second award for the night. He got played off 
with a musical cue, which seemed a tad harsh.

Which also means that it looks as if Moonlight might go away empty-handed 
tonight, despite being the most rewarded film of the season so far from the 
critics circles. It also means thatLa La Land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/la-la-land> has really improved its chances 
at the Oscars.
