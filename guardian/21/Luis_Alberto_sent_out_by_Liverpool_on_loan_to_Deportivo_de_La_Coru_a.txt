but has made only 12 appearances, having failed to convince Rodgers he has the 
necessary quality for a Premier League midfield.

Alberto spent last season on loan at Málaga in the hope a return to Spain 
would enhance his experience and credentials but struggled to secure a regular 
place in Javi Gracia’s side.

Liverpool have the midfielder under contract for three more years and, in the 
absence of an offer for a permanent exit, have sanctioned a second season on 
loan. The former Barcelona B player agreed to join Deportivo following talks 
with their head coach Victor Sánchez, who worked with Alberto during his time 
as Sevilla’s assistant manager.

“I want to reconnect with the pitch, enjoy myself, give joy to the fans and 
return the faith of my coach,” Alberto said. “I spoke with the coach, who knew 
me from Sevilla.

“He told me to come here and that I’d be very happy and feel like a player 
again at the level of two years ago. He knows me and where I have to improve 
and now I’ll put myself at his disposal.”
