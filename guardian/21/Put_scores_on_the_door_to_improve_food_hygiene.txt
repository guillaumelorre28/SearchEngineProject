Your informative piece (One in seven takeaways fail hygiene tests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/23/revealed-uk-takeaways-fail-food-hygiene-tests-restaurants-takeaways>
, 24 September) mentions that theFood Standards Agency 
<http://ratings.food.gov.uk/> ranks all food providers with a score of zero to 
five. In Wales, all food businesses are legally required to display their score 
in a prominent place in all entrances so that potential customers are aware of 
it and can make an informed decision on whether to enter.

There is no such statutory requirement in England and it is left to the 
discretion of individual food business operators. In the light of the appalling 
hygiene standards in many food premises in England, revealed in your article, 
perhaps it is time for ministers to follow the good practice inWales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> and make it mandatory for food 
businesses to display their scores on the door.

• The hygiene rating of takeaways is based on an FSA standard. The actual 
inspections are in the hands of each local authority. The best and worst areas 
listed might reflect not much more than the quality and frequency of 
inspections, likely significant variables given the pressure on local 
government finance.
