Thanks for reading. That was an excellent second half from Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> and Davis, introduced at the 
break, was integral to it. He was everywhere and provided the burst that led to 
Rodriguez’s first goal. The striker’s second was an absolute peach. Bournemouth 
didn’t create a thing of note after the break, and looked surprisingly flat. No 
alarm bells for them, it’s still a good season – but they’ll want to put it 
right over Christmas.

Comprehensive and deserved. Derby or not, Saints take the honours and go

90+4 min: Kristof in Berlin writes, quite rightly – “It’s a relief to see Jay 
Rodriguez in such good form, after these two horrible seasons full of 
Sturridge-style injury backlash. Hope he can maintain that for a while now!”

Yep. He’s a heck of a player when fit and it’s great to see that now.

90+3 min: Shane Long comes on for two-goal Rodriguez, who has more than earned 
the ovation he gets from the boisterous away following.

89 min: Cedric Soares is having some treatment. I think he’ll be alright. Time 
is just running down now.Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth>, after that first 20 
minutes, have been flat and disappointing. Couldn’t see this coming when, or in 
the minutes after, they took the lead – not remotely.

Not looking very likely though; they apply a bit of pressure but it breaks down

Goal! Bournemouth 1-3 Southampton (Rodriguez 85)

What a goal! A Redmond sortie along the left edge of the box eventually sees 
the ball cannon off the winger’s face. So far, so scruffy, but it bounces 
perfectly for Rodriguez 20 yards out. He spins and volleys a vicious, dipping 
shot over Boruc and into the top corner. Make sure you see it later – it was a 
really marvellous strike. Game over, and this is what Saints deserve on their 
second-half performance.

83 min: Fraser’s left-sided cross is deflected across goal but there is nobody 
waiting to convert, which annoys the home fans. They win another corner seconds 
later though, from which Van Dijk clear Ibe’s delivery.

81 min: Redmond brings the ball forwards on the left, sets his sights and 
curls a right-footed dipper only just over. That would have closed the matter.

66 min: Good spell of Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> pressure, with Tadic to the 
fore immediately, and they win a corner. Boruc catches Bertrand’s delivery with 
no fuss.

62 min: But then King gets the chance to stretch those legs out and sprint 
towards the box. For a moment it’s three against two, and he could just carry 
on and take on Van Dijk, but his ball left finds neither Fraser nor Wilson and 
the chance goes.Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> 
replace the patchy Boufal with Tadic. Boufal looks annoyed.

58 min: Bournemouth look really vulnerable now and Rodriguez, mugging Cook by 
the byline, runs inside and looks to power past Boruc from a sharp angle on the 
left. The goalkeeper comes out and blocks the shot really well.

54 min: Southampton’s fans are asking the home faithful how poor their team 
must be considering they’ve allowed Saints to score twice away. Not in as many 
words. They’d have had three if Boufal, dancing away down the left, had found 
Redmond with his final pass just then.

53 min: King takes the ball into the box and then lays left to Wilson, who 
takes it first-time but goes well over. The hosts need a response.

52 min: Perhaps they’ll look to turn the screw instead. But when they win a 
corner, they play it short and are then stupidly caught offside.

51 min: Imagine Saints will try and lock the door now – although Redmond gets 
to the line and his cross is cleared ahead of Rodriguez. They started this half 
the sharper and were rewarded.

Goal! Bournemouth 1-2 Southampton (Rodriguez 48)

And what that won’t tell you is just how well the half-time change worked! 
Davis, in trademark fashion, bursts into the right hand side of the box via a 
sublime Boufal backheel, draws Boruc from an angle and then centres for 
Rodriguez to slide in and finish from inches! That is exactly what Davis was 
brought on for – and it has paid instant dividends!

46 min: Early chance for Redmond, teed up by an awful Francis header – but Ake 
comes over to take the sting out of his shot and Boruc saves. Escape for the 
home side there.

Half-time sub for Saints: Davis on for Reed in midfield. Reed has done OK in 
his first start for a long, long time – but I call this an upgrade.

Wonder if Saints will find that Redmond miss costly. Clear chances have been 
few, all told. What do YOU think?

Half-time: Bournemouth 1-1 Southampton

The visitors finish the half with probably their longest spell of possession, 
and that’s your lot. Early goals traded between Ake and Bertrand, and a 
rattling first 25 minutes or so, before things calmed down rather. All to play 
for. I’ll be back.

44 min: Yoshida has had a good half and anticipates well to stop Daniels 
reaching the byline. Not the first time I’ve said something like that. Fonte 
watches on.

37 min: Daniels does well to intercept a through ball intended for Rodriguez 
and sets a counterattack in train, from which Pugh runs up the left and crosses

34 min: Boufal goes down dramatically on the edge of the area under Wilshere’s 
challenge but Clattenburg isn’t having it. Moments later, when play finally 
stops, he books Boufal for what replays show was an egregious dive when he’d 
made room for a shot.

30 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are 
certainly giving as good as they get now. They’re starting to control the ball 
rather better ... and should take the lead! It’s Bertrand running down the 
left, cutting back wonderfully for Redmond, and he lets the ball run across his 
body before completely miscuing from 12 yards! If he connects properly, which 
he should do, it’s a goal.

25 min: Bournemouth are still causing most of the problems. Their movement is 
very sharp .. although, of course, as I write that Boufal nudges Redmond 
through to the byline and his low centre across goal is desperately hacked 
away. I think that was Redmond’s first real involvement.

Jay Rodriguez’s stunning strike seals Southampton victory at Bournemouth

Thanks for reading. That was an excellent second half from Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> and Davis, introduced at the 
break, was integral to it. He was everywhere and provided the burst that led to 
Rodriguez’s first goal. The striker’s second was an absolute peach. Bournemouth 
didn’t create a thing of note after the break, and looked surprisingly flat. No 
alarm bells for them, it’s still a good season – but they’ll want to put it 
right over Christmas.

Comprehensive and deserved. Derby or not, Saints take the honours and go 
seventh!
 
90+4 min: Kristof in Berlin writes, quite rightly – “It’s a relief to see Jay 
Rodriguez in such good form, after these two horrible seasons full of 
Sturridge-style injury backlash. Hope he can maintain that for a while now!”

Yep. He’s a heck of a player when fit and it’s great to see that now.
 
90+3 min: Shane Long comes on for two-goal Rodriguez, who has more than earned 
the ovation he gets from the boisterous away following.
 
90+2 min: A slight fumble from Forster as Cook fires in from 25 yards, but no 
big drama.
 
90+1 min: Van Dijk, watching a looping ball come down, tries for a spectacular 
goal of his own but it’s gathered by Boruc. Five added minutes to play here.
 
89 min: Cedric Soares is having some treatment. I think he’ll be alright. Time 
is just running down now.Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth>, after that first 20 
minutes, have been flat and disappointing. Couldn’t see this coming when, or in 
the minutes after, they took the lead – not remotely.
 
88 min: Let’s not forget what Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> managed against Liverpool. 
Not looking very likely though; they apply a bit of pressure but it breaks down 
quickly.
 
What a goal! A Redmond sortie along the left edge of the box eventually sees 
the ball cannon off the winger’s face. So far, so scruffy, but it bounces 
perfectly for Rodriguez 20 yards out. He spins and volleys a vicious, dipping 
shot over Boruc and into the top corner. Make sure you see it later – it was a 
really marvellous strike. Game over, and this is what Saints deserve on their 
second-half performance.

83 min: Fraser’s left-sided cross is deflected across goal but there is nobody 
waiting to convert, which annoys the home fans. They win another corner seconds 
later though, from which Van Dijk clear Ibe’s delivery.
 
82 min: Bournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> corner, 
their first of the half. It’s sent right into Forster’s paws. An abject waste.
 
81 min: Redmond brings the ball forwards on the left, sets his sights and 
curls a right-footed dipper only just over. That would have closed the matter.
 
80 min: Some lengthy Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> possession around the edge 
of the box is closed out by a fine Davis tackle on Wilshere. Davis has been the 
game’s best player since his arrival.
 
78 min: Another yellow, now for Davis, who sends Smith tumbling.
 
77 min: Clasie is booked for blocking Wilshere, who has stepped up a gear 
after a very quiet half so far. A few signs of aBournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> revival but it needs to 
happen soon.

75 min: No shot, it goes short to Arter and takes some time to make its way 
into the box. Modest pressure is sustained until a Fraser header falls into 
Forster’s arms.
 
74 min: There is a wall of five Saints midfielders in front of Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> whenever they try and build 
something. But one of them, Hojbjerg, now fouls Wilshere in shooting range...
 
72 min: Better from Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> and Cook finds Francis for a 
right-sided cross. The home fans want a handball from Bertrand but it was more 
like midriff. They will now bring Jordon Ibe on for King.
 
69 min: Davis is at the heart of everything Saints do and almost releases 
Bertrand with a neat flick. They look much likelier to score again than
Bournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> do to equalise.
 
67 min: Redmond sends Bertrand down to the line and his chip beyond the back 
post finds a poised Hojbjerg, who lashes past Boruc but sees Ake hack away from 
a yard or two in front of the line.
 
66 min: Good spell of Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> pressure, with Tadic to the 
fore immediately, and they win a corner. Boruc catches Bertrand’s delivery with 
no fuss.
 
64 min: And another Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> change. Wilson off and 
Afobe, who he’d replaced in the starting lineup, on.
 
62 min: But then King gets the chance to stretch those legs out and sprint 
towards the box. For a moment it’s three against two, and he could just carry 
on and take on Van Dijk, but his ball left finds neither Fraser nor Wilson and 
the chance goes.Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> 
replace the patchy Boufal with Tadic. Boufal looks annoyed.
 
60 min: Noticeable in this half is that Puel’s side are allowing Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> much, much less time on the 
ball.
 
58 min: Bournemouth look really vulnerable now and Rodriguez, mugging Cook by 
the byline, runs inside and looks to power past Boruc from a sharp angle on the 
left. The goalkeeper comes out and blocks the shot really well.
 
56 min: Wilshere chips in to Pugh, who goes down after Yoshida slides in, and 
Bournemouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> hope for a 
penalty but it goes the other way. We’ll see no more of Pugh – he’s replaced by 
Liverpool slayer Ryan Fraser!
 
54 min: Southampton’s fans are asking the home faithful how poor their team 
must be considering they’ve allowed Saints to score twice away. Not in as many 
words. They’d have had three if Boufal, dancing away down the left, had found 
Redmond with his final pass just then.
 
53 min: King takes the ball into the box and then lays left to Wilson, who 
takes it first-time but goes well over. The hosts need a response.
 
52 min: Perhaps they’ll look to turn the screw instead. But when they win a 
corner, they play it short and are then stupidly caught offside.
 
51 min: Imagine Saints will try and lock the door now – although Redmond gets 
to the line and his cross is cleared ahead of Rodriguez. They started this half 
the sharper and were rewarded.
 
And what that won’t tell you is just how well the half-time change worked! 
Davis, in trademark fashion, bursts into the right hand side of the box via a 
sublime Boufal backheel, draws Boruc from an angle and then centres for 
Rodriguez to slide in and finish from inches! That is exactly what Davis was 
brought on for – and it has paid instant dividends!

46 min: Early chance for Redmond, teed up by an awful Francis header – but Ake 
comes over to take the sting out of his shot and Boruc saves. Escape for the 
home side there.
 
They have changed ends.
 
Half-time sub for Saints: Davis on for Reed in midfield. Reed has done OK in 
his first start for a long, long time – but I call this an upgrade.
 
Wonder if Saints will find that Redmond miss costly. Clear chances have been 
few, all told. What do YOU think?
 
The visitors finish the half with probably their longest spell of possession, 
and that’s your lot. Early goals traded between Ake and Bertrand, and a 
rattling first 25 minutes or so, before things calmed down rather. All to play 
for. I’ll be back.
 
44 min: Yoshida has had a good half and anticipates well to stop Daniels 
reaching the byline. Not the first time I’ve said something like that. Fonte 
watches on.
 
43 min: You’ll note that the speed – and much of the quality – has dropped 
over the last 10 or 15 minutes. Neither side looks particularly like being 
carved open anymore.
 
42 min: Bertrand just about reaches a ball down the line but can’t wrap his 
foot around the cross and his acceleration leads him to vault the advertising 
hoardings, which causes a chuckle.
 
39 min: Boufal is quite a talent but sums up his half with a wonderful piece 
of skill in the middle before an outside-of-the-boot pass straight to Pugh.
 
37 min: Daniels does well to intercept a through ball intended for Rodriguez 
and sets a counterattack in train, from which Pugh runs up the left and crosses 
for Wilson to head fairly harmlessly at Forster.
 
34 min: Boufal goes down dramatically on the edge of the area under Wilshere’s 
challenge but Clattenburg isn’t having it. Moments later, when play finally 
stops, he books Boufal for what replays show was an egregious dive when he’d 
made room for a shot.
 
33 min: A lengthy, Wilshere-dictated spell of home possession ends with Pugh 
trying to be too clever and ceding it.
 
30 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are 
certainly giving as good as they get now. They’re starting to control the ball 
rather better ... and should take the lead! It’s Bertrand running down the 
left, cutting back wonderfully for Redmond, and he lets the ball run across his 
body before completely miscuing from 12 yards! If he connects properly, which 
he should do, it’s a goal.
 
28 min: Yet another Bournemouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth> corner, won by Wilshere from 
Reed, and they go short again but end up in their own half. Not really the idea.
 
26 min: Arter gives the ball away to Hojbjerg, who has not started the game 
well, and that pattern continues with a ballooned 25-yarder.
 
25 min: Bournemouth are still causing most of the problems. Their movement is 
very sharp .. although, of course, as I write that Boufal nudges Redmond 
through to the byline and his low centre across goal is desperately hacked 
away. I think that was Redmond’s first real involvement.
