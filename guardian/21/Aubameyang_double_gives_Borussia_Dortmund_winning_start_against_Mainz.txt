, got off the mark in the 17th minute when André Schürrle produced a brilliant 
floated cross for the Gabon striker to head inside the far post.

The goal spurred Mainz into a response and the visitors went close, forcing 
Roman Bürki into action, shooting over, then drawing another save from Bürki 
before Dortmund recovered. Christian Clemens missed a good chance to equalize 
after the break, but Aubameyang sealed the result with a penalty in the 89th 
minute after Karim Onisiwo pulled Schürrle back. Yoshinori Muto claimed Mainz’s 
consolation in injury time.

“The result is important, especially because we weren’t in the best form on 
the day,” said the Dortmund manager, Thomas Tuchel, who has seen key players 
such as Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Ilkay Gundogan and Mats Hummels leave to be 
replaced by young talents this summer.
