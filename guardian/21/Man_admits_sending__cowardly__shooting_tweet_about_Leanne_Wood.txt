A man has admitted sending a “cowardly” tweet to the Plaid Cymru leader, 
Leanne Wood <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/leanne-wood>, expressing the 
wish that she should be shot.

 Wood saw the message, posted just two weeks after the shooting of the Labour 
MP Jo Cox, <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/jo-cox-obituary> 
while watching television at home.

 Swansea magistrates court was told that Ross Hookings, 27, tweeted: “Shame 
someone didn’t shoot Leanne Wood though.”

 Hookings, from Port Talbot, south Wales, pleaded guilty to a charge under the 
Malicious Communications Act and was given a12-month community order  
<http://www.westmerciaprobation.org.uk/page.php?Plv=2&P1=12&P2=25>and ordered 
to complete 100 hours of unpaid work.

 According to a probation report, Hookings tweeted the message in response to 
comments Wood made about Port Talbot steelworks during a television debate.

 Defending, Matthew Murphy said Hookings did not intend Wood to see the tweet 
but accepted it was in the public domain.

 District Judge Neale Thomas described the abuse as “cowardly”. He said 
Hookings was not a young man and should have known better.
