Signing off

We thank you for tearing yourselves away from Eurovision 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/live/2015/may/23/eurovision-song-contest-2015-live-blog>
 to watch the boxing with us. Congratulations to James DeGale, remarkably the 
first of Britain’s 17 Olympic gold medalists in boxing to win a world 
championship as a professional.

The secret of his success

“Speed and footwork,” says DeGale when asked which skill he needed most 
against Dirrell. “See when I was coming in and out, throwing punches over the 
top? I’m back now, i’m injury-free. I will take on any super middleweight in 
the world. I’m hard to beat when I’m at my best. I’m telling you, I’m hard to 
beat.”

DeGale: “It’s an unbelievable feeling”

“I’m speechless,” DeGale says. “My whole career, all I’ve been building up to 
is winning a world title. And I’ve finally done it. It’s an unbelievable 
feeling. I’m world champ. I’m world champ! I made history. First [British] 
Olympic gold medalist to be a world champion.”

Waiting on the official cards

Andre Dirrell’s comeback comes up just short in my view as I’ve scored it 
114-112 toJames DeGale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale>, but 
we’re waiting on the official cards.

Round 12

DeGale pounces in and throws a good combination to the body before escaping 
out the back door. Dirrell with an uppercut to the body. Lots of activity from 
DeGale here, while Dirrell looks exhausted. DeGale is finishing very strongly 
here and putting a punctuation on what should be a championship effort. DeGale 
triples up the jab then follows with a big right hook that lands flush. Will be 
interesting to see how the judges score this one.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 10-9 DeGale (Dirrell 112-114 DeGale)

Round 11

DeGale still setting up Dirrell for that overhand right and finally connects 
with it but Dirrell takes it well: it shows DeGale has nothing on his punches 
anymore. Quiet round for Dirrell, who hasn’t connected with much. DeGale 
unloads against Dirrell along the ropes by Dirrell wraps him up. Best round for 
DeGale in a while, but it’s still a close one that could go either way. Three 
more minutes.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 9-10 DeGale (Dirrell 102-105 DeGale)

Round 10

DeGale in retreat now and it could prove costly. He’s looking a bit gassed. 
Dirrell rocks DeGale with a right uppercut that detonates square on the Brit’s 
chin. Dirrell bullies DeGale into a corner and lets his hands go. Only a few 
punches land, but it’s the sort of combination which might not look too 
effective in slow motion but which can really impress the judges. Another round 
to Dirrell, who clearly has the momentum entering the championship rounds.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 10-9 DeGale (Dirrell 93-95 DeGale)

Round 9

It’s not that DeGale looks tired, but he’s being outworked here by Dirrell. 
That’s a dangerous game for a visiting fighter against a homestanding opponent. 
Dirrell connects with a hard counter hook. DeGale comes back with a left to the 
body and an uppercut, but Dirrell winning the round on volume. The fighters 
taunt one another near the end of the round with expletives, even after the 
bell rings. “Fight me!” exhorts Dirrell. “What mother-fucker!”

Round 8

DeGale seems to be coasting a bit here, but Dirrell not as busy as he was in 
the seventh. DeGale circling Dirrell and Dirrell catches him with a stinging 
straight right. DeGale just misses with a massive left hand, but connects with 
a lead hook counter and then an uppercut. With 10 seconds left, Dirrell 
switches to orthodox and tees off against DeGale in the corner, but lands 
nothing of significance. A very close round.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 9-10 DeGale (Dirrell 73-77 DeGale)

Round 7

Deft footwork from DeGale: lateral and in-and-out movement. Dirrell gets 
DeGale up against the ropes and uncoils a six-punch combination upstairs. 
DeGale seems to be setting Dirrell up for the overhand left that dropped him 
twice back in the second, but Dirrell thus far not falling into the trap. More 
combination punching from DeGale against the ropes: he’s really letting his 
hands go. Inspired rebound round from the American, who outworked DeGale 
clearly and effectively.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 10-9 DeGale (Dirrell 64-67 DeGale)

Round 6

DeGale connecting with combinations early and now it’s Dirrell who’s bleeding 
from the nose. Dirrell has seemingly given up on DeGale’s body and all but quit 
throwing punches in combinations. Now Dirrell misses with a right cross and 
DeGale counters beautifully with a well-timed right hand that rocks the 
American. The fighters trading hellacous shots here at the end of the round. A 
close action round that we’ll tip to DeGale, but this is one of several so far 
that could go either way on the official cards.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 9-10 DeGale (Dirrell 54-58 DeGale)

Round 5

The cut by DeGale’s eye has stopped bleeding but the swelling looks bad. 
DeGale controlling the tempo and he’s first off, beating Dirrell to the punch. 
Dirrell trying to keep the fight in the center of the ring while DeGale would 
rather work along the ropes. Dirrell using the jab with so-so success, but 
DeGale very confident now and connecting with power punches upstairs and to the 
body. A good round for DeGale.

Round 2

A sharp overhand right by Dirrell opens a cut over DeGale’s left eye. And it’s 
a bad cut. That could be a difference-maker. Dirrell boxing smartly here and 
DeGale is going to have to do something special to get back into this fight. 
And there it is! DeGale connects with a heat-seeking overhand left that dumps 
Dirrell to the canvas! Wow! A massive shot set up beautifully by DeGale. 
Dirrell makes it to his feel but he’s hurt badly. DeGale connects with another 
overhand left that knocks Dirrell down again! Dirrell saved by the bell. He’d 
only been down once previously in his career ... but floored twice in the last 
minute of that round. What a reversal.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 7-10 DeGale (Dirrell 17-19 DeGale)

Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime why not read Richard Williams’ 
look back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/22/muhammad-ali-phantom-punch-sonny-liston-1965>
 at Muhammad Ali’s rematch win over Sonny Liston, which took place 50 years ago 
yesterday:

If you happened to be a young person in 1965 it was hard to know where to look 
next as the frivolity of sport and song jostled with events profound enough to 
reshape the world. The year had barely begun when Malcolm X was assassinated 
while preparing to address a meeting in New York. The Beatles picked up their 
MBEs and played Shea Stadium. Lyndon Johnson sent the first ground troops to 
Vietnam. PJ Proby’s velvet trousers split on stage in Croydon. The Kray 
brothers were remanded and the Moors murderers charged. Liverpool won the FA 
Cup for the first time and Stanley Matthews played his last match, aged 50.

More? Three Rolling Stones were fined a fiver each for urinating in a petrol 
station forecourt in Essex on the way home from a show. India and Pakistan went 
to war over Kashmir while mods and rockers fought on the beach in Brighton. Jim 
Clark became the first non-American driver to win the Indy 500. David Bailey 
married Catherine Deneuve. Incitement to racial hatred was banned in the UK. 
The model Jean Shrimpton scandalised Australian society by turning up for the 
Melbourne Cup in a dress with a hem three inches above the knee. Bob Dylan went 
electric and the year’s endless parade of hits included Like a Rolling Stone, 
(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction, Stop! In the Name of Love, My Generation, Help, 
In the Midnight Hour, California Girls, I Got You Babe, Mr Tambourine Man, The 
Tracks of My Tears and You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feelin’.

And 50 years ago this Monday, in the midst of that social, political and 
cultural maelstrom, the former Cassius Clay, fighting for the first time as
Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>, took one minute 
and 44 seconds to demolish Sonny Liston’s attempt to recapture his world 
heavyweight title.

Signing off

We thank you for tearing yourselves away from Eurovision 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/live/2015/may/23/eurovision-song-contest-2015-live-blog>
 to watch the boxing with us. Congratulations to James DeGale, remarkably the 
first of Britain’s 17 Olympic gold medalists in boxing to win a world 
championship as a professional.
 
The secret of his success

“Speed and footwork,” says DeGale when asked which skill he needed most 
against Dirrell. “See when I was coming in and out, throwing punches over the 
top? I’m back now, i’m injury-free. I will take on any super middleweight in 
the world. I’m hard to beat when I’m at my best. I’m telling you, I’m hard to 
beat.”

DeGale: “It’s an unbelievable feeling”

“I’m speechless,” DeGale says. “My whole career, all I’ve been building up to 
is winning a world title. And I’ve finally done it. It’s an unbelievable 
feeling. I’m world champ. I’m world champ! I made history. First [British] 
Olympic gold medalist to be a world champion.”

The official scores are 114-112, 117-109 and 114-112, all to the winner by 
unanimous decision: James DeGale!
 
Waiting on the official cards

Andre Dirrell’s comeback comes up just short in my view as I’ve scored it 
114-112 toJames DeGale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale>, but 
we’re waiting on the official cards.
 
DeGale pounces in and throws a good combination to the body before escaping 
out the back door. Dirrell with an uppercut to the body. Lots of activity from 
DeGale here, while Dirrell looks exhausted. DeGale is finishing very strongly 
here and putting a punctuation on what should be a championship effort. DeGale 
triples up the jab then follows with a big right hook that lands flush. Will be 
interesting to see how the judges score this one.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 10-9 DeGale (Dirrell 112-114 DeGale)
 
DeGale still setting up Dirrell for that overhand right and finally connects 
with it but Dirrell takes it well: it shows DeGale has nothing on his punches 
anymore. Quiet round for Dirrell, who hasn’t connected with much. DeGale 
unloads against Dirrell along the ropes by Dirrell wraps him up. Best round for 
DeGale in a while, but it’s still a close one that could go either way. Three 
more minutes.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 9-10 DeGale (Dirrell 102-105 DeGale)
 
DeGale in retreat now and it could prove costly. He’s looking a bit gassed. 
Dirrell rocks DeGale with a right uppercut that detonates square on the Brit’s 
chin. Dirrell bullies DeGale into a corner and lets his hands go. Only a few 
punches land, but it’s the sort of combination which might not look too 
effective in slow motion but which can really impress the judges. Another round 
to Dirrell, who clearly has the momentum entering the championship rounds.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 10-9 DeGale (Dirrell 93-95 DeGale)
 
It’s not that DeGale looks tired, but he’s being outworked here by Dirrell. 
That’s a dangerous game for a visiting fighter against a homestanding opponent. 
Dirrell connects with a hard counter hook. DeGale comes back with a left to the 
body and an uppercut, but Dirrell winning the round on volume. The fighters 
taunt one another near the end of the round with expletives, even after the 
bell rings. “Fight me!” exhorts Dirrell. “What mother-fucker!”

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 10-9 DeGale (Dirrell 83-86 DeGale)
 
DeGale seems to be coasting a bit here, but Dirrell not as busy as he was in 
the seventh. DeGale circling Dirrell and Dirrell catches him with a stinging 
straight right. DeGale just misses with a massive left hand, but connects with 
a lead hook counter and then an uppercut. With 10 seconds left, Dirrell 
switches to orthodox and tees off against DeGale in the corner, but lands 
nothing of significance. A very close round.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 9-10 DeGale (Dirrell 73-77 DeGale)
 
Deft footwork from DeGale: lateral and in-and-out movement. Dirrell gets 
DeGale up against the ropes and uncoils a six-punch combination upstairs. 
DeGale seems to be setting Dirrell up for the overhand left that dropped him 
twice back in the second, but Dirrell thus far not falling into the trap. More 
combination punching from DeGale against the ropes: he’s really letting his 
hands go. Inspired rebound round from the American, who outworked DeGale 
clearly and effectively.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 10-9 DeGale (Dirrell 64-67 DeGale)
 
DeGale connecting with combinations early and now it’s Dirrell who’s bleeding 
from the nose. Dirrell has seemingly given up on DeGale’s body and all but quit 
throwing punches in combinations. Now Dirrell misses with a right cross and 
DeGale counters beautifully with a well-timed right hand that rocks the 
American. The fighters trading hellacous shots here at the end of the round. A 
close action round that we’ll tip to DeGale, but this is one of several so far 
that could go either way on the official cards.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 9-10 DeGale (Dirrell 54-58 DeGale)
 
The cut by DeGale’s eye has stopped bleeding but the swelling looks bad. 
DeGale controlling the tempo and he’s first off, beating Dirrell to the punch. 
Dirrell trying to keep the fight in the center of the ring while DeGale would 
rather work along the ropes. Dirrell using the jab with so-so success, but 
DeGale very confident now and connecting with power punches upstairs and to the 
body. A good round for DeGale.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 9-10 DeGale (Dirrell 45-48 DeGale)
 
Dirrell using distance to keep DeGale at bay. Nice body shot by DeGale. 
Dirrell switches from southpaw to orthodox stance and DeGale pecks away with 
the jab. Dirrell switches back to southpaw. Dirrell finishes the round strong, 
landing the harder and more significant blows. Very tight round we’ll give to 
Dirrell.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 10-9 DeGale (Dirrell 36-38 DeGale)
 
Dirrell boxing nicely behind the jab here. DeGale hunting for the knockout, 
but Dirrell avoid the big left. A hard right hook by DeGale but Dirrell scoring 
with a steady diet of jabs and seeming to set the pace here. Yet DeGale busting 
Dirrell up against the ropes at the end of the round with shots to the head and 
body. Just like the second: Dirrell winning for most of the round but DeGale 
able to steal it late.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 9-10 DeGale (Dirrell 26-29 DeGale)
 
A sharp overhand right by Dirrell opens a cut over DeGale’s left eye. And it’s 
a bad cut. That could be a difference-maker. Dirrell boxing smartly here and 
DeGale is going to have to do something special to get back into this fight. 
And there it is! DeGale connects with a heat-seeking overhand left that dumps 
Dirrell to the canvas! Wow! A massive shot set up beautifully by DeGale. 
Dirrell makes it to his feel but he’s hurt badly. DeGale connects with another 
overhand left that knocks Dirrell down again! Dirrell saved by the bell. He’d 
only been down once previously in his career ... but floored twice in the last 
minute of that round. What a reversal.

Guardian’s unofficial score: Dirrell 7-10 DeGale (Dirrell 17-19 DeGale)

Slow start as Dirrell and DeGale feel each other out. The fighters, both 
southpaws, flicking jabs in the the center of the ring. Dirrell connects with a 
sharp counter left uppercut. DeGale looking to connect with his left hand, but 
Dirrell countering nicely. DeGale looking a bit stiff here. He scores with nice 
left hook late but it’s not enough to take the round.

 at Muhammad Ali’s rematch win over Sonny Liston, which took place 50 years ago 
yesterday:

If you happened to be a young person in 1965 it was hard to know where to look 
next as the frivolity of sport and song jostled with events profound enough to 
reshape the world. The year had barely begun when Malcolm X was assassinated 
while preparing to address a meeting in New York. The Beatles picked up their 
MBEs and played Shea Stadium. Lyndon Johnson sent the first ground troops to 
Vietnam. PJ Proby’s velvet trousers split on stage in Croydon. The Kray 
brothers were remanded and the Moors murderers charged. Liverpool won the FA 
Cup for the first time and Stanley Matthews played his last match, aged 50.

More? Three Rolling Stones were fined a fiver each for urinating in a petrol 
station forecourt in Essex on the way home from a show. India and Pakistan went 
to war over Kashmir while mods and rockers fought on the beach in Brighton. Jim 
Clark became the first non-American driver to win the Indy 500. David Bailey 
married Catherine Deneuve. Incitement to racial hatred was banned in the UK. 
The model Jean Shrimpton scandalised Australian society by turning up for the 
Melbourne Cup in a dress with a hem three inches above the knee. Bob Dylan went 
electric and the year’s endless parade of hits included Like a Rolling Stone, 
(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction, Stop! In the Name of Love, My Generation, Help, 
In the Midnight Hour, California Girls, I Got You Babe, Mr Tambourine Man, The 
Tracks of My Tears and You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feelin’.

And 50 years ago this Monday, in the midst of that social, political and 
cultural maelstrom, the former Cassius Clay, fighting for the first time as
Muhammad Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali>, took one minute 
and 44 seconds to demolish Sonny Liston’s attempt to recapture his world 
heavyweight title.
