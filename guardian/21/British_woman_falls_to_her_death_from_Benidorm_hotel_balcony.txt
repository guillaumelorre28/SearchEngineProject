A British woman has died after falling from the ninth floor balcony of a hotel 
in Benidorm.

Danielle Hall, 21, reportedly from Newcastle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/newcastle>, died after a night out in the 
Spanish Costa Blanca resort.

It is understood she was staying at the three-star Bermudas apartment hotel 
with her boyfriend, Jordan Bevan, 23, and his grandmother.

Local reports said Hall, a supermarket worker, lost her balance and went over 
the balcony railing at about 2am on Sunday after going to answer the door to a 
relative who was also staying at the hotel.

They had only arrived at the hotel for a week-long stay the day before the 
tragedy.

A spokeswoman for the Bermudas hotel said: “We can’t give much more 
information about what happened because we weren’t there when it happened. It 
was about 2am. The police were here, along with firefighters, ambulance crews 
and forensic officers. We’re still coming to terms with what’s happened.”

Spanish police would not confirm the woman’s identity due to privacy laws but 
said the death did not appear to be suspicious.


“She was on holiday in Benidorm with her family and her boyfriend,” said a 
police spokesman. “At about two in the morning, she fell six floors – about 25 
metres – and died.”


He added that police had been in touch with the British consulate.


A police investigation has been launched under the supervision of a judge.

Police said they were not in a position to make an official comment but were 
treating the death as an accident.

A spokesman said: “There is nothing at this stage to indicate any foul play.”

The group is understood to have travelled to the town for its annual festival, 
which started on Friday and finishes on Wednesday.
