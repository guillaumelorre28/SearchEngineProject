Well, that was a fairly satisfactory first game for Zinedine Zidane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/zinedine-zidane>. Real weren’t actually 
quite as dominant as the scoreline suggests, but they were terrific, fluid and 
threatening going forwards, and while they did leave a few holes at the back, 
they just about got away with it that time. It was a marvellously high-energy 
performance, which you could ascribe to Zidane’s arrival or simply just the new 
manager bounce, or even simply him not being Rafa Benitez.

90 mins + 1: Real attack down the right, and suddenly Jese and Ronaldo are 
away. Jese squares to Ronaldo, free in the middle, but the pass is slightly 
behind him and he has to stop and adjust. This means he can’t get his shot 
away, the ball breaks to Benzema who barrels in and belts it home, crashing in 
off the bar.
 Karim Benzema celebrates his goal whilst Ronaldo allows himself a wry smile.

88 mins: Marcelo - who has been terrific going forwards - finds himself on the 
left side of the box again, and he wallops a low cross at the near-post, 
Ronaldo tries to turn it home but hoys it high and wide. Not happening for him 
tonight.

87 mins: More adventures in clearing with Keylor Navas, as an attempted hoof 
away doesn’t even make the sideline. Depor work it into the box, the ball falls 
to Lucas in some space, but he takes too much time and he’s dispossessed.

86 mins: Jese lollipops his way down the right, fires in a cross but it’s 
blocked out for a corner. Kroos booms it to the back stick but it’s headed away 
by Riera, back defending.

82 mins: Another handball in the Real box, this time Varane, but he’d smacked 
that up into his own arm, so no penalty again.

80 mins: The sadness of Ronaldo continues. Modric slides the big dog in on the 
right side of the area, but his low shot skims across goal and wide of the far

78 mins: Luis Alberto finds himself in plenty of space about 25 yards out, he 
thrashes the ball towards goal but it’s about chest-high to Navas’s left, and 
he pushes it away.

76 mins: A rare moment of incompetence in this Real performance: Navas plays a 
goal-kick out to Varane, he passes it back (which, by the way, is against the 
rules in my Monday night fives game), and the keeper simply knocks the ball out 
of play, ostensibly trying to pass it to Marcelo.

73 mins: Carvajal makes a sliding block, the ball jumps up and hits his arm 
but there’s no way that was a penalty. Up the other end, Ronaldo then displays 
he’s a man for all seasons by making a tackle, then the ball breaks to him for 
a shot, but again that’s straight at the keeper.

71 mins: Ronaldo gets the ball in the middle of the goal around 20 yards out, 
but is too crowded out to shoot, and his pass goes well astray. Carvajal is 
back on.

70 mins: Arribas goes into the book for just about the most cynical foul on 
Benzema you’ll see, pulling the Frenchman down when it became obvious that he 
was about to beat him for pace.

in at right-back...and immediately makes a brilliant saving, sliding tackle, as 
Luis Alberto lines up a chance.

65 mins: Things open up for Bale to get his fourth, but this time he gets 
under the shot when there were probably some better options available, and he 
hoofs the thing well over the bar.

63 mins: Simplicity itself. Wonderful, brutal simplicity, as Kroos swings over 
a corner from the right, Bale rises at the near post and the Welshman 
absolutely batters the ball with his forehead into the net. Wonderful header.
 That’s his hat-trick. Photograph: Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images

60 mins: Bale runs down the line, runs out of options so cuts back and plays 
infield to Kroos. Lucas then displays exactly what happens when strikers try to 
defend, and barrels the German over with a profoundly clumsy barge.

59 mins: Ronaldo chases a ball in that slightly odd staccato running style of 
his, that always makes it look like he’s not quite running as fast as he 
actually is. He keeps the ball in play, but runs out himself and can’t make 
anything of the chance.

56 mins: Boof. Marcelo takes a ball to the face from rather close range, and 
it looks startled, like a man who has just noticed it’s unexpectedly raining, 
but he carries on. Now play is stopped after Carvajal goes down holding his 
foot.

54 mins: Depor haven’t got going so far in this half. A low cross from Fajr 
doesn’t make it that far past the near post, and it’s cleared.

51 mins: It’s quite amusing, and probably quite instructive, to see how 
awfully, awfully cross Ronaldo looks when he hasn’t scored. He shoots, it’s 
straight at Lux, and he sulks as if the whole world is against him. Not that 
any of this is necessarily a bad thing, of course.

49 mins: Excellent work by Ronaldo, popping up on the right, and he cuts it 
back to Bale on the edge of the penalty area, he opens his body and caresses 
the ball with some power into the bottom corner of the net.

The players are out for the second half, and looks like there are some changes 
- Raphael Varane is on for Sergio Ramos, while for Depor Jonas Gutierrez is 
also on, replacing Federico Cartabia.

“Despite having Catalonian sympathies when it comes to Spanish football,” 
writes Justin Kavanagh, “I’ve always had a huge soft spot for the very loveable
Zinedine Zidane <https://www.theguardian.com/football/zinedine-zidane>. Who 
could not love a man who decides that an Italian defender with a potty mouth 
like that deserves what’s coming to him, whether in the playground or in 
extra-time in a World Cup Final. But I’m worried about what this new job could 
do to his health, as he was always a man for a crafty fag before games, and the 
odd puke on the pitch in moments of high stress. I hope we are not looking at 
the next Cesar Menotti here? Will Real Madrid now have to employ a post-match 
dugout sweeper to clear away a mountain of ciggie butts?”

Well that was rather good fun. There have been some terrific spells of play 
from Real, some buccaneering attacking play and plenty of chances created, but 
equally they’re allowing Depor plenty of space at the other end. It’s all 
terrific entertainment if nothing else, but Real are perhaps a tad fortunate 
that they haven’t conceded so far.

45 mins: Depor have a corner on the left, it’s fizzed over but nobody can get 
a touch on it, with Arribas claiming he was being held by Pepe. Which, 
admittedly, doesn’t seem like the most shocking possibility in the world.

42 mins: Ronaldo, a man who seems to assume no game is complete without him 
scoring, again cuts in from the left and tries a shot, and it’s tricky to work 
out which is more surprising: that the effort sailed comfortably wide, or that 
he apologised to a colleague for shooting rather than passing.

41 mins: And yet Depor are still in this. Luis Alberto finds himself in a bit 
of room, and tries an ambitious effort that floats just over the bar. He 
would’ve had to measure that one absolutely perfectly to score.

Benzema who tries a left-footed first-time volley, but doesn’t get all of it

39 mins: Yeesh, so close! A delightful move from Real creates a crossing 
opportunity for Bale on the right, he puts it into the box with his left foot 
looking for Ronaldo who times his run perfectly, but his header thunks against 
the inside of the post and bounces out.
 Close but no cigar for Ronaldo. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock

37 mins: Another reasonable effort from Lucas, as he creates a bit of space to 
shoot from the edge of the box, but pulls it just wide. Then 30 seconds later a 
neat turn presents another shooting opportunity for Lucas, but he fires that 
one wide of the other post.

finds himself in the area, but he can’t quite bring Ronaldo’s scooped pass

Marcelo, but instead of crossing for Benzema or Bale in the middle, the 
Brazilian tries to cut it back to Ronaldo, and it’s blocked then cleared.

Real Madrid and Gareth Bale give Zinedine Zidane the perfect start
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/09/real-madrid-gareth-bale-zinedine-zidane-deportivo-la-coruna-la-liga-match-report> 
Well, that was a fairly satisfactory first game for Zinedine Zidane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/zinedine-zidane>. Real weren’t actually 
quite as dominant as the scoreline suggests, but they were terrific, fluid and 
threatening going forwards, and while they did leave a few holes at the back, 
they just about got away with it that time. It was a marvellously high-energy 
performance, which you could ascribe to Zidane’s arrival or simply just the new 
manager bounce, or even simply him not being Rafa Benitez.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
90 mins + 1: Real attack down the right, and suddenly Jese and Ronaldo are 
away. Jese squares to Ronaldo, free in the middle, but the pass is slightly 
behind him and he has to stop and adjust. This means he can’t get his shot 
away, the ball breaks to Benzema who barrels in and belts it home, crashing in 
off the bar.

A nice cherry on top, but more Ronaldo woe. 
 
88 mins: Marcelo - who has been terrific going forwards - finds himself on the 
left side of the box again, and he wallops a low cross at the near-post, 
Ronaldo tries to turn it home but hoys it high and wide. Not happening for him 
tonight.
 
87 mins: More adventures in clearing with Keylor Navas, as an attempted hoof 
away doesn’t even make the sideline. Depor work it into the box, the ball falls 
to Lucas in some space, but he takes too much time and he’s dispossessed.
 
86 mins: Jese lollipops his way down the right, fires in a cross but it’s 
blocked out for a corner. Kroos booms it to the back stick but it’s headed away 
by Riera, back defending.
 
85 mins: Real look like they’re trying to set up Ronaldo for a goal now. No 
dice yet, though.
 
82 mins: Another handball in the Real box, this time Varane, but he’d smacked 
that up into his own arm, so no penalty again.
 
80 mins: The sadness of Ronaldo continues. Modric slides the big dog in on the 
right side of the area, but his low shot skims across goal and wide of the far 
post.
 Oh Cristiano. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock  
79 mins: The corner comes over and finds Arribas in the six yard box, but he’s 
off balance and hooks his shot over the bar.
 
78 mins: Luis Alberto finds himself in plenty of space about 25 yards out, he 
thrashes the ball towards goal but it’s about chest-high to Navas’s left, and 
he pushes it away.
 
76 mins: A rare moment of incompetence in this Real performance: Navas plays a 
goal-kick out to Varane, he passes it back (which, by the way, is against the 
rules in my Monday night fives game), and the keeper simply knocks the ball out 
of play, ostensibly trying to pass it to Marcelo.
 
74 mins: Bale gets his curtain call - he’s taken off, and Jese replaces him. 
 
73 mins: Carvajal makes a sliding block, the ball jumps up and hits his arm 
but there’s no way that was a penalty. Up the other end, Ronaldo then displays 
he’s a man for all seasons by making a tackle, then the ball breaks to him for 
a shot, but again that’s straight at the keeper.
 
71 mins: Ronaldo gets the ball in the middle of the goal around 20 yards out, 
but is too crowded out to shoot, and his pass goes well astray. Carvajal is 
back on.
 
70 mins: Arribas goes into the book for just about the most cynical foul on 
Benzema you’ll see, pulling the Frenchman down when it became obvious that he 
was about to beat him for pace.
 
69 mins: Carvajal is currently off the pitch receiving treatment so Bale drops 
in at right-back...and immediately makes a brilliant saving, sliding tackle, as 
Luis Alberto lines up a chance.
 
68 mins: Riera starts by taking out Pepe, which is rather brave. Meanwhile...
Infostrada Sports (@InfostradaLive) 
Gareth Bale becomes the first payer with two La Liga hat-tricks in 2015/16.

 <https://twitter.com/InfostradaLive/status/685927343110623232>  
66 mins: Change for Real - I.S.C.O trots off, James Rodriguez comes on. And a 
double change for Depor, as Luisinho replaces Navarro at left-back, while Fajr 
is off, his place taken by Oriol Riera.
 
65 mins: Things open up for Bale to get his fourth, but this time he gets 
under the shot when there were probably some better options available, and he 
hoofs the thing well over the bar.
 
63 mins: Simplicity itself. Wonderful, brutal simplicity, as Kroos swings over 
a corner from the right, Bale rises at the near post and the Welshman 
absolutely batters the ball with his forehead into the net. Wonderful header.
 That’s his hat-trick. Photograph: Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images  
Hat-trick!
 
61 mins: Another effort from Ronaldo, another miss, this one a left-footed 
half-volley that balloons way over.
 
60 mins: Bale runs down the line, runs out of options so cuts back and plays 
infield to Kroos. Lucas then displays exactly what happens when strikers try to 
defend, and barrels the German over with a profoundly clumsy barge.
 
59 mins: Ronaldo chases a ball in that slightly odd staccato running style of 
his, that always makes it look like he’s not quite running as fast as he 
actually is. He keeps the ball in play, but runs out himself and can’t make 
anything of the chance.
 
56 mins: Boof. Marcelo takes a ball to the face from rather close range, and 
it looks startled, like a man who has just noticed it’s unexpectedly raining, 
but he carries on. Now play is stopped after Carvajal goes down holding his 
foot.
 
54 mins: Depor haven’t got going so far in this half. A low cross from Fajr 
doesn’t make it that far past the near post, and it’s cleared.
 
51 mins: It’s quite amusing, and probably quite instructive, to see how 
awfully, awfully cross Ronaldo looks when he hasn’t scored. He shoots, it’s 
straight at Lux, and he sulks as if the whole world is against him. Not that 
any of this is necessarily a bad thing, of course.
 
49 mins: Excellent work by Ronaldo, popping up on the right, and he cuts it 
back to Bale on the edge of the penalty area, he opens his body and caresses 
the ball with some power into the bottom corner of the net.

Well, that was better. 
 
48 mins: Scrappy start to the second 45. Nobody has managed to keep hold of 
the ball for longer than a handful of passes.
 
46 mins: And we’re away. Can it be as fun as the first half? Hopefully. 
 
The players are out for the second half, and looks like there are some changes 
- Raphael Varane is on for Sergio Ramos, while for Depor Jonas Gutierrez is 
also on, replacing Federico Cartabia.
 
“Despite having Catalonian sympathies when it comes to Spanish football,” 
writes Justin Kavanagh, “I’ve always had a huge soft spot for the very loveable
Zinedine Zidane <https://www.theguardian.com/football/zinedine-zidane>. Who 
could not love a man who decides that an Italian defender with a potty mouth 
like that deserves what’s coming to him, whether in the playground or in 
extra-time in a World Cup Final. But I’m worried about what this new job could 
do to his health, as he was always a man for a crafty fag before games, and the 
odd puke on the pitch in moments of high stress. I hope we are not looking at 
the next Cesar Menotti here? Will Real Madrid now have to employ a post-match 
dugout sweeper to clear away a mountain of ciggie butts?”
 
Well that was rather good fun. There have been some terrific spells of play 
from Real, some buccaneering attacking play and plenty of chances created, but 
equally they’re allowing Depor plenty of space at the other end. It’s all 
terrific entertainment if nothing else, but Real are perhaps a tad fortunate 
that they haven’t conceded so far.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins: Depor have a corner on the left, it’s fizzed over but nobody can get 
a touch on it, with Arribas claiming he was being held by Pepe. Which, 
admittedly, doesn’t seem like the most shocking possibility in the world.
 
44 mins: More space for Depor, as Luis Alberto finds himself in room in the 
right channel, he crosses over to Lucas but it’s just over the forward’s head.
 
42 mins: Ronaldo, a man who seems to assume no game is complete without him 
scoring, again cuts in from the left and tries a shot, and it’s tricky to work 
out which is more surprising: that the effort sailed comfortably wide, or that 
he apologised to a colleague for shooting rather than passing.
 
41 mins: And yet Depor are still in this. Luis Alberto finds himself in a bit 
of room, and tries an ambitious effort that floats just over the bar. He 
would’ve had to measure that one absolutely perfectly to score.
 
40 mins: Another chances, as Bale again crosses from the right, finding 
Benzema who tries a left-footed first-time volley, but doesn’t get all of it 
and Lux makes the save.
 
39 mins: Yeesh, so close! A delightful move from Real creates a crossing 
opportunity for Bale on the right, he puts it into the box with his left foot 
looking for Ronaldo who times his run perfectly, but his header thunks against 
the inside of the post and bounces out.
 Close but no cigar for Ronaldo. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock  
37 mins: Another reasonable effort from Lucas, as he creates a bit of space to 
shoot from the edge of the box, but pulls it just wide. Then 30 seconds later a 
neat turn presents another shooting opportunity for Lucas, but he fires that 
one wide of the other post.
 
36 mins: Marcelo is basically playing as a left winger so far, and again he 
finds himself in the area, but he can’t quite bring Ronaldo’s scooped pass 
under control.
 
34 mins: Excellent stuff from Real, and Benzema takes out Arribas with a fine 
pass that finds Marcelo, but his shot is blocked by Sidnei.
 
33 mins: Meanwhile in Berlin, Guardian Sport’s erstwhile resident David Silva 
lookalike Ian McCourt has been amusing himself in his new surroundings...

32 mins: Neat stuff from Isco to play in Ronaldo, who in turn plays in 
Marcelo, but instead of crossing for Benzema or Bale in the middle, the 
Brazilian tries to cut it back to Ronaldo, and it’s blocked then cleared.
 
29 mins: Depor win a corner on the right, that Lucas goes across to 
take...and, well. If he was aiming for the other corner flag then it was a 
half-decent effort. But if not...
 
27 mins: Luis Alberto this time drifts wide and puts in a cross, but Ramos 
gets there just ahead of Lucas and heads clear.
