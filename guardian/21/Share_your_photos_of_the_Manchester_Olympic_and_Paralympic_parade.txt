If you are one of 150,000 people expected to line the streets between the 
city’s Museum of Science and Industry, where the parade will begin at 4.30pm, 
and Albert Square, we would like to see your photographs and hear your stories.


Perhaps you saw one of your favourite Olympians go past, or even met your 
hero? Have you dressed up for the occasion? Where on the route are you and what 
was the experience like?
