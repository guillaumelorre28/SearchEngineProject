How many MPs could get from their constituencies to the Commons by train as a 
wheelchair user? And what would they do if they could not access the toilet? 
Very few would be willing to go public about the humiliation caused by the 
train company as in Anne Wafula Strike’s case (Paralympian forced to wet 
herself on train without accessible toilet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/02/paralympian-anne-wafula-strike-wet-herself-train-no-accessible-toilet>
, 3 January). Neither of the main political parties treat disability access 
seriously. We need a commitment from Labour to appoint a shadow minister for 
disability. We also need parliament to implement the recommendations made by 
the House of Lords in 2016 when they reviewed the disability provisions of the 
Equality Act 2010. Let’s make 2017 the year we get real progress on access.
