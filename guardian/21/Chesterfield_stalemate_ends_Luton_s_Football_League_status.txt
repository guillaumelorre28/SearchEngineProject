Luton's inevitable relegation from the Football League has finally been 
confirmed after they were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Chesterfield.

The result leaves Luton on 24 points with four games to play, 13 behind 
22-placed Grimbsy who won 2-0 at Notts County. The Hatters always seemed likely 
for the drop after they were deducted 30 points before the start of the season, 
although their response has been admirable, and without that punishment, they 
would lie in 15th.

Grimsby <https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> are not safe from the 
drop however, as the side immediately above Luton, Chester, beat Accrington 
Stanley 1-0 to leave them just one point behind their relegation rivals with 
three games left to play.
