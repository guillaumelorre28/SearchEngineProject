The former Peterborough favourite Grant McCann takes over from Westley for the 
final two matches of the season, against Shrewsbury and Blackpool.

McCann, who quit as a player at the end of last season and has since been on 
the Peterborough coaching staff, may have a chance to stake a claim for the 
position.

The club said the decision on who should succeed Westley will not be rushed.

A statement on their website said: “The club would like to thank Graham for 
his efforts on behalf of the football club.

“Grant McCann will take charge of the remaining two Sky Bet League One 
fixtures. Chairman Darragh MacAnthony will take time to speak to prospective 
candidates for the vacant manager position.”
