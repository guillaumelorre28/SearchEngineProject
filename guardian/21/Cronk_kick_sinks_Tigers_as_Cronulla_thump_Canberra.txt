No one does it better than Cooper Cronk.

With the game on the line, Cronk, as he has done for his club and state so 
many times, booted a clutch field goal to fire Melbourne to a controversial 
19-18 NRL victory overWests Tigers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wests-tigers> at Leichhardt Oval.

Both sides had their chances to win it, with Wests Tigers halves Mitchell 
Moses and Luke Brooks as well as Storm captain Cameron Smith missing shots at 
field goal.

However with time almost up in the first section of extra time, Cronk stepped 
up in the 85th minute to guide his side to their fifth win of the season.

Asked if there was anyone else he’d rather have beside him in those clutch 
moments, Smith said no.

“He just knows how to get himself in the right position there and when to pull 
the trigger to have a shot,” Smith said.

“I thought he was going to wait a tackle too long in that set but he just knew 
what position he wanted to put himself in, he’s very calm in those situations 
and he’s done it on some big stages before.”

Without skipper Aaron Woods, Sauaso Sue and David Nofoaluma, the Tigers were 
up to their neck in the game but couldn’t get over the line.

Jason Taylor bit his tongue in light of the NRL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> sending out an edict last week 
reminding coaches about not criticising match officials however refused to 
acknowledge any excuses.

“We can’t use those excuses, we got to extra-time,” Taylor said.

“We were a chance to kick two field goals. What’s great is we got to 
extra-time. We were behind by six points and we fought to get the scores level.

“We did as well as Melbourne Storm 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/melbourne-storm>, they just kicked a better 
field goal than us.”

After trailing 12-4 at the break, the Storm looked to be sailing to victory on 
the back of dubious tries to debutant Suliasi Vunivlau and Marika Koroibete.

When Vunivlau collected Tigers fullback James Tedesco high and dislodged the 
ball, the Storm ran downfield to score.

Vunivlau crossed for his second of the day in the right corner with Tedesco 
still 50 metres behind play. The Fijian flyer was subsequently put on report, 
leading to questions as to why the play shouldn’t have been called back.

The last pass in Koroibete’s try from Ben Hampton also appeared to be forward.

They were also denied a possible first half penalty try when Chris Lawrence 
was held back chasing a Robbie Farah kick. While Richie Kennar was subsequently 
sin-binned, it is arguable Lawrence was certain to score.

Storm prop Nelson Asofa-Solomona also should have been sin-binned for a second 
half trip on Moses which will see him come under the scrutiny of the match 
review committee.

Meanwhile, Cronulla have emerged as genuine top four contenders just short of 
the quarter-way mark of the NRL season following their 40-16 dismantling of 
Canberra.

On the back of a brilliant Ben Barba double and guided by James Maloney and 
Andrew Fifita, the Sharks looked every bit a premiership threat in tearing 
apart the injury-hit Raiders.


It was their fourth win in a row, taking them to 5-2, with the strong start 
boding well after they limped out of the blocks to be 0-4 last year.


But most importantly, they put on a big score, something they have rarely done 
over seasons 2015-16. While renowned as scrappers and fighters, they showed 
that they were evolving into a slick attacking unit.


“We’ve probably been a team the last couple of years where we can go into a 
dogfight and scrap it out, but to be able to score 40 is pleasing,” coach Shane 
Flanagan said.


“We haven’t done it too often. I hope we can do it more regularly this year.”

The Sharks are now ensconced in the top four in third spot, only behind last 
year’s grand finalists Brisbane and North Queensland.


“I think we’re developing,” Flanagan said. “We’re improving week after week 
but there’s still a lot of improvement in us.”

Overnight, Brisbane five-eighth Anthony Milford turned in a masterclass to 
lead his side to a 53-0 win over Newcastle with winger Corey Oates also bagging 
a hat-trick as they remained top of the table.


North Queensland meanwhile flexed their premiership muscle with a 44-18 
dismantling of South Sydney on Friday which showed they look in good shape to 
be the first back-to-back champions in over 20 years.


The Warriors snuck home 24-20 against Canterbury but were struck a big blow 
when star recruit Roger Tuivasa-Sheck left the field with a possible 
season-ending knee injury.


After failing to score a point in their previous two outings, St George 
Illawarra got back in the winner’s circle as fullback Josh Dugan fired them to 
a 19-14 win over Gold Coast.


Kieran Foran made his return to Brookvale Oval a successful one with 
Parramatta rallying late to beat Manly 22-10 on Thursday night to sit in fourth.
