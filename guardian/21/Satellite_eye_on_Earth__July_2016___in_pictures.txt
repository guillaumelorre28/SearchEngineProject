Clew Bay in County Mayo, Republic of Ireland, contains Ireland’s best example 
of sunken glacial drumlins – low hills formed from glacial sediment deposited 
at the end of the last ice age. The bay is associated with Elizabethan pirate 
queen Grace O’Malley and Dorinish, a private island purchased by John Lennon.

Central Africa appears to be completely ablaze in this satellite image red 
dots representing thousands of fires burning in the area. Most of the fires 
burn in grass or cropland and the location, widespread nature and number of 
fires suggest that they were deliberately set to manage land. Although most 
parts of the world outlaw this type of agriculture due to the fact that the 
smoke from these (or any) fires is a health hazard, the method continues 
because it is the easiest and lowest cost solution to clearing fields for next 
year’s crops.
Melt water on surface of Greenland ice sheet

Every spring or early summer, the surface of the Greenland ice sheet 
transforms from a vast white landscape of snow and ice to one bejeweled with 
blue meltwater streams, rivers and lakes. In 2016, the transition started early 
and fast.

“This year we had some really early season melt events that kickstarted 
things,” said Allen Pope, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center 
(NSIDC). According to anNSIDC blog post 
<http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=81569>, the ice 
sheet saw three extreme spikes in melt by 19 June. As a result, the pace of 
melting so far is ahead of the past three seasons, but behind therecord melt 
year of 2012 <http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=78607>
.

The first image shows the area on 10 June 2014, when melt ponds were not 
nearly as developed as in 2016.

In early May 2016, an algae bloom grew to cover 85 sq km (33 sq miles) of 
Florida’s Lake Okeechobee. The conditions that gave rise to the bloom persisted 
into July, and have been blamed for affecting water quality downstream all the 
way to the Atlantic Ocean.



Algae blooms are a regular phenomenon during the summertime when pollution and 
warm lakewater create an environment favourable for growth. This year the bloom 
grew large early in the season and affected more people than usual, to the 
extent that on 29 June, Florida’s governor declared a state of emergency.

The algae and their toxins can disrupt ecosystems and also pose concerns for 
human health, as ingesting algae-tainted water can cause nausea, vomiting and, 
in extreme cases, liver failure.

The eastern part of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, the world’s largest single 
chunk of tidal halophytic mangrove forest.

This area lies on the Bay of Bengal, the world’s largest bay. A number of 
large rivers – including the Ganges, its tributaries and various other rivers, 
all flow into its waters, forming the Ganges–Brahmaputra delta.

The region of the Sundarbans appears in dark shades of green in this image, 
while the adjacent areas in brighter colours are densely populated and 
dominated by agriculture.

The erosional forces of the sea and wind along the coast continuously mould 
the landscape, together with the huge amounts of silt and other sediments, 
deposited in the countless estuaries, visible in the water.

A massive wildfire on the Kamchatka peninsula in far-eastern Russia has 
consumed nearly 600,000 acres of boreal forest and tundra since late May 2016. 
Fires appear orange in the image and smoke looks light blue. The large, brown 
area is the burn scar. The Siberian Times reported that smoke from the Russian 
wildfire was “producing exceptional sunsets” in the western US and Canada. The 
newspaper attributed the Kamchatka fire and others this spring in eastern 
Russia partially to an unusually warm, dry winter and faster than normal 
snowmelt.

Dense smoke over north-central Russia in mid-July. Many of the fires appeared 
in thetundra-taiga interface 
<http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/tundrataiga/>, where boreal 
forests give way to low-lying vegetation and permafrost.



Red outlines show hot spots, indicating high surface temperatures often caused 
by fire.

The northernmost hotspots are likely peat fires. Peatlands cover between 2-3% 
of the planet’s land surface, but store 25% of the planet’s soil carbon, 
according to a paper inNature Geoscience. Causes of the fires have not yet been 
identified. <http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v8/n1/full/ngeo2325.html#ref1>

Fires in the far north, particularly in peatlands, produce huge quantities of 
carbon dioxide andmethane 
<http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MethaneMatters/>, further fueling 
global warming.

Snow, clouds, and sea ice on and around South Georgia Island, a remote island 
east of the most southerly point in South America. In the winter (July through 
September) snow covers the entire island and, in summer, about 75% of the land 
remains snow-covered. In this image, the clouds have briefly parted to reveal 
the bright white island on a deep blue backdrop of theocean. Banks of clouds 
appear lighter white. In the south-east, a filigree of sea ice covers the water.

Urban expansion in New Delhi, India, 14 March 1991 - 2 March 2016. Between the 
times these two images were taken, the population of India’s capital and its 
suburbs ballooned from 9.4 million to 25 million. It is now second in 
population only to Tokyo, which has 38 million people. The United Nations 
report on world urbanisation projects that Delhi will have 37 million residents 
by 2030.

The island of Tongatapu and the nearby smaller islands are all part of the 
Kingdom of Tonga archipelago in the southern Pacific Ocean. About 70% of 
Tonga’s population live on the main island. The capital, Nukuʻalofa, sits on 
the island’s north coast and along the Fanga’uta lagoon. The lagoon’s mangroves 
provide an important breeding ground for fish and birds. Built on limestone, 
the island has fertile soil of volcanic ash from neighbouring volcanoes, and 
agricultural structures cover most of the island. Crops include root crops such 
as sweet potato and cassava, as well as coconuts, bananas and coffee beans. 
North of the island are many coral reefs.

 Paris at midnight. The pattern of the street grid dominates at night, 
providing a completely different set of visual features from those visible 
during the day. For instance, the winding Seine river is a main visual cue by 
day, but here the thin black line of the river is hard to detect until you 
focus on the strong meanders and the street lights on both banks. The brightest 
boulevard in the dense network of streets is the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, the 
historical axis of the city, as designed in the 17th century. This grand avenue 
joins the site of the former royal Palace of the Tuileries – whose gardens 
appear as a dark rectangle on the river – to the star-like meeting place of 
eleven major boulevards at the Arc de Triomphe.

In summer 2016, flooding of historic proportions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/05/flooding-china-leaves-more-than-100-people-dead-or-missing-yangtze-river-typhoon>
 swamped China, after days of torrential seasonal monsoon rains.

By 5 July <http://floodlist.com/asia/china-floods-yangtze-river-july-2016>, 
flooding and associated mudslides had affected 11 provinces, destroyed 40,000 
homes, ruined more than 1.5m hectares of crops, and killed 128 people.

Another burst of heavy rain arrived from the south-east when cyclone Nepartak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/09/china-braces-as-super-typhoon-nepartak-kills-three-in-taiwan>
 made landfall in Fuijan province in mid-July. The storm destroyed tens of 
thousands of homes and forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate.

These images of the Yangtze river basin were taken on 27 March and 28 July. 
The second image marks one of the first satellite passes in several weeks that 
shows the flooded landscape. Both images use a combination of infrared and 
visible light to increase the contrast between water and land.

Notably, Poyang Lake, Donting Lake, and other wetlands along the Yangtze river 
wereunusually low 
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2016-03/07/c_135163338.htm> in March. 
If water levels had been closer to normal in the spring, the damages from the 
summer flooding likely would have been far more severe. However, the damages 
from China’s 2016 floods have already topped more than $22bn, according to the
International Disasters Database <http://www.emdat.be/>.

Airborne dust off the coast of Chile. It is unusual to see such large dust 
events emerge from the west coast of South America, according to atmospheric 
scientists.

Winds there “are not conducive to developing major dust storms like those that 
we see in north Africa or in Asia,” said Joseph Prospero, an atmospheric 
scientist at the University of Miami.

The local topography hinders the formation of dust storms, as the Andes 
mountains run along South America’s western flank and block winds arising in 
the east.

 The image suggests that the dust source is located between the Andes and the 
Pacific coast.

North-eastern Iran, the second largest country in the Middle East. Most of 
Iran’s territory is classified as arid and semi-arid, about half of which is 
characterised by rangeland, barren land and mountains. Visible in the centre 
and top left of the image are alluvial fans, formed when streams or rivers hit 
plains and spread out. At top left, resembling brush strokes in a painting, 
seasonal accumulation of water and various salt minerals is evident in greys 
and whites. Scattered throughout the image are many agricultural plots, 
distinct in such an arid and mountainous region, which also features various 
rocky formations. At the far right, is the city of Bajestan, with many 
agricultural fields around it. The shades of red indicate how sensitive the 
multispectral instrument on Sentinel-2A is to differences in chlorophyll 
content, providing key information on vegetation health.

The complex patterns around Cape Coral, a master-planned city born in 1957. 
The development is a hub of the Fort Myers metropolitan area – one of the 
youngest cities in the US and home to 680,000 people. Many of the dark lines 
through this development on the Gulf of Mexico are not streets but a vast 
network of constructed canals totalling more than 400 miles. The canal system 
is so extensive that local ecology and tides have been affected. Boat wakes 
(image centre) appear as thin white lines on the wide Caloosahatchee river, 
which separates Cape Coral from Iona. The Caloosahatchee has been extensively 
engineered to assist river traffic. One such channel is the straight line (top 
left) cutting through the small islands, or keys. The 3,400ft (1,000m) long 
Cape Coral Bridge (lower right) was opened in early 1964, just a few years 
after the founding of the city. The bridge significantly reduces travel times 
to the cities of Iona and Fort Myers on the opposite side of the river. Another 
bridge (on the left) leads to Sanibel Island, a popular tourist destination.

Summer usually brings foggy and cloudy conditions to Baffin Island, in the 
remote reaches of Canada’s Nunavut Territory. But a nearly-cloud free day on 5 
July provided an unusually clear view of the region.

Nunavut encompasses most of the Canadian Arctic archipelago, a network of 
high-latitude islands facing the Arctic Ocean. The scene shows a southern part 
of the archipelago. To the east, a bank of clouds hangs offshore of western 
Greenland.

In this image, summer sea ice still clogs the McClintock Channel and Gulf of 
Boothia. In contrast, ice in some of the larger bodies of water (such as Baffin 
Bay) has broken up, revealing the dark surface of the sea.

The waterways toward the left and top of the image are part of the southern 
route of the Northwest Passage that allows ships to pass from the Atlantic to 
the Pacific Ocean. For most of the recorded history of North America, the 
passage has been nearly impassable but the modernisation of ships and global 
warming has made voyages more common. According to news reports, the Nunavut 
Impact Review Board is considering whether to allow a luxury cruise ship to 
navigate from Alaska through the thawing southern passage in August 2016. In 
August 2015, the southern passage opened for several weeks, while the northern 
passage remained clogged. But whether the passage will completely open in 2016 
remains to be seen.
