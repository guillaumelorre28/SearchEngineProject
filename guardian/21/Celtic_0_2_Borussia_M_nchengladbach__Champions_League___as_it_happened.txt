Summary

Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are bottom of Group C, 
then. This was their easiest game on paper, and they were woeful. In a 
fortnight, they will go to Germany for tonight’s reverse fixture almost 
certainly needing a win to nab third place and a Europa League spot. It’s a 
tough ask – with Hazard, Raffael and Christensen all likely to be fit again – 
especially with Barcelona at home, and Manchester City away to come.

Well done to Gladbach. Elvedi looks a real prospect at centre back, just 20 
years of age, and the captain Stindl looked a standout player, not just because 
of his goal. They got their tactics spot on, dominating Celtic in the first 
half with possession and pressing them into mistakes in the second. The players 
link arms and face the 3,000 travelling fans, each of them bouncing in 
celebration.

Kolo Touré:

In that kind of competition, you can’t afford to make those kind of mistakes. 
I have to blame myself. It was a simple action, to put the ball to the side. 
Second goal, the same thing. Maybe I was thinking about the other action. Even 
though I’m 35 years old, I’m still making 16-year-old mistakes.

Fair play to Kolo for facing the cameras. But he was caught out tonight.

post, but his cut back across Celtic’s six-yard box comes to nothing.

87 min: Schulz comes on for Troaré for Gladbach, their first change. Three 
minutes to go, and Yann Sommer remains idle in Gladbach’s goal. I don’t think 
he has had to make a save in this second half.

85 min: This has been some performance from Gladbach. Without their best 
attacking players in Raffael and Hazard, and their best defender in Christenson 
through injury – plus the tactical exclusion of the talented Mahmoud Dahoud – 
they’ve bossed this match. This result means that avoiding defeat in two weeks 
time at home toCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> in the 
reverse fixture will probably mean that they qualify for the Europa League. 
That’s assuming that neither can take anything off Barcelona or Manchester City.

GOAL! Celtic 0-2 Borussia Mönchengladbach (Hahn 77)

Another mistake from Touré. The Ivorian gives the ball away with a sloppy pass 
and as he tries to retrieve it, is caught out of position. Hahn rushes into the 
gaping hole in the middle of Celtic’s defence, composes himself and neatly 
toe-pokes the ball against the underside of the bar and in.
 Hahn scores the second. Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters  And celebrates.

GOAL! Celtic 0-1 Borussia Mönchengladbach (Stindl 57)

Out of nothing, the visitors are ahead. This is a huge goal in the context of 
Group C, and it all stems from a mistake from Kolo Touré, who tries to see the 
ball out for a goal kick. Instead Hahn got round theCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> defender, tackled the ball back 
to Gladbach’s captain Stindl and he whacked a ball hard and low, through 
Gordon’s legs and into the net. Perhaps Gordon could have done better, but it 
came at him quickly and from about eight yards out.

55 min: Not an awful lot of quality in the middle of the pitch from Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>. It’s mainly kick and rush. Their 
biggest threat is perhaps winning the ball high up the pitch and hoping 
Sinclair/Dembele do the rest. Bitton has been particularly poor with possession.

behind the former Manchester City man. A better start fromCeltic

Leigh Griffiths has been doing some eye-catching kick-ups on the pitch at 
half-time. He didn’t let the ball bounce once! And they say the standard of 
football in Scotland isn’t all that. Pah!

And here’s Ewan Murray’s report from Parkhead:

Celtic thwarted as Lars Stindl and André Hahn strike for Mönchengladbach

Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are bottom of Group C, 
then. This was their easiest game on paper, and they were woeful. In a 
fortnight, they will go to Germany for tonight’s reverse fixture almost 
certainly needing a win to nab third place and a Europa League spot. It’s a 
tough ask – with Hazard, Raffael and Christensen all likely to be fit again – 
especially with Barcelona at home, and Manchester City away to come.

Well done to Gladbach. Elvedi looks a real prospect at centre back, just 20 
years of age, and the captain Stindl looked a standout player, not just because 
of his goal. They got their tactics spot on, dominating Celtic in the first 
half with possession and pressing them into mistakes in the second. The players 
link arms and face the 3,000 travelling fans, each of them bouncing in 
celebration.

In that kind of competition, you can’t afford to make those kind of mistakes. 
I have to blame myself. It was a simple action, to put the ball to the side. 
Second goal, the same thing. Maybe I was thinking about the other action. Even 
though I’m 35 years old, I’m still making 16-year-old mistakes.

Fair play to Kolo for facing the cameras. But he was caught out tonight.

Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. See ya!

That is that. If Scott Brown’s looks could kill. They probably can.

90+3 min: Gladbach should add a late winner, with Herrmann lurking at the back 
post, but his cut back across Celtic’s six-yard box comes to nothing.
 
90+2 min: Celtic haven’t had a kick for about three minutes. 
 
90 min: Three minutes added on here. Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> Park is looking increasingly 
empty.

“Twelve goals conceded in three games does not qualification from the CL group 
stage make,” notes Simon McMahon.
 
89 min: Hahn, a Gladbach goalscorer, comes off for Herrmann. 
 
87 min: Schulz comes on for Troaré for Gladbach, their first change. Three 
minutes to go, and Yann Sommer remains idle in Gladbach’s goal. I don’t think 
he has had to make a save in this second half.
 
85 min: This has been some performance from Gladbach. Without their best 
attacking players in Raffael and Hazard, and their best defender in Christenson 
through injury – plus the tactical exclusion of the talented Mahmoud Dahoud – 
they’ve bossed this match. This result means that avoiding defeat in two weeks 
time at home toCeltic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> in the 
reverse fixture will probably mean that they qualify for the Europa League. 
That’s assuming that neither can take anything off Barcelona or Manchester City.
 
83 min: Touré looks to be carrying an injury – he’s hobbling – but he’ll have 
to continue:Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have made all 
three substitutions.
 
81 min: Celtic pour forward, but this looks as though it will be in vain. In 
fact, Gladbach look more likely to score on the counter, as Hahn flashes a shot 
past Gordon’s near post.
Ewan Murray (@mrewanmurray) 
2-0. Again, fully deserved. Too many Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> players miles off it.

79 min: Roberts gets to the byline and dances his way past Wendt but is shut 
down by the covering Vestergaard, who has been a rock tonight.
 
Another mistake from Touré. The Ivorian gives the ball away with a sloppy pass 
and as he tries to retrieve it, is caught out of position. Hahn rushes into the 
gaping hole in the middle of Celtic’s defence, composes himself and neatly 
toe-pokes the ball against the underside of the bar and in.

76 min: Dembele aside, Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> 
don’t have any attacking players anywhere near six foot. So not sure the tactic 
they are currently employing of crossing the ball towards 6ft5in Vestergaard 
and 6ft1in Elvedi.
 
74 min: Gladbach haven’t won an away match in Europe’s elite competition since 
1977. Sixteen minutes to go.
 
72 min: Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> make their final 
change: Roberts on, Forrest off.
 
70 min: Griffiths on, Rogic off. Huge roar from Celtic’s faithful, but that’s 
a strange sub – Rogic has been useful this half.
 
67 min: With that change, Celtic have changed their shape, with Tierney and 
Lustig now acting as wingers. Scott Brown is now playing as a third centre 
half. Gladbach are notoriously dangerous on the counter-attack, but this is a 
good response to going behind fromCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>. Pressure building …
 
65 min: Callum McGregor replaces Nir Bitton in Celtic’s first sub. Rogic, who 
has looked Celtic’s best player since half-time, flashes a deflected shot wide. 
Corner, from which Sviatchenko tries to force a header home, but the ball ends 
up on the top of the net.

63 min: “Out of nothing?” emails Mark R. “Incorrect, Mr. Butler. Out of Kolo! 
Were it not for Kolo Toure stumbling, fumbling, mumbling, and bumbling that 
simple clearance,Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> would 
still be level. That one’s all on Kolo. Think Brendan Rodgers could get Kolo’s 
younger brother on a January transfer and convince him to play on the back 
line?”

Not sure that Celtic have the financial muscle or the weather to tempt Yaya 
north. What’s the birthday cake like up there?
 
61 min: It opens up for Bitton in the middle of the pitch, and with Sinclair 
to the left and Dembele to the right, the Israeli goes for goal from 30 yards 
with his weaker foot. It doesn’t go in.Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> park groans.
 
58 min: Stindl goes clean through once more, and it’s only a magnificent 
sliding tackle from Sviatchenko which preventsCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> falling further behind. Expect 
changes from Rodgers soon.
 
Out of nothing, the visitors are ahead. This is a huge goal in the context of 
Group C, and it all stems from a mistake from Kolo Touré, who tries to see the 
ball out for a goal kick. Instead Hahn got round theCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> defender, tackled the ball back 
to Gladbach’s captain Stindl and he whacked a ball hard and low, through 
Gordon’s legs and into the net. Perhaps Gordon could have done better, but it 
came at him quickly and from about eight yards out.

55 min: Not an awful lot of quality in the middle of the pitch from Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>. It’s mainly kick and rush. Their 
biggest threat is perhaps winning the ball high up the pitch and hoping 
Sinclair/Dembele do the rest. Bitton has been particularly poor with possession.
Ewan Murray (@mrewanmurray) 
Nir Bitton having one of those nights.

53 min: Strobl finds a pocket of space on the edge of Celtic’s area and tries 
to open his body up to curl it in the far corner, but guides his shot wide.
 
51 min: Gladbach have switched to a back three, and I’m not sure why. They 
were utterly dominant in the first half with a back four, andCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are now getting some joy down the 
flanks. Dembele slips in Sinclair, who twists and turns inside Gladbach’s area, 
but in the end can’t find the right cutback to Rogic.

49 min: Lustig gets forward well and swings a cross in for Sinclair, who meets 
it awkwardly on the penalty spot, with the ball glancing wide. A little bit 
behind the former Manchester City man. A better start fromCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic>.
 
47 min: Gladbach fans have let off a flare in the away end. It is, as the kids 
say, lit.

46 min: Apparently Gladbach’s manager André Schubert has got a tactics board 
in his living room. I’m not sure whether he’s married or not.
 
Peeeeeep! We’re underway again.
 
Leigh Griffiths has been doing some eye-catching kick-ups on the pitch at 
half-time. He didn’t let the ball bounce once! And they say the standard of 
football in Scotland isn’t all that. Pah!
 
Whilst you wait for the second half, have a watch of our documentary on the
