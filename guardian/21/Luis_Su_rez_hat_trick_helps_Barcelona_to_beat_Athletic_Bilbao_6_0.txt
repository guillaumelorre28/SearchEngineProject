presented the fifth Fifa Ballon d’Or he won this week to fans before kick-off 
at the Nou Camp, struck from the spot to set Barcelona on their way to a 6-0 
victory against 10-man Bilbao, with La Liga’s top scorer, Luis Suárez, scoring 
a hat-trick.

Bilbao conceded the early penalty when their goalkeeper, Gorka Iraizoz, felled 
Suárez and was shown a straight red card, after which Barça put the Basque club 
to the sword.

The Spanish and European champions, who have a game in hand over their main 
rivals, are two points behind Atlético in second, with Real a further two 
points adrift in third.

Bilbao never looked like troubling Barça once they went a man down and Neymar 
made it 2-0 when he lifted the ball over the substitute keeper, Iago Herrerín.

Suárez struck two minutes into the second half after exchanging passes with 
Neymar and the Brazil forward set up Ivan Rakitic to make it 4-0 in the 62nd 
minute.

Suárez got his second seven minutes later from Arda Turan’s pass and completed 
his treble to move clear at the top of the scoring chart on 18 goals, two more 
than Ronaldo and Benzema.

“The sending off changed things completely and we were able to take advantage 
during the rest of the game,” Suárez, clutching a match ball, told Spanish 
television.

“I’m going to put this in the museum once I get it signed by my team-mates,” 
added the Uruguay striker.
