The Leeds Rhinos <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/leedsrhinos> chief 
executive, Gary Hetherington, has been fined £1,000 by the Rugby Football 
League after being found guilty of improper conduct.

The 57-year-old was charged over his comments about the RFL’s investigation 
into homophobic commentsalleged to have been made by the Leeds full-back, Zak 
Hardaker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/02/zak-hardaker-accused-homophobic-comments-leeds-rhinos>
, during a Super League match against St Helens on 29 August.

Hetherington, a former president of the RFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rfl>, accused the governing body of carrying 
out a witch-hunt against Hardaker and claimed it was using the services of a 
lip reader in an attempt to prove the case.

The RFL dropped the investigation because of insufficient evidence but took 
Hetherington to task over his comments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/23/gary-hetherington-leeds-rfl-improper-conduct>
, arguing they were “prejudicial to the interests of the game”.

An independent operational rules tribunal heard the case nine days ago and 
deferred a decision but on Friday the RFL revealed that the fine it imposed on 
Hetherington “for questioning the motivation and integrity” of the 
investigation had been upheld. Hetherington has 14 days to appeal.
