Cigarette firms may be considering sponsoring snooker tournaments abroad to 
get round the BBC’s new advertising curbs, it emerged yesterday. They could 
pull out of Britain because the restrictions would cut the air time given to 
their brand colours, sources said.

The BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> is tied by the advertising 
rules of the countries in which events are filmed. This weekend’s Mexican Grand 
Prix, for example, will be screened complete with advertisements for 
Marlborough and John Player cigarettes on sponsored cars.


Tobacco firms may switch sponsored snooker tournaments to countries with 
little or no advertising restrictions. Brazil is considered a tempting venue.


The BBC has told snooker’s governing body, the World Professional Billiards and
Snooker <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/snooker> Association (WPBSA), that 
the sponsor’s brand colours must not be reproduced in the playing area; signs 
bearing the sponsor’s name must not be cited behind players’ seats and health 
warnings must be legible - if they are not the BBC retains its right to put a 
warning caption on the screen.


Mr Bill Cotton, BBC’s managing director, has said he is concerned that air 
time is being used to sell cigarettes. This follows aHealth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> Education Council complaint that 
sports sponsorship was giving the tobacco industry the equivalent of 500 
30-second TV advertisements a year.


The curbs will come into force at the £275,000 Rothman’s Grand Prix snooker 
tournament later this month. The firm had just spent £2,000 on building a set 
in its brand colour, Rothman’s blue, when it was told of the new curbs.


Rothman’s three-year sponsorship agreement with the WPBSA runs out next month, 
and renewal is in question. ‘We won’t be taking any decision until we sit down 
in November and judge from market research the effectiveness of sponsorship,’ 
said Mr Roach.
