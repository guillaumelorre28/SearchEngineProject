The former Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany> 
international Marcell Jansen has called time on his career at the age of just 
29 after he was released by Hamburg at the end of last season, justifying his 
decision by admitting: “I can’t just suddenly kiss another badge now.”

Jansen, predominantly a left-back, has 45 Germany caps, enjoying spells at 
Borussia Mönchengladbach and Bayern Munich before joining Hamburg in 2008 and 
helping the club narrowly avoid relegation from theBundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> last season.

He made just 15 appearances in the Bundesliga last season, however, and his 
contract was not renewed. Rather than seek another club, Jansen has opted for a 
career change.

“I thought about it on holiday. There were a lot of good offers but for me 
carrying on is not an option,” Jansen told German newspaper Bild. “I am fit, 
can move on a free transfer, could still earn good money but I prefer to 
renounce the money.

“In the last few years I was very emotionally tied to HSV. I will continue to 
live inHamburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hamburg> and will always 
love this club. Gladbach, of course, as well. But now some new club? No, I 
don’t want to lie or deceive some other club or fans when I am no longer fully 
behind it. I can’t just suddenly kiss another badge now. That wouldn’t be 
right. I am myself too much of a fan for that.”
