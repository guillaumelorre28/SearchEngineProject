The Spaniard was speaking after his side’s 1-0 defeat to his former club away 
at Bayern Munich in a friendly, his first game in charge of the English club.

“Sané is a player of Schalke. Of course we talk to him - Schalke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke> knows we are interested, but at 
this moment we don’t have many possibilities to get him,” Guardiola told 
reporters.

“There is a difference between Manchester City and Schalke and it is quite 
big. I do not know what is going to happen but right now he is with Schalke,” 
he said of the 20-year-old Sané, who was in the Germany squad at Euro 2016.

Schalke’s sporting director, Christian Heidel, has confirmed Sane has asked 
the club for a transfer. Sané scored eight goals for Schalke last season as the 
Bundesliga club finished fifth in the league.

Guardiola spent three seasons coaching Bayern and won the Bundesliga title in 
each season, but missed out on the Champions League trophy. He declined to 
extend his contract at the end of last season and was replaced by Carlo 
Ancelotti.

The two coaches embraced after Wednesday’s match, which was played at a 
leisurely pace, with both sides missing many regulars.

The only goal of the game came from Erdal Özturk in the 76th minute when a 
clearance bounced off the referee and fell kindly to Özturk, whose shot was 
deflected by Gaël Clichy.
