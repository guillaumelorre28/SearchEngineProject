News Corp reported Impey was said to have crashed into at least four parked 
cars in George Street, Norwood just after 7pm on Saturday.

He was understood to have been at a party at teammate Angus Monfriesâ€™ home and 
neighbours reported seeing a distressed Monfries at the accident site where his 
Audi was one of the cars hit.

Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> said a white Commodore was seen 
turning left from Bonney Street before crossing over to the wrong side of the 
road and hitting a parked ute which went into a Toyota sedan.

The Commodore then allegedly continued along George Street before hitting an 
Audi sedan which was pushed into a BMW M3 sports coupe.

No one was in the parked cars and no injuries were reported.

Monfries had declined to talk to reporters on Sunday.

Port chief executive Keith Thomas said he would address media about the matter 
later on Sunday.
