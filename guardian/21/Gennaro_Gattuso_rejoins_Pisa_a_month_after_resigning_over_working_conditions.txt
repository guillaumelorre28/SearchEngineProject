resigning from the post in protest at poor working conditions.

training session on Friday afternoon.

The former Italy and Milan midfielder led Pisa to promotion from the 
third-tier last season after winning a two-leg playoff against Foggia and said 
it was as good as winning the Champions League withMilan

He quit on 1 August, saying there were “problems on a daily basis” and that 
the club lacked passion.

“The minimum conditions to be able to carry forward this work I do with 
passion are lacking,” said Gattuso, in a statement publishedby La Gazzetta 
dello Sport.

 “Difficulty is part of the job and I believe I have shown, particularly during 
last season, that I am not afraid of obstacles.

“But here, the mark has quite clearly been overstepped. There are new problems 
on a daily basis that have just piled up, right from the day the team started 
pre-season training. Now the ambiguity at the heart of the club and with its 
management has clearly gone too far.”

Gattuso’s coaching career has taken in management roles across Europe, 
including Switzerland and Italy. He was sacked after three months at Swiss side 
Sion before joining Palermo, where he was sacked after six games. In 2014, he 
tried his luck with OFI Crete, who were beset by financial problems and, 
according to Gattuso, were “struggling to feed their players”.

He lasted six months during which he gave an expletive-ridden news conference 
in which he banged his fist on the table repeatedly and said he expected his 
players to “play with balls” despite the problems.

In 2015, Gattuso said he would love to return to manage his former club 
Rangers.

 In one incident last season, he slapped a member of his coaching staff while 
as a player, Gattuso was charged with “gross unsporting conduct” afterclashing 
with the Tottenham Hotspur first-team coach Joe Jordan in 2011.
