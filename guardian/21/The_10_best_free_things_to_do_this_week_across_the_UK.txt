Yorkshire Sculpture Park

One of the UK’s pre-eminent open-air galleries, the YSP continues to attract 
brilliant and beguiling names. Currently you can catch the peculiar, cartoonish 
monuments of KAWS, who also enjoyed a recent indoor exhibition in the park’s 
Longside Gallery. Also showing at the moment are the enigmatic works of Swiss 
artist Not Vital, plus Night In The Museum: British conceptual art figurehead 
Ryan Gander’s curated exhibition showcasing a selection of works from the Arts 
Council Collection as it celebrates its 70th birthday.

Starring Gene Kelly, this film inspired by Gershwin’s symphonic poem of the 
same name is worth trading an explosive blockbuster for one night. It’s part of 
Journey Film Club, a non-profit pop-up event held on the first and third 
Tuesday of every month at Birmingham LGBT Centre.

Conceptualism has always been the curate’s egg of the art world, dismissed by 
some for its daftness but lauded by others. This new season from BBC4 looks 
more of a celebration than castigation. Highlights include Vic Reeves 
discussing the delights of dada (Wed, 9pm) and a doc on the controversial “Tate 
Bricks” (Tue, 9pm). It all kicks off on Monday.

In aid of Stand Up To Cancer, TV’s favourite grub-eater leaves a celeb lineup 
of pop star Aston Merrygold, Towie’s Lydia Bright, prankster Dom Joly, 
Embarrassing Bodies’ Dr Dawn Harper, Made In Chelsea’s Ollie Locke and Labour 
selfie queen Karen Danczuk to fend for themselves on a deserted island. Given 
the ordeals suffered by contestants of the regular series, this looks to be a 
more taxing prospect than the usual ’sleb docco fare.

Inspired by Roald Dahl’s fantastical writings, Cardiff is set to become a 
wonderland for this city-wide event celebrating the author’s centenary. For two 
days, the streets of his childhood home town will be filled with weird and 
wonderful surprises, stories and music. Drop your cool exterior for the weekend 
and let your imagination run wild.
