FULL-TIME: ASTON VILLA 2-2 NOTTINGHAM FOREST

What a second half that was. Villa were much more incisive than in the first, 
with Jordan Ayew even better, Kodjia dangerous and pMcCormack improved - with 
Gestede involved too, they were a real problem for the Forest back-four.

As for Forest, in Lansbury they have a real captain. He held them together in 
the early stages and rescued them at the end, though the two minutes produced 
by Pereira will linger longest in the memory.

Forest go tenth, Villa seventeenth.

90+5 min Credit to Villa, they’ve kept at it after conceding each sucker-punch 
goal - and they still are now. But they’re paying for their first half lack of 
wit.

90+2 min If only Forest’s Polish defender could score the winner, we could 
enjoy the headline “Sealed With Perquis”. But instead, Elphick gets booked for 
timewasting, and then Ayew incurs similar wrath for mouth.

90+2 min Villa win a corner down the left and Grealish flights it towards the 
penalty sport, where Kodjia is up again. But well though he leaps, he can’t 
quite find the roof.

RED CARD! OH COME ON! EFF EFF ESS!

Pereira enjoys himself after helping his team score a goal, celebrating with 
people paying to be there, hoping for precisely such a moment. This we cannot 
possibly endure, now we cannot, so the referee is mandated to show him a second 
yellow card.

GOAL! Aston Villa 2-2 Nottingham Forest (Lansbury 88)

This is fantastic! It’s fantastic! Pereira takes the ball off Vellios’ 
lay-back and, still steam-powered from the Cissokho row, explodes past two 
tackles, plays a one-two with Vellios, bundles through a third, and now inside 
the box, is finally unloaded ... whereupon the ball breaks square to Lansbury. 
He drills a rising finish past Bunn with the outside of his right foot!

86 min Cissokho is completely diddled by Osborn, so hacks him down; Pereira 
takes exception on behalf of his pal and so treats us to some glorious afters, 
the two nuzzling brows and receiving a yellow card each.

84 min £11m is a lot of money to pay a relegated club for a Championship 
striker, but Jonathan Kodjia has shown exactly why Roberto di Matteo did 
exactly that. In particular, his movement has been superb, and his presence 
means that defenders can never relax.

Can you keep this level of jinxing up all season please?”


My ability to be wrong is totally unpartisan, I’m afraid.

80 min Even though it will seem like I already have, the contribution of 
Jordan Ayew to this match really cannot be overstated. Even when thing weren’t 
going well, he didn’t hide nor take the easy option, and his confidence in his 
quality has shown to be well founded.

78 min And another chance for Villa! This time, Cissokho crosses, and again, 
Kodjia is up - but he can’t quite direct his header. Nonetheless, he’s played 
well today and no defence could possibly enjoy the physical challenge of 
handling him and Gestede.

77 min Ayew does very well flick the ball into the path of McCormack who taps 
it one side of Lansbury, and he runs around the other is flattened. But the ref 
plays a good advantage and Ayew collects possession, driving forwards and 
finding Grealish before the move breaks down.

GOAL! Aston Villa 2-1 Nottingham Forest (Gestede, 74)

What a goal this is! What a game this suddenly is! Ayew, again, runs at Forest 
- the variety as well as the intensity of his game has been brilliant. This 
time, he goes around the outside, feinting to cross then actually crossing. In 
the middle, Gestede stretches out a go go Gadget leg and takes a heavy touch - 
the chance seems to have gone - but with his back to goal, he bounces and 
contorts into a kind of scissors kick, sending the ball skimming past Stojkovic 
for the second time in three minutes.

GOAL! Aston Villa 1-1 Nottingham Forest (McCormack 72)

Well played and well deserved Jordan Ayew! Again, he throws himself at the 
Forest defence, committing men and poking a ball through to McCormack on the 
left of the box. Mancienne does all he can to get across, but McCormack’s 
cross-shot goes through his legs and Stojkovic has no chance.

66 min “A good keeper would have saved that,” tweets Joe Friel, and he might 
be right. It was a really good hit from Vellios, who got good purchase off a 
short backlift, but Bunn reacted slowly.

63 min Villa win a free-kick on the right and this time, the delivery from 
Lansbury is good, picking out Kodhia in the middle. He’s up well too, heading 
towards the bear post, where Stojkovic, who’s looked solid, scrambles the ball 
away.

WHAT A GOAL! Aston Villa 0-1 Nottingham Forest (Vellios 57)

Gardner misplaces a pass and Perquis intercepts, knocking off a ball to 
Carayol out on the left-wing. He bundles through a challenge then lays inside 
for Osborn, who does very well to work Vellios a pocket of space, 25 yards out. 
So by way of appreciation, he turns and absolutely annihilates a drive that 
swerves away from Bunn, who was perhaps a little late moving his feet.

55 min Ayew ventures deep to prompt, meaning he’s on-hand when the ball comes

nick an apple from Nottingham Forest’s assembled stall,” emails Raymond 
Reardon, “I would propose that even Robin Hood would be unable to steal 
something from the defensive force set around the tricky tree forest.”

50 min De Laet goes down the right and pokes a high cross that McCormack can’t 
quite control. Villa, though, keep u[ the pressure and find Grealish on the

for Gardner, who pastes another shot wide.

Which is to say that Villa have attacked with desire without creating much, 
while Forest have defended as well as they’ve needed to, without finding the 
right passes on the break.

If Villa can get Grealish on the ball, and get more men into the box to help 
Kodjia, they should find a way to score. But if Forest can locate a touch more 
confidence, there’s plenty out there for them too.

45+2 min Lansbury finds time and space 30 yards from goal, lines up a shot, 
and then swipes across it sending the ball spinning wide. Forest have yet to 
muster a shot on target.

44 min Another sortie down the right from Vill and over comes the cross, 
picking out Kodjia at the back post. He heads down well enough but, 
backpeddling, can’t impart the venom to mither Stojkovic.

42 min Ayew demands the ball again, and outside the box, dead centre, runs 
across the face towards the right, trying to get around the outside. It earns 
him a shooting opportunity too, just the kind the gets slices over the bar 
close to the near post.

hours before Derby v Juve European Cup semi (their biggest game in years), 
stopped his car and we got in, he turned up the volume on his 8 track and sang 
to Sinatra. Every other car was going to the ground, he took us home waving at 
the fans. He must have got to the game about an hour before kick off.”

39 min A lovely email on the wonderful Brian Clough, from Dave McMurrugh: 
“When I was a student I was dating a girl from Derby - I stayed at her house so 
any romance was impossible. She suggested that we could babysit for her 
neighbour, as they were off to an awards night. When we got to the house a 
certain Mr Clough opened the door said “Come in, young man,” and led me to the 
fridge which was suitably stocked. “Help yourself, young man”, he ordered and 
off he went off to collect his award. When he came back, realising that we may 
have got frisky, he knocked on his own door. A perfect gent.”

37 min Villa have upped things slightly, though it’s hardly an onslaught. But 
Ayew, who’s been good, gets on the ball 25 yards out and ignores McCormack 
outside him, instead unleashing a heat-seeker of a low shot that’s blocked 
about 0.214cm from his foot.

Lichaj before rolling back for Cissokho; he crosses and picks out Ayew, who 
can’t impart a suitable chunk of brow.

33 min Lovely from Villa, Ayew driving at the centre of the Villa defence, 
drawing men to him, and feeding Kodjia, again pulling right. His cross is a 
jazzer, too, low, hard and finding McCormack at the back post. But, quick 
though he slides, he can only hit the post, both with himself and the ball.

28 min Forest are growing into things now, and Lansbury, who has been 
excellent so far, snatches a break, charging through the centre-circle and 
slotting a pass for Carayol, outside him on the left. Running at Cissokho, he 
tried to get down the outside, but a toe-end was enough to spoil his momentum.

26 min I suppose an alternative way of summarising what we’ve seen so far 
would be to say Forest have “set their stall out” and Villa haven’t really come

Nottingham Forest’s Henri Lansbury grabs dramatic point at Aston Villa
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/aston-villa-nottingham-forest-championship-match-report> 
What a second half that was. Villa were much more incisive than in the first, 
with Jordan Ayew even better, Kodjia dangerous and pMcCormack improved - with 
Gestede involved too, they were a real problem for the Forest back-four.

As for Forest, in Lansbury they have a real captain. He held them together in 
the early stages and rescued them at the end, though the two minutes produced 
by Pereira will linger longest in the memory.

Forest go tenth, Villa seventeenth. 
 
90+5 min Credit to Villa, they’ve kept at it after conceding each sucker-punch 
goal - and they still are now. But they’re paying for their first half lack of 
wit.
 
90+2 min If only Forest’s Polish defender could score the winner, we could 
enjoy the headline “Sealed With Perquis”. But instead, Elphick gets booked for 
timewasting, and then Ayew incurs similar wrath for mouth.
 
90+2 min Villa win a corner down the left and Grealish flights it towards the 
penalty sport, where Kodjia is up again. But well though he leaps, he can’t 
quite find the roof.
 
90 min Phew! There shall be five added minutes. 
 
Pereira enjoys himself after helping his team score a goal, celebrating with 
people paying to be there, hoping for precisely such a moment. This we cannot 
possibly endure, now we cannot, so the referee is mandated to show him a second 
yellow card.

Rickett/PA  
This is fantastic! It’s fantastic! Pereira takes the ball off Vellios’ 
lay-back and, still steam-powered from the Cissokho row, explodes past two 
tackles, plays a one-two with Vellios, bundles through a third, and now inside 
the box, is finally unloaded ... whereupon the ball breaks square to Lansbury. 
He drills a rising finish past Bunn with the outside of his right foot!

86 min Cissokho is completely diddled by Osborn, so hacks him down; Pereira 
takes exception on behalf of his pal and so treats us to some glorious afters, 
the two nuzzling brows and receiving a yellow card each.
 
84 min £11m is a lot of money to pay a relegated club for a Championship 
striker, but Jonathan Kodjia has shown exactly why Roberto di Matteo did 
exactly that. In particular, his movement has been superb, and his presence 
means that defenders can never relax.
 
82 min “Re your comment at 68 minutes, emails Mesnil Man, ‘Forest have rarely 
looked like conceding, despite not having much of the ball.’

Can you keep this level of jinxing up all season please?”


My ability to be wrong is totally unpartisan, I’m afraid.
 
80 min Even though it will seem like I already have, the contribution of 
Jordan Ayew to this match really cannot be overstated. Even when thing weren’t 
going well, he didn’t hide nor take the easy option, and his confidence in his 
quality has shown to be well founded.
 
78 min And another chance for Villa! This time, Cissokho crosses, and again, 
Kodjia is up - but he can’t quite direct his header. Nonetheless, he’s played 
well today and no defence could possibly enjoy the physical challenge of 
handling him and Gestede.
 
77 min Ayew does very well flick the ball into the path of McCormack who taps 
it one side of Lansbury, and he runs around the other is flattened. But the ref 
plays a good advantage and Ayew collects possession, driving forwards and 
finding Grealish before the move breaks down.
 
What a goal this is! What a game this suddenly is! Ayew, again, runs at Forest 
- the variety as well as the intensity of his game has been brilliant. This 
time, he goes around the outside, feinting to cross then actually crossing. In 
the middle, Gestede stretches out a go go Gadget leg and takes a heavy touch - 
the chance seems to have gone - but with his back to goal, he bounces and 
contorts into a kind of scissors kick, sending the ball skimming past Stojkovic 
for the second time in three minutes.

Well played and well deserved Jordan Ayew! Again, he throws himself at the 
Forest defence, committing men and poking a ball through to McCormack on the 
left of the box. Mancienne does all he can to get across, but McCormack’s 
cross-shot goes through his legs and Stojkovic has no chance.

71 min Ayew crosses again, after excellent work from Gestede, but Stojkovic 
scurries across to shovel it away.
 
70 min Vellios drops short to receive possession, takes a heavy touch, and 
chucks a chunky thigh into Grealish as he flows away with the ball. He’s booked.
 
69 min Ayew is still at it - his competitive courage can’t be faulted today - 
and he burrows in from inside-right, toe-ending a low shot that hurries just 
wide.
 
68 min “Re: Raymond Reardon,” retorts Natasha Arthur-Frank, “we have conceded 
6 in 2 home games this season.”

Forest have rarely looked like conceding, despite not having much of the ball.
 
66 min Fox is late on someone - I missed who, I’m afraid - and is booked. 
Also, Gestede has replaced Gardner.
 
66 min “A good keeper would have saved that,” tweets Joe Friel, and he might 
be right. It was a really good hit from Vellios, who got good purchase off a 
short backlift, but Bunn reacted slowly.
 
63 min Villa win a free-kick on the right and this time, the delivery from 
Lansbury is good, picking out Kodhia in the middle. He’s up well too, heading 
towards the bear post, where Stojkovic, who’s looked solid, scrambles the ball 
away.
 
63 min This is not going at all well for Villa - Lam, the sub, is subbed - 
Pereira replaces him.
 
62 min Vellios’s goal minded me slightly of this one.
 
60 min Lam hurts himself in a tackle with Ayew, so there’s a brief pause while 
he shakes it off.
 
59 min Ayew, who’s never stopped looking for the ball taking risks comes 
inside from the right and throws himself into a shot, nailing the bar from 25 
yards. Villa will be starting to wonder.
 
Gardner misplaces a pass and Perquis intercepts, knocking off a ball to 
Carayol out on the left-wing. He bundles through a challenge then lays inside 
for Osborn, who does very well to work Vellios a pocket of space, 25 yards out. 
So by way of appreciation, he turns and absolutely annihilates a drive that 
swerves away from Bunn, who was perhaps a little late moving his feet.
 Vellios celebrates scoring the opener. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images  
55 min Ayew ventures deep to prompt, meaning he’s on-hand when the ball comes 
back from Grealish. He can’t force anything more than a corner, and again, it 
comes to nothing.
 
53 min “Regarding your comment at 26 minutes that Aston Villa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> seem to be unable to even 
nick an apple from Nottingham Forest’s assembled stall,” emails Raymond 
Reardon, “I would propose that even Robin Hood would be unable to steal 
something from the defensive force set around the tricky tree forest.”

I can see that, er, perhaps. 
 
50 min De Laet goes down the right and pokes a high cross that McCormack can’t 
quite control. Villa, though, keep u[ the pressure and find Grealish on the 
left touchline. He dances inside in his 1980s shorts and slides a ball across 
for Gardner, who pastes another shot wide.
 
48 min Though you’d not expect many teams to leave Villa Park with a point 
this season, if Forest get three they go fourth. They could really do with 
showing more conviction.
 
46 min McCormack, who struggled in the first half, finds some space 
immediately that the second starts, on the top left corner of the box. He looks 
to ronniewhelan one into the top far corner, but can’t find the necessary draw.
 
46 min Once more unto the Holte, dear friends. 
 
Change for Villa: Gollini is still injured, so Bunn replaces him. 
 
And out come the players, so back come the adverts. 
 
Half-time entertainment: Cammy Lee saves three penalties for Dundee United 
against Dunfermline.
 
Which is to say that Villa have attacked with desire without creating much, 
while Forest have defended as well as they’ve needed to, without finding the 
right passes on the break.

If Villa can get Grealish on the ball, and get more men into the box to help 
Kodjia, they should find a way to score. But if Forest can locate a touch more 
confidence, there’s plenty out there for them too.
 
Well, both teams have done ok. 
 
45+5 min Lansbury has some kind of hot cross bun braided into his head. 
 
45+4 min Forest win a free-kick 40 yards out, right of centre, and the 
centre-halves canter forwards. But Lansbury’s kick helps no one, so they gambol 
back again.
 
45+3 min Carayol is down, clutching his left knee after a block tackle with De 
Laet. He doesn’t look happy.
 
45+2 min Lansbury finds time and space 30 yards from goal, lines up a shot, 
and then swipes across it sending the ball spinning wide. Forest have yet to 
muster a shot on target.
 
45 min Due to the treatment of Cash and Gollini, there shall be five 
additional minutes.
 
44 min Another sortie down the right from Vill and over comes the cross, 
picking out Kodjia at the back post. He heads down well enough but, 
backpeddling, can’t impart the venom to mither Stojkovic.
 
42 min Ayew demands the ball again, and outside the box, dead centre, runs 
across the face towards the right, trying to get around the outside. It earns 
him a shooting opportunity too, just the kind the gets slices over the bar 
close to the near post.
 
41 min And here’s Dave again: “He saw us walking in his neighbourhood about 3 
hours before Derby v Juve European Cup semi (their biggest game in years), 
stopped his car and we got in, he turned up the volume on his 8 track and sang 
to Sinatra. Every other car was going to the ground, he took us home waving at 
the fans. He must have got to the game about an hour before kick off.”
 
39 min A lovely email on the wonderful Brian Clough, from Dave McMurrugh: 
“When I was a student I was dating a girl from Derby - I stayed at her house so 
any romance was impossible. She suggested that we could babysit for her 
neighbour, as they were off to an awards night. When we got to the house a 
certain Mr Clough opened the door said “Come in, young man,” and led me to the 
fridge which was suitably stocked. “Help yourself, young man”, he ordered and 
off he went off to collect his award. When he came back, realising that we may 
have got frisky, he knocked on his own door. A perfect gent.”
 
37 min Villa have upped things slightly, though it’s hardly an onslaught. But 
Ayew, who’s been good, gets on the ball 25 yards out and ignores McCormack 
outside him, instead unleashing a heat-seeker of a low shot that’s blocked 
about 0.214cm from his foot.
 
35 min Kodjia pops up again, this time on the left, and he considers taking on 
Lichaj before rolling back for Cissokho; he crosses and picks out Ayew, who 
can’t impart a suitable chunk of brow.
 
33 min Lovely from Villa, Ayew driving at the centre of the Villa defence, 
drawing men to him, and feeding Kodjia, again pulling right. His cross is a 
jazzer, too, low, hard and finding McCormack at the back post. But, quick 
though he slides, he can only hit the post, both with himself and the ball.
 
32 min: “Didn’t Clough also once send out youth teamer Vance Warner to 
impersonate Franz Carr for a post match interview?” asks Natasha Arthur-Frank.

I do hope so. 
 
30 min Stojkovic is down after hurling himself head-first into a low cross. 
He’ll be reet.
 
28 min Forest are growing into things now, and Lansbury, who has been 
excellent so far, snatches a break, charging through the centre-circle and 
slotting a pass for Carayol, outside him on the left. Running at Cissokho, he 
tried to get down the outside, but a toe-end was enough to spoil his momentum.
 
26 min I suppose an alternative way of summarising what we’ve seen so far 
would be to say Forest have “set their stall out” and Villa haven’t really come 
close to teefing an apple, let alone turning over the tables.
 
24 min Forest win a corner down the left and Lansbury drives it flat and at 
the near post. Mancienne nashes in there too, but Cissokho gets their first, 
just.
 
23 min Apropos of not much going on on the pitch, Brian Clough once said of 
Franz Carr: “The best bloody corner flag hitter in the country, if only that 
was where the net was.”
