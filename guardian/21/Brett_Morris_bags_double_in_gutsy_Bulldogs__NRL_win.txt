The former NSW State of Origin winger could have had four but was twice denied 
by try-saving tackles from Kevin Naiqama either side of halftime.

Morris’ effort was matched by prop Sam Kasiano, who set up two tries in a 
dynamic first stint upon introduction in the middle of the first half.

In front of a crowd of 16,212 at a wet ANZ Stadium, and without State of 
Origin duo Josh Jackson and David Klemmer, the Bulldogs were twice forced to 
come from behind against a gallant Tigers outfit.

The visitors led 14-4 when Kasiano turned the game, twice handling possession 
to put Morris over in the 27th minute before offloading to a runaway Josh 
Reynolds in the ensuing set.

The Tigers, who had key trio Robbie Farah, Aaron Woods and James Tedesco also 
on Origin duty, regained the lead when debutant Jacob Liddle crossed just after 
halftime.

They could have kicked further ahead when Tim Simona broke into the backfield 
a minute later, but fill-in fullback Jordan Rankin spilled an easy catch with 
the tryline begging.

Instead Canterbury fought back again, Morris completing his double in the 60th 
minute before Sam Perrett extended the Bulldogs’ winning streak to four with a 
try on fulltime.

The loss for the Tigers, who had strong performances from Naiqama, Mitchell 
Moses and Tim Grant, leaves them in 11th spot, two points out of the top eight.
