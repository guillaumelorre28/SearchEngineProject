A baby orca separated from its mother and pod for two weeks is slowly dying in 
aNew Zealand <https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand> harbour, despite a 
taskforce being set up to try and save it.

The orca – nicknamed “Bob” by locals – was separated from its pod two weeks 
ago and has been swimming in the waters of Tauranga harbour on the east coast 
of the North Island ever since.

Bob is estimated to be between 10 months and one year old, and is showing 
signs of emaciation and dehydration, according to the Department of 
Conservation (DOC).

Without its mother’s milk Bob has begun to use up its own reserves of blubber 
to survive.

An American orca expert, Jeff Foster, was flown in last week to work with DOC 
and local Maori tribes to try and reunite Bob with his family.

The exact location of Bob has been kept secret to avoid people looking for 
him, and the taskforce has refused to reveal their action plan for the baby 
whale.

“It’s using all of its energy to survive at the moment and we don’t want it to 
have to spend its energy to avoid boats and people who just want to take 
selfies with it,” orca researcher Ingrid Visser told Newstalk ZB.


If the taskforce are unable to reunite Bob with his family – or have him 
adopted by another pod – he will most likely die.

“This group is in agreement that reuniting the lone orca calf with its family 
pod is the key to its long term survival in the wild,” said DOC’s orca incident 
controller, John Lucas, in a statement.


“The difficulty we all face is finding the young orca’s family pod as there 
have been no indications where the calf has come from.”

Local boaties and the Tauranga coastguard have been enlisted to search for 
Bob’s family, and samples of the calf’s DNA are currently being analysed to see 
if he matches any known orca pods in New Zealand waters.

A sample of Bob’s breath (captured through his blow hole), is being tested for 
bacteria, pathogens and fungi that that may be affecting his heath.

“It is very unusual for a young calf to get separated from his family and his 
health is declining,” said Reon Tuanau, a spokesperson for Ngaiterangi tribe.


“As tangata whenua [native people of New Zealand] we have a close connection 
with all creatures of the sea and orca are held in high regard as a threatened 
species and taonga [treasure].”
