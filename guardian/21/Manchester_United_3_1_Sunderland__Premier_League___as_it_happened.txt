Looking at the big picture, this was a decent afternoon for both teams. United 
have remembered and learnt how to win, whileSunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> have remembered and learnt 
how to compete. It would be quite some achievement if they got themselves 
relegated despite a proven goalscorer up front and look to me as though they’ll 
be ok - they’re beginning to resemble a David Moyes team, in the best possible 
way.

“Quite a lot of storylines in the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> today,” says NBC’s anchor, 
which is why we’re all here. Anyway, United have now won four league games in a 
row, but stay 6th in the table, level on points with Spurs, who play on 
Wednesday; Sunderland stay 18th.

90+3 min Ibrahimovic slides a pass through to Mkhitaryan, who looks like he’s 
on skates, and Kone pulls him down; that might be a red card, but Van Aanholt 
was on the scene too, so the yellow that arrives is fair. Ibrahimovic demands 
the free-kick, central and on the edge of the box, drilling through the wall 
but straight at Pickford.

WHAT A GOAL! Manchester United 3-1 Sunderland (Borini, 90)

Denayer, who’s looked lively, rushes across the face of the box from left to 
right and swings over a cross that Rojo heads clear. But Borini is there on the 
edge, controlling with his chest and then, as the ball bounces up, walloping 
with his laces into the far top corner!

87 min Incidentally, Mkhitaryan was offside as the cross came over - a lucky 
chance, as otherwise, he could just have headed it.

OH MY DAYS WHAT A GOAL! Manchester United 3-0 Sunderland (Mkhitaryan, 86)

This is wondrous! Zlatan pulls right and crosses - behind Mkhitaryan, who 
simply scorpion kicks over his head and past Pickford into the corner for not 
just a brilliant goal but a unique one. Remarkably, it turns out that he’s 
quite good at football after all.
 Henrikh Mkhitaryan scorpion kicks Manchester United into a 3-0 lead.

GOAL! Manchester United 2-0 Sunderland (Ibrahimovic, 82)

Pogba does very well, closing down Ndong and Kone as they mess about on 
halfway and robbing them to set up a 2v1, him and Zlatan v Djalobodji. 
Eventually, the pass comes, Zlatan then drawing Pickford - it’s a pretty good 
likeness, too - before waiting until the last second to pass an expert’s finish 
into the far corner.

80 min Defoe barges past Blind, holding him off by holding his shirt before

72 min Again, Anichebe holds the ball up, and wins a corner - United won’t 
want to concede too many of them, or shouldn’t. Larsson takes it, clipping

71 min Anichebe seems to be making more of an effort to get into the box now,

69 min Light warning for United, Defoe burning past Jones and looking to 
bundle through Rojo, who eventually sees him away.

68 min Mkhitaryan has made a difference, and he’s found on the left by Pogba, 
with a clever, arcing, low pass. He can’t quite get his feet right, though, and 
digs out a cross that’s easily headed clear.

65 min For a brilliant finisher, Ibrahimovic isn’t much of a brilliant 
finisher, and there he goes again, played in by Mkhitaryan at inside-right. But 
his low shot, aimed towards the far corner, is kicked away superbly by Pickford 
- who shouldn’t really have smelt it.

64 min Pogba finagles his way along the right by-line and jabs a low cross 
that Pickford does brilliantly to poke away from Mkhitaryan, before Denayer 
intercedes ahead of Mata.

63 min Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> are 
growing in confidence as they did through the first half, but when an attack 
breaks down, United spring forward, Mata lifting a crossfield pass for 
Mkhitaryan, who comes inside and curls a low shot just wide of the far post.

60 min United have slowed down a little, and the fear hasn’t even set in yet. 
Mourinho spots it, and readies Mkhitaryan - presumably he’ll replace Mata, who 
has yet to complete a game this season.

59 min Lingard and Denayer swap sentiments and then Lingard breaks with 
Ibrahimovic to his right and an unmarked Mata to his left; he picks the former,

in to clear.

crunching a ballboy. It’s pretty hilarious, I don’t mind telling you.

55 min David Moyes needs to change this, because if he doesn’t, Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> will concede again. Perhaps 
he can go three at the back, keeping five in midfield and going with two up 
front.

52 min Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> have 
barely had a kick this half, and United almost score again when Mata takes a 
ball from Valencia, slipping outside his man before sliding forward to 
Ibrahimovic - who slashes a shot over the bar.

47 min United create another shooting opportunity, Pogba sending it wide, and 
then another, Ibrahimovic pulling right and taking a man out of the middle 
before squaring for the aforementioned Pogba. Done right, he’s in, but the pass 
is just behind, forcing a check, and the opportunity disappears.

46 min Immediately, United attack, Pogba lasering a low pass for Valencia, who 
crosses towards the near post. And Zlatan is there, but can’t quite decide 
whether to attempt a shot or hold it up, so does neither.

right in this.

45+3 min Mata runs past Denayer - that should incur the defender an immediate 
fine - and then collapses when someone different catches his heels from behind. 
Free-kick, right of centre and just outside the box, which Mata takes himself, 
curling a low effort towards the far post that Pickford dives to push away.

45+2 min Oh this is very nice, Valencia moving into Zlatan who pokes into the 
box for Pogba; back to goal, he flicks up for himself and flips into a scissors 
kick that’s flies just over the top.

45 min Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> have 
played well but could use half-time here - United are beginning to flow, 
relatively speaking at least.

43 min Blind is so very much better than Darmian, and again he eases down the 
left, swinging in a low cross that Pickford reaches before Ibrahimovic.

42 min United look to have found an extra bit of zip, Valencia battering down 
the wing and snapping back a cross that Ibrahimovic is first to - but only once 
no one else has bothered attacking it. Instead, he seeks Lingard, who’d 
wandered offside.

GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Sunderland (Blind, 39)

This is a very well-taken goal. Rojo charges forward again and this time, for 
reasons known best to himself, opts not to blaze a shot over the bar, instead 
flicking to Ibrahimovic outside him. The ball is then held up and nipped into 
the path of the onrushing Blind who, with very little space in which to 
operate, controls and swipes a low shot into the far corner.

38 min Blind crosses from the left and Djilobodji’s header away is weak, 
dropping for Pogba, who volleys just over.

36 min United are dropping deeper as Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> grow in confidence, which 
gives Pogba plenty of room to charge into when they break. He simply humps the 
ball into space and hurtles after it before finding Zlatan, taking a return, 
and driving a low shot which Pickford parries.

Ibrahimovic, whose rolls for Valencia is undercooked and Van Aanholt easily

chance here. They can actually attack and not worry too much about getting 
countered because United are neither quick nor decisive on the break.

29 min And here come Sunderland! Defoe drops off and clips a lovely ball over 
the top, and when Blind’s header doesn’t clear, Anichebe has a shooting chance 
from just a few yards out. But to take it he needs to swivel, and that makes 
the chance a hard one - he doesn’t get a decent connection, allowing De Gea to 
save before Borini slashes the loose ball miles from anywhere.

27 min But now there is! Pogba, just outside the box and left of centre, nips 
a ball that hits Lingard and drops back into his path. So he unfurls a rasper 
of a curler which flicks off Larsson and clips the far post. His ability to 
shoot from distance is ludicrous.

Manchester United’s Mkhitaryan sets seal on win over Sunderland
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/26/manchester-united-sunderland-premier-league-match-report> 
Looking at the big picture, this was a decent afternoon for both teams. United 
have remembered and learnt how to win, whileSunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> have remembered and learnt 
how to compete. It would be quite some achievement if they got themselves 
relegated despite a proven goalscorer up front and look to me as though they’ll 
be ok - they’re beginning to resemble a David Moyes team, in the best possible 
way.
 
“Quite a lot of storylines in the Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> today,” says NBC’s anchor, 
which is why we’re all here. Anyway, United have now won four league games in a 
row, but stay 6th in the table, level on points with Spurs, who play on 
Wednesday; Sunderland stay 18th.
 
...
 
90+3 min Ibrahimovic slides a pass through to Mkhitaryan, who looks like he’s 
on skates, and Kone pulls him down; that might be a red card, but Van Aanholt 
was on the scene too, so the yellow that arrives is fair. Ibrahimovic demands 
the free-kick, central and on the edge of the box, drilling through the wall 
but straight at Pickford.
 
90+2 min Time elapses. 
 
Denayer, who’s looked lively, rushes across the face of the box from left to 
right and swings over a cross that Rojo heads clear. But Borini is there on the 
edge, controlling with his chest and then, as the ball bounces up, walloping 
with his laces into the far top corner!
 
89 min Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> make 
another change, Love on for Ndong.
 
87 min Incidentally, Mkhitaryan was offside as the cross came over - a lucky 
chance, as otherwise, he could just have headed it.
 
This is wondrous! Zlatan pulls right and crosses - behind Mkhitaryan, who 
simply scorpion kicks over his head and past Pickford into the corner for not 
just a brilliant goal but a unique one. Remarkably, it turns out that he’s 
quite good at football after all.

84 min Herrera is replaced by Fellaini, who gets a little, but still some 
stick from the home crowd.
 
83 min Change for Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland>
, Khaziri replacing Larsson.
 
Pogba does very well, closing down Ndong and Kone as they mess about on 
halfway and robbing them to set up a 2v1, him and Zlatan v Djalobodji. 
Eventually, the pass comes, Zlatan then drawing Pickford - it’s a pretty good 
likeness, too - before waiting until the last second to pass an expert’s finish 
into the far corner.

81 min I’ve seen better games. 
 
80 min Defoe barges past Blind, holding him off by holding his shirt before 
falling over and winning a free-kick. Larsson will take it, 40 yards out and 
right of centre, but his cross is too shallow and Ibrahimovic heads clear.
 
79 min Anichebe is winning everything in the air, however many men jump with 
him, and he knocks another one down, only this time Herrera is on hand to 
snaffle the loose ball.
 
77 min Sunderland have been much better these last ten minutes, limiting 
United’s chances and putting them under pressure, even if they’ve not created 
very much.
 
75 min Incidentally, Chelsea now lead Bournemouth 2-0, while Arsenal are 
drawing 0-0 with West Brom. Everton are 1-0-up at Leicester, West Ham now lead 
Swansea 2-0, and every other match is goalless.
 
74 min And there it is: Martial replaces Mata. 
 
72 min Again, Anichebe holds the ball up, and wins a corner - United won’t 
want to concede too many of them, or shouldn’t. Larsson takes it, clipping 
towards the edge of the box where Anichebe waits, but Rojo nips in to clear.
 
71 min Anichebe seems to be making more of an effort to get into the box now, 
and he’s all over Valencia in nodding down a high ball. Denayer, chasing after 
it, has strayed offside, but that was promising from the visitors.
 
69 min Light warning for United, Defoe burning past Jones and looking to 
bundle through Rojo, who eventually sees him away.
 
68 min Mkhitaryan has made a difference, and he’s found on the left by Pogba, 
with a clever, arcing, low pass. He can’t quite get his feet right, though, and 
digs out a cross that’s easily headed clear.
 
65 min For a brilliant finisher, Ibrahimovic isn’t much of a brilliant 
finisher, and there he goes again, played in by Mkhitaryan at inside-right. But 
his low shot, aimed towards the far corner, is kicked away superbly by Pickford 
- who shouldn’t really have smelt it.

64 min Pogba finagles his way along the right by-line and jabs a low cross 
that Pickford does brilliantly to poke away from Mkhitaryan, before Denayer 
intercedes ahead of Mata.
 
63 min Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> are 
growing in confidence as they did through the first half, but when an attack 
breaks down, United spring forward, Mata lifting a crossfield pass for 
Mkhitaryan, who comes inside and curls a low shot just wide of the far post.

62 min Well, he might yet - it’s Lingard who departs. 
 
60 min United have slowed down a little, and the fear hasn’t even set in yet. 
Mourinho spots it, and readies Mkhitaryan - presumably he’ll replace Mata, who 
has yet to complete a game this season.
 
59 min Lingard and Denayer swap sentiments and then Lingard breaks with 
Ibrahimovic to his right and an unmarked Mata to his left; he picks the former, 
as you might if you were him. But it’s the wrong decision, Djilobodji sliding 
in to clear.

58 min Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> need to 
get Anichebe into the game; this is my favourite Anichebe goal. Kop for that 
segue.
 
57 min Kone and Ibrahimovic find themselves in a tangle with the former 
crunching a ballboy. It’s pretty hilarious, I don’t mind telling you.
 
55 min David Moyes needs to change this, because if he doesn’t, Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> will concede again. Perhaps 
he can go three at the back, keeping five in midfield and going with two up 
front.
 
52 min Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> have 
barely had a kick this half, and United almost score again when Mata takes a 
ball from Valencia, slipping outside his man before sliding forward to 
Ibrahimovic - who slashes a shot over the bar.
 
50 min A second goal looks imminent as first, Lingard plays Herrera in, only 
for his shot to be blocked, the second, Herrera crosses from the right and 
Pogba heads over the bar.
 
49 min It’s faintly ridiculous to even assert it, but Paul Pogba is some 
player. He’s been excellent so far today, as he has in pretty much every game 
for the past six weeks.
 
47 min United create another shooting opportunity, Pogba sending it wide, and 
then another, Ibrahimovic pulling right and taking a man out of the middle 
before squaring for the aforementioned Pogba. Done right, he’s in, but the pass 
is just behind, forcing a check, and the opportunity disappears.
 
46 min Immediately, United attack, Pogba lasering a low pass for Valencia, who 
crosses towards the near post. And Zlatan is there, but can’t quite decide 
whether to attempt a shot or hold it up, so does neither.
 
46 min Shabba! 
 
The players are sneaking out of the tunnel. The second half is almost upon us. 
 
Half-time entertainment:
 
Elsewhere, Chelsea lead Bournemouth 1-0 and West Ham are ahead by the same 
score at Swansea.
 
United have played much worse than against Stoke, Arsenal and Burnley, games 
they drew, but still lead.Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland>, though, look to have 
something about them, and for as long as they can avoid conceding again, are 
right in this.
 
45+3 min Mata runs past Denayer - that should incur the defender an immediate 
fine - and then collapses when someone different catches his heels from behind. 
Free-kick, right of centre and just outside the box, which Mata takes himself, 
curling a low effort towards the far post that Pickford dives to push away.
 
45+2 min Oh this is very nice, Valencia moving into Zlatan who pokes into the 
box for Pogba; back to goal, he flicks up for himself and flips into a scissors 
kick that’s flies just over the top.

45 min There shall be three added minutes. 
 
45 min Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> have 
played well but could use half-time here - United are beginning to flow, 
relatively speaking at least.
 
43 min Blind is so very much better than Darmian, and again he eases down the 
left, swinging in a low cross that Pickford reaches before Ibrahimovic.
 
42 min United look to have found an extra bit of zip, Valencia battering down 
the wing and snapping back a cross that Ibrahimovic is first to - but only once 
no one else has bothered attacking it. Instead, he seeks Lingard, who’d 
wandered offside.
 
This is a very well-taken goal. Rojo charges forward again and this time, for 
reasons known best to himself, opts not to blaze a shot over the bar, instead 
flicking to Ibrahimovic outside him. The ball is then held up and nipped into 
the path of the onrushing Blind who, with very little space in which to 
operate, controls and swipes a low shot into the far corner.

38 min Blind crosses from the left and Djilobodji’s header away is weak, 
dropping for Pogba, who volleys just over.
 
36 min United are dropping deeper as Sunderland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> grow in confidence, which 
gives Pogba plenty of room to charge into when they break. He simply humps the 
ball into space and hurtles after it before finding Zlatan, taking a return, 
and driving a low shot which Pickford parries.
 
33 min Blind stretches down the left and moves the ball inside for 
Ibrahimovic, whose rolls for Valencia is undercooked and Van Aanholt easily 
intercepts.
 
31 min Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland> smell a 
chance here. They can actually attack and not worry too much about getting 
countered because United are neither quick nor decisive on the break.
 
29 min And here come Sunderland! Defoe drops off and clips a lovely ball over 
the top, and when Blind’s header doesn’t clear, Anichebe has a shooting chance 
from just a few yards out. But to take it he needs to swivel, and that makes 
the chance a hard one - he doesn’t get a decent connection, allowing De Gea to 
save before Borini slashes the loose ball miles from anywhere.
 
27 min But now there is! Pogba, just outside the box and left of centre, nips 
a ball that hits Lingard and drops back into his path. So he unfurls a rasper 
of a curler which flicks off Larsson and clips the far post. His ability to 
shoot from distance is ludicrous.
 
25 min There is not a whole lot eventuating at this moment in time, for me.
