These two transfer bans mean nothing for the modern-day galacticos of Madrid, 
do they? On this showing, Madrid are dripping with star quality to last them a 
lifetime as they put pay to Sporting inside 18 minutes. Zidane’s side were 
potent in the final third, where they were so often joined by the marauding 
Dani Carvajal, who excelled at right-back. Ronaldo was brilliant but fortunate, 
too. The Portuguese could have seen red for a nasty kick out at Sporting 
midfielder Cases. Anyway, back to the positives, the hosts were compelling to 
watch and most important of all, remain on the tails of their Madrid 
neighbours, Atlético. Thanks for reading, tweeting and emailing. Bye!

defeat from the last nine matches.

Injury concerns for Zidane? Goalscorers Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema were 
forced off, the latter with what appeared to be an ankle injury after clashing 
with James Rodríguez. Bale was withdrawn at the break, with concerns over a 
calf injury.

Sporting Gijón have won ... the second-half 1-0. The visitors grabbed a 
deserved goal through Isma Lopez, which will act as a consolation after a 
dismal first-half defensive showing. Madrid were allowed too much room to play 
and they duly punished Gijón’s frailties. But Idi, a half-time sub, made a 
difference for the visitors whilst Madrid slowly moved back down through the 
gears.

90+1 min: Marcelo sets up James and really it should have been six. He slid 
the ball across goal after good work from Jese but Sporting do well to clear 
the ball. Varane heads his header from the resulting corner straight at Cuellar.

90 min: Sporting play a great ball in to Sanabria from the left. His eyes must 
have lit up when Menendez swung in his left-foot cross but the striker cannot 
get his long legs on the end of it.

88 min: Madrid are just seeing the game out now. Hala Madrid! sweeps around

Madrid were phenomenal in the first 45 minutes but have lost some of their 
spark in this second period. Jese has injected some life down the right but

some pride from this second-half showing.

GOAAAAL! Real Madrid 5-1 Sporting Gijón (Isma, 62)

Isma Lopes converts after great work from Jony, who in fairness, has impressed

50 min: Substitute Ndi does quite well, driving down the middle, finds Jony on 
the right wing but his reverse ball lacks oomph and fails to find Guerrero.

No James Rodríguez yet for Madrid. Zidane, who doubtless made a wishy-washy, 
easy-peasy half-time team talk, preferring to bring on Jese to replace Bale at 
the break. Now Guerrero, who has seen very little of the ball, is booked for a 
silly foul on Varane.

46 min: Marcelo’s cross beats everybody, including Carvajal at the far post. A 
familiar start to the second period then, with Madrid on the attack.

Here we go then - without Bale! Jese comes on for Bale, who appeared to be 
troubled with a hamstring injury. Surprisingly, Halilovic is also withdrawn at 
the break forSporting Gijón <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sportinggijon>

Zidane scored 28 goals during his glittering Madrid playing career. Now in the 
hot-seat, he’s watched his side bag 10 goals inside one-and-a-half matches. 
This managerial lark is all too easy for the Frenchman.

Half-time: Real Madrid 5-0 Sporting Gijón

Wow! It’s been a sensational performance so far from Madrid. Benzema and 
Ronaldo both helped themselves to a brace a-piece whilst Bale has nabbed one 
too. There is no way back forSporting Gijón 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sportinggijon>, who are on the receiving 
end of Madrid masterclass. The Gijón defence have been made to look like 
statues by a free-flowing Madrid, for which Dani Carvajal has particularly 
impressed. Bale went down injured just before the half-time whistle and it 
remains to be seen if we will see him for the next 45 minutes. Are Madrid 
finished yet?

like he’s coming off. The Wales forward is heading down the tunnel, when 
presumably the doctors and medical staff will give him a quick MOT.

43 min: Sporting Gijón will just want to get half-time now. Marcelo, who is 
captain in the absence of Ramos, surges forward but is eventually stopped in 
his tracks.

41 min: Superb goal, and superb play again from Isco. The winger danced his 
way in to a central position, before picking out Benzema with a lovely deft 
pass, before the striker did the rest.

GOAAAAAL! Real Madrid 5-0 Sporting Gijón (Benzema, 41)

It’s five! Isco flicks a lovely ball in for the France forward, who dinks the 
ball home past Cuellar.

39 min: Madrid can smell another. Bale puts a ball in wide from the right 
flank but his cross evades everyone before finding Isco in a harmless area by 
the corner flag.

38 min: Varane makes a tackle on Halilovic inside the box. The midfielder is 
hauled down and the France defender appears to get very little of the ball. A 
let-off for Real, who are soon back on the attack.

36 min: Should be five-nil! Ronaldo is through but he’s denied his hat-trick, 
as Cuellar does well to sweep the ball away before Mere blocks his rebound on 
the line. Cristiano is then called offside by the linesman. Panic over.

34 min: Sporting Gijón have gone 15 minutes without conceding! Real have eased 
off a little. Dani Carvajal has been superb for Madrid. Meanwhile, another 
Madrid right-back, Alvaro Arbeloa, is up thanking the home support for a few 
birthday shout-outs. The ex-Liverpool defender is 33 today.

26 min: Madrid have a free-kick in a dangerous area, but they play it back 
towards defence. That’s rather nice of the hosts isn’t it.

24 min: Navas makes a great save from Jony. On the counter, Bale plays in 
Ronaldo, who lays off Benzema who can’t sort out his feet. His effort ends up 
over the Gijón goal. Relief for the visitors ... could have been five!

23 min: Halilovic is busy and trying to do things for Gijón. He spreads a ball 
wide for Menendez but it comes to nothing. Gijón still have possession.

These two transfer bans mean nothing for the modern-day galacticos of Madrid, 
do they? On this showing, Madrid are dripping with star quality to last them a 
lifetime as they put pay to Sporting inside 18 minutes. Zidane’s side were 
potent in the final third, where they were so often joined by the marauding 
Dani Carvajal, who excelled at right-back. Ronaldo was brilliant but fortunate, 
too. The Portuguese could have seen red for a nasty kick out at Sporting 
midfielder Cases. Anyway, back to the positives, the hosts were compelling to 
watch and most important of all, remain on the tails of their Madrid 
neighbours, Atlético. Thanks for reading, tweeting and emailing. Bye!
 
Real Madrid are up to second in the table. Madrid’s monstrous first-half 
showing helped them up to second, one point ahead of Barcelona who host Bilbao 
tonight. Meanwhile, Sporting are unmoved at the bottom ofLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball>, after their eighth 
defeat from the last nine matches.
 
Injury concerns for Zidane? Goalscorers Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema were 
forced off, the latter with what appeared to be an ankle injury after clashing 
with James Rodríguez. Bale was withdrawn at the break, with concerns over a 
calf injury.
 
Sporting Gijón have won ... the second-half 1-0. The visitors grabbed a 
deserved goal through Isma Lopez, which will act as a consolation after a 
dismal first-half defensive showing. Madrid were allowed too much room to play 
and they duly punished Gijón’s frailties. But Idi, a half-time sub, made a 
difference for the visitors whilst Madrid slowly moved back down through the 
gears.
 
It’s all over here at the Bernabéu! 
 
90+1 min: Marcelo sets up James and really it should have been six. He slid 
the ball across goal after good work from Jese but Sporting do well to clear 
the ball. Varane heads his header from the resulting corner straight at Cuellar.
 
90 min: Sporting play a great ball in to Sanabria from the left. His eyes must 
have lit up when Menendez swung in his left-foot cross but the striker cannot 
get his long legs on the end of it.
 
88 min: Madrid are just seeing the game out now. Hala Madrid! sweeps around 
the Bernabéu and it’s almost job done. OK, yes, it was job done after 20 
minutes but nevertheless.

Madrid were phenomenal in the first 45 minutes but have lost some of their 
spark in this second period. Jese has injected some life down the right but
Sporting Gijón <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sportinggijon> can take 
some pride from this second-half showing.
 
84 min: Real go straight up the other end with Jese. His pace sees him get to 
the byline but his low cross can’t pick out Ronaldo or James.
 
83 min: Sporting Gijón <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sportinggijon> 
have a corner, after Marcelo intercepts a cross from the right. Sub Rachid 
takes the corner but it’s comfortably cleared.
 
81 min: Real sub James then tries to pick out Ronaldo at the back post, but 
that’s gobbled up easily by Cuellar.
 
80 min: Dani Ndi is found on the right but he’s tackled by Marcelo. Sporting 
Gijón <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sportinggijon> have a throw but opt 
to go back, as opposed to forwards. They play themselves into trouble, before 
eventually moving towards the halfway line again.
 
77 min: Real attempt to penetrate again through Carvajal down the right but 
his through ball is cut out. He then drives forward again but his threaded ball 
is sliced away from the feet of Ronaldo.
 
75 min: Kroos, Kovacic and Carvajal enjoy some tiki-taka as such on the right. 
The ball switches to the left, where Ronaldo is lurking. The Portuguese 
unleashes a fierce effort at goal but Cuellar saves.
 
73 min: Sporting Gijón <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sportinggijon> 
change as Guerrero makes way for Sanabria. Visitors have just had a header 
straight at Keylor Navas. They are doing themselves justice this second-half 
and have not fallen to pieces, as many would have predicted (myself included).
 
70 min: Injuries to Bale and Benzema appear to have dampened Madrid’s stride. 
Ronaldo is now huffing and puffing after being fouled just outside the box.
 
69 min: Menendez crosses for goalscorer Isma, a left-back by trade, who is 
enjoying himself in an unfamiliar position out on the right wing.
 
67 min: Kroos is penalised for a trip on Ndi, who has certainly made a 
difference since coming on at the break. The Cameroonian is remarkably powerful 
and strong for somebody aged just 20.
 
67 min: Benzema walks around the pitch, behind the Sporting Gijón 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sportinggijon> goal, before heading down 
the tunnel, after a quick word with Zidane. ‘Ca va?’ asks the Madrid head coach.
 
64 min: Mateo Kovacic replaces Benzema, who is up walking but he does not look 
too comfortable. A couple of injury worries now for Zidane, who has already 
seen Bale go off injured at the break.
 
63 min: Benzema goes down and looks in pain. It looked considerably more 
serious than the injury to Bale, who went off at the break. But the Frenchman 
is up on his feet, just.
 
Isma Lopes converts after great work from Jony, who in fairness, has impressed 
for the visitors. Not quite game on, but a consolation at least for Gijón.
 
61 min: Rodríguez almost makes an immediate impact but he cannot send Jese’s 
neat pull back goalwards.
 
60 min: James Rodríguez replaces Isco. It’s a like for like change, and the 
Colombian will sit just behind Benzema in the Madrid attack.
 
59 min: Ndi makes another surging run into the Madrid half. He sprays it wide 
to Jony, on the left, who lets fly at goal. His effort fails to trouble Navas.
 
57 min: Isma Lopes’ mistake lets Jese run free down the right flank but he is 
unable to release Benzema. Modric has just picked up a booking for a late 
challenge on Cases.
 
54 min: Benzema finds Ronaldo, who is in search of his hat-trick, with a neat 
through ball, but he screws his effort into the side netting. He should have 
done better.
 
52 min: Ronaldo has just had a little petulant kick out at Cases on the 
halfway line. Ronaldo a lucky boy. That should have been a red card ...
 
50 min: Substitute Ndi does quite well, driving down the middle, finds Jony on 
the right wing but his reverse ball lacks oomph and fails to find Guerrero.
 
No James Rodríguez yet for Madrid. Zidane, who doubtless made a wishy-washy, 
easy-peasy half-time team talk, preferring to bring on Jese to replace Bale at 
the break. Now Guerrero, who has seen very little of the ball, is booked for a 
silly foul on Varane.
 
46 min: Marcelo’s cross beats everybody, including Carvajal at the far post. A 
familiar start to the second period then, with Madrid on the attack.
 
Here we go then - without Bale! Jese comes on for Bale, who appeared to be 
troubled with a hamstring injury. Surprisingly, Halilovic is also withdrawn at 
the break forSporting Gijón <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sportinggijon>
, who bring on Ndi in his place.

Zidane scored 28 goals during his glittering Madrid playing career. Now in the 
hot-seat, he’s watched his side bag 10 goals inside one-and-a-half matches. 
This managerial lark is all too easy for the Frenchman.

Wow! It’s been a sensational performance so far from Madrid. Benzema and 
Ronaldo both helped themselves to a brace a-piece whilst Bale has nabbed one 
too. There is no way back forSporting Gijón 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sportinggijon>, who are on the receiving 
end of Madrid masterclass. The Gijón defence have been made to look like 
statues by a free-flowing Madrid, for which Dani Carvajal has particularly 
impressed. Bale went down injured just before the half-time whistle and it 
remains to be seen if we will see him for the next 45 minutes. Are Madrid 
finished yet?

45 min: Gareth Bale is down with what looks like a hamstring concern. It looks 
like he’s coming off. The Wales forward is heading down the tunnel, when 
presumably the doctors and medical staff will give him a quick MOT.

43 min: Sporting Gijón will just want to get half-time now. Marcelo, who is 
captain in the absence of Ramos, surges forward but is eventually stopped in 
his tracks.
 
41 min: Superb goal, and superb play again from Isco. The winger danced his 
way in to a central position, before picking out Benzema with a lovely deft 
pass, before the striker did the rest.
 
It’s five! Isco flicks a lovely ball in for the France forward, who dinks the 
ball home past Cuellar.
 
39 min: Madrid can smell another. Bale puts a ball in wide from the right 
flank but his cross evades everyone before finding Isco in a harmless area by 
the corner flag.
 
38 min: Varane makes a tackle on Halilovic inside the box. The midfielder is 
hauled down and the France defender appears to get very little of the ball. A 
let-off for Real, who are soon back on the attack.
 
36 min: Should be five-nil! Ronaldo is through but he’s denied his hat-trick, 
as Cuellar does well to sweep the ball away before Mere blocks his rebound on 
the line. Cristiano is then called offside by the linesman. Panic over.
 
34 min: Sporting Gijón have gone 15 minutes without conceding! Real have eased 
off a little. Dani Carvajal has been superb for Madrid. Meanwhile, another 
Madrid right-back, Alvaro Arbeloa, is up thanking the home support for a few 
birthday shout-outs. The ex-Liverpool defender is 33 today.

Real Madrid celebrate their four goals. They have been sublime so far.
 
29 min: Ah. It wasn’t great. It’s straight into Row Z, or ZZ as it may be at 
the Bernabéu.
 
29 min: Free-kick for Madrid from about 35 yards. Bale is sizing it up ...

26 min: Madrid have a free-kick in a dangerous area, but they play it back 
towards defence. That’s rather nice of the hosts isn’t it.
 
24 min: Navas makes a great save from Jony. On the counter, Bale plays in 
Ronaldo, who lays off Benzema who can’t sort out his feet. His effort ends up 
over the Gijón goal. Relief for the visitors ... could have been five!
 
23 min: Jony drives an effort at Navas who pulls off a decent save. But Real 
immediately go up the other end ...
 
23 min: Halilovic is busy and trying to do things for Gijón. He spreads a ball 
wide for Menendez but it comes to nothing. Gijón still have possession.
