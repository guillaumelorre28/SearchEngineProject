This is one of our new “twisted” wine cocktails, made from spirits derived 
from grapes. Serves one.

25ml limoncello
25ml ginger liqueur (we use Giffard Ginger of the Indies 
<http://www.giffard.com/en/produits/ginger-of-the-indies-3/>)
2 tsp finely grated fresh ginger 
20ml fresh lemon juice 
Champagne, to top
Pickled ginger (pink, ideally), to garnish

Shake the limoncello, ginger liqueur and pulp, and lemon juice over ice, and 
strain into a chilled flute. Top with champagne and garnish with pickled ginger 
petals scrunched up into a flower shape.
