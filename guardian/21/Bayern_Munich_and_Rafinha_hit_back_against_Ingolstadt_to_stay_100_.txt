Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> came from a 
goal down at home to beat Ingolstadt 3-1 on Saturday and make it three wins in 
three Bundesliga matches as they went two points clear at the top.

The champions were far less convincing than in their 5-0 Champions League win 
over Rostov on Tuesday and were caught napping after eight minutes with the 
Paraguayan Dario Lezcano slipping the ball through the legs of Manuel Neuer.

from the edge of the penalty area in the 84th.

“It was a hard game for us,” the Bayern coach, Carlo Ancelotti, said.

the team did today.”
