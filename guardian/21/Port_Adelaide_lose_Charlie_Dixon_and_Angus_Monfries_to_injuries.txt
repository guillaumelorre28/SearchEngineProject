Charlie Dixon and Angus Monfries will miss the next month of the AFL pre-season 
because of injury.

Dixon had surgery on a lingering ankle complaint and Monfries an operation on 
his left shoulder after a training mishap last week. Both players are expected 
return to full training after Christmas.

Port’s high performance manager Darren Burgess said Dixon felt discomfort in 
his left ankle, a problem which caused him to miss time last season.

“Charlie has a history of ankle issues and this is the same ankle that gave 
him problems towards the end of last season, so we thought the most sensible 
thing to do is get it cleaned up now,” Burgess said in statement on Tuesday.

“He’ll be back running in three to four weeks.”

Monfries, who was among former and current Essenson players suspended for the 
2016 season because of the Bombers’ 2012 supplements scandal, was hurt at 
training last week.

“The damage isn’t that bad but like Charlie, we just feel it’s safest to get 
the shoulder right now so there are no issues down the track,” Burgess said.

“He’ll be back running in a few weeks but will stay out of full contact drills 
until after Christmas.”
