Madejski stadium

Magdalen College, Oxford

Magdalene College, Cambridge

magic bullet
easy solution; silver bullet as used to kill a werewolf, and by the Lone 
Ranger.

We should normally stick to magic bullet for metaphorical use, at least when 
talking about a simple or ready solution.

By all means say silver bullet, however, when actually referring to werewolves 
or, metaphorically, if you are talking about getting rid of something. So:
Labour will need magic bullet to win the next election;
Labour will need silver bullet to remove Cameron from No 10

Conservative, so he resolved to spend most of the next five years in the pub”

makeover, makeup
(nouns) one word; (verbs) two words: making up is hard to do

makrut lime
not “kaffir lime”; note that it is makrut and not, as Wikipedia has it, 
makrud. Used in south-east Asian cooking and to flavour drinks

Málaga

Malaysian names
generally the given name comes first, and Muslim Malays tend not to use 
surnames, so Mahathir Mohamad (Mahathir the son of Mohamad) becomes Mahathir on 
second reference. Chinese Malaysian names, like Singaporean names, are in three 
parts: eg Ling Liong Sik (Ling after first mention)

not marshmellow, munchmallow, munchmellow

Martí, José

may or might?
The subtle distinctions between these (and between other so-called modal 
verbs) are gradually disappearing, but they still matter to many of our readers 
and can be useful.

may implies that the possibility remains open: “The Mies van der Rohe tower 
may have changed the face of British architecture for ever” (it has been built);
might suggests that the possibility remains open no longer: “The Mies tower 
might have changed the face of architecture for ever” (if only they had built 
it). Similarly, “they may have played tennis, or they may have gone boating” 
suggests I don’t know what they did; “they might have played tennis if the 
weather had been dry” means they didn’t, because it wasn’t.

Our headline “Capello has stayed aloof but personal touch may have kept Bridge 
onside” says the opposite of what is meant – it suggests that Capello’s 
personal touch means there is still a possibility of Bridge staying onside; it 
should have read “Capello has stayed aloof but personal touch might have kept 
Bridge onside” (but it didn’t).

may also has the meaning of “having permission”, so be careful: does “Megawatt 
Corp may bid for TransElectric Inc” mean that it is considering a bid, or that 
the competition authorities have allowed it to bid?

mayday
distress signal (from the French “m’aidez!”)

May Day
1 May

May, Theresa
with an H; Mother Teresa with no H

mayor of London
or anywhere else: lowercase

MB
megabytes (storage capacity)

Mbps
megabits per second (communication speed); take care to get such terms right: 
we referred to a “2mbps internet connection” which, at two millibits a second, 
is about the speed of smoke signals

McAlpine
note the “Sir” in the building and civil engineering company Sir Robert 
McAlpine (named after the baronet who founded it); not to be confused with 
Alfred McAlpine construction and support services

MCC, the
founded in 1787 as Marylebone Cricket Club

McDonald’s
hamburgers; the possessive is the same word, eg “McDonald’s new vegan-friendly 
image”

McJob
defined by the OED as “an unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects, esp 
one created by the expansion of the service sector”

McLuhan, Marshall
(1911-80) Canadian author who coined the phrase “the medium is the message”

mean or median?
To calculate the mean, commonly known as the average, you add up everyone’s 
wages (for example) and divide them by the number of wage earners. The median 
is the wage earned by the middle person when everyone’s wages are lined up from 
smallest to largest. The median is often a more useful guide than the mean, 
which can be distorted by figures at one extreme or the other

meanwhile
usually means “here’s a slight change of subject”

Meat Loaf
sings

meatloaf
doesn’t sing.

To quote “the Loaf” himself:
“When I see my name spelt with one word, I want to slap and choke people. If 
you do that, you got to be a moron. It’s on every poster, every album and every 
ticket as two words. If you spell it as one, you’re an idiot. Bottom line”

Mecca
holy city in Saudi Arabia; mecca as in “Ashton-under-Lyne is a mecca for 
tripe-eaters”

medals

Fields medal (official name: International Medal for Outstanding Discoveries in 
Mathematics)

Médecins Sans Frontières
international (not French) medical aid charity; no need to translate it

Medellín
Colombia’s second-largest city

media
The media, including social media, are plural, so television might be your 
favourite medium of all the media. A convention of spiritualists, however, 
would be attended by mediums

Medicaid, Medicare
are both US federal health insurance programmes, but Medicare primarily covers 
people over 65 and has no financial requirements for eligibility; Medicaid is 
targeted at those on low incomes

medieval
not mediaeval

Medvedev, Dmitry
(not Dmitri) became president of Russia in 2008, then swapped jobs with 
Vladimir Putin in 2012 and is now prime minister

meet, met
You might meet with triumph and disaster, or meet with a bad end, but “meet” 
should normally suffice if you are just going to meet someone

mega
fine for megabits, megabytes and megawatts, not as an adjective meaning big

memento
plural mementoes

memorandum
plural memorandums, not memoranda

menage
no accent

Menorca
not Minorca

menswear

mental handicap, mentally handicapped, mentally retarded
do not use: say a person with learning disabilities

mental health
Take care using language about mental health issues. In addition to such 
clearly offensive and unacceptable expressions as loony, maniac, nutter, psycho 
and schizo, terms to avoid - because they stereotype and stigmatise - include 
victim of, suffering from, and afflicted by; “a person with” is clear, accurate 
and preferable to “a person suffering from”.

Terms such as schizophrenic and psychotic should be used only in a medical 
context: for example never use schizophrenic to mean “in two minds”.

Avoid writing “the mentally ill” - say mentally ill people, mental health 
patients or people with mental health problems

merchant navy

Derived from the Latin for prostitute, meretricious means flashy but without 
substance; meritorious means worthy of merit

which the soul of those who speak it is enshrined” (Oliver Wendell Holmes)

meteor
a piece of space rock, usually from a comet or asteroid, that enters the 
Earth’s atmosphere; if it hits the ground before it burns up, it is a meteorite

method acting
techniques associated with the Russian Constantin Stanislavski (1865-1938) and 
the American Lee Strasberg (1901-82)

Met Office

metres
should be written out in full, to avoid confusion with million (an obvious 
exception would be athletics, eg she won the 400m)

metric system
We use the metric system for weights and measures; exceptions are the mile and 
the pint. As understanding of the two systems is a matter of generations, 
conversions (in brackets) to imperial units should be provided wherever this 
seems useful, though usually one conversion – the first – will suffice. 
Imperial units in quoted matter should be retained, and converted to metric [in 
square brackets] if it doesn’t ruin the flow of the quote.

It is not necessary to convert moderate distances between metres and yards, 
which are close enough for rough and ready purposes (though it is preferable to 
use metres), or small domestic quantities: two litres of wine, a kilogramme of 
sugar, a couple of pounds of apples, a few inches of string.

Small units should be converted when precision is required: 44mm (1.7in) of 
rain fell in two hours. But be sensible: don’t convert a metric estimate into a 
precise imperial figure (round the conversion up or down). Tons and tonnes are 
close enough for most purposes to do without conversion; use tonnes (except in 
shipping tonnage).

Body weights and heights should always be converted in brackets: metres to 
feet and inches, kilogrammes to stones/pounds. Geographical heights and depths, 
of people, buildings, monuments, etc, should be converted, metres to feet. In 
square measurement, land is given in sq metres, hectares and sq km, with sq 
yards, acres or sq miles in brackets where there is space to provide a 
conversion. The floor areas of buildings are conventionally expressed in sq 
metres (or sq ft). Take great care in conversions of square and cubic measures: 
2 metres is about 6.5 feet, but 2 sq metres is about 21.5 sq feet

Métro
in Paris; Metro is its Tyne and Wear equivalent

Metropolitan police
the Met at second mention; commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Met 
commissioner is acceptable; but note Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA).

The Metropolitan police are plural, like other forces, but the Met is 
singular, so: the Metropolitan police are investigating, but the Met is 
investigating, etc

the same document); calls itself “an independent think tank” but is a rightwing

Muhammad
Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last of God’s prophets, who delivered 
God’s final message. They recognise Moses and Jesus as prophets also.

The above transliteration is our style for the prophet’s name and for most

is known we respect it, eg Mohamed Al Fayed, Mohamed ElBaradei.

The spelling Mohammed (or variants) is considered archaic by most British 
Muslims today

editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have 
written”

museums

Museum (V&A on second reference), Metropolitan Museum of Art, etc

MW
