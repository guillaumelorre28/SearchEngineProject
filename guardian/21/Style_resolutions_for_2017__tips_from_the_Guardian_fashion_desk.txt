I will dress weather appropriately

Full disclosure: my style resolution isn’t exactly bleeding-edge fashion 
stuff. It’s more a way to make my day just that little bit better. I have a 
long history of dressing in a way that mismatches the weather in a spectacular 
way. If winter is about to turn into spring I will invariably be found in wooly 
tights. If it’s raining, there will definitely be some sort of suede pump on my 
feet. And as anyone who has spent any time with me knows, I have an aversion to 
proper winter coats. Not to mention umbrellas. But 2017 is going to be 
different. I will become one of those people who looks at the weather app 
before I get dressed and I have already invested in a coat – well, a jacket, 
anyway – that I actually like wearing and that keeps me warm. Revolutionary, I 
know. Let’s see how long it lasts.Lauren Cochrane

I will stop buying going out clothes

Elle MacPherson once told me that her secret to keeping in shape was that you 
should never eat more than you can fit in your two hands cupped together. This 
has haunted me ever since, because that’s not a meal, Elle! That’s a snack!

Anyway, the point is, I have never been much good at doing anything in 
moderation. Which is why my wardrobes are packed tighter than a pair of size 25 
jeans in January. Specifically, I have approximately 567 party dresses. Which 
is at least one for every actual party I will realistically attend in the next 
decade. Which means that the ones that are out of fashion now will be back on 
trend by the time I get round to them, if I play my cards right.Jess

I will start to dress like a girl

I have spent most of my career as a fashion writer wanging on about 
tracksuits, which is handy because tracksuits have also been in fashion. 
EastEnders’ Nancy, Caitlin Price, Adidas and their various collaborations. So 
next year I have plans to perform a volte-face by dressing more like a girl. A 
girl in the historical, archaically-defined sense of the word, which isn’t as 
unsisterly as it sounds, but rather a reminder that I have legs. Hell has 
always been tight clothing and suggestive hemlines but I have huge plans to try 
short skirts, dresses, tights and entry-level heels. I may even wear 
over-the-knee boots, which I accidentally did for a shoot earlier this year. 
While I’m here, I’m also planning to phase out white trainers and wear in my 
Doctor Martens (this may take a long weekend) and stop carrying such a huge bag 
around in case something unexpected happens. Essentially adopting a YOLO 
approach to my everyday.Morwenna Ferrier

I will wear less black

Black is easy, and the anonymity of it is comforting. It’s easy to collapse 
into an oil- slicked ocean of the colour as I have done in the past but next 
year I hope to change it up a bit. The problem with wearing brighter, primary 
colours has always been the issue of not wanting to look like a children’s TV 
presenter. Next year, though, I’m going to try and wear more warm colours: 
orange, mustard yellows, deep greens and dark blues. But I’m still keeping my 
black jeans on, OK?Priya Elan

I will be more considered in my outfits

I have always adopted a pretty uniform approach to my look. Buy lots of 
similar-ish pairs of trousers in black and navy (slouchy tailored or 
jogging-bottom styles), and pair with lots of similar-ish jumpers and tops in 
black, navy and grey. They all have subtle differences (trust me they do) but 
essentially I’m a pro at being able to get dressed in the dark and 
“miraculously” have everything work together. Well, this year I’m going to get 
outside of my comfort zone a bit and introduce some styles that will require a 
bit more consideration … a few patterns maybe, some brighter colours (screaming 
face emoji) … and, potentially, a silk shirt or two. You definitely can’t just 
throw on a silk shirt.Melanie Wilkinson
