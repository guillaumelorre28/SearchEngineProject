 last week,held talks with the Dons chairman, Pete Winkelman

 but revealed the time was not right to succeed Karl Robinson as the League One 
club’s manager.

Speaking to BT Sport, Gerrard said: “I’m just taking a bit of time to consider 
what’s next, exciting times moving forward.

“I spoke to MK Dons <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mkdons>. I had a 
chat with the chairman, it’s a very exciting job for somebody else but it’s a 
bit soon for me. But it’s true, I did speak to them.”

The 36-year-old could now take up a coaching role at his former club, possibly 
working at the academy.Jürgen Klopp has made no secret of an open invitation 
for Gerrard

, should the club legend want to hang up his boots. Gerrard, however, is still 
to decide whether to continue his playing career.

Klopp had previously said: “Steven Gerrard – and this will be a really big 
surprise – is always so welcome atLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> FC. You cannot imagine how 
welcome so absolutely no problem, but everything we will talk to each other 
about will stay in these talks. That is how I know Stevie and that is how I am. 
Nobody should be worried that we don’t have space for Steven Gerrard. 
Everything will be fine, 100%.”
