Two French tourists have been evicted from Rottnest Island, a popular holiday 
spot 20km off the coast of Perth,Western Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/western-australia>, for allegedly 
attempting to light a quokka on fire.

WA Police spokeswoman Ros Weatherall said the men, aged 18 and 24, allegedly 
lit a stream of aerosol on fire and aimed the jet of flame at a quokka on April 
3.

Weatherall said the animal was allegedly singed during the incident.

It’s understood the quokka was not badly injured and managed to run off. It 
has not received veterinary treatment.

The men have been charged with animal cruelty and bailed to appear in 
Fremantle magistrates court on Friday.

Police allegedly seized video evidence of the incident, but that footage has 
not been released.

Quokkas used to be common on mainland Australia but are now listed as 
vulnerable. The species survived because of the large population on Rottnest 
island – named “Rattennest” by a Dutch explorer who mistook quokkas for large 
rats – and are unafraid of people, regularly wandering up to them in 
campgrounds and begging for food.

In February five quokkas on the island were found dead

 and stuffed upside-down into plastic tree protectors. A sixth was found dead 
nearby.

Weatherall said police were still investigating those killings, and urged 
anyone with information to come forward.
