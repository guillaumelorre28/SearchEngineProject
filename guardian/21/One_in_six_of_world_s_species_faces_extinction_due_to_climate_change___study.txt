One in six of the planet’s species will be lost forever to extinction if world 
leaders fail to take action on climate change, according to a new analysis.

The stark warning on the scale of global warming’s impact on animals and 
plants comes just months before nearly 200 governments meet for UN climate 
talks in Paris in an attempt to forge a global deal on cutting carbon emissions.

Conservationists said such a large loss would be a tragedy with serious 
ramifications for people as well as ecosystems.

Creatures in Australia, New Zealand and South America will be hit much harder 
than North American and Europe, due to a high number of species not found 
anywhere else, such as Australia’swhite lemuroid ringtail possums 
<https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/wildlife/animals-az/lemuroid_ringtail_possum.html>, 
which can die within hours in higher temperatures.

Relatively small land masses in Australia and New Zealand mean that many 
species there will be unable to migrate to cope with rising temperatures, found
the study, published in the journal Science on Thursday 
<http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaa4984>. 

The study is the most comprehensive look yet at the impact of climate change 
on biodiversity loss, analysing 131 existing studies on the subject. The 
stresses on wildlife and their habitats from global warming is in addition to 
pressures such as deforestation, pollution and overfishing thathave already 
seen the world lose half its animals in the past 40 years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/29/earth-lost-50-wildlife-in-40-years-wwf>
.

“The risk if we continue on our current trajectory is very high. If you look 
out your window and count six species and think that one of those will 
potentially disappear, that’s quite profound,” said the study’s author, Mark C 
Urban, of the University of Connecticut.

“Those losses would affect our economy, our cultures, our food security, our 
health. It really compels us to act.”

Any deal that emerges from the UN climate summit in Paris is not expected to 
initially be enough to hold warming to 2C 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/31/us-set-to-propose-emissions-cuts-of-28-ahead-of-global-climate-treaty>
, the ‘safe’ level of warming world leaders are committed to, though the hope 
is governments’ carbon-cutting pledges will later be strengthened sufficiently 
to meet it.

But even if governments do manage to hold global warming to 2C, one in 20 
species (5.2%) still face extinction, the study found.

If manmade greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current record-breaking 
rate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/21/record-co2-emissions-committing-world-to-dangerous-climate-change>
, leading to a temperature rise of more than 4C by the end of the century, 16% 
of species, or one in six, face extinction.

The study also emphasises that even for the animals and plants that avoid 
extinction, climate change could bring about substantial changes in their 
numbers and distribution.

, said: “The loss of one in six species, would be an absolute tragedy, not only 
because it is sad to lose any part of our rich natural world, but also because 
biodiversity is fundamental in providing important functions and services, 
including to humans.

“Such significant changes to biological systems would undoubtedly have 
knock-on effects, and could potentially result in the collapse of entire 
systems.”

Richard Walters, lecturer in ecology and evolutionary biology at the 
University of Reading, said: “Ecologists have attempted to predict the risk of 
extinction under climate change for some time now but this meta-analysis 
provides our most comprehensive guesstimate to date.

“We know that the accuracy of forecasts are dependent upon a whole suite of 
assumptions, but what this study helps us to identify is which are the most 
important unknowns.”

Climate change affects wildlife directly and indirectly, through changing 
weather patterns that may affect the food they rely on or the habitat they live 
in. Species in the Arctic are considered particularly vulnerable, with polar 
bears being forced to swim further distances for foodas sea ice melts to record 
lows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/19/arctic-sea-ice-extent-hits-record-low-for-winter-maximum>
. Ringed seals depend on the sea ice, which they rest on and mate below.


But the slow-motion rate at which some of the predicted extinctions will 
happen means that targeted conservation efforts for some at-risk species could 
help them survive a warmer world – while other species may be able to adapt in 
time.

“This isn’t just doom and gloom. We still have time. Extinctions can take a 
long time. There are processes that could be important in mediating these 
effects, for example evolution, but we really need to very quickly start to 
understand these risks in a much more sophisticated way,” said Urban.


His meta-analysis looked at 131 previously published studies on warming’s 
impact on wildlife, dating back to the early 1990s, most of which modelled how 
much habitat becomes unsuitable for species under future climates.

For example, the Haleakalā silversword, a striking-looking plant that is only 
found on the Hawaiian island of Maui, was saved by conservationists from 
overzealous collectors in the 19th centurybut its habitat is now increasingly 
too dry and warm for new seedlings

.

Urban said that his findings should inform the Paris climate summit, and 
showed the importance of acting now on cutting greenhouse gas emissions rather 
than waiting for 20 years, when the evidence of species loss under global 
warming becomes identifiable beyond the background noise of ‘natural’ 
extinctions.

Dr Stephen Cornelius, WWF-UK’s chief adviser on climate change, said: “This 
study further highlights the urgency of taking strong action to address climate 
change and that ‘business as usual’ is no longer an option. We have the 
technology to tackle climate change, what we need now is the political will and 
investment in a clean, low-carbon future.”


Walters added: “Worryingly this study suggests that the risk of extinction 
accelerates with every degree increase in global temperature, which has 
important implications for our understanding of what constitutes a ‘safe’ 
increase in global temperature.”
