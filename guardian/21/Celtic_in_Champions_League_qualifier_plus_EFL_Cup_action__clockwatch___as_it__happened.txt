It’s 13-13 now. I think 15-14 is an English record. But now McKee’s penalty is

We have an upset! Top-flight Watford are out!

Gillingham complete their 2-1 win over Watford, who become the first Premier 
League club to exit the competition. The Hornets are repeat offenders here: 
they have only got to the third round of the League Cup once in the last eight 
seasons.

Brendan Rodgers, having guided Celtic into the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> courtesy of an 
exceedingly squeaky win over Hapoel Be’er Sheva, speaks:

It was probably the longest game of my life. We half-expected it anyway, it 
was a very difficult evening for us. I thought they played really really well, 
but we showed a real resilience, the identity of the team. The mentality that 
we’ve built up over pre-season came through and by the end I thought that we 
were, never comfortable, but we blocked out by going to a five, a diamond and 
one up front.

We just couldn’t get hold of the ball. We didn’t have enough belief in the 
first half. That’s natural, with so much riding on the game and what the 
players have been through before. The first 20 minutes of the second half they 
were really pushing on and gambling, then we moved to the five.

It was poor goals we conceded. You can’t make mistakes like that. These things 
happen in big pressure situations. But they found a calmness again. We knew we 
had to defend for our lives in that second half, and the players deserve a huge 
amount of credit, they came through a difficult situation very well.

 From this angle the ball is well over the line, despite the efforts of

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are clinging on to a 5-4

lucky to get a corner for his pains. It is cleared.

Sadio Mané. Near-simultaneously, Sergi Canos scores his second and Norwich’s 
fifth against Coventry (who at least have one of their own).

Beer Sheva have brought on Yuval Shabtai for Miguel Vitor, a like-for-like 
change in the back four, I think.

And so am I. It’s been memorable. Bye!
 
And Reading complete the evening’s action by beating MK Dons 4-3 on penalties! 
We’re done!
 
Timi Max Elsnik wins it for Derby, completing a 14-13 victory on penalties 
over Carlisle!
 
It’s 13-13 now. I think 15-14 is an English record. But now McKee’s penalty is 
stopped by Carson! Can Derby win it 14-13?
 
Derby 12-12 Carlisle.
 
Derby 11-11 Carlisle.
 
Derby 10-10 Carlisle.
 
Kabong Tshimanga has equalised for MK Dons at Reading in the 118th minute. 
More penalties in the offing there.
 
It’s now 9-9, and everyone on the field – referee excepted – has now taken a 
penalty.
 
8-8. This might not end.
 
8-7 in Carlisle’s favour. Scott Carson is up next for Derby.
 
Lowe has scored his penalty for Derby, and it’s 7-7 now. Crumbs.
 
In the late kick-off, Callum Harriott has given Reading a 114th-minute lead. 
2-1 now.
 
Tom Miller puts Carlisle 7-6 up. Can Derby stay in this?
 
Meanwhile at Derby, the first 12 penalties all went in, and then the next two 
both didn’t. It’s 6-6 there.
 
Confirmed upset! West Bromwich are out as well! Kenji Gorre calmly scores the 
decisive penalty to book Northampton’s place in round three!

West Brom have missed another penalty! Morrison’s penalty is saved, and 
Northampton have a kick to win it!
 
It’s into sudden death penalty shootage at Derby, the first 10 penalties all 
going in.
 
John-Joe O’Toole is the second to miss from the spot at Northampton, so it’s 
level at 2-2 after three kicks each.
 
Saido Berahino is the first to miss a penalty at Northampton – and Taylor 
pushes home the home side’s advantage: it’s 2-1 on penalties there.
 
Gillingham complete their 2-1 win over Watford, who become the first Premier 
League club to exit the competition. The Hornets are repeat offenders here: 
they have only got to the third round of the League Cup once in the last eight 
seasons.
 
Blackburn Rovers, meanwhile, are through, 4-3 victors against Crewe in a 
ding-dong, see-saw encounter.
 
Penalties will decide Carlisle v Derby and Northampton v West Brom.
 
Bristol City have beaten Scunthorpe 2-1 after extra time. West Brom are in 
stoppage time at the end of extra time, and still being held 2-2 by Northampton.
 
Watford’s seldom-seen home-grown defender Tommie Hoban has a shot cleared off 
the line, but Sky say they “look as though they’re in a trance at the moment”, 
which isn’t a good thing.
 
Brendan Rodgers, having guided Celtic into the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> courtesy of an 
exceedingly squeaky win over Hapoel Be’er Sheva, speaks:

It was probably the longest game of my life. We half-expected it anyway, it 
was a very difficult evening for us. I thought they played really really well, 
but we showed a real resilience, the identity of the team. The mentality that 
we’ve built up over pre-season came through and by the end I thought that we 
were, never comfortable, but we blocked out by going to a five, a diamond and 
one up front.

We just couldn’t get hold of the ball. We didn’t have enough belief in the 
first half. That’s natural, with so much riding on the game and what the 
players have been through before. The first 20 minutes of the second half they 
were really pushing on and gambling, then we moved to the five.

It was poor goals we conceded. You can’t make mistakes like that. These things 
happen in big pressure situations. But they found a calmness again. We knew we 
had to defend for our lives in that second half, and the players deserve a huge 
amount of credit, they came through a difficult situation very well.
 
So far this season Watford have taken the lead in 100% of their games, and won 
0% of them.
 
Gillingham have taken a 2-1 lead at Watford! Bradley Dack scores it, though it 
took a while for the referee to decide the ball crossed the line after bouncing 
down off the bar.
 From this angle the ball is well over the line, despite the efforts of

The final whistle blows, and Celtic

More final scores: Chelsea have beaten Bristol Rovers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolrovers> 3-2, and Norwich have 
pipped Coventry 6-1.
 
We’re midway through the four minutes of stoppage time in Beer Sheva, and the 
referee has largely spent them booking people, which will suitCeltic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> fine. Craig Gordon gets a yellow 
card for timewasting, and Shabtai one for fouling.
 
Comeback kids Blackburn have been revenge-comebacked, Crewe’s Chris Dagnall 
popping up with a last-minute equaliser.
 
Final scores start to drift in, and Liverpool are 5-0 winners against Burton, 
while Stoke have beatenStevenage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stevenage> 4-0.
 
Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> boot the ball randomly 
into the Beer Sheva half, and there’s now just one minute plus stoppages to 
play and they continue to cling to their horribly slender advantage.
 
Blackburn, 2-0 down at home to Crewe with three minutes of the first half 
remaining, now lead 3-2 with two minutes of the second half to play.
 
Arouna Koné has placed the cherry atop Everton’s case, with their third 
unanswered goal against Yeovil.

Into the last six minutes in Israel, and Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> are clinging on to a 5-4 
aggregate lead and not looking very good about it. Sahar gets played in on the 
left of the penalty area but scoops a cross to nobody in particular, and is 
lucky to get a corner for his pains. It is cleared.
 
Gillingham have equalised at Watford, Mark Byrne scoring. Apparently it was “a 
superb strike”.
 
Sturridge scores his second and Liverpool’s fifth against Burton, set up by 
Sadio Mané. Near-simultaneously, Sergi Canos scores his second and Norwich’s 
fifth against Coventry (who at least have one of their own).
 
Possible upset update: Northampton have equalised against West Brom, Alex 
Revell with it.

A first final score of the night: Crystal Palace have beaten Blackpool 2-0 in 
the earlyish kick-off.
 
Adama Diomandé has scored his second goal of the night to give Hull a 2-1 lead 
at Exeter.

Beer Sheva have brought on Yuval Shabtai for Miguel Vitor, a like-for-like 
change in the back four, I think.
 
Liverpool are 4-0 up at Burton, Daniel Sturridge scoring his seventh goal in 
his last seven League Cup appearances, tapping in James Milner’s low cross.
 
Brighton have gone 2-1 up at Oxford, Kazenga LuaLua scoring, and QPR have gone 
2-1 up at home to Rochdale, Sandro scoring both goals.
 
Hoban has another effort in Beer Sheva, but Gordon saves and – just – holds it.
 
And Gillingham have not taken their chance. Bradley Dack has blazed his 
penalty over the bar, and Watford remain 1-0 up.
