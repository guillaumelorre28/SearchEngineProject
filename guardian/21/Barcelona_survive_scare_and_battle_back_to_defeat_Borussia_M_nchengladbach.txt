The hard-working Bundesliga side had taken a surprising lead, scoring against 
the run of play, with Thorgan Hazard slotting in to complete a quick break in 
the 34th minute.

Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, who had Messi 
missing with a groin injury, dominated the game but were made to work hard for 
their second group win that put them on six points.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/celtic-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report>
 to stay second on four points.

The Barça coach Luis Enrique started with Andrés Iniesta, Javier Mascherano, 
Jordi Alba and Ivan Rakitic, all of whom were rested in the 5-0 thrashing of 
Sporting Gijon at the weekend.

Despite the absence of Messi, replaced by youngster Paco Alcácer, it was 
Barcelona who stamped their authority on the game early on and carved out the 
first chance with Neymar’s shot from inside the box saved by keeper Yann Sommer 
after seven minutes.

Luis Suárez should have put them ahead three minutes later when he pounced on 
a defensive error but he saw his powerful left-footed shot sail narrowly wide.

The Uruguayan was also the recipient of a brilliant defence-splitting pass 
from Neymar but instead of rifling the ball home he tried a cutback to Alcácer 
that was cleared.

Gladbach gradually grew in confidence but struggled to get past a Spanish wall 
when they tried to venture forward.

They scored when forward Raffael, back from injury, gained possession in 
midfield and launched a quick break with Hazard tapping in from a Mahmoud 
Dahoud pass.

The Brazilian’s injury in the 48th minute and his substitution took out most 
of the Gladbach pace.

The introduction of Turan on the hour brought instant results for Barcelona, 
with the Turkey international picking up a Neymar pass in the 65th minute and 
drilling the ball into the roof of the net from a tight angle.

Piqué then pounced on a weak clearance by Sommer from a Suárez shot to tap in 
from close range and hand Barcelona a hard-fought victory.
