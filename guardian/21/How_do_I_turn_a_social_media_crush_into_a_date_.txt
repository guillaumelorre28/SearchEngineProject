Not long ago, online dating was a bit embarrassing – an implied concession 
that you’d exhausted your options among friends, friends of friends, and the 
children of your parents’ friends “in the real world”.

Today the proliferation of apps such as Tinder, Hinge, Happn and Bumble have 
made it mainstream even in countries such as the UK, Australia and New Zealand, 
where there’s no established culture of “dating” at all.

Personally I’m all for it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/05/online-dating-and-tinder-tech-isnt-the-problem-its-the-predators-using-it>
: handwringing over the “death of romance” brought about by these apps often 
boils down to technophobia or moralising over casual sex, when in fact they 
help people date outside their immediate circle. If you’ve ever been in a group 
setting and realised, with no small horror, that everyone present is either 
your ex or a friend’s ex, you will attest that this is no bad thing.

Look at photos they’re tagged in, not just those they post – and pay attention 
to who consistently likes their selfies

Plus, the algorithms employed by more formal online services such as OkCupid 
do a lot of the groundwork of establishing compatibility, pre-empting 
deal-breakers by asking “Should gay marriage be legal?” and “Does living on a 
sailboat sound like a good idea?”


As someone who grew up on a sailboat, I’m in favour of every safeguard to 
prevent me from reliving the experience.

But even outside online dating platforms, it’s easy to register – and solicit 
– romantic interest on the internet. There is a dance one performs on social 
media to turn a platonic friendship, acquaintance or even “internet friend” 
into something more.

Just as a bird of paradise might display his plumage to attract the attention 
of a potential mate, a man interested in youmight like your three-week-old 
Instagram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/nov/13/i-accidentally-liked-a-six-week-old-photo-on-instagram-what-do-i-do>
 post, or send you a direct message (as in, “slides into your DMs”).

I defer, as I often do, to teenagers: experts in the field of online 
flirtation. A Pew Research Centerstudy from October 2015 
<http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/01/teens-technology-and-romantic-relationships/>
 said 47% of teenagers aged 13 to 17 had “expressed their attraction” to their 
crush via social media (55% had done so in person). Thequotes from high school 
students <http://www.pewinternet.org/online-romance/> are illustrative.

“If you’re really putting yourself out there, you could comment on their 
picture with a heart emoji.”

“When I have a crush on someone and I want them to know I go on their page and 
like a lot of pictures in a row.”

“Like all of them. Like, like, like, like, like, like all the pictures.” 

“The main way you’re going to know is when they first say ‘hey’. How many Ys 
they put on their ‘hey’.”

I accidentally liked a six-week-old photo on Instagram. What do I do?

Several of my own romantic dalliances have been initiated or progressed over 
social media, particularlyTwitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter>. Allow me to convince you that 
this is less sad than it sounds: at its best, the platform is like a lively bar 
– it’s easy to meet like-minded people; you can eavesdrop or join in on others’ 
conversations; everyone is a bit funnier and more attractive there than they 
are in daylight.

And from observing banter that’s then gone conspicuously silent as the 
conversation is moved to private messaging, like a couple who think they’ve 
very discreetly removed themselves from a house party, I am confident I am not 
the only one. (Tip: it’s never the people blowing up your timeline with their 
tedious flirtation who have taken their Twitter friendship to the next level. 
It’s the people whowere.)

You’re more likely to use Instagram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram> and Facebook to investigate 
crushes in your outer circle of friends, particularly to establish whether 
they’re single or not. (Another tip: look at photos they’re tagged in, not just 
those they post – and pay attention to who consistently like their selfies.)

The trick to translating an online flirtation into a real-life date is 
progressing up the “totem of chat”, to quote the show Girls: the lowest being 
“Facebook, followed by Gchat, then texting, then email, then phone”. (“Face to 
face is of course ideal, but it’s not of this time.”) In this case, it might go 
from liking a photo, to commenting with an emoji, to private messaging, to 
naming a time and place to meet.

Now, after all that, you’ve got to work out if you actually like them, 
particularly if you’re meeting for the first time. Some people’s online 
presences are not representative, which can be a good or a bad thing. Sometimes 
you meet someone who is as good value online as they are in person: you should 
hold them tight and never let them go.

Other times it’s painfully obvious that you’re better as internet friends. 
When you’ve communicated more – and more intimately – with someone over text 
than you have in person, it can create a gulf that’s awkward to bridge, and 
sometimes insurmountable.

How do you cast someone back into the internet from whence they came?

You might try “ghosting” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/mar/29/how-ghosting-became-phenomenon-in-modern-dating>
: cutting off contact with zero announcement or explanation.According to the 
experts <https://www.wired.com/2016/08/how-teens-use-social-media/>, it’s 
“common and not considered particularly impolite … usually a mutual, conscious 
uncoupling” (“If you start losing juice, they’ll start losing juice”).

I have mixed feelings about it as a tactic, having seen too many hearts broken 
more by the absence of explanation than the depth of investment, but it’s not 
an inappropriate course of action after one fireworks-free first meeting.


If you’re too old school or fundamentally decent to disappear entirely, you 
can get out of this mess the way you got into it: by pushing them back down the 
totem of chat. Answer missed calls with texts, respond to texts with messages 
on Twitter or Facebook and, eventually, public posts. They’ll get the idea.
