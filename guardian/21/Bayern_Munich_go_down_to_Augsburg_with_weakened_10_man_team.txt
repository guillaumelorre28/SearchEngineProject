A weakened Bayern Munich <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> 
crashed to a 1-0 home loss to Augsburg in the Bundesliga, a fourth successive 
defeat which will do little to lift confidence before their Champions League 
semi-final second leg against Barcelona next week.

Augsburg’s Raúl Bobadilla flicked the ball home with a back-heel in the 71st 
minute for their first win at the Allianz Arena. Ten-man Bayern, already 
crowned champions, struggled throughout.

The Bavarians have now lost four games in a row, after defeats by Borussia 
Dortmund in the German Cup, Bayer Leverkusen in the league and Barcelona in the 
Champions League this week.

Pep Guardiola rested some of his players before Tuesday’s return leg, 
following their 3-0 loss in Spain, but his plans disintegrated after 14 
minutes. The reserve goalkeeper Pepe Reina felled Bobadilla in the box to get 
his marching orders, forcing Manuel Neuer off the bench. However, the Germany 
international was not required to make a save from the resulting penalty, as 
Paul Verhaegh’s powerful shot went wide after rattling the post.

But Bobadilla beat Neuer after several attempts in the second half, his 
audacious flick keepingAugsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg> 
in fifth place and on course for a Europa League spot, on 46 points with two 
games left.
