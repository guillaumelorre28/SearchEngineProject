As a lifelong Rolling Stones fan who fully recognises their genuine respect 
for the blues and its heritage (Reviews 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/24/the-rolling-stones-blue-and-lonesome-review-covers-album-mick-jagger>
, G2, 25 November), I find it all the more disappointing that their (black) 
bass player Darryl Jones is not included in band photos and still appears to be 
treated as a mere hired hand, 23 years after he replaced Bill Wyman.

• Nick Wyatt (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/27/high-flyer-economists-keep-show-on-the-road>
, 28 November) asks how many bathtubs make one Wales. You can’t equate a 
measure of volume with one of area, but for the record, if all of the sugary 
drinks consumed by 11- to 18-year-olds in one year were poured over Wales, the 
resulting sticky mess would be about an inch deep.

• Conundrum: I share the cost of the Guardian with my husband. He reads all 
the sport section, I find so little reporting of women’s sport that I don’t 
bother. What percentage should I pay or just continue to use it to light the 
fire?

• No wonder there are so many estate agents – I learn that not only do they 
charge me as a landlord a fee for making the inventory of the flat at the 
change of tenants, they charge the tenant as well (Unfair letting fees ban? 
Truth is the agents just got too greedy

• Is it really such a shock that Ed’s gone (Last dance for Balls as he steps 
out of Strictly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/27/ed-balls-voted-off-strictly-come-dancing>
, 28 November)? Perhaps the voters who challenged the system by backing someone 
with little expertise beyond buffoonery withdrew their support when they 
realised where it might lead. Strangely comforting.

• If the US president-elect backs down on his promise to build a wall on the 
Mexican border perhaps he could construct a Trump-l’oeil instead (The 
billionaire cowboy builder

, G2, 28 November).
