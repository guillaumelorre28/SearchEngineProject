With Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2015/apr/15/manny-pacquiao-floyd-mayweather-podcast-boxing-biggest-fight>
 right around the corner, there’s already been speculation about who, if 
anyone, is “next” in boxing, after the eventual departure of the two superstars 
who have ruled the sport’s box office and pound-for-pound throne since the late 
aughts.

It’s a fickle guessing game. We assemble a list like this one annually 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2014/feb/06/30-young-boxers-on-rise-in-2014>
, when we look at the boxers aged 30 and under who could be on the rise. We 
started drawing up the list two weeks ago; since then, two men who might have 
featured more prominently –Julio Cesar Chavez, Jr. 
<http://bloguin.com/queensberryrules/2015-articles/andrzej-fonfara-stops-julio-cesar-chavez-jr-whos-a-lazy-child.html>
 andDanny Garcia 
<http://bloguin.com/queensberryrules/2015-articles/danny-garcia-edges-late-charging-lamont-peterson-on-nbc.html>
 – have lost or were seen to have lost, respectively.

Because the criteria for this list is questioned each year, here is an 
explanation. Whether one thinks a boxer who is 30 years old is “young” or not 
is a matter of perspective but, for whatever reason, boxers are now able to 
fight at a high level far beyond that. Mayweather and Pacquiao are 38 and 36 
years old, and are generally thought of as the two best fighters in the game. 
Only two fighters on one representativepound-for-pount top 10 list 
<http://www.tbrb.org/p4p/> are below the age of 31. Top boxers are still very 
much in their physical primes at age 30, so the cutoff is a somewhat arbitrary 
number, but well within the range of when a fighter might still be on the rise 
and still be considered “young” in boxing terms.

It is not a list of prospects. Some prospects do appear on the list but we’re 
mostly looking for people who have proven themselves at least a little. At the 
same time we’re looking for people who will be around for many more years; 
while Gennady Golovkin might be one of boxing’s purest rising stars, he also 
has less room to conquer and grow.

Some of the names on this list are familiar. Some might already have been 
considered to have “made it”; some might be, at this exact moment, on a decline 
from their highest moment in their careers thus far. The list is looking at 
people who have the potential to improve their standing over the rest of 2015. 
The emphasis is slightly on the US but everyone is considered no matter their 
location.

The top tier

Canelo Alvarez, junior middleweight, 24

Upside: The only proven pay-per-view draw in the US right now not named 
Mayweather, Pacquiao or Miguel Cotto has taken the pole position in cementing 
the Mexican and Mexican-American audience as his, a place he once fought for 
with Julio César Chávez, Canelo, whose looks give him appeal, has, against 
Erislandy Lara and Austin Trout, proven he can win fights against difficult 
opponents that others would rather avoid, and he’s the best pure junior 
middleweight, by resume, as a result. And here’s the most important part: after 
a great deal of will they/won’t they, he now looks poised to face Cotto later 
this year, which would be a mammoth Mexican/Puerto Rican showdown of the kind 
that could vault Alvarez into the role of boxing’s US moneymaking heir apparent.

Downside: There are people who will tell you he didn’t deserve the win against 
either Lara or Trout and his allegedly record-breaking PPV audienceagainst 
Mayweather saw him get absolutely plastered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/15/floyd-mayweather-beats-canelo-alvarez>
, resembling a deer in the headlights more than a boxer. One school of thought 
says that everyone looks bad against a trio like that, while another school of 
thought raises doubts about his boxing ability. Also, a lot of Mexican fans 
don’t like their boxers pretty. And finally, if he sticks to the pay-per-view 
from here on out, he will be limiting the ability of his audience to grow 
beyond the hardcore US fanbase that buys everything.

Terence Crawford, junior welterweight, 27

Upside: Coming off what was a 2014 Fighter of the Year campaign in the eyes of 
some, Crawford got ahot start 
<http://bloguin.com/queensberryrules/2015-articles/lucas-matthysse-earns-crunching-decision-over-ruslan-provodnikov.html>
 in a new division this past weekend by destroying top-10 contender Thomas 
Dulorme. So, after establishing himself as the lightweight king, he immediately 
put to rest any notion that he wouldn’t carry his power up to 140 pounds. He 
seems like a good kid and his home state of Nebraska has embraced him, turning 
the Cornhusker State into an unlikely boxing hotbed. He might already be a 
pound-for-pound top 10 fighter; it’s hard to ignore his versatile skills, his 
mixture of speed and power, his ability to adjust mid-fight and his desire to 
leave no punch unanswered. Finally, he appears to have quieted all the talk 
from early in his rise that he was “boring 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2013/oct/09/ranking-boxings-allegedly-boring-fighters>
”.

Downside: If you can find a personality anywhere, let us know. He’s quiet to a 
fault and he doesn’t seem to have an interesting story outside the ring. His 
family and friends get moreattention 
<https://www.facebook.com/TheQueensberryRules/photos/pb.330673286988182.-2207520000.1429497525./573497566039085/?type=1&theater>
 from the press, and, while it might be unfair, it usually takes some charisma 
for a fighter to make it at the top level as an attraction. There were some 
diminishing returns on his second homecoming fight in Nebraska and he didn’t 
even headline the HBO card where he took Dulorme apart. And while Dulorme was a 
legitimate contender, he is not the class of the division; he can further 
diminish the “unproven” label at 140 if he takes on Lucas Matthysse next, a 
bout that fans were already salivating about after Saturday’s outcome.

Anthony Joshua, heavyweight, 25

Upside: He’s the total package: He has speed, power, size, Olympic pedigree 
and a little bit of an edge with his cockiness. After years of boxing fans 
being forced to look at flabby heavyweights, Joshua is some kind of 
ultra-mesomorph. The UK seems to be fully united behind him and he’s widely 
seen as the country’s best shot at producing an elite heavyweight since Lennox 
Lewis. In a few years he could be the most likely fighter to beat Wladimir 
Klitschko. If he does that, he’ll be a huge star. Klitschko isn’t beloved by 
everyone in the US but still does great television ratings, compared to other 
modern day boxers. An exciting heavyweight champ from the UK? Nationalistic 
pride is such that Klitschko remains a sore spot, but the US fan base would 
probably trade Klitschko for Joshua in a second.

Downside: He is, by far, the least proven fighter in this small top tier. All 
signs point to a checkered flag for this guy on the way to excellence but he 
is, at best, a borderline contender, maybe more of a prospect. He’s trouncing 
journeymen and gatekeepers who don’t get trounced that easily, sure, but he’s 
hardly the first to trounce that kind – and we’ve seen a lot of hotly touted 
young fighters eventually run into a style that derails them. His chin has 
shown no signs of dings yet but it’s the higher-level fighters who would give 
him those dings.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2014/feb/06/30-young-boxers-on-rise-in-2014>
Deontay Wilder, heavyweight, 29

Upside: Wilder’s the second heavyweight on this list already and he’s not the 
last. If you’re looking for a potentially big follow-up act to 
Mayweather-Pacquiao, it might be a (finally!) resurgent heavyweight division, 
more often than not the cash cow of boxing. Wilder has a lot of the same 
qualities as Joshua but he’s more proven. He withstood the adversity of a hurt 
hand against Bermane Stiverne, a certified contender, and whatever uncertainty 
was out there about his ability to take a punch now stands diminished. Oh, 
yeah, and he’s an American, the country’s last male Olympian to medal. An 
American heavyweight champion with a superstar makeup is a golden ticket.

Downside: He entered the sport late so, whatever qualities he shares with 
Joshua, one of them he does not is polish. Make no mistake, Wilder has grown by 
leaps and bounds as a professional fighter in the last couple years – he’s not 
the guy who once more closely resembled an Andy Kaufman wrestling windmill than 
a professional prizefighter. But you do wonder what would happen if he ran into 
someone with the fundamentals of Alexander Povetkin or the size of Tyson Fury 
(not that there are many heavyweights beyond those two who have much of 
either). One more thing is that some found it a bit unsavoury for him to beat 
up some mentally ill fellow off the street and then brag about it to TMZ 
<http://bloguin.com/queensberryrules/2014-articles/what-everyone-is-getting-wrong-about-deontay-wilder-and-the-internet-troll.html>
.

The second tier

Artur Beterbiev, light heavyweight, 30
Canada has, for some time now, had one of the best boxing fanbases in the 
world, and Beterbiev might be the successor to Lucian Bute, Jean Pascal, Adonis 
Stevenson and others as a big attraction there. He’s a highly polished young 
fighter with big power who is beating top competition at a very early juncture 
of his career, and he appeared on CBS recently, so he’s getting a US push, 
although he did have a scare with a knockdown against Jeff Page, Jr. that 
should give everyone a little pause.

Kell Brook, welterweight, 28
After years of inconsistency, Brook delivered a star-making turn against Shawn 
Porter in 2014, then further established his fortitude by coming back 
spectacularly from being literally stabbed. He has that explosive mix of speed 
and power that some of the best have and now he has the poise and 
battle-hardened stance he needs to take it to the next level. But who will give 
him a chance to keep moving? A showdown with Amir Khan would make megabucks and 
cement him as the king of British boxing (assuming Carl Froch remains 
semi-retired), buthis UK rival doesn’t seem to want any of it

 Carl Frampton is held aloft by trainer Shane McGuigan after a fifth-round 
stoppage against Chris Avalos. Photograph: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile/Corbis 
Carl Frampton, junior featherweight, 28
The only fight that rivals Brook-Khan on domestic soil is Frampton-Scott Quigg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/07/carl-frampton-rejects-scott-quigg-fight-promotional-rights>
, a great regional fight in a quality junior featherweight division.Frampton 
has the best all-around, do-everything stature 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/01/carl-frampton-chris-avalos> in 
his division other than 122-pound champion Guillermo Rigondeaux. It’s too bad 
that he seems to be balking at terms for a Quigg fight that seem quite 
generous, frankly. He would probably win the fight and could then advertise his 
ticket-selling potential to any future opponent and leverage it for a very 
bankable career.

Tyson Fury, heavyweight, 26
If you’re talking about UK marketability, the ginormous Fury is off the charts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/01/tyson-fury-wladimir-klitschko-christian-hammer>
. And he’s shown that he’s more than just a love-him-or-hate-him big mouth, 
beating difficult opponents time and again and evenshowing off flexibility 
against Dereck Chisora 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/30/chris-eubank-jr-billy-joe-saunders>
 he had never before shown. A Fury-Klitschko fight looks increasingly winnable, 
even if Fury would rightfully be the sizeable underdog. It’s too bad he’s 
flirting with mixed martial arts, because, like the other big men on this list, 
he could lead a resurgence in heavyweight boxing. Or maybe it’s just more of 
Fury’s savvy self-marketing, to put himself in the MMA discussion – let’s hope.

Juan Francisco Estrada, flyweight, 25
Estrada has the opposite problem of the heavyweights, who are not as talented 
as they used to be but have built-in appeal: he’s an exciting boxer-puncher who 
gave one of the best fighters in the world, Román González, his hardest fight 
since his rise. It’s too bad many boxing fans, even some of the most devoted, 
look down on boxing’s little men. Perhaps that’s about to change. When we get 
to González, we’ll explain why. Hey, look!

Román González, flyweight, 27
González, who some consider possibly the second best active fighter on the 
planet, is finally poised to appear on a big US network, HBO, in May. His 
acclaim in boxing circles is justifiably outsized for his frame. We’ve seen 
boxing embrace sub-heavyweight fighters for stretches in the past several 
decades, be it welterweight and middleweight in the 1980s or welterweight now, 
but if the sport can embrace men who are outweighed by female supermodels, 
it’ll be a quantum leap for the range of quality match-ups they can enjoy. If 
anyone can do it, it’s probably Gonzalez-Estrada – especially if they stop 
making big money demands and sign for a rematch.

Naoya Inoue, junior bantamweight, 22
Among all the talented pros on this list who are simultaneously gifted and 
proven, Inoue has the earliest combination of both in even measure. He was a 
viable contender for 2014 Fighter of the Year, having halted the endless, 
dreary junior bantamweight run of Omar Narvaez by KO, and taking out two 
flyweights by stoppage while he was at it. Japan, which does absurd TV ratings 
for boxing compared to the US, has a vacancy among pugilists to watch in droves 
with the suspension of the Kameda clan, and Inoue could fill that role. 
Ultimately Inoue’s size and lack of visibility in the US hold him back.

Vasyl Lomachenko, featherweight, 27
Talk about total packages: there might not be a more complete fighter right 
now than Lomachenko. His domination of Gary Russell, Jr. looks all the better 
after Russell’s most recent sterling showing. He won his last fight with one 
hand and he’s due for a showcase on the undercard of Mayweather-Pacquiao. The 
US seems to have fully embraced the Soviet Bloc invasion, so that won’t hold 
him back, and like Frampton, he has the ability to make his mark in a deep 
division, plus he has the backing of HBO. The only hold-up might be that he’s 
still very early in his career, and featherweights are currently below the 
Maginot Line of broad fan appeal.

Gary Russell, Jr., featherweight, 26
What an odd career arc. Russell went from acclaimed prospect to much-maligned 
Al Haymon welfare queen to bubble-burst Lomachenko-victim to 
oh-wait-he-is-still-real, Jhonny Gonzalez smasher. What’s interesting about the 
Gonzalez win is that it showed not only his talent in a bit of a style 
mismatch, but that he had grown. Even in his loss to Lomachenko, he 
demonstrated heart. There’s a lot to work with here, if his team are brave 
enough to keep making challenging matches for him (because he’s going to keep 
getting a push from influential adviser Haymon). That’s the biggest question – 
“Will he be in tough anytime soon?” – other than perhaps the size question that 
the other featherweights face.

Errol Spence, Jr., welterweight, 25
Spence is the clear top prospect among the 2012 US Olympians, which counts for 
a lot. His transition from amateur to pro has been the most seamless among that 
crew – he’s really very talented. He’ll be in the running for Prospect of the 
Year if he keeps up what he’s doing, even though he was last year, too. All he 
needs is seasoning, and for us to find out if he can make the transition from 
top prospect to top contender. It might not happen in 2015.

Keith Thurman, welterweight, 26
The hype train for Thurman – once seen as a mouthy, funny, powerful 
welterweight with substantial boxing ability – has slowed a little based on his 
last two fights. He’s not knocking out guys like he used to, is the main 
problem, which suggests he was taking advantage of inferior opposition. But his 
power is far from non-existent, his personality is far from dull, and his 
boxing ability might still be coming along. As the debut main event fighter for 
Haymon’s “PremierBoxing <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing> Champions,” 
he was exposed to the biggest live U.S. boxing audience in a long time, “The 
Contender” excluded. If he can get some top opponents and win, he’s still very 
much in line for stardom.

Félix Verdejo, lightweight, 21
Verdejo is probably the most-ballyhooed prospect in boxing, and not without 
reason. He’s got that all-around boxer-puncher thing, with the ability to score 
big knockouts and a Puerto Rican fan base ready to riot on his behalf. As with 
some of the others on this list, all that’s holding him back is his level of 
competition. We’ll see what he’s made of for sure once he steps it up.

Honourable mentions

Demetrius Andrade, junior middleweight, 27
Skilled, less boring in each of his last fights than before and a good 
interview, Andrade just needs the right competition to step it up to the next 
level.

Adrien Broner, junior welterweight, 25
Once in the first tier, he has fallen here thanks to many lacklustre 
performances and various distractions, but he frequently makes mainstream media 
headlines, isn’t without ability and is getting the PBC push, albeit with some 
censorship.

Julio César Chávez, Jr., light heavyweight, 29
Still a big name in Mexico because of his dad, still a fun fighter to watch, 
his laziness and his loss to Andrzej Fonfara are troubling signs, as is the 
beer bombardment after he quit and utter denial of what happened in the bout.

James DeGale, super middleweight, 29
If DeGale can beat the athletically gifted Andre Dirrell in his next fight, he 
has crossover appeal beyond the UK.

Danny García, welterweight, 27
One of the biggest PBC beneficiaries, Garcia can’t seem to definitively win a 
fight anymore, keeps playing with weight and no amount of his father-trainer 
saying controversial things can cloak his results in the ring.

Marco Huck, cruiserweight, 30
Somehow still under the age threshold, Huck is a borderline top-20 
pound-for-pounder with a big German fan base and Garcia’s knack for close 
results that make you wonder how good he is when he’s squeaking by.

Amir Khan, welterweight, 28
He can punch the heck out of an empty bottle 
<https://twitter.com/HITCtopcorner/status/588691277060972544>, and has again 
asserted his abilities with a win over Devon Alexander, but his dodging of 
Brook while waiting for Mayweather or Pacquiao is getting mighty old.

Joseph Parker, heavyweight, 23
The latest heavyweight talent invited into the Klitschko training camp is 
showing signs of efficient effectiveness as a pro and can do some things if his 
New Zealand homeland doesn’t hold him back on the international scene.

Lee Selby, featherweight, 28
The popular Welshman is the featherweight with the hardest fight on the 
current books, against Evgeny Gradovich in May, a mean, sturdy grinder who 
almost made this list.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2015/apr/15/manny-pacquiao-floyd-mayweather-podcast-boxing-biggest-fight>
Oleksandr Usyk, cruiserweight, 28
He has a crazy haircut, which is either a plus or a minus from a marketability 
standpoint, while his results in the ring so far – very early, albeit against 
top opposition – are pure, and he could take over cruiserweight soonish.

Oscar Valdez, junior lightweight, 24
Valdez is like a more brawling-oriented version of fellow 2012 Olympian Latino 
prospect Verdejo, and with a Mexican fan base to draw upon, too.

Nicholas Walters, featherweight, 29
It’s been a long time since a Jamaican fighter was a big star (uh… Glen 
Johnson, kinda?) but Walters has the punch and the passion and the HBO backing 
in the ultra-deep featherweight division.

Julian Williams, junior middleweight, 25
Some people aren’t sure about him, but the versatile prospect has recently 
graduated to borderline contender and has a lot going for him in the ring.
