MISHMASH

1 J. Grimes (Norfolk): Confused mass Hamish expresses as ‘guddle’ (anag. less 
as, & lit.).


2 D. F. Manley (Oxford): What emerges from referendum is – h’m – a shambolic 
mess (hidden).

3 G. H. Willett (Wimbledon): Duffed overhead – it’s out! A failure of 
coordination? (mish(it s)mash).

VHC

M. Barley: Potpourri, when deployed, heads off horrible household miasms (
anag. incl. h, h).

T. C. Borland: No bad term for Hammersmith’s intertwining? (anag. less anag., 
& lit.).

Dr J. Burscough: Providing —— is ‘hash’ (i.e. providing ‘m’ is ‘h’, ‘mash’ is 
‘hash’; & lit.).

P. Cargill: Is ham not a filling for mince pie? (anag. less a in mash).

D. Clay (Egypt): To make cocktail, firstly mix ice with two parts sherry, then 
crush (m, i + sh + mash).,

E. Dawid: A motorway pile-up has hospital in chaos (h in M1 smash).

W. Drever: Working lunch ultimately is M&S ham salad (anag. incl. h).

Dr I. S. Fletcher: Confused assemblage? Maybe duff referendum’s conclusion has 
done for it (mishit with m + anag. for it).

D. V. Harry: Referendum’s end comes with an issue for Scots, pound down and 
allied group in disarray (m ism mash).

R. J. Heald: ‘Macaroni’ comprises term for such, in practice (h in ism in mash2
 (= masher), & lit.; macaroni = dandy).

R. J. Hooper: Salad contains e.g. sliced potato – it must be tossed (mish(it) 
+ mash).

J. C. Leyland: Salad? It doesn’t feature in e.g. sliced ham starter for 
slimmer being naughty (mish(it) + anag. incl. s).

T. J. Moorey: Mess created by Gove finally running, shame his manoeuvring 
brought about end of chum (m in anag. less e; ref. EU referendum).

C. Ogilvie: Confusion when horse is involved in pile-up on motorway (h (= 
heroin) in M1 smash).

S. Randall: Leaving university, has his mum to tidy up clutter (anag. less u).

C. Short: Melange – i.e. salmagundi, hotchpotch, miscellany and scrambled 
hash, a little bit of each (first letters & lit.).

P. L. Stone: Players’ mix-up? It comes from mishit with Marsh run out (
mish(it) + Ma(r)sh).

R. C. Teuton: Comic lead in movies has his chum in fine mess (anag. incl. m, 
m; in fine = finally; ref. Laurel & Hardy).

J. R. Tozer: A mix-up, a botched overhead, and it’s out (mish(it s)mash).

A. J. Varney: A little accident, spending a penny – the result of lots of 
water with meal (pie) (mish(a p) + mash).

L. Ward: Going by moppet’s face, I’m assuming mum has prepared macaroni (m + 
sh in I’m + anag.).

A. J. Young: A drop of malt is grand in a mince pie (m is + M in hash).

 Another mini-milestone passed, and a plain competition puzzle that was 
relatively plain sailing, I think: 203 entries, largely error-free except for a 
handful with PUTTEE for PUTTIE. 13 clues were voted favourite, the clear winner 
being ‘Mosque officer? Don’t give —— for ’is supper!’ for IMAM, with 20 votes 
(not, I hope, deserving of a fatwah). Joint runners-up, with 9 votes each, were 
the clues for CHAMBERPOT and IN ON. One vote against went to my clue to RÉSUMÉ, 
and with reason. The clue was ‘One practising turns in front of the author 
produces CV’ where ‘produces’ should be ‘to produce’ or ‘producing’ to work 
syntactically. A careless lapse, for which I apologize.

Another miscellany for you to clue. Typically I had forgotten that you’ve had 
in the past both SALMAGUNDY (No. 750) and FARRAGO (No, 2,161). This was perhaps 
the most tricky of the three to deal with, with its three doubled consonants 
and two vowels. The most popular idea involved a drunken or Connery-style 
slurring of ‘miss mass’ but few of these achieved wording that struck me as 
above average. I don’t often spend time thinking how I’d approach the challenge 
myself, but on this occasion I toyed with the idea of mishit less it and mashie 
less i.e., with ‘medley’ as the definition and the whole clue having a golfing 
flavour. A few of you tried something along these lines but not many. More than 
a few spoiled their chances by making a definition of the answer do double duty 
as an anagram indicator in the cryptic reading. In general, though, the quality 
of clues submitted was well up to standard.
