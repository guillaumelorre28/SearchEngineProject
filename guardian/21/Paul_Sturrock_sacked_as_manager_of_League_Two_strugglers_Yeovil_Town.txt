Sturrock, 59, took charge at Huish Park in April 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/28/paul-sturrock-yeovil-town> 
but has achieved only two wins from 20 league matches this season and leaves 
the club following Saturday’s 2-0 defeat at Northampton. Darren Way will take 
charge as interim manager with immediate effect with Terry Skiverton assisting 
him.

The Yeovil chairman, John Fry, said: “We are very sad that the board had to 
reach this decision today and we thank Paul for his hard work during his time 
at Huish Park. We wish him well for the future, however we all felt that in the 
light of recent results we had no alternative. We will now begin our search for 
a new manager.”

Sturrock took charge of his eighth different club – he has had two spells as 
Plymouth manager – when appointed by Yeovil and has won promotion five times 
but he was unable to save the club from relegation in May.

Yeovil finished bottom of League One last term and have never recovered from a 
poor start this season after losing five of their first six matches.
