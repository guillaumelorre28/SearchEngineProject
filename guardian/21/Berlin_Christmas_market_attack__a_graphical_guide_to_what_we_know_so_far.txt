The Tunisian man suspected of killing 12 people by driving a truck into the 
Breitscheidplatz Christmas market in Berlin on Monday was killed in a shootout 
with police in Milan early on Friday morning. Police officers stopped Anis Amri 
at 3am outside Sesto San Giovanni train station in the Piazza 1 Maggio and 
requested his ID. He then opened fire and wounded a police officer before he 
was shot dead.

A video was later posted online by the Amaq news agency which showed Amri 
pledging his allegiance to Islamic State. These dramatic developments came amid 
speculation Amri was still in Berlin after CCTV footage released by German 
broadcaster RBB appeared to show him outside a Berlin mosque the night after 
the attack. Investigators will now focus on what motivated the 24-year-old in 
the following days to return to Italy where he first arrived inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and spent time in prison. 
According to Milanese police, Amri arrived in the city at 1am on Friday having 
travelled via Turin and Chambéry in France.

Manhunt for new suspect

On Wednesday, a European arrest warrant was issued for a Tunisian man with 
alleged ties to Islamic extremists who was identified as a suspect in the 
attack.

Earlier, German media reported that police were searching for a Tunisian man 
after an identity card belonging to him was found under the driver’s seat of 
the truck. Checks were made in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, 
where the suspect had previously been registered at a refugee shelter.

Flats raided in Berlin and Dortmund

In the early hours of Thursday morning police targeted flats in Berlin’s 
Kreuzberg, Moabit and Prenzlauer Berg districts and a Dortmund apartment where 
truck attack suspect, Anis Amri, is thought to have temporarily stayed. A 
spokesperson for Germany’s state prosecutor said afterwards they were unaware 
of any arrests.

Germany’s interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, said later that fingerprints 
found in the cabin of the truck matched those of Amri, making it “highly 
probable” that the Tunisian suspect carried out the attack on the 
Breitscheidplatz Christmas market.

Amri’s movements

Germany’s security services are facing mounting pressure to explain how Amri 
could have been able to carry out Monday’s attack in spite of having been under 
covert surveillance for several months and known to multiple intelligence 
agencies for apparent ties to Islamic extremists.

The 24-year-old from Tatouine left Tunisia in early 2011 after the Arab Spring 
protests. After arriving by sea in Lampedusa he was involved in violent 
incidents at refugee centres and later spent time in several Sicily prisons. 
Amri reachedGermany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> in July 2015 
and shuttled between the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Berlin. His claim 
for asylum made in April was rejected by German authorities in consultation 
with security agencies.
