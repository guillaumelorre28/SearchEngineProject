Spanish police say they have arrested a British man wanted by UK authorities 
in a sexual abuse case against a minor that was first reported over 20 years 
ago.

The man was arrested Thursday in Alicante, southeast of Madrid.


Authorities say the man befriended the victimâ€™s father to approach the minor, 
whom he repeatedly abused at his home between October 1994 and the spring of 
1995.

Officials added the suspect abused another boy during those years, a friend of 
the victim. The suspect lured the second boy into his home with promises of 
alcohol and tobacco.

Newcastle <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/newcastle> courts have charged the 
suspect with eight counts of abuse against a 16-year-old minor.

He could face 10 years in prison if found guilty.
