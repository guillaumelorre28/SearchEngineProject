The Tigers have terminated Lodge’s contract “effective immediately”.

It is alleged Lodge followed the women into a unit after they were let into 
the building by a male resident, according to a New York police statement.

Lodge then allegedly assaulted the man and damaged the apartment, the police 
report said.

Lodge, who was holidaying in New York, was charged with criminal mischief, 
reckless endangerment, criminal trespass, assault and menacing.

It is the criminal mischief charge, a felony, that could put him in jail for a 
maximum four years.

“Felony is a felony,” NYPD officer Arlene Muniz told AAP. “You get a maximum 
for whatever the charge is for that felony.”

The criminal mischief charge relates to intentionally damaging someone else’s 
property.

Wests Tigers <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wests-tigers> chief executive 
Justin Pascoe said in a statement that the club would not tolerate Lodge’s 
behaviour.

“The club is incredibly disappointed to learn that Matthew Lodge has been 
charged by police while overseas on holiday,” Pascoe said.

“We have since made the decision to terminate Lodge’s playing contract with 
Wests Tigers, effective immediately.”

He said the club would continue to offer “welfare and counselling options” to 
Lodge.

In August Lodge was stood down by the Tigers over similar domestic violence 
allegations
