Summary

Who saw this one coming then? All the form pointed to a comfortable Real Madrid
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> win here, but after 
Wolfsburg endured a sticky opening 15 minutes, they executed their gameplan 
perfectly tonight. Playing without a traditional No9, the German side flooded 
midfield and hit Madrid on the counter-attack. The inclusion of Bruno Henrique, 
who hadn’t started a match for Wolfsburg before tonight was an inspired choice 
by manager Dieter Hecking, who deserved an awful lot of credit for 
masterminding this victory.

Bale aside, Real Madrid were awful. They had a penalty shout wrongly turned 
down but Benzema and Ronaldo missed golden chances at key moments of the game 
when the score was 0-0. Madrid scored their winner against Barcelona at the 
weekend with 10 men and to be honest, perhaps they would have been better it 
the full-backs, Marcelo and Danilo, stayed at home. They were both dreadful. To 
make matters worse, Benzema picked up an injury. Madrid have got to go 
full-throttle in the return leg, which may well suitWolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>, who will surely look to do 
the same: sit back, absorb pressure and hit Real on the counter-attack.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. See you next time. Bye!

Wolfsburg and Maximilian Arnold give Real Madrid a first-leg shock

89 min: It is a poor corner from Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>, and Real counter attack 
through Isco. Bale eventually gets the ball in, and he sends a lovely cross 
towards Jese on the penalty spot but Träsch, covering 60-70 yards to get back 
into position, heads the ball clear. Excellent commitment. Danilo could learn a 
thing or two there.

88 min: Chance for Kruse! The German gets to the byline on the left, cuts past 
Danilo (who has had an awful match) who half-trips Kruse. But the substitute 
stays on his feet inside the area, and tries to curl a shot into the roof of 
the net from a narrow angle. Navas is equal to it, palming it wide and the ball 
goes out for a corner.

86 min: Wolfsburg happy to play keep-ball, and they are doing a very good job 
of it too. I don’t think Real have touched the ball in two minutes, or so. 
Eventually Madrid win the ball back, Träsch deemed to have tripped Marcelo, who 
theatrically throws himself to the floor. He’s a thoroughly unlikeable chap, 
isn’t he?

“Marcelo must have learned from the best,” suggests Hauke Wemken.

80 min: Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> make their 
first change. It seems remarkable that they have played with the same 11 for 
the whole game. I would love to see the running stats. Remarkable fitness. 
Bruno Henrique is replaced by Christian Träsch, who slots in at right back. 
Vieirinha will move into midfield.

78 min: Bruno Henrique, arguably Wolfsburg’s best player on his first start 
for the club, first gets the better of Marcelo, then Ramos and looks to be 
bearing down on Navas, but Casemiro does exceptionally well to come across and 
snuff out the danger.

72 min: “Evening Michael, writes Simon McMahon. “If Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> can do this to Real, just 
imagine what Leicester will do to Barcelona next year. Unless of course Uefa 
have their way, in which case the likely English champions, not being one of 
the chosen clubs, will likely have to play 10 qualifying rounds just to get 
into the Europa League. Not that I’m cynical, of course.”

69 min: It’s all kicking off now, but for the wrong reasons. Marcelo, hang 
your head in shame. In an off-the-ball incident, Marcelo kicks out at Arnold, 
who responds by confronting the Real defender. Marcelo plants his head into the 
stomach of Arnold and then falls to the deck clutching his head, appealing to 
the linesman to send off Arnold.

66 min: Golden chance for Schurrle! Ohhhhh, he should have scored. 
Unsurprisingly Real are undone by a counter-attack, Bruno Henrique bounding 
forward on the left, switching the play to Schurrle, who took one touch and 
blasted the ball over the bar from eight yards out. What a chance.

“Those chants have been swapped for something like “Olé, olé” now,” informs

60 min: Ronaldo goes down in a heap under a challenge from Luis Gustavo. 
Ronaldo is incensed! He points to a hole halfway up his sock, screaming at the 
referee to book the Brazilian. Gianluca Rocchi obliges. Replays show that after 
an initial trip, Gustavo landed on the shin of Ronaldo. Accidentally I might 
add. Ronaldo lines up the free kick, exhales, and blasts his set piece over the 
bar. I would love to know the percentage of free kicks that Ronaldo scores. 
He’s no Payet, that’s for sure.
Jamie Gordon (@jamiegordon21) 
@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18> Ronaldo, seeing as you 
asked, as of late last year, had only scored 2/89 free kicks. [1]

56 min: Bale is again Madrid’s creator in chief, his cross finding Ronaldo at 
the back post, but Rodriguez does just enough to put him off and Ronaldo can 
only head over. From the ensuing goal kick, Benaglio is booked for 
time-wasting. It is increasingly becoming attack versus defence.

53 min: Ronaldo is becoming increasingly frustrated out there. Guilavogui, the 
French international on loan from Atlético Madrid, is doing an outstanding job 
of screening Wolfsburg’s back four and outmuscles the Portuguese on the edge of 
the home penalty area.

I’ve been told by a number of you that Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> is in Lower Saxony, not Saxony 
as I mentioned a little while earlier. Please accept my sincerest apologies.

51 min: “I have a feeling that with all their quality, Madrid will pull a 
Bayern,” emails Joseph Lam. “They will have the confidence, beating Barcelona 
at the Camp Nou with 10 men.”

Yep, I’m inclined to agree with you Joseph, even with the score at 2-0. Real 
just need to score one away goal, and suddenly the whole complexion of the tie 
changes.

48 min: Bale starts the second half as he ended the first, giving Vieirinha a 
torrid time on Wolfsburg’s right. Bale drives to the byline cuts the ball back 
to Ronaldo, but Real’s No7 slips just as he’s shooting, and the ball squirms 
harmlessly wide.

47 min: Real force an early corner, taken by Kroos, headed away by Dante. 
First Marcelo tries his luck, blocked by Vieirinha, then after a short period 
of play, Kroos fires a long-range effort well over the bar.

Half-time: Wolfsburg 2-0 Real Madrid

What a half for Wolfsburg. They have played brilliantly going forward but are 
perhaps lucky thatReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
have not been more ruthless at the other end.

It is also worth noting that Rodriguez’s penalty was the first goal that 
Keylor Navas has conceded in 738 minutes ofChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> football this season. 
The Costa Rican needed 115 minutes to beat Jens Lehmann’s record of 853 minutes.

44 min: The slightest of pushes from Naldo on Jese allows the Spaniard to win 
a free kick for Real right on the edge of Wolfsburg’s box. Both Ronaldo and 
Bale are over it, the latter stepping up to it … but curls his effort over the 
wall and over the bar, before swearing very visibly in English.

Who saw this one coming then? All the form pointed to a comfortable Real Madrid
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> win here, but after 
Wolfsburg endured a sticky opening 15 minutes, they executed their gameplan 
perfectly tonight. Playing without a traditional No9, the German side flooded 
midfield and hit Madrid on the counter-attack. The inclusion of Bruno Henrique, 
who hadn’t started a match for Wolfsburg before tonight was an inspired choice 
by manager Dieter Hecking, who deserved an awful lot of credit for 
masterminding this victory.

Bale aside, Real Madrid were awful. They had a penalty shout wrongly turned 
down but Benzema and Ronaldo missed golden chances at key moments of the game 
when the score was 0-0. Madrid scored their winner against Barcelona at the 
weekend with 10 men and to be honest, perhaps they would have been better it 
the full-backs, Marcelo and Danilo, stayed at home. They were both dreadful. To 
make matters worse, Benzema picked up an injury. Madrid have got to go 
full-throttle in the return leg, which may well suitWolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>, who will surely look to do 
the same: sit back, absorb pressure and hit Real on the counter-attack.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. See you next time. Bye!

What a result!
 
90 min+2: Real have resorted to lumping the ball forward, which will suit the 
6ft6in Naldo and the 6ft3in Dante absolutely fine. Zidane, Ronaldo and co look 
devoid of ideas.

90 min: Four minutes added on here. Ronaldo haven’t had a clear cut chance 
since Ronaldo’s effort 16 minutes ago.Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> well worthy of this 2-0 result.
 
89 min: It is a poor corner from Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>, and Real counter attack 
through Isco. Bale eventually gets the ball in, and he sends a lovely cross 
towards Jese on the penalty spot but Träsch, covering 60-70 yards to get back 
into position, heads the ball clear. Excellent commitment. Danilo could learn a 
thing or two there.
 
88 min: Chance for Kruse! The German gets to the byline on the left, cuts past 
Danilo (who has had an awful match) who half-trips Kruse. But the substitute 
stays on his feet inside the area, and tries to curl a shot into the roof of 
the net from a narrow angle. Navas is equal to it, palming it wide and the ball 
goes out for a corner.
 
86 min: Wolfsburg happy to play keep-ball, and they are doing a very good job 
of it too. I don’t think Real have touched the ball in two minutes, or so. 
Eventually Madrid win the ball back, Träsch deemed to have tripped Marcelo, who 
theatrically throws himself to the floor. He’s a thoroughly unlikeable chap, 
isn’t he?

“Marcelo must have learned from the best,” suggests Hauke Wemken.
 
84 min: Wolfsburg make their second change: Schurrle off for Kruse. The former 
Chelsea man has played well tonight but willWolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> regret that miss just after 
the hour mark?
 
82 min: There’s a streaker on the pitch. Well, he’s not really a streaker, 
he’s fully clothed. But he makes it the full width of the pitch before being 
rugby tackled to the ground.

80 min: Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> make their 
first change. It seems remarkable that they have played with the same 11 for 
the whole game. I would love to see the running stats. Remarkable fitness. 
Bruno Henrique is replaced by Christian Träsch, who slots in at right back. 
Vieirinha will move into midfield.
 
78 min: Bruno Henrique, arguably Wolfsburg’s best player on his first start 
for the club, first gets the better of Marcelo, then Ramos and looks to be 
bearing down on Navas, but Casemiro does exceptionally well to come across and 
snuff out the danger.
 
76 min: Luis Gustavo is struggling a bit, look like he took a bit of knock. 
Hecking will be hoping he is OK to continue, the Brazilian has been immense 
alongside Guilavogui tonight.
 
74 min: Another chance for Ronaldo, another fantastic save from Benaglio. Isco 
threads a beautiful ball through the eye of the needle to release Ronnie, but 
he’s forced a bit wide, and his shot is deflected by Benaglio’s foot.Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> doing enough here, not 
allowing Real to score an away goal is so crucial for their chances of success 
in the Bernebéu.

72 min: “Evening Michael, writes Simon McMahon. “If Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> can do this to Real, just 
imagine what Leicester will do to Barcelona next year. Unless of course Uefa 
have their way, in which case the likely English champions, not being one of 
the chosen clubs, will likely have to play 10 qualifying rounds just to get 
into the Europa League. Not that I’m cynical, of course.”
 
69 min: It’s all kicking off now, but for the wrong reasons. Marcelo, hang 
your head in shame. In an off-the-ball incident, Marcelo kicks out at Arnold, 
who responds by confronting the Real defender. Marcelo plants his head into the 
stomach of Arnold and then falls to the deck clutching his head, appealing to 
the linesman to send off Arnold.

Embarrassing. Comically, so. Slapstick comedy at its worst. Bale and Arnold 
are booked for their part in handbags in the ensuing fracas.

66 min: Golden chance for Schurrle! Ohhhhh, he should have scored. 
Unsurprisingly Real are undone by a counter-attack, Bruno Henrique bounding 
forward on the left, switching the play to Schurrle, who took one touch and 
blasted the ball over the bar from eight yards out. What a chance.

64 min: Nick Tjaardstra on the email: “Sadly the Wolfsburg chants are not very 
exciting. ‘Auf gehts Wolfsburg schießt ein Tor’ - for example. Loosely ‘Go on
Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> score a goal’”

“Those chants have been swapped for something like “Olé, olé” now,” informs 
Oliver Driesen.

“You’re getting sacked in the morning!” suggests Mark Readdie.
 
62 min: Modric is withdrawn for Isco. The Croatian is so often Real’s best 
player, but he has been completely anonymous tonight. I think that’s the first 
time I’ve typed his name since kick-off.
 
60 min: Ronaldo goes down in a heap under a challenge from Luis Gustavo. 
Ronaldo is incensed! He points to a hole halfway up his sock, screaming at the 
referee to book the Brazilian. Gianluca Rocchi obliges. Replays show that after 
an initial trip, Gustavo landed on the shin of Ronaldo. Accidentally I might 
add. Ronaldo lines up the free kick, exhales, and blasts his set piece over the 
bar. I would love to know the percentage of free kicks that Ronaldo scores. 
He’s no Payet, that’s for sure.

@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18> Ronaldo, seeing as you 
asked, as of late last year, had only scored 2/89 free kicks. [1]

58 min: PSG have taken the lead against Manchester City. More here … 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/apr/06/psg-manchester-city-champions-league-live>
 
56 min: Bale is again Madrid’s creator in chief, his cross finding Ronaldo at 
the back post, but Rodriguez does just enough to put him off and Ronaldo can 
only head over. From the ensuing goal kick, Benaglio is booked for 
time-wasting. It is increasingly becoming attack versus defence.
 
54 min: Draxler finds some space on the left, cuts back inside and whips a 
dipping cross to the back post, which just evades Bruno Henrique’s run.
 
53 min: Ronaldo is becoming increasingly frustrated out there. Guilavogui, the 
French international on loan from Atlético Madrid, is doing an outstanding job 
of screening Wolfsburg’s back four and outmuscles the Portuguese on the edge of 
the home penalty area.

I’ve been told by a number of you that Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> is in Lower Saxony, not Saxony 
as I mentioned a little while earlier. Please accept my sincerest apologies.
 
51 min: “I have a feeling that with all their quality, Madrid will pull a 
Bayern,” emails Joseph Lam. “They will have the confidence, beating Barcelona 
at the Camp Nou with 10 men.”

Yep, I’m inclined to agree with you Joseph, even with the score at 2-0. Real 
just need to score one away goal, and suddenly the whole complexion of the tie 
changes.
 
49 min: Second slip in two minutes for Ronaldo, just as the Portuguese was 
shaping to shoot. Somebody should really have a word with his boot 
manufacturers about that, whoever they are.
 
48 min: Bale starts the second half as he ended the first, giving Vieirinha a 
torrid time on Wolfsburg’s right. Bale drives to the byline cuts the ball back 
to Ronaldo, but Real’s No7 slips just as he’s shooting, and the ball squirms 
harmlessly wide.

47 min: Real force an early corner, taken by Kroos, headed away by Dante. 
First Marcelo tries his luck, blocked by Vieirinha, then after a short period 
of play, Kroos fires a long-range effort well over the bar.
 
46 min: It is worth mentioning that the atmosphere inside the Volkswagon Arena 
is absolutely brilliant. Struggling to work out what the home crowd are 
actually singing about,Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> fans: are there any 
(translated) chants we should know about?
 
Peeeeep! We’re underway again in Lower Saxony. 
 
“38% possession but Wolfsburg know what to do with it,” emails Hauke Wemken. 
“Real are not being outplayed butWolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> looks prepared, they are 
winning the ball back regularly.”

It’s currently 1-1. Former Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> man Kevin De Bruyne fired City 
into a lead but a horrible defensive mix up allowed Zlatan Ibrahimovic to level 
the scores.
 
What a half for Wolfsburg. They have played brilliantly going forward but are 
perhaps lucky thatReal Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
have not been more ruthless at the other end.

It is also worth noting that Rodriguez’s penalty was the first goal that 
Keylor Navas has conceded in 738 minutes ofChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> football this season. 
The Costa Rican needed 115 minutes to beat Jens Lehmann’s record of 853 minutes.
 
45 min: One minute added on for injury time. 
 
44 min: The slightest of pushes from Naldo on Jese allows the Spaniard to win 
a free kick for Real right on the edge of Wolfsburg’s box. Both Ronaldo and 
Bale are over it, the latter stepping up to it … but curls his effort over the 
wall and over the bar, before swearing very visibly in English.

42 min: Bruno Henrique shows Marcelo a clean set of heels, but no other 
Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> player can keep up 
with the rapid Brazilian, and his cross is cut out by Pepe.
