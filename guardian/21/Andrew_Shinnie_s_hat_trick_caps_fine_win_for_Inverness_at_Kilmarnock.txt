Andrew Shinnie scored a hat-trick as the Scottish Premier League's bottom club 
Inverness secured their first away win of the season in spectacular fashion, 
beatingKilmarnock 6-3.

Caley Thistle seemed destined to suffer a familiar hard-luck story after Dean 
Shiels scored an early opener in a rare moment of class from the home side but 
Shinnie levelled just before the break and completed a four-goal spree from the 
visitors in 13 second-half minutes.

Jonny Hayes had put Inverness in front with a brilliant strike on his return 
to the starting lineup while Gregory Tade twice exposed a disorganised home 
defence. The hosts pulled goals back through Shiels and Paul Heffernan.

Shiels converted from the penalty spot in the 73rd minute after Kenny Gillet 
had brought down James Dayton but Inverness continued to dominate and threaten.

Tade completed the rout in the 83rd minute when he shot home with his left 
foot after a reverse pass from Shinnie left him in yards of space on the edge 
of the box.

Heffernan got another consolation in the closing seconds with Ryan Esson 
unable to stop his low shot.

The Hearts goalkeeper Marian Kello made four crucial saves to keep St Mirren 
at bay atSt Mirren <https://www.theguardian.com/football/stmirren> Park, but 
the home side needed the help of the woodwork late on to ensure a 0-0 draw.

Kello made his best save of the day when he tipped a close-range drive from 
the substitute Nigel Hasselbaink over the bar before a late effort by theHearts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hearts> substitute David Obua hit the 
inside of the post before rebounding clear.

Dunfermline drew level with their opponents Hibernian in the SPL table after 
Austin McCann's early goal at Easter Road.

McCann, the former Hearts defender, scored his first goal for more than 100 
appearances after three minutes. Hibs were then unable to beat an inspired Paul 
Gallacher in the Pars' goal.
