Our take on bloody mary gets its kick from chilli and mustard. Serves one.

150ml tomato juice 
10ml ground kasundi (mustard seeds)
1 green chilli, cut in half lengthways
10ml fresh lime juice, plus extra for dipping the rim of the glass in
50ml vodka (Absolut or Grey Goose)
¼ tsp each fine sea salt and ground black pepper
1 celery stick, to garnish

Put the tomato juice, kasundi and a half-chilli in a shaker, add ice and shake 
hard. Add the lime and vodka, and shake again. Dip a cocktail glass in lime 
juice, then in the seasoning mix, fill with the drink, and garnish with the 
celery and remaining chilli.
