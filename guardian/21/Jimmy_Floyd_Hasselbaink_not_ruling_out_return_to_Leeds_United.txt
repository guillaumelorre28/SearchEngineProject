Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has not ruled out a move to Leeds United at the end of 
the season but has said he is committed to his current job atBurton Albion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/burton-albion>.

Neil Redfearn’s future at Elland Road has long been uncertain, and 
Hasselbaink’s ties to the Yorkshire side from his playing days have seen him 
linked with the job after a successful season at Burton.

Hasselbaink’s agent Humphrey Nijman told the Yorkshire Evening Post 
<http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/hasselbaink-link-to-leeds-casts-a-shadow-over-redfearn-1-7231778>
: “They have showed interest, but there is nothing decided yet. That is all I 
can say about it.”

However, the Leeds United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leedsunited> 
owner Massimo Cellino dismissed the comments, saying: “It’s just more talk. 
Forget it.”

The Brewers have secured automatic promotion to League One

the Dutchman and he told the Burton Mail: “It’s football, isn’t it? I can’t do 
anything about speculation.

“One thing I can say is I’m committed to Burton and I will do everything in my 
power, as long as I’m here, to be as successful as possible.”

He added: “Leeds is a very beautiful club that I played for for two years. 
I’ve got lots of friends there. But it’s difficult for me to talk about it 
because they have got a good manager who has done really well.

“I’ve got a job here that I really like, so for me it’s not nice to talk about 
these kind of things. I’ll make decisions for myself with my head and not my 
heart. It’s difficult but you have to make decisions with your head. I’ve got 
two more years on my contract at Burton and it’s my job.”
