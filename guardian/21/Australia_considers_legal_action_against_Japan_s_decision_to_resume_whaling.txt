The Turnbull government is considering legal action in response to Japan’s 
decision to resume whaling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/29/japan-to-resume-whaling-programme>
in the Southern Ocean this summer.


The government says it is exploring options for further legal action and has 
joined 32 nations protesting the decision in a bid to build international 
consensus against Japanese whaling.


“The Australian government does not support what is a deeply disappointing 
decision byJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> and we will continue 
to raise our concerns at the highest level of the Japanese government,” the 
foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, and the environment minister, Greg 
Hunt, said in a statement on Monday.


Australia’s concerns were raised in a demarche, or joint letter, with New 
Zealand and European Union members.


The demarche conveys “serious concerns” regarding Japan’s decision to resume 
whaling in the Southern Ocean in the 2015/16 season under what Japan calls its 
New Scientific Research Whale Program.
