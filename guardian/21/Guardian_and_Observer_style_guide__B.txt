BAA
formerly the British Airports Authority

Ba’ath party
it means renaissance or resurrection

Babybel
cheese

baby Bells
US regional telephone companies formed after the breakup of AT&T in 1984

baby boomer

Babygro
TM; a generic alternative is babygrow

Baby P
Peter Connelly, who died in Haringey in 2007, was known as Baby P or Baby Peter

babysit, babysitter
the noun “baby-sitter” came first (in 1937), and the verb “to baby-sit” was 
derived from it a decade later, an interesting example of back-formation

baccalaureate
abbreviation bac, but the new English baccalaureate is abbreviated to Ebacc

bacchanalia
originally wild festivals dedicated to the god Bacchus; now drunken revelry as 
found in most British towns on a Saturday night, lowercase with singular verb: 
the bacchanalia is likely to continue until we all pass out

Bacharach, Burt
US songwriter, born 1928

bachelor
now has a slightly old-fashioned ring to it, so probably better to say (if 
relevant) unmarried man; “confirmed bachelor” should definitely be avoided, as 
should “bachelor girl” (unless writing about swinging 60s movies)

backbench
newspaper or politics; backbenches, backbenchers

back catalogue, back yard

back-scratching

backstory, backstreet

bacteria
plural of bacterium, so don’t write “the bacteria is”; even more important,

band names
lc the: the Beatles, the Killers, the The; but uc equivalents in other 
languages, eg Les Négresses Vertes, Los Lobos. Bands that do not take the 
definite article (although they are often erroneously given it) include Arctic 
Monkeys, Pet Shop Boys and Ramones; for most bands, this can be easily checked 
online.

Bands take a plural verb: Snow Patrol are overrated, Iron Butterfly were the 
loudest band of the 60s, etc.

Try to include diacritical marks if bands use them in their name, no matter 
how absurd: Maxïmo Park, Mötley Crüe, Motörhead, etc; for a comprehensive list 
see the excellent “metal umlaut” entry on Wikipedia 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_umlaut>

avoided

be-all and end-all

bearing children
Such phrases as “she bore him two sons” and “he had two children by” are 
outdated and sexist. We said of Wendi Deng that she “went on to bear [Rupert 
Murdoch] two children”. As a reader complained: “Surely an expression which 
implies that a woman has a child for a man has no place in the Guardian ... How 
about ‘they had two children’?”

We also said that the late David Frost had “three sons by Carina 
Fitzalan-Howard” and referred to Mick Jagger’s “two sons by Jerry Hall”, as if 
the mothers were racehorses. Men have children with, not by, women

beau
plural beaux

Beaufort scale
measure of wind speed created in 1806 by Sir Francis Beaufort.

There are 13 classes, as follows: 0 calm, 1 light air, 2 light breeze, 3 
gentle breeze, 4 moderate breeze, 5 fresh breeze, 6 strong breeze, 7 near gale, 
8 gale, 9 strong gale, 10 storm, 11 violent storm, 12 hurricane.

Beaver scouts
for boys (and now girls) aged six to eight, when they are eligible to become 
Cub scouts

bebop, hard bop, post-bop
jazz genres

Be-Bop-A-Lula
Gene Vincent song

because
can be ambiguous: “I didn’t go to the party because Mary was there” may mean 
that Mary’s presence dissuaded me from going or that I went to sample the 
canapés

Becket, Thomas (1118-70)
murdered archbishop of Canterbury, not “Thomas à Becket”

becquerel
the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays 
in a second; the time measurement is included, so it is wrong to say 
“becquerels per hour”

bedblockers, bedblocking
terms best avoided, unless quoting someone, because as one of our readers put 
it: “This neoliberal language dehumanises people to commodities and treats them 
as a transactional contract, rather than humans”

Bedouin

bedroom tax
no need for “so-called” or quotation marks – it’s the bedroom tax. Belated 
attempts by the government to call it the “abolition of the spare room subsidy” 
should be treated with the contempt they deserve

beef wellington

Beeton, Mrs
(Isabella Mary Beeton, 1836-65) author of The Book of Household Management

begs the question
This phrase is almost invariably misused: it means assuming a proposition 
that, in reality, involves the conclusion. An example would be to say that 
parallel lines will never meet, because they are parallel.

The concept can be traced as far back as Aristotle, but HW Fowler, whose entry 
on begging the question is listed under the Latinpetitio principii (assumption 
of the basis), defines it as “the fallacy of founding a conclusion on a basis 
that as much needs to be proved as the conclusion itself”, giving as an example 
“foxhunting is not cruel, since the fox enjoys the fun”.

Now used widely to mean “raises the question”, its traditional sense is being 
lost, which seems a sad fate for a phrase that might be useful or even – in a 
logical or philosophical context – essential

Beijing

Belarus
adjective Belarusian

beleaguered
overused, even when we spell it correctly

believable

Belisha beacons
flashing orange lamps on black and white poles at zebra crossings, named after 
Leslie Hore-Belisha, the minister of transport who introduced them in 1934; 
have given way in many cases topelican crossings (little red and green men)

bell-end

bellringing, bellringers
no hyphens

Bell’s whisky

bellwether
sheep that leads the herd; customarily misspelt, misused, or both

benefactor, beneficiary
are sometimes confused: the former gives something; the latter gets it

benefited, benefiting

“benefits tourism”
and similar contentious phrases should normally be used only when quoting 
someone, rather than suggesting that we accept them at face value

Benetton

Berchtesgaden

Beretta
Italian firearms manufacturer; biretta square cap worn by Roman Catholic 
clerics, black (priest), purple (bishop), red (cardinal)

berks and wankers
Kingsley Amis identified two principal groups in debates over use of language: 
“Berks are careless, coarse, crass, gross and of what anybody would agree is a 
lower social class than one’s own; wankers are prissy, fussy, priggish, prim 
and of what they would probably misrepresent as a higher social class than 
one’s own”

Berliner
newspaper format, narrower and shorter than a broadsheet, taller and wider 
than a tabloid; the Guardian switched to Berliner format on 12 September 2005

Berlin Wall

Bermuda
the adjective is Bermudian (not Bermudan) and its citizens are Bermudians

Bernabéu stadium
the home of Real Madrid

Berne
not Bern

berserk
not beserk

Berwick-upon-Tweed
is in England, although Berwick Rangers play football in the Scottish League

bestseller, bestselling

Betaferon
TM; the generic term for the drug is interferon-beta 1b

bete noire
no accents

betting odds
We frequently get this wrong. A brief explanation: long odds (eg 100-1 
against, normally expressed as 100-1) mean something unlikely; shorter odds (eg 
10-1) still mean it’s unlikely, but less unlikely; odds on (eg 2-1 on, 
sometimes expressed as 1-2) means it is likely, so if you were betting £2 you 
would win only £1 plus the stake.

Take care using the phrase “odds on”: if Labour is quoted by bookmakers at 3-1 
to win a byelection, and the odds are cut to 2-1, it is wrong to say “the odds 
on Labour to win were cut last night” – in fact, the odds against Labour to win 
have been cut (the shorter the price, the more likely something is expected to 
happen).

It gets more complicated when something is genuinely odds-on, ie bookmakers 
quote a price of “2-1 on”: in this case, if the Labour candidate is quoted at 
2-1 on and becomes an even hotter favourite, at 3-1 on, the odds have 
shortened; if Labour loses popularity, and 2-1 on becomes, say, 7-4 on or 
evens, the odds have lengthened

between 15 and 20
not “between 15 to 20” or “between 15-20”

Bevan, Aneurin
(1897-1960) Labour health minister from 1945 to 1951 and architect of the NHS. 
Also known as Nye Bevan. In a 1948 speech he described Tories as “lower than 
vermin”

Beverly Hills

Bevin, Ernest
(1881-1951) Labour foreign secretary between 1945 and 1951 who helped to 
create Nato. Not to be confused with Nye Bevan

Beyoncé

beyond the pale
not pail; this pale is derived from the Latin palus, a stake as used to 
support a fence (cf palisade); hence the figurative meaning of beyond the pale 
as being outside the boundary, unacceptable

biannual or biennial?
As no one can agree which of these means twice a year, and which means every 
two years, it’s best not to use them at all; “twice a year” or “every two 
years” are unambiguous.

The same applies to bimonthly and biweekly: say “every fortnight”, “twice a 
month” or “every two months”, and so on. It’s remarkable that no one has sorted 
this problem out; nearly a century ago, HW Fowler was already calling it “a 
cause of endless confusion”

bias, biased

Bible
cap up if referring to Old or New Testament, lc in such sentences as “the 
stylebook is my bible”; the adjective biblical is always lc

Bible belt

biblical quotations
Use a modern translation, not the Authorised Version. From a reader: 
“Peradventure the editor hath no copy of Holy Writ in the office, save the King 
James Version only. Howbeit the great multitude of believers knoweth this 
translation not. And he (or she) who quoteth the words of Jesus in ancient 
form, sheweth plainly that he (or she) considereth them to be out of date. 
Wherefore let them be quoted in such manner that the people may understand”

biblical references
like this: Genesis 1:1; II Corinthians 2:13; Revelation 3:16 (anyone calling 
it “Revelations” will burn in hell for eternity)

bicentenary
a 200th anniversary; bicentennial its adjective

biceps
singular and plural (there is no such thing as a bicep)

bid
Use only in a financial or sporting sense, eg Royal Bank of Scotland’s 
disastrous bid for ABN Amro, Barcelona have put in a bid for Rooney, etc; or 
when writing about an auction. Say in an attempt to, in an effort to, rather 
than “in a bid to”; in headlines, move is a useful alternative

big
usually preferable to major, massive, giant, mammoth, behemoth, etc

big bang
lowercase, whether you are talking about the origin of the universe, around 14 
billion years ago, or deregulation of the City of London in 1986

‘big society’
A project briefly championed by David Cameron and described by the late Simon 
Hoggart as “surely the vaguest slogan ever coined by a political leader. Nobody 
knows what it means.” Use quotation marks on first mention

bill
lc, even when giving full name; cap up only if it becomes an act

billion
one thousand million: in copy use bn for sums of money, quantities or 
inanimate objects: £10bn, 1bn litres of water; otherwise billion: 6 billion 
people, etc; use bn in headlines

bin Laden, Osama
Bin Laden on second reference. He had been stripped of his Saudi citizenship, 
so can be described as Saudi-born but not as a Saudi

biodegradable, bioengineering, bioethics, biofuel
but bio-based economy, bio-products

Birds Eye
TM; two words, no apostrophe, named after the frozen food pioneer Clarence 
Frank Birdseye II (1886-1956)

birdwatchers
also known as birders, not “twitchers”; they go birdwatching or birding, not 
“twitching”

Birkbeck, University of London
comma, but no “college”

Biro
TM; say ballpoint pen

birthdays
are for people. Institutions, events etc have anniversaries

birthplace, birthrate, birthright

Birtwistle, Sir Harrison
British composer, born 1934 (not Birtwhistle)

bishops
the Right Rev Clifford Richard, bishop of Wimbledon, at first mention; 
thereafter just Richard or the bishop

bismillah
means “in the name of God” in Arabic

bitcoin

bite-size
not bite-sized; very few things are the same size as a bite

bitterest
use of this word by the Guardian in 2006 provoked a bitter controversy  
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/nov/13/comment.media>among 
readers, many of whom (rightly) pointed out that there is nothing wrong with it

black
should be used only as an adjective when referring to race, ie not “blacks” 
but “black people” or whatever noun is appropriate

blackberry
fruit; plural blackberries

BlackBerry
handheld wireless email device; plural BlackBerrys

black cab-driver
a black person who drives a cab

black-cab driver
a person who drives a black cab

Black Country

black economy
hidden or parallel economy are preferable

black-on-black violence
is banned, unless in a quote, but even then treat with scepticism (imagine the 
police saying they were “investigating an incident of white-on-white violence 
between Millwall and West Ham supporters”)

blackout

Blackpool Pleasure Beach
a giant funfair, not a beach, so do not illustrate with a picture of donkeys 
on the sand

Blade Runner
not Bladerunner

Blair/Booth, Cherie
is Cherie Blair when we are referring to her in her capacity as the wife of 
the former prime minister; if she is appearing in court or at a function 
related to her work as a lawyer, she is Cherie Booth QC (Booth on second 
mention)

Blanchett, Cate

blase
no accent

blastfurnace

bleeper
pager; not to be confused with beeper, a thing that goes “beep” (eg on a 
microwave)

blitz
as in the London blitz of 1940-41, and various other blitzes (eg Liverpool, 
Sheffield); an abbreviation of Blitzkrieg (German for “lightning war”)

blog
(noun) collection of online articles, blogpost single article; (verb) action 
of publishing a blogpost: “I just blogged about that”

blokeish
rather than blokish

blond
is the adjective, male and female: John has blond hair, and Jane’s hair is 
also blond.

As nouns, blond is male (John is a blond) and blonde is female (Jane is a 
blonde), but they sound old-fashioned and sexist nowadays (“Gentlemen Prefer 
Blondes”) so it’s best to say simply that someone is blond

blood bank

bloodsports

bloody mary
vodka and tomato juice

Bloody Sunday
Take care when writing about the death toll: 13 died in Derry on 30 January 
1972, but a 14th victim died from a brain tumour several months later, so we 
should use a phrase such as “which led to 14 deaths”

blowjob

Bluffer’s Guide
TM; beware of using phrases such as “a bluffer’s guide to crimewriting”, a 
headline that led to a legal complaint

blunder
one (of many) mentions of this word led to the following comment from a 
reader: “The term ‘blunder’ is used most frequently when referring to mistakes 
made in public services and this only serves to fuel the view commonly 
propagated by rightwing newspapers that the role of the public sector should be 
diminished and its functions handed over to private companies. I’m sure the 
Guardian does not endorse this view, but its use of language may imply that it 
does”

Blu-ray
TM; full name is Blu-ray Disc (not Disk), abbreviation BD

Blu-Tack
TM

BME
black and minority ethnic; BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) is a less 
widely used but acceptable alternative

Boat Race
Oxford v Cambridge

Boddingtons
popularly known as Boddies, it remains the cream of Manchester, despite the 
closure of the Strangeways brewery

bodge or botch?
To botch a job is to make a mess of it; to bodge means something very similar, 
but with the added sense that you botched it by trying to cut corners or save 
money – think of the Bodgers and their novelty 1976 single, (Don’t Do It Right) 
Bodge It!


Bodø
town in Norway, just inside the Arctic Circle


bodybuilder, bodybuilding

describe part of the body

bogey
golf, ghost, so bogeyman

bogie

Bogotá

Bolivar, Simón Bolivar, Simon Bolívar, or Simón Bólivar - all of which appeared 
in the paper in the space of a year

bolognese

bolshie

Bombay

bon vivant
not bon viveur

bookcase, bookkeeper, bookseller, bookshelf

book titles
are not italicised, except in the Guardian’s Review section and the Observer; 
lc for a, an, and, at, for, from, in, of, the, to (unless they are the first 
word of the title): Pride and Prejudice, The Mill on the Floss, etc

bordeaux
wine from Bordeaux

bored with, bored by
are preferable to bored of, although usage seems to be changing, particularly 
among younger people.

The distinction can, however, be useful: compare “bored with Tunbridge Wells” 
(a person who finds Tunbridge Wells boring) and “bored of Tunbridge Wells” (a 
bored person who happens to live there, perhaps a neighbour of “disgusted of 
Tunbridge Wells”)

Boris
Some people (Arnie, Maggie, Iggy) have forenames that make them instantly 
recognisable, and Boris Johnson is one. This makes his name tempting for 
headline writers. Fine in its place, on (say) a sketch or colour piece, but use 
sparingly and with due regard to tone; in web stories, we should normally use 
his full name


born out
of necessity; borne out by the facts; borne back ceaselessly into the past

borstals
named after a village in Kent, these institutions were replaced by youth 
custody centres in 1982, four years after being immortalised by the Sham 69 
single Borstal Breakout

borscht

Bosnia-Herzegovina
for the former Yugoslav republic, not Hercegovina

Bosphorus
not Bosporus

Boston Strangler

both
unnecessary in most phrases that contain “and”; “both men and women” says no 
more than “men and women”, takes longer, and can also be ambiguous

Botox
a brand name; botulinum toxin is normally more appropriate in copy, although 
we recognise that the temptation for headline writers to say “Never mind the 
Botox” may sometimes prove irresistible

Botswana
country; Tswana people and language

bottleneck

Boudicca
not Boadicea

bougainvillaea

bouncebackability
invaluable word coined by the football manager Iain Dowie and since, thanks to 
the wonders of Twitter, translated by Guardian Style followers into French (la 
rebondissabilité) and German (die Rücksprungsfähigkeit)

Boundary Commission

Republic it is known as St Stephen’s Day, and in South Africa as the Day of 
Goodwill

box office, box set

boy
male under 18

boyband, boyfriend

Boy’s Own

brackets
If the sentence is logically and grammatically complete without the 
information contained within the parentheses (round brackets), the punctuation 
stays outside the brackets. (A complete sentence that stands alone in 
parentheses starts with a capital letter and ends with a stop.)

“Square brackets,” the grammarian said, “are used in direct quotes when an 
interpolation [a note from the writer or editor, not uttered by the speaker] is 
added to provide essential information.”

Use brackets sparingly, particularly square ones: it’s not necessary to add 
[David] in a football story when an interviewee refers to “Beckham”

FC

Brighton and Hove
a city and unitary council since 2000, and no longer in East Sussex

brilliant
“a word applied indiscriminately by the Guardian to anything new, no matter 
how ordinary” (2010 tweet from a reader)

brinkmanship
rather than brinksmanship

Brink’s-Mat

Britain, UK
These terms are synonymous: Britain is the official short form of United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Used as adjectives, therefore, 
British and UK mean the same. Great Britain, however, refers only to England, 
Wales and Scotland. Take care not to write Britain when you might mean England 
and Wales, or just England – for example when referring to the education system.

British Isles
A geographical term taken to mean Great Britain, Ireland and some or all of

Alternatives adopted by some publications are British and Irish Isles or simply 
Britain and Ireland

British Medical Association

British overseas territories
Parts of the former British empire that remain under the jurisdiction and 
sovereignty of the UK, though not part of it. Until 1983, they were known as

Antarctic Territory; British Indian Ocean Territory; British Virgin Islands;
