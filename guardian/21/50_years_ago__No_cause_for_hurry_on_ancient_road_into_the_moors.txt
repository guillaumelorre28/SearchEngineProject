You can have a very good walk across upland Cardiganshire eastwards from the 
source-lakes of the Teifi River. It is all a strangely broken, hummocky, ridged 
and rocky country in which these quiet lakes lie. Then the track goes away into 
the moors, wandering round every little rise as if it lacked all ambition. But 
no matter. There is no cause for hurry on such a road. It goes nowhere in 
particular for its day is over. There are no longer any cattle to go along it 
to Barnet Fair; and the Cistercian abbeys it once connected (Strata Florida and 
Cyrnhir) have been long centuries in ruins.

Today if you care to follow this track you are pretty sure to be led to 
Birmingham Corporationâ€™s Claerwen reservoir. For it is only too easy to miss 
the ancient road which steals slyly away to the north-east, losing itself in 
wide and tussocky bogs but re-finding itself where it climbs the farther 
slopes. Whichever way you go you will traverse one of the finest, emptiest 
sweeps of high-placed grassland in all Wales with, miraculously, not a conifer 
in sight. Miraculously, did I say? Alas no, it is no miracle. I fear it is 
merely that a vast area thereabouts is common land and so cannot yet be 
afforested. But the laws that are now threatening to revolutionise commons 
rights will change all that and will be a death-blow to many a lovely open 
stretch of moorland.
