This is essentially a classic bramble (mirtilo is Portuguese for blueberry), 
but the cachaça, a spirit made from sugarcane, gives it a nifty 
caipirinha-style twist. Serves one.

1 lime, juiced, plus a twist to garnish (keep the juiced lime shell)
50ml cachaça
15ml sugar syrup
Blueberry liqueur, to finish (Lejay <http://lejay-lagoute.com> is a good brand)
1 small handful fresh blueberries

Muddle the lime shell in the base of a shaker, add the lime juice, cachaça and 
sugar syrup, and shake hard. Strain into a rocks glass filled with crushed ice, 
drizzle a little blueberry liqueur, garnish with a twist of lime and a few 
blueberries, and serve.
