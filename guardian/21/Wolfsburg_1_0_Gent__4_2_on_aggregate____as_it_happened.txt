88 min: Ooh, Casteels was in trouble for a moment: he came to claim a cross in

head and Casteels grabbed it at the second attempt.

85 min: Long-range effort from Vieirinha, but Sels is down comfortably to 
save. Gent look well beaten.

84 min: Nice pass from Dante for Caligiuri, who tries to find Foket, but 
Nielsen clears for a corner. It’s a waste.

81 min: Caligiuri runs in behind, but Gershon is across to cover. Now Trasch, 
who has found himself in several advanced positions this game, fires a 
left-foot effort at goal. Comfortable save for Sels, though.

77 min: A shame for Gent: they’ve battled gamely, but perhaps the quality 
isn’t quite there.

Julian Draxler makes way for Daniel Caligiuri, and a final change for Gent: 
Rafinha is replaced by Thomas Foket.

Well, Schürrle gets the goal, but it’s all thanks to Draxler. He picked it up 
on the right flank after Gent gave it away, and flummoxed Asare with a marked 
change of pace, before getting to the byline, looking up, crossing low for 
Schürrle – who couldn’t miss from eight yards. Great goal, andWolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> now can celebrate a last-eight 
spot.

72 min: Nice play from the pacy Dejaegere, but his shot is wide of Casteels’ 
post. An interesting statistic:Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> have made 319 passes in this 
game; Gent 350.

71 min: Now Schürrle goes close! Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> counter-attack, and Schürrle 
is played in, but Gershon does very well to come across and block. Corner, and 
Sels catches commandingly.

69 min: There’s certainly more space opening up. Could we be in for an 
entertaining final 20 minutes?

Another change for Gent: Moses Simon off, Kalifa Coulibaly on. Coulibaly 
scored the second in the first leg, you’ll remember, and a shot within 30 
seconds! Easy for Sels, but positive from the substitute.

67 min: Dejaegere looked to inject some pace into Gent’s attack, and ran at 
Dante, but then ran into the Brazilian, who just stood there with his arms up. 
No foul, and the correct call.

Change for Gent: Kenneth Saief on for Thomas Matton, who’s been peripheral.

65 min: Trasch, who’s been full of verve, advances down the right side, but 
can’t pick out a teammate in the box, and Gent come away with it. The home side 
beginning to crank things up.

59 min: Oh, Schürrle missed his shot! Great deep cross by Trasch, laid back 
from Kruse, and Schürrle just couldn’t get any power or accuracy in his effort. 
It came off his studs. Chance!

57 min: Close from Milicevic! Simon absolutely burns Trasch on the left side, 
surges into the box and cuts it back for Milicevic on his left foot, but his 
shot is wide! Dante, I think it was, did well to pressure the ball and put him 
off, but the Swiss attacker might have hit the target.

54 min: Possession football from Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>. And they force a corner, 
which Draxler will take. Dante won it, and it looped goalwards, but over the 
bar. Deflected, though – it’s another corner.

Half-time: Wolfsburg 0-0 Gent

A decent start, but then the last 20 minutes or so was forgettable. Gent are 
still in this, but they have to find two goal from somewhere. It seems 
unlikely, but remember: miracles do happen!

45 min +1: Draxler’s ball in, Sels punches clear, and referee Skomina blows 
for half-time. It looks like Dante took a clout in the melee.

44 min: Milicevic found himself in space, 30 yards from goal, and floated one 
in for Matton, who had charged forward from midfield, but then Matton seemed to 
misjudge the flight, and it ran out of play for a goal kick. This game has gone 
off the boil.

42 min: Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> slowly 
starting to dominate. Kruse gives Rafinha the slip, but his cross is too long. 
I must say, the crossing tonight has been largely dreadful.

39 min: Gent have just lost a little of their early attacking thrust, as 
though they’re content to get to half-time goalless. Dante crosses one from the 
left, but it’s too long for Kruse. So it goes.

37 min: Nicely worked between Trasch and Schürrle, but the latter’s pull-back 
was misplaced, and Gent can clear. Audible groans from the crowd.

A deserved victory for Wolfsburg, who just showed a sliver more quality in a 
reasonably dreary game. Gent played well in parts, and looked solid, by and 
large, but they struggled to create chances, and Wolfsburg got their goal 
thanks to an inspired moment from Julian Draxler.Wolfsburg

Wolfsburg’s Champions League dream lives on as André Schürrle sinks Gent

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/08/wolfsburg-gent-champions-league-match-report> 
The Wolves reach the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> quarter-finals for the 
first time in their history.
 
90 min +2: Final 90 seconds. Can Gent manage a goal?

(No.)
 
90 min +1: Dejaegere has a go from distance, but it was always rising, and 
Casteels watches it sail over.
 
90 min: Three minutes of stoppage time.
 
89 min: No, this is the last change for Wolfsburg! Schäfer on for Schürrle.
 
88 min: Ooh, Casteels was in trouble for a moment: he came to claim a cross in 
front of Coulibaly, but got nowhere near it. Luckily it bounced off Coulibaly’s 
head and Casteels grabbed it at the second attempt.
 
86 min: Gent have been composed in possession, but they’ve struggled to create 
clear chances, especially in the second half.
 
85 min: Long-range effort from Vieirinha, but Sels is down comfortably to 
save. Gent look well beaten.
 
84 min: Nice pass from Dante for Caligiuri, who tries to find Foket, but 
Nielsen clears for a corner. It’s a waste.
 
82 min: Last change for Wolfsburg: Arnold off, Vieirinha on.
 
81 min: Caligiuri runs in behind, but Gershon is across to cover. Now Trasch, 
who has found himself in several advanced positions this game, fires a 
left-foot effort at goal. Comfortable save for Sels, though.
 
79 min: The Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> fans 
are having a sing, and well they might: a last-eight place is not to be sniffed 
at.
 
77 min: A shame for Gent: they’ve battled gamely, but perhaps the quality 
isn’t quite there.

Julian Draxler makes way for Daniel Caligiuri, and a final change for Gent: 
Rafinha is replaced by Thomas Foket.
 
Well, Schürrle gets the goal, but it’s all thanks to Draxler. He picked it up 
on the right flank after Gent gave it away, and flummoxed Asare with a marked 
change of pace, before getting to the byline, looking up, crossing low for 
Schürrle – who couldn’t miss from eight yards. Great goal, andWolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> now can celebrate a last-eight 
spot.
 
And that, surely, is that.

72 min: Nice play from the pacy Dejaegere, but his shot is wide of Casteels’ 
post. An interesting statistic:Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> have made 319 passes in this 
game; Gent 350.
 
71 min: Now Schürrle goes close! Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> counter-attack, and Schürrle 
is played in, but Gershon does very well to come across and block. Corner, and 
Sels catches commandingly.
 
69 min: There’s certainly more space opening up. Could we be in for an 
entertaining final 20 minutes?

Another change for Gent: Moses Simon off, Kalifa Coulibaly on. Coulibaly 
scored the second in the first leg, you’ll remember, and a shot within 30 
seconds! Easy for Sels, but positive from the substitute.
 
67 min: Dejaegere looked to inject some pace into Gent’s attack, and ran at 
Dante, but then ran into the Brazilian, who just stood there with his arms up. 
No foul, and the correct call.

Change for Gent: Kenneth Saief on for Thomas Matton, who’s been peripheral.
 
65 min: Trasch, who’s been full of verve, advances down the right side, but 
can’t pick out a teammate in the box, and Gent come away with it. The home side 
beginning to crank things up.
 
63 min: Things hotting up a little. There’s definitely more intensity.
 
61 min: Luiz Gustavo tries to do the same, and it’s wider.
 
60 min: Rodriguez cuts inside and slams one at goal from 20 yards. Just wide.

Baron/Bongarts/Getty Images  
59 min: Oh, Schürrle missed his shot! Great deep cross by Trasch, laid back 
from Kruse, and Schürrle just couldn’t get any power or accuracy in his effort. 
It came off his studs. Chance!
 
57 min: Close from Milicevic! Simon absolutely burns Trasch on the left side, 
surges into the box and cuts it back for Milicevic on his left foot, but his 
shot is wide! Dante, I think it was, did well to pressure the ball and put him 
off, but the Swiss attacker might have hit the target.
 
55 min: Rodriguez takes, Luiz Gustavo thrashes one from 10 yards, but straight 
at Sels! The keeper pawed it away, and then grabbed it at the second attempt. 
Decent chance, but Gustavo couldn’t find the corner.

54 min: Possession football from Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>. And they force a corner, 
which Draxler will take. Dante won it, and it looped goalwards, but over the 
bar. Deflected, though – it’s another corner.
 
53 min: Again, Damir Skomina is lenient, and declines to book Neto for a foul 
on Trasch. TheWolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> 
defender is down, momentarily, but he’ll be OK.
 
52 min: Rodriguez from 30 yards … into the wall. Madon!
 
51 min: Arnold looks to go through the middle, and is dragged back in crude 
fashion by Kums, the skipper. No card, though! Chance forWolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> from the kick.
 
50 min: Draxler take it down on the right side, cuts infield, and spanks a 
shot into orbit.
 
48 min: Kums, who carries the ball nicely, is almost into the box, but Dante 
does well to cover. Looks like the former Bayern man is OK after that whack he 
took from Sels at the end of the first period.
 
47 min: If Gent could just get a goal, wouldn’t that set the second half up 
nicely?Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>, whose 
Bundesliga form hasn’t been great, might get extremely nervy. Fun!
 
46 min: And we’re hoping for goals. No changes from either side.
 
No goals in Madrid, but Edin Dzeko and Mohamed Salah have missed glorious 
chances for Roma. Catch up on the action with Scott Murray:

A decent start, but then the last 20 minutes or so was forgettable. Gent are 
still in this, but they have to find two goal from somewhere. It seems 
unlikely, but remember: miracles do happen!

45 min +1: Draxler’s ball in, Sels punches clear, and referee Skomina blows 
for half-time. It looks like Dante took a clout in the melee.

45 min: Schürrle, who has switched to the left, is fouled. One last chance for 
Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> from the set piece.

44 min: Milicevic found himself in space, 30 yards from goal, and floated one 
in for Matton, who had charged forward from midfield, but then Matton seemed to 
misjudge the flight, and it ran out of play for a goal kick. This game has gone 
off the boil.
 
43 min: Neto is penalised for dry-humping Guilavogui. 
 
42 min: Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> slowly 
starting to dominate. Kruse gives Rafinha the slip, but his cross is too long. 
I must say, the crossing tonight has been largely dreadful.
 
39 min: Gent have just lost a little of their early attacking thrust, as 
though they’re content to get to half-time goalless. Dante crosses one from the 
left, but it’s too long for Kruse. So it goes.
 
37 min: Nicely worked between Trasch and Schürrle, but the latter’s pull-back 
was misplaced, and Gent can clear. Audible groans from the crowd.
