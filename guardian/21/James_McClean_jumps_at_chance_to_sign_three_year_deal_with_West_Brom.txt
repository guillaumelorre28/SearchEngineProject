West Bromwich Albion <https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom> have made 
the winger James McClean their first signing of the summer. The 26-year-old has 
joined from the League One side Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee and is 
tied to West Brom for three years, with the club retaining an option to extend 
the deal for a further 12 months.

The Republic of Ireland international told West Brom’s website: “I’m 
delighted. I’ve played in the Premier League before [with Sunderland] and not 
only am I back here but I’m with a stable top-flight club and one that wants to 
push on.

“Tony Pulis told me what his plans were, where I would fit in. It was all very 
positive. The Premier League is where any player wants to be.”

McClean finished last season as Wigan’s top scorer in the Championship with 
six goals and was voted the club’s player of the year but was powerless to stop 
Wigan being relegated to League One.
