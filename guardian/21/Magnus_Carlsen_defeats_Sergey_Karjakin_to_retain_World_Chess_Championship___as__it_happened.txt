“The classical part [of the match], I’m quite satisfied,” says Karjakin. “But 
somehow after we played 12 classical games, I was completely not ready to play 
rapid games. In the three games out of four I was lost. Of course Magnus took 
advantage of my mistakes and he deserved to win. My congratulations to him.”

“I pretty much knew this was going to happen when we made the draw in the 11th 
game,” Carlsen says. “But I felt good coming into today having had a few days 
of rest and days to prepare. The second game was a bit frustrating, but I’m 
very happy to have gotten there in the end.”

Karjakin is down to his final seconds. The engines now favor Carlsen by 80-20. 
He’s running out of time and options.

Karjakin is in need of a miracle. Carlsen has the superior position while the 
challenger has less than 30 seconds on the clock.

Here’s a fascinating theory put forth by grandmaster Peter Svidler. Might 
Karjakin be baiting Carlsen to play for a win in an effort to give him more 
chances? If so, it doesn’t appear to be yielding dividends. The engines still 
favor white by a 63-37 margin and Carlsen (10min 43sec) has more than triple 
the time as Karjakin (3min). The challenger spent more than six minutes on that 
last move (27... Qc7).

Judit Polgár questions whether Karjakin is doing enough to create winning 
chances. The Hungarian grandmaster describes his position as “terribly 
passive”. The challenger is now under 10mins while Carlsen has more than 14min 
of time.
Pavel Eljanov (@Eljanov) 
Sergey is fighting like a lion-huge respect towards him. But the question is 
still open: for what they spent one million for preparation?

Carlsen is on the verge of retaining the title. He’s looking awfully 
comfortable here with a superior position and a 3min time advantage.

Early advantages for Carlsen in position and time. Sound familiar? The 
computer gives him a 58-42 advantage, while Karjakin is already down to 17min 
(compared to 23 for the champion).

The fourth game of the tiebreak has just started with Carlsen playing as 
white, needing only a draw to retain the title. Finally a Sicilian opening, 
hardly a surprise given that Karjakin needs a win. Carlsen’s manager was in 
high spirits during the 10min break: “It’s only one more game but I’m starting 
to celebrate now.”

Karjakin is down to 20 seconds and counting, having considered his move for 
more than one minute.Carlsen has more than seven minutes. Can the Norwegian 
convert this position?

Another blunder by Carlsen, perhaps? He’s gone for 29... Bf6 instead of 29... 
gf6. Russian grandmaster Peter Svidler calls it “a bit of a mystifying 
decision”.

After 28 moves, the engines have it dead even at 50-50. But Carlsen has more 
than 10min of time with Karjakin already under 3min.

With Karjakin under pressure here in Game 3, the moment feels decisive for 
Carlsen. Should he convert these advantages for a win, he will play with white 
for the last of the four rapid tie-breakers only needing a draw to retain the 
championship.

Another tight spot for Karjakin, who is down to 6min compared to 16min for 
Carlsen after 22... axb4.The computer gives the champion a slight 55-45 
advantage.

Once again Karjakin finds himself at disadvantages in time and position. Now 
Carlsen is organizing an attack on the king side with 19… Qg6. An unpleasant 
position for the challenger.

Carlsen is very active in the opening of Game 3, looking to create winning 
chances. After 18 moves, he’s slightly favored by the computer and has more 
than 21min of time compared to less than 15min for Karjakin.

DRAW! Carlsen ½-½ Karjakin (Carlsen 1-1 Karjakin)

Roars in the spectator gallery as Karjakin has managed to scratch back to 
force a draw. He’s found the drawing move with four seconds left. “Unbelievable 
defensive skills by Karjakin!” Judit Polgár says. What a devastating blow for 
Carlsen, who seemingly had the game (and perhaps the match) in the bag.

And Carlsen blunders with 62. Bg4! The sure winning move was Kf7. Time is 
basically even. Carlsen’s advantage is now down 63-37 according to the computer.

OK, too many missed chances for Carlsen in this match. Probably time for him 
to pay the price.#CarlsenKarjakin

Karjakin is still fighting in Game 2. He’s benefitted from the 10sec 
increments given for every move and is up to 59sec while Carlsen is now under 
four minutes through 40 moves. The engines still give Carlsen a 75-25 advantage 
but the challenger has managed to close the time deficit.

Things are looking dire for Karjakin. Carlsen has a massive advantage in both 
position and time, with more than nine minutes on the clock compared to 40 
seconds for the challenger. Anish Giri, the world No10, thinks it’s done and 
dusted.

The second game has now taken on a fulcrumatic feel. Karjakin is under two 
minutes with Carlsen at 12min 48sec. The engines give Magnus a 67-33 advantage. 
Judit Polgár says that if Karjakin can somehow escape from this situation, it 
would deliver a huge psychological blow against Carlsen. If he wins, these may 
very well be the decisive moments of the world championship match.

Things are getting very tense here at the Seaport. Karjakin is under four 
minutes while Carlsen, who is really turning the screw and making severe 
demands of the Russian’s defensive faculties, is on 13 minutes.

Carlsen has more than twice as much time (16min) as Karjakin (7min). The 
computer, which doesn’t take time into account, also favors the reigning 
champion by a 57-43 margin.

Derrick from Long Beach asks via email whether Carlsen, who turns 26 today, 
would be the youngest ever former champion if he loses. He would not. Mikhail 
Talwon the title at 23 in 1960 
<http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=54299>, then lost it in a return 
match <http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=54393> the next year.

More solid defending from Karjakin, which has been a running theme over the 
fortnight. But the computer has started to favor Carlsen by a slight margin 
after a 50-50 opening through 15 moves.

DRAW! Karjakin ½-½ Carlsen

The first rapid tie-breaker game ends in a draw after 37 moves. A solid result 
for Carlsen as black. “Both players felt this was a warming-up game for today,” 
grandmaster Judit Polgár says.
Susan Polgar (@SusanPolgar) 
Game 1 drawn. No surprises. However, the biggest concern I see is Karjakin was 
way down on time in spite of white pieces#CarlsenKarjakin

Karjakin is now under the four-minute mark while Carlsen is still over 10min. 
Still looking drawish. The computer says it’s a 50-50 match, though it doesn’t 
take time into consideration.

Among today’s attendees: Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump transition team 
member Peter Thiel (who made the ceremonial first move) and Dmitry Peskov, 
press secretary to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

An inaccurate move by Carlsen (20. d4) briefly gives Karjakin the advantage on 
the computer, but Magnus quickly wrests it back. He’s ahead more than 10 
minutes on the clock and the pressure is building on Karjakin.

An eagle-eyed viewer notes that Carlsen is wearing socks with the NBA for 
today’s decider. The Norwegian is an avowed Boston Celtics fan 
<https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/804044589761986560>. He’s taking more 
time with his moves now, but still has a significant advantage on the clock

The players have taken the board. The photographers are snapping their final 
shots before vacating the sound-proof studio in the corner of the third floor 
at the Fulton Market Building where they’ve spent so many hours over the past 
fortnight. Only Carlsen and Karjakin will be in the room with a pair of silent 
arbiters when the first rapid tie-breaker game starts in just a few minutes.

For many years if a world chess championship match was tied after the 
designated number of games, the holder retained the title. Only in the past 
decade did Fide determine that a champion must be decided. The tie-breaker was 
first used in the2006 showdown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/sep/30/chess.gdnsport31> between 
Bulgaria’s Veselin Topalov and Russia’s Vladimir Kramnik, which saw Kramnik 
prevail after four rapid games. It happened again in 2012 when Vishy Anand of 
India retained his title against Boris Gelfand of Israel.

Carlsen, whom many have called the best player ever, was the favorite when the 
match began and remains the favorite today. He’s the top-ranked rapid player in 
the world. However, shorter games by nature engender more volatile results. 
Surely there would be an uproar if the title were to change hands under today’s 
circumstances. But what is chess without a spot of controversy?

Preamble

Hello and welcome to the Fulton Market Building at the South Street Seaport 
for the final day of the world chess championship. Twelve classical games were 
not enough to settle the match between the championMagnus Carlsen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/magnus-carlsen> and the challenger Sergey 
Karjakin. Each player managed only one win over two weeks – Karjakin drawing 
first blood in Game 8 and Carlsen striking back in Game 10 on Thanksgiving Day 
– with the other 10 games ending in draws. With the match level at 6-all, a 
series of tiebreakers will decide the world champion today, starting with a 
four-game rapid match in which each player has 25 minutes to complete his 
moves. If they’re still tied after that, up to five two-game blitz matches will 
be played in which each player has five minutes to complete his moves. If each 
of these ends in a draw, the world title will be settled with an Armageddon 
match in which a victor is guaranteed, as black wins on a draw with white 
getting more time as compensation. No possibility for controversy there. You 
can check out the complete rules below.

Anyway, it’s pouring here in lower Manhattan and they’ve just started allowing 
spectators into the gallery. The first match will begin in roughly 35 minutes.

3.7.1.a If the scores are level after the regular twelve (12) games, after a 
new drawing of colors, four (4) tie-break games shall be played. The games 
shall be played using the electronic clock starting with 25 minutes for each 
player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.

3.7.2 If the scores are level after the games in Article 3.7.1a, then, after a 
new drawing of colors, a match of 2 games shall be played with a time control 
of 5 minutes** plus 3 seconds increment after each move. In case of a level 
score, another 2-game match will be played to determine a winner. If still 
there is no winner after 5 such matches (total 10 games), one sudden-death game 
will be played as described below in Article 3.7.3.

3.7.3 If the score is still level after five matches as described in Article 
3.7.2, the players shall play a one sudden death game. The player who wins the 
drawing of lots may choose the color. The player with the white pieces shall 
receive 5 minutes, the player with the black pieces shall receive 4 minutes 
whereupon, after the 60th move, both players shall receive an increment of 3 
seconds starting from move 61. In case of a draw the player with the black 
pieces is declared the winner.

Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s the background 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/29/carlsen-v-karjakin-sudden-death-climax-looms-in-world-chess-championship>
 on the build-up to today’s finale.

Their last match on Monday ended with a draw after just 35 minutes and 30 
moves, an outcome that disappointed fans and chess experts alike. The 
grandmaster Susan Polgarobserved that it was “as exciting as watching clothes 
dry” <https://twitter.com/SusanPolgar/status/802628528034484225>, while the 
British grandmaster Nigel Shorttweeted 
<https://twitter.com/nigelshortchess/status/803319231542599680>: “If the 12th 
game ... were a restaurant dish, I would send it back to the chef.”

“We’re not at the penalty stage yet. We’re at extra time,” Carlsen said after 
Monday’s match, making a football analogy. “I understand if sometimes both 
teams are not trying to score in the last minute of regulation that can be 
frustrating but also having extra time is exciting.”

After launching an aggressive attack in game eight, only to eventually lose, 
Carlsen stormed out of an obligatory press conference. Latterly, he has 
appeared more relaxed. Wednesday’s tie-breaker starts with four rapid games, 
with an initial time limit of 25 minutes per player. If the deadlock continues 
there will be an “armageddon game”, in which white has five minutes and black 
four. Karjakin – who starts with black, if it gets that far – will only have to 
draw to win the title.

That’s all for now. Thanks for following along with us and do check back later 
for a full match report.
 
“The classical part [of the match], I’m quite satisfied,” says Karjakin. “But 
somehow after we played 12 classical games, I was completely not ready to play 
rapid games. In the three games out of four I was lost. Of course Magnus took 
advantage of my mistakes and he deserved to win. My congratulations to him.”
 
“I pretty much knew this was going to happen when we made the draw in the 11th 
game,” Carlsen says. “But I felt good coming into today having had a few days 
of rest and days to prepare. The second game was a bit frustrating, but I’m 
very happy to have gotten there in the end.”
 
Carlsen has emerged for the post-match press conference. Norwegian media are 
serenading him to the tune of the Happy Birthday song.
 
Norway’s Magnus Carlsen <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/magnus-carlsen> has 
successfully defended the world chess championship after winning today’s 
rapid-game playoff with a victories in the third and fourth games after draws 
in the first two. The world’s top-ranked player, who turns 26 today, has 
finally seen off the dogged efforts of Russian challenger Sergey Karjakin.

 
It’s over! Carlsen wins to finish off this world championship match in style!
 
Karjakin is down to his final seconds. The engines now favor Carlsen by 80-20. 
He’s running out of time and options.
 
Karjakin is in need of a miracle. Carlsen has the superior position while the 
challenger has less than 30 seconds on the clock.
 
Here’s a fascinating theory put forth by grandmaster Peter Svidler. Might 
Karjakin be baiting Carlsen to play for a win in an effort to give him more 
chances? If so, it doesn’t appear to be yielding dividends. The engines still 
favor white by a 63-37 margin and Carlsen (10min 43sec) has more than triple 
the time as Karjakin (3min). The challenger spent more than six minutes on that 
last move (27... Qc7).
 
Judit Polgár questions whether Karjakin is doing enough to create winning 
chances. The Hungarian grandmaster describes his position as “terribly 
passive”. The challenger is now under 10mins while Carlsen has more than 14min 
of time.
Pavel Eljanov (@Eljanov) 
Sergey is fighting like a lion-huge respect towards him. But the question is 
still open: for what they spent one million for preparation?
 <https://twitter.com/Eljanov/status/804091189003767808> November 30, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/Eljanov/status/804091189003767808>  
Carlsen is on the verge of retaining the title. He’s looking awfully 
comfortable here with a superior position and a 3min time advantage.
 
Early advantages for Carlsen in position and time. Sound familiar? The 
computer gives him a 58-42 advantage, while Karjakin is already down to 17min 
(compared to 23 for the champion).

The fourth game of the tiebreak has just started with Carlsen playing as 
white, needing only a draw to retain the title. Finally a Sicilian opening, 
hardly a surprise given that Karjakin needs a win. Carlsen’s manager was in 
high spirits during the 10min break: “It’s only one more game but I’m starting 
to celebrate now.”
 
And time runs out on Karjakin! Carlsen strikes a decisive blow and leads 2-1 
entering the fourth and final rapid tie-breaker. Karjakin must now win with the 
black pieces in order to keep his championship hopes alive.

 
Karjakin is down to 20 seconds and counting, having considered his move for 
more than one minute.Carlsen has more than seven minutes. Can the Norwegian 
convert this position?
 
Another blunder by Carlsen, perhaps? He’s gone for 29... Bf6 instead of 29... 
gf6. Russian grandmaster Peter Svidler calls it “a bit of a mystifying 
decision”.
 
After 28 moves, the engines have it dead even at 50-50. But Carlsen has more 
than 10min of time with Karjakin already under 3min.
 
With Karjakin under pressure here in Game 3, the moment feels decisive for 
Carlsen. Should he convert these advantages for a win, he will play with white 
for the last of the four rapid tie-breakers only needing a draw to retain the 
championship.
 
Another tight spot for Karjakin, who is down to 6min compared to 16min for 
Carlsen after 22... axb4.The computer gives the champion a slight 55-45 
advantage.
 
Once again Karjakin finds himself at disadvantages in time and position. Now 
Carlsen is organizing an attack on the king side with 19… Qg6. An unpleasant 
position for the challenger.
 
Carlsen is very active in the opening of Game 3, looking to create winning 
chances. After 18 moves, he’s slightly favored by the computer and has more 
than 21min of time compared to less than 15min for Karjakin.
 
Another Ruy Lopez opening, the 10th in the 15 games of this world championship 
match. According to NRK, Carlsen was disappointed but not angry 
<https://twitter.com/TarjeiJS/status/804078938549080064> after failing to 
convert his massive Game 2 advantage into a victory.

The third of four rapid tie-breaker games is underway. How will Carlsen, now 
playing as black, respond from such an extraordinary result?

Roars in the spectator gallery as Karjakin has managed to scratch back to 
force a draw. He’s found the drawing move with four seconds left. “Unbelievable 
defensive skills by Karjakin!” Judit Polgár says. What a devastating blow for 
Carlsen, who seemingly had the game (and perhaps the match) in the bag.
 
And Carlsen blunders with 62. Bg4! The sure winning move was Kf7. Time is 
basically even. Carlsen’s advantage is now down 63-37 according to the computer.

OK, too many missed chances for Carlsen in this match. Probably time for him 
to pay the price.#CarlsenKarjakin

The computer has just announced that white mates in 31 moves. Of course, the 
only two people in the building who don’t benefit from that knowledge are 
behind the pieces.

Karjakin is still fighting in Game 2. He’s benefitted from the 10sec 
increments given for every move and is up to 59sec while Carlsen is now under 
four minutes through 40 moves. The engines still give Carlsen a 75-25 advantage 
but the challenger has managed to close the time deficit.
 
Things are looking dire for Karjakin. Carlsen has a massive advantage in both 
position and time, with more than nine minutes on the clock compared to 40 
seconds for the challenger. Anish Giri, the world No10, thinks it’s done and 
dusted.

<https://twitter.com/anishgiri/status/804065536946606080>  
The second game has now taken on a fulcrumatic feel. Karjakin is under two 
minutes with Carlsen at 12min 48sec. The engines give Magnus a 67-33 advantage. 
Judit Polgár says that if Karjakin can somehow escape from this situation, it 
would deliver a huge psychological blow against Carlsen. If he wins, these may 
very well be the decisive moments of the world championship match.
 
Things are getting very tense here at the Seaport. Karjakin is under four 
minutes while Carlsen, who is really turning the screw and making severe 
demands of the Russian’s defensive faculties, is on 13 minutes.
 
Carlsen has more than twice as much time (16min) as Karjakin (7min). The 
computer, which doesn’t take time into account, also favors the reigning 
champion by a 57-43 margin.
 
Derrick from Long Beach asks via email whether Carlsen, who turns 26 today, 
would be the youngest ever former champion if he loses. He would not. Mikhail 
Talwon the title at 23 in 1960 
<http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=54299>, then lost it in a return 
match <http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=54393> the next year.
 
More solid defending from Karjakin, which has been a running theme over the 
fortnight. But the computer has started to favor Carlsen by a slight margin 
after a 50-50 opening through 15 moves.
 
Once again Carlsen is opening a time advantage. He’s on 23min compared to 
20min for Karjakin.

opening eight moves. Both players have taken off their jackets and Karjakin is 
sipping a coffee made by his team during the break.
 
The second rapid tie-breaker is underway. Carlsen is playing as white, 
Karjakin as black.
 
The players are back at the board. The second game will begin shortly.
 
The first rapid tie-breaker game ends in a draw after 37 moves. A solid result 
for Carlsen as black. “Both players felt this was a warming-up game for today,” 
grandmaster Judit Polgár says.

The players will now take a 10-minute break where they are allowed to prepare.
 
Karjakin is now under the four-minute mark while Carlsen is still over 10min. 
Still looking drawish. The computer says it’s a 50-50 match, though it doesn’t 
take time into consideration.

Among today’s attendees: Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump transition team 
member Peter Thiel (who made the ceremonial first move) and Dmitry Peskov,

The position has simplified after 31. Kh2 and it appears a draw is forthcoming.
 The computer has it dead even.
 
An inaccurate move by Carlsen (20. d4) briefly gives Karjakin the advantage on 
the computer, but Magnus quickly wrests it back. He’s ahead more than 10 
minutes on the clock and the pressure is building on Karjakin.
 
An eagle-eyed viewer notes that Carlsen is wearing socks with the NBA for 
today’s decider. The Norwegian is an avowed Boston Celtics fan 
<https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/804044589761986560>. He’s taking more 
time with his moves now, but still has a significant advantage on the clock 
with 17mins compared to Karjakin’s 11min.

The players have taken the board. The photographers are snapping their final 
shots before vacating the sound-proof studio in the corner of the third floor 
at the Fulton Market Building where they’ve spent so many hours over the past 
fortnight. Only Carlsen and Karjakin will be in the room with a pair of silent 
arbiters when the first rapid tie-breaker game starts in just a few minutes.
 
For many years if a world chess championship match was tied after the 
designated number of games, the holder retained the title. Only in the past 
decade did Fide determine that a champion must be decided. The tie-breaker was 
first used in the2006 showdown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/sep/30/chess.gdnsport31> between 
Bulgaria’s Veselin Topalov and Russia’s Vladimir Kramnik, which saw Kramnik 
prevail after four rapid games. It happened again in 2012 when Vishy Anand of 
India retained his title against Boris Gelfand of Israel.

Carlsen, whom many have called the best player ever, was the favorite when the 
match began and remains the favorite today. He’s the top-ranked rapid player in 
the world. However, shorter games by nature engender more volatile results. 
Surely there would be an uproar if the title were to change hands under today’s 
circumstances. But what is chess without a spot of controversy?
 
Hello and welcome to the Fulton Market Building at the South Street Seaport 
for the final day of the world chess championship. Twelve classical games were 
not enough to settle the match between the championMagnus Carlsen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/magnus-carlsen> and the challenger Sergey 
Karjakin. Each player managed only one win over two weeks – Karjakin drawing 
first blood in Game 8 and Carlsen striking back in Game 10 on Thanksgiving Day 
– with the other 10 games ending in draws. With the match level at 6-all, a 
series of tiebreakers will decide the world champion today, starting with a 
four-game rapid match in which each player has 25 minutes to complete his 
moves. If they’re still tied after that, up to five two-game blitz matches will 
be played in which each player has five minutes to complete his moves. If each 
of these ends in a draw, the world title will be settled with an Armageddon 
match in which a victor is guaranteed, as black wins on a draw with white 
getting more time as compensation. No possibility for controversy there. You 
can check out the complete rules below.

Anyway, it’s pouring here in lower Manhattan and they’ve just started allowing 
spectators into the gallery. The first match will begin in roughly 35 minutes.

3.7.1.a If the scores are level after the regular twelve (12) games, after a 
new drawing of colors, four (4) tie-break games shall be played. The games 
shall be played using the electronic clock starting with 25 minutes for each 
player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.

3.7.2 If the scores are level after the games in Article 3.7.1a, then, after a 
new drawing of colors, a match of 2 games shall be played with a time control 
of 5 minutes** plus 3 seconds increment after each move. In case of a level 
score, another 2-game match will be played to determine a winner. If still 
there is no winner after 5 such matches (total 10 games), one sudden-death game 
will be played as described below in Article 3.7.3.

3.7.3 If the score is still level after five matches as described in Article 
3.7.2, the players shall play a one sudden death game. The player who wins the 
drawing of lots may choose the color. The player with the white pieces shall 
receive 5 minutes, the player with the black pieces shall receive 4 minutes 
whereupon, after the 60th move, both players shall receive an increment of 3 
seconds starting from move 61. In case of a draw the player with the black 
pieces is declared the winner.
 
Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s the background 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/29/carlsen-v-karjakin-sudden-death-climax-looms-in-world-chess-championship>
 on the build-up to today’s finale.

Their last match on Monday ended with a draw after just 35 minutes and 30 
moves, an outcome that disappointed fans and chess experts alike. The 
grandmaster Susan Polgarobserved that it was “as exciting as watching clothes 
dry” <https://twitter.com/SusanPolgar/status/802628528034484225>, while the 
British grandmaster Nigel Shorttweeted 
<https://twitter.com/nigelshortchess/status/803319231542599680>: “If the 12th 
game ... were a restaurant dish, I would send it back to the chef.”

“We’re not at the penalty stage yet. We’re at extra time,” Carlsen said after 
Monday’s match, making a football analogy. “I understand if sometimes both 
teams are not trying to score in the last minute of regulation that can be 
frustrating but also having extra time is exciting.”

After launching an aggressive attack in game eight, only to eventually lose, 
Carlsen stormed out of an obligatory press conference. Latterly, he has 
appeared more relaxed. Wednesday’s tie-breaker starts with four rapid games, 
with an initial time limit of 25 minutes per player. If the deadlock continues 
there will be an “armageddon game”, in which white has five minutes and black 
four. Karjakin – who starts with black, if it gets that far – will only have to 
draw to win the title.
