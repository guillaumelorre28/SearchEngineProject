I write regarding Hitachi Rail Europe’s first Intercity Express train to be 
built in the UK (Report, 9 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/hitachi-unveils-first-uk-built-intercity-express-train-durham>
). This train might well be “put together in the UK”, but many of its 
components are made in Japan and elsewhere. Perhaps it might be more accurate 
to say assembled in the UK, though I doubt that would have quite the same 
publicity value. My company,William Cook Rail 
<http://www.william-cook.co.uk/rail.html>, based at the heart of the “northern 
powerhouse” in Leeds, is a world-class manufacturer of components for 
high-speed and commuter trains. It exports 80% of its products to blue-chip 
train manufacturers throughout Europe and elsewhere. Yet it was not even 
invited to bid to supply the critical bogie parts for the new Hitachi trains. 
These are all coming from Japan. Manufacturing forms a key element of the 
government’s economic strategy. Billions of pounds of UK taxpayers’ money are 
being spent on the biggest investment in railways since the Victorian era. 
Ministers should be insisting on local content where possible to support UK 
industries and UK jobs. Surely this makes sense.
