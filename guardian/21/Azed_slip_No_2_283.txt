Comments

184 entries, with no mistakes apart from one incomplete grid (a single 
unfilled square, suggesting oversight). Favourite clue, of 20 nominated once or 
more, was, by a long way; ‘Island record producers hope to achieve this with 
backing’ for IONA, with ‘Goes off the rails, caught with weapon with minor 
affray once’ (SCARMOGE) in second place. My clue to KARENNI (‘Burmese people 
are born in what may be Indian, backward’) puzzled a few, and was criticized as 
possibly offensive by one regular. The problem, I think, was ‘n’ for ‘born’ 
(Italian nato). I used the abbreviation without thinking to check it in 
Chambers, which does not in fact include it, though I could swear it used to 
and it appears in some other dictionaries I have consulted. The other problem 
entry was RASAE, plural of ‘rasa’ and given in C as part of the plural of 
tabula rasa. I got this from Chambers Words, which I use a lot for 
grid-filling, but failed to check it until I came to the cluing. Had I done so 
earlier I should probably have gone for a less problematical word, with a bit 
of minor (and easy) rejigging. As it was, I did my best in the line below the 
clues to indicate where it might be found. Some of you may have missed this. 
Verb. sap.

So what to make of BARGAIN? A friendly-looking word, you’d think, but one 
which in the event proved quite awkward to do something original with. The 
obvious approach – via its two components BAR and GAIN – proved understandably 
popular but yielded a large number of short and serviceable but ultimately 
somewhat uninspired clues (e.g. ‘Steal pub profit’) with little to choose 
between them. Some of you went for the ‘count on’ definition of BARGAIN as a 
verb in Chambers, but this gave me a real problem. Although labelled vi, this 
phrasal verb can surely only be transitive in usage, indicating a 
lexicographical error. I didn’t disqualify any who used it but none achieved 
higher than HC.

A few other things. (a) How did I come to dream up ‘Cannongate’ in my clue to 
NONG? I think I had it in my head that it was a London underground station 
(confusing it with Cannon Street, I guess). There is a Canongate in Edinburgh, 
but that wouldn’t have helped the sense of the clue. (b) I have never cared for 
‘e’ as an abbreviation for ‘euro’, rather than (or as well as) the symbol €, 
but it’s in the Oxford Dictionary of English and quite possibly elsewhere, so I 
suppose I must accept it. (c) I’m not keen on ‘three’ or ‘threefold’ to 
indicate ‘ter-’, or indeed any combining form or prefix being treated in this 
way, without some form of wording that indicates that they are not words in 
their own right. Floodgates again.
