Kellerman asks Bradley what happened on the knockdowns. “I don’t even 
remember, man,” he says. Kellerman helpfully points to a monitor. First, the 
sixth-round flash knockdown: “That wasn’t really a knockdown, he kind of pushed 
me dwon with his glove.”

Then the monitor shows footage of the second knockdown: “Ooh! Yeah, he caught 
me good with that one.”

Adds Bradley: “[Pacquiao] is very quick, very explosive, it’s hard to really 
judge him. And he’s experienced. He used his experience against me.”

Pacquiao’s in-ring interview with HBO’s Max Kellerman is being drowned out by 
cheers in the arena. “Every round I’m looking for the knockdown,” Pacquiao 
says. Kellerman asks him about possibly fighting Canelo or Mayweather, but 
Manny hardly takes the bait.

Round 12

Bradley lands a counter right. Crowd on their feet with a minute left – 
perhaps the last minute of Pacquiao’s career – urging their man to close the 
show. He tries to lunge in but Bradley wraps him up. A hard shot by Pacquiao 
rattles Bradley near the end but Bradley nicks the final frame on activity. 
Shouldn’t matter though. There’s the bell. Bradley hugs Freddie Roach then 
Pacquiao.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Bradley (Pacquiao 116-110 Bradley)

Round 11

I’m told Bradley’s wife has left her ringside seat. A fire seems to have gone 
out with Bradley. He’s now circling Pacquiao and reverted to pawing with the 
jab. Pacquiao darting left to right and picking his spots, not pressing the 
attack. Bradley lands a right that moves Pacquiao back a bit, but that’s just 
about it. He’s going to need more – a lot more – to turn this tide. Not the 
most lopsided round but Pacquiao did more.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Bradley (Pacquiao 107-100 Bradley)

Round 10

Bradley realizing he needs a knockput to win and that’s put him in vulnerable 
position. He’s missing wildly. Pacquiao not making him pay with every miss but 
he’s doing enough to score, mostly with left hands. Nothing from Bradley that 
round. It’s looking more and more like Manny’s night.

Round 9

Bradley lands an uppercut to start the ninth, but the pace has slowed. And 
Pacquiao drops Bradley again – this time there’s no doubt about it! – a counter 
left in the center of the ring lands flush dumps the American to the canvas and 
the entire crowd of 14,655 is on their feet. A wonderful counterpunch that 
sends Bradley almost into a reverse somersaunt as he crashes to the canvas. 
Bradley is hurt! He beats the count and now Pacquiao is going for the kill. 
Bradley makes it to the bell. High drama in Las Vegas!

Round 8

A slow start quickly gives way to more two-way action. Good right hand by 
Bradley but Pacquiao answers with a flurry of punches. Bradley tags Pacquiao 
with a massive right hand that stops him in his tracks. Pacquiao is hurt! The 
crowd is rocking, cheering for Manny but also chants for Bradley. Pacquiao in 
full retreat. Best round of the fight for the American.

Round 7

It’s Pacquiao who strikes first, a left-right combo upstairs, and darts 
outside before Bradley can answer. Good work from Bradley here, who is 
measuring and using head movement to keep Pacquiao at bay. And down goes 
Bradley! A short right hook did it. A flash knockdown. The crowd is going wild! 
Replay confirms the right didn’t connect flush and it could have been ruled a 
slip, yet the referee’s ruling stands and Bradley faces an uphill climb.

Round 6

The sixth doesn’t exactly pick up where the fifth left off. A slow start. Good 
flurry by Bradley gets Manny’s attention. Just over a minute left and Pacquiao 
darts in with another combo and the crowd screams with delight. A nice combo 
upstairs by Bradley but unclear how cleanly it landed. A very close round that 
could go either way, one of several swing rounds that could see scores all over 
the map if it goes the full 12 rounds. Manny looks faster and is starting to 
find his range. Bad news for Bradley, who is looking more and more apprehensive.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Bradley (Pacquiao 58-56 Bradley)

Round 5

Bradley has backed up Pacquiao along the ropes and opens fire, connecting with 
a chopping right. A right-left combination for Bradley and now the corwd is 
cheering his name. And here comes Pacquiao – out of nowhere! He’s pouring it on 
in the center of the ring and the crowd is on their feet! Wow! They trade left 
hooks. And just like that a fight has broken out! Manny is lighting Bradley up 
with rapid-fire combinations. For a brief moment the Pacquiao of old. The bell 
rings and Teddy Atlas is in the ring screaming at Bradley before his charge can 
even take his stool. Best round of the fight easily.

Round 4

Both fighters throwing if not landing more in bursts of action. Pacquiao 
throws a series of quick combinations upstairs with Bradley absorbing some and 
parrying the rest. A stinging left hand for Pacquiao, his best punch of the 
fight. Thirty seconds remaining in the round and Pacquiao is opening up. A 
great round for the Filipino. Not a crowd-pleaser but an interesting first act.

Round 3

Pacquiao throws a left with bad intentions that just Bradley nearly swerves 
but it connects. The fighters are opening up here in the third and the crowd is 
loving it. Bradley misses wildly with a hook, but connects with a vicious 
right. Still awfully quiet in between the exchanges. Pacquaio showing good hand 
speed when he throws, using the jab with better effect here. Bradley with a 
left to the abdomen. Not quite enough. Pacquiao takes it.

Round 2

Bradley still looking to establish the jab whie Pacquiao looking to ... well, 
it’s not quite certain. A tactical opening, to put it charitably. Pacquiao 
trying to cut off the ring but Bradley using shifty lateral movement to subvert 
the efforts. A nice inside uppercut by Bradley followed by an inside hook. Good 
shot by the American. Pacquiao fires back with a one-two combo but Bradley 
darts safely out of range. Bradley misses and Pacquiao counters inside with a 
compact left hand. Another close round we’ll tip to Bradley.

Round 1

And the 25th round of the trilogy begins. Pacquiao nearly halfway across the 
ring when the bell rings, looking to be the aggressor. The fighters circle one 
another pawing with jabs. Bradley connects with a left jab to the face. Not 
much action so far. Cheers of Manny! Manny! but crowd quiets waiting for a 
landed punch. Strangely quiet in the arena. A poor round. Difficult to score, 
but an overly patient Pacquiao managed to do less.

The ring announcer is introducing the fighters. A mixed reception for Bradley 
but not nearly as negative as before their second fight. Massive cheers for 
Pacquiao. And more cheers of Manny! Manny! as referee Tony Weeks gives the 
final instructions.

Now it’s Pacquiao’s turn. Lights go down and the highlight reel set to AC/DC’s 
Thunderstruck that’s been a staple of his pre-intro plays. Now he emerges from 
the tunnel to remix of Katy Perry’s Roar mashed up with Eye of the Tiger, an 
ear-to-ear grin across his face. Loud chants of Manny! Manny! as he climbs 
through the ropes.

We’re into the final round of the last prelim bout before the main event and 
matters have not improved for Arthur Abraham. Ramirez is landing at will and 
building up a lopsided points lead – the Guardian has it 110-99 – with the 
champion’s face betraying a look of resignation. Barring a miracle, Ramirez 
will be the new WBO super middleweight champion in three minutes’ time.

This guy Abraham is terrible it's amazing these fighters in Germany get all 
this free money there but how many of them can actually fight?

We’re at the midpoint of the final undercard bout and the challenger is giving 
Abraham all he can handle. Ramirez’s reach and hand speed have asked questions 
of the 36-year-old champion he’s proven ill-equipped to answer. The Guardian 
has scored it a 60-54 shutout so far, though Abraham did enjoy his best round 
of the fight in the sixth.

Here’s a look at the odds at the MGM Grand sports book as of two hours ago. 
Bradley is a slight +180 underdog, meaning a $100 wager would yield a $180 
payout. Pacquiao is a -230 favorite, meaning a punter must put down $230 in 
order to win $100. Will be interesting to see which way the late action puts it 
when the market closes in the next half hour or so.

How’s this for counter-programming? In case you thought Floyd Mayweather had 
patched things up with Top Rank CEO Bob Arum – who promotes Pacquiao and at one 
point promoted Mayweather before their acrimonious split in 2007 – think again. 
Mayweather’s promotional outfit shared an image on Instagram shortly before 
tonight’s pay-per-view telecast went on the air in a somewhat clumsy but no 
doubt hilarious attempt to divert viewers to a NBA game between the Chicago 
Bulls and Cleveland Cavaliers.
 Mayweather can’t resist throwing his hat in the ring.

The last fight of an eight-bout undercard is about to begin. That old war 
horse Arthur Abraham (44-4, 29 KOs) is making his way to the ring to defend his 
WBO super middleweight championship against the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez 
(33-0, 24 KOs) Here’s a look at how the earlier prelims shook out (in reverse 
chronological order).

 * Oscar Valdez TKO 4 Evgeny Gradovich (10 rounds, featherweights) 
 * Jose Ramirez UD 10 Manny Perez (10 rounds, super lightweights) 
 * Devin Haney UD 4 Rafael Vazquez (four rounds, junior lightweights) 
 * Oleksandr Gvozdyk KO 2 Nadjib Mohammedi (10 rounds, light heavyweights) 
 * Egidijus Kavaliauskas UD 8 Deniz Ilbay (eight rounds, welterweights) 
 * Leon Bauer UD 6 Ilshat Khusnulgatin (six rounds, super middleweight) 
 * Konstantin Ponomarev SD 10 Brad Solomon (10 rounds, welterweights) 
Just a few passing observations. Bauer <http://boxrec.com/boxer/717300> and 
Haney <http://boxrec.com/boxer/741718> won their fights, improving to 8-0 and 
4-0, respectively. Incredibly, each is a mere 17 years old. While Bauer showed 
some conditioning issues in a six-round points win, Haney, a Vegas product who 
enjoyed vocal crowd support that filled the near-empty MGM Grand Garden Arena, 
displayed uncommon poise and robust skills for a teenager making his debut on 
US soil. One to watch for sure.

We’re considerably less bullish on ringside judge Ricardo Ocasio. The 
Reno-based arbiter managed to score Ponomarev’s completely one-sided win over 
Solomon in favor of Solomon by a 96-94 margin, making it a split decision. He 
should hand in his license at the door.

Good evening and welcome to the Las Vegas Strip for tonight’s fight between 
Manny Pacquiao and Timothy Bradley. It’s the third bout featuring these 
welterweight rivals, thought not exactly one that fight fans had been clamoring 
for. The consensus is there’s nothing left to decide between the pair, Pacquiao 
havingwon their second fight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/13/pacquiao-bradley-welterweight-points-win-mayweather>
 convincingly after ahighly disputed split-decision loss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/10/timothy-bradley-manny-pacquiao-split-decision>
 in the first.

For Pacquiao, it’s his first outing since a unanimous-decision loss to Floyd 
Mayweather 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/03/floyd-mayweather-beats-manny-pacquiao-on-points-to-remain-unbeaten>
 343 days ago. The Filipino aggravated an old shoulder injury that night and 
underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff by Dr Neal 
ElAttrache, whose patients have included Tom Brady and Kobe Bryant. He was 
given a clean bill of health in February and here we are. Speaking of the 
congressman, he arrived at the MGM Grand Garden Arena at 5.58pm local time with 
friends and family in tow. Just a few, per usual.

When asked if he is retired, Pacquiao is clear: “Yes, I am retired.” He adds, 
“I want to go home to my family and serve the people. I love the fans and thank 
them for all the support they’ve given me.”
 
Here’s a look at the official scorecard. The judges only saw half of the 12 
rounds the same way, yet they each arrived at the same score.

Pacquiao landed 112 of 439 punches (28%) compared to 99 of 302 (33%) for 
Bradley according to CompuBox. The most telling number is Bradley’s average 
punches thrown per round. It was 25 tonight – down from 52 in the second fight 
and 70 in the first.

Kellerman asks Bradley what happened on the knockdowns. “I don’t even 
remember, man,” he says. Kellerman helpfully points to a monitor. First, the 
sixth-round flash knockdown: “That wasn’t really a knockdown, he kind of pushed 
me dwon with his glove.”

Then the monitor shows footage of the second knockdown: “Ooh! Yeah, he caught 
me good with that one.”

Adds Bradley: “[Pacquiao] is very quick, very explosive, it’s hard to really 
judge him. And he’s experienced. He used his experience against me.”
 
Pacquiao’s in-ring interview with HBO’s Max Kellerman is being drowned out by 
cheers in the arena. “Every round I’m looking for the knockdown,” Pacquiao 
says. Kellerman asks him about possibly fighting Canelo or Mayweather, but 
Manny hardly takes the bait.
 
Pacquiao wins. All three judges turn in scores of 116-110.
 
Bradley lands a counter right. Crowd on their feet with a minute left – 
perhaps the last minute of Pacquiao’s career – urging their man to close the 
show. He tries to lunge in but Bradley wraps him up. A hard shot by Pacquiao 
rattles Bradley near the end but Bradley nicks the final frame on activity. 
Shouldn’t matter though. There’s the bell. Bradley hugs Freddie Roach then 
Pacquiao.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Bradley (Pacquiao 116-110 Bradley)
 
I’m told Bradley’s wife has left her ringside seat. A fire seems to have gone 
out with Bradley. He’s now circling Pacquiao and reverted to pawing with the 
jab. Pacquiao darting left to right and picking his spots, not pressing the 
attack. Bradley lands a right that moves Pacquiao back a bit, but that’s just 
about it. He’s going to need more – a lot more – to turn this tide. Not the 
most lopsided round but Pacquiao did more.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Bradley (Pacquiao 107-100 Bradley)
 
Bradley realizing he needs a knockput to win and that’s put him in vulnerable 
position. He’s missing wildly. Pacquiao not making him pay with every miss but 
he’s doing enough to score, mostly with left hands. Nothing from Bradley that 
round. It’s looking more and more like Manny’s night.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Bradley (Pacquiao 97-91 Bradley)
 
Bradley lands an uppercut to start the ninth, but the pace has slowed. And 
Pacquiao drops Bradley again – this time there’s no doubt about it! – a counter 
left in the center of the ring lands flush dumps the American to the canvas and 
the entire crowd of 14,655 is on their feet. A wonderful counterpunch that 
sends Bradley almost into a reverse somersaunt as he crashes to the canvas. 
Bradley is hurt! He beats the count and now Pacquiao is going for the kill. 
Bradley makes it to the bell. High drama in Las Vegas!


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-8 Bradley (Pacquiao 87-82 Bradley)
 
A slow start quickly gives way to more two-way action. Good right hand by 
Bradley but Pacquiao answers with a flurry of punches. Bradley tags Pacquiao 
with a massive right hand that stops him in his tracks. Pacquiao is hurt! The 
crowd is rocking, cheering for Manny but also chants for Bradley. Pacquiao in 
full retreat. Best round of the fight for the American.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Bradley (Pacquiao 77-74 Bradley)
 
It’s Pacquiao who strikes first, a left-right combo upstairs, and darts 
outside before Bradley can answer. Good work from Bradley here, who is 
measuring and using head movement to keep Pacquiao at bay. And down goes 
Bradley! A short right hook did it. A flash knockdown. The crowd is going wild! 
Replay confirms the right didn’t connect flush and it could have been ruled a 
slip, yet the referee’s ruling stands and Bradley faces an uphill climb.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-8 Bradley (Pacquiao 68-64 Bradley)
 
The sixth doesn’t exactly pick up where the fifth left off. A slow start. Good 
flurry by Bradley gets Manny’s attention. Just over a minute left and Pacquiao 
darts in with another combo and the crowd screams with delight. A nice combo 
upstairs by Bradley but unclear how cleanly it landed. A very close round that 
could go either way, one of several swing rounds that could see scores all over 
the map if it goes the full 12 rounds. Manny looks faster and is starting to 
find his range. Bad news for Bradley, who is looking more and more apprehensive.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Bradley (Pacquiao 58-56 Bradley)
 
Bradley has backed up Pacquiao along the ropes and opens fire, connecting with 
a chopping right. A right-left combination for Bradley and now the corwd is 
cheering his name. And here comes Pacquiao – out of nowhere! He’s pouring it on 
in the center of the ring and the crowd is on their feet! Wow! They trade left 
hooks. And just like that a fight has broken out! Manny is lighting Bradley up 
with rapid-fire combinations. For a brief moment the Pacquiao of old. The bell 
rings and Teddy Atlas is in the ring screaming at Bradley before his charge can 
even take his stool. Best round of the fight easily.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Bradley (Pacquiao 48-47 Bradley)
 
Both fighters throwing if not landing more in bursts of action. Pacquiao 
throws a series of quick combinations upstairs with Bradley absorbing some and 
parrying the rest. A stinging left hand for Pacquiao, his best punch of the 
fight. Thirty seconds remaining in the round and Pacquiao is opening up. A 
great round for the Filipino. Not a crowd-pleaser but an interesting first act.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Bradley (Pacquiao 38-38 Bradley)
 
Pacquiao throws a left with bad intentions that just Bradley nearly swerves 
but it connects. The fighters are opening up here in the third and the crowd is 
loving it. Bradley misses wildly with a hook, but connects with a vicious 
right. Still awfully quiet in between the exchanges. Pacquaio showing good hand 
speed when he throws, using the jab with better effect here. Bradley with a 
left to the abdomen. Not quite enough. Pacquiao takes it.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Bradley (Pacquiao 28-29 Bradley)

 
Bradley still looking to establish the jab whie Pacquiao looking to ... well, 
it’s not quite certain. A tactical opening, to put it charitably. Pacquiao 
trying to cut off the ring but Bradley using shifty lateral movement to subvert 
the efforts. A nice inside uppercut by Bradley followed by an inside hook. Good 
shot by the American. Pacquiao fires back with a one-two combo but Bradley 
darts safely out of range. Bradley misses and Pacquiao counters inside with a 
compact left hand. Another close round we’ll tip to Bradley.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Bradley (Pacquiao 18-20 Bradley)
 
And the 25th round of the trilogy begins. Pacquiao nearly halfway across the 
ring when the bell rings, looking to be the aggressor. The fighters circle one 
another pawing with jabs. Bradley connects with a left jab to the face. Not 
much action so far. Cheers of Manny! Manny! but crowd quiets waiting for a 
landed punch. Strangely quiet in the arena. A poor round. Difficult to score, 
but an overly patient Pacquiao managed to do less.


Guardian’s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Bradley 
 
The ring announcer is introducing the fighters. A mixed reception for Bradley 
but not nearly as negative as before their second fight. Massive cheers for 
Pacquiao. And more cheers of Manny! Manny! as referee Tony Weeks gives the 
final instructions.
 
Now it’s Pacquiao’s turn. Lights go down and the highlight reel set to AC/DC’s 
Thunderstruck that’s been a staple of his pre-intro plays. Now he emerges from 
the tunnel to remix of Katy Perry’s Roar mashed up with Eye of the Tiger, an 
ear-to-ear grin across his face. Loud chants of Manny! Manny! as he climbs 
through the ropes.
 
Timothy Bradley is making the long walk to the ring. The song is New Level by 
ASAP Ferg ft. Future. Looks confident.
 
Here’s a look at tonight’s tale of the tape. The fighters will be making their 
ringwalks any minute now.

Anthem time at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. First it’s Lupang Hinirang, the 
national anthem of the Philippines, performed by the World Choir of the 
Philippines. Recently minted American Idol winner Trent Harmon will sing The 
Star-Spangled Banner.
 
Ramirez has defeated Abraham by a unanimous decision to capture Abraham’s WBO 
super middleweight championship. All three ringside judges scored it 120-108 – 
a complete shutout – as did the Guardian. Ramirez becomes the first ever super 
middleweight champion from Mexico.

Ramirez connected with 114 of 532 punches (27%) compared to 85 of 441 (19%) 
for Abraham.
 
We’re into the final round of the last prelim bout before the main event and 
matters have not improved for Arthur Abraham. Ramirez is landing at will and 
building up a lopsided points lead – the Guardian has it 110-99 – with the 
champion’s face betraying a look of resignation. Barring a miracle, Ramirez 
will be the new WBO super middleweight champion in three minutes’ time.
Paul Malignaggi (@PaulMalignaggi) 
This guy Abraham is terrible it's amazing these fighters in Germany get all 
this free money there but how many of them can actually fight?

<https://twitter.com/PaulMalignaggi/status/718998973340598272>  
We’re at the midpoint of the final undercard bout and the challenger is giving 
Abraham all he can handle. Ramirez’s reach and hand speed have asked questions 
of the 36-year-old champion he’s proven ill-equipped to answer. The Guardian 
has scored it a 60-54 shutout so far, though Abraham did enjoy his best round 
of the fight in the sixth.

Here’s a look at the odds at the MGM Grand sports book as of two hours ago. 
Bradley is a slight +180 underdog, meaning a $100 wager would yield a $180 
payout. Pacquiao is a -230 favorite, meaning a punter must put down $230 in 
order to win $100. Will be interesting to see which way the late action puts it 
when the market closes in the next half hour or so.

How’s this for counter-programming? In case you thought Floyd Mayweather had 
patched things up with Top Rank CEO Bob Arum – who promotes Pacquiao and at one 
point promoted Mayweather before their acrimonious split in 2007 – think again. 
Mayweather’s promotional outfit shared an image on Instagram shortly before 
tonight’s pay-per-view telecast went on the air in a somewhat clumsy but no 
doubt hilarious attempt to divert viewers to a NBA game between the Chicago 
Bulls and Cleveland Cavaliers.
 Mayweather can’t resist throwing his hat in the ring.  
The last fight of an eight-bout undercard is about to begin. That old war 
horse Arthur Abraham (44-4, 29 KOs) is making his way to the ring to defend his 
WBO super middleweight championship against the unbeaten Gilberto Ramirez 
(33-0, 24 KOs) Here’s a look at how the earlier prelims shook out (in reverse 
chronological order).

 * Oscar Valdez TKO 4 Evgeny Gradovich (10 rounds, featherweights) 
 * Jose Ramirez UD 10 Manny Perez (10 rounds, super lightweights) 
 * Devin Haney UD 4 Rafael Vazquez (four rounds, junior lightweights) 
 * Oleksandr Gvozdyk KO 2 Nadjib Mohammedi (10 rounds, light heavyweights) 
 * Egidijus Kavaliauskas UD 8 Deniz Ilbay (eight rounds, welterweights) 
 * Leon Bauer UD 6 Ilshat Khusnulgatin (six rounds, super middleweight) 
 * Konstantin Ponomarev SD 10 Brad Solomon (10 rounds, welterweights) 
Just a few passing observations. Bauer <http://boxrec.com/boxer/717300> and 
Haney <http://boxrec.com/boxer/741718> won their fights, improving to 8-0 and 
4-0, respectively. Incredibly, each is a mere 17 years old. While Bauer showed 
some conditioning issues in a six-round points win, Haney, a Vegas product who 
enjoyed vocal crowd support that filled the near-empty MGM Grand Garden Arena, 
displayed uncommon poise and robust skills for a teenager making his debut on 
US soil. One to watch for sure.

We’re considerably less bullish on ringside judge Ricardo Ocasio. The 
Reno-based arbiter managed to score Ponomarev’s completely one-sided win over 
Solomon in favor of Solomon by a 96-94 margin, making it a split decision. He 
should hand in his license at the door.
 
Good evening and welcome to the Las Vegas Strip for tonight’s fight between 
Manny Pacquiao and Timothy Bradley. It’s the third bout featuring these 
welterweight rivals, thought not exactly one that fight fans had been clamoring 
for. The consensus is there’s nothing left to decide between the pair, Pacquiao 
havingwon their second fight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/13/pacquiao-bradley-welterweight-points-win-mayweather>
 convincingly after ahighly disputed split-decision loss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/10/timothy-bradley-manny-pacquiao-split-decision>
 in the first.

For Pacquiao, it’s his first outing since a unanimous-decision loss to Floyd 
Mayweather 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/03/floyd-mayweather-beats-manny-pacquiao-on-points-to-remain-unbeaten>
 343 days ago. The Filipino aggravated an old shoulder injury that night and 
underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff by Dr Neal 
ElAttrache, whose patients have included Tom Brady and Kobe Bryant. He was 
given a clean bill of health in February and here we are. Speaking of the 
congressman, he arrived at the MGM Grand Garden Arena at 5.58pm local time with 
friends and family in tow. Just a few, per usual.
