Schalke <https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke> have dismissed reports 
their talented 20-year-old attacking midfielder Leroy Sané has a buyout clause 
in his contract that could allow him to move this year against the club’s will.

Sané, whose contract runs to 2017, has been this season’s Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball> revelation, scoring 
four goals and setting up another four as his form carried him all the way to 
the German national team and his first senior cap last year.

He needed 31 Bundesliga matches – including 17 this season – to achieve this, 
and Schalke have repeatedly said they are not planning to release the player, 
who had spent six years playing for their youth teams.

“There is no buyout clause in force for Sané, neither for this winter nor for 
the summer,” the Schalke sports director, Horst Heldt, said on Twitter after 
reports of a possible departure.

Bild newspaper reported this week he had a buyout clause of €37m (£28m), 
meaning a team could offer that amount and sign the player despite his contract 
with Schalke.

German media have reported interest from top clubs, in Spain and in the 
Premier League, for the creative and quick player but Schalke have denied 
receiving any specific offers.

The Ruhr valley club, in sixth place this season, are under mounting pressure 
from their fans to hold on to Sané after they allowed another youth product, 
the Germany international and World Cup winnerJulian Draxler, to move to 
Wolfsburg

 this season for an estimated £25.5m.
