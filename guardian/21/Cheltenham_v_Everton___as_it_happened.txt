Right, that's it from me. Thanks for your company and emails. Stick around on 
site for the full match report and reaction, but from me cheerio!

9.36pm GMT 

Peep! Peep!! Peeeeeeeep!!! All over. And Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> are into the fourth round after 
the most regulation of regulation victories.

9.36pm GMT 

90+3 min: Three.

9.35pm GMT 

90+2 min: Two.

9.34pm GMT 

90+1 min: One.

9.34pm GMT 

90 min: Three minutes of added time to play.

9.33pm GMT 

90 min: The camera cuts to a member of the local police, who is wearing a huge 
grin – apparently he's got money on a 5-1 Everton win at 33-1.

9.32pm GMT 

GOAL! Cheltenham 1-5 Everton (Fellaini 89)

Anichebe, who has had one of his better games tonight, surges down the left 
and chips in to Fellaini who sidefoots emphatically past Brown.

9.30pm GMT 

88 min: GOA … no, hang on. How did that stay out? The ball broke loose to 
Naismith inside the area and sat up perfectly. Brown looked beaten but somehow 
managed to push the thing clear.

9.29pm GMT 

87 min: A little bit of Everton transfer tittle-tattle from Twitter, although 
it does come from the respected Nigerian journalist Colin Udoh:
Colin Udoh (@ColinUdoh) 
Away from awards delirium, to the more mundane, Reading have made a bid for 
Victor Anichebe. One which#EFC <https://twitter.com/search/%23EFC> have 
accepted, it seems

<https://twitter.com/ColinUdoh/status/288390100549787648> 
9.26pm GMT 

84 min: … Jones swings it in, Everton head clear yet again. Other than the one 
aberration for the goal, the visiting backline has been superb.

9.25pm GMT 

83 min: On commentary Craig Burley suggests that bad language gets worse at 
grounds the further you go up the leagues. Which is, frankly, nonsense.
Cheltenham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/cheltenham> corner …

9.24pm GMT 

81 min: There's really not much to see here now.

9.22pm GMT 

79 min: Anichebe nearly threads a ball through to Gueye, but can't quite beat 
the Cheltenham defenders.

9.20pm GMT 

77 min: Penn fizzes a shot at Howard's goal but it's slapped straight into the 
meaty palms of the American.

9.19pm GMT 

74 min: Fellaini bashes into Pack. In a game that now has fallen into a 
gentle, slightly lumbering torpor – very much like a sleeping cow actually – 
that jarred like a splinter.

9.14pm GMT 

72 min: McGlashan again scurries down the right and his cross eventually finds 
its way to the substitute Jake Taylor, who volleys a good five yards over the 
bar.

9.13pm GMT 

70 min: Anichebe trundles through midfield bu loses out to Jombati. He swings 
in a cross … that Howard catches unchallenged. The Everton keeper has had too 
much catching practice tonight.

9.10pm GMT 

68 min: Jones's free-kick drops deep to McGlashan but the winger skews his 
shot high and wide.

9.09pm GMT 

66 min: Cheltenham replace Goulding with Duffy and Carter with Taylor. They 
needed a change – the fourth goal does seem to have dampened spirits at Whaddon 
Road.

9.08pm GMT 

65 min: One for the history boys, via Twitter guru OptaJoe: "Cheltenham have 
conceded 4+ goals in anFA Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> 
game at home (excl. qualifiers) for the first time since Nov 1968 (0-4 v 
Watford)."

9.07pm GMT 

63 min: Gueye replaces Baines, which means a bit of a rejig. I think Oviedo's 
slotted in at left-back with Gueye ahead of him wide on the left.

9.06pm GMT 

62 min: McGlashan gets the chance to hurtle upfield once more – he even throws 
in a couple of stepovers. But Everton get numbers back and smother the danger.

9.03pm GMT 

59 min: I think it's safe to say he's back.

9.01pm GMT 

GOAL! Cheltenham 1-4 Everton (Coleman 58)

This is lovely. A cheeky little gem of a goal. Anichebe zips a pass into the 
charging full-back, who takes a touch and then gently pokes the ball over Brown 
as the ball sits up and the keeper rushes out.

9.00pm GMT 

57 min: Pack sends in another long throw. Again Howard collects.

8.59pm GMT 

56 min: … nodded out to Neville. Square to Jagielka. Inside to Osman. Shot. 
Looped into keeper's hands.

8.58pm GMT 

55 min: Oviedo gets round the back and looks to drill in a cross. Blocked. 
Corner …

8.57pm GMT 

54 min: Everton are on the ropes all of a sudden. McGlashan fizzes in a cross, 
but Distin just gets there ahead of Goulding and an Everton defender is first 
on the scene to hammer away the loose ball.

8.56pm GMT 

53 min: Another trip down memory lane, courtesy of Allan Scanlon. "Don't 
remember that Abergavenny game, but nights like tonight were what we dreamed 
about all those years of failing to get past the qualifying rounds starting 
in August. Ton Pentre, Merthr Tydfil, Yate, Bideford, Radstock ... great 
memories. Hasn't gone for us tonight, but we're not doing too badly, and if 
Everton werre awarded that penalty, then you have to ask why McGlashan wasn't 
awarded one for Distin locking his arm before being penalised for an arm in 
Howard's face."

Updated at 8.56pm GMT

8.55pm GMT 

52 min: It looked for a minute there that Buzz Killington was going to make 
another appearance but that goal keeps a bit of buzz very nicely.

8.54pm GMT 

GOAL! Cheltenham 1-3 Everton (Penn 51)

What a fantastic response from the League Two side. Mohamed slips the ball 
through to the onrushing Russell Penn and he neatly beats Howard at the near 
post.

8.53pm GMT 

GOAL! Cheltenham 0-3 Everton (Osman 49)

Jombati is guilty of snoozing as Anichebe finds Baines on the left. The rest 
of the Cheltenham back four appeal for offside and Baines should've been, but 
Jombati is sitting too deep. The left-back picks out Osman, who waltzes past a 
tackle and smashes the ball past Brown.

8.51pm GMT 

48 min: Anichebe gets a yard or two of space 30-odd yards from goal. He shapes 
to shoot … you already know this didn't end up in the top corner didn't you?

8.50pm GMT 

47 min: Cheltenham send a long free-kick into the Everton box but the 
visitors, as they have done all night, clear with some ease.

8.49pm GMT 

46 min: I'm sorry Philip Woolf but TOMMY NUTMEG? My mind is blown.

8.48pm GMT 

PEEP! Off we go again, then. It's a long way back from here for Cheltenham, 
but they stuck to their task well after that second goal.

8.46pm GMT 

The results are in:

This is like the Ballon d'Or all over again. Only with less Blatter. And more 
singing. The correct answer is, of course, MEGS.

POLL RESULTS: NUTS 40% MEGS 60%

Armed with the results of this survey I will make sure I tell the bloke who 
shouts NUTS at my five-a-side that he is at least two-fifths wrong. And, we 
should also make clear, anyone who shouts MEGSY – I'm looking at you Dan 
Shepherd – is clearly a dangerously unstable heretic.

Updated at 8.47pm GMT

8.42pm GMT 

Half-time memory lane dept.

"Well, now living Stateside I can only catch The Robins 'live' whenever we 
come home, but assuming this game is now looking a bit dodgy, I fondly look 
back on Cheltenham Town v Abergavenny, FA Cup 2nd (I think) Qualifying Round 
replay from 1969," writes Ian Roberts. "It was a cool Autumn evening and the 
terraces stank of cigarette smoke as we grasped our plastic cups filled with 
steaming hot Horlicks. Great memories indeed. Oh, we won that game 3-2." What a 
lovely email. A few more like that please.

8.34pm GMT 

PEEP! PEEP! And that's the break. Quick point of order: just before the 
whistle Baines nutmegged his marker. When this happens and you're on the pitch 
do you shout MEGS or NUTS? There's no right or wrong answer* – it's just a 
quick straw poll.

*PLEASE NOTE: There is a right or wrong answer.

8.31pm GMT 

45 min: Can Cheltenham get back into this before the break? Not like that they 
can't – Pack launches a big booming long throw into the box … which Howard 
catches comfortably.

8.29pm GMT 

43 min: McGlashan, the home side's best outlet thus far, clatters Baines in 
the Cheltenham right-back position and is a little lucky to escape a booking. 
The free-kick comes to diddly squat.

8.28pm GMT 

42 min: This game is drifting gently and inoffensively towards half-time now. 
Like a Lighthouse Family album track.

8.26pm GMT 

40 min: Everton have taken their foot off the gas here. Fellaini glances a 
header well wide.

8.24pm GMT 

38 min: "Two-nil and you still don't sing!" chant a few home fans towards the 
away end. Would carry more weight if more than 20-odd Cheltenham fans were 
letting their voices be heard.

8.23pm GMT 

37 min: … beautifully swerved in by Jones again, but then booted out of the 
ground – literally* – by Distin.

*Not all that impressive really. There's only a dozen rows of terrace on that 
portion of the ground.

8.22pm GMT 

35 min: McGlashan ends up as the meat in a Baines and Fellaini sandwich. A 
free-kick is the result. Dangerous one this …

8.19pm GMT 

34 min: … Elliott gets on the end of this one but can only loop the ball up 
into the air. Howard is under a bit of pressure, but Jombati has an arm on the 
goalkeeper. Free-kick.

8.19pm GMT 

33 min: … Jones swings the ball in. Nodded clear by Jelavic and out for 
another …

8.18pm GMT 

32 min: Marlon Pack gets Goulding away down the right channel then receives 
the ball back. Fellaini gets back to deflect the shot over. Corner …

8.17pm GMT 

31 min: Fellaini extends like Optimus Prime on the edge of the box to slap a 
shot at goal, but his effort crashes into the hoardings a yard or two wide.

8.16pm GMT 

29 min: Optimism/pessimism here. "I can't say I am massively impressed with 
the penalty decision, it was soft," writes Duncan Smith. "And from an 
Evertonian perspective, I would much rather have had one of the many less soft 
ones in the league! Also the Robins have played fairly well at times, they've 
made some half chances, it's not totally dead I don't think."

8.15pm GMT 

28 min: Stuart Pearce is at Whaddon Road, wearing a grey scarf with orange 
trim. That is all.

8.13pm GMT 

26 min: Jombati surges through midfield with the ball and he finds Carter in 
the area. His volley loops off towards Tewkesbury.

8.10pm GMT 

24 min: Mark Yates is clearly not happy at that penalty decision. I can't 
quite make my mind up about it. Fellaini stood there and allowed Bennett to 
topple over him. Or did Bennett push forward on to the Everton man? Ach, these 
things even themselves out, etc and so forth, but it's a galling way for 
Cheltenham to go two down.

8.08pm GMT 

22 min: Buzz Killington has definitely arrived.

8.07pm GMT 

GOAL! Cheltenham 0-2 Everton (Baines 21)

Brown goes the right way but Baines arrows his shot past the keeper. This is 
all over isn't it?

8.06pm GMT 

20 min: PENALTY! Bennett climbs over a standing Fellaini in an attempt to win 
a header and the referee points to the spot. One of those ones you occasionally 
seen given near halfway, but very rarely in the box.

8.05pm GMT 

19 min: Superb save! Baines gets to line up a free-kick, 30-odd yards from 
goal and sends a vicious dipping effort towards Scott Brown's top corner. The 
Cheltenham keeper reacts wonderfully to claw the ball away.

Updated at 8.07pm GMT

8.03pm GMT 

18 min: Carter again gets space on the edge of the box, but this time his shot 
is comfortably saved by Howard.

8.03pm GMT 

17 min: … a zipping, flat delivery is well dealt with by the Everton and 
backline and Carter fails to make contact on the edge of the box.

8.02pm GMT 

16 min: McGlashan does brilliantly to keep Jones's deep cross in and wins a 
free-kick off Baines. Free-kick, five yards from the corner flag …

8.01pm GMT 

15 min: This really should be 2-0. Fellaini nods down a high ball from the 
back, Jelavic is again first onto it, but this time he drags a volley wide of 
goal.

8.00pm GMT 

14 min: Russell Penn has hurt himself challenging Fellaini here. The magic 
sponge seems to have done it's work, though.

8.00pm GMT 

13 min: That might prove to be a bigger buzz kill than Buzz Killington.

7.58pm GMT 

GOAL! Cheltenham 0-1 Everton (Jelavic 12)

Oviedo exchanges neat passes with Fellaini on the left and the Belgian swings 
in a superb effort at goal that beats Brown but clatters back off the post. 
Jelavic is quickest to react to the rebound and prods the ball home.

7.57pm GMT 

11 min: Jelavic nods down, Oviedo shoots from the edge of the box, but it's 
weaker than orange squash made with a thimble of cordial and a litre of water.

7.56pm GMT 

10 min: Oviedo picks the pocket of Bennett but can't make the best of a 
promising position.

7.55pm GMT 

8 min: Seamus Coleman goes long from the right-back position, but Cheltenham 
nod clear. The home side have settled a touch now.

7.52pm GMT 

6 min: Cheltenham work the ball down the left with Mohamed to the fore. My 
memories of him from Wembley last season was that he was a livewire, a real 
threat, but that is final ball tended to be poor. He finds Carter with a yard 
of space but the former Birmingham man prods wide.

7.51pm GMT 

5 min: Oviedo lays the ball of to Fellaini but the big Belgium drags his shot 
a couple of yards wide.

7.50pm GMT 

4 min: Another long punt bounces through to Howard. Looks like Town want to 
get it forward quickly tonight, which is perfectly understandable.

7.48pm GMT 

3 min: McGlashan charges down Distin's clearance … with his elbow. He looks 
peeved, but he's bang to rights.

7.48pm GMT 

2 min: A long punt from Brown bounces all the way through to Howard.

7.47pm GMT 

1 min: Poor old Cheltenham. Every time they get any media attention it's all 
"novices, throughbreads, stayers" and so on and so forth. ESPN not choosing any 
off-piste route tonight.

7.45pm GMT 

PEEP! Off we go then. Everton in blue, Cheltenham in their deep red and white 
stripes.

7.41pm GMT 

Click-clack, click-clack … the teams emerge from the cramped tunnel at Whaddon 
Road.

7.39pm GMT 

Our man at Whaddon Road is chief football writer Daniel Taylor, who'll be 
watching a game of one half …

7.32pm GMT 

For any Cheltenham fans reading I feel I must apologise. The curse of the 
Guardian Football League blog struckafter this piece 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league-blog/2011/nov/03/cheltenham-town-league-two>
 on the Robins and they ended up missing out in the League Two play-off final 
to a Nick Powell-inspired Crewe. That piece does have a lovely stat in it 
though: bBetween 1992-93 and 1998-99 Cheltenham finished (deep breath) 2nd, 
2nd, 2nd, 3rd, 2nd, 2nd and 1st in various leagues. Imagine being a kid and 
going to your first game at Whaddon Road in 1992! What has come since will have 
been something of a let down I suppose.

7.26pm GMT 

The teams are in:

Cheltenham: Brown, Jombati, Bennett, Elliott, Jones, McGlashan, Pack, Carter, 
Mohamed, Penn, Goulding. Subs: Roberts, Lowe, Hooman, Deering, Duffy, Harrad, 
Taylor.
Everton: Howard, Coleman, Jagielka, Distin, Baines, Neville, Osman, Anichebe, 
Fellaini, Oviedo, Jelavic. Subs: Mucha, Naismith, Hitzlsperger, Gueye, Barkley, 
Vellios, Duffy.
Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire)

No doubt David Moyes is taking this seriously (is it me or has there been an 
increase in managers-taking-the-Cup-seriously this year?) Of the team that 
started against Newcastle John Heitinga, Steven Piennar and Steven Naismith are 
out, with Seamus Coleman, Bryan Oviedo and Victor Anichebe coming in.

Updated at 7.34pm GMT

7.11pm GMT 

Evening all. Are you well? Good, good. Me? Can't complain I suppose. But the 
big question is can Cheltenham spring another FA Cup shock? The weekend wasn't 
great for them. This was the story of their Sunday:

On the eve of the biggest match in their history, Cheltenham 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/cheltenham> Town's training ground has been 
burgled.

Thieves struck on Sunday morning at the club's training ground in the Swindon 
Village area of Cheltenham, stealing wallets, watches and mobile phones worth 
thousands of pounds. On Monday night, the League Two club take onEverton 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/everton> in the FA Cup 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa-cup> third-round.

The Cheltenham striker Darryl Duffy took to Twitter to vent his frustration at 
the theft of his mobile phone and said he would buy it back given the chance. 
He wrote: "It was stolen from me, it's white and has all my pics/videos of my 
kids in it so it means a lot to me. Cannot stand thieves."

Between 10.45am and midday on Sunday, thieves entered the training rooms at 
the site. Keys to two vehicles parked outside were also taken and the cars 
entered. Wallets were taken from inside.

The thefts were reported to Gloucestershire Police at 12.30pm and at around 
4pm officers arrested two 17-year-old boys on suspicion of theft. They have 
been bailed to return to Cheltenham police station on 13 February.
