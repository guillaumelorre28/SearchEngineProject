, forcing a match interruption.

The German football association said Schmidt had shown “continued unsporting 
behaviour” in Leverkusen’s 1-0 defeat to Borussia Dortmund on Sunday, adding 
another two matches to his three-match ban. He is also banned from the changing 
rooms and any area used by players during matches.

Schmidt was sent to the stands for dissent by the referee, Felix Zwayer, after 
Dortmund had taken the lead but the coach refused to leave despite repeated 
efforts.

He wanted to be told of the reasons for his dismissal, refusing to go even 
after the Leverkusen captain Stefan Kiessling told him to, pacing down the 
sideline and shouting “why, why?”

It was only after Zwayer interrupted the game for nine minutes, sending the 
teams into the changing rooms, that Schmidt left the technical area and walked 
up to the stands, allowing the game to resume.

Schmidt, who has since apologised for his behaviour, has accepted the verdict.
