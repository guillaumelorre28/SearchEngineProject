Britain’s oldest manufacturing business, a London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> bell foundry that made Big Ben, could 
be sold after its owner decided to vacate its historic East End premises.

The Whitechapel Bell Foundry began life in 1570 during the reign of Elizabeth 
I. It moved to its site on Whitechapel Road in 1739 and has traded from the 
building since.

The Guinness Book of Records lists the foundry, one of only two left in the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/20/how-do-i-become-a-bellmaker>, as 
Britain’s oldest manufacturer – having traded continuously for 446 years.

The foundry has been owned by the Hughes family since 1904. Alan Hughes and 
his wife Kathryn have sold the grade II-listed building on Whitechapel Road and 
are considering options for when the foundry leaves in May 2017.


Alan Hughes said: “We have made this decision with a heavy heart, but in 
response to the changing realities of running a business of this kind. The 
business has been at its present site over 250 years so it is probably about 
time it moved once again. We hope that this move will provide an opportunity 
for the business to move forward in a new direction.”

Property prices in Whitechapel have soared in recent years because the area, 
once infamous for the Jack the Ripper murders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/16/newspapers-national-newspapers>
, is close to the capital’s financial district and is a favourite spot for 
growing technology companies.

The foundry’s owners are considering a sale that could keep it operating from 
new premises.

In 1752, the foundry cast the Liberty Bell for the city of Philadelphia, which 
became a symbol of US independence. In 1856, it made Big Ben, although the bell 
cracked while being tested and was recast in 1858.

More recently, the Whitechapel team designed the bell used at the start of the 
2012 London Olympics but the 23-tonne structure was too big for its furnaces 
and was cast in the Netherlands.The foundry cast the bells used on the lead 
barge for the Queen’s Jubilee pageant on the Thames, also in 2012.

Specialist sales – largely church bells and musical handbells – have formed 
the bulk of recent business and the foundry launched an online store selling 
handbells and doorbells to consumers three years ago
