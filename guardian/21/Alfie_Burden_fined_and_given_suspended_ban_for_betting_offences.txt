Alfie Burden has been fined £5,000 and given a six-month suspended ban by the 
World Professional Billiards andSnooker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/snooker> Association for breaking betting 
rules.

The 40-year-old, who turned professional in 1994, was found to have placed 
around 50 bets via an online firm between 30 September 2006 and 4 February 
2010, while also placing five bets involving his own matches – all backing him 
to win – as part of an accumulator between 30 September 2006 and 22 November 
2007.

The WPBSA also found Burden had placed 36 bets on snooker matches with another 
online betting operator between 5 July 2013 and 29 November 2016, which did not 
involve himself although included tournaments he was playing in.

Burden admitted to the breach of the betting rules, which were tightened from 
August 2009, “at an early stage”, according to the WPBSA, which added that 
there was no suggestion whatsoever the player was “doing anything to influence 
match outcomes or engaged in any corrupt activity”.

It was revealed Burden’s betting on snooker had been “largely unsuccessful”, 
with the WPBSA disclosing he had gambled a total of £25,003.03 and had returned 
losses of £2,995.27.

The six-month sanction imposed by the WPBSA is suspended in full until 
1 January 2018 and will be invoked only on another breach of the betting rules.

The chairman of the WPBSA, Jason Ferguson, said: “It is a key part of any 
sports integrity strategy that players cannot bet on their sport. Alfie Burden 
put his career at risk by so doing and it is only through his full admissions 
and his co-operation with the disciplinary committee that he has avoided a 
career-ending suspension.”
