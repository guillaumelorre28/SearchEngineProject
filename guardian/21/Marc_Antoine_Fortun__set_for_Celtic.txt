Marc-Antoine Fortuné is on the verge of signing for Celtic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> and may be followed by his Nancy 
team-mate Landry N'Guemo. Fortuné arrived in Glasgow for a tour of Celtic's 
training and stadium facilities on Monday and talks have apparently progressed 
well.

The Guyanese-born forward is expected to tie up a transfer of around £3.8m in 
the next 24 hours, snubbing several teams in the Premier League. Celtic have 
also discussed a deal to sign the Cameroon midfielder N'Guemo andNancy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nancy> expect him to follow Fortuné to 
Glasgow.

In a statement Nancy said: "Unless there is a turnaround in the situation 
Marc-Antoine Fortuné will soon sign for Celtic. He visited the club's 
facilities on Monday and could quickly be transferred. He will probably be 
joined by Landry N'Guemo, who will be the subject of a one-season loan."

The capture of Fortuné would represent an impressive coup for Tony Mowbray as 
at least three English top-flight clubs had made offers to the player.

Hull City initially looked favourites to sign the 28-year-old and Portsmouth 
and Fulham followed with concrete bids. West Ham were among a number of other 
Premier League clubs to be linked with the player, who scored five goals for 
West Brom after being signed on loan by Mowbray in January.
