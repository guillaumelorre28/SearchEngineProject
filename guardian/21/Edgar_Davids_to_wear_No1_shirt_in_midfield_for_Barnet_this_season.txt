coach since December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/21/edgar-davids-stay-barnet> –

After wearing No1 during Barnet's 4-1 friendly defeat to MK Dons on Saturday, 
Davids told Barnet's Times newspaper 
<http://www.times-series.co.uk/sport/10576603.Edgar_Davids__Barnet_s_number_one/?ref=mr>
 he had made the shirt his own. "That is my number for the season. I am going 
to start this trend."

Barnet's goalkeeper Graham Stack, who will wear No29, told the paper: "Squad 
numbers mean nothing to me and I've had a few over the years. So it is not an 
issue for me. Edgar Davids has asked to wear number one, he asked me what 
number I want and I said I didn't mind.

"I spoke to Mick McCarthy [the Ipswich Town manager] last weekend and he said 
that he's had many number ones or nines on the bench. So I don't think it 
matters what you wear. All that matters is that you are in the team and 
playing."
