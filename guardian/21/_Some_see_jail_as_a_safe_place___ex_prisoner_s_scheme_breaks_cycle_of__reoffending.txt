Ex-prisoner Ken Denton had a “vision” of how to stop the cycle of repeat 
offending while inside, working as a volunteer with inmates awaiting release. 
Now that insight has been turned into a prisoner greeting scheme for men 
leaving HMPLeeds <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/leeds> that is attracting 
attention across the UK.

The simple fact is that Denton’s scheme – meeting newly-released prisoners at 
the prison gates and supporting them at New Wortley community centre, within 
sight of the prison – works.

Of the 80 or so men who have participated in the scheme since July 2016, only 
two have been sent back to prison, whereas West Yorkshire’s overall reoffending 
rate is 34%.

“There was nothing out there for them,” Denton says, describing the moment he 
first realised that many prisoners awaiting release were terrified rather than 
excited. “Some of them see prison as a safe place, but we have to show them 
that there is another way. That’s when I decided I wanted to do something to 
help.”

The 51-year-old, who was released in July 2015 having served 16 years for 
fraud and threats to prison staff, had already made contact with the community 
centre while working for a charity on day release to prepare for his own exit. 
Centre manager Bill Graham immediately saw the potential in Denton’s idea.

Life can be bleak in New Wortley, overshadowed by the prison’s Victorian 
turrets and dominated by four multistorey blocks, which were until recently 
no-go areas rife with drugs. More people are registered disabled, there are 
more lone parents and life expectancy is 12 years below more affluent areas of 
west Leeds. Around 18% of the populationis on benefits

.

There’s no stigma here – everyone knows someone who has been in prison or 
they’ve been in themselves.
Bill Graham 
Graham had a hunch the Offender Support Team would work: “I knew we had the 
right atmosphere here. There’s no stigma – everyone knows someone who has been 
in prison or they’ve been in themselves. People’s main complaint was that they 
felt unsafe.”

Something needed to be done for the prisoners and the community centre could 
provide the positive focus and necessary resources in this pocket of 
deprivation.

“New Wortley is very similar to being in prison,” reflects Graham. “People do 
not feel supported, they do not have the chance to get out and a lot of people 
feel trapped.”

Using the community centre as the base, Denton and his team – one an 
ex-prisoner and two who have been in the criminal justice system – meet an 
inmate at the prison gates, having fixed his accommodation, benefits and 
arranged some kind of occupation. They give him a meal, then take him to his 
first probation appointment and ensure that he is happy with his release plan.

Most of the work has been done before release. Denton’s Offender Support Team 
– assisted by eight volunteers – goes into the prison every Friday for the 
“resettlement market”, where prisoners awaiting release can go to prepare. The 
team identifies prisoners in need of assistance and begins working with them 
months in advance.

Once out, released prisoners are supported on a weekly basis. Many volunteer 
on the bike scheme, renovating old cycles for sale or for local residents to 
borrow as part of the community centre’s bid to improve the area’s health. 
Denton’s team has also started working with the Tuesday night youth project, 
talking to youngsters aged between eight and 13 to try to stop them getting 
into trouble.

Denton’s own story is clearly an inspiration to the prisoners he helps. While 
inside he gained an Open University degree in medical science.

The results at New Wortley are eye-catching. Denton has had requests to do 
similar work at New Hall prison in Wakefield, and he is already working with 
Bradford prison and HMP Spring Hill in Buckinghamshire.

How to help prisoners avoid re-offending? ‘You need someone who believes in 
you’

The Offender Support Scheme works because of the community centre, which 
Graham transformed and turned into a safe place for local people. They come for 
hot food, a chat, practical help such as mental health support and assistance 
finding work, or just because they are lonely. The place is staffed mainly by 
locals and generates income from its shop, cafe and laundry service.

It works hand-in-hand with the nearby medical centre, where GP Andrew Sixsmith 
says he sees many ex-prisoners. He has only six minutes to speak to patients, 
who may turn up at the surgery with no food or money. “What can I do?” he says. 
“I have also had patients wanting to commit suicide at my surgery and I know 
that I will not get the statutory suicide teams out easily, but I have walked 
them over to the centre, where somebody there will talk to them and get them 
into the system.”

The community centre’s groundbreaking collaborative work was recently 
recognised by the independent trust Power To Change, which awarded it £215,000 
for refurbishments. It now functions as a health and wellbeing centre, having 
doubled in size.

A strong believer in practical solutions, Graham insists that “if you have 
time to listen to people and to hear about the barriers in their lives you can 
begin to make a difference”.
