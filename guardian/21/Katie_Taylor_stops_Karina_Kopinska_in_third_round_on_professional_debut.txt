Katie Taylor delivered an impressive victory over Poland’s Karina Kopinska 
inside three rounds of her professional debut at Wembley Arena.

The Irishwoman, 30, enjoyed a glittering 15-year amateur career with five 
world titles and six European belts, as well as amemorable Olympic gold medal 
at London 2012

Taylor, who failed in her bid to become double Olympic champion when she lost 
her opening bout in Rio this year, looked determined from the moment she walked 
into the arena to face her 27-year-old opponent.

Kopinska was put on the back foot from the opening bell of the six-round 
super-featherweight contest in London. Taylor looked sharp as she landed a 
series of head shots to immediately force the Pole, who had a record of 14 
defeats from her 24 professional bouts, to retreat.

The one-way traffic continued in the second round, with the Irish boxer 
landing a series of body shots.

With Kopinska cut around her nose and forced on to the ropes as Taylor landed 
a series of telling head shots, it was no surprise to see the referee step in 
to call an end to the contest after 58 seconds of round three.

Taylor is next set to head to Manchester on 10 December as part of the 
undercard of Anthony Joshua’s IBF heavyweight title defence against Eric Molina.

She told Sky Sports 2 after her victory: “It was a privilege to be here on a 
huge night for women’s boxing. The support has been fantastic.

“I have been training so hard, so I have to thank my coach for that, because 
he has got me into fantastic shape. This was my pro debut and the tests are 
only going to get tougher from here.”
