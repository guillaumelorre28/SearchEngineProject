Whether or not Benjamin Jowett 
<http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306857/Benjamin-Jowett>, master of 
Balliol College in the late 19th century, ever did say: "I am the master of 
this college. What I don't know isn't knowledge," it's certain that no one 
individual could possibly make such a remark now. That is one of the reasons 
why watching quiz programmes such asMastermind or University Challenge is not 
quite as much fun as it was when it was assumed that anybody with a decent 
education knew the same things.

We could usually answer some historical questions, some names of classical 
musicians and/or famous paintings, maybe even a few Latin tags – what you could 
call the full Michael Gove syllabus. But now it's hopeless: surely we can't be 
expected to know chemical formulae for medicines? Or the winners in every 
category of the Olympics? And that's even before you get to the vast gulf 
between the popular music culture of one age group and that of another.

Both programmes do have some easy general questions, but the universities 
always include at least one student who knows an extraordinarily abstruse set 
of facts, andMastermind's people do better on their special subjects when 
they've learned everything about something small and difficult on which they 
can be the only expert.

But it's more fun for us when their choice is bigger and easier and we can get 
there, too. And for a short, satisfied time, feel as well informed as they are.
