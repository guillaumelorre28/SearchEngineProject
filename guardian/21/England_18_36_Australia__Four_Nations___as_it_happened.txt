So Australia will play New Zealand in the final at Anfield next Sunday, and on 
that evidence the Kangaroos are going to take some stopping. That’s all from 
me, thanks for reading.

The hosts’ Four Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/four-nations> 
challenge is over. Here is their captainSam Burgess: “It’s quite a disappointed 
the scoreline, we let ourselves down at crucial stages. We missed touch twice 
and that’s a big swing in momentum. I’m really proud of my team for their 
efforts. We’ve probably not done as well as we’ve wanted, so we’ll regroup and 
go again.”

A melee after the try leads to Sam Burgess landing a fist on the side of David 
Klemmer’s head. The replay of the punch on the big screen brings about one of 
the biggest cheers of the day. Klemmer is given a talking to, as is Burgess. “I 
think that might be a red card in most other sports,” points out Jonathan 
Davies on commentary.

Conversion (Widdop) England 12-28 Australia

The try was reviewed after Sam Burgess had attracted a defender with a dummy 
run, but the video referee is happy enough. Widdop adds the two points.

Try! (Widdop) England 10-28 Australia

Some neat handiwork by England, showing their desire to keep playing running 
rugby. It is rewarded with a penalty and they tap for Tom Burgess to run into 
the heart of the Australia defence. From the first tackle they shift it right 
along the 20m line for Gareth Widdop to pick a gap, brush aside Thurston, and 
touch down.

53 min Centre Kallum Watkins shows a lovely skip of the feet to lose three 
Australian defenders and make some metres. Mike Cooper is then tackled under 
the posts on the fifth tackle and Boyd tries a grubber, but fullback Boyd 
anticipates. Three sets in a row well-defended by the Kangaroos.

Greg Inglis is first receiver from the back of a scrum following an 
unfortunate Kallum Watkins knock-on, and he powers through a gap and over the

44 min What a chance for Sam Burgess! England work a lovely move with Josh 
Hodgson selling Australia a couple of dummies before teeing up his captain 
under the posts, but the pass was just out of reach and Burgess could only 
fumble it over the try-line.

42 min Lomax gets involved from fullback and a little shimmy buys England 10 
yards. They string several clever moves together and on the sixth tackle Widdop 
kicks through – Australia will have to start again from their own try-line.

Half-time thoughts

Here’s Aaron Bower, our man at the London Stadium:

It’s a familiar scoreline for England fans with Australia leading at half-time 
– but it’s certainly not been a half without hope for Wayne Bennett’s side. But 
for five minutes before the break, England were much the better side: which 
makes the fact they trail by four points in a game they cannot afford to lose 
hard to swallow.

The positives? England have certainly held their own against the world 
champions and deservedly led via Jermaine McGillvary’s try. But the failure to 
find touch from penalties not once, but twice, throughout the half, is 
something England can ill-afford more of. Against the Kangaroos, it’s the 
little things you do that matter so much.

There’s still cause for hope, but it feels like England have given themselves 
some unncessary work to do.

So Australia will play New Zealand in the final at Anfield next Sunday, and on 
that evidence the Kangaroos are going to take some stopping. That’s all from 
me, thanks for reading.
 
The hosts’ Four Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/four-nations> 
challenge is over. Here is their captainSam Burgess: “It’s quite a disappointed 
the scoreline, we let ourselves down at crucial stages. We missed touch twice 
and that’s a big swing in momentum. I’m really proud of my team for their 
efforts. We’ve probably not done as well as we’ve wanted, so we’ll regroup and 
go again.”
 
England competed brilliantly for half an hour but in the end Australia’s 
quality told.
 
79 min Thurston drags the conversion well wide. 
 
A brilliant leap over the tackler by Valentine Holmes helps him finish 
one-handed by the corner, and it’s yet another score by Australia. New Zealand 
are going to be up against it stopping this side next weekend at Anfield.

Gareth Widdop adds the extras.
 
England pass swiftly across line and when Dugan gets attracted to George 
Williams, a flat pass towards the corner finds Ryan Hall in space to finish.

73 min On the conversion Thurston finally misses a kick – one the easier ones 
that he has had today.
 
A melee after the try leads to Sam Burgess landing a fist on the side of David 
Klemmer’s head. The replay of the punch on the big screen brings about one of 
the biggest cheers of the day. Klemmer is given a talking to, as is Burgess. “I 
think that might be a red card in most other sports,” points out Jonathan 
Davies on commentary.
 
Australia’s Matt Gillett bursts through a couple of tired tackles and 
stretches out an arm to add four more points near the corner.

The try was reviewed after Sam Burgess had attracted a defender with a dummy 
run, but the video referee is happy enough. Widdop adds the two points.
 
Some neat handiwork by England, showing their desire to keep playing running 
rugby. It is rewarded with a penalty and they tap for Tom Burgess to run into 
the heart of the Australia defence. From the first tackle they shift it right 
along the 20m line for Gareth Widdop to pick a gap, brush aside Thurston, and 
touch down.

65 min Greg Inglis, who has been sensational all match, suffers a clash of 
heads and he’s a little groggy. He is taken off for a concussion interchange, 
meaning a minimum of 15 minutes out.
 
63 min Michael Morgan tries a cute kick into the corner and England are forced 
to tap the ball off the pitch – Australia will come again.
 
Six from six by Thurston, and the London Stadium has gone a little quiet. 
 
A brilliant shortside run by Cooper Cronk breaks a tackle before drawing 
fullback Jonny Lomax and releasing Josh Dugan to run in from 20 metres.

A straightforward kick and no mistake by Johnathan Thurston.
 
Inglis crashes through three England tackles with brutal power, and from the 
tackle Australia tee-up Matt Scott to batter his way into Josh Hodgson and over 
the line.
 
53 min Centre Kallum Watkins shows a lovely skip of the feet to lose three 
Australian defenders and make some metres. Mike Cooper is then tackled under 
the posts on the fifth tackle and Boyd tries a grubber, but fullback Boyd 
anticipates. Three sets in a row well-defended by the Kangaroos.
 
51 min Brilliant from Widdop who shuts down a Cronk kick on the sixth tackle 
and then dives on the ball to give England a chance to attack.
 
49 min From the restart James Graham and Sam Thaiday have a huge collision. 
Thaiday is ordered off the field for a concussion check, meaning he won’t be 
back for at least 15 minutes.
 
Thurston makes it four from four, and England’s Four Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/four-nations> hopes are hanging by a thread.
 
Greg Inglis is first receiver from the back of a scrum following an 
unfortunate Kallum Watkins knock-on, and he powers through a gap and over the 
line with two England defenders clinging on.

45 min Hodgson is down with an ankle injury after that move, but after a bit 
of treatment he is back on his feet.
 
44 min What a chance for Sam Burgess! England work a lovely move with Josh 
Hodgson selling Australia a couple of dummies before teeing up his captain 
under the posts, but the pass was just out of reach and Burgess could only 
fumble it over the try-line.
 
42 min Lomax gets involved from fullback and a little shimmy buys England 10 
yards. They string several clever moves together and on the sixth tackle Widdop 
kicks through – Australia will have to start again from their own try-line.
 
Gareth Widdop, guilty of two penalties which failed to reach touch in the 
first half, gets the second under way for England.
 
The players are back on the field and the second half is coming right up. Will 
England recover to reach theFour Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/four-nations> final?
 
Half-time thoughts

Here’s Aaron Bower, our man at the London Stadium:

It’s a familiar scoreline for England fans with Australia leading at half-time 
– but it’s certainly not been a half without hope for Wayne Bennett’s side. But 
for five minutes before the break, England were much the better side: which 
makes the fact they trail by four points in a game they cannot afford to lose 
hard to swallow.

The positives? England have certainly held their own against the world 
champions and deservedly led via Jermaine McGillvary’s try. But the failure to 
find touch from penalties not once, but twice, throughout the half, is 
something England can ill-afford more of. Against the Kangaroos, it’s the 
little things you do that matter so much.

There’s still cause for hope, but it feels like England have given themselves 
some unncessary work to do.
 
An impressive first 30 minutes by England was undone in the last 10, and 
Australia go into the break with a four-point lead.
 
Sam Burgess comes in with a late challenge, perhaps frustrated with the past 
five minutes, and Jonathan Thurston adds the two points.
