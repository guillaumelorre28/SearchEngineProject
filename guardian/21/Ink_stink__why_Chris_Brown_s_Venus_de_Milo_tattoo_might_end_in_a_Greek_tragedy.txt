Exciting times for the Venus de Milo, whose famously unfixed gaze has finally 
alighted somewhere tangible. That place is the right ear of Chris Brown,after 
the R&B star this week had her image tattooed on the back of his head

. Thus, madam’s 2,000-year search for renewed focus comes to an end, as she 
proudly takes her place as a member of #teambreezy.

Or does it? Lost in Showbiz feels obliged to warn Chris that his tattoo may 
end up the first piece of body art subject to a cease-and-desist order. You may 
or may not recall that in 2011, a German magazine doctored a cover image of the 
Venus de Milo to show the sculpture giving the finger, confirming that 
journalists seeking to illustrate the financial crisis are the most shameless 
plunderers of Greek artefacts since Elgin.

This image incensed a collection of Greek lawyers, who somehow had enough time 
on their hands to file suit against the magazine, accusing it ofdefamation and 
insulting a national symbol <http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/12/01/41876.htm>
. (I am imagining these were some of those Greek lawyers who contrive to spend 
more than 100% of their monthly income on debt servicing, thus relieving 
themselves of the obligation to pay tax.) Though the publishers were eventually 
acquitted, this case got all the way to court.

So although Brown’s new inking does not technically constitute a doctoring, 
there may well be Greek lawyers who regard the mere positioning of Venus’s 
visage on Chris’s cranium to constitute an act of cultural vandalism. I don’t 
want to put papers into her valise, but this all has the flavour of an 
impending legal case by Amal Clooney.
