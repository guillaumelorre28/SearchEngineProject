A senior paediatrician whose expert testimony helped wrongly convict Sally 
Clark <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/sally-clark> for the murder of her two 
baby sons today expressed his sorrow over misleading evidence he presented 
during her trial.

Professor Sir Roy Meadow admitted to a disciplinary hearing that his 
inaccurate claim that there was a one in 73 million chance of two cot deaths 
occurring in a family like the Clarks had "misled and confused a lot of people".

The development came as Prof Meadow was cross examined at a General Medical 
Council (GMC) fitness-to-practice hearing in London, which is investigating 
charges of serious professional misconduct against him about his use of 
statistics during Ms Clark's trial.

Asked by Robert Seabrook QC whether the one in 73 million claim had misled 
people, Prof Meadow said: "I think it's self-evident it misled and confused a 
lot of people."

The QC then pressed the retired paediatrician whether it was something he felt 
"profoundly sorry" about. Prof Meadow replied: "Yes it is."

Mr Seabrook said: "Here we are on day 10 of this inquiry and this is the first 
we have heard about your deep anguish and profound concern about what you might 
have done.

"Behind you sits the father of Sally Clark who now has a seven-year-old son 
and this is the first they have ever heard of your apologies for the misuse of 
those statistics. That's very sad isn't it."

Prof Meadow said he had not spoken sooner because of legal advice and 
professional etiquette. He said: "It's been very, very difficult in keeping 
silent."

Prof Meadow denies serious professional misconduct. If found guilty he could 
be struck off the medical register.

The hearing continues.
