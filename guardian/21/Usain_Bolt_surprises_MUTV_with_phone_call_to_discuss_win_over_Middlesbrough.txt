Manchester United’s in-house television channel got a shock when Usain Bolt 
called up to discussthe 2-1 win over Middlesbrough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/31/manchester-united-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report>
.

In the traditional post-match phone-in, the MUTV presenter Mandy Henry 
introduced the next called as being a “Usain from Jamaica” and added: “It’s not
Usain Bolt <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usainbolt> is it?”

Bolt, a triple-triple Olympic champion and the fastest man of all-time, 
replied: “It is Usain Bolt”.

Henry still looked disbelieving as Bolt gave his opinion on United’s win, 
saying: “They came through like the old Manchester United. They came through 
and pushed on and persevered, theManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> way. It was a great 
match, I am very happy about this.”

Bolt then tweeted to confirm it was indeed him, with Henry replying to him 
apologising and telling him to call again soon.
