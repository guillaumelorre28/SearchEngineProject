Across Australia a secretive network of activists are laying the groundwork 
for what they expect will be the biggest environmental protest movement in the 
country’s history.

Of course this won’t materialise if Adani and the rest of the miners proposing 
to open up one of the world’s biggest coalfields walk away from Queensland’s 
Galilee basin first.

But standing idly by on the assumption that the economics of the massive coal 
projects won’t stack up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/06/future-of-carmichael-mine-hinges-not-on-skinks-or-snakes-but-its-business-case>
 – at a time the world is trying to reducecarbon emissions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/12/coal-from-carmichael-mine-will-create-more-annual-emissions-than-new-york>
 to limit global warming to under 2C – is not a choice these activists are 
willing to make.

And so the campaign to take the fight against Australia’s largest proposed 
coalmine, Adani’s Carmichael project, to another level, beyond the courts and 
into the realm of civil disobedience, is under way.

Behind the Galilee Blockade campaign 
<http://galileeblockade.net/eco-warriors/the-campaign/> is a core group of 
activists well versed in the “security culture” required of those intending to 
jam a serious monkey wrench into a major industrial project.

This describes the kind of precautions people take when there’s a very real 
prospect that arrests and charges will follow, as well as police surveillance 
and leaks that could tip off direct-action targets.

They share strategy via encrypted messaging. When meeting to talk specific 
action, phones are left out of the room.

In an era when coercive hearings by crime body “star chambers” 
<http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/cmc-hearings-using-star-chamber-powers-at-record-rate/news-story/fdb2b86f3ee01b9d69783bdbae937205>
 could apply as equally to environmental protesters as to organised crime 
figures, this closely guarded information is being thoughtfully withheld from 
close family.

And amid a public call for volunteers and new activists that has so far 
attracted pledges from more than 11,000 people <http://galileeblockade.net/>, 
including almost 8,000 committed to direct action in their local areas, 
organisers remain alert to the possibility of infiltration by police or others.

Among their ranks already are veterans of emblematic past environmental 
campaigns, those who took part in actions againstthe Franklin dam

Jabiluka uranium mine

and those who sankthe coal seam gas industry in New South Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/18/knitting-nannas-charged-in-nsw-coal-seam-gas-protest>
.

So far criminal defence lawyers in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, the New South 
Wales northern rivers, Newcastle and Tasmania have agreed to be on hand when 
legal support is required.

Among the key organisers of the campaign are two women thousands of kilometres 
apart, who have chosen to remain anonymous.

One of them is an IT specialist with two decades’ experience working for 
government and the corporate sector, whose research skills are said to be 
formidable. A voluminous list of companies and lobbying organisations to be 
targeted in the campaign has been compiled.

Guardian Australia has seen the list, which stretches across every capital 
Australian city through to regional centres and to Africa, South America, Asia 
and Europe.

Some of these targets will be presented this month to grassroots activists, 
who will be invited, with strategic support, to form and execute their own 
specific plans for direct action in their local city or region.

The industry, while not privy to the exact forms these actions will take, 
knows something is coming. A formerQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> Resources Council chief 
executive, Michael Roche, has said he expects protesters would “throw 
everything at Adani’’.

“Even if Adani does move into construction in 2017, experience in NSW suggests 
the campaign against Carmichael will move to a civil disobedience phase, 
testing the resolve of the politicians,’’ hetold the Courier-Mail 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/mining-industry-faces-civil-disobedience-as-protesters-prepare-to-fight-adani-mine/news-story/d1584149568a22b8fb608d1cdfa412a6>
.

One of the more novel future strategies in play involves an arm of the Galilee 
Blockade called “Grandparents for the Galilee”, and comes courtesy of one “grey 
nomad” volunteer who pondered how the mobility of retirees with motorhomes and 
caravans could best be harnessed.

It’s a twist on the proverbial spectacle of the slow-going grey nomad proving 
a frustrating obstacle to others on the highway. Think of the obstructive power 
of 30 motorhomes, or 50 caravans, and the potential for one of the more 
unorthodox direct actions in environmental protest history.

Organisers report a sense among older volunteers that they need not have so 
much concern as their younger peers about the impact on their careers of being 
arrested in an environmental protest.

The public face of the Galilee Blockade is Ben Pennings, a Brisbane-based 
activist of 26 years’ experience and a Greens lord mayoral candidate. He quit 
as one of the party’s elected spokespeople to take up this new role at the 
pointy end of the environmental movement.

Pennings began his career at 18 with Greenpeace, sailed on the Rainbow Warrior 
2 aged 20, and was inducted into the “security culture” of an organisation that 
had its first vessel of that name blown up by French intelligence operatives.

Blockade campaign. Photograph: Michael Warrington 
Despite a long history of involvement in direct action he has never faced 
criminal charges, which he jokes is “a bad look in the environmental activist 
world”.

Pennings says after resistance to the proposed Adani mine in the form of legal 
challenges and lobbying, public campaigns and petitions – including efforts led 
by mainstream non-governmental organisations – the time is right for more 
direct methods of protest.

“The efforts of mainstream NGOs are reasonably predictable, especially when 
they’re large organisations with deductible gift-recipient status or reliant on 
large donor bases,” Pennings says.

“We are not predictable. We can target companies in different ways they don’t 
expect. Some of the NGOs may not be happy with our approach. But we think that 
a diverse movement is a strong movement, an unpredictable movement is a strong 
movement.”

Pennings says there is demand from grassroots activists for this next step, 
with “a ton of people who want nothing to do with NGOs, who only want to do the 
frontline stuff”.

“It’s definitely the time for this strategy. Companies and shareholders 
deserve to know this is what’s going to happen. Investing in the destruction of 
Aboriginal homelands and the reef is going to cost you big time, not only with 
security costs but in regards to insurance, unions, the lot.

“The coal industry has already lost their PR war about the Great Barrier Reef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/great-barrier-reef>. People will fight 
to protect it.”

Investing in the destruction of Aboriginal homelands and the reef is going to 
cost you big time
Ben Pennings 
Organisers, who are funding the costs of the campaign through their own 
pockets, plan to target not just Adani but also “key Adani contractors, right 
down the line”, he says.

“If you’re in bed with Adani in any major way, you’re a target,” Pennings 
says. “If you’re a major contractor, you’re a target. If you’re providing 
finance, you’re a target. If you’re looking to provide finance, you’re a 
target.”

Pennings is at pains to point out that the Galilee Blockade is “not 
Australia’s Standing Rock”.

Standing Rock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/08/standing-rock-dakota-pipeline-transformation-stories>
 involved large-scale protests against an oil pipeline on the site of Sioux 
traditional tribal lands in the US last year, where security used attack dogs 
and police used water cannons on protesters.

The site of the proposed Carmichael mine, inland from Bowen, is the 
traditional land ofthe Wangan and Jagalingou people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/13/adani-carmichael-mine-opponents-join-indigenous-climate-change-proect>
. It is remote and inaccessible.

“It’s not our business [to be there], it’s the traditional owners’,” Pennings 
says.

“We respect their right to take legal steps to protect their land 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/07/indigenous-owners-launch-fresh-legal-challenge-to-adanis-carmichael-mine>
. There is no way we would even consider going on site, unless we were invited. 
But there’s no plan for a single person to go up there.”

Instead, the plan is for the campaign front to take form through a vast array 
of localised acts of protest. “You won’t have to go interstate, you won’t have 
to travel back there for court if you’re arrested,” Pennings says. “You can do 
it in a group with friends, repeatedly, in local blockades.”

It’s a strategy drawn from the playbook of successful activists elsewhere, 
notably those campaigning against animal testing in the US.

“They’re pretty full-on. They’ve gone as far as to target the people who 
supply the toilet paper,” Pennings says.

He says the idea is to make clear to companies involved that “it’s going to 
cost them, in security, insurance, and the unions are going to freak out”.

The group is determined to shun reckless acts that will put anyone in harm’s 
way but “people will get arrested, people will get charged”.

Board members and executives have to be made responsible for their actions
Ben Pennings 
A taste of what actions might be to come can be glimpsed in the previous 
campaign targeting the coal rail company Aurizon over its plans to invest 
$2.6bn in GVK’s Alpha venture when that looked the mine most likely to open up 
the Galilee.

That campaign, “Over our dead bodies” 
<https://damnthematrix.wordpress.com/tag/over-our-dead-bodies/>, involved 
everything from hunger strikes, flagging plans to stop coal trains with 
cardboard boxes on tracks, through to Christmas stockings full of coal 
delivered to executives’ homes.


“Board members and executives have to be made responsible for their actions,” 
Pennings says. “Saying I didn’t know or I was just following orders doesn’t cut 
it. We’re talking about runaway climate change threatening hundreds of millions 
of lives.”

Pennings and others bought shares in Aurizon and attended its annual general 
meeting, where they asked discomfiting questions for the board regarding the 
costs to shareholders of becoming a target of activists, through the need for 
extra security, insurance, industrial action and recruitment costs.

He was greeted by name on the way into the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition 
Centre by anti-terrorism police, who he says were there for a small “dry run” 
for the G20 meeting at the same venue the following year.

Pennings says it is his hope that an unprecedented protest movement is 
ultimately not required and that Galilee mining plans that would create “an 
environmental and human catastrophe” come to nought.

But if they come closer to fruition, Pennings says he has “no doubt” the 
direct action campaign will be the largest in Australian history.

“This is going to dwarf the Franklin blockade. That’ll be nothing.”

Guardian Australia has contacted Adani for comment.
