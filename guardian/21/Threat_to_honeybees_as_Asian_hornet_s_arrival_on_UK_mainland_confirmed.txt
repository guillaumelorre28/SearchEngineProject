The Asian hornet’s long-feared arrival on the UK mainland has been confirmed, 
government scientists have said, with ecologists warning of dire consequences 
for honeybees if the species is not swiftly eliminated.

The hornets eat honeybees and have become widespread in central and southern 
France, promptingwarnings in recent years

 that they could arrive in the UK via potted plants from France.


While not considered a threat to humans, the arrival of the hornets add to the 
woes of Britain’s honeybees, which are vital for pollination of many crops but
have been suffering declines for decades

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said on Tuesday 
that it had a confirmed sighting of an Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) in the 
Tetbury area of Gloucestershire. Officials said efforts were already under way 
to destroy the invasive species, using cameras and traps to locate nests before 
attempting to kill them off with pesticides.

Nicola Spence, Defra’s deputy director for plant and bee health, said: “We 
have been anticipating the arrival of the Asian hornet for some years and have 
a well-established protocol in place to eradicate them and control any 
potential spread.


“It is important to remember they pose no greater risk to human health than a 
bee, though we recognise the damage they can cause to honeybee colonies. That’s 
why we are taking swift and robust action to identify and destroy any nests.”

Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of the charity Buglife, said: “It’s really 
bad news. The ecological impact is that it potentially affects our ability to 
feed ourselves in the future.

“In terms of threats to people, as long as it doesn’t reach ridiculous levels 
of abundance, which it will struggle to do because there is not enough prey 
here for it, then it shouldn’t really add risk in terms of number of people who 
die from wasp stings.”

The hornets were first found in Jersey and Alderney over the summer, with 
beekeepers hoping they would be unable to cross the channel. But the 
confirmation that they have reached the mainland will put beekeepers on alert.


A spokeswoman for the British Beekeepers Association (BBKA) said: “They will 
be a real threat to our ability to keep our colonies going. The first sighting 
is an important event for us, because we’ll have to start making traps.

“Asian hornets have a horrible habit of hanging around a hive entrance and 
then as soon as a bee comes out, they’ll bite their head off. A number of them 
will do that until all the bees are dead, and then go in and take their honey.”


Tim Lovett, director of public affairs at the BBKA, said the sighting was “not 
good news for honeybees”, adding: “What happens next in terms of containment 
measures will be vital and we look to Defra to implement the contingency plans 
to deal with this invasion of a non-native species.”

Defra’s science wing, Fera, says that the primary effect of the hornet’s 
predation is the death of adult worker honeybees, warning that “just a handful 
of hornets can destroy an entire … nest in a couple of hours”. While certain 
honeybees have defence strategies to reduce damage, including forming a mass of 
bees around the hornet, raising the temperature to a lethal 45C, Fera says the 
European honeybee is less effective at this “heat-balling”.

In terms of the risk to humans, Shardlow said: “This is a fairly big wasp. 
Generally the bigger they are, the less aggressive they are. There are no 
bigger threat to humans than the wasps we already have.”


One live hornet and one dead one were spotted by government experts but as yet 
no nests. The National Bee Unit in North Yorkshire is conducting DNA tests on 
the dead hornet in an attempt to discover how it arrived in the UK. Government 
experts believe the species will be unable to survive the colder winters in the 
north of the UK.
