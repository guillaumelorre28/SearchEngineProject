Bendtner made 47 appearances for Wolfsburg after joining from Arsenal in 2014, 
scoring nine goals, but his contract was terminated a season early after a 
troubled campaign in which he was fined for oversleeping and missing training 
among other indiscretions.

Forest have made a good start to the season under their new manager, Philippe 
Montanier, and are seventh thanks, in part, to two 4-3 victories over Burton 
and Wigan. The French coach has fielded a remarkably young side but is looking 
to add experience to his strikeforce.

Bendtner, 28, made 108 appearances for Arsenal in nine years from 2005 and 
made his first senior appearance for Denmark as an 18 year old. In March last 
year he scored a hat-trick for in a 3-2 friendly defeat of the United States.
