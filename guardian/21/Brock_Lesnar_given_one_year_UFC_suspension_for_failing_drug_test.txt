Lesnar’s win over Mark Hunt at UFC 200 on 9 July will also be overturned to a 
no contest.

WWE star Lesnar, who returned to the Octagon this year after five years away, 
tested positive for anti-estrogen drugs clomiphene and hydroxy-clomiphene in an 
out-of-competition drug sample collected on 28 June. He also tested positive 
when a second sample was taken on the night of his fight against Hunt.

The fine represents about 10% of the $2.5m purse Lesnar received for the July 
match-up, which he originally won by unanimous decision.

The Nevada state athletic commission met on Thursday, and unanimously agreed 
to the suspension and fine.

Lesnar had fought in UFC for three years between 2008 and 2011, but retired 
after defeat by Alistair Overeem at UFC 141. He was allowed to return for UFC 
200 this year in “a one-off opportunity” before going back to WWE for 
SummerSlam in August.

There’s been no word on whether Lesnar will fight again in UFC; with a 
one-year ban in place, he wouldn’t be eligible to compete until 9 July 2017.

Nate Diaz was also fined $50,000 plus 50 hours of community service for a 
melee involving Conor McGregor at UFC 202.
