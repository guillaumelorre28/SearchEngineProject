Everton held talks with the Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> defender Mason Holgate on 
Wednesday in their attempt to beat Bournemouth and several other Premier League 
clubs to the signing of the highly rated 18-year-old.

Holgate, who had a trial with Manchester United this summer, met Everton 
officials at the club’s training ground after a deal worth an initial £1m was 
agreed with the League One side. The teenager would followJohn Stones

in moving from Oakwell to Goodison Park should he become Roberto Martínez’s 
third signing of an otherwise frustrating summer.

Bournemouth had hoped to seal the signature of Holgate, who made 22 
appearances in his breakthrough campaign for Barnsley last season and can 
operate at right-back or in central defence. But the newcomers were informed 
the Doncaster-born defender was set on a move toEverton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> before they could open talks.

Arsenal and Aston Villa have also been linked with Holgate this summer, 
although the Goodison club could conclude his transfer within 48 hours.
