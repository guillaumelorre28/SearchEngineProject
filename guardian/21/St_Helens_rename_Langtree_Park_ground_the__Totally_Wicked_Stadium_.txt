Totally Wicked, a company based in the north-west of England, has sponsored St 
Helens’ north stand since 2013 but will take principal naming rights for the 
stadium at the start of next year as part of a new and expanded agreement.

Saints follow in the footsteps of other clubs to hand over stadium naming 
rights to their sponsors.

Some of the more quirky ground names include Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, home 
to the Colorado Rapids in Major League Soccer, while Ireland’s Drogheda 
United’s ground is known as Hunky Dorys Park.

The St Helens <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sthelens> chairman, Eamonn 
McManus, said: “Totally Wicked has been a loyal and valuable supporter and 
sponsor of Saints for the last four years.

“For the club, this new increased sponsorship deal was a natural development 
of an already established relationship that has been of tremendous benefit to 
the club, not just financially, but also in supporting our wider health 
objectives.

“The club plays an active role not only in sport, but also in health and 
education, and over the last four years of working with Totally Wicked, we have 
been able to create a supportive and vape friendly atmosphere at the club.

“We believe this new deal will further this pioneering work by not only 
helping to raise awareness yet further of the damage smoking tobacco can do 
[but] also in deterring people from taking on the habit in the first place.”

St Helens have played their home matches at the 18,000-capacity Langtree Park 
for the past five seasons after ending a 120-year association with Knowsley 
Road.
