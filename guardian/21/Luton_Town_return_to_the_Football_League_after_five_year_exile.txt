Five years after being relegated from the Football League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league>, Luton Town's exile is 
finally over after Cambridge United's 2-0 defeat to Kidderminster confirmed 
John Still's side as Conference Premier champions.

The result means Luton now have an unassailable 10-point lead over Cambridge 
with only three games to play.

Luton were a Championship club in 2007 but suffered three successive 
relegations in as many years after a series of financial setbacks saw them 
deducted 10 points in 2007-08 and then a total of 30 points the following 
season.

They were taken over by a consortium fronted by the TV presenter Nick Owen in 
2008 but have since gone through five managers in an attempt to regain their 
league status. But despite losing 3-2 at home to Braintree on Saturday, 
Cambridge's defeat means Still has now taken three clubs out of non-league, 
having accomplished it in 1989 with Maidstone and in 2007 with Dagenham & 
Redbridge.

"It is wonderful to be back in the Football League," said Owen. "It's taken us 
five seasons, we've got close and lost some play-off finals and it is such a 
relief to get back there. We have got a good side and played some lovely 
football this season. We have some youngsters who will only get better.

"I nearly went to Kidderminster but decided there was something not quite 
right about going to a game hoping a team would lose. It's a great moment for 
tens of thousands of fans in Luton and around the world."
