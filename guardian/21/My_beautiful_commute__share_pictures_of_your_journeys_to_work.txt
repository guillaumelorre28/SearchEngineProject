It may be cold and dark on the daily journey to and from work, but early 
mornings and dusky evenings can be lovely at this time of year. Trees against a 
dawn sky, a view down the Thames at twilight or a frosty field through a train 
window, we’re looking for pictures of your beautiful commute.

Share your photos and videos with us and we’ll feature a selection of our 
favourites on the Guardian site. Be sure to tell us where you’ve taken the 
picture and why you like it.

Though we’d like to hear from you, your safety and the safety of others are 
most important. Please remember the law when thinking about taking a photograph.
