Having abandoned our bikes by the gate, we follow a cattle trodden path 
between walls of bracken down to where field meets sand. The silver slip of a 
beach is postcard perfect, a flawless bleached-bone white. But close up it is 
busy with the telltale trails of recent visitors: speechmark hoofprints of 
cattle and the flatfoot waddle of whooper swans, each webbed imprint as large 
as my palm.

No people, though, which was our aim. We set up camp upon a grassy flat, and 
wander along the foreshore, picking through tidewrack and pocketing curios:a 
mermaid’s purse

, torn and discarded, scraps of net, pebbled glass.

The tide is low, so we clamber out along the sharp-edged reef. Layers of 
schist split and peel like the shell of an oyster, flecked with bright mustard 
lichen and fragments of crab shell: blood-orange, pink, blue-violet.

The last bit is a scramble. We poke our heads over the top and find ourselves 
face to face with a wet-black creature about the size and shape of apine marten

. It stops stock still to stare. We freeze too, and after a moment it resumes 
its business, unconcerned, and scampers off across the rocks. A wave washes in. 
It dives, and disappears.

But then – there – another. The second clambers from the surf and shakes like 
a dog. This one is lighter in colour, a milky coffee. And another. I realise we 
are sharing our rock with three juvenileotters

. What a joy!

They seem to be having a good time too, gambolling and climbing, splashing and 
paddling and roughhousing, tangles of teeth and sodden fur. I recall Gavin 
Maxwell’s beloved Mijbil: “Boneless, mercurial, sinuous, wonderful … a bird or 
aircraft in acrobatics.”

These animals are enchanting. We watch for what seems like an age, until I 
grow greedy and stand for a better view. Mistake. Little black chirrups a 
warning and they scatter, leaving us alone.

That night we sleep with the tent open. When we wake there is a small bobbing 
head dipping and diving a hundred metres out to sea. But we have learned our 
lesson and stay, soundless and still, in our canvas hide.
