Blackpool have been fined £50,000 by the Football Association following the 
pitch invasion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/02/blackpool-fans-suspend-game-pitch-invasion-protest>
 which caused their final match of last season, against Huddersfield at 
Bloomfield Road, to be abandoned.

The game was halted after 48 minutes when supporters poured on to the pitch in 
protest at the club’s chairman, Karl Oyston. After a sit-in demonstration in 
the centre circle that lasted more than an hour, the referee, Mick Russell, 
called the game off.

An FA statement said: “The FA charge, which the club denied, was for failing 
to control spectators resulting in a pitch incursion which caused Blackpool’s 
game againstHuddersfield <https://www.theguardian.com/football/huddersfield> 
Town to be abandoned.”

The League One <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> club 
were also “severely warned as to future conduct” following an independent 
regulatory commission hearing.

Blackpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/blackpool> were also ordered 
to play their first home competitive game of the 2015-16 season behind closed 
doors, with this sanction suspended for a year.
