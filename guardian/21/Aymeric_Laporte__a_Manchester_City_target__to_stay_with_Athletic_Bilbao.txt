 has signed a new contract with Athletic Bilbao which will tie him to the club 
until the summer of 2020. The 22-year-old Frenchman had been strongly linked 
with City but a statement from Athletic on Monday evening said he was staying 
with the La Liga club.

They added that the release clause would for the defender would be €65m (£52m) 
for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons, increasing to €70m for the two after that.

Laporte, who made his senior Athletic debut in 2012, missed the end of last 
season after suffering a fractured ankle in March while on international duty 
with France Under-21s.

Meanwhile Ilkay Gündogan, the midfielder City signed from Borussia Dortmund 
for £20m

, has said he hopes to be fit before the end of August.

The 25-year-old Germany international will miss the start of the 2016-17 
season after sustaining a knee injury playing for Borussia Dortmund. But he 
told the club’s website: “I hope to be fit by the end of August or first week 
of September. You can’t be absolutely sure and we have to gauge it week by week 
but that’s my target and, if everything goes to plan, it will be August. I may 
miss a couple of matches but that’s fine because I want to be ready for when I 
play my first game.”
