The French sailor celebrated his arrival at the Brittany port of Brest with 
tears and champagne, and said his first priority was catching up on rest after 
weeks of not sleeping for more than three hours at a stretch.

“Right now, I want just one thing: to sleep and let my mind rest. I want to go 
to sleep telling myself: all’s well!”

It the 48 year-old’s fifth attempt to beat the 57-day record set in early 2008 
by fellow Frenchman Francis Joyon. Twice his boat was damaged, and twice he 
broke a record set by Briton Ellen MacArthur but was unable to edge out Joyon.

On his gruelling journey Coville sailed at an average speed of 45km an hour, 
to cover more than 52,000 km,according to sponsor Sodebo 
<http://tour-du-monde.sodebo.com/>, which monitored his trip. 


“With the speeds you reach, you’re always on a razor’s edge,” he told Yachts 
and Yachting <http://www.yachtsandyachting.com/news/193807> website after 
finishing. “Physically, I cannot take it any further … All of this was combined 
with a great deal of fatigue. My sleep deprivation is very real.”

Coville travelled so fast that not only was it the quickest solo trip around 
the world, but the third-fastest journey round the world in any sailing boat. 
The only two crafts to have made the journey faster had crews of 10 and 14 
people, able to work in shifts.

His boat was a 31-metre-long, 21-metre-wide Sodebo Ultim trimaran, a 
three-hulled boat refitted by Coville and a team of designers.

The challenges included 10-metre-high waves in the Indian Ocean, which tossed 
his craft around like a toy. “It is … necessary to accept that, at times, you 
are sailing underwater. Sodebo is big, but in troughs of 10m waves it’s like a 
model yacht,” hetold Yachting World

.

He had internet connection to communicate with a support team that helped him 
monitor the weather and map his routes. He also benefited from unusually good 
weather, after bad luck had set back previous attempts.

“Such weather occurs perhaps once a decade,” Yachting World said in a report 
on his record-breaking trip. “It has taken Coville all these attempts to find 
and make use of it.”
