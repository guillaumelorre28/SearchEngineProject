Your obituary of Rabbi Lionel Blue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/19/rabbi-lionel-blue-obituary> (20 
December), referring to his Thought for the Day broadcasts, says “His thoughts 
were seldom profound”. In fact one of his great gifts was to express profound 
truths in simple and accessible ways. Generations of rabbis, myself included, 
saw him as a great teacher who opened up a world of deep spirituality with a 
light touch, and without taking himself seriously.

in-laws had thrown out my treasured books

, 21 December). Then my thoughts turned to my collection, safely stored 
upstairs, with its Christmas annuals inscribed by grandparents long since gone, 
school prizes and gifts my parents gave each other – and I too cried.

• I understand Victoria Wood making Rafael Behr feel lucky to be British (

feel proud to be English (and undeniably northern).

• I was referred to, affectionately I hope, as a lozzucker by locals when a 
student at York University in the 1960s, which suggests the term had wider 
provenance than the north-west (Letters
