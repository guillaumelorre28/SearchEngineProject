The former Manchester United and West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison is 
training with Wigan before a possible move to the Championship club, the Latics 
manager, Warren Joyce, has confirmed.

The talented 23-year-old has not played a single game for Lazio this season 
and has linked up with one of his former coaches at United, where he was viewed 
as one of the most exciting prospects for generations.

 prevented Morrison from making the grade at Old Trafford and a promising spell 
at West Ham, which was interspersed with loan spells at Birmingham, QPR and 
Cardiff, was ended in 2015 when his deal expired.

Morrison has been unable to fulfil his promise in London or Rome and could be 
given another opportunity to resurrect his career at the DW Stadium under the 
former United reserve manager Joyce.

“Ravel’s obviously not played a lot of football recently,” Joyce told Wigan’s 
official website.

“I know how much of a talent he is from my days at Manchester United. It’s a 
unique opportunity for us really because we’ve got a chance to look at him and 
assess his fitness.

“We know he has talent but it’s all about how quick we can get him up to the 
levels we need him to be at here.

“There were players like Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and the Keanes [Michael and 
Will] coming through at that time, and he was possibly the star player 
ability-wise, so it’s one that’s worth looking at for us so we can assess where 
he is at this stage of his career.”
