“Retirement doesn’t suit Manny right now,” Koncz said of the former 
eight-division world champion.

“Boxing is in his blood. When he trains, it’s like a pressure-release valve. 
You can see a dramatic difference in his mood ... he’s happy. It’s amazing what 
training and fighting does for him.”

Pacquiao (58-6-2) had announced his retirement after defeating Timothy Bradley

 in April and was elected to the Philippines senate in May. His promoter Bob 
Arum announced last month that he would fight again 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/12/manny-pacquiao-will-fight-again-promoter-says>
 in November.

Arum tweeted earlier this week that he would travel to the Philippines for a 
meeting on 10 August to discuss the 37-year-old southpaw’s return.

Koncz, who will also attend the meeting, said the trio were not discussing a 
potential opponent, but whether to stage the bout in Los Angeles or Dubai. 
“That’s the essence of the meeting,” Koncz added. “Not choosing the opponent. 
That’s already been done.”

Pacquiao’s unanimous decision win over Bradley was his first fight in nearly a 
year after his tame loss to Floyd Mayweather. He had said he was bringing the 
curtain down on his career to concentrate on politics and his family.

The 27-year-old Vargas (27-1) beat his fellow American Sadam Ali 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5_Vi0FYzV0> in March to claim the WBO 
welterweight crown and has won 10 of his bouts via a knockout or stoppage, with 
his only defeat coming via a points loss to Bradley in June 2015.
