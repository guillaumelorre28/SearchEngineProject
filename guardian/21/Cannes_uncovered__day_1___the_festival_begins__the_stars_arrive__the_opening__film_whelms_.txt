It’s here! That time of year when a resort town in the south of France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> is littered with actors and people 
who dress up as if they were actors for attention! The starlets are disrobing, 
the broken French is being unleashed and there might even be some films that 
are actually watched or whatever!

Each day we will bring you the latest buzz from the festival, highlighting the 
big movies, the parties we may or may not have been invited to and the stars we 
hopefully get to speak to, without being kindly ordered to let them enjoy their 
steak frites in peace.

As you can see from above, today is essentially the calm before the 
flash-heavy storm, as the festival gets ready for tonight’s opening movie. The 
rickety seats are at the ready for the fans while the paparazzi pen is being 
prepped for the actor-leering rabble. Here’s what’s been happening so far:

After Grace of Monaco opened last year’s festival to a parade of guffaws, this 
year’s choice, French drama La Tête Haute, aka Standing Tall, represents a much 
more stripped back, glamour-free alternative. WhileCatherine Deneuve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/catherinedeneuve> might star, she’s playing a 
judge in a family court, meaning that she’s fitted out like a real person 
(cardigans, etc).

Ahead of tonight’s screening, this morning gave critics their first look at 
the Starred Up-style drama, where a young delinquent faces the error of his 
ways, and the response has been mixed.In his review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/13/la-tete-haute-review-catherine-denueve-cannes-2015>
, Peter Bradshaw called it “refreshingly high-minded”, giving it three stars, 
while others have been, well, kinder than they were to Grace:

STANDING TALL: Serviceable coming of age drama elevated by stellar lead as 
STARRED UP-like troubled youth. Sweetest#Cannes

Decent Cannes opener in Emmanuelle Bercot's Standing Tall. Volcanic perf from 
Rod Paradot, stoic dignity from Catherine Deneuve#Cannes2015

STANDING TALL (Bercot) Like prison food. Healthy, nutritious, flavourless, 
simple. A respectable opener, mind.

Emmanuelle Bercot's Standing Tall was perfectly all right but not the most 
thrilling of openers at#Cannes2015 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cannes2015?src=hash>, even with Catherine Deneuve

<https://twitter.com/muirkate/status/598440240920043520> 
At the press conference after the screening, there was a slightly tense moment 
when director Emmanuelle Bercot was asked why the film wasn’t being shown in 
competition. She said that people would need to ask festival head Thierry 
Frémaux, as she still didn’t understand why it wasn’t up for a prize. Which was 
a bit awkward. Although the lukewarm reviews suggest that it probably wouldn’t 
have been in contention anyway ...

Yesterday saw the members of this year’s jury arrive and pretend to not feel 
awkward on the balcony of the Grand Hyatt Cannes Hotel Martinez while 
photographers snapped away. It’s a varied bunch this year, with the Coen 
brothers residing over a group that includesJake Gyllenhaal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jake-gyllenhaal>, Guillermo Del Toro, Sophie 
Marceau and a rather lost Sienna Miller. This afternoon sees the jury hold a 
press conference which we will report on later today.

Other stars who have already descended on the Croisette include Julianne 
Moore, Lupita Nyong’o, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Hardy and Theron are in 
town for tomorrow’s out-of-competition screening of Mad Max: Fury Road. The 
film has already been receiving rave reviews (it’s currently at 98% on Rotten 
Tomatoes <http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mad_max_fury_road/>) with Peter 
Bradshaw calling it“extravagantly deranged” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/11/mad-max-fury-road-review-tom-hardy>
. Given Hardy’s headline-making press tour (he’s already talked aboutselling 
his mum for crack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/12/tom-hardy-mum-crack-addictions-alcohol-mad-max-fury-road>
), expect further publicist-scaring soundbites.

The divisive free bag

If you follow at least two journalists in Cannes, you’ll have witnessed a huge 
difference in opinion over this year’s free bag. It’s blue and it’s small and 
it’s free and it’s tearing the Croisette apart with the lack of consensus.

The responses range from middling …

The smartly reactive car company Uber has come up with the most 
attention-grabbing, yet entirely impractical, idea of the day: helicopter 
taxis. Anyone wishing to travel from nearby airport Nice to the Croisette in 
the most ostentatious way possible can use the UberCopter service which costs 
€160 for a seven-minute ride. Because they Cannes.

Tonight also allows us a first look at Tale of Tales, the latest film from 
Gomorrah director Matteo Garrone, which sounds like it could be the craziest 
film of the fest. It’s a dark fairy tale starring John C Reilly and Salma 
Hayek, who will be eating the heart of a giant beast. Critics’ Week will also 
kick off with The Anarchists, starring Blue is the Warmest Colour’s Adèle 
Exarchopoulos.

We’re off to bravely avoid the beach and head in to another dark indoor 
screening. Prayers be with us. See you tomorrow.
