A fairly frequent visitor to gardens, sparrowhawks are found across the UK. 
The only exceptions are some areas of the Scottish Highlands, the Western Isles 
and Shetland. There are over 40,000 pairs.

Male sparrowhawks are grey-coloured with a distinctive orange hue to their 
underside. Their tail is also marked with around four to five dark bars. 
Females are a darker grey-brown colour and have a white-barred underside. 
Sparrowhawks are sometimes confused with kestrels, but if seen in a garden 
chances are it's the former.

Where they live

Sparrowhawks feed on small songbirds, so are found wherever there is a 
plentiful supply and a reasonable amount of cover - copses, hedgerows, parks 
and glades. "They are pretty common around wooded areas and farmland but also 
suburban areas. They are now being seen more as garden birds," says Grahame 
Madge from the RSPB.

How to spot them

Sparrowhawks can often be seen eyeing up prey around bird tables and 
hedgerows, especially in summer when fledglings make up about 40% of their 
diet. Despite its name it doesn't actually specialise in any particular 
species. A telltale sign that a sparrowhawk has visited the garden is a circle 
of plucked feathers.

Sparrowhawks make their nests in the lower canopy of trees. The greater the 
food supply, the more nests there will be in an area.
