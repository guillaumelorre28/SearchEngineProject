The former England striker replaced Graham Westley in the summer but leaves 
with them eight points above the relegation zone having picked up only three 
points from their last eight matches.

“Teddy has had the worst luck I’ve seen in the 16 years I’ve owned the 
football club,”said the chairman, Phil Wallace, in a statement

.

“Normally we’d have one or two major ops on key players in a season but we’ve 
had more this season than the last three combined.

“You also occasionally lose points in the last few minutes of games but we’ve 
been in this situation in four of the last eight matches. However, we are where 
we are and the club have to make a change.

“Teddy came in having to work on a lower budget than we’ve had before and the 
lack of available funds has made it difficult to get the players he’d like. 
He’s given it his all but it hasn’t worked and now we have to thank him for his 
efforts and move on.”

That statement added that the first team coach Darren Sarll will take over as 
caretaker manager while the club “consider their options”.
