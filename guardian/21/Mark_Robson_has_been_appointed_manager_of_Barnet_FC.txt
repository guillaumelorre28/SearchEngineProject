Barnet have announced that Mark Robson is the League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> club's new manager.

Robson, 43, a former player with West Ham United and Charlton Athletic among 
others, leaves his position as first-team coach at the Championship side 
Peterborough United to take the reins at Underhill Stadium.

Martin Allen replaced Lawrie Sanchez in mid-April to oversee the Bees for the 
third time, but his short-term contract expired after he ensured League Two 
survival on the final day of last season.

Robson will now take charge of first-team matters as well as aiding the 
development of academy football atBarnet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnet> in what is described as a 
"comprehensive transformation of the club's footballing strategy".

The director of football, Paul Fairclough, added on Barnet's website: "I want 
the club to become renowned for the way they pass the ball and try to play 
their way through opposition, as opposed to over them. Obviously results are 
important but those results can be achieved by playing good, entertaining 
football."

Fairclough said: "In Mark Robson we have secured the services of a 
forward-thinking coach who will lead the club along a new and exciting pathway. 
I truly see this as a new dawn for Barnet Football Club."
