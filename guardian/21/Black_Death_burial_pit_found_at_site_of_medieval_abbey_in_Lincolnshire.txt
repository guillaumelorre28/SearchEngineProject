A mass burial pit of victims of the Black Death dating back to the 14th 
century has been discovered near Immingham in Lincolnshire.

Archaeologists from the University of Sheffield were searching the site of 
Thornton Abbey, once one of the country’s biggest medieval abbeys, for evidence 
of a post-medieval building when they came across the grave containing 48 
skeletons, 27 of them children.

Carbon dating shows the remains are from the middle of the 14th century, when 
theBlack Death

, which was most probably bubonic plague, killed an estimated 75 million to 200 
million people across Europe and Asia.

Teeth samples were sent to Canada where DNA was successfully extracted and 
tested positive forYersinia pestis, the bacterium responsible for the plague, 
which is documented to have reached Lincolnshire in the spring of 1349.

Despite the devastating impact of the plague – up to half the population of 
England may have perished during the Black Death –Yersinia pestis has only 
previously been identified at two 14th-century sites, bothcemeteries in London

 where the civic authorities were forced to open new emergency burial grounds 
to cope with the very large numbers of urban dead.

Dr Hugh Willmott, from the University of Sheffield’s department of 
archaeology, has been working on the Lincolnshire site since 2011 and directed 
the excavations. He said: “The finding of a previously unknown and completely 
unexpected mass burial dating to this period in a quiet corner of rural 
Lincolnshire is thus far unique, and sheds light into the real difficulties 
faced by a small community ill-prepared to face such a devastating threat.”

Explaining why more such sites have not been found before, Willmott said one 
reason was that despite the number of plague deaths, communities were 
determined to give people a proper burial, normally in the parish churchyard.

“Mass burials are a signal of when the system has broken down,” he said. “This 
community had obviously reached a point where it could not cope.”

Despite a common perception that mass burials involve throwing bodies on top 
of each other, the skeletons at the Lincolnshire site were carefully laid out 
in rows to make efficient use of space.

As they included men, women and children it was clear they were not from the 
abbey but possibly from a monastery hospital believed to have also been on the 
site.

Because the plague killed people within three to five days, it is likely that 
family members brought their relatives to the hospital in the hope that they 
would be administered the last rites and get a decent burial.

It is hoped that further analysis will determine whether any of the people in 
the pit were related, what they did for a living and their diet, the latter 
through isotope analysis.

Willmott said the placement of some of the children overlapping adults 
indicates that there may have been family members.

“We don’t focus just on their deaths. Archaeologists tend to see the point as 
learning about these people in life. We know now they died from the Black Death 
but this was a living, breathing community. What can these skeletons tell us 
about their lives before their funeral?” he said.
