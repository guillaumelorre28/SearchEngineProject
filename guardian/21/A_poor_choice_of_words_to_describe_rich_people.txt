If we are not recycling all our plastic waste, largely because many councils 
cannot deal with all the variations (Just a third of plastic is recycled, 
survey shows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/21/only-a-third-of-uk-consumer-plastic-packaging-is-recycled>
, 22 November), why are the major supermarkets allowed to keep inventing new 
wrappings consisting of mixed materials and marked “Not currently recyclable”?

• In 1970, it wasn’t the work, it was the prospect of sex, drugs and 
rock’n’roll and escaping from home that was the lure (Our friends from the north
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/21/northern-brain-drain-moving-back-london>
, G2, 22 November). Now I crave to return to Liverpool, but London-born husband 
refuses to go somewhere that’s wetter and colder.

• Lewis Carroll’s expression “jam tomorrow and jam yesterday – but never jam 
today” (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/21/the-two-cultures-and-bobby-charlton>
, 22 November) is a pun on Latin grammar regarding the usage ofiam (then) – 
which can be used for future or past events, but not in the present tense, when
nunc (now) should be used.

• Please don’t refer to rich people as “ultra-high-net-worth individuals” (
Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/22/brexit-vote-uk-household-wealth-credit-suisse>
, 23 November). These people are of no more or less worth than anyone else, 
they just have more money.

• Re Crimea, is it “the first time Europe’s borders have been changed by force 
since 1945” (Donald and Vladimir 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/20/new-special-relationship-what-does-putin-want-from-trump-kgb>
, G2, 21 November)? What about Yugoslavia?

• I beg to differ (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/21/the-two-cultures-and-bobby-charlton>
, 22 November). The humanities encourage me to think that the universe revolves 
around us. The sciences remind me that it doesn’t.

• Was your long read on Danish culture (The hygge conspiracy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/22/hygge-conspiracy-denmark-cosiness-trend>
, 22 November) actually written by Charlotte Hyggens?
