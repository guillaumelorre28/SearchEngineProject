Full-time at the Bernabeu: Real Madrid 3-1 Real Sociedad

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeeeeep! It’s all over and Real Madrid have won the three 
points that send them top of the table for a couple of hours at least. As real 
Madrid performances go, this one was far from convincing. Real Sociedad gave 
them plenty to think about and consider themselves very unlucky to have lost 
two of their most creative players to injury before going behind to a spot-kick 
that should not have been awarded. Despite occasionally slapstick defending, a 
brace from Cristiano Ronaldo and one goal from Lucas Vazquez were enough to see 
Real Madrid past a gameReal Sociedad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> side whose goal came from 
Bruma.

I forgot to mention in all the excitement: Casemiro for Modric two minutes ago.

88 min: That was an excellent finish by Vazquez, but Gareth Bale’s wonderful 
cross from the left touchline was sublime too. Galloping down the touchline, he 
welted a cross into the penalty area and will have been delighted to see 
Vazquez squirm between two defenders, kill the ball stone dead with his first 
touch and then slot it past the onrushing Geronimo Pulli with his second. A 
wonderful assist and an even better finish.

78 min: Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> claim 
they should have another penalty for hand-ball when Ruben Pardo handles 
accidentally while contesting the ball in his own penalty area. The referee 
doesn’t give one, despite awarding one in similar circumstances earlier in the 
match.

73 min: Bad news for Sergio Canales, who was forced off in the first half 
after damaging his knee. Early reports suggest he’s ruptured his anterior 
cruciate ligament, which means he’ll be out for the rest of this season and 
will almost certainly miss the start of next season.

corner went deep and while back-pedalling, he struck a low diagonal volley with

the reach of Rulli.

54 min: Danilo is out-jumped as he contests a long ball down the pitch and 
loses the header, allowing Bruma to sprint on to a flick on from Jonathas. He 
takes a touch too many, allowing Keylor Navas to dash off his line and throw 
himself at the Portuguese winger’s feet and claim the ball. It’s a good save, 
but Bruma made it too easy for him.

52 min: It’s probably safe to say that Rafael Benitez will be pointing his Big 
Finger O’Blame for Real Sociedad’s equaliser at Pepe, who was outmuscled by 
Jonathas in the build-up to the goal. Of course, in the current climate, 
there’s a very good chance Benitez will let Pepe off the hook and blame an 
Illuminati conspiracy instead.

That’s a wonderful goal from Bruma, who is given the freedom of the Real 
Madrid penalty area to curl the ball around Navas and into the top right-hand 
corner after picking up a deflected pass from Jonathas. It’s all square at the 
Bernabeu and no more thanReal Sociedad

An email from Tom Harp

“Clearly today’s referee is not part of the anti-Rafa brigade,” he writes. 
He’s not wrong, Senor Gonzalez Gonzalez seems quite the homer.

Half-time at the Bernabeu: Real Madrid 1-0 Real Sociedad

After an eventful half in which both sides had their chances and luckless Real 
Sociedad <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> lost two players 
to injury, Real Madrid lead courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty. It was his 
second effort from the spot, having sent his first one high over the crossbar. 
Real Madrid can consider themselves very fortunate to be ahead, as the penalty 
from which they scored should never have been awarded.

45+1 min: It’s worth repeating that the penalty awarded to Real was extremely 
harsh. Bale attempted to cross from the right wing and his effort was blocked 
at close range by Yuri. The ball ricocheted off the left-back’s thigh and up on 
to his arm, but the referee pointed to the spot despite the handball being 
completely involuntary and accidental. There was little or nothing the Real 
Socidad defender could have done to avoid it.

44 min: Shortly before Ronaldo gave Real Madrid, Real Sociedad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> lost another of their 
creative players. Sergio Canales pulled up with what appeared to be a serious 
knee injury and was quickly stretchered off. He’s just been replaced by Ruben 
Pardo, a central midfielder.

GOAL! Real Madrid 1-0 Real Sociedad (Ronaldo 42pen)
 Ronaldo celebrates. Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters 
Cristiano Ronaldo doesn’t make any mistake this time, slotting home 
comfortably from 12 yards. Corrections and clarifications: It wasn’t Yuri who 
was booked, so he’s still on the field. In fact it was Carlos Martinez who was 
shown the yellow card, presumably for dissent. Apologies for any confusion 
caused.
 This time Ronaldo makes sure. Photograph: Victor Carretero/Real Madrid via

Another penalty for Real Madrid ...

While attempting to block a Gareth Bale cross, Yuri accidentally handles the 
ball. He gets a ludicrous second booking and Real have another penalty.

Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeeeeep! It’s all over and Real Madrid have won the three 
points that send them top of the table for a couple of hours at least. As real 
Madrid performances go, this one was far from convincing. Real Sociedad gave 
them plenty to think about and consider themselves very unlucky to have lost 
two of their most creative players to injury before going behind to a spot-kick 
that should not have been awarded. Despite occasionally slapstick defending, a 
brace from Cristiano Ronaldo and one goal from Lucas Vazquez were enough to see 
Real Madrid past a gameReal Sociedad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> side whose goal came from 
Bruma.

90+2 min: We’re in the second of three recommended added minutes. Substitution 
I forgot to mention in all the excitement: Casemiro for Modric two minutes ago.
 
90 min: Real Madrid win a free-kick about 40 yards from the Real Sociedad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> goal. After giving it the 
full Jonny Wilkinson, he eventually hammers the ball high and wide of the goal.
 
88 min: That was an excellent finish by Vazquez, but Gareth Bale’s wonderful 
cross from the left touchline was sublime too. Galloping down the touchline, he 
welted a cross into the penalty area and will have been delighted to see 
Vazquez squirm between two defenders, kill the ball stone dead with his first 
touch and then slot it past the onrushing Geronimo Pulli with his second. A 
wonderful assist and an even better finish.

The substitute Lucas Vazquez wraps up the points for Real Madrid with a 
wonderful goal that was created by Gareth Bale. That’s his first goal forReal 
Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>.
 
84 min: Lucas Vazquez shimmies along the edge of the Real Sociedad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> penalty area, attempting to 
make room for a shot. He eventually does so, but his low drive is blocked.
 
82 min: Carlos Vela tees up Ruben Pardo in the Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> penalty area, but the 
substitute’s low drive is deflected out for a corner. The delivery, when it 
comes, is fired straight into the arms of Keylor Navas at the near post.
 
78 min: Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> claim 
they should have another penalty for hand-ball when Ruben Pardo handles 
accidentally while contesting the ball in his own penalty area. The referee 
doesn’t give one, despite awarding one in similar circumstances earlier in the 
match.
 
77 min: Real Madrid win a corner, which Marcelo sends into the penalty area 
from the left. Sociedad clear.
 
75 min: Gareth Bale attempts to pick out Cristiano Ronaldo with a cross from 
the right, but his delivery is intercepted.Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> substitution: Karim Benzema 
off, Lucas Vazquez on in midfield.
 
73 min: Bad news for Sergio Canales, who was forced off in the first half 
after damaging his knee. Early reports suggest he’s ruptured his anterior 
cruciate ligament, which means he’ll be out for the rest of this season and 
will almost certainly miss the start of next season.
 
70 min: Real Sociedad <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> 
substitution: Carlos Vela on for Jonathas
 
69 min: That was a fine goal, which game against the run of play. Marcelo’s 
corner went deep and while back-pedalling, he struck a low diagonal volley with 
his weaker left foot. the ball fizzed through the crowded penalty area beyond 
the reach of Rulli.

Manso/AFP/Getty Images 
From the corner, Cristiano Ronaldo scores with a wonderful volley that travels 
through a thicket of legs and into the bottom left-hand corner.
 
66 min: Carlos Martinez puts the ball out for a corner, getting down to poke 
it off the toe of Karim Benzema as the Frenchman attempted to slalom through on 
goal from the left.
 
64 min: Navas is called upon to save his team’s bacon again, this time saving 
from Illaramendi. He’s been kept busy in the first half of this second period, 
which is perhaps a reflection on the confidence with whichReal Sociedad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> have been playing, not to 
mention the shambolic attempts at defending by those in front of him.
 
63 min: The Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> 
faithful are getting exceedingly restless. Benitez’s decision to substitute 
James Rodriguez was meet with jeers and whistles and boos continue to echo 
around the Bernabeu.
 
61 min: Real Sociedad <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> 
midfielder Asier Illaramendi has his name taken for some indiscretion or other.
 
60 min: Karim Benzema heads straight at Rulli in his bid to convert a Kovacic 
cross from the left.
 
58 min: Real Madrid substitution: James Rodriguez off, Mateo Kovacic on. 
 
57 min: Good save from Geronimo Rulli, who does splendidly to get a hand to a 
Gareth Bale drive from the edge of the penalty area.
 
56 min: Nacho gets booked for a wild lunge on Yuri Berchiche. 
 
54 min: Danilo is out-jumped as he contests a long ball down the pitch and 
loses the header, allowing Bruma to sprint on to a flick on from Jonathas. He 
takes a touch too many, allowing Keylor Navas to dash off his line and throw 
himself at the Portuguese winger’s feet and claim the ball. It’s a good save, 
but Bruma made it too easy for him.

52 min: It’s probably safe to say that Rafael Benitez will be pointing his Big 
Finger O’Blame for Real Sociedad’s equaliser at Pepe, who was outmuscled by 
Jonathas in the build-up to the goal. Of course, in the current climate, 
there’s a very good chance Benitez will let Pepe off the hook and blame an 
Illuminati conspiracy instead.
 
50 min: Marcelo hammers in a cross from the left flank, attempting to pick out 
Ronaldo at the far post. Real Madrid’s goalscorer is unable to convert from a 
narrow angle and his effort goes wide.

That’s a wonderful goal from Bruma, who is given the freedom of the Real 
Madrid penalty area to curl the ball around Navas and into the top right-hand 
corner after picking up a deflected pass from Jonathas. It’s all square at the 
Bernabeu and no more thanReal Sociedad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> deserve.

46 min: With a foul on Bruma, Luka Modric concedes a free-kick about five 
yards outside the Real Madrid penalty area, to the right of the D. Pardo the 
substitute curls the ball around theReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> defensive wall, but high and 
wide of the upright.
 
The visitors get the ball rolling for the second half at the Bernabeu. 
 
“Clearly today’s referee is not part of the anti-Rafa brigade,” he writes. 
He’s not wrong, Senor Gonzalez Gonzalez seems quite the homer.
 
After an eventful half in which both sides had their chances and luckless Real 
Sociedad <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> lost two players 
to injury, Real Madrid lead courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty. It was his 
second effort from the spot, having sent his first one high over the crossbar. 
Real Madrid can consider themselves very fortunate to be ahead, as the penalty 
from which they scored should never have been awarded.
 
45+1 min: It’s worth repeating that the penalty awarded to Real was extremely 
harsh. Bale attempted to cross from the right wing and his effort was blocked 
at close range by Yuri. The ball ricocheted off the left-back’s thigh and up on 
to his arm, but the referee pointed to the spot despite the handball being 
completely involuntary and accidental. There was little or nothing the Real 
Socidad defender could have done to avoid it.
 
44 min: Shortly before Ronaldo gave Real Madrid, Real Sociedad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsociedad> lost another of their 
creative players. Sergio Canales pulled up with what appeared to be a serious 
knee injury and was quickly stretchered off. He’s just been replaced by Ruben 
Pardo, a central midfielder.

Cristiano Ronaldo doesn’t make any mistake this time, slotting home 
comfortably from 12 yards. Corrections and clarifications: It wasn’t Yuri who 
was booked, so he’s still on the field. In fact it was Carlos Martinez who was 
shown the yellow card, presumably for dissent. Apologies for any confusion 
caused.
