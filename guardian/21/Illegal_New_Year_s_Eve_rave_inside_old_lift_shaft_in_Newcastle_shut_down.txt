Police in Newcastle <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/newcastle> shut down an 
illegal rave on New Year’s Eve that saw about 200 people welcome 2017 from an 
old lift shaft.

Northumbria police said officers dispersed the crowd after forcing their way 
into the Tyne Bridge lift shaft on Lombard Street at Newcastle Quayside shortly 
before 2am on New Year’s Day.

Sound equipment had been illegally connected to the electricity supply and 
partygoers were cleared out after police arrived. One witness told the 
Newcastle Chronicle that officers used a circular saw to cut through a metal 
vault door and enter the rave, having already smashed through a wooden barrier.

The organisers of the event are still unknown. Police said three men in a 
white van were seen taking equipment into the tower on Friday and Saturday 
evening.

The Tyne Bridge was opened in October 1928 and connects Newcastle and 
Gateshead.
