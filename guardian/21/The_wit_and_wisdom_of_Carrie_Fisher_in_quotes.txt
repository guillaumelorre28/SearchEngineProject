Carrie Fisher, the Star Wars actor who became an acclaimed writer, has died in 
Los Angeles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/27/carrie-fisher-dies-star-wars-princess-leia>
 four days after reportedly suffering a heart attack on a flight from London.

As well as her acting talent, writing skill and beauty, Fisher was known for 
her unflinching honesty. Here are some of her best quotes:

On her slave outfit in Return of the Jedi


“The father who flipped out about it, ‘What am I going to tell my kid about 
why she’s in that outfit?’ Tell them that a giant slug captured me and forced 
me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn’t like it. 
And then I took it off. Backstage.” ViaThe Wall Street Journal

On Star Wars


“Movies were meant to stay on the screen, flat and large and colorful, 
gathering you up into their sweep of story, carrying you rollicking along to 
the end, then releasing you back into your unchanged life. But this movie (Star 
Wars) misbehaved. It leaked out of the theater, poured off the screen, affected 
a lot of people so deeply that they required endless talismans and artifacts to 
stay connected to it.” ViaThe Princess Diarist

On how she got cast in Star Wars

“I slept with some nerd. I hope it was George [Lucas] ... I took too many 
drugs to remember.” ViaVanity Fair

On being Princess Leia

“I am Princess Leia, no matter what. If I were trying to get a good table, I 
wouldn’t say I wrote Postcards [From the Edge, her best-selling novel]. Or, if 
I’m trying to get someone to take my check and I don’t have ID, I wouldn’t say: 
“Have you seen [When] Harry Met Sally?” Princess Leia will be on my tombstone.”

On discussing her affair with Harrison Ford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/nov/20/carrie-fisher-harrison-ford-affair-star-wars-memoir-interview-simon-hattenstone>
“I don’t think it’s that revealing, or it’s certainly not offensive. It’s not 
unkind about him. It’s flattering. I mean, the way people are reacting to it is 
funny to me, too. I’d do him at 73.” Via The Princess Diarist

On how her father, Eddie Fisher, helped Elizabeth Taylor after her husband’s 
death


“He first dried her eyes with his handkerchief, then he consoled her with 
flowers, and he ultimately consoled her with his penis. This made marriage to 
my mother awkward.” ViaWishful Drinking

On fame

On bipolar disorder

during an attack’ heroic, but an emotional survival. An opportunity to be a 
good example to others who might share our disorder.” Via heradvice column for
