It was a tale of two Americas. In Las Vegas the casinos were humming with a 
hell-yes tide that was about to sweep the manic Donald Trump tohis most 
pumped-up victory yet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/23/donald-trump-wins-nevada-caucuses-results>
. In Washington DC, civilisation still existed. In the week Trump’s xenophobic 
bid to be the Republican presidential candidate began to look unstoppable, the 
man whose Americanness he has questioned was meeting 106-year-oldVirginia 
McLaurin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/23/10-milestones-in-black-history-that-virginia-mclaurin-lived-through>
. In Pete Souza’s official White House photograph of their get-together, 
President Barack Obama cracks a delicious smile as the first lady dances with 
McLaurin, who was invited to visit the White House in recognition ofcommunity 
work she has done for decades in the US capital

. The meeting was also a celebration ofBlack History Month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth> – and Souza’s picture 
manages to be both intimate and historic. Here are three African Americans in 
the White House. The room they are in – the Blue Room – is opulently decorated 
with gold stars, Empire-style furniture, and a portrait of some grand national 
father who holds a white handkerchief in his white hand.

 Feb 2016 – Watching the first lady dance with 106-year-old Virginia McLaurin 
in the Blue Room of the White House 
This is just one in a stream of vividly human and often funny photographs – 
released not just through White House press office, but on Flickr and Instagram 
– in which Souza has documented moments of the Obama administration that will 
never be forgotten. These photographs are precious historical documents. 
Critics from left and right blame the two-term presidency of this evidently 
intelligent and decent man for everything from the failure to close Guantánamo 
Bay (he’s still trying 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/23/obama-guantanamo-bay-closure-plan-congress>
) to a continuing economic malaise that has fuelled what is shaping up to be 
the most extremist presidential electionsince 1860 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1860>. Yet 
Souza’s photographs tell a different story – and the one that matters. Obama 
accomplished the impossible and made the White House an African American home 
for eight years.

 Nov 2009 – Obama jokes with staff before the Summit of the Americas in 
Singapore 
If the image ofMcLaurin – who was born in 1909, a time when the civil war was 
still a living memory for many Americans – visiting the first black US 
president does not communicate the soft power of the Obama age, consider some 
of Souza’s other pictures. In 2012, he photographed Obama bowing tolet 
five-year-old Jacob Philadelphia feel his head 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/25/barack-obama-bows>. The 
boy had told Obama: “I want to know if my hair is just like yours.” The 
president had replied: “Touch it, dude!”

 May 2009 – Jacob ­Philadelphia asked Obama if his hair was like his, so the 
most powerful man in the world bowed to a child 
Jacob Philadelphia is just one in a long line of African American children who 
have met Obama in the White House, in encounters that have been touchingly, 
spontaneously, comically captured by Souza’s camera.

In a moving monochrome image, Souza showed three-year-old Clark Reynolds 
looking up in awe asObama touches him on the cheek 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/20/this-photo-of-obama-and-a-little-visitor-at-a-black-history-month-celebration-says-a-lot/>
. The photograph is taken from child height and brilliantly captures a 
child’s-eye view of the president. We only see Obama’s hand caressing Clark’s 
face. Unlike the ones in all paintings and photographs of all previous 
presidents, it is not a white hand. How can anyone say that means nothing? 
Young Clark Reynolds evidently thinks it means something, and so does Souza, 
whose photography has perhaps become more lyrical, more poignant over Obama’s 
final year in office.

 Feb 2016 – Obama touches the face of three-year-old Clark Reynolds, in one of 
Souza’s most moving photographs 
Not every delightfully warm and human moment recorded in Souza’s White House 
pictures is a chapter in history, of course. A lot of the time, he simply 
captures Obama’s sense of fun and quick-witted social grace. There is a great 
image of the president pretending to be caught in an invisible web, thrown bya 
boy in a Spider-Man costume 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/jan/04/white-house-pictures#img-19>
. In another lovely moment, the president demonstrates his best dad moves 
backstage before his daughter’s dance recital. A more reflective portrait 
captures the tensions and secrets of power, as Obama isreflected in a White 
House mirror 
<http://www.readingthepictures.org/2011/04/obama-playing-both-sides-against-the-middle/>
, finger to his lips, deep in a conspiratorial conversation.

 April 2011 – Souza captures Obama at the heart of events, perhaps feeling the 
burden of his job 
What made Souza such an ideal day-to-day chronicler of Obama’s presidency? The 
answer is surprising. Before he recorded the White House life of America’s 
first black president, Souza did the same job for the first Hollywood actor to 
rule from the Oval Office. From 1983 to 1989, he wasRonald Reagan’s official 
photographer <http://www.musarium.com/stories/reagan/>. Perhaps his most famous 
picture of that era 
<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Michael_Jackson_Reagan_Pete_Souza_1984.jpg>
 shows Ronald and Nancy Reagan meeting Michael Jackson, who is wearing a 
spangly military-style jacket. Reagan looks understandably confused – is this 
the king of pop or the commander of the Star Wars defence programme?

 Nov 2005 – A young Obama ascends the Capitol steps 
There may be more connecting Reagan and Obama than at first appears – and 
Souza can see it all. Both are great communicators. Neither let the pomp of 
office turn them into a stuffed shirt. Reagan, like Obama, had a human touch, a 
capacity to relate to people. Simply being human is a rare gift among modern 
politicians. Seeming relaxed in office is even rarer. Reagan was famously so 
laid-back that he could joke about nuclear war. He may have terrified peace 
activists, but the American public took confidence from the ease he projected.

 Jan 2009 – Humour, love and friendship – the Obamas share a joke in a lift on 
inauguration night 
Obama, too, projects absolute ease in the presidency. It is not a love of 
power. Souza’s photographs never show him looking arrogant, or distant, or 
dangerous. In these pictures, he always seems both happy and modest in his 
office: a photograph of himfist-bumping a cleaner in a government building 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/01/barack-obama-fist-bumps-picture_n_1928838.html>
 quietly captures his sense of the larger realities of inequality that will go 
on beyond his eight-year presidency.

Reports on Souza’s photographs tend to repeat over and over again that they 
show how “cool” this president is, but that word means nothing. These images 
tell the true story of a presidency that words have failed. After all the hate, 
anger, birther theories, leftist critiques, rightist critiques, and even the 
liberal white awe of a “cool” black dude vanishes into the babble of the past, 
Souza’s photographs will tell the story of a leader who was calm under fire, 
unfazed by office, unquenchably human, and who showed the way for all the kids 
who passed through his Oval Office, and millions more, to be good people, good 
Americans, and good citizens of the world. Will we miss the man in these 
pictures? Hell, yes.
