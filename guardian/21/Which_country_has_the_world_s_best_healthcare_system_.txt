France

Upfront payments: yes

Data: France scores highly on GP numbers and on spending as a percentage of 
GDP, but it comes off badly in theCommonwealth Fund’s international comparison 
reports 
<http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror>
, ranking only ninth out of 11 in the latest assessment.

Summary

Under France’s state-run equivalent of the NHS, the majority of patients must 
pay the doctor or practitioner upfront. The state then reimburses them in part 
or in full. The patient has freedom to choose which doctor or service to visit.

All health transactions centre on a smartcard, the Carte Vitale. A GP visit 
costs €23 (£17), the Carte Vitale is swiped and the money is paid back into the 
patient’s bank account within five days. In general, the state reimbursement 
rate is between 70% and 100%. The poorest people and the long-term sick are 
covered 100%.

Most people are signed up to a mutuelle, a semi-private insurance body, often 
related to their job, which tops up the remaining amount to be paid. If a 
patient is taken to the emergency department of a hospital, for example, they 
would provide theirCarte Vitale, and depending on the health issue, could be 
reimbursed fully by the state. However, from November 2017 doctors such as GPs 
will have to waive the upfront fees for all patients, and instead the state and 
themutuelle companies will pay doctors direct. At pharmacies, the patient pays 
upfront but swipes theirCarte Vitale. A large number of prescribed medicines 
are reimbursed between 15% and 100%.

Ireland

Upfront payments: yes

Data: Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> has more nurses than 
any other rich country, but its other metrics are distinctly average.
Ireland graphics 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/nhs-charts/embed/embed.html?c=Ireland&i=5,2,0>
Summary

A GP visit in Ireland typically costs €40-€60. However, in 2015 the Irish 
government abolished charges for children under six while people with amedical 
card 
<http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html>
 orGP visit card 
<http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/gp_visit_cards.html>
 also receive free GP care.


In most cases individuals pay for prescriptions 
<http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html>
 from pharmacies capped at €144 per month under the Drugs Payment Scheme. 
Medical cardholders do not pay for medication but do pay a prescription charge 
of €2.50 per item (capped at €25 per month per person/family).

Patients are usually referred for secondary treatment by their GP unless they 
have entered the health system directly through an emergency department. Those 
attending emergency departments without being referred by a GPare charged €100 (
 
<http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/hospital_services/hospital_charges.html>
with some exemptions 
<http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/hospital_services/hospital_charges.html>
) 
<http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/hospital_services/hospital_charges.html>
. You are not charged if you are subsequently admitted as an inpatient but may 
be liable for hospital charges. The charge for an overnight stay in a public 
bed in a public hospital is €75 per day up to a maximum of €750 in 12 
consecutive months.

As of the end of September, 46% of the population had health insurance, 
meaning they could be treated as a private patient in the public system or in a 
private hospital. Public patients who receive treatment in private hospitals 
pay for their own care.

Sweden

Upfront payments: yes

Data: Sweden <https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden> is ranked third by the 
Commonwealth Fund, with a high proportion of doctors, above-average healthcare 
spending, and relatively low prescriptions of drugs.
Sweden graphics 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/nhs-charts/embed/embed.html?c=Sweden&i=2,0,4>
Summary

Patients wishing to see a doctor pay a fee that varies depending on where they 
live, but usually about 100-200 kronor (£8-£16) for adults. Children pay only 
if they go to emergency rooms, about 120 kronor. For a visit to a specialist 
you pay up to 400 kronor and for emergency about 400 kronor. A hospital stay 
costs 100 kronor a day. You usually pay the same whether you choose a private 
or public clinic or hospital, as long as the private clinic is connected to the 
general healthcare system. And most are.

There is a limit to how much you pay for healthcare within a 12-month period. 
In most regions that is 1,100 kronor, but there are regions where the limit is 
just 900 kronor. Everything is free after that. Prescriptions are subsidised 
and you never pay more than 2,200 kronor in a 12-month period.

If you are referred to an expert, you pay a lower fee of about 100 kronor. If 
there are recurring visits you pay each time, but only up to 1,100 kronor 
within a 12-month period. Some regions charge small fees for the cost of an 
ambulance, about 150 kronor.

Only about 600,000 Swedes have a private health insurance – usually paid for 
by employers. It gives them the ability to skip the queue for procedures and 
operations, and to get to a doctor more quickly.

China

Upfront payments: yes, but low

Data: China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> scores poorly on just 
about every healthcare metric, apart from the growth in how much it spends each 
year on public health – a sign that it is trying to catch up.
china 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/nhs-charts/embed/embed.html?c=China&i=1,2,5>
Summary

Hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens lost the right to free public 
healthcare after the Communist party launched its economic reforms drive in the 
late 1970s.


 Today, the cost of a hospital consultation is still relatively low. For those 
with blue government “social insurance” cards, for example, a trip to Beijing’s 
Friendship hospital can cost as little 2 yuan (20p). It costs about 100 yuan to 
be admitted to A&E while a night in a ward sets a patient back about the same.

But the often exorbitant cost of medicine and treatment can be enough to ruin 
a Chinese family.


Government officials say they hope to provide affordable healthcare to every 
Chinese citizen by 2020 and claim 95% of the population now boasts some kind of 
medical insurance. But in reality even those who do have insurance find it 
often fails to cover their bills.

Poorly paid doctors are notorious for overcharging patients for unnecessary 
prescriptions while even an ambulance ride to the hospital can set you back 
several hundred yuan.


Discontent over this state of affairs has made medicine a dangerous profession 
in China with a surge in verbal and physical attacks, including murders, 
against doctors in recent years.

US

Upfront payments: yes

Data: the US scores poorly on many fronts, ranked 11th out of 11 in the 
Commonwealth Fund 2014 list. And yet it far outstrips all its peers in terms of 
the amount it spends on healthcare – a whopping 17% of GDP.
US graphics 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/nhs-charts/embed/embed.html?c=US&i=0,3,7>
Summary

US healthcare is not quite the Darwinian lottery imagined by foreigners. 
Hospitals <https://www.theguardian.com/society/hospitals> are duty-bound to 
treat emergency cases. Government spending pays for a surprising share of 
visits to the doctor and drugs through a patchwork of public programmes: 
Medicare for the old, Medicaid for the poor and Chip for children. Since 
Obama’s insurance reforms, the percentage of people who have no cover has 
fallen to “only” 10% – a mere 33 million people.

For the rest, standards are generally high, sometimes among the best in the 
world. But no matter how good the insurance policy, few Americans can escape 
the crushing weight of payments bureaucracy, or the risk-averse medical 
practices that flow from a fear of lawsuits.

Almost all visits to the doctor (often a specialist, rather than general 
practitioner) will generate “co-pays” for the patient and revenue streams for 
the physician that some fear encourages excessive testing and intervention: a 
consumer, rather than care-led, culture.

Preventive medicine and public health are harder to incentivise. Patchy access 
to insurance can leave emergency rooms clogged with chronic conditions. Obesity 
and mental illness often go entirely untreated.

Though the system fosters excellence and innovation in places, the messy 
combination of underinsurance and overinsurance has left the US with the 
highest healthcare costs in the developed world and some of the worst overall 
health outcomes.

Japan

Upfront payments: no

Data: Japan spends a sharply rising proportion of GDP on healthcare but falls 
down on the amount of time people spend in hospital, which is one of the 
highest among rich countries.
Japan charts 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/nhs-charts/embed/embed.html?c=Japan&i=0,2,7>
Summary

Every resident of Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> is required, 
in principle, to take out public health insurance. Regular employees are 
typically covered by a work scheme, and are required to pay 20% of their total 
medical costs at the point of delivery.

Those not covered by their employer – mainly the self-employed and unemployed 
– must join the national health insurance scheme. Premiums are based on salary, 
value of property and the number of dependants, and members pay 30% of the cost 
of inpatient or outpatient treatment – including emergencies – with the 
government paying the remainder. People over 70 pay 10% of costs.

Medical fees above a certain ceiling – calculated depending on income and age 
– are paid in full by the government. Fees are waived for uninsured people on 
low incomes who receive government support.

Both public insurance plans cover a range of services, including hospital 
care, mental health care, prescription drugs, physiotherapy and, significantly, 
most dental care.

The role of the state in providing healthcare services outstrips many other 
developed countries. In 2012, 82% of health spending was publicly funded, 
compared with an OECD average of 72%.

Universal health coverage has been credited with contributing to Japan’s 
impressive longevity statistics, but the growing elderly population is adding 
to healthcare costs. Lengths of hospital stays are almost twice as long as in 
other countries.

Japan spent 8.6% of GDP on healthcare in 2008, according to OECD figures 
<http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Briefing-Note-JAPAN-2014.pdf>. By 2013 
that had risen to 10.3%, largely because of the ballooning cost of caring for 
older people.

Spain

Upfront payments: no

Data: Spain has a relatively high number of doctors – and a low number of 
nurses – proportionate to its population, but the amount it spends on 
healthcare has started to fall amid the economic crisis.
Spain charts 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/nhs-charts/embed/embed.html?c=Spain&i=0,2,3>
Summary

Spain <https://www.theguardian.com/world/spain> offers free, universal 
healthcare to anyone resident, legally or illegally, in the country, as well as 
to tourists and other visitors. Since 2012, undocumented foreigners have been 
entitled only to emergency care. Some 90% of Spaniards use the system, with 
about 18% signing up to private healthcare schemes, including many public 
sector workers who are given the option of free, private care. Most dental and 
eye care is carried out in the private sector.


The system is decentralised across the country’s 17 autonomous regions and so 
the quality of care, and in particular access to specialist procedures or 
units, varies. This leads to a degree of internal health tourism. In a recent 
poll, medical professionals, said nine out of 10 of the best hospitals were in 
either Madrid or Barcelona. Some regions, notably Catalonia, have implemented 
deeper spending cuts than others, leading to longer waiting lists and some 
migration towards the private sector.

Italy charts 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/nhs-charts/embed/embed.html?c=Italy&i=2,3,4>
Summary

In Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, the national health 
service, Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, offers universal health coverage that is 
free or low cost at the point of delivery and covers the vast majority of drugs.

It is recognised by independent experts as offering affordable and high 
quality care, though there are regional differences in the standard of some 
state-run hospitals, with facilities in northern Italy being considered better 
than those in the south. Citizens can also buy private insurance, which some do 
to avoid waiting times for doctors’ visits.

The national insurance scheme is offered to all European citizens, and 
includes full coverage – paid for by general taxes – of inpatient treatments, 
tests, medications, surgery, emergency care, paediatrics and access to a family 
doctor. According to Italy’s health ministry, the list of pharmaceuticals that 
are covered by national insurance is the most complete inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, with patients having to pay 
for only products that treat minor disorders.

The ministry said Italy is also the only country in Europe that allows 
families to choose a paediatrician for children until age 14 at no charge.

Data: middle of the pack. Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>

be higher than in other countries.
Germany charts 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/nhs-charts/embed/embed.html?c=Germany&i=0,7,6>
Summary

 In Germany’s healthcare system, which goes back to Otto von Bismarck’s social 
security programme of the 1880s, anyone residing in the country is required to 
take out a health insurance scheme.

 About 85% of the population do this by taking out insurance with one of the 
country’s 124 non-profitKrankenkassen or “sickness funds”: public insurers, 
many of whom are small and linked to trade unions. Membership rates are about 
15% of monthly salary, half of which is paid by employers.

 Those who earn more than €4,350 (£3,300) a month can take out insurance with 
a private company, an option that is mainly popular with freelancers and the 
self-employed. For welfare recipients, health insurance membership is covered 
by local authorities.

 Membership covers GP and registered specialists as well as basic dental care. 
If you are taken to hospital, your public health insurance kicks in once you 
are charged more than €10 a day, covering inpatient care with the doctor on 
duty at your nearest hospital.

It doesn’t cover private doctors or private rooms at a hospital, homeopathic 
treatment or more advanced dental treatment. Patients pay for 10% of 
prescription drugs, with a minimum of €5 and a limit of €10 per medication per 
prescription.

 Since 2013, patients in Germany no longer have to pay a consultation fee of 
€10 when seeing a doctor. They can now also go straight to a specialist, rather 
than waiting to be referred by a GP.

On paper, the Russian health service is free to all. In practice, a complex 
compulsory medical insurance system plus low wages for doctors and nurses means 
that without substantial bribes, gaining a decent level of care outside the 
better private clinics is almost impossible. The horrific case in December in 
which a doctor in Belgorodpunched a patient in the face 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/09/russian-doctor-filmed-punching-patient-who-later-died>
, who fell to the floor and subsequently died, put the spotlight on the poor 
care many Russians receive.

There are many efficient and modern private clinics in Moscow, but in the 
regions ageing Soviet infrastructure and outdated medical practices are 
widespread. Medicine is widely available, and many drugs that are 
prescription-only in Britain are available over the counter. The Russian 
tendency to overprescribe means that Russians often spend huge amounts on 
medicines.

Emergency care is also free in theory, but private ambulances often arrive 
much quicker than state-provided ones, and there are also reports of ambulance 
crews demanding money to take patients to hospital. Most middle-class Russians 
have private health insurance, or simply pay upfront at private clinics when 
required.

Summary

Most people pay to see a GP, which costs about $50-$80 (£24-£38). About half 
of this is reclaimable via a nationwide Medicare insurance scheme.

Some GP surgeries offer “bulk-billing”, which means they only charge the 
reclaimable fee, so patients do not have to pay anything to see the doctor. 
Low-income earners and pensioners who have a government-issued healthcare card 
are always bulk-billed.

 Most prescriptions are subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme 
(PBS).

Treatment in public hospitals is completely covered by Medicare, though people 
with private health insurance often elect to use private hospitals.

 Ambulances are not covered by Medicare. Some states fund ambulances through 
an annual levy, though others charge $300-$2,000 (£150-£950) for an emergency 
ambulance callout. This goes up to $10,220 (£5,000) for an emergency callout of 
a helicopter in Victoria. Many people have ambulance cover as part of their 
health insurance.

In 2011-12, 57% of adult Australians had private health insurance, 
particularly older people, high earners and women in their 20s and 30s who use 
it for maternity care.

Upfront payments: no

Data: the UK came first in the latest Commonwealth Fund assessment of 
healthcare systems around the rich world, but other surveys such asa European 
one 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/26/nhs-comes-14th-in-europe-wide-survey-on-health-systems>
 earlier this month are not so flattering. Healthcare spending as a proportion 
of GDP isfalling behind international averages 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/20/nhs-funding-falling-behind-european-neighbours-kings-fund-research>
, and an elderly demographic, the obesity epidemic and alcohol bingeing are all 
taking their toll. The UK also has the worst cancer outcomes of any rich 
country.

A mission statement set in 1948 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/jan/18/the-national-health-service-explained-video>
 for a universal service free at the point of use is under strain like never 
before. People are still able to see a GP free of charge – though booking an 
appointment is becoming harder. It will cost nothing to call out an ambulance 
and go through A&E, to undergo chemotherapy or major surgery. And yet about 11% 
of the population prefer to pay for private health insurance.

• This article was amended on 9 February 2016 to correct a statement about 
membership rates for health insurance in Germany. They are about 15% of monthly 
salary, half of which is paid by employers; not 15% which is matched by 
employers. In the section on Spain, a reference to some “migration towards the 
public sector” was corrected to “migration towards the private sector”. The 
section on Italy has been amended to say that not all healthcare is free at the 
point of delivery.
