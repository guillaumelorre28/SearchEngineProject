Police have charged a woman with manslaughter over the death of a newborn baby 
boy found mutilated in a Cairns driveway more than two decades ago.

The torso of the baby boy, believed to be no more than 48 hours old, was found 
on the driveway of a home in Hayward Street, Mooroobool, on 4 May 1996.

Police at the time believed the baby had been drowned, cut in half with a 
sharp instrument and dumped. The torso was believed to have been dragged to the 
driveway by dogs and the lower half of the boy’s body was never found

A 43-year-old Manoora woman was arrested on Sunday and charged with one count 
each of manslaughter, misconduct with regards to a corpse and concealing the 
birth of a child.

She was due to face Cairns magistrates court on Monday.

The breakthrough in the 20-year-old case came after police appealed to the 
public for informatin.

A Cairns woman was charged with murder over the boy’s death in 2008 but the 
case was dropped due to a lack of evidence.
