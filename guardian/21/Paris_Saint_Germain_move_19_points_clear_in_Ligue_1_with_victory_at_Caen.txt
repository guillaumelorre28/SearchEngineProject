Di María scored either side of a Zlatan Ibrahimovic volley as PSG moved on to 
51 points above second-placed Monaco, who missed a penalty in a 0-0 draw at 
10-man bottom side Troyes, and Angers, a point further back before facing 
Saint-Etienne on Sunday.

Caen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/caen>, who missed a late penalty 
through Andy Delort, remain in fourth place on 30 points from 19 matches.

PSG, the champions, have broken the half-season points record set by Olympique 
Lyonnais who entered the winter break in 2006 with 50 points.

Di María opened the scoring in the 16th minute when he fired past Rémy 
Vercoutre after Serge Aurier’s cross was deflected into his path by Syam Ben 
Youssef.

 doubled their lead in the 36th minute with a thunderous volley, his 15th 
league goal of the season, from the edge of the area, before Di María 
impudently lifted the ball over Vercoutre five minutes after the break.
