animated films afterAlice in Wonderland

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/01/petes-dragon-review-sweet-and-soulful-with-a-bitter-streak>
, with Beauty and the Beast and Peter Pan on the way. The original adaptation 
was released in 1996 and featured the voices of Susan Sarandon, Simon Callow 
and Joanna Lumley.

The news follows an underwhelming result at the box office for Steven 
Spielberg’s adaptation of Roald Dahl’sThe BFG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/21/the-bfg-review-mark-rylance-towers-over-roald-dahls-classic-tale>

Mendes’s most recent credits are the Bond thrillers Skyfall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review> and Spectre

. In May, he recently announced that he will not be making any more films in 
the franchise. “It was an incredible adventure, I loved every second of it,”he 
said

. “But I think it’s time for somebody else”.
