Fishermen at the western town of Taiji caught 20 dolphins, according to the 
local Kii Mimpo newspaper.

“We finally caught them. I’m relieved,” Yoshifumi Kai, a senior official of 
the local fisheries association, told Kyodo News agency.

During the six-month hunting season, people from the southwestern town corral 
hundreds of the mammals into a secluded bay and butcher them, turning the water 
crimson red.

The scene was featured in the documentary, drawing unwanted attention to the 
little coastal community.

Environmental campaigners visit the town every year during the gruesome event 
and authorities have boosted their presence to prevent any clashes between 
locals and activists.

There were no clashes between anti-whaling activists and fishermen on Friday, 
Kyodo News added.

Officials and fishermen at Taiji could not be reached for immediate comment.

Defenders of the hunt say it is a tradition and point out that the animals are 
not endangered, a position echoed by the Japanese government.

Ric O’Barry, the star of The Cove, was detained earlier this year

 for nearly three weeks after being denied entry to Japan, and was deported 
from the country.
