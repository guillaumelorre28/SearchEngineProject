Michael van Gerwen, the hot favourite and world No1, launches his challenge 
for the Sid Waddell Trophy on Saturday against Ross Snook or Kim Viljanen.

Anderson required double one to clinch the first set against Frost 3-0, but 
rarely looked in danger of losing a leg and took the second set by the same 
score in double-quick time.

The outclassed Frost finished with a bullseye from 73 to win his first leg at 
the start of the third set and clinched another to lead 2-1, hitting double 20 
after Anderson had missed the same target.

But the champion responded to level it up and in the deciding leg checked out 
on 40 to seal the set 3-2 for a comfortable victory.

Earlier, the unseeded Kevin Painter, the tournament runner-up to Phil Taylor 
in 2004, checked out with a bullseye from 124 to beat the 29th seed, Jamie 
Caven, 3-1 and the 30th seed, Jamie Lewis, held off Mick McGowanâ€™s fightback to 
prevail 3-2 after a tense deciding set.

In the final game of the opening session Michael Smith overcame Ricky Evans 
3-2 in another thrilling seesaw encounter.

Smith, the 11th seed, trailed 1-0 and 2-1 against his unseeded opponent but 
prevailed through some quality finishing as he checked out from 143 during the 
fourth set and 94 at the beginning of the fifth.
