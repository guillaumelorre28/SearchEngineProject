Swansea have completed the signing of the Italian striker Alberto Paloschi from
Chievo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chievo>. The 26-year-old has been 
signed for an undisclosed fee, subject to international clearance, on a 
three-and-a-half-year deal. It is thought the fee is around £8m.

Swansea announced Paloschi’s arrival on their official website and he becomes 
the club’s first major signing of the January transfer window.

The former Italy Under-21 international will link again up with the new 
Swansea head coach, Francesco Guidolin, after playing under his compatriot at 
Parma.

“I’m very happy to be here,” said Paloschi. “I worked with Francesco for two 
seasons at Parma and we got promoted.

“When I received a call from my agent to tell me that Swansea were interested 
it was great but even more so because of the manager. It makes a big difference.

“I know the situation of the club and, being a striker, I know the expectation 
is to score goals and I’ve come here to do that.”

Paloschi began his career with Milan, making his senior debut in February 2008 
under Carlo Ancelotti and scoring 17 seconds after coming off the bench.

He moved to Parma and Genoa before signing for Chievo in August 2011, where he 
scored 42 goals in 145 games including eight in 21 Serie A appearances this 
season.

Paloschi, who will wear the No9 shirt at the Liberty Stadium, added: “It’s a 
great opportunity for me because every player wants to play in the Premier 
League.

“I have always wanted to experience playing aboard and it was my dream to play 
in this league.

“I watched Swansea when they played Napoli in the Europa League a couple of 
seasons ago and I know about the style of football here. The club has good 
facilities, a nice stadium and I’ve been told that the fans are passionate.”
