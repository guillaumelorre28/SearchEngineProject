Atlético Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> 
maintained their faint hopes of catching Barcelona by recording a fourth 
straight league win, comfortably beating Deportivo la Coruña 3-0 with goals by 
the midfielder Saúl Ñíguez, top scorer Antoine Griezmann and Argentinian 
forward Ángel Correa.

Saúl headed Atlético in front in the 18th minute by racing into the box to 
meet a cross from Filipe Luís.

Griezmann, who got the only goal in Atlético’s 1-0 win over Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/feb/27/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-la-liga-live>
 a fortnight ago, netted for the fourth game in a row by swivelling to strike 
into the bottom corner after a lay-off from the Spain international Koke.

The substitute Correa finished off a lofted pass from the captain, Gabi, 
leaving Deportivo in 13th place in the table and still without a league win in 
2016.

Atlético are eight points behind Barcelona, who beat Getafe 6-0
