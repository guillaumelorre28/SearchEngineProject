Leicester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity> have 
signed the midfielder N’Golo Kanté from Caen and the defender Yohan Benalouane 
from Atalanta. Kanté, 24, is a Frenchman of Malian descent who helped Caen win 
promotion to Ligue 1 in the 2013-14 season.

Claudio Ranieri, who is back in English football 11 years after being sacked 
by Chelsea, has now signed five players. Robert Huth, Christian Fuchs and 
Shinji Okazaki were acquired earlier in the summer.

said Kanté’s contract was for four years but did not disclose the fee. “The 
Foxes beat off competition to secure Kanté, whose tenacious approach has seen 
him catch the eye,” the club added.

He was quickly followed by Benalouane who has also signed a four-year deal. 
The 28-year-old Tunisia international, who moved for an undisclosed fee, 
started his career at Saint-Etienne before switching to Cesena in Serie A in 
2010. He moved to Parma in 2012 before joining Atalanta in 2014. Benalouane 
could make his debut alongside Kanté in Saturday’s Premier League opener at 
home to Sunderland.
