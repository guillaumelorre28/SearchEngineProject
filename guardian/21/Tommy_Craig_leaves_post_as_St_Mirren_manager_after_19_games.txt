Tommy Craig has left his post as St Mirren 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stmirren> manager.

The 64-year-old has parted company with the Paisley club after only 19 games 
and with the Buddies second bottom of theScottish Premiership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-premiership> and out of both 
domestic trophies.

Craig stepped up from assistant in the summer following the departure of Danny 
Lennon. However, the former manager of Scotland Under-21s and the Belgian club 
Charleroi struggled for positive results and leaves with three victories on his 
record.

The 1-0 home defeat by St Johnstone on Saturday was the eighth match without a 
win and kept St Mirren above Ross County only on goal difference.

Craig, who played for Aberdeen, Sheffield Wednesday and Newcastle United, had 
been subject to growing frustration among the supporters.
