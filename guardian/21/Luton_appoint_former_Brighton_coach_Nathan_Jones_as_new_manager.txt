Brighton gave the 42-year-old permission to speak to the League Two club and 
he has agreed a two-and-a-half year contract at Kenilworth Road.

Despite his lack of managerial experience, the Welshman helped Gareth 
Southgate prepare England for their European Under-21 Championship campaign 
last year.

Jones began his playing career with Luton 20 years ago, spending a year at the 
club before moving to Spain.

The Luton chief executive, Gary Sweet, said: “After a lengthy and thorough 
process, in which we received numerous excellent candidates for the position, 
we believe that we have found the best man to lead the club’s footballing 
aspirations forward.

“Nathan is a professional, disciplined, strong and open-minded character who 
is going to install a hard-working team ethic and, importantly, the prospect of 
fast-flowing football to Kenilworth Road.”

Chris Hughton, the Brighton manager, said: “Since I arrived, he has been an 
enormous help to me in my first year in the job and alongside Colin Calderwood, 
he has played a big part in our progress in the last 12 months. I think he has 
all the attributes to become a very good manager.”
