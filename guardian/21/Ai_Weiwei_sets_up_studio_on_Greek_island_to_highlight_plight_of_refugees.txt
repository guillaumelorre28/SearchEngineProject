Chinese artist Ai Weiwei <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei> 
has set up a studio on the Greek island of Lesbos to highlight the plight of 
refugees.

thousands of refugees

“As an artist, I have to relate to humanity’s struggles ... I never separate 
these situations from my art,” he said. The artist is as well-known for his 
clashes with the Chinese authorities as for his work.

Ai praised the people of Lesbos for having a “very good understanding” of the 
refugees’ plight,their needs and for being “very helpful and very tolerant”, 
but emphasised they had limited resources to deal with the issue.

He praised the impressive work of several foreign non-governmental 
organisations, notably in the Netherlands, Norway and Spain. He added that 
there was a lack of awareness of the situation inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and the rest of the world and a 
willingness to act.

“The border is not in Lesbos, it really [is] in our minds and in our hearts ,” 
Ai said.

Ai told Associated Press he expected to visit Lesbos several times over the 
next year, or even beyond, if the crisis persisted beyond 2016. He said about 
six to 10 of his students inChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> and 
Germany would be working at the studio.
