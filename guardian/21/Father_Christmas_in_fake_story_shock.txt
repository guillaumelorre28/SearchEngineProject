On Monday 12 December MPs will be discussing a petition to close shops on 
Boxing Day. Boxing Day is an integral part of Christmas and time for chilling 
out with families and friends. It is imperative that parliament provides the 
time for this through legislation – for the benefit of retail workers and 
society at large. It would also be good for retailers as more goods would be 
bought prior to a two-day Christmas break. In Germany they more correctly refer 
to 26 December 26 as SecondChristmas

• The Guardian asked readers “to tell us about the state of the UK probation 
services” and on9 December  
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/09/the-job-used-to-have-integrity-readers-on-britains-probation-services>
some of the responses were published. I would like to thank you for giving 
voice to the seemingly unattended cries of staff struggling in “transforming 
rehabilitation”.

• I find the hand-wringing over false news (Letters, 12 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/09/real-concerns-about-fake-news-and-staged-photos>
) amusing given that millions are colluding in the false news that Father 
Christmas exists. Ho ho ho.

• Gaby Hinsliff asks “What can you buy the average 87-year-old?” (I’ve scaled 
the summit of peak stuff, 9 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/09/peak-stuff-christmas-shopping>
). I’m 87 on 18 December and would like a motorcycle with electric start, 
please.

• Ian Jack, one of my favourites of your contributors, refers to 
“rail-holders” (10 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/10/chris-grayling-oxford-cambridge-line-verney-junction>
). The correct term is “chairs”; a more accurate and poetic term.

• Perhaps Theresa May wanted to show Nicky Morgan who really wears the 
trousers (The wronged trousers, 10 December

).

• A bumblebee has been feeding on our winter-flowering clematis for the fifth 
day in succession this week, even with two nights of frost. A hardy native or 
an immigrant from Northern Europe?
