Club officials did not give a reason for the coaching staff departing but said 
they hope to announce an interim or permanent coach “in the coming hours”.

The 50-year-old joined the club in 2013, helping win promotion to La Liga and 
leading Villarreal to three straight top-six finishes. They reached the Europa 
League semi-finals last season,losing to Liverpool

, and finished fourth in the league, earning a place in the Champions League 
play-offs.

Villarreal play Monaco next Wednesday, with the return leg six days later – 
and start their league season at Granada on Saturday.

The news comes a day after the club also lost the striker Roberto Soldado for 
six months owing to a cruciate ligament tear. The 31-year-old’s injury means 
the summer signing Alexandre Pato is their only fit striker.

A club statement said: “Tests have confirmed Soldado suffered an anterior 
cruciate ligament tear and a torn external meniscus in his right knee. He will 
undergo surgery in the next few days.”
