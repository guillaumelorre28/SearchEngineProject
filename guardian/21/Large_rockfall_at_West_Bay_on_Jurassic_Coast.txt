A popular stretch of the Jurassic Coast in Dorset has been hit by a large rock 
fall. It happened at the East Cliff side of West Bay, near Bridport, at about 
7.40pm on Tuesday. Police, coastguards, the fire service and local authorities 
are investigating.

It is not thought that anyone was trapped following the fall but further 
assessments are being carried out by geology experts. A cordon has been put in 
place and the coastal path is closed from the east side of West Bay to Burton 
Bradstock.

Ch Insp Steve White of Dorset police said: “Although at this stage it is not 
thought anyone has been trapped by the fall, I would appeal to the public that, 
in the unlikely event that you are aware of someone who has not returned home 
from West Bay this evening, please report the details to the police urgently 
via 999.

“We would like to remind people that the cliffs remain unstable and it is 
possible further rock falls could occur. We urge the public to obey warning 
signs, not to stand near the edge of cliffs or stand directly underneath them. 
Landslides and rock falls can happen at any time and without warning.”

West Bay is part of the Jurassic Coast world heritage site and is popular with 
holidaymakers and tourists. Cliff falls and landslips are commonplace on the 
Jurassic Coast, where the power of the sea is continually eroding the coastline.


One of the biggest was in 2008 when 1,312ft (400 metres) of cliff slipped and 
blocked a beach between Lyme Regis and Charmouth. In 2012, Charlotte Blackman 
was killed when 400 tonnes of rock collapsed on to Hive Beach at Burton 
Bradstock.

Sally King, visitor manager for the Jurassic Coast World heritage site, said: 
“We have geologists making an assessment of the situation and then we will have 
a better idea of just how big this was and what caused it – but certainly it 
was a very large fall.

“Rock falls like this one are completely unpredictable and can and do happen 
at any time as has been the case here. Our advice is to always to tell people 
to stay well away from the cliffs.

“It is very, very lucky that nobody was hurt – people are continuing to go 
near the cliff despite the fact there are lots of signs warning people to stay 
away.”

It is thought that about 300 to 400 tons of rock fell during the landslip.
