Gary Ablett has stood down as Gold Coast’s captain for the 2017 AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> season. The under-siege star, who 
requested a release from the club earlier this year and missed the beginning of 
the Suns’ pre-season on a delayed honeymoon, said a decision had been made at 
the end of last season.

“I feel it is the right time for a change, both for the club and for me,” he 
said.

He said he had met with Suns coach Rodney Eade, where it was agreed the team’s 
younger stars were ready to take over the leadership of the team.

“When I got injured last season, we handed the role over to Tom Lynch and 
Steven May and both guys, with the help of their team-mates, did an outstanding 
job,” Ablett said.

“It became obvious to me then that we now have the calibre of leaders that are 
capable of leading the footy club into our next phase.”

Ablett told the Gold Coast playing group of his decision to relinquish the 
duties on Tuesday, just a week after former Gold Coast defender Campbell Brown 
claimed some of the 32-year-old’s team-mates were disgruntled he had missed the 
first few days of training.

However Eade paid tribute to Ablett’s leadership since the club’s foundation 
in 2011. “Gary and I agreed on a transition a couple of months ago but it was 
appropriate that he tell his teammates first,” Eade said.

“As a club we have had some time to think through the process and we will be 
in a position to appoint a captain in the coming weeks.”
