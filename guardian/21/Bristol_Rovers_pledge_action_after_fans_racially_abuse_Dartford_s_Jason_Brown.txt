Bristol Rovers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolrovers> have said 
they are working with police to identify fans who racially abused the Dartford 
goalkeeper Jason Brown during their 1-0 Conference win on Tuesday.

Rovers said in a statement 
<http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-08.10.14-2004802.aspx>
 that the abuse had come from “one or more of our supporters who were on the 
terrace behind his goal”, and promised a full investigation to identify and ban 
those involved.

The club said: “Bristol Rovers operates a zero tolerance approach to abusive 
behaviour and, after all of our efforts to eliminate racial abuse from the 
Memorial Stadium, we are devastated at last night’s incident.

“A small minority of so-called supporters are bringing our club into disrepute 
and we run the risk of attracting a punishment from the FA should we continue 
to experience problems such as this.

“Just one week after the Eastleigh chairman praised the behaviour of our 
supporters, we are now investigating a very serious matter that happened in our 
own stadium and it is imperative that those responsible for last night’s 
incident are caught and punished.”
