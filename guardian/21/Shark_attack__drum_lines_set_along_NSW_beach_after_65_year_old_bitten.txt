Drum lines have been dropped along a beach on the New South Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> mid-north coast 
where a 65-year-old surfer was attacked by a shark on Thursday.

Colin Rowland was bitten by what is believed to have been a great white shark 
measuring between 2.5 metres and 3.5 metres while surfing at Seven Mile beach, 
south of Forster.

The beach, along with the nearby Booti Booti, Boomerang and Elizabeth beaches, 
were closed immediately after the attack and were due to reopen at midday on 
Friday.

Shortly after Thursday’s attack, the primary industries minister, Niall Blair, 
announced that drum lines would be immediately deployed.

Five were set on Friday morning around Bulls Paddock, a popular surfing spot 
on the southern end of Seven Mile beach, where Rowland was attacked.

Rowland was helped by a fellow surfer, who pulled him on to his board and swam 
him ashore after the attack.

Footage from several media outlets showed Rowland arriving at Newcastle’s John 
Hunter hospital giving a thumbs-up to cameras while strapped to a stretcher, 
telling the awaiting media: “I’m a bit out of it but I am alive, that is the 
main thing.’’

He has since undergone surgery.

In his 54 years of surfing almost every day, Rowland said he had never seen a 
shark, the Newcastle Herald reported.

The attack is the sixth in NSW this year.

The state government has recently come under fire for overseeing the 
installation of shark nets at Ballina, on the north coast, following many 
attacks in that area.
