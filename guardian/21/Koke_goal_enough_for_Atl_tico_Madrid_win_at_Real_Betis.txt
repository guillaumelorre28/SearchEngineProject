Despite some slick attacking play, Atlético missed great chances to build on 
the lead with Antoine Griezmann particularly profligate, including a late 
chance that came back off a post.

But the visitors were rarely threatened defensively and go above misfiring 
Real Madrid, who werecrushed 4-0 by Barcelona

 inEl Clásico on Saturday.

Atlético have 26 points from 12 games, four fewer than Barca and two more than 
Real.

“We could have scored a lot more but the important thing is the win,” Koke 
said after a typically hard-working team performance. “We knew it would be a 
tough match and the early goal made it easier for us.

“It is nothing more than an anecdote that we are second at the moment and it 
would be a mistake for us to think of anything more than trying to finish 
third. That is our target. We will concentrate on that and then see what 
happens.”
