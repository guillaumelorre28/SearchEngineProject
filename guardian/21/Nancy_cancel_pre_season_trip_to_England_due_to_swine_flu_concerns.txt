The Ligue 1 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> side Nancy 
have cancelled their pre-season trip to England due to concerns over the recent 
outbreaks of swine flu.

Nancy had been scheduled to visit England at the start of August for friendly 
matches againstWest Bromwich Albion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom> and Crystal Palace, but have 
now scheduled a domestic fixture against Auxerre instead.

"The Nancy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nancy> staff have judged it 
reasonable not to take the slightest risk a week before the start of the Ligue 
1 championship and have preferred instead to arrange another match, against 
Auxerre on Saturday, August 1," read a club statement.

Nancy had been due to play West Brom on 1 August and Palace the following day.
