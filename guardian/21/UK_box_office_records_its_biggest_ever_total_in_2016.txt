The cinema box office in the UK and Ireland achieved its best-ever results, 
amassing £1.32bn to beat the previous record set in 2015.

According to figures released by the box-office tracker comScore, the total 
for 2016 was 1.45% higher than the previous year, which finished at £1.31bn. 
With several strong performers in 2015, includingStar Wars: The Force Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii> and Spectre, 2016 was 
not expected to match its results, but attendances appear to have held up.

While no film released in 2016 could match the figures recorded by Spectre and 
Force Awakens (as well as Jurassic World) there was a more even spread of 
results, with 12 films grossing more than £30m in 2016, compared to eight in 
2015.

However, there is one proviso: a quirk of the calendar means that 2016 is 
recorded as a 53-week year (with the final week running 30 December to 5 
January); compared with the equivalent period for 2015, last year’s total is 
currently 0.95% lower (though comScore expects the gap to narrow, as not all 
cinemas have reported final figures).

Two Star Wars films made the Top 10: Rogue One, which is continuing to 
dominate the box office into the new year, and The Force Awakens, which took 
most of its income in 2015 but still proved potent enough to figure here. The 
leading British film is Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which is, like 
Rogue One, far from the end of its run. The chart is dominated by sequels, 
spin-offs and remakes, with only The Secret Life of Pets counting as a fully 
original work. Walt Disney, owner of Marvel and Star Wars, as well its more 
traditional animation and storybook divisions, set a record for an individual 
studio, taking over £300m for a 22.6% market share,reflecting its wider global 
success
