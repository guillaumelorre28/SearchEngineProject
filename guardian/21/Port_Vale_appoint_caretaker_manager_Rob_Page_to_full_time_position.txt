Port Vale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portvale> have confirmed the 
appointment of their caretaker manager Rob Page on a full-time basis. The 
former Wales international had been placed in temporary charge since the 
departure of Micky Adams in September, but will now remain in control at least 
until the end of the season.

Since taking over at Vale Park, the 40-year-old has overseen impressive wins 
over Barnsley, Yeovil and Leyton Orient. Page said on the club’s website: “I am 
really pleased. I had a conversation with the chairman and he has offered me 
the opportunity to manage the club, which I am very grateful for.

“I think the difference in the approach to games, especially at home, is there 
for everyone to see and long may it continue. This is a proud moment for myself 
and I would like to thank the fans and players for their support, which will 
continue to be important in the future.”

The Vale chairman, Norman Smurthwaite, added: “Having stepped up under 
difficult circumstances, I am pleased with the way in which Rob has implemented 
an attractive style of play and turned round the club’s home form. It has been 
a difficult few months but I believe this signals the start of a new era at the 
club and that this is the best possible outcome for the fans, players and 
staff. Rob has stepped up to the mark and hopefully our form will continue to 
go from strength to strength under his leadership.”
