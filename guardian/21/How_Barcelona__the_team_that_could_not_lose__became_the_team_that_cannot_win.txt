Gerard Piqué leapt into the air, the ball heading past Keylor Navas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/02/barcelona-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report>
 and into the net. Fifteen days later, he collapsed to his knees as the ball 
went past Diego Alves and past the post too 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/17/barcelona-valencia-la-liga-match-report>
. The location was the same – near the top right corner of the six yard box at 
north end of the Camp Nou – but everything else had changed and fast; so fast 
Barcelona could barely comprehend what had happened. The final whistle went on 
Sunday night and a long, tortuously slow walk to the tunnel followed, like a 
lonely and silent search for an explanation, but the central defender could 
find none. “It’s incredible that the stars have aligned against us like this,” 
he said.


When Piqué scored the opening goal in the 56th minute of the clásico, it moved 
Barcelona 13 points ahead of Real Madrid, nine clear of Atlético. It was 9.45pm 
on Saturday April 2 and the title race was over.Or so everyone thought 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/04/real-madrid-win-barcelona-changes-things-la-liga-sid-lowe>
. But when Piqué controlled on his chest and struck wide last night, it denied 
Barcelona an equaliser and left them just one point ahead of Madrid, none at 
all ahead of Atlético. It was 10.15pm on Sunday April 18 and as this last 
chance slipped away in the 89th minute, so did their hopes. Barely a fortnight 
had passed, two and a third games, but he’d gone from flying to fallen.


They all had.


Win the clásico and Madrid will be out of it, Luis Enrique had said. Zinedine 
Zidane had already conceded defeat a couple of weeks before. And as for Diego 
Simeone, he warned of Barça that “these guys don’t make mistakes”. But, 
suddenly, they did make mistakes and lots of them. Piqué put Barcelona into the 
lead, one goal and 13 points ahead of their rivals, but Madridcame back to beat 
them 2-1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/04/real-madrid-win-barcelona-changes-things-la-liga-sid-lowe>
, the first team to do so after 39 matches. The team that couldn’t lose 
couldn’t win; 39 unbeaten became a solitary win in five, and a worthless one at 
that. Spanish football hasn’t seen a collapse this spectacular, unexpected or 
absurd since ... well, since any given penalty area on any given Sunday.

Barcelona thought it was done, which may be part of the reason why it wasn’t. 
Now, they fear it’s gone. The treble has; the league could follow. The 
advantage was huge; now only head-to-head keeps Barcelona top.Hay Liga, that’s 
for sure

. Out of the Champions League,Sunday night’s 2-1 defeat to Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/apr/17/barcelona-v-valencia-la-liga-live>
 was Barcelona’s third in a row in the league and leaves them having collected 
just one point from 12. They’ve not endured a run this bad since 2003 when the 
man who admits to beingthe worst president in the club’s history 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/dec/16/europeanfootball.sport1> was 
in charge and when Louis Van Gaal was in a second spell that drew the simplest 
and cruellest of conclusions fromculés: that they were right to hate him the 
first time.


 Few foresaw this, although Gareth Bale was among those who did. “You never 
know, football does funny things to teams when you lose and you never know what 
could happen,” he said after theclásico. “All they need is a few bad results 
and we need a few good ones and we’re right back in it.” Not just them, either: 
Atlético too.


Something funny has certainly happened to Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>. Funny strange, that is, not 
funny ha ha, although there are plenty laughing their heads off. They’ve had 
plenty of opportunities to end it, given a second chance, and a third, and a 
fourth, but they’ve failed to take any of them. And now look where they are. No 
more second chances, no more cushion.

Against Villarreal they were 2-0 up when they brought on Jérémy Mathieu late 
in the second half and he scored an own goalin a 2-2 draw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/20/villarreal-barcelona-la-liga-match-report>
. Some acted like it was a good result, but it wasn’t, even if Villarreal are 
an excellent side. Then came the international break, followed by theclásico. 
And that’s when it really began to fall apart.


Barcelona were due to play Atlético three days later 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/05/barcelona-atletico-madrid-champions-league-match-report>
 in the Champions League and not only did they play theclásico like a team 
whose players had crossed the Atlantic, they also played like a team that knew 
that they had Atlético three days later; they appeared to be trying to hold 
something back – as they have done for months, in fact, which may just be part 
of the problem. Is it really so easy to shift back up through the gears? They 
seemed happy at 0-0 and so, in truth, did Madrid. They were happier at 1-0. But 
Madrid weren’t and, after a stampede in the final 20 minutes, Zidane’s side 
came back to win.


Still, it was in Barcelona’s hands, their grip firm. “Realistically, there 
probably isn’t a title race, no,”some fool wrote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/04/real-madrid-win-barcelona-changes-things-la-liga-sid-lowe>
. “If we win at Anoeta, we’ll be champions,” ran one Catalan cover the 
following weekend, claiming that was the belief within the squad. They might 
have been right too but instead,they lost 1-0 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/09/real-sociedad-barcelona-la-liga-match-report>
. Champions Leagueelimination followed, against Atlético 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/13/atletico-madrid-barcelona-champions-league-match-report>
. And then this.

This was different. This time Barcelona attacked; this time they played pretty 
well. At times, at least. There they were coming forward in waves, rolling over 
their visitors. There was intensity and intent, the ball moved quickly, chances 
created. Lots and lots of them, right from the start. A run through the notes 
from the Camp Nou tells a story: “Suárez volley. Messi, superbly saved Diego 
Alves. Six yards. Messi, Rakitic, Suárez, scuffed. Fast. Messi, Alba, Suárez. 
Neymar: should score. Clean through, lob, Alves slaps it away. Suárez over, 
from one yard. Messi: Alves save. 20’. Impressive start, this.” But somewhere 
in the middle of it all, the scrawl says: “what a chance, Rodrigo!” And then it 
says, in capitals: “1-0 Valencia!”

A cross from Guilherme Siqueira was deflected past Claudio Bravo by Ivan

. Barcelona could barely believe it; now they had to rebel and they did. 
Although they had not overturned a 2-0 deficit at home since 1947, it looked 
like they might turn this match aroundwhen Messi scored to make it 2-1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/apr/17/barcelona-v-valencia-la-liga-live?page=with:block-5713e8eae4b0ef2dcefa8a14#block-5713e8eae4b0ef2dcefa8a14>
. It sounded like it too: the Camp Nou was roaring. But it didn’t happen; there 
were shots, Valencia getting deeper, but there were fewer chances now; more 
offsides than opportunities. And when Piqué controlled and shot wide in the 
89th minute, it was over. Somehow, they had lost. They had lost a lot.The lot?

“It seems inexplicable but it happens,” Iniesta tweeted. “That’s football 
too,” Rakitic said. “It could have finished 3-2 or 4-3 or 5-4,” Pako Ayestarán 
admitted, while Luis Enrique insisted: “This is the path.” Gerard Piqué said: 
“I would almost rather lose playing like that than win playing the way we have 
recently.”

There was something in that point: at least there was a reaction from 
Barcelona, some football too. Some of the pace and precision so lacking in 
recent weeks. The way they played suggested that Luis Enrique may be right to 
insist that there is no physical problem, although doubts linger there.

Yet this did not always convince, and that is a familiar feeling: going back 
even to when they were winning, victories disguising flaws. Their best players 
last night were probably Piqué and Javier Mascherano, which is not exactly a 
good sign. The midfield again lacked control, failing to impose itself on the 
game. The two full-backs, Jordi Alba and Sergi Roberto, delivered incredibly 
few decent balls into the area; when Alba at last did, Messi scored. Suárez 
continues to miss chances he didn’t before. Neymar’s form has fallen 
alarmingly. And it was telling that Luis Enrique did not use a single 
substitution: he didn’t even send anyone out to warm up. On the bench were four 
full-backs, a central defender, a sub goalkeeper and Munir.

Above all, there’s a reality, once so avoidable but unavoidable now. Barcelona 
began this game knowing that they had to win after Madrid and Atlético had 
beaten Getafe and Granada, but they didn’t. Again. “Hunted!” runs the cover of 
AS. “Just one point!” they had said the day before. Now the gap at the top of 
the table was nought to Atlético, a solitary point to Real. The league has not 
looked like this for a long time. Barcelona 76, Atlético 76, Madrid 75. The 
cushion has gone; Barça can afford no more slip ups and, while Ayestarán said 
“they can win five, eight or 10”, when he was asked if Barcelona could win all 
five games, one would be a start as a new league title race opens up; a 
fascinating, tense five game sprint to the finish.

Pos Team P GD Pts 
1 Barcelona 33 58 76 
2 Atletico Madrid 33 41 76 
3 Real Madrid 33 68 75 
4 Villarreal 33 14 60 
5 Athletic Bilbao 33 7 54 
“People wanted an equal league; well, you’ve got it,” Piqué said. Three 
Spanish teams with an almost equal chance of winning the title and four Spanish 
teams with a chance of a double this season: Barcelona, Atlético, Madrid and 
also Sevilla, who are in the Europa league semi-finals and face Barça in the 
Copa del Rey final.

That would be a huge achievement for any of them, of course. Yet for 
Barcelona, having chased a treble, having had the league virtually in their 
hands, it almost feels like an obligation now and a far from easy one, even if 
they do have that head-to head advantage and despite Piqué last night 
insisting: “I am absolutely convinced that we are going to do it.” Right now it 
would be tempting to suggest they are the least likely of the three to win the 
league. The momentum has shifted: Barcelona have lost three on the trot; Madrid 
have won seven in a row; Atlético have won seven of their last eight. And, 
speaking of obligation and the pressure it applies, Diego Simeone last night 
tweeted “objective fulfilled” after Atlético mathematically confirmed a 
Champions League place. That sheep’s clothing suits him. It could be that the 
fixture list does as well.

Madrid and Atlético have the Champions League too of course but even the 
apparent “advantage” of being out of Europe may be no such advantage for 
Barcelona: with fixtures this Wednesday, there will be no break for them, no 
seven-day preparation for each match. In fact, they will play three times in 
six days, starting in La Coruña – where they will be without Piqué, who is 
vital. Atlético go to Bilbao. Madrid face Villarreal and at 10pm: they kick off 
knowing the results from the other two. Mind you, Barcelona “know” the results 
too. Asked last night if he thought that his team would need to win all five to 
take the title, and if they were capable of doing that, Luis Enrique responded: 
“Yes and yes.”

“We’ve used up all our credit but win five games and we win the league,” he 
said. “It’s a wonderful challenge and one we happily accept.”
