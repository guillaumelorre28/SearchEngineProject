The winger Mikel Oyarzabal headed the only goal for Sociedad in the fifth 
minute against Barça, who were without their top scorer Luis Suárez through 
suspension and fielded a much-changed side and managed only five shots on 
target.

Luis Enrique’s side have 76 points with six games to go, three ahead of 
Atlético and four in front of Real Madrid.

After going unbeaten in all competitions for six months, Barcelona followed 
last week’s2-1 defeat by Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/02/barcelona-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report>
 with another slip-up. The European champions are without a victory in three 
league games, their longest stretch since Luis Enrique took charge in 2014.

The coach made four changes to the team that lost to Real Madrid, bringing 
back the midfielder Rafinha after a six-month injury absence and starting 
without Andrés Iniesta, Jordi Alba and Ivan Rakitic.

Barça were handed their fifth defeat in six visits to Sociedad after the 
18-year-old Oyarzabal nodded in a cross from Xabi Prieto.

The visitors struggled to get back in the game and the Sociedad goalkeeper 
Gerónimo Rulli did well to save from Lionel Messi twice, substitute Iniesta and 
Arda Turan.
