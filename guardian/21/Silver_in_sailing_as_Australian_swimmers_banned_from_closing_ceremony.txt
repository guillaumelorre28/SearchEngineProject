Australia has won a pair of silver medals at the sailing regatta overnight, 
with Nathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen second in the men’s 49er race, while Mat 
Belcher and Will Ryan repeated the feat in the men’s 470. The news was not so 
good overnight for swimmers Emma McKeon and Josh Palmer, who have both been 
banned from attending the Olympic closing ceremony.

Jensen and Outteridge edged ahead of their German rivals in the 49er medal 
race but couldn’t quite get past New Zealanders Peter Burling and Blair Tuke, 
who wrapped up gold. Earlier fellow Australian sailors Belcher and Ryan took 
silver in the men’s 470. The pair were guaranteed a medal going into the final 
but had to chase down Greece to finish second, while Croatia won the gold.

It was a dramatic finish to the even for Ryan, who ended up in the water at 
one point, but he and Belcher recovered to avoid heartbreak in the medal race. 
Belcher was aiming to defend the title he won in London four years ago with 
Malcolm Page. “I just slipped and fell straight in,” said Ryan of this fall 
into the water. “Fortunately Matt pulled me back out of the water one-handed 
pretty quickly and got me back into the boat and back into the race.”

The other medal overnight went to Australian sprint kayakers Ken Wallace and 
Lachlan Tame, who won bronze in the men’s K2 1000m. The pair trailed champion 
Germans Max Rendschmidt and Marcus Gross, with Serbia winning silver.

Meanwhile, Australian swimmers Josh Palmer and Emma McKeon have been banned 
from the closing ceremony and must now stay in the village between 8 p.m. and 8 
a.m. after staying out all night in Rio. A drunken Palmer was robbed of $1000 
while McKeon spent the night with friends in Copacabana without telling team 
management.

Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) chef de mission Kitty Chiller confirmed 
that both swimmers had failed to return to the Olympic village on Tuesday night 
following a night out in Rio with teammates, and that she had punished the 
pair. Swimming Australia said on Thursday it supports the AOC’s decision. 
According to Swimming Australia, McKeon got separated from team members at a 
nightclub Tuesday and instead of traveling alone back to the village, she 
stayed with two female friends in Copacabana. Her failure to advise officials 
of her whereabouts violated team rules.

Palmer also got separated from teammates and continued to drink alone, 
Swimming Australia said. Australian coach Jacco Verhaeren said McKeon and 
Palmer conducted themselves professionally during the Games and were being 
punished for risking their safety. McKeon won four medals in Rio – gold, two 
silvers and one bronze. Palmer finished 30th in the 100-meter breaststroke.

Elsewhere among the remaining Australian medal chances, Sam Willoughby is best 
placed in the BMX, where his gold medal hopes soared after some big names 
crashed out of contention. Willoughby was the only rider to win all his races 
in the men’s quarter-finals. Golfer Minjin Lee led the women’s golf after 10 
holes of the second round and remains in medal contention after its completion, 
sitting in seventh place. Damien Birkinhead has finished ninth in qualifying to 
ease into the men’s shot put final.


Australia’s Boomers will face Serbia on Saturday morning Australian time for a 
place in the gold medal game of the men’s basketball competition. The 
Australians have five wins from six games in the tournament and have already 
beaten Serbia earlier in the Games.

“It is exciting,” said star center Andrew Bogut. “You would be silly not to be 
excited to be in this situation. It doesn’t come around very often – we haven’t 
been in the (semi-finals) for nearly two decades and to fight for a medal is 
great. Serbia is a very tough team. If you look at the FIBA rankings we weren’t 
meant to be here in the top four. We have a group of guys that have played NBA 
finals, played in game sevens, played in the Euro League finals. We know what 
to expect – we have played in big games.”

Australian Aaron Royle finished ninth in the men’s triathlon as Great 
Britain’s Brownlee brothers – Alistair and Jonny – dominated race with gold and 
silver respectively.
