James DeGale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> moved a step 
closer to a world title shot after comfortably defending his WBC silver super 
middleweight crown with a unanimous points decision victory over Dyah Davis at 
Glow, Bluewater in Kent.

The 2008 Olympic gold medallist was dominant for the majority of the fight, 
although he had to recover from a slight lapse in the middle rounds to ensure a 
success he had claimed would be secured in style.

Davis' resilience ensured that would not be the case, but the American never 
possessed the power to cause any undue concern that DeGale might suffer an 
unexpected blip to his world title plans. The Brit was easily the better 
fighter for the opening six rounds with a quick combination at the end of the 
first round, which forced Davis into immediate protection mode, a sign of 
things to come.

DeGale quickly grew in confidence, prompting him to exchange words with Davis 
at the end of the fourth and sixth rounds, and a right hook cracked back the 
challengers' head as he leaned against the ropes.

The American battled back in the next few rounds to belatedly claim back some 
ground, even landing a rare well-aimed right flush on the home hopeful.

DeGale's response was more than enough to ensure Davis' recovery never 
amounted to much, although the Briton admitted he had been left slightly 
frustrated afterwards.

"I made a fast start. It was nice. I was a bit lazy and switched off a couple 
of times," he told Channel Five.

"I'm not fully pleased to be honest. I maybe switched off a bit and got hit by 
a stupid shot. It's another 12 rounds under my belt."

DeGale found plenty of comfort in the performance, though, adding: "It was all 
right. I'm glad I stuck to my boxing. I could have been silly and come forward 
and got hit. I'm pleased I stood back.

"I'm learning, I'm still learning. He's an awkward opponent."
