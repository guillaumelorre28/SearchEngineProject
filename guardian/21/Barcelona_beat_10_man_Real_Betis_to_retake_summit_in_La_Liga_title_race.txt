Real Madrid had earlier been keeping the summit warm, following a 1-0 win at 
Real Sociedad

, before Atlético overtook them with a1-0 win at home to Rayo Vallecano

.

Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> were always 
unlikely to slip up at 13th-placed Betis, even less so once Heiko Westermann 
had been dismissed for his second yellow card 10 minutes before half-time. And, 
while the response from Barça was not immediate, once Ivan Rakitic had taken 
advantage of a defensive mix-up between defender Germán Pezzella and goalkeeper 
Antonio Adán in the home area, the result rarely seemed in much doubt.

Barcelona made sure inside the final 10 minutes when Lionel Messi slid a pass 
through to Luis Suárez and the Uruguayan scored his 54th goal of an impressive 
season.

Luis Enrique’s side will complete their campaign with a city derby against 
Espanyol at Camp Nou before travelling to struggling Granada, knowing two wins 
will be enough for a 24th league title.
