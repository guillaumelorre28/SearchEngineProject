A policy on health service spending (Labour calls for OBR-style watchdog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/27/labour-calls-for-obr-style-watchdog-to-assess-nhs-finances>
 to assess NHS finances, 28 December) is meaningless without a policy on health 
creation. Most diseases are not random. Your chances of getting ill or dying 
are greatly increased by social and psychological adversity, some of which is 
preventable by early intervention. This means massive public investment in 
comprehensive perinatal health, in paid parental leave, children’s centres and 
early years education. But also the recognition that insecurity – especially in 
housing and employment – damages health through the physical stress it causes. 
Michael Marmot’s bookThe Health Gap 
<http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-health-gap-9781408857991/> (2015) chronicles 
this data in readable detail. NHS funding cannot be taken out of politics 
because its costs depend so much on the impact of other policies, especially 
those that aggravate inequalities. The Labour party knows this but must 
demonstrate that in its policy proposals.
