Chelsea are in pole position to sign the Ghana defender Baba Rahman from FC 
Augsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg>, with the German club 
expecting an opening bid of around £14m for the 21-year-old this week.

With Filipe Luís, the Brazil full-back, set to leave Stamford Bridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/02/baba-rahman-chelsea-manchester-city-arsenal-augsburg>
 and return to Atlético Madrid for £16m after just one season in the Premier 
League, José Mourinho has moved quickly to replace him by following up earlier 
interest in Rahman.

The Italian champions Juventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> 
have also indicated that they are ready to make a bid along with Roma, although 
Rahman is understood to prefer a move to the Premier League.

Augsburg are holding out for a fee of €25m (£17.5m), although they are likely 
to accept slightly less for a player who joined them from Greuther Fürth only 
last summer.

Manchester City and Arsenal also registered an interest

in signing Rahman at the end of last season but that appears to have cooled.
