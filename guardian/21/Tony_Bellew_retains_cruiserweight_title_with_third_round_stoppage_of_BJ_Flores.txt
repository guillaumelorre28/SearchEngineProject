Tony Bellew retained his WBC world cruiserweight title in emphatic style with 
a third-round stoppage of BJ Flores.

It looked like the fight might not even last that long when Bellew had the 
challenger down on the canvas three times in the second round, but each time 
the American beat the count.

Immediately after the fight, the 33-year-old jumped out of the ring to 
confront David Haye, who was in attendance at ringside and has been touted as 
Bellew’s next opponent.

Flores took on Bellew early on 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/26/anthony-joshua-defeat-dominic-breazeale>
 and had some success with the jab and body combination but the champion 
finished the round strongly and carried that into round two. He soon had Flores 
on the canvas but the American complained to the referee about a low blow.

Bellew took full advantage of Flores’s loss of focus and floored him again.

Amazingly, Flores was then down for a third time but once more he regained his 
feet and made it to the third round.

Bellew sensed blood and did not waste any time in stopping his opponent. The 
Liverpudlian threw a flurry of body shots and haymakers and the challenger 
simply could not handle his power.

A big left hook proved to be the last act as Flores was knocked down again and 
the referee put him out of his misery by stopping the fight.
