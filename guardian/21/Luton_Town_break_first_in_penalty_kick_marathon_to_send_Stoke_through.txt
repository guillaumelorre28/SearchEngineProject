Jonathan Walters gave Stoke the lead in the 67th minute, a fantastic flick 
from Stephen Ireland sending his team-mate through to lob Elliot Justham in the 
Luton goal.

However, in injury time the Luton substitute Cameron McGeehan got on the end 
of Scott Griffiths’ left-wing cross to send the game in to extra time.

The sides could not be separated in the subsequent 30 minutes, and it was only 
after 14 successful spot-kicks that Griffiths’ effort hit the crossbar. The 
Stoke substitute Geoff Cameron fired the winning penalty beyond Justham to earn 
his side a trip to Fulham, once managed by Stoke’s manager Mark Hughes.
