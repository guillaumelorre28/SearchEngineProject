President Evo Morales called on local governments to devote funds and workers 
to drill wells and transport water to cities in vehicles, with the support of 
the armed forces, from nearby bodies of water.

 “We have to be prepared for the worst,” Morales said at a press conference, 
adding that the current crisis was an opportunity to “plan large investments” 
to adapt to the effects of climate change on the country’s water supply.

 The national state of emergency comes after 172 of the country’s 339 
municipalities declared their own emergencies related to the drought.

 Last week, residents of El Alto, near La Paz, briefly held authorities with a 
local water distribution company hostage to demand the government explain its 
plans to mitigate the shortage.

 The drought has prompted protests in major cities and conflicts between 
miners and farmers over the use of aquifers.
