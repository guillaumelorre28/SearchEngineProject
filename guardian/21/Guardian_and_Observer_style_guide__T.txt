terrorism, terrorists
A terrorist act is directed against victims chosen either randomly or as 
symbols of what is being opposed (eg workers in the World Trade Centre, 
tourists in Bali, Spanish commuters). It is designed to create a state of 
terror in the minds of a particular group of people or the public as a whole 
for political or social ends. Although most terrorist acts are violent, you can 
be a terrorist without being overtly violent (eg poisoning a water supply or 
gassing people on the underground).

Does having a good cause make a difference? The UN says no: “Criminal acts 
calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public are in any 
circumstances unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, 
philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other nature that may 
be invoked to justify them.”

Whatever one’s political sympathies, suicide bombers, the 9/11 attackers and 
most paramilitary groups can all reasonably be regarded as terrorists (or at 
least groups some of whose members perpetrate terrorist acts).

Nonetheless we need to be very careful about using the term: it is still a 
subjective judgment – one person’s terrorist may be another person’s freedom 
fighter, and there are former “terrorists” holding elected office in many parts 
of the world. Some critics suggest that, for the Guardian, all terrorists are 
militants – unless their victims are British. Others may point to what they 
regard as “state terrorism”. Often, alternatives such as militants, radicals, 
separatists, etc, may be more appropriate and less controversial, but this is a 
difficult area: references to the “resistance”, for example, imply more 
sympathy to a cause than calling such fighters “insurgents”. The most important 
thing is that, in news reporting, we are not seen – because of the language we 
use – to be taking sides.

Note that the phrase “war on terror” should always appear in quotes, whether 
used by us or (more likely) quoting someone else

that
Do not use automatically after the word “said”, but it can be useful: you tend 
to read a sentence such as “he said nothing by way of an explanation would be 
forthcoming” as “he said nothing by way of an explanation” and then realise 
that it does not say that at all; “he said that nothing by way of an 
explanation would be forthcoming” is much clearer. A similar problem arises 
with verbs such as argue and warn. “He argued the case for war had not been 
made” and “he warned the case for war had not been made” both become much 
clearer if you insert “that” after the verb

that or which?
The traditional definition is that “that” defines and “which” informs (gives 
extra information), as in:
“This is the house that Jack built; but this house, which John built, is 
falling down.”
“The Guardian, which I read every day, is the paper that I admire above all 
others.”
“I am very proud of the sunflowers that I grew from seed” (some of them); “I 
am very proud of the sunflowers, which I grew from seed” (all of them).
 Note that in such examples the sentence remains grammatical without “that” 
(“this is the house Jack built,” “The Guardian is the paper I admire above all 
others,” “I am very proud of the sunflowers I grew”) but not without “which” 
(“this house, John built, is falling down”).

A word about relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses (also known as 
defining, best thought of as giving essential information by narrowing it down) 
are not enclosed by commas, whereas non-restrictive relative clauses 
(non-defining, giving non-essential information) are.

In the three examples, “which John built”, “which I read every day” and “which 
I grew from seed” are all non-restrictive. They give extra information, they 
are preceded by a comma, and they use “which” rather than “that”. If you try 
them with “that” they sound odd (“the Guardian, that I read every day”). It’s 
not the same the other way round: although “that” is more common in restrictive 
clauses, you can use “which”: “the Guardian is the paper which I read every 
day”.

A formula that may help simplify things:
Restrictive clauses – “that” (desirable), no comma (essential).
Non-restrictive clauses – “which”, comma (both essential).
So a BBC radio interviewer who asked the question “should advertising, which 
targets children, be banned?” was suggesting that all advertising targets 
children. She meant “should advertising that targets children be banned?”

the
Leaving “the” out often reads like official jargon: say the conference agreed 
to do something, not “conference agreed”; the government has to do, not 
“government has to”; the Super League (rugby), not “Super League”.

Avoid the “prime minister David Cameron” syndrome: do not use constructions 
such as “prime minister David Cameron said”. Prominent figures can just be 
named, with their function at second mention: “David Cameron said last night” 
(first mention); “the prime minister said” (subsequent mentions).

If it is thought necessary to explain who someone is, write “Nigel Adkins, the 
Sheffield United manager, said” or “the Sheffield United manager, Nigel Adkins, 
said”. In such cases the commas around the name indicate there is only one 
person in the position, so write “the Tory prime minister, David Cameron, said” 
(only one person in the job), but “the former Tory prime minister John Major 
said” (there have been many).

lc for newspapers (the Guardian), magazines (the New Statesman), pubs (the 
Coach and Horses), bands (the Black Eyed Peas, the Not Sensibles, the The), 
nicknames (the Hulk, the Red Baron), and sports grounds (the Oval).

uc for books (The Lord of the Rings), films (The Matrix), poems (The Waste 
Land), television shows (The West Wing), and works of art (The Adoration of the 
Magi).

‘the’ in name of a country
include ‘the’:
the Bahamas, the Czech Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, no 
“the”, on second mention), the Dominican Republic, the Gambia, the Marshall 
Islands, the Netherlands (but The Hague), the Northern Mariana Islands, the 
Philippines, the Seychelles, the Solomon Islands, the United Arab Emirates (the 
UAE on second mention), the United Kingdom, the United States.
no ‘the’

Ukraine, Sudan, Vatican City (but the Vatican), Yemen

theatre
the Royal National Theatre, commonly known as the National, comprises three 
auditoriums: the Olivier, the Lyttelton, and the Dorfman (formerly Cottesloe) – 
no need to add “theatre” to these, but if you do, it’s lowercase – and the 
Temporary theatre (formerly the Shed). Other theatres: lowercase for “theatre”, 
eg Adelphi theatre, Crucible theatre (but normally just Adelphi, Crucible). 
Initial cap only if “Theatre” comes first, eg Theatre Royal, Stratford East

third world
meaning not the west (first) or the Soviet Union (second), so today an 
outdated (as well as objectionable) term; use developing countries or 
developing nations

this and that
that was then, but this is now; this looks forward, that looks back: so the

son, all this will be yours.” Then he points behind him to the house and says: 
“But that remains mine”

tikka masala

till
Not an abbreviation of until, but the older word. Until sounds more natural as 
the first word of a sentence and before a verb (“Until you come back to me”); 
till works well in less formal contexts and before a noun (“till lunchtime”). 
Do not use til or ’til, despite such precedents as the Beach Boys’ sublime Til 
I Die

timebomb, timescale, timeshare

times
1am, 6.30pm, etc; 10 o’clock last night but 10pm yesterday; half past two, a 
quarter to three, 10 to 11, etc; 2hr 5min 6sec, etc; for 24-hour clock, 00.47, 
23.59; noon, midnight (not 12 noon, 12 midnight or 12am, 12pm).

The week starts on Mondays, but stories published on Sunday refer to the 
following week as “this week” and the six days preceding that Sunday as “last 
week”.

Writers must put the date in brackets when there might be ambiguity

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
John le Carré novel adapted for television by the BBC in 1979 (starring Alec 
Guinness as George Smiley) and, in September 2011, released as a feature film

tipi
closer to the original Lakota (a variety of Sioux) word thí pi, and therefore 
preferable to tepee

tipoff
one word as a noun

Tipp-Ex
TM; use correction fluid (not that many people do any more)

tipping point 
another example of jargon that has quickly become hackneyed through overuse

Tirol
not Tyrol

titbit
not tidbit

titillate
mildly excite; titivate tidy up.

 Use “tidy up” rather than titivate or readers will probably think you mean 
titillate

titles
Do not italicise or put in quotes titles of books, films, TV programmes, 
paintings, songs, albums or anything else.

Words in titles take initial caps except for a, and, at, for, from, in, of, 
on, the, to (except in initial position or after a colon): A Tale of Two 
Cities, Happy End of the World, Shakespeare in Love, Superman: The Early Years, 
I’m in Love With the Girl on a Certain Manchester Megastore Checkout Desk, etc.

Exception: the Review and the Observer, which still italicise titles

T-junction

to-do

to-ing and fro-ing
You need the hyphens to stop it looking like “toyng and froyng”

told the Guardian
is used far too often: it should normally be replaced by “said” and reserved 
for occasions when it genuinely adds interest or authority to a story (if 
someone got an exclusive interview with, say, Lord Lucan)

Tolkien, JRR
(1892-1973) British author and philologist, notable for writing The Lord of 
the Rings and not spelling his name “Tolkein”

tomato

tomb of the Unknown Warrior

tonnage
is measured in tons (units of volume), not tonnes (units of mass) – derived 
from the number of tuns (large barrels) a vessel could hold; registered tonnage 
is the total internal capacity of a vessel.

Displacement tonnage is its actual weight, equal to the weight of water it 
displaces, and is measured in tonnes

tonne 
not ton (but note the above): the metric tonne is 1,000kg (2,204.62lb), the 
British ton is 2,240lb, and the US ton is 2,000lb; usually there is no need to 
convert.

For figurative use, write tons (I’ve had tons of birthday cards, etc)

Top 10, Top 40, etc

Topman, Topshop

Torah, the

tornado
plural tornadoes (storm); Tornado plural Tornados (aircraft)

torpid, turbid or turgid?
There’s plenty of opportunity to get these wrong, and plenty of people do: 
torpid means apathetic or sluggish; turbid is muddy, thick or cloudy; turgid 
means congested or swollen, and therefore can be handy if you want to accuse 
someone of using bombastic or pompous language

tortuous or torturous?
A long and winding road is tortuous. 
An experience involving pain or suffering might be described as torturous 

Tory party 

total
Avoid starting court stories with variations on the formula “three men were 
jailed for a total of 19 years”, a statistic that conveys no meaningful 
information (in this case, they had been given sentences of nine, six and four 
years).

The only time this might be justified is when one person is given a series of 
life sentences, and “he was jailed for a total of 650 years” at least conveys 
how serious the crimes were

Townshend, Pete
one of the two members of the Who who didn’t die before he got old (the other

Tpims
rather than TPIMs is the abbreviation for terrorism prevention and 
investigation measures; use sparingly, however: “measures” and similar terms 
are generally preferable

track record
record should normally be sufficient

trademarks (TM)
Take care: use a generic alternative unless there is a very good reason not 
to, eg ballpoint pen, not biro (unless it really is a Biro, in which case it 
takes a cap B); say photocopy rather than Xerox, etc; you will save our 
lawyers, and those of Portakabin and various other companies, a lot of time and 
trouble

trade union
but Trades Union Congress (TUC)

tragic
People do not need to be told that an accident is “tragic”

train
a number of things in a string, such as animals, railway carriages or wagons. 
In railway terms a train is hauled by an engine or locomotive, with which it is 
not synonymous

transatlantic

transgender, trans
Where relevant, use transgender at first mention, thereafter trans, and only 
as an adjective: transgender person, trans person; never “transgendered person” 
or “a transgender”

translator
works with the written word; often confused with interpreter, who works with 
the spoken word

Transnistria
separatist region that declared its independence from Moldova in 1990, but has 
not been recognised by the international community; also known as Trans-Dniester

transpire
to emit vapour through the skin, so by analogy to become apparent, come to be 
known, not just a synonym for “occur” or “happen”; “it transpired that” usually 
sounds artificial and pompous in any case

Transport for London
TfL on second mention

Trans-Siberian railway

Travellers
capped: they are recognised as an ethnic group under the Race Relations Act;

Twitter
users, also known as tweeters (and sometimes twitterers, but not tweeps, 
please), spend much of their time sending tweets, also known as tweeting or 
twittering; the editors of Guardian Style tweet@guardianstyle 
<http://www.twitter.com/guardianstyle>.

“took to Twitter” has become a cliche, conveying a slight air of astonishment 
at the wonders of such new technology. Just say “said on Twitter” or “tweeted”. 
The same applies to “took to social media” and similar phrases.

When quoting tweets, where the aim is normally to capture the flavour and 
convey the immediate impact of an event, do not correct the grammar, spelling 
or style
