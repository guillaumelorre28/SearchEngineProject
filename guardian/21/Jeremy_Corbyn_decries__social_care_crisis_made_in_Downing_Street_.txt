Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> has vowed 
to take failing care homes into public ownership under a Labour government in a 
major speech slamming the Tories for “spectacularly” failing to spread 
Britain’s wealth evenly.

The Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leader attacked what 
he described as a rigged system where power is in the wrong hands, and accused 
the government of slashing taxes for the richest and lining the pockets of 
their friends while cutting vital public services.

Addressing the Fabian Society new year conference in his second major speech 
of 2017, Corbyn said on Saturday that the social care system was at serious 
risk of breakdown unless more money was invested by the state.

He said cuts of £4.6bn over the course of the last parliament created a 
“social care crisis made in Downing Street”. Care homes have faced rising costs 
and falling fee payments from councils, and figures from the Care Quality 
Commission showed that one in five nursing homes does not have enough staff to 
ensure adequate and safe care for residents.

“They’ve told councils to fill the gap by raising council tax that won’t even 
meet 3% of what councils are already spending on social care for the elderly,” 
Corbyn said. “They’re passing the buck to councils, shifting the blame and 
handing you the bill.”

As part of his much-anticipated “relaunch” as a champion of the people and 
anti-establishment insurgent, the Labour leader accused Theresa May of using 
overstretched GPs as scapegoats for the NHS crisis.


Family doctors and medical leaders rejected the prime minister’s demand to 
move to a seven-day week and extend opening hours at GP surgeries. Senior 
doctors have said the movecould lead to mass resignations

.

Corbyn said: “The prime minister tells us … the reason we have a crisis in the 
NHS is not because her government has slashed billions from social care budgets 
and underfunded our health service. No. She’s told her No 10 advisers to tell 
the media the real people to blame are the hard-pressed and under-pressure GPs.”

At the end of a week in which his leadership has come under fresh attack, 
Corbyn accused the Conservatives of slashing taxes for the richest – by another 
£70bn by 2022 – while cutting pay for the rest.

“They’ve sold off our country’s assets and handed over public services to be 
milked by tax dodgers,” he said. “The truth is the system simply doesn’t work 
for most people. Labour under my leadership stands for a complete break with 
this rigged system.”

Corbyn highlighted concerns about job security for young people and those 
living in poverty. He also took a swipe at the government for the handling of 
the Southern rail dispute and reiterated his support for striking drivers.

“I would rather stand on a picket line for a safely staffed railway than stand 
with the fat cat rail bosses charging rail passengers an arm and a leg,” he 
said.

The speech was considered one of the most polished and well-crafted Corbyn has 
delivered as Labour leader, with credit attributed to his new speech writer and 
political adviser David Prescott, the son of the former deputy prime minister 
John Prescott.

Corbyn outlined Labour’s pledge to address the housing crisis by building new 
homes and “hand back wealth and control to people and communities”.

The loudest cheers from the audience of about 300 came when he condemned the 
rise in racist attacks since the Brexit vote and praised the immigrants who 
“keep our NationalHealth <https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> Service 
going”.

Corbyn delivered his speech the day after the former shadow education 
secretary Tristram Hunt announced he wasstanding down as an MP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/13/tristram-hunt-to-quit-as-mp-to-become-va-director>
 to become director of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum. His departure has 
triggered a byelection in the vulnerable seat of Stoke-on-Trent Central.

The party faces a byelection in Copeland and Leigh after the resignation of 
Jamie Reed, and there have been rumours that two other senior Labour MPs are 
considering quitting.

Labour members jeered Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, for 
defending his party’s decision to put up a candidate for the Copeland 
byelection only minutes after saying Labour and the Greens should form an 
electoral pact.

In a panel session, Bartley said that if progressive parties such as Labour 
and the Greens cooperated, they could achieve seismic change at the election.

A group of Labour MPs has also backed a pamphlet calling on the party to agree 
on a series of Brexit red lines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/14/labour-mps-back-call-for-party-to-set-brexit-red-lines>
, including only leaving the EU single market if it causes no economic damage 
and defending rights over work and the environment.
