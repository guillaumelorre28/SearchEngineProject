The Football League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league> has 
supported Wycombe’s decision to fit their players with GPS-tracking devices 
during Saturday’s home defeat to Plymouth.

Derek Adams complained in the tunnel before the game at Adams Park when he 
spotted Wycombe’s players wearing the performance monitors under their shirts 
and the kick-off was delayed for six minutes.

Wycombe <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe> provided the referee 
Tim Robinson with a letter from the Football League which authorised their use 
and the players were allowed to wear the devices, but Adams was critical of the 
decision after the match.

The Plymouth manager said: “It’s a hard object and a dangerous bit of 
equipment if somebody goes into the back of another player to head the ball. I 
noticed in the tunnel and alerted the referee. I don’t think it should be 
allowed. I’m not sure what the ruling is but someone could head it, it could 
get pulled or somebody could even get choked.”

A Football League spokesman told Wycombe’s website: “Following Fifa’s decision 
to permit players to wear electronic performance and tracking devices under the 
laws of the game, the Football League has also sanctioned their use in its 
competitions.

“Clubs were notified of this rule change in writing before the start of the 
season and the matter was explained to club managers at their annual pre-season 
meetings.

“Any club seeking to use these devices is required to notify the league and 
provide relevant details relating to how they will be worn and used. To date, 
19 clubs, including Wycombe Wanderers, have registered their intention to use 
these devices.”
