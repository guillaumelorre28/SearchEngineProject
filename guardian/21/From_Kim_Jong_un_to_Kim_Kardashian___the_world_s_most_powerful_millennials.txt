For some, millennials are the cursed generation who would prefer to 
concentrate on taking2,000 selfies a year 
<http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/31/millennials-take-an-average-of-at-least-six-selfies-a-day-5472990/>
 than anything else.


For others, including many millennials themselves, they are the generation 
coming to terms with being the first in the history of the western world to be 
worse off than their parents.

And then there are the exceptions: the power millennials, who have made a 
dramatic difference to the world in the relatively short time they have existed 
on it.

From the entrepreneurs, who have radically changed the way we communicate to 
the individuals who have prematurely inherited dictatorships, we look at some 
of the planet’s most powerful people aged 20-35.

Kim Jong-un

The 33-year-old North Korean ruler, with a penchant for nuclear explosions

, took the reins of the pariah state when his father, Kim Jong-il, died 
suddenly in 2011.

with the country’s fourth nuclear test. A few weeks later he shot a rocket into 
the sky, triggering international condemnation and threats of further sanctions 
against the isolated state.

Despite early hopes that Kim may have been willing to open up the country to 
the rest of the world, North Korea’s preferred nuclear diplomacy seems here to 
stay.

What started as a social network 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia> for Mark 
Zuckerberg’s Harvard University classmates quickly ballooned to be one of the 
biggest websites in the world, used by 1.5 billion people – 20% of the world’s 
population.

So ubiquitous is Facebook that people now use it to document every aspect of 
their lives. The platform has been used by activists to organise some of the 
world’s biggest protests and “to Facebook” someone is now seen as an acceptable 
verb to some (ie. millennials). For his troubles, 31-year-old Zuckerberg, is

Justin Bieber

sex symbol has involved more than50 tattoos

accusations of monkey cruelty 
<http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/please-stop-justin-bieber-from-being-around-animals-it-only-ends-in-heartbreak-or-death>

”

At just 22, Bieber is said to be worth $200m; he has smashed records held by 
the Beatles, and Drake, for having the most songs in the Billboard Hot 100 
chart – 17 in one week – and can can proudly boast 60 million Instagram

Mohammed bin Salman

the comment

Mohammed bin Salman, who also serves as a defence minister, has recently made 
a series of power moves that have caused the world to stand up and take notice: 
from presiding over the war in Yemen to efforts to fix the country’s economic 
woes.

His cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, stands next in line for the loyal 
leadership. But some Game of Thones-esque rumours suggest Salman may surpass 
him to become the most powerful man in the Arab world. How will he cope? 
Perhaps Kim can offer some tips?

Ekaterina Tikhonova

Remember when President Vladimir Putin introduced his daughter on the world 
stage? No? That’s because it never happened.

The identity of the youngest offspring of the most powerful man in Russia was, 
until very recently, a closely guarded secret.

In January last year, opposition journalist Oleg Kashin published an article 
called “She” in which he claimed that the acrobatic rock’n’roll dancer – who 
had once represented Russia at an international dance tournament – was in fact 
Putin’s daughter.

Further media reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/russia-putin-daughter-katerina-tikhonova>
 suggested that the 29-year-old, who uses her grandmother’s surname, is married 
to Kirill Shamalov, the son of one of her father’s good mates. If it turns out 
to be true their assets could be worth up to $2bn.

While the Kremlin is yet to comment on her true identity, there’s probably no 
harm in getting yourself acquainted with some fresh faces in Russia’s elite.

Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior

Almost as prolific on Instagram as he is on the football field, the 
24-year-old Brazilian captain and Barcelona footballer is most commonly known as
Neymar <https://www.theguardian.com/football/neymar> Jr.

While fellow millennials Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are considered the 
best players in the world,Neymar’s early reputation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/21/neymar-barcelona-leo-messi-luis-suarez-arsenal-champions-league>
 “as a YouTube sensation: part anime-footballer, part agent provocateur; flash 
haircut and flasher skills” firmly cements him on this power list.

He has since proved himself to be the ultimate team player, according to the 
Guardian’s sports writer Sean Ingle.

His total earnings were $31m last year, a number expected to rise dramatically 
as his career peaks,said Forbes <http://www.forbes.com/profile/neymar/>, who 
have likened his financial model to “marketing juggernaut David Beckham”.

And while his fans were excited to see him wishing a fellow powerful 
millennial happy birthday on Twitter recently – Bieber is yet to reply.
