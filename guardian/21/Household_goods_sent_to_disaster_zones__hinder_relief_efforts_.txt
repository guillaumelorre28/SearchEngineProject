 hit last year.

Sports gear, chainsaws, carpets and woolly jumpers were among the items 
clogging up space at airports and docks.

A new report by the Red Cross highlights how unrequested goods are hindering 
disaster relief efforts and often end up in landfill. Aid groups are hoping to 
divert the generosity of Australians to cash donations because they say money 
is a more effective way to help those most in need.

Vanuatu was also inundated with unsolicited donations including high heels, 
handbags, heavy blankets and canned food in more than 70 shipping containers 
after 2015’sCyclone Pam

Ten months on from the disaster, 18 containers remained uncollected and had 
accumulated $2m is storage fees. More than half the canned food items had 
expired.

The Red Cross said containers of unsolicited goods diverted relief workers’ 
attention from helping the worst-affected people.

A spokeswoman for the Australian Council for International Development, Joanna 
Pradela, said people’s well-meaning actions were doing more harm than good. 
“Instead of donating household items, we would encourage people to sell them 
online or at garage sales and local markets, and donate the proceeds,” she said.

The Red Cross report acknowledged that humanitarian agencies had to do more to 
build community trust that donated money would be used in an effective and 
timely manner.
