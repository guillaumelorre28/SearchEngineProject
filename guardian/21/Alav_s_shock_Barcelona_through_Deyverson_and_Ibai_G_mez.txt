defending La Liga champions guessed wrong, as the visitors pulled off a 
stunning 2-1 upset at the Camp Nou.

Paco Alcacer and the goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen made their debuts for 
Barcelona, and Neymar saw his first minutes for the Catalan club since 
returning from a long summer with Brazil, which included a gold medal at the 
Rio Olympics.

Barcelona appeared to be in control until Kiko Femenia crossed for Deyverson, 
who muscled past Javier Mascherano before poking the ball under Cillessen.

Jérémy Mathieu headed Barcelona level right after half-time, only for Ibai 
Gómez to put Alavés back in front after a poor clearance by Mascherano.

“We worked very hard for this,” Mauricio Pellegrino, Alavés’s new coach, said. 
“I hope the team can keep growing and that this will help us going forward.” It 
was the club’s first win in Spain’s top flight since a 10-year run in the 
second and third divisions.

“We didn’t have our day,” Luis Enrique said. “We were imprecise, and they 
scored two goals on three shots. That is a good summary of the match.”
