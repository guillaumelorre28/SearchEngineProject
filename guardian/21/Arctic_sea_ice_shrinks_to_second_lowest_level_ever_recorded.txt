Arctic <https://www.theguardian.com/world/arctic> sea ice this summer shrank 
to its second lowest level since scientists started to monitor it by satellite, 
with scientists saying it is another ominous signal of global warming.

The National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado said the sea ice reached its 
summer low point

 on Saturday, extending 4.14m sq km (1.6m sq miles). That’s behind onlythe mark 
set in 2012

, 3.39m sq km.

Center director Mark Serreze said this year’s level technically was 10,000 sq 
km less than 2007, but that’s so close the two years are essentially tied.

Even though this year didn’t set a record, “we have reinforced the overall 
downward trend. There is no evidence of recovery here,” Serreze said. “We’ve 
always known that the Arctic is going to be the early warning system for 
climate change. What we’ve seen this year is reinforcing that.”

This year’s minimum level is nearly 2.56m sq km smaller than the 1979 to 2000 
average. That’s the size of Alaska and Texas combined.

“It’s a tremendous loss that we’re looking at here,” Serreze said.

It was an unusual year for sea ice in the Arctic, Serreze said. In the winter, 
levels were among their lowest ever for the cold season, but then there were 
more storms than usual over the Arctic during the summer. Those storms normally 
keep the Arctic cloudy and cooler, but that didn’t keep the sea ice from 
melting this year, he said.

“Summer weather patterns don’t matter as much as they used to, so we’re kind 
of entering a new regime,” Serreze said.

Serreze said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Arctic was essentially ice free

 in the summer by 2030, something that will affect international security.

“The trend is clear and ominous,” National Center for Atmospheric Research 
senior scientist Kevin Trenberth said in an email. “This is indeed why the 
polar bear is a poster child for human-induced climate change, but the effects 
are not just in the Arctic.”

One recent theory divides climate scientists: Melting sea ice in the Arctic 
may change the jet stream and weather further south, especially in winter.

“What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic,” Pennsylvania State 
University climate scientist Michael Mann said. “It looks increasingly likely 
that the dramatic decrease in Arctic sea ice is impacting weather in 
mid-latitudes and may be at least partly responsible for the more dramatic, 
persistent and damaging weather anomalies we’ve seen so many of in recent 
years.”
