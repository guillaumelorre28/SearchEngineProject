Re your readers’ stories of the NHS (‘He stayed on that trolley in A&E for the 
next 12 hours’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/14/nhs-crisis-my-frail-mum-was-forced-to-wait-on-the-floor-for-eight-hours>
, 14 January), the government is putting out a spew of misinformation to cover 
the 2% reduction, as a percentage of GDP, it has imposed on funding of the NHS 
since 2010. The people on trolleys waiting for a bed are not the worried well 
who are accused of blocking up A&E departments. They are people who have 
already been assessed as needing beds. These beds are full not just because 
people cannot be moved out of hospital but because the number of hospital beds 
has been steadily reduced over the last 20 or more years, so that the UK now 
has 2.8 beds per 1,000 of population, compared with 8.6 in Germany and 6.2 in 
France. The forthcoming sustainability and transformation plans propose further 
cuts.

The government prefers to blame “bed blocking” because people are remaining in 
hospital “unnecessarily”. But people who are fit for medical discharge are 
waiting for social care packages and there has been a £4.6bn cut in social care 
funding since 2010. What is happening is an inevitable result of the deliberate 
and cavalier reductions in local government funding since 2010. The motion in 
parliament last Thursday, calling for extra funding for social care now and a 
new funding settlement for health and social care in the March budget, was 
rejected. Conservative MPs who have deplored the situation in their local press 
voted with the government. How do these MPs justify their refusal to vote to 
fund social care properly?

Care costs money. Whenever we in Save Our Hospital Services ask if people will 
pay more income tax to ensure theNHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> 
is properly funded, there is an overwhelming “yes” in response. There is also 
huge anger among the public at what is being done to health and social care. 
The government will reap what it sows.

• The illogicality of the prime minister’s response is breathtaking (Stay open 
seven days a week, May tells GPs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/13/theresa-may-nhs-crisis-doctor-surgeries>
, 14 January). Anyone who has been responsible for helping someone in their 80s 
or 90s get to the doctor will know that what is needed is a decent choice of 
appointments between about 10am and 5pm. Spreading appointments over extended 
hours will make these much harder to get, so leading to increasing numbers 
presenting at A&E.

It is blindingly obvious that taking the same number of doctors’ appointments 
and spreading them more thinly is no solution. Appointments at 7.45pm on 
Saturday or 8am on Sunday may suit those in work but they are not, by and 
large, the people arriving at A&E departments.

• The GPs <https://www.theguardian.com/society/gps> have quite rightly pointed 
out that seven-day appointments will not work. However, it may be time for some 
patients to make more of an effort. To avoid an appointment interfering with my 
working day I can join the queue for our practice’s open access 8am surgery 
Monday to Friday. If I get there for 7.40am, I can be back on the street by 
8.15am and get on with the rest of the day. If patients reckon that GP 
appointments clash with going to work, then going sick or booking half a day’s 
holiday may be appropriate options. If your healthcare matters to you, you have 
no need to slide into consumer mode.

• Is the Jeremy Hunt who stated that “We need to have an honest discussion 
about the purpose of A&E departments” (Hunt ditches target as A&E crisis deepens
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/09/labour-party-jeremy-hunt-nhs-waiting-time>
, 10 January) the same Jeremy Hunt whotook his own child to A&E with a minor 
illness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/26/jeremy-hunt-jousts-with-labour-shadow-over-childrens-ae-visit>
 because he didn’t want to wait for a GP appointment?

• I am pleased that Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt are challenging the entitled 
approach of the medical profession.Our GPs earn double what their French 
counterparts do 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/healthcare-network/2011/jun/22/does-nhs-pay-staff-too-much>
. If the BMA had not ruthlessly exploited the public esteem for doctors to 
access salaries and pensions beyond the dreams of other citizens, there could 
be many more GPs with the same personnel budget. The NHS cannot just consume 
our entire public expenditure – we do need to do other things with these 
resources.

Medical professionals need to understand that in the 21st century they are not 
the only people with education and skills, and that they must adjust their 
expectations to allow the NHS to live within its means. The public need to take 
the stars from their eyes and look hard at value for money in NHS spending. 
Aneurin Bevan said he had to stuff the mouths of doctors with gold to form the 
NHS – this is still true today. At last we have a government prepared to argue 
for realism and fairness, to allow our national spending priorities to come 
more into balance.

• Amid all the debate about the current crises in NHS A&E departments, the 
role of employer policies has attracted little attention. The growth of 
zero-hours contracts and the so-called gig economy means many workers have 
uncertain working hours. In such circumstances, committing to GP appointments 
is potentially problematic. Walk-in A&E departments offer an obvious way of 
avoiding this difficulty.

Meanwhile, a significant proportion of the workforce faces the prospect of 
losing pay when absent for medical reasons as a consequence of the poor nature 
and coverage of occupational sick pay schemes. Once again, the 24-hour nature 
of A&E offers a means of avoiding this problem.

• Tucked away in the bottom right-hand corner of page 4 (Rates pain for 
hospitals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/11/nhs-hospitals-in-england-face-322m-tax-bill-increase-from-april>
, 12 January) is news that astonishes me. I had no idea that the NHS has to pay 
business rates. The estimated annual sum is £377m. More disturbing, however, is 
the news that private providers such as Nuffield Health enjoy an 80% rebate 
because they are registered as charities. Private providers enjoy a rebate as 
charities, while the NHS is classed as a business. Verily, “For he that hath, 
to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that 
which he hath” (Mark 4:25

• I volunteer at a nursery school. This term the theme is “people who help 
us”, and in a corner a hospital has been created, complete with pictures of 
bones, a reception desk, waiting area and bed. The children have tiny uniforms 
and medical equipment. The staff and I decided that for complete authenticity 
we need a “waiting time approximately 5 hours” sign, and make all the children 
wait outside in the corridor.
