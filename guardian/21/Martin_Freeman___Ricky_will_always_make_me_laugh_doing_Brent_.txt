Hampshire-born actor Martin Freeman, 45, found fame as long-suffering sales rep
Tim inThe Office <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZMqOMtl5C0>. He went on to 
play hero Bilbo Baggins inThe Hobbit trilogy, with other film credits including 
Love Actually and The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. He was Emmy-nominated 
for theFargo TV series <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrH19wvng4w> and won a 
Bafta for his role as Dr John Watson inSherlock, the BBC’s contemporary reboot 
of Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes detective stories, alongside Benedict 
Cumberbatch’s high-functioning sleuth. Freeman has two children with actor 
Amanda Abbington, who plays Watson’s wife, Mary, inSherlock.

It’s exactly a year since the last episode of Sherlock. Where are the 
characters as we rejoin them?
Well, John and Mary have a baby. A little daughter called Rosamund. That’s the 
big change in their lives but you can’t change the dynamic of the show too 
much, so Watson is soon back on the mystery trail withSherlock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sherlock>. The fabric of the series, 
after all, is the adventures of two weird blokes in London.

Co-creator Steven Moffat says Sherlock is “less of a dick” this series. Is he?
Yeah, hanging out with his best mate for a few years has had a slightly 
softening, humanising effect on Sherlock. If he hadn’t picked up on some social 
clues from John Watson, he’d be an idiot, not a genius. Although, of course, 
his abrasive side does still come out. You wouldn’t want an episode of Sherlock 
where he didn’t say something cutting and emotionally clueless.

The last series climaxed with arch villain Moriarty seemingly taunting 
Sherlock from beyond the grave. Is he back?
Moriarty is dead but it’s safe to say he may still play a part in our futures.

There have been rumours of a shock twist where…
Why even finish that sentence? I already have a red laser dot on my forehead 
as you’re asking. The BBC equivalent of Moriarty is about to snuff me out. 
Honestly, it will be a delight for you to wait and see.

Watson is always stylishly dressed. Do you have input there?
I have strong opinions but Sarah Arthur, the costume designer, is brilliant. 
We’re of accord and we’ve sorted out John’s aesthetic. It’s traditional English 
style that’s a bit medical, a bit military – a nod to his professions – but 
he’s also got to be ready for action.

There’s always a dapper little detail – a bit of corduroy or tweed…
Absolutely. There’s no reason why Watson shouldn’t care about what he wears. 
There is a bit of overlap with my own clothes but in my defence, I don’t just 
pick things that I fancy nicking at the end of the series.

What’s going on with Watson’s hair this series? It looks longer, possibly 
greyer…
He’s just got different hair. Over the course of seven years, people do change 
their hairstyle. It’s a bit of a new birth for him too. He’s a dad now and it 
signifies change.

So it’s dad hair?
I don’t know what sort of dads you’re knocking about with, who look that good.

Watson spends much of his time wearing a papoose…
Indeed, as dads do nowadays. It’s been a good few years since I’ve worn one 
[Freeman’s own children are 10 and eight] and you forget what it’s like. It was 
all a trip down memory lane: the dash to the hospital, the sleepless nights, 
the fear and panic of becoming a parent. Not to mention inadvertently leaving 
the house with sick on my shoulder.

WC Fields’s adage was, “Never work with animals or children”. How come there 
are both in the opening episode?
As we were filming, we were asking Mark [Gatiss, co-creator and writer of the 
opening episode] what the hell he was thinking. It’s page one of the showbiz 
manual but he put both in. To be fair, the bloodhound was much more badly 
behaved than the babies.

Watson’s wife, Mary, is played by your partner, Amanda Abbington. Does that 
make scenes easier or harder?
Erm, well, Amanda and I aren’t together in real life any more. I don’t know if 
you knew that.

No. I’m sorry.
It’s all right, it’s fine. It’s been most of the year, actually. So we did 
this series not being together, which was kind of odd, although we were doing 
it as friends and we’re still very close. It’s always interesting doing stuff 
with your partner because you know each other better than anybody else and that 
was obviously still the case with this series. But it wasn’t lost on me and 
Amanda that, “Oh look, we’re holding our fictional baby. Remember this?”

Statues of Margaret Thatcher get smashed in episode one. Are you prepared for 
accusations of BBC lefty luvvieness?
Weirdly enough, it never occurred to me that smashing busts of Thatcher might 
be considered a little dig. Maybe we should have smashed a bust of Tony Blair 
just to even it up.

Toby Jones guest stars in this series and looks like he’s going to be great…
That’s where you’re wrong, he’s awful. No, Toby plays a great character and 
does a grand job. He’s a very unctuous, oily, truly horrific villain who the 
audience will enjoy despising.

Would you say this is the darkest series yet?
I would. There have always been grisly deaths and emotional turmoil in Sherlock
. But pound for pound, yes, there’s a little bit more dark grey, if not black.

Sherlock is a global hit with a devoted fanbase. What’s that like?
You could live three lifetimes and not hope to repeat this sort of success, so 
you can’t be churlish about it. You have to take it as a huge compliment.

Walliams played me like he plays a lot of people – as a camp idiot. Or maybe 
that’s what I am
Martin Freeman 
What sort of gifts do fans send you?
Things they’ve clearly put a lot of thought and effort into. We get sent a lot 
of dolls. Knitted figures with, frankly, very good crochet work. A lot of 
intricate craft pieces, artwork, paintings. People really take time, which is 
lovely.

Were you ever a fan of anything to that degree?
No, I never crocheted anyone. If only I had the skills. I did write to the 
Style Council when they broke up, saying thanks and I really appreciate what 
you’ve done, but I don’t think I ever posted the letter.

When will we get more Sherlock?
In all honesty, without being cagey, I have no idea. We take our time between 
series for various reasons, quality control not the least of them. So when the 
time’s right, we’ll do it.

I’ve seen it. There’s a shark in it.
(Laughs) Which is always good. Let’s just hope we haven’t jumped it.

Did you see David Walliams and Jack Whitehall’s Sherlock spoof on sketch show 
Walliams & Friend <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbDLWO9Jrow>?
Yes, it was quite funny. I applaud Jack, he gave it a good go. At least he’s a 
similar physical type to Benedict: tall, good-looking and mysterious. But David 
just played me like he plays a lot of people – as a camp idiot. Or maybe that’s 
what I am and don’t realise. But I love David and Jack, they can carry on as 
far as I’m concerned.

Did you also see the David Brent film, Life on the Road 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ9XX4XqWtw>, this summer?
I did and really liked it. Ricky [Gervais] was careful not to make it a sequel 
toThe Office, so the idea of me returning as Tim was never floated at all. 
Purely as a viewer, I love the Brent character and Ricky’s amazing at it. He 
will always make me laugh doing Brent.

Do you know Love Actually was recently voted the nation’s favourite Christmas 
film?
I did not. That’s nice. I like that film. The writing is absolutely beautiful. 
Some of Richard Curtis’s best, I think.

You’re all over our TVs at Christmas, aren’t you? Love Actually, The Office 
Christmas Special, Stick Man <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06t09rk>…
And Nativity [2009 film comedy], that’s a good one.

You’re Mr Christmas. A modern-day Bing Crosby or Val Doonican. The new Noel 
Edmonds.
Please God. You’re an inflammatory fucker. 

Finally, any New Year resolutions?
I say this every year: to try and be a slightly better person than I was the 
year before. One day, I’ll get there.

Sherlock starts tonight, 8.30pm on BBC 1
