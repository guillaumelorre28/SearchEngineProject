Parramatta chief executive Burnie Gurr released a statement on Wednesday 
night, confirming Radradra was headed to France.

“As advised previously to Semi and his manager, Semi will fulfil his 2017 
playing contract with theParramatta Eels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/parramatta-eels> as the club will not 
release Semi from his 2017 obligations to our club; accordingly, the earliest 
Semi could commence at Toulon is early November 2017,” Gurr said.

“In early December 2016 the Parramatta Eels indicated our wish to keep Semi at 
our club by making a very attractive offer to Semi for the 2017 (upgrade of 
existing contract), 2018 and 2019 NRL seasons.

“The offer from Toulon was substantially higher than our club’s offer.”

Radradra is due to face court on 13 February on domestic violence charges 
relating to an incident with his former partner.He has pleaded not guilty to 
the charges
