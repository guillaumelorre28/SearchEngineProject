Firefighters were called to the Royal Hotel in Beenleigh about 8.30pm after 
the man allegedly doused the machines in petrol, destroying three and damaging

hotel, before later arriving with the petrol and allegedly making threats to 
harm himself and others.

He was charged with endangering particular property by fire and appeared in 
the Southport magistrates court. Magistrate Gary Finger remanded the man in 
custody for his own protection.
