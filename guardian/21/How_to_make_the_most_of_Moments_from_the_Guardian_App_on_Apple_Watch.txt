At certain times of the day, Moments will showcase some of our most 
interesting content across a range of topics and formats. Be it the best photos 
of the day, the Tech Weekly podcast, music and film reviews, life and 
relationship advice – there will always be something to entertain and inform 
you just when you need it. If you are in the UK, US or Australia, you will also 
receive more locally relevant content.

Save for later

Force Touch <https://www.apple.com/watch/technology/#sensitive> (or press it a 
little harder than usual) on any piece of content to bring up the ‘save for 
later’ option to read later on the main app. Remember, you need to be signed in 
to the Guardian app on your iPhone for this, but if you’re not then the item 
will be waiting for you in the app’s ‘saved for later’ zone when you sign in 
later. And just so you don’t forget about all the items you saved through the 
day, Moments will give you a gentle reminder in the evening by showing some of 
them.

Lots more to explore

There’s a lot to explore in Moments. Each content type has a distinct look and 
feel to help you easily identify a news article from comment or a podcast from 
a gallery. The app will prefetch content periodically so it always has 
something ready for you, even when you are offline. For the best experience we 
recommend signing in to your Guardian app. And the more you use Moments, the 
more it will learn what to show you in future.

As always, we greatly appreciate your feedback which you can email us at
