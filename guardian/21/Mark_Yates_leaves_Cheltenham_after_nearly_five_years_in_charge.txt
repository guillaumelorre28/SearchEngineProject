Exeter have stayed at the helm longer.

A brief statement on the club’s website read: “Cheltenham Town have parted 
company with manager Mark Yates, with immediate effect. A popular figure and 
promotion-winning captain during his playing days, Yates returned to take 
charge at Whaddon Road on 22 December 2009 after leaving Kidderminster 
Harriers. He has since overseen more than 250 matches, twice guiding the club 
into the League Two play-offs [2011-12 and 2012-13].”

Yates was the Robins’ seventh permanent manager since the club won promotion 
to the Football League for the first time in 1999. Cheltenham slipped to a 
fourth-straight defeat at the weekend, 4-1 at home to Wycombe, and have 
conceded 14 goals in the process.
