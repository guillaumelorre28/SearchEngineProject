Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> appears to have 
not a clue how to lead a superpower.

the country’s media weighed in on the president-elect’slatest social media 
assaults on Beijing

“Trump is not behaving as a president who will become master of the White 
House in a month,” the Communist party controlled newspaper wrotein an editorial
 <http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1024366.shtml>. “He bears no sense of how 
to lead a superpower.”

The article came after the US president-elect again used Twitter, which has 
beenblocked in China since 2009 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jun/02/twitter-china>, to berate 
the leaders of the world’s second largest economy.

“China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters – rips 
it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented [sic] act,”Trump tweeted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/17/donald-trump-china-unpresidented-act-us-navy-drone>
 early on Saturday morning after it emerged the Chinese navy had seized a US 
naval drone that had been operating in the South China Sea.

In a second tweet, Trump wrote: 
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
We should tell China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> that we don't 
want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!

 from Trump’s recent decision to holda 10-minute phone call with the Taiwanese 
president, Tsai Ing-wen

On Friday, President Obama cautioned Trump against allowing relations with 
China slip into“full conflict mode” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/17/dont-let-china-ties-slide-into-full-conflict-mode-obama-urges-trump>
.

In its editorial, the fervently nationalist Global Times, a state-run tabloid 
that sometimes reflects official thinking, indicated such a deterioration was 
certainly on the cards if Trump continued to act up.

People in China were unsure whether the billionaire’s attacks on Beijing were 
part of attempts to wage a psychological war or simply an example of his 
amateurishness.

“But if he treats China after assuming office in the same way as in his 
tweets, China will not exercise restraint,” the newspaper warned. “The Chinese 
government should be fully prepared for a hardline Trump.”

In an online video

that has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times,the newspaper’s 
controversial editor, Hu Xijin, 
<http://qz.com/741931/qza-with-hu-xijin-editor-in-chief-of-global-times/> said: 
“I don’t know if he is playing the psychological card with China or is in fact 
just unprofessional … China should teach him some lessons so he might learn to 
respect China after he is sworn in.”

A comment piece 
<http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrbhwb/html/2016-12/19/content_1736844.htm> on the 
front page of the overseas edition of the Communist party’s official 
mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, also suggested Beijing would not be cowed by 
Trump’s provocations.

“It is difficult to understand his true psychology,” wrote Hua Yiwen, whom the 
paper described as an international affairs expert. “But China shouldn’t spend 
much effort trying to guess what he is thinking. We should simply stand firm, 
take control of the situation and handle it calmly.”

Bill Bishop, a Washington DC-based China expert, said he sensed “abject 
despair” in the US capital at how Trump was conducting US-China relations 
throughmisspelled tweets 
<http://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/12/18/merriam-webster-dictionary-mocks-donald-trump-for-misspelling-in-tweet/>
.

“This is unpresidented behaviour by a precedent-elect,” joked Bishop. “It 
would be funny if the stakes weren’t so high.”

“This is not a business deal. This is a political relationship between nuclear 
powers who are already on the path towards conflict in several dimensions,” 
added Bishop, who publishesthe influential Sinocism newsletter. 
<https://sinocism.com/>

“This kind of uncertainty, this kind of petulance, this kind of random 
tweeting … is not a grand strategy that is going to push the Chinese on to 
their heels so they are going to make concessions. This is juvenile, immature, 
inexperienced behaviour that has the potential to lead to many problems in the 
US-China relationship, some of which could have some pretty serious and 
damaging ramifications.”

Bishop questioned the Chinese media’s suggestion that Trump’s tweets were part 
of a wily psychological ploy to force trade concessions from Beijing. “I 
wouldn’t ascribe brilliant psychological warfare skills to Donald Trump,” he 
said.

Was it possible Trump’s tweets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/18/senior-adviser-on-trumps-diplomacy-i-cant-keep-up-with-the-tweets>
 were part of an ingenious new master plan for Sino-US relations that would 
emerge after his inauguration on 20 January? Bishop was skeptical.

“I think that is about as likely as Xi Jinping waking up on 1 December, 2017 
and declaring China a democracy.”
