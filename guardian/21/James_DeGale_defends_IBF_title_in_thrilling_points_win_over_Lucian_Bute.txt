James DeGale <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> came through his 
first examination as IBF super-middleweight champion with a thrilling, 
unanimous points victory over Canada’s Lucian Bute in Quebec City. The 
29-year-old won the title by beating Andre Dirrell on points in May and put the 
belt on the line against Bute, who had been stopped by Carl Froch in 2012.

The bout at the Centre Videotron got off to a blistering start and the pace 
barely relented as both fighters enjoyed success with quick combinations.

The home crowd were getting right behind the Romanian-born Bute, who left 
DeGale with a cut above his left eye after an accidental head clash. DeGale was 
forced back by his opponent as the fight wore on but his superior footwork and 
speed were enough to convince the judges to score the fight 116-112, 117-111, 
117-111 in the Briton’s favour.

“I said Lucian Bute is a world-class fighter,” said DeGale in the ring, 
moments after his win was announced. “But I’m young, fresh and peaking now. I’m 
ready for the best in the world. All credit to Lucian Bute. He’s a great 
champion and, believe me, he will be back.”

Asked about a potential unification fight against the WBC title holder, Badou 
Jack, he said: “Let’s do it in Vegas next April.”

Bute has now lost three of his last five fights but the 35-year-old former 
champion offered enough to suggest he can still perform at the highest level. 
“It was a great fight and I did my best tonight,” he said. “I think it was a 
close fight. He’s the Olympic champion and world champion and if the judges 
give him the decision I respect that.
