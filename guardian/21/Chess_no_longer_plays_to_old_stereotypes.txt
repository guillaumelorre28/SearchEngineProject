As a keen amateur chess player, I was very happy to see an editorial about one 
of my favourite games (Hurrah! Chess is no longer a game between superpowers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/29/the-guardian-view-on-world-chess-rivalries-no-return-to-the-cold-war>
, 30 November). However, you risk perpetuating the image of the chess player as 
male, eccentric and socially awkward, in saying that “Carlsen … is personable, 
good looking (at least compared to the average chess player)”.

I played last month with my amateur team, Luxembourg Bonnevoie, at the European
Chess <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chess> Club Championships in Novi Sad 
(the annual “Champions League” of chess). Most players at this event, both 
amateurs and professionals, took care over their appearance. As well as the 
open section, a separate event for women’s teams was held. There the 
participants were largely young, elegant and very fashion-conscious. What I am 
trying to say is that chess players nowadays try to look and behave, at least 
outwardly, like normal people.

Gone are the days of impoverished participants, often from eastern Europe, 
turning up in tatty jeans and wearing the same shirt for the duration of the 
event.
