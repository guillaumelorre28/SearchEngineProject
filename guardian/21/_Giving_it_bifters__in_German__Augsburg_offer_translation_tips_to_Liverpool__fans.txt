Liverpool’s Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> last-32 opponents 
Augsburg have offered visiting fans a “scouse/German” translation guide to help 
their trip go smoothly.

As the clubs prepare to meet in the first leg of their tie on Thursday, 
Augsburg tweeted “a little something to help our @LFC friends out & about in
Augsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/augsburg>, and perhaps even 
#Klopp back at home.”

Among the translations on offer 
<https://twitter.com/FCA_World/status/699909031654248448> are: “Mi head’s 
chocka / Ich kann nicht klar denken” and “Givin it bifters / Dein Bestes geben”.

Jürgen Klopp, who was given one-on-one lessons in some key local phrases 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZShEy8ILvg> by a young Liverpool fan last 
year, is without Adam Lallana and the 22-year-old Kevin Stewart for the trip, 
though Lucas Leiva is fit.

“Kevin blocked a shot and his ankle was not stable,” he said. “It was a bit 
bruised so we have sent him for a scan; we think it’s the ligament. He trained 
outstandingly and then this happened. That’s not too good, but Lucas is back.”
