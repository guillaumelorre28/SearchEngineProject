“After working hard for so many years and having the honor to represent my 
country at twoOlympic Games <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games>, 
I am thrilled to take the next big step in my career, fighting professionally 
and leading the rise of women’s boxing worldwide,” Shields said in a statement 
issued Tuesday.

Shields has yet to sign with a promoter and will be making her debut as a free 
agent, a representative for the fighter confirmed to the Guardian.

“It’s a one-fight deal,” Shields’ co-manager Mark Taffet said. “There’s no 
long-term commitment. We made a deal with Roc Nation and Main Events to be a 
part of the biggest fight of the year.”

The middleweight, who captured her first gold medal as a 17-year-old at London 
2012, lived up to her world No1 ranking in the 75kg division with a 
unanimous-decision win over second-seeded Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands on 
the final day of the Rio Olympics.

The rematch of the middleweight final at May’s world championships in Astana 
sealed a fourth consecutive global title for the Michigan native.

Shields’ lone career defeat came at the 2012 world championships against Great 
Britain’s Savannah Marshall, who went on to win the title. From that point, 
Shields closed her amateur career with 51 straight victories over four years 
including back-to-back titles at the Olympics, worlds and Pan American Games.
