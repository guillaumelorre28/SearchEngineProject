The West Ham co-owner David Gold has claimed that the club will sue Brescia 
for money they say they are owed from the sale of the striker Alessandro 
Diamanti from Brescia toBologna <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bologna>.

The Italy international Diamanti, who scored the winning penalty in Sunday 
night's shootout victory over England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/24/euro-2012-england-italy-quarter-final>
, signed for the Hammers in August 2009 from Livorno for a fee reported to be 
around £6m. However, he was allowed to move back to Italy after just one season 
in the Premier League.

It is, though, the player's subsequent transfer to Bologna in a co-ownership 
deal following Brescia's relegation to Serie B that has left the Gold incensed. 
In July 2011, West Ham asked for Diamanti's registration by the Italian 
Football Federation to be suspended as they had not yet been paid the latest 
instalment of the £2m transfer fee.

"We sold Diamanti to Brescia because he was desperate to return to Italy He 
was then sold to Bologna. We are suingBrescia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brescia> for the money," Gold said on 
Twitter.
