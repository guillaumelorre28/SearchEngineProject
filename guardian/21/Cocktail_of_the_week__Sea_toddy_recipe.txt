A rival to the classic toddy: the cloves and lemon bring spice and aroma, the 
seaweed adds salt. Raise a glass to apple growers. Serves one.

50ml water
2 cloves
1 strip lemon peel
1 thumb-sized piece dried kombu (or 1 pinch dried sea spaghetti seaweed) 
2 tsp honey
60ml cider brandy (I use Three-Year Old Somerset Cider Brandy 
<http://www.ciderbrandy.co.uk/shop.html>)
2 tsp lemon juice

Gently heat water, cloves, peel and seaweed; before it simmers, take off heat 
and stir in honey. Put brandy in a warmed glass, top with strained infused 
water and add lemon juice.
