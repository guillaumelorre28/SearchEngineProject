Workers preparing for Donald Trump’s inauguration on 20 January have taped 
over the name of the company – Don’s Johns – that has long supplied portable 
restrooms for major outdoor events in the nation’s capital.

Virginia-based Don’s Johns calls itself the Washington area’s top provider of 
portable toilet rentals. But the name apparently strikes too close to home for 
inauguration organizers.

Workers have placed blue tape over the company name on dozens of portable 
restrooms installed near the Capitol for the inauguration.

The company’s name is clearly visible upon close inspection but is blocked for 
a wide-angle view by a TV or still camera.

The inauguration will take place on the west side of the Capitol facing the 
National Mall. Portable toilets set up on the east side, near Senate office 
buildings, do not have taped-over logos.

Don’s Johns says on its website that it has provided portable toilets for many 
large events in Washington, including the 2009 inauguration ceremony for Barack 
Obama. The company’s logos were visible during that event.

The joint congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies and the presidential 
inaugural committee had no immediate comment on Friday.
