Not many footballers make history in the 87th minute of a match they are 
losing 8-0, but Jake Gosling does not play for an ordinary football team. He 
plays for Gibraltar, a side that have lost all eight of theirEuro 2016 
qualifiers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016-qualifiers>, 
conceding 46 goals in the process. Despite that run of defeats, Gosling has not 
lost his sense of humour.

When he scored Gibraltar’s late consolation goal against Poland on Monday 
night, he doubled his international goal tally and became the country’s 
all-time top scorer.

“The goal was a really proud moment for me and something I’ll never forget,” 
said Gosling. The importance of the occasion was not lost on his manager and 
team-mates atBristol Rovers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolrovers>
, who presented their new hero with a commemorative shirt on his return from 
international duty.

The club’s manager, Darrell Clarke, led the congratulations in the dressing 
room, saying: “I’m a little bit disappointed becauseWayne Rooney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wayne-rooney> took all the headlines by 
scoring 50 goals and being England’s all-time record goalscorer, however, we 
have our very own all-time Gibraltar international goalscorer.”

In scenes reminiscent of the reception Rooney was given at Wembley on Tuesday, 
Clarke presented the player with a personalised shirt and demanded that he give 
a speech. A visibly moved Gosling thanked his colleagues, saying it was 
“obviously a very proud moment” and that he was “over the moon”.
