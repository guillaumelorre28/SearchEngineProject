An abiding rule of celebrity Twitter departure is that it’s very rarely 
permanent. It’s usually a little more permanent than Shatner’s swearing-off, 
however. Quoting Lewis Carroll and the story of the Walrus and the Carpenter, 
theStar Trek star announced in March that “after much deliberation” he’d 
decided to retire hisTwitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> 
account. That was in the afternoon, UK time. Fans of the actor protested. (“We 
need you here to light our lives,” wrote one.) Then shortly after midnight: 
“Boy did I make a mistake.” Bill was back. Total time away: 10 hours.

“Sorry I will never be on Twitter again,” wrote the former boy-band singer in 
October 2012. “I think this sight is actually wrong.” Well, something there was 
wrong. But wonky spelling aside, Ryan had been pushed to breaking point. Going 
by his tweets at the time, Ryan got wobbly on a bottle of pinot, heard a rumour 
that his ex-girlfriend was about to sell him out to the tabloids, vented online 
and took flak from Twitter followers in return. “No I’ve had enough of it!!!! 
I’m only a person!!!!... Fuck all of u wankers on here!!! This sight should be 
banned!!!”

Aggers! Twitter lost the popular cricket commentator only last month, after a 
mucky tweet-based argument broke out when Agnew criticised Kevin Pietersen, and 
the cricketer’s wife, Jessica Taylor, took Agnew to task online. People piled 
in from the sidelines. At one point, Agnew told Taylor to “lose the attitude”. 
Then he signed off for good. “This is not what Twitter was when I joined,” 
wrote Agnew. “I will now leave it to the bullies and trolls. Shame.” The 
commentator had quit Twitter once before, in 2012, after squabbling online with 
one of the writers fromThe Thick of It, and it was a shame then too.

Now this was an impressively worded exit. Minaj, in spring 2012: “Deleting my 
Twitter... Don’t cry for me Argentina. Like seriously, only so much a person 
can take. Good fucking bye!” The US singer was initially thought to be upset 
about the leaking of tracks from her second albumPink Friday: Roman Reloaded. 
Minaj later explained that the reasons were more mystical and that “a voice in 
my head” told her to do it. In another interview she clarified: “I just needed 
a moment to myself.” The hiatus lasted about nine days. “I’m here 2 stay,” she 
wrote and so far that’s proved true.

A funeral, James Gandolfini’s, prompted Baldwin’s withdrawal from Twitter last 
summer. Baldwin later explained in an interview withVanity Fair: “I went to 
Jimmy Gandolfini’s funeral, and when I was there I realised [he] didn’t have 
Twitter… Gandolfini was so admired as a person, and as an actor, and he didn’t 
give a fuck about social media.” So, he says, he quit, calling Twitter “a waste 
of time”. There was also the matter of a Twitter-based argument with theDaily 
Mail over said funeral – Baldwin furious the paper reported his wife had been 
tweeting during the service, and threatened to beat up the relevant journalist.

My favourite. The thoughtful Pennsylvanian musician (a one-man recording 
industry responsible for eight albums as Nine Inch Nails as well as several 
acclaimed film soundtracks, winning an Oscar forThe Social Network) was just a 
bit too thoughtful for life on Twitter. He left, in 2009, with a damning 
farewell: “The experiment seems to have yielded a result. Idiots rule.” Was the 
impact of this social-media indictment undermined by Reznor’s return to the 
service a week later? Maybe. “I’ll tweet if I feel like it,” he wrote, when 
followers hassled him about it. Reznor remains active to this day.

Which of Miley’s de-Twitters to choose? The first, from October 2009, was one 
for connoisseurs, an inventive departure-by-rap in which the then-teenager 
explained her reasons for removing herself from social media. “Yeah the rumours 
are true/ I deleted my Twitter,” she rapped in a short video. “Everything that 
I type/ and everything that I do/ All those lame gossip sites take it and they 
make it news/ I want my private life private.” You probably recall Miley had a 
pretty busy few years after that, the private life not always private, and that 
somewhere along the line she took up tweeting again.

The beloved Sky Sports presenter only had to go and do the decent thing and 
fall on his sword, last month, after getting involved in a Twitter-based 
ding-dong with the parent of a boy his son played football against. An argument 
broke out after a match. Was Stelling’s boy a “shit” goalkeeper? Was it fair to 
criticise a 14-year-old online? The tweets quickly got angry after which 
Stelling, contrite, thought it best to abandon the service. “Thanks for your 
support over last couple of years,” he wrote to followers. “Am closing account 
as I don’t trust myself to respond to some people in the correct way.”

Brown didn’t know who to blame, in 2009, when he couldn’t find a copy of his 
new albumGraffiti on the shelves of a Walmart supermarket in Connecticut. 
Assuming he’d been boycotted by the retailer due to his appalling public 
profile, he lashed out on Twitter. “I’m tired of this shit. Major stores [are] 
blackballing my CD.” When Walmart responded that it was stocking the record, 
and had simply sold out, there can’t have seemed much else for it. Brown 
deleted his Twitter account. (He came back, of course, and has since quit on at 
least one more occasion, after a row with a standup comedian about how old he 
looked.)

Last year, the Canadian DJ decided to “personally unplug myself from the very 
thing that’s making me upset”: Twitter. In an online statement about his 
departure,Deadmau5 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/deadmau5>, real name Joel 
Zimmerman, directed an oblique attack at “Lady Gaga’s infinite legion of 
braindead fans” who he’d previously clashed with on Twitter, but insisted he 
was leaving for “reasons of my own”. The DJ went on: “Time to start [...] 
living in the studio making music without having to be force-fed stupid shit 
that annoys me when all I’m trying to do is connect with fans.” The account 
lingered on under the control of his management for a few months before being 
abandoned.
