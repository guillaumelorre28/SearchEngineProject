to sign Valencia’s Shkodran Mustafi, with the purchase of the Germany defender 
and Deportivo la Coruña striker Lucas Pérez set to take the north London club’s 
spending in the summer transfer window close to the £100m mark.

Arsène Wenger <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsene-wenger> has been 
under pressure to strengthen his defensive options after long-term injuries to 
Per Mertesacker and Gabriel, with Mustafi identified as the Frenchman’s No1 
target weeks ago.

Having initially bid around £20m for the 24-year-old, who was on Everton’s 
books as a teenager before moving to Sampdoria in 2012,Valencia were insistent

 that he was not for sale. However, negotiations have continued since then and 
an agreement was finally reached on Thursday, with Mustafi set for a medical 
before the weekend having agreed personal terms with the club.

The news will come as a huge relief for Arsenal supporters after a poor start 
to the season that has seen them pick up just a solitary point from their 
opening two Premier League fixtures.

 in north London by Lucas, who scored 17 goals last season and opened his 
account for this season with the winner against Elbar last Friday. The 
27-year-old, who was also wanted by Everton, has a buyout clause of around £17m 
and is also expected to travel to London on Friday to complete his move.

Arsenal have already spent £35m on Switzerland midfielder Granit Xhaka and 
outlayed around £9m combined on defender Rob Holding, forward Takuma Asano and 
midfielder Kelechi Nwakali.
