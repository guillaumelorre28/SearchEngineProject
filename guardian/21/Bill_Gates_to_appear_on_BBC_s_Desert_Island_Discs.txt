The businessman and philanthropist will give a rare interview to presenter 
Kirsty Young as he chooses eight discs, a book and a luxury to take with them 
if they were stranded on a mythical desert island.

During the interview, Gates will explain his choices, discuss key moments in 
his life, as well as the people and events that have influenced and inspired 
him.

Gates is no longer part of Microsoft’s day-to-day operations, but he is still 
a board member and a “technology adviser”.

Later this year, Gates and the late Steve Jobs are set to be the subject of 
Broadway musical.

The musical, called Nerds 
<http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/14/steve-jobs-bill-gates-nerds-broadway-show/>
, is a comedy that looks at the fierce rivalry between the Microsoft and Apple 
co-founders.

On Thursday, Gates came in for a verbal tirade from rapper Snoop Dogg who 
posted an expletive-laden video on Instagram after an outage on XBox Live 
ruined his gaming session.
