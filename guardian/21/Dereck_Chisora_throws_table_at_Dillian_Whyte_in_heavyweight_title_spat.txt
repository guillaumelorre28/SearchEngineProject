Dereck Chisora picked up and threw a desk  
<https://twitter.com/SheldanKeay/status/806495834548346880>as his pre-fight 
press conference with Dillian Whyte ended in chaos and farce.

Bad blood had already been evident throughout a 20-minute media session at a 
Manchester hotel as both fighters traded insults and swore repeatedly.

Chisora lost his temper and threw the top table off the ground, sparking 
scuffles involving various people, including security staff.

The fighters will meet in the ring in a British heavyweight title fight and 
WBC eliminator on the undercard to the bout between Anthony Joshua and Eric 
Molina in Manchester on Saturday.

The pair had already clashed on the Sky Sports programme The Gloves are Off.

Initially it was announced they would hold separate press conferences but it 
was decided they should be seated at opposite ends of a long table with a 
significant security presence.

Those measures proved inadequate as Chisora, who had been goading Whyte 
throughout but taken plenty of flak himself, banged the desk with his fist and 
then launched it in Whyte’s direction.

Whyte’s trainer Mark Tibbs, who had also joined in the verbal sparring and 
used some crude language, threw an object back in Chisora’s direction. Sky 
reportedthe pair would weigh in separately on Friday
