A trade deal between the EU and Japan that has been discussed since 2013 will 
be completed this year, as early as the autumn, world leaders have claimed at 
theG7 summit in Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7>.

David Cameron attended a side event at the summit, with the leaders of France, 
Italy and Germany as well as the presidents of the European commission and 
council to discuss the agreement, which was initially expected to be tied up 
last year.

The prime minister used the meeting as an opportunity to make the argument for 
Britain remaining in the EU by suggesting the deal – which could be worth £5bn 
for the British economy – was possible because of the scale of the EU.

“As Prime Minister Abe said when visiting the UK, Japan’s priority is 
negotiating with large trade blocs – not individual states in Europe. And this 
is something we hear time and again from foreign leaders,” he said.
“Not only will UK households lose out to the tune of £4,300 a year if we vote 
to leave, but we will be turning our backs on global trade deals which underpin 
our security and prosperity.”

The deal would mean the elimination of the vast majority of trade tariffs, and 
boost imports and exports in key areas such as agriculture, car manufacturing 
and clothing, according to Downing Street.
