Dawn has cost its trainer a $9,000 fine from racing authorities concerned about 
the impact on the sport’s image.

In a case that made global headlines

 after placing second at a Toowoomba race meeting last June.

The Queensland Racing Integrity Commission on Wednesday announced the penalty 
against the trainer, Ben Currie, who had fought the charge of presenting a 
horse with a prohibited substance.

A panel of stewards who met on 28 December decided the penalty needed to serve 
as a deterrent in light of “the nature of the substance and the potential to 
compromise the health and welfare of Party Till Dawn”.

They also took into account “the negative impact to the image of thoroughbred 
racing and the potential to undermine the integrity of the sport”, the QRIC 
said.

Currie had pleaded not guilty after being formally charged by the QRIC last 
month. That followed a second confirmed positive test of the horse for traces 
of the drug in its urine andan interview by stewards of a stablehand employed 
by Currie

.

The QRIC said because Currie may seek an internal review of the stewards’ 
verdict, or challenge it in the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal, 
it was not appropriate to comment further.
