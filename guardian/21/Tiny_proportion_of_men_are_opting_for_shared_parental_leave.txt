Fathers are not taking advantage of rules that allow them to share leave with 
their partners, according to research published a year after the rights came 
into force.

Shared parental leave (SPL) was introduced on 5 April 2015 to give parents 
more choice and flexibility in caring for their children during the first 12 
months after their birth. Parents can split 52 weeks’ leave, receiving some 
payment for 39 of those weeks. That is on top of the two weeks’ statutory 
paternity leave available to fathers.

Research among 200 employers by the firm My Family 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/family> Care found that more than 
four out of 10 had not seen a single male employee take up the right. At 11%, 
only between 0.5% and 1% of male workers had taken shared parental leave and 
fewer than 10% reported more than 1% takeup. A further quarter of firms were 
not able to give a figure.

With statutory pay set at a maximum of £139.58 a week, 80% of employees 
surveyed said a decision to share leave would depend on finances and whether 
their employer paid more than obliged to.

The research found that concerns over career progression were a factor for 
many, with half of men saying they thought taking leave was perceived 
negatively at work and 55% of mothers questioned said they did not want to 
share their leave.

Only 40% of individuals said shared parental leave was encouraged by their 
employer, although almost half of businesses said they offered enhanced pay in 
line with what they offered employees taking maternity leave.

Al Ferguson, founder of website The Dad Network, 
<http://www.thedadnetwork.co.uk/> said the figures showed there was still a 
stigma attached to a father’s role in parenting. “Many working dads still feel 
it’s their duty to go out and earn the money, despite having this option to 
stay at home with their new baby,” he said, adding that he expected the takeup 
to increase, although “there are many hurdles that need to be overcome first – 
SPL is a slow step forward”.

A government assessment suggested 285,000 working fathers would be eligible to 
take the leave, but only 2% to 8% would do so. This compares with about nine in 
10 fathers in Sweden and Norway, where between 80% and 100% of their earnings 
are replaced while they are on leave.

It’s the new era of shared parental leave (if you can afford to take it)

The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said shared parental leave had 
been “a welcome small step towards getting dads more involved with childcare”.

However, she added: “Takeup has been very low and TUC research shows as many 
as two in five new fathers are ineligible for shared parental leave, as their 
partners are not in paid work or they fail to meet the qualifying conditions.

“If the government is serious about men playing a more active role after their 
child is born, they must increase statutory pay and give all new dads a right 
to some independent parental leave that is not shared with their partners.”

The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: “Shared parental 
leave is provided to help mothers who want to return to work early share 
responsibility for the care of her child with the father or partner. There are 
many factors that affect a couple’s decision on how childcare should be managed 
and by whom. Takeup is likely to be higher in organisations that offer pay 
above the statutory minimum. We will evaluate the policy by 2018.”

• The headline on this article was amended on 5 April 2016. An earlier version 
said that 1% of new fathers were opting for shared parental leave. The figure 
relates to all male employees at the companies surveyed.
