Full time at St Mary's: Southampton 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur

It’s all over! Mike Dean draws proceedings to a close after a very lively 
second half that marked another successful return to Southampton for Mauricio 
Pochettino. Spurs ran out easy winners in the end, butSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> were in touch until the 84th 
minute, despite having been reduced to 10 men when Nathan Redmond was sent off 
shortly before the hour mark. Virgil van Dijk opened the scoring for Saints 
very early doors, but a brace from Dele Alli and goals from Harry Kane and 
Heung-Min Son meant Spurs took all three points despite Kane missing a second 
half penalty.

89 min: So, back to those quick-fire goals. Both were spookily similar, with 
Son’s the pick of them. He latched on to a long ball out of defence from 
Eriksen, sped past Oriol Romeu and finished with a precision shot across 
Forster’s bows that went into the bottom corner. Alli’s second was not all that 
different: from a counter-attack Danny Rose picked him out on the edge of the 
middle third and he was given time and space to pass the ball into the same 
corner.

83 min: Cedric plays the ball in behind the Spurs defence for Shane Long to 
chase. He steals a march on his markers and attempts to chest the ball down in 
space, but is correctly flagged for offside after mistiming his run.

79 min: More slapstick from Lloris, who rushes out of his area to head a 
clearance straight to Hoejbjerg. The substitute attempts to lob the keeper, but 
fails abjectly in his attempt to do so. Moments previously, Fonte had been 
lucky to avoid a booking (at least) for a wild lunge on Danny Rose, which the 
full-back managed to evade.

78 min: A woeful clearance from Hugo Lloris goes straight to Dusan Tadic in 
space not too far outside the Spurs penalty area. He’s caught unawares and 
dispossessed before he has time to react.

rescuing something from this game despite being down to 10 men. They’ve 13 
minutes left to do so, along with whatever the referee adds on for stoppages.

71 min: Spurs attack up the right flank, with Rose and Sissoko combining well. 
The ball finds its way to Christian Eriksen, who rattles the cross-bar with a 
surface to air screamer from outside the penalty area.

60 min: Mike Dean took a curiously long time to take his red card out of his 
pocket and show it to Nathan Redmond then. He’d awarded the penalty and Harry 
Kane was waiting to take it when, as an apparent afterthought, he decided to 
send Redmond on his way. The less said about Kane’s penalty the better, but it 
was certainly an entertaining three minute spell.

AND NOW KANE MISSES THE PENALTY!!!

58 min: It’s all go at St Mary’s, where Harry Kane blazes his penalty over the 
bar! He glowers at a loose divot, as if to suggest it’s the pitch rather than 
he who is to blame.

57 min: After what appears an eternity, Dean sends Redmond off with a straight 
red card for being last man back and preventing a clear goalscoring opportunity.

PENALTY FOR SPURS ...

55 min: Great refereeing from Mike Dean, who plays the advantage after Dele 
Alli was put through on goal by Moussa Sissoko, only to be held back by Nathan 
Redmond. After Alli put his shot wide, Dean blew his whistle pointed to the 
spot.

54 min: Spurs won that corner after some dithering in defence from Jose Fonte 
under pressure from Kyle Walker. Christian Eriksen’s delivery was beautiful and 
with Southampton’s defenders fast asleep, Kane rose at the near post to guide 
the ball in the top right-hand corner.

48 min: Almost four minutes in and this second half remains exceedingly 
scrappy, what little play there’s been punctuated by a series of free-kicks and 
throw-ins. Steven Davis goes down under what looked a fairly agricultural 
Victor Wanyama challenge right under the nose of referee Mike Dean, but the 
advantage is played. Dean goes on to have a word with Wanyama, but keeps his 
yellow card in his pocket. The challenge was clumsy rather than malicious and 
Davis didn’t make a big deal out of it.

47 min: A scrappy start to the second half, but Boufal eventually gets his 
foot on the ball out on the left flank before gadding up the left touchline and 
winning a throw-in. Nothing comes of it.

Half-time at St Mary's: Southampton 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur

The players troop off for their half-time brew with the scores level. 
Tottenham will be happier with their performance, but it’s all to play for in 
the second half. A point isn’t much use to either side, but on the balance of 
play so far, the visitors look the more likely winners.

45 min: The fourth official suggests one minute of added time in an absorbing 
match that’s had few interruptions. Tottenham started badly, but are very much 
in the ascendency as we approach the interval. On the scoreboard, however, the 
scores remain very much level, with Dele Alli having cancelled out Virgil van 
Dijk’s opener.

43 min: A neat touch from Victor Wanyama in the Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> penalty area enables him to 
take out a defender and make room for a shot about seven yards from Forster’s 
goal. As he shapes to pull the trigger, Jose Fonte takes the ball away from him 
with a desperate last-ditch lunge. Brilliant defending. Moussa Sissoko’s 
delivery to Wanyama wasn’t half bad either - the much-maligned French 
international is having one of his better games for Spurs tonight.

39 min: After a very shaky start indeed, Spurs continue to dominate as they 
have done for the past 20 minutes. Most of the play is inside theSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> half, with the home team 
sitting way too deep and getting pressed high up the field. Claude Puel will 
have to do something about this at half-time, if not sooner. Dele Alli is 
presented with another scoring opportunity of sorts but fluffs his long range 
effort.

He plays it short to Dembele, who ends up winning corner No5 off Cedric as he

27 min: This match has been fairly scrappy and pell-mell so far, but no less 
entertaining for that. Both teams appear to be going all out for the win and 
Spurs are just about in the ascendency for now, but there’s been very little 
between the two sides.

24 min: Corrections and clarifications department: Unless Jon Moss got a very 
convincing Mike Dean mask for Christmas, it is the man from Wirral who is 
refereeing this match. I was unreliably informed by the news agencies that Moss 
was running the show tonight.

21 min: It was the turn of Southampton’s defenders to fall asleep there, with 
Alli reacting quickest after Sissoko’s cross was deflected up in the air off 
the back of Redmond. Virgil van Dijk mistimed his own leap as a result, 
enabling the unmarked Alli to send a nicely weighted looping header into the 
top corner from six yards. It was a fine effort, which the youngster did well 
to keep under the bar.

flank and drills the ball into the penalty area in the hope of picking out 
Redmond. Danny Rose is on hand to make the crucial interception and prevent
Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> from doubling

14 min: Mousa Dembele is booked for a foul on Nathan Redmond, or else booked 
for dissent after he was penalised for fouling Redmond. There follows some more 
slapstick defending from Spurs, leading to a low diagonal Redmond drive that 
goes narrowly wide of Lloris’s far post.

13 min: Speaking of wayward - Fraser Forster makes a dog’s breakfast of a 
clearance and his mis-kick sends the ball steepling high into the air and out 
for a Spurs thropw-in deep inside theSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> half. Nothing comes of it, 
although the Saints goalkeeper’s attempt to look like he knew exactly what he 
was doing was quite amusing.

9 min: More good play from Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>, as Boufal wriggles through 
a couple of defenders on his way into the Spurs penalty area from the right 
with the ball on his toe. He’s eventually crowded off it, but there’s an 
element of the desperate and last-ditch about some of this Spurs defending.

4 min: James Ward-Prowse was the provider there, having stood over the ball 
alongside Bertrand, who had won the free-kick from Wanyma. He lofted the ball 
towards the far post, where Van Dijk rose much higher than the two defenders 
nearest him to head past Hugo Lloris.

GOAL! SOUTHAMPTON 1-0 TOTTENHAM (Van Dijk 2)

2 min: What a start for Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>. From the aforementioned 
free-kick, which was conceded by Victor Wanyama, the ball was swung into the 
Spurs penalty area. Unmarked, Virgil Van Dijk rose to power a header across the 
face of goal and inside the far post. Woeful defending by Spurs.

Not long now ...

The teams emerge from their dressing rooms, line up in the tunnel and march 
out on to the pitch for the last of the pre-match formalities. Tottenham’s 
players are a vision in yellow shirts, shorts and socks, while their hosts wear 
their usual attire of red and white striped shirts, black shorts and red socks.

No Toby Alderweireld for Spurs ...

The Belgian central defender misses out because he’s suffering from a virus, 
while Moussa Sissoko comes into the Tottenham midfield for Harry Winks.
Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> manager Claude 
Puel makes four changes from the team that beat Bournemouth, with Jose Fonte, 
James Ward-Prowse, Nathan Redmond and Steven Davis all returning to the 
starting line-up of a side that must play three matches in the next six days.

Season's greetings, sports fans ...

Tottenham travel to St Mary’s knowing that defeat will all but end their 
fairly slim chances of winning the title and leave them in fifth place in the
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>, four 
points behind neighbours Arsenal, who currently occupy the final Champions 
League spot. With nine points viewer than their visitors, Southampton are back 
in eighth and come into tonight’s game on the back of their pre-Christmas win 
over Bournemouth. Saints defensive midfielder Oriol Romeu is available after a 
one-match spell on the naughty step after picking up five yellow cards, but his 
fellow midfielder Jordy Clasie is out with a groin injury. Striker Charlie 
Austin and defender Matt Targett are longer term absentees.

For Tottenham, who are looking to make it three wins on the bounce after 
victories over Burnley and Hull City, defenders Toby Alderweireld and Danny 
Rose, midfielder Mousa Dembele and striker Vincent Janssen are all available 
for selection after returning from injury. Kick-offis at 7.45pm (GMT), but 
we’ll here with team news and build-up long before that.

Tottenham beat 10-man Southampton despite Harry Kane penalty miss
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/28/southampton-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report> 
It’s all over! Mike Dean draws proceedings to a close after a very lively 
second half that marked another successful return to Southampton for Mauricio 
Pochettino. Spurs ran out easy winners in the end, butSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> were in touch until the 84th 
minute, despite having been reduced to 10 men when Nathan Redmond was sent off 
shortly before the hour mark. Virgil van Dijk opened the scoring for Saints 
very early doors, but a brace from Dele Alli and goals from Harry Kane and 
Heung-Min Son meant Spurs took all three points despite Kane missing a second 
half penalty.
 
90 min: Shane Long and Jan Vertonghen pick up yellow cards for something and 
nothing, which means the Tottenham man will join Kyle Walker on the Naughty 
Step for his side’s next game, against Watford.
 
89 min: So, back to those quick-fire goals. Both were spookily similar, with 
Son’s the pick of them. He latched on to a long ball out of defence from 
Eriksen, sped past Oriol Romeu and finished with a precision shot across 
Forster’s bows that went into the bottom corner. Alli’s second was not all that 
different: from a counter-attack Danny Rose picked him out on the edge of the 
middle third and he was given time and space to pass the ball into the same 
corner.
 
89 min: Spurs substitution: Vincent Janssen comes on for Harry Kane. 
 
87 min: Another counter-attack, another finish into the bottom right-hand 
corner, with Dele Alli bagging his second of the night with a low pass into the 
bottom corner.

85 min: Son extends Tottenham’s lead with a fine finish into the bottom 
right-hand corner, finishing a counter-attack in most emphatic style.

83 min: Cedric plays the ball in behind the Spurs defence for Shane Long to 
chase. He steals a march on his markers and attempts to chest the ball down in 
space, but is correctly flagged for offside after mistiming his run.
 
82 min: Tottenham substitution: Mousa Dembele off, Harry 
Winks on. 
 
79 min: More slapstick from Lloris, who rushes out of his area to head a 
clearance straight to Hoejbjerg. The substitute attempts to lob the keeper, but 
fails abjectly in his attempt to do so. Moments previously, Fonte had been 
lucky to avoid a booking (at least) for a wild lunge on Danny Rose, which the 
full-back managed to evade.
 
78 min: A woeful clearance from Hugo Lloris goes straight to Dusan Tadic in 
space not too far outside the Spurs penalty area. He’s caught unawares and 
dispossessed before he has time to react.
 
77 min: Tottenham’s ongoing failure to add a third goal means Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> remain in with a shout of 
rescuing something from this game despite being down to 10 men. They’ve 13 
minutes left to do so, along with whatever the referee adds on for stoppages.
 
75 min: Just before that Spurs substitution, the apparently tireless Rose cut 
in from the flank and sent a rasping shot well wide of the upright.
 Danny Rose fires wide from close range. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters  
74 min: Spurs substitution: Moussa Sissoko off after what has been, by his own 
low standards since moving to Tottenham, a decent performance. He makes way for 
Heung-Min Son.
 
72 min: Southampton triple-substitution: Shane Long, Dusan Tadic and 
Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg on for Jay Rodriguez, Sofiane Doufal and Steven Davis.
 
71 min: Spurs attack up the right flank, with Rose and Sissoko combining well. 
The ball finds its way to Christian Eriksen, who rattles the cross-bar with a 
surface to air screamer from outside the penalty area.
 
69 min: Southampton go on an increasingly rare attack into Tottenham territory 
and Cedric arcs a cross from deep towards the far post. Hugo Lloris is quick 
off his line to catch acrobatically.
 
65 min: Victor Wanyama shoots from distance, stinging the palms of Forster in 
theSouthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> goal and 
winning his team a corner. Nothing comes of it, although Forster is forced off 
his line to clear.
 
64 min: Some housekeeping - before it all kicked off, Kyle Walker received a 
yellow card that will rule him out of Tottenham’s New Year’s Day match against 
Watford under the totting -up procedure. Danny Rose has since been booked, but 
it’sSouthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> who are down 
to 10 men and trail by the odd goal of three.
 
60 min: Mike Dean took a curiously long time to take his red card out of his 
pocket and show it to Nathan Redmond then. He’d awarded the penalty and Harry 
Kane was waiting to take it when, as an apparent afterthought, he decided to 
send Redmond on his way. The less said about Kane’s penalty the better, but it 
was certainly an entertaining three minute spell.
 
58 min: It’s all go at St Mary’s, where Harry Kane blazes his penalty over the 
bar! He glowers at a loose divot, as if to suggest it’s the pitch rather than 
he who is to blame.

57 min: After what appears an eternity, Dean sends Redmond off with a straight 
red card for being last man back and preventing a clear goalscoring opportunity.

off. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters  Redmond appears shocked by Mike Dean’s 
decision. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters  
55 min: Great refereeing from Mike Dean, who plays the advantage after Dele 
Alli was put through on goal by Moussa Sissoko, only to be held back by Nathan 
Redmond. After Alli put his shot wide, Dean blew his whistle pointed to the 
spot.
 
54 min: Spurs won that corner after some dithering in defence from Jose Fonte 
under pressure from Kyle Walker. Christian Eriksen’s delivery was beautiful and 
with Southampton’s defenders fast asleep, Kane rose at the near post to guide 
the ball in the top right-hand corner.
 
52 min: Harry Kane scores with his head at the near post, turning in an 
out-swinger of a corner with a marvellous finish. That was a fine goal.

Finney/Getty Images  
48 min: Almost four minutes in and this second half remains exceedingly 
scrappy, what little play there’s been punctuated by a series of free-kicks and 
throw-ins. Steven Davis goes down under what looked a fairly agricultural 
Victor Wanyama challenge right under the nose of referee Mike Dean, but the 
advantage is played. Dean goes on to have a word with Wanyama, but keeps his 
yellow card in his pocket. The challenge was clumsy rather than malicious and 
Davis didn’t make a big deal out of it.
 
47 min: A scrappy start to the second half, but Boufal eventually gets his 
foot on the ball out on the left flank before gadding up the left touchline and 
winning a throw-in. Nothing comes of it.
 
46 min: Spurs get the second half started, with no changes to either side at 
the interval. They’ve had one shot on target each and both headers have gone in.
 
The players troop off for their half-time brew with the scores level. 
Tottenham will be happier with their performance, but it’s all to play for in 
the second half. A point isn’t much use to either side, but on the balance of 
play so far, the visitors look the more likely winners.
 
45 min: The fourth official suggests one minute of added time in an absorbing 
match that’s had few interruptions. Tottenham started badly, but are very much 
in the ascendency as we approach the interval. On the scoreboard, however, the 
scores remain very much level, with Dele Alli having cancelled out Virgil van 
Dijk’s opener.
 
43 min: A neat touch from Victor Wanyama in the Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> penalty area enables him to 
take out a defender and make room for a shot about seven yards from Forster’s 
goal. As he shapes to pull the trigger, Jose Fonte takes the ball away from him 
with a desperate last-ditch lunge. Brilliant defending. Moussa Sissoko’s 
delivery to Wanyama wasn’t half bad either - the much-maligned French 
international is having one of his better games for Spurs tonight.
 
42 min: Another Spurs corner; their sixth. The delivery is poor and Jay 
Rodriguez clears, but only as far as Alli.
 
39 min: After a very shaky start indeed, Spurs continue to dominate as they 
have done for the past 20 minutes. Most of the play is inside theSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> half, with the home team 
sitting way too deep and getting pressed high up the field. Claude Puel will 
have to do something about this at half-time, if not sooner. Dele Alli is 
presented with another scoring opportunity of sorts but fluffs his long range 
effort.
 
38 min: Tottenham win their fourth corner, which Eriksen takes from the left. 
He plays it short to Dembele, who ends up winning corner No5 off Cedric as he 
tries to beat the full-back and get a cross into theSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> penalty area. Nothing comes 
of it.
 
35 min: The ball’s played wide to Kyle Walker on the right flank, but his 
cross is blocked by Redmond. The ball breaks kindly for the right-back, he 
plays it inside to Sissoko and Spurs continue a patience build-up.

32 min: Southampton win a corner after Jan Vertonghen dives in to intercept a 
pass from Nathan Redmond to Cedric, who was galloping into space down the right 
side of the penalty area. Good defending. Bertrand’s corner is punched clear by 
Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal.
 
30 min: Christian Eriksen wins a corner for Spurs after a scuffed effort from 
just outside the area takes a deflection off a defender. Eriksen takes the 
corner short and is on hand to blast over from 25 yards after a brief passage 
of play in whichSouthampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> 
failed to clear their lines.
 
29 min: Cedric puts the ball behind for a corner after good work from Eric 
Dier. Eriksen curls the ball to the near post, where Steven Davies hacks it out 
for a throw-in.
 
27 min: This match has been fairly scrappy and pell-mell so far, but no less 
entertaining for that. Both teams appear to be going all out for the win and 
Spurs are just about in the ascendency for now, but there’s been very little 
between the two sides.
 
24 min: Corrections and clarifications department: Unless Jon Moss got a very 
convincing Mike Dean mask for Christmas, it is the man from Wirral who is 
refereeing this match. I was unreliably informed by the news agencies that Moss 
was running the show tonight.
 
21 min: It was the turn of Southampton’s defenders to fall asleep there, with 
Alli reacting quickest after Sissoko’s cross was deflected up in the air off 
the back of Redmond. Virgil van Dijk mistimed his own leap as a result, 
enabling the unmarked Alli to send a nicely weighted looping header into the 
top corner from six yards. It was a fine effort, which the youngster did well 
to keep under the bar.
 
19 min: Dele Alli equalises with a header from the edge of the six-yard box, 
after a Moussa Sissoko cross had taken a deflection off the back of Redmond.

17 min: More good play from Southampton, as Bertrand gallops down the left 
flank and drills the ball into the penalty area in the hope of picking out 
Redmond. Danny Rose is on hand to make the crucial interception and prevent
Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> from doubling 
their lead.
 
14 min: Mousa Dembele is booked for a foul on Nathan Redmond, or else booked 
for dissent after he was penalised for fouling Redmond. There follows some more 
slapstick defending from Spurs, leading to a low diagonal Redmond drive that 
goes narrowly wide of Lloris’s far post.
 
13 min: Speaking of wayward - Fraser Forster makes a dog’s breakfast of a 
clearance and his mis-kick sends the ball steepling high into the air and out 
for a Spurs thropw-in deep inside theSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> half. Nothing comes of it, 
although the Saints goalkeeper’s attempt to look like he knew exactly what he 
was doing was quite amusing.
 
11 min: Spurs win a corner and it’s played short to Christian Eriksen. He 
attempts to whip the ball towards the far post, but catches it all wrong and 
his wayward effort drifts wide.

9 min: More good play from Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>, as Boufal wriggles through 
a couple of defenders on his way into the Spurs penalty area from the right 
with the ball on his toe. He’s eventually crowded off it, but there’s an 
element of the desperate and last-ditch about some of this Spurs defending.
 
7 min: Danny Rose attempts to cross into the Southampton penalty area from the 
left touchline, but his effort is blocked by Cedric.Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> go forward again,m with 
Nathan Redmond threading a ball through the inside right for Jay Rodriguez to 
chase. He beats Jan Vertonghen for pace, but sends his diagonal effort well 
wide of the far post.
 
6 min: Southampton are employing a very heavy press from the front, making it 
night on impossible for the visitors to play the ball out from the back without 
making errors.
 
4 min: James Ward-Prowse was the provider there, having stood over the ball 
alongside Bertrand, who had won the free-kick from Wanyma. He lofted the ball 
towards the far post, where Van Dijk rose much higher than the two defenders 
nearest him to head past Hugo Lloris.
 
2 min: What a start for Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>. From the aforementioned 
free-kick, which was conceded by Victor Wanyama, the ball was swung into the 
Spurs penalty area. Unmarked, Virgil Van Dijk rose to power a header across the 
face of goal and inside the far post. Woeful defending by Spurs.

1 min: Southampton get the ball rolling and immediately get the ball rolling. 
Almost immediately, they win a free-kick in line with the left side of the 
Spurs penalty for a foul on Ryan Bertrand.
 
The teams emerge from their dressing rooms, line up in the tunnel and march 
out on to the pitch for the last of the pre-match formalities. Tottenham’s 
players are a vision in yellow shirts, shorts and socks, while their hosts wear 
their usual attire of red and white striped shirts, black shorts and red socks.

while Moussa Sissoko comes into the Tottenham midfield for Harry Winks.
Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> manager Claude 
Puel makes four changes from the team that beat Bournemouth, with Jose Fonte, 
James Ward-Prowse, Nathan Redmond and Steven Davis all returning to the 
starting line-up of a side that must play three matches in the next six days.

Referee: Jon Moss (W Yorkshire) 
 Jon Moss will be in charge of tonight’s match at St Mary’s. At least that’s 
what I read on the news wires, but it turns out that Mike Dean (not pictured)

Tottenham travel to St Mary’s knowing that defeat will all but end their 
fairly slim chances of winning the title and leave them in fifth place in the
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague>, four 
points behind neighbours Arsenal, who currently occupy the final Champions 
League spot. With nine points viewer than their visitors, Southampton are back 
in eighth and come into tonight’s game on the back of their pre-Christmas win 
over Bournemouth. Saints defensive midfielder Oriol Romeu is available after a 
one-match spell on the naughty step after picking up five yellow cards, but his 
fellow midfielder Jordy Clasie is out with a groin injury. Striker Charlie 
Austin and defender Matt Targett are longer term absentees.

For Tottenham, who are looking to make it three wins on the bounce after 
victories over Burnley and Hull City, defenders Toby Alderweireld and Danny 
Rose, midfielder Mousa Dembele and striker Vincent Janssen are all available 
for selection after returning from injury. Kick-offis at 7.45pm (GMT), but 
we’ll here with team news and build-up long before that.
