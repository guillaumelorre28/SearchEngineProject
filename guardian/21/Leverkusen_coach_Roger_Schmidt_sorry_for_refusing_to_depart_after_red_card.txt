The Bayer Leverkusen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayerleverkusen> 
head coach, Roger Schmidt, has accepted that he was wrong to defy the referee 
and refuse orders to go to the stands during Borussia Dortmund’s 1-0 victory at 
the BayArena on Sunday.

Schmidt was angry with a decision by the referee Felix Zwayer during the 
buildup to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 65th-minute goal.

“We went behind through an irregular goal and I told the fourth official as 
much. It was clearly a mistake by me. And I wish that the referee could have 
told me why he was sending me to the stands,” said Schmidt. “Maybe that was a 
bit stubborn of me, so I have hurt my team. I’m sorry. I am a role model and 
I’ve not done myself justice, but sometimes it is easy to react in hectic and 
emotional situations.

“I have the fourth official noting that the kick was executed a thousand per 
cent irregularly. [The referee] also did not give a thousand per cent penalty 
and I’m just challenging for justice for my team.”

Zwayer has been given the full support of the German FA after his decision to 
suspend the match for nine minutes. “[The referee] technically made the correct 
decision after the Dortmund goal,” said Herbert Fandel, the German FA’s head of 
the referees. “If a player or even the coach refuses to leave the field after a 
sending off, the play will be stopped and the threat of a postponement is the 
right decision.”

Schmidt is facing a possible ban.
