Summing up

It really was impossible to pick a winner from that. Two evenly matched, 
tenacious, well-drilled sides slugging it out in a match that gave us a 
thrilling first half, a slightly below par second and a surprisingly open last 
half-hour. Rovers deserve credit for recovering from a dismal start to 
gradually look the more purposeful team – just about – though Grimsby’s 
football might have been a tad more composed. Again, just about.

And amid all that, it took until 120 minutes for anyone to send in a 
John-Lewis gag about the Mariners’ top scorer, and it came from Shaun Thompson 
in Munich: “One thing occurs - this is ideal shop-window for Grimsby’s 
John-Lewis to show his wares. If a club were to come in for him, I for one 
wouldn’t expect him to be knowingly under-sold etc etc.” Given that John Lewis 
shoppers are now deemed the only segment of the electorate that matters  a 
crucial electoral demographic, I thought we might have had a few more than 
that. But you can’t have everything. What we did have was an absorbing football 
match.

Many, many commiserations to Grimsby. But we’ll have to sign off on a 
Rovers-related note, and it comes from Brian Oliver withanother version of 
their celebrated, and wonderful, anthem 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5AuA3loja8>: “Sounds good when slurred,” he 
adds, and there’ll be a fair bit of that going on tonight among the Gasheads’ 
contingent. They’ve had precious little to slur about in recent years after all.

So, as their captain Mark McChrystal hoists the trophy aloft, I’ll sign off. 
Thanks for your company and emails. It’s been epic. Bye.

The Rovers end erupts, as ends tend to do in such circumstances, while the 
Grimsby <https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> players stare 
disconsolately at the floor. They’ve fallen just short again, and it’s a 
horrible feeling for them. Rovers match-winner Mansell tells the ever-intrusive 
Clem how he “felt sorry for the missus” watching that.

120 mins: Darrell Clarke’s doing a Van Gaal. The Rovers’ substitute 
goalkeeper, Steve Mildenhall, a former Grimsby keeper, is being brought on for 
the smaller-in-stature Puddy. If the ball goes out of play in time, which it 
does. The substitution is made. Mildenhall saved a penalty forGrimsby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> in the 2006 play-off final. 
There’s yer narrative.

118 mins: Rovers have a throw out on the right and, as per, Lockyer will 
propel it in, and it’s headed out for a corner. Lines’s ball in evades ever 
player though, many of whom are tussling and argy-bargying into each other in a 
fashion that’s more weary than aggressive. Danger is averted.

area but his low ball across can’t find John-Lewis and is turned behind for a 
corner, which is bravely gathered by Puddy.

113 mins: Another Rovers half-chance. A long-ball finds Monkhouse unmarked 
inside the area but his first touch lets him down. Blissett then wastes an even 
better opening by straying offside from Taylor’s break. It’s been lively since 
half-time of extra-time.

“Ian Holloway channelling Derek Smalls right there,” reckons Simon McMahon. 
“‘Do you have any artificial plates or limbs?’ ‘Not really, no.’”

106 mins: “Do you see a potential match-winner out there Ian,” Clem asks

Mackreth and Parslow down the right but the latter’s cross is easily cleared by 
Rovers.

So, we’re going the distance then: that second half was a little disappointing 
after the rumbustious entertainment of the first, though the managers will have 
been happier. Space was closed, costly errors were fewer, but both sides’ 
attackers struggled more. This will either recombust madly in extra-time, or 
drift grimly towards penalties. Impossible to pick a winner though.

It really was impossible to pick a winner from that. Two evenly matched, 
tenacious, well-drilled sides slugging it out in a match that gave us a 
thrilling first half, a slightly below par second and a surprisingly open last 
half-hour. Rovers deserve credit for recovering from a dismal start to 
gradually look the more purposeful team – just about – though Grimsby’s 
football might have been a tad more composed. Again, just about.

And amid all that, it took until 120 minutes for anyone to send in a 
John-Lewis gag about the Mariners’ top scorer, and it came from Shaun Thompson 
in Munich: “One thing occurs - this is ideal shop-window for Grimsby’s 
John-Lewis to show his wares. If a club were to come in for him, I for one 
wouldn’t expect him to be knowingly under-sold etc etc.” Given that John Lewis 
shoppers are now deemed the only segment of the electorate that matters  a 
crucial electoral demographic, I thought we might have had a few more than 
that. But you can’t have everything. What we did have was an absorbing football 
match.

Many, many commiserations to Grimsby. But we’ll have to sign off on a 
Rovers-related note, and it comes from Brian Oliver withanother version of 
their celebrated, and wonderful, anthem 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5AuA3loja8>: “Sounds good when slurred,” he 
adds, and there’ll be a fair bit of that going on tonight among the Gasheads’ 
contingent. They’ve had precious little to slur about in recent years after all.

So, as their captain Mark McChrystal hoists the trophy aloft, I’ll sign off. 
Thanks for your company and emails. It’s been epic. Bye.

The Rovers end erupts, as ends tend to do in such circumstances, while the

Coin toss: The penalties will take place at the Grimsby end. Bristol Rovers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolrovers> to take first
 
There are few more desolate feelings in football than losing a play-off final 
on penalties. Half of this record 47,000 crowd are about to experience it. I 
feel their pain.
 
So the season ends like this for these two. 
 
120 mins: Darrell Clarke’s doing a Van Gaal. The Rovers’ substitute 
goalkeeper, Steve Mildenhall, a former Grimsby keeper, is being brought on for 
the smaller-in-stature Puddy. If the ball goes out of play in time, which it 
does. The substitution is made. Mildenhall saved a penalty forGrimsby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> in the 2006 play-off final. 
There’s yer narrative.
 
118 mins: Rovers have a throw out on the right and, as per, Lockyer will 
propel it in, and it’s headed out for a corner. Lines’s ball in evades ever 
player though, many of whom are tussling and argy-bargying into each other in a 
fashion that’s more weary than aggressive. Danger is averted.
 
116 mins: Chance for Grimsby! Pittman gets clear down the left of the penalty 
area but his low ball across can’t find John-Lewis and is turned behind for a 
corner, which is bravely gathered by Puddy.
 
Grimsby <https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> get a chance for some 
much-needed possession but it breaks down when Parslow’s cross into the box is 
cut out. They come again though, but again they can’t get into Rovers’ penalty 
area, John-Lewis not finding as productive a partnership with Pittman
 
113 mins: Another Rovers half-chance. A long-ball finds Monkhouse unmarked 
inside the area but his first touch lets him down. Blissett then wastes an even 
better opening by straying offside from Taylor’s break. It’s been lively since 
half-time of extra-time.

“Ian Holloway channelling Derek Smalls right there,” reckons Simon McMahon. 
“‘Do you have any artificial plates or limbs?’ ‘Not really, no.’”
 
111 mins: Big chance for Rovers! A free-kick from the right by Mansell finds 
Lines in space at the back post but he sends his header agonisingly over.
 
110 mins: A long welly upfield finds Taylor in space on the edge of the area, 
the striker checks back but Nsiala intercepts well, as he has done often this 
afternoon.Grimsby <https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> attack down 
the right through John-Lewis and his deflected ball in causes some mayhem, 
Mackreth snatching possession from underneath the keeper but he can’t turn and 
shoot quick enough and Rovers survive
 
106 mins: “Do you see a potential match-winner out there Ian,” Clem asks 
Holloway? “Not really…” replies the Bristolian. There’s neat interplay between 
Mackreth and Parslow down the right but the latter’s cross is easily cleared by 
Rovers.
 
We’re a quarter of an hour from penalties.
 
105 mins: Rovers chance: Taylor has a yard of space 20 yards out, and takes 
one touch before half-volleying a swerving shot just wide.
 
104 mins: Grimsby attack through Parslow on the right but his cross is 
deflected back to the keeper Puddy, who gathers at his near post.
 
103 mins: Blissett, who’s been Rovers’ liveliest player since coming on if not 
always effective leads another break but the move peters out andGrimsby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> build, though they too get no 
further than the edge of the penalty area. Lines is also now suffering with 
cramp.
 
101 mins: Watching other teams’ penalty shoot-outs is a holiday in other 
people’s misery, but I can’t help feeling this is our destination now. Neither 
side can quite stitch a menacing move together at the moment.
 
99 mins: Grimsby substitution: Their final one, Craig Clay for Scott Brown.
 
98 mins: Monkhouse powers into the area for Rovers, but is crowded out, he 
goes down and appeals for a penalty more in hope than expectation. No dice.
 
97 mins: Now Rovers come, but Taylor is robbed on the edge of the area and 
Grimsby <https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> break, to no great avail.
 
96 mins: There are signs of a little more space opening up for passing game 
purposes, but both sides’ energy levels need to be raised to take advantage of 
it. To what extent do you stick or twist at this point?Grimsby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> have a long patient spell of 
possession, which ends with Brown’s cross from the right being gathered by 
Puddy.
 
93 mins: It’s the Grimsby <https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> end’s 
turn to raise the decibels as Mackreth twists, dribbles and drives down the 
right and wins a corner. Brown’s long deep corner is headed straight at Puddy – 
the corner being just a little overhit.
 
91 mins: Blissett nods a long ball back intelligently for Balanta, whose 
fierce rising drive is nonetheless straight at the keeper and well held.
 
Well that was a short break, and off we go again. Grimsby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/grimsby> kicking us off.
 
So, we’re going the distance then: that second half was a little disappointing 
after the rumbustious entertainment of the first, though the managers will have 
been happier. Space was closed, costly errors were fewer, but both sides’ 
attackers struggled more. This will either recombust madly in extra-time, or 
drift grimly towards penalties. Impossible to pick a winner though.
