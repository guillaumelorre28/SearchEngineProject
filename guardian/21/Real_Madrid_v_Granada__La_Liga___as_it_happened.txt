A close game, one that was just edged by Real Madrid

leaves them one point behind Barcelona, who play Celta Vigo tonight. Thanks for 
reading. Bye!

GOAL! Real Madrid 9-1 Granada (Ronaldo, 89 min)

Cristiano Ronaldo has his fifth goal at last. Modric lifts the free-kick to 
the far post and there’s Ronaldo to head it home. But where was the marking? I 
can’t see any marking!

84 min: Ronaldo could have had double figures. Jese scoots up the right flank 
and sends a cross towards Ronaldo, who fails to make contact with the ball at 
the far post!

GOAL! Real Madrid 8-1 Granada (Mainz own goal, 83 min)

Oh dear. Luka Modric dashes down the right and his low centre is unerringly 
thumped into his own net by Mainz, much to the annoyance of Ronaldo, who was 
waiting behind him for a tap-in.

61 min: Granada bring on Murillo for Babin. Real bring on Jese for James 
Rodriguez, whose performance has been a delight. Javier Hernandez is also on 
for Benzema, who won’t be getting a hat-trick.

GOAL! Real Madrid 7-0 Granada (Benzema, 56 min)

This is absurd. Arbeloa sets up Benzema and his shot from the right side of 
the area takes a deflection and zips up and beyold poor old Oier.

GOAL! Real Madrid 6-0 Granada (Ronaldo, 54 min)

They could get double figures. Marcelo pings a lovely diagonal from left to 
right, over the Granada defence, and Bale takes a touch and then squares it to 
Ronaldo, who heads into the empty net from yards out. He collided with the post 
as he scored and was down for a few seconds, but appears to be fine to continue.

GOAL! Real Madrid 5-0 Granada (Benzema, 52 min)

The dramatic tension decreases even further. James swings a corner to the far 
post from the left and Benzema takes advantage of woeful Granada marking, 
taking the ball down on his chest and then thrashing it into the net. How many 
more are Real going to get?

50 min: Cristiano Ronaldo drops the shoulder and goes down the outside, but 
gets his cross badly wrong, skewing it over the bar. What a waste of money.

43 min: Ronaldo tries to turn provider, but his low cross towards Oier is 
snaffled by Benzema. Granada stream up the other end end and El Arabi, who has 
barely had a sniff, goes agonisingly close to scoring a stunner! He shot from 
30 yards and the ball screamed past Casillas, only to crash down off the 
underside of the bar and on to the line! Granada claim it was over the line, 
but this is not going to be their day.

GOAL! Real Madrid 4-0 Granada (Ronaldo, 38 min)

This is getting a bit silly now. Ronaldo drives inside from the left, on to 
his right foot, and lets fly from 20 yards. It’s a fearsome effort, struck with 
terrifying venom, and the power is enough to beat Oier, who couldn’t keep it 
out despite getting two hands to the ball. He probably should have saved that, 
but maybe he just wanted to be part of a first-half hat-trick for the 
ridiculous Cristiano Ronaldo.

GOAL! Real Madrid 3-0 Granada (Ronaldo, 36 min)

The floodgates have well and truly been smashed open. Marcelo skips down the 
left and crosses. Oier palms it out, but straight to Ronaldo, who creams a 
volley past him from 12 yards.

GOAL! Real Madrid 2-0 Granada (Ronaldo, 30 min)

Stop press! Cristiano Ronaldo is smiling! Expect full analysis of that smile 
in the next few days. And maybe some analysis of this goal as well. It came 
from a cross from the right which landed at the feet of Benzema in the area. He 
should have scored but faffed around with it and lost the chance. The ball was 
only half-cleared, though, and Ronaldo left it to James Rodriguez, who cleverly 
disguised a flick back to the main man, whose right-footed finish was unerring 
from the left side of the area. They got there in the end.

still responsible for absolutely everything that is wrong in the world,

GOAL! Real Madrid 1-0 Granada (Bale, 25 min)

And Real score at this point! Toni Kroos slides a ball through the middle and 
although Mainz looks like he has it covered, he’s easily overpowered by Gareth 
Bale, who races clear, rounds Oier, takes his time, thinks about bending down 
and heading the ball over the line, decides against it, and taps the ball over 
the line before the defender can get back. What was I saying? I am a genius.
Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>, you are welcome 
and the invoice for that goal is in the post.

the ball. But you sense that Real are going to score at some point.

22 min: What a miss from Arbeloa! Marcelo charges to the byline and his 
chipped cross reaches his fellow full-back, Arbeloa, who somehow turns the ball 
wide of the open goal from a couple of yards out! Real should be ahead.

17 min: Bale has a dig from 25 yards. Deflected. Wide. Corner. Bale jumps 
high, Benzema jumps higher and his header pings off a defender and goes wide. 
Goal-kick, obviously.

14 min: Granada go so close to taking the lead! Real lose possession in their 
own half and Ibanez is able to run at a backtracking Ramos, before drilling a 
low shot inches past the far post. Casillas was beaten.

12 min: Ronaldo does around 400 stepovers and then rams a shot into the side 
netting from the left. A swaying Foulqier looks rather dizzy after that.

1o min: This is why Granada are probably going down. A long ball over the top 
should be dealt with by one of Oier and Juan Carlos. Oier comes off his line, 
apparently to collect it, and the left-back lets the ball drop over his head, 
presumably because he got a shout, but neither incompetent had reckoned with 
Gareth Bale turning up in between them. Bale gets there post and lobs the ball 
over Oier - but just over. Unlucky.

6 min: It’s okay, though, because I sleep under my desk. Please don’t tell my 
bosses that. They’re mistakenly under the impression that a family of possums 
are living in the Guardian office.

5 min: Benzema, looking along the line, is caught offside. It’s early. I mean, 
I only woke up 20 minutes ago.

3 min: Kroos can’t win the ball in midfield and Granada break, Ibanez sent 
haring away down the right. He waits for support and finds it in the form of 
Rochina, whose shot is deflected, the ball running through to Casillas, who 
manages not to throw it in. Well done, Iker.

And we’re off! Granada, in their red and white shirts, get the ball rolling. 
They’re cowering from right to left in the first half. And you know whatReal 
Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are wearing, so don’t 
even ask.

So Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> could do with 
waking up.They’ve been playing badly all year, the title is in danger of 
slipping away, they’ve got their bogey team, Atletico Madrid, in the last eight 
of the Champions League and Carlo Ancelotti is under increasing pressure, with 
noted managerial genius Zinedine Zidane innocently lurking around in the 
shadows. All of which means that a visit from lowly Granada, 19th in La Liga, 
is most welcome, a chance for Real to restore some much-needed confidence. 
That’s the theory anyway.

Kick-off: 11am in London, 12pm in Madrid.

close  
A close game, one that was just edged by Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>, and this hard-fought win 
leaves them one point behind Barcelona, who play Celta Vigo tonight. Thanks for 
reading. Bye!
 
90 min: This is set to be Real’s biggest win since 1967.
 
Cristiano Ronaldo has his fifth goal at last. Modric lifts the free-kick to 
the far post and there’s Ronaldo to head it home. But where was the marking? I 
can’t see any marking!
 
89 min: Bale is sent flying by Murrilo on the right. Yellow card.
 
85 min: Marcelo’s cross is headed over by Ronaldo. He grins. Real have had 30 
shots.
 
84 min: Ronaldo could have had double figures. Jese scoots up the right flank 
and sends a cross towards Ronaldo, who fails to make contact with the ball at 
the far post!
 
Oh dear. Luka Modric dashes down the right and his low centre is unerringly 
thumped into his own net by Mainz, much to the annoyance of Ronaldo, who was 
waiting behind him for a tap-in.
 
82 min: Ronaldo’s goal drought continues, his free-kick from 30 yards bouncing 
wide.
 
78 min: Bale’s sidefooter is pushed over by Oier.
 
The comeback is on! Ibanez breaks clear of the Real defence, who can probably 
be forgiven for dozing off, and slides the ball confidently past Casillas.
 
72 min: Ronaldo really wants that 15th goal. Jese finds Arbeloa on the overlap 
and his clipped cross is stabbed wide by Ronaldo from six yards!
 
70 min: Ronaldo. Bale. Ronaldo. Goal? No. Ronaldo has his head in his hands, 
his scuffed effort from six yards out dribbling wide.
 
67 min: Marcelo swings a cross into the area, but Hernandez sends his free 
header straight at Oier, and looks doleful.
 
65 min: The Bernabeu cheers. They thought this free-kick from Bale was in. But 
it wasn’t, it hit the side-netting.
 
62 min: Ronaldo almost scores his fifth. An attempted clearance from Murrilo 
hits Ronaldo and runs kindly for him, but he can’t poke the ball around Oier.
 
61 min: Granada bring on Murillo for Babin. Real bring on Jese for James 
Rodriguez, whose performance has been a delight. Javier Hernandez is also on 
for Benzema, who won’t be getting a hat-trick.
 
60 min: Ronaldo’s skimmer from 20 yards flashes just wide.
 
59 min: Real have had eight shots on target and scored seven. They’ve got some 
decent finishers.
 
58 min: A Real attack fails to end in a goal. Varane heads over from a James 
Rodriguez corner.
 
57 min: Real bring on Asier Illarramendi for Toni Kroos.
 
This is absurd. Arbeloa sets up Benzema and his shot from the right side of 
the area takes a deflection and zips up and beyold poor old Oier.
 
They could get double figures. Marcelo pings a lovely diagonal from left to 
right, over the Granada defence, and Bale takes a touch and then squares it to 
Ronaldo, who heads into the empty net from yards out. He collided with the post 
as he scored and was down for a few seconds, but appears to be fine to continue.
 
53 min: Piti replaces Ruben Rochina.
 
The dramatic tension decreases even further. James swings a corner to the far 
post from the left and Benzema takes advantage of woeful Granada marking, 
taking the ball down on his chest and then thrashing it into the net. How many 
more are Real going to get?
 
51 min: Modric has a pop from 20 yards. Over it goes. I feel that there is a 
lack of dramatic tension.
 
50 min: Cristiano Ronaldo drops the shoulder and goes down the outside, but 
gets his cross badly wrong, skewing it over the bar. What a waste of money.
 
48 min: Iker Casillas isn’t what he was. He spills a shot from Ibanez from 20 
yards, but recovers in time to snatch the ball before any mischief can occur.
 
46 min: Off we go again. Forty-five more minutes of watching Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> take candy from a baby.
 
I think that Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are 
going to win this match.
 
43 min: Ronaldo tries to turn provider, but his low cross towards Oier is 
snaffled by Benzema. Granada stream up the other end end and El Arabi, who has 
barely had a sniff, goes agonisingly close to scoring a stunner! He shot from 
30 yards and the ball screamed past Casillas, only to crash down off the 
underside of the bar and on to the line! Granada claim it was over the line, 
but this is not going to be their day.
 
40 min: On the plus side for Granada, they played quite well in the first 25 
minutes.
 
This is getting a bit silly now. Ronaldo drives inside from the left, on to 
his right foot, and lets fly from 20 yards. It’s a fearsome effort, struck with 
terrifying venom, and the power is enough to beat Oier, who couldn’t keep it 
out despite getting two hands to the ball. He probably should have saved that, 
but maybe he just wanted to be part of a first-half hat-trick for the 
ridiculous Cristiano Ronaldo.
 
The floodgates have well and truly been smashed open. Marcelo skips down the 
left and crosses. Oier palms it out, but straight to Ronaldo, who creams a 
volley past him from 12 yards.
 
32 min: What a beautiful smile, though. A princely smile.
 
Stop press! Cristiano Ronaldo is smiling! Expect full analysis of that smile 
in the next few days. And maybe some analysis of this goal as well. It came 
from a cross from the right which landed at the feet of Benzema in the area. He 
should have scored but faffed around with it and lost the chance. The ball was 
only half-cleared, though, and Ronaldo left it to James Rodriguez, who cleverly 
disguised a flick back to the main man, whose right-footed finish was unerring 
from the left side of the area. They got there in the end.
 
29 min: Ronaldo’s shot is deflected over from the left. Real are threatening 
to run riot now.
 
28 min: Especially caramelised onions.
 
27 min: A good goal from Gareth Bale, but I think we can all agree that he is 
still responsible for absolutely everything that is wrong in the world, 
including caramelised onions.
 
And Real score at this point! Toni Kroos slides a ball through the middle and 
although Mainz looks like he has it covered, he’s easily overpowered by Gareth 
Bale, who races clear, rounds Oier, takes his time, thinks about bending down 
and heading the ball over the line, decides against it, and taps the ball over 
the line before the defender can get back. What was I saying? I am a genius.
Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>, you are welcome 
and the invoice for that goal is in the post.
 
25 min: This is a pretty open game. Granada are breaking well when they get 
the ball. But you sense that Real are going to score at some point.
 
23 min: Emails please!
 
22 min: What a miss from Arbeloa! Marcelo charges to the byline and his 
chipped cross reaches his fellow full-back, Arbeloa, who somehow turns the ball 
wide of the open goal from a couple of yards out! Real should be ahead.
 
19 min: Modric turns brilliantly in the middle, wriggling clear of the Granada 
midfield, but his shot from 25 yards is blocked.
 
17 min: Bale has a dig from 25 yards. Deflected. Wide. Corner. Bale jumps 
high, Benzema jumps higher and his header pings off a defender and goes wide. 
Goal-kick, obviously.
 
14 min: Granada go so close to taking the lead! Real lose possession in their 
own half and Ibanez is able to run at a backtracking Ramos, before drilling a 
low shot inches past the far post. Casillas was beaten.
 
12 min: Ronaldo does around 400 stepovers and then rams a shot into the side 
netting from the left. A swaying Foulqier looks rather dizzy after that.
 
1o min: This is why Granada are probably going down. A long ball over the top 
should be dealt with by one of Oier and Juan Carlos. Oier comes off his line, 
apparently to collect it, and the left-back lets the ball drop over his head, 
presumably because he got a shout, but neither incompetent had reckoned with 
Gareth Bale turning up in between them. Bale gets there post and lobs the ball 
over Oier - but just over. Unlucky.
 
9 min: Blackburn legend Ruben Rochina shoots from 30 yards. He does not score.
 
8 min: James Rodriguez pops up on the left and bends a cross to the far post 
to the stretching Benzema, who catches the ball cleanly on the volley. Oier 
holds it at his near post.
 
6 min: It’s okay, though, because I sleep under my desk. Please don’t tell my 
bosses that. They’re mistakenly under the impression that a family of possums 
are living in the Guardian office.
 
5 min: Benzema, looking along the line, is caught offside. It’s early. I mean, 
I only woke up 20 minutes ago.
 
3 min: Kroos can’t win the ball in midfield and Granada break, Ibanez sent 
haring away down the right. He waits for support and finds it in the form of 
Rochina, whose shot is deflected, the ball running through to Casillas, who 
manages not to throw it in. Well done, Iker.
 
2 min: Look outside. Go on. Look. It’s got the potential to become so sunny. 
 
And we’re off! Granada, in their red and white shirts, get the ball rolling. 
They’re cowering from right to left in the first half. And you know whatReal 
Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> are wearing, so don’t 
even ask.
 
Here come the teams! Soon there will be football.
 
Real Madrid: Casillas; Arbeloa, Ramos, Varane, Marcelo; Modric, Kroos, James; 
Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo.Subs: Keylor Navas, Coentrao, Chicharito, Lucas Silva, 
Nacho, Jesé, Illarramendi.

Granada: Oier; Foulquier, Babin, Mainz, Juan Carlos; Iturra, Fran Rico; Robert 
Ibáñez, Rochina, Candeias; El Arabi.Subs: Roberto, Nyom, Javi Márquez, Piti, 
Riki, Eddy, Murillo.
