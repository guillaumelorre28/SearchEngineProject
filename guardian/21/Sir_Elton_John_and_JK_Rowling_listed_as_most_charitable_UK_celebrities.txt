a large proportion of their fortune to charities.

John gave £26.8m to charity last year, mainly to his Aids foundations in 
Britain and the US which he established in 1992. Rowling donated £10.3m,

around the world by 2050, as well as the Volant Charitable Trust, which raises 
money to alleviate social deprivation and for research into multiple sclerosis, 
which killed Rowling’s mother.

Golfer Rory McIlroy, boyband One Direction and Queen musicians Brian May and 
Roger Taylor also featured among the top celebrity givers.

The Sunday Times list showed that in total, the wealthy have given £2.66bn to

topped by the Sainsbury family for the third year in a row. The family, who 
made their money as the founders of Britain’s second largest supermarket chain, 
gave £220m in 2015, totalling almost 40% of their wealth.

Of the celebrities in the list, athletes and musicians proved to be the most 
generous. David Beckham donated £5m to children’s charities. Coldplay donated 
£1.7m, while Ringo Starr gave£1.6m, raised through an auction of Beatles 
memorabilia, to his own Lotus Foundation.
