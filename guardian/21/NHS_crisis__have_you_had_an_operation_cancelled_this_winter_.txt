Dozens of hospitals in England have had to declare a black alert – the highest 
form of emergency status – this week after becoming so overcrowded that they 
could no longer guarantee patient safety and provide their full range of normal 
services.

To cope with a surge in demand for care hospitals have been forced to take 
highly unusual steps, such as cancelling cancer operations. Two days in a row 
Broomfield hospital, Essex, had to tell a patient with oesophageal cancer that 
they could not have their scheduled oesophagectomy – which could cure them – 
because it had no free intensive care bed in which to care for them after the 
procedure. One cancer specialist at the trust said: “I have never seen so many 
cancer operations cancelled.

It comes after weeks of cancelled non-emergency operations to cope with 
pressure on the health service. The NHS cancelled 446 urgent operations in 
November, almost double the number in the same month last year. The director of 
communications at NHS England, Simon Enright, tweeted: “It is true that theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is very busy at the moment – record 
demand.”


The health service regulator also asked hospitals to postpone most of their 
planned operations in a drive to make more beds available over Christmas.
