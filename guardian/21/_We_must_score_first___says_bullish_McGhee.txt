The Scottish side need to overturn a 1-0 deficit but their manager, Mark 
McGhee, claims his men can even afford to concede an away goal - providing it 
is not the opener. "For me, it's only important that we score first," he said. 
"I think if they score first, it will maybe kill the atmosphere." McGhee played 
five across midfield in France but will be more positive tonight.

"We feel that three up front is a good way of playing so it's definitely an 
option," he said.
