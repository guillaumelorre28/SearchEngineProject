Wisdom the albatross, the world’s oldest-known breeding bird in the wild, has 
laid an egg at 66 years of age after returning to a wildlife refuge in the 
Pacific Ocean, US wildlife officials have said.

Midway Atoll national wildlife refuge, the world’s largest albatross colony,

While it was not known when she laid her egg – her 41st – it was likely to 
have been in the past few days, the agency said.

Wisdom’s journey back to motherhood, at 66 years of age or possibly older, has 
amazed staff at the refuge.

Laysan albatrosses, which are monogamous, typically live for 12 to 40 years. 
They spend the vast majority of their lives in the air, flying thousands of 
miles each year in search of food across vast tracts of the north Pacific Ocean.

“I find it impressive that not only has Wisdom returned for over six decades 
as the oldest living, breeding bird in the wild, but also that biologists here 
on Midway have been keeping records that have allowed us to keep track of her 
over the years,” Charlie Pelizza of the Midway Atoll refuge wrote on the 
agency’sTumblr page

.

“When I made it to lunch, I knew something was up. The staff was abuzz with 
the news that Wisdom was back and incubating,” he wrote.

The biologist Chandler Robbins, now 98, first placed an aluminium band around 
the albatross’s ankle at the Pacific Ocean atoll in 1956. Forty-six years 
later, Robbins spotted Wisdom among thousands of birds near the same nesting 
area and affixed a sturdier band to her ankle.

Wisdom has fledged at least nine chicks since 2006, and travelled roughly 3m 
miles in her lifetime. Her latest chick, Kukini, hatched in February.

Wildlife <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife> officials said 
Wisdom would be likely to incubate her egg for a number of days until her mate, 
Akeakamai – a Hawaiian word that means a love of wisdom – returned to take over 
the incubation and she ventured to sea to eat.
