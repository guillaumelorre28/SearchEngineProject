FULL TIME: Villarreal 1-0 Liverpool

And that’s pretty much the last kick of the match! A stunning counter attack 
deep into stoppage time has given the Yellow Submarine a crucial advantage in 
thisEuropa League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> 
semi-final. Villarreal stepped it up towards the end of the game, and got their 
reward. Jurgen Klopp looks visibly deflated, and no wonder: his side are 
suddenly up against it if they want to reach the final in Basle next month! 
Last word to palindrome fan Andy Gordon: “Bugger. I preferred the 0-0 
aesthetic!”

GOAL! Villarreal 1-0 Liverpool (Lopez 90+2)

Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are playing a high 
line. Suarez bursts after a long ball down the right, and he’s got the beating 
of Toure. He draws Mignolet as he reaches the area, then lays off into the 
centre for Lopez, who sidefoots into an empty net! A brilliant move by the home 
side, and a sucker punch for Liverpool!

90 min +1: Milner, on the right, crosses towards Benteke, who can’t quite get 
enough on his header from eight yards. The ball breaks left to Ibe, but he 
can’t keep the move going. This game has burst into life at the very end!

88 min: ... another corner, Lovren heading behind. And then from that, Suarez 
miscontrols in the deep, and suddenly Moreno is racing clear up the other end! 
For a second it looks like he’s going to replicate his pitch-length strike 
against Spurs last season, but instead slashes wildly high and left from the 
edge of the box. In fairness, he had Musacchio breathing down his neck, but 
even so, that’s a chance for a crucial away goal spurned.
 Alberto Moreno reacts after a missing a chance to win it at the end.

stretches long to fingertip wide of the post! What a save! And from the corner

84 min: Milner loops a cross into the danger zone from the right, but Mario 
eyebrows away under no real pressure from any red shirt. Moreno tries to 
re-energise the attack on the left, but can’t get the ball back into the box.

78 min: Ibe makes good down the left and earns a throw. Then, just after the 
ball’s flung back into play, he’s needlessly caught offside. Klopp doesn’t look 
particularly happy with that, either, though it’s his own man getting the laser 
stare now.

there. He’s replaced by Mateo Musacchio.

75 min: Adrian Lopez comes on for Soldado. Lucas then hoicks a long ball down 
the inside-left channel, and Lallana chases it from deep. He’s clear on goal! 
And then brought down in the area by Bailly. But the flag’s up for offside. A 
very, very marginal decision, that. On the touchline, Klopp throws a few 
semaphore shapes before engaging the fourth official in philosophical debate.

70 min: The ref didn’t do a very good job of calming Soldado down. He slides 
across and flips Lucas into the air like a fried egg. He should be booked for 
that, but like Toure a few seconds earlier, he escapes sanction. See, it all 
works out in the long run.

69 min: This is getting a little feisty. Soldado and Toure come together in 
the middle of the park. Toure’s a bit lucky to escape a yellow card, as he wins 
the ball with a high boot. Soldado isn’t happy about it at all. The referee 
does his best to calm him down.

67 min: Marvellous scenes on the touchline after Lucas and Pina come together 
in the midfield. A big 50-50 crunch, but Lucas is penalised. Managers Klopp and 
Marcelino spend a few seconds gesticulating at each other, then have a full and 
frank exchange of views, before smiling and hugging each other. All pals again.

65 min: Milner plays a brilliant snappy pass down the inside-right channel to 
suddenly spring Firmino into theVillarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> box. Firmino turns and 
hammers hard towards the bottom right. Asenjo fingertips the shot onto the 
post, and the ball twangs away at speed. A fine pass, a magnificent shot, and a 
stunning save. Hats off.
 Roberto Firmino shoots at the goal but is denied by a fine save by Asenjo.

63 min: Poor old Jaume Costa’s got a mouth full of blood, having taken a whack 
from Lovren’s elbow. There’s no question of foul play, though; it was a very 
strange incident, with theVillarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> defender running into the 
Liverpool player’s limply hanging arm. There wasn’t much elbow point to work 
with there at all! That’s very odd, and extremely unlucky. But he’ll be OK.

61 min: Ibe skitters down the left, cuts inside, and lays off to Allen, whose 
shot from 20 yards is meek. Milner picks up possession with a view to having 
another go, but miscontrols.Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> try to break upfield, but 
leave the ball to Lucas, who slides one down the right. If Firmino was on the 
front foot, he’d have been clear, but he checks back instead, and all momentum 
is lost. Liverpool aren’t playing badly, but they’re struggling to move up 
through the gears in the final third.

55 min: Mario makes good down the right, and his low cross causes all manner 
of pinball nonsense in theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> box. Bakambu tries to work 
room for a shot, but is forced to lay off to Soldado upon being swarmed. The 
ball breaks right to the man who started it all off; Mario blasts wildly over 
the bar from a tight angle, neither an effective cross nor realistic shot.

53 min: Coutinho isn’t injured, but his substitution isn’t tactical either; 
he’s simply feeling unwell.

51 min: Milner has a dig from a position on the right. It’s deflected away for 
a corner on the left. The ball’s worked out to Moreno, 25 yards out. His shot 
isn’t up to much, and Asenjo claims easily.

49 min: Villarreal are nearly made to pay for their poor decision at that 
corner.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> edge their 
way up the park, and Lallana whips a ball into the box from the right that very 
nearly fluke-loops, Paul Konchesky style, into the far corner. Asenjo does very 
well to paw the ball away from danger.

47 min: Another corner for Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal>, who have started this second 
half with great intent. It’s played short, and what a waste it is. The chance 
to hover another ball above this set-piece-shaky Liverpool defence is turned 
down.

46 min: Suarez comes at Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> immediately, and his pass 
towards Soldado down the inside-right channel forces Toure into stretching and 
conceding a corner. From the set piece. Bakambu rises above Lovren and from six 
yards crashes a header off the outside of the right-hand post. On the 
touchline, Klopp raises a wry eyebrow. His side should be behind.
 Oooh, that was close. Photograph: Denis Doyle/UEFA via Getty Images

And we're off again!

Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> get the ball 
rolling for the second half. They’ve made a change, and it’s not the one you 
might expect: Jordon Ibe comes on for Philippe Coutinho. An injury? Nobody 
knows yet. “VIL 0-0 LIV,” recites Andy Gordon. “I am enjoying the palindromic 
score summary on the TV screen. OK, I’m easily amused.”

HALF TIME: Villarreal 0-0 Liverpool

Time for one last corner. It’s Liverpool’s, out on the right. Lucas gets his 
eyebrows to it, Asenjo claims, and that’s that for the opening 45. A half which 
promised more than it delivered, but it was entertaining enough, and the second 
45 promises fascination. No flipping!

44 min: A bit of tiki-taka by Liverpool in front of the Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> box, Clyne, Lallana, Firmino 
and Coutinho all involved. But it’s way too intricate, and eventually 
possession is given up. Bombing down the flanks seemed a better option, to be 
honest.

42 min: Bruno slips a ball down the middle of the park for Soldado, who turns 
and shoots from the right-hand edge of the D. He sends a fine curler inches 
wide of the right-hand post. Wow, that was close. Mignolet waves his arms 
dismissively, kidding on he had it covered, but he’s fooling nobody. If that 
was on target, it was in.

close  
And that’s pretty much the last kick of the match! A stunning counter attack 
deep into stoppage time has given the Yellow Submarine a crucial advantage in 
thisEuropa League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> 
semi-final. Villarreal stepped it up towards the end of the game, and got their 
reward. Jurgen Klopp looks visibly deflated, and no wonder: his side are 
suddenly up against it if they want to reach the final in Basle next month! 
Last word to palindrome fan Andy Gordon: “Bugger. I preferred the 0-0 
aesthetic!”

Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are playing a high 
line. Suarez bursts after a long ball down the right, and he’s got the beating 
of Toure. He draws Mignolet as he reaches the area, then lays off into the 
centre for Lopez, who sidefoots into an empty net! A brilliant move by the home 
side, and a sucker punch for Liverpool!

90 min +1: Milner, on the right, crosses towards Benteke, who can’t quite get 
enough on his header from eight yards. The ball breaks left to Ibe, but he 
can’t keep the move going. This game has burst into life at the very end!
 
90 min: Firmino is replaced by Christian Benteke. There will be three added 
minutes.
 
88 min: ... another corner, Lovren heading behind. And then from that, Suarez 
miscontrols in the deep, and suddenly Moreno is racing clear up the other end! 
For a second it looks like he’s going to replicate his pitch-length strike 
against Spurs last season, but instead slashes wildly high and left from the 
edge of the box. In fairness, he had Musacchio breathing down his neck, but 
even so, that’s a chance for a crucial away goal spurned.

87 min: Bakambu is so close to scoring! He’s been quiet all evening, but 
suddenly he bursts down the inside-right channel, reaches the edge of the area, 
and powers a curler towards the bottom left. It’s going in, but Mignolet 
stretches long to fingertip wide of the post! What a save! And from the corner 
...
 
86 min: Ibe bursts into the box down the left and reaches the touchline. He 
scoops long, Clyne rising at the far post but unable to direct his header on 
target. The ball floats harmlessly wide right.
 
84 min: Milner loops a cross into the danger zone from the right, but Mario 
eyebrows away under no real pressure from any red shirt. Moreno tries to 
re-energise the attack on the left, but can’t get the ball back into the box.
 
83 min: Castillejo makes a couple of runs down the left, but can’t quite send 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> into panic, although 
a neat enough one-two with Suarez nearly comes off.
 
82 min: Liverpool spend a couple of minutes knocking the ball around the 
middle, withVillarreal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> 
sitting deep. It’s an unexciting stand-off.

80 min: Free kick to Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal>, 30 yards out on the right. A 
chance to load the box. Suarez overhits the floater, and it’s easy for Mignolet 
to spring up and claim.
 
78 min: Ibe makes good down the left and earns a throw. Then, just after the 
ball’s flung back into play, he’s needlessly caught offside. Klopp doesn’t look 
particularly happy with that, either, though it’s his own man getting the laser 
stare now.
 
77 min: Bailly looks to have tugged the old hamstring while chasing back 
there. He’s replaced by Mateo Musacchio.
 
75 min: Adrian Lopez comes on for Soldado. Lucas then hoicks a long ball down 
the inside-left channel, and Lallana chases it from deep. He’s clear on goal! 
And then brought down in the area by Bailly. But the flag’s up for offside. A 
very, very marginal decision, that. On the touchline, Klopp throws a few 
semaphore shapes before engaging the fourth official in philosophical debate.
 
73 min: Clyne fires a low cross into the Villarreal box from the right. It’s 
only half cleared, and Allen feeds the ball out to Clyne again. Clyne dinks it 
in this time, and Lallana is gifted a header six yards out. He can’t power it 
goalwards, though, andVillarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> hack clear.
 
72 min: First change for the hosts: Samuel Castillejo comes on for Dos Santos.
 
70 min: The ref didn’t do a very good job of calming Soldado down. He slides 
across and flips Lucas into the air like a fried egg. He should be booked for 
that, but like Toure a few seconds earlier, he escapes sanction. See, it all 
works out in the long run.
 
69 min: This is getting a little feisty. Soldado and Toure come together in 
the middle of the park. Toure’s a bit lucky to escape a yellow card, as he wins 
the ball with a high boot. Soldado isn’t happy about it at all. The referee 
does his best to calm him down.
 
67 min: Marvellous scenes on the touchline after Lucas and Pina come together 
in the midfield. A big 50-50 crunch, but Lucas is penalised. Managers Klopp and 
Marcelino spend a few seconds gesticulating at each other, then have a full and 
frank exchange of views, before smiling and hugging each other. All pals again.

65 min: Milner plays a brilliant snappy pass down the inside-right channel to 
suddenly spring Firmino into theVillarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> box. Firmino turns and 
hammers hard towards the bottom right. Asenjo fingertips the shot onto the 
post, and the ball twangs away at speed. A fine pass, a magnificent shot, and a 
stunning save. Hats off.

63 min: Poor old Jaume Costa’s got a mouth full of blood, having taken a whack 
from Lovren’s elbow. There’s no question of foul play, though; it was a very 
strange incident, with theVillarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> defender running into the 
Liverpool player’s limply hanging arm. There wasn’t much elbow point to work 
with there at all! That’s very odd, and extremely unlucky. But he’ll be OK.
 
61 min: Ibe skitters down the left, cuts inside, and lays off to Allen, whose 
shot from 20 yards is meek. Milner picks up possession with a view to having 
another go, but miscontrols.Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> try to break upfield, but 
leave the ball to Lucas, who slides one down the right. If Firmino was on the 
front foot, he’d have been clear, but he checks back instead, and all momentum 
is lost. Liverpool aren’t playing badly, but they’re struggling to move up 
through the gears in the final third.
 
60 min: Jaume Costa goes in the book for a late slide on Clyne. He can’t 
really complain, and to his credit, he doesn’t.
 
58 min: Suarez scampers off down the left wing, nutmegging Milner to wild 
cheers. The run comes to nothing, but what a piece of skill.He’s a European 
nutmeg magnet, poor Milner. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-cTpdS0S8>
 
57 min: It’s all a bit scrappy right now. Tense and scrappy. Semi-final 
football, right here.
 
55 min: Mario makes good down the right, and his low cross causes all manner 
of pinball nonsense in theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> box. Bakambu tries to work 
room for a shot, but is forced to lay off to Soldado upon being swarmed. The 
ball breaks right to the man who started it all off; Mario blasts wildly over 
the bar from a tight angle, neither an effective cross nor realistic shot.

53 min: Coutinho isn’t injured, but his substitution isn’t tactical either; 
he’s simply feeling unwell.
 
51 min: Milner has a dig from a position on the right. It’s deflected away for 
a corner on the left. The ball’s worked out to Moreno, 25 yards out. His shot 
isn’t up to much, and Asenjo claims easily.
 
49 min: Villarreal are nearly made to pay for their poor decision at that 
corner.Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> edge their 
way up the park, and Lallana whips a ball into the box from the right that very 
nearly fluke-loops, Paul Konchesky style, into the far corner. Asenjo does very 
well to paw the ball away from danger.
 
47 min: Another corner for Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal>, who have started this second 
half with great intent. It’s played short, and what a waste it is. The chance 
to hover another ball above this set-piece-shaky Liverpool defence is turned 
down.
 
46 min: Suarez comes at Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> immediately, and his pass 
towards Soldado down the inside-right channel forces Toure into stretching and 
conceding a corner. From the set piece. Bakambu rises above Lovren and from six 
yards crashes a header off the outside of the right-hand post. On the 
touchline, Klopp raises a wry eyebrow. His side should be behind.
 Oooh, that was close. Photograph: Denis Doyle/UEFA via Getty Images  
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> get the ball 
rolling for the second half. They’ve made a change, and it’s not the one you 
might expect: Jordon Ibe comes on for Philippe Coutinho. An injury? Nobody 
knows yet. “VIL 0-0 LIV,” recites Andy Gordon. “I am enjoying the palindromic 
score summary on the TV screen. OK, I’m easily amused.”

Time for one last corner. It’s Liverpool’s, out on the right. Lucas gets his 
eyebrows to it, Asenjo claims, and that’s that for the opening 45. A half which 
promised more than it delivered, but it was entertaining enough, and the second 
45 promises fascination. No flipping!
 
44 min: A bit of tiki-taka by Liverpool in front of the Villarreal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/villarreal> box, Clyne, Lallana, Firmino 
and Coutinho all involved. But it’s way too intricate, and eventually 
possession is given up. Bombing down the flanks seemed a better option, to be 
honest.
 
42 min: Bruno slips a ball down the middle of the park for Soldado, who turns 
and shoots from the right-hand edge of the D. He sends a fine curler inches 
wide of the right-hand post. Wow, that was close. Mignolet waves his arms 
dismissively, kidding on he had it covered, but he’s fooling nobody. If that 
was on target, it was in.
