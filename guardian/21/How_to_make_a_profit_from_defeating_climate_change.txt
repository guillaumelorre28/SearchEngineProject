From rising sea levels to more severe storms and more intense droughts, 
climate change will present serious risks to, and create major opportunities 
for, nearly every industry. Citizens, consumers, businesses, governments, and 
international organisations are all taking action. And entrepreneurs are 
developing disruptive technologies that will create and destroy value.

Michael Bloomberg to head global taskforce on climate change

The challenge is that investors currently don’t have the information they need 
to respond to these developments. This must change if financial markets are 
going to do what they do best: allocate capital to manage risks and seize new 
opportunities. Without the necessary information, market adjustments to climate 
change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilising.

Public policy, consumer demand and technological innovation are driving a 
shift towards a low-carbon economy. Which companies and industries are most, 
and least, dependent on fossil fuels? And who stands ready to provide resilient 
and sustainable infrastructure? Which financial institutions are best 
positioned to gain and which to lose? In every case, which firms have the 
governance, resources and the strategy to manage, and profit from, these major 
shifts?

We believe that financial disclosure is essential to a market-based solution 
to climate change. A properly functioning market will price in the risks 
associated with climate change and reward firms that mitigate them. As its 
impact becomes more commonplace and public policy responses more active, 
climate change has become a material risk that isn’t properly disclosed.

In response to a G20 request to consider the financial stability risks, the 
Financial Stability Board created ataskforce on climate-related financial 
disclosures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/04/mark-carney-unveils-global-taskforce-to-educate-business-on-climate-change>
. Its purpose is to develop voluntary, consistent disclosures to help 
investors, lenders and insurance underwriters manage material climate risks. As 
befits a solution by the market for the market, the taskforce is led by members 
of the private sector from across the G20, including major companies, large 
investors, global banks and insurers.

After a year of intensive work and widespread consultation its recommendations 
are now publicly available. They concentrate on the practical, material 
disclosures most relevant to investors and creditors and which can be compiled 
by all companies that raise capital as well as financial institutions.

We are pleased that all taskforce members, companies with market 
capitalisation of $1.5tn and financial institutions responsible for assets of 
$20tn, have announced their support for the disclosure recommendations. We 
encourage others to participate in the consultation, to become early adopters 
thereafter, and to encourage the companies in which they invest to also make 
the disclosures.

A year ago in Paris, 195 countries committed to limit the rise in global 
average temperatures to less than 2C 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations>
. With better disclosure, a market in the transition to that world can be 
built. That market will expose the likely future cost of doing business, of 
paying for emissions, and of changing processes to avoid both those charges and 
tighter regulation. And it will help smooth price adjustments as opinions 
change, rather than concentrating them in a short, dangerous space of time.

Of course, given the uncertainties around climate, not everyone will agree on 
the timing or scale of adjustments required to achieve this goal. But the right 
information will allow optimists and pessimists, sceptics and evangelists, to 
back their convictions with their capital.

Early disclosure rules allowed 20th-century financial markets to grow our 
economies by pricing risks more accurately. The spread of such standards 
internationally has helped lift more than a billion people out of poverty. 
Climate-related disclosures could be as transformative for 21st-century markets.
