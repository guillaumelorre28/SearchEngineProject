Luton Town <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lutontown> have adopted the 
living wage as their minimum level of pay for all staff.

The MP David Lammy, who has been campaigning for every Premier League club in 
London <http://www.fairnessinfootball.org.uk> to follow that path, said Luton 
had become the first club among the 92 league clubs to commit to the living 
wage.

Luton, who were promoted from the Conference last season and are second in 
League Two, saidon their website 
<http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/luton-town-adopt-living-wage-2135529.aspx>
: “This applies to all contracted members of staff in all departments including 
football, retail, catering, maintenance and administration. The change to staff 
pay will be absorbed by the club and there will be no increases in ticket or 
retail prices as a result.”

The UK living wage is £7.85 an hour outside London and £9.15 an hour in the 
capital.

Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, tweeted <https://twitter.com/davidlammy>: 
“League 2 club (Luton) with 1 of the smallest budgets becomes 1st of Eng’s 92 
pro clubs to commit to Living Wage. Puts bigger clubs to shame.”

FC United of Manchester were the first to sign up to the living wage and 
Hearts are another club to have adopted it.
