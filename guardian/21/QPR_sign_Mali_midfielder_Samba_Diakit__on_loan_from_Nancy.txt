Queens Park Rangers have completed the signing of the Nancy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/nancy> defensive midfielder Samba 
Diakité. The 23-year-old Mali international has joined on loan until the end of 
the season when the transfer could be made permanent.

"Samba is a young player who has made an impression on French football," the 
QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> manager, Mark Hughes, said. 
"There has been a lot of interest in him from top clubs in France so we have 
done really well to get him in.

"He is a good age, has got strength, power, can carry the ball and can score 
goals from midfield on occasions. He will give us more physical presence and 
athleticism in the middle of the park so he is going to be a good addition."

Diakité is currently on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations but 
flew to London for a medical on Sunday afternoon, with the required paperwork 
completed on Monday lunchtime.

"It is a dream to join a Premier League club," Diakité said. "The board and 
the manager have big ambitions to achieve and I am delighted to join a club 
with such goals."
