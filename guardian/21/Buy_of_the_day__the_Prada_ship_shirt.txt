With its sailor hats, opened Breton-striped shirts and neckerchiefs 
intertwined with seafaring trails, Miuccia Prada’s menswear collection was 
nautically themed. There was something of ahipster fisherman influence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/26/fisherman-fashion-menswear-workwear-trend>
 on the collection, but there was also a much grander narrative taking place.

The grand “whoosh” of the shipmate epic is felt, and indeed Homer’s Odyssey, 
Noah’s Ark and Moby Dick were all cited as influences. This shirt, with its 
multiple images of black-and-white Viking longboats, is labyrinthine in its 
design, falling somewhere between the densely detailed likes of a Grayson Perry 
pot and a Beano comic (check out the speech bubbles and exclamation marks). 
It’s a story within a story, probably involving walking the plank, 
passive-aggressive parrots and plenty of: “Aha! Me hearties!”. There could not 
be a better statement against minimalist dressing.
