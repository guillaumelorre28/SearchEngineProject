Certain numbers, words and phrases will always take us on a journey down 
memory lane. 9/11. WW2. 25/12. “Grab them by the pussy.”

Now the numbers 2016 have a place in history, marking the year 
anti-establishment groups obtained their voice. While the movement has drawn 
conflicting viewpoints on what makes it so good or so bad, Leomie Anderson has 
provided consensus within the fashion world. Her LAPP brand, which launched in 
September, consists of a blogging space and now a fashion collection that marks 
the empowering nature of the anti-movement.

Anderson said she hoped “the words LAPP will take women away from the spaces 
of misogyny, gossip, bad advice, and transport them into an uplifting 
community” towrite articles <http://lappthebrand@gmail.com/> and get their 
voices heard <http://www.lappthebrand.com/blog/>. 

Yesterday, LAPP launched its second collection, Grab Back. The simple, slouchy 
yet sexy cotton hoodies come in black, grey and pink with the text: “THIS P***Y 
GRABS BACK” printed across the chest, as a direct condemnation of everything 
Donald Trump stands for. Although it may seem hypocritical that she has walked 
in the Victoria Secret fashion show for two years in a row, as a young black 
woman from south London’s Tooting in the white modelling industry, she wants 
marginalised groups to know how it feels to have a space in the mainstream.

Anderson added: “It’s important for women to feel as though they can be heard. 
We are often silenced or made to shrink ourselves to be accepted.”

Without uttering a word, this unisex hoodie condemns the way marginalised 
groups are ostracised while looking pretty cool under a padded puffer, or a 
military coat.

This hoodie speaks for you.
