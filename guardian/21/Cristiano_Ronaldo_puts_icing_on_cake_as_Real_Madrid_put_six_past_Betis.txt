Real were missing their captain Sergio Ramos and the influential midfielders 
Luka Modric, Casemiro and James Rodríguez but raced into the lead in the fourth 
minute when Raphaël Varane nodded in Toni Kroos’s cross from a free-kick.

“The players are talented and intelligent, and they knew they had to begin the 
game in the way they did. When we play with that intensity from the start it’s 
very difficult for our opponents,” Zidane said.

“Now we have to remain consistent and this game was a great display, a 
reference point. It’s not easy to play like this away from home.”

The German international Kroos, who signed a new contract with the club until 
2022 on Wednesday, compensated for the absence of his usual midfield partners 
with a powerful display and also teed up Karim Benzema for Real’s second.

The Spain international Isco made the most of the opportunity his side’s 
injury crisis afforded him by scoring Real’s fourth and fifth goals either side 
of the break.

First he finished off a frenetic counterattack, tapping Pepe’s pass into the 
net after an arrowed cross from Cristiano Ronaldo, and just after the hour mark 
he sent a majestic curled effort into the far top corner.

“He played very well and I’m very happy with his goals and his overall work. 
I’m delighted with his display,” added Zidane.

“When you love football and you see your team score a goal like our fourth, 
with very few touches and with the speed of the transition, you just want to 
watch it again and enjoy it, and that’s what I’m going to do.”

The left-back Marcelo got on the scoresheet to mark his return from three 
weeks out through injury, and the talisman Ronaldo grabbed the final goal to 
round off a happy night for Real after a difficult month.
