At one level Tescoâ€™s decision to put a new price deal to dairy farmers (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/04/tesco-deal-dairy-farmers-milk-price-protests>
, 4 November) is welcome; at another it is a further step towards customer 
confusion and disappointment for farmers.

As former head of campaigns at Christian Aid in the 1990s I was involved in 
the development sector work on fair trade that led to the setting up of the 
Fairtrade Mark. Today you can walk into a UK supermarket and find products from 
the global south carrying the mark but no such scheme for UK/EU farmers exists.

Individual supermarkets are developing their own responses, when what is 
needed is a uniform scheme with all chains agreeing to stock fairly priced, UK 
farmer-friendly products carrying a clearly identifiable and universal 
certification label.

To achieve this either the Red Tractor Scheme needs to extend its scope to 
include the price paid to UK farmers or a new certification scheme is needed. 
Only then will a mass consumer-led campaign in support of a fair price for UK 
farmers be workable.
