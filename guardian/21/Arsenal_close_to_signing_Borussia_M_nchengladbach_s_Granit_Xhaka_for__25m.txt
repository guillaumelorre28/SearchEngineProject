Arsenal are close to securing the arrival of Granit Xhaka from Borussia 
Mönchengladbach <https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiamoenchengladbach> 
as their first major signing of the summer, with the Switzerland international 
having travelled to London to undertake a medical.

Negotiations with the Bundesliga club have been on-going over the last few 
weeks with Mönchengladbach having initially hoped to raise as much as £35m 
through the midfielder’s sale. A compromise has since been reached at what is 
believed to be an initial £25m, with further fees due in future dependent on 
honours and appearances.

The German club’s position has been rather undermined by the fact a £23m 
release clause in Xhaka’s current contract would have become active next year.

The 23-year-old, who made his name at FC Basel before moving to Germany four 
years ago, had indicated a desire to move to England with Arsenal looking to 
bolster their central midfield rankswith both Mikel Arteta

 and Mathieu Flamini to be released when their contracts expire at the Emirates 
Stadium this summer. The Swiss will undergo his medical at London Colney and 
finalise personal terms, with an announcement anticipated next week.

Xhaka had indicated he wanted his future clarified before the European 
Championship finals and was granted a standing ovation by Borussia’s supporters 
in his final appearance for the club, a 2-0 victory at Darmstadt which secured 
a fourth-placed finish, last week. The midfielder has been capped 40 times and 
will play against his parents’ homeland, Albania, in the opening group game. 
His older brother, Taulant Xhaka, will represent Albania.
