Summary

An absolutely elated Sydney Football Stadium as a stadium of Cronulla blue 
bursts into song. Smiles for Gallen, Ennis and friends. Luke Lewis with a wry 
smile, he was one of the best for the Sharks, perhaps behind Maloney who was 
almost a one-man tour de force.

But the Cowboys. What can you say about that! A spectacular first-half 
implosion from the Premiers. A litany of errors, some of the most baffling 
you’ll ever witness on a football field. Paul Green must have walked under a 
ladder dressed as a black cat with a spilt salt shaker to have copped that kind 
of a showing from his chargers.

An absolutely shattered Johnathan Thurston is asked his thoughts at full-time, 
and he’s ruefully succinct: “Very ordinary.”

“We just shot ourselves in the foot – if you complete at 60%, really, you’re 
kidding yourself. We blew it.”

Don’t detract from the Sharks, though. Strong work from Barba, Holmes and Bird 
meant they were a danger out wide, and the big men – especially Fifita and 
Gallen – were solid in the middle.

Was it a good enough showing to scare Melbourne or the Raiders?

Probably not. But now the fairytale – manufactured or otherwise – appears one 
step closer.

The Cronulla Sharks <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cronulla-sharks> will 
play in a Grand Final – their first in two decades, and are now just eighty 
minutes away from that elusive and fabled Premiership.

Bring. It. On.

Full-time: Cronulla Sharks 32-20 North Queensland Cowboys

80 min: There’s the whistle, there’s the siren. And it’s tears for Townsend, 
who’s simply overcome at the death.

Ennis has ended up clattered by Morgan on the last play, and some players look 
on in concern, but the veteran is back on his feet.

The Sharks mascots and fans break into pandemonium – Cronulla have knocked out 
the reigning Premiers and they’re through to the Grand Final!

Try! Cronulla Sharks 32-20 North Queensland Cowboys (Hess)

79 min: Well, they’re making all the running, but it really is too little too 
late. The Sharks haven’t taken their foot off, but the desperation of the 
Queenslanders is making this scoreboard almost lie as to how this game has 
unfolded.

Thurston with a hurried conversion attempt – he won’t want to see that again, 
a real shank. No extras.

78 min: Cheeky stuff from the crowd – they’re enjoying themselves even if the 
Cowboys are running in tries. They reckon they’re home, and they’re almost 
certainly right too.

They get the Viking clap going – take that Raiders fans.

I thought we’d have to wait for the A-League season to see that one come out, 
but league fans have claimed it as their own.

Try! Cronulla Sharks 32-16 North Queensland Cowboys (Feldt)

75 min: Taumololo charges about 10m out. Thurston finds Morgan, who has Coote 
running an inside line, but the Sharks keep him at bay.

Thurston kicks crossfield, looking for Feldt and the winger with the colossal 
leap is too strong for Feki.

A great curling kick from Thurston, and he makes it a six pointer. Just for 
pride, and even if he looks shattered out there, he won’t quit, the veteran 
champion.

73 min: Another wave of Cronulla attack, and another young Shark puts JT on 
his backside in the tackle. A torrid night for the veteran.

Luke Lewis about 5m out. They spin to the right, as Bird probes. A kick is put 
through for Townsend – he looks for the regather! But can’t ground it.

Seven tackles for the Cowboys. And a penalty to boot.

Try! Cronulla Sharks 32-10 North Queensland Cowboys (Feldt)

72 min: Well, a great moment of individual skill from Feldt, with a seeming 
wall of light blue defenders in front of him, he wriggles and stretches and 
plants an arm through the thicket to cross the try line.

JT from the touchline – he’s copping the razz from the home fans, and it’s not 
his best to be fair. Not much more than a consolation, that try, surely.

69 min: Granville scampers from dummy half, some of them are still trying, but 
you can’t help but feel the reaper of grim, grim darkness just hovers above 
some of the Cowboys players.

A small slice of fortune, Feki is tested with a highball but seems to twist an 
ankle, or cramp as he takes it – gets in a horrible knot, and puts it down. 
What can the Cowboys make of it?

Try! Cronulla Sharks 32-6 North Queensland Cowboys (Maloney)

67 min: Unbelievable! The Cowboys try a short kickoff – not sure if it goes 
the ten, but they regather. But then on about the second play they chance a 
pass, and who should pop up by James Maloney. A terrific intercept, and with 
Cowboys players swarming all around him, the former Roster just cuts a path 
through them all!

Decent attempt with the boot, but the attempt hits the upright. Seems he’s 
human after all. What a night Maloney’s having.

63 min: They kick for touch, but a sloppy set piece from the Sharks. A bit too 
intricate there.

Confusion here, Bukuya’s lost the ball in the play-the-ball, but not sure if 
the two referees have blown opposite ways? Thurston’s blown up here – almost 
certainly from his own frustration. He’ll have to be careful, the mics pick up 
his conversation with the ref, and it’s colourful to say the least.

60 min: Fifita with another barnstorming carry, but just as it opens for them 
a poor pass bounces off the shoulder of Graham. What can the Cowboys muster? A 
long range kick.

Barba regathers well and beats the chaser, Thurston. Now Asiata penalised for 
man-handling Ennis at the play-the-ball.

57 min: Maloney with a perfectly weighted kick to split the Cowboys back two. 
Good pressure on the Cowboys, but they’ve been penalised for inside ten, and a 
reliefing kick to touch.

Taumololo brings it to the 30m line. Thurston looks around, nothing happening. 
Morgan with a chipped effort, but it’s not flash. Feldt tries to bat it 
backwards but almost puts it on a plate for a 90m.

Thurston penalised for stripping the ball; nothing going right for this great, 
great champion of rugby league tonight.

Try! Cronulla Sharks 26-6 North Queensland Cowboys (Coote)

56 min: Would you believe that! Maloney’s got three players hanging on him, he 
appears for all money held up short, and he wriggles, and writhes, and as the 
tackle never seems to end, he just gets it down!

Coote, almost as an afterthought, tries to stop the grounding. Too late.

The tryscorer converts his own try. 2 more points.

54 min: 36,000+ inside the stadium tonight – pretty good turnout for the 
Sharks. Maybe they are, just now starting to wonder #WhyNotUs?

Barba jinks from almost a standing start and beats his immediate marker. 
Maloney stretches and pushes.. He’s held short. Surely. Or wait..

Try! Cronulla Sharks 20-6 North Queensland Cowboys (Lewis)

52 min: North Queensland forced to defend again. Cronulla probe left, they 
probe right. Ennis delays the pass to Townsend, and as Lewis cuts a run that 
looks like a decoy, the halfback puts a super ball on his chest, and this time, 
the veteran does bundle over!

Great move from the Sharks, and Maloney makes it a six-pointer with a fine 
kick right over the dot.

47 min: Cripes, Maloney’s good at those – Bowen catches about 50cm into the 
field of play, but is tackled in-goal, and the Sharks get a repeat six from the 
drop out.

Cronulla elect not to kick, but go through the hands. A lovely bit of play 
that ends with the veteran Lewis, almost in a hole about 5m out. Just for a 
whisper it looked like the former Panther was through, but great scrambling 
defence shuts him down just as he was looking for an offload. Turnover.

44 min: Cronulla with it as they bring out from their own line. Strong running 
from Leutele and a tidy enough kick to end the set.

Granville with a good dart from dummy half. Thurston drives a kick into the 
shins of Feki who traps the ball like a veteran centre back in the soccer days 
of yore.

Lewis with a good offload and Cronulla keep the ball alive. Leutele again 
prominent, before Bowen climbs well to defuse an inch-perfect bomb.

Try! Cronulla Sharks 14-6 North Queensland Cowboys (Coote)

42 min: North Queensland progress steadily, before Bolton is pulled down about 
a metre out. They go left, and Thurston looks for a grubber. It’s not great to 
be honest, but it rebounds of a leg and sits up awkwardly for Townsend, who’s 
stripped by Coote in a one-on-one tackle, and Coote crosses.

No mistake from Thurston from about 10m to the left of the uprights.

A touch of fortune there for North Queensland, and haven’t we got a game on 
now!

Second half: Cronulla Sharks 14-0 North Queensland Cowboys

40 min: And we’re back! Cowboys kick off. Good metres from Heighington, before 
Ennis drills a regulation kick down to Ponga. The youngster regathers about 20m 
out.

Penalty to the Cowboys, as Bowen looks to get caught in a ‘crusher’ tackle.

I’m still rubbing my eyes over that one. And to think, with two tries 
disallowed/butchered, the Sharks could have been another twelve points up.

Is that the message from Paul Green – boys; we could have been dead and 
buried, but we’re not. Forget that forty, we’ve got same again to salvage some 
pride?

Some footage of Mick Ennis inside the Cronulla dressing room just absolutely 
laying it down to his teammates. Cut out the expletives and I imagine that was 
something like “well met, fellows, let us not become complacent”.

Half-time: Cronulla Sharks 14-0 North Queensland Cowboys

That’s enough, says the siren.

Gee whiz. I really can’t think of a worse half of football played by the 
Cowboys this season. And in a preliminary final!

The Sharks good enough value for their lead – but they haven’t really done 
anything too extraordinary.

Go grab a cuppa or splash some cold water in your face. What did you make of 
that curious, curious forty minutes of footy?

38 min: Morgan with a massive kick, but a barnstorming run from Holmes puts JT 
on his backside with a really strong return run. Huge impact!

Sharks are having a red hot go at this, Maloney goes to the air put JT cleans 
up. He’s surrounded by chasers and carried dead.

Try! Cronulla Sharks 14-0 North Queensland Cowboys (Townsend)

35 min: A huge offload from Heighington and Maloney finds a gap. He burst 
through and looks for a man inside – he finds Townsend – surely a forward pass!

But Gerard Sutton’s had no hesitation and blown a try! Well, you wouldn’t want 
to try a call like that in Queensland, but this local crowd seems to have 
enjoyed it.

9 times out of 10; 99 out of 100, surely that’s called forward??

Maloney doesn’t mind, and he calmly slots the extras from dead in front.

32 min: Barba down in backplay, we’ll monitor that. A lost ball – was it 
stripped, was it lost cold by Cronulla? Referee opts with the Cowboys, and now 
they’ve got a penalty.

They take the tap about 20m out. JT goes left. Good carry from Hess, he’s only 
about 6m out. A lose pass and momentum is lost, they regress over a tackle or 
two. JT tries a grubber on the sixth, but doesn’t even make the in-goal. Ennis 
there to clean up.

Barba rejoins gingerly, but he’s not moving too comfortably.

28 min: I’ve always rated Coote, but between this start and the game against 
the Broncos, gee whiz. Sharks are just peppering with the sixth tackle high 
balls, but to his credit, Coote’s nailed this one under heavy pressure.

That one’s caught in-goal, so the Cowboys can have a proper six.

Good carry up field, and a difficult kick from JT. Now it’s the Sharks pinned 
in their own in-goal, and Townsend cleans up from a Holmes spill in the tackle.

Six now for North Queensland. Their first real look at the Sharks’ line.

Penalty! Cronulla Sharks 8-0 North Queensland Cowboys

26 min: Good grief. Cowboys are having a genuine ‘mare here – Kyle Feldt with 
the in-goal restart – and he’s put it into touch!

The crowd can’t believe this – who are you, and what have you done with the 
reigning Premiers?!

Maloney opts for a shot at goal, and this time it’s on target. An extra two 
for the Sharks.

25 min: Taumololo lines up Gallen, some big impacts here. Cronulla go to the 
air, a booming, swirling high ball, and Coote’s received it a metre inside the 
field of play, and then been absolutely nailed into his own in-goal.

Line drop out – another set of six.

Try! Cronulla Sharks 6-0 North Queensland Cowboys (Feki)

22 min: Well, look. This scrambling defence could only take so much. Cronulla 
throw it left, Fifita with another key offload, they go through the hands, and 
it’s Sosaia Feki in the corner. Great work, he still had two to beat but the 
winger stayed in touch.

No extras from the sideline, as Maloney misses with the boot.

19 min: Speak to soon – Coote looks for a booming kick and puts it over the 
dead ball line. Mistake that, and Cronulla have seven tackles.

Gallen with some barge, good yards from the skipper. They spin to the right, 
but Bird is wrapped up. Through the hands to the right and Barba joins in, but 
decent sliding cover from the Cowboys. Fifita hit’s the line, he’s got them 
worried, has Fifita.

Ennis tries a grubber from about 3m out, it strikes the legs of a Cowboys 
player, and referee Cummins adjudges that Scott has knocked on. Six more 
Cronulla!

Penalty! Cronulla Sharks 2-0 North Queensland Cowboys

17 min: After all that, finally some scoreboard action – is that a letoff of a 
blow to the Cowboys? They were on the ropes for so long there you’d imagine 
they’d be stoked with just copping two.

They restart a swirling, curling effort – it appears conditions are wreaking a 
bit of havoc out there – at least we’ll give Coote and JT’s various errors the 
benefit of the doubt – and Barba does well.

Cronulla complete the six, and this resumes as a traditional game of rugby 
league after that frankly bizarre first fifteen minutes.

15 min: Has someone slipped something in JT’s mash? Bizarre last play pass 
from Thurston and he’s just lobbed it forward! Did it slip as he played? That 
looked horrid, and it’s a turnover.

Cronulla with a chance to continue the pressure – Cowboys are on the back foot 
and they’re eventually penalised. And after all this, Maloney elects to take a 
shot at some points.

14 min: This time Cronulla spin to test the Cowboys right-edge defence. Ennis 
eventually tries the grubber, but under pressure from Morgan he’s not 
connected. Finally a scrum for North Queensland, and a chance to build a proper 
set.

 13 min: The Sharks probe, Taumololo with a crucial tackle. Not enough 
innovation here, as they eventually go to the toe. Coote takes dead, and 
they’ve earned a third repeat set of six. Excruciating pressure here.

duffed a routine play the ball; and they’re back on the defensive. Young Bowen 
with a harrowing simple mistake – and the Sharks have six good long looks at 
the Cowboy’s line.

9 min: Well, it’s all up the Cowboys end. They defend another six from the 
Sharks, and try to bring their way out.

JT throws it early, and Townsend almost intercepts. He knocks it to ground, 
and North Queensland get a respite.

Chance to breathe and regather, what can they come up with.

No try! Cronulla Sharks 0-0 North Queensland Cowboys

7 min: The Coote horror show continues! Cronulla kick to the ingoal, and Coote 
waits for it go dead; but it just won’t! Townsend races through and grounds, 
and Cronulla think they’ve got a try.

We got upstairs, but Townsend hasn’t got any downward pressure on it! Well, 
here’s a let off. How have the Cowboys not conceded?

7 min: Nothing flash, that six from the Sharks, but now we have a handling 
error from the Cowboys, again it’s JT whose pass goes behind the runner. It is 
ALL happening on the mistake front here from the Cowboys. A real nervy start, 
this.

No try! Cronulla Sharks 0-0 North Queensland Cowboys

5 min: Well, the crowd explodes as Andrew Fifita bashes his way through, and 
claims a try – but video ref says, no dice!

Fifita accused of a double movement. Gallen’s not happy, but that’s that.

Well, this is a bizarre start – Thurston has kicked to touch from the restart, 
and not found it! Sharks regather and attack the line again.

4 min: The Sharks sniff left, they sniff right. A great passage gets Ennis 
about 3m out and he’s in a one-on-one. All he has to do is beat his man, and 
he’s through – but phenomenal ball and all bear hug from Matt Scott! Great 
stuff from the skipper.

Cowboys hang on, and Maloney tries a grubber to the corner. Repeat six – it’s 
a line drop out.

3 min: Deary, deary me. Well, Flanagan said they’d go after him, but Coote’s 
having another early game shocker! Cronulla kick to the former Panther, and 
he’s dropped it cold, with nobody within 20 metres.

Huge opportunity, as the Sharks get a full set of six, well into the danger 
zone.

Pffffft! First-half

1 min: Cowboys receive and skipper Scott is tackled about 5m out from his own 
line. Taumololo with some big early metres. Nth Qld go through the hands early 
and Bowen gets some good metres. First kick from Coote is a bit shanky, but 
Cowboys retrieve and kick again. Barba defuses about 10m out from the Sharks 
line.

It’s definitely not a mixed crowd – the players are entering the field of 
play, JT leads out the Cowboys to a chorus of boos; Gallen brings out his 
Sharks to rapturous applause.

It’s a sea of blue, well, BW&B, in the crowd, as you’d expect – as both sets 
of players mark a minute’s silence for the great, late Ron Massey.

Lovely video tribute, and impeccably observed by the fans.

We talk about experience when it comes to finals and with these two sets of 
heads, there’s surely a few to choose from. Gallen and Ennis have over 550NRL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> games between them, and Thurston is not 
too far from 300 games himself.

At the other scale of things though there’s some pretty green lads out there. 
Bowen and Hess have less than 10 games each to their name, and young Ponga 
makes just his second start. No pressure, kid.

Capewell for the Sharkies has just three showings. Could any of these be weak 
spots? Or will they play with the abandon of kids who’ve never felt the pain of 
a finals loss?

Popular consensus seems to suggest the Cowboys should have enough ‘big game 
experience’ in key positions to edge this – but can you rule out the Sharks, in 
Sydney?

Send us your predictions, boasts, insights – I promise I won’t hold these as 
blackmail should the game take a different direction.

10.44am BST 10:44  <> 

We’re not too far away from kickoff as the players take to the  hallowed  
well, existing, grass of the Sydney Football Stadium for final warm ups.

Some team news:

Cronulla –

Ben Barba, Sosaia Feki, Jack Bird, Ricky Leutele, Valentine Holmes, James 
Maloney, Chad Townsend, Andrew Fifita, Michael Ennis, Matt Prior, Luke Lewis, 
Wade Graham, Paul Gallen (c)

Interchange: Gerard Beale, Chris Heighington, Kurt Capewell, Jason Bukuya

So, disregard that Tagataese tease, the big man’s not made the interchange 
bench as pre-promised. How crucial could that prove for Cronulla? Having Gallen 
and Graham fit to start though cannot be understated.

Cowboys –

Lachlan Coote, Kyle Feldt, Justin O’Neill, Javid Bowen, Kalyn Ponga, Michael 
Morgan, Johnathan Thurston (c), Matt Scott (c), Jake Granville, James Tamou, 
Gavin Cooper, Coen Hess, Jason Taumalolo

Interchange: Rory Kostjasyn, John Asiata, Scott Bolton, Ben Hannant

No Kyle Linnett, as discussed, but a massive opportunity for younster Ponga. 
He put in a pretty tidy shift against the Broncos, but watch to see if the 
Sharks halves target him early on.

Hihi. Hope this finds you well, from wherever it is you’re following the 
coverage.

Are you stuck in the field in outer Baku, or Timbukbu, frantically waving your 
Nokia 3210 around for reception to follow the coverage? Drop us a line – either 
at @rrjparkin or richard.parkin.casual@theguardian.co.uk – we’d love to hear 
from you.

Massive night and a massive game – feel free to shave #WhyNotUs into the back 
of your colleague’s head as he/she sits slumped over their desk at work. Photos 
welcome.

Preamble

Moving past the burning issue of whether the games immediately before a Grand 
Final should mandatorily be called semi-finals, the simple fact remains – 
whoever wins this eighty minutes of fast, frantic and frame-shuddering footy 
will be playing in the Big One.

In Cronulla’s case, we’ve been bombarded with this narrative of a 49-year wait 
for a premiership and #WhyNotUs. Are you sick of it yet? The spin doctors at 
Cowboys presumably decided against countering this with their own situation: 
#355DayDrought perhaps doesn’t quite have the same ring.

On the field, the Sharks have had a scratchy finish to the season, notching 
loses to the Storm, Rabbitohs, St George (need I go on?) – but the only result 
they’ll worry about is the close-fought win over the Raiders that earned them a 
week off, thus allowing skipper Paul Gallen to mend his back, stand-in skipper 
Wade Graham to fix his head, and Sam Tagataese to cure his shoulder – huge 
additions in a battle where they’ll need every man at his best.

Kane Linnett has reportedly not made it back for the Cowboys, but while it’s a 
team game, you can’t help but think the players that will really matter tonight 
will be called JT.

Just to hedge your bets though, there’s two to choose from – mercurial 
halfback Johnathan Thurston OR the week-on-week reputation-enhancing one-man 
demolition squad Jason Taumalolo. If he doesn’t have some good ol’ whacks at 
Gallen or Andrew Fifita then rugby league is broken.

Shane Flanagan tried to get the mind games going during the week by suggesting 
the Sharks would target Cowboys fullback Lachlan Coote after his underwhelming 
show against the Broncos. Paul Green took no backward steps in pointing out 
that it’s Cronulla’s halfback Chad Townsend – hooked during the first half 
against the Raiders – who will really be feeling the pressure.

It’s been a pretty even recent history shared between the two sides, although 
Moore Park has been a bit of a haunted house for the Cowboys in recent time.

It’s finely balanced, you’d suggest, and a large parochial crowd all furiously 
baying “#WhyNotUs” could just prove the difference. Game on.

An absolutely elated Sydney Football Stadium as a stadium of Cronulla blue 
bursts into song. Smiles for Gallen, Ennis and friends. Luke Lewis with a wry 
smile, he was one of the best for the Sharks, perhaps behind Maloney who was 
almost a one-man tour de force.

But the Cowboys. What can you say about that! A spectacular first-half 
implosion from the Premiers. A litany of errors, some of the most baffling 
you’ll ever witness on a football field. Paul Green must have walked under a 
ladder dressed as a black cat with a spilt salt shaker to have copped that kind 
of a showing from his chargers.

An absolutely shattered Johnathan Thurston is asked his thoughts at full-time, 
and he’s ruefully succinct: “Very ordinary.”

“We just shot ourselves in the foot – if you complete at 60%, really, you’re 
kidding yourself. We blew it.”

Don’t detract from the Sharks, though. Strong work from Barba, Holmes and Bird 
meant they were a danger out wide, and the big men – especially Fifita and 
Gallen – were solid in the middle.

Was it a good enough showing to scare Melbourne or the Raiders?

Probably not. But now the fairytale – manufactured or otherwise – appears one 
step closer.

The Cronulla Sharks <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cronulla-sharks> will 
play in a Grand Final – their first in two decades, and are now just eighty 
minutes away from that elusive and fabled Premiership.

Bring. It. On.
 
80 min: There’s the whistle, there’s the siren. And it’s tears for Townsend, 
who’s simply overcome at the death.

Ennis has ended up clattered by Morgan on the last play, and some players look 
on in concern, but the veteran is back on his feet.

The Sharks mascots and fans break into pandemonium – Cronulla have knocked out 
the reigning Premiers and they’re through to the Grand Final!
 
79 min: Well, they’re making all the running, but it really is too little too 
late. The Sharks haven’t taken their foot off, but the desperation of the 
Queenslanders is making this scoreboard almost lie as to how this game has 
unfolded.

Thurston with a hurried conversion attempt – he won’t want to see that again, 
a real shank. No extras.
 
78 min: Cheeky stuff from the crowd – they’re enjoying themselves even if the 
Cowboys are running in tries. They reckon they’re home, and they’re almost 
certainly right too.

They get the Viking clap going – take that Raiders fans.

I thought we’d have to wait for the A-League season to see that one come out, 
but league fans have claimed it as their own.
 
75 min: Taumololo charges about 10m out. Thurston finds Morgan, who has Coote 
running an inside line, but the Sharks keep him at bay.

Thurston kicks crossfield, looking for Feldt and the winger with the colossal 
leap is too strong for Feki.

A great curling kick from Thurston, and he makes it a six pointer. Just for 
pride, and even if he looks shattered out there, he won’t quit, the veteran 
champion.
 
73 min: Another wave of Cronulla attack, and another young Shark puts JT on 
his backside in the tackle. A torrid night for the veteran.

Luke Lewis about 5m out. They spin to the right, as Bird probes. A kick is put 
through for Townsend – he looks for the regather! But can’t ground it.

Seven tackles for the Cowboys. And a penalty to boot.
 
72 min: Well, a great moment of individual skill from Feldt, with a seeming 
wall of light blue defenders in front of him, he wriggles and stretches and 
plants an arm through the thicket to cross the try line.

JT from the touchline – he’s copping the razz from the home fans, and it’s not 
his best to be fair. Not much more than a consolation, that try, surely.
 
69 min: Granville scampers from dummy half, some of them are still trying, but 
you can’t help but feel the reaper of grim, grim darkness just hovers above 
some of the Cowboys players.

A small slice of fortune, Feki is tested with a highball but seems to twist an 
ankle, or cramp as he takes it – gets in a horrible knot, and puts it down. 
What can the Cowboys make of it?
 
67 min: Unbelievable! The Cowboys try a short kickoff – not sure if it goes 
the ten, but they regather. But then on about the second play they chance a 
pass, and who should pop up by James Maloney. A terrific intercept, and with 
Cowboys players swarming all around him, the former Roster just cuts a path 
through them all!

Decent attempt with the boot, but the attempt hits the upright. Seems he’s 
human after all. What a night Maloney’s having.
 
64 min: Either way, Maloney takes the shot, and makes no mistake.

JT is boiling. Nothing’s falling for the Cowboys.
 
63 min: They kick for touch, but a sloppy set piece from the Sharks. A bit too 
intricate there.

Confusion here, Bukuya’s lost the ball in the play-the-ball, but not sure if 
the two referees have blown opposite ways? Thurston’s blown up here – almost 
certainly from his own frustration. He’ll have to be careful, the mics pick up 
his conversation with the ref, and it’s colourful to say the least.
 
60 min: Fifita with another barnstorming carry, but just as it opens for them 
a poor pass bounces off the shoulder of Graham. What can the Cowboys muster? A 
long range kick.

Barba regathers well and beats the chaser, Thurston. Now Asiata penalised for 
man-handling Ennis at the play-the-ball.
 
57 min: Maloney with a perfectly weighted kick to split the Cowboys back two. 
Good pressure on the Cowboys, but they’ve been penalised for inside ten, and a 
reliefing kick to touch.

Taumololo brings it to the 30m line. Thurston looks around, nothing happening. 
Morgan with a chipped effort, but it’s not flash. Feldt tries to bat it 
backwards but almost puts it on a plate for a 90m.

Thurston penalised for stripping the ball; nothing going right for this great, 
great champion of rugby league tonight.
 
56 min: Would you believe that! Maloney’s got three players hanging on him, he 
appears for all money held up short, and he wriggles, and writhes, and as the 
tackle never seems to end, he just gets it down!

Coote, almost as an afterthought, tries to stop the grounding. Too late.

The tryscorer converts his own try. 2 more points.
 
54 min: 36,000+ inside the stadium tonight – pretty good turnout for the 
Sharks. Maybe they are, just now starting to wonder #WhyNotUs?

Barba jinks from almost a standing start and beats his immediate marker. 
Maloney stretches and pushes.. He’s held short. Surely. Or wait..
 
52 min: North Queensland forced to defend again. Cronulla probe left, they 
probe right. Ennis delays the pass to Townsend, and as Lewis cuts a run that 
looks like a decoy, the halfback puts a super ball on his chest, and this time, 
the veteran does bundle over!

Great move from the Sharks, and Maloney makes it a six-pointer with a fine 
kick right over the dot.
 
50 min: Great run from Bukuya! He skips inside the markers and wrestles past 
about three players. Leutele looks to put Holmes in in the corner, but Morgan 
knocks the ball to ground.

Six again, Sharks!
 
47 min: Cripes, Maloney’s good at those – Bowen catches about 50cm into the 
field of play, but is tackled in-goal, and the Sharks get a repeat six from the 
drop out.

Cronulla elect not to kick, but go through the hands. A lovely bit of play 
that ends with the veteran Lewis, almost in a hole about 5m out. Just for a 
whisper it looked like the former Panther was through, but great scrambling 
defence shuts him down just as he was looking for an offload. Turnover.
 
44 min: Cronulla with it as they bring out from their own line. Strong running 
from Leutele and a tidy enough kick to end the set.

Granville with a good dart from dummy half. Thurston drives a kick into the 
shins of Feki who traps the ball like a veteran centre back in the soccer days 
of yore.

Lewis with a good offload and Cronulla keep the ball alive. Leutele again 
prominent, before Bowen climbs well to defuse an inch-perfect bomb.
 
42 min: North Queensland progress steadily, before Bolton is pulled down about 
a metre out. They go left, and Thurston looks for a grubber. It’s not great to 
be honest, but it rebounds of a leg and sits up awkwardly for Townsend, who’s 
stripped by Coote in a one-on-one tackle, and Coote crosses.

No mistake from Thurston from about 10m to the left of the uprights.

A touch of fortune there for North Queensland, and haven’t we got a game on 
now!
 
40 min: And we’re back! Cowboys kick off. Good metres from Heighington, before 
Ennis drills a regulation kick down to Ponga. The youngster regathers about 20m 
out.

Penalty to the Cowboys, as Bowen looks to get caught in a ‘crusher’ tackle.
 
I’m still rubbing my eyes over that one. And to think, with two tries 
disallowed/butchered, the Sharks could have been another twelve points up.

Is that the message from Paul Green – boys; we could have been dead and 
buried, but we’re not. Forget that forty, we’ve got same again to salvage some 
pride?

Some footage of Mick Ennis inside the Cronulla dressing room just absolutely 
laying it down to his teammates. Cut out the expletives and I imagine that was 
something like “well met, fellows, let us not become complacent”.
 
That’s enough, says the siren.

Gee whiz. I really can’t think of a worse half of football played by the 
Cowboys this season. And in a preliminary final!

The Sharks good enough value for their lead – but they haven’t really done 
anything too extraordinary.

Go grab a cuppa or splash some cold water in your face. What did you make of 
that curious, curious forty minutes of footy?
 
38 min: Morgan with a massive kick, but a barnstorming run from Holmes puts JT 
on his backside with a really strong return run. Huge impact!

Sharks are having a red hot go at this, Maloney goes to the air put JT cleans 
up. He’s surrounded by chasers and carried dead.
 
35 min: A huge offload from Heighington and Maloney finds a gap. He burst 
through and looks for a man inside – he finds Townsend – surely a forward pass!

But Gerard Sutton’s had no hesitation and blown a try! Well, you wouldn’t want 
to try a call like that in Queensland, but this local crowd seems to have 
enjoyed it.

9 times out of 10; 99 out of 100, surely that’s called forward??

Maloney doesn’t mind, and he calmly slots the extras from dead in front.
 
32 min: Barba down in backplay, we’ll monitor that. A lost ball – was it 
stripped, was it lost cold by Cronulla? Referee opts with the Cowboys, and now 
they’ve got a penalty.

They take the tap about 20m out. JT goes left. Good carry from Hess, he’s only 
about 6m out. A lose pass and momentum is lost, they regress over a tackle or 
two. JT tries a grubber on the sixth, but doesn’t even make the in-goal. Ennis 
there to clean up.

Barba rejoins gingerly, but he’s not moving too comfortably.
 
28 min: I’ve always rated Coote, but between this start and the game against 
the Broncos, gee whiz. Sharks are just peppering with the sixth tackle high 
balls, but to his credit, Coote’s nailed this one under heavy pressure.

That one’s caught in-goal, so the Cowboys can have a proper six.

Good carry up field, and a difficult kick from JT. Now it’s the Sharks pinned 
in their own in-goal, and Townsend cleans up from a Holmes spill in the tackle.

Six now for North Queensland. Their first real look at the Sharks’ line.
 
26 min: Good grief. Cowboys are having a genuine ‘mare here – Kyle Feldt with 
the in-goal restart – and he’s put it into touch!

The crowd can’t believe this – who are you, and what have you done with the 
reigning Premiers?!

Maloney opts for a shot at goal, and this time it’s on target. An extra two 
for the Sharks.
 
25 min: Taumololo lines up Gallen, some big impacts here. Cronulla go to the 
air, a booming, swirling high ball, and Coote’s received it a metre inside the 
field of play, and then been absolutely nailed into his own in-goal.

Line drop out – another set of six.
 
22 min: Well, look. This scrambling defence could only take so much. Cronulla 
throw it left, Fifita with another key offload, they go through the hands, and 
it’s Sosaia Feki in the corner. Great work, he still had two to beat but the 
winger stayed in touch.

No extras from the sideline, as Maloney misses with the boot.
 
19 min: Speak to soon – Coote looks for a booming kick and puts it over the 
dead ball line. Mistake that, and Cronulla have seven tackles.

Gallen with some barge, good yards from the skipper. They spin to the right, 
but Bird is wrapped up. Through the hands to the right and Barba joins in, but 
decent sliding cover from the Cowboys. Fifita hit’s the line, he’s got them 
worried, has Fifita.

Ennis tries a grubber from about 3m out, it strikes the legs of a Cowboys 
player, and referee Cummins adjudges that Scott has knocked on. Six more 
Cronulla!
 
17 min: After all that, finally some scoreboard action – is that a letoff of a 
blow to the Cowboys? They were on the ropes for so long there you’d imagine 
they’d be stoked with just copping two.

They restart a swirling, curling effort – it appears conditions are wreaking a 
bit of havoc out there – at least we’ll give Coote and JT’s various errors the 
benefit of the doubt – and Barba does well.

Cronulla complete the six, and this resumes as a traditional game of rugby 
league after that frankly bizarre first fifteen minutes.
 
15 min: Has someone slipped something in JT’s mash? Bizarre last play pass 
from Thurston and he’s just lobbed it forward! Did it slip as he played? That 
looked horrid, and it’s a turnover.

Cronulla with a chance to continue the pressure – Cowboys are on the back foot 
and they’re eventually penalised. And after all this, Maloney elects to take a 
shot at some points.
 
14 min: This time Cronulla spin to test the Cowboys right-edge defence. Ennis 
eventually tries the grubber, but under pressure from Morgan he’s not 
connected. Finally a scrum for North Queensland, and a chance to build a proper 
set.
 
 13 min: The Sharks probe, Taumololo with a crucial tackle. Not enough 
innovation here, as they eventually go to the toe. Coote takes dead, and 
they’ve earned a third repeat set of six. Excruciating pressure here.

 
11 min: Would you believe this! Early in the count the Cowboys have absolutely 
duffed a routine play the ball; and they’re back on the defensive. Young Bowen 
with a harrowing simple mistake – and the Sharks have six good long looks at 
the Cowboy’s line.
 
9 min: Well, it’s all up the Cowboys end. They defend another six from the 
Sharks, and try to bring their way out.

JT throws it early, and Townsend almost intercepts. He knocks it to ground, 
and North Queensland get a respite.

Chance to breathe and regather, what can they come up with.
 
7 min: The Coote horror show continues! Cronulla kick to the ingoal, and Coote 
waits for it go dead; but it just won’t! Townsend races through and grounds, 
and Cronulla think they’ve got a try.

We got upstairs, but Townsend hasn’t got any downward pressure on it! Well, 
here’s a let off. How have the Cowboys not conceded?
 
7 min: Nothing flash, that six from the Sharks, but now we have a handling 
error from the Cowboys, again it’s JT whose pass goes behind the runner. It is 
ALL happening on the mistake front here from the Cowboys. A real nervy start, 
this.
 
5 min: Well, the crowd explodes as Andrew Fifita bashes his way through, and 
claims a try – but video ref says, no dice!

Fifita accused of a double movement. Gallen’s not happy, but that’s that.

Well, this is a bizarre start – Thurston has kicked to touch from the restart, 
and not found it! Sharks regather and attack the line again.
 
4 min: The Sharks sniff left, they sniff right. A great passage gets Ennis 
about 3m out and he’s in a one-on-one. All he has to do is beat his man, and 
he’s through – but phenomenal ball and all bear hug from Matt Scott! Great 
stuff from the skipper.

Cowboys hang on, and Maloney tries a grubber to the corner. Repeat six – it’s 
a line drop out.
 
3 min: Deary, deary me. Well, Flanagan said they’d go after him, but Coote’s 
having another early game shocker! Cronulla kick to the former Panther, and 
he’s dropped it cold, with nobody within 20 metres.

Huge opportunity, as the Sharks get a full set of six, well into the danger 
zone.
 
1 min: Cowboys receive and skipper Scott is tackled about 5m out from his own 
line. Taumololo with some big early metres. Nth Qld go through the hands early 
and Bowen gets some good metres. First kick from Coote is a bit shanky, but 
Cowboys retrieve and kick again. Barba defuses about 10m out from the Sharks 
line.
 
It’s definitely not a mixed crowd – the players are entering the field of 
play, JT leads out the Cowboys to a chorus of boos; Gallen brings out his 
Sharks to rapturous applause.

It’s a sea of blue, well, BW&B, in the crowd, as you’d expect – as both sets 
of players mark a minute’s silence for the great, late Ron Massey.

Lovely video tribute, and impeccably observed by the fans.
 
First blood, Sharks.

Incidentally, your referee tonight is Ben Cummins, with Gerard Sutton on the 
plastic backup whistle.
 
We talk about experience when it comes to finals and with these two sets of 
heads, there’s surely a few to choose from. Gallen and Ennis have over 550NRL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> games between them, and Thurston is not 
too far from 300 games himself.

At the other scale of things though there’s some pretty green lads out there. 
Bowen and Hess have less than 10 games each to their name, and young Ponga 
makes just his second start. No pressure, kid.

Capewell for the Sharkies has just three showings. Could any of these be weak 
spots? Or will they play with the abandon of kids who’ve never felt the pain of 
a finals loss?

Popular consensus seems to suggest the Cowboys should have enough ‘big game 
experience’ in key positions to edge this – but can you rule out the Sharks, in 
Sydney?

Send us your predictions, boasts, insights – I promise I won’t hold these as 
blackmail should the game take a different direction.
 
We’re not too far away from kickoff as the players take to the  hallowed  
well, existing, grass of the Sydney Football Stadium for final warm ups.

Some team news:

Cronulla –

Ben Barba, Sosaia Feki, Jack Bird, Ricky Leutele, Valentine Holmes, James 
Maloney, Chad Townsend, Andrew Fifita, Michael Ennis, Matt Prior, Luke Lewis, 
Wade Graham, Paul Gallen (c)

Interchange: Gerard Beale, Chris Heighington, Kurt Capewell, Jason Bukuya

So, disregard that Tagataese tease, the big man’s not made the interchange 
bench as pre-promised. How crucial could that prove for Cronulla? Having Gallen 
and Graham fit to start though cannot be understated.

Cowboys –

Lachlan Coote, Kyle Feldt, Justin O’Neill, Javid Bowen, Kalyn Ponga, Michael 
Morgan, Johnathan Thurston (c), Matt Scott (c), Jake Granville, James Tamou, 
Gavin Cooper, Coen Hess, Jason Taumalolo

Interchange: Rory Kostjasyn, John Asiata, Scott Bolton, Ben Hannant

No Kyle Linnett, as discussed, but a massive opportunity for younster Ponga. 
He put in a pretty tidy shift against the Broncos, but watch to see if the 
Sharks halves target him early on.
 
Hihi. Hope this finds you well, from wherever it is you’re following the 
coverage.

Are you stuck in the field in outer Baku, or Timbukbu, frantically waving your 
Nokia 3210 around for reception to follow the coverage? Drop us a line – either 
at @rrjparkin or richard.parkin.casual@theguardian.co.uk – we’d love to hear 
from you.

Massive night and a massive game – feel free to shave #WhyNotUs into the back 
of your colleague’s head as he/she sits slumped over their desk at work. Photos 
welcome.
 
Moving past the burning issue of whether the games immediately before a Grand 
Final should mandatorily be called semi-finals, the simple fact remains – 
whoever wins this eighty minutes of fast, frantic and frame-shuddering footy 
will be playing in the Big One.

In Cronulla’s case, we’ve been bombarded with this narrative of a 49-year wait 
for a premiership and #WhyNotUs. Are you sick of it yet? The spin doctors at 
Cowboys presumably decided against countering this with their own situation: 
#355DayDrought perhaps doesn’t quite have the same ring.

On the field, the Sharks have had a scratchy finish to the season, notching 
loses to the Storm, Rabbitohs, St George (need I go on?) – but the only result 
they’ll worry about is the close-fought win over the Raiders that earned them a 
week off, thus allowing skipper Paul Gallen to mend his back, stand-in skipper 
Wade Graham to fix his head, and Sam Tagataese to cure his shoulder – huge 
additions in a battle where they’ll need every man at his best.

Kane Linnett has reportedly not made it back for the Cowboys, but while it’s a 
team game, you can’t help but think the players that will really matter tonight 
will be called JT.

Just to hedge your bets though, there’s two to choose from – mercurial 
halfback Johnathan Thurston OR the week-on-week reputation-enhancing one-man 
demolition squad Jason Taumalolo. If he doesn’t have some good ol’ whacks at 
Gallen or Andrew Fifita then rugby league is broken.

Shane Flanagan tried to get the mind games going during the week by suggesting 
the Sharks would target Cowboys fullback Lachlan Coote after his underwhelming 
show against the Broncos. Paul Green took no backward steps in pointing out 
that it’s Cronulla’s halfback Chad Townsend – hooked during the first half 
against the Raiders – who will really be feeling the pressure.

It’s been a pretty even recent history shared between the two sides, although 
Moore Park has been a bit of a haunted house for the Cowboys in recent time.

It’s finely balanced, you’d suggest, and a large parochial crowd all furiously 
baying “#WhyNotUs” could just prove the difference. Game on.
 
Richard will be here shortly to take you through tonight’s match. In the 
meanwhile, here’s a nice little piece from Sam Perry about last week’s cracking 
semi-finals.
