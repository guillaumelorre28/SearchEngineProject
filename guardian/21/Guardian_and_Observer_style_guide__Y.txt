 Y - style guide illustrations Photograph: Jakob Hinrichs 
y or ie?
As a general rule: -y is an English suffix, whose function is to create an 
adjective (usually from a noun, eg creamy); -ie was originally a Scottish 
suffix, whose function is to add the meaning of "diminutive" (usually from a 
noun, eg beastie).

So in most cases, where there is dispute over whether a noun takes a -y or an 
-ie ending, the correct answer is -ie: she's a girly girl, but she's no 
helpless girlie. Think also scrunchie, beanie, nightie, meanie ... There are 
exceptions (a hippy, an indie band), but where specific examples are not given, 
use -ie for nouns and -y for adjectives

year
write 2012, not "the year 2012"; for a span of years use hyphen thus: 2011-12, 
not 2011/12. If you need to say it aloud – for example, in a podcast – say 
"twenty-twelve" not "two thousand and twelve"

yes campaign, no campaign
not Yes or "yes" campaign.

The yes campaign, or yes campaigners, campaign for a yes vote; the no campaign 
campaigns for a no vote. Don't say "no campaigners" or "no vote campaigners" as 
this can be ambiguous

yesterday
Give some thought to where you place the time element in a story: do not 
automatically put it at the start ("David Cameron yesterday insisted ... "), a 
style satirised by the subeditor turned bestselling author Bill Bryson, who 
wrote: "Anyone not acquainted with journalists could be forgiven for assuming 
that they must talk something like this: I last night went to bed early because 
I this morning had to catch an early flight."

Constructions such as "the two sides were today to consider", as we have been 
known to say, sound ugly and artificial. As with headlines, try reading out 
loud to find the most natural arrangement.

Remember that we have millions of readers in different time zones around the 
world, for whom yesterday, today and tomorrow will not necessarily mean the 
same thing. Terms such as yesterday, today, tonight and tomorrow should not be 
used on the website: if you need to specify, say "on Wednesday", etc.

"Yesterday" remains appropriate for some newspaper stories, which are most 
likely to be read in the UK first thing in the morning, but not for the 
website, which may be read at any time, anywhere in the world
