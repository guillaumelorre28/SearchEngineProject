Carl Froch <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/carl-froch> is hopeful of 
securing a showdown with Julio César Chávez Jr in Las Vegas next year after 
revealing that his promoter, Eddie Hearn, is to hold talks this week.

The IBF and WBA super-middleweight champion has not fought since beating 
George Groves at Wembley Stadium in May and had been due to face the mandatory 
challenger James De Gale next. However, despite being labelled “a coward” by 
DeGale after his victory over Marco Antonio Periban on Saturday, the 
37-year-old Froch is willing to vacate his IBF title in order to set up a bout 
with Chávez of Mexico.

“Eddie Hearn is getting on a plane, I don’t know whether that is tomorrow or 
Wednesday, and he’s got a very important meeting with a guy called Al Haymon 
and hopefully there is going to be some news soon,” Froch, who has never fought 
in Vegas,told Talksport <>. “He is now looking after Chávez Jr and apparently 
he is not under that contract [with Top Rank] any more. If that is the case and 
he is a free agent, then there is no reason that fight can’t happen early next 
year, maybe March or April.”

Froch added: “I would fight James DeGale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jamesdegale> if that warranted going to 
Vegas. Unfortunately, it would be at the O2 in [London] England and I have done 
it, I have been there. At 37, I think I should be entitled to say: ‘I fancy Las 
Vegas’.”
