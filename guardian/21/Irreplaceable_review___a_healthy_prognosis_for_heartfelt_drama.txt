Jean-Pierre (François Cluzet), a doctor in rural France, is forced to concede 
that he needs help after he is diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour. 
However, despite his resistance to the idea of relinquishing control, he finds 
himself warming to the new doctor, Nathalie (Marianne Denicourt). The chemistry 
between Cluzet and Denicourt is the element that elevates this workmanlike and 
slightly episodic portrait of the day-to-day grind of life in a country medical 
practice. There are a couple of moments that feel a little overwritten – 
Jean-Pierre launches into a Herzogian rant about the barbarity of nature over 
his morning coffee – but mostly, this is a persuasively low-key drama featuring 
substantial, complex central characters.
