Yann M'Vila has revealed the chance to work with Arsène Wenger could give 
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> the edge over other 
potential suitors in the chase for the France international's signature.

M'Vila was reportedly watched by Arsenal scouts during Rennes' Ligue 1 draw 
with Lyon on Sunday, and Wenger will be encouraged by the 21-year-old 
midfielder's admission that it would be difficult to turn down a club managed 
by a Frenchman.

"Inter, Arsenal, Real ... I will take the fun everywhere!" M'Vila told Canal+. 
"These are great clubs. If the coach calls you and tells you he wants you to 
make you play, especially a French coach, it changes everything. The important 
thing for me is getting playing time for the France team."

M'Vila has three years remaining on his current deal, but Rennes are resigned 
to losing their star player at the end of the season, having rebuffed interest 
from Wenger last summer. "Yann M'Vila won't be aRennes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rennes> player next season," the manager, 
Frédéric Antonetti, said last month.

Rennes would seek a fee of around £20m, which would force Arsenal to break 
their transfer record.
