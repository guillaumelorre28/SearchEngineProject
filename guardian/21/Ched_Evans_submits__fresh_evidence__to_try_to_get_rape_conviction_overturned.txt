The former Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> striker Ched Evans has 
submitted “fresh evidence” which he hopes will get his rape conviction 
overturned.

A statement on his website says the submissions were made to the Criminal 
Cases Review Commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/criminal-cases-review-commission> on his 
behalf on Friday. It is claimed that these details “strengthen” his case.

Evans, 26, was released from prison last year after serving half of his 
five-year sentence for the rape of a 19-year-old woman in a hotel in Rhyl in 
April 2012. He remains on licence.

The statement on his website reads: “The application to the Criminal Cases 
Review Commission on behalf ofChed Evans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ched-evans> was submitted on 15 July 2014 
and was given Level 1 priority in September 2014.

“On Friday 23rd January 2015 further detailed submissions – supported by 
previously unavailable fresh evidence that we believe strengthens Ched’s 
application – were lodged with the commission.”

An earlier appeal against Evans’s conviction was rejected by three judges at 
the Court of Appeal in 2012.

Evans has made attempts to restart his career at Sheffield United  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/20/ched-evans-training-offer-withdrawn-sheffield-united>
andOldham Athletic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/08/ched-evans-signing-called-off-oldham>
 but these have collapsed in the face of a huge public outcry.
