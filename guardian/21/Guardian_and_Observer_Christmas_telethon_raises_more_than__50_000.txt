Journalists who answered phones between 10am and 6pm included the Guardian’s 
editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, the Observer’s editor, John Mulholland, 
columnists Gary Younge, Polly Toynbee and Marina Hyde and senior journalists 
Larry Elliott and Hugh Muir. There were 1,500 calls and a further £85,000 was 
donated online.

Individual donations ranged from £10,000 to £1.33, the smaller amount being 
from one caller who said he only had £1.34 in his account.

This year’s appeal is in aid of refugee children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/09/please-help-us-help-child-refugees-survive-the-winter>
 with donations divided between three charities: Help Refugees, which 
distributes food, clothing, shelter and medicine to refugees across Europe; 
Safe Passage, which provides legal advice to unaccompanied refugee children to 
help them apply for asylum in the UK; and The Children’s Society, which 
provides services from language lessons to mentoring.

Donations will still be accepted online <http://guardian.charitiestrust.org/> 
so please give generously.

Thank you for your altruism so far. Please help us to raise even more money 
thisChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> to help 
children who have fled war and disaster.
