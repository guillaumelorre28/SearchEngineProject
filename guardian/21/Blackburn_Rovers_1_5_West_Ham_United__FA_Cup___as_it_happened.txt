Well, for approximately six minutes, the upset was on. Once Victor Moses 
cancelled out Ben Marshall’s opener, the tide was only ever turning one way. 
Dimitri Payet ran the show for West Ham, scoring with a superb free-kick and a 
late rampage through a defeated Blackburn defence.

In between those two highlights, Emmanuel Emenike got his West Ham career 
started with two goals, and there were two red cards in a Cup tie that was 
certainly exciting, if not entirely competitive.

West Ham were excellent, and keeping out their forwards in this form will be a 
daunting task for anyone in the quarter-finals. I’ll be back later on to find 
out who they get in the draw. Don’t forget to join Rob Smyth forChelsea v

91 mins: Payet began a run in his own half, flicking the ball past one 
defender, then turning another inside out, skipping into the box, and firing 
past Steele and into the bottom corner. What a player West Ham have on their 
hands.

90 mins: Two added minutes. Emenike puts the ball into the net, after Moses’ 
header is smartly saved by Steele, but he is flagged offside. Since Taylor’s 
red card, they have been rampant.

88 mins: Blackburn were ahead in this game. The gulf in class is growing by 
the minute, and Payet, the arch tormentor, almost picks out Cresswell with a 
cross.

86 mins: As home fans head for the exits, Payet again makes mincemeat of the 
defence, before slotting the ball across goal to Emenike. On a hat trick, he 
shimmies and shakes, but crashes his shot off the post!

GOAL! Blackburn 1-4 West Ham (Emenike)

Payet looks up from midfield, and lifts a languid through ball that takes out 
the entire Blackburn defence. Emenike strolls towards goal, sits Steele down, 
and tucks the ball inside the near post.

80 mins: The red card has changed, well, nothing – West Ham remain rooted in 
the Blackburn area, flicking the ball between their forwards in the training 
ground style. Emenike eventually fires wide when he should have scored – but 
replays show the striker was offside.

78 mins: That was a curious red card; there was contact, but Henley, chasing 
after his own loose touch, was hardly clean through on goal. Moss, at an 
awkward angle, seemed totally convinced it was a red card.

77 mins: Marshall wastes the free kick, and West Ham are back on the front 
foot, pinging the ball around the Blackburn area before Lanzini fires over. A 
couple of changes: Reece Oxford is on for Ogbonna, and for Blackburn, Tony Watt

64 mins: Antonio, who has taken on the right-back role in the Cristiano 
Ronaldo style, slaloms through the Blackburn defence, and forces another Steele 
save. Blackburn are over-run at the back, and Kouyaté is on hand to cut the 
ball back, where Emenike is waiting to tap the ball into an empty net.

Blackburn can’t hold out any longer, as Emmanuel Emenike gets his first West 
Ham goal, and as good as ends this game as a contest.

62 mins: West Ham crank up the pressure, and Antonio collects a pass from 
Payet, forcing another smart low save from Steele. Kouyaté is on hand to turn 
the ball in, but he’s flagged offside. It wasvery close.

60 mins: Payet makes his first intervention of the second half, teeing up 
Noble with a classy diagonal pass. The West Ham captain fires an effort across 
Steele, but it’s neither cross nor shot, and drifts wide.

56 mins: West Ham sense the chance to kill the game, and Steele has to extend 
himself expertly to keep out Antonio’s low shot from a tight angle. Taylor 
looked upset with himself rather than the referee, and it’s hard to argue both 
challenges deserved a booking.

RED CARD! Chris Taylor sent off for Blackburn!

Moses brings the ball away and skips past Taylor, who clips the winger’s 
heels. Jon Moss issues a second yellow card, and Taylor is off!

53 mins: Bennett, perhaps Blackburn’s standout player, sees another shot 
blocked by Collins, and the hosts win a corner. A melee ensues, with Ogbonna 
clearing a snap shot smartly, but West Ham can break...

52 mins: Blackburn look set to make an attacking change, with Simeon Jackson 
getting ready to come on. From another deep free kick, Marshall finds Lenihan, 
whose header loops into Randolph’s arms. Still, a positive start from the hosts.

50 mins: Collins does err under pressure, conceding a throw in deep in his own 
half. Bennett sees his shot deflected away, before another thunked Collins 
header lands at the feet of Lenihan. His low, angled shot flies a couple of 
feet wide of the far post.

48 mins: The lofty camera angle at Ewood Park is well suited to Blackburn’s 
long-ball tactics, but so is James Collins, who is getting his head to every

46 mins: Blackburn earn a free-kick through Brown, who commentator Derek Rae 
eloquently describes as ‘rumbustious’. The set piece is delivered long, but 
West Ham clear their lines comfortably.

Rob Shaw is a (moderately) happy Hammer at half-time:

“Difficult to recall a time when West Ham could play an away cup tie in the 
North against a club like Blackburn and look so comfortable... from a Hammer’s 
viewpoint the sensation is one of alarm.”

Half-time: Blackburn 1-2 West Ham

After a scrappy start, Ben Marshall had Ewood Park rocking with the opener, 
but West Ham quickly turned up the tempo, equalising through Victor Moses, then 
taking the lead through Dimitri Payet’s fantastic free kick. The visitors have 
looked comfortable since, but signs of complacency are creeping in – and this 
game is far from finished.

44 mins: West Ham ping the ball around midfield, but Collins over-reaches with 
a pass to Payet, and Taylor charges upfield. Without any real support, he 
charges past Collins and into the box, but the ball won’t sit up for him, and 
his eventual shot, from a tight angle, is tame. That was careless from Collins, 
who looks relieved.

43 mins: West Ham remain camped in the Blackburn half – although Noble almost 
presents Bennett with a clear route to goal, after stumbling on the halfway 
line. They can’t afford to take ittoo easy here.

40 mins: Antonio threads a slide-rule ball down the right touchline, and 
Kouyaté forces a corner. Payet delivers the cross, but Collins heads over the 
bar. Blackburn will now be happy to get to half-time a goal behind.

West Ham’s Emmanuel Emenike and Dimitri Payet run riot at Blackburn
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/21/blackburn-rovers-west-ham-united-fa-cup-match-report> 
Well, for approximately six minutes, the upset was on. Once Victor Moses 
cancelled out Ben Marshall’s opener, the tide was only ever turning one way. 
Dimitri Payet ran the show for West Ham, scoring with a superb free-kick and a 
late rampage through a defeated Blackburn defence.

In between those two highlights, Emmanuel Emenike got his West Ham career 
started with two goals, and there were two red cards in a Cup tie that was 
certainly exciting, if not entirely competitive.

West Ham were excellent, and keeping out their forwards in this form will be a 
daunting task for anyone in the quarter-finals. I’ll be back later on to find 
out who they get in the draw. Don’t forget to join Rob Smyth forChelsea v

Jon Moss puts Blackburn out of their misery, and West Ham are into the 
quarter-finals in some style.
 
91 mins: Payet began a run in his own half, flicking the ball past one 
defender, then turning another inside out, skipping into the box, and firing 
past Steele and into the bottom corner. What a player West Ham have on their 
hands.
 
The man of the match puts extra gloss on the final score with another 
wonderful goal.

90 mins: Two added minutes. Emenike puts the ball into the net, after Moses’ 
header is smartly saved by Steele, but he is flagged offside. Since Taylor’s 
red card, they have been rampant.
 
88 mins: Blackburn were ahead in this game. The gulf in class is growing by 
the minute, and Payet, the arch tormentor, almost picks out Cresswell with a 
cross.
 
86 mins: As home fans head for the exits, Payet again makes mincemeat of the 
defence, before slotting the ball across goal to Emenike. On a hat trick, he 
shimmies and shakes, but crashes his shot off the post!
 
Payet looks up from midfield, and lifts a languid through ball that takes out 
the entire Blackburn defence. Emenike strolls towards goal, sits Steele down, 
and tucks the ball inside the near post.

83 mins: Lenihan, who could easily have been booked in the first half, is 
cautioned for a cynical foul on Collins.
 
82 mins: West Ham players, and fans, appeal for a penalty as Lanzini is 
dragged down in the area, but Moss is unmoved.
 
80 mins: The red card has changed, well, nothing – West Ham remain rooted in 
the Blackburn area, flicking the ball between their forwards in the training 
ground style. Emenike eventually fires wide when he should have scored – but 
replays show the striker was offside.
 
78 mins: That was a curious red card; there was contact, but Henley, chasing 
after his own loose touch, was hardly clean through on goal. Moss, at an 
awkward angle, seemed totally convinced it was a red card.
 
77 mins: Marshall wastes the free kick, and West Ham are back on the front 
foot, pinging the ball around the Blackburn area before Lanzini fires over. A 
couple of changes: Reece Oxford is on for Ogbonna, and for Blackburn, Tony Watt 
comes on for Chris Brown.
 
Well, then. Jackson finds Henley, bursting forward down the left, and the full 
back skips past Kouyaté, before hitting the deck. Jon Moss shows Kouyaté a 
straight red card!

73 mins: Alex Song is on, replacing Mark Noble. This second half has lost a 
little of its fizz.

70 mins: West Ham fans are toasting Slaven Bilic, keeping the noise levels 
high despite the patches of empty seats. Good practice for next season, eh?Eh?
 
69 mins: Moses goes for a repeat of his equaliser, racing deep into the 
Blackburn half and aiming for the far corner, but it’s scuffed and easy enough 
for Steele.
 
67 mins: West Ham bring on Manuel Lanzini, in place of Pedro Obiang. Not great 
news for Blackburn fans.
 
64 mins: Antonio, who has taken on the right-back role in the Cristiano 
Ronaldo style, slaloms through the Blackburn defence, and forces another Steele 
save. Blackburn are over-run at the back, and Kouyaté is on hand to cut the 
ball back, where Emenike is waiting to tap the ball into an empty net.
 
Blackburn can’t hold out any longer, as Emmanuel Emenike gets his first West 
Ham goal, and as good as ends this game as a contest.

62 mins: West Ham crank up the pressure, and Antonio collects a pass from 
Payet, forcing another smart low save from Steele. Kouyaté is on hand to turn 
the ball in, but he’s flagged offside. It wasvery close.
 
61 mins: A throw-in for Blackburn, which Marshall launches into the area – but 
Randolph rises through a sea of bodies to clutch the ball.
 
60 mins: Payet makes his first intervention of the second half, teeing up 
Noble with a classy diagonal pass. The West Ham captain fires an effort across 
Steele, but it’s neither cross nor shot, and drifts wide.
 
58 mins: Jackson is on, replacing Craig Conway. The task is much tougher for 
Blackburn now, of course.
 
56 mins: West Ham sense the chance to kill the game, and Steele has to extend 
himself expertly to keep out Antonio’s low shot from a tight angle. Taylor 
looked upset with himself rather than the referee, and it’s hard to argue both 
challenges deserved a booking.

Moses brings the ball away and skips past Taylor, who clips the winger’s 
heels. Jon Moss issues a second yellow card, and Taylor is off!

53 mins: Bennett, perhaps Blackburn’s standout player, sees another shot 
blocked by Collins, and the hosts win a corner. A melee ensues, with Ogbonna 
clearing a snap shot smartly, but West Ham can break...
 
52 mins: Blackburn look set to make an attacking change, with Simeon Jackson 
getting ready to come on. From another deep free kick, Marshall finds Lenihan, 
whose header loops into Randolph’s arms. Still, a positive start from the hosts.
 
50 mins: Collins does err under pressure, conceding a throw in deep in his own 
half. Bennett sees his shot deflected away, before another thunked Collins 
header lands at the feet of Lenihan. His low, angled shot flies a couple of 
feet wide of the far post.
 
48 mins: The lofty camera angle at Ewood Park is well suited to Blackburn’s 
long-ball tactics, but so is James Collins, who is getting his head to every 
hoof upfield.
 
46 mins: Blackburn earn a free-kick through Brown, who commentator Derek Rae 
eloquently describes as ‘rumbustious’. The set piece is delivered long, but 
West Ham clear their lines comfortably.
 
The second half is underway, with West Ham now playing towards their vocal 
travelling fans. No changes at half-time.
 
Rob Shaw is a (moderately) happy Hammer at half-time:

“Difficult to recall a time when West Ham could play an away cup tie in the 
North against a club like Blackburn and look so comfortable... from a Hammer’s 
viewpoint the sensation is one of alarm.”
 
Here’s that Payet free kick. Not bad, eh?
 
After a scrappy start, Ben Marshall had Ewood Park rocking with the opener, 
but West Ham quickly turned up the tempo, equalising through Victor Moses, then 
taking the lead through Dimitri Payet’s fantastic free kick. The visitors have 
looked comfortable since, but signs of complacency are creeping in – and this 
game is far from finished.
 
45 mins: Two added minutes, with Taylor’s intervention getting the home fans 
interested again. At the other end, Moses fires a speculator high and wide.
 
44 mins: West Ham ping the ball around midfield, but Collins over-reaches with 
a pass to Payet, and Taylor charges upfield. Without any real support, he 
charges past Collins and into the box, but the ball won’t sit up for him, and 
his eventual shot, from a tight angle, is tame. That was careless from Collins, 
who looks relieved.
 
43 mins: West Ham remain camped in the Blackburn half – although Noble almost 
presents Bennett with a clear route to goal, after stumbling on the halfway 
line. They can’t afford to take ittoo easy here.
 
40 mins: Antonio threads a slide-rule ball down the right touchline, and 
Kouyaté forces a corner. Payet delivers the cross, but Collins heads over the 
bar. Blackburn will now be happy to get to half-time a goal behind.
 
38 mins: “We’re going to Wembley” bellows the throng assembled in the away 
end. It hasn’t taken long for West Ham to turn this game around.
