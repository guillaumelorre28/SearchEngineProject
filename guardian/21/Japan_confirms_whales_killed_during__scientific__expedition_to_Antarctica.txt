Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> has confirmed whales were 
killed on its most recent “scientific” expedition in the Antarctic region.


Four survey ships from Japan’s Institute of Cetacean Research were in the 
Antarctic region over a period of 115 days from 1 December last year.

The institute’s report said 333 minke whales were captured, including pregnant 
females.


Japan’s actions are in defiance of international criticism and despite a 2014 
UN legal decision that ruled so-called scientific whaling activity in the 
Southern Ocean was a front for commercial hunts.

The Australian government has described Japan’s decision to resume whaling 
over the southern hemisphere summer as “deeply disappointing” and says it has 
raised concerns at the highest level of the Japanese government.


It had said it would consider sending a customs patrol vessel to the Southern 
Ocean as well as exploring options for legal action.


But conservation group Sea Shepherd 
<http://www.seashepherd.org/cove-guardians/> said in February that the Japanese 
fleet had faced little or no scrutiny over the summer and Australia and New 
Zealand seemed unwilling to send a ship to intercept them.
