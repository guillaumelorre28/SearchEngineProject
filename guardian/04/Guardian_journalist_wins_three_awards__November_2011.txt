Guardian reporter Nick Davies, who has led our investigation into phone 
hacking over the last few years, has won a trio of awards this week for his 
tireless reporting.

On Tuesday night he was named as the Foreign Press Association's journalist of 
the year. Along with the Guardian's special investigations correspondent Amelia 
Hill he also picked up the FPA's print and web news prize. They won the joint

 on 4 July this year.

And last night Nick was honoured once again, winning the Frontline Club award

 for his "exceptional journalism, integrity, courage and independence of 
spirit."

Vaughan Smith, founder of the Frontline Club and a judge of the Awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards>, said:
"Nick Davies' work this year has led to a shake up of the media. Though his 
pursuit of the truth was not always popular with his colleagues in journalism 
he persevered, and we're only just beginning to see the impact of his 
revelations."
