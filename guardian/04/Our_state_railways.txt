One point which has been missed in your letters on rail privatisation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/26/virgin-trains-debate-much-wider-issue>
 (27 June) is how taxpayers' money flows to state coffers in Germany, 
Netherlands and France. Not only have we lost most of our rail manufacturing 
base, but now German state railways (DB) controlsArriva group 
<http://www.arriva.co.uk/>, which provides train services in Wales and the 
Cross Country franchise, as well many bus services. DB also controls our major 
rail freight operator (DB Schenker <http://www.rail.dbschenker.co.uk/>). Dutch 
Railways (NS), through its subsidiaryAbellio <http://www.abellio.com/>, is the 
Greater Anglia franchisee, and has a part interest in Merseyside and Northern 
trains, and some buses in London.

Finally, the French, with their state-owned transport interests in Veolia, 
Transdev and theParis Transport Authority (RATP) 
<http://www.ratpdev.com/_subsidiaries/subsidiary_london_uk.php>, have a 
presence in running buses in London, Bournemouth and other places. Although 
most of these publicly owned operators are doing a good job, needless to say 
there is no reciprocal British state interest abroad.
