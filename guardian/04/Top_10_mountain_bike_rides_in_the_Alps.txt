Saint-Luc, Switzerland

High in the giddy, vertical world of the Anniviers valley, Saint-Luc offers 
quintessential Swiss singletrack set against seriously stunning backdrops. A 
small but hardcore park adds some adrenaline to the mix. The small resort of 
Saint-Luc isn’t an obvious choice in this area: it’s nearby Zermatt, which has 
the most famous backdrops and singletracks in the business, while Crans-Montana 
in the Sierre valley below has the established park scene. However, the riding 
at Saint-Luc is every bit as good, both in the park and out in the wilds. The 
funicular uplift is open much earlier than its neighbours, and the sunny slopes 
mean dry and dusty trails by early spring, so you can get your big-mountain 
singletrack fix before the main biking season really kicks off.

From the top of the funicular follow the signs to the Hôtel Weisshorn. It’s 
not a particularly exciting climb up the firetrack, but the views up towards 
the Weisshorn and Bishorn are staggering. Once you reach the hotel, climb up to 
your left and on to the balcony trail heading towards Zinal. Big-mountain 
singletracks don’t get any more epic than this, with the rocky terrain and huge 
glaciers beyond feeling more like the Himalayas. Continue along this line until 
you see a small track on your right zigzagging through the meadows and on to a 
firetrack. After a couple of corners take a right turn, following signs for 
Saint-Luc. This lovely rolling singletrack is so thick with deep red pine 
needles that it’s like riding along a big soft ginger beard. When you reach the 
small chalets take a left and drop down through the forest to La Combaz before 
cruising back along the road into Saint-Luc.

Lift dates
The funicular at Saint-Luc 
<http://www.rma.ch/tourism/summer-2015-dates-schedules-3.html> is open from the 
end of May (€10 lift up plus €4 for mountain bike) and the area also features a 
bike park, while the other resorts in the valley usually open from July onwards.

Where to stay
The Hôtel Beausite <http://www.lebeausite.ch/#page-home-hotel> has clean, 
comfortable rooms, helpful staff and great views over the valley for around 
€170 a night. Another good (and more affordable) option is theCamping 
d’Anniviers <http://www.camping-anniviers.ch/> in the town of Vissoie lower 
down the valley, where you can get a pitch for your tent for around €10. From 
here you can take a bus or drive up to Saint-Luc, which takes around 15 minutes.

Eating and drinking
A popular venue is the Fougère bar and pizzeria 
<http://www.hotelrestaurantlafougere.com/restaurant.ws> not far from the 
funicular. The food is simple and tasty, plus it’s also a clean, friendly but 
basic B&B. Doubles from €96,hotelrestaurantlafougere.com

Just a short drive from Les Gets, yet still very much off the UK biking radar, 
Samoëns and the Grand Massif boast one of the biggest networks of lift-accessed 
singletrack in the Alps. If you like the idea of huge descents through stunning 
Alpine backcountry, but would prefer to get there via ski lifts rather than 
days of slogging through the wilderness, then you won’t find a better place in 
the Alps than here.

Straight out of the Flaine gondola you’ll be greeted by a spectacular view of 
Mont Blanc. Go left towards Samoëns and stick to the right of the grassy peak 
in front of you. This is proper wilderness and the sort of place that would 
normally have taken many hours of pushing to access. The fun sheep tracks 
winding through the shale outcrops slowly turn into a main trail, which 
eventually brings you to the forest above Samoëns and a singletrack with 
switchbacks and natural wall rides all the way into the town.

Lift dates
Visiting in July and August generally guarantees open lifts. A week pass for 
the Grand Massif system is €40.ete.grand-massif.com 
<http://ete.grand-massif.com/>.

Where to stay
The hotels are not prepared for biking guests; a better bet is to go for a 
self-catering apartment.Alps Accommodation <http://www.alpsaccommodation.com/> 
offers chalets and apartments with garage space and washing facilities.

Eating and drinking
Le 8M des Monts <https://www.facebook.com/8mdesmonts> on the Place de l’Église 
serves top-notch food, but if you’re looking for a big feed then go toLe Savoie 
<http://www.savoiebar.com/#/accueil> on the Place du Gros Tilleul, which offers 
generous portions of hearty food, such as burgers and crepes, along with clean, 
simple salads. Handily, it’s also open daily from 8.30am-2am. A beer in the 
main square is recommended after a tough day’s shredding, but if you can’t make 
it that far then Mimi’s Crepes next to the lift (Samoëns 1600) is ideally 
situated. And the chaps atCovey’s Irish Pub <http://www.coveysirishpub.com/> – 
less than 150 metres from the village centre - will make you feel welcome.

There’s a lot of money kicking around these resorts and it shows in the two 
downhill tracks above the village, which are among the finest man-made runs 
you’ll encounter. The huge height gains and breathtaking scenery make this a 
quality venue for epic gravity-assisted adventure.

Take a series of lifts out of Montana up to the Plaine Morte, where you’ll be 
greeted by staggering views over the glacier below. Take a left and climb 
briefly to the peak before dropping down the ridgeline and drifting through the 
shale towards thecol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col> (lowest point on a 
mountain ridge) ahead of you. As the trail levels out, head to the left into a 
second valley following signs for Lac de Huiton. The mellow gradient through 
this valley means you can really rip and carve through the hardpack and shale 
singletrack, while smooth rock slabs work as hand-made kickers. Keep heading 
left around the spine following signs for Crans-Montana and Violettes. Push up 
to the Col de Pochet and then glide back down to the Violettes along glorious 
singletrack through the meadows.

Lift dates
The Plaine Morte cable car that gives you access to the big enduro lines 
mentioned above is open during July and August, but Cry d’Er and the park open 
from June to mid-October. Full details of opening times and prices (from €24 
for an adult half-day pass) are atcrans-montana.ch 
<http://www.crans-montana.ch/ete/en/bike/Opening_vtt>. There is the option of 
dropping into the valley and catching the funicular back up from Sierre, but 
bear in mind this costs around €10 a trip. It runs (almost) year round:

Where to stay
Camping Moubra <http://campingmoubra.ch/>, a tranquil spot among the pines, is 
one of the best and most affordable options. It offers tent pitches from around 
€8 a night.

Eating and drinking
For instant refreshment on the trails check out Bar 360 
<http://www.hotel360.sitew.ch/#HOME.A>, a popular spot next to the north shore 
zone at the bottom of the park. In town,Pizzeria Molino 
<http://molino.ch/en/restaurants/crans-montana.html> is always busy due to the 
large and delicious pizzas that flow from the kitchen. Late-night “chill bars” 
are the speciality here and you can chill in style atLeo’s Bar

Probably the best riding in the Chamonix valley … and maybe even the world.Le 
Tour and the adjoining Vallorcine valley have legendary trails. Add in 
breathtaking scenery wherever you look and you’ve got backcountry blasting at 
its finest. Le Tour is at the Swiss end of the valley and has the gentlest 
terrain in the area (by Chamonix standards at least). All the good stuff 
requires a small push or pedal to access, but it’s all easy enough to find if 
you’re armed with a map. What the map won’t tell you is just how perfect the 
trails are. Every ridgeline is topped with a ribbon of gorse-lined singletrack 
winding off towards the vivid blue glaciers and immense peaks.

From the Col de Balme drop down a magnificent hardpack run to the Col des 
Posettes. From here, traverse around the left of the Aiguillette des Posettes 
until you reach a crossroads. Either drop to the left for a brilliant flowing 
trail across the face or head up to the ridgeline, which is very technical and 
almost trials-like in sections. Both trails finish in the wood above the Col 
des Montets, which has seemingly endless switchbacks back into Le Tour. Be 
aware, though, that biking in this area is restricted in July and August.

Lift dates
Lifts run from June until the end of September. For information on times and 
the variety of pass prices visitchamonix.net

Where to stay
Stay in Chamonix to take advantage of the great nightlife there. Chamonix.com 
<http://www.chamonix.com/hebergement,19,fr.html> lists a wide range of 
accommodation options, including camping, self-catering apartment and hotels. 
The picturesque village of Argentière should be considered if Chamonix is 
booked out.

Eating and drinking
Finding an affordable option in Tour is not easy, though during the day the 
best place to visit is therefuge at the Col de Balme 
<http://www.chamonet.com/accommodation/huts/col-de-balme-refuge-2191m-chamonix>
, just after the Col des Posettes. It has beautiful views over the Glacier du

variety on offer: try somewhere such asLa Petite Kitchen 
<http://www.lapetitekitchen.fr/en>, where the evening menu has dishes including 
chipotle spiced rack of pork ribs, and spinach and cheese strudel with 
ratatouille, both €18.

One of the most iconic peaks in the business, the Matterhorn stands guard over 
some breathtaking singletrack that never seems to end. Those views cost money 
though, making Zermatt a relatively expensive venue. However, there’s no 
denying that this a very special place to ride, with magical trails that take 
you on a full-throttle Alpine adventure through the dazzling glacial peaks to 
the wooded valleys below.

If you only ride one descent in Zermatt, make it this swoopy singletrack 
charge from the Rothorn to Täsch, more than 1,500 metres below on the valley 
floor. Ride straight out of the back of the lift to pick up a track cutting 
across the huge scree slope of the Oberrothorn. After this, it’s fair to say 
you’ll never want to ride a park trail again. Picking up another singletrack 
coming from the Sunnegga, it’s possible to traverse across the mountain 
following signs for Täschalp, before plunging into the forest and keeping an 
eye out for the cheeky lines that cut across the firetrack and deliver you to 
Täsch.

Lift dates
Zermatt has a long summer season, with most lifts running from May until 
mid-October. Because of the high altitude you may find a lot of snow on the 
trails before mid-June. Lift passes are split between theGornergrat train 
<http://www.gornergratbahn.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx> or the Sunnegga and 
Schwarzsee areas. This does allow the picking and choosing of which runs to do, 
but even then the prices are hefty. A day’s pass on the Gornergrat is about €80 
– so a week’s riding could get expensive.

Where to stay
Zermatt is car-free so you will have to leave the car at nearby Täsch. Here 
you’ll find many camping spots, as well as restaurants and hotels that have 
sprung up to cater for those looking to ease the financial strain of visiting 
Zermatt. One of the best isCamping Täsch 
<http://www.campingtaesch.ch/home_443.html>, next to the river and close to the 
train station for Zermatt, where you can get a tent pitch for €6.70 a night. 
For more hotels with bike-friendly facilities, such as washing areas and secure 
storage, thezermatt.ch 
<http://www.zermatt.ch/en/mountain-biking/Bike-accommodation> site has a long 
list of offerings. It’s also worth mulling over a bike-friendly chalet:OTP 
<http://www.otp.co.uk/> is one the most popular local operators.

Eating and drinking
Zermatt has one of the best – and largest – selections of nightlife in summer. 
You pay for it, of course, but there are some reasonable options, such as the 
tasty burgers for around €14 atBrown Cow Pub 
<http://www.hotelpost.ch/brown_cow_pub_167.html>. Popular drinking spots include
GramPi’s pub <http://www.grampis.ch/>, the Papperla Pub 
<http://www.julen.ch/en/papperla-pub/welcome/> and Elsie’s Bar 
<http://www.elsiebar.ch/home.html>.

Made famous by the Megavalanche 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/18/megavalanche-mountain-bike-race-alps-france>
, Alpe d’Huez has gained something of a celebrity status in the biking 
community. Huge descents over glaciers, moorland, rocky singletracks and forest 
trails provide a variety of terrain in what many claim is the home of modern 
enduro riding. Alpe d’Huez is high on a plateau above Bourg d’Oisans, not far 
from Les Deux Alpes on the other side of the valley. It’s a very different 
riding experience to the bike park of Deux Alpes though, with the emphasis on 
physically challenging natural lines rather than big berms and freeride 
features.

Arguably one of the most famous descents on earth, the Megavalanche drops from 
the highest lift on the hill, the Pic Blanc, down to Allemont in the Bourg 
valley. It covers everything from snow to rocky traverses, sandy berms and pine 
forest switchbacks, with a few wee climbs just to finish you off. With over 
2,500 metres of altitude drop, you can expect to be frozen solid at the top and 
lying in a pool of sweat at the bottom – layers are the way forward here. If 
you’ve seen the videos of the race and its mass starts, it can be an eerily 
quiet experience when riding this run by yourself, but that only adds to the 
adventure.

Lift dates
Normally the first weekend in July to the last in August but always check 
bike-oisans.com 
<http://bike-oisans.com/en/mountain-bike/alpe-dhuez-grand-domaine-vtt> for the 
latest information.

Where to stay
There are a number of campsites in the valley beneath Oz, such as Le 
Colporteur (camping-colporteur.com <http://www.camping-colporteur.com/>), while 
alpedhuez.com <http://www.alpedhuez.com> lists accommodation options to suit a 
range of budgets.

Eating and drinking
Check out “O” Bar <https://www.facebook.com/obaralpedhuez/info> (where you can 
get tapas for around €5 and beers for around €4). It’s slightly out of the way, 
at the bottom end of town, but has a really nice atmosphere.

Although not a huge riding area, the bike park at Sauze d’Oulx near the 
French-Italian border is one of the best in the central Alps. Clever use of the 
mellow terrain gives all the trails here a flowing and natural feel that all 
abilities will find addictive. All the trails follow the same basic recipe of 
fun rather than being extreme, and while big, rolling tabletops and north shore 
hits have been built into some of the runs, they have a grin factor rather than 
a terror aspect to them.

From the top of the Rocce Nera lift, follow the signs for the No 12 or Super 
Sauze trail. You may find yourself climbing up if the lift isn’t running, but 
it’s worth it. A glorious blast along open and undulating terrain launches you 
into the woods along a sort of freeride singletrack with wooden hits in all the 
right places.

Lift dates
From the end of June to early September, with round trip tickets from €8,

Where to stay
Hotel Gran Baita <http://www.granbaitasauze.it/> is popular among mountain 
bikers as it makes a great base to explore the area’s rides and because of its 
friendly atmosphere and good, hearty Italian food (doubles from €75 B&B).

Eating and drinking
L’Assietta <http://www.albergoassietta.it/> is a centrally placed hangout and 
serves great pizzas for around €18, although if fine dining is more your taste 
then tryDel Falco <http://www.delfalco.com/en> restaurant where the roast loin 
of pork with wild mushrooms will help restore some calories after a ride.

The bike park at Les Arcs may not be the best the Alps has to offer, but the 
large network of unmarked singletrack lurking in the woods is really 
impressive. It’s rooty, rocky and great fun for experienced riders; you’ll 
either need to hire a guide or spend a week creeping around the woods looking 
for a trailhead.

One of the classic big-mountain routes, this stunning trail off the Lac des 
Moutons offers everything from fast-rolling hardpack to technical and exposed 
sections. If you make it past the loopy hounds of hell that guard the sheep up 
top, you can enjoy a huge singletrack descent dropping 1,200 metres, all the 
way down to the village of Beaupraz. Go down into Peisey and take the Lonzagne 
lift back.

Lift dates
The lifts, (en.peisey-vallandry.com 
<http://en.peisey-vallandry.com/summer/lonzagne-vallandry-lift.html#.VYGKV2TF_5o>
), open during July and August.

Where to stay
Stay in Bourg-Saint-Maurice at the foot of the mountain, which has a vibrant 
old town and plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. TheChill Chalet 
<http://www.lesarcsnet.com/accommodation/chalets/chill-chalet-bourg-st-maurice> 
and theLoft <http://www.loftbourg.com/> (beds around €25 a night) are each good 
options. Also check out theBourg-Saint-Maurice campsite 
<http://www.camping-bourgsaintmaurice.com/> where you can hire a pitch for 
around €15 a night.Bike Village <http://www.bikevillage.co.uk/> and Trail 
Addiction <http://trailaddiction.com/> provide accommodation, guiding and 
airport transfer packages.

Eating and drinking
If Savoyard cuisine isn’t your thing go to Globetrotter in Bourg (34 Rue Jean 
Moulin, +33 9 67 01 38 09), which has tasty international cuisine, with an 
emphasis on south-east Asian food. You can get three courses for around €20pp. 
If you can’t resist the local cheese fest then Le Refuge Altitude 810 (55 
Grande Rue, +33 4 79 07 52 54) near the centre of town will oblige in blocking 
your arteries – for around €25pp you can fill up on classics such as fondue and 
raclette, or try one of the delicious platters.Bazoom 
<http://www.lesarcsnet.com/food/restaurants/bazoom-cafe-bourg-st-maurice> and 
the Tonneau bar (2 Avenue du Stade) near the funicular have a good post-ride 
atmosphere.

From the top of the Ruinettes lift go east and climb along the double track, 
following signs to La Chaux. As you turn around the spine you’ll spot a rocky 
track below the ridgeline in front of you. This leads you to the start of a 
sublime trail that follows the spine all the way to the valley floor. Unlike 
many of the natural lines here, the tight switchbacks are often set deep in 
natural gullies, which mean you can properly rail them and keep on the gas. Big 
grins are guaranteed by the time you finally reach Le Morgnes, where you can 
either climb up to Sarreyer and get a bit more trail time, or just roll down 
the road back to Le Châble and let those warped discs cool down a little.

Lift dates
As with all Swiss resorts, Verbier has a long season compared with its French 
and Italian neighbours, with lifts running from June through to late October,
verbierbikepark.ch <http://www.verbierbikepark.ch>

Where to stay
For local holiday packages see Bike Verbier <http://bikeverbier.com/> and MTB 
Verbier <http://www.mtbverbier.com/>; both offer week-long packages including 
accommodation, guiding, meals, transport, lift passes and laundry for around 
€1,100pp. If you’re just visiting for a day or two with your own transport then 
consider stopping at the lift at Le Châble. There’s a huge parking area here 
and it means you avoid the drive up to Verbier.

Eating and drinking
Close to the Ruinettes lift, the Pub Mont Fort 
<https://www.facebook.com/pubmontfortverbier?fref=ts> is one of the original 
Verbier bars and is still hugely popular, with a good range of beers, cocktails 
and live music or DJs in the evenings. Tasty burgers and international dishes 
make it a decent spot for food too. A more chilled venue is theFarinet bar 
<http://www.hotelfarinet.com/lounge> on the main street, where you can slump in 
sofas next to the fire and take it easy.

Among the rocky peaks and glaciers of the Tarentaise valley, this giant bike 
park has a huge number of trails for all abilities. Forget any notions of 
forest singletrack and exploring forgotten valleys – this no-nonsense park is 
all about big berms, big bikes and big views. The Superenduro and DH world cup 
in Val d’Isère has cemented the area as a serious biking destination, and as if 
this weren’t enough, it’s totally free to use throughout the season. With most 
of the riding above 2,000 metres, a big mountain experience with stunning views 
is guaranteed, as are fast-draining, all-weather trails.

Big thrills are to be had along this knife-edge ridgeline, which is the 
closest thing you’ll get to a natural trail in Tignes. From Tovière you’ll see 
the path heading up the ridge in front of you. With 360-degree views over the 
glaciers and with massive drops on either side, this singletrack picks its way 
around the rocky outcrops. It takes some confidence to ride the really exposed 
sections, but it flows very well if you can keep your head. High Alpine 
giddiness guaranteed.
