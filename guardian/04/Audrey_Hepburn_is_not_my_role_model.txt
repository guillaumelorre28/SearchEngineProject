A new book by Pamela Clarke Keogh puts the titular question: What Would Audrey 
Do? <http://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Would-Audrey-Do-Timeless/dp/184513382X> The 
idea is that you can refer to the tome when wondering how to approach a 
situation with "timeless style and grace". The book is quite clearly not aimed 
at the likes of me, since when I saw it taking pride of place in the window of 
the local Waterstone's, my immediate response was: "She'd develop anorexia and 
depression, then keep both miserable illnesses secret until her dying day â€“ 
that's what Audrey would do." Timeless style and grace? What a burden.
