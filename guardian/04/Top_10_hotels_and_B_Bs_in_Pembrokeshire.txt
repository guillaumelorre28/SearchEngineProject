Knowles Farm, Lawrenny 


For ultimate romance, leave the car behind and sail a dinghy or kayak up to 
this cosy farmhouse B&B, which has its own mooring on the shores of the upper 
Cleddau estuary. There's good reason for landlubbers to visit too. Surrounded 
by 1,000 acres of farmland (the cows here produce some of the milk forRachel's 
yoghurts <http://www.rachelsorganic.co.uk>, which are served as part of the 
B&B's organic farmhouse breakfasts), staying here is all about escapism. Rustle 
up your own barbecue on the terrace, head down to the coast or just take a rug 
and a book out onto the lawn.

Bay House, Tenby

 Bay House, Pembrokeshire 
A modern take on the traditional seaside guesthouse, this five-star B&B is set 
in a 19th-century townhouse, on a row of pastel-coloured houses just back from 
the seafront. That its three immaculate bedrooms and guest dining/living area 
are decorated in shades of butter, cream and biscuit is entirely appropriate; 
owner, Debra, either makes her own cakes or buys them in from local bakers 
every day for a "help yourself" afternoon tea. The one downside? It's only open 
from Easter to October.

YHA Broad Haven 

 Broad Haven, Pembrokeshire 
Recently overhauled to better cater for the largely family groups who stay 
here, rooms at Broad Haven's 80-bed youth hostel are now fully en suite. Set a 
little way back from a wide sandy beach (and close to even more spectacular 
Newgale beach), its great selling point is its functionality. As well as 
self-catering facilities, there's a smart blue and white dining room looking 
out towards the coast and, in summer, the hostel runs barbecues for both guests 
and non-guests. There are pubs and a chippie in Broad Haven but it's worth 
heading round the bay to prettier Little Haven if you want to eat out in more 
atmospheric surroundings. Try theSwan Inn <http://www.theswanlittlehaven.co.uk/>

beds from £17.50, double rooms from £42, family rooms for four from £50. Full 
breakfasts from £4.95, evening meals from £5.95 for a main course

Oriel Milgi, St Dogmaels

 Oriel Milgi, Pembrokeshire 
Opened last November in this pretty coastal village right at the far northern 
reaches of the county, Oriel Milgi's name refers to its owners' twin passions 
for art and whippets. Once a sea captain's house, the B&B's three bedrooms now 
set rustic wooden headboards and French linen sheets against sleek, 
contemporary bathrooms, vintage furniture and local art ("Coed" is the most 
decadent with its attached wet room and views out across the garden to the 
estuary beyond) but, more importantly, hospitality is done to Olympic standards.

Crug Glas, Abereiddy, near Solva

 Crug Glas, Pembrokeshire 
The five-star luxury here is heartfelt. A seven-bedroom Georgian country house 
that was once one of the residences of the Bishop of St David's, it's now run 
as a small, family-owned restaurant with rooms. Part of a 600-acre working 
arable farm, Crug Glas is big on old-fashioned pampering, with fresh flowers 
and cream-laced porridge two of many small indulgences. The five bedrooms in 
the main house are decked out with family heirlooms (room one, with its 
four-poster and freestanding copper bath, is the sexiest) while two newer 
suites across the farmyard are more contemporary. Head down to nearbyAbereiddy 
beach <http://bit.ly/zQMYKj> for the day, then tuck into a dinner of 
Pembrokeshire lamb or sea bass fillet with laverbread sauce.

Plas Farmhouse, Narberth

 Plas Farmhouse, Pembrokeshire 
A budget alternative to the swanky Grove Hotel (thegrove-narberth.co.uk 
<http://www.thegrove-narberth.co.uk>), just down the road, this three-room 
farmhouse B&B is full of happy contradictions. Though set in a 16th-century 
building and packed with antique and vintage finds, its rooms feel very 
21st-century, with Wi-Fi, great beds and more than a hint of an acquaintance 
with the Farrow & Ball paint chart. And, while it's set in Narberth, one of 
Pembrokeshire's liveliest villages, Plas Farmhouse feels peaceful and rural. A 
posy of fresh flowers by the bed, an invitation to light the fire in the guest 
lounge after returning from dinner at nearbyDiablo's 
<http://www.diablosnarberth.co.uk/menus.html> , and lashings of local breakfast 
supplies make this more than just B&B-ing by numbers. See Rhiannon's full

Hayston Farmhouse, Merrion

This farmhouse B&B, south of Pembroke, is an ideal retreat after a day spent 
hiking thePembrokeshire Coast Path <http://bit.ly/bztGSW> or strolling between 
Bosherstons' lily ponds <http://bit.ly/yj0qEZ>. Though it's no longer part of a 
working farm, you'd think it was from the Doctor Dolittle collection of horses, 
dogs and chickens running around the courtyard. Inside, it's just as homely 
with wellies by the door and jars of homemade marmalade cooling beside an Aga. 
The "Library", an antique-scattered sitting and dining room with an open fire, 
makes a grand setting for breakfast or dinner or you can eat on the terrace in 
good weather. Its two bedrooms have recently been redecorated, as has a lovely 
self-catering suite across the courtyard, which is occasionally let out for 
B&B, too.

Doubles from £75 B&B. Evening meals from £15 per head

Preseli Venture, Mathry

 Preseli Venture, Pembrokeshire 
Popular for 40th birthday parties or hen and stag weekends, this five-star 
lodge works as well for groups as it does for couples, families and singles. 
Built sustainably but not grungily, it sleeps up to 40 in dorm bedrooms that 
hold between two and eight people (the doubles are the most stylish, with 
wooden "hayloft" style beds, reached via ladders). Though you can't self-cater, 
if you don't want to have lunches and dinners thrown in you can opt just for 
B&B. There's a huge range of outdoor activities on offer, too.
• 01348 837709, preseliventure.co.uk <http://www.preseliventure.co.uk>). Beds 
cost from £39pppn B&B, or from £59pppn full-board. Add-on activities start from 
£49pp per half day

Canaston Oaks, Canaston Bridge, near Narberth

 Canaston Oaks, Pembrokeshire 
It's not often you find faggots on a breakfast menu but they'll do them here 
if you don't fancy a full Welsh. But, then, scratch beneath the surface of this 
contemporary seven-room B&B and you realise that there's more history in its 
walls than first appears. Family owned, its rooms have been developed from 
calves' cots, pigsties and stable blocks. Apart from some exposed stonework and 
antique chests of drawers, however, the feel is now modern, with underfloor 
heating, solid oak doors, designer bathroom fittings andMelin Tregwynt  
<http://www.melintregwynt.co.uk>throws. All are smart and comfortable but, 
unless you have children and need kitchen facilities, avoid Yr Onnen; the decor 
isn't up to the same standard as the other rooms.

The Clockhouse, Marloes

 The Clockhouse, Pembrokeshire 
As the jumping-off point for Skomer Island 
<http://www.welshwildlife.org/skomer-skokholm>, and with a lovely beach on the 
doorstep, this breezy blue and white, seaside-themed B&B gets busy – May and 
June are often booked out by twitchers wanting to catch puffin season on 
Skomer. The bedrooms aren't fancy but they're clean, comfortable and practical. 
Even if you're not staying here, it's worth making a detour for lunch at the 
attached summer-only cafe. Its grilled mackerel salads are perennially popular 
and crab claws are new on the 2012 menu.
