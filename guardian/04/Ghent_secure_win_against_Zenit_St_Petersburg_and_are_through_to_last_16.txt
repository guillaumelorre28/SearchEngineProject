Ghent became only the second Belgian side to advance to the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> knockout phase when they 
ended Zenit St Petersburg’s 100% record in Group H with a dramatic 2-1 win.

Danijel Milicevic scored a left-foot winner 12 minutes from time to secure the 
points for Ghent after Laurent Depoitre had put them ahead after 18 minutes 
only for Artem Dzyuba to equalise in the 65th.

Ghent, who are playing in the Champions League for the first time, matched the 
achievement of Anderlecht in the 2000-01 season by finishing second in the 
group, ending with 10 points behind Zenit, who amassed 15.

Depoitre, recently capped for the first time by Belgium, headed the home team 
ahead, connecting powerfully with Moses Simon’s cross after rising above 
Zenit’s Belgian defender Nicolas Lombaerts, who began his career at Ghent a 
decade ago.

Depoitre should have had a second just after the half-hour mark when a stray 
back pass from Luis Neto fell perfectly for the centre forward to run on to but 
as he bore down on the goalkeeper an outstretched leg from Yuri Lodygin rescued 
Zenit.

There were several occasions in both halves where Ghent’s defending looked 
nervy and ultimately it saw them cede their lead when the failure by both Sven 
Kums and Lasse Nielsen to clear an innocuous-looking cross set up Dzyuba.

It was the sixth goal in the group phase for the Russian international.

Yet the crowd at the Ghent Stadium came back into life once more when the 
Swiss-born Milicevic restored the lead.
