The thing about Shitty Watercolour <http://shittywatercolour.com/> is, he’s 
not all that... shitty. When web-based illustrator Hector Janse van Rensburg 
adopted the pseudonym four years ago, he didn’t much consider the prospect that 
he’d actually go on to make strides as a painter. His online devotees have been 
advising him of the irony (“you should rename yourself to Not-So-Shitty!”) ever 
since.

“Yeah,” van Rensburg says bashfully, “I’m not sure if the name was a mistake 
or not. I don’t see myself as a particularly creative or artistic person at 
all. I don’t really know what I’m doing.”

It all began one day in the summer of 2012, when the 18 year-old van Rensburg, 
bored and depressed after being rejected from Oxford University, picked up a 
cheap old set of watercolours and started to paint. He found himself sitting at 
his bedroom desk for days at a time, mixing and scribbling until it went dark 
outside. The process became a kind of therapy: he’d choose an image on the 
internet, copy it, upload it online – and repeat. “Mindless is definitely the 
word. It was a bit like data entry.”

Van Rensburg meanwhile gained notoriety on the clamorous threads of Reddit, 
where, under the alias Shitty_Watercolour, he’d post his pictures with jokey 
captions in response to Redditors’ comments. It made for quick inspiration, 
though the logistics could be surprisingly complicated. “The problem with 
Reddit is the timing,” he explains. “I’d log on at like 2 pm – that’s when 
everything starts going – and you can watch what trends are rising and what 
comments are popular, so it’s a calculated thing for me to work out what to 
paint and when.”

new.’ Illustration: Shitty Watercolour 
Over the following months he became more invested in his art as thousands 
followed him on various social media platforms. And suddenly his hobby wasn’t 
so therapeutic anymore. “As people liked them more and more I had a bit of an 
internal panic. It’s made me respect people in a creative job; it’s like every 
day is the last minute deadline to come up with something new.

“I realise I’ve brought it on myself, but apparently panicking and worrying 
has worked so far.”

For someone who suffers from watercolourist’s block, van Rensburg’s work rate 
is impressive. In his short career – which he juggles with a PPE degree at the 
University of York – he’s already produced several cardboard boxes’ worth of 
paintings. He reckons he has around 5,000 pieces stored away altogether.

The paintings themselves are a meme-savvy millennial’s answer to Quentin 
Blake; playful in style and humour, and thus apparently at odds with van 
Rensburg’s work ethic. “Every now and then, I’ll have to run away and do a 
painting at the last minute,” he says. “If I’m out with my flatmates and 
there’s a big event in the news and I want to paint something on it, I’ll just 
go home.”

And what do his friends make of his double life? “When we first moved into the 
flat I was recognised by three people in our block, which made them think I was 
really famous or something. I think they have a strange, disproportionate view 
of what I do.”

Being Shitty, it turns out, is a lonely occupation. “I’ve never really met 
anyone who does anything painty. I wish I had. I recently went to San Francisco 
and I did actually meet someone there who does drawings online, and we talked 
about drawing and how to do noses and ears and things. That was the first time 
I’d talked about drawing with anyone. It was nice.”

The closest thing he’s ever had to a mentor is an activity book by Quentin 
Blake himself: van Rensburg cites Drawing for the Artistically Undiscovered as 
his only art lesson, which probably explains why much of SW’s earlier work 
looks like it was cribbed from a Roald Dahl novel.

 It isn’t hard to see where SW got his inspiration for this 2013 painting.

Van Rensburg says he would love to be a full-time illustrator like his idol. 
“I don’t have plans to do anything PPE-related,” he says. “I might take an art 
course after I graduate. I do catch myself going on YouTube watercolour 
tutorials for beginners. It would be good to learn some of the basics...”

Not many “beginners” regularly get commissions from national media outlets as 
van Rensburg does, but his sheer lack of confidence in his abilities appears 
unaffected. “I don’t really associate myself with the paintings. I started 
doing them in the most random way, and people like them for strange and 
different reasons. My friends will tell me, ‘I spoke to someone and they can’t 
believe that I know Shitty Watercolour’, and I’ll have to think for a second: 
wait, I am Shitty Watercolour!”

He adds: “I still think they look terrible.”
