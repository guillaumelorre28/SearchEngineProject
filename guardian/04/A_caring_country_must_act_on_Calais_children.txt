I should imagine Lord Dubs (Call for action, 2 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/02/home-secretary-urged-to-act-over-refugee-children-stuck-in-calais>
) is incandescent as well as being saddened by the lack of action on lone child 
refugees in Calais. Home secretary Amber Rudd needs now to bring these poor 
disenfranchised children to Britain. Until she does, this new government’s 
failure will resonate loud and clear for years to come, to the detriment of 
this once altruistic and caring country.

• “To McEwan’s knowledge, no story has ever been written from the perspective 
of a foetus before” (Weekend, 27 August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/27/ian-mcewan-author-nutshell-going-get-kicking>
). Can it be possible that Ian McEwan does not know Carlos Fuentes’ 1987 novel 
Christopher Unborn (Cristobal nonato)? This is not only narrated by a foetus; 
Christopher begins his narration while he is still a sperm – perhaps allowable 
because he is male.

• “I just say whatever dumb stuff comes into my head and most of it is 
disgusting and horrible” (Amy Schumer review, 1 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/31/amy-schumer-review-edinburgh-playhouse>
). I’m sure I’m not the only one who thinks that sounds remarkably like the 
Republican party’s presidential nominee?

• Re recent correspondence on Hobbes (Letters, 2 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/01/wholl-be-the-judge-of-the-best-rail-network>
): I still have a poster saved from university, put up by a desperate college 
rowing club, which reads “Nasty? Brutish? Short? Ever thought of coxing?”

• The only thing that should be impacted as far as I am concerned are wisdom 
teeth (How Brexit impacted east Europeans, 2 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/after-the-brexit-vote-it-has-got-worse-the-rise-in-racism-against-east-europeans>
). What is wrong with affected?

• It’s that day again (3 September); when middle-aged fathers are reminded of 
their fragile mortality. Thanks, Temptations.
