At three hours and 38 minutes, that is the longest match in this tournaments 
history, 18 minutes longer than Andy Murray’s win over Kei Nishikori’s on 
Wednesday. Murray’s not afraid of a bit of physical torture, is he? “It was 
unbelievably tough. I had to fight very hard to get over the line. Pretty 
amazing tie-break.” Pretty amazing player. Milos Raonic gave it absolutely 
everything, had chances to win and showed amazing resilience at times. But 
Murray had too much in both tie-breaks and he moves into the final, where he 
will face either Novak Djokovic or Nishikori. They play tonight. Join me then. 
Thanks for reading. Bye.

Third set: Murray* 5-7, 7-6, 6-6 Raonic (*denotes server): After three hours 
and 17 minutes of peculiar tennis,Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> serves for the match again. He 
nets a forehand to make it 0-15. This is becoming a bit much, I’ll level with 
you. Soon it’s 0-30, Raonic winning a cross-court forehand duel. Murray makes 
it 15-30 with a searing forehand down the line, but he’s still got plenty of 
hard work to do, especially when he nets a forehand to gift Raonic two break 
pointsagain. Murray nets a backhand. We will have a tie-break. Absurd.

Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 6-5 Raonic* (*denotes server): Two mistakes from 
Raonic make it 0-30. Murray steels himself and wonders if he’s about to break 
again. Raonic serves superbly to make it 15-30, though, before Murray gets a 
bit too excited with a backhand return. The game goes to 30-all and more solid 
serving from Raonic makes it 40-30. Murray forces deuce, though, and incredibly 
earns a break point when Raonic picks a bad moment for a double fault. Can he 
take it? He can! Raonic wearily nets a forehand down the line and Murray will 
serve for the match again! What drama! Sport, eh?

Third set: Murray* 5-7, 7-6, 5-5 Raonic (*denotes server): After three hours 
and six minutes, Murray steps up to serve for the match. This hasn’t always 
felt like the likeliest of outcomes and there still might be a twist or two. In 
keeping with a barmy match, Murray is forced to wait while the people in charge 
switch the right lights on – and then Raonic cracks a stunning forehand return 
from right to left to lead 0-15. It’s 15-all when Raonic dabs wide after a 
Murray drop shot; it’s 15-30 when another brilliant Raonic forehand tees him up 
for a smash. Murray desperately needs first serves. He gets one, but Raonic’s 
tentative return drops inside the baseline and Murray ends up gifting up two 
break points by netting a backhand. Murray saves the first with an outstanding, 
defiant forehand to make it 30-40. Raonic still has another chance. Murray 
tries a drop shot again. This time, Raonic is on to his tricks. Murray can’t 
pass him, he tries a lob, Raonic breaks with a smash. Murray smashes a ball 
into the air and receives a warning from the umpire.

Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 5-4 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray wins the 
first point, just about, as he loops a forehand down the line and Raonic 
stretches into a stiff backhand that drops wide. Soon it’s 0-30, Raonic putting 
too much behind a forehand that flashes wide. Another miss on the forehand side 
hands Murray three break points. Raonic challenges to no avail; then he nets a 
backhand! After three hours and five minutes of gripping tennis, Murray breaks

Third set: Murray* 5-7, 7-6, 4-4 Raonic (*denotes server): A break here and 
Raonic will be serving for the match, so it’s safe to say that Murray can’t 
afford too much sloppiness. He needs some first serves. He gets one, but Raonic 
returns superbly and wins the point thanks to a ripped forehand into the right 
corner for 0-15. He clenches his fist, sensing that he has Murray right where 
he wants him here. He might be on to something, you know. Raonic attacks a weak 
second serve and makes it 0-30 with a clever forehand volley. Murray looks 
weary again. But wait. Murray wins the next three points to lead 40-30. But 
wait. The game goes to deuce, Raonic hammering a backhand down the line at the 
end of a brilliant, tense rally. Murray holds, though, skelping an ace away.

Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 3-4 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray has a couple 
of stabs at passing Raonic at the net, but he can’t find a way through and 
eventually nets a backhand for 15-0. It’s 15-all when Raonic nets a seemingly 
simple backhand, but the world No4 makes it 30-15 with an emphatic smash. 
Murray responds with a peach of a backhand down the line to make it 30-all, but 
finds himself down 40-30 after knocking a backhand return long off a second 
serve. Raonic holds to 30.

Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 2-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic produces 
some glorious tennis to crunch into a 40-0 lead, drop shots and forehands too 
hot for handle, but he volleys wide and double faults to make it 40-30. This is 
a bit careless from Raonic. But Murray can’t force deuce, wafting a forehand 
long off a second serve. That was a small chance for Murray.

Third set: Murray* 5-7, 7-6, 1-1 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic is 
responding with granite focus, moving into an ominous 0-30 lead with a fine 
backhand from left to right. A couple of sloppy groundstrokes lets Murray 
nervously move to 30-all, but Raonic earns a break point with a firm forehand, 
Murray stretching and hitting long. He can’t take it, though, limply netting a 
forehand, but he has another opportunity when Murray does the same thing. 
Murray digs deep; Raonic nets a forehand again. What a generous fellow. Murray 
holds.

Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 0-1 Raonic* (*denotes server): It’s going to be 
very interesting to see how Raonic responds given that he led by a set and a 
break. Not too badly here. He clobbers his way into a 40-0 lead and holds to 
love. The second set lasted 80 minutes, so both players must be feeling it.

Andy Murray suffers for his art as quest to end on a high remains alive

At three hours and 38 minutes, that is the longest match in this tournaments 
history, 18 minutes longer than Andy Murray’s win over Kei Nishikori’s on 
Wednesday. Murray’s not afraid of a bit of physical torture, is he? “It was 
unbelievably tough. I had to fight very hard to get over the line. Pretty 
amazing tie-break.” Pretty amazing player. Milos Raonic gave it absolutely 
everything, had chances to win and showed amazing resilience at times. But 
Murray had too much in both tie-breaks and he moves into the final, where he 
will face either Novak Djokovic or Nishikori. They play tonight. Join me then.

hard work to do, especially when he nets a forehand to gift Raonic two break 
pointsagain. Murray nets a backhand. We will have a tie-break. Absurd.
 
Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 6-5 Raonic* (*denotes server): Two mistakes from 
Raonic make it 0-30. Murray steels himself and wonders if he’s about to break 
again. Raonic serves superbly to make it 15-30, though, before Murray gets a 
bit too excited with a backhand return. The game goes to 30-all and more solid 
serving from Raonic makes it 40-30. Murray forces deuce, though, and incredibly 
earns a break point when Raonic picks a bad moment for a double fault. Can he 
take it? He can! Raonic wearily nets a forehand down the line and Murray will 
serve for the match again! What drama! Sport, eh?
 
Third set: Murray* 5-7, 7-6, 5-5 Raonic (*denotes server): After three hours 
and six minutes, Murray steps up to serve for the match. This hasn’t always 
felt like the likeliest of outcomes and there still might be a twist or two. In 
keeping with a barmy match, Murray is forced to wait while the people in charge 
switch the right lights on – and then Raonic cracks a stunning forehand return 
from right to left to lead 0-15. It’s 15-all when Raonic dabs wide after a 
Murray drop shot; it’s 15-30 when another brilliant Raonic forehand tees him up 
for a smash. Murray desperately needs first serves. He gets one, but Raonic’s 
tentative return drops inside the baseline and Murray ends up gifting up two 
break points by netting a backhand. Murray saves the first with an outstanding, 
defiant forehand to make it 30-40. Raonic still has another chance. Murray 
tries a drop shot again. This time, Raonic is on to his tricks. Murray can’t 
pass him, he tries a lob, Raonic breaks with a smash. Murray smashes a ball 
into the air and receives a warning from the umpire.

Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 5-4 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray wins the 
first point, just about, as he loops a forehand down the line and Raonic 
stretches into a stiff backhand that drops wide. Soon it’s 0-30, Raonic putting 
too much behind a forehand that flashes wide. Another miss on the forehand side 
hands Murray three break points. Raonic challenges to no avail; then he nets a 
backhand! After three hours and five minutes of gripping tennis, Murray breaks 
and he’ll serve for a place in the final!
 
Third set: Murray* 5-7, 7-6, 4-4 Raonic (*denotes server): A break here and 
Raonic will be serving for the match, so it’s safe to say that Murray can’t 
afford too much sloppiness. He needs some first serves. He gets one, but Raonic 
returns superbly and wins the point thanks to a ripped forehand into the right 
corner for 0-15. He clenches his fist, sensing that he has Murray right where 
he wants him here. He might be on to something, you know. Raonic attacks a weak 
second serve and makes it 0-30 with a clever forehand volley. Murray looks 
weary again. But wait. Murray wins the next three points to lead 40-30. But 
wait. The game goes to deuce, Raonic hammering a backhand down the line at the 
end of a brilliant, tense rally. Murray holds, though, skelping an ace away.
 
Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 3-4 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray has a couple 
of stabs at passing Raonic at the net, but he can’t find a way through and 
eventually nets a backhand for 15-0. It’s 15-all when Raonic nets a seemingly 
simple backhand, but the world No4 makes it 30-15 with an emphatic smash. 
Murray responds with a peach of a backhand down the line to make it 30-all, but 
finds himself down 40-30 after knocking a backhand return long off a second 
serve. Raonic holds to 30.
 
Third set: Murray* 5-7, 7-6, 3-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray’s quickly 
into a 30-0 lead in this game, but a double-fault at 30-all gives Raonic hope. 
A pinpoint forehand takes Murray to 40-30, though, and he holds to 30. Will we 
see a break?
 
Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 2-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic produces 
some glorious tennis to crunch into a 40-0 lead, drop shots and forehands too 
hot for handle, but he volleys wide and double faults to make it 40-30. This is 
a bit careless from Raonic. But Murray can’t force deuce, wafting a forehand 
long off a second serve. That was a small chance for Murray.
 
Third set: Murray* 5-7, 7-6, 2-2 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray is forced to

to lead 30-0 and holds to love thanks to some accurate groundstrokes.
 
Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 1-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray produces an

30-all when Raonic double faults, but the Canadian makes sure it goes to 40-30 
with a deft volley. Raonic holds to 30 when Murray nets a forehand.
 
Third set: Murray* 5-7, 7-6, 1-1 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic is 
responding with granite focus, moving into an ominous 0-30 lead with a fine 
backhand from left to right. A couple of sloppy groundstrokes lets Murray 
nervously move to 30-all, but Raonic earns a break point with a firm forehand, 
Murray stretching and hitting long. He can’t take it, though, limply netting a 
forehand, but he has another opportunity when Murray does the same thing. 
Murray digs deep; Raonic nets a forehand again. What a generous fellow. Murray 
holds.
 
Third set: Murray 5-7, 7-6, 0-1 Raonic* (*denotes server): It’s going to be 
very interesting to see how Raonic responds given that he led by a set and a 
break. Not too badly here. He clobbers his way into a 40-0 lead and holds to 
love. The second set lasted 80 minutes, so both players must be feeling it.
