Guinea revived their quarter-final hopes at the Africa Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> by thrashing 10-man 
Botswana 6-1 in Group D on Saturday.

Botswana's Patrick Motsepe was shown a straight red card just before half-time 
for a studs-up challenge on Pascal Feindouno but by then his side were 3-1 down.

Abdoul Camara had already set up two goals for the striker Sadio Diallo and 
scored one himself.

Botswana had briefly drawn level after Dipsy Selolwane's 23rd-minute penalty, 
awarded when the Guinea goalkeeper Naby Yattara clipped Jerome Ramatlhakwane 
after struggling to reach a poor back pass from Bobo Baldé.

Yattara dived to save Selolwane's first spot-kick in the bottom left corner, 
only for the Moroccan referee Bouchaib El Ahrach to ask for it to be retaken. 
Selolwane learned the lesson and went to the top right corner for Botswana's 
first goal at the tournament.

Guinea's three-goal advantage was soon restored when Ibrahima Traoré scored 
direct from a free-kick. They added two more in the last 10 minutes through 
Mamadou Diouldé Bah, with a deflected long-range effort, and Naby Soumah's low 
finish from a tight angle.

It was the most one-sided result so far and it left Botswana effectively 
eliminated. Guinea's progression now depends on their final group game against 
Ghana.

The Guinea coach Michel Dussuyer said: "We had to impose our way of playing 
and the mission was done. Against Ghana it will be like a final."

Botswana's coach Stanley Tshosane said: "We have to accept this and continue 
with our mission. We are a small nation – it's not an excuse – with limited 
professional players compared to other teams here."
