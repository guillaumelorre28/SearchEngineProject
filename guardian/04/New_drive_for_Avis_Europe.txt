Speculation that next month's interim figures from Avis Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/aviseurope> will trigger earnings 
upgrades helped its shares rise 4.25p to 104.5p - one of the best performances 
in the FTSE 250 yesterday.

Since April's profits warning, which the company blamed on falling demand from 
corporate customers, analysts have been worried that the slowdown had spread to 
Avis's leisure business.

But CSFB, which upgraded its rating on Avis to outperform yesterday and set a 
130p target, reckons demand has not deteriorated and prices in the year so far 
have held.

The investment bank has increased its 2003 earnings per share forecasts to an 
above consensus 6p. However, it says that a recovery in corporate spending will 
be needed for Avis to hit its new target price.
