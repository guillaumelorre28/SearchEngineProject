One of Britain's biggest public transport operators, rail and bus company 
Arriva, is to be taken over by a German firm

, in a £1.5bn deal. Aside from the irony of a franchise-owner on the UK's 
privatised railways being bought up by a state-owned foreign concern, Deutsche 
Bahn, news of the takeover has re-ignited the row over foreign ownership of key 
sectors of British industry.

With the controversy over Kraft's takeover of Cadbury, which resulted in Lord 
Mandelson calling for new rules 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/01/lord-mandelson-mansion-house-keynote>
 on foreign acquisitions, only weeks past, Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor 
Vince Cable has criticised the lack of a public interest test for foreign 
takeovers of strategically important UK companies and utilities.

The counter-argument runs, though, that its openness to foreign capital and 
investment is one of the strengths of the British economy and that a more 
protectionist stance would damage prospects for growth and prosperity.

Presumably, Arriva's trains and buses will still run – possibly, more 
punctually even – so does it matter who owns them, any more than it matters who 
owns, say, a Premiership football team?
