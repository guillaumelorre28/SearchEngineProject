Seeing the pictures of Katie canoodling with that cage fighter in front of our 
kids was the worst day of my life. "It was the worst day of my life," I told 
whichever magazine whose turn it was to get that hour's World!!! Exclusive!!!

I know people may be bored of our divorce now. Even I'm bored of our divorce 
now. "Even I'm bored of our divorce now," I told the BBC, breaking my silence 
again. "I think people want to get back to my music." The reporter said it was 
lovely I hadn't lost my sense of humour.

I called another mag. "Close pals say I haven't lost my sense of humour," I 
exclusively revealed.

Of course, my number one priority is that the kids aren't affected by all 
this. They need continuity. They need things to stay as normal as possible – 
and that means constant TV camera presence, playing their winsome part in 
paparazzi shots, and their parents discussing every aspect of their lives 
across a range of content delivery platforms. I'm not pitching forCelebrity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/celebrity> Dad Of The Year – although 
it would be an honour to be nominated in the same category as David and Brad – 
but I think I've managed that.

But mainly it's been incredibly stimulating for me creatively. Bob Dylan was 
massively inspired by marital disintegration, and I can totally relate. I've 
made some of my best reality TV in the past few weeks. In fact, unless I'm much 
mistaken, my new ITV2 series, Peter Andre: Going It Alone, will be my Blood On 
The Tracks.
