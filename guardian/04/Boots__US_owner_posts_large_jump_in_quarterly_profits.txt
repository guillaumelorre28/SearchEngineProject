The US owner of the Boots chain has reported a jump in quarterly profits as it 
reaped the benefits of cost-cutting.

Boots is part of Walgreens Boots Alliance, based in Illinois. It posted net 
earnings of $1bn in the three months to 31 August, its fourth quarter, up 
sharply from $26m (£21m) a year earlier. Sales increased 0.4% to $28.6bn, and 
were up 2.5% on a constant currency basis. The results were better than 
expected.

Over the year as a whole, net earnings edged down 1.1% to $4.2bn, while sales 
climbed 13.4% to $117.4bn.

The US company said it was on track to deliver $1.5bn in cost savings by the 
end of 2017, following a three-year restructuring programme. In the UK, it has
pushed through several rounds of redundancies

 to cut costs at its larger stores, cutting 350 assistant manager roles and 700 
office jobs in the past year. It employs about 60,000 people in Britain.

The 2014 merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots

 created the largest chemist chain in the US and one of the biggest retailers 
in the world.

Chief executive Stefano Pessina, an Italian billionaire known for his 
dealmaking and quiet lifestyle,

 said: “We have continued to make good progress in putting in place the 
building blocks for the future growth of the business.”

The company now expects its acquisition of Pennsylania-based drugstore chain 
Rite Aid Corporation, which was unveiled a year ago, to be completed early next 
year. The US regulator is likely to demand the divestment of 500 to 1,000 
stores, Walgreens said.
