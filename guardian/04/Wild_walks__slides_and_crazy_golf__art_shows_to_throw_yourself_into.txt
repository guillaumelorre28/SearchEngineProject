It’s festival time, and the green fields are soon to fill with dance tents, 
burger stands and overflowing toilets. Art has no Glastonbury as such (and the 
“art” at Glastonbury tends to run to carvedGreen Man 
<https://thegreenman.wordpress.com/the-green-man-in-history/> statues), but you 
can put together your own mini-visual arts festival from various enterprising 
open-air events this summer. So here goes.

The earl grey tea will start to kick in as we roll into Dulwich, where the 
grounds of John Soane’s Georgian architectural masterpiece Dulwich Picture 
Gallery plays host toScandimania 
<http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/whats-on/scandimania/2016/may/scandimania/>
 (7–15 May). There’s an open-air nocturnal showing of the funny-scary film 
Trollhunter, as well as Nordic folk music and, er, crochet to celebratethe 
gallery’s exhibition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/03/painting-norway-nikolai-astrup-review-nature-gleeful-energy>
 of Norway’s second-greatest painterNikolai Astrup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/dec/30/nikolai-astrup-lost-artist-norway-edvard-munch>
. Take care kids because Dulwich gets pretty wild.

No, really. Art can make for a more adventurous midsummer dream than standing 
in a field watching a far-off pop star through a screen of rain. Why not play 
crazy golf at New Art Exchange, Nottingham with holes designed by artists 
including Jeremy Deller and Yinka Shonibare? But wait, Doug Fishbone’sLeisure 
Land Golf <http://www.nae.org.uk/exhibition/doug-fishbones-leisure-land-golf/99>
(until 19 June) is not just fun, it’sa critique 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2016/feb/21/crazy-golf-leisure-land-golf-doug-fishbone>
 of the leisure industry. A bit likeBanksy’s Dismaland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/aug/21/in-dismaland-banksy-has-created-something-truly-depressing>
, but with shorter queues.

For those in search of pure hedonism with no implied critique of the system 
(its patron is Boris Johnson, after all)Anish Kapoor’s spiralling red Orbit 
tower <http://arcelormittalorbit.com/> becomes a giant helter-skelter from 24 
June, with the addition ofa slide by interactive art star Carsten Höller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/26/anish-kapoor-addition-artwork-foisted-on-him-boris-johnson>
. The London Mayor hopes this will help lure in some punters to this very 
expensive folly.

A more cerebral summer sculpture exhibition is unveiled at Jupiter Artland  
<https://www.jupiterartland.org>on 31 July. If you live in Scotland or are 
going to the Edinburgh festival, don’t miss this wonderful sculpture park 
outside the capital. As well as being gorgeously wooded and mercifully free 
from bronze Moores or Hepworths, it has an ever-growing collection of 
entrancing and eerie artworks by the likes of Jim Lambie, Ian Hamilton Finlay 
and Andy Goldsworthy.

Jupiter Artland’s latest permanent creation is Animitas 
<https://www.jupiterartland.org/whats-on/christian-boltanski> by that French 
artist of memoryChristian Boltanski 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jan/13/christain-boltanski-grand-palais-paris>
, whose works all ultimately echo, as if from far away, the suffering of the 
Holocaust. He is planting hundreds of tiny Japanese bells in the glades of 
Artland to sing like ghosts in the breeze. This really is a great place to 
stroll and picnic and absorb intelligent art on a summer day. Just watch out 
for the chill of Boltanski’s vision.

Summer doesn’t have to mean leaving your brain at home. So perhaps the most 
important open-air artwork of the season will be Mark Anderson’sFurious Folly 
<https://www.1418now.org.uk/commissions/furious-folly/>, which tours the 
country from 17 June, and promises to surround its audiences with an 
audiovisual bombardment that brings to life the horrors of the first world war.

 Bombardment … Furious Folly. 
The Battle of the Somme started on 1 July 1916. Anderson’s centenary artwork 
pays homage to the Dadaist artists and poets who launched theiranti-war protest 
<http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/dada/arthistory_dada.html> against 
a civilisation gone mad that same year. This is no field of poppies – it is a 
night of anger. What happened to the festive spirit? Perhaps art is too grown 
up for summer festivals after all. Or perhaps the summer evenings are a perfect 
time for the reflection and reveries that good art inspires.
