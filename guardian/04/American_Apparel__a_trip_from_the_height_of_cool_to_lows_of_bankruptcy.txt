Before it became embroiled in lurid boardroom scandals, American Apparel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/american-apparel> used to be cool. 


Not only did it add a stylish twist to seemingly plain t-shirts and jeans, but 
it championed human rights through slogans on its products and won friends by 
basing manufacturing in America, rather than the far east. The company built an 
empire of 260 shops in 19 countries around the world, including the UK.

However, the fashion brand is now trying to make a fresh start after filing 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/american-apparel-files-for-bankruptcy>
 in the US. American Apparel has agreed a deal with its lenders whereby they 
will write off roughly $200m (£132m) of bonds in exchange for equity in the 
company, reducing its $300m debt to no more than $135m and cutting annual 
interest payments by $20m.

The agreement will wipe out existing shareholders, including the controversial 
Dov Charney, who founded the company in 1989.

Charney has been at the centre of the downhill spiral 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/25/rise-fall-american-apparel> 
that American Apparel has found itself in since Deloitte quit as auditors in 
2010 after raising doubts about the reliability of the retailer’s accounts.

The American Apparel founder has faced a string of law suits over sexual 
harassment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/17/american-apparel-ceo-dov-charney-fired-fall-icon-sleaze>
 allegations, which include claims that he used a former employee as a “sex 
slave”, masturbated in front of a female journalist, and sent explicit text 
messages to staff.

Charney was suspended as chief executive last summer by the company’s board 
for “alleged misconduct and violations of company policy”. After an 
investigation, a special committee thenruled last December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/17/american-apparel-ceo-dov-charney-fired-fall-icon-sleaze>
 that “it would not be appropriate” for American Apparel’s founder to return.

However, this has sparked a bitter legal battle between Charney and American 
Apparel. Charney has denied the claims and is suing the company for $20m for 
defamation, while the company took out a restraining order  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/02/american-apparel-granted-restraining-order-dov-charney>
that prevented Charney from criticising it in public and attempting to overhaul 
the board.

A key aspect of the Chapter 11 filing, which needs to approved by a court in 
Delaware, is that it will temporarily block the legal claims againstAmerican 
Apparel <https://www.theguardian.com/business/american-apparel>.

Not only has the controversy surrounding Charney led to significant upheaval 
in the boardroom and a string of costly legal claims, but it hasdamaged the 
American Apparel brand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/21/american-apparel-arty-subversive-creepy>
. Sexually explicit adverts featuring young models do not connect well with the 
public when the boss of the company faces harassment allegations.

At the same time, American Apparel has faced growing competition in the US 
from cut-price overseas competitors such as H&M, who have effectively 
replicated the brand’s fashion for a lower price. The company’s sales are down 
by almost a fifth compared to a year ago and it has recorded a loss for ten 
consecutive quarters, which was unsustainable given its debts.

The downfall of the brand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/american-apparel-goes-out-of-fashion-and-into-bankruptcy>
 is not just a pivotal moment for fashion, but a setback to the entire US 
industry. American Apparel is the country’s biggest manufacturer of clothing 
and it is based in downtown Los Angeles. The company claims to pay experienced 
factory works more than $30,000 a year, compared with $600 a year for workers 
in Bangladesh factories.

Paula Schneider, an industry veteran who was parachuted in earlier this year 
as the new chief executive of American Apparel, said: “This process will 
ultimately benefit our employees, suppliers, customers and valued partners.

“American Apparel is not only an iconic clothing brand but also the largest 
apparel manufacturer in North America, and we are taking this step to keep jobs 
in the US, and preserve the ideals for which the company stands.”

Schneider said that American Apparel will re-emerge as a “stronger, more 
vibrant company” by strengthening its finances. However, industry analysts are 
not so sure.

Neil Saunders, chief executive on retail consultancy Conlumino, said: “Big 
questions remain around both brand and product. On the former, it is still not 
clear what American Apparel is trying to change to.

“We know that the company is looking to be more ethical in its marketing, 
relying far less on the sexual overtones it has used in the past. However, as 
welcome as this may be, it does mean that a fresh viewpoint is needed in order 
to give the company a clear and cohesive brand image.

“The search for a point of view and a handwriting for its ranges is also a 
crucial one, and is something that American Apparel needs to sort out as 
quickly as possible.

“This is especially so with competition intensifying, with the expansion of 
players like Forever 21, H&M and now, albeit on a smaller scale, Primark. 
Without a distinct identity, we fear American Apparel will simply remain lost 
in the murkiness of the teen apparel market.

“Chapter 11 buys only time. Whether the company and its management use that 
time to solve the deep seated issues remain to be seen.”
