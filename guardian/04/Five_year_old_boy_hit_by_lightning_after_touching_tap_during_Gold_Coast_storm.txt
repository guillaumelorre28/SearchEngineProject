“That lightning has travelled through the roof, through the eaves, onto a 
metal fence and down into the cement, and it has blown quite a large hole in 
the cement,” Fuller said.

Fortunately no one was injured in that situation, although a number of people, 
including a woman in her 50s, were treated at the scene for shock.

The lightning strikes were due to thunderstorms rolling across the Gold Coast 
region, as well as the Sunshine Coast on Wednesday afternoon. The storms had 
largely moved out to sea by 5.45pm, however bureau forecaster Andrew Bufalino 
said volatile conditions would continue into the evening.

It follows an early morning storm which rolled over the region leaving 
thousands without power as almost 40,000 lightning strikes hit, the second such 
early-morning display in as many days.
