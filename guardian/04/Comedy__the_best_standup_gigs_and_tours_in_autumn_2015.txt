Ninety-nine dates, 450,000 tickets sold, 14 nights at the 10,000-capacity SSE 
Hydro in Glasgow: Kevin Bridges is, by any measure, a big deal. He’s also, on 
form, one of thesharpest, least complacent acts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/08/comedy-gold-kevin-bridges-story> 
in arena comedy, and this autumn sees the culmination of his biggest tour yet.

Mark Thomas <http://www.markthomasinfo.co.uk/>

A journey around the UK for a new show from the great comic/agitator, itself 
about several journeys Thomas made around London – and beyond – gauging whether 
our country is in fact ours any more. His answers – spoiler alert! – aren’t 
much fun, but the show (previewed atlast month’s Edinburgh fringe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/18/mark-thomas-at-edinburgh-festival-review-a-bulletin-from-the-frontline-of-dissent>

Not many acts complete the double – Melbourne’s Barry award followed by 
Edinburgh’sFoster’s comedy award <http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/> – in the same 
year. The in-yer-face Australian oddball Sam Simmons has done so this year, 
crowning a distinguished career in very strange (think Harry Hill with added 
antagonism) comedy. Now his Spaghetti for Breakfast show – an absurdist litany 
of so-called “things that shit me” –comes to the capital 
<http://sohotheatre.com/whats-on/sam-simmons-spaghetti-for-breakfast> for a 
three-week run.

Katherine Ryan <http://www.katherineryan.co.uk/>

Her recent Edinburgh fringe run 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/13/katherine-ryan-edinburgh-review-stand-comedy-club>
 showcased a comic relishing her moment and hitting her stride. Channelling the 
spirit of Joan Rivers, Ryan’s new show Kathbum delivers in equal portions 
acerbic celebrity scuttlebutt (Bill Cosby, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Taylor 
Swift get it in the neck) and tales from the life of a Canadian expat singleton 
and single mum. Now on the road, a good show is likely to get better.

Trevor Noah 
Trevor Noah <http://www.trevornoah.com/>

When he booked this short UK tour, Trevor Noah was just a fast-rising South 
African comic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/01/trevor-noah-daily-show-south-africa>
, destined for glory but not yet there. The new host of what used to be The 
Daily Show with Jon Stewart is there now, via a media hounding earlier this 
year when several ill-advised jokes were excavated from a long way down his 
Twitter feed. There’ll be no such thing in these performances of his Lost in 
Translation set, from which you can expect smooth, accomplished and culturally 
insightful comedy.

 was narrowly pipped for the Edinburgh comedy award, and comes to London this 
autumn for a three-week run. It combines a loving spoof of Desert Island Discs 
(Kirsty Young cameos prominently), a hymn to obscure thrift-store LPs, and a 
tale of Morpurgo’s lost love. It’s brilliantly worked, and there are big laughs.

The standout comedy show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/20/kieran-hodgson-lance-edinburgh-festival-review-comedy-lance-armstrong>
 of Edinburgh fringe 2015, Kieran Hodgson’s Lance is a blissfully funny nugget 
of narrative comedy, tracing teenage Kieran’s amateur cycling career, and his 
departure from Yorkshire to the dreaming spires of England’s south. Great 
characters, laugh-line after laugh-line, one of the bang-on funniest comic 
songs you’ll have heard for ages – and no little insight, too, into the 
bittersweet experience of leaving home and losing friends: it’s a terrific show.

As if Harry and Paul weren’t enough, another middle-aged 1990s double-act take 
their show on the road. In this case, it’s Britain’s grandaddies of nonsense 
comedy, the sub-surrealist purveyors of The Man with the Stick and bald-pate 
men-children Davey and Donald Stott. It may be just a nostalgia-fest. But I’d 
guess Vic and Bob retain sufficient anarchic spirit, even now, to ensure that a 
tour subtitled The Poignant Moments will be no mere love-in.

Bridget Christie <http://www.bridgetchristie.co.uk/>

After two brilliantly funny, committed feminist comedy shows in two years made 
her one of the country’s most indispensable comic voices, this year Bridget 
Christie is ranging more widely over the terrain of social justice. Tory cuts, 
race, Nigel Farage – all are given the Christie treatment (faux-flustered 
outrage, heavy sarcasm, clownish sense of her own ridiculousness). Add to that 
extracts from her new feminist tomeA Book for Her 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/20/bridget-christie-book-for-her-review-hybrid-writing-performance>

This sketch trio’s fringe debut last month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/09/daphne-edinburgh-festival-review-pleasance-phil-wang-jason-forbes-george-fouracres>
 made for one of the festival’s most eye-catching hours of comedy. I won’t 
pretend that George Fouracres, Phil Wang and Jason Forbes dovetail together 
beautifully on stage. They don’t; that’s part of the charm. But their oddly 
unharmonised contributions add up to a delightful, highly self-aware sketch 
show, featuring racist radio plays, murderous pirate captains and a 
spectacularly clumsy barista.
