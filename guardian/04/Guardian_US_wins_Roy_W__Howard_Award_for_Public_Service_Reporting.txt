Guardian US has been awarded the Roy W. Howard Award for Public Service 
Reporting by the Scripps Howard Foundation for its coverage of the NSA 
revelations.

The award, which comes with $10,000, acknowledges the work of the US team - 
led by Guardian defence and security correspondent Ewen MacAskill and 
freelancers Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, with assistance from James Ball 
and Spencer Ackerman - in being the first to report the National Security 
Agency was collecting millions of U.S. citizens' phone records, carefully 
vetting vast amounts of information for journalism, and conducting the first 
exclusive video interview with Edward Snowden.

Judges in the award said: "The Guardian US was the go-to media for one of 
2013's biggest news stories, prompting public discussion of NSA policies."
