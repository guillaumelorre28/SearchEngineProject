Rich surfaces – the painted case of a keyboard instrument, a blue shimmering 
skirt, a picture on the wall – interact in an almost abstract play of colour in 
this precociously modern meditation on desire, solitude and the silent music 
that is art.

“This is a house in Kuwait,” says Edmund Clark of his image, part of an 
exhibition at the Imperial War Museum, London. “It belongs to the brother of an 
ex-Guantánamo Bay detainee. The architecture of the room struck me as 
incredibly confining.” Read more about the photographer’s Guantánamo series in
