A grand jury indictment charging two former Atlanta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/atlanta> area police officers with murder 
says a man died after the officers used stun guns on him while his hands were 
cuffed behind his back.

The indictment filed on Tuesday charges former East Point police sergeant 
Marcus Eberhart and former corporal Howard Weems in the April 2014 death of 
Gregory Towns Jr.

They each face charges of felony murder, aggravated assault, involuntary 
manslaughter and reckless conduct and violation of oath by a public officer.

No lawyer was listed for either man in the court file. Calls to a number 
listed for Eberhart went unanswered. A person who answered at Weems’s home said 
he wasn’t there and hung up the phone when asked if he could take a message.
