Yaya Touré and Wilfried Bony are returning to Ivory Coast to celebrate the 
Africa Cup of Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> 
triumph so will not be available for Manchester City’s visit to Stoke City on 
Wednesday evening.

City’s 1-1 draw with Hull City on Saturday

 left the champions seven points behind Chelsea and so they must defeat Stoke 
to retain realistic hopes of defending the title.

As Manuel Pellegrini’s side have been knocked out of the FA Cup, their next 
game is the visit of Newcastle United on Saturday week, meaning that is the 
first match Touré and Bony, the new £26m signing from Swansea who is yet to 
make debut, can play in.

Touré captained the Ivory Coast to Sunday’s 9-8 penalty shoot-out win over 
Ghana

 in Equatorial Guinea, the midfielder taking a successful kick in a victory 
claimed by the goalkeeper Boubacar Barry, who scored the winning penalty having 
saved from his opposite number Razak Braimah.

While Bony crashed his spot-kick against the crossbar, the Ivorians are 
expected in Abidjan on Monday for an official reception after becoming African 
champions for the first time since 1992.

Bony said: “We just want to enjoy it and think about nothing else for the rest 
of the week, then continue with our teams.”

Touré denied he intends to retire from international football. “Leaving? 
Retired? Me? I’m 31, my friend. No, that’s my brother [Kolo]. When you see 
something, you want to repeat it. But it’s difficult, when you’ve lost it 
before [in two previous finals]. But now I’m very happy, and I’m going to enjoy 
it with my friends.”
