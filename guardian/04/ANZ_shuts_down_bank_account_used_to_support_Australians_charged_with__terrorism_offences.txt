A bank account used to raise money to support Australians charged with 
terrorism offences has been shut down by the ANZ.

The Brothers Behind Bars Facebook group claims their business account, which 
was only opened a couple of weeks ago, was used to collect “charity funds”.

The page, which is run by hardline preachers Junaid Thorne and Wissam Haddad, 
posted a statement saying they had been given no opportunity for an appeal.

“No specific reason was provided for the closure but I’m sure many of you can 
read between the lines,” the post said. “Meanwhile far-right groups are free to 
conduct business as usual.”

The group claims the account only ever received less than $1000 in the short 
time is was open and despite the “setback” they would move forward to continue 
the “good fight”.

In the ANZ bank notice posted on the Facebook page, the bank said it had 
exercised its discretion to close the accounts and would forward a bank cheque 
for the net balance of the account.
