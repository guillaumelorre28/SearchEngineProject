The Merchant of Venice

Shakespeare dominates Welsh National Opera’s autumn season. There’s a revival 
of the company’s production ofVerdi’s Macbeth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/29/from-the-archive-verdis-macbeth-world-reviewed-1847>
, and a new production ofKiss Me Kate! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/25/kiss-me-kate-review-opera-north-bringing-joy-and-skill-to-frothy-cole-porter>
, Cole Porter’s take on The Taming of the Shrew. Between them comes the British 
premiere of pianist and composerAndré Tchaikowsky <http://andretchaikowsky.com/>
’s only opera. The Merchant of Venice was first performed at the 2013 Bregenz 
festival, more than 30 years after Tchaikowsky’s death, and it’s that staging, 
directed by Keith Warner, which now comes to Britain.

After the success last year of its complete survey of Schubert’s songs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/oct/09/oxford-lieder-festival-franz-schubert-project-tom-service>
, the Oxford Lieder festival sets itself a slightly less daunting challenge 
this time, turning its attention toSchumann <http://www.robert-schumann.eu/>’s 
output. Once again, the target is completeness, and the festival has assembled 
a mouth-watering lineup of singers to work their way through Schumann’s vocal 
oeuvre. Baritone Christian Gerhaher gives the opening recital; later on there 
are appearances by sopranos Juliane Banse and Christiane Karg, tenors Christoph 
Prégardien and Mark Padmore, and many more.

The Nose


Barrie Kosky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/13/barrie-kosky-the-magic-flute-i-was-like-euggh>
 has regularly been tipped as a candidate to follow Kasper Holten as artistic 
director of the Royal Opera next year, but the boss of the Komische Oper in 
Berlin is only now directing his first show at Covent Garden. Kosky is making 
his debut withShostakovich’s brittle early satire 
<http://www.siue.edu/~aho/musov/dmitri.html>, based on Gogol’s short story. 
It’s the first time The Nose has been staged by the company, and Ingo 
Metzmacher makes a welcome return to to conduct.

A concert that mixes Vivaldi with Muse, Metallica and Pink Floyd? Crossover 
projects can be toe-curlingly embarrassing, but in the hands of inspirational 
violinistHugo Ticciati  <http://www.hugoticciati.com/>and the O/Modernt 
Kammarorkester this promises to transcend the dread “fusion” and reinvent the 
past by exploring relationships between old and new.

The Sounds that Changed America

By one of those happy coincidences that give meaning to the lives of concert 
planners everywhere, the next six months will see the 80th birthdays of both
Steve Reich <http://www.stevereich.com/> and Philip Glass 
<http://philipglass.com/>, and John Adams <http://www.earbox.com/>’s 70th. The 
Barbican is celebrating all three anniversaries with a season-long series of 
concerts, focusing on each composer in turn. Reich gets attention first, with a 
weekend that includes performances of his classic Drumming, the video opera 
Three Tales, and the orchestral Desert Music.
• Barbican, London 
<http://www.barbican.org.uk/classical1617/season-highlights/reich-glass-adams>, 
5 and 6 November; series continues to 25 April.

Lulu

Though English National Opera’s programme at the Coliseum this season is 
restricted to eight productions, just three of them new, William Kentridge’s 
staging ofBerg’s unfinished masterpiece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/01/opera-lulu-alban-berg>, first 
seen in New York last year, is thankfully one of those that has survived the 
cuts. Lulu comes to London with American soprano Brenda Rae in the title role 
of the femme fatale; Sarah Connolly is the faithful Geschwitz and James Morris 
is Schön. Recently departed ENO music director Mark Wigglesworth conducts.
• Coliseum, London <https://www.eno.org/whats-on/lulu/>, 9-19 November.
