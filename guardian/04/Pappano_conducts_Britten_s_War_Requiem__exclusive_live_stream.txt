In 1958 Benjamin Britten <https://www.theguardian.com/music/benjamin-britten> 
was invited to compose a work - of any content, scale or duration - for the 
consecration ceremonies of Coventry Cathedral, which was being rebuilt 
following its destruction by Luftwaffe bombs. Britten decided on a full-length 
setting of the Requiem Mass interspersed with the poetry of Wilfred Owen. He 
told friends that what mattered most to him was the message. On the title page 
of the score, he quoted Owen:

"My subject is War, and the pity of War.
The Poetry is in the pity …
All a poet can do today is warn."


"The War Requiem is a masterpiece of the deepest emotional and moral depth," 
wrote Ian Bostridgein a piece for the Guardian in 2011 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/22/benjamin-britten-war-requiem>. 
It is today one of the 20th century's defining works whose popularity has 
proved enduring. "The War Requiem is extremely communicative," says Antonio 
Pappano. "The audience picks it up right away. The feelings are very strong, 
very clear, very touching. I think the nature of the piece's success is in its 
accessibility and, frankly, its honesty."
