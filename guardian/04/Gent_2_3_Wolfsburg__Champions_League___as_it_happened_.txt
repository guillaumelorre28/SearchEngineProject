Full-time! Gent 2-3 Wolfsburg

90 min +3: Rodriguez wins a free-kick at the back post after being nudged in 
the back by Nielsen. And that is the end of what ended up being quite 
compelling.Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> return to 
Germany with three away goals but they will be disappointed by how things 
ended. Cruising 3-0 thanks to Draxler and Kruse prompted talk of a cricket 
score but Gent finally woke up in the final 10 minutes and scored twice to keep 
the tie alive. Thanks for reading – it was worth sticking around for in the 
end, eh? Until next time, bye!

Julian Draxler gives Wolfsburg the edge but Gent revival keeps tie alive

90 min +1: Dejaegere overhits a cross to Coulibaly, and that allows Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> an opportunity to waste some 
time. Kruse jogs off slowly to be replaced by Putaro.

GOAL! Gent 2-3 Wolfsburg (Coulibaly)
 Gent’s Kalifa Coulibaly looks to the scoreboard after his goal. Photograph:

89 min: Oh my, what a turnaround! Coulibaly heads home at the near post, 
getting in front of Dante, to direct home Saief’s cross. The keeper is out of 
position, but this is incredible. Second best and treading water for 80 
minutes, Gent are right back in this.

85 min: And now Saief goes close. He has been good since coming on. Rodriguez 
clears an initial delivery but only as far as the substitute. He cuts in from 
the left and curls only a couple of inches wide.

84 min: Another attempt from Gent. Dejaegere shoots from range. The ball 
swirls and Casteels parries before smothering as Coulibaly raced down on goal. 
If only they had performed like this earlier in the game.

83 min: Suddenly Gent are playing ball. Saief picks out Foket, who shoots low 
and across goal. Casteels saves it, unconvincingly.

GOAL! Gent 1-3 Wolfsburg (Kums)
 Gent’s goalscorer Sven Kums left. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters 
80 min: Gent have pulled one back! Kums tucks it into the bottom right corner 
but Casteels was weak, failing to get a strong enough hand in front of the 
shot. It’s his 14th goal of the campaign but, you would imagine, nothing more 
than a consolation. Kums got a little lucky when cutting in as Schürrle 
slipped, allowing the Gent captain with the room to shoot.

78 min: Gent have had a shot! Asare hits a rasper with the outside of his left 
boot from about 25 yards. Unfortunately for Gent, it is straight down Casteels’ 
throat.

74 min: Mitrovic spills another cheap ball, almost allowing Schürrle to break 
free. But the defender recovers well to stop the former Chelsea player from 
pulling the trigger near the ‘D’.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>, who have been short on 
confidence, look several levels above. Presently: nothing is happening.

64 min: Gent have not stopped trying despite being vastly outclassed. They win 
a corner after a Kums shot is deflected on to the bar and out by Dante. It does 
not amount to a decent chance.

60 min: That’s the tie, folks. From the free-kick Träsch overlaps on the 
right, sending a teasing cross in from near the end-line. Kruse arrives at the 
near-post to tuck in from close range.

A double Gent substitution after the goal: Milicevic is replaced by Saeif. 
Matton is on for Simon.

57 min: Gent are just not up to the level of their Bundesliga opponents. And 
unless they produce something miraculous in the next half hour, this tie

GOAL! Gent 0-2 Wolsfburg (Draxler)
 Wolfsburg’s Julian Draxler gets the better of the Gent defenders for his 
second goal. Photograph: Laurent Dubrule/EPA 
53 min: What a player! What a finish! Another loose ball is spilled by Gent’s 
Neto in midfield. Draxler picks up possession centrally. He is one-on-one with 
Mitrovic and nonchalantly nutmegs him. Sels comes off his line and the summer 
signing from Schalke chips him with such ease. A brilliant, brilliant goal even 
if Gent were the architects of their own downfall.

51 min: This is much better from Gent. Simon loses Vieirinha on the left and 
feeds Dejaegere. His shot is blocked out for another corner. Milicevic supplies 
it once more but Casteels is out to save.

90 min +3: Rodriguez wins a free-kick at the back post after being nudged in 
the back by Nielsen. And that is the end of what ended up being quite 
compelling.Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> return to 
Germany with three away goals but they will be disappointed by how things 
ended. Cruising 3-0 thanks to Draxler and Kruse prompted talk of a cricket 
score but Gent finally woke up in the final 10 minutes and scored twice to keep 
the tie alive. Thanks for reading – it was worth sticking around for in the 
end, eh? Until next time, bye!

90 min +3: Träsch wins a corner from it. Kums comes across to the left to take 
it.
 
90 min +2: Can Gent create one more attack? Dante concedes a foul on halfway 
and yellow shirts push forward.
 
90 min +1: Dejaegere overhits a cross to Coulibaly, and that allows Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> an opportunity to waste some 
time. Kruse jogs off slowly to be replaced by Putaro.
 
90 min: There will be three minutes added on. If only it was 30! After a 
prosaic opening 80 minutes, the final 10 have been blistering.

89 min: Oh my, what a turnaround! Coulibaly heads home at the near post, 
getting in front of Dante, to direct home Saief’s cross. The keeper is out of 
position, but this is incredible. Second best and treading water for 80 
minutes, Gent are right back in this.
 
87 min: Coulibaly is caught offside from a Saief cross.
 
85 min: And now Saief goes close. He has been good since coming on. Rodriguez 
clears an initial delivery but only as far as the substitute. He cuts in from 
the left and curls only a couple of inches wide.
 
84 min: Another attempt from Gent. Dejaegere shoots from range. The ball 
swirls and Casteels parries before smothering as Coulibaly raced down on goal. 
If only they had performed like this earlier in the game.
 
83 min: Suddenly Gent are playing ball. Saief picks out Foket, who shoots low 
and across goal. Casteels saves it, unconvincingly.

80 min: Gent have pulled one back! Kums tucks it into the bottom right corner 
but Casteels was weak, failing to get a strong enough hand in front of the 
shot. It’s his 14th goal of the campaign but, you would imagine, nothing more 
than a consolation. Kums got a little lucky when cutting in as Schürrle 
slipped, allowing the Gent captain with the room to shoot.
 
79 min: A sub for either side. Gent’s: Coulibaly is on for Depoitre. For 
Wolfsburg: Vieirinha’s evening is over, replaced by Schäfer.
 
78 min: Gent have had a shot! Asare hits a rasper with the outside of his left 
boot from about 25 yards. Unfortunately for Gent, it is straight down Casteels’ 
throat.
 
77 min: Saief sends a cross from the left towards nobody in particular.
 
74 min: Mitrovic spills another cheap ball, almost allowing Schürrle to break 
free. But the defender recovers well to stop the former Chelsea player from 
pulling the trigger near the ‘D’.
 
72 min: Are Gent the worst team to have reached the knockout stages? It’s 
difficult to think of too many that have been weaker –Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg>, who have been short on 
confidence, look several levels above. Presently: nothing is happening.
 
70 min: This one is petering out already. My best wishes to whoever is tasked 
with MBMing the second leg.
 
66 min: Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> are now 
toying with their hosts, passing the ball around the back under little pressure.
 
64 min: Gent have not stopped trying despite being vastly outclassed. They win 
a corner after a Kums shot is deflected on to the bar and out by Dante. It does 
not amount to a decent chance.
 
62 min: Kruse hits a post! Wolfsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> break as Gent, crestfallen, 
push too far forward. Kruse has acres of space after skipping past Mitrovic in 
the right channel but from a tight angle, his curler beats Sels but not the 
woodwork.

60 min: That’s the tie, folks. From the free-kick Träsch overlaps on the 
right, sending a teasing cross in from near the end-line. Kruse arrives at the 
near-post to tuck in from close range.

A double Gent substitution after the goal: Milicevic is replaced by Saeif. 
Matton is on for Simon.
 
59 min: Kums, the Gent captain, is booked for a frustrated, clumsy tackle from 
Vieirinha about 15 yards inside the hosts’ half.
 
57 min: Gent are just not up to the level of their Bundesliga opponents. And 
unless they produce something miraculous in the next half hour, this tie 
already looks finished with.
  Wolfsburg’s Julian Draxler gets the better of the Gent defenders for his 
second goal. Photograph: Laurent Dubrule/EPA 
53 min: What a player! What a finish! Another loose ball is spilled by Gent’s 
Neto in midfield. Draxler picks up possession centrally. He is one-on-one with 
Mitrovic and nonchalantly nutmegs him. Sels comes off his line and the summer 
signing from Schalke chips him with such ease. A brilliant, brilliant goal even 
if Gent were the architects of their own downfall.
 
51 min: This is much better from Gent. Simon loses Vieirinha on the left and 
feeds Dejaegere. His shot is blocked out for another corner. Milicevic supplies 
it once more but Casteels is out to save.
 
49 min: Simon, dribbling menacingly on the left, wins a corner via Gustavo. 
Milicevic swings the ball in. It is cleared.
 
47 min: Gustavo fouls Dejaegere at right back. He is harshly booked. The 
delivery is saved by Wolfsburg’s stand-in goalkeeper, Casteels. He then 
releases quickly, allowing the visitors to break. Schürrle sends a low cross 
from the right. Foket hooks away.
 
46 min: Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> get us 
going again. It’s immediately sent to Schürrle on the right of the area. He 
blasts over.
 
Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> are back out in the 
freezing conditions; Gent are having a huddle in the tunnel, most likely 
sorting out some issues from that error-plagued first half.
