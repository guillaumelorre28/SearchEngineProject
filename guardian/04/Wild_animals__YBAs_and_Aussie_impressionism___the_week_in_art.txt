 Soul medicine ... Sunflowers by Vincent Van Gogh. Photograph: courtesy of the 
National Gallery, London 
When the Dutch-born Van Gogh made his move from impressionist Paris to the 
Provençal town of Arles, he was transfixed and besotted by the intense colours 
of the south. His sunflowers are his ecstatic response to a yellow so strong 
you can practically taste it. Van Gogh painted this in a rapture of sun 
worship. He hung it in the home he created, the Yellow House, to infuse it with 
redemptive light. This is art as soul medicine.

 Heather Phillipson’s 100% Other Fibres (2016). Photograph: courtesy of the 
artist 
A still from 100% Other Fibres by Heather Phillipson, who won the Jarman prize 
for video art this week. Her work features installations and films, often with 
her own poetry laid over them, and is,she told Adrian Searle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/28/heather-phillipson-jarman-award-video-art-poetry>
, about “anxieties of the present moment ... I think my work has got more and 
more angry and overtly political. Looking back at my old work, there was a 
lovely innocent time when I could make a video about french kissing. Not that 
it was really that, but I didn’t have to think about fascism, that it was on my 
doorstep.”
