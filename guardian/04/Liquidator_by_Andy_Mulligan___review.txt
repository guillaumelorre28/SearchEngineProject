The story opens at the beginning of a school day as a class is given job 
assignments for a week’s work experience. Vicky is late as her brother 
Staggers’ moped breaks down on their way to school.

This means she loses out on the exciting jobs and gets one of the worst 
assignments, an assistant sandwich maker. While working as a sandwich maker at 
the big company she uncovers a deadly truth about them and seeks help from her 
friends. Together they set out on perilous journey to save a boy and expose the 
company’s evil practices.

The story throws light on the fact that many companies are corrupt and will do 
anything to make money, even if that means causing illness and death. The 
company has no morals and it is up to the children to help those affected by 
the company.

 I liked this book because it was exciting, fast-paced and Andy Mulligan 
always shows how clever kids are.
