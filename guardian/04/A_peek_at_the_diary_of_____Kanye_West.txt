Started the day the way I like to: communicating with my fans via my blog. I 
will NEVER forget their potential to be uplifted by what I do. Today I posted 
them the usual design pictures - a skateboard ramp in Holland that is made out 
of Styrofoam and diamonds, and a Japanese coffee table that is also a child. 
INCREDIBLE!!! Then I let them further into the mind of Kanye with a post about 
combs. Combs are incredible - they have been on the scene ever since humans had 
hair, but I was thinking about it last night and mankind would not always have 
had a highly designed comb in the shape of a Walther PPK. Think about it! The 
first combs were probably human fingers! Wait! I'm grossing you out, right, but 
WAIT - COMBS were ONCE FINGERS! But now combs are EVERYWHERE.

I was getting deep into this when an email arrived asking if I was OK after 
they made fun of me on South Park. "OK," I replied. "I'm still laughing so hard 
I'm nearly breaking the keys on my MacBook Air as I type this, and this is such 
a limited-edition model only three people own one - me, Steve Jobs and Obama. 
That's how hard I'm laughing at that BS!!!!"

But think about it. What those South Park boys have done is demean everyone 
who is uplifted by my performances, reminding me I STILL have to fight against 
the system, and The Man's decision to pigeonhole me as a much-decorated musical 
genius. Have some respect, humorists! Just let me be great! Just let me be 
Kanye!!!!!!
