Led Zeppelin may - or, then again, may not - be hitting the road in a reunion 
tour this fall. Mixed messages from guitarist Jimmy Page and singerRobert Plant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/robert-plant> have sparked rumours that the 
legendary group may indeed return to the road.

"I can assure you that the amount of work that we put into [last year's 
concert], for ourselves rehearsing and the staging of it, was probably what you 
put into a world tour," Page told Japanese reporters.

Their one-off London gig in December did not exactly go off like a lead 
balloon: our Alexis Petridis called the concert "awesomely tight" andgave it 
five stars <https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2225610,00.html>. But 
fans had dared not raise their hopes. "There'll be one show and that'll be it," 
Plant had told Uncut in September. The singer has been busy supporting Raising 
Sand, his Grammy-nominated album with American bluegrass star Alison Krauss.

Page acknowledged Plant's dedication to the Krauss project, but in doing so 
let slip the possibility of something later this year. "[He has] a parallel 
project running, and he's really busy with that project, certainly until 
September, so I can't give you any news."

Plant was asked about the band at a basketball game on Friday. "You never know 
what is around the corner," he said, albeit without much enthusiasm. Then 
again, he may just have wanted to be left alone to watch the New York Knicks 
trounce the Philadelphia Sixers.

When asked which Zep song he would choose to pump up the crowd at Madison 
Square Gardens, Plant gave a sideways look before citing the band's 1975 hit 
Kashmir. And as the lyrics say: "They sit and wait and all will be revealed".
