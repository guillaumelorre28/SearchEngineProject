As Oscar hype begins to warm up, About Schmidt, the drama starring Jack 
Nicholson <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jacknicholson>, has won the 
prestigious Los Angeles film critics' association best picture award.

Nicholson - no stranger to acting honours - also shared the best actor award 
with Daniel Day-Lewis, who won for Gangs of New York. About Schmidt's director, 
Election's Alexander Payne, missed out on the best director award. That was 
given to Pedro Almodovar for Talk To Her.

Julianne Moore was named best actress for Far From Heaven, an honour she can 
now add to the one she received for the same film at Venice.

Other winners included Chris Cooper (best supporting actor for Adaptation), 
Edie Falco (best supporting actress, for Sunshine State) and Y Tu Mama Tambien 
as best foreign language film. Scotswoman Lynne Ramsay kept British hopes 
afloat with the New Generation award for her dramas Ratcatcher and Morven 
Callar.

The awards, which were announced over the weekend, will be presented in 
January.
