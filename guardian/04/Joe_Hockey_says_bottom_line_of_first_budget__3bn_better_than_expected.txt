The Labor MP Ed Husic taunted Hockey about his future during question time on 
Thursday, asking what he had planned for his third budget, due in May next year.

Hockey replied that “whatever’s planned for the third budget is a hell of a 
lot better than Labor’s last budget” and that the former government “was a 
fiscal disaster and an economic disaster for Australia”.

He then pre-empted a statement he was due to make at the end of question time 
about the final budget outcome for the 2014-15 financial year. The full details 
are to be released on Monday.

“I have been informed by the Treasury of the final budget outcome for our 
first budget and that is that the budget bottom line is $3bn better than what 
we expected at budget time,” Hockey said.

“The government is spending nearly $3bn less than forecast and net government 
debt is reduced by $11.5bn more than we expected.”

Hockey’s wife, Melissa Babbage, was seen in the public gallery for question 
time.

In May 2015 Hockey estimated

underlying cash deficit of $41.1bn for the 2014-15 financial year. On Thursday 
his office said the final outcome was $38bn.


Labor pointed out that the new deficit figure was still $14bn worse than the 
$24bn estimated for 2014-15 in thepre-election fiscal and economic outlook

, which was was signed off by the secretaries of the Treasury and the 
Department of Finance before the 2013 election.

Despite revealing the headline figures, Hockey said in a statement that the 
final budget outcome document was some days off being published. “The final 
budget outcome will be released in full on Monday morning,” he said, arguing 
the figures showed the government was heading in the right direction.

The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the selective release of the figures 
was “a final humiliating blow for the treasurer”.

“The final budget outcome won’t be released until Monday with the swearing-in 
of the new treasurer,” Bowen said.

“The time-honoured tradition is for [it] to be released publicly and the 
treasurer and finance minister to hold a press conference to explain and answer 
questions on the outcomes.”

Hockey is widely expected to lose his Treasury portfolio in the looming 
reshuffle. He made a public pitch for his colleagues to maintain their support 
for Abbott before the Liberal party room met forthe leadership showdown on 
Monday

.


On Wednesday Hockey declined to speculate on his future but said he had been 
in discussions with the new prime minister and was continuing to do his job to 
his best ability. He would not say whether he had been offered another 
portfolio but said he was “instinctively a loyal person”.

Morrison declined to comment on whether he had been offered the position of 
treasurer, saying Turnbull would “make his comments about these things in his 
time”.

“I will do whatever I can to serve the government by serving the Australian 
people, by doing the best job I can do in whatever task I’m given, wherever 
that may be,” he said on Thursday.

Morrison, who has faced criticism from rightwing supporters of the party for 
not calling on his supporters to lock in behind Abbott’s leadership, reaffirmed 
he had voted for Abbott in the ballot.

“Events took a different course and the same focus that I’ve applied in past 
roles I will apply to whatever future role the prime minister would now have me 
to serve in.”
