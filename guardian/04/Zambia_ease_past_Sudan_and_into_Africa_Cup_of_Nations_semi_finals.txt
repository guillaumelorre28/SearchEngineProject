Zambia reached their first Africa Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> semi-finals in 16 
years after a clinical 3-0 win over struggling 10-man Sudan.

Stophira Sunzu headed in from a free-kick in the 15th minute and Christopher 
Katongo made it 2-0 in the 66th when he scored from the rebound after his 
penalty was saved. The substitute James Chamanga sealed Zambia's dominance in 
the 86th with a curling shot from the edge of the area that went in off the 
post.

Sudan's hopes of an upset slipped away when the defender Saif Eldin Ali Idris 
was sent off in the 65th minute for a reckless foul on Rainford Kalaba that led 
to Katongo's penalty. By then the Sudanese had already been forced into two 
first-half substitutions because of injury before Ali Idris went for his second 
bookable offense.

Zambia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/zambia> could have won by an even 
bigger margin but the Sudan goalkeeper Akram El Hadi Salem, who had a busy 
night, dived full length to his right to save a stoppage-time effort that 
appeared destined for the net.

Sunzu rose high at the near post to beat Akram for the opener after a free 
kick out wide from Isaac Chansa. Katongo hit his right-footed penalty straight 
at Akram, who save it one-handed, but the Zambia captain followed up to poke 
home with his left foot for 2-0.

Chamanga's goal was the pick of the three as he controlled neatly and sent a 
curling right-footed effort toward the far corner that was too good for Akram.

Before the match, both sets of players and officials observed a minute's 
silence in a mark of respect for the more than 70 people killed at a football 
riot in Egypt this week. Zambia will play the winner of Ghana v Tunisia.
