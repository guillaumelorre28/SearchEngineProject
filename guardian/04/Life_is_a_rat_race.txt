Under pressure

From an anonymous teen
Dear Carole, I'm in 6th form and ever since GCSE revision I feel I have been 
on a treadmill. I have to compete in sport against other schools, I've got 
A-level revision now and college or university is ahead of me, and thus more 
and more exams to pass, then job-hunting in a recession and more competition. 
Where is the fun in all this? Who decided this is the way society should be 
run? Do I have an alternative? I just want to enjoy my life without all this 
pressure.

Carole replies:
I hear you. Primates are hierarchical and the higher up the hierarchy you are 
the better your chances of survival. We compete with each other over access to 
food, access to mates and access to safe sleeping sites. Available resources 
rarely meet the demands made by wild primates or indeed humans and thus 
competition is a way of life. It is usually more physically intense among males 
than females.

If it's any consolation, if you were someone born during a baby-boom era (such 
as the 1960s and late 1980s in the UK 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-World_War_II_baby_boom#In_the_United_Kingdom>
) the competition would be even more intense. Research has shown that baby 
boomers are more likely to experience aggression and risk-taking than others in 
less competitive environments.

The generation you were born into will age with you and journey through life 
alongside you. In your email you clearly highlight various stages of 
competition. This is ongoing. In old age you will again compete with your 
generation for the best accommodation in old folks homes.

At first glance hippy trails, communes and alternative societies offer escape 
from competition with your fellow primates. Experimental economists study the 
Amish because members of this group obey rules of cooperation that mutually 
benefit each other and minimise competition. For example, all able-bodied Amish 
men work as a team to build a house for a newly married couple.

But due to inbreeding the Amish suffer a higher than average incidence of 
genetic disorders, such as dwarfism, and due to their practice of strict 
patriarchy there is an increased prevalence of sexual and physical abuse 
against Amish women and children.

Alternative societies are rarely fun utopias for long – if ever.

Western society consists of systems within systems and to succeed among your 
peers these rules must be followed and at various stages you will be tested and 
forced to compete against them. I think it is fair to say that not a lot of 
"fun" was factored into the machine.

Oh, to run away from it all! But where would you go? You are a primate and you 
cannot run from that.

All primate species are hierarchical. Accounts of the Machiavellian social 
politics of wild apes are Shakespearean in their plotting and complexity. But 
your primate cousinsdo make time for fun. Field primatologists have for years 
reported accounts of the apes they study forming close bonds, laughing, playing 
and tickling each other. Love, friendship and pleasure can all be observed in 
ape behaviour.

So, find friends who share your taste in what constitutes fun. You are born a 
competitive primate, but you are also born to have fun – you just need to make 
time for it.

Some people just don't care

From an anonymous female, no age given
Dear Carole, Why is it that some people just don't seem to care about others, 
and some people care so much? Is it just the people who seem not to care are 
ignorant of the problems around them or are some people not able to empathise, 
or are more selfish? I feel very hurt by my friends and relatives when they 
dont seem to care. How can I stop this feeling of hurt?

Carole replies:
Some believe the "three wise monkeys" of Eastern folklore, who see no evil, 
hear no evil and speak no evil, are wise because they prioritise themselves 
while ignoring the needs of others. Certainly this is one survival strategy in 
the game of life.

Yes, some people are intentionally selfish while others are just not wired for 
altruism and have to be taught the rules of cooperation. Cooperation is 
essential to all primate species, and has contributed to the success of Homo 
sapiens, but there is also great variation within species and not all humans 
are equal in their empathic abilities.

If you are empathic you will be aware when others cannot access your depth of 
concern and this will leave you disappointed and isolated. If we all acted with 
each others' best interests at heart the world would be quite different, but in 
the end the only person you can change is yourself.

Make sure you spend time with other primates who match your depth of 
sensitivity and try to accept those whose altruism goes no further than their 
immediate blood relatives.

If you are someone who spontaneously gives on demand you may take on too many 
causes and too many waifs and strays and become overwhelmed. So try to channel 
your goodwill into existing charities and pressure groups. This way you can 
keep the scale of your giving within reasonable limits. You matter too you know.
