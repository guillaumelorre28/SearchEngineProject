The senior editors of Ireland's largest-selling daily newspaper are being 
threatened with imprisonment. The country's director of public prosecutions is 
seeking an order to commit the editor-in-chief of theIrish Independent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/irish-independent>, Stephen Rae, and its 
editor, Claire Grady, to prison for contempt of court.

At a Dublin high court hearing on Monday (21 July), the DPP also sought the 
sequestration of the assets of the paper's publisher, Independent News & Media 
(INM).

The legal action concerns material published by the Independent the previous 
Thursday (17 July), headlined"Anglo: The new tapes revealed" 
<http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/anglo/anglo-the-new-tapes-revealed-30438478.html>
, and on two subsequent days.

The articles were a further twist in a long-running story about the 
controversy surrounding the collapse of theAnglo Irish Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/anglo-irish-bank>. They revealed details 
of a taped conversation between the bank's then chief executive and another 
senior executive.

Ireland's prosecutor claimed the publishing of the material prejudiced the 
proper administration of justice in relation to criminal trials pending against 
former Anglo officials. It amounted to a breach of the sub judice principle.

For its part, the Irish Independent denied that it was in contempt of court.

After initial submissions, the president of the high court, Mr Justice 
Nicholas Kearns, briefly adjourned the hearing to allow discussions between the 
two sides.

When it resumed, he was told that the Independent had agreed to remove certain 
portions of the Anglo tapes from its website, without prejudice to its position.

The judge then adjourned the matter until tomorrow (Friday).
