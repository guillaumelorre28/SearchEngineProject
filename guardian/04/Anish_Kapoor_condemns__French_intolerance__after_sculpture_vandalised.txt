The British artist Anish Kapoor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kapoor>, whose sculpture placed at 
the Palace of Versailles became known as the “queen’s vagina”, has lashed out 
at French “intolerance” after his work was vandalised. The work, entitled Dirty 
Corner, was on Wednesday found sprayed with yellow paint and is now being 
cleaned by palace authorities.

“If this act of vandalism means anything, it speaks more to a certain 
intolerance in France than to art itself,”Kapoor said in an interview with Le 
Figaro on Thursday.

 “The problem seems more political than anything else.”

The 60-metre (200ft) long, 10-metre high, rusty steel sculpture by the 
British-Indian sculptor resembles a funnel in the form of an orifice, and is 
set up in a garden facing the royal chateau, which attracts five million 
tourists a year. In the nearby Salle du Jeu de Paume is his smaller work, 
Shooting into the Corner, a wax-firing cannon that some say symbolises a 
phallus and an ejaculation of blood.

Some French media outlets have expressed unease at the level of provocation 
unleashed by Kapoor. So far no one has claimed responsibility for vandalising 
the sculpture.

The French culture minister, Fleur Pellerin, said the vandalism was “an attack 
on the freedom to create” and stressed her support for the artist.
