Full-time: Equatorial Guinea 0-3 Ghana, eventually

There is no doubt that Ghana deserve their place in the final, where they will 
meet Ivory Coast in what could be a classic contest, assuming it goes ahead 
without a hitch. The consequences of the violence that forced a delay in this 
semi-final will be worth following. Equatorial Guinea should be banned, but it 
might not be a good idea to make such a decision before they host the final, 
especially with Equatorial Guinea scheduled to play DR Congo in the 
third-placed playoff. On the other hand, it would perhaps be a senseless risk 
to letEquatorial Guinea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea>
 play again so soon after this dangerous fiasco. Tough decision ahead for CAF.

90+2 min: There is an understandable - indeed, perfectly sensible - lack of 
intensity to the play now. The priority seems to be to just wrap up this game 
formally and then get the hell out of there.

90 min: The official clock in the corner of the TV screen said play actually 
resumed in the 90th minute. Even some time seems to have got lost during the 
forced break.

86 min: The plot thickens. It now seems that play will not resume. The ref and 
players seemed poised to perform the dropped back for about 60 seconds, but 
then the ref was beckoned over to the sidelines by chaps in suits - presumably 
CAF officials - and agitated discussions are taking place. It is not apparent 
who is in charge, nor what will happen.

86 min: Well this is a turn-up. After an interlude of about half an hour, play 
is resuming with a dropped ball. It’s not clear what is happening in the 
stands, but reports suggest that the trouble-makers have been driven outside. 
Quite what is going on out there - and what will go on out here later - is even 
less clear.

The players, ref and assistants are still standing in the middle of the pitch. 
I don’t know whether that means that they still hope that the match can resume 
or simply that they cannot find a safe route to the dressing rooms.
 Police evacuate a tribune as the match is halted eight minutes from time.

Ghanaian fans being moved into stand in front of press-box. Not sure how wise 
- if fans still in tier above us, they'll be sitting ducks.

According to various reports, trouble is now brewing outside the stadium: many 
people of dubious intent have apparently gathered near the exists and are 
suspected to be waiting to ambush Ghanaian fans. I hope those reports were 
wrong, or that sufficient security forces are in place to prevent this 
deteriorating...
 This is how Ghana’s John Boye left the field at the end of the first half.

From what the TV cameras are showing, many of the fans have left the stadium. 
But apparently not the one causing trouble, judging by the way the Ghanaian 
fans who were attacked are still huddling behind the goal at one hand, clearly 
not prepared to return to where they had been. A helicopter is still hovering 
over the pitch, though stewards seem to be waving the home players back on to 
the pitch.

There is a kerfuffle on the pitch now as several Equatoguinean players 
surround a couple of CAF officials in much the same way that they kept 
surrounding the ref earlier on. They are evidently unhappy about a decision, 
which suggests the organisers may have resolved to abandon the game. But maybe 
not. Nothing is clear at the moment.

The cameras still are not showing anything other than the players and 
officials standing and hoping. But there are sounds of helicopters in the sky, 
which suggests a significant security is under way operation to restore order. 
The fault for this lies, of course, with the people throwing stuff and 
perpetrating whatever other sort of mayhem we are not being shown. But the
Equatorial Guinea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea> 
players cannot claim to have shown a good example of sportsmanship, having 
fouled, acted and bickered ever since it became clear they were not good enough 
to win the match. It’s a real pity how this is ending.

Players and officials are still standing on the pitch. They are obviously 
hoping they can play out the remaining six minutes or so but it is hard to know 
how likely that is, as the cameras are not showing what is going on at the end 
of the stadium where the trouble seemed to be.

84 min: Oh dear. This is what we feared: the referee has picked up the ball 
and asked the police to restore order as fans spill on to the edge of one end 
of the pitch. There are suggestions that they are Ghanaian fans seeking safety 
after being bombarded by bottles and other objects, but the situation is not at 
all clear.

GOAL! Equatorial Guinea 0-3 Ghana (Andre Ayew 75)

Another fine goal, Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> expertly 
taking advantage of their hosts’ disintegration. Ovono stalled an attack with 
charge from his goal but Appiah regathered the ball and picked out Ayew in the 
middle, leaving the Marseille man with the easy task of stroking it into the 
net from five yards.

Wakaso as he tries to take it. Eventually the debris is cleared from the pitch 
and he sends a weak delivery to the first defender.

68 min: It is not clear which Equatorial Guinea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea> are pursuing more 
eagerly: a goal, or a red card for Ghana? Cringe-worthy acting from them now 
almost every time there is physical contact.

58 min: Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> are regularly 
threatening on the counter-attack as the hosts send more players forward in 
search of a route back into the game. Ovono has to rush off his line again to

46 min: The teams are back on the pitch. Let’s hope they get to finish the 
game. This tweet from Jonathan Wilson gives an idea of how the atmosphere seems 
to be degenerating :

There is no doubt that Ghana deserve their place in the final, where they will 
meet Ivory Coast in what could be a classic contest, assuming it goes ahead 
without a hitch. The consequences of the violence that forced a delay in this 
semi-final will be worth following. Equatorial Guinea should be banned, but it 
might not be a good idea to make such a decision before they host the final, 
especially with Equatorial Guinea scheduled to play DR Congo in the 
third-placed playoff. On the other hand, it would perhaps be a senseless risk 
to letEquatorial Guinea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea>
 play again so soon after this dangerous fiasco. Tough decision ahead for CAF.

90+2 min: There is an understandable - indeed, perfectly sensible - lack of 
intensity to the play now. The priority seems to be to just wrap up this game 
formally and then get the hell out of there.
 
90 min: The official clock in the corner of the TV screen said play actually 
resumed in the 90th minute. Even some time seems to have got lost during the 
forced break.
 
86 min: It’s on! After a powwow of about one minute, the ref walks over, drops 
the ball and the game is back on.
 
86 min: The plot thickens. It now seems that play will not resume. The ref and 
players seemed poised to perform the dropped back for about 60 seconds, but 
then the ref was beckoned over to the sidelines by chaps in suits - presumably 
CAF officials - and agitated discussions are taking place. It is not apparent 
who is in charge, nor what will happen.
 
86 min: Well this is a turn-up. After an interlude of about half an hour, play 
is resuming with a dropped ball. It’s not clear what is happening in the 
stands, but reports suggest that the trouble-makers have been driven outside. 
Quite what is going on out there - and what will go on out here later - is even 
less clear.

The players, ref and assistants are still standing in the middle of the pitch. 
I don’t know whether that means that they still hope that the match can resume 
or simply that they cannot find a safe route to the dressing rooms.

Ghanaian fans being moved into stand in front of press-box. Not sure how wise 
- if fans still in tier above us, they'll be sitting ducks.

According to various reports, trouble is now brewing outside the stadium: many 
people of dubious intent have apparently gathered near the exists and are 
suspected to be waiting to ambush Ghanaian fans. I hope those reports were 
wrong, or that sufficient security forces are in place to prevent this 
deteriorating...

From what the TV cameras are showing, many of the fans have left the stadium. 
But apparently not the one causing trouble, judging by the way the Ghanaian 
fans who were attacked are still huddling behind the goal at one hand, clearly 
not prepared to return to where they had been. A helicopter is still hovering 
over the pitch, though stewards seem to be waving the home players back on to 
the pitch.
 
Most of the Equatoguinean squad are on the running track around the pitch at 
the end of the ground where the trouble is, pleading with fans to calm down.

There is a kerfuffle on the pitch now as several Equatoguinean players 
surround a couple of CAF officials in much the same way that they kept 
surrounding the ref earlier on. They are evidently unhappy about a decision, 
which suggests the organisers may have resolved to abandon the game. But maybe 
not. Nothing is clear at the moment.

them with its draught.

The cameras still are not showing anything other than the players and 
officials standing and hoping. But there are sounds of helicopters in the sky, 
which suggests a significant security is under way operation to restore order. 
The fault for this lies, of course, with the people throwing stuff and 
perpetrating whatever other sort of mayhem we are not being shown. But the
Equatorial Guinea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea> 
players cannot claim to have shown a good example of sportsmanship, having 
fouled, acted and bickered ever since it became clear they were not good enough 
to win the match. It’s a real pity how this is ending.

Players and officials are still standing on the pitch. They are obviously 
hoping they can play out the remaining six minutes or so but it is hard to know 
how likely that is, as the cameras are not showing what is going on at the end 
of the stadium where the trouble seemed to be.

84 min: Oh dear. This is what we feared: the referee has picked up the ball 
and asked the police to restore order as fans spill on to the edge of one end 
of the pitch. There are suggestions that they are Ghanaian fans seeking safety 
after being bombarded by bottles and other objects, but the situation is not at 
all clear.
 
82 min: Acheampong ducks to avoid some hurled object as he waits on the 
sideline before coming on in place of Andre Ayew.
 
80 min: After the ball breaks loose at the edge of the Ghanaian box, Doualla 
attempts a reprise of Yaya Touré stonking goal for Ivory Coast last night. But 
it’s poor cover version, ballooning into the stand.
 
78 min: There have been five yellow cards so far and that is because the ref 
has been quite lenient: Mbele, for instance, could have had at least a couple 
by now, including for a brutal lunge at Appiah just now.Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> players will have to keep their 
wits about them to avoid injury here if their hosts’ mood darkens...

Another fine goal, Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> expertly 
taking advantage of their hosts’ disintegration. Ovono stalled an attack with 
charge from his goal but Appiah regathered the ball and picked out Ayew in the 
middle, leaving the Marseille man with the easy task of stroking it into the 
net from five yards.
 
70 min: Freekick to Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> wide on 
the left after Kike tugs back Appiah. A bottle is chucked from the crowd at 
Wakaso as he tries to take it. Eventually the debris is cleared from the pitch 
and he sends a weak delivery to the first defender.
 
68 min: It is not clear which Equatorial Guinea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea> are pursuing more 
eagerly: a goal, or a red card for Ghana? Cringe-worthy acting from them now 
almost every time there is physical contact.
 
66 min: Andre Ayew booked for a mistimed but entirely well-intentioned tackle 
on Kike, who goes rolling as if pushed down a hill.
 
63 min: Lovely exchange between Jordan Ayew and Atsu, before Mbele makes a 
critical interception to deprive Appiah of the opportunity to tap into the net 
from close range.
 
62 min: Rahmann joins in a Ghana attack and picks out Jordan Ayew with a good 
low ball from the left. But Ayew mis-controls and givesEquatorial Guinea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea> a chance to romp 
forward in that helter-skelter way of theirs.
 
60 min: Becker has introduced the giant striker Raul Fabiani instead of 
defender Evuy as he seeks to stimulate a comeback.
 
58 min: Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> are regularly 
threatening on the counter-attack as the hosts send more players forward in 
search of a route back into the game. Ovono has to rush off his line again to 
deny a forward, and his intervention is well-timed.
 
57 min: Wakaso, for the second time in the game, is caught in possession just 
outside his own box. SuddenlyEquatorial Guinea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/equitorial-guinea> have a chance to 
revive the game, but Balboa dabbed a feeble shot way wide after being teed up 
by Nsue.
 
55 min: Mensah heads a freekick back across the face of goal and Andre Ayew 
has a simple opportunity to nod in from close range - but he fails to 
anticipate properly and flicks his header wide!
 
52 min: Ghana come roaring forward on the counter-attack after Iban Edu 
botches a corner. Wakaso has a variety of options andGhana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> should score a third ... but 
Wakaso overhits an easy pass, donking it back to the keeper.
 
51 min: Nsue tries to lead an Equatoguinean fightback in the right sense, 
careering down the wing and curling in a wicked cross that causes momentary 
bother in the Ghanaian defence before it’s put behind for a corner.

49 min: You wouldn’t like to speculate about what will happen if Ghana score a 
third here - but Jordan Ayew is doing his best to find out. He raced into the 
box and had a shot from a tight angle put out for a corner. The hosts clear it 
well, butGhana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> come back at them 
again...
 
47 min: The atmosphere in the ground is very tense ... but Ghanaian goalkeeper 
Razak appears to have brought protection with him for the second half: he’s 
just stationed plastic Spider-man figurine. beside his goal.
 
46 min: The teams are back on the pitch. Let’s hope they get to finish the 
game. This tweet from Jonathan Wilson gives an idea of how the atmosphere seems 
to be degenerating :
