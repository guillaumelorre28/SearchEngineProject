Palladian Design: The Good, the Bad and the Unexpected 
<https://www.architecture.com/Explore/ExhibitionsandEvents/PalladianDesign/PalladianDesign.aspx>

From the stately dome of the US Capitol in Washington DC to the rugged 
concrete columns of a recently built cowshed in Somerset, the influence of 
Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio persists across centuries and continents, 
his lasting legacy often found in the most unlikely places. Organised by the 
Royal Institute of British Architects, which owns the vast majority of 
Palladio’s surviving drawings, this exhibition will shine a spotlight on how 
Palladian style began and proliferated, bringing together a fascinating range 
of models and pattern books that influenced the design of buildings from New 
Delhi to St Petersburg.Oliver Wainwright

Bridget Riley: Learning from Seurat 
<http://courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/what-on/exhibitions-displays/bridget-riley-learning-from-seurat>


Two great artists bounce and fizz off each other in an exhibition that 
compares Bridget Riley’s early masterpieces of abstract art with the 
19th-century painter who helped inspire them: Georges Seurat. Too often Seurat 
is summed up in a word – “pointillism” or the use of little dots – or even just 
seen as a slightly pixelated impressionist. In fact, his fractured, pulsing, 
eerily still fields of light and colour teeter on the edge of abstraction and 
anticipate 20th-century science as well as art. Perhaps what he and Riley have 
in common is that scientific sensibility; that interest in how the eye works 
and how we mix the colours of reality in our minds. This promises to be another 
in this little gallery’s run of outstanding shows.Jonathan Jones

Groundbreaking attempt to place pop art in its global context or another 
rehash of familiar names and images? The World Goes Pop examines not so much a 
movement as a variety of responses to culture under capitalism and consumer 
culture. With artists from Brazil to the former Yugoslavia, Japan to Colombia, 
and an emphasis on women, The World Goes Pop focuses on figures often written 
out of the story: the overlooked, the ignored and the marginal. Everything is 
pop, even when it isn’t.Adrian Searle

Zanele Muholi: Vukani/Rise 
<http://www.openeye.org.uk/?post_type=mainexhibition&p=6289>

Following her shortlisting for this year’s Deutsche Börse photography prize, 
South African photographer and visual activist Zanele Muholi receives her first 
major UK exhibition. Three recent series trace Muholi’s continuing engagement 
with gender, race and politics in her native country, alongside her most 
well-known project, Faces and Phases (2006–2015). The latter comprises over 200 
portraits of black lesbians and transgender men alongside often visceral video 
and audio testimonies of the hate crimes and violence, including so-called 
corrective rapes, directed against them. An invaluable archive of a defiant 
community that is complemented by a smaller series, Brave Beauties (2013–2014), 
in which the body is celebrated in a more flamboyant, but always tender, style.

Ai Weiwei <https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/ai-weiwei>

Straddling the poetic and the political, Ai Weiwei’s work is trouble. 
Sculptor, conceptualist, architect, blogger, top-level blackjack player and 
critic of corruption and social injustice, Ai is the most famous and outspoken 
artist to emerge from post-revolutionary China. This has led him into serious 
difficulties in his homeland, including a period of detention, the removal of 
his passport and the demolition of his Shanghai studio by the authorities. For 
all that, as an artist Ai is a maker of beautiful, sorrowful and acerbic 
things. This long-overdue survey should allow us to focus more on the art, less 
on the man.AS

Celts <http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/celts/history.aspx>

This is a very timely look at the very fabric of British identity – not to 
mention the brooches, illuminated gospels and swirly designs on shields and 
Celtic crosses. Many of us call ourselves Celts. In political history, the 
“Celtic fringe” was once taken for granted. Now that the British nation state 
suddenly looks so much less stable and enduring, the reality of the Celtic 
stream in our history deserves a fresh look. This exhibition sets out to show 
that “Celt” is a cultural construct, not an ethnicity. The word has been used 
with different meanings, and is as much a modern myth as a historical reality. 
We may not be who we think we are, after all. But just get a load of those 
whorls and whirls and cool helmets.JJ

Sex and death – what else is there to make art about? Oh yes, drugs. Other 
Young British Artists who came to prominence in the 1990s have since either 
“grown up” or tried to and failed (stay out of the painting shed, Damien), but
Mat Collishaw <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/mat-collishaw> has 
remained true to what might be called the ideals of that provocative 
generation. He still tackles shocking subjects, from last meals on death row to 
City cocaine-taking, with a brazen bravado. His photographs, films and objects 
dwell on the morbid and the sleazy with a dedication worthy of Baudelaire. This 
artist is bad for you.JJ

Palestinian artist and film-maker Emily Jacir focuses on migrations and 
returns, losses and restitution. The first UK survey of her films, photographs 
and installations has at its heart her Material for a Film (2004), an immersive 
installation focusing on the assassination of Palestinian writer Wael Zuaiter 
by Mossad agents in 1972, and her search for the writer through the traces he 
left. Other works pursue journeys begun and diverted, projects abandoned, 
troubled histories unpicked with great poignancy and an affecting lightness of

Following 2013’s inaugural edition, the second Diffusion festival is subtitled 
Looking for America. Among the highlights are a group show, And Now It’s Dark, 
which looks at the night photography of contemporary American photographers 
like Todd Hido, Jeff Brouws and Will Steacy. Kentuckian Stacy Kranitz presents 
As It Was Given to Me, which contrasts the lives of a beleaguered mining 
community in south Wales with their counterparts in rural Appalachia, while 
Clémentine Schneidermann unveils her intriguingly titled series, I Called Her 
Lisa Marie, focusing on Elvis obsessives in Memphis and Porthcawl.SOH

A thought-provoking look at how photographs have been used as evidence in 
crime investigations and war crimes tribunals and as state records of those 
sentenced to death during political purges. Ranging from the earliest use of 
photography to assist police investigations in the late 19th century, to images 
of drone strikes in Pakistan in 2012 and the indiscriminate destruction of Gaza 
in 2009, the exhibition highlights the often-contested nature of photographic

Goya: The Portraits <http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/content/conWebDoc/3488>

Realist, caricaturist, critic and lover, Goya’s confrontations with royalty, 
politicians, doctors, lovers, children and, most tellingly, himself are filled 
with cruelty and empathy, humour and affection. He is unsurpassable, and the 
flaws in his art make it even more wrenching. Goya’s portraiture deserves a

be the first exhibition to focus entirely on this side of his work.AS

to? Is Hirst now trying to become Britain’s most influential art collector and 
redefine taste? Hoyland is not exactly one of Hirst’s own generation, so this 
suggests a wide-ranging approach by Hirst the collectorWho knows: perhaps he 
will have the kind of impact as a collector and gallerist that a certain

Frank Auerbach 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/frank-auerbach>

There are many artists who are flashy, sensational and entertaining. There are 
not many who dig down into the substance of life as tenaciously asFrank Auerbach
 <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/frank-auerbach>. The sheer lust for 
life that ruts and ripens Auerbach’s paintings is as powerful as London itself, 
the city whose streets and parks provide his only subject, along with intense 
portraits of friends. His style cannot be emulated because it is not a style. 
The massive textures and trench-like clay colours of Auerbach’s grasping, 
searching works are not mannered effects, but the visible process of a painter 
wrestling with what he sees and feels. Authenticity is in fashion, they tell 
me. Here is an authentic modern master.JJ

A chapel that stands among the rolling landscapes of Yorkshire Sculpture 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/sculpture> Park provides a perfect 
setting for part of this retrospective of the pioneering video artist. Viola is 
daring and unusual among contemporary artists in the forthright way he engages 
with religion. The spiritual art of the past echoes in his work – martyrs, 
triptychs, meditation, all that sacred jazz. But it is not (necessarily) an art 
of belief. Rather, this Californian artist is fascinated by the loneliness and 
insight of the saint and the mystic, by the varieties of religious experience. 
Out of this real emotional quest he has arguably created the most serious and 
worthwhile work ever done in the name of video art.JJ

 Bacchus by Cy Twombly Photograph: Tate 
Cy Twombly <http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/cy-twombly--october-10-2015>

The greatest painter since Jackson Pollock was a paradoxical genius who ranged 
from the gutter to the gods. His art is at once earthy and sexy, and fraught 
with the burdens of history. Twombly is simultaneously an abstract artist and a 
poetic storyteller. Dealer extraordinaire Larry Gagosian has picked the most 
marvellous artist on his books for the first exhibition at his new gallery in 
Mayfair, London. It includes previously unseen paintings from Twombly’s Bacchus 
series, in which he finds a sensual, graffiti-like analogy for the irrational 
power and frenzy associated with the ancient Greek god of wine. What an artist.

Described by the artist as an “anti-survey”, this look back at over 25 years 
of art-making should be a rumbustious affair. War movies and fonts, fighter 
planes and life models have provided the materials for written drawings and 
sculpted full stops, balletic wind-socks, and furious and gigantic novels. The

warzone photographs of London’s financial district. Banner is a tough and

Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tate-modern-turbine-hall> commissions 
are always sprung upon us. One year sunflower seeds, another year slides or 
sunsets. Now with a new sponsor, Hyundai, the annual series recommences with 
Mexican artist Abraham Cruzvillegas’s Empty Lot. Working with the near-to-hand, 
and an acknowledgement of the necessary, improvisational way in which rural 
Mexicans build houses – and lives – for themselves in the city, Cruzvillegas’s 
art is both sculptural and conceptual, founded in both materiality and 
necessity. This attitude ofautoconstrucción (self-construction) is also at the 
heart of Cruzvillegas’s art. Go on, surprise me.AS

Frieze <http://friezelondon.com/> and Frieze Masters 
<http://friezemasters.com/>

The dynamism, unexpectedness and sheer abundance of the art market makes these 
art fairs a window on the new – and the old. From the latest sensation to the 
oldest masterpiece, there will be plenty to entertain, irritate and make you 
drop your jaw in amazement. London’s galleries are diverse as well as 
energetic. Look out for real experts in their fields among the dealers, like 
modern print connoisseur Alan Cristea and bronze-sculpture authority Daniel 
Katz. But the whole international art world, and not just London, is on view at 
Frieze. Even if you find a lot of it plutocratic nonsense, you will see 
something stupendous, or delicate, or mind-expanding. It’s friezonomics.JJ

Lee Miller: A Woman’s War 
<http://www.iwm.org.uk/exhibitions/iwm-london/lee-miller-a-woman-s-war>

Yet another Lee Miller exhibition, but this one looks at the impact of the 
second world war on women’s lives though her portraits and photojournalism. 
According to the IWM’s press release, this is the first exhibition to “address 
Miller’s vision of gender” – if, of course, she ever consciously had “a vision 
of gender”. Either way, we are promised many images, objects and personal items 
never exhibited before. A treat, then, for fans of one of the great 
photojournalists.SOH

The World of Charles and Ray Eames 
<http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=18398>

“Take your pleasure seriously” was the advice given to any new recruit to the 
office of Charles and Ray Eames, the American duo who defined an era of postwar 
optimism and experimentation in design. The pleasure they took in their own 
work, which ranged far beyond their famous fibreglass and bentwood furniture, 
to film-making, animation and exhibition design, will be palpable in this 
extensive exhibition, whose curators have delved deep into the 1m-strong 
collection of the Eames Office archive to paint a comprehensive picture of 
their unparalleled output.OW

Faith After the Pharaohs 
<http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/faith_after_the_pharaohs.aspx>

Egypt is the home to a diverse religious history has generated extraordinary 
art. Coptic Christianity has its own unique style, with touching, almost naive 
portraits and manuscripts, ancient monasteries and churches. This minority 
tradition has coexisted with the majority religion, Islam, whose own 
architectural and artistic splendour shapes the best-preserved quarters of 
Egyptian cities. Yet there is also a rich Jewish history in the country, and 
this, too, is explored. Not only does it show that Egypt has carried on being a 
great cultural centre long after the age of thepyramids: it also reminds us of 
the complexity and pluralism of life, art and history in the Middle East.JJ

Theaster Gates: Sanctum <http://sanctumbristol.com>

For 24 days, the medieval ruins of Bristol’s Temple Church, bombed in 1940, 
are going to come alive with the voices and sounds, beats and songs of the 
city. Theaster Gates’ first public project in the UK follows his extraordinary 
interventions in his Chicago hometown and in a destroyed Huguenot house in 
Kassel. Gates wants the church ruins to resonate with sound, round the clock, 
for 576 hours. Gates’ public projects are sites for protest and celebration, 
and have a therapeutic, spiritual core. Above all, they’ve got soul. An 
unmissable treat.AS

 Antennae with Red and Blue Dots by Alexander Calder 
Alexander Calder: Performing Sculpture 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/alexander-calder-performing-sculpture>


Why should sculpture be still and why should it stand on the floor or a 
plinth? Like a tinkering artistic version of Edison or the Wright brothers, 
this great American sculptor asked basic, brave questions and found inventive 
answers to them. Calder’s most famous invention is the mobile – a loose 
constellation of coloured shapes suspended by wire or thread and gently moving 
in free space. Calder’s mobiles resemble three-dimensional animations of his 
friend Joan Miró’s surrealist paintings, but they also, surely, mirror the 
subatomic worlds that were being discovered by quantum physics in the 1920s and 
1930s. He also created, among other delights, a mercury fountain and 
fantastical furniture. Calder is the engineer of human dreams.JJ

Enrico David <http://www.hepworthwakefield.org/whatson/enrico-david/>

It was only with his staged assembly of improbable, flopping, rearing figures 
in the 2009Turner prize <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/turnerprize> 
that I began to get Italian-born sculptor and installationist Enrico David. He 
has moved on, but there is still an element of the farcical in his subsequent 
paintings and sculptures. Ribald and scatological, mournful and jesting, 
David’s work grows richer with time. A game of sculptural manners, materials 
and scale, and working between abstraction and figuration, David’s development 
is filled with surprises, rather than just more of the same.AS

Cycle Revolution 
<https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/future-exhibitions/cycle-revolution>

As the two-wheeled revolution continues apace, cyclists take over the Design 
Museum this autumn, with a show that takes an in-depth look at bicycle culture 
through the lens of four “tribes” – from the Lycra-clad High Performers in 
pursuit of Olympic speeds, to the mountain-biking Thrill Seekers, to the 
fixie-bestraddling Urban Riders, to the Cargo Bikers earning a living on two 
wheels. The show will include a bike-making workshop, demonstrating how bespoke 
frames are made, as well as a section looking at the future of cycling and how 
it is affecting the infrastructure of the city.OW
