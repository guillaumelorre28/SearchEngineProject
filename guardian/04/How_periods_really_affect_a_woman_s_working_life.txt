Many women won’t be surprised by the results of a BBC survey in which more 
than half of female workers said they’d experienced period pain that affected 
their ability to do their job.

But while some might report feeling drained of energy and motivation when 
their period is due, others find they actually perform better at mental and 
physical tasks at that time of the month.

This is because of variations in the way different women react to hormonal 
changes in their monthly cycle. While intellectual tasks, such as completing a 
logic puzzle or doing an IQ test, rely on electrical circuits in the brain, how 
well the neurons perform is subtly affected by the ‘hormonal soup’ which 
surrounds them.

The female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone can alter the brain’s 
reward system, affecting motivation and how ‘sharp’ you feel, but when this 
takes place isn’t predictable - some women feel at their best a week after 
their period, while others do so just before.

Of course, severe pain can affect our mental agility too - another reason it 
might be a good idea for companies to introduce flexible ‘period leave’.
