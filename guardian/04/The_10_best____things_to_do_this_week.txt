Afropunk

Afropunk festival has been uniting African-American and punk culture in 
Brooklyn since 2005 and is now as much a show of immense street style as it is 
a celebration of music and art. This inauguralUK event, at Ally Pally today, 
was met with controversy over booking and then dropping MIA from its bill. But 
she’s been replaced with hula-hooper extraordinaire – and the original Afropunk 
– Grace Jones. There’s a strong British supporting lineup, too, from the likes 
of Laura Mvula, Young Fathers, Kwabs, Loyle Carner, Don Letts and Lady Leshurr.

Afropunk takes place on Saturday at Alexandra Palace, London

 My Dad Wrote A Porno Photograph: PR company handout 
When your dad pens a novel detailing the deeply unerotic, unintentionally 
hilarious sexploits of a saleswoman at a pots and pans company, the only thing 
to do is to share it with the world. This podcast from Jamie Morton, Alice 
Levine and James Cooper has proved so much of a hit that it’s now branching out 
into live shows (the next is in London on Oct 25 
<https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/my-dad-wrote-a-porno-live-tickets-27819084631>).

In the car park underneath The Store, a brutalist building in London’s Strand, 
lies this pop-up, showcasing 10 ambitious works from the likes of Martin Creed, 
Rachel Rose and Jeremy Deller. The loose theme that connects the films is 
“contemporary sound and vision”, which manages to cover everything from Jesse 
Owens to Kendrick Lamar, retro bubble-bath light shows to beguiling 3D.

The Store, W1, London until 4 December

Little Men review – five-star foray into money worries

From marriage-equality drama Love Is Strange to Keep The Lights On’s painful 
tale of addiction, director Ira Sachs has made a career out of telling tiny 
stories whose subject matter is anything but. His latest film concerns the 
effect of gentrification, as the friendship of two young children is put under 
threat when one’s father (Greg Kinnear) raises the rent on the other’s mother’s 
(Paulína Garcia) clothing store.

XKCD

Described as a “webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math and language”, this popular 
daily comic from former Nasa physicist Randall Munroe might look stylistically 
simple – a series of stick figures annotated with wobbly handwriting – but it’s 
also deeply clever, in its witty, accessible explanations of everything from 
binary fractions to pop culture. XKCD recently went viral with a cartoon chart 
of climate change since the Earth’s creation, a strip which managed to both to 
be funny and utterly terrifying. You can catch Munroe speaking about science, 
maths and more atNew Scientist Live this Saturday 
<https://live.newscientist.com/randall-munroe/>.
