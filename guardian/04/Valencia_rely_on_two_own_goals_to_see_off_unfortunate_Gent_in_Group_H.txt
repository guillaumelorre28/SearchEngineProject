Valencia made it two wins out of three in Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> Group H when own goals 
from the luckless Lasse Nielsen and Stefan Mitrovic gifted the La Liga side a 
2-1 victory over Belgian champions Gent on Tuesday.

After losing 3-2 at home to Zenit St Petersburg in their opening game

, Valencia revived their bid for a place in the round of 16 when a Sofiane 
Feghouli effort secured a1-0 success in Lyon

 last month.

The Algeria international was again decisive at a rainy Mestalla, vying with 
Nielsen to be first to a João Cancelo centre and forcing the Dane Nielsen to 
put the ball into his own net in the 15th minute.

Valencia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> almost doubled their 
lead 10 minutes later but Santi Mina and Dani Parejo were denied by a superb 
double save from goalkeeper Matz Sels.

The visitors levelled five minutes before the break when Thomas Foket chested 
the ball down in the penalty area and smashed a superb angled shot high past 
Jaume Doménech in the home goal.

Valencia struggled to exert control in the second half, with the fans at the 
Mestalla becoming increasingly frustrated until a José Gayà cross-shot 
ricocheted into the net off the unfortunate Mitrovic 18 minutes from time.

It was hardly a vintage performance from Valencia, back in the Champions 
League after a two-year absence, but tightened their grip on second place in 
Group H with six points.

Zenit lead on a maximum nine points after they won 3-1 at home to Lyon, with 
Gent and Lyon each on one point.
