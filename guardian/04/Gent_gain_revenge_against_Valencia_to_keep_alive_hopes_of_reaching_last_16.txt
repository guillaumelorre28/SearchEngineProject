, Gent, who entered the Champions League for the first time this season, are 
now in third with four points. Valencia are second with six points.

Itching to forget their outing in Valencia

own goals, the Belgian champions put pressure on the visitors from the start, 
with Laurent Depoitre having a first effort on goal in only the second minute.

Gent, the Belgian league leaders, created many chances by thundering past 
Valencia’s flanks but it was a performance that was not reflected on the 
scoreboard after 45 minutes. The much-deserved goal came in the 49th minute 
when Sven Kums converted a penalty awarded after Antonio Barragán handled.

Valencia, seventh in La Liga, were uninspiring, with Daniel Parejo’s free-kick 
in the 56th minute a rare attempt on goal.

While Gent’s performance appeared slightly more nervous at the end of the 
second half, the hosts maintained their lead until the final whistle. They 
would still finish behind the Spanish side on head-to-head records were the 
teams to finish level with no others.
