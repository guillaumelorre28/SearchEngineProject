Australia will be dirty they lost that game, what with all the possession and 
field position they enjoyed. Did they go wide before they earned the right?

Speaking of dirty, was Hooper just testing the wind here, or was he targeting 
Haskell? I suspect we’ll hear more of this.

England are now the No.2 ranked rugby team in the world. Informed of that fact 
Dylan Hartley gives a sweet little smile. He says “Australia are a proud, proud 
team and we will expect a tough game next week.”

But he allows England will enjoy the win. “The key message from last week was 
defence. Four tries last week hurt our pride and we put bodies on the line 
tonight and put some shots in.”

A clean sweep? “Why not?”

Tom Callaghan writes in to ponder what he sees as the continung deterioration 
of Australian sport. “I am an English/British sporting enthusiast,” he says, 
“and as an amateur I cannot pretend to have your expertise but it seems to me 
that results since 2000 in athletics, cycling, football, Rugby Union, boxing, 
triathlon -the list goes on - suggests that the Old Dart has an overwhelming 
sporting superiority over Australia.This seems to be borne out by medal tallies 
at last two Olympic Games. What do you think?”

Without consulting the record books I’d say you’re right. I wonder if it comes 
down to funding. Australia has always thrown a lot of money at sport which has 
seen them “punch above their weight”, as the saying goes. I think the lead up 
to London 2012 changed the mindset in the UK and results have followed. As I 
say, that’s a quick off-hand assessment, with a brain frazzled by an MBM.

Incredible performance by England who had just 30 per cent of possession and 
made something like 230 tackles to 90. Eleven times Australia put on seven 
phases or more but England —camped in their own 22 for the majority of that 
second half— would not bend. Australia did ‘win’ something, however. Handling 
errors, 15-2.

78 min The commentators can’t stress enough how England have played “less 
rugby” than Australia. It doesn’t sound like a compliment. England won’t care. 
Actually, to be fair, there is plenty of praise too for England’s heart and 
defensive steel.

And now a penalty to England so Farrell can apply icing to a towering cake.

Try! (Farrell 75) Australia 7-18 England

And that surely is the match-winning try! After a lovely break by Lawes, Jamie 
George picks up the ball and, 22m out, grubbers cleverly through the line. 
No-one is at home for Australia! Farrell steams through, toes the ball ahead 
and into the in-goal, and falls on it to score beside the posts!

73 min Itoje charges down a Foley clearing kick and for half a second you 
think it’ll sit up in the Aussie in-goal and give Itoje a chance at a 
five-pointer. But it bounces dead.

72 min Ford chips one ahead for Nowell knowing that even if Nowell doesn’t get 
there it’ll find touch. It finds touch, 22m out.

England make three changes, relieving exhausted troops: Haskell off for 
Clifford, Hartley off for George, Robshaw off for Launchbury.

70 min Lealiifano drops another one, on the half. That’s 13 handling errors to 
two (penalties 8-8).

Time is running out fast for the Wallabies, but not fast enough for England. 
England scrum right on the halfway line.

Phipps off, Frisby on.

67 min On the right, Kuridrani fends off Watson with a classic “don’t argue”, 
leaving the winger on the seat of his pants. The next moment the Wallabies 
follow up with another knock-on. They are not doing themselves any favours. 
England, meantime, are sucking in seagulls, their lungs straining due to keep 
up.

63 min Oh dear! Another wasted opportunity, Australia knock on! But almost 
immediately Australia steal it back and again set sail over the England 22m. 
Can England continue to hold back the gold tide?

Sort of. Penalty, Australia, right in front — Itoje leaving his feet. Joubert 
and Hartley have a heart to heart.

But Australia decline the penalty attempt and find touch. All hands on deck!

61 min Australia win their own lineout and Foley is soon zipping in and out of 
traffic. A vital Itoje tackle stops a gold shirt but the Wallabies recycle and 
Fardy is then try-bound before Cole, I think, stops him in his tracks. Within 
inches of a try.

But Australia have a scrum 5m out.

Oh, Kerevi off, Lealiifano on.

60 min More possession for the Wallabies who are always looking to stretch 
England. But I wonder if they are doing so without having first drawn England 
in from the edges. Going off too early, as it were.

57 min The Wallabies are lined up so deep on the left I’m worried they’ll get 
the bends on resurfacing. A few passes out Folau almost busts the line, but he 
gets his hands free and a pass away. He should be getting his hands on the ball 
much more often. He looks so dangerous.

Anyway, Howlett-Petty is, moments later, pulled down a metre or so short. But 
after clearing the ruck the Wallabies knock on! They just can’t make their 
pressure count.

55 min The Wallabies peel off the back of a lineout and sweep downfield but 
play is called back for an Australian knock-forward. Can’t say I saw it.

But what’s this? Australia win a scrum penalty! Will wonders never cease? It 
amounts to a lineout on the England 22m.

53 min Can England hold on as Australia push deep into their 22m? Again the 
Wallabies swing from one edge to the other and just as Folau —who started the 
movement with a lovely bootlaces pickup— looked like he might bust through a 
gap Hooper impedes him! Lucky not to be penalised there for obstruction.

But here’s a penalty. To England. On their own line! Another 10 phases 
repelled. England want that Cook Cup!

49 min After not making any headway following a scrum win Ford puts up a 
midfield bomb which Haylett-Petty fields safely. When England get the ball back 
they kick again. As Farrell runs through he takes out Foley who looked to be 
shielding the ball.

Moments later the touchie has a word to the ref and Foley is pinged for 
changing his line. Really, that all looked fairly innocuous but now Farrell has 
a kick attempt from 30m out as Cheika shakes his head in disbelief.

Half-time: Australia 7-10 England

That was quite an end to the half and it could have a huge bearing on the 
game. As it is, England edge Australia after a dominant first 30 minutes, but 
Australia seem to have shaken off a dose of ennui to put themselves right back 
in it.

Michael Keane is back with thanks and a “cheeky plug”: I’m grateful to the 
masked poet but unfortunately I have to be on stage this evening (Cheeky plug; 
The Government Inspector at The Crucible, The Guardian gave it 4 stars) so the 
quality of beer is immaterial. I don’t think people appreciate how difficult it 
is to be an Irish sports fan. Updates on the ODI v Sri Lanka are proving 
elusive for instance.

40 + 4 min Heroic defence by England to hold out 21 —count em, 21— phases all 
within their 10m. Australia got close a number of times but there was always a 
white shirt to make the critical tackle. The Wallabies knock on finally and 
England look rightly delighted. No-one more so than Vunipola.

40 min England win a scrum but Billy Vunipola dinks the ball into touch BEFORE 
the siren sounds! Australia’s lineout on the 22m. They win it, and plow up the 
middle.

Beautiful hands finds Kuidrani who is pulled down just 5m out. But Australia 
maintain possession... 15 phases now...

39 min Australia regain the ball and put a move on. On the left Folau finds a 
sliver of space inside Nowell and slips the ball to Kerevi. He passes it back 
out wide and here’s Fardy charging over the 22m looking for support! But he’s 
dragged to ground and a knock-on follows his attempt at an offload. England 
survive a real scare.

38 min Sloppy stuff by the Wallabies, the forwards putting on airs and graces

Moore scores, emerging from the pile of bodies to throw the ball in the air in 
delight! Great work by the Wallabies to keep their shape and stay away from the 
touchline.

33 min Heads down, yes, but bums up! Regaining possession from the kickoff the 
Wallabies charge forward, swinging it left to right looking for a chink in 
England’s armour. They camp inside the England 22, Foley making a number of 
dummy runs in what amounts to 16 phases. This is better from Australia!

And now they are awarded a penalty for England not rolling away.

29 min England’s forwards are repelled within the Aussie 22 but after four 
phases Joubert blows his whistle: McMahon, who got his hands on the ball, 
toppled over, thus leaving his feet. Itoje may have helped. Very kickable 
penalty attempt for Farrell.

27 min Wallabies knock on in midfield and another bout of push and shove 
starts off ahead of the scrum. Many England players are smeared in red which is 
clearly the smudge of on-field advertising but it doesn’t half look like blood.

And England shunt the Wallabies off the mark and the Wallabies are penalised 
for wheeling the scrum.

25 min Australia can’t get out of their own half at the moment but this will 
help: a penalty for not releasing the ball. Hooper did well there to lock it in 
the ruck. The Wallabies need to steady as Joubert asks someone to stop yelling 
at him.

22 min Now McMahon fails to roll away from a tackle, this one on the halfway 
line. England win their own lineout and four phases in Ford catches the 
Wallabies off guard by chipping over the top. The Wallabies get possession but 
England barrel the ball-holder over the touchline.

Australia will be dirty they lost that game, what with all the possession and 
field position they enjoyed. Did they go wide before they earned the right?

Speaking of dirty, was Hooper just testing the wind here, or was he targeting 
Haskell? I suspect we’ll hear more of this.

England are now the No.2 ranked rugby team in the world. Informed of that fact 
Dylan Hartley gives a sweet little smile. He says “Australia are a proud, proud 
team and we will expect a tough game next week.”

But he allows England will enjoy the win. “The key message from last week was 
defence. Four tries last week hurt our pride and we put bodies on the line 
tonight and put some shots in.”

A clean sweep? “Why not?”

Tom Callaghan writes in to ponder what he sees as the continung deterioration 
of Australian sport. “I am an English/British sporting enthusiast,” he says, 
“and as an amateur I cannot pretend to have your expertise but it seems to me 
that results since 2000 in athletics, cycling, football, Rugby Union, boxing, 
triathlon -the list goes on - suggests that the Old Dart has an overwhelming 
sporting superiority over Australia.This seems to be borne out by medal tallies 
at last two Olympic Games. What do you think?”

Without consulting the record books I’d say you’re right. I wonder if it comes 
down to funding. Australia has always thrown a lot of money at sport which has 
seen them “punch above their weight”, as the saying goes. I think the lead up 
to London 2012 changed the mindset in the UK and results have followed. As I 
say, that’s a quick off-hand assessment, with a brain frazzled by an MBM.
 
Incredible performance by England who had just 30 per cent of possession and 
made something like 230 tackles to 90. Eleven times Australia put on seven 
phases or more but England —camped in their own 22 for the majority of that 
second half— would not bend. Australia did ‘win’ something, however. Handling 
errors, 15-2.
 
England retain the Cook Cup and win a series on Australian soil! They look 
rightly delighted with their performance.

80 min Time enough for one more Aussie knock-on. And that’s the siren! England 
win!
 
Farrell makes no mistake and we just have time for the restart.
 
78 min The commentators can’t stress enough how England have played “less 
rugby” than Australia. It doesn’t sound like a compliment. England won’t care. 
Actually, to be fair, there is plenty of praise too for England’s heart and 
defensive steel.

And now a penalty to England so Farrell can apply icing to a towering cake.
 
That surely is that.

Barbour/Getty Images  
And that surely is the match-winning try! After a lovely break by Lawes, Jamie 
George picks up the ball and, 22m out, grubbers cleverly through the line. 
No-one is at home for Australia! Farrell steams through, toes the ball ahead 
and into the in-goal, and falls on it to score beside the posts!

74 min Foley hands off to Kuridrani in traffic on phase seven and Fardy, 
following up, knocks it on.
 
73 min Itoje charges down a Foley clearing kick and for half a second you 
think it’ll sit up in the Aussie in-goal and give Itoje a chance at a 
five-pointer. But it bounces dead.
 
72 min Ford chips one ahead for Nowell knowing that even if Nowell doesn’t get 
there it’ll find touch. It finds touch, 22m out.

England make three changes, relieving exhausted troops: Haskell off for 
Clifford, Hartley off for George, Robshaw off for Launchbury.
 
70 min Lealiifano drops another one, on the half. That’s 13 handling errors to 
two (penalties 8-8).

Time is running out fast for the Wallabies, but not fast enough for England. 
England scrum right on the halfway line.

Phipps off, Frisby on.
 
67 min On the right, Kuridrani fends off Watson with a classic “don’t argue”, 
leaving the winger on the seat of his pants. The next moment the Wallabies 
follow up with another knock-on. They are not doing themselves any favours. 
England, meantime, are sucking in seagulls, their lungs straining due to keep 
up.
 
66 min Foley finds Folau with a short ball but the defence is on him before he 
can catch it cleanly. Haskell, it is, in his face like your mum’s hot flannel! 
England find touch on the half. What more can we say about this defence?
 
63 min Oh dear! Another wasted opportunity, Australia knock on! But almost 
immediately Australia steal it back and again set sail over the England 22m. 
Can England continue to hold back the gold tide?

Sort of. Penalty, Australia, right in front — Itoje leaving his feet. Joubert 
and Hartley have a heart to heart.

But Australia decline the penalty attempt and find touch. All hands on deck!
 
61 min Australia win their own lineout and Foley is soon zipping in and out of 
traffic. A vital Itoje tackle stops a gold shirt but the Wallabies recycle and 
Fardy is then try-bound before Cole, I think, stops him in his tracks. Within 
inches of a try.

But Australia have a scrum 5m out.

Oh, Kerevi off, Lealiifano on.
 
60 min More possession for the Wallabies who are always looking to stretch 
England. But I wonder if they are doing so without having first drawn England 
in from the edges. Going off too early, as it were.
 
57 min The Wallabies are lined up so deep on the left I’m worried they’ll get 
the bends on resurfacing. A few passes out Folau almost busts the line, but he 
gets his hands free and a pass away. He should be getting his hands on the ball 
much more often. He looks so dangerous.

Anyway, Howlett-Petty is, moments later, pulled down a metre or so short. But 
after clearing the ruck the Wallabies knock on! They just can’t make their 
pressure count.
 Dane Haylett-Petty is taken down by Jack Nowell. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP 
55 min The Wallabies peel off the back of a lineout and sweep downfield but 
play is called back for an Australian knock-forward. Can’t say I saw it.

But what’s this? Australia win a scrum penalty! Will wonders never cease? It 
amounts to a lineout on the England 22m.
 
53 min Can England hold on as Australia push deep into their 22m? Again the 
Wallabies swing from one edge to the other and just as Folau —who started the 
movement with a lovely bootlaces pickup— looked like he might bust through a 
gap Hooper impedes him! Lucky not to be penalised there for obstruction.

But here’s a penalty. To England. On their own line! Another 10 phases 
repelled. England want that Cook Cup!
 
Give Farrell an inch and he’ll take three points. 
 Another three for Owen Farrell. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP  
49 min After not making any headway following a scrum win Ford puts up a 
midfield bomb which Haylett-Petty fields safely. When England get the ball back 
they kick again. As Farrell runs through he takes out Foley who looked to be 
shielding the ball.

Moments later the touchie has a word to the ref and Foley is pinged for 
changing his line. Really, that all looked fairly innocuous but now Farrell has 
a kick attempt from 30m out as Cheika shakes his head in disbelief.
 
47 min Howlett-Petty puts his laces through one and Billy Vunipola does very 
well to keep it from finding touch in England territory, tip-toeing along the 
sideline and batting the ball back infield just as it looked to bounce out. He 
was like a well-fed possum on a power line.
 
46 min Now Youngs finds touch, this time just 10m out from the Wallabies line.

Double change by Australia: Kepu off, Greg Holmes on. Slipper off, Toby Smith 
on.
 
44 min A Phipps box kick, from just inside his 22m, finds touch on the half. 
Preceding the kick Australia had stymied seven attacking phases by England who, 
in the end, said stuff this for a joke and kicked.
 
42 min McMahon pounces on a loose ball and toes it downfield but in the act of 
clutching it in his arms it wriggles out like a greased piglet. Knock-on. 
Unlucky there.
 
41 min Howlett-Petty roosts a high ball to Ford who catches it on the half and 
then, cool as you like, drills a low grubber kick over the touchline 22m out.
 
Neil Mackenzie asks if there’s ever been a more biased commentary team than 
the one on Fox Sports Australia right now. Ponder that one because England are 
just about to kick off ...

Meanwhile, somewhere else, Scotland are leading Japan 16-10 just short of 
halftime (after trailing 10-9).
 
Australia are lucky to be just seven points short at this stage considering 
their lack of polish. To be a fly in the dressing room...

That was quite an end to the half and it could have a huge bearing on the 
game. As it is, England edge Australia after a dominant first 30 minutes, but 
Australia seem to have shaken off a dose of ennui to put themselves right back 
in it.

Michael Keane is back with thanks and a “cheeky plug”: I’m grateful to the 
masked poet but unfortunately I have to be on stage this evening (Cheeky plug; 
The Government Inspector at The Crucible, The Guardian gave it 4 stars) so the 
quality of beer is immaterial. I don’t think people appreciate how difficult it 
is to be an Irish sports fan. Updates on the ODI v Sri Lanka are proving 
elusive for instance.
 
40 + 4 min Heroic defence by England to hold out 21 —count em, 21— phases all 
within their 10m. Australia got close a number of times but there was always a 
white shirt to make the critical tackle. The Wallabies knock on finally and 
England look rightly delighted. No-one more so than Vunipola.
 
40 min England win a scrum but Billy Vunipola dinks the ball into touch BEFORE 
the siren sounds! Australia’s lineout on the 22m. They win it, and plow up the 
middle.

Beautiful hands finds Kuidrani who is pulled down just 5m out. But Australia 
maintain possession... 15 phases now...
 
39 min Australia regain the ball and put a move on. On the left Folau finds a 
sliver of space inside Nowell and slips the ball to Kerevi. He passes it back 
out wide and here’s Fardy charging over the 22m looking for support! But he’s 
dragged to ground and a knock-on follows his attempt at an offload. England 
survive a real scare.

38 min Sloppy stuff by the Wallabies, the forwards putting on airs and graces 
by throwing the ball about in traffic close to the touchline. Kepu, I think it 
was, then just tosses it over the sideline.
 
From wide on the left Foley flirts with the left upright but he sneaks it in. 
Australia steady!
 
Moore scores, emerging from the pile of bodies to throw the ball in the air in 
delight! Great work by the Wallabies to keep their shape and stay away from the 
touchline.

34 min: McMahon it was who instigated that Aussie charge, busting through a 
number of tackles. Anyway, from the lineout, the Wallabies fall into a rolling 
maul and from five metres out, and ten in from touch ...
 
33 min Heads down, yes, but bums up! Regaining possession from the kickoff the 
Wallabies charge forward, swinging it left to right looking for a chink in 
England’s armour. They camp inside the England 22, Foley making a number of 
dummy runs in what amounts to 16 phases. This is better from Australia!

And now they are awarded a penalty for England not rolling away. 
 
And so it proves. Australia have their heads down, I feel.
 
29 min England’s forwards are repelled within the Aussie 22 but after four 
phases Joubert blows his whistle: McMahon, who got his hands on the ball, 
toppled over, thus leaving his feet. Itoje may have helped. Very kickable 
penalty attempt for Farrell.

27 min Wallabies knock on in midfield and another bout of push and shove 
starts off ahead of the scrum. Many England players are smeared in red which is 
clearly the smudge of on-field advertising but it doesn’t half look like blood.

And England shunt the Wallabies off the mark and the Wallabies are penalised 
for wheeling the scrum.
 
25 min Australia can’t get out of their own half at the moment but this will 
help: a penalty for not releasing the ball. Hooper did well there to lock it in 
the ruck. The Wallabies need to steady as Joubert asks someone to stop yelling 
at him.
 
22 min Now McMahon fails to roll away from a tackle, this one on the halfway 
line. England win their own lineout and four phases in Ford catches the 
Wallabies off guard by chipping over the top. The Wallabies get possession but 
England barrel the ball-holder over the touchline.
