Spending your Christmas surrounded by snow, reindeer and huskies may seem like 
an unfulfillable festive fantasy for most of us, but with volunteer 
opportunities available on farms across the higher latitudes of the northern 
hemisphere, it could be possible to live out this winter dream for free. 
Organisations such as Workaway <http://www.workaway.info/>, Helpx 
<http://www.helpx.net/> and Wwoof <http://www.wwoof.net/> list thousands of 
farms and projects around the worldwhere volunteers can put in a few hours' 
hard graft each day in exchange for free food and accommodation.

 Since it's the season when we go mushy inside for all things festive, we've 
rounded up some real-life, pretty-as-a-Christmas-card opportunities to live for 
free in your very own winter wonderland.

Volunteer with a husky tour in Norway

You'll be in good hands helping out at Engholm Husky in northern Norway. Run 
by Sven Engholm, 11-time winner of Europe's longest sled dog race, the
Finnmarksløpet <http://www.finnmarkslopet.no/front.jsp?lang=en>, this husky 
tour company is always looking for people to help out. In the winter, this 
means preparing for sled tours, repairing equipment and working in the dog 
yard. Volunteers get free food and stay toasty at night in the comfort of a 
cosy log house.

Help with reindeers in Finland

Wintertime means reindeer time at this small farm in Kaamasmukka, northern 
Lapland. The husband-and-wife hosts are looking for help with their animals, 
which also include horses, so there'll be the chance to go on rides across the 
snowy landscape (when you're not mucking out the stables).

Make maple syrup in Canada

Fancy guzzling maple syrup in the company of reindeer? This farm about two 
hours from Toronto is looking for Wwoofers to help out with production. As well 
as making the sticky stuff, the farm cares for a wide range of animals, 
including Icelandic horses, reindeer and rare-breed chickens. In your time off 
you can ride the horses, ski, or simply sweat it out in a hot tub.

Help with huskies in Iceland

Located in the spectacular Icelandic countryside, these holiday apartments 
(walking distance from a fjord) need someone to help out from February. When 
you're not welcoming holiday guests and keeping things clean and tidy, you'll 
be caring for the huskies and watching the northern lights.

Work on a husky farm in Finland

This farm in Finland is part of Lapland's Centre for Arctic and Polar 
Exploration and has more than 100 huskies (and a second farm nearby has a 
further 100), so you will literally be overrun with the world's most lovable 
canine breed. Volunteers will be expected to work long, physically demanding 
days, but you should be inspired by the farm's owners: they are former 
professional explorers, including the first Finn to complete an unsupported 
expedition to the South Pole.

Grow organic Christmas trees in Denmark
 Syltemae 
Want a top quality tree this year? Go straight to the source. This farm on the 
Danish coast grows organic Christmas trees, as well as looking after goats, 
chickens and ducks. You won't be roasting any of the latter, however, as most 
of the cooking on the farm is vegetarian. And when you're not tending to the 
garden and campground you'll be able to enjoy yoga, swimming and kayaking.
