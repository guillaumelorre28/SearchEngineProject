And how’s it been? You mean you don’t know?

I had a pretty big 2014 and I’ve been detoxing in bed ever since. Were there 
awful disasters and atrocities?I’m afraid so. Especially an earthquake in Nepal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/may/12/nepal-earthquake-74-tremor-hits-near-mount-everest-live-updates>
 that everyone has forgotten about.

I’m sorry to hear that. But is humanity still surviving and mostly still nice? 
Yes.

I suppose that’s something. Who had a good year? Space nerds, on balance, 
because we took incredible pictures of Pluto, andfound liquid water on Mars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/28/nasa-scientists-find-evidence-flowing-water-mars>
.

Why only on balance? Terry Pratchett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett-author-of-the-discworld-series-dies-aged-66>
 andLeonard Nimoy died 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/27/leonard-nimoy-mr-spock-star-trek-dies-ages-83>
.

That’s sad. Who else had a good year? Tories.

Also sad. Did they somehow form another coalition? Nope. They won an outright 
majority then watched Labourelect Jeremy Corbyn as their new leader 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election>
.

Who? Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>. He’s 
a lefty from the 1980s.

Wait, but … I mean how did … No one really knows what happened, OK? Ed Miliband
just turned up one day with a giant gravestone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/13/the-ed-stones-fate-resting-in-peace-in-a-south-london-garage>
, then lost, then everything went crazy, and at the end Corbyn was doing prime 
minister’s questions.

Blimey. What else did I miss? Greece finally defaulted on its debt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras>
.

So are they out of the euro now? Or were they let off? Neither. They just got 
another bailout and some new deadlines.

Bor-ing. Who had a bad year? Sepp Blatter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/02/sepp-blatter-fifa-resignation-statement-full-text>
 andJeremy Clarkson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/25/jeremy-clarkson-top-gear-contract-bbc>
. They both lost their jobs.

Get in! Why? Suspended for corruption and punching someone for steak, 
respectively.

I wish it had been the other way around. Tough.

How does punching someone get you a steak? That was never really made clear. I 
think if you just punch everyone who doesn’t bring you a steak, eventually you 
get a steak. Oh, andIreland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/23/gay-marriage-ireland-yes-vote> 
and theUS legalised gay marriage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court>
.

Great! And Harper Lee <https://www.theguardian.com/books/harper-lee> published 
another novel.

Two Kill a Mockingbird? No. It’s an ancient first draft called Go Set a 
Watchman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-read-the-first-chapter>
.

Any good? Not really. It’s a bit depressing, actually.

How come? Never mind. On the plus side, both Wayne Rooney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2015/sep/05/wayne-rooney-england-equals-record-goalscoring-charlton>
 andthe Queen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/09/business-as-usual-as-queen-becomes-longest-reigning-british-monarch>
 finally broke the big records.

Which records? Goals scored and years reigned for England, respectively.

Again, I kind of wish that …Tough.

Do say: How did the Ashes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/08/england-win-ashes-beat-australia-fourth-test>
 go?

Don’t say: Excellent. How about the Rugby World Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/04/england-rugby-world-cup-stuart-lancaster-10-reasons>
?
