Ally McCoist <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ally-mccoist> is preparing 
for Rangers’ match against Livingston on Saturday after a meeting between the 
52-year-old and the Ibrox club’s board failed to resolve a stand-off over his 
future.

McCoist has served a letter of resignation to Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/12/ally-mccoist-tenders-resignation-rangers-manager>
, a move that triggered a 12-month notice period on a contract worth £750,000 
per year. It is widely recognised that the club cannot afford to pay McCoist a 
lump sum to leave now and with the manager not wanting to make matters easy for 
a board in which he has completely lost faith, this will not be a simple issue 
to conclude.

McCoist met Rangers’ directors, including the former Newcastle United chief 
executive Derek Llambias, at Ibrox on Wednesday afternoon. After little over an 
hour of talks, it was confirmed that McCoist remains in office, for the time 
being at least.Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> will 
begin the weekend nine points adrift of Hearts in Scotland’s second tier, with 
McCoist’s team having played one game more.

Billy Davies is the clear favourite to succeed McCoist, most likely until the 
end of this season initially, if the latter’s departure can be negotiated in 
the near future.

Rangers’ annual general meeting, during which irate minority shareholders are 
certain to round on the club’s directors, is scheduled for Monday. The club 
have admitted they need in the region of £8m to continue trading throughout 
2015.
