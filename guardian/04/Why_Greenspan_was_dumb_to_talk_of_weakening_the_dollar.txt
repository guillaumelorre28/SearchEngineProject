The Chinese delegation at the G20 will love that: Alan Greenspan, former 
chairman of the Federal Reserve, says the US is pursuing a policy of weakening 
its currency.The chance of substantive agreement in Seoul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/11/g20-trade-deal-doubtful> on the 
rebalancing of global trade just fell further.

Tim Geithner, US treasury secretary, was peeved. "We will never seek to weaken 
our currency as a tool to gain competitive advantage or to grow the economy," 
he said.

Geithner is right to be angry. Many think the Fed's policy of quantitative 
easing, which received a $600bn (Â£372bn) top-up last week, will have the effect 
of weakening the dollar. But that is not an aim. The aim is to stimulate 
demand, lower the cost of borrowing and create jobs.

Those investors who feel the Fed is doomed to fail in its mission may wish to 
sell dollars. Supporters of QE may think there will be long-term benefits to the
US economy <https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy> that will 
strengthen the dollar eventually. Either way, the value of the dollar is set by 
the market in round-the-clock trading.

The same is not true of the Chinese yuan, which is pegged within a tight range 
against the dollar. Greenspan ought to have made that distinction clearer in 
his article in the Financial Times. His failure to do so muddies the waters at 
theG20 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20>, where the struggle to produce a 
formula for rebalancing global trade already seems doomed to fail.

Greenspan's contentious remark was a tiny part of his article. A greater part 
was devoted to China's suppression of its currency and its failure to accept 
global obligations. But the line about the US is the one that will reverberate. 
It was a dumb thing to say.
