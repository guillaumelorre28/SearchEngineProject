Two Guardian journalists, Jonathan Freedland and Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, have won 
the Orwell prize for their political journalism.

The Guardian's Executive Editor, Opinion, Jonathan Freedland was awarded the 
special prize for journalism for his writing, including articles on Margaret 
Thatcher and Pope Francis. Robin Lustig, a judge for the journalism prize, said 
of Freedland: "He has been on the shortlist of the Orwell prize seven times 
now. His writing has a lucidity and elegance of style that deserves reward."

Guardian Foreign correspondent Ghaith Abdul-Ahad won the Orwell prize for 
journalism for his work on the Syrian conflict, including a special report on a 
jihadist group effort to take control in the country. Lustig said: "He has 
shown great personal courage and a rare depth of understanding. He writes with 
deep compassion for those whose lives have been shattered by the conflict."

The winners were chosen from 235 entries to the book prize and 167 entries to 
the journalism prize.
