Alex McLeish <https://www.theguardian.com/football/alex-mcleish> has played 
down speculation linking him with a return to the Scotland manager's role and 
tipped Gordon Strachan for the vacant post.

Strachan is the clear favourite to succeed Craig Levein, who was relieved of 
his duties by the Scottish Football Association on Monday evening 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/05/craig-levein-scotland-manager-departed>
. The early indications are that the former Coventry City, Celtic and 
Southampton manager would accept the job on the right terms.

McLeish, a former team-mate of Strachan at Aberdeen, was also seen as a 
candidate to be on the SFA's shortlist. Yet in an interview with TalkSport, the 
53-year-old said: "Gordon looks a pretty good choice.

"I don't want to say I don't want the Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scotland> job but I feel I've still got 
some time left in club football."

McLeish, who has been out of work since leaving Aston Villa, departed the 
Scotland job in 2007 to take charge of Birmingham City. He added: "I left the 
national team to take up club football. I felt I was missing the day-to-day 
stuff. I wouldn't like to be unfair to Scotland fans in terms of coming back to 
the job and being a hypocrite.

"There's nothing really pending, I had to have a break after Aston Villa and 
now I've got itchy feet again."

Joe Jordan, who is likely to enter the SFA thoughts, was more positive on the 
national job. "I am Scottish, I'm a proud Scotsman and a person that wants to 
work," he told the BBC. "And, for my name to be mentioned, yes, it's nice to be 
linked with the national job."

Jordan served as the first-team coach at Tottenham Hotspur under Harry 
Redknapp and has also managed Hearts, Stoke City and Bristol City.
