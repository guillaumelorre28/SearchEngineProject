Has the status of the EHIC, the European health insurance card, been raised in 
the EU referendum debate? What will be the consequences for this if the vote is 
for Brexit – and how will it affect travellers and expats living in the EU?

• The extension to Tate Modern is another example of the trend to build 
atriums to nowhere (First look: inside the Switch House 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/23/first-look-inside-tate-moderns-power-pyramid>
, 23 May). Such buildings welcome you into large airy spaces, usually with 
grand staircases and often with coffee bars and places to sit. But the bigger, 
significant spaces that you would expect these foyers to lead on to are not 
there. They are an end in themselves, and they are for people to wander up and 
down as on a boulevard. The Tate has clearly accepted what art galleries are 
really all about.

• As author of the Ladybird book How it Works: Shopping on the Internet, can I 
say that it was not a parody as suggested by Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris (

• Sorry to be a spoilsport (Letters

• Keen readers of the Arthur Ransome’s works will be wondering what will, in 
subsequent films, happen to Dorothea’s brother (Titty’s family furious over 
Tatty treatment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/24/swallows-and-amazons-titty-renamed-tatty-in-bbc-film>
, 25 May). Will he be rather formally referred to as “Richard” throughout or 
renamed “Dack”?

• Strange that the film-makers object to Titty, but not to Roger.
