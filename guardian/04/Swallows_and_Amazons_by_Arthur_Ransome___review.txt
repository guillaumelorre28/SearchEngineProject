When John, Susan, Titty and Roger go for a sailing holiday on the island in 
the lake, they soon encounter pirate attacks, treasure hunting, Amazon pirates 
and a strange captain Flint and it becomes the best holiday ever!

My favourite character is Nancy Blackett, Captain of the Amazon, because she 
is the most adventurous.

This is a great book and very exciting, but it is a bit hard to understand, as 
lots of sailing terms are used, so you'd better have a dictionary near. I would 
recommend this to anyone who is interested in sailing aged between 7 and 13.

This is the first book in a series of twelve. Note, not all the books have the 
same characters.
