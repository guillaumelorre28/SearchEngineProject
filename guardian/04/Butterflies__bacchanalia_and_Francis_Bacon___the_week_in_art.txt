 Bacchanalian Revel Before a Term, circa 1630, by Nicolas Poussin. Photograph:

Nicolas Poussin
Ecstasy and sin have rarely been as controlled as they are in this painting. 
Poussin portrays excess and intoxication with a firm hand, but every precise 
stroke of his measured composition makes you aware of his moral disdain. It is 
clearly not how this French artist who worked amid the classical ruins of Rome 
spent his own time.
