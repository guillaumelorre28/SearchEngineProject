Everyone agrees that cuts will be needed, but the question is where? There is 
a great danger that the pressure on budgets will lead to short-term 
decision-making where the usual suspects – such as mental health services – get 
cut, instead of the focus being put on driving efficiencies in the acute and 
mainstream primary care sector or on reducing social care service bureaucracy.

People may keep their heads in the sand, recommissioning existing inefficient 
services rather than looking to new providers to do things differently. 
Commissioners should be making radical decisions, involving local people in 
designing and delivering the services they use.

Budget cuts shouldn't end up punishing those people already badly hit by the 
recession. Investing in preventive interventions, such as those that tackle 
unemployment, substance misuse or mental health problems, would short-circuit 
the intergenerational cycle of deprivation. The New Economics Foundation 
estimates the net return on full investment in these areas would be £269bn over 
10 years.

Investing in personalised social care services for people with a learning 
disability, for example, cannot continue to be a "nice to have". I am hopeful 
that this time, at least, those who hold the purse strings will be able to make 
a real difference.
