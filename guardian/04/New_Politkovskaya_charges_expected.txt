Russian investigators have marked the fifth anniversary of Anna 
Politkovskaya's murder by announcing that they will file new charges against 
previously arrested suspects.

Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, a native of Chechnya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/chechnya>, is accused of organising the 
shooting of the investigative journalist who was critical of Vladimir Putin's 
administration.

New charges against the suspected hitman, Rustam Makhmudov, and several others 
are expected too.

Makhmudov's two brothers and former Moscow police officer Sergei 
Khadzhikurbanov stood trial on charges of helping to stage the killing, but a 
court found them not guilty in 2009.

The Russian supreme court overruled the acquittal and has sent the case back 
to prosecutors. Gaitukayev is an uncle of the Makhmudovs.

Politkovskaya was gunned down in the elevator of her Moscow apartment building 
on 7 October 2006.

Investigators also said that Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, who was a senior police 
officer at the time of the killing, helped to track Politkovskaya's movements 
before she was shot.

The news has been welcomed by Politkovskaya's newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, which 
is co-owned by Alexander Lebedev, owner of The Independent andLondon Evening 
Standard <https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-evening-standard> in Britain.

But the paper also lamented the slow progress on finding the person who 
ordered the killing.

Politkovskaya was killed on Putin's birthday, fuelling speculation about the 
involvement of senior officials in the Kremlin being responsible.
