If you walked into a toilet cubicle and saw a bomb strapped to the back of the 
door, would you know if it were real? You’d just run. And you would be right 
to. It’s difficult to tell the difference unless you’ve had years of bomb 
disposal training. Sometimes not even the smartest computerised system can do 
it.

With practice, the brain can spot distinctions so subtle they’re impossible to 
describe. In an experiment, humans and computers were asked to spot rocks and 
mines using sonar detection systems in a submarine. In time, sonar operators 
could tell if an object was a mine or a rock, but they couldn’t explain why. 
Yet the computers still struggled.

This form of brain training can also be seen in – don’t laugh – professional 
chicken sexers. To the untrained eye, male and female chickens’ genitals look 
the same. Experts learn to tell the gender of a chicken quickly and accurately 
– but they can’t describe the exact differences.

Sometimes, despite all the brain’s potential to spot detailed discrepancies, 
the safest thing to do with adummy bomb left behind at a football stadium

 is to leg it and let the professionals conduct a controlled explosion.
