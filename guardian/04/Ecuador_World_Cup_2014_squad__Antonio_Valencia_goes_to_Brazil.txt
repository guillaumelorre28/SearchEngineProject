The Manchester United's midfielder Antonio Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/antonio-valencia> has been named in 
Ecuador's 24-man World Cup squad.

Valencia, who is expected to be Ecuador's key player at the World Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football>, is likely to be 
joined in the final squad by the 19-year-old Stuttgart midfielder Carlos 
Gruezo, who is uncapped but has been named among the provisional 24.

Ecuador <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador>, who are in Group E 
with Switzerland, France and Honduras, have one big hole in their squad, left 
by the former Birmingham City striker Christian Benitez, who died of a heart 
attack last year aged 27 and would almost certainly have been picked to travel 
to Brazil.
