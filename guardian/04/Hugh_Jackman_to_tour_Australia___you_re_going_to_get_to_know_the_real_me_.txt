An all-singing, all-dancing Hugh Jackman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/hugh-jackman> is set to tour Australia in a 
new arena spectacular called Broadway to Oz.

The Australian actor and singer made the announcement in Sydney on Monday. 
Kicking off in Melbourne on 24 November, the tour will also visit Sydney, 
Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.

He described the announcement as a “true bucket list moment” and said the show 
had been in his “head and heart” for 10 years.

In it, he will reflect on life growing up in Australia and his subsequent 
Hollywood career, including a tribute to his role as Wolverine in the 
blockbuster X-Men film franchise. “It’s pretty much all about me, it’s 
everything I love,” he said. “You’re going to get to know the real me in that 
show.”

Jackman will be joined on stage by 150 musicians, including a 35-piece 
orchestra, guest singers, dancers and a choir, he said, adding that he will not 
simply be singing in the show. “I’ll be dancing – more than I ever have before.”

Broadway to Oz will be modelled on his 2011 Broadway hit, Hugh Jackman: Back 
on Broadway, in which he delved into his Australian identity. “Being Australian 
is a very important part of who I am and from the moment I was doing the show, 
whether it was on Broadway, the endgame was being here,” he said.

The tour will be his first time performing on an Australian stage in almost 10 
years.

Jackman said he never pays attention to reviews, with the exception of the 
“one review that really matters” – from his wife, actor Deborra-Lee Furness.

His original Broadway production was one of the few Furness didn’t fall asleep 
in, he said. “That might seem like a low bar, but for Deb that’s as high a bar 
as you can get because it’s only happened about twice in our 20 years of 
marriage.”

The Tony award-winner opened his press conference with a live rendition of one 
of his signature songs, I Still Call Australia Home, by singer-songwriter Peter 
Allen, whom he depicted in the stage musical The Boy from Oz.

Along with songs from The Boy from Oz, the show’s setlist will include numbers 
from the musical Les Misérables. Jackman’s star turn as protagonist Jean 
Valjean in the 2012 film version earned him his first Academy award nomination, 
which he described as a “real watershed moment” for his career.

Jackman kept the rest of the setlist tightly under wraps but said there will 
be songs from shows he hasn’t appeared in “but wanted to be, or maybe will be 
one day” and some choices that are “left of centre, but things that I love”.

He said the show will have an informal air, with plenty of audience 
interaction and told potential hecklers to “bring it on”.


Jackman thanked Furness and his two children, who were both present. “Some 
guys say to their wives: ‘I want to go golfing with my buddies’. I say to Deb 
‘can I go do my show, is that OK?’ Because I love it!”
