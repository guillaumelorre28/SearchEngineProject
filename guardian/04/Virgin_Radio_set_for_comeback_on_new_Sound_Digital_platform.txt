Virgin Radio is to return to the UK airwaves, along with three spin-off 
TalkSport <https://www.theguardian.com/media/talksport> stations and a host of 
new nationwide broadcasters as part of a new wave of digital radio stations.


The rock and pop music brand owned by Richard Branson is one of 14 stations 
that will launch on Sound Digital, the second national commercial digital 
platform licensed by media regulatorOfcom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom> on Friday.


Branson has long wished to relaunch Virgin Radio. Still broadcasting in a 
number of countries around the world, the Virgin brand disappeared in the UK in 
2008 when the station, once owned by Chris Evans, was rebranded Absolute Radio.


Sound Digital, owned by TalkSport parent UTV Media, Absolute Radio owner Bauer 
Media and transmission companyArqiva <https://www.theguardian.com/media/arqiva>
, beat a rival bid, Listen2Digital, which would have seen the return of a new 
sports station backed by former TalkSport owner, Kelvin MacKenzie.

The new stations are expected to launch in March next year and will see around 
a doubling of the national digital stations currently available on digital 
audio broadcasting radio.


The second wave of national commercial digital stations has been a long time 
coming. The second national digital licence was first awarded by Ofcom seven 
years ago, to a Channel 4-backed consortium,only for the broadcaster to pull 
the plug <https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/21/channel4-digital-radio>.


Digital radio <https://www.theguardian.com/media/digital-radio> has not 
matched the popularity of digital TV, which grew at such a rate that the 
analogue TV signal was switched off in 2012 after a remarkably smooth 
switchover scheme.

But all talk of radio switchover has been put on the backburner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/16/digital-radio-switchover-2020-ed-vaizey>
, with the majority of listening still to analogue services on FM or AM.

In-home digital listening overtook analogue for the first time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/05/digital-radio-overtakes-analogue-in-homes-for-first-time>
 at the end of last year, but overall - including cars - only 37.9% of all 
listening is on digital.

DAB radio remains by some distance the most popular digital platform but it 
remains to be seen how it will fare in the long term in an era when online 
streaming is commonplace.

The new line-up of national commercial stations includes three TalkSport 
spin-off station, TalkSport 2, Talk Radio and Talk Business, backed by 
Bloomberg.

Other stations will include several services already available either 
nationwide or in large parts of the country on various platforms including 
Bauer’s Absolute 80s and Planet Rock, and Jazz FM.
