Becket Rumsey, his brother Billy and a snail called Brian have some serious 
investigating to do! The mystery began when their father took them away in the 
middle of the night, without Pearl (best step-mum) knowing anything about it. 
Without any explanation from their father, Beckett and Billy (and Brian) are 
left in the dark so they create “SNOOP” – Secret Network of Observations, 
Operations and Probing. In a series of hilarious yet vital “missions”, SNOOP 
set about finding Pearl. There are some twists and turns that you don’t see 
coming and although the subject matter is bereavement this is not at all a 
depressing read and has some genuinely laugh out loud moments.

 In this story, it shows how hard it can be to say goodbye. While Becket 
struggles to find a way to say goodbye to his deceased mother, his classmates 
and friends learn morals from each other. The main characters of Becket and 
Billy are really believable in all of the typical boy characteristics that they 
display as 11 and 7 year olds. This is a humorous novel yet it tugs at the 
heartstrings and shows that goodbye doesn’t have to be a final farewell. You 
cannot say too much about the plot as this would spoil the story, but I will 
say this, I highly recommend that you read it.
