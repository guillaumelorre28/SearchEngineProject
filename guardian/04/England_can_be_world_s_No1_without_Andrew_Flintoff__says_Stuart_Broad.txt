Stuart Broad believes England will cope without the retiring Andrew Flintoff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/24/andrew-flintoff-england-return-surgery>
 – but praised the all-rounder for his impact on the English game. Broad has 
already been anointed by some as Flintoff's heir apparent, though the 
23-year-old, who finished as England's leading wicket-taker in the 2009 Ashes, 
played down such comparisons.

"We are not rabbits in the headlights without Fred," said Broad. "We have had 
to play at times without him before. But he has been a huge help to me, and I 
cannot thank him enough for what he has done for English cricket."

"We move on and focus on future challenges," he said. "Our ultimate aim is to 
become the No1 team in the world – but that does not happen overnight."

On the subject of his ability to emulate Flintoff – just as Flintoff before 
him was expected to live up to the legendary status of Ian Botham – Broad was 
understandably reserved, expressing only an initial wish to improve his batting.

"It's surreal being mentioned in the same sentence as those two," said Broad. 
"But I'm not under any extra pressure – I just try to improve my game as much 
as I can. I'm certainly not in the all-rounder class Ian Botham and Andrew 
Flintoff were – they could make big hundreds. But I would like to be in the 
future."
