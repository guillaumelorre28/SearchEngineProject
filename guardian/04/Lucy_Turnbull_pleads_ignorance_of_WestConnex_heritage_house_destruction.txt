Lucy Turnbull has said she is unaware of the destruction of heritage 
properties in the Sydney suburb of Haberfield in a radio interview defending 
the controversial WestConnex project inSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>.

The federal shadow infrastructure and cities minister, Anthony Albanese 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/anthony-albanese>, said the 
comments were “beyond belief” and questioned what Turnbull had been doing as 
Greater Sydney Commission chief commissioner.

On Tuesday Turnbull, a former Sydney lord mayor, was speaking on ABC radio’s 
702 with Wendy Harmer aboutthe relocation of Tropfest from Centennial Park to 
Parramatta Park

After praising the relocation of Tropfest and the Powerhouse museum to 
Parramatta, Turnbull was asked about the WestConnex project.

She said it would complete the M4 motorway and increase capacity on the M5, 
and concluded “when we connect the M4 and the M5, that will be an excellent 
thing”.


Harmer then asked if her guest was disturbed about the loss of heritage in 
Haberfield, which is famously full of federation houses – theentire suburb is 
listed as a Conservation Area 
<http://www.ashfield.nsw.gov.au/page/haberfield.html>.

Turnbull replied: “Around Haberfield? I’m not aware that there are houses 
going to be demolished at Haberfield.

“I’m not aware of the loss of heritage at Haberfield, I have to tell you.”

Turnbull then said she would investigate the issue, but “in the meantime, can 
I say, it is being built”.

“When you drive out west to Parramatta and Penrith … you can hear the machines 
drilling away – it is happening.”

The National Trust lists a total of 13 heritage items to be demolished in 
Haberfield <https://www.nationaltrust.org.au/initiatives/westconnex-m4-east/> 
due to the WestConnex M4 East project, including federation houses such as 9 
Wattle Street.

A further 53 houses are listed as proposed for demolition within the 
Haberfield conservation area.

Albanese took to Twitter to say the comment was “beyond belief”.
Anthony Albanese (@AlboMP) 
On @702sydney <https://twitter.com/702sydney> it is beyond belief that Lucy 
Turnbull in charge of Sydney planning is "unaware" of any Haberfield homes 
being demolished

Albanese told Guardian Australia: “Given Lucy Turnbull’s statement that she is 
completely unaware of the impact of the WestConnex project on Haberfield, one 
wonders what she has been doing as chair of the Greater Sydney Commission.”

The state MP for Summer Hill, Jo Haylen, said it was astounding the head of 
the planning body had “no idea what is going on in Haberfield”.

“Anyone who has driven along Parramatta Road lately will know that we’ve lost 
swathes of heritage homes in what the National Trust has called the biggest hit 
on heritage in Australia,” she said.

 “Turnbull’s comments are a slap in the face to the hundreds of families and 
residents dealing with unfair compulsory acquisitions and the devastating 
impacts of the demolition.”

The New South Wales government Westconnex Haberfield fact sheet 
<http://www.westconnex.com.au/documents/m4east_eis_haberfieldfactsheet.pdf> 
acknowledges that some heritage items are impacted by the project, and says 
that those “directly impacted” will be photographed.

Destruction of heritage houses, including in Haberfield, has been the subject 
ofcommunity campaigns

.

Westconnex is due to open to traffic in 2019. The M4 East section is due to 
extend the existing M4 motorway from Homebush to Haberfield.

A Greater Sydney Commission spokeswoman told Guardian Australia it was 
established in January to lead metropolitan planning for greater Sydney but the 
WestConnex project “was designed and approved prior to the establishment of the 
commission”.

“The Greater Sydney Commission understands there are aspects of WestConnex 
which have met with a lot of community concern.

“However, the commission was not involved in any issues consequential to stage 
one or stage two of the project, including compulsory acquisition of houses and 
heritage houses at Haberfield.”
