Winning tip Capileira, Alpujarras


Off the beaten track, yet only two-and-a-half hours from Málaga airport, 
Capileira is spectacular, full of life and dead cheap, with awesome mountain 
views. Finca Los Llanos or Reál de Poqueira have pools, and charge about £65 
for two. Winding paths lead to rivers, villages and peaks. Restaurants in the 
steep cobbled streets are cheap, generous and wonderful.

 Zoorooms, Barcelona 
Zoorooms, Barcelona
Zoorooms is a boutique guesthouse in the Modernist Quarter of Barcelona: the 
Gaudí buildings are just down the street and the area is full of bars and 
restaurants. Smart modern en suite rooms cost from €80 a night (minimum two 
nights) but the true gem of thishostal is the large, sunny terrace where guests 
can lounge on hammocks, cook a barbecue, or drink a bottle of wine in the 
evening, away from the mayhem.

The Bunker, Barcelona
The Bunker (or el Turó de la Rovira) is the best-kept secret of Barcelona. 
With its fantastic views across the city, this old war bunker is not to be 
missed. You can see everything, from the mountain of Tibidabo to the right, to 
the ocean and Montjuïc. It's a bit of a climb from the Metro Alfons X (line 4) 
station but well worth the effort.

Benimaclet, Valencia 
If you're looking to escape the touristy centre of Valencia (and the prices) 
without having to leave the city, try a day trip to Benimaclet. Originally a 
separate village, over the river, it merged with Valencia with the city's 
expansion, but maintains much of itspueblo feel. Bars sell tapas for €1.50, or 
pick up a paella from anasador for around €3 for a portion big enough for two. 
Eat it in the Jardines del Real, the main park in Valencia, only a couple of 
hundred metres away.

Camino de Santiago

You can either walk or cycle the 300 miles from the French border to Santiago 
de Compostela by staying inalbergues every 10-15 miles, some of which are free 
of charge or only ask for a small donation. The main cost of the trip is food 
and drink. I have spent nearly three months on the Camino sightseeing, learning 
more of the language and making life-long friends – all for around £200 plus 
travel to and from Spain. Start your holiday in Pamplona at the tourist office 
and ask for directions and further information from there. It's easy: I've done 
it six times and I'm in my mid-70s!

Belchite, nr Zaragoza 
If you get bored of history preserved in cabinets or guarded by hawk-eyed 
staff, try Belchite. This village, an hour outside Zaragoza, came under heavy 
attack during the Spanish Civil War. It was so badly damaged, villagers 
abandoned it and rebuilt it about a kilometre away. What's left is a time 
capsule of crumbling houses, churches, a clock tower and more, with loads of 
little gems to uncover amid the rubble.

El Refugio Hostel, nr Ronda 
Lovely, friendly, super-relaxed hostel set in a quiet village near Ronda, 
which is classic Hemingway-style Spain. Double rooms cost just €38.50. Sit on 
the roof terrace, drinktinto de verano and watch the swallows dive while the 
sun sets over the mountains. Beautiful mountain walks, excellent bird watching 
and ridiculously starry skies at night. Enjoy the very delicious dinners which 
are cooked by an ex-chef.

Parque del Alamillo, Seville
This enormous park is a bit of a way from the main attractions: with wide 
boulevards, lakes and lawns there's loads of space for cycling, rollerblading 
or just lazing peacefully with a book. There is also a large bar/restaurant. 
Families gather there for parties, setting up camp all day with picnics, games 
and wine. There are often fairs and free concerts, and I once happened upon a 
dog show in one corner. Children love the miniature railway and you can even 
try out cableskiing.

El Rincón del Búho, Seville 
I discovered this place after the gas bottle in our flat ran out one day. My 
friend texted: "Go to El Rincón del Búho, you can get amenú del día for €3.50!" 
It took me about three goes to find it, as it looks like flats from the 
outside. Advertised as an artistic and socio-cultural project, the venue offers 
music events (including flamenco), exhibitions, theatre and workshops. Cheap 
snacks – €1 for anempanada (small pasty) or slice of pizza – and bottled beers 
are on sale when events are on. The €3.50 lunch is available 2pm-4pm Thursdays 
and Fridays, with vegetarians well-catered for.

El Pulguilla, Nerja 
By far the best tapas bar in Nerja. Order a small cerveza at the bar and then 
choose from an array of fresh seafood and meats, free with your drink. We sat 
there for three hours watching Spanish football one night and made our way 
through their entire tapas collection twice! The bill came to €25!
