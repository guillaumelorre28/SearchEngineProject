How is it possible that I can be Nicolas Cage, most mumblingly, intensely 
earnest actor of a generation, yetthe IRS <http://www.irs.gov/> should 
be forcing sales of my property? This is the question I asked my son, Kal-El 
(it's Superman's birth name).

For years, I have opted against taking lower-paying roles in order to star in 
the most artless action blockbusters. I was inGone In 60 Seconds 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187078/>. Hell, I was in Ghost Rider 
<http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/ghostrider/>. My answerphone message 
says, "I'll do it." How is it possible that I have no cash?

Kal-El paused. Then he took my hand and said, "I don't want to come over 
precocious, but it seems to this four-year-old that you maybe bought too much 
stuff."

I flipped through the two entries in my acting Rolodex, and selected the one 
in which I do my special inner trembling expression. "What stuff?" I mumbled 
winningly. "Lots of actors have yachts, son."

He sighed imperceptibly, or at least less hammily than I might have done. 
"Yes, but we have afleet. And 15 homes, including European castles acquired 
after you developed some sort of schlossomania. We have an island. And a 
dinosaur skull. We have a collection of shrunken heads. So closely does our 
lifestyle resemble a Xanadu parody that you might be referred to as Citizen 
Cage, except you spend more than you earn."

"Oh Kal-El!" I laughed indulgently. "Daddy wishes the world did work like 
that. But get back to your toys while I figure out what we need to buy to make 
this go away."
