Thank you so much for your company and please join the brilliant Hannah 
Verdier same time next Wednesday for all the interview-based carnage on 
uncomfortably sticky office chairs.

Have a brilliant final! I’m at @jnraeside if you need any tips on removing 
excess oil from your hands.

On the basis of that task, the worst person by a hundred miles was Richard, 
closely followed by Charleine. He must like both of their business plans.

So with five wazzocks to go, it’s time for the interviews.

“Fantastic,” says Bret. I’ve not heard that reaction before. Alan reassures 
him that he’s an honourable man which is lovely coming from Alan.

He lets the others go and Charleine is already in tears as she thanks him.

You're fired

I think it’ll be more than one person. But who? WHO?

Gary, Charleine, Bret and Richard nod passively yet confidently as Alan begins 
the dance of doom.

And the loser is...Bret.

Bret barely draws breath before Alan bashes him down for letting Richard

Bret says he’s always the first person to say, “Guys”. Every team needs a 
person who can says guys. Right guys?

The marked four return to the boardroom and Char is first to defend herself. 
She recaps her entire time on the show, flagging up sales figures.

Gary goes next and talks a lot without saying anything at all.

Richard reminds us he’s won 8 out of 9 tasks and made 4 million billion quid 
on property last week. Anyone can do that in London, mate. That’s how Alan got 
rich.

Charleine can’t decide who to bring back but eventually picks Gary because 
she’s panicking and Alan is nagging her. Joseph goes back to the house. Bret 
finally sees sense and says he will bring back Richard.

Vana and Joseph are safe and will get to show Alan their business plans. The 
others look afraid/sad/flatulent.

Bret is finally under the spotlight for not understanding the concept behind 
his own product. While Richard claims he wasn’t told how the crisps were made, 
Bret tries to be noble and says he won’t rip into a colleague for the sake of 
it. Save yourself, Bret. Ditch Single White Male over there and finger him for 
this.

Charleine goes outside for a cry. The others carry on without her. No, she’s 
back again explaining that her tears are for the poor quality for the product. 
Even though she made it. Just her. It was definitely NOT her fault.

Gary, Charleine and Joseph are ribbed for their claims. She is crying. Perhaps 
she finally feels bad for claiming that her revolting snack might cure cancer.

Back in the boardroom, things are no clearer. This isn’t a nil-nil draw, says 
Alan because they all lost. Nice logic.

The two PMs will be brought back with one team member each for the final 
reckoning. Sack them all sack them all sack them all sack them all.

They all leave in oily disgrace. He could fire all of them and we could call 
this the final.

Vana knows the oil was a big factor in her product not selling but she throws 
interference towards Richard’s “raw” error. Gary shuffles the blame towards 
Charleine and they all sit in the sad cafe thinking about champagne cocktails 
at the top of Tower 42.

Nul points

Wowsers trousers - literally not one sale for either team. The result they all 
dreaded and we all hoped for. “That’s never happened before” says Alan like a 
man embarrassed in a love situation.

ALAN'S ZINGER

We’ve waited a while folks but here it is. Alan’s big drop-kick this week is a 
line about an iconic vegetable being Elvis Parsley. Let’s all bow our heads and 
think about Syria for a bit to cheer ourselves up.

Gary reiterates his seven GREAT years at the major supermarket chain but 
neglects to tell us why he left. We’ll gloss over it.

The crisp team tenses up as Alan opens a packet of their onion “crisps”. To be 
fair, the global environmental disaster that spills out is ridiculous. Alan’s 
pudgy fingers are all greasy and I can’t help but think of sausages.

Thank you so much for your company and please join the brilliant Hannah 
Verdier same time next Wednesday for all the interview-based carnage on 
uncomfortably sticky office chairs.

Have a brilliant final! I’m at @jnraeside if you need any tips on removing 
excess oil from your hands.
 
On the basis of that task, the worst person by a hundred miles was Richard, 
closely followed by Charleine. He must like both of their business plans.

So with five wazzocks to go, it’s time for the interviews.
 
“Fantastic,” says Bret. I’ve not heard that reaction before. Alan reassures 
him that he’s an honourable man which is lovely coming from Alan.

He lets the others go and Charleine is already in tears as she thanks him.
 
I think it’ll be more than one person. But who? WHO?

Gary, Charleine, Bret and Richard nod passively yet confidently as Alan begins 
the dance of doom.

And the loser is...Bret.
 
Bret barely draws breath before Alan bashes him down for letting Richard 
dominate him.

Bret says he’s always the first person to say, “Guys”. Every team needs a 
person who can says guys. Right guys?
 
The marked four return to the boardroom and Char is first to defend herself. 
She recaps her entire time on the show, flagging up sales figures.

Gary goes next and talks a lot without saying anything at all.

Richard reminds us he’s won 8 out of 9 tasks and made 4 million billion quid 
on property last week. Anyone can do that in London, mate. That’s how Alan got 
rich.
 
Karrrren speaks up for Charleine in a backhanded way and says that she has 
fallen apart today but she never gives up.
 
Charleine can’t decide who to bring back but eventually picks Gary because 
she’s panicking and Alan is nagging her. Joseph goes back to the house. Bret 
finally sees sense and says he will bring back Richard.

Vana and Joseph are safe and will get to show Alan their business plans. The 
others look afraid/sad/flatulent.
 
Bret is finally under the spotlight for not understanding the concept behind 
his own product. While Richard claims he wasn’t told how the crisps were made, 
Bret tries to be noble and says he won’t rip into a colleague for the sake of 
it. Save yourself, Bret. Ditch Single White Male over there and finger him for 
this.
 
Charleine goes outside for a cry. The others carry on without her. No, she’s 
back again explaining that her tears are for the poor quality for the product. 
Even though she made it. Just her. It was definitely NOT her fault.
 
Gary, Charleine and Joseph are ribbed for their claims. She is crying. Perhaps 
she finally feels bad for claiming that her revolting snack might cure cancer.
 
Back in the boardroom, things are no clearer. This isn’t a nil-nil draw, says 
Alan because they all lost. Nice logic.

The two PMs will be brought back with one team member each for the final 
reckoning. Sack them all sack them all sack them all sack them all.
 
They all leave in oily disgrace. He could fire all of them and we could call 
this the final.

Vana knows the oil was a big factor in her product not selling but she throws 
interference towards Richard’s “raw” error. Gary shuffles the blame towards 
Charleine and they all sit in the sad cafe thinking about champagne cocktails 
at the top of Tower 42.
 
Wowsers trousers - literally not one sale for either team. The result they all 
dreaded and we all hoped for. “That’s never happened before” says Alan like a 
man embarrassed in a love situation.
 
We’ve waited a while folks but here it is. Alan’s big drop-kick this week is a 
line about an iconic vegetable being Elvis Parsley. Let’s all bow our heads and 
think about Syria for a bit to cheer ourselves up.
 
Gary reiterates his seven GREAT years at the major supermarket chain but

The crisp team tenses up as Alan opens a packet of their onion “crisps”. To be 
fair, the global environmental disaster that spills out is ridiculous. Alan’s 
pudgy fingers are all greasy and I can’t help but think of sausages.
 
Gary explains the crossings out on his packaging. Charleine looks and sounds 
like she’s already given up.
