They’re a Parisian band I adored in the late 70s and early 80s. English people 
always referred rather disparagingly to French music as “frog rock” andTéléphone
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l-OhSpKLdQ> are the only good frog rock band 
that ever was. They were very rock’n’roll and supported the Stones,Television 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/17/television-sage-gateshead-review>
 and Iggy Pop. Now I’m excited because after years of rumours, they’re finally 
reforming after three decades apart. So I’m hugely looking forward to their 
gigs later this year. As for British bands, I always follow Blur – I’m a big 
fan, particularly of Damon. I go to see anyone who comes through Paris, where I 
live now – Blur, Nick Cave,Steve Earle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/22/steve-earle-review-royal-festival-hall-dukes-terraplane>
. I was meant to be going to U2’s gig on the night of theterrorist attacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris-attacks> in November, so I was very 
proud thatthey came back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/dec/08/eagles-of-death-metal-join-u2-on-paris-stage-in-wake-of-bataclan-terrorist-attack-video>

Citizen Lord 
<http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/stella-tillyard/citizen-lord-edward-fitzgerald-1763-1798-9780701165383.aspx>
 by Stella Tillyard

I’m obsessed with Irish history and loving this biography by Tillyard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/19/stella-tillyard-paperback-qanda> 
of Edward Fitzgerald, an aristocrat who was involved in the revolutionary 
republican movement. I have no Irish roots, I’m just fascinated. For example, 
do you know what a plantation really means? Not just coffee or sugar, but in 
Elizabethan times, it meant planting people. The English planted Scottish 
Protestants in Ireland to keep the Irish down.

 On Two Years, Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights: ‘The fantasy elements are 
magical and it’s gorgeously written.’ Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian
I always read three books at once, so if I get bored with one, I can turn to 
another. As well asCitizen Lord, I’m reading Rushdie’s latest novel, Two Years, 
Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/13/two-years-eight-months-twenty-eight-nights-review-salman-rushdie>
, and another calledRoses of Picardie by Simon Raven 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/16/guardianobituaries.books>. I 
love, love, love the Rushdie – I think it’s my favourite of his, ahead even of
Midnight’s Children. The fantasy elements are just magical and, of course, it’s 
gorgeously written.

A friend of mine who sells rare books lent me his copy of Roses of Picardie 
and it’s fabulous. The roses of the title are actually rubies with a curse on 
them. They’re passed down the generations and all sorts of incredible things 
happen.

 Throne of Blood by Akira Kurosawa: ‘It’s Macbeth relocated to feudal Japan.’

A few weeks ago, I was supposed to be going to see the French version of 
Macbeth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/23/macbeth-review-fassbender-and-cotillard-full-of-sound-and-fury-in-significant-shakespeare-adaptation>
 starring Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender, but a work thing overran and 
I missed the screening. So in a fury I thought, “Well, fuck that” and watched
Throne of Blood by Akira Kurosawa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/mar/23/akira-kurosawa-100-google-doodle-anniversary>
 on DVD instead. It’sMacbeth relocated to feudal Japan and shot halfway up 
Mount Fuji. Stunning.

He’s a wonderful pop artist who recently exhibited at the Mayor Gallery in 
Cork Street. I couldn’t make it because I was touring, which was frustrating, 
but I wish I’d been there because I love Colin’s work. Colin was around in the 
60s and is a very dear friend of mine. He’s an incredibly gifted draughtsman 
who also works in collage and sculpture. I don’t own any of Colin’s pieces, 
alas, but I have got a very beautiful silk screen ofSwingeing London

 Hanawa: ‘They have fantastic green tea and I love the smoked eel sushi.’ 
I don’t eat out much – I’m a very good cook, if I say so myself – but when I 
do, I usually go to this Japanese restaurant in rue Bayard and order lots of 
little dishes: scallops, beef with ginger and I’m addicted to the salads they 
make with no oil. They have fantastic green tea and I love the smoked eel 
sushi. It’s got a cool, Zen-like ambience. I don’t feel I’m blowing the secret 
– it’s quite expensive so if you can afford it, good luck to you. And see you 
there!
