Researchers have identified regions beneath the oceans where large volumes of 
carbon dioxide 
<http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2013/dec/13_216.shtml> could be 
safely stored. They have identified five potential regions in offshore 
Australia, Japan, Siberia, South Africa and Bermuda. PhD student Chiara Marieni 
says: "We have found regions that have the potential to store decades to 
hundreds of years of industrial carbon dioxide emissions although the largest 
regions are far off shore. However, further work is needed in these regions to 
accurately measure local sediment conditions and sample the basalt beneath 
before this potential can be confirmed." The research shows that previous 
studies, which concentrated on the effect of pressure to liquefy the CO2 but 
ignored temperature, have pointed to the wrong locations and thus more likely 
to escape.

A new peer review model would improve quality and veracity of scientific 
research,a study suggests 
<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12786.html>. 
Researchers say that an improved model of the peer review system, which is set 
up to make sure research is of the highest quality, is needed to ensure only 
top quality research gets published. The study found that peer review performs 
best when a degree of subjectivity (for example, their belief about whether the 
result is correct) is allowed, since this helps more information to be 
transmitted through the decision and protects against the risk of scientists 
converging on an incorrect answer. An improved peer review model includes the 
opportunity for scientists to comment on and critique research after it has 
been published. This would provide scientists with more opportunity to 
truthfully reveal their opinions, improve the flow of information in science 
and avoid the risk of 'herding' – where scientists' behaviour may be influenced 
by their peers. Mike Peacey, one of the study's researchers, says: "Scientists 
are increasingly concerned that many published research findings may be false. 
Our findings demonstrate a novel way of how the peer review process can be 
improved through a post-publication peer review."

Research shows <http://www.wlv.ac.uk/default.aspx?page=38224> that lack of 
sunlight can impair the performance of professional ballet dancers. The study 
looked at people who train indoors during the winter months and found low 
vitamin D levels, through lack of sunlight exposure, links to impaired muscle 
strength and increases risk of injury. Prof Matthew Wyon, head of dance science 
at the University of Wolverhampton, says: "Vitamin D is important for bone 
development and has a wide range of functions. In a deficient state, dancers 
are at increased risk of bone injuries and this latest research indicates an 
increased risk of muscle injury, which can be detrimental to their health and 
their careers. "In a population known to be at risk of these deficiencies, such 
as ballet dancers, medical staff and teachers should consider supplying their 
dancers with appropriate levels of vitamin D whilst training indoors to help 
them build on their core muscle strengths to avoid injury. These findings could 
also be extrapolated to cover other sports and training activities that take 
place indoors."

Some of the world's most rare and important biblical texts have been digitized 
and published online <http://bav.bodleian.ox.ac.uk> by the Bodleian and Vatican 
libraries, which will eventually create an online archive of 1.5m pages. 
Portions of the Bodleian and Vatican libraries' collections of Hebrew 
manuscripts, Greek manuscripts, and early printed books have been selected for 
digitization by a team of scholars and curators from around the world. The new 
website features zoomable images which enable detailed scholarly analysis and 
study and also features articles on the conservation and digitized techniques 
used during the project. Richard Ovenden, interim Bodley's librarian, says: "We 
hope that through digitizing and making openly accessible some of the most 
significant books in our collections we will increase their potential for 
research and broader understanding of these ancient texts."

Research shows a ban on multibuy promotions for alcohol implemented in 
Scotland in October 2011failed to reduce the amount of alcohol purchased 
<http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/new-study-reveals-that-the-ban-on-alcohol-multi-buy-promotions-in-scotland-did-not-reduce-the-amount>
. The study found that Scottish consumers started buying fewer products per 
shopping trip than they would have without the ban, but went out to buy beer 
and cider more frequently, leaving the overall amount purchased unchanged. Marc 
Suhrcke, from the University of East Anglia, says: "More encompassing policy 
will be needed to achieve the goal of reducing excessive alcohol consumption 
and related harms. Partially banning price promotions leaves the door open for 
industry to just switch to other forms of price promotions, or indeed to reduce 
the overall price of alcohol." He adds: "Imposing greater excise duties on 
alcohol and introducing minimum unit pricing have been shown to reduce alcohol 
consumption and associated harms. The government has recently put on hold plans 
to introduce minimum unit pricing."

An archaeology team has uncovered a sink hole of material that may hold vital 
information about the plant species 
<http://www.kingston.ac.uk/news/article/1169/12-nov-2013-archaeological-dig-uncovers-sink-hole-of-evidence-from-neolithic-period/>
 thriving there 6,000 years ago. Dr Helen Wickstead, based at Kingston 
University's faculty of art, design and architecture, says: "The site at 
Damerham is on chalk land, so we don't often find materials like this that 
capture and preserve the plant remains – pollen or phytoliths – from a specific 
time period." She adds: "The sink hole contained orange sand with a yellow and 
grey clay and we are very hopeful that, within this material, there will be 
evidence of plant life that will help us continue to piece together the puzzle 
of human habitation on this significant site."
