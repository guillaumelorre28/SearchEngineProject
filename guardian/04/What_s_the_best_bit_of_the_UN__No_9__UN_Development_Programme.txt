Alongside its better-known sister agencies, the UNDP may seem a dull 
workhorse, lacking the star quality of Unicef or the World Food Programme.

Perhaps that’s because its remit – supporting democratic governance, poverty 
reduction, crisis prevention, improving resilience and strengthening earnings – 
is too all-encompassing to lend itself to the kind of catchy slogans that might 
capture the public’s imagination. The UNDP prides itself on its “thought 
leadership” – not a particularly poster-friendly concept.

The UNDP has an annual budget of about $5bn and works in about 170 countries 
<http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/operations/about_us.html>. Its 
programmes are diverse to say the least: solar energy projects in Mali; helping 
Liberia prepare for the the election of Africa’s first woman president in 2005; 
empowering women in Somalia; employing young people in the Central African 
Republic to repair roads in an attempt to end the vicious sectarian violence 
that has claimed thousands of lives since 2013; and making sure staff battling 
Ebola in west Africa this year were paid.


Last year, the UNDP says it created nearly 1m jobs in low-income communities. 
It says it helped to register 18 million new voters worldwide. It helped ensure 
that antiviral medication was provided to 1.4 million people infected with 
HIV/Aids.

It is also big on data – again, not a crowd pleaser but ever more important as 
the world embarks on a new development agenda that will be worth little if the 
indicators to measure progress do not work. The UNDP’s annual human development 
report, and the accompanying index, are baseline tools for those working in 
development.

While you may not be familiar with the UNDP, you will perhaps recognise its 
administrator, Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand who has 
been tipped as a successor to secretary general Ban Ki-moon when he steps down 
in 2016. She is the UN’s third highest ranking official.


Clark, who has argued that the UN “has to be made to work” and suggests that 
the 70th anniversary of the body’s creation this year might be a good time to 
think about change, has also trimmed the UNDP. Staff positions at the New York 
headquarters are being reduced by around 30%, with more staff moving out to 
regional hubs. The agency has around 6,500 employees.

The UNDP also coordinates international and national efforts to achieve the 
millennium development goals, which expire this year. So it will need to be 
lean and mean if it is to do the same with the more ambitious post-2015 
development agenda,comprising 17 goals and 169 targets

A skilled carpenter, Dhal Bahadur Karki spent much of his adult life working 
as a labourer in Nepal. Frustrated at the poor wages and insecurity, he paid a 
human resources agent a hefty sum to travel to the United Arab Emirates to 
work. But when he reached Dubai, he didn’t get the carpenter job he was 
promised.

Detained for working illegally and deported back to Nepal, Karki was faced 
with more troubles: no job, a family of six to take care of, and the social 
stigma of returning from abroad without having earned any money. “I was almost 
depressed,” he says.

The Micro-Enterprise Development Programme 
<http://www.np.undp.org/content/nepal/en/home/operations/projects/poverty_reduction/medep/home.html>
 (MEDEP), a poverty reduction project run by the government of Nepal and the 
UNDP, helped him set up a small business.

Karki now employs five people at his furniture factory in Namdu, some 100 
miles from the capital, and his products have found markets as far away as 
Kathmandu.

“I had carpentry skills but had no idea about entrepreneurship, loan 
facilities and market linkages. MEDEP helped me realise the potential of 
starting up an enterprise in which I could work, as well as own an enterprise,” 
Karki said.
