The Manchester United winger Antonio Valencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/antonio-valencia> came close to a 
recurrence of the injury that severely disrupted his last season and will miss 
Ecuador's second Copa América Group B match, against Paraguay on Saturday.

After missing six months of United's title-winning campaign with a dislocated 
and broken left ankle Valencia may have feared another lengthy spell on the 
sidelines after damaging the same joint in the 0-0 draw with Paraguay in Santa 
Fe on Sunday.

"[His opponent] stepped on his foot and very nearly fractured it again," said 
Ecuador's team doctor, Tony Ocampo.

"He has a bruise on the spot where he has a titanium plate, he couldn't put 
his weight on his foot, but the swelling has gone down about 40% since Sunday. 
He won't make it for Saturday but he'll be there for Brazil [on 13 July]."
