Dear Carole, Why are women so obsessed with the size of a man's cock – wanting 
ones 6 inches and over and kicking others aside when they really should be 
concentrating on the emotional connection and love being shared, putting the 
size of the man's cock right out of her mind?

Carole replies:
The origins of the primate sex drive go back more than 60m years to the late 
Mesozoic era when the first primate evolved. A lot of sex has taken place since 
then, and a significant proportion has been motivated by female choice between 
rival males.1

 Female primates can experience multiple orgasms, and it has been theorised 
that ancestral hominid females sought out males who would sexually satisfy 
them. Through the mechanism of sexual selection, this will have increased penis 
size and altered structure.

Today, the average erect gorilla penis is 3cm (1.25 inches) 
<http://digitaldutch.com/unitconverter/length.htm> long, the average chimp or 
bonobo penis comes in at around 8cm and the average human penis stands at 
around 13cm. Most primates, including chimpanzees, have apenis bone 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis_bone> and achieve erections through muscle 
contraction.2 The human penis has evolved the unusual system of vasocongestion 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasocongestion> to achieve erection, making the 
erect organ far more flexible than that of other primate species.

This unique adaptation is thought to have been selected through female mate 
choice, and by the timeHomo erectus arrived on the scene, the hominid penis was 
significantly longer, fatter and more bendy than our ape cousins'. It has even 
been theorised that bipedalism evolved in humans to allow the fashionably new, 
larger, flexible penis to be displayed to discerning females.3

Interestingly, while the human penis is the biggest of all the ape species in 
length and girth, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of body size, the 
human testes are not. As a proportion of overall body size, chimp and bonobo 
testes are twice as large as human testes, whereas gorilla testes are half the 
size. Why?

Correlations can be found between primate mating systems and male genital 
anatomy.4 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8153136> In 
multi-male/multi-female groups, males must compete to reproduce and frequently 
the competition takes place inside the female reproductive tract. The more 
sperm a male produces and ejaculates inside a female the greater the 
probability that one of his will fertilise the ovum. Female chimps or bonobos 
in oestrus often mate with several different individuals, so males must 
reproductively compete in this way and larger testes will therefore confer 
greater reproductive fitness.

By contrast, female gorillas live in harems and don't often get a chance to 
exercise a choice between mates, though occasionally a female and a male from 
outside the group may risk it. The impressive 200kg (400lb) silverback gorilla 
does have the smallest penis and testes of all male apes, but his massive 
canines and biceps and his controlling, jealous temper allow him to intimidate 
and fight off potential competitors.

Human testis size indicates that males evolved under conditions in which their 
sperm competed inside females, but perhaps not to the same extent as chimp 
sperm. But the larger human penis suggests that hominids needed to keep females 
with choice sexually satisfied. Ancestral females would have experienced a 
sexual freedom denied in Western cultures today and it has been suggested that 
our ancestors went through a period of matriarchy and enhanced female choice.5 
<http://songweaver.com/info/bonobos.html>

When compared with patriarchal chimps, the matriarchal bonobo is a far more 
sex-oriented ape. Enthusiastic females initiate both hetero- and homosexual 
activity, particularly when aggression begins to surface, resulting in 
satisfied, contented and peaceful bonobos. Patriarchy, on the other hand, 
correlates with a lack of openly displayed female choice.

Women with choice are not all "obsessed with the size of a man's cock". Women 
are as aware as men that to build a stable relationship you need trust, shared 
interests and the ability to keep each other amused. But a woman is not going 
to "put the size of a man's cock right out of her mind", because she can't. 
Females have an evolved interest in the size of a man's penis, which has been 
sexually selected for its size and shape. But humans are also selected for 
creativity – we are highly innovative, imaginative apes. Accordingly, women's 
minds can be aroused by creativity and being sexually imaginative can be 
physically arousing, adding satisfying metaphorical inches to one's love life.
