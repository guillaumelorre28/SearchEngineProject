Kiely Rowan, the company behind the colourful Orla Kiely fashion and lifestyle 
brand, has revealed a 16% rise in profits despite lower sales.

Operating profit at the company, whose fans include Alexa Chung, Keira 
Knightley <https://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley> and Lena Dunham, 
rose to £314,339 in the year to March. Sales slipped 10% to £9.1m as the 
company said it had moved away from discounting and focused on growing its 
retail and online businesses. The company, which also owns the Olive & Orange 
brand, has two shops in London and one in New York and sells products in 
thousands of other stores including John Lewis in the UK and Target in the US. 
Originally from Ireland, Kiely began designing hats before moving on to 
handbags and other accessories.

Dermott Rowan, chief executive of Kiely Rowan and the designer’s husband, 
said: “The business today is something really special – sustainable and 
profitable, with well-managed product lines. The brands have an exciting 
future.”

In accounts filed at Companies House, Kiely Rowan said it would continue to 
expand in the US, Asia and Australia and seek out new markets.
