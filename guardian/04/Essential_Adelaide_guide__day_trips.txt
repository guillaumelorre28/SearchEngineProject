Glenelg beach

When Adelaide was established in 1836, its founders chose to build the city 
inland, to reduce the risk of invasion. Yet it is a mere stone's throw from the 
coast, with atramlink connecting the city and the sea 
<http://glenelgsa.com.au/public-transport> in 20 minutes for $9 return. Despite 
having a harbour and numerous luxury apartments, the front itself is 
surprisingly undeveloped, and the main streetJetty Road <http://bit.ly/n6yjey> 
is the best bet for shopping and eating. On the beach a pier doubles up as a 
diving board and sunshade, as city-dwellers escape the heat. Other beaches 
worth a trip include neighbouringBrighton <http://bit.ly/WqcfXX>, art deco 
Semaphore <http://www.semaphoresa.com.au/> and Largs Bay in the north-west – 
all a short journey away by car or public transport.

Port Adelaide
 Red Lime Shack in Port Adelaide 
The city port is in a suburb 14km to the north-west, and makes for a fun 
excursion through streets lined with heritage buildings. Have a mosey round the
maritime <http://maritime.historysa.com.au/>, railway 
<http://www.natrailmuseum.org.au/> or childhood 
<http://www.portenf.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=701&c=18615> museums, grab a bite at 
theRed Lime Shack <http://www.facebook.com/RedLimeShack> or a drink in The 
British <http://www.thebritishhotel.com.au>. Take a boat out to watch dolphins 
or get lucky and spot them nearer the shore. There is also a strong cultural 
scene in the neighbourhood, not least from local theatre companyVitalstatistix 
<http://www.facebook.com/VitalstatistixTheatreCompany>.

Barossa

There are many wine regions within reach of the city, but one of the most 
historic is the Barossa Valley, 56km to the north-east. Distinctive for its 
Prussian and English settlers, their influences are still visible today. The 
self-contained, palm-linedSeppeltsfield <http://www.seppeltsfield.com.au> is 
the origin of many a bottle of fortified wine, while the quaintly charming town 
ofAngaston <http://www.angaston.org.au/> now has a superb Italian cafe and 
cookery school. <http://www.casacarboni.com.au> You can make a pilgrimage to 
where your local UK corner shop's finest bottle ofJacob's Creek 
<http://bit.ly/Ymfddm> started life, and, along with a lot of Chinese tourists, 
see that creek. Among the 200 wineries there are many boutique options too. Try 
a tasting at the family-runWhistler <http://www.whistlerwines.com.au>, or in 
the gingerbread-style timber house atTscharke <http://www.tscharke.com.au/>, 
both on Seppeltsfield Road, for a more intimate Barossa wine experience. On 
Saturday morning, head to theweekly farmer's market 
<http://www.barossafarmersmarket.com> on Stockwell Road, where the whole 
community convenes to buy fresh produce and trade local gossip.

Adelaide Hills

Half-an-hour out of the city to the south-east you can find a rural retreat in 
the hills, with a microclimate of its own, that even brings snow in the coolest 
of winters. Prussian settlers made their home here in the early 19th century, 
and many a German tourist is bemused by the quaint faux-Bavarian town ofHahndorf
 <http://bit.ly/13zy6Ox>. With more wineries – the Lane (thelane.com.au 
<http://www.thelane.com.au>) does top-notch paired food and wine in its 
restaurant – koalas and dingoes aplenty atGorge Wildlife Park 
<http://www.gorgewildlifepark.com.au/>, and culture at artist Hans Heysen's 
home, The Cedars <http://www.hansheysen.com.au/>, it makes a varied day out.

Fleurieu Peninsula

An hour south from Adelaide, this is a popular spot for holidaymakers looking 
for a quiet place by the coast to fish, or just eat freshly caught salmon, 
trout, bream and mullet. You may recognise some of the scenery since it was one 
of several locations in the region used in the Clive Owen filmThe Boys are Back 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926380/>. At Victor peninsula whales can be seen 
<http://bit.ly/Wqe5YU> close to the shore in winter (May-October), and Second 
Valley has explorable caves along the rugged coast. A road trip in this 
direction provides a good excuse to pick up some bottles from theMcLaren Vale 
<http://www.mclarenvale.info> wine region en route (see below), or there are 
more wineries when you get there.

Heysen Trail

Ranges. Photograph: David Foster/Alamy 
This impressive 1,200km walking route, named after local artist Hans Heysen 
<http://www.hansheysen.com.au>, connects up the Flinders Ranges (see below) and 
the Fleurieu Peninsula. You obviously won't be able to even scratch the surface 
in a day – andsome sections are shut during the summer 
<http://www.heysentrail.asn.au/heysen_trail/fire_danger_season.php> 
(November-April) due to fire risk – so pick a manageable route, referring to 
the Friends' of the Heysen Trail's comprehensive site and Google map for 
inspiration:heysentrail.asn.au <http://www.heysentrail.asn.au>. It also runs 
group walks <http://www.heysentrail.asn.au/walks/walk_grades.php#starter> along 
the route (from $8).

Flinders Ranges

Some of the oldest fossils in the world originate from the dramatic Flinders 
Ranges. It's possible to do in a (long) day, a 3.5-hour drive north of the 
city, but you may prefer to stay overnight. Indigenous people havelived in the 
area for thousands of years 
<http://www.ritas-outback-guide.com/AboriginesOfTheFlindersRanges.html>, and 
the scenery isbest experienced with an Aboriginal guide 
<http://bookabee.com.au/aboriginal-tours/extended-tours/4-day-flinders-ranges-experience/>
. If you are able to stay longer, there is plenty of outback to explore and 
camping out under the stars is a must. If trekking doesn't appeal there is the 
heritagePichi Richi Railway <http://www.prr.org.au/cms/index.php> service 
between Quorn and Port Augusta.

Port Lincoln

If you fancy travelling further afield and you like diving, Port Lincoln is an 
hour away by plane. When there, you can swim with Australian sea lions, blue 
fin tuna and even partake in cage shark diving.Charlie Brooker once attempted 
to do just that 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2012/jan/27/australia-diving-sharks-tuna-brooker>
 but alas only found tuna.

Kangaroo Island

Australia's third biggest island, which is the same size as Puerto Rico, can 
be visited in a day trip organised bySealink 
<http://www.sealink.com.au/kangaroo-island-tours/day-tours/kangaroo-island-highlights-day-tour/>
 for AUD $248 (£170). Coaches pick up from Adelaide hotels at the crack of 
dawn, before a short ferry crossing, guided tour of the island, and buffet 
lunch. If you are short of time it is a great way to see some of the island's 
highlights, including freely roaming wildlife such as the bouncing creatures 
behind the name, a colony of the rare Australian sea lions and miles of 
beautiful coast, such as the literallyRemarkable Rocks <http://bit.ly/ZUBL57>. 
If you can stay one or more nights, there is much more to see, and hiking is a 
popular way to take it all in (find suggested routes here 
<http://www.tourkangarooisland.com.au/wildlife/walks.aspx>). There are various 
accommodation options, from camping and aYHA hostel 
<http://www3.yha.com.au/hostels/sa/kangaroo-island/> (from £18pp) to high-end 
luxury <http://www.southernoceanlodge.com.au/>, listed on the island's website,

And finally: even more wine! The McLaren Vale wine region is renowned for 
edgier, more Italian- and Spanish-influenced varieties, such as tempranillos. 
Boutique wineryPrimo Estate <http://www.primoestate.com.au> is recommended for 
its premium label, and the olive oil it produces has a huge fanbase too. If
