 A Blackburn 'play area' made from building site materials. Photograph: Sam

This photograph shows the corner of a residential car park in Blackburn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackburn>, Lancashire. Local children have 
made themselves an impromptu "play area" out of bits of spare wood and other 
materials from a nearby building site.

The reason I took this photo is that it illustrates how cuts to public 
spending are affecting families. There are no new play areas for local children 
being created, or existing ones being safely maintained, hence children are 
taking matters into their own hands and making their own makeshift play areas.
