Jan Woolf writes: To watch Adrian Mitchell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/adrian-mitchell> (obituary, December 22) 
prepare his body for a performance of To Whom It May Concern - chin cupped in 
hand, eyes focused, back tense, "I got run over by the truth one day ..." - was 
to see a great poet steadying himself with all the focus and tension of a 
warrior. When those blue suede shoes got moving, the poem came alive. He 
breathed it, lived it, became it. It was as if he were dancing with language to 
get at the truth.

He never let up. Most calls - "can you do this one Adrian?" - were answered, 
"sure, I'll be there." His reading Tell Me Lies at a City Hall benefit just 
before the 2003 invasion of Iraq was electrifying. Of course, he couldn't stop 
that war, but he performed as if he could.
