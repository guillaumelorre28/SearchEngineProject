Ian Birrell’s discovery as David Cameron’s former speech writer (How Tories 
like me learned to love the interfering state 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/14/tories-state-government-intervention>
, 15 January) that perhaps even Tory governments need interventionist states is 
a sign of just how unprepared for real government Cameron’s team was. 
Continental conservatives and liberals have known for more than two centuries 
that economic development and profitable trade and production can only be 
achieved if there is a strong state to ensure at least health, housing, 
education, training and social security for all workers, research and power for 
industry, and infrastructures of transport (railways), local government and 
other forms of spatial and social democratic integration to make it all work 
together. The ideological difference is not the intervention, which is 
functionally indispensable, but the underlying values: in the conservative 
model the social integration is hierarchical, while the social democratic model 
is egalitarian.

The educated right has long known that what even continental conservatives 
call the “European Foundations of the Welfare State 
<http://www.amazon.com/European-Foundations-Welfare-Franz-Xaver-Kaufmann/dp/0857454765>
” (Kaufmann 2012) depends on an interventionist state. The real puzzle is not 
so much why Labour lost the last elections but why Ayn Rand’s neoliberal 
fantasies were treated by government politicians and their “austerity-hugging” 
media as better economic management models than the traditional conservative or 
social democratic interventionist versions which worked relatively successfully 
until Mrs Thatcher failed to understand both the functional point or the 
historical evidence. Does the infrastructure have to be destroyed before the 
Tory MPs grasp the point and force a change of policy?

• Dreda Say Mitchell rightly suggests the PM should offer solutions on social 
mobility and skills. There are many issues that blight the lives on the estates 
Cameron wants to demolish (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/11/housing-estate-david-cameron-social-housing>
, 12 January) and everywhere else where rents are rising so fast, while the 
value of the lowest incomes are diminished even faster, that unmanageable debt 
and hunger are inevitable. Perhaps he could also tell people how they get on 
their bikes when they are being beaten to their knees.
