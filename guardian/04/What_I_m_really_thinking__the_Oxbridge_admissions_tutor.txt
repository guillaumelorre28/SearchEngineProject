Within seconds of you entering the room for your interview, I can tell where 
you come from. You are awkward and bewildered, desperate to please. In 
contrast, some of you have been prepared for this moment all of your lives. 
Your sense of entitlement emanates from the easy way in which you inhabit the 
space, your scruffy hair and practised handshake. I think: class privilege 
is alive and kicking in this room.

My job is to penetrate the layers of social conditioning and discover what 
you’d be like to teach. Some of you can make it harder for me by bursting into 
tears, or forgetting why you want to study my subject. You may not stand out, 
so I scribble notes to trigger my memory: “red jumper”, or “very religious”. 
But some of you stay with me years later – a candidate from a failing school, 
simmering with hostility, who magically transformed when given the chance to 
talk about something he’d enjoyed reading. Four years later, he left with a 
first. Raw talent and hunger for knowledge are, usually, not that difficult to 
spot.

It’s a time-consuming and draining process, but for many of us, it is also one 
of the most rewarding parts of our job. All of you have shown academic 
brilliance to get to this point, but now, whatever your background, you are at 
your most vulnerable: you know that the next 25 minutes will determine your 
future. I have the privilege to witness the moment when you first have to give 
a good account of yourself to the outside world.

And for four of you, this interview will be just the start of our conversation.
