Veering unashamedly into strut territory is John Travolta’s Tony Manero, who 
set movie screens alight in 1977 disco classicSaturday Night Fever and its 
questionable 1983 follow-upStaying Alive. Travolta’s seminal swagger ignites 
both the original’s intro – en route to work, carrying a tin of paint – and the 
sequel’s outro, backed by the obligatory Bee Gees anthem Stayin’ Alive. Manero 
summarises the infectious appeal of his moves before his final scene: “You know 
what I want to do? Strut!”

Setting the tone for Quentin Tarantino’s 1992 breakout film Reservoir Dogs is 
one of cinema’s most infamous strides: as ccmac10 asserts “an iconic walk that 
launched a thousand parodies”. Soundtracked by George Baker’sLittle Green Bag, 
the film’s eight protagonists saunter, suited and booted, into the opening 
credits, an image that would become the logo for Tarantino and Lawrence 
Bender’s production company A Band Apart.

“Peter Kay’s meandering march toward Amarillo?” suggests stevenjameshyde. 
Perhaps not yet worthy of iconic cultural status, the video for the 2005 remake 
of Tony Christie’s (Is This the Way To) Amarillo sees Peter Kay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/peter-kay> making his jolly way alongside 
a host of celebrities, somewhat eerily including Jimmy Savile. Released to 
raise money for Comic Relief, Kay walked into the UK charts at No 1, with 
Amarillo going on to become the highest-selling single of the year.

“Alec Guinness’s brief walk at the end of the Bridge On The River Kwai is 
profoundly, and yet morbidly stupid, heroic stiff-upper-lip stuff,” says 
steveblock. It’s hard to argue with that, as we see Guinness’s Colonel 
Nicholson struck fatally by mortar fire, stumbling punch-drunk before falling 
onto a nearby detonator plunger, blowing up his beloved bridge and sending the 
train crossing it hurtling into the Kwai. Equally memorable is Guinness’s 
earlier exit from “the oven” – a walk he claims was based on his 
polio-afflicted son Matthew.

One of the great ambiguous plot twists, and walks, in modern cinema comes in 
the final scenes of 1995 classicThe Usual Suspects, as Kevin Spacey’s character 
Roger “Verbal” Kint limps out of a police station on bail, Spacey appearing to 
metamorphose as he goes from Kint, a con artist with cerebral palsy, into 
mythical crime lord Keyser Söze.

Harry Dean Stanton’s stagger through the desert in the opening scene of Wim 
Wenders’s 1984 Palme d’Or winnerParis, Texas is as quintessential a walk as 
they come. Coupled with a haunting Ry Cooder slide-guitar score, the south 
Texas wilderness provides a vast, lonely catwalk for amnesiac nomad Travis 
Henderson. The least conventional cowboy in Stanton’s portfolio, Henderson is 
arguably his most memorable.


7 | Michael Jackson’s moonwalk

As the king of pop’s signature move, the moonwalk became a ubiquity among 
Jacko wannabes in nightclubs, school discos and talent shows during the 1980s 
and 90s. Characterised by the illusion that the dancer is gliding backwards, 
Jackson first performed the move to his hit Billie Jean, going on to name his 
autobiographyMoonwalk and star in the 1998 film Moonwalker. Despite Jackson’s 
synonymy with the moonwalk, its history can be traced back to the 1930s.

Our inclusion of The Verve’s Bitter Sweet Symphony led alexito to raise the 
issue that the “video is a straight copy of Massive Attack’s Unfinished 
Sympathy”. Ashcroft et al undoubtedly pay homage to the 1991 track and Baillie 
Walsh-directed video, the latter filmed in one continuous shot and featuring 
vocalist Shara Nelson pounding the streets from 1311 South New Hampshire Avenue 
to 2632 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles. Sean O’Hagan later described it inthe 
Observer as a “benchmark in modern video direction, more a breathtaking short 
film than a mere pop promo”.

“One of the most famous and most loved walks in culture’’ would have to be the 
walk from the Shire to Mordor,” argues Ingill. Frodo and company’s fictional 
stomp through Middle Earth forms the backbone of Tolkien’s fantasy epicThe Lord 
of the Rings, and takes six months in total, with Frodo and Sam leaving the 
Shire on 23 September 3018 of the Third Age and the destruction of the Ring at 
Mount Doom taking place on 25 March 3019 TA.

Similarly epic in scale was Johann Sebastian Bach’s journey to visit the 
Danish-German composer and organist Dieterich Buxtehude in 1705. The story goes 
that a 20-year old Bach made the entire 560-mile round trip, from his home in
Arnstadt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnstadt> to the northern German city 
of Lübeck, on foot. The young composer stayed in Lübeck for three months to 
hear theAbendmusik (evening concerts), meet Buxtehude and hear him play. A 
truly dedicated fanboy.
