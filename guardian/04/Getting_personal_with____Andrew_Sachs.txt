 Have you ever adopted a pseudonym and, if so, why? Yes, sometimes, to keep my 
writing and performing activities separate.

 Have you ever lied about your age and, if so, why? No. 

 How would you describe yourself in a lonely hearts ad? Please ignore this ad. 
There are more needy people further down the column.

 What was the last illegal thing you did? It was yesterday. My dog did his 
doings on the pavement while I wasn't looking, and I didn't have a poo-bag with 
me.

 What was the last kind-hearted thing you did? I was nice to me on my birthday 
(so, incidentally, were my family and friends).

 Who's the nicest person you've ever worked with? My daughter. 

 What are the initials of the most unpleasant person you've ever worked with? 
666

 What would you advertise without a fee? (a) charities, and (b) my desire for 
plenty of treats.

 What would you never advertise? My private life, even if the money was 
terrific (it wouldn't be in my case, thank the Lord).

 What wakes you up screaming at 4 in the morning? Not screaming exactly, but 
dreams about having to go on stage and not knowing what play I'm in come close 
to screams.

 What takes you to a "happy place"? The mere anticipation of travel. 
Otherwise, Mahler's 4th.
