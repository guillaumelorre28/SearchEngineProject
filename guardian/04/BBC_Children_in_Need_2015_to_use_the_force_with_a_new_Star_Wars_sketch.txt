BBC Children in Need 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/children-in-need> is to join forces 
with Lucasfilm and Disney for a one-off special.

In an exclusive Star Wars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars>-inspired 
sketch to be broadcast on BBC1 during this year’s appeal, the galaxy’s 
favourite droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, will be joined by Warwick Davis (who played 
Wicket the Ewok in Return of the Jedi) “as they attempt to find a worthy winner 
to help trigger the first BBC Children in Need totaliser of the night”.
