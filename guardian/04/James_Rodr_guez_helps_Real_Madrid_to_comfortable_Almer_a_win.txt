James Rodríguez scored a stunning goal to lead Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> to a 3-0 win over Almería on 
Wednesday that kept his side two points behind Barcelona in the final stretch 
of the Spanish league title race.

Rodríguez volleyed home a long-range shot seconds before half-time at the 
Bernabéu.

The Almería defender Mauro Dos Santos then deflected a pass meant for 
Cristiano Ronaldo into his own goal in the 49th minute to put Madrid in 
complete control. Álvaro Arbeloa sealed the win from Javier Hernández’s pass 
six minutes from time.

With four games left, Madrid next face a tough visit at Sevilla on Saturday 
while Barcelona play at the bottom club, Cordóba.

Champions Atlético Madrid stayed on course to secure third place and an 
automatic spot in the Champions League when Fernando Torres came off the bench 
and scored a thrilling breakaway goal to clinch a 1-0 win at Villarreal.
