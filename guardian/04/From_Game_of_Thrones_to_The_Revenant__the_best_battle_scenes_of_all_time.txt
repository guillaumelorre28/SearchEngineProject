From Spartacus’s battles with the Romans to Maximus Decimus Meridius’s 
ruthless destruction of the Teutonic hordes in Gladiator, Hollywood has always 
been obsessed with showing humanity in monumental, monstrous conflict. But with 
some critics labelling the epic Battle of the Bastards smackdown in the latest 
episode ofGame of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> the greatest screen 
ruckus of all time, does it measure up to some of the big screen’s most 
impressive dust-ups?

Remember in old westerns when some other woefully misrepresented Native 
American nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/29/matthew-mcconaughey-native-american-born-to-run-gold>
 would helpfully circle the wagons, usually without actually attacking anyone, 
while the brave pioneers picked them off one by one with their vastly superior 
firepower? Well, according to The Revenant, that wasn’t a particularly 
realistic rendition of historic Native American fighting techniques.
Alejandro González Iñárritu’s harrowing frontier revenge thriller was the kind 
of movie that made you wonder if being a movie star might not be worth all the 
hassle after all. Leonardo DiCaprio may have won the Oscar, but he had to eat 
raw liver, cauterise his own wounds, fight an angry momma bear and sleep inside 
a dead horse in order to take the big prize. Iñárritu uses the terrifying 
opening battle scene, in which DiCaprio’s fur trapping expedition is suddenly 
attacked by a party of Ree braves, to set us up for the epic horrors to come. 
Featuring some simply superb tracking work, it is cinematic defibrillation of 
the highest order.

In which Michael Caine and his heroic band of 150 British riflemen 
successfully hold off 6,000 Zulu warriors thanks to their command of modern 
martial techniques, incredible bravery and possession of actual guns. In order 
to bring the epic 1879 battle to life, director Cy Endfield employed 2,000 Zulu 
extras butbaulked at employing the extra 4,000 required 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/michael-caine-thought-zulu-performance-3825906>
 to depict the full majesty of the army. In the modern era, the movie would 
have used CGI to create the illusion of a grander force. But this being 1964, 
producers simply asked each “warrior” to carry bits of wood, with shields and 
head dresses stuck on top, to help pad the numbers.

The Battle of the Pelennor Fields, from 2003’s Return of the King, may have 
been the almighty rumpus that won Peter Jackson’s epic trilogy all those 
Oscars, but it was the Battle of Helm’s Deep, from 2002’s The Two Towers, that 
showed the Kiwi film-maker’s mastery of high fantasy mega-bedlam. The sheer 
scale of the confrontation between Saruman’s ’orrible Orcs and the weaker, 
Aragon-led combined forces of the Rohirrim and elves of Lothlorien was like 
nothing seen on the big screen before. That the vast, evil army of Christopher 
Lee’s treacherous old wizard could be ultimately defeated with a bit of 
dwarf-throwing andGandalf’s magic sunshine staff 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpwsKRpKS_M> made victory all the sweeter.

Making a war movie about a desperate, foolhardy attempt to return a mother’s 
last son to the bosom of his family is a verySteven Spielberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/stevenspielberg> thing to do. But the cold 
clarity of the film’s key flashback scene, showing the Normandy landings in all 
their gruesome glory, cuts through the sentimental schmaltz like a bayonet 
through human flesh.

Costing $12m and reputedly featuring 1,500 extras, the 30-minute scene has no 
equal as a realistic representation of the horrors of the second world war 
battlefield. War here is a grim cauldron of blood, guts, vomit, tears and 
burning flesh. But this being a Spielberg movie, the humanity shines through in 
snatches of gallows humour and fragments of selfless individual heroism.

It was once thought that TV fantasy could never hope to mirror the epic 
spectacle of, say, Jackson’sLord of the Rings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/lord-of-the-rings> movies for budgetary 
reasons alone. In season one, Game of Thrones got around the problem of 
shooting huge numbers of soldiers, horses and grunty hill tribesmen by 
following Tyrion Lannister into the blissful depths of unconsciousness for the 
entirety of the Battle of the Green Fork.

The Battle of the Bastards pulled no such trick, even going so far as to give 
viewers a bravura tracking shot (of sorts) as Jon Snow is reportedly saved from 
instant death at the hands of the opposition forces – or just as likely his own 
– by the kind of crazy sheer luck that Lady Melisandre would probably have to 
sacrifice several small children of royal blood to the Red God in order to 
achieve.

Knights barrel into footsoldiers and axe-wielding horsemen are taken out by 
spear-wielding horsemen, just as all of them are about to stick the Stark Who 
Lived with the pointy end. Quite how anyone knows who they’re supposed to fight 
in the midst of all this murderous melee is beyond us, but that’s pretty much 
the point. War is a terrible, random mess of mud, blood, guts and imminent 
instant death – which is why the best place for it is really on TV, where we 
can at least ensure that the bad guy gets his comeuppance at the end. And, boy, 
did that bastard get it.
