"Of course I'm thrilled that Simon Mann

 has been released!" I shrieked in a strangled voice at yet another reporter. 
"Darling Patsy, as the rest of us called him, because he was the – well, 
because he was just our Patsy – home at last! I've been mad with worry, even 
that time when his lawyer rang and I told him to call back after the grand prix 
was over. All my hard work to free him has paid off."

Think I finessed it, but for how long? For only the 937th time in my life, I 
hit number one on my speed dial. "Mummy?" I breathed expectantly. But that cow 
Carol was already round there. "Oh, I might have known you'd be on, prodigal 
son," she hissed down the phone. "What's the matter? Both legs down the same 
trouser? Confused by your kettle again? Suspected of trying to overthrow the 
government of Equatorial Guinea and assume Mummy's going to kiss it all better?"

Felt an odd frisson. Suppressed it. "Listen old girl," I began…

"Don't you dare 'old girl' me," exploded Carol. "She's not up to this. But the 
minute you show your face she'll be pulling strings, just like she didn't do 
for me with thatgolliwog business

 at the BBC." The sobs began.

"I don't know why they made such a fuss, I loved my golliwog when I was 
little. It was my only friend when you and Mummy were having your special time 
together…"

"Sis, you're hysterical," I snapped. "I'm coming over to speak to her. Just 
give me 10 minutes to load the car with my laundry."
