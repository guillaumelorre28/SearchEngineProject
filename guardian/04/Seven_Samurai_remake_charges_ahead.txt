A remake of the classic Japanese film Seven Samurai has been given the green 
light by Hollywood 
<http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118036321?categoryid=4076&cs=1&cmpid=RSS|News|FilmNews>
, with British film-maker Scott Mann set to direct, Variety (paywall) reports.

The Weinstein Company, owned by Oscar-winning US producers Bob and Harvey 
Weinstein <https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein>, has been 
planning a new version of Akira Kurosawa's tale of heroism for at least three 
years. Now it seems the project is moving forward following the appointment of 
Mann, whose debut 2009 feature The Tournament starred Robert Carlyle and Ving 
Rhames. Young Guns writer John Fusco has been working on a screenplay.

Seven Samurai <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047478/> was notably remade as The 
Magnificent Seven in 1960 and arguably introduced a common Hollywood plot 
device that has been utilised for films from Ocean's Eleven to The Dirty Dozen: 
the recruitment and gathering of a set of heroes to accomplish a given goal. 
The three-hour epic was named in Sight and Sound's top 10 films of all time in 
1982 and is a fixture on critics' best-of lists, as well as one of the first 
Japanese movies to have a huge influence on western film-makers.

Mann's version will reportedly relocate the action to northern Thailand, where 
a threatened town hires a crew of paramilitary mercenaries to protect it. The 
film-maker will also assist with screenwriting.

The Weinstein name may at first suggest a classy modern-day reworking, but 
optimists should be wary. As well as films such as The King's Speech, 
Fahrenheit 911 and Shakespeare in Love (the latter at their previous firm 
Miramax), Bob and Harvey were also behind Piranha 3D, Scary Movie 4 and three 
feeble sequels to The Crow.
