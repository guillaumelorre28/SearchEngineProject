Platforms.'

The 'Audiences Not Platforms

' tool was honoured in the 'multiscreen' category and allows advertisers to 
plan, buy and measure effectively around audiences, instead of buying media in 
silos.

The awards recognise and champion the vital role research plays in effective 
digital marketing.
