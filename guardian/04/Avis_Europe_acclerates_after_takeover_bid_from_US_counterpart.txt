exclusive licence to use the brand across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and 
Asia. The deal will give the US business access to the fast growing emerging

sought to own. [It] re-unites the global operation of the Avis and Budget 
brands under one corporate umbrella, and is both financially and strategically 
compelling.
