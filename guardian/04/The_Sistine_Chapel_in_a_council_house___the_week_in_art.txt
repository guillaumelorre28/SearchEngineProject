Exhibition of the week

I Am Van Dyck
So who was Anthony van Dyck? This 17th-century Flemish painter who died in 
Britain as the civil war started is a strangely elusive figure. The most 
brilliant pupil of Rubens and one of the great technical masters of all time, 
he seems to have been happy to ply his trade as a portraitist of the cavalier 
aristocracy in Charles I’s England. Some of his portraits have a startling 
truthfulness – and that goes for his celebrated last self-portrait, which is 
scrutinised in this show alongside self-portraits by Turner prize-winner Mark 
Wallinger. Is Van Dyck, then, the true father of modern British art?

 The Drunken Silenus Supported by Satyrs, possibly by Anthony van Dyck, circa 
1620. Photograph: Alamy 
What a body. The glorious corpulent flesh of Silenus slops all over this 
mighty painting with an abandon that mixes classical myth (Silenus is the 
companion of the wine god Bacchus) with north European carnival traditions. 
Painted in the studio of Rubens and ripe with his rollicking approach to high 
art, it may be mostly the work of the young Van Dyck, but the grapes are by 
nature artist Frans Snyders. Alcohol warnings? What alcohol warnings?
